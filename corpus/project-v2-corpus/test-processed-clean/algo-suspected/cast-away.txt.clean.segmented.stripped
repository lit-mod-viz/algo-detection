cast away at the pole by author of little miss vassar the cotton bag the et cetera
a our situation was not only hopeless but demoralizing as well
i realized this when i caught the professor looking at me with hard and hungry eyes
what ails you prebble
i asked straiglitening out the sleeping bag with my numb fingers
my body craves nutrition he answered huskily must eat
have you forgoiten that we divided the last ounce of pemmican yesterday
how could i forget it i replied with this dreadful gnawing at my stomach to serve as a constant reminder something must be done my companion declared with convulsive energy
but what
i returned
here we are lost on the ice cap abandoned by our eskimo guides sled gone dogs gone compass broken and nothing to eat but our sealskin clothes
something must be done you say and i agree with you fully
you joined this expedition to solve problems
solve this one
that should have floored prebble
but it did not have already solved this oneto my own satisfaction said he
and again that hard and hungry look was turned on me
what are you thinking of
i demanded angrily
he gave a cackling illtimed laugha laugh that irritated me beyond words
the old law of the survival of the fittest will apply here he said
in your dash for the pole captain you have attained the farthest north and i have demonstrated the truth of the meteoric theory of the aurora borealis
if i go back i can tell what you have done but you if you returned to civilization without me could no more tell of my discovery than discourse in attic greek
ergo return
i knew what he meant well enough
but i was notready to serve as a diet for the professor even at the command of science and as for eking out my own miserable existence with a ragout la prebble iwould as soon have thought of bolting the rule of three crazy i said shiveringly
consistent my dear fellow
see here i went on behind us is the ship and the ships crew
when the eskimo guides get back without us searching parties will be sent out and well be found
but suppose the eskimo guides donot get back choose to think that they will i responded firmly not going to yield up my life to you and your meteoric theory of the aurora flat you a thought beyond your own selfish aims and ambitions prebble returned indignantly
possibly i have i flung back at him tartly but i refuse to throw myself away on a little old professor with a bee in his bonnet
that was a shot that went home
the professor sank into a morbid silence
besides i proceeded farthest north doesnot satisfy me
i shall attain the only point on this earth where the compass has but three cardinal points east west and south
the north pole he exclaimed
madman shall attain it i fepeatd warm olow of enthusiasm pulsing through my hungry body shall plant my countrys flag at the apex of the earth
what good will it do vour country or any other country he asked
you talk strangely professor i said frigidly will the discovery of the north pole benefit mankind or advance civilization a single inch consider the luster of the achievement sir
luster of the achievement irabile dictu
not only that i went on waving my mittened hand in a direction i believed to be south but somewhere behind us is that execrable griffyn englishman sir who has sworn to beat me to the pole
have you no pride no patriotism i have both said prebble plaintively
i am hungry
hungry
the insolence of this professor filled me with wrath unutterable
i towered above him and gave him a look that sent him crouching to his knees
he lifted his hands appealingly
your nose sir said he is very white
i left off glaring at him picked up a handful of snow and began rubbing my nose
by the time circulation was restored i found the professor had crawled into the sleeping bag so i crawled in beside him thankful he had warmed it up
this particular bag was a threeman bag that is capable of holding three adults
it was shaped like an envelope opening from end to end was made of reindeer skin and had an outer covering of oiltanned sealskin the latter keeping out the water and keeping in the animal heat
i fastened the flap over the opening
then prebble bade me an ironical good night
the professors good night may have been ironical because of one of two things either because of his resentment toward me or at that time of the year in the arctics continual day reigned and there was no night
which is the greater achievement prebble i asked finding the pole or demonstrating the truth of a meteoric theory
there is no comparison captain salis
finding the north pole is simply a matter of brute endurance but demonstrating the truth of that theory sir involves forth all the best powers of the mind
bah sir
i cried
bah to you he retorted
there and then i made a mental vow that the next time i went exploring in the arctics i would use more care in selecting the scientific members of the expedition
prebble had a string of letters after his name abbreviating his honorable suffixes and extending his to sit with the highbrows but he was about as sociable as a polar bear
he had said good night merely to open our mutfled canversation in the sleeping bag
sometimes he was like thata human movingpicture film run through the lantern wrong end to
i had bakd him in the hope of cutting short his garrulity
but the effort failed
suppose you find the pole said he how are you going to know when you get there
for a professor of your attainments observed frigidly that remark is asinine
he cackled jeeringly
how are you going to make sure youre at the north pole when you get there he repeated with maddening insistence
by observations
i snapped vouch for the accuracy of your observations
you will
you havenot any sympathy with my aims or aspirations prebble but youll have to support me in a matter of truth and verity
if you donot your scientific reputation will suffer
once more he cackled have been making mental notes and drawing deductions he proceeded and from my studies of human activities in the frozen world i venture a most remarkable but most scientific conclusion
do you care to hear it
if you have discovered anything remarkable i scored the event is sufficiently unique to command my attention
out with it prebble
listen he returned in his most didactic tone
the basis of all observations that are to command the respect and confidence of the learned public is embraced in the old statement of meis sana in corpore sanoa sound mind in a sound body
in using your artificial horizon and working out your position you must approach the task with every faculty alert and unclouded
certainly agreed
salis he declared no human being can undergo the awful perils and hardships of polar discovery without an overthrow of his mental poise
bosh
i cried
derision said he is the fools answer to an argument proving nothing and leading nowherc
do you mean to say i demanded that i will not keep my reason
you have not kept it my friend
even now with the pole still far away the intense cold the terrific physical strain and the insufficient food have thrown you off your mental balance
you are not yourself and you have not been yourself for several days
my discoveries along this line lead me to propound a theory of polar aberration
the other day you called the white snow purple
that is a chromatic proof of failing reason rage filled me rage and indignation
prebble cried you are the one who is losing his mind
you another proof he continued calmly is your obstinate refusal to listen to my highly valuable suggestions
if your mind was unclouded you would profit by my very excellent advice
if you had your senses i answered you wouldnot think of turning cannibal merely to enable you to get back to civilization and propound your meteoric theory of the aurora
desperate straits require desperate remedies he insisted
if you were to propound such a desperate remedy back home how long would it be before you were clapped intoa straitjacket a remedy would not be propounded back home it would not be necessary mad as a hatter
i told himand i was really beginning to think so
when a mind fails said he it is a fact of record that it believes every other mind has failed
salis more and more you prove my contention
the fact of record i returned applies both ways
you think crazy and i know you are
i shall discover the pole and shall convince the learned public that i have discovered it
when i get out of this bag and the ink in my fountain pen is thawed out so i can write with it put down the substance of your remarks in my diary hope so he answered
and i hope you will put them down exactly as i make them
in your present deplorable condition however i presume that is asking too much
thereupon he rolled to one side of the bag and i rolled to the other
there was a coldness between us
strange how little things conspire to shape our destines here below
but for the space which mutual intolerance placed between the professor and myself in that threeman sleeping bag one or both of us would have been sacrificed and our sleep would have been a sleep of death
i remember reflecting bitterly on our hapless lot and dozing off by degrees the professors snores fading on my ears and at last dying away utterly
how long i slept i have no means of knowing but suddenly i was awakened by such a tremendous shock as i never expect to experience again and live the ends of the frozen bag were bent toward each other with a great crackling so that insfead of lying prostrate i was in a sitting position thrust one hand toward side of the bag only to encounter a partition of deerskin
what had happened
the sleeping bag had suddenly acquired motionnot over the rough surface of the ice cap but apparently throughthe air
i had a thought which chilled my blood
had the bag slipped over a precipice at the edge of the ice cap
and were we falling falling but no this could not be
there was no precipice at the edge of the ice cap and the theory was untenable
besides if we had been falling we would have struck something long since
have you noticed captain that we have a concentric and a lateral as well as a forward motion prebble exclaimed
are you alive
keenly sir
this is a most astounding phenomenon
i now discovered that the partition of reindeer hide separating the professor from myself consisted of a fold of the sleeping bag pushed inward as by some hard substance
what do you think is going on i asked
our gyratory motion suggests a hurricane he answered
it may be that we have been caught off the top of the ice cap by an arctic whirlwind
can you open the flap captain
i could and did after some little trouble
the lengthwise slit was in front of us and we were able to look through it without a change of position
the view was not satisfactory for a great white cloud enveloped us and made it impossible to see very far in any direction
we were suspended in gray space and moving with frightful rapidity
as we gazed out into the void a black object came rushing from overhead grazed the side of the sleeping bag and vanished below
it was over in a flash so quickly in fact that neither i nor my companion could determine what manner of thing the object was
merciful powers gasped
we are bounding upward mused prebble as well as onward
can you imagine what that thing was
i queried
possibly a missile of meteoric origin
you are more athletic than i am captain and donot you think you could get an upward look without falling from the bag
i craned my neck outside
the next instang an exclamation escaped my lips
what do you see asked prebble eagerly rope
suspended from what canot see
the object it hangs from is lost in the clouds
by the mizzenffuck of the gr harry
what now
i had made a discovery that almost caused my hair to stand on end
this sleeping bag is caught on the fluke of an anchor see i see
the sleping bag was scooped up bodily the fluke catching it in the center
your weight on one side and my weight on the other balances the bag
beautiful beautiful
some aronaut is making for the pole by balloonhis drag rope swept the ice capthe anchor caught us
the object that darted downward a moment ago was a sandbag thrown from the balloon to offset our added weight
most remarkable
prebble was chuckling rubbing his mittened hands together and thoroughly enjoying the situation some scamp is trying to get ahead of griffyn and me said i crossly
do you observe that the cold is abating inquired my companton
the sleeping bag does seem to be thawing out
exactly
and i am in a profuse perspiration
prebble divested himself of his mittens and parka then from somewhere about his person he produced his steelrimmed spectaclesand adjusted them to his nose
ah he exclaimed peering at me sharply
it is a joy to use ones glasses and have them keep ciear of the frost
do you realize what a rising thermometer means captain said divesting it means warmer weather myself of a few of my furs
also that we are sailing southward at a greaf rate
i was startled for i had not thought of the rising temperature in that way
my hope of reaching the pole on that expedition was to be only a hope and nothing more
the field was being left clear for my rival griffyn the man who had followed me like shadow ever since leaving the coast of labrador
my bitterness of soul may be imagined but not described
in the gloom of the moment i forgot my hunger forgot thatthe professor and i werebalanced on the iron horn of a dilemma that might easily prove our undoingforgot everything in fact but that i had weathered that long arctic night and borne innumerable hardships all to nno purpose
we enter the domains of the improbable came the remark of the professor breaking in upon my unpleasant reflections
hard luck has a domain of its own said glaring from my niche into and its so commonplace you canot call it improbable
you do not grasp my meaning captain my companion proceeded
if you were to give any one in the temperate zone a true account of this adventure your statements would be dismissed with a shrugif with nothing worse
you would have to back up my statements prebble
your scientific standing would bolster up my integrity as a navigator and donot know about that
i fell back aghast
picked off the ice cap by a balloon and carried southward on the fluke of an anhor i had been meditating an indictiment against some reckless aronaut
the terms of that indictment were to set me right before those who had helped finance my expedition
what do you mean i rasped angrily know you have no sympathy with my poar aims and ambitions but you canot deny the evidence of your senses
captain he returned am doubting the evidence of my senses
north of the arctic circle the human faculties become frozen and unrelable
i do not credit our present do not dare
poppycock
i cried inwrathful impatience we are under the spell of the purple snows he went on adventures seem very real to us because our hardships have created illusions
all my life i have fought against being led astray by illusionsand under the pole star lies the abode of things that seem but are not mad as a hatter
i stormed
not mad salis he protested mildly but temporarily unbalanced
you are in the same state of mind
i saw him wriggle around in his half of the sleeping bag punching and pinching himself
really it seemed he had an idea that he was asleep and dreaming these very momentous events saw him shake his head forebodingly upon being forced to the conclusion that he was wide awake a scientific freak prebble i jeered am trying in my feeble way he answered to combat error
you are trying to give reason the lie what it amounts to
when your brain is clear captain you will consider my actions differently
we are being snatched southward at a pace which should soon carry us out of these regions of illusion i observed
then if we are still in this sleeping bag and balanced across the fluke of the anchor i suppose you will have to believe what you see
he made no response but i could see that my words had thrown him into a brown study
and i continued bitterly while we are bound for the prosy lands of reality and truth my rival for polar honors is pressing forward into the white world of enchantment where he will probably discover what i have spent the better part of my life looking for let that fact distress you captain said prebble
griffyn may think he has found the pole and he may even get back to civilization to tell of itbut who will believe him
these words although i knew them to be farfetched and far from dependable gave me a thrill of delight
if my own statements and figures regarding the discovery of the pole were not to be offered in evidence i took pleasure in seeing the report of my rival completely discredited
the sentiment was unworthy i grant but i was human and had the customary human failings anyhow captain proceeded prebble you have a contract with a newspaper a contract with a magazine and a contract with a lecture bureau
out of these various contracts you will be able to amass a fortune even if you find the pole
griffyn even though he is successful will be discredited
you are an exofficer of the army and the army will be behind you
griffyn is only a poor devil who took a chance on reaching the pole because he happned to find the way open
nobody will believe griflyn
if you claim only the farthest north everybody will believe youin spite of the fact that you may not believe in yourself
this is foolish talk prebble i declared
you ought to be above such random conversation
in my mind however i was already planning my newspaper and magazine articles and was figuring on the results of that lecture campaign
there was a possibility that i should receive the thanksof congress and a medal
my heart began to thaw out even as the frost was melting away from the sleeping bag
our motion through space was easy and exhilarating
it was like flying through the skies on downy beds of ease
swinging through the air and covering the miles with magical swiftness was vastly different from trekking with dogs and sledges over the broken floes and making great detours to avoid open leads of water
we were going southward and the result of my daring and my perils had been merely the attainment of the farthest north
although the fact was deplorable it had its amenities i gave myself over to a long period o contemplation
in the course of my thoughts i found occasion to dwell at some length on the arrival of this mysterious balloon
who was the aronaut and where had he come from
quite naturally i could formulate no answers to these mental queries
hours passed then suddenly my companion reached over the partition and touched my shoulder
the cloud is vanishing he said out and look upward captain
i obeyed
high above us was the huge bulk of a balloon and visible over the rim of the wickerwork car suspended beneath were the faces of two men whom i knew only too well
i was speechless for a moment
then a cry of rage escaped me
salis by jupiter boomed a voice from overhead
griffyn
i shouted
what an irony of fate
my enemy and his secretary were the aronauts and it was theiranchor that had hooked into our sleeping bag
prebble clasped his bony hands convulsively didnot know that griffyn had a balloon he muttered hoarsely
for sake captain be amiable
be silence
i commanded
you have taken an underhand advantage of me captain salis my enemy called down
you have attached yourself to my anchor sirrah with never so much as a by your leave
your conduct is unprofessional and i shall make it known to the members of the arctic club
if i had wanted to take you with me i should have invited you
being a sailor i had a supply of language for just such an emergency as this
before i could release the torrent of words however griffyn his lasting infamy be it saidhad reached his hand from the basket and had severed the drag rope with a keen knife
down we dropped through the depths of space down down the wind shrieking in our ears and our brains reeling
then a shock a roar as of a hundred niagaras and after thatoblivion
where are we
that was my first question
it fell instinctively from my lips and was addressed to no one in particular
i was a very much bewildered man
as i reclined on the ground and made use of my startled eyes to my right i saw a pond circular in form and perhaps fifty yards in diameter
this pond was edged with blocks of white stone in the center of it stood a graven figure of colossal proportions a jet of water spouting from its uplifted hands
rosebushes in full bloom bordered the lake and back of the rosebushes separated by a stretch of white sand grew palm trees tossing their fronded tops in the balmy air
birds sang in the depths of the grove and a genial heat pervaded the atmosphere
i rubbed my foreheadwater
hying from the sleeves of my soaked coat as i raised my hands
where are we
i asked again this time in a louder key
marvelous crooned a familiar voice behind me is the balloon is ourselves is the lake and the way we got out divided from a goes into i looked around and there knelt that blessed old professor wet as a rat tracing algebraic symbols in the sand with his finger
professor i called avast with your foolish ness and try to make a guess as to where we are
he looked up at me blankly
water from his drenched garments had rilled around him in the sandy soil and was running down his arm and off the index finger that was tracing the symbols
still on his knees over the unsolved equation he allowed his eyes to wander from me toward our surroundings fountain he said
really a most admirable work of art and it spouts fresh water said freeingy my lungs of a mouthful of it
the lake he went on running his gaze oven the circular stone borders shows calculation and design carried out with engineering skill and a rare eye for beauty correct i agreed
roses in full bloom he proceeded
the air is redolent of odors that are soothing and delightful
exactly i returned
we must have made a tremendous southing on the fluke of that anchor
palm trees suggest the tropics
suggest he answered grant you but it is a suggestion we must adopt warily
the leagues upon leagues that lie between the arctic circle and the equator could not have been covered by us on the fluke of the anchor
l know that said and i wish youd exercise your wits and make a guess at our present position bewildered
one thing at a time captain he admonished bending over his problem is the balloon is ourselves has become of the balloon i cut in searchmg the skies for some 5ign of the sky wanderer
prebble frowned and again looked up
bus he did not rise
when we were cut away captain he explained the immense weight suddenly released from the balloon caused it to mount to extraordimary heights
this warm air too would have its effect on the gas in the bag expanding it and giving it tremendous buoyancy
griffyn is sailing on
and southward i chuckled
the scoundrel dropped us by the way and i am glad we have parted company
in his rage he is at least leaving us nearer the pole than he is himself
the professor frowned thoughtfully
griffyn must have come from the north captain he observed
in order to pick us off the ice cap and bear us south griffyn must have come out of the north
the professors logic paralyzed me
do you thinkis it possible my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth and i could carry the ditressing words no further
do i think finished the professor that he has discovered the pole and that he was coming away from it when the anchor picked us up
that is an open question an open question
we need not concern ourselves about it once more he began his movements over the sand is the balloon is but i do concern myself about it
i shouted
if griffyn has found the pole i donot believe i can ever get over it
prebble was annoyed by my interruptions and jabbed his finger angrily into the symbol b
remember what i have already told you salis he flared
nobody will believe griyn found the pole even if he claims the honor
he canot proveit
his observations will be faulty anyhow would it be possible to take observations from a balloon traveling as fast as that one
the airship was the sport of the winds
is it possible that the winds carried griffyn to the pole
exercise reason salis
then you admit that our reasoning is to be trusted
i inquired
we are in a tropical clime
the frozen ice fields have been left behind us
the result of our calculations cannot be nipped by the
rost
i that were not the case why should i be qtraoglmo to work out a problem that has to do with our rescue from the lake
amuse yourself salis and leave me to my labors
professor said are in a land that is inhabited by people well advanced in the arts and sciences
what we see proves it
instead of wasting your energies trying to work out a trifling problem would it not be better to stroll off somewhere and look for some one who can tell us what we want to know
he was still annoyed still fretful
that equation had obsessed him and he was not to be drawn aw ay from it
one thing at a time he answered
let us meet our problems as they come to us
we are sure of the present but we cannot predicate certain of the future
if you have business any place else salis donot let me detain you a moment
he waved his hand to command silence
in disgust i turned from him and searched the distance with wondering eyes
fortune had been extremely kind to the professor and me there was no gainsaying that
cut joose from the balloon by the murderous hand of griffyn we had from space
apparently our lines had fallen in pleasant places
i say apparently for presently something happened which proved our position was not so secure as i had imagined
a sound reached my earsa sound as of a stealthy movement
i whirled on the professor
he had not left his kneeling posture but was gabbling to himself and oblivious of everything but his foolish problem and behind him good heavens
what i saw behind the professor stealing upon him with deadly intent was a figure such as i had never before encountered outside of a hideous nightmare
seven feet the figure stood if it stood an inch it walked upright and bore a striking resemblance to man having two arms two legs a head and features more or less human
but it was covered from top to toe with a fine reddish hair the hair of the scalp long and flow mg about the shoulders save for a bearskin twisted around its middle the monster was entirely nude
how its eyes snappgd and glowed in the furry recesses of its face
and as it stole toward the professor with catlike tread it raised a long spear with a shimmering point poising the weapon
i tried to shout a warning but my tongue clove to the roof of my mough
i tried again and this time i managed to gurgle incoherently
the professor peered in my direction
i fluttered a hand toward the impending danger and he turned around
ha he gasped
missing link
speech returned to me
with it came the thought that unless i put the professors peril into terms he could instantly comprehend he was lost is the missing link i cried b is the spear and is yourself
a divides itself from b goes into and is what becomes of prebble
he gave a yell of horror and
fell flat
chug
as he dropped the spear flashed through the air above his head and buried its point in the sand
this danger had hurled itself upon us with paralyzing suddenness
i had succeeded in mastering my nerves however and was able to deal actively with the situation
in a twinkling i sprang for the spear jerked it from the ground and balanced it in my hand as i faced the hairy demon kill him captaindonot cried prebble excitedly
really hes a most remarkable specimen and we must take him back with us
the thing crouched in front of us eyes burnmg like twin coals and muscles working with an itch to spring a gigantic gorilla
i declared
nonsense returned prebble as much above the gorilla as it is below man
it thinks were paoan gods and was bent on testing our mvulnerability
careful what vou do captain
it completes the darwinian chain darwinian fiddlesticks i cut in out of patience
calm yourself sir
tortune favored us when we were cut loose from the balloon
we fell into that lake and this creature must have pulled us out
if it had wanted to slay us why didnot it do so while we were unconscious and entirely at its mercy
observe captain
prebble got up and looked the hairy monster in the eye hungry he said making motions with his hands and jaws as though eating famished
what kind of a pagan god do you imagine it will think vou if it finds you are hungry demanded so said the professor
your lucubrations captain occasionally evolve something that is particularly apt
just then the monster roared aloud
the mighty sound went echoing through the grove and was answered in kind from a dozen different points
we are undone
i groaned as a whole pack of the fiends appeared and raced toward us in full cry from every quarter
i was not blind to the incongruity of the situa tion
although no judge of art i knew full well that the colossus in the center of the lake was beyond the craft of these halfnaked creatures whose facial angles were small improvement on those of the orangutan
granted that these man brutes were subjects of a ruling race where were the real lords of the country or some one in authority to whom we could make appeal
prebble and i were face to face with death in a most horrible form
the red demons were rushing upon us snarling and yelping like so many bloodhounds their spears leveled and ready to impale us
we could not take to trees for the attacking force was between us and the grove
nor could we retreat for the lake lay behind us
our doom was sealed
i felt it in every fiber yet i would not shame the glorious traditions ofthe american sailor by standing supinely and allowing myself to be speared
the last ditch for me
gripping the haft of my sevenfoot lance i held it at attention
considering that the world was to lose an exhaustive paper on the meteoric theory of the aurora and a thesis on the missing link prebble carried himself admirably
thirty seconds of life captain said he they are getting ready to thiow
only one of them is to throw said look
that hulkig imp with the rings in his ears is to have the first cast
see him rise on one foot he throws himself backhe lets the spear y i watched every faculty whetted to abnormal keenness
the weapon darted toward us its bright point cleaving the air like a jet of fire
i struck at it wildly
fate was kind and i countered the shaft swerving it sideways and sending it hissing into the waters of the lake
the fatal moment was postponed that was all
clenching my teeth i waited for the next enemy to step to the front and make a trial
captain quavered the professor clutching my arm convulsively have this forgotten about it a revolver
prebble was holding it out to me in his shaking hand
a shout escaped me liging down the spear i clutched the firearm and before a second savage could launch a shaft i had fired
the effect of that shot was tremendous
the bullet did not find a markmy nerves were not steady enough for accurate shootingbut the report was allsufficient of the uncanny creatures fell face downward and lay groveling on the earth now prebble cried sharply run for your life
the woodsthe woods
we started and had almost gained the shelter of the trees when a second detachment of the enemy appeared before us
i presented the revolver and pulled the trigger but only an omi rnious click followed
again and again i tried but without success the cylinder was empty
togmlfchaqua pura mixed with the ammumtion said the professor sagely
thar hath in the lake must have disabled the firearm a wonder captain that you were able to fire even a single shot
a very pretty problem suggests itself and i
look
i cried interrupting his idle chattbr in a frenzy elevating their spear points be dead men in a dozen ticks of the watch unless we can do something to save ourselves am at the end of my resources declared the professor calmly
but i was not
an idea flashed over me and i began pufting it into execution without delziy
with a hop skip and jump i started a grotesque dance hopping up and down waving my arms and grimacing as horribly as i knew how
the professor watched me in a sort of fascination
i saw wonder in his face and then dismay and something very like anguish
but i also saw the lifted spears of the red rabble poise motionless in midair
that was the result for which i was working and i redoubled my exertions screamed prebble was afraid of this
i knew you were unbalanced
i knew your mind was trending toward this deplorable condition but i had not expected such violence
get busy prebble
i panted pirouetting on my toes and throwing off a small cascade of water as i whirled
my poor friend wailed prebble clasping his hands and striking an attitude of extreme dejection
go to it
pffed showing off a few buckandwing steps a pair of dancing dervishes prebble
reel it off manreel it off
the spears still hung motionless in the air
i had the hairy monsters guessing for my contoetions were making a powerful appeal to their aboriginal minds
the professor hurried toward me and laid an imploring hand on my arm
if we must die captain salis he begged let us go decently and as becomes intelligent men be an idiot
i flung back you see that doing this for a purpose purpose the professor answered
what purpose can such crazy antics serve resemble a coupie of pincushions by now prebble if i hadnot started this fandangd
the words were fairly jolted ouit of me as i tottered around first on one foot and then on the other seen this trick worked on the incians
all barbarians particularly those who are low in the human scale have a sperstitious eration for persons who are crazy
the idea popped into my head and i began to carry it out
you see what an effect it is having
our enemies had now dropped their spear points and were gazing at us curiously
they imagine remarked the professor studying the savages with a gooddeal of interest you are some sort of an evil deity donot care what they imagine said just so they keep their distance and donot use their spears
how long do you think you can keep that up donot know i answered hoping i can keep it up until somethingor other happens to insure our safety indenitely
the professor was showig no disposition to join me in the dance
it was only when the savages executed a movement en masse toward the right and lifted their spears for a throw at him that he leaped into terpsichorean effort
he required no ufging from me
he was quick to perceive the danger and equally quick toresont to the only means for averting it
round and round we whirled exemplifying everything from a double shuffle to hornpipe and a highland fling
this is monstrous wailed the protessor stepping high
what a performance for a man of my professional standing
salis have never felt more humiliated in my life
keep it up
i begged of him hoarsely
when you give out and have to drop feign a fit
if you do it well it may save you
at that moment when the spears were again lifted the savages who had been routedpear the lake by the report of the revolver came war ily upon the scene
by a wide detour they avoided us and joined the ones who were threatening us be something doing now gasped hoarsely savages who just came will tell the others about the report of the revolver said prebble hopefully and that will so awe those who are hostile that we will be spared and allowed to go in peace
but the professor was wrong
instead of the late comers inspiring fear in their comrades by telling of the exploding firearm the other side seemed to get the best of the argument
both parties presented a united front what was worse our exhibition of fancy dancing seerped to have lost its charm
the hostility wheezed the professor to have become general
all hands are making ready to comc at us i whispered to be done salis
can we run useless
spears would lay us low before we had taken a dozen leaps toward the sky line might as well stop this foolish dancing
yes and we both staggered to a stop like tops that have all but run down
i faced the desperate situation with all the fortitude i could muster
die like a man prebble i gasped all we can do now
another moment and we should have fallen pierced by half a dozen spears but the unexpected happened
out from the shadows of the palm trees glided a form jn white halted between us and the threatening spear points and raised one hand commandingly
instantly every spear point dropped and the form in white turned slowly and surveyed us
our protector was a woman
her delicate features the shelllike tint of her cheeks her long sunny hair her graceful form all testified to that
she was clad in a clinging robe of white edged with gold galloon buskins of white and gold covered her small feet and around her brows was a gold ribbon
she wore no head covering and her wealth of yellow tresses flowed about hern like a veil even to her waist
never had i beheld such rare loveliness and twenty years of sea had not blunted my appreciation of the divine in woman
an exclamation of astonishment and admiration fell from my lips
nor was the astonishment all on our part
surprise and wonder were mirrored in the womans wide blue eyes
although thankful for her timely intervention i would have had my meeting with her occur unaer ippier auspices
a young was but be particular how he comes under the eye of beauty and my watersoaked clothes and disheveled appearance made my position most embarrassing
prebble did not seem to mind it he was smirking and rubbing his hands and pushmg himself forward in a way that irritated me
thank you kindly said he bobbing his head and flashing his bald pate in her eyes the owner of these beautiful grounds madam our language was not hers
she stared at the professor blankly and then shifted her gaze to me
she smiled
small wonder she smiled with my learned companion ogling and ducking and making a display of himself hungry whimpered the professor conveying imaginary things to his mouth and working his jaws famished he turned to me with an unwonted lusterin his eyes
we canot deceive her into thinking we are pagan gods he imparted
this is paradise captain and she is one of the peri
stop your tomfoolery said petulantly
your spectacles are hanging from one of your ears one of your mukluks is gone and you look as though you had been through a cyclone laughing at you
at us he tittered
both of your mukluks are gone captain and i did not hear the rest
looking down i discovered to my horror that my feet were bare and never before had they seemed so large or so out of place
i reddened to the roots of my hair
a sailor and a gentleman may be excused i trust
she spoke to us her voice like a flowing rill rippling musical
but her words
they were as much beyond us as ours were beyond her
when she ceased speaking there was silence looked perhaps what i could not say for she vouclisafed another smile turned to the hairy ones behind her and addressed them imperiously
she vanished then vanished whither she had come
i gazed after her with eyes that spoke what my lips dared not utter if they could
the fiends stole up to us fawningly making signs indicative of good will as well as suggesting that we go with them
we heeded the mute request and were led off through the grove in the direction taken by the lady our lady of hope and deliverance
behind us trooped the other detachment of missing links equally harmless and equally desirous of showing the amicable turn their feelings had taken
where are we professor
i asked for the third time
we have fallen said he upon some uncharted isle in the tropics
you are telemachus i am mentor the maid is circe
beware captain
folly
do you mean to say that we were carried on the anchor of balloon from above the arctic circle to below the tropic of cancer
how else do you account for the flowers the palms the balmy atmosphere
we are castaways captain and our lines it seems have fallen in pleasant places
i marveled
yet how else could we explain the surroundings in which we found ourselves
presently we came upon a vista which seemed cut bodily from the thousand and one nights
a palace arose before us a palace with domes and towers of purest white outlined against the blue sky
a great flight of marble steps led upward to the facade of the building
on either side of the first sfep stood two stalwart warriors on guard
such a magnificent building murmured prebble
there must be something to eat inside of it captain
that is my hope said and the quicker we fall to the better am growing weak in the knees
at the foot of the grand stairway a man appeared as if by magic
evidently he had been informed of our coming and was expecting us
ile was of normal height and wore a white tunie edged with silver
his head was uncovered and his forehead and short vellow hair were spanned with a silver ribbon his face was highbrowed and almost of grecian contour
his eyes were blue as were those of the young woman and as they rested on me a peculiar sensation sped along every nerve
mentality was the keynote of the mans eyes
the powers of his mind were extraordinary and were reflected in his glance in a manner most strange and incomprehensible
not being versed in psychology i could not explain this visual force
i merely realized that the eyes of this startling individual usurped the office of lips and tongue speaking a language and compelling obedience
without a spoken word the man turned on the hairy creatures who had conducted us to the palace
they quailed under his look shivered and slunk away
then he flashed an order to us
the next moment he was ascending the steps prebble and i at his heels
whether it was the hypnotism of the mans eyes or a weakness caused by hunger ver my brain grew dizzy i staggered rather than walked and had but faint recollection of events for some time
we were in a large room it seemed and more of the uncouth slaves were at work over us
in duc course we left this room and came out into another where there were strange plants and blossoms and couches covered with finest skins we reclined
slaves hovered about us giving us food out of silver dishes what we ate i do not know but the food whatever it was was piquant and delicious
with hunger finally appeased i felt in a mood for sleep but the professor was gartulous he sizhed with blissful content settline himself luxuriously upon his couch this is paradise this is the abode of the blest tor one am very much obliged to griffyn for cutting us clear of his balloon
he will answer for that
i scowled allowing a spasm of righteous wrath to cross my contentment
will he so mv dear captain chuckled prebble
where and when if i may ask
where
i snapped
why where else can i pillory him save in his own country which his unprofessional conduct has disgraced
and when you ask
as to that prebble i promise you it shall happen directly we return to civilization
return to civilization have alreadyreturned to civilization captain
ever since we dropped from the balloon we have seen all around us evidences of a most civilized and progressive people
you quibble sald with strong dlsapproval it does not fit your character professor
you understand what i mean
we have here a very high grade of civilization it seems but what i had in mind was a return to our own country
and when will that be he asked in the dark as to that presume however that we have only to describe our situation to the people in authority here in order to be assisted to a home port
he cackled
there was something in that jaugh of his which always ruffled my nerves the wrong way
what is there humorous about that
i demanded fancy he replied that you are building your hopes on a very insecure foundation
the rulers of this most delightful land may have other plans for us
they may not lend us their assistance as you so fondly imagine
certainly i returned they must have compassion upon us
people so artistic and so progressive must have hearts to be touched by our forlorn situation
they are a rich people and a rich and cultured people are always generous
they may not be able to help us however
why not
prebble loved disputation for its own sake
he was not always to be taken seriously when he grew arguinentative am fairly well acquainted with the charted portions of the seven seas he went on and i have read extensively along the lines of anthropology and kindred sciences but i find it impossible to identify those hairy monsters who came so near proving our undoing or these whiterobed demigods who came to our rescue
nor have i the least idea what country this is or where it can be situated
if wvisited before it certainly must have been written about
there is nothing in literature however that touches upon this favored country
of that am positive
do you incline to the belief that we made an abnormal southing while on the anchor of that balloon
you doubted it when i mentioned the matter by the lake and then on our way to this palace you seemed to swerve and incline to my original opinion
but my own ideas had undercrone a change
it was physically impossible for us to be carried so far south said he after a little reflection
we are in a tropic land tropic land under the arctic circle paradox i grant you
yet we must helieve the evidence of our senses and predicate equatorial regions here or else we must doubt the evidence altogether and fall back upon the assumption that we are non cou pos and are not to place any credence in what we see or feel or hear
bah said l rather incline to the theory he proceeded unmoved by my disgusted retort we are under the spell of the purple snows
it is very possible that we are btlll on the ice cap in the sleeping bag far gone with hunger and freezing slowly
our minds are benumbed save for a few of its faculties which appear to be abnormally alert
this astounding theory quite took my breath
noensense
i exclaimed as soon as i was able to express myself suppose you had been immpaled by that spear down by the lake
that was not an imaginative spear prebble and you would not have died an mmaginative death
to drop into the vernacular he smiled my frozen finish would merely have been symbolized by that spear
what we are apparently underit seems to me is merely symbolical and you think were asleep
if we are it would be difficult to awake in a pleasanter paradise than this
for one captain i am not particular whether we ever leave this abode of bliss or not
how about your meteoric theory of the aurora it will be a distinct loss to science if that is never enunciated he answered with a dash of disappointment he brightenedif you fail to qualify with your newspapers and magazines and the lecture platform i believe i should be able to bear with my own disappoint ments my principal reason for returning to my own country just now said i firmly is to enlighten the arctic club and the world regarding griffyn
forget griffyn captain
his own safety seemed to demand that he cut us adrift
i am thankful that he released us from his balloon for otherwise we should not have visited this most lnterestlng country
i had a sufciency of his views however and while he talked on i went to sleep
i was awakened by a touch on the shoulder
starting up from the couch i encountered the yes of the man who had met us at the palace steps
the eyes bade me get up obeyed and caught a ghimpse of the professor in a tunic of white and silver with a silver ribbon snugly encircling his bald spot
at this i laughed immoderately but ceased when the face of our unknown friend turned on me in rebuke
the face was grave ominous and i read disaster in its every line
commanded by a look prebble and i trailed after our guide to an archway hung with arras in cloth of gold
the curtains were parted by invisible hands and we passed through into an immense apartment our eyes dazzled with a scene ofgorgeousness i shall never forget
yellow and white and blood red were the prevailing colors of vaulted roof lofty walls and tessellated floor
the gleam of gold was above us the sheen of silver on all sides and our buskined feet trod tiles of jasper
in front of us at the farther end of the vast room was a throne with a crimson canopy
un der the canopy sat a man clad in the prevailing white and silver and wearing a crown that flashed with jewels
on the topmost step of the short flight leading to the dais sat a regal figure in white and gold
i rubbed my bewildered eyes for unless they deceived me this was she who had saved us at the lake
the room was thronged with people in white and silver and white and gold and a lane had been opened for us up to the very steps of the throne
rays of sun entering through windows in the eastern wall struck the tiles and threw wondrous patches of scarlet over the whiteclad groups
amid all this bewildering scene the mind of prebble was amalytically at work
i could hear him mutter the women wear the gold and the men wear the silver
how does it come that an island so rich with inhabitants of such intellectual power has never been heard of by the outside ordp captain well breathed softly
they still think were pagan deities
we have been robed in the costume of the country and you with your black hair and dark eyes look well enough although a trifle out of place stand there like a dazed imbecile
throw dignity into your bearing
watch me
he adjusted his spectacles folded his arms across his narrow chest and peered about him with lofty disdain
but he was not of a size to foster an impression of haughtiness
as we stood there cynosures for all eyes two between them they carried our old sleeping bag and laid it on the floor before the throne
the man who had taken us in hand advanced kowtowed to his ruler and began to talk
they were words that came from his lips and that they had all to do with us was evident from the astounded looks that continued to be turned in our direction
when he had made an end he salaamed and stepped back
thereupon the young woman spoke to the king from her seat on the tep
her remarks finished the king himself indulged in a few words and the man who had brought us to the throne room gave his attention to the sleeping bag
our clothes were inside the bag and were brought out and duly exhibited
there was something else which our friend wanted and he got it by burying himsellfto the heels in the bag
as i live it was a quaft flask of whisky
look here prebble i growled in his ear did you have that flask all the while we were lost on the ice cap he mumbled
and you never said anything about it
i exclaimed fiercely
i tell you was saving it for emergencies
i was strongly tempted to lay hands on prebble but just then hands were laid on both of us and we were hurried up nearer the throne
the king rapped his scepter against the arm of the throne chair
a little man appeared a little man with luminous eyes and the nose and chin of a punchinello
in his hands he carried two metal circlets each crossed with a pair of thin metal bands bent into concave form
he seemed to understand what was wanied of him for after saluting the king he came to prebble and me and placed the contrivances upon our heads
they fitted the skull like a cap i trust that so far it has not been necessary for an officer and a gentleman to dwell upon his veracity
that i advert to it here is simply because i have reached a point where the readers credulity may receive its first shock
other shocks will follow and i wish to lighten the blows by a manly and straightforward statement
prebble and i had dropped in on a truly wonderful people
the skill they showed the arts they applied the highly developed mental processes that were theirs were the natural concomitants of a civilization marked at every turn by ways and means to us oftentimes inexplicable i am writing these experiences with painstaking care and if the reader will abide with me to the end i promisethat he shall not only be instructed and thrilled but convinced as well wa then for the first shock
the instant those metal caps were placed upon our heads prebble and i were put en rapport with these amazing beings
we could not only understand their speech but our tongues were endowed with it
strangers wherice come you demanded the king
prebble clapped his hands like a delighted schoolboy pulled off his metal cap looked at it gloatingly fondled it and then replaced it upon his shining pate
from a far country sir lic answered
what brought vou hither chance
and a drag rope i added mentally
are you from beyond the ice wall
prebble blinked in bewilderment do not understand your majesty said he
for once i happened to be a little quicker of comprehension
what is the latitude of this country sir i askud eagerly
the king nodded toward the little man with the hooked nose and chin degrees and forty minutes north said the little man
twenty minutes i gasped reeling against prebble
twenty minutes from the pole faltered prebble
what does this all mean
only twentythree miles from the goal of my hopes shouted only twentvthree miles from fame from the greatest discovery tie world has ever known
glory
i danced around like a wild man miles
i roared
tniles
i started at a run for the doorway anxious to leave the palace and race on foot over the twentythree miles that separated me from the spot it was my consuming desire to reach
prebble grabbed me but i kept on jerking him heels over head
the two hairy warriors then placed themselves in my way and i fought like a fiend to escape
there was the greatest disorder in the vast room
the king was on his feet and the court was in a tumult was fiercely my senses dazzled by my proximity to the pole
had i used my reason i might have questioned the reliable nature of the knowledge just given me for how could i be in a tropical region and yet only twentythree miles from the goal of myl ambition
but i was in no condition just then to reason about anything
i was wild with excitement
food and rest had revived my failing strength a straightcut blow from the shoulder dazed one of the hairy guards it only dazed him however
had he been endowed with ordinary physical powers it would have floored him
the fellow came back at me hissing like a wild eat
i saw his ponderous hand clench for a retaliating blow and his gigantic arm draw back
a shout from the king caused the second of the two guards to seize his companions arm before he could strike
this diversion seemed to leave the path clear for me and i turned to continue mry mad flight
a foot tripped me and i measured my length on the jasper tiles
before i could rise two bare knees were on my chest pinning me down and two hands were at my wrists holding me powerless
prebble white and apprehensive drew close
captain said he you are beside yourself
what folly
man man donot you know it is impossible to escape from this palace guarded as it is
even if you did manage to get outside in traversing the twentythree miles said to lie between you and the pole there wculd be ample opportunity to lay you by the heels
the whole country would be up in arms against you
i ceased struggling
that is quite true professor answered
my enthusiasm ran away with me
your enthusiasm came very near costing you your life
but the pole there is some wild guessing on the part of the gentleman with the hooked nose
reason tells us that the polar regions are choked with ice
there could be no summer weather such a short distance from the north pole
either that captain or we are in a realm of enchantment donot believe in enchantments i scoffed enough of this
get off me said to the giant on my chest and be tractable
the guard did not seem to comprehend
prebble picked up the helmet which i had dropped from my brows and replaced it
now tell him said he
by the aid of that marvelous ring hell be able to understand you
some of the nobles had advanced by that time and the hostile flash of their blue compelling eyes forced the warrior to arise and allow me to regain a more dlgmed attitude
i arranged my disordered tunic
the sallen guards placed themselves one on cach side of me and one of the nobles stepped close and spoke sharply
this said he most unseemly conduct for the throne room was carried away by the knowledge that was imparted to me i returned humbly am very sorry i caused any trouble
he is very impulsive put in prebble altogether too much so at times for his own good
but at least assure you barring a few little conceits and crochets he is a very agreeable fellow
his majesty deals very severely with any infraction of court etiquette went on the noblc unless you promise to be more circumspect in your behavior it will be necessary to put you in restraint do that vour lordship spoke up prebble in considerable agitation captainmeans well i assure you although now and then he has a poor way of showing it
i will stand sponsor for him
the flinty blue eyes of the noble withered the professor for a space
and who will be responsible for you he asked
prebble was usually sufficient unto himself and it was humorous to see him squirm and shrivel under the flash of the nobles blue orbs
in my own country answered the professor attempting a little dignity but with scant success my word is as good as my bond
prebble was measured with a swift glance and the noble turned away with a shadow of a smile is he laughing at me the professor whispered in my ear does he mean by that
your rings crooked said completely restored to my normal condition of mind and it doesnot enhance the dignity of your appearamnpe
better straighten it prebble afraid this outburst of yours capfan remarked prebble as he straightened the ring will inspire the king to harsh measures against us donot think much of him as a king if he allows his judgment to be swayed by a little natural exuberance on my part
you should have repressed yourself
the fellow in the skin robe is still blinking from the effects of that blow you dealt him
but for a remarkably thick skull i returned not now be able even to blink
the disorder had died away and a measure of courtly quiet once more prevailed
the king had seated himself and our guards obeying an imperial gesture returned prebble and me to the foot of the throne
for ages said his majesty our mythology has taught usto look for two fiends who wcre to drop from the sky and bring woe and ruin to my devoted kingdom
are you those arch fiends
answer
by this time i had recovered my wits
no sir replied we are not the fiends you are expecting
they are coming through the air on a strange ship and seem to be a little behind schedule but i assure you they will arrive all right
prebble whirled on me caught one of my hands and shook it heartily neatly done captain he whispered must beat griffyn to the pole i returned excitedly
if he comes down anywhere this side of latitude ninety i think that will block him
we will be on the lockout fiends you mention pursued his meanwhile as there seems to be no httle mystery surroundmg you two gentlemen i shall be under the pamful necessity of having you put to death
sire cried the young woman looking up at the king and holding out her hards appalingly
we started to enter a vigorous protest but the king waved his hand impatiently
princess ylma enough said he to the young woman sternly to us he added am deaf to your entreaties you have come as tradition says the demons were to come you act stranely and an ounce of prevention in this particular case is worth a pound of cure
the professor and i gazed at each other in wildest horror
for a space prebble dppeared to shrivel up then suddenly he expanded a forlorn hope flickering across his pallid face
springing to the heap of garments lying on the sleeping bag he picked up the flask and carried it to the edge of the dais
we are very great prophets in our own land king he averred glibly
behold the proof of our skill and he waved the bottle aloft
what is it asked the king
the elixir of life sire
drink and you will renew your youth
eagerly the king grasped at the flask
unwittingly prebble had touched a button that connected with his majestys dearest desire
beware your majesty cried voices
itmay be poison already the king had unscrewed the top
after hesitating a moment he smiled craftily
drink said he handing the flask to the professor
if it kills you
i will let it alone
prebble took a swallow from the flask
then i grabbed it away from him and took another
this satisfied the king
taking the flask from my hands he raised it to his lips and drank deeply
he was lost
as the fiery liquor went down an electric thrill sent the hot blood racing through his veins and he felt that the beginning of his rejuvenation was at hand
these are not the fiends who were to bring destruction to my kingdom he cried
these are my good friends
lord nylis they are in your chargetheir safety be upon your head
lodge them royally give them the best of everything
gadzooks but i feel a different man already
away with them lord nylis
and as for the rest of you depart from the presence
i would fain be alone with my elixir
again was there confusion
during the hubbub prebble and i were conducted from the throne room and from the palace by lord nylis
the flask of bourbon had saved us for the time being but at what a cost of danger to ourselves and vicissitudes to that devoted kingdom forty eightynine forty i kept repeating to myself as the professor and i followed lord nylis down the grand stairway of the palace could think of nothing but that the culmination of my earthly desires lay only twentythree miles away
this lord nyhs was the astute person who had engineered our entrance into the palace
at the foot of the marble steps he paused and looked toward the red warrior on the right
instantly the warriors spear rang thrice against his shield
that calls my oyd car explained his lordship
we are some distance from my palace and must ride
the metallic crash of spear on shield had brought me to myself
at his lordships mention of a conveyance an idea flashed through my mind
could we not ride to the pole
i asked eagerly
it is not far lord nylis and i particularly desire to reach the pole
he shook his head
it would be as much as our lives are worth he answered
a cold chill struck to my heart
what do you mean
i faltered
the pole is in the land of the churs he went on
they are brutes like these he indicated the guards to right and left of the palace steps but they are not under our domination of the churs we have brought to submission b will power alone and they are everywhere throughout the kingdom serving as soidieysand menials
the churs at the pole however are wild and ferocious
we never encroach upon their territory unless in quest of slaves
ah here is the oyd car
mount genemgn
the vehicle now drawn up before us was a queer bit of mechanism
the bed of it was dia tondshaped and had a large wheel
at each side and smaller ones at the points front and rear
aeross the middle was thrown a very wide seat and there was another narrow one occupied by a shaggy chur in the front point
home klimon said lord nyls
klimon bent over asquare box and slightly raised a cover at the same time manipulating a lever on his left
at once we glided and noiselessly ran point foremost what furnished the motive power the professor was first with a question on this head is the powr that drives this vehicle your lordship
we call it oyd answered the noble
it drives all the machinery in the kingdom
oyd muttered the professor know about everything worth knowing but somehow that has me
will you explain
the force is magnetic was the answer
there is a mineral which we delve from deep in the ground and call zellin
the whirling of the earth creates a friction which makes of the north pole a tremendously powerful loadstone so that it attracts every particle of zellin on the surface of the kingdomand it attracts only zellin and nothing else see said the professor sagely
you have a piece of zellin in that box on the forward point of the carriage
yes
that box is a nonmagnetic screen and when it covers the cube of zellin the oyd power is shut off
but the instant the front of the screen is raised the attracting force sets in and we move
most remarkable cried prebble
the amount of power is regulated by lifting the front of the screenr exactly
if the front is raised onethird the oyd force or attraction is only onethird but raised onehalf the attraction is onehalf the power of the zellin cube and so on
hence we proceed at a slow pace at a run or with the full power of the cube we all but fly
prebble struck his hands together in ecstasy
how large is the cube your lordship he asked
this car is fitted with a twelveinch block which is a power
a sixinch cube would be a twelveman power a tenty fourinch cube would be a power and so on
is the force of the polar attraction always the same
always
and always attracts due north the attraction is continually toward the pole
how are you able to proceed in anything but a straight line lever on left conneets with the wheel at the rear point
the turning of that wheel acts as a rudder and steers us easterly or westerly
beautiful beautiful
but if you wish to go south directly away from the pole
your rudder couldnot help you to move in that direction
certainly not
when we wish to go southward we make use of the suboyd power
what is that pray
do you not know that there is another magnetic pole
the other is simply a focus of magnetic power and is the one that attracts the needle of the mariners compass ah yes murmured prebble
that pole is located in seventyone north and ninetysix west
it is the source of our suboyd power resumed his lordship
there is another screened box under feet incloses a cube of soft iron
if we wish to travel due south or in any direction east or west by south the cube of zellin is scr eened entlrely and the cube of iron is switched forward on a movable arm
the ratio of power in the suboyd cube is the same as in the oyd bldck how beautifully nature has cared for you in this delightful country chirruped the professor
beyond the ice wall we know nothmg of the oyd or suboyd powers
the force that attracts your cube of soft iron is barely sufficient to sway our magnetlc needle
how do you explain the difference in the power of your country and ours donot explain it said lord nylis
it is one of inscrutable laws
we were traveling swiftly over awellpaved road
the breath of june was in the air green groves and flowerstrewn meadows stretched on both sides of us and as we journeyed i caught glimpses of strangelooking houses half hidden by the trees
the people we passed or who came down to the roadway to look at us were all of a kind with the men and women we had already seen albeit of lower station
but i saw none of them at work
the country blossomed as the rose yet no yellowhaired laborers were in the fields
i asked lord nylis about this
we labor with the mind not with the hands he replied
what the oyd and suboyd force cannot accomplish the churs take care of
my brain was overwhelmed with all this riot of new sensations and unheurdof conditions and i had been dropped into a country as different from our own as our minds could conceive
there were a thousand and one questions wanted to ask but their very multitude appalled and silenced me
i thought of the pole and in spite of the savage churs i determined to reach it just as soon as i had familiarized myself somewhat with the ways of the country and could plan intelligently
certainly if i could not get to the pole griffyn would not be able to do so
from the pole my thoughts wndgred to the princess yima
her lovely face was before me the rich cadences of her voice in my ears
ah if fortune would be kind to me
tl could win her and carry her back to my own country and my own came to myself with a guilty start
what crazy notion had taken possession of me thag i should raise my eyes to a princess of the blood
i tried to banish her from my thoughts but her entrancing features and dulcet voice would nof allow themselves to be ignored
i recalled the smile she gave me and then i recalled my missing mukluks and turned toward my two companions
prebble was just asking for a test of speedhe wanted to see how fast the oyd car could run
full power klimon
said lord nylis
the chur opened the screen to its full extent and the carriage leaped away like a bullet from a gun clung to the professor and the professor clung to me
houses people trees passed so swiftly that they danced on the sight in blurring lines
finally we slowed down by degrees and came to a halt in front of his lordships palace
thank heaven
i exclaimed
hurrah for the oyd power cried the professor beside himself
the most wonderful power on earth it is the making of the kingdom remarked lord nylis as he descended
follow me gentlemen this palace as was fitting was much smaller and less ornate than the one we had just quitted
still it was a gem in its way
on a terrace amid flowers and shrubbery and splashing fountains we reclined at length on couches spread with downy robes of fur
the heat was such that the shade of the terrace was most refreshing
if i had had a cigar or a pipe i would have been in a seventh heaven
lord nylis having made us as comfortable as he could in the circumstances excused himself for a space
prebble peered at me as one in a daze
he started to speak then checked himself as though he dared not trust his wonder to words
out with it professor said i languidly
what problem is bothering you just now one problem captain but ahundred problems sighed prebble all atsea over this astounding adventure
frozen fancies
i laughed dreaming itall still on the ice cap in the sleeping bag hope not i hope not he mumbled
all these experiences with things new and before untried are too interesting to be pased with any explanation of that sort
of all the remarkable objects we have so far beheld he removed the glittering circlet from his browseasily carries off the palm
i wonder norw and he frowned as his wits began working if we think in an alien language as well as talk in it
does this ring exercise a power over our intellect to such an unheardof degree is too pleasant an hour to be disturbed with riddles past our solving i broke in
suppose we consider a mistake we have madea mistake into which i was led by yourself
he lifted his brows
what mistake he inquired
when the anchor picked us oft the ice cap i explained you asserted that it was carrying us south and that the balloon was coming out of the north
that seemed a proper inference captain before we were informed of our proximity to the pole while in the throne room
even at this moment am inclined to take the information imparted by that hooknosed gentleman with a grain of salt
however in a country of so many wonders perhaps it is not well to doubt anything
if griffyn had come irom the north i went on there was another proper inference that he had come from the pole perhaps had discovered it
prebble replaced the ring and nodded to signify that he was following me
we have now proofk i continued that griffyn was going north when he snatched us off the ice cap we both tacitly realized and acknowledged that error in our audience with the king said the professor
he chuckled
the ruler of this delightful country told us that two fiends were to drop out of the skies and bring trouble
you very brilliantly informed his majesty that the fiends were none other than griffyn and his companion in the balloon
admirable
that was indeed a happy inspiration if griffyn and his friend will only come down and let themselves be discovered i fancy the king will have confidence in your assertion
that captain will mean continued safety for us
but i returned suppose the balloon comes down among the churs
that take it would prove a coup de grdce for the englishmen hope it wonot happen said are you relenting toward griffyn queried prebble somewhat surprised canot find it in my heart i answered to wish him ill to that extent
think of the spears which we so narrowly escaped and i shuddered have a welldefined impression observed prebble after a little reflection that we shall presently be put to it to look after ourselves so we may just as well cease worrying about the fate that is to overtake griffyn
aye was my answer we have bought our lives at the price of a flask of bourbon
no good can come of such a transaction and i felt moody and apprehensive have been expecting applause from you on the score of that flask of bourbon said prebble a little hurt
you turned a point concerning griffyn and his fellow voyager being the expected fiends and i shook hands with you anderwell gloated
now you rebuke me ifor turning a point with the whisky
not at all i hastened to answer
you saved our lives and i appreciate your resourcefulness even though i overlook the selfish manner in which you stowed away thatflask while we were on the ice cap
a flask and a revolver
i knew nothing about these my friend
each has done its part in preserving us captain
the end therefore has justified the meauns
let it pass
the oyd and suboyd powers are much in my mind here we have subtle forces fully controlled and made to perform the will of man
the people of this land have invented them selves into that blissfulstate where labor is unnecessary
by sheer force of the intellect they conquer and hold in subjection the churs and make the hairy savages do menial service
the life of the ruling race seems to be a life of enjoyment
which is not and can never be a successful life i declared
the dignity of labor is needed to round out the lives of this ruling race
if this situation has continued for any length of time then something is due to happen
captain agreed prebble you are probably correct
but after our wearing struggles with the ice a period of idleness affords a most refreshing prospect
i nodded
but said prebble growing disputatious although the rulers of this land do not work with their hands let us not suppose that they are idle
their minds must be busy
and such minds
the mental effort necessary to keep the enslaved churs under subjection must be enormous
at that moment lord nylis returned and seated himself on a couch beside us
what is the name of this country your lordship i asked
we call it nyll he answered
and what is the name of the reigning house
boazar
boazar is now on the throne
has he many children
i was slowly working up to the subject that was becoming as dear to my heart as the discovery of the pole
one only the princess ylma
his lordships voice saddened as he added with a gloomy shake of the head poor princess ylma
i roused to inquire why the princess yima should be the object of his commiseration when prebble broke in ahead of me with a question on an altogether different matter
whence comes this heat lord nylis
you have the sun here for six at a time but it does no furnish sufficient caloric fora climate like this
the friction of the earth in its rotation around the pole generates the heat his lordship explained
but the pole is figurative demurred the professor
the earth can cause no friction in turning around a figurative axis
the axis is not figurative
the pole i5 a real one
of course it is said what do you think looking for prebble
he turned his head and blinked at me through his glasses learning things captain salis said he that no two men outside of nyll ever learned before
he pressed one hand to his temples
merciful powers my head is splitting
this is morning isnot it lord nylis yes replied his lordship the morning of the long day
when do you dine inquired prebble moistening his lips with his tongue and thinking no doubt of the good things we had had at the palace of king boazar
in two weeks and three days said lord nylis
i was startled
prebble nearly fell off his couch
his lordship noticed our astonishment and added we eat but three times daily our custom in our own country i commented
but our days are six months long
i groaned
and you eat only once in two months asked
three months intervene between breakfast and dinner and dinner and supper
we sleep throughout the long nmight not a canot hibernate said preb ble rearing up on his elbows and looking at me
captain lets go home
although his frame was meager and showed no results of high living i yet knew that prebble was fond of his meals and something of an epicure
home
i exclaimed invent the flying machine professor and navigate it you do donot talk about home wasting your time
there there my friends put in lord nylis smilingly we shall not expect you to abide by our customs in this respect
eat when you feel like it sleep when you wish
you shall have the run of the larder and untrammeled use of the dormitory
the kings orders gentlemen humble roof is yours
many thanks your lordship said prebble himself again am a man of science but my stomach is my weak point believe that even by the way what do you drink in this glorious land water
nothing but water we have nothing else find water sufficient now i a glass ofof prebble was forgetting himself
had there been any alcoholic beverages in the kingdom that flask of bourbon would have been no novelty to the king
a glitter came into the eyes of our host and he rested a keen glance on my friend suppose said he that your elixir of life is the common beverage in the land from which you come prebble coughed
tt is not so plentiftil as to be what you might call common lord nylis said he
not he went on hastily that there is a scarcity of it
on the contrary it is to be found nearly everywhere but it is for the select few who are able it quibbling was carrying him into deep places
it was a subject moreover which made me uneasy
i attempted to shift the topic should like to know something more about this princess ylma lord nylis i remarked with assumed carelessness
he affected not to hear me
you he went on studying the professor attentively must surely be of the select few who are able to obtain the elixir
why yes replied prebble
as need manifested itself i have had my share of the potent fluid
i am a scientist however and know where to draw the line
now he went on with abrupt eagerness about this oyd force he was clearly as distrustful of the matter lord nylis was pressing as i was also he was seeking to give another turn to the conversation
his lordship however was not to be shaken
he clung to the subject relentlessly
as i covertly watched the eyes of our host an uncanny conviction that they were probing deeper than his tongue laid hold of me
what unplumbed depths lay at the back of his lordships penetrating glances
you informed the king lord nylis interrupted prebble to remark that you and your friend are very great prophets in your own land
the professor made a heroic effort to at ease and to meet the issue plausibly
exactly so he returned
my own prophetic line is scientific
the captains on the other hand is exploring
whenever he goes exploring he takes me along to furnish facts and figures to work out various problems to the elixir you claimed was a ptoof of your skill
i wished in my soul that something might happen to draw his lordship off
he was payingl out more than enough rope to entangle prebble and to trip him the less that elixir was discussed the better it would be for us
quite true asserted prebble with a panicky look in my direction
then scored lord nylis if you are a prophet if the elixir is a product of your skill and you know its virtues and make use of them why have you not renewed your own youth
prebble was silent
he showed his good sense by not plunging into some farfetched explanation that would give his lordship a chance to score again
and lord nylis turned to meis youth not a condition in much demand in your own country
is growing old so agreeable to those who live in your native land
the professor answered for me
perhaps he was even more afraid to trust me than he was to trust himself
gray hairs command respect said he and that is what our prophets demand more than youththe respect born of gray hairs and wisdom
this remark appeared to please lord nylis
the professor had touched his intellectual side where he was strongest
it seems then said he that your countrymen particularly your prophets reverence knowledge far more than they desire youth
that is the case your lordship
then why do you give such a proof of your skill to your people
if it is wise to grow old in years and wisdom even though you must die for it why cater to folly with a beverage which keeps people young all men do not think the same on a subject so broad as that coughed the professor no doubt wishing he had left his lordship to talk with me your elixir had a most remarkable effect upon the king was assured of that before i gave it to him his royal will was completely overturned
the elixir is warranted to overturn the will of any one royal or otherwise
a troubled look as i thought crossed his lordships countenance
it must be exceedingly powerful he exclaimed hesitate to describe the elixirs full powers to you lord nylis
possibfy you would not believe me
i was glad the professor hesitated
the princess ylma i ventured saved us from the churs
naturally your lordship i should be glad to learn something about the young lady
the professor and i are deeply indebted to her and pardon me lord nylis interrupted but the marvelous powers of your elixir have quite captivated my fancy
and yet he frowned a little as he spoke have a premonition that it is not well for the people of this kingdom to renew their youth by means of your elixir
i feel my friends that i must go deeper into this subject
it is new and at this juncture there was an interruption
i drew a deep breath of satisfaction although certainly i should not have felt such profound relief had i known at the moment all that the interruption portended
suddenly there came to our ears a loud shout from the direction of the road
we sprang up in time to see a large oyd car with a dozen armed churs and one nyllite sweep up to the palace steps
the instant the car stopped the warriors and the man in charge of them leaped to the ground and rushed up to the terrace
in another instant prebble and i were surrounded
seize them commanded the nyllite who was captain of the kings guard
six spear points pricked my breast and six pairs of ferocious bloodshot eyes glared into mine the professor was also at bay in a precisely similar manner
count zylox what means this demanded the indignant lord nylis confronting the captain of the guard
the king is dying cried the count excitedly
dying echoed his lordship aghast
aye and through the madchinations of these foreign devils
woe woe to this land lord nylis
at this very instant king boazar is stretched out on the dais at the foot of the throne chair rolling his eyes gasping and chokingly endeavoring to give his final orders
what does he say queried his hortified lordship
we cannot understand his pitiful attempts at speech resfonded the tearful captain of the guard
whash mazzer it sounds like mazzer whash mazzer over and over agam ah this is a sorry day for our beloved country
our good king
the last of the boazars
he whirled furiously upon the churs who were thxeatemng prebble and me
bind the foreign devils he shrieked
their lives shall pay for this and a poor enough forfeit it is
out of the frying pan into the fire is a homely expression but it describes a situation which seemed to fit our case
the king was in no danger but had used his elixir too freely
yet how to convince count zylox of this before we were drawn and quartered
that was the question vou ever thought in your life captain salis think now cried the professor brushing the sweat from his forehead with a fold of his tunic
cords cords shouted count zylox
dind them
lord nylis i exclaimed we appeal to you
the king is in no danger
i swear it
danger repeated the captain of the guard
he lies like a log i tell you and his end is near
not so clamored the professor
that is the way the elixir works
did you not see me swallow it
and my friend there
if it had been poison we ourselves would be dead or dying
look out you relic of the stone age youre sticking me brushed aside a spear point that was making itself too keenly felt
what he says is true i averred
in a few hours the king will be himself again will not believe it was the fierce response of count zylox
rather than bother with binding them it would perhaps be as well for us to run them through not that spoke up lord nylis
the king has placed these gentlemen in my charge and i am responsible for them with my head
but the king is passing
he gentlemen say not
i yield up my guests only on the kings orders count zylox king is incapable of giving orders
he will issue them when he is capable
what if he dies
in that event i take my commands from princess ylma
count zylox was an exceedingly angry man
he stamped about the terrace in his buskins
my hospitality has taken a rathet grim turn count observed his lordship must request that you have your churs lower their weapons
and permit these foreign devils to escape cried the exasperated count
by no means
guard them until we have further news of the king
the count gnawed his under lip for a moment
then he said we will tarry three hours
by that time a courier from the palace will let us know whether the king lives or is dead
if he lives his wishes will be brought by the courier said lord nylis and shall be implicitly obeyed
and if he dies
if he dies these foreigners shall suffer death by oyd well said the count and gave orders that caused the churs to withdraw and marshal themselves in a column behind prebble and myself
i sat down on my couch and prebble sat down on his
this constant peril was most trying to the nerves for we never seemed ableto tell when the lightning was going to strike or how
this death by oyd murmured prebble what is it your lordship
if the king dies and the princess ylma so commands as she undoubtedly will in that event your feet will be securely bound to thefeetof your friend
a block of zellin properly screened will be chained to your wrists and a be chained to the wrists of your
the screens will then be by degrees
you will be pulled north your friend south
first a force equivalent to six men will drag at your limbs pulling against each other then twelve men then eighteen then the full twentyfour
it was awful to contempate the very fiendishness of it fairly sickened me
it is the punishment for high treason commented the count glowering at us
wait six hours instead of three implored prebble three heurs only snapped the count
how slowly the minutes dragged
surrounded and guarded to make sure that we did not escape prebble and i endeavored to compose our nerves was afraid of something like this professor said it would be rather a humorous situation said prebble if these nyllites werenot so ignorant
what a sight for godsand men to see king boazar prone upon the throne surrounded by his griefstricken court and only giving vent to hiccups and gurgles and the two mysterious words whash mazzer the professor forgot his own desperate situation so far as to cackle with suppressed merriment liable to be anything but a laughing matter for you and me prebble i admonished him
how can there be a tragedy
the king will come out of his trance and word will be sent to release us
suppose the court doctors get busy with the king
they donot understand what ails him and they may resort to heroic measures
he may suecumb to th measures but the clixir will be charged up with it and of course we are already charged up with the elixir
prebble looked worried something in that captain he fal tered wish we could get word to those doctors to keep their hands off
what good would it do us to get word to them
i inquired
do you think they would pay any attention to our wishes in the matter one way or the other
possibly not
certainly not not a doubt as to the position we occupy in the land of nyll
let us suppose said the professor that the kings case is not aggravated by the solicitude of his physicians
qur dangers will pass in that event
very likely providing these troublesome churs are not goaded into something violent by zylox
the captain of the guard was still tramping fretfully up and down itching to be at and yet not daring to override the instructions of the king count is in a hard row of stumps i went on to prebble give his eyes to see us impaled on the poings of those spears but if the king should recover the count would be called on to pay with his head for his rash actions
and lord nylis too added prebble
an execution by oyd he proceeded his thoughts taking a gruesome trend must be a particularly horrible performance
it has the electric chair beaten both ways said slowly but relentlessly a victim is pulled to pieces
a sickening pallor spread itself over the professors face
sitting upright on his couch he shaded his eyes with one hand and looked off along the road that led to the palace wonder why some one doesnot come from the king he worried
no one will come until the king either dies or recovers sufciently to tell his court that he has no intention of dying i answered
lord nylis observing that some of the churs were becbming rather overzealous in their guard duty placed himself closer to prebble and me
a single look which he threw at the hairy warriors dampened their vengeful ardor and they drew back
this condition of his majesty remarked his lordship turning to prebble seems an odd way of renewing youth
and yet you declare that the elixir works in that manner his majesty took too much of it said prebble
too much is dangerous not at all
too much merely stupefies
so the king is out of his senses
nothing worse has befallen him lord nylis i assure you
are there many court physicians dozen or more
do you suppose the whole dozen of them are working over the king
undoubtedly
prebble could not restrain a groan dozen doctors captain said he turning in my direction apt to cause tragic complicatlons the doctors just then were a prolific source of danger for the professor andme and second only to the doctors stood count zylox and the chur guard
the physicians will do everything possible spoke up lord nylis hoping no doubt to set us at our ease
could you not send word to the physicians returned prebble that all the king needs is to be let alone physicians i presume do not understand the kings malady said nylis but certainly they can do no harm
send word anyhow implored prebble
tell the messenger to annournce at the palace that the strangers guarantee the kings recovery but that the physicians must not mix up in the matter
if i did that and the king did not recover said lord nylis should be condemned to death myself
there was no use insisting and the minutes continued to drag
it seemed as though i had lived an age before my eyes eagerly scanning the road saw a small oyd car come flying to his lordships steps
one chur and one nyllite were the passengers
bounding to the ground the nyllite dashed up the slope toward us flashing the kings ring in his hand come from princess cried the courier
why the princess ylma
i asked myself
if the king was not dead why was the princess ylma assuming the prerogatives of government
what of the king demanded the count
he recovers told you so jubilated the professor
is he well asked the count
barring a headache
the lords in waiting are attending him
what says the princess ylmar that under no circumstances are the strangers to be injured
i began to breathe once more
prebble was again his cocksure and assertive self
the count came forward and i thought he looked like a man
he bowed to us humbly
pardon the disagreeable interruption said he
when i come again it will be by his majestys command
he gave orders to his churs and they defiled toward their oyd car
the messenger had already returned to his and was racing back whence he came presently the larger car got in motion and we were left alone with our genial host as before
prebble settling himself comfortably on his couch continued to delve for facts
regarding these churs said he are they animals pure and simple your lordship whether or not they have souls replied his lordship is a moot point
they have a certain amount of reason but are so brutelike that only our superior minds hold them in check
a commission of our wisest men appointed by the king is now making experiments to discover whether the churs are imbued with the immortal gpark
they are all slaves
every one outside the great wall
if they were not held down with a will of iron they would rebel and seek to overthrow us
fear alone keeps the horde of churs back of the great wall
if they once lost this fear they would swarm over the wall and lay this kingdom in ashes
wall queried the professor scenting another mystery
boazar of illustrious memory encircled the land of the churs with a great wall of granite
since then our minds have developed in power to an extent that gives us no fear of our traditional enemies
the only disaster that could befall us would be a dethronement of reason an eclipse of our faculties
this would vive the churs their opportunity here his lordship straightened proudly our brains continue to improve while the churs continue to sink into barbarism and brutality
some day we shall grow so strong that we can invade the country of the churs enslave them all and after that gradually train them and so better their condition
it is the dream of boazar one day to emancipate the slaves
but this will not come for many generations not until such an act is entirely safe
you speak of the churs as traditional cnemies they were here when lokai the bold broke throuch the ice wall and settled the land an event which took place in the night of prehistoric times
then the churs roamed through the sun of the long day and through the blackness of the long night fighting rending each other like beasts
lokai warred with them and drove them out with sword and spear
but sword and spear were useless against them
they multiplied amazingly and returned again and again to the attack
only the irresistible powers of the brain were efficacious and not until the descendants of lokai began to develop and use these latent powers was there any peace in the land
this is glorious murmured the professor
it is an ideal statea kingdom of the mind with the powers of darkness under heel
but heres a poiht your ancestor lokai the bold penetrated the ice wall
have your people never tried to reach the world whence he came
expedition after expedition has tried but in all save one instance without success
the cultivation of mental powers has ill prepared us to cope with the rigors of ice and cold
brute endurance is needed there
nevertheless in our own generation the ice has been successfully conquered by one gneiseti
he did not live to return butsent back a gort plate tied to an eagles leg
the gorr plate told us things of the outside world that have entirely wiped out all desire to know more about it
gorr plate exclaimed prebble deeper we go the thicker the mysteries
what in the name of all thats good is a gorr plate
it is a square of chalcedony a thought record
we wish to communicate with one another so we send thoughts and impressions not words
on the chalcedony square we place our hands we think the thoughts record themselves in the plate
the plate is sent to the one we would have know our wishes or experiences and he or she layshands on the plate and the thoughts of the communicant come to the brain
prebble jumped to his feet and walked around his couch
then he sat down again his head in his hands
have you one of these gorr plates in your pocket he inquired
lord nylis smiled
no but if i had it would be nothing but so much chalcedony to you
your mindpardon meis not cultivated along the proper lines
at thls implied doubt of his mentallty prebble bristled up
the next moment however the irritation passed
will you read this gorr plate sent home by gneisen he asked
tt js in the archives of the kings palace
but i have the gist of it in my mind
what were thoughts
horrible
he recordeei impressions of two things in particular that filled me with disgust and despair for the human race
one of these things was a thin silver disk with a womans head on one side and an eagle on the other
there was also a motto in god we trust
the desire to accumulate these fetiches was so strong that people did not hesitate to betray a trust bartering their honor and sometimes their lives for the insensateobjects there were those who had millions more of these than they needed and others who had not one
it was a mad race accordmg to gneisen and many of the weaker were crushed trampled on and slain
the professor looked at me and indulged in a sly wink
his lordship was on ground familiar to us but neither prebble nor i had anything to say
what was the other thing that filled you with disgust and despair lord nylis queried the professor
it was a brown fluid in glass receptacles went on his lordship fluid was even more insatiable in devouring honor and life than was the silver disk
it struck at the mind with sledgehammer blows according to gneisen making raving beasts of sensible men and finally brought horrible death
the wonder is that sensible men would have anything to do with it
do you know anything about this fluid believe i have heard of it mumbled the professor
talking about gorr plates is it possible to prebble thus deftly shifted the topic
the gorr platesi were wonderful enough but i was not particularly interested in them at that moment
my fancies flew to princess ylma
young beautiful only child of the reigning kingwhat could there be in such a fate to commend the piin8ess to his lordships commiseration
i resolved to find out
at that moment lord nylis was deep in an earnest discussion with prebble and while waiting for a chance to put in a word on my own account i fell asleep
how long i slept is of no importance
the period seemed brief but it may have been hours in duration i wakened abruptly and started to a sitting posture
his lordship was gone but on the couch nearest mine lay prebble count zylox standing over him
behind the count was the same detachment of soldiers that had accompanied him on his previous visit
the professor was just opening his eyes
you here again he exclaimed starting up and casting a quick glance at the forbidding faces of the churs
by the kings express command answered the count
how is his royal highness inquired prebble
he is feeling much better and desires that you refill this flask forthwith
the captain drew the bottle from the breast of his tunic and extended it toward prebble
his majesty must have more of your elixir within the hour
blockheads that we were
why had we not foreseen this contingency
still if we had foreseen it what could we have done to save ourselves
it is possible we could have stolen an oyd car given the zellin cube free reign and thus reached the pole
would we have bettered our condition by so doing
might not the savage churs have killed us out of hand
there was no time to waste in useless surmises
count zylox represented the king and the king meant business
mercy on us man gurgled the proiessor
do you think i carry a supply of the elixir around with me and have it constantly on tap
the count smiled sardonically think nothing at all
the king commands that i bring him the elixir within the hour
if you refuse to comply with his reasonable demand i am to convey you into the serene presence the point of a spear
as to which i do i am indifferent
zlox had educated his head at the expense of his heart
he had no kindly feeling for us and orders were orders old prebble
i see him now as i saw him then clasping his bony hands shaking as with an aue looking despairingly from the count to the file of churs
suddenly he sank back on the couch with a muffled groan his stony cyes uptdrned to the cloudless vault overhead
where is lord nylis
i struck in thinking our host might devise some way out of the difficulty
nylis can be of no assistance to you returned the officer frigidly
am i to have the elixir or am i not must consult privately with the other prophet my companion said prebble is a matter of some moment
have i your permission to engage my friend in a brief conversation escape is impossible warned count zylox sternly
lam a0t contemplating anything of that sort
very well
proceed with your conversation
the professor got up came over to my couch and sat down beside me
captain said he were you asleep or did you wake up in time to hear what was going on overheard it all i replied
well what are we to do in this case not a thing we can do so far as i can discover
the king has sent an ultimatum more elixir or death to the strangers
it was a mistake to tell the king that the bourbon was a product of our skill presume reflected prebble that the whisky could be distilled but it would take time
and the king is in a hurry got to fill the flask at once or suffer the consequences
then we must suffer the consequences said i chieerlessly
the professors problems were growing more and more difficult of solution
largely our present predicament was owing to the professors extravagant claims with respect to our powers as prophets
a prophet is not really a wizard and yet my learned companion in our conference with the king had rather implied that such was the case while count zylox watched warily from a distance and the barbarians of his guard stood ready to discorage any attempt at escape the professor puckered up his brows and turned the matter over in his mind
you might as well give up prebble said harass yourself with further posing
you canot conjure a demijohn of rum out of the air
tell zylox to do his worst
if we could secure another audience with the king returned prebble we might be able to do something that would postpone our fate deceive yourself
the king is thoroughly in earnest
when an appetite for bourbon is aroused you know how difficult it is to combat it donone better
the imperial appetite waits only upon the imperial will and the kings word is law
but captain perhaps if i told his majesty that a little time would be required to minister to his desires he would grant a stay of sentence that would only prolong the agony said and whats the use
while theres life theres hope
so long as we can keep from being spitted on the lances of the churs or from being drawn and quartered by oyd and suboyd i choose to believe that chances of ultimate escape will favor us
that may be
i am as anxious to live as you are prebble for the object of my lifelong ambition has been to attain the pole
now that we are so near the pole it seems too bad that chance and a flask of bourbon should conspire to disappoint me
suppose we could escape now murmured the professor with a wary glance at zylox and the churssuch a supposition is folly
i protested
no one knows what a man can do to save his life until he is put to the test
a rush an exchange of blows and a little of that fortune which favors the brave and the desperate might carry us to the road and the oyd car
then away captainaway with the screens torn from the cube of zellin and our speed an eagles flight
i stared at him in amazement
if my own action in seeking to escape from the throne room had been reckless and illconsidered present suggestion was even more so
you are out of your wits prebble said in the first place we could never get clear of this press of churs alive
take that for granted at the outset grant you this captain that it is a forlorn hope but better that than nohope at all
it is not even a forlorn hope went onseverely
suppose we reached the car therewould remain the operating of it
what do we know about that
we know what lord lls told us on the way here answered the professor confidently
all one has to do in driving an ovd car is to lift the screen and steer
admitting that we could escape from the guard and reach and successfully operate the car where are we to go
anywhere
safety lies in flight salis and where that flight takes us is not a particular point
yes it ismost particular
if we could get to the pole and fall into the hands of the churs
not that well i shall not join you in any such mad enterprise
if argument canot save us force certainly cannot
he got up and went back to his own couch
flinging himself down on his back he fixed his eyes thoughtfully upon the zenith
seeing that our interview had terminated the impatient zylox approached the professor
have you decided the count demanded am waiting to be moved in the business mumbled the professor
time presses returned zylox ask you am i to have the elixir or am i not
you are screeched prebble hurling himself to his feet told the king i was a great prophet and you shall see i am not without honor even in this country
obsrv
watch
i shall work a spell to fulfill the kings desire
ah ha
room there
give me room
they zave him room plenty of it
i feared that danger had suddenly turned the professors brain and that he had gone stark staring mad
he whooped he howled he threw himself inte the most amazing attitudes and fanned the air with his arms
i looked on horrified
count zylox gazed at the contortions of my learned friend in startled wonder
as for the churs their superstitious minds were imagining dire things and they seemed more than half inclined to run
suddenly the air above us was rent with a terrific explosion
simultaneously with the explo sion the heavens were lighted by a flash of reddish fire ghastly in the broad light of day
every eye turned aloft
a blazing balloon was dropping earthward like a lead plummet and following the airy track of the balloon at slower pace and with hairfaising gyrations was parachute two men were clinging to theparachute recognized one of them as my rival griffyn the other as pollock his secretary and companion
the burning balloon dropped into the roadway the wickerwork car loaded with food scientific instruments and other impedimenta striking the ground with a prodigious thump
griffyn and his companion alighted a moment later on the terrace and not more than a dozen feet from prebble
the englishmen were stunned by the shock and lay on the ground in a state of dazed bewilderment
without loss of a second prebble bounded to griffyn bent over him searched his pockets and arose triumphantly with a nickel plated flask
turning upon the astourtded captain of the guard prebble presented the flask with a low bow
the elixir is not in the same flask count said he but i do not think his majesty will be overparticular
it gives me great pleasure to comply with his majestys command
prebble was not mad on the contrary he wasj very levellleaded
but what would he have done if there had been no flask in the pockets of either griffyn or his secretary
the professor afterward told me that in falling backward on the couch the despairing gaze he turned upward had encountered the balioon
the airship was in difficulties plunging wildly and making ready to fall
griftyn and pollock were even then taking to the void with theirparachute
ideas came rapidly continued prebble for was between the churs and the deep sea so to speak and your life as well as mine hung in the balance
chances were that either griffyn or pollock had a flask and those were the chances i had to take
a special providence watches over children andand others captain and i got the flask
i think count zylox was deeply impressed
at any rate his hand trembled as he took the flask from prebble
the churs were flat on the ground face downward
it was their customary attitude when anything occurred which to them was supernatural
before the count entirely recovered or the churs arose griffyn was on his feet and had advanced to where i was standing
his face was vacuous his eyes staring knew me but it is one thing to cut a man from your balloon and launch him into eternity and another thing to meet him again front to front
finally he spoke but there was no sense to his words
i answered him and that he failed to understand me was evident from the blank lvok he wore haf was wrong
had i forgotten my mother tongue
remove the talk ring captain suggested prebble giving you english and youre giving him nyll
i removed the talk ring
while wearing it i thought in nyll talked in it and my own language was a dead letter
captain salis breathed griffyn
captain salis can i belive my eyes
you cast a brother mariner adrift in nudheaven said i cuttingly
no wonder you are surprised to meet me again alive and hearty
you took a base advantage of me he protested warmly
you attached yeurselves to the drag anchor in the hope of reaching the pole neck and neck with myself
rubbish exploded a sane man griffyn and you do not really think that prebble and i would do such a thing and run the risk of having our lives battered out against the top of some iceberg
he muttered in his beard
at last he observed we have been hovering over this country for hours driven back and forth by one current and then another
the intense heat or something else burst our balloon and the have no interest in your misadventures said i coldly
you cut us adrift and we were saved by a miracle only to find ourselves in the midst of a sea of dangers
it will be youlr business to share some of these dangers with us
pollock came up just then bursting with questions
but pollock was the kind of man i left out of my calculations
he was the son of a rich distiller i had been informed and his father had helped him to a place in expedition by subscribing twenty thousand pounds to the exploration fund
count zylox and prebble were holding an animated conversation and i donned my talk ring to take part in it
these are the two fiends spoken of in that tradition of yours count the wily professor was saying
take them back with you to the king keep them in confinement and watch them well
tt shall be done the count answered cheerfully
he was showing a good deal of respect for us since the professor had worked his spell
tell the king i put in that we request him not to deal with the prisoners in a summary manner
prebble threw a surprised look at me
he could not understand i suppose why i wished to spare the englishmen when they had shown no disposition to spare us will carry your message to the king said count zylox
thereupon he ordered the churs to make prisoners of griffyn and pollock but the englishmen set their shoulders together and prepared to resist
i had never doubted courage so i was not surprlsed to find him showing his teeth it begins to jook called the count to me as though these strangers would have to be roughly dealt with
would you care to speak with them and give them a little good advice know of no way in which you could serve them better will see what i can do said i
then removing the mystical ring from iy brows i stepped up in front of griffyn and pollock be rash griffyn i advised him are outnumbered and you have just come through a severe shaking up
by jove he cried brandishing his fists if these swabs are sickening for something well do our best to oblige them
what sort of a way is this to receive strangers be tactful and you will find these people hospitable and kind
resort to violence and you will let loose a storm that will break on your own head know because i have had some experience with the ways of the country
what sort of a country is it
really magnificentand something of a paradox
the inhabitants are wel advanced in the arts and sciences and the labor of the ruling race is entirely on the mental order
i havenot been here long enough to make any detailed explanations but i can assure you that a resort to fisticufls will not prosper vour cause
what have you in your hand there he asked surveying the object curiously
an example of the scientific progress we have found in this country i answered
this is a talk ring and talk ring he echoed wideeyed
precisely
by adjusting it properly am able to think in the language of the people and to talk to them and to understand them
what bally nonsense are you giving me am trying to tell you things which your incredulity will not allow you to believe said but for all that i am speaking the truth
he is put in the professor but he is wasting his time
count zylox in charge of the guard is going to take you and pollock alive or dead to the king of the country
salis out of a generous feeling toward you which is not warranted by your past behavior has volunteered to pursuade you to go with the count without resistance
if you are wise griffyn you will heed the advice of captain salis
salis has something at the back of his head declared griffyn suspiciously
what are you up to he flung at me pointblank
justified although i might be in acting and thinking otherwise i answered do not wish to see any harm come to you griffyn
you are trying to beat me out in coming at the pole
something tells me that you are playing the game even now
where do you think you are griffyn
i inquired
in what latitude and longitude havenot been able to take an observation for some time and i havenot the least idea said he
you will discover all about that and many other things of interest to you if you go peacefully with count zylox not he cried obstinately
here he added reaching out his hand let me take your talk ring
if it is all you say give this count a piece of my mind in short order
prebble looked at me and shook his head meant to signify that it would not be safe just then to make it possible for griffyn to converse understandingly with count zylox
griffyn might do other things besides giving the count a piece of his mind
for instance it would have been possible for him to give information that would be a detriment to prebble and me
i shall not allow you to sample the powers of my talk ring i answered
do you know what my impression is asked griffyn donot know as that matters materially but you may as well tell us
you and prebble are mad
as pollock and i came down onthe parachute we saw prebble throwing himself about in a crazy sort of way
why did he rob me of my flask
why did he hand it over to that fellow in the mother hubbard a black business afoot salis if it turns out that you and your friend are not mad
will you go peaceably
i asked to cut the conference short
we are going to fight to the last breath he averred
i put on the talk ring and stepped back
they wonot listen to reason count zylox said take them but do it carefully
again the count ordered his churs to make prisoners of griffyn and pollock
although they resisted like true dritons they were easily overcome and borne away
zylox would also have carried off the wreek of the balloon had not prebble vigorously objected
i could not imagine what prebble wanted with the remains of the airship
in du urse however his ideas were communicate to me and i found them particularly bright
the departure of zylox and th guard with the prisoners left prebble and me alone and to our own devices
during these momentous events lord nylis had not shown himself
nor had any one issued from the palace to make inquiries or to take part in the proceedings
the hour was ripe for something of moment to transpire and i was not kept long in suspense
now captain said prebble after a swift precautionary glance around us we must get to work without loss of time
at what sort of work
i inquired
you will find out presently
we must act first and then do our talking
he gathered up his tunic about his thin legs and put off down the terrace toward the road
i hurried along in his wake and omed him beside the wickerwork balloon car
nothing remained of the basket but a jumble of broken reeds
there was a water can knocked into a cocked hat and trickling its contents over the road also a number of scientific instruments a shotgun and cartridze lelt and a bag containing pemmican and ships biscuit
the scientific instruments were ruined but the bag of food was in good condition and the gun and ammunition appeared to be uninjured
bring the biscuit and pemmican captain said prebble taking possession of the firearm and belt stow these away where we can find them when wanted and then hold a council of war
the articles were hidden in a clump of bushes and we returned to our couches on the terrace
prebble was rubbing his hands delightedly counted on finding the food said he but the shotgun and the ammunition were a stroke of luck
just what we needed too thinking of making a run for it are you
i asked he returned looking around apprehensively
coming over to my couch he sat down beside me nothing else for it captain he proceeded am of your opinion i returned
our position here is becoming untenable he resumed
the king will want more of the elixir and if it is not forthcoming we will be impaled on the same spear and conveyed into the royal presence
we might have reasoned that out before said thought it but we needed time in which to recuperate after our long fast and to adjust ourselves to certain of the country
food and rest have prepared us physically and now that we are acquainted with the mechanism of the oyd car and are possessed of a shotgun and a bag of food we are well equipped for flight
we must have the car
cars are plentiful
we will lie in wait along the road then with the aid of the shotgun you can take possession of the first car that comes along
after that away to the south en route for home
to the south i exclaimed
certalnly we canot go astray captain
the cube of iron will draw us along the proper road
we will make in the direction of least resistance
good heavens
i ried you think the oyd car will carry us over the ice wall and the open sea how do we know there is an open sea as for the ice wall que transtulii sustinet
our good star is above us
south we must goit is the only way
it is not the only way
i declared
our hope lies in the zellin cube and we must go whither it takes us
to the land of the churs my dear sir palpitated prebble
we would be slaughtered on sight
have you not had sufficient experience with these man brutes
remember how superstitious the churs are i urged
the report of that revolver was enough to vanquish them and now we have a shotgun
think of that read you captain said the professor disgruntled
griffyn has arrived
your fear that he will reach the pole first impels you to take any chance however desperate
i go south sir
and i go north
i returned firmly
we will divide the pemmican and the ships hiscuit
and the shotgun he asked coolly
we will draw straws for the shotgun
you can get your own oyd car and i will we cannot quarrel over this matter interrupted prebble nor can we divide our slender force and resources in the face of such a desperate contingency
we must stand or falt together captain salis am in charge of the expedition said i sternly
when you joined it you agreed to obey orders
you are quite correct he answered was overlooking that point am resolved to bear away to the land of the churs
that is what we shall do
you are under my orders and you will obey whatever hist
his lordship
i looked up hastily
lord nylis was approaching us across the terrace
klimon in the road below was sitting in the point of his lordships conveyance gentlemen began lord nylis his face troubled the fame of your elixir has spread throughout the kingdom
to the lords in waiting his majesty has described its effects upon the system so eloquently that all are wild to try the new fluid for themselves
the second flask the king claims as his own to the last drop
but he orders you through me to work another spell for one thousand keeses of the elixir
if not too much trouble to you he desires that you have it fall at the palace steps
menials are already waiting there with goblets
my heart smote wildly against my ribs
had we been too late with our pilans for flight
how much is a keese your lordship
prebble inquired with a businesslike air two blicks make one keese
a blick i should say is about the quantity contained in the second flask
in other words said prebble briskly the king wants two thousand flasks of our elixir rained down in front of his palace
the menials arewaiting his lordship repeated and the kings household is impatient
we shall have to repair to the kings palace to make the incantation said prebble
while speaking he telegraphed me a message with his if we fled it must be now or never
whether north or south made little difference
the thing was to get away before the household grew too impatient imagined as much remarked his lordship gravely
if you gentlemen will descend to the oyd car will retire into the palace for ten minutes or less and rejoin you the moment i have finished the business that detains me
this is important or i should not delay
nothing could have been more opportune
his lordship went one way and prebble and i the other
the bag of food and the gun muttered prebble
we must have those before we go to the oyd car
proceeding to the clump of bushes we brought out the articles
as the executive end of the expedition i assumed charge of the gun and belt strapping the latter over my tunic about my waist
next we stole silently upon the oyd car
approaching the unconscious klimon from the rear i tumbled him incontinently into the road and jumped into his seat
prebble was already up behind
with the shotgun firmly held between my knees i bent over the power box and lifted the screen
away jumped the car with a suddenness that almost threw the professor into the road
and not an instant too soon
the dazed klimon had bounded to his feet and grabbed at the rear of the vehicle missing it by no more than a hairbreadth
he pursued us but he might as well have tried to overtake a whirlwind
we were heading for the land of the churs and for the north pole
all fear was lost in the excitement of the moment
my nerves were not so preyed upon that reason failed me and while bending over the zellin box one hand on the screen and the other on the steering lever i had a few thoughts pertinent to the situation
when we had left the kings palace klimon had used the zellin cube
that meant of course that we had proceeded in a northerly direction
to use the suboyd power as represented by the iron block would have been to drive back through the heart of the kingdom
flight in that direction meant undoubted capture
another pomnt i was not sufficiently familiar with oyd cars to distinguish the iron box from the zellin box
his lordships car however had just come from the kings palace
the zellin cube must have been used and therefor it was reasonable to infer that this cube was still ready for duty
i did not pull out the screen to its fullest extent and thus give the car the full power
we could easily distance klimon with half the oyd force and i wanted to accustom myself to running the machine before urging it to its utmost
the car was easily handled
the rear wheel was the rudder and its resistance was strong in moving any way short of due north
the feel of the tiller if i may be allowed the expression was an indication of the direction we were going
as i figured it we were headed north by east
suddenly i was startled out of my reflections
directly ahead and bearing down on us was the official oyd car containing count zylox and the detachment of the guard
a groan came from prebble after us captain was the burden of his lament
i was of the same opinion
but there was no retreat for us and we must go ahead and look pleasant
keep a stiff upper lip prebble i called over my shoulder wave your hand and laugh as we pass the count think were out for a little spin just for the fun of the thing
he may think were bound for the palace said the professor reviving
he wonot think that were going directly away from the palace
then he canot be coming from the palace can he
no but he may be after us all the same there
now hail him laugh and be hearty about it
the count had slowed down his car and was watching us with surprise and suspicion
ahoy there count
i yelled as we sped by
how am i for a navigator anyway prebble gave a laugh but there was not much heartiness in if
where are you going shouted the count
yes roared back at him to understand drew out the screen a little farther could not look behind and manage the car so i asked prebble what the count was doing keeping right on returned the professor
great colossus he sputtered aghast
what now
i demanded
klimon dashing along the road captain meet the count of course
tell me whether the count stops to talk with the chur prebble
lopk alive now right in front of the official car salis
the count has got to halt or run over the chur waving his hands
well i dared not take my attention from my work to look behind but had to depend on the professor to keep me informed of what was going on
we shall soon be pushed to the last extremity captain cried prebble
we ought to be used to that by this time i answered grimly
the count has stopped his car and is talking with klimon means pursuit by a highpowered car a car that can walk upon us hand over fist klimon flings himself into the official car went on prebble and there was nothing else for couldnot resist looking back
the official car was just turning to head toward us as i flung the look over my shoulder
at that moment we sped over an uneven place in the road
i lurched wildly and was thrown down on the zellin box
one of my hands was on the sliding screen and as i dropped forward the screen was pushed home abruptly shutting off the power of the cube and bringing us to a slower pace so abruptly that prebble already wabbling because of the thankyoumaam went by the board precipitately
i had a fleeting glimpse of him standing on his head heels in the air
abandoning the professor was farthest fromi my mind and i jammed down on the brakes and brought the car to a standstill
prebble
i yelled
he was lying sprawled out on the earth a dozen feet behind
as ill luck would have it he was silent and inert and apparently had met with injuries which might prove serious
in the distance approaching swiftly was the other car moments were precious but i leaped from the seat and was about to start for prebble when he suddenly sat up
come on
i shouted
hurry
although dazed he was not long in picking up the trend of events
he saw the car with its laad of warlike churs and scrambled to his feet with mere haste than grace
merciful powers he stuttered
he had almost gained the car when he whirled and turned back
what are you trying to do
i roared
just at that moment i saw him bend and pick up the glittering circlet
the talk ring had dropped from his head during his fall and he had gone back after it couldnot understand you he panted as he scrambled to his place in our waiting vehicle
if is the count and is ourselves then never mind that
i cut in
hang on prebble for were going to start on the hih speed
very good captain
the more peed the better
i jerked the screen half through the slot and we shot ahead like an arrow from a bow
the machine was wrenched in every part and i feared for a second that it would be riven to pieces
happily my fears were without foundation
the car held togetherand we flew onward like the wind a poor navigator captain called the professor
this is my first experience withthis kind of a ship i called back to him
what did you do
tried to look behind
while i was about it the machine struck a high place in the road and the power was shut off
he grunted a wonder i did not break my neck captain said he was stunned for an instant
when i sat up i heard you call but couldinot understand what you said
the sight of that other car was enough though to remind me of what was going forward lost time when we had no time to lose
we are under the heel of fortune and must put up with whatever comes
you should have shot klimon
had you done that we might have escaped without having the official car take after us
dealing in such murderous fashion with even a chur was not in me
nevertheless i could see now how it might have been well for us to put klimon out of the way
watch the car behind professor
i cautioned watching going on the churs are getting ready to use their dpears
what the professor had saidabout using the shotgun on klimon had given me an idea
i was biding only the proper moment to put it into execution make short work of us captain shrilled the professor if they overhaul us small doubt of that returned letween my teeth can see the counts eyes flaming like live coals
this race is offering him a chance to even up old scores
and hell improve the opportunity if he can gaining gaining whooped prebble it was useless for us to attempt to escape from the official car
it had a threefoot cube of zellin equivalent to a drawing power of seventytwa men
our machine on the contrary was equipped with only a block
even allowing for the added bulk and heavy load of the counts car we were greatly outclassed
i opened the screen to its widest and at times we seemed hardly to touch the road so fast did we go
are we holding our own prebble
i cried still gaining he answered
there comes a spear where does it strike
ten feet behind us
half a minute passed
another spear chattered prebble six feet behind
i muttered an exclamation
the count had gained four feet in thirty seconds and something wotld have to be done at once prebble i shouted come here and run the car canot he exclaimed
yes you can youll have to what are you going to do
never mind
time is too precious to waste tatk
on hands and knees he crept to the forward point of the car and slipped into the drivers seat as i vacated it steered a boat
i asked my lips to his ear
he nodded steers in the same way
keep a firm grip on the helm or youll get a broken rib
with this warning i crept back to the middle seat the shotgun in my hand
the official car looked like a sailless junk loaded to the gunwale with pirates
shields and spears bristled in the sun and out of the center of the phalanx gleamed the white face of count zylox gloomy and ominous
stop he cried fiercely
i paid no attention to the word but riveted my eyes on the front of the official car
two churs sat in the point one managing the steering lever and the other the screen
at their feet between them was the large box holding the zellin cube
a quick thought plunged through my brain
i hesitated but a moment and then kneeling on the broad seat i threw up the breech of thegun there was a cartridge each barrel
throwing the piece to my shoulder i took a long and careful aim at the zellin box
a spear clove the air narrowly missing my head
that was my signal to pull the trigger
bang
the recoil wrenched my shoulder and nearly threw me from the seat
when the smoke lifted i saw that i had worked havoc enough
that single charge had torn away the front and side of the zellin box caused trouble with the steering gear and pricked the shins of the churs in the point the driver and the helmsman scared out of their wits had hurled themselves into the road
the rest of their red companions followed them and flattened out along the ground leaving only count zylox in the car
what contortions that wonderful machine went through
jerked ahead by a force as of seventytwo churs the broken helm thrashing in all divections it zigzagged here and there jumped aloft with wheels whirring and finally crashed into a tree at the roadside and lay a complete wreck count zylox i was glad to note had hurled himself from the car before the final catastrophe and was suffering from nothing more than a few a a wail from the professor called my attention from the scene behind gone its gone gone the screen cover
i drew it from the box to get the entire force of the cube and the tiller jammed sideways and knocked it out of my hand
i was angry for this carelessness of the professors was like to cost us dear we were not pursued it is true but our car was running away with us
the only power we had over it was to guide it a little to right and left
we could not stop or diminish the speed
our gait was that of the empire state express and the track before us had suddenly widened into all outdoors
where we had left the road i do not know but we were racing across a broad plain hot sandy level as a floor
there were no houses no trees no rocksnothing to impede our progicss
this was well considering our limited ability in handling the oyd car peered ahecad
in ilie distance there rose from the earih a cloud like haze funnelshaped and resembling the swirling vortex of a cyclone
what was it
i had no time to debate the question even had i been so disposed
the wall
the wall shrieked prebble
yes there was the great wall built to hem in the churs
it stretched across the plain as far as the eye could see and appeared to encircle the column of smoke or dust or whatever it was
as we charged toward it and it came plainer and plainer into view i concluded that it must be at least thirty feet in height of solid masonry pierced with one brazen gate toward which we were heading
the gate twenty feet wide and twenty high looked forbidding enough but better a colliston with that than with the granite wall
port your helm prebble
i shouted
port
as he moved the tiller i saw a score of the red fiends silhouetted on top of the wall
they were looking at us whooping dancing and beating their spears against their shields
prebble begzin a paternostr but i cut him short with the remaining barrel of the shotgun fired into the air
the churs melted from the wall as if by magic
you see
i shouted triumphantly
this gun is going to do the business for us prebble
that wall is going to do the business he flung back heading for the gate
i answered
do you think we can smash open the gate and ride through the land of the churs straight to the pole he retorted grimly
make your peace with heaven salis be a smashup in less than a minute got to jump said as calmly as possible
better to jump than have our lives battered out against the gate
while speaking i threw out the bag of pemmican and ships biscuit
the bag struck the ground sprang twenty feet into the air and fell again in a shower of sand
and weve got to go through that cried the professor not be a whole bone left in our bodies
jump
i shouted
follow me
out i went shotgun in hand
when i came down i must have turned a dozen somersaults
the gun left my hands and the talk ring my head
i ripped my toga to rags and would have lost it utterly had not the cartridge belt held its remnants about my waist
after a second or two i realized that i was sitting on the sand watching a figure fly upward from the point of the oyd car squirm through the air drop and ricochet along the ground halting at last a mere heap of humanity in a wrecked tunic
was the professor dead or alive
as i picked myself up painfully to go forward and investigate a crashing sound reached me from the gate
looking toward that point i noted with wonder that the barrier had not withstood the impact of the zellin cube
the gate was ajar various pieces of the oyd car piled in the opening
prebble was on his feet before i reached him he still wore his buskins and was frantically engaged in tying the remains of the tunic about his waist
yes he cried angrily you would come north captain
reason circumstances evervthing pointed south
but no you would go north or nowhere
and now look at us
he picked up his talk ring and jammed it down on his head
he said something else but as he was talking nyll and i was listening in english the sense of it was lost upon me
it was clear to me that he was not very seriously hurt and i went back for my own talk ring and the gun the professor was sorely out of patience with everybody and everything
he had had two falls from the oyd car and the first one alone would have soured his temper but for the excitement attending the pursuit
this second fall was far more dangerous and annoying than the first and i could not blame him for displaying some rancor to become of us salis the professo demanded surveying me as though he considered our salvation my part of the work cantell you better about that in a few minates i answered dizzy in brain and weak in the legs
the only way i could hold myself upright was by jeaning on the shotgun
if it isnot one thing its two scowled prebble
how are we to get out of this wish i knew
it strikes me though that the farther we can get away from that smashed gate the better it will be for us
come on prebble
i reeled to an about face and began staggering off along the wall
prebble shouted an angry protest and i turned to discover that he had piumped himself down in the sand
how do you think i can move he groaned joint in my body is unhinged
look where i lit and he pointed to a gougedout spot in the earth
no man could hit the ground like that without being half killed
if we linger here until the churs come out said finish the job willing he declared resignedly had quantum sufficit
being flesh and blood and not whalebone and india rubber my body tells me when i have borne hardships to the limit of endurance
if youre bound to go on salis good by
it is impossible for me to accompany you
buck up answered wish i could but i canot
here let me help you decline to be interfered with to stay righthere so that the churs can have a good chance at me
why are they hanging back
why donot they show themselves
i looked toward the broken gate
the oyd car was heaped fantastically in the middle of it but there was no sign of churs te be seen
the roar of the gun has frightened them i explained
it couldnot frighten all the churs but only those who were on the wall
where are the rest not theorizing about the rest the present situation that concerns me
remember what happened at the lake when that revolver was fired
those who heard the report dropped pronc on their faces but those who didnot hear the report refused to be awed by the description the others cave of it
there il be a smother of the hairy demons ail around us before long
somie messenzer has revived and gone after them
the professors voice was hopeful appeared to be honestly glad that our misadventurcs were soon to be terminated
his voice was strong and robust
from that i gathered that he was not so severely injured as he was trying to make me believe
let me lift you to your lcet professor i suggested and then i can support you while we make our escape
he stared at me dblankly
escape he echoed
why do you talk about such a thing
where are we to escape to
is there any haven of refuge in all this region for you and me
if we go back the nyllites will catch us if we go forward then we fall into the hands of the churs not a spot in all this henighted country wherewe can call ourselves safe
we should have gone south in the direction of the ice wall
i saw that i must reason with my companion and get him back into a normal state of mind
tl adfnit professor said that our situation seems hopeless but has it not seemed equally hopeless several times before this
and havenot we always managed to slip through the gathering dangers got to be a first time captain when we fail to slip through he answered shaking his head forebodingly
personally i think we have come to that time had hoped i went on taking another tack that you would live to give to the world your proof regarding the meteoric theory of the aurora
possibly there is more glory in that for you than for me in discovering the pole what i dislike about this chur business said he a flash 9f pride crossing his dusty face proof he added fondly which scientific men cannot dodge have to delieve it
i intend to write a book that will place my name high on the scroll of fame
he got up quite briskly while he was talking am absolutely certain that my word is the very last on this meteoric theory of the aurora
from that ipse dixit there is no escape
right you are
i cried enthusiastically
suppose we stroll off along the wall and see what we can discover
he leaned on me for a space while he adjusted his glasses ought to feel grateful to you captain he maundered for giving me the chance to settle a question which has bothered scientific minds for years
i am grateful believe me
how are you feling
i asked solicitously
better
i am not so much of a wreck as had imagined
there are no fractures naturally my dignitjr has suffered somewhat but his voice trailed off into silence for just at that moment an army of churs had begun fairly to boil out of the gate in the wall
these were not the ones who had heard the terrifying report of the shotgun and dropped from the wall a short time before but others undaunted and eager to fall upon us
with fierce yells and spears clashing against shields they literally swarmed in our direction
quick panted prebble
the gunthe gun
i threw up the breech and the empty shells were automatically ejected
then i plucked from the belt one of the few cartridges that had remained in it after my tumble from the car
i pressed the shell to the breech
the next moment it is possible i swore for i am a sailor and the provocation was great
what faltered prebble whisperingly what now
i looked at him with dilated eyes
these shells i replied hoarsely are too large
i canot get them into the gun
griffyn must have had two shotgunswe got the belt that goes with the other weapoh
the professor tossed his arms and fell to the ground
i stoed over him the muzzle of the gun in my hands sweeping a circle about me with the stock
i forget how many of those rabid churs i mowed down with the clubbed firearm can only remember that we were taken tied together with thongs and driven beyond the great wall spear points pricking us at every step
prebble and
i had been on tenterhooks ever since our arrival in this circumpolar region but we had not faced a more desperate situation than the one that now confronted us
personally i would not have given a copper cent for our chances
my learned companion as was so often the case with him was lost in contemplation of our strange surroundings to the exclusion of the animal instinct of fear
his mind was grappling with scientific data and was therefore too busy to consider our perils here i heard him mutter we see the human faculties emerging through their chrysalis of brutality primordial obscure but very pronounced nevertheless
how these heads and these faces would delight a lombroso
there are no other savages in the world like these
if i could abduct one of the creatures and take it back to our own country what a stir would be caused the scientific world
unless i am greatly mistaken professor i observed dryly you will have a splendid chance to study these interesting savages at close quarters hope so i do indeed he answered absently and was off again with his mumbling
how do they live
what do they eat
are they monogamous
do they have villages
that prognathous visage predicates cruelty and determination
ah very absorbing very donot see anything in the nature of tilled fields professor said he lifted his bowed head and became suddenly aware that was marching at his side
no captain he returned in an attempt to be sociable these savages are not agricultural
in one way or another most savages are found to take a certain toll from mother earth and i presume that these churs must raise something in the nature of food even though none of their fields are in evidence
the arts of the husbandman are very primitive in origin
adnuration filled his face as he bent his gaze on a tall savage marching just ahead of him
what perfect physical development he exclaimed can see little in these hairy scoundrels said i testily but vast powers for evil they are mere brutesat the bottoin of the scale while the nyllites are at the top
the nyllites symbolize the mind even as these churs are symbolical of the matter remarked prebble
the brilliant mentality of the nyll kingdom reaches here for its physicaljpower takes it by sheer force of the will humbles it and shapes it to various uses
where could you happen upon a finer commientary on the power of mind over matter
you are getting in too deep for me professor said warrant you however that if these hurs only realized their power they could overrun the kingdom of yil and lay it waste
the professor shuddered
what a catastrophe that would be he murmured
think of the gorgeous palaces the beautiful gardens the wondrous inventions and discoveries of nyl all lying under the strangling hands of these brutes
such a calamity is too monstrous captain
it could never happen
what caused the downfall of the roman enipire
i asked
luxury effiminacy too much wealth and power
all the empire became drunk with prosperity
and as a result the roman eagle had its neck wrung and was cast to the vultures
am i right it very tersely captain
nyll strike you as being much in the same way
he threw me a startled look
at times captain said he you uncover a rich vein of thought that strikes into profound depths yes you are right
nyll bases its power upon faculties of the mind that have been most astonishingly deveoped if anything were to becloud those powers the whole kingdom would be pillaged by these brutes who are now confined wlthln the great wall
the possibility is terrible to contemplate and it quite unnerves me
but nyllites are not exact replicas of the ancient romans
although a land of idleness the other kingdom is not lapped in sensuous ease
our experiences with the nyllites have not been pleasant yet we must grant them their due
i know personally that labors of the mind are more exhausting than labors of the body
the professor was intensely interested in our captors
without the wall he had been willing to bide in hdpelessness while the churs sallied forth and dispatched him but now he was in another mood
you realize i suppose said i grimly that we are prisoners these ropes that bind my arms at my back he replied serve to remind me of that fact captain
do you also realize that we may be doomed to death
that is quite possible he returned gravely but i hope they will spare us long enough so that i may make some inquiries regarding their mode of life
an examination into their tribal customs their language the limitations of their intellect and their ways of war would be highly diverting they are but a step above the beasts of the forest and may prove to be the trye miss ing link that unites man to the lower orders of creation
if we could take one of them back with us captain
we have no visible means for getting ourselves away to our own country i broke in so let us say nothing of burdening our return with savages like these
he saw that i was out of sympathy with his aspirations and i saw plainly that he was in a trancelike condition where his scientific knowledge was wrestling with recondite enigmas to the complete exclusion of his present unhappy state
i watched the churs striding swiftly along and forcing us to hurry in their midst
their faces reflected a purpose which was ominous and aroused disagreeable thoughts of what was to happen to the professor and me
there was nothing to be done however except to submit passively and face the end with fortitude
something might happen to make the end more pleasant than the present situation promised
i saw no buildings nothing in the way of shelter even of the rudest description
there were no evidences of art and craft beyond the shields and the spears
these were wellmade wepons of offense and defense but suggested nothing more than war and savagery
i lis tened to the professor discoursing to himself the facial angle retreating from the prognathous jaws to the low forehead prove these churs to be bestial
they are cruel merciless superstitiousprimitive children as yet untouched by the faintest ray of real knowledge
thus he mumbled scarcely heeding the spear that accelerated his lagging pace
i also took notice of many things but only in a perfunctory and general way
for instance in passing through the gate i judged the wall of masonry to betwenty feet in thickness i saw that the land of the churs was ridged with rocky hills for the most part barren i felt the earth to be uncomfortably warm under my feet and when we waded a small stream the water was hot to my flesh
in the distance that column of cloudlike vapor trailed skyward bending and twisting at the crest and spreading out so that the sun resembled a fiery ball a drifting shroud
on and on we walked until we turned into a defile among the gaunt rocks
spears struck shields in a ringing clamor and presto the bowlders spewed out a perfect mob of unkempt creatures who ran toward us some erect andsome on all fours
women and children droned prebble very curious very
evidently these creatures are cave dwellers possibly survivors of the stone age and as such our progenitors
i should like their measurements on the bertillon system
the women and children surveyed us in awe
the professor however claimed most of their attention their eyes being focused on his head and spectaclesthe spectacles and buskins being about all that remained to him of his former state we were goaded into a vilesmelling hole in the rocky hillside and were made to sit down while our fect were pinioned
then perfectly helpless we were left to our own devices
one of the tall that he stood head and shoulders above the restbarked out a series of orders
immediately the creatures seattered women and children with the rest and began fetching armfuls of dry wood and throwing it down in a heap
while thiswas going forward other churs arrived
two carried the shotgun across their spears in front of them not daring to touch it with their hands
four with spears elevated had our bag of pemmican and ships biscuit on the spear points
that also i suppose was a fetich and to be handled warily
lastly came a train of grizzled warriors each with a lost cartridge on the flat of his spear head these were thrown in a heap beside the gun and bag of food in for it i muttered gloomily you think so prebble monosyllabic he answered absently
what
i queried
he gave a start
their speech captain is of the onesyilablfc variety that is rudimentary
now the ancient aryans belay
i interrupted out of temper want none of your homilies now
we have plenty of food for thought of a different kind
yes yes he answered eagerly should call it homonymous or rather i lurched against him and brought him out of his vagary
eh he exclaimed
did you say something captain look out there
i answered brutally
lord nylis said these creatures were cannibals and they appear to be collecting wood a chain of reasoning to claim your immediate attention
you think the professor grew pallid donot think i answered know
he pressed his clawlike hands together bound as they were
a at last the professor was completely en rapport with our desperate situation
the world will lose my demonstration of the meteoric theory he cried bitterly and you salis are the cause
outside the wall you offered hope
hope
and look at us now
upon your head sir will fall the consequences guess were both in for the consequences i returned
by the mizzentruck of the great harry
i added looking toward the wood gatherers a nyllite prisoner asked prebble
no he acts as though he had some authority among them
strange muttered my companion his eyes on the man
he wears the skin of a wild beast like the churs and there is not the same intelligenceshown in his face as in the faces of others of his race
here comes the tallman hes a chief i suppose
the leader of the pack made toward the cave followed by four others ready for us i take it said trying to speak calmly beg your pardon captain said prebble
for what
for accusing you of leading me into this predicament
it has just flashed over me that we could not have gone south i we had wanted too thought it would come to you i answered
we will meet our fate shoulder to shoulder he went on not death that terrifies me what follows in this case
i laid my bound hands against his which was as near a handshake as we could come
we differed often prebble and for we were two of diverse natures vet never doubted his innate manhood nor do i think he ever doubted mme
there was something incongruous in remark just made when compared with other remarks remembered by me of which he had relieved himself while we were on the ice cap but i have yetto find a man who is at all fimes perfectly consistent
surely no scientific man can lay claim to such an honor
through the opening of our cave we watched the tall man and the four others
suddenly the tall man came to a halt grouped the four around began a harangue
the guttural voice was pitched so low that we could not distinguish anything except husky syllables and staccato pauses between them
they are devising ways and means i suppose said the professor
omne supposition is as good as another i answered
it all comes to one thing in the end is a bad dream an exceedingly disagreeable dream
you still cling to that fiotion do you
why not if it pleases me
all life my dear captain is a dream
at least so my fancy runs
an immortal falls asleep in elysium and what he dreams is a human life
sometimes his dream is short and sometimes long sometimes it is sad and bitter and sometimes full of happiness and hopes realized
but the immortal wakes whether his dream is bright or dull and again he discovers himself in elysium and he realizes that he has been in elysium all the time
with my eyes on the gabbling churs i gave rather deep attention to this odd conceit of i had never suspected that he had a vein of poetry in his makeup
very pretty said and what is dbetter and more to the point there may be a little truth in it
but elysium must be full of sleepers
he muttered a few words under his breath and i feared he was tinkering up another equation
but no
presently he lifted his head removed his spectacles and began cleaning them on a rag of his tunic
at that moment the chief came on with his four churs and the professor came to a pause
the chur chieftain unbound our ankles and motioned to us to rise
we obeyed and walked out among the ragged rabble that surrounded the pyre there we were cut asunder and the professor was led aside and made to seat himself on a bearskin
after this the nyllite stepped in front of me
you are from nyll he asked
recentiy i answered
where from originally
there are no blackhaired men in nyll and no hairless men like the one yonder
he turned and indicated prebble
we come from beyond the ice wall
who are you if i may inquire
sertez i am called
banished from nyll by king boazar on the morning of the long day
banished he added acrimoniously because i dared to make love to the princess ylma
he struck a note that made my hearstrings vibgate
i eyed him keenly
princess ylma would notreceive your advances i queried
no he answered is nothing
she does not know her own mind
apart from that however she is promised to a man she hates
who
to count zylox captain of the kings guard at last i knew why his lordship felt pity for princess ylma
why will the king force her to marriage agajnsther will
i proceeded feigning carelessness
because zylox is head of the house of almik rivals of the boazars
on his death the king fears ylma will be set aside in favor of zylox and he wishes to unite the two houses
sertez turned and shook his clenched fist southward bide my time he hissed
some day i shall lead a horde of churs into nyll and steal theprincess
the next moment he shrugged his shoulders and tossed his hands deprecatingly
but enough of this suppose you know the fate for which you are intended can imagine what it is to be
have you any power among these people
can you not persuade them to give over their horrible designs
he shook his head
your companion will be spared said he
he is taboo among the churs because of his hairless head
we can none of us understand the what we cannot understand we believe to be supernatural
i laughed bitterly at the inconsistency of the churs
the professor would live
he might never be able to return to our own country but his bald pate saved him from thie disaster that threatened me
i was near the shotgun the small heap of cartridges and the food bag
my despondent eyes fell upon them and i noticed something small in itself but of great importance just then
the cartridges differed in size
had there been two sizes of loaded shells in the belt
and had in my haste at the great wall plucked out one of the larger shells will ask you said i to the nyllite to take this cord from my wrists
you cannot escape said he
therefore the less reason for you to hesitate in granting my request
he removed the bonds
instantly i picked up the shotgun threw up the breech and tried one of the smaller shells
i tremble even now to think of that agonizing moment
would it fit or had i tried the smaller kind just without the wall
the shell slid into the barrel and i snapped the breech back into place
glory shouted prebble leaping to his feet and waving frantically the bearskin on which he had been sitting
he performed a dance bizarre enough considering his regalia
the churs thinking i was about to make some attempt at escape began closing in on me with savage cries and ferocious gestures
i fired the single barrel into the air and stood quietly under the smoke wreath noting the effect
the result was all that i had dared to hope
down went the churs even sertez sinking to one knee
silence followed disturbed only by the gabbling old professor who not knowing his bald head had saved him believed the gun had proved the salvation of both of us
presently the chief got up on his hands and knees crawled to my feet and lifted a handful of sand and threw it over his head
then he rose and yelped at the rest of his hairy followers
immediately a long line of the creatures began creeping past me every one of them performing the same operation
what is the meaning of this sertez he in quired
as long as you remain on earth thunder maker returned fulsomely you and your companionare the honored guests of the pack
koz the chieftain tenders his abject apologies for the manner in which you have been treated
those on the wall prior to the breaking of the gate averred stoutly that you were the thunder maker but koz would not believe
now that he hae heard with his own ears and seenwith his own eyes he declares that heand his pack will be your slaves umtil you depart from the land
tis well i answered with dighity
tell koz that we are put out somiewhat at themanner of our reception but that we harbor noill will
he shall be informed also wish you to tell him i continued i and my companion are merely human like the nyliites
but we have power to requite evil for evil andgood for good
there is no such word as good in the chur language
then repeat the substance of my remarks in way
chief koz leader of the pack seemed overjoyed when my words were translated by sertez for his benefit
from condemned strangers we rose at one leap to the rank of honored guests
the best cave in the hills was placed at our two of the chiefs sons were told off to serve us
one of our first acts was to send for the bag of pemgnican and biscuit and to fortify ourselves with ahearty meal against other emergencies which we knew would be sure to arise
soon after we had finished our meal sertez looked in on us for a little chat
prebble and i had just been discussing sertez
he was by his own admission a banished man but i regarded him in the light of a renegade
he had said princess ylma did not like himfor which i commended her warmlyand that in the face of this it was his desire to abduct her
no gentleman would express himself in such a manner
prebble was of one mind with me but advised that we tolerate the fellow because of his value to us in our dealings with the churs
so when sertez crept through the low entrance into our cave and then got up and advanced into the glare of the torch that lighted the interior we welcomed him civilly
he remarked upon the head room to be had in our quarters saying it was the only cave in the district where a man could stand upright without fear of knocking out his brains
he lolled on a bearskin and we presented him with a bit of pemmican and a ships biscuit both of which he appeared to relish should think said that if the churs can climb to the top of the great wall on one side they could drop over on the other
so they could he answered but there is no need of any climbing
you gentlemen have demolished the gate and it is now possible to walk through with perfect ease
then why donot they do it struck in prebble
from the little i have seen of both countries nyll is far preferable to this
the churs are cowed by the superiority of the nyllites said sertez
with one look a nyllite can make a chur drop his spear and run howling back to his wilderness can you ever hope to make a raid into the other country i asked have been waiting for king doazar and the almiks to come to daggers drawn
but now i have another plan
i propose to cooperate with you
in what way
you seem to be possessed of wonderful pow ers sertez proceeded audaciously and if you could by some means the nyllites the churs would immediately overrun their country and i could get the princess
the shotgun was within reach i put out my hand toward it
prebble halted me with a look
that is out of our power said he
disappointment overspread thie villainousface of sertez
there is no way you can help me he queried
no i replied shortly
what is the extent of the chur possessiotis asked the professor at his old tradeof delving for facts
twenty miles fromwall to wall
and what causes that pillar of smoke which we see to the north
sertez looked surprised supposed everybody knew that said he
the earth grinding around its great spindle causes much heat so that smoke and minute particles of dust arise and mingle with the clowds
tlie professor grabbed at his head
adter a moment he continued what is the diameter of the north pole a geographical mile
round on top
no flatflat as a floor
the great ziff lives there
who under the canopy is the great ziff
i demanded
again the surprised lock filtered across face
your ignorance astonishes me he exclaimed
the great ziff gentlemen is head chief of all the packs
when the time comes to raid the land of the nyllites he will head the packs in person
he is a warrior of prowess
he is invincible in combat a veritable lion
but the eyes of the nyllites are too much for him as for the rest of his followers
there are some peculiar things ahout the great ziff for instance he is not subject to the gentlemen
fe has lived many thousands influenice of time of vears and will no doubt last as long as the earth endures
i saw a grin forming about the professors thin lips
how do you account for thiserremarka ble longevity very easily
what makes timer
days of course the succession of light and darkness
what makes days
the rotation of the earth on its axis
the great ziff lives on the end of the axis and doesnot rotate
therefore he is not subject to the influence of time
the professor reached for the gun this time but i grabbed jt from him
sophistry he cried rotation of the earth as you sdy makes what we call a day but neither days nor months nor years make time
they are but way stations on the eternal path
when you have been longer in the country you will know more about it was unruffled rejoinder
prebble grew red in the face and only succeeded in calming himself after a great effort
how far is the north pole from here
i asked
an hours journey am anxious to pay my respects to the great zi impossible
why impossible
at a distance of fifty feet from the pole the terrific heat would scorch you to a cinder
how does the great ziff get on and off the pole rarely gets off
as for getting on he was there when the earth began to rotate
nonsense whooped the professor
the longer you stay the more youll kuow said sertez laconically
if the great ziff leads his subjects on their raid into the land of nyll i put in have to get off the pole wonot he
he will answered sertez
when ready hell come fire has no effect on him and that is another of his peculiarities
it is said he is very fond of blue fire
he is served by little boys in red caps what folly is the man talking exclaimed the disgusted professor
and by monsters all head and no tail continued sertez and by hideous slimy things that creep on the earth and slide through the air and ordered prebble
we have enough of that after facts not fancies
the longer youre with us the more yes yes you said that before
the churs believe these things about the great ziff
about what i would expect of their primitive minds sniffed the professor run to physical rather than to mental power said sertez rising
if i can be of assistance to you at any time gentlemen he added not fail to call on me
thereupon he crawled out on all fours as he had crawled in
there goes the biggest began the pro fessor but paused abruptly
no he went on wonot say it
what he tells is hardly more in credible than the things we have seen with our own ecyes since reaching these circumpolar re gions if we were to put our experiences down in black and white for the benefit of our fellow countrymen captain they would call us monumental reirain again
the term grates on a sensitive ear
truth is stranger than fiction ever dared to be said i sagely
a few minutes later accompanied by our servitors bigoll and xit we emerged from our cavern and started for the pole
our den opened on a rocky defile with steep sides which it was necessary for us to traverse
at the end of the defile we came upon a group of warriors who grinning behind their couched spears disputed our advance
i motioned them aside but they would not stir around for sertez thinking to make our wishes known through him
he was not in sight however
as a last resort i fired the gun
the churs quaked in their tracks but did not fall as had heretofore been their invariable custom tr the other end of the defile said the professor
we did and were met by more of the churs who blockaded us as effectuauy as the others had done we are honored guests with a vengeance i fumed does this mean anyway
it means replied the professor that they prize our company so highly they canot let us go
we must return to the cave
this we did and for one hundred and sixtyeight hourswhich would have been seven days in a country where night and day recur in accepted orderwe slept ate conversed and made essays to begin our journey poleward
but we were unable to leave the defile the outlook was discouraging
sertez kept himself in the background the whole time and whenever we questioned bigoll and xit by signs to tell us about him they shook their heads and grinned blankly
finally in the hundred and sixtyeighth hour sertez materialized
he brought with him a silver box
you told us to call on you said with some heat whenever we desired your services am here gentlemen he answered blandly where have you peen
abroad in the land of the 
churs organizing and preparing for the coming of the great ziff
i noticed that he was highly pleased over something and repressed his jubilant teelings with dituculey on foot
i asked messenger one of the churs has come from the land of boazar
he says the blight has fallen and that the mental powers of the nyllites are dethroned
they have become gibbering idiots doddering fools
and now now the accepted time approaches
you do not believe in the great ziff
but you shall see him come in a cloud of blue fire with the little boys in red caps and monsters all head and no tail and hideous things that creep on earth and slide through air
you shall witness the gathering of the packs under the great ziff and then if you follow you shall observe the overthrow of the nyllites and behold sertez and princess ylma united and holding sway under protection of the high chief of the churs
he drew a picture which horrified me
for the moment prebble was dumb
sertez laughed diabolically and handed me the silver box and a little golden kel for you said he the messenger brought it
he said it was for the stranger with the black hair and eyes was all agog with curiosity
and so was prebble for that matter
both he and sertez watched eagerly while unlocked the casket and threw back the lid gorr plate with the royal arms exclaimed the astonished sertez
carnelian he added
the plate is from a woman
in the box was a square thin block of a fleshred color
i was excited and my hands shook as i removed the plate
how do vou know it is from a woman
i asked
young unmarried women use carnelian for communicating their thoughts answered sertez grass widows use ehrysoprase the green of chalcedony bachelors use a varicolored block of agate and all other men employ onyx
how do you contrive to learn the secrets of the plate
i asked will show you
he reached for the carnelian block but i thrust it behind me
this is mine i believe you said i remarked very well he simpered but i detected a flash of his eyes which made me distrustful
try for yourself and you learn nothing
you are not educated up to it
take the plate between your palms so
he held his palms close togethet illustrating how i was to hold the thirfg
i did as directed
a delightful sensation the very poetry of exquisite feeling sped along my nerves and centered in my brain apart from this however no tangible thought impressed itself on my mind
what mysteries were locked in the plate burned to know yet dreaded using the only channel lying open to me
sertez was a vilai
still he was a nyllite and had been brought up on gorr plates so to speak
my imnatience tn receive the message overcaame my repugnance of the means
i handed the royal block to the renegade
tell me what it says i requested
a gleam of satisfaction darted through his blue eyes
i kmew i was playing into his hands but i also knew there was nothing else for it
he sank on a bearskin the plate between his palms
bending his head he began in a low voice the thoughts of ylma princess of nyll daughter of boazar concerning momentous events takmg place in the kingdom and coacernmg the blackhaired blackeyed stranger from beyond the ice wall who is often in her mind and atways abides in her heart
i was for snatching the plate from this renegade my rival but what he had said only made me wildly eager for more
i could learn more through him alone so i suffered him to proceed wondrous and unheardof things are in the land of nyllites and i am filled with fearful forebodings
the other strangers comljured from the sky by the hairless prophet were condemned to death by oyd but saved themselves by offering to deliver to the king and his people thousands of keeses of the elixir introduced by the little prophet with the glass eyes
whereto the foreigners last to arrive have rearet a strange structure filled with wonderful vats and called by them a distillery
into this structure maize is carried and from it keese upon keese of the elixir is taken to the end that the whole kingdom may renew its youth
but if youth must be renewed at such a price it is my prayer that the all wise will suffer me to age quickly and die that i may nolonger witness the orgies of these my people
the king my father lies constantly in a state of torpor the gentlemen in waiting sing songs and hold wassail from hour to hour the ministers have lackluster eyes and mumble to themselves and the business of state is at a standstill
the people are even as the churs dull besotted reeling along the roads shouting raving filling the air with hideous sounds
they have become heasts and worsethan beasts
princess ylma cries aloud in her despair to the hblackeyed stranger from the land beyond the ice wall
will he come to the rescue of the hyperboreans save this distressed people and gain the cternal gratitude of his unhappy ylma
something tells me he will not ignore this prayer and that i am as much in his heart as he is in mine
the voice of sertez ceased
while speaking his tones had become soft and gentle as though he appropriated for himself the thoughts of the carnelian block
then abruptly he leaped erect with flaming flung the gorr plate at my feet
in a voice husky with anger he cried you blackhaired interloper from the antipodes dare to raise your eyes to the princess ylma
you have the unblushing audacity to rival one of her own race
liscreant
renegade cried i hotly
captain captain implored prebble observing my clenched fists be calm calm i cried calm when this banished scoundrel speaks to me in the manner he does
by the mizzentruck of the great harry hes the worst enemy king boazar has do my frst stroke of work for princess ylma attend to this beggar so his pretty plan for raiding the country will fall through
prebble stepped in front of me
enough of this captain said he
remove your talk ring so that we may converse without letting sertez understand our words
i removed the ring and strung it on my arm meanwhile keeping wary and wrathful eyes on the renegade
i will say for him that he held his ground with great firmness giving every indication of being a knave of unusual qualities to find together
now went on prebble his own ring in his hand let me tell you captain that it is unwise to arouse sertez against us
our safety among the churs is problematical
we are alive by grace of your being esteemed the thunder maker but the remegade has power with the churs and might at any moment withdraw us from their favor
we cannot afford to take chances
the scoundrel has designs upon the princess ylma
i flared
prebble looked at me keenly
have you any designs on the princess captain he asked bluntly
l am a man of honor said drawing up to my full height and that question is leading and highly personal
be sensible captain begged prebble am i not
i growled glowering into the saturnine face of sertez
you are not if you contemplate an alliance by marriage with the princess
she is not of vour people and she is of the royal family
such a union would be a misalliance and result in disaster
believe me salis
she is a beautiful girl and as goed as she is beautiful i answered
and you have seen her twice and talked with her not at all
much you know about her captain am an explorer prebble but that does not deny some small amount of sentiment in my soul
strangle this bit of sentiment
it has warped your judgment
continue to harbor it and you will suffer
suffer i echoed angrily
yes suffer
suppose you could get away from this part of the earth and return to other parts we know better
would you take princess ylma with you
as mrs salis yesif she would go
what would happen to the throne in that event
when the times comes for boazar to die with princess ylma gone the kingdom wauld fall into the hands of sertez
could there be a greater disaster and if yima were she would fall into the hands of sertez
that prebble is an infinitely greater disaster
he smiled
you look at the princess through the small end of the telescope captain said he and at the kingdom through the big end
as a conseguence the importance of the princess is magnified out of all proportion
there is no use arguing with me prebble i stormed know my heart man and i will go my own way
as for this scoundrel sertez will save nyll from his lawless intentions
when i am done with him there will be no chance of the kingdom or of the princess ever talling into his unworthy hands
i consider it duty to put sertez out of the way and all this muttered prebble because of the thought waves imbedded in one gorr plate
are we all mad
call it what you will my mind is made up
yima has called upon me to save her fathers kingdom
pollock has released an evil which had its inception with us we are at fault and the least we can do is to pay heed to the cry sent us by the princess in that carnelian block
listen counseled the professor
there is a possibility that sertez did not translate the thought waves of the princess correctly
no possibility of that at all
he wanted to learn what thoughts the princess was sending to me
he may have repeated to you a message which is not in the plate
prebble the message proves itself to be correct no sidestepping all that about pollock the dlstlllel son flooding nyll with that tt has happened and all th confounded elixir rest has happened just as sertez told us
the sentiments of the princess were correctly translated and lay my life on it
that gorr plate is a call to actiona commandand we cannot ignore it am as eager for action as you are captain said prebble but what can we do if we tie our hands by antagonizing sertez
he is already antagonized 
in me he recognizes a rival and that is more than enough to set him against the two of us
stand aside
i tell you professor i am determined to see this through to the bitter end
we must strike a blow for nyll
you are subordinating the welfare of nyll to that of the princess
if you slay sertez captain every chur will be at our throats
reecf please on that phase of the matter have reflected and i tell you there is no time to lose
over the professors shoulder was the evil leering face of the renegade taunting me and giving me a dare to do my worst
in order to stop the professors arguments clapped on the talk ring then i started by a detour for sertez
prebble sought to hold me but i shook him off
the next moment i hurled myself at the renegade
he was slender and quick of movement and managed to avoid me
ducking under my fist he raced for the entrance to the cave picking up the gun and cartridge belt as he fled
there he goes screamed prebble stealing our thunder let him steal our thunder captain
i tried my best to overhaul the rascal but he clawed through the opening a dozen feet in the lead
down i went on my marrow bones to follow andthen just as i was close to the exit there came a crash and the light of day was shut
rom my eyes
ahuge bowlder which had been kept in readiness as afterward learned was knocked free and fell across the entrance
prebble and were imprisoned in the cave
imprisoned and rendered helpless when we were needed elsewhere
for my sole wish now was to get back to the princes and save her and her people from the doom that threatened them
i could have imitated the army in flanders it is possible i did although the memory escapes me
what is that harped the queruious voice of the professor bowlder blocks the entrance answered
push it aside
i had tried without avail locomotive couldnot move it panted you squeeze around the edg
the opening is hermetically sealed
that scoundrel designed this for a living grave i crept back to the torch beside which my companion crouched wringing his hands
think of i said in a hollow voice
what noble minds are there oerthrown
captain replied prebble in an awesome whisper we were the demons referred to in the legend
aye returned we saved our miserable lives with a flask of bourbon and pollock the distillers son has completed the work
they have built a gin mill and the kingdom of boazar is steeped in debauchery
the serpent has crawled into paradise
and the princess ylma
merciful heaven what will become of her i staggered erect and beat my brow with my clenched fists
the opportunity of the churs has arrived said prebble still in his awed whisper
led by the great ziff the allied packs will sweep through the broken gate and lay domains in waste
awful captain
my soul shrinks at the thought
and that arch fiend sertez will bear away the princess yima
i raved must get out of here
we must i tell you
i crawled to the rock again and pushed until i saw stars
not an inch could i move it
come back captain called prebble calmly waste your strength
come back and let us think
can we think ourselves out of this hole in the hillside
i retorted is what we want thought must precede action
come here and be quiet
there was a command in his voice and i crawled back to the torch once more and crouched opposite him watching his fac in the sickly glare
it was a thin strong face the face of a thinker
his eyes gleamed and glowed as he cogitated
i was in the mood for quick and decisive action and the necessity of inaction galled and fretted me
first said the professor we must calm ourselves
a passive brain evolves the most fruitful suggestions
this is not the first time you have asked me to be calm i returned
if my feelings were yours prebble you would understand the uselessness of the request am as much concerned as you are captain over the troubles that menace nyll
sertez the renegade seems destined to have his day
if boazar dies and the kingdom falls into the hands of sertez
you have already spoken of that prebble i mterrupted if boazar dies and if princess yima does not reign as queen regal authority fails into the hands of count zylox
we were told vou remember that zvlox is the head of another branch of the roval family
he is the pretender
you have not grasped ny meaning captain sertez for his reward in helpmd the great ziff aoamst his own people will be given the hand of yhna in marriage
thus he will be the queens consort and undoubtedly elevated to a high place in the wrecked adfter the great ziff gets through with nyll i answered in a hollow tone there will be noth leit to rule
thc churs will occupy the fertile plains of nyll and will overrun and desecrate the palaces and the templea ev enthmcf worth while will be trmlp led underfoot and destroved and the conquering brutes will brutalize everything good and noble with which they come in contact
in time however the nyllites will shake o7 tie vstupor recover thetr brilliant mental powers and reconquer their kingdom
it may require years perhaps decades but that result il be evolved ultimately out of the wreck
nyl will have learned a lesson and can rebuild ijts glory on a firmer foundation not forget professor i reminded him that our present business is to escape from this cavern
we are needed and we must not del lay or waste our time in idle talk
the talk is not idle captain replied prebble
my wits are at work upon this problem and discourse merely sharpens them
i had no hkmg for this sertez from the first was my response but we found ourselves of one mind on that point very soon after we fell into the hands of the churs in what way do you think we can effect our escape from this hole in the hillside an idea has not yet offered itself captain but i have an instinctive feeling that i am close to of the problem
let the talk go on flows i shall suddenly see the light
here was another inconsistency of at times while he was busy with hi prollems he wanted to be alone and would bear with nothing that might distract him here at this time he was eager for conversation and declared it an aid to quick and effective thinking
as my mind was entirely wrapped up in the princess and the sorry plight of her father and his kingdom i was at a loss to put forward any subject for discourse
the professor stepped into the breach
what do you think of the great ziff he inquired
why that he is a great fake is a myth professor and the myth has been developed as a sort of check on the wild churs
the professor shook his head
he is no myth he declared
he is a symbol indeed but a living symbol
there is a vast amount of folk lore and tradition surrounding the great ziff but the person himself is a reality
he is the real king of the churs and he keeps himself hidden because he knows that will bind his authority more closely around his savage subjects
why all that tommyrot about the little boys in red aps and monsters all head and no tail and soon
when
sertez vwas talking to us alout those things you yourself halted him and asked for facts not fancies
the fancies as i now believe captain symbotize facts beyond my depth i observed helplesly
i see in the stories about the great ziff nothing but fatry taleschronicles of the cid and aljce in wonderland
surely you donot agree with the churs that time has no effect upon the ziff and that he has lived alwaysand wili always live belteve the fact which that statement symbolizes asserted prebble
since man inhabited the earth the idea for which the ziff stands has been in the background immutable eternal
but what is that idea
prebble stared at me
there is sentiment in your soul captain and surely your wits should be able to match themselves against the nimble fancies of a lot ol hairy demons like these churs a puzzle which i have no time to work on at present must do something prebble and at once you thought of any way out of here am close to something captain
his eyes for several moments had been fixed on the torch flame
that said he pointing to the flare offers the suggestion that may lead us to freedom
how opening you say is hermetically sealed yes
nou are sure
dositive what causes that flame to bend toward the rear of the cavern
there is a draft and there could be no draft without an opening right
i cried overjoyed
there is an exit somewhere
he pulled the torch from its socket
holding it in his hand he walked slowly toward the back part of the cavern watching the flame as it bent forward directing him with flickering finger
the roof dipped toward the floor
prebble went down on hand and knees still holdine the torch and followi ing as it commandel he trailed away and i saw him weaving to and fro in the distance the fluttering torch like astar
it was a star our star of hope if ever we had one
suddenly the little reddish dot came to a standstill and voice floated back to me eureka he called
bring whats left of the biscuits and pemmican captain
i snatched up the bagit was now light and of small dimensionsand followed my companion
he waited for me have a tight squeeze of it said he
when the great primordial cataclysm fashioned this hill it had the forethought to leave a narrow passage through from the cavern to the top
i can see daylight ahead
crawl for it i returned be close after you
in some way i pushed and dragged myself through and at last we emerged on the hillside overlooking the defile that lay at our caverns mouth
from our position we could look down and see the great bowlder that had been balanced over the entrance
the gully was full of churs and the center of interest seemed to be sertez
the renegade had the gun and was handling it with dangerous carelessness
if hes not careful said kill somebody
the words were barely out of my mouth when the piece exploded and one of the churs fell in his tracks
consternation seized upon every one sertez along with the rest
the destructive power of the gun had not before been brought home to these creatures for the mere report of it had been sufficient to compass my ends
now however the bunghng of sertez had wrought a catastrophe which caused the thunder maker to be doubly feared
the churs prostrated themselves and sertez dropped the firearmas though it had been a serpent flinging the belt down upon it and then retreating to a respeetful distance
this is our opportunity professor said and we hurried down the slope and made our way to where the gun and belt were lying
it would be difficult to decide whether our appearance in the defile having apparently issued through the solid bowlder blocking our cave or the fatal use of the shotgun frightened these iavaze creatures the more on several occasions i had seen their primitive minds overcome but never to the extent that they were now were you able to get out of the cave faltered sertez
it is not mecessary for you to knew said i sternly picking up the belt and buckling it around me and then possessing myself of the gun
inform koz that we desire to go to the pole and interview the great ziff
but you cannot do as i tell you
i broke in sternly and emphasized the command by pointing the gun in his direction
he gave a shout of horror and ran to the chief
koz listened attentively while sertez told our wishes and then approached us with our two servitors bigollrand xit
sertez did not venture in our proximity
krom a distance he called koz and his sons will accompany you
see to it sertez shouted you head no foray into the kingdom of nyll otherwise the thunder maker shall speak in terms you eannot fail to understand
he showed his teeth in a snarling smile and from that i knew that we were not yet done with him
koz himself took the food bag and carried it aerdss his shoulder but neither he nor bigoll nor xit could be induced to bear the thunder maker
with the three churs in the lead our course led us down the defile and out throtigh a country where titans had at one time been at play hurling mountains at each other piling them up fantastically
steadily but surely we advanced upon the pillar of smoke and dust
as we went on the ground grew hotter beneath us
often we struck a spot where our feet were compelled to fly upward in a wild dance or bear the weight of our bodies on their toes
everywhere was desolation
contiguous to the great wall were areas where plants and trees grew and streams of warm water had their courses
but here the heat was fatal to plant life and what moisture the ground contained was given off insteam
still onward we kept our course although it seemed every moment as though we must turn back
a weird exaltation thrilled me
for the present i forgot that i was seeking the great zift to threaten him in case he seized upon the misfortunes of nyll to make an invasion of the country
again the polar explorer searching for that baffling and elusive thing called the north pole
vith my eyes turned straight ahead of me i pressed on and on
at last we reached a point beyond which it would have been suicide to venture
and there before us arose the coal of my ambition
adequatcly to describe the soulinspiring spectacle is beyond me
no pen could do justice to the scene least of all mine which heretofore has been comnfined to the simple annals of the log book
i have seen a volcano in eruption and the vomiting forth of fire and smoke and dust bear some resemblance to this polar phenomenon
here the zone of activity was half a mile in diameter completely circular
within the vortex as the veil shifted the great spindle was disclosed a mighty bulwark of celestial law and orderwithout which there could be no night no dayno certainty of recurring seasonsno life on this fruitful planet entranced we stood and watched the wondrous whirligig perform its mighty evolution
nearly three hundred and fifty feet per hour it moved more than five feet per minutethe grand majestic sweep of a vast world set spinning in the night of ages by the allpowerful hand
prebble and i stood dumb in the presence of the stupendous mechanism koz and his sons lying prostrate pouring upon their heads the dust of humility and reverence
thus in our several ways did the finite pay tribute to the infinite
we must build a cairn said i hoarsely turning my bloodshot eyes upon prebble
why a cairn he asked
as a mark to commemorate this visit a proof to any who follow that captain salis and phineas prebble have been here before them
the churs were here before any of us said prebble
can you go away and claim the discovery of the north pole when human eyes have already looked upon it
his eyes looking out at me from lids inflamed by the heat twinkled oddly
we have been first to pierce the ice wall i answered and are entitled to be called discoverers
suaviter in modo fortiter in re murmured my learned companion
you might just as well claim the discovery without seeing the thing discovered
i see small difference in the ethics of the case
he hopped around to ease his stewing feet
if we were on cooler ground professor said we might go into thatsubject more exhaustively give our attention to the cairn however
who will know what the cairn stands for in case it happens to be found
we will leave a tablet and a flag hot for such work and the professor drew a hand across his dripping forehead and i fail to see the usefulness of it
explorers always build cairns i cried irritably
then mivabile dictu let us build one set the churs to collecting stones i ordered while i prepare the tablet
he hopped away over the steaming stones and got the churs at work
after a short search i discovered a piece of flat slatelike rock soft enough to take the sharp point of a piece of agate
with great care i scratched the following on the slate tablet at this point during the summer of arrived captain salis and professor phineas prebble having set out from america in the year on a voyage of discovery and exploration
i showed the inscription to prebble you have left out the most important point he cried
what is that
you have said nothing about my own discoveries the proof i have developed regarding the meteoric theory of the aurora add that as a postscript said by way of humoring him
so i appended the following during the progress of the polar expedition said professor prebble demonstrated the truth ot the meteoric theory of the aurora
will that do
i inquired
very well he answered greatly pleased
now if neither of us live to return to our own country and some other explorer is able to come to this benighted region shall have my niche in the hall of fame
but the tablet is still incomplete
the tablet already hadscorched my fingers and was becoming altogether too hot for any more inscriptions
what else is there i asked impatiently
my theory concerning the failure of the human mind north of the arctic circle said he
put that in will not i answered and went down on my knees to affix the eiece of slate in the hot earth
upon this we piled our gathered rocks
i superintended the laying of the stones and considering the difficulties under which we worked i believe that a most excellent cairn was constructed and one that must still remain on that very spot
it was trying labor and we sweated over the task
the churs labored in a state of awe and apprehension pausing constantly to look around them as though they expected something to happen they scarcely knew what
their actions communicated to me a certain uncanny feeling which had begun with the vast mechanism of the pole itself getting nervous confided the professor
we are in a region well qualified to make any one nervous i answered making ready to lay the final stone on the apex of the heap have done with this cairn building captain and move to some other place
we must continue our examination of the pole said greatly regret that we have not the instruments mecessary to make an observation too torrid for observations and weve already lingered here so long that the soles of my feet are literally done to a turn
perhaps we shall never be able to come here again and we ought to make the most of our visit
at the precise moment the final stone was added to the heap my attention was attracted by fearful cries from the churs
i faced about and at once my startled gaze encountered a sight that froze my blood
the veil of smoke dust and flame was parted by a form that plunged through it like a swimmer through the sea separating the red billows with his naked hands
the figure was that of a chur of gigantic proportions his face was the face of the archfiend monstrous in its every feature were like diamonds the teeth long yellow and two of them overhanging the nether liplike tusks the long red hair writhed as so many tongues of fire about head and shoulders and the long furry limbs moved with marvelous rapidity
a whip seemed lashing my brain with stinging force and at every blow the voice of sertez rang in my ears the great ziff
now will you believe
in one hand this hideous giant carried a skull in the other hand a thigh bone
again and again he would strike the skull and a dull sepulchral sound would be the result
as he pounded his horrid drum he would roar in monotonous tones syllables which sounded like then at intervals he would lift the thigh bone and point southward
it must not be supposed that we saw this frightful creature lony
at one leap he cleared the pole and touched earth then away he flew at a brobdingnagian pace pomting southward peating the skull and roaring his i looked at prebble
his head was in his hands
i turned to where the churs had been lyinz and saw that they had departed following the great ziff at top speed
had our series of remarkable adventures in this circumpolar country not hardened us to the improbable and the unexpected prebble and i would have thought ourselves gone daft get out of this said the professor huskily picking up the biscuit and pemmican bag
i grabbed the shotgun irom the rocks scarcely noticing that the barrels blistered my hands
then away we went on the track of the great ziff koz bigoll and xit
what is your present opinion of the great ziff prebble
i asked when we had reached cooler ground and could walk and talk with some little comfort ask me he begged
imagination appears to have taken the place of sober sense
event follows event so swiftly that all seems a riot of the imagination
the scientific mind finds nothing firm enough to stand on and hence all scientific deduction falls flat
i behold and marvel captain i make no attempt to explain
the furies are unleashed said i sadly
nyl will beoverrun and all her magnificent civilization laid waste
the great ziff heads the allied packs and every chur is like a ravening woll
we must hasten back to nyll averred the professor
but what can we do
we can save the kingdom he answered promptly or as much of it as is left when we arrive
how leave that to me
let your care be the rescue of princess ylma
our apprehensions spurred us on to greatest effort
just before we reached the defile from which we had issued o begin our journey to the pole we surmounted an elevation that afforded us a viw of the wall the broken gate and the plaiz beyond
a host of churs was flowing southward
the pcssage through the wall was like a strait the animated billows crushing through and spreading out once more on reaching the sandy stretch as far as the eye could reach the inundation rolled and we had no doubt that in the lead rushed the great ziff sounding his infernal tocsin and roaring his mysterious slogan
thus ignorance overwhelms learning muttered prebble and brute force subdues the mind
let us not halt i cried in herce impatience on prebble on
we could not overtake the procession of warriors but we came among the women and children straggling along in the rear
it was hours before we reached the populous portion of nyll and what a melanholy spectacle greeted us on every hand
houses were burning and the chris were everywhere like the red imps of satan carrying their spoils upon their backs or driving nyllites before them loaded with the loot of their own dwellings
it appeared to have been the policy of the great
zift to spare that the churs might enslave everywhere there was brutality but nowhere could we see bloodshed
as we made along the road toward the kings palace an oyd car came tearing toward us
in the car were two men whom recognized as griffyn and pollock
halt
i commanded placing myself in the middle of the roadway and raising my hand
they did not slacken speed and would have cut me down but for the shotgun raised it to my shoulder and aimed carefully
halt or i fire
i cried agam
this time was obeyed
great heaven cried griffyn as he stopped the car
can this be salis andand prebble say you failed to recognize us i answered
but i did though
what has happened to your no time to talk of ourselves cried we must do something to stem this tide of what can be done
the men of the kingdom are confounded and have fallen easy victims to their oldtime enemies
where are you going griffyn
to the distillery on a mission for princess ylma
ha
where is the princess
locked in a room in the kings palace
what are you going to do
burn that accursed distillery to the ground
you are mad broke in the professor pas sionately
i looked at him in amazement
what do you mean asked griffyn and pollock in one breath
if that distillery had never been built said this awful invasion would never have happened
i leveled a trembling forehnger at responsible for all
you and prebble are responsible flung back pollock
you taught king boazar to use the elixir in the first place
we gave him the flask in order to save our lives
and we spoke up pollock built the distillery to save our own
have done with this wrangling interrupted the professor
we are all of us at fault but we are human life is dear to us and sometimes we buy it at too great a price
have you any elixir on hand pollock
several thousand kisses
any tanks and oyd cars at the distillery
half a dozen at least
then i will go with you and we will save the kingdom he turned on me with a hearty grip of the hand must leave you captain
it is necessary for you have your work to do as i have mine
you remember what his lordship told us about the nyllite who penetrated the ice wall
the work now going on is strictly according to gneisen
shrewd fellow that gneisen
he sprang into the oyd car
similia similibus curantur
to the distillery griffyn top speed
while we had stood in the road talking many
churs passed us but gave us little notice
possibly they were too intent on the nefarious work before them
i journeyed horrors thickening about me as i proceeded
a whir of wheels from behind claimed my attention and i turned just as a familiar voice called my name
a car was darting in iny direction to the broad seat in its center lord nylis was bound and in the front point was kiimon shrieking like a fiend
save me captain implored lord nylis klimon is taking me tothe great ziff
i ordered the rebellious slave to halt
his answer was a defiant yelp fired at him and he tumbled over the iron box into the road closing the screen with his falling body
the car stopped
at once i sprang aboard and tore the ropes from his lordships hands
you have saved me from a fate worse than death captain said his lordship and thank you
suddenly his body stiffened and he eyed me sharply it was reported that you and the professor had gone over to the churs
are you concerned in this raid
ve are concerned in it sir to the extent of trying to save the kingdom answered togoing over to the churs it was cither that or death by oyd
the churs spared us and we have returned to be of all the assistance to king boazar that we can
lord nylis shook his head sadly
you can do nothing i fear the king and ninetenths of the nobles and people have succumbed to your elixir and its baneful effects are everywhere apparent
our powers of mind have suffered eclipse
the kingdom is doomed
the case is hardly as bad as that i hope
the condition of affairs could not be worse
every slave in the country has risen and even the slaves outnumber the nyllites two to one
add their numbers to the horde that has swept down on us from the north and you will understand how desperate is the situation
klimon whom i have owned for years turned on me and was conveyiny me to the great ziff
what for
to present me to him as a slave
horrible
i looked back at the still form in the road
ile will have no further part in the insufrechon i added tried to conquer him with my will but his fanaticism was aroused by the coming of the great ziff and he turned my glances as though clad in armor
he laid his hand on my knee as he asked where is the professor captain
gone to rescue the kingdom i answered
griffyn and pollock are with him
what can they do
they can turn the weapon that has cost you so dear against your enemies
we have a saying in our country that like cures like
if this is true and if the churs take to the elixir and the nyllites abstain from it the country may yet be saved
hope darted into his face had not thought of that he said
but let us on to the palace
i am worried about his lord nylis took the drivers seat and drove the car at full speed along the road
many attempts were made to interfere with us but the shotgun stood us in good stead and we finally reached the palace steps unmolested
the kings guard to the last warrior had turned against count zylox and he had been compelled to barricade himself in one of the state apartments
the count was another of those who had resisted the temptations of the elixir and from one of the palace windows he called down and acquainted us with his predicament
where is the king asked lord nylis
in the throne room
the princess ylma is with him and has barricaded the doors
hark
count zylox raised his hand
can you not hear them he asked
sertez with a score of churs at his back is endeavoring to batter down the doors and capture the king
i will descend and join you
perhaps we may be able to exert our power over some of the slaves and the guard
wait for me in the grand hallway
there were no churs on the steps or in the hallway
all in the vicinity of the palace were helping sertez force entrance into the audience chamber
the count carried a spear and lord nylis picked up another from the floor
what does the foreigner here asked the count vouchsafing me a harsh look
cherish no animosity count said his lordship
the captain is truly our friend
his companion the professor has gone to save the kingdom
how
there is no time for explanations
let it suffice for you to know that this man is my friend and has recently preserved me from my enemies
the thunder machine he carries is to stand us in good stead
to the throne room count before it is too late
we started forthwith the sound of a heavy blow and a crash accelerating our steps a wild scream cchoed through the apartments
the princess cried the count beginning to run
they have demolished the doors gasped his lordship
presently we flung into the vast chamber
the sun was gleaming through the windows and reflecting a fiery color from the bloodred tiles of the floor
backward and forward as in a crimson tide swerved the hairy seminude forms of the churs
their yelping tones the clashing of their implements of war caused a deafening din in the room king boazar occupied the massive chair on the dais
his hands hung listlessly over the arms and his head was bowed forward it might have been an attitude of sorrow and despair but attributed it to another causc
before him at the top ol the short flight of steps stood princess ylma her eyecs glowing and lier arms outspread to block the advance of sertez
the renegade stood below his oot on the first step and his gloating gaze turned upward
nothing can keep us apart now ylmal he cried have leveled every barrier that stood between us
except one she qualified gazing at him scornfully
what is that my loathing for you sertez
a mocking laugh rang from his lips shall level that my ladytrample it underfoot along with the foolish pride that has made you look down on me
you are to be mine my princess mine he started to mount the steps
i was almost upon him but count zylox was a little in advice of me
catching sertez about the neck with one arm the count hurled him backward
the renevade saved himself a fall by clutching at one of the churs
he whirled about gripping his spear and fixed his glaring eves on count zylox
the count returned the olare with steady intensity
our entrance into the throne room had been silently made and we had reached the foot of the dais almost before our presence was discovered
these churs happened to be from the pack of koz
thus i was known to them and the terrors of the thunder maker which i carried threw over them a spell of silence and inaction
princess ylma was gazing at me as though she dared not credit her senses
facing lord nylis i exchanged the shotgun for his spear and crept closer to sertez and count zylox
traitor cried the count
your lying lips have given insult to the daughter of your sovereign am a banished man i have no sovereign
nor will you have any country but hell when i am done with you
cross spears with me if you dare
the count was a man after my own heart
he showed a spirit that aroused my admiration and i was sorry he was not a friend of mine
sertez sprang to the fray with a laugh and a taunt the count met him bravely and spear struck spear
then it was thrust parry thrust parrynow high now lowthe spear heads shimmering as they darted toward each other like serpents count forcing sertez back step by step and again sertez pressing the count
there was a monotony about it all in spite of the fascination which a battle to the death will always call forth
but the monotony was suddenly varied
sertez leaned forward like lightning
i advice is spear pointfell rose and there was a reddish stain marring thebrightness of a muttered anathema the count caught the haft of his weapon in his left hand and continued the battle his right ari hanging limp at his side i tried to press forward and draw the attention of sertez
one at a time cried the renegade back commanded the count fiercely
no man shall rob me of the pleasure of runningf this traitor through the heart
i was eagerto be at sertez for ve liad a score to settle on account of that little affair in the cave still i could not insist on displacing the count
the combat went on
zylox fought at a terrible disadvantage as was apparent to all of us and from the throne princess ylma watched with breathless lips and pallid cheeks
the stertorous breathing of the king came to our ears through the dead silence and now and again he would move restlessly and mutter incoherently once more there was the monotony of thrust and parry above below and clash clash as the spear heads met and sent ringing echoes through the vaulted chamber
a diversion came and came quickly
the count slipied on the jasper tiles and went down his weapon flying from his hmd a slight seream escaped princess ylma
with a cry of triumph sertez plunged at his opponents breast but struck the long shaft aside thereby earning curses from both sertez and the count then sertez and i went at it
the renegade was not as fresh as i was but on the contrary he had not the same unpracticed hand which i was compelled to use
a repetition of the previous performance was begun
i was more awkward than the count however
every moment was a close shave for me but after some fashion i bungled out of the traps set for my prentice skill
i fought blindly persistently pressing my foe at every point in spite of the perilous play of his spear head
i remembered only the insult in the cave and even forgot that the eyes of the princess were upon me swish
i had caught a chiseling blow in the shoulder
a scream reminded me of the presence of princess yima
lord nylis end this she cried beg you save the strangers life
hands off your lordship
i shouted
you donot know what i owe this fellow
sertez was at me again cool diabolical wearing a crafty smile
by now there was blood on the floor
i retreated coaxing him over the pool
he followed
i sank to one knee presenting my spear point
ie slipped as i had anticipated
but he did not fall backward as i believed he would
he pitched forward upon my weapon and it impaled him to the heart
prone on the floor he lay the long shaft clinging to his breast
as we stood over him an appalling sound floated to us from the distant corridor
poom poom poom
the churs dropped in a flash
zylox nylis and i sprang to the throne steps and ranged ourselves abreast for the defense of the king and princess ylma
i had no spear but i picked up the one wielded by sertez gave it to his lordship and took from him the gun
the great ziff whispered the count hoarsely
he will excite these churs to frenzy muttered lord nvlis
supposing he were killed asked
that at one blow would settle the insurrection declared the count
but he canot be killed supplemented
is lordship
we shall sec i responded
the next moment the hideous giant bounded into the chamber beating his eruesome druny and roaring his horrid war cry deculiarities of the zi pecu the ziff
princess ylma sank to her knees with her face in her hands
the king roused himself and staggered to his feet his bleared eves resting on the monster
there he cried see them
see what asked the count little boys in the red caps
ha
take em away on my back on my head holding my arms dragging me down
have i any loyal subjects left
the monsters the creeping things thethe with a gurgling cry his majesty dropped back into the throne chair thrashing his arms wildly
the princess sprang up and threw her arms about his neck protectingly
poom poom poom echoed the grinning skull roared the great ziff and pointed the thigh bone at the king
the churs sprang erect
now captain if you can do anything whispered his lordship frantically now
the giant was advancing upon the throne
in a trice i raised the gun and gave him hoth barrels
the roar in that confined space was awful beyond words
as the smoke cleared we saw the great ziff sprawled on the floor
we gazed am telling what i beheld with my own eyeseven as we looked his form faded into thin air so that we saw nothing but the bloodred tiles
and then from without we heard the sepulchral sounds of bone and skull and the roar of the ziff as strong as ever
the churs rushed from the throne room and from the palace while the count his lordship and i hastened to one of the windows
there this colossal creature stood gathering his cohorts unharmed in body or limb
i was sorry the professor was not a witness of this proceeding for he afterward told me i must have been frightened out of my wits so that fear colored my account of the extraordinary event
those who have followed me so far i trust will know me better than that the palace doors cried count zylox
we three will hold the place against the invaders
we hurried to follow out his suggestion
after every door had been secured we looked down from a lofty window and to our infense surprise found that the great ziff and his followers had left the vicinity of the palace
we are safe for the present said lord nylis heaving a sigh of relief
the ziff will return averred the count
until he does went on his lordship turning to me there will be little for you to do captain
if you would like to go to the lavatory and make a change of garments i will be glad to conduct you
he made the suggestion out of the kindness of his heart and i was grateful to him for it in truth i was a sorrylooking representative of the united states army as i stood before him
i still wore what remained of my buskins but they were the sole relics of my former state
in the land of the churs prebble and i had both donned the prevailing bearskin and while mine covered me from shoulders to knees and was respectable enough yet it was hardly a court even for those trying times
while i was engaged in making myseli more presentable lord nylis from an adjoining room beguied my labors with conversation knew we should hear from sertez in some such maunner said he
who is this sertez
i inquired scoundrel and a renegade have discovered that much for myself your lordship
i have also learned that he has been among the churs since the beginning of the long day
he was banished
yes
that was a mistake however
mistake in this way captain he should have been condemned to death by oyd instead of merely being banished
count zylox and i were anxious to see him receive the death penalty but princess ylma prevailed with the king and sentence of banishment was pronounced
i was washing the red stain from my shoulder
the wound was merely a scratch and in no wise interfered with my uscfulness fagerly i caucht at his lordships mention of the princess why did the princess interfere in behalf of sertez i queried
that trenches upon the matter for which sertez was sent away was the reply
there is no reason why i should not tell you about it captain
you have becn of great service to the king and the princess md the kingdom is under a vast obligation to you shall be glad to hear about it said sertez his lordship went on was made much of by king boazar
the fortune of sertez was small but wealth is no bar to advancement in the kingdom of nyll
his majesty conceived a liking for sertez and took him into the palace as one of the gentlemen in waiting
the possession of twenty churs entitles a nyllite to a patent of nobility for in the old times to rule a score of churs one proved the possession of a powerful intellect and intellect alone admitted to the peerage
one who aspired to be a noble was required to capture his churs with his own hands and subdue them
sertez with great bravery won his twenly slaves and was taken into the palace as one of the kings houschold
his lordship paused for a moment had little time to dwell upon the peculiar abilities necessary before one could become a noble of that queer kingdom
once in the palace proceeded lord nylis sertez had the presumption to lift his eyves to the princess
thus in a way he proved himself a serpent and struck at the hand which fed him
princess ylma is designed by the king as a mate for count zylox thus welding the two branches of the royal family together and averting discord when the time comes for the king to pass
sertez is that right lord nylis
i demanded
should the king use his power to consummate such an alliance
is not princess ylma to have a choice in the matter princesses of the blood captain came sadly from his lordship are but pawns inthe game of royalty
their lots are cast wherever policy may elect
in this case and i quite coincide with his majesty the two branches of the roval family must be united
from what i have said about the kings plans for his daughter vou will understand more clearly the presumption of sertez in aspiring to the hand of the princess
she repulsed him and placed the matter before the king
i majesty was enraged and summoned sertez before him to answer for his actions
sertez was found guilty and condemned to death by oyd
princess ylma interfered and the sentence was commuted to banishment
the princess should not have interfered said most assuredly not but she has a tender heart and could not bear to think that sertez was to suffer death on her account
it is all one with sertez now lord nylis
he was spared to plan with the churs the destruction of the kingdom bu his end has finally overtaken him
the evil has been accomplished commented lord with a heavy sigh and it will be long before my country recovers from the blow
it is a lesson to your country said it should teach all of you to beware of anything indulgence in which will tend to becloud your faculties did not know the powers of this elixir
for which the pfofessor and i are guilty
i acknowledge the debt we owe your people nylis and we are doing what we can to atone for our misguided actions lay nothing at your door captain
you and your companion had to do something to preserve your lives and you took the readiest means at hand am hopeful as you say that my country will profit by the grievous lesson
do you think the professor will succeed in his am positive of it said with conviction
prebble is an able man and when he sets his hand to a piece of work he usually accomplishes it
the elixir is a weapon that works both ways
savages are especially partial to it
the churs are not gifted with the reasoning powers of the will easily fall victims to the insidious beverage
you and your people on the other hand will profit by the lesson and abstain from such elixirs in future
the easiest way to make us abstain is to remove the elixir from among us
the place where it is manufactured must be destroyed at the earliest possible moment
that will be attended to
is the process of manufacture known to any of the yllites no pollock and griffyn have kept the process a secret good
i exclaimed
before another hour had passed i felt a different man
tmmediately after emerging from the lavatory and dressing chamber i repaired to the throne room
princess ylma was still beside the king who was recovering slightly and calling for more of the elixir
the moment i entered she descended and came toward me with outstretched hands
the count as observed had thoughtfully dragged the body of sertez rom the apartment and only the stains of blood remained to mark the spot where the sanguinary struggle had taken place
save for the king we were alone the princess and i caught her hands and held them for a moment peering into her wonderful hlue cyes
a knew you would come she said softly her lids drooping and the color coming and going in her full round cheeks came quickly my princess said but could not arrive before the churs
you are a stranger she said flashing a quick look at me and i cannot be your princess
neverthelessx i returned dropping on one knee and pressing her hands to my lips you are my princess and must call you so
she raised me gently was told that you would not be able to learn the secrets of the gorr plate she proceeded as i stood at her side learned them i answered not thinking it necessary to describe the means
then am i bling she hesitated her lips are ever in my heart i whispered
and you think of me in the same manner that i think of you
yes i replied
lver since you saved my companion and myself at the lake you have never been absent from either mind or heart
a lover must be allowed some latitude even at the pole where latitude is stretched to its farthest limit
she withdrew her hands quickly
turning she made her way back to the throne and sat on the steps
come she said making a place beside her
i wish to ask you if you and your companion can be of any aid to this poor country in its present plight
we shall do our best to save the country was my response and i believe that success will attend our efforts
the professor is now engaged in the work griffyn and pollock are with him
nothing can be done she declared with spirit this elixir is destroyed to the last drop
i have given orders for the burning of the building in which it is made
the professor countermanded your orders
her eyes flashed
why she asked imperiousuy
because although it has been the means of bringing woe and unhappiness to nyll it may yet be employed in saving the country
the elixir is a good servant but a bad master
how may the elixir be employed
let the churs partake of it and it will render them helpless
then the nyllites may rise conquer the savages and resume their use of the elixir she interrupted sorrowfully
no
after the churs have been conquered then burn the distillery and let every keese of the elixir be poured on the ground
she clapped her hands and a joyful look overspread her face
but the joy was shortlived
and then she resumed the king will order the other strangers to build a new distillery as they call it and they will have to comply in order to save their lives
princess returned our poor lives have been the cause of all this misery
had the professor and i not valued our existence so highly the king would never have tasted the contents of that first flask nor would the second flask have been given him nor would the distillery have been built
are you sure he will demand more of the elixir when he recovers reason and sees what direful consequences have followed its use the taste is strong upon him he drinks the brown fluid continually am sure he will order more of it
in that event said i grimly griffyn the professor and must leave the country where will you go she asked tremulously
back to our own land
beyond the ice wall her hand crept toward mine and caught it clingingly
yes
will there not be danger in the attempt suppose so was my glum rejoinder
will you not dread to face it her cheek was close to mine her starvy eyes fixed upon my own and burning with a light that thrilled me
i placed my other hand about her waist shall dread facing the danger much less than leaving the princess ylma
she sighed
tell me of your own country she sard
is it a wonderful land like ours
in some ways more wonderful but in others less so
we have no gorr plates no oyd cars no kings no princesses but we have our ziffs many of them and all fully as terrible as the one we have lately seen
do they not destroy the minds of the people
the brown fluid does that then come the ziffs
does the ziff bring his churs
we have no churs princess
every man is his own chur
these shaggy monsters skulk in the trail of the brown fluid and battle with the mans better self until the ziff comes and finishes the work
she shuddered should not like your country she said
onlys if you were there even such a land might be paradise for me
the words were still on her lips as i plucked the last one with a kiss you scoundrel count zylox
the princess pushed from me with a ittle cry and we both looked up to find the captain of the guard regarding us with a scowl
i arose haughtily cannot forget that i am in the presence of a lady said or i should answer your speech in kind
eavesdroppers rarely hear anything to their liking
you introduce a curse into the land sneered the count and after destroying the people you attempt the destruction of the kings only daughter so liar
i cried
his base insinuations were too much for my hot blood
i launched myself toward him and had not the princess interfered would have taught him a lesson then and there
the kings daughter was between us hands fell and i stepped back
your pardon princess ylma murmured
aly at somie other time and in some other place he shall yield me satisfaction for his words
he shall not she returned a very queen in speech and bearing shall prove your manhood by ignoring a man who forgets himself as count zylox has done
she faced the count desire you to leave this room
there aie other things to command your attention at the present moment
nothing more imiportant than this he answered
she bent her eyes upon his steadily
withdraw she commanded
for the first time i saw that the count had the shotgun in his hands
let him first give me that weapon princess ylma i requested
take it said the count savagely and flung it with all the force of his left arm down on the tiles
the piece was broken beyond repair
my heart sank for i had counted on using the gun in defense of the palace should we be attacked
as the count turned on his heel a loud commotion was heard at the palace entrance
he hurried away and i started to follow
promise me before you go said princess yima that you will not renew this quarrel promise said and hastened on
we were unnecessarily alarmed by the noise on the palace steps
the great ziff had not returned with the churs but pollock had come with an oyd car and a tank of elixir
he reported that prebble griffyn and himself had started in different directions through the kingdom each with a large quantity of the brown fluid
this was being judiciously distributed among the churs
they are wild atter the stuff said pollock and are casting aside their loot their shields and spears and even allowing their prisoners to escape so that they may drink more and more of the fire water
in twentyfour hours if the nyllites will rise nyll will be theirs once more
pollock left after being reassured as to the safety of the king and the princess
i ran back to the throne room to acquaint the princess with the progress of the good work but the apartment was deserted
since there was rfo danger to threaten i threw myself down in one of the reclining rooms to rest after the exciting events of the last few hours
worn out i fell asleep
when i awoke i was not in the reclining room
all around me was blackest darkness and a dank smell as from moldy walls
what had happened to me
i dashed my hand across my face to free my brain from the evil spell that seemed to encompass it
still the darkness would not lift
was i mad
i reached out on either side
on my right space on my left a blank slippery wall
i felt below
i was lying on a slab of stome
staggering erect i groped my way aimlessly about
presently i came to another wall
turning i paced to the wall opposite
twenty paces
detween walls the other way i also counted twenty paces
then i climbed upon the block of stone and reached upward my fingers touching the roof
under me around above nothing but granite
sitting down on the slab i bowed my head in my hands was a prisoner there was no doubt of that
but how had they been able to carry me off without waking me
i am not a heavy sleeper and the croon of a rope through an oil sheave has more than once sent me from niy bunk
i smelled an odor strange to my nostrils
abh i had been drugged
resistance was feared and these men who were wide awake for six months of the year had taken advantage of me in my sleep and drugged and imprisoned me
it was zylox of course
he had seen me with the princess had heard our conversation and it had increased his enmity toward me
he was a brave man and had the good of the kingdom at heart
but brave men are weakest when struck on the side of their affections
he loved the princess and she cared nothing for him
he would not brook interfence on my part and death was to be my portion
i wondered how long an interval had passed since i lay down in the reclining room
i also thought of prebble and wondered if he had succeeded in saving the klingdom what would he do when he heard that i was a prisoncr
what could he do
possibly he would not hear
no doubt i was in the stronghold of count zylox where i conld be dealt with at my enemys pleasure
and the princess
would she ever know my fate
as i sat there with bowed head a door opened raspingly and light struck across the gloom looked up and saw the count entering accompanied by four armed churs
i sprang erect and rushed toward him but two spears crossed front of my breast and stayed mec
keep your distance said the count
is there a spark of honor or manhood about you i cried
will you not orant me the satisfaction one gentleman may yield another face to face would not soil my hands fighting coward
he smiled ith you caged rat may rage at a lion said he coolly
where am in a dungeon of the kings palace
why am i here lese majesty
high treason
i exclaimed trumpedup charge zylox
no stranger in the country can commit treason
no but he can do worse and plan odious things
i trembled with anger
tt is not the part of a brave man to taunt a prisoner unable to defend himself said then donot force me with your questions
does the king know i am here
you are here by his orders
then you have poisoned his mind against me have simply told him the truth and he has drawn his own conclusions
what is to be done with me
what should have been done when you and your comrade first showed yourselves in the land
he added laconically death by oyd
i sank down on the stone slab
when
i asked after a moment
in two hours
where
here in this cell
my impending doom strange as it may seem had a quieting effect upon my nerves
what of the kingdom i asked
it and will live to the end of time under the reign of the almikboazars
the churs are all enslaved and the great ziff has fled to the unknown
heaven be praised for that
the professor was successful in his attempt to save the land
the weapon that wrought the havoc was turned upon our foes
small credit to this professor of yours
he and you introduced the evil so it was his business to stamp it out if he could
he is safe
i asked
yes he and the other two
they will be given safe conduct to the ice wall
i they return to the country your fate will be theirs
leave me in peace said will you have more peace with a light he sneered have brought you one
one of the slaves carried two luminous globes
at a signal from the count he laid one of the globes on the floor said zylox with a grim laugh a hours and passed out with his attendants
the door was secured and again left alone
the light however made my situation more endurable
even when confronted by death a mans mind will deal with trivial things
i marveled at the luminous globe for it was not fed with oil nor had it a wick
it resembled a sphere of glass but if it was glass it was the first specimen of it i had seen in nyll
i walked to the globe bent over it and picked it up
something white lay under it
hastily i put down the globe and possessed myself of the object
it was a bit of folded linen
i unfolded it and found that it bore queer marks upon its surface made with a yellow pigment long and earnestly i studied the marks but could make nothing of them
i turned the square of linen upside down and still the characters were not legible
suddenly a thought struck me and i removed the talk ring
i had found the key to the situation for the words were written in english and of course i could not read them while thinking in nyll keep a stiff upper lip captain
your friends have not abandoned you will be with you presently
the note was unsigned but i knew it must come from prebble
the light bearer had been bribed to lay down the note with the glohe
hope revived in my breast although for the life of me i could not understand how getting out of the dungeon would save me from impending doom
after escaping from the palace i would still have to leave the kingdom and to do that unseen in the broad glare of that long day would be impossible
for some time i continued to rack my brain with doubts
then again came the creak of the door and prebble stood before me
he also was cladin a new tunic and through the lenses of his spectacles his eyes beamed encouragingly
i rushed to him and caught him by both hands
prebble
i exclaimed
how have vou managed to come tome lord nylis requested it of the king as a personal favor he answered
the king is determined on my death he is adamant
if that flask of bourbon is to be blamed for it it is strange the rest of vou are not here with me
it is not on account of the flask of bourbon captain
the rest of us have not dared to make love to princess yima
then as i expected zylox is the moving force agamst me
not only zylox but the whole lord nylis
he regrets the occurrence but you have made him your friend and he stands by you
what of the princess
i smiled
she stands by you too and there have been stormy times in the palace the princess entreating her father to spare you and her father only wishing you had nine lives like a cat so he could take them all
you have committed a very heinous offense captain
l could not help it nor would i have helped it if i could like you
but i must not squander anything so valuable as time at the present moment
plans have been made to rescue you
to get me out of the palace
yes
what will they avail
suppose i do get out of the palace what then
must i hide myself somewhere until the long night while all nyll sleeps hardly
griffyn has constructed a new balloon constructed a balloon
i gasped
that is it
he has made it out of a royal cloth woven from thread spun byspiders
griffyn has really done remarkably well
the structure used as a distillery formed his workroom and while he was ostensibly assisting pollock in the manu facture of spirits he was really constructing this airship
he utilized what materials he could take from the wreck of the old balloon and the result is most creditable
the bag is now being inflated in an open space near where the distillery used to be
the gin mill has been burned to the ground you know and there is not a drop of elixir to be had anywhere in the kingdom
will griffyn feeling as he does toward us take us with him
i inquired doubtfully
misfortune has drawn us all together captain and feelings toward you have undergone a hange
besides i insured our assage in the agreement
what agreement balloon is not of much use without gas
griffyn could make the balloon but he could not make the gas
i have done that in return for the privilege of our being allowed to go with him in the airship
and the balloon is beinr inflated you say
it will be ready for uce by the time we are ready to use it
but i am to meet my fate within two hours
he laughed
so you are but not in the way you imagine
now listen captain shortly after i leave a slave will come to you with food
when he goes out you will accompany him
he understands and there will be notrouble
when you part from the chur some one else will take you in charge
that is all
it is thought that i have come to say good by to you so i must ng or suspicion will be aroused not hnfrer too lo said do everything i am told to do pfessmg hand
prebble went away and i paced the confines of the dungeon impatiently while waiting for the chur with whom i was to depart
he came in due course nervous to a degree and frightened almost out of his wits by the part he was plaving
through damp and tortuous underground passages i was conducted until it seemed as though we had traversed several miles of labyrinth
when we reached the end we were at a flight of stone steps leading upward
the chur ascended the steps and pushed at an iron door
after some effort he succeeded in throwing the door open and daylight penetrated the gloom
as the slave stood on the topmost step i saw hands reach over and lay a golden chain around his neck
his face quivered with joy and he kissed the hands before they were withdrawn
then he beckoned me and stood aside while i passed up and out
the exit let me out of doors grove stretched around me and i could see no one not even the person who had conferred the gold necklace upon the chur
i turned to question the slave by signs but he had disappeared covered the spot where i had gained the surface from below and so nicely was the door fitted into the turf that no eye could detect its presence
as i stood waiting i heard a soft voice captain
behind me stood princess ylma having just stepped out from among the trees
i hurried to her caught her in my arms and pressed my lips to hers was not expecting you ylma i said
did you think i would abandon you she returned a surprised look on her face
no nonot that
i was sure you could do nothing
the professor in fact told me how hard you had labored with the ling and how unsuccessful you were
my father was very unkind to me she said with trembling lip
he does not appreciate what you and the professor have donefor the kingdom
we wrought the evil ylma and it was our duty to repair it as well as we could
his majesty owes us nothing on that score
but where are we
had i not better be hastening to the airship
are you so anxious to leave me then she pouted wish that i might never leave you
i answered fervently am forsaking nyll for the good of the kingdom you understand
we talked of it in the throne room understand said she with mock pathos that i would not abandon you but that you willingly abandon me
how ungrateful captain
not willingly dearest i insisted
you would not have me stay when all the people except yourself and lordnylis are crying for my blood because i hesitated
because she finished vou have dared to love the princess
yes i proceeded
and i would willingly barter one hour of happiness with the princess for this death by oyd
if you say so dear one no no she whispered placing one small hand over my lips do not say so
forgive me if i tease you captain
these are the palace gardens and we are not more than a stones throw from the lake where i saved your life so many many hours ago lord nylis is coming for us with an oyd car and we are to remain here and listen for his signal
until we hear the signal we may talk hope the signal will be long in coming said as she led me to a stone seat
you realize do you not that we are parting forever
no she returned cannot realize it captain must realize it ylma i persisted
it will be beyond my power to return here
i trust the sacrifice am making for this kingdom will long be remembered
it is costing me more than i can tell you
then why make the sacrifice captain she murmured leaning against me and looking up into my eyes
her mood perplexed me
there was no understanding her
there must be a sacrifice yima whatever i do said if i leave the country i sacrifice you if i yield up my life
i will do as you tell me my princess
shall i go or stay
you must neither leave me nor remain here said she enigmatically then she laughed in my bewildered face
is this airship of yours captain unable to carry one more
why may not princess ylma go with you
ylima
i cried and caught her to my breast
you would leave your kingdom your father all for me
my happiness lies with you dear she answered simply
if i remained here i should be unhappy
your people shall be my people your country my country
it is you then who are making the sacrifice said i fondly
neither of us shall make a sacrifice she replied
do you not know that i am promised to count zylox a man i loathe and abhor
my father has a will of iron and is determined to unite the two royal houses of nyll
you are to be slain and immediately afterward while your blood is still red on the counts hands our nuptials are to be celebrated
can you imagine amore horrible fate
by leaving my country with you i shall be the happiest woman in the world
life was bright for me then
not only had i discovered the north pole but i had won a bride the fairest and most lovable of women
while we sat there and talked a voice called from a distance
his lordship exclaimed ylma starting to her teet
come she added catching my hand
lord nylis is taking desperate chances to aid us
the chur who brought you through the ve won his freeunderground passages to the gro dom but we can only requite lord nylis by giving him our love and gratitude
together we hurried toward the road
as we pushed through the bushes we saw an oyd car drawn up and waiting for us
the car contained but one passenger who muffled to the eyes in a white robe sat in the drivers seat
is the coast clear your lordship
i asked
he nodded
what you are doing for us in this hour i went on shall never forget
i was standing beside the oyd car assisting ylma to mount
suddenly the muffled figure uprose and cast aside the cloak
it was not lord nylis at all but zylox
ylma screamed and the count struck at me savagely with a short sword forget he cried
up churs
this way guard
the captain of theguard had every advantage and it is a wonder he did not cleave me to the chin with his sword
ylma dropped on the seat of the oyd car and i jumped back the sword grazing my arni
meantime the churs began pouring into the road from among the trees before and hehind the car
zylox baffled in his attempt to cut me down stood looking at me the sword in his left hand
well it was he shouted that we discovered the plot of lord nylis to help you
but you are not out of the country yet and you shall not leave this spot alive
in the breast of my tunic was the little silver box with the gorr plate sent to me in the land of the churs by princess ylma
i treasured it above diamonds and rubies but i saw immediately that i must part with it
drawing it forth i poised it a second in my hands and then hurled it at the count
it struck him in the forehead and he threw up his hands and fell backward from the car
the sword left his grasp and dropped clattering into the roadway secured it in a flash leaped aboard the car drew up the screen and wielded the tiller with my left hand and the sword with my right
like an arrow from a bowstring we darted away mowing a swath through the ranks of the churs
leaning over the fofward point of the vehicle i slashed furiously with the blade
in almost less time than it takes to tell of it we had left zylox and his detachment of the guard far behind
this is awful awful moaned ylma
if we could have helped it ylma i answered l would have been happy
the count discovered your plans in some way and took his lordships place in the oyd car
there are several cars pursuing us said my companion
have we far to go
i asked drawing out the screen and giving the car more speed
only a little way
there
ahead of us is the airship
a low hill bare of trees lay directly before us
on the crest of the hill arose the fzur ruined walls of distillery and near the walle was the huge swaying bulk of the balloon
in the sunlight the great globe looked like frosted silver
about the basket i could see the forms of prebble griffyn and pollock looking down on us with frantically waving arms
what was the matter with them i was asking myself
certainly the mere excitement attending our flight and pursuit could not cause such strange actions on their part
presently the road angled to the right and when we dashed around we came upon six oyd cars drawn up abreast of each other across our path
there was no getting between the cars and no swerving to right or left to pass them
thick woods flanked each side of the way
in order to avoid a wreck i was forced to draw to a halt
tn the name of the king shouted a voice as a man arose in one of the cars that confronted us
the whir and rumble of the other cars could be heard advancing upon us from behind
tost exclaimed ylma a heartbreaking tone
all is lost captain
a in that dread moment when as ylma said all seemed lost i cast a quick look upward toward the hilltop where the balloon was swaying
prebble was executing a war dance and peinting with his hand toward the roadside
i understood then that we were to leave the car and take to the woods
not lost i panted springing to the ground the sword gripped tightly in my right hand
come
we will gain the hill if heaven so wills it or i shall die making the attempt
her courage rose grandly to the occasion and she leaped lightly to my side
do you think there is hope she asked
while there is life there is always hope
with hands clasped we hurried into the deep shadow of the woods
we were within spear throw but none of the ugly darts was iaunched at us
me they were willing enough to spear but the princess was at my side and none dared risk a throw them ordered a voice rescue the princessnot a hair of her head must be injuredbut slay the foreign devilslay him
slay the foreign devil
slay him shouted other voices
laster faster panted yima
oh captain canot you go faster
i was running my best and dragging her after me
she was sobbing breathlessly but urging me to swifter pace at every bound
from behind us came a triumphant cry
i pauscd turned and saw that a chur had overtaken us
warding a spear thrust with one hand i passed the sword through his body and whirled to renew our flizht
ylma overcome with fear and fatipue had fallen i can go no farther captain she cried throwiny her arms around my nceck convulsively
leave me
save yourself
tf i go yima i answered you go with then i picked her up in my arms and ran orn blindly
we were ascending the hill now
there was no timber and we were in plain view of our pursuers
but still no spears were thrownthe danger to the princess was too great
a hundred yards more and we would be at the balloon
could i make it
the churs were bounding up the hillside from rock to rock coming closer and closer at every spring
the sweat stood out on my forehead in great drops my heart pounded furiously and i could hear the roar of rushing blood in my ears
another of the churs was right at my heels
then i perceived that griffyn and pallock were beside me
a lusty righthander from pollock laid the chur in his tracks
let me help you captain said griffyn
between us we bore ylma the remaining distance and placed her in the basket
in with you cried prebble sake hurry
the professor was standing on the rim of the basket knife in hand waiting to cut the rope that held the balloon to earth
i was thrown into the basket by griffyn who piled in after me
prebble cut the rope and we shot skyward with pollock clinging to the edge of the car
i looked over and downward
nyll and the nyllites were receding rapidly
as i gazed the churs hurled an impetent shower of spears which fell far short of us
zylox was below and his was the last face i saw
its expression of hate and baffled rage was awful to behold
as his figure faded and blurred on my sight he was shaking his fist upward at the mounting airship
saved cried prebble jubilantly told you that when you left the dungeon captain you would meet your fate
ylma smiled and held out her hand to me did not think of your words in this light said taking the little hand in mine think the lot of us have had a time of it said griffyn
so we have my hearty i returned well that ends well may i look over captain asked ylma
certainly you may said and i held my arm about her while she took a final look at her country and her people
when she turned to mea moment later there was a smile of joy on her lips and tears of sorrow in her eyes
the wind favors our return southward said griffyn
if nothing unforeseen happens we shall reach the land beyond the ice wall before the griffyn paused
he could not calculate the ienzth of time that would be required for crossinz the kingdom and the frozen plains beyond
l can make no guess about the length of time necessary to place us in comfort and safety said he but the present breeze seems to be as strong or stronger than the wind that carrizd us north
how many hours were you in the air on the other occasion inquired prebble
it was twentyfive hours professor
from the time we left the spot where the balloon was inflated until pollock and i landed in the parachute
then by tomorrow if this wind holds and nothing goes wrong with the gas bag we should be among the settlements said i yes nodded griffyn donot think anything will go wrong with the balloon
it hasbeen strongly constructed and if the professor has furnished us with a good brand of gas we should make a landall safely and quickly
you and the professor have done exceedingly well griffyn said approvingly
the englishman laughed
our lives depended on our efforts and you may be sure that we labored like a lot of bally slaves
we tried to think of everythingfood water ballast and good warm clothing against our passage over the ice fields had not had time as yet to note the equipment of the car
now however i took occasion to look around me and found that we were snugly ensconced amony many packages regret exceedingly said i that we were obliged to resort to so much violence in getting away
the nyllites and the churs got their whack returned griffyn easily
our lives were at stake salis and we could not be expected to stand on ceremony
his voice took on a note of reproach as he added your affection for the was hardly wise
but for that there would have been no violence and no trouble
you will kindly leave the princess out of the question i answered him sharply maintain however said he steadily that it is well that we left your princess behind that i demanded thinking i had not heard aright
it would have been a calamity for all concerned had you brought princess ylma away with you
nyll is her home and the nyllites are her people
she would not thrive in a foreign land and to spirit her away was hardly the fair thing for the kingdom
i stared at the man
he could talk in that inexplicable strain with the princess in the car with us
from him i turned to the professor
my dear captain said prebble commiseratingly i am quite of opmion
we did well to leave princess ylma behind she was unhurt in spite of the violent scenes you both passed through and let us hope she will soon forget you and turn a more favoring cye upon zylox
i turned to look toward the place where the princessmy princesswas standing
she smiled brightly at me and i whirled upon the professor and griffyn
are you mad i shouted
or am you talk of leaving the princess behind when she is here with us in plain view of all of you
speak ylma
i asked looking around at her
it is quite true captain ylma answered softly am with you and shall always be with you
there
i exclaimed triumphantly
griffyn and prebble merely smiled at mesmiled tolerantly and kindly trust with all my heart said prebble i ill will come to nylis for the aid he gave s
he has powerful friends at court spoke up the princess and his lordship cannot be harmed
to my anger and surprise no one in the car aside from myself paid any attention to the princess words
i began to experience a bewderlng sensation a sensation which filled me with an astonishment that remains even to this day
i stepped to the side of ylma spoke to her i tried to touch her with my hand
where she had stood she was not the words i addressed to her received no answer the hand i put forth touched only space
where is she shouted angrily
what have you done with her
griffyn
prebble
what has become of princess ylma
i was angry for felt that some trick had been played upon me
in my bewilderment and wrath i laid hands upon griffyn
instantly he and prebble and pollock seized me in a fierce grip and while the car swayed with the struggle i was borne down upon the bales and packages doubled up in the confined space and held by sheer force
was the victim of a plot
what plot could there be which prebble always loyal could take part against me
suddenly a weight seemed lifted
something snapped in my brain or else the two ends of a mental chain were reunited with a flashing as of live wires
my anger fell from me and my lifted hands dropped nerveless
what are you men trying to do
i mnqured
thank heaven exclaimed prebble
lie will be all right now griffyn
let hin sleep
and somehow i did sleep
i have now come to a part of this chronicle which has always been a mystery to me
the events surrounding the escape from the land of nyll and especially those which have to do with the princess at that time have faded into the wraek left by a weirdand in many respects a delightfuldream
when i opened my eyes after falling asleep in the car i experienced a disagreeable feeling of cold and discomfort
griffyn prebble and pollock swathed in heavy garments were releasing bags of ballast with their mittened hands
have we ballast enough
i heard prebble inquire think so professor griffyn answered
you see i had counted upon the effect the frigid air over the ice fields would have on the gas in the envelope
the only way to counteract the loss of buoyancy was by hurling ballast out of the car
therefore i made the balloon large and equipped it with plenty of sandbags
where is the princess demanded sitting up
pollock had as little interest in me as i had inhim
he kept to his work without paying the slightest attention griffyn and prebble however faced around and gave me encouraging smiles
if you donot feel warm enough captain said prebble wrap another bearskin around you
this climate is vastly different from that of nyll
but where is the princess
i persisted
safely in the palace i make no doubt and i hope there is peace between her and her father and that count zylox is finding favor
he is a worthy gentleman in spite of the fact that we had our differences and he deserves the best of fortune
i looked around the car confused and wonder ing knocked zylox off his lordships car with the gorr plate i observed was when we found him waiting for us instead of lord nylis
it was no insignificant blow i can tell you
the professor cackled
then captain you have left with him a memento said he
probably he will not treasure it will you not tell me what has become of the princess begged passing a mittened hand over my brows
you remember bounding up the rocks carrying princess ylma in your arms asked the professor remember that yes i answered eagerly
and do you remember that griffyn and pollock came to your rescue just as a chur had knocked you flat with a blow from behind remember about griffyn and pollock but i was not struck down by the chur
blank astonishient crossed the professors face
i proceeded to recite the progress of events from that point
it was pollock who bowled over the chur
then griffyn helped me carry yima to the balloon and we placed her in the basket
we tumbled in after her
you prebble were standine on the rim of the basket a knife in vour haud and the moment we were all aboard you slashed a rope in twain and the balloon sailed away into spacc
the churs flung a shower of spears afier us but they fell short
zylox was below and his face was the last one i saw that i can distinctly remember
ylma was with usthere can be no doubt on that score
she wanted to take a final look at the kingdom of nyl as ve swept over it and i remember steadying her as hc peered over the edge of the basket
pollbck had looked around in considerable astonishment
prebble and griffyn were exchanging puzzled looks face was first to clear
why said he with a laugh from the mompent griffyn and pollock went to your rescue captain your fancies have been playing weird pranks
it proves he added jubilantly my theory regarding the irresponsible of the mind north of the arctic circle is correct mean to say cried protestingly that i imagined all that about my escape with the princess exactly that said prebble
what really happened captain is this we were waiting for you at the balloon and we hardly thought it possible for you to get clear of your enemies
but you did manage to force a way through them by leaving the road and taking to the woods
ve saw you hard beset climbing the rocks with the princess in your arms griffyn and pollock sallied out to do what they could
just as they reached you a chur floored you with a blow
you fell and the princess dropped from your arms
griffyn and pollock could not bear away both you and the princess so they picked you up and carried you to the balloon
you were half dazed and wholly irrational
the princess was not here but you insisted on talking to her just as though she was here
you grew angry when we tried to explain and it was necessary for us to use force
while we were holding you down you seemed to recover your wits but the delusion regarding the princess had not been dispelled
i trust i have made that matter clear to you now however canot understand it i muttered
although i could not understand yet i was forced to accept explanation princess was not in the car
this one fact proved me in error would almost as readily think that our experiences in the land of nyll and among the churs were equally a product of my imagination said not at all spoke up griffyn for you have the testimony of the rest of us to adduce in prooi
that blow on the head dealt by the chur is what did the business for you salis have no recollection of it
your head is bandaged
that ought to be suflicient proof even though the hurt is causing you no discomfort
i was conscious then of a throbbing at the back of my head joke of it all is cackled the professor that the captain knocked coitat zylox off the oyd car with a love letter from the princess
that letter was impressed in a block of carnelian and weighed a pound
griffyn smiled and pollock laughed outright
i leaned back against the framework of the car and wondered if i had really recovered my senses
my romance with the princess had come to a most unsatisfactory conclusion
my heart was deeply involved and the disappointment was bitter
prebble seeing how hard i took the affair knelt down beside me
let me assure you captain said he that it is well the affair ended in this way
i shook my head
he went on with his reasons it is best that princess ylma should remain in her own land among her own people
best for her and best for the kingdom
the line of the boazars ends with ylma
had we borne the princess away the kingdom would indeed have had cause to consider us demons of destruction
you may find it hard to reconcile yourself to the fact now but in years to come you will be glad the matter turned out as it has
i kept my head howed in gloomy silence besides proceeded prebble we have left behind us a few good fricnds
if the princess remams to mtercede for them7for lord nvlis particularly we may console ourselves with a wellgrounded hope that they will not suffer for arding in our escape
then there is my word came in startled tones from griffyn
prebble scrambled to his feet and jomed griffyn who was looking excitedly over the rim of the basket
pollock also was containing himself only with great diffculty
glory cried the professor exultantly
look captain
see who are below
some of our eskimo guides as live and with them are several of the crew
rom the ship
here was something to take my mind off the amazing tangle in which it had become mvolved
scrambling erect leaned on the rim of the car and looked down were perhaps five hundred feet in the atr and only maintaining that height by the expenditure of vast quantities of ballast
below and a littie way to the south were dog sledges caped high with provisions
around the sledges were the eskimos and in front of the leading sledze stood the furclad men from the ship
i recognized lieutenant corson my second in command and bentnick our doctor
they are on the way to the ice cap said waving my hand to the startled men below
after the eskimos got back to the ship corson lost no time in starting out make a landing griffyvn you and pollock said i turned to prebble and gripped his hand
our dangers are nearly over with prebble said soon be aboard ship and under the flag
which puts us a long step toward home cried the professor delightedly wonder where our ship is pollock asked griffyn of his secretary
heaven knows
pollock answered
you are welcome to sail south with us griffyn and you pollock said we accept your offer salis returned griffrn heatily
you may need our testimony to substantiate your claims
we can help you there
he caught the valve cord
standing at the edge of the basket i watched while we settled slowly toward the gleaming plains of white
almost that princess ylma was beside me and almost i could hear her voice giving its final message it is quite true captain i am with you and shall always be with you
it was a message for me alone and treasured it as a promise
