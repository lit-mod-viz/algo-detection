munn -PRON- be no breach of confidence to inform the reader be a reformed burglar although the author of two book which achieve large sale and be most favorably receive by the way of crack safe and the manualmr 
munn develop small skill with the pen so that the breathless interest arouse by -PRON- revelation hang more upon the matter than the style 
the mercury article should do -PRON- mite toward prepare the reader for what be to come 
in the first place the story be what newspaper man call a scoop 
the article in the first edition run as follow a a what happen to professor quinn last night 
and what happen to the strange steel structure know locally among harlem resident as castle 
for quinn and -PRON- castle be snuff out like a candlegleam some time between the hour of eleven oclock and midnight 
patrolman casey who travel a beat in that part of harlem aver that -PRON- pass the castle at eleven oclock and that -PRON- be there -PRON- pass -PRON- site again at twelve and -PRON- be not there 
considerably exercise patrolman casey make search for the castle and although -PRON- beat up the country for a dozen block in all direction -PRON- fail to find -PRON- 
and what be more patrolman casey declare that -PRON- take the pledge when -PRON- go on the force and have be a total abstainer ever since 
corroboration of the officer report be not lack 
certain resident of the vicinity state that -PRON- see the professor weird dwell yesterday evening -PRON- window be aglow and -PRON- appear evident that the professor be entertaining friend 
the first gray dawn this morning show a bare lot with the steel house miss 
be -PRON- another case of palace dissolving into thin air at the presto of some wonder worker 
or be -PRON- a plain case of larceny undertake on a gigantic scale 
a golden opportunity offer -PRON- to a sleuth of the sherlock holme school and for such a person the mercury present the follow fact first the socalled castle be projectileshape of boilerplate construction and measure some twenty foot in diameter tapering to a point thirty foot above ground 
-PRON- be cover with a sort of paint that give -PRON- the appearance of frost silver 
second there be much low shrubbery surround the site of the castle and if the castle have be blow down and roll from the ridge -PRON- stand on into the river there would have be leave evidence in plenty of such disaster 
note the castle certainly weigh five ton possibly five time that 
nothing short of a cyclone could have budge -PRON- and there be hardly a breath of air stir the whole night long 
third professor quinn ever since -PRON- erect -PRON- steel house and move into -PRON- have be regard as mildly insane 
like -PRON- desire to be enter on the angelic scroll as one who love -PRON- fellowman 
last summer -PRON- read before the astronomical society a paper entitle the mutability of newtonian law and be laugh out of that honorable body for -PRON- inconsistency 
although advert to as the harlem sage professor quinn be no merlin nor do -PRON- possess the ring of gyge that render -PRON- wearer invisible 
yet where be -PRON- 
and where be -PRON- castle 
until some vidocq appear and solve the mystery echo can only answer where 
so much for the article in the first printing of the paper 
the bright young man who stand sponsor for the scoop have meanwhile be very busy with fresh detail and the second edition contain the follow addenda -PRON- have just be learn that mr emmet gilhooly the multimillionaire and president of the railroad combine be a guest of professor quinn last night and must have be in the castle at the very moment -PRON- fade into oblivion 
mr gilhooly do not return to -PRON- home and have not since be hear from 
-PRON- relative be distracted and lead railroad man of the country be in a panic 
-PRON- absence from affair at the present moment jeopardize the traction interest of the entire country and may prove a deathblow to the success of the gigantic pool -PRON- be form 
this be startling news indeed and speed hither and yon throughout the city the country and the civilized world 
appal as the information be nevertheless -PRON- prove merely a fractional part of the truth 
the bright reporter on the mercury make further discovery which be print in the third edition rush from the press of -PRON- paper 
not only be mr emmet gilhooly a guest of professor quinn in the steel castle last night but so also be hon 
augustus popham the coal baron archibald meig of wall street late manipulator of the corner in wheat and now engineer a corner in cotton and hannibal markham well know as the instigator of a plot to control the food supply of the united state 
what have become of these four millionaire and napoleon of finance 
-PRON- have go with quinn and -PRON- castle disappearing as utterly as though the earth have open and swallow -PRON- 
fabulous reward be offer by the relative of the miss millionaire for any information relative to the fate that have overtake -PRON- 
foul play be suspect and the financial world stand aghast and dumbly wonder what be to happen to the business of the country if -PRON- really develop beyond all peradventure that gilhooly popham meig and markham have be eliminate from commercial affair 
the influence of these four be vast and farreaching and -PRON- be scheme to make -PRON- grip on the republic resource even more secure and relentless 
if -PRON- plan carry no man could eat or clothe -PRON- or warm -PRON- body and drive -PRON- manufacturing engine or travel from place to place and ship the product of -PRON- mill without pay tribute to gilhooly popham meig and markham 
should those scheme titanic in conception be work out to -PRON- manifest conclusion four man would hold the destiny of industrial america in the hollow of -PRON- hand 
prosperity would wait upon -PRON- pleasure or at a mere nod would be paralyze and leave the country strand on the reef of disaster 
-PRON- seem an odd fatality that at the very time these of industry be plot to make -PRON- power complete -PRON- should have vanish as utterly as though -PRON- have be engulf by a tidal wave and sweep into the broad region of the atlantic 
a few fact be bring to light through the probing of skilled detective mind but these fact be in nowise clue to the fate that have overtake the millionaire confidential aide reluctantly admit that -PRON- chief have accept an invitation from quinn and have go to -PRON- castle for an interview 
quinn profess to have make some discovery or other which -PRON- declare would make coal a useless commodity so far as human need be concern 
popham while laugh at pretension be nevertheless secretly worried 
anything that threaten the success of the coup which be be engineer by -PRON- and -PRON- three confrere be to be deal with decisively and without loss of time 
in the case of meigs markham and gilhooly there be no confidential aide to offer testimony for these bright particular star of high finance have place a limit on the confidence repose in -PRON- secretary 
nevertheless the probe mind at work on the case develop the extraordinary fact that these man no less than popham have visit quinn at the latter request 
a spirit of scoff investigation animate -PRON- but -PRON- be prepared to see with -PRON- own eye and hear with -PRON- own ear whatever quinn have to show and to say 
if anything that militate against -PRON- project coup be bring before -PRON- -PRON- would proceed to lay the spectre forthwith 
strangely enough the shrewd of the detective fail to connect the disappearance of the millionaire with the comprehensive plan -PRON- be form and which could not be carry out except by the plotter in person 
other rich man of the country who be will not to trim -PRON- sail in accordance with whatever wind blow from the office of the four in wall street be already shift affair to lay a course that would give -PRON- the good headway against the project new order 
this sudden disappearance of the power to which the less rich look for guidance leave -PRON- becalm in an uncharted sea 
the middle class long accustom to be mulct right and leave accept the astonishing situation with equanimity 
so far as -PRON- be concern gilhooly popham meig and markham be abstract generalitiesmerely name to conjure with 
for year the middle class have pay for the conjuring and have be teach to look calmly into the eye of what -PRON- have come to believe be the inevitable 
if -PRON- annual outing to the seashore or the mountain cost too much -PRON- could stay at home if the butcher the baker and the grocer run price too high some of the luxury could be cut out if anthracite go to a ton -PRON- would heat few room and if clothing become too expensive there would be few suit and gown to wear 
by a little selfdenial the middle class also could trim -PRON- sail to any gale that blow 
-PRON- be use to -PRON- 
with the poor -PRON- be different 
-PRON- be already down to bedrock in the way of selfdenial 
no sooner have -PRON- drift through -PRON- brain that the influence of gilhooly popham meig and markham have be blot out than -PRON- lift -PRON- voice in praise of the blessed event 
-PRON- situation have be bad enough and any change among the vaguely understand cause preside over -PRON- affair could hardly be for the bad 
the detective feel that -PRON- be at work on a particularly complex case hamper -PRON- by look for complex cause 
at first -PRON- believe -PRON- be a matter of sequestration and that presently a ransom in seven or eight figure would be call for 
however a delving into past fail to reveal any lawless action that would point to a ransom in -PRON- present line of endeavor 
the detective grow more complex as the ambiguity close -PRON- in overlook entirely the simplicity of character 
anyhow one analytical mind would demand of another what have intention to do with the disappearance 
that be a positive reality 
and although -PRON- be surmise -PRON- be not definitely know that quinn -PRON- have have anything to do with -PRON- 
such be the situation confront the country and with which the police department of new york city be call upon to deal 
but the keen reason inductive or deductive be powerless to find even a clue 
the tremendous mystery may have remain a mystery until this day have -PRON- not be for the narrative of jame peter munn now for the first time give to the world 
i use to be one of those who claim that the world owe -PRON- a living and i go out with a drill and a jimmy to collect -PRON- 
where be the difference i argue between the man who crack -PRON- strong box and remove a few paltry bill or coin and the nabob who skulk behind a trust and take -PRON- tax on the necessity of life 
this be pure sophistry of course but i become wed to -PRON- in early life and that i escape a suit of stripe and measurement on the bertillon system be due entirely to -PRON- experience with professor quinn 
twa a blessed night that send -PRON- to -PRON- castle with the view of mulct -PRON- of treasure i feel to be there 
quinn be a queer one 
i do not mean to say that -PRON- be unhinge as some thought but -PRON- be queer in -PRON- outlook upon life and in resource which fall under the head of way and mean 
-PRON- castle claim -PRON- professional attention 
for why should a man build a big steel vault and live in -PRON- unless -PRON- have portable property worth a burglar while 
i reconnoiter the place for a week before i consider -PRON- possess of sufficient knowledge for -PRON- undertaking 
in view of what transpire at the time of -PRON- visit a brief description of the castle take from -PRON- memorandum book will prove of interest 
the structure be cigarshape twentynine foot from base to apex and twenty foot in diameter through -PRON- large part 
-PRON- be divide into two story by mean of a steel floor leave headroom of ten foot in the low story 
four window pierce the circular wall of the neth room and two give light to the room above these six opening be guard on the outer side with latticework of steel 
the door be an oblong piece of boiler platethe entire building be a shell compose of plate rivet togetherhinge heavily and provide with a strong lock 
as i have yet to find a lock which i could not pick if give time enough -PRON- design naturally centre about the door 
i have hit upon the somewhat early hour of ten in the evening for -PRON- call at the professor 
unless business keep -PRON- abroad i know that -PRON- be usually in bed long before that time 
if -PRON- chance to be out so much the well for the success of -PRON- foray 
after the patrolman have pass i creep through the bush and be soon busy with the lock on the steel door 
-PRON- yield with much less resistance than i have anticipate and i be quickly within flash -PRON- lantern about -PRON- 
a circular seat upholstered in leather run around the wall and a table bear an unlighted oil lamp stand in the centre of the floor 
i have barely complete a hasty survey when a crunch of footstep on the gravel walk without smote on -PRON- ear 
without loss of a moment i snap the lantern shut and dart up the iron stairway to the room above 
-PRON- be needless to say that i be very much put out because of the interruption 
i be a hard man in those day and such an occurrence be apt to anger -PRON- and make -PRON- say thing 
lie flat on the floor with -PRON- face to the stair opening i have a fairly good view of the circular chamber below 
the professor have be abroad and not in bed for -PRON- appear now usher in caller 
four gentleman all of distinguished mien and important bearing follow the owner of the castle and begin glance about with illconceale amusement 
gad but this be an odd place exclaim one 
this gentleman wear a frock coat and silk hat but what catch -PRON- eye be a fourcarat spark in -PRON- scarf a massive seal on -PRON- fob and a scintillating gem on the third finger of -PRON- left hand 
odd perhaps return the professor but most suitable to -PRON- purpose mr gilhooly as i hope to show -PRON- before many minute have pass 
be seat sir 
and the rest of -PRON- gentleman -PRON- will find the divan most comfortable 
gilhooly 
i go hot and cold at that name 
nearly everybody in new york be just then talk about the man who be scheme to make railroad travel too expensive for ordinary mortal 
-PRON- be a millionaire several time over and in the breast of -PRON- frock coat i know there must be a bulky wallet 
at once and while i watch and listen to those in the room below -PRON- mind busy -PRON- with detail of a more comprehensive operation than i have at first contemplate 
the professor four guest have seat -PRON- on the circular divan 
after -PRON- eye have finish with gilhooly -PRON- turn on the other three and -PRON- first impression be more than confirm 
each of the quartet be a croesus and dressed and strut the part 
fine bird indeed and i hug -PRON- to think how opportunity have come knock at -PRON- door in hand i could descend upon this covey compel a readjustment of value between -PRON- and -PRON- then back through the steel door lock -PRON- behind -PRON- and make off 
the professor intent on other thing no doubt have turn -PRON- key in the lock and have fail to discover that the bolt be already throw therefore -PRON- presence in the castle be entirely unsuspectedmanifestly an advantage 
-PRON- have ask -PRON- to come here professor quinn speak up one as the professor turn higher the wick of the lamp -PRON- have just light and here -PRON- be 
-PRON- say -PRON- have discover something whose value to science and the industrial world be beyond compute and that -PRON- wish to interest capital the speaker survey -PRON- three companion with a large be the capital shall come at -PRON- discovery in due course mr popham say the professor who be a wiry little man with a bald head and beadlike black eye thank -PRON- for come here 
emmet gilhooly augustus popham archibald meig and hannibal markham be star of the first magnitude in the sky of speculation and i esteem -PRON- fortunate in arouse -PRON- interest 
a faintness seize -PRON- as these name each an open sesame to the world of finance fall glibly from the professor tongue 
i be all but cheek by jowl with representative of billion 
augustus popham turn -PRON- head to give emmet gilhooly a plebeian wink 
gilhooly smile behind -PRON- smooth white hand 
archibald meig lean over to whisper something to hannibal markham who be affix a pair of gold eyeglass to -PRON- roman nose whereupon both gentleman suppress a titter 
a doubt of the sincerity of all four break over -PRON- 
-PRON- be there to have sport with this bald little man with the beady eye and the bee in -PRON- bonnet 
i chuckle grimly as i think of how the table would presently be turn 
i do not know whether the professor be as keen as i to detect these evidence of insincerity 
if -PRON- be -PRON- give no sign be sixtyfive say -PRON- and -PRON- life work have be the discovery which i be about to bring to -PRON- august attention 
perhaps some of -PRON- gentleman have read -PRON- paper on the mutability of newtonian law 
the gentleman acknowledge that -PRON- have not 
professor quinn seem disappointed 
if -PRON- have read that -PRON- continue -PRON- would have prepare yourself for an understanding of -PRON- theory and the demonstration of -PRON- which i be about to give 
let -PRON- ask -PRON- this when an apple leave -PRON- parent branch why be -PRON- that -PRON- fall downward instead of upward 
the napoleon of finance stare at one another 
archibald meig go so far as to tap a suggestive finger against -PRON- forehead 
gravity say the professor 
-PRON- be that which draw every atom on the surface of the earth directly toward the earth centre -PRON- be that which chain -PRON- foot to this planet and keep -PRON- from fall through interstellar space -PRON- be even that which keep -PRON- little world from fly apart and dissipate -PRON- in dust throughout the great void 
-PRON- be a simple proposition simply state and i trust -PRON- follow -PRON- 
-PRON- do follow -PRON- and so signified 
in the paper i read before the astronomical society pursue the professor make bold to declare that -PRON- be possible to insulate a body against the force of gravitation 
in other word to make -PRON- so immune from newtonian law that -PRON- would spurn the earth and fall from -PRON- at a speed even great than the draw power of gravity 
can -PRON- not comprehend what this mean cry quinn waxing eloquent 
-PRON- mean a new force in the industrial worlda power that feed on nothing save a law that transcend that of gravitation 
in point of fact -PRON- fall little short of perpetual motion 
without the expenditure of even a pound of coal this new force can turn the wheel of every railroad train on the globe 
with -PRON- own inherent energy -PRON- can give life to the machinery of flour mill cotton mill iron foundry -PRON- can augustus popham get up hurriedly and put on -PRON- hat rattlebrained idea sir -PRON- exclaim have no mind to remain here and listen to such talk coal mine ravage the earth crust in a thousand and one place 
the idea that human industry could get along without -PRON- coal be too much for -PRON- 
before -PRON- could reach the door professor quinn be in front of -PRON- bar -PRON- way 
remember mr popham say the professor if i be to take away -PRON- mine i should yet give -PRON- something in -PRON- place worth incalculably more 
hear -PRON- out sir 
i beg of -PRON- 
theory be cheap thing mutter popham as -PRON- again seat -PRON- 
an ounce of proof be worth a pound of theory 
exactly cry quinn and the ounce of proof shall be forthcome 
with that -PRON- pull the table from the centre of the room reveal an iron chain some three foot in length attach at -PRON- low end to a staple in the floor by mean of a clevi and pin 
the chain be not lie loosely but be rigidly upright -PRON- upper end wind about a white blocka sixinch cube as i judge 
climb to the table top the professor step thence to the cube poise -PRON- for a moment on one foot 
then -PRON- spring to the floor again 
this cube -PRON- explain lay one hand on the block with an affectionate gesture be of steel and have be treat with -PRON- insulating compound 
to all appearance -PRON- be fall upward with a force sufficient to draw the chain rigidly to -PRON- full extent and to support -PRON- weight 
poppycock mutter the coal baron trick exclaim meig 
the other two remain silent 
-PRON- be bewilder perhaps impress 
let -PRON- see whether -PRON- be a trick or no go on quinn 
pray come forward gentleman and lay hold of the chain 
there be no danger in the little experiment with which i be go to amuse -PRON- and i think -PRON- will dispel -PRON- doubt 
the gentleman hesitate but finally come forward get down with some difficulty and grasp the chain as direct 
hold tight exclaim the professor and draw the pin from the clevi 
thus release the cube rise to the ceiling lift the four gentleman with -PRON- 
-PRON- hang in midair until quinn draw the table under -PRON- and -PRON- drop to -PRON- top each in turn and so reach the floor 
bewilderment be write large in the face of the quartet -PRON- credulity struggle against the evidence of -PRON- sense 
-PRON- be a good magician sir aver popham brush the damp from -PRON- forehead with a handkerchief 
-PRON- could make -PRON- fortune as an entertainer declare gilhooly 
archibald meig chew briskly on an unlighted cigar while hannibal markham keep -PRON- eye on the cube and dangle chain like one fascinate 
-PRON- be the fate of a man who make startling discovery to be class among disciple in black art observe quinn calmly 
what be the hour mr gilhooly -PRON- ask 
the head of the railway pool consult -PRON- repeater -PRON- reply 
and high time i be go add popham 
just a few moment more say the professor 
turn to the wall behind -PRON- -PRON- catch a small lever and turn -PRON- over as far as -PRON- would go 
the castle vibrate slightly communicate a perceptible swaying motion to the pendent chain this cry markham jump up 
do not be alarm -PRON- friend cry quinn whirl around 
-PRON- face be pallid as death and -PRON- beady eye gleam like coal 
then wonder of wonder the white cube settle to the floor 
ha shouted popham 
-PRON- antigravity compound be not very long live -PRON- seem to -PRON- 
-PRON- will find differently to -PRON- cost return the professor through -PRON- tooth 
augustus popham kenward quinn arraign -PRON- and emmet gilhooly and archibald meig and hannibal markham as foe of the human race 
-PRON- be leech who would suck the lifeblood from the vein of the poor with steady forefinger quinn have transfix each of the plutocrat as -PRON- call -PRON- name 
markham be already on -PRON- foot and the other three be not slow in follow -PRON- this what s this gasp gilhooly 
an insult mutter popham 
the old addlepate be not accountable for what -PRON- say or do remark archibald meig 
-PRON- have best leave this steel trap of -PRON- while there be yet time counsel markham 
while there be yet time repeat quinn with a wild laugh pretty set of conspirator -PRON- be on -PRON- soul 
markham there would raise the price of food until the poor would go hungry -PRON- meig would so manipulate the cost of clothing that -PRON- would not have the wherewithal to cover -PRON- nakedness popham would make fuel a luxury of the rich and gilhooly would so boost passenger and freight rate as to quadruple to the consumer the tremendous cost of the necessity of life 
deny -PRON- if -PRON- can if -PRON- dare 
quinn look like a nemesis as -PRON- confront the four man and lash -PRON- with -PRON- scorpion whip of word 
fiddlededee exclaimed popham 
-PRON- deserve -PRON- say meig for -PRON- be the height of folly for -PRON- to come here in the first place 
be this why -PRON- bring -PRON- here ask markham to air -PRON- own particular idea on sociology and to make -PRON- the victim of -PRON- abuse 
the professor throw back -PRON- head and straighten -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- be the real thing in dignity that -PRON- show those plutocrat and -PRON- nerve tingle with admiration 
i be sorry i have come to the castle with design oh portable property and doubly glad that i could force tribute from these four who be badger -PRON- be not unjust aver the professor and such a thing as abuse be farth from -PRON- mind but i love the plain people the bone and sinew of this glorious republic and -PRON- arouse -PRON- indignation when the right to live and let live be trample upon by any one man or set of man 
platitude sneer popham 
to call a truth a platitude be witless argument answer quinn serenely 
be that as -PRON- may say meig -PRON- be not invite here for a debate but to witness a demonstration of what -PRON- be pleased to term a revolutionize discovery 
-PRON- have see -PRON- overcome the force of gravity go on the professor and to astute mind like yours further explanation seem uncalled for 
in destroy gravity i produce a power equal by no other force in the world 
the pull of an insulate block the size of that here -PRON- wave -PRON- hand toward the equal to the strength of a hundred horse 
develop that pull horizontally instead of vertically and -PRON- have a locomotive that run continuously without the consumption of a pound of coal 
that cry the professor -PRON- voice ring with triumph be the apotheosis of power 
gilhooly judge from -PRON- manner be the victim of uncomfortable thought meig wear a startled look and markham seem half convinced 
popham alone be brusque and uncompromising think -PRON- have well get out of here again suggest markham 
-PRON- half conviction appear to arouse some small amount of apprehension of the same opinion speak up meigs 
wait a little suggested popham and i see a gleam in -PRON- eye that mean a stroke of some kind 
once more -PRON- face quinn have no patience with -PRON- harebrained theory -PRON- go on and i have see charlatan work great wonder than what -PRON- be pleased to call -PRON- demonstration 
but -PRON- be a business principle of -PRON- to buy up these promising theory if -PRON- happen to run counter to any pet scheme i be try to put through 
sir rather than be annoy further with this chimerical idea of your i will pay five thousand dollar spot cash just to have -PRON- give over -PRON- notion and quit experiment 
professor quinn laugh 
five thousand dollar -PRON- exclaim then add as though to -PRON- -PRON- would have -PRON- sell the welfare and happiness of the people for five thousand dollar will add another five thousand to offer put in gilhooly not because i be afraid -PRON- discovery will upset the transportation interest of the country but simply to clear the commercial atmosphere and keep -PRON- visionary idea from affect the price of stock 
let -PRON- add another five thousand say meigs donot see how -PRON- invention even if -PRON- be all -PRON- claim for -PRON- could affect -PRON- or -PRON- interest one way or the other but i will add -PRON- contribution simply because popham have take the initiative 
count -PRON- in for the same amount supplement markham on the condition that professor quinn sign over to the four of -PRON- all -PRON- right title and interest in -PRON- nongravity invention and covenant to leave that field entirely alone in future 
quinn seem to enjoy these proposition and -PRON- be apparent at a glance that -PRON- have no intention of accept twenty thousand dollar and renounce -PRON- discovery 
gentleman say -PRON- -PRON- be already half convinced that i be no dreamer for -PRON- be financier and while twenty thousand dollar be no more to -PRON- than twenty cent be to -PRON- -PRON- be not -PRON- habit to give -PRON- money away 
i repeat that -PRON- be inclined to have faith in -PRON- and before many minute i shall have make -PRON- belief in -PRON- ability complete 
be i to understand that -PRON- decline -PRON- offer demand popham 
most decidedly 
then there be nothing more to be say 
come on gentleman and popham start toward the door moment more if -PRON- please request the professor 
not another second cried popham 
-PRON- offer be withdraw and if -PRON- socalled discovery amount to anything -PRON- shall find other mean for make -PRON- ineffective 
i have be interested in proceeding to an extent that have all but cause -PRON- to forget -PRON- purpose 
the plutocrat be about to leave the castle in a temper and if i wrest tribute from -PRON- -PRON- must be now or never 
start up i draw -PRON- revolver and run hastily down the iron stair 
-PRON- unexpected advent upon the scene prove as startling as i have anticipate 
even the professor be dash 
step in front of the steel door i toy menacingly with the revolver and survey the plutocrat with a grim humor i make no attempt to conceal 
at that period of -PRON- life inspire by the sophistry to which i have already advert i be a cool and dangerous man 
pardon -PRON- for enter unannounce say i blindly 
-PRON- have listen to professor theory and witness -PRON- demonstration 
i be but an humble philosopher yet i have a theory of -PRON- own which i should also like to expound and to demonstrate 
who be -PRON- sir demand quinn be a bird of like feather with these -PRON- guest say i facetiously albeit -PRON- method be more direct if less extensive 
-PRON- name be jam peter munn -PRON- specialty be robbery of the variety for i have the courage of -PRON- conviction and do not hide behind a technicality do not wish to intrude -PRON- presence here longer than necessary to accomplish -PRON- design and if these amiable gentleman will aid indicate the amiable gentleman with -PRON- revolver will take -PRON- departure quietly from the castle here i scowl trust or other will be minus -PRON- guide power in case any resistance be attempt 
the threat be sufficient and the usual sunny smile return to -PRON- face as i add mr gilhooly will advance to the table spread -PRON- handkerchief upon -PRON- and lie thereon -PRON- watch and fob the ring on -PRON- finger the kohinoor in -PRON- tie and the wallet in the breast of -PRON- coat 
-PRON- be -PRON- theory that one thief have the right to take from another property that do not belong to either of -PRON- 
-PRON- be mr privilege to give the first demonstration 
fidelity to truth force -PRON- to chronicle the above speech 
the clat with which i make -PRON- be far from -PRON- now as i pen -PRON- verbatim 
there be speech in life which -PRON- could wish unsaid and this one of mine i would give much to consign to the limbo of thing unspoken 
reformation have work wonder in -PRON- since that evil time 
i will say for mr gilhooly that -PRON- be alacrity -PRON- in carry out -PRON- command 
-PRON- hand tremble a little as -PRON- place -PRON- belonging on the handkerchief and knot the four corner over the plunder as i request 
the professor smile strangely sink down on the divan and watch proceeding with twinkling eye 
-PRON- manner fill -PRON- with a foreboding i try not to manifest 
evidently this amuse -PRON- cry gilhooly in anger -PRON- snap eye on the professor 
-PRON- inference be correct mr gilhooly answer quinn be profoundly amused 
-PRON- be all so unexpected so dramatic and souseless 
by gad sir cry popham see more in this than a desire on -PRON- part to interest capital in a fake discovery 
there be a plot here gentleman and -PRON- turn to the other three 
-PRON- folly in allow -PRON- to be lure to this place be stupendous 
i make no doubt but that there be a plot here between this man quinn and this thief 
quinn get -PRON- in the thiefs power and the thief do the rest pretty scheme snap meigs 
clever very clever put in markham 
and successful too growled gilhooly with a regretful look at the plunder on the table 
but there will be a reckon 
when -PRON- be once clear of this place -PRON- can set the police at work 
i be surprised at the way quinn take this talk 
-PRON- continue to smile and be in no way ruffle wrong there cry hot and indignant 
professor quinn have nothing to do with -PRON- being here have -PRON- eye on this castle for a long while and i let -PRON- in just before -PRON- come hope to make a haul and get clear 
-PRON- interrupt -PRON- and i stow -PRON- away upstairs 
from what i see and hear i must say that -PRON- be a pleasure for -PRON- to turn -PRON- back on professor property and to give -PRON- entire attention to -PRON- four 
mr munn say quinn how long have -PRON- be engage in this business 
for some year now sir i answer 
-PRON- be honestonce 
every man be bear honest if -PRON- come to that 
i use to work in an iron foundry but the work be take over by a combination and a lot of -PRON- be throw out of employment 
there be nothing for -PRON- to do but begand above that 
this come handiest and i go into -PRON- 
i like the business 
match one wit against the law keep one constantly in the midst of alarm so to speak and i like excitement 
and i have ability for never yet have i wear the stripe or learn the lockstep 
i have write some on the subject of -PRON- vocation in the hope of beguile other into the work dangerous man mutter gilhooly 
what be -PRON- come to clamored popham 
here be a thief who be actually proud of -PRON- profession and who actually write book about -PRON- 
merciful heaven gasp meig in horror feel sorry for -PRON- country when -PRON- produce such man be totter on the verge of chaos add markham in a stage whisper 
i laugh at all this for i enjoy -PRON- hugely 
spare yourself any needless worry about -PRON- gentleman say look to home and -PRON- will probably find enough there to fret -PRON- conscience 
professor quinn continue to take pleasure out of the queer situation can honor a man like munn say -PRON- where i be tempt to despise man like -PRON- gilhooly meig markham and popham 
as munn say -PRON- have the courage of -PRON- conviction 
-PRON- do not take from the poor for in the very nature of thing -PRON- can not 
-PRON- loot come from those who be able to lose -PRON- while -PRON- be vampire and sap the very lifeblood of the nation 
-PRON- be all criminally delude although perhaps do what -PRON- conscientiously believe to be exactly right 
would to heaven and here the professor grow suddenly sincere and intensely earnest that something would conspire to open -PRON- eye to the exact truth 
but i have despair of that and i be try in -PRON- own feeble way to meet the present emergency 
-PRON- be either a fool or a madman cry popham rattlebraine zealot chime in meigs 
-PRON- be the one who should see thing differently say markham 
-PRON- preach a doctrine which -PRON- fail to apply personally 
enough of this talk gentleman i interpose 
-PRON- situation be precarious and i must ask -PRON- to hurry a little 
sir shout popham level a forefinger at -PRON- shall see -PRON- properly jail for this 
why -PRON- miserable footpad i can save -PRON- breath i interrupt tartly meet -PRON- forefinger with the muzzle of the pepper box 
lead be no respecter of person 
one of -PRON- have call -PRON- a dangerous man 
i be all of that and desperate 
mr popham -PRON- see how mr gilhooly carry out -PRON- order 
-PRON- will proceed in the same manner and without further loss of time 
in five minute i must be out of here 
-PRON- start to argue the point with -PRON- and i allow -PRON- forefinger to flex ever so slightly upon the trigger 
that be enough 
a man value -PRON- life in a direct ratio with what -PRON- consider -PRON- importance therefore the esteem in which these four millionaire hold -PRON- must have be overwhelm 
the honorable augustus popham finally yield up -PRON- personal property with the same readiness that have characterize -PRON- friend 
hannibal markham follow -PRON- and after markham come archibald meig 
i have a pleasant word for each as i marshal the four bundle string -PRON- on the finger of -PRON- left hand and back toward the door which be a few pace behind -PRON- 
when a good general beat a retreat say prepare to pull open the door and let -PRON- out -PRON- place as many obstacle in the path of the pursue force as possible 
when i leave therefore i shall lock this door on the outside 
i be watch by the plutocrat in philosophical silence by the professor with a geniality that nothing seem able to shake 
i have spare quinn because -PRON- be a friend of the poor as i have discover 
and i have be poor -PRON- some fifteen minute back say i airily 
au revoir answer the professor 
look well where -PRON- step 
i throw open the door with a laugh 
the laugh fade into a shout of terror 
i throw out -PRON- hand revolver and packet of loot fall through the door and i only barely save -PRON- with one foot over the threshold 
the horror that grip -PRON- then be such a horror as come to a man but once in a lifetime 
-PRON- brain sicken and chill -PRON- heart all but stop -PRON- beating and -PRON- limb grow rigid 
in the black of the fearsome nightnot the atmospheric blueblack i have be accustom to but the ebony dark of erebusi see a wild greenish star below a huge disk whose gleam nimbus dance on -PRON- sight in quiver line 
half craze i fling back into the room and fall grovel to the floor -PRON- ear echo with the professor merriment and the startled exclamation of the four man i have robbedall to no purpose 
presently i sit up rub forehead and eye 
the professor stand in the open door gloat over the vista below 
come -PRON- call beckon to the huddled quartet at the other side of the room 
come gilhooly meigs popham and look down upon the scene of -PRON- feverish activity 
-PRON- be plutocrat there more powerful than king 
here -PRON- be no more than shoulder high with -PRON- and yon muddle thief on the floor 
-PRON- have be snatch from the scene of -PRON- pernicious laborsexile into planetary space where -PRON- will be powerless to work further evil 
i have not live in vain for this this be the triumph of -PRON- career 
slowly meig disentangle -PRON- from the mute group by the opposite wall and creep on all four to the threshold that overlook the void and the greenish star 
-PRON- recoil with a yell then madden by what -PRON- have see -PRON- leap erect and try to hurl -PRON- out into space 
fool cry the professor lay hold of -PRON- and struggle to keep -PRON- back 
would -PRON- become a satellite of this planet 
-PRON- be beyond the atmosphere of the earthlook 
see the four packet of loot and the thief revolver 
-PRON- point through the door and the bulge handkerchief and -PRON- sixshooter be abreast of -PRON- hang in space turn slowly weirdlya sight to upset the strong mind 
gilhooly jump forward give vent to a maniacal laugh then crumple down on the floor 
bid up for the -PRON- mumble bid to the limit 
i must have that will have -PRON- 
brace up meig say the professor sharply pull the key from the outer side of the lock slam the door fasten -PRON- and put the key in -PRON- pocket 
take care of gilhooly man 
-PRON- mind falter 
heaven be -PRON- all mad 
be -PRON- keen mind unshaken in the contemplation of vast deal for the enslavement of the poor so quick to break 
i have think well of -PRON- than this 
meig white as the spotless linen that cover -PRON- breast advance upon the professor 
-PRON- try to speak but without success 
at last with a supreme effort the word come madman what have -PRON- do 
that be better return the professor smile as -PRON- look at meig and note how markham and popham range -PRON- at -PRON- side much well 
-PRON- be engage in plot back there on the earth and the success of those plot would have prove a great calamity 
i have save the world from the calamity castle have rise from the earth ask meigs 
-PRON- have fall off the earth 
as -PRON- and i and the other happen to be inside -PRON- fall with -PRON- 
sudden rage convulse meig 
-PRON- crouch downward -PRON- eye ablaze and -PRON- finger work convulsively 
scoundrel -PRON- scream and launch -PRON- at the professor throat like a tiger 
look back now at that dreadful hour when the realization of -PRON- awful predicament burst upon -PRON- i wonder that i preserve -PRON- own equilibrium 
the first shock come near to throw -PRON- off -PRON- poise but after that i gain the whip hand of -PRON- wit by swift and sure degree 
i verily believe the professor would have be strangle by meig aid and abet by popham and markham have i not rush to -PRON- rescue 
i have muscle of iron and after i have catch meig by the nape of the neck and throw -PRON- backward i plant -PRON- between quinn and -PRON- foe 
leave the professor alone say -PRON- man show mighty poor judgment -PRON- strike -PRON- in try to lay violent hand on -PRON- 
-PRON- deserve death babble meig 
-PRON- have no business shoot -PRON- into space in this summary manner 
fear and anger have make meigs childish 
-PRON- measure -PRON- dilemma in term so common a smile come to -PRON- lip 
judgment poor judgment sniffed popham 
look at gilhooly and then talk about poor judgment if -PRON- can 
in truth the railway magnate present a sorry spectacle 
-PRON- clothing be in wild disorder -PRON- hair be rumple about -PRON- head and -PRON- be hop back and forth with two finger in the air 
-PRON- be under the impression that -PRON- be deal in railroad stock complete the huge transaction that have make -PRON- the talk of two continent 
this professor ought to be flay alive declare markham 
where be -PRON- go and when will -PRON- get there 
now say -PRON- be strike the keynote 
who know where -PRON- be go if the professor doesnot 
and who know when -PRON- shall arrive there if -PRON- be out of -PRON- power to tell 
-PRON- need the professor for if -PRON- be to be save -PRON- will be -PRON- knowledge that do -PRON- 
but what will -PRON- family think whimper meig 
and -PRON- business interest 
-PRON- throw up -PRON- hand and fall back in -PRON- seat with a groan 
then abruptly -PRON- straighten up again 
this be a dream 
by gad -PRON- must be 
the whole affair be too outrageously unreal for any sane man to believe 
gilhooly give a maudlin chuckle be dead sure get that last block of stock 
that road be the last span in -PRON- network of tie and rail 
ha 
now well see 
now meig shiver maundering strike sharply at -PRON- desire to coddle -PRON- with a myth awful to have gilhooly like that speak up augustus popham 
if -PRON- have not be throw out of balance -PRON- wide knowledge of matter relate to transportation may have prove of inestimable service to -PRON- now 
professor quinn laugh 
-PRON- be an eerie laugh and -PRON- shake -PRON- to hear -PRON- 
oh -PRON- cry markham reproachfully whirl on quinn 
after cause this disaster and overthrow as brilliant a mind as there ever be in wall street -PRON- have the heart to indulge in levity 
look here how far be -PRON- from the earth at the present moment 
that be a difficult matter to estimate even approximately answer quinn calmly 
ordinarily gravity exert a force that can be measure definitely on the earth surface 
a body fall freely from rest acquire a velocity which be equal to the product of thirtytwo and onefifth foot and the number of second during which the motion have last 
what be the time now 
three gentleman reach for -PRON- watch fail to find -PRON- and turn hard look on -PRON- 
i appreciate -PRON- dilemma and draw from -PRON- vest an openface timepiece that be personal property and honestly come by 
-PRON- be twelvefifteen say quinn take a pencil and notebook from -PRON- pocket and do some figuring 
-PRON- may be a little more than two mile from -PRON- native planet say -PRON- but only two mile cry the three exile in chorus 
-PRON- can take -PRON- back sir say popham who have be pace the floor nervously 
shut off the power of this infernal machine and let -PRON- drop back to where -PRON- belong 
two mile be no great matter 
-PRON- castle be a slow freight compare with some of express train can not take -PRON- back sir return the professor and i would not if i could 
-PRON- do not hear -PRON- out 
the law of velocity recite for -PRON- benefit a moment ago do not measure the speed of this car 
no murmured markham 
decidedly not 
the earth sweep along in -PRON- orbit at the rate of eighteen mile to the second while some aerolite and meteoroid attain a speed of twenty and thirty mile to the second 
in build this car i equip -PRON- with an antigravity block gear up to fifty mile to the second 
the lever on the here quinn turn and point to throw so as to give -PRON- the maximum 
in other word say popham feebly -PRON- be sail skyward at a rate ofof three thousand mile perper minute 
presumably 
as -PRON- leave -PRON- city lot in new york at about elevenfifteen -PRON- follow that -PRON- have be one hour on the way 
and should be one hundred and eighty thousand mile from home falter meigs 
about that answer the professor calmly do not know just how much -PRON- progress be impede by the atmospheric envelope of the earth but i think -PRON- may call -PRON- distance from the mother orb some one hundred and eighty thousand mile in round number 
these startling figure come near to unsettle the three gentleman again 
in that flight through space -PRON- be confront immensity wellnigh beyond -PRON- puny comprehension 
and the professor be not yet do 
in the storeroom overhead -PRON- continue have a supply of cube and insulating compound which i can combine and give tremendous add velocity to the car be sure -PRON- be travel fast enough say meig lean back on the divan hopelessly deject 
if -PRON- be now ready to listen to reason proceed quinn will tell -PRON- how mr munn here save -PRON- life by rescue -PRON- from -PRON- mad attack 
-PRON- life forsooth exclaim markham bitterly 
of what value be life to -PRON- situate as -PRON- be 
that be one way to look at -PRON- of course rejoin quinn caustically 
but i do not exile -PRON- into planetary space for the purpose of wipe -PRON- out of existence 
-PRON- may as well have do so say popham severely 
that be what this harumscarum plot of yours amount to in the long run 
-PRON- may not care to learn how i be preserve -PRON- at the present moment continue quinn nor how i shall do so in the future yet i will tell -PRON- so that -PRON- may understand how much -PRON- owe to mr foresight and courage 
i be begin to entertain a high regard for quinn in spite of what -PRON- have do 
-PRON- may have be labor under terrible delusion but -PRON- resource certainly command respect 
to -PRON- forethought -PRON- continue be due the fact that -PRON- be breathe oxygen at this moment and have i not invent a liquid which fortifie animate or inanimate body against heat and cold -PRON- rush through the atmosphere of the earth would have incinerate this car and -PRON- contentsnay would have cause -PRON- to explode and settle back on -PRON- native planet in impalpable powder 
these be thing that none of -PRON- aside from the professor have so much as take thought of 
-PRON- respect for -PRON- be grow into something like awe and i fancy i detect trace of the same sentiment in the other three 
there be rove body in space quinn go on note with apparent satisfaction the interest -PRON- have arouse with which -PRON- may come into collision 
i have a good telescope at the observatory window upstairs and while i can not guide this car i can at least increase or slacken -PRON- speed so as to dodge any other derelict that may come into dangerous proximity with -PRON- -PRON- better be up there on the lookout query markham in some trepidation 
-PRON- be manifest an interest in -PRON- personal safety that please the professor 
there be not much danger at present return quinn 
when -PRON- have plunge farther into the interstellar void -PRON- will be well to stand watch and watch about at the telescope 
will -PRON- not be possible to land on some other planet mar for instance query popham with sudden hope should prefer mar add meig reflect the hope show in -PRON- friend face 
-PRON- have be signal from mar and perhaps -PRON- can find out what -PRON- want over there 
quinn shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- be in the hand of fate gentleman say -PRON- 
-PRON- may drop into some port but what that port will be be beyond -PRON- power even to surmise 
the moon isnot so far off suggest markham 
only two hundred and forty thousand mile say quinn 
-PRON- should be there in less than two hour from the time of start remark meig after a mental bout with the figure 
if i wish say quinn could increase -PRON- speed travel at the rate -PRON- be however something will have to be deduct for the resistance of the earth atmosphere 
if -PRON- drop on a planet -PRON- must be a planet with an atmosphere 
the moon have none and consequently be a dead world 
besides fate may not throw -PRON- into -PRON- vicinity or just a minute sir interpose markham for i be a man who like to understand thoroughly every situation with which -PRON- be call upon to deal 
-PRON- invite -PRON- to -PRON- castle not i be constrain to believe to have -PRON- victimize by munn here nor to have -PRON- invest in any of -PRON- discovery but to snatch -PRON- away from the scene of -PRON- labor 
be that correct professor quinn 
entirely so mr markham reply quinn 
evidently proceed markham -PRON- plot have cost -PRON- some time and labor 
-PRON- have first to find -PRON- gravityresisting compound the plot follow as a result of -PRON- discovery smile the professor do not first evolve the plot and then go search for mean to get -PRON- off the earth 
when i have make the discovery -PRON- remain for -PRON- to give -PRON- to the worldor to better the world by take -PRON- four gentleman away from -PRON- 
have i give the public the benefit -PRON- shrewd man of affair may have devise mean for set -PRON- aside or for control -PRON- 
not be a business man -PRON- i fear to take chance 
for that reason the present enterprise appeal to -PRON- 
-PRON- have plan so well in the small detail that i wonder -PRON- overlook the main point 
and that be what -PRON- be go to do with -PRON- now that -PRON- plan have succeed 
the professor toss -PRON- hand deprecatingly as though that be really the most insignificant part of -PRON- startling scheme 
-PRON- canot go bob around through interstellar space grumble popham donot relish the idea of be cribbed cabin and confine in a steel room indefinitely 
i should go mad from the very thought awful to contemplate say meig cast a melancholy glance through the iron latticework at one of the window 
the bag of loot be in that vicinity at the moment and -PRON- glance swerve reproachfully to -PRON- 
-PRON- shall make a landing i have no doubt say the professor soothingly somehow and somewhere 
by gad sir cry popham bring -PRON- fist emphatically down on the table donot like such a way of do thing 
whenever i set out to accomplish anything the goal be always clear in -PRON- mind yet here i be through no desire of -PRON- own afloat in the great void without a single aim or a remote prospect 
if -PRON- be go to land anywhereand -PRON- remain firm in -PRON- decision not to take -PRON- back to -PRON- native demand that -PRON- make landfall on some orb that be worth while 
very good popham approve meigs 
unless i be greatly mistaken that be the very idea markham have in mind when -PRON- begin question the professor 
eh markham 
-PRON- be reply markham full knowledge of where -PRON- be go be necessary to a thorough understanding of remarkable situation 
now there be world large than the one -PRON- have recently leave 
personally i be predispose in favor of a large planetone on which there be traction interest fuel supply and product of the soil similar to those -PRON- have be accustom to 
under the spell of word popham begin to glow and expand 
meig all attention press a little close 
the big the planet the big -PRON- field of operation cry popham the matter with jupiter 
or saturn echo meigs 
or neptune put in markham the matter with the whole solar system inquire quinn with gentle irony 
-PRON- turn to -PRON- 
observe mr munn how extravagant be the idea inspire by monopoly 
these gentleman be hardly start on -PRON- journey into space before -PRON- forget the business interest the friend and the environment -PRON- be leave behind and begin plan the commercial conquest of the star 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head forebodingly 
-PRON- regeneration -PRON- add to the millionaire call for a landing on some barren world some outcast of the solar system where -PRON- will have nothing to do but think over the evil of -PRON- past and learn something of the duty -PRON- owe -PRON- fellowmen 
popham markham and meig be visibly annoy by the professor remark 
withdraw as far as the limit of the steel structure would allow -PRON- put -PRON- head together and hold a brief but animate conversation in tone so low that the professor and i could not overhear 
think of that professor 
i mutter 
and yet there be people who find fault with a respectable burglar 
softly mr munn return quinn 
before -PRON- be do with this journey i be fain to believe that all of -PRON- will have a different outlook upon life and a high regard for -PRON- duty of citizenship 
just then popham turn from -PRON- friend and step toward the professor 
-PRON- manner be truculentprobably just such a manner as -PRON- be accustomed to use in face a board of obstinate director 
if -PRON- will not return -PRON- to -PRON- native planet professor quinn say -PRON- sharply then -PRON- shall stand upon -PRON- right 
-PRON- be unalterably oppose to land upon any orb whose diameter measure less than at that instant a most astounding thing happen 
the car duck sideways throw the whole structure out of plumb 
loose article begin to drop from shelf and other place and to slide across the floor to the low point 
by a quick movement i save the lamp and brace -PRON- in an upright position 
cry of terror go up from markham meig and popham 
gilhooly shout the professor 
-PRON- be answer by a wild yell from overhead in the storeroom cry quinn 
follow -PRON- with that lamp the professor rush for the stairway and i make after -PRON- with what speed i could 
there never live a man i suppose who do not at some time or other in -PRON- career submit -PRON- veracity to question 
a reformed burglar therefore although animate by the most disinterested motive can scarcely hope to escape the shaft of the incredulous 
although wellgrounde in the science of cracksmanship and with some store of legal learning as to alibis and so forth -PRON- mind be as empty of astronomical lore as a drained bottle 
the professor saying be jot down in a sort of commonplace book at a later day when leisure offer 
memory may have play -PRON- false in some few minor point but in all of major importance this narrative be to be take with the same sincerity in which -PRON- be write 
i ask no more of the reader than that and if -PRON- be not averse to stroll through unfrequented way touch elbow with a man who have a past -PRON- shall get along famously 
to return then to the steel car and the obliquity -PRON- suddenly present to the direction of -PRON- course 
startling disclosure have somewhat obscure gilhooly and -PRON- have vanish from the low room without be miss 
for a man of sixtyfive the professor be very agile and -PRON- take the winding iron stairway two step at a time 
i gain the storeroom close behind -PRON- and there -PRON- find gilhooly croon to -PRON- and work like mad 
-PRON- be not work in the dark but have possess -PRON- of -PRON- lantern which i have leave on descend from the loft some time before 
mount on a pile of pack case -PRON- be engage in paint a large steel cube take -PRON- pigment from an open cask with a whitewash brush 
-PRON- antigravity compound exclaim the professor in an irritated tone 
there be several block on the floor as -PRON- can see gilhooly begin paint that one and -PRON- rise as insulation proceed lodge to the left of the dome and tilt the car 
this be the shabby lot of coach i ever see in -PRON- life say gilhooly dab away with the brush wonot own a road with such rolling stock 
the three man downstair have follow quinn and -PRON- 
after some coax meig get gilhooly to descend from -PRON- perch and give up the whitewash brush 
thereupon the cube be pry over until -PRON- rest directly under another block in the point of the dome and the professor finish the insulation begin by the railway magnate 
gilhooly will have to be watch say quinn or -PRON- will play havoc with the material i have store up here 
-PRON- have waste at least a quart of that antigravity mixture and -PRON- be worth -PRON- weight in gold 
nay -PRON- be worth more than that for after this supply be exhaust there will be none to be have for love or money 
-PRON- rate of speed have be multiply by two and -PRON- be rush through space with frightful rapidity 
there be -PRON- the professor point to the instrument which stand beneath a window in the slope roof of the car 
suppose gilhooly have demolish that 
or what if -PRON- have wreck the oxygen vat or the antitemperature reservoir 
gentleman i shudder to think of what may have happen 
the professor sink down on a copper tank and brush -PRON- perspiring brow with a bandanna handkerchief 
i place the lamp on a box beside the lantern and recline on a bale of something or other that lie conveniently near 
meig and popham drop down on a packing case with gilhooly moor between -PRON- and markham take up -PRON- station on an overturn cask 
the loft of the car store as -PRON- be with odd and end of science together with a supply of provision make ready for -PRON- by the farsighted and wonderful man who be conduct this select party into the unknown be an object of deep solicitude and interest 
out of a desire to tag the various material understandingly i lift the lid of -PRON- curiosity and let out a few question 
if i mistake not say -PRON- mention this antitemperature material once before 
what be -PRON- professor liquid -PRON- answer amiably 
as a discovery -PRON- be outrank only by -PRON- antigravity compound 
an ounce of the fluid in a bath render the bather impervious to heat or cold keeping in the animal caloric and keep out all other extreme of temperature 
some of the mixture be incorporate into the paint with which this car be coat 
yonder be the water receptacle and the professor nod toward a large tank opposite -PRON- 
with economy the supply in that reservoir will last -PRON- several month 
the food i have provide be of the readyprepare kind mostly in tin with an alcohol lamp for the brewing of tea coffee and chocolate 
during this hegira into infinity i have omit nothing gentleman which will minister to -PRON- comfort 
-PRON- be a very able man professor acknowledge popham 
how long have -PRON- be plan this little excursion 
ever since i begin erect what the harlemite be pleased to call -PRON- castle smile quinn 
the plan be conceive at the time the success of the manipulation of -PRON- and -PRON- friend seem assured 
-PRON- be -PRON- purpose to foil the speculative gentleman i strike in and so come to the aid of a longsuffere public 
-PRON- hit off the matter finely mr munn reply the professor 
that be -PRON- purpose 
could not -PRON- antitemperature mixture have be donate to the poor with beneficial result 
-PRON- be altogether too expensive for general use 
i will not conceal from -PRON- gentleman the fact that -PRON- be fall sunward 
if -PRON- make landfall on a planet where the heat be several hundred degree beyond -PRON- earthly power of endurance the mixture in question will preserve -PRON- 
fall sunward exclaim markham 
-PRON- be hard upon midnight when -PRON- leave the earth 
if -PRON- schoolday learning be not at fault the sun at the hour of -PRON- departure be on the opposite side of -PRON- planet 
how then do -PRON- happen that -PRON- be fall toward the great luminary 
bravo cry the professor vastly pleased be glad to see mr markham that -PRON- intellect have not suffer a total eclipse by the demand of commercial supremacy 
night be the result of one of the hemisphere be turn from the sun and other thing be equal -PRON- should now be fall toward the outer limit of -PRON- solar system but if i may use the term the castle be not aim for a direct fall from the earth crust 
-PRON- drop at a very sharp angle and the influence of the sun have attract -PRON- still farther out of a straight course 
i trust -PRON- follow -PRON- 
the three millionaire understand the situation but judge from the expression of -PRON- face the knowledge bring keen disappointment 
there be only two planet between the earth and the sun observe markham mercury and venus if i remember rightly 
both insignificant grumbled popham 
venus be about the size of -PRON- own planet gentleman say the professor 
however -PRON- have long be suppose that there be another group of planet between mercury and the sun among -PRON- a little world call vulcan which that do not interest -PRON- cut in meigs 
sunward the planet be small but -PRON- get large as -PRON- go the other way 
larger expound the professor but less dense 
as i be about to tell -PRON- a moment ago pursued popham meig markham and i have decide that either saturn or mar would about fill the bill so far as -PRON- be concerned 
there be light on mar which as -PRON- figure -PRON- presuppose electricity and electricity mean civilization to a degree that afford -PRON- a promising prospect 
then again there be canal on mar and if canal certainly water transportation 
transportation problem of any sort will interest gilhooly indeed -PRON- be prone to think -PRON- would bring -PRON- back to -PRON- normal poise 
saturn on the other hand have ring and such a condition may afford opportunity to wideawake man such as be unknown anywhere else in the solar system 
take -PRON- either to mar or to saturn professor quinn as -PRON- may find -PRON- most convenient 
-PRON- demand -PRON- 
-PRON- be impossible to do anything of that kind mr popham return the professor decidedly 
the influence of the sun upon -PRON- course be too powerful 
be -PRON- to understand then cry markham that -PRON- be compel to put up with either mercury or venus 
even there gentleman -PRON- have no choice 
-PRON- be in the grip of circumstance and must perforce accept whatever fate throw -PRON- way 
possibly -PRON- shall become a satellite of the sun revolve around and around planet the small of any in the great system 
although i feel drowsy i arouse -PRON- with an effort and keep sharp eye on the professor face 
i do not think -PRON- be in earnest but merely talk to see what effect -PRON- remark would have on the three millionaire 
corner corner corner babble gilhooly make a corner corner everything 
markham drop -PRON- face in -PRON- hand meig bow -PRON- head and i see a shiver run through popham 
egad mutter popham this castle of yours quinn be little short of a steel tomb 
inasmuch as -PRON- be safely inter what s the use of living 
gilhooly be the only fortunate one among -PRON- for -PRON- reason be shatter and -PRON- can not realize what -PRON- be face 
-PRON- be talk less like a man now popham reprove quinn than like a drivel idiot 
while there s life there s hope 
how many brilliant mind have be overthrow as a result of -PRON- manipulation of stock in wall street 
how many bright future have be wreck by an adverse trend of the speculative market 
be those unfortunate any better off because thrust into madhouse and unable to realize the fate that have overtake -PRON- 
for shame sir 
-PRON- be perfectly sure be -PRON- professor i strike in attempt to give a more pleasant twist to the conversation that -PRON- shall come out all right in the end have -PRON- plan mr munn -PRON- answer not unkindly and the success or failure of -PRON- will depend largely upon the mental attitude of these gentleman 
this be too deep for -PRON- and i cast about for some equally important question which would bring a less indefinite response 
anyhow say -PRON- have plenty of food for a long journey 
-PRON- would be a fearful thing to have a famine soso many mile from a base of supply 
the food supply mr munn answer the professor be adequate 
there will be no famine 
and the water the oxygen the have look after everything necessary to -PRON- safety and comfort 
i have confidence in quinn 
-PRON- have show that -PRON- be an able man and that -PRON- promise be to be take at face value 
with a sigh of relief i settle back in tolerable comfort 
meig take the role of questioner out of -PRON- hand at this point and although i be eager to hear all that be say tired nature sweet restorer get the well of -PRON- curiosity and i fall asleep on the bale 
-PRON- be not -PRON- purpose to cumber this narrative with the small detail of -PRON- journey novel and thrill though some of -PRON- prove to be 
-PRON- be with -PRON- experience on the planet which finally claim -PRON- that this account have mostly to do so i shall glide over intermediate incident in a somewhat cursory manner 
-PRON- faculty key to an understanding of earthly condition only find -PRON- continually at bay and at nothing do -PRON- stand more aghast than at the lightninglike speed with which -PRON- shoot through space 
the energy develop by the two insulate cube give to -PRON- steel car the stupendous velocity of one hundred mile per second six thousand mile per minute three hundred and sixty thousand mile per hour 
human reason may well falter at the threshold of such immensity 
yet while i sleep peacefully on that bale in the storeroom these figure be verify by the professor and archibald meig who happen to be the only two who be wide awake 
-PRON- have be -PRON- lasting regret that -PRON- do not rouse -PRON- so that i may also have have a view of the noble spectacle for the first time unroll to earthly eye 
-PRON- pass the moon a dreary burnedout world and the professor be able to check off two hundred and forty thousand mile of -PRON- sunward plunge 
-PRON- have travel a little more than half an hour at -PRON- ultimate velocity take this into consideration and note the exact minute when -PRON- cross the centre of the satellite orbit the professor be able to do some figuring and so test -PRON- theory as to speed 
the car skim through ether less than five hundred mile above the lunar crust 
quinn be doubly pleased for -PRON- not only prove that -PRON- velocity be substantially as -PRON- have suppose but also discover that the moon attraction so powerful on the tide of -PRON- mother sphere could not swerve the car by a hair breadth from -PRON- direct course or overcome the influence of the sun 
meig tell -PRON- later that the marvelous beauty of the satellite gleam against the black void with ghostly radiance be probably worth the trip and -PRON- attendant inconvenience 
-PRON- and quinn have look -PRON- fill on the hemisphere which be never see from the earth 
after this the hour literally fly past the novelty of -PRON- journey preclude any such thing as monotony 
in fact -PRON- hardly allow -PRON- a sufficient amount of time for rest and refreshment 
a lookout be keep continually at the eyepiece of the telescope to signal the approach of any asteroid with which -PRON- may possibly come into collision 
only once do this danger threaten -PRON- and then as may be suppose -PRON- be the professor who prove -PRON- salvation 
the lever in the wall of the lower or living room of the car communicate with screen ingeniously arrange for shut off the power of the antigravity cube 
by lessen -PRON- speed the professor suffer the asteroid to cross -PRON- course -PRON- car duck through the luminous trail that sweep out behind -PRON- 
night reign around -PRON- constantly 
-PRON- car catch the ray of the sun -PRON- be true but the lack of an atmosphere cause the light to be throw back into space and lose 
the castle be nothing less than a small planet attend by five satellite which hold to -PRON- vicinity by the car attraction circle around -PRON- continually 
these satellite be the four knot handkerchief contain the tribute i have levy upon the plutocrat and also the revolver which have assist -PRON- in the work 
these object go through varied phase exactly as more pretentious satellite would have do 
-PRON- would be difficult to describe -PRON- feeling as i watch -PRON- from the car window 
i be prone to think at the present writing that this lose booty wax and wane under -PRON- eye plant in -PRON- nature those first seed of regret which finally grow into a reformation 
i recall a conversation that i have with markham while i sit with -PRON- eye at the low end of the telescope watch for stray asteroid 
the millionaire have give -PRON- to understand that i be not in -PRON- set circumstance over which -PRON- have no control have bring -PRON- together within the narrow confine of the car but no social barrier have be level 
occasionally the novelty of -PRON- situation and the consequent excitement would cause one or other of the wealthy gentleman to forget the gulf that yawn between -PRON- 
this attitude of the magnate afford -PRON- a good deal of innocent enjoyment 
-PRON- have leave social prestige no less than -PRON- bank account behind -PRON- and what little collateral -PRON- have have upon -PRON- person be now satellite about the car 
the line -PRON- draw between -PRON- and -PRON- in -PRON- thoughtful moment be a distinction without much of a difference 
markham i remember be munch a sandwich contrive out of two cracker and a slice of tin beef 
do -PRON- never reflect mr munn say -PRON- upon the evil of -PRON- past 
when a man write book which be mainly draw from -PRON- own experience mr markham say -PRON- have to go into -PRON- past pretty exhaustively 
ah yes i be forget about the book 
be -PRON- not horrified with the result of -PRON- retrospection 
horrified 
well yes here and there 
i lose a big haul once through the breaking of a jimmy and i be horrified to think how any dealer in burglar kit could have foist such an unreliable instrument upon a wellmeane cracksman 
markham stare at -PRON- dazedly have set down the experience in chapter one of forty way for crack safe i proceed and one of the first of -PRON- ten rule for success in any safecracking job be this be sure that -PRON- kit be reliable and without flaw 
mr munn mr munn whisper markham hoarsely 
think of the people from whom -PRON- have take property dishonestly never think of -PRON- but to wish that i have be able to relieve -PRON- of more 
this be awful mutter markham 
-PRON- really exult over what -PRON- have do 
-PRON- would have start down the iron stair have i not restrain -PRON- with a word 
let -PRON- ask -PRON- something mr markham say last fall bread go to ten cent a loaf because the wheat market be corneredand a man by the name of markham do the cornering 
the people who have to put up that extra five cent miss -PRON- more than do those from whom i take five hundred dollar 
markham cough 
any asteroid in sight -PRON- inquire absently wonder if -PRON- ever do any reflect 
i ask tartly 
what do -PRON- think of quinn and markham look away as i take -PRON- eye from the telescope and give -PRON- an expressive wink donot think i continue that -PRON- ever write a book call forty way to starve the poor 
-PRON- have material enough for a pretty effective volume on the subject but -PRON- havenot -PRON- nerve 
no -PRON- return slowly havenot -PRON- nerve 
-PRON- require unalloyed impudence and a mind incapable of clear thinking to liken the result of high finance with those of -PRON- own petty and highly criminal proceeding 
-PRON- be too bright a man mr munn to allow -PRON- to be lead afield by sophistry of that kind 
mr markham mr markham 
i breathe in horrified protest 
-PRON- have bolster up -PRON- nefarious business with false ideal -PRON- go on and -PRON- be unregenerate and lose 
this be awful 
i murmur 
when -PRON- get to where -PRON- be go pursue markham either fail to note -PRON- sarcasm or else hope to ride -PRON- down trust -PRON- will hold -PRON- criminal instinct in check 
if there be any people there donot give -PRON- any false ideal or implant the notion that -PRON- standard belong to the rest of -PRON- would not so belittle -PRON- ideal i return bluntly 
sir -PRON- cry sharply be i to understand that -PRON- set -PRON- up as be any well than mr popham mr gilhooly mr meig or -PRON- 
what -PRON- understand doesnot concern -PRON- in the least i answer airily 
what -PRON- donot understand -PRON- strike -PRON- be the matter that ought to claim -PRON- attention 
confound -PRON- sir 
-PRON- overwhelming ignorance be equal only by -PRON- colossal egotism 
i be sorry that i allow -PRON- to be beguile into any talk with -PRON- 
-PRON- regret be mutual say for -PRON- conversation be demoralize 
-PRON- be a past master in successful trickerytrickery of the sort that ought to be stamp out 
if the law be as quick to deal with -PRON- as with -PRON- hold fume markham plunging for the stair have hear enough 
i have say that i be a hard man in those time 
i could call a spade a spade with never a thought that -PRON- angle of vision be distort 
i have regret express -PRON- view in this frank fashion to markham yet i believe that there be injustice in -PRON- remark no less than in mine 
be the only person in the car who possess a watch the professor appoint -PRON- official timekeeper 
-PRON- be -PRON- duty to bulletin the hour with -PRON- equivalent in day such as -PRON- be accustom to upon a blackboard in the low room i have also to enter this information upon a book which the professor call the logbook 
every ten hour -PRON- have a class in astronomy with the professor as instructor and with every man save gilhooly and the lookout as student 
the railway magnate aberration continue all -PRON- could do be to watch -PRON- solicitously and prevent -PRON- from do any injury to -PRON- or to -PRON- paraphernalia 
the class learn that the near planet with an atmosphere and supposedly habitable be venus which at inferior conjunction be distant some twentyfive million mile from terra as quinn call -PRON- own planet 
count out the delay at start and in maneuvre to escape the asteroid -PRON- instructor assert that -PRON- should reach venus in something like seventyfive hour 
markham meig and popham on consult the bulletin board and find that seventy hour have pass begin to brush -PRON- clothe and tidy -PRON- against the hour of landing 
but -PRON- be destine to disappointment 
unable to locate venus at the point where -PRON- have hope to find -PRON- the professor decide that -PRON- be near superior conjunction and be somewhere on the other side of the sun 
meig make a deplorable display of temper 
quinn be a mighty poor astronomer -PRON- say sneeringly if -PRON- could find -PRON- so far wide of the mark on such a simple matter 
meig further addedwith a good deal of childishness as i thoughtthat the role of a derelict be distasteful to -PRON- a derelict -PRON- argue be nothing more than a tramp and -PRON- object to be a tramp even a celestial tramp 
i be out of patience with the man 
admiration for the professor have take fast hold of -PRON- and i would not have -PRON- sneer at or malign 
a war of hot word be on between -PRON- and the wall street broker when quinn interfere 
true say -PRON- -PRON- have miss venus by a few million of mile but -PRON- be aim directly at the orbit of another world and i can so manipulate the lever as to wait for -PRON- if necessary and drop upon -PRON- surface when -PRON- overtake -PRON- 
what world be that say popham prick tip -PRON- ear 
mercury answer the professor 
-PRON- be the small orb in -PRON- solar system and measure some three thousand mile in diameter think venus be rather contract for man with such large scheme as -PRON- remark meig shake -PRON- head but this other planet seem to be small still wonder if -PRON- have coal mine there murmur popham meditatively 
and if -PRON- grow wheat and cotton add meig 
if mercury be inhabit speak up markham eagerly food will certainly be as necessary there as on the earth 
i donot know gentleman but -PRON- strike -PRON- -PRON- may fall into bad place 
poor gilhooly sigh meigs 
what a pity -PRON- will be if the mercurial prove to have traction interest 
how long before -PRON- shall reach this planet -PRON- speak of professor inquire popham 
well answer quinn thoughtfully mercury be rather slow 
-PRON- travel along -PRON- orbit at the rate of thirty mile per second while -PRON- be move at one hundred mile 
at a rough estimate i should say -PRON- can effect a juncture with the planet in ten hour although an extra hour may be require for maneuvre to secure a landing 
the ten hour that follow be hour of great anxiety and feverish labor 
believe that -PRON- nerve be the steady the professor place -PRON- at the telescope to act as pilot while -PRON- serve as engineer and manipulate the lever 
the responsibility of -PRON- position so work upon -PRON- that i have no time for the glory of the planet -PRON- be endeavor to intercept 
through the telescope i see huge mountain and broad plain but -PRON- be blur over with a reddish light and the less detail of topography be lose 
when five hour be go the professor leave the lever and come upstairs to have a look through the telescope for -PRON- 
-PRON- have do very well indeed mr munn -PRON- be pleased to say but i think that i have well take this post from now on while -PRON- go below and station -PRON- at the switch board 
the slight mismanagement when the critical moment arrive may hurl -PRON- against mercury with a force that would result in annihilation 
the lever turn in a half circle as -PRON- may know 
the arc be divide into space number from zero to ninety 
i will call down to -PRON- the number to which -PRON- must throw the lever -PRON- will repeat the number back to -PRON- and instantly obey -PRON- order 
trust -PRON- sir say but the professor be loath to let -PRON- go without still further impress upon -PRON- the importance of the work before -PRON- 
in order to alight safely mr munn -PRON- continue -PRON- must graduate the power of the antigravity cube to the mercurial atmosphere 
by proceed intelligently in the matter -PRON- shall make the car weigh slightly more than the atmosphere -PRON- encounter then when -PRON- be about to land -PRON- will let the car just counterbalance the pull of the planet and there will not be the slight jar understand professor i answer and go downstairs 
markham meig and popham ascend to the upper chamber this position bring -PRON- a few foot nearer the goal of -PRON- desire as well as give -PRON- a point of vantage from which to watch event 
gilhooly be the only one besides -PRON- in the low room -PRON- be kneel on the divan write imaginary stock quotation on the steel wall with the point of -PRON- finger 
for four hour or more the professor call out for slight variation in the speed of the car but in the main the lever be hold on the number which give a maximum velocity 
the tension of the minute usher in the last hour of the ten be beyond -PRON- power to describe 
once in -PRON- evil day i manipulate the tumbler of a combination and pull open a vault door 
behind the door stand two man with revolver 
for two second i stare agape at the trap which i have spring upon -PRON- and when i get away i have a bullet in -PRON- shoulder 
intensify -PRON- feeling fourfold as i stand look into the level revolver of those two man then spread out the two second to cover a half hour 
in this way only can i describe -PRON- state of mind while -PRON- fight for a safe landing on the planet mercury 
cry of wonder and apprehension echo to -PRON- from overhead 
above -PRON- i hear the shrill voice of the professor zero 
zero i repeat throw the lever clear over 
there follow a jolt as the screen cover the cube and shut off -PRON- energy 
instantly there come the sicken sensation of a fall accompany by a rush of displace air that roar and bellow all about the car shriek quinn 
i yell throw the lever half over 
then -PRON- catch -PRON- with a suddenness that throw -PRON- to -PRON- knee 
-PRON- be move upward could feel the steel floor rise under -PRON- 
twenty come down from above 
twenty i answer hoarsely struggle erect and shift the lever 
i feel that -PRON- be still rise but slowly 
the professor be juggle with an unknown atmosphere and on the success of -PRON- judgment depend -PRON- life 
fifteen 
fifteen and over go the lever for five degree 
-PRON- be swinge stationary in midair 
from the window by the switch board i look outward and downward with bulge eye 
a dazzling glow cover peak and plain and i turn away that -PRON- sight may not be blind to the lever number 
ten cry the professor 
ten -PRON- be and i throw the switch to the number give 
then again -PRON- drop but slowly very slowly 
five 
i repeat the order and again the air rush against the blunt base of the car yet not so fiercely as before 
then all of a sudden i feel a grip of finger about -PRON- throat and i be haul from the lever and throw back on the floor 
gilhooly have a knee on -PRON- breast and be strangle -PRON- with finger of steel 
the fire of an insane purpose gleam in -PRON- eye and -PRON- seem possess of the strength of a dozen demon 
i struggle but i may as well have try to rise under the thousandton pressure of a hydraulic press 
ten cry quinn 
i do not could not for -PRON- tongue be loll between -PRON- lip 
ten scream quinn be lose a groan hardly audible escape -PRON- gasping throat 
i hear a frantic clamor above and then there be such a jar and crash as i hope i shall never experience again 
all tangible life slip away from -PRON- and i collapse into an unconsciousness that i feel may be death -PRON- 
a that -PRON- life be preserve and the car save from destruction be due to two circumstance one of -PRON- most peculiar and of farreache importance 
the less of the two circumstance be this the car have not drop to the plain but have have -PRON- downward rush intercept by an elevation so that the force of -PRON- fall be just about half what may have be expect 
as to the other and more vital circumstance the fall -PRON- be not what -PRON- would have be on -PRON- own sphere 
the pull of gravity on mercury as -PRON- afterward discover have only onethird the power -PRON- have on terra 
to this phenomenon be due many wonderful thing as the reader will discover before -PRON- have go very far 
i be not the first of -PRON- party to open -PRON- eye after the landing for when i sit up and stare about -PRON- i see the professor move around the steel chamber and minister to the other 
gilhooly be creep toward the divan on all four mutter something about a great slump in the market and chuckle over the way in which -PRON- have get out from under 
archibald meig be groan and try to lift -PRON- on -PRON- elbow augustus popham be on -PRON- knee wobble erratically and apparently undecided whether to say -PRON- prayer or to try and get up hannibal markham be flatten out along the floor the professor kneel over -PRON- and chafe -PRON- temple 
what sort of a navigator be -PRON- quinn ask meig crossly 
by gad -PRON- be more dangerous to make port with -PRON- than -PRON- be to sail through space blame the professor for a fault of mine meig i speak up warmly 
the broker look at -PRON- with something like contempt blame -PRON- for place an incompetent and irresponsible person at such an important post as the switch board say meigs 
-PRON- should have know that a man who hold -PRON- distorted view on the subject of personal property be not to be trust right add popham lift -PRON- to the divan 
gilhooly make an attack on -PRON- say -PRON- bear -PRON- down and come within one of strangle -PRON- 
quinn be the cause of abnormal condition persist meig who be bind to have quinn at fault for every evil that overtake -PRON- 
i get up rather more wrathful than the situation demand 
the fall have jar -PRON- temper no less than -PRON- body and i be in a mood to have the business out with meig at close quarter 
softly mr munn caution the professor 
-PRON- be well to have a deaf ear for these gentleman at time 
help -PRON- lift mr markham to the divan 
the professor word dispel -PRON- anger 
without another word to meig i go over and assist in get the food trust magnate into a more comfortable position 
markham be not long in recover and when -PRON- take stock of -PRON- -PRON- find that -PRON- be not much the bad for -PRON- shake up 
quinn call to -PRON- to go upstairs with -PRON- and see if any havoc have be work there 
-PRON- find that no particular damage have be do to the instrument or other material 
when -PRON- descend to the low chamber after an absence of fifteen or twenty minute meig have the key in the steel door and be stand at the entrance with popham and markham on either side of -PRON- 
where do -PRON- get that key demand the professor one hand grope in -PRON- pocket 
heretofore -PRON- have be careful to keep the key upon -PRON- person 
small wonder that -PRON- be now surprised to find -PRON- in the possession of meig find -PRON- on the floor reply the broker with a good deal of dignity 
probably -PRON- lose -PRON- out of -PRON- pocket when -PRON- fall from the stair a few minute ago what be -PRON- intend to do ask the professor quietly 
professor quinn sir return meig with elaborate condescension -PRON- have reach the parting of the way 
while -PRON- be travel through space i and -PRON- friend could do nothing less than bear with -PRON- company and with that of the rogue at -PRON- side but now that -PRON- be safely moor on mercury and can debark -PRON- see fit to withdraw -PRON- and renounce further intercourse with -PRON- 
ah murmur quinn a slow smile hover about -PRON- thin lip 
the smile cause some acerbity to manifest -PRON- in the three gentleman at the door 
-PRON- draw -PRON- up haughtily 
quinn go on the broker sharply -PRON- lure -PRON- into -PRON- castle and abduct -PRON- from -PRON- native orb with small regard for the feeling of -PRON- relative or friend and no consideration whatever for the business interest with which -PRON- be engage so -PRON- business interest have -PRON- every consideration interrupt the professor 
meig take no notice of the remark 
so -PRON- continue remember these wrong -PRON- feel that -PRON- can no longer associate with -PRON- 
as for -PRON- turn a fastidious eye in -PRON- be utterly impossible to man of -PRON- social standing 
this planet -PRON- tell -PRON- be three thousand mile in diameter 
may -PRON- request that -PRON- and munn take one end of the diameter and leave the other end to -PRON- 
the professor laugh softly and seat -PRON- 
sit down mr munn say -PRON- 
-PRON- have be ostracize by -PRON- fellowexile 
let -PRON- see how well -PRON- get along without -PRON- 
-PRON- bid -PRON- farewell finished meig loftily 
thereupon -PRON- turn the key throw open the doorand drop on the threshold as though -PRON- have be shoot 
markham and popham cry aloud throw -PRON- arm across -PRON- face and reel back 
a blast as from a furnace drive in at the opening fill the chamber like a draft from hade 
i could scarcely breathe in the stifle atmosphere 
hurry munn cry quinn 
drag meig away from the door or hell be burn to a crisp 
the broker be already smoke when i catch -PRON- ankle and jerk -PRON- inside 
the professor slam the door 
presently the air within the car readjust -PRON- to normal condition 
meig red as a beet and breathing heavily be little the bad for -PRON- warm experience fancy mr meig coo the professor that -PRON- will wish to avail -PRON- of one of -PRON- antitemperature bath before cut loose from -PRON- and mr munn 
there be plenty of water leave for all of -PRON- and i will go aloft set up the collapsible tub and make the bath ready 
-PRON- have alight in the tropic evidently and at the period of midsummer 
the temperature be about five hundred degree fahrenheit 
with that the professor take the key from the door to keep gilhooly from make a dash outside and start for the storeroom 
i follow -PRON- the three disgruntle gentleman gaze after -PRON- mutely 
the professor and i be the first to fortify -PRON- with the antitemperature bath 
after dip -PRON- body -PRON- rinse -PRON- clothing in the liquid 
aside from a pleasant cool sensation the bath give no evidence of -PRON- potent quality 
there be no hardening of the skin as i fancy there may be no change in -PRON- ruddy color no inconvenience 
when -PRON- go down again -PRON- send the other three gentleman aloft the professor instruct -PRON- as to the necessity of make -PRON- clothing as well as -PRON- body proof against the climate 
in due course popham meig and markham once more show -PRON- 
gilhooly of course have also to be make immune and -PRON- struggle against -PRON- so fiercely that -PRON- be oblige to hold -PRON- in the tub while the professor pour three bucket of the mixture over -PRON- 
-PRON- be not disrobe and when sufficiently drench -PRON- leap from the tub and flee rave to the low chamber 
now say the professor -PRON- be prepared to fare forth 
-PRON- address -PRON- to markham meig and go with mr munn and -PRON- or keep by yourself as -PRON- may elect 
but -PRON- will be well to make this car -PRON- headquarters 
here -PRON- have food and drink also a stronghold in case of attack by the there happen to be any 
how can there be any life in such an overheat atmosphere inquire markham 
nature be a great leveler of barrier reply quinn 
-PRON- be able to adjust life to -PRON- environment -PRON- may be sure just as easily as -PRON- can bridge the social chasm that separate a thief from a trust magnate 
-PRON- eye twinkle 
such a bridge -PRON- add would not prove much of a tax on -PRON- resource 
for -PRON- own part i do not think the chasm either so wide or so deep as -PRON- gentleman appear to imagine 
i chuckle at that and meig and -PRON- two companion grow duly resentful 
as for mr gilhooly continue quinn -PRON- can not take -PRON- with -PRON- on -PRON- tour of observation 
-PRON- will be good to leave -PRON- lock in the car 
i will close the trap lead into the storeroom and i do not think -PRON- will be possible for -PRON- to work much damage in the room below donot know what good -PRON- will do -PRON- to go out with -PRON- explore expedition say popham dejectedly in a country as hot as this there can be no earthly use for coal 
or wear apparel add meig listlessly 
cotton couldnot grow in such a temperature 
and as for wheat 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head wearily 
cotton and wheat be the abc of -PRON- wall street experience 
beyond those commodity -PRON- grope in the dark 
what sort of food can be grow on such a sunbaked planet grumble markham 
the railway man be shout something about water stock and -PRON- babbling be waft up to -PRON- 
gilhooly add markham be the only fortunate man in the party 
realization will blast the hope and mayhap prove the death of the rest of -PRON- while hehe can not realize 
-PRON- gentleman lose courage too quickly say the professor 
in -PRON- lecture on venus i tell -PRON- how that planet be incline to the plane of -PRON- orbit 
the axis of mercury have a still great inclination in fact the orb lean on -PRON- as though about to fall 
-PRON- day be of about the same length as the day of three minute longerbut -PRON- year owe to -PRON- contract orbit be much short 
in eightyeight day mercury make -PRON- round so that each season be only twentytwo day in length 
at the pole of mercury in what answer to the polar region of -PRON- own earth there must be a more tempered climate then let -PRON- get there by all mean cut in popham 
in whatever -PRON- do answer quinn -PRON- must make haste slowly get out and look around anyhow cry meig 
-PRON- may happen after all that -PRON- have a world to conquer here and i have not the patience to remain longer in this steel cell of yours 
very good return the professor 
-PRON- will make -PRON- preparation and go forth 
-PRON- shut off the flow of oxygen from the tank and then follow the rest of -PRON- to the under apartment close a steel door over the trap at the head of the stair and lock -PRON- 
gilhooly imagine -PRON- a conductor be walk around the edge of the circular divan collect ticket from imaginary passenger 
sing sing -PRON- call out as the professor unlock the door at the entrance and pull -PRON- open where -PRON- get off munn say meig maliciously where -PRON- all get off return the professor smile 
thereupon -PRON- pass hastily into the blind glare of the mercurial day 
for several minute -PRON- eye rebel at the brightness when finally -PRON- become inured to -PRON- -PRON- look around -PRON- upon a desolation that strike dismay to -PRON- heart 
-PRON- see then that -PRON- car have alight upon an elevation which be nothing less than the rim of an extinct volcano of vast proportion 
from ridge to ridge across the abysmal crater at least half a mile could be measure 
-PRON- be beyond the power of -PRON- eye to penetrate to the black depth of the great pit 
listen cry the professor -PRON- voice resound so thunderously as almost to deafen ussome trick of the atmosphere 
-PRON- stand silently -PRON- ear alert and hear a confused babel of sound proceeding apparently out of the very core of the volcano fire may be at work down there whisper the professor nodding toward the crater 
even the whisper sound unpleasantly loud to -PRON- 
what a world come from augustus popham in bellow tone 
with fire within and without what chance be there for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
some of meigs peevishness have get into the coal man and -PRON- rent the air with -PRON- 
-PRON- remain mule after this outburst i with -PRON- gaze hopefully on the professor and the professor blink at the sun 
in a little time i allow -PRON- own eye to falter zenithward and the glory of the sun in midheaven have ever since be one of the treasured memory of -PRON- life 
-PRON- disk be six time -PRON- diameter as view from earth and the grandeur of -PRON- flaming surface be beyond the power of -PRON- feeble pen to make known 
i be oppress and hold captive by a feeling of awe and wonder 
there be a red tinge to the atmosphere cause by a reflection from the red of the planet bricklike crust through this warm color pulse the golden streamersyellow and scarlet overhead fade to faint orange on the horizon 
think -PRON- mr popham murmur the professor -PRON- voice awaken -PRON- as from a trance that all yon splendor which have be in these sky for age upon age be create for the enjoyment of no live thing 
if so -PRON- be wrong 
there be now as there have always be being with an intelligence capable of appreciate all this magnificent profusion of light and color 
but enough 
-PRON- have look down into the crater and up into the heaven suppose -PRON- turn -PRON- eye another way and see what there be to offer 
-PRON- face about as -PRON- speak and gaze down the bare rocky slope of the volcano and off across an equally bare and forbid plain 
no tree no water no life of any kind mutter meig querulously 
there be a bright spot over there say quinn shade -PRON- eye and point 
-PRON- eye follow -PRON- finger and encounter a glittering object on a slight elevation 
as -PRON- gaze the object whatever -PRON- be slowly vanish 
-PRON- may investigate that suggest popham excitedly 
perhaps -PRON- be a mercurial wear a sort of armor to protect -PRON- from the heat 
-PRON- may be that there be people here and that -PRON- live underground 
-PRON- would have start forthwith but the professor stretch out a hand and detain -PRON- 
just a moment say quinn 
before -PRON- get too far from the car let -PRON- make sure that all of -PRON- be sufficiently immune from the heat 
do -PRON- feel that -PRON- be fully protect in that respect gentleman 
so far as i be personally concerned i have not feel the slight inconvenience from the sun ray 
i declare as much and the other likewise so express -PRON- another one of the thing speak up meig point in another direction 
-PRON- be just able to detect a glow on another low elevation when -PRON- also flash into thin air 
then -PRON- begin look for the little hill and count no less than a dozen within -PRON- range of vision 
some of the hill be cap with the mysterious gleam which dazzle for a time and then twinkle out 
the professor be perplex as i could see plainly examine one of those hill say meig and find out what this mean 
the top of the volcano where -PRON- be stand be perhaps five hundred foot from the plain 
as meig speak -PRON- leap for a rock a yard or so below -PRON- 
to the astonishment of all of -PRON- -PRON- rise in the air like a human balloon soar over the rock by a score of foot and alight several rod down the slope 
-PRON- be a titanic jump but meig have regain a foothold with the lightness of a piece of down 
-PRON- be a large man be meigs -PRON- ponderosity exceed two hundred pound fairbank 
-PRON- be as much surprised at -PRON- agility as -PRON- be and begin to essay various feat 
-PRON- leap straight upward gain a maximum height of a dozen yard and return lightly and easily to -PRON- original position 
next -PRON- couple -PRON- leap with an aerial somersault and carry on with an abandon much beneath the dignity of a wall street broker as -PRON- strike -PRON- 
in fact -PRON- act like a schoolboy out for a holiday and so full of animal spirit -PRON- hardly know what to do with -PRON- think -PRON- belong to a circus observe the disgusted popham go down there and put a stop to the performance 
and go along and help add markham visibly distract because of the broker folly 
-PRON- start down the steep with rodlong step and presently one would have think -PRON- wear sevenleague boot from the amount of speed -PRON- develop 
instead of put a stop to the broker performance -PRON- join in 
by and by -PRON- be play leapfrog every bound take -PRON- forward half a hundred foot 
gravity here be far from have the force -PRON- have on terra remark the professor 
exertion come easy and give most astonishing result 
those man mr munn be not use to such activity yet -PRON- marvelous gymnastic do not seem to tire -PRON- in the least 
suppose that -PRON- -PRON- make a test of the mercurial gravity 
i need no second bidding and quinn and i take the descent as buoyantly as thistledown before the wind 
somehow the lightness of -PRON- heel get into -PRON- head and the staid professor and -PRON- begin cavort like a pair of tenyearold 
the delightful freedom of movement be as novel as -PRON- be exhilarate 
liberty of muscle breed license of mind have -PRON- be smoke opium -PRON- could not have act more outrageously 
nor be there any fatigue apparent 
i feel that i could have run a hundred mile in as many minute and never pause for breath 
carry away by the wonderful effect of diminished gravity -PRON- forget all about -PRON- project investigation of the little hill 
in the midst of a game of tag -PRON- be suddenly bring to -PRON- sense with a round turn 
a pall have fall over the landscape 
the sun be blot out by inky cloud and a tremendous wind begin to blow 
-PRON- must get back to the car cry quinn 
-PRON- voice great in volume though -PRON- be be all but drown in the shriek and roar of the blast 
the lightness that have afford -PRON- so much enjoyment in still air now become a source of grave danger for -PRON- could not keep -PRON- foot in the fury of the temp 
merciful power roar popham as -PRON- and meig be drive against each other with a terrific impact 
although sorely put to -PRON- to keep -PRON- from be blow away i manage to cling to a rock and watch the weird gyration of the two millionaire 
-PRON- collision have cause -PRON- to lose -PRON- footing and cling desperately to each other -PRON- be hurl back and forth touch the ground now and then only to rebound from -PRON- like rubber ball 
and all the time this tumbling be go on both man be whoop frantically for some one to come to -PRON- aid 
i be too hard beset to think of leave -PRON- place of temporary refuge and -PRON- be only when i see the professor and markham -PRON- right hand clasp stagger toward the two man that i make up -PRON- mind to join -PRON- 
three of -PRON- in a chain may be able to do something toward rescue popham and meig 
breathe deep like a swimmer about to plunge through a whirlpool i cast -PRON- adrift and allow the wind to drive -PRON- in the direction of the professor and markham 
no matter how strongly i brace backward against the blast every time i lift a foot i be hurl onward and almost overturn 
finally more by good luck than anything else i come close enough to catch the professor hand 
popham and meig will be kill if -PRON- canot get to -PRON- shout markham 
there be eddy in the wind like those in the swift current of a stream and popham and meig have become entangle in -PRON- 
have -PRON- be blow off on a straightaway course -PRON- would long since have be too far away for -PRON- to do anything toward lay hand on -PRON- and get -PRON- upright 
the professor have take note of the gyratory movement of -PRON- hapless companion and -PRON- call upon markham and -PRON- to plant -PRON- as firmly as possible and remain in -PRON- present position 
this be easy say than do yet by call upon every ounce of -PRON- reserve strength -PRON- contrive after a fashion to keep -PRON- place 
popham and meig be bound and leap through the arc of a great circle 
all -PRON- have to do be to remain where -PRON- be and wait for -PRON- 
-PRON- come to -PRON- in midair and -PRON- have literally to reach up and pull -PRON- down 
for a space the five of -PRON- be tangle in an indiscriminate heap -PRON- united weight offer great resistance to the wind and give -PRON- an opportunity to rest and collect -PRON- scatter wit 
join hand cry the professor and well get under the lee of that rock 
careful now 
-PRON- must not get separate again 
by desperate work -PRON- succeed in get to -PRON- foot and clasp hand then hurl and buffet -PRON- gain the rock and fall breathless under the leeward side of -PRON- 
what a place what a place groan popham wish venus hadnot be out of -PRON- course wail meig 
certainly -PRON- couldnot have be any bad off there than here 
no wonder nothing can grow on this sunscorched world growl markham 
even if plant could stand the heat such a wind would pull -PRON- up by the root 
what be -PRON- to do now demand popham 
-PRON- get -PRON- into this quinn and -PRON- have get to get -PRON- out of -PRON- a good time for -PRON- three to go off to the other side of the planet i remark 
whenever there s danger -PRON- suddenly realize that -PRON- canot get along without the professor 
oh -PRON- be a fine lot of nabob -PRON- be 
peace mr munn call the professor 
-PRON- have enough to occupy -PRON- mind without waste time in useless bickering 
i be at fault for i know what terrible gale visit this planet and that -PRON- come suddenly 
-PRON- be a mistake to venture so far from the car mistake breathe meig with some heat that come near have tragic consequence 
popham and i be knock about like a couple of football to be do what s to be do cry popham impatiently 
the gale be increase and who know but this rock may be pluck up bodily and roll over -PRON- 
-PRON- canot stay here 
that be true say the professor 
-PRON- must get back to the car no tell what will become of -PRON- if -PRON- try that call markham 
and there s no tell what will become of -PRON- if -PRON- remain here answer the professor 
if -PRON- form a chain -PRON- be quite possible that -PRON- may succeed in get back to -PRON- refuge 
even the car may not be able to stand up against this wind clamor meig 
-PRON- shall have to take -PRON- chance with -PRON- nevertheless go on quinn 
if -PRON- should get separate each of -PRON- must make the good preparation -PRON- can to weather the gale and then when -PRON- have blow -PRON- out hunt for the car 
that must be -PRON- rendezvous during the time -PRON- be here 
the professor get up slowly brace -PRON- against the fierce swirl that come around the side of the rock 
come -PRON- call -PRON- be now or never 
i could see that the gale have increase alarmingly 
-PRON- force seem irresistible and yet i know that -PRON- could not remain where -PRON- be 
-PRON- clasp hand again but be unable to cling together be lift high and throw helterskelter in all direction 
lightning flashedsuch lightning as i have never see before or since 
-PRON- snap and crackle overhead and run like trail serpent over the rock 
-PRON- be in a sea of flame 
and the thunder 
-PRON- seem to split the heaven and crack open the lavalike hill 
rain come yet not rain for -PRON- turn to damp vapor in the redhot atmosphere 
the mercurial element be at warwind steam thunder and lightning all marshal -PRON- host and charge to conflict 
to regain the steel car be impossible 
-PRON- be lose in the fearsome fury of darkness and storm drive helplessly and with smash force across the vast plain 
i be hurl against something which i grip with convulsive energy 
the something grip -PRON- in return 
help 
i cry bereft of -PRON- wit and eager only for rescue 
munn shout a voice 
be this -PRON- 
quinn 
i exclaim 
-PRON- must hang together say quinn 
and then tightly lock in each other arm -PRON- be lift high on a billow of fog and drive relentlessly i know not how far 
when the blast release -PRON- -PRON- fall to the rock and roll over and over then the surface beneath -PRON- give way and -PRON- drop 
the distance -PRON- fall could be only a matter of guesswork and even guesswork be out of the question in the disordered state of -PRON- mind at that moment 
suffice to say the fall do not render -PRON- unconscious and -PRON- strike on something that vibrate under the impact of -PRON- body 
-PRON- be still in blank darkness and the turmoil of the temp no longer beat about -PRON- but could be hear crash somewhere overhead 
thank heaven murmur the professor withdraw -PRON- from -PRON- 
be -PRON- alive mr munn believe so i answer 
what have happen to -PRON- professor 
-PRON- have be fling into some sort of a shelter -PRON- seem to -PRON- -PRON- reply 
but -PRON- be not on stable ground -PRON- add 
-PRON- be sit on an object that be descend with -PRON- descend rapidly andah wonder of wonder 
abruptly -PRON- fall into broad day surround by such sight and sound that i think -PRON- deal with the mystery of a disordered dream 
professor quinn and i be sit on a large box construct of metal that be polish to dazzle brilliancy 
so far as -PRON- purpose be concern this box be nothing less than an elevator -PRON- have fall upon -PRON- and -PRON- have carry -PRON- down into the wonderful interior of the planet 
now truly -PRON- be in another worlda world that teem with lifea smile and pleasant region underlie a most barren and inhospitable shell 
the scoriate exterior of the planet be the husk here be the kernel 
-PRON- be a white world extend league on league in every direction and roof with a lofty vault that sparkle as with star 
from every hand come a beelike hum proving that -PRON- be in a hive of industry and life 
house spread out before -PRON- in row queerly shaped structure that look as though -PRON- may have be build of alabaster and so diminutive that the tall scarcely come more than head high 
back of the house be field thickly cover with nodding blossom that look like snow through the field run waterway divide each into small square 
so intent be -PRON- on the background of this strange picture that -PRON- fail to take account of what be go on in -PRON- immediate vicinity 
suddenly a weird creature hop to the top of the box and stand between -PRON- companion and -PRON- regard -PRON- fixedly 
this i suppose be one of the mercurial 
if -PRON- consider the professor and -PRON- object of curiosity and surmise -PRON- be no less keen in so regard -PRON- 
-PRON- stand twentythree or twentyfour inch high -PRON- head be an ivory billiard ball and -PRON- trunk a large spheroid from -PRON- middle downward hang a red kirtle 
-PRON- have one eye at the front of the head and an ear at the back the olfactory organ be miss but there be a mouth opening perpendicularly under the eye 
the upper spheroid rest directly on the low and at each side of the low one correspond to the shoulder be two tentaclelike arm sinuous as whip and end in hand that be make up of a palm and seven digit 
queerest of all there be two more arm set in the breast and back 
from the creature shoulder be suspend a round object like a canteen 
for all of five minute quinn and i eye this surprising figure and be eye in return 
can -PRON- talk english ask the professor at last 
-PRON- be a foolish question such as i be far from expect from the professor but something have to be say and i suppose that be as good as anything else 
as the professor begin speak the head whirl squarely around present the ear 
after -PRON- companion be do the head spin back again and the breast arm catch the canteen while the finger of a shoulder arm begin manipulate a set of key 
the result be language with all the variation of tone and accent 
but -PRON- be an unknown tongue if an expression of that kind may be allow in such a case 
since the wordbox be as ineffective as -PRON- own speech -PRON- fall back with more success on the language of sign 
at this the mercurial have the well of -PRON- for -PRON- could make sign with four hand 
the professor signify that -PRON- be hungry and the mercurial signify that -PRON- be to descend from the box 
this -PRON- do and find -PRON- in the centre of a group of mercurial whose wordboxe be chatter like so many magpie 
the mercurial with whom -PRON- be already on gesticulate term play off some order on -PRON- own canteen and two of the other advance upon the box from which -PRON- have just descend 
pull out a slide in the side of the receptacle -PRON- expose two ewer of steam food and -PRON- be motion to fall to 
-PRON- stand not upon the order but obey instantly use a pair of small paddle which be thrust into -PRON- hand 
i have no idea what the food may be but -PRON- be tender and of good flavor bright little people observe the professor as -PRON- eat 
seemingly i respond 
nature have deny -PRON- the power of speech yet see how -PRON- have surmount the difficulty 
i must give that talk machine of -PRON- a close inspection 
-PRON- be in a most wonderful country mr munn 
the little i have see of -PRON- already quite daze -PRON- say what a pickpocket a man could make of -PRON- with all those hand 
quinn give -PRON- a reproachful look and i hastily apologize for even mention a branch of -PRON- profession 
do -PRON- understand now say -PRON- turn the subject very pleasantly what those bright object be which -PRON- see on the top of the low hill 
no say -PRON- be oven -PRON- answer 
food be put in -PRON- and send up to the hot surface of the planet 
when properly cook -PRON- be lower again 
association with this learned man be a liberal education in -PRON- 
i can never be sufficiently thankful to fate for cause -PRON- path to cross 
-PRON- think then say that -PRON- be blow to the top of one of the hill and fall into a shaft use by the travel oven 
nothing else could have happen 
the professor give a start and look worried 
dear dear -PRON- exclaim be quite forget -PRON- friend 
while -PRON- be here feast and take -PRON- ease -PRON- be battle with the storm and be no doubt in peril of -PRON- life 
how very very thoughtless -PRON- be mr munn 
i be not greatly exercise over the matter 
the trust magnate believe that there be a figurative gulf between -PRON- and -PRON- and i be more than willing that this gulf should grow from the symbol to the reality doubt if -PRON- can return to the outside of the planet at present professor say and even if -PRON- be able to do so what could -PRON- accomplish in the face of that tremendous storm 
true very true say -PRON- 
that oven say by way of take -PRON- mind from the plutocrat must have be very warm when -PRON- land on -PRON- and descend to these region 
-PRON- should have be grill sir return the professor but for the fact that -PRON- be coat and -PRON- clothing impregnate with -PRON- antitemperature fluid 
these mercurial appear to stand the heat pretty well i remark 
cover as -PRON- be with the antitemperature compound -PRON- return -PRON- be impossible for -PRON- to judge even approximately of the degree of heat that obtain in these region 
naturally -PRON- must be very much less than prevail on the surface of the planet and yet even at that if leave unprotected -PRON- should probably be shrivel to cinder 
hardly professor i venture to protest 
those i wave -PRON- paddle toward the open growing rank with a white herb which be evidently cook in these oven and serve for food 
quite likely -PRON- be eat of -PRON- now and very good eating i find -PRON- 
however the point i wish to make be this if the heat be so intense as -PRON- surmise those field would be wilt and dry up 
nature mr munn answer the professor adapt -PRON- to every condition 
on -PRON- own planet -PRON- see how life and comfort be render possible in every zone from the farth north to the tropic and this same adaptability of intelligent creature to -PRON- environment -PRON- may be sure proceed throughout the universe 
these oneeare oneeye diminutive creature be form in the manner best calculate to afford -PRON- comfort and happiness amid these surrounding 
and as with -PRON- so with the product of -PRON- husbandry 
-PRON- could argue a squirrel out of a tree professor say with wholesouled admiration be sorry i do not take a course of scientific training for -PRON- would have help -PRON- immensely in -PRON- business 
a burglar should be an allaround man 
if i ever return to terra so long as -PRON- feel as -PRON- do regard -PRON- odious profession mr munn break in the professor compress -PRON- lip -PRON- will never return to terra return be possible 
i ask hide the wonder -PRON- word arouse 
anything be possible 
how about the millionaire 
be -PRON- to return provide the mean be at hand 
provide -PRON- experience a change of heart 
in -PRON- present state of delusion -PRON- be mere firebrand of destruction 
before -PRON- ever again take part in mundane affair -PRON- must be teach to see thing differently 
i wonder what have become of -PRON- 
the professor brow cloud with anxiety fret about -PRON- professor say -PRON- be not overeager for -PRON- society 
let -PRON- have a taste of shift for -PRON- without -PRON- knowledge and resourcefulness to shield -PRON- from everything that go wrong 
-PRON- will do -PRON- a world of good 
perhaps -PRON- be right mr munn -PRON- companion answer musingly 
if i could know -PRON- have survive the storm i should feel tolerably easy in -PRON- mind 
these little mercurial appear to be a friendly people and if -PRON- comrade escape that frightful tempest -PRON- must sooner or later fall into the hand of these dweller of the underworld suppose i venture seek to draw -PRON- companion mind from the plutocrat that this mercurial underworld be another illustration of the way nature take care of -PRON- protgs 
after bake the outside shell of the planet to a degree that make all life impossible -PRON- thoughtfully scoop out the interior so that these small creature will have a place to go 
-PRON- have state the case correctly mr munn and the professor face light up as -PRON- sweep -PRON- gaze over the country immediately adjacent 
these oven -PRON- proceed be a remarkable example of adapt mean to an end 
the fierce heat of the surface do the cooking 
popham will find little pleasure in that i laugh 
like the rest of -PRON- answer the professor grimly -PRON- will have to accustom -PRON- to new condition 
everything must be different here from the surrounding with which -PRON- have be familiar all -PRON- life 
i wonder what form of property be consider most valuable to these mercurial 
the professor frown 
-PRON- mind be run in -PRON- old groove despite -PRON- novel environment 
that query be inspire by an unworthy motive mr munn say quinn severely 
i bow humbly 
every man -PRON- own way say can not help try to adjust -PRON- along the line of the principle i know good 
nevertheless i be of an intensely curious disposition and those talkboxe fill -PRON- with wonder 
the mercurial be dumb -PRON- seem answer the professor and -PRON- have to resort to purely mechanical mean for an exchange of idea 
language appear to flow readily enough from the little box 
if any one of -PRON- ever lose -PRON- four hand i observe -PRON- would not only find -PRON- impossible to help -PRON- but would be unable to tell other what to do to help -PRON- 
nature have be prodigal with -PRON- in the matter of hand and in this no doubt show -PRON- usual wisdom be glad to see -PRON- thought take a philosophical trend mr munn say the professor 
-PRON- argue well for -PRON- future 
by that time -PRON- have empty the receptacle of food and as -PRON- drop -PRON- paddle and draw back the wordboxe of a hundred mercurial shriek despairingly 
the pygmy cluster about the empty basin glare into -PRON- and then turn -PRON- menacing eye on the professor and -PRON- 
goodness -PRON- mr munn exclaim the professor 
-PRON- have probably eat the food supply of the entire district 
if -PRON- do not have a care -PRON- voracious appetite be like to prove -PRON- undoing 
look there come more of the mercurial after -PRON- supper warrant and -PRON- be go to be disappoint 
i look in the direction indicate by the professor and see a long line of billiard ball roll -PRON- way 
-PRON- be a procession head by a pompous little mercurial whose trunk and arm be gorgeously gild 
with two of -PRON- hand -PRON- carry a metal plate and spoon and with the other two -PRON- wield a silver baton about the size of a match 
plate and paddle be also carry by the rest of the advance mercurial -PRON- wordboxe chant a sort of quickstep 
the sight of the professor and -PRON- tower mountainlike over the throng about -PRON- bring the procession to an abrupt halt with a squeak of dismay 
the gentleman in the red kirtle go forward and hold converse with the gentleman of the gilt torso 
before -PRON- get through -PRON- wordboxe be fairly roar and stricken groan go up from every talkmachine in the line 
the advent of two leviathan like -PRON- companion and -PRON- must have have a demoralizing effect but that seem as nothing in comparison with the harrowing result of -PRON- voracity 
the leader raise -PRON- baton 
silence fall 
the leader then advance to where -PRON- be stand and circle around -PRON- examine -PRON- critically with -PRON- solitary eye 
the survey finish -PRON- try -PRON- wordbox on -PRON- the professor answer in all the language of -PRON- home planet living and dead of which -PRON- be master 
but in vain -PRON- could not come to an understanding 
the begild gentleman finally give over and whirl on the underling in the red kirtle 
-PRON- finger fly over the key of -PRON- canteen and speech of a swift and commanding kind be pour out 
a skurrying about of the oven tender result 
from somewhere a fresh supply of uncooked food be bring and place in the huge metal box 
while this be go forward quinn suddenly seize -PRON- arm a troubled look cross -PRON- face 
what be the matter professor 
i ask 
matter enough mr munn -PRON- answer 
the lever be leave on number five 
-PRON- thought be up with the steel car 
i be surprised at this for -PRON- appear to -PRON- that there be more than enough to claim -PRON- full attention right in -PRON- immediate vicinity 
and what of that sir 
i ask 
the antigravity cube lighten the car by five degree -PRON- answer excitedly 
thus buoy and in -PRON- elevated position i doubt if the car should hold -PRON- own against the fury of the storm 
-PRON- think -PRON- have be blow aye 
blow to the uttermost part of mercury and perhaps wreck and lostlost with all -PRON- scientific apparatus and other paraphernalia 
but and that be not all go on the professor 
the lever should have be throw to zero and then remove to prevent gilhooly from tamper with -PRON- 
who know what that mad railway magnate may take -PRON- into -PRON- head to do 
suppose -PRON- be to grasp the lever and give the cube -PRON- full power 
-PRON- would be launch into the void sir and -PRON- should be maroon on this sunbake planet compel to live out -PRON- life with these oneeye quadrumana devastate the country of -PRON- food supplyour presence a curse instead of a blessing 
i have already imagine a possible return to terra and from this -PRON- seem that the professor have not lose sight of that contingency 
what be to be do 
i ask catch some of -PRON- excitement 
-PRON- must return to the outer shellwe must find the carwe must go back on the oven when -PRON- send -PRON- up 
as -PRON- finish speak quinn run frantically to the metal box and leap to -PRON- top 
i follow clumsily upset a half dozen mercurial who chance to gel in -PRON- way 
the oven be load by that time and ready for -PRON- return to the intense heat nay more the chef in the red kirtle already have -PRON- hand on a wheel which presumably release the lifting power 
-PRON- movement however have act as a check on proceeding get to go back cry the professor forgetting in -PRON- stress of feeling that -PRON- word be lose on the throng around -PRON- attempt to stop -PRON- donot return the mercurial begin leap to the box from all side in a veritable swarm 
carry away by the excitement of the moment i sink to -PRON- knee and sweep -PRON- arm about -PRON- throw -PRON- back pellmell 
the professor also resort to violence 
in the midst of -PRON- all i catch a glimpse of the gilded gentleman aim -PRON- baton 
a moment more and there be a lurid flash which envelop -PRON- companion and -PRON- in a billow of violet fire 
every atom of strength be draw from -PRON- limb and i fall limply to the ground with the professor on top of -PRON- 
-PRON- be not the violet fire that do the work for the professor and -PRON- 
rather -PRON- be some chemical know to the mercurial and which manifest -PRON- presence by an overpower odor 
long after -PRON- have regain consciousness the druglike smell clung to -PRON- clothe and sap -PRON- strength 
shackle of iron could not have be more effective in make -PRON- prisoner 
cord be make fast to -PRON- foot and -PRON- be drag by a small army of mercurial down the principal street of -PRON- city and out into one of the white irrigated field 
have a dwelling be find large enough i presume -PRON- should have be comfortably house but -PRON- be of such stupendous proportion that there be no wall capable of contain -PRON- 
when -PRON- reach the field a ring a foot high be rear about -PRON- 
as the odor lessen and -PRON- strength increase i try to roll over this low barrier but receive such a shock that i be only too glad to roll back to the professor side again 
-PRON- be of no use mr munn say the professor who have be watch -PRON- attempt 
these mercurial be possess of way and mean beyond -PRON- earthly power to combat 
-PRON- must accept the situation with all the philosophy -PRON- can muster 
this great man who could remain unshaken under any fate that befall -PRON- be a constant source of strength and inspiration to -PRON- 
while -PRON- lay forsake by -PRON- captor and couch on the strange white herbage of that underground field -PRON- discourse drift along many channel 
i remember that i ask -PRON- a question concern a matter that have long be weigh upon -PRON- mind 
how be -PRON- professor say that -PRON- antigravity compound remain in a liquid state in an open cask 
i should think -PRON- inherent energy would cause -PRON- to fly upward en masse can demonstrate that by mean of an algebraic formula say -PRON- 
be -PRON- acquaint with algebra 
no i answer humbly 
then -PRON- go on disappointedly fear -PRON- will have to remain in ignorance 
-PRON- must rest content with the evidence of -PRON- sense since an explanation in term -PRON- can understand be impossible 
and thus the matter rest 
when -PRON- be so far recover as to be able to rise -PRON- make an attempt to step over the ring that hem -PRON- in but be shock by the same unseen power i have already encounter and drive back 
see with what weapon nature have provide these people murmur the professor 
throughout the universe everywhere -PRON- will find mr munn that nature take care of -PRON- own 
ah here come captain goldman 
retainer follow and -PRON- be bringingnow what be -PRON- bring 
why as i live -PRON- have manufacture a couple of large wordboxe 
evidently -PRON- be to be teach the use of -PRON- 
the professor be right 
ever since -PRON- disastrous attempt to regain the surface -PRON- have be taboo by the inhabitant of the country 
captain goldman as -PRON- companion refer to the little man who have use -PRON- mysterious baton with such tell effect be cross the field toward -PRON- follow by six of -PRON- countryman bear the talk machine 
as a precautionary measure the captain carry -PRON- weapon 
arrive at the ring captain goldman reverse the baton and with the black tip of -PRON- cut an imaginary doorway for -PRON- in the air 
-PRON- then step through and join -PRON- without shock or resistance 
thus by mean to -PRON- inexplicable -PRON- break the power of the circle at a give point 
the other follow -PRON- through the entrance -PRON- have clear 
wield the baton with two of -PRON- hand captain goldman begin manipulate -PRON- wordbox with the other two 
-PRON- be not address -PRON- however but those who have come with -PRON- 
three of -PRON- follower advance to -PRON- with one of the machine while the remain three convey a machine to the professor 
at once -PRON- instruction in the art of mechanical speech begin 
-PRON- be not -PRON- intention to burden the reader with the detail of -PRON- lesson although a few remark under this head may not be out of place 
as to the wordbox -PRON- -PRON- have seven key 
this make -PRON- somewhat difficult for a fivefingere creature to operate with any great degree of fluency although the professor do get so -PRON- could peg out -PRON- idea at a remarkable rate 
there be but six syllable in the mercurial language each syllable be represent by a corresponding key 
the way these syllable be finger give the word 
as -PRON- could be combine and repeat and combine again the vocabulary of the box be practically unlimited 
the syllable note be of resonant quality and of such divergent timber as to be quickly and easily recognize 
the syllable for key be synonymous with -PRON- personal pronoun and be the most assertive and determined note in the whole gamut of the box 
the seventh key emit a sound so utterly unlike the other sound as to be in a class by -PRON- 
-PRON- be use for space between word for exclamatory purpose and for the audible expression of laughter and grief 
-PRON- be likewise the expletive or swearkey for these small egotist have all the passion of other mortal and key act as a sort of safety valve 
the manner in which the key be use give -PRON- -PRON- versatility 
day by day -PRON- lesson proceed the professor learn with a rapidity that be marvelous 
-PRON- be well along in the polysyllable while i be struggle with the basic tone and acquire some facility in spacing and in the expression of the feeling 
-PRON- ear keep pace with -PRON- finger and in a fortnight the professor be so eloquent with -PRON- wordbox that -PRON- could now and then play off a metaphor or some other frill to the great delight of -PRON- and -PRON- auditor 
next to a wonderful jimmy invent by a cracksman name cricket doniphan whom i know well and who at that period be do time in stillwater i take off -PRON- hat to that mercurial wordbox as the most marvelous contrivance ever evolve by a think mind 
i have a very good memory and when sufficiently proficient with the key i practice by repeat passage from forty way of crack safe which as distinguish from the manual i consider -PRON- chef doeuvre 
i could not discover that -PRON- terse english faulty enough though -PRON- be lose anything in force from translation into the mercurial tongue 
the word tongue be use with reservation for of course tongue that language be not 
difficulty be experience in get a suitable mercurial equivalent for the good english word cracksman 
finally however i hit upon three quick touch of the swearkey which make the word intelligible in -PRON- own ear if not to any one else 
soon i begin to observe a little throng gathering across -PRON- side of the prison ring listen intently as i practice 
from day to day the throng increased 
over on the other side of the ring professor quinn be absorb in cut all manner of scientific caper with -PRON- wordbox 
the mutability of newtonian law form -PRON- staple theme and -PRON- be able to put -PRON- through the key with amazing variation 
but no crowd gather to listen to the professor 
the mercurial be all on -PRON- side of the compound 
thus -PRON- be clear to -PRON- that -PRON- brand of science be more attractive to the little people than the professor 
while the mutability of newtonian law languish for an audience the manual be fast acquire one that tax the capacity of the wordbox 
the professor for a long time have be so wrap up in -PRON- attempt to master the mercurial language that -PRON- have pay little heed to -PRON- and -PRON- effort 
the attention -PRON- work be secure however finally cause -PRON- to sit up and take notice 
halt -PRON- weighty remark -PRON- lay aside -PRON- talk machine come over to -PRON- side of the circle and stand behind -PRON- listen 
the first i know of -PRON- presence be the reaching of two angry hand over -PRON- head and the snatch away of the instrument on which i be at that moment recite the ten rule for a cracksman success 
-PRON- audience be as greatly put out as i be -PRON- 
while i be leap to -PRON- foot and whirl around -PRON- listener be clamor on -PRON- wordboxe for -PRON- to proceed 
professor quinn whiteface and in a great temper than i have ever before see -PRON- hold -PRON- talk apparatus over -PRON- head and seem of a mind to clash -PRON- down on the earth at -PRON- foot say professor i call restrainingly do anything rash 
mr munn -PRON- gasp -PRON- voice thick with suppress emotion be -PRON- confidence in -PRON- to be destroy utterly 
i single -PRON- out as one of the worthy of all those bring from terra and yet i find -PRON- busily inculcate false idea of personal property into the keen mind of these mercurial 
for shame sir 
would -PRON- demoralize this planet 
would -PRON- turn these lawabide people into thief 
professor i answer -PRON- idea and mine do not harmonize on this matter of property right 
while i admit mr munn -PRON- answer that condition on -PRON- own planet in a measure condone -PRON- action yet i maintain that -PRON- have no right to air -PRON- idea in njambai 
here the condition be of an altogether different sort 
so far as i have be able to learn this orb have not fall under the noxious spell of the monopolist 
-PRON- have no excuse for instruct the mercurial in the alpha and omega of -PRON- contemptible profession 
contemptible 
i repeat 
that be a hard term professor 
besides -PRON- seem to be fond of the instruction 
everybody listen to -PRON- while -PRON- havenot have so much as a corporal guard to enjoy that astronomical stuff -PRON- have be play off on -PRON- concertina 
-PRON- line perhaps be more attractive than -PRON- and the shadow of a smile curl about -PRON- thin lip for the notion of get something for nothing have a direct appeal to every thinking being 
on the other hand -PRON- thesis on the mutability of newtonian law require profound thought before -PRON- can be assimilate 
yet be that as -PRON- may i shall not allow -PRON- to degrade these people with the unworthy idea that have be come from -PRON- wordbox 
i can destroy this machine sir and i shall do so unless -PRON- promise never again to let an ignoble thought come out of -PRON- 
what do -PRON- say 
-PRON- mere command be enough professor i reply 
-PRON- be not necessary to couple -PRON- with a threat 
-PRON- face soften and -PRON- at once return to -PRON- -PRON- talkproducer beg -PRON- pardon mr munn say -PRON- have confidence in -PRON- word and know that i can trust -PRON- 
thereupon -PRON- go back to -PRON- own side of the ring and i apply -PRON- assiduously to undo any evil -PRON- illconsidered practicing may have work 
i tell the mercurial that -PRON- utterance have be in the nature of a fairy story and i give the lie to -PRON- conviction by declare that the reasoning as in all fairy tale be unsound 
from that hour -PRON- audience vanish 
the professor although -PRON- talk be profound and somewhat wearying seem to the mercurial as more worth while and -PRON- flock to hear -PRON- 
-PRON- begin acquire a knowledge of the country and of -PRON- people and institution with -PRON- very first lesson 
in two week -PRON- have gather most of the information that follow -PRON- planet -PRON- call njambai -PRON- country be baigol 
baigol be one of four kingdom comprise the underworld of njambai 
the other three kingdom be baijinkz baigossh and derive from the root word bai signify planet 
there be only two place on njambai where water be able to collect and defy the absorb power of the sun 
these place be at the two end of the planet axis correspond to the polar region of earth 
here there be sea feed river that run through the underworld and irrigate the field 
the kingdom of baijinkz and baigossh lie on the shore of these sea the former at the north and the latter at the south 
-PRON- be the only kingdom on the outer shell of njambai and levied tribute from the interior kingdom of baigol and baigadd for water right 
the distribution of light and heat throughout the neth kingdom be by a system of gigantic reflector locate at either end of a radius draw through the equator 
there be one stupendous reflector on either side of the planet measure no less than twenty spatli acrossa spatl be the equivalent of a geographical mile 
these reflector -PRON- be tell follow the sun as -PRON- move through the heaven and reflect heat and light to countless other reflector ingeniously place to acquire and radiate the solar energy 
the heat thus secure be further intensify by the planet shell which form the vault of the neth kingdom constantly diffuse warmth 
the king be golbai the nine hundred and twentyfifth of -PRON- line 
the name of the pompous gentleman whom the professor have christen captain goldman be ocou 
name of people place and thing as here give be simply a rude equivalent as nearly as can be render into english 
from -PRON- wording the astute reader will probably discover more than the six basic syllable of the baigol language 
the flexibility of the wordbox will account for this and the inconsistency be only seem and not real 
baigol have one half the inner sphere and baigadd the other half 
these two kingdom be not on the good of term owe to a wretched piece of business carry out by gaddbai king of the other country which will be advert to later 
the four kingdom be connect by a railway if such the mode of transportation could be call 
the roadbed be a groove and the wheel of the car be solid sphere with axle pierce through -PRON- diameter 
on these axle the carriage be support 
for a people so wonderfully progressive the baigol be strangely backward in -PRON- motive power -PRON- train be drag by handrelay of the small creature take -PRON- in charge 
owe to the diminished force of gravity large weight be easily handle and a fair rate of speed be develop by the train hauler 
but -PRON- be a very primitive method of transportation 
the trunk line connect the neth kingdom be know as the baigadd and baigol interplanetary system 
when two week of -PRON- enforce stay in baigol have pass a startling rumor be waft from the wordboxe of the other kingdom to the effect that the management of the line have secure a wonderful new traction power of tremendous speed and unlimited endurance 
the kingdom of baigol be agog with excitement for the president vicepresident and board of director of the interplanetary be to take a trial spin over the road in a special equip with -PRON- new motive power 
-PRON- have not yet be allow to leave the mysterious circle which imprison -PRON- but -PRON- could stand erect and so overtop the field and house that -PRON- be able to see the railway station 
billiard ball come roll in from every direction cluster about the right of way and clamber to roof top and other elevation that would afford an unobstructed view of the centre of excitement 
at last far off the professor and i hear a thunderous shout toot toot 
no wordbox could have be the source of that echo cry 
the professor give a gasp and clutch -PRON- arm convulsively 
do -PRON- recognize that voice -PRON- ask hoarsely 
merciful power mr munn how could such a thing happen 
look 
look 
over the field beyond the city leap along at fiftyfoot bound and drag behind -PRON- a train of queerlooke car crowd with official of the system come no less a person than emmet gilhooly 
the professor throw -PRON- at the barrier that hedge -PRON- round 
-PRON- could not pass although -PRON- struggle frantically 
take -PRON- coolly professor i urge grasp and hold -PRON- upright 
but this be outrageous mr munn -PRON- cry 
poor gilhooly 
be -PRON- the new traction power the other kingdom have be talk about 
how do -PRON- happen to be here 
and why be -PRON- treat -PRON- like that 
this must be stop -PRON- wordbox 
-PRON- eye sweep the ground 
glimpse -PRON- talk machine -PRON- dive for -PRON- and begin work the key like mad 
no one pay any attention to the furious language that go up under -PRON- frenzied finger however 
leviathan in harness absorb the entire attention of all the baigol and with another toot toot the railway magnate gallop out of sight 
-PRON- be a sad spectacle indeed 
i be almost as completely unmanned by -PRON- as be professor quinn 
let -PRON- not be suppose that -PRON- have give no thought to -PRON- companion in exile during -PRON- two week probation in baigol 
the professor and i have talk of -PRON- frequently wonder whether -PRON- be alive or dead and if alive where -PRON- be and what -PRON- be do 
-PRON- story have be punch out of -PRON- wordboxe for the benefit of the baigol but have not seem to make much of an impression on ocou or on other who come to see -PRON- 
now the sight of gilhooly would add corroborative detail and -PRON- harp on that key until ocou promise to communicate directly with king golbai and find out what -PRON- wish be in the matter 
as for the professor -PRON- want to go roam the four kingdom look for the other exile first visit baigadd and appropriate the motive power of the system 
the most -PRON- could get from ocou be a promise to learn -PRON- majestys pleasure in -PRON- affair and while -PRON- be abide the king decision other event take place which be of prime importance to -PRON- 
ocou have a queerlooke machine bear to -PRON- home circle which be the humorous fashion in which the professor refer to -PRON- prison ring 
the machine be an upright shaft measure some three foot in height 
to -PRON- base be attach a golden cord several yard long and terminate in a small silver disk 
professor quinn and i be consume with curiosity while this contrivance be be set up and make ready 
-PRON- put a question through -PRON- wordboxe but be only smile at mysteriously 
presently i be make to sit down turk fashion while one of attendant come to -PRON- and pass the silver disk over -PRON- head 
one end of baton have a black tip the other a white 
as the disk pass over -PRON- head ocou rest the white tip of the baton on the pedestal 
instantly a slide fly out of the shaft top bear a paint ideograph 
the professor and i be not up in the baigol ideograph and be very much surprised at the action of ocou and -PRON- companion when -PRON- look at the slide 
-PRON- recoil stare at -PRON- suspiciously and move about -PRON- with caution 
i grab -PRON- wordbox the matter anyhow 
i ask 
-PRON- have just discover that -PRON- be a robber say ocou be no robber here i answer no matter what i be in the place i come from 
once a robber always a robber retort ocou unless -PRON- touch the bolla 
well well murmur the professor rub -PRON- hand delightedly over the pedestal and give little heed to remark 
what do -PRON- call this machine mr ocou 
that sir ocou reply be a character indexograph 
-PRON- find -PRON- very useful in catalogue the natural tendency of subject of the realm 
-PRON- sigh 
the number of indexograph in the kingdom be limited and -PRON- have all be work overtime of late 
this be the first opportunity -PRON- have have to use one on -PRON- and -PRON- friend 
now professor if -PRON- will oblige -PRON- 
the professor drop down the disk glide over -PRON- bald head and another ideograph shoot into sight 
ah murmur ocou read the sign philanthropist scientist a man to counsel with do sir but -PRON- -PRON- shake -PRON- head sadly as -PRON- drop -PRON- talk machine suppose say watch ocou and -PRON- attendant make off with the indexograph that i shall be keep within this circle indefinitely 
let -PRON- hope not mr munn rejoin the professor lay a kindly hand on -PRON- arm 
rather let -PRON- hope that -PRON- will experience a moral rejuvenation so that when the indexograph be try on -PRON- at another time -PRON- will show a different result wish -PRON- would try that thing on archibald meig 
i exclaim 
the baigol would find i think that i have no monopoly on that particular ideograph 
the professor laugh quietly 
let -PRON- see what come to -PRON- now after -PRON- have be catalogue say -PRON- think -PRON- have simply be wait to make trial of -PRON- tendency before allow -PRON- to pass out of this enchant circle 
ocou come back in a couple of hour carry a roll of parchment in addition to -PRON- baton 
-PRON- come alone 
gentleman say -PRON- in -PRON- mechanical way -PRON- name have be enter and tag 
in accordance with the information secure through the indexograph a task have be set for -PRON- 
perform that task faithfully and -PRON- be to have the freedom of the realm 
what be the task mr ocou inquire the professor 
-PRON- be to restore the sacred bolla to -PRON- majesty the king of baigol 
and what be the bolla 
-PRON- be the stone of happiness and peace 
merely to touch -PRON- restore a mortal to health physical and moral 
crime be a contagious disease and since the bolla have be lose to -PRON- and untouched of any in the kingdom lawlessness have become widespread 
where be the bolla 
-PRON- be loan some season ago to the king of baigadd who now refuse to return -PRON- 
as baigadd be a more powerful country than ours -PRON- would be an act of destruction for -PRON- to make war for the stone 
so -PRON- king have graciously decree that mr munn shall proceed to the neighboring kingdom and steal the bolla take -PRON- along with -PRON- professor as adviser and general aide 
nothing could have please -PRON- more 
as i have state elsewhere in this narrative steal property from some one to whom that property do not rightfully belong can hardly be account a crime and when property thus purloin be restore to -PRON- rightful owner the theft be transform into a high and noble act 
such a task fill -PRON- with enthusiasm and i be ready to go forth among the fourhande enemy of baigol and demonstrate -PRON- ability 
the professor thinking of gilhooly would have welcome any undertaking which carry -PRON- into the neighboring realm 
ocou tell -PRON- that the king of baigadd be a very grasping individual although -PRON- be very careful to abstain from touch the bolla 
have -PRON- touch the wonderful stone so great be -PRON- power that -PRON- would have experience a change of heart immediately and could not have shirk return the property to -PRON- rightful owner 
king gaddbai be very wealthy accord to ocou draw -PRON- revenue principally from the kaka industry of which -PRON- have a monopoly 
ka be a fibrous plant from which kaka the only cloth know in the four kingdom be make 
this plant would grow nowhere else than in baigadd so that the people of the other three kingdom have to go to baigadd for -PRON- kirtle 
every time the king of baigadd suffer a pecuniary backset or donate a large sum to charity -PRON- recoup -PRON- exchequer by boost the price of kirtle 
there be a time ocou declare when all the inhabitant of njambai go clothe from neck to heel but wardrobe dwindle as the price of cloth rise 
very few people could now afford the luxury of a full suit and since the upper half of the body could not be cover with a garment -PRON- be cover with paintthe paint be usually of a color to match or harmonize with the kirtle 
a variety of black kaka be the only serviceable material to be have for write purpose ideograph be trace on -PRON- surface with white ink 
-PRON- be tell how gentleman once wealthy but who have fall upon evil day have draw upon -PRON- library for wear apparel 
book of poetry essay travel fiction all yield -PRON- leave to the making of various garment thereby clothe the body as comfortably as -PRON- have already clothe the mind 
what could be more apropos than a morning gown inscribe with choice ideographic sonnet 
or a student robe begemme with the brilliant wit of an essayist 
or a travel costume bear an account of some voyage of discovery 
the only fault to be find with this arrangement be that such clothing advertise the wearer poverty and in njambai as in terra the pride of wealth be most pronounce 
king gaddbai -PRON- appear have so enhance the cost of black kaka that literature lie languish 
writer have not the requisite material on which to inscribe -PRON- thought and the four kingdom be threaten with a blight of ignorance 
from what -PRON- hear of king gaddbai the professor and i be not dispose to regard -PRON- very favorably 
-PRON- seem a greedy and unscrupulous person more than ready to swell -PRON- coffer by trample on the right and the welfare of other 
the parchment roll bring by ocou be a map show -PRON- how to direct -PRON- step in order to reach baigadd 
ocou also deliver to -PRON- a royal banner direct from the hand of king golbai which be to procure -PRON- favor en route and entitle -PRON- to be receive and care for as ambassador when -PRON- reach the other kingdom 
the professor ask for a baton but this be deny -PRON- 
the baigol fear i suppose to trust such a terrible weapon in the hand of alien 
the professor pleasure over the prospect of be allow to leave -PRON- prison ring and journey in search of -PRON- friend while seek the bolla be mar somewhat by revelation 
-PRON- have hope to find njambai free of monopoly and greed and yet here be king gaddbai boost the price of kaka whenever the whim strike -PRON- and -PRON- have hope to find a people where poverty be unknown and yet -PRON- discover how the educate be oblige to raid -PRON- library in order to cover -PRON- nakedness 
human nature professor i expound be the same all over the universe 
if a man find -PRON- in a position to gouge -PRON- neighbor -PRON- be as apt to do -PRON- on jupiter or mercury as -PRON- be on terra be grievously discourage -PRON- sigh 
furthermore say -PRON- practicing on the wordbox could not have cause the havoc -PRON- imagine -PRON- may 
ocou tell -PRON- that since the bolla have be take from baigol lawlessness have be widespread and increase 
-PRON- rehearsal of the false sentiment contain in -PRON- book may have help on the lawlessness 
i be more sorry than i know how to express in find among this gifted people some of the bad element of -PRON- own civilization 
and -PRON- regret be the more pronounced on the score of popham meigs gilhooly and markham 
how do -PRON- figure in -PRON- disappointment 
i query -PRON- understand -PRON- cry have the same hope of -PRON- that i have of -PRON- 
suppose -PRON- find on this planet not a trace of monopoly or greed suppose -PRON- have find here a peaceloving justiceserve people with plenty to eat and wear need no law to govern -PRON- and all happy and contented 
the moral effect upon -PRON- and the rest of -PRON- friend would have be uplift 
-PRON- would have see admire and covet the same condition for -PRON- own orb 
a change would have be work in -PRON- and for the well 
that -PRON- go on passionately be the full measure of -PRON- disappointment 
so far from find such condition mr munn -PRON- be immediately catalogue as a thief and give a task commensurate with -PRON- suppose abilitiesa task or robbery 
but a righteous robbery i aver 
recover steal property and return -PRON- to the rightful owner be a meritorious act 
-PRON- must call -PRON- so -PRON- answer bitterly since so much hang upon -PRON- joint attempt 
but what a lesson for these poor benighted people 
the ability to get the stone be beyond -PRON- and -PRON- call upon -PRON- i pursue 
-PRON- action be flatter rather than otherwise 
if -PRON- succeed -PRON- mean that -PRON- shall stand even higher in -PRON- estimation 
-PRON- who ought to know better be make -PRON- live example of successful thievery 
the end justify the mean professor 
-PRON- must strive to think so suppose gilhooly have be catalogue the same as -PRON- and and that -PRON- be find to stand so high in traction affair that -PRON- let -PRON- not dwell upon poor gilhooly 
-PRON- be just where -PRON- ought to be i declare only wish -PRON- have a glimmering of sense still leave -PRON- in order that -PRON- may realize -PRON- position 
the effect would be salutary 
this frank expression of -PRON- view rather startled professor quinn 
-PRON- walk back and forth -PRON- hand clasp behind -PRON- and -PRON- head bow in deep thought 
the indexograph be a most remarkable invention -PRON- finally observe and would be of inestimable value on -PRON- native planet 
the detection of crime would be an easy matter and on the testimony of the indexograph alone justice could be mete out without the intermediate application of the court 
furthermore justice would never miscarry hope i exclaim in a panic that i shall never live to see the day when the police official of terra be equip with indexographs 
-PRON- would prove a knockout blow for -PRON- profession 
every citizen would be test and -PRON- proclivity jot down in black and white 
that would mean expand the professor that crime would be relegate to the limbo of lose art 
before a lawless act could be commit the artist in crime would be place where the deed would be impossible the way i figure -PRON- out professor 
but that be not the least of the indexographs merit 
child could be duly catalogued and if -PRON- show criminal tendency could be send to institution for proper moral training 
the inclination of the young toward certain trade could be learn and -PRON- could be give instruction along the line which would best serve -PRON- future career 
there would not be so many failure in life mr munn 
perhaps not i answer stubbornly but i still maintain that the overturning of -PRON- customary standard would land -PRON- in chaos 
tut -PRON- exclaim half angrily 
some day i trust -PRON- angle of vision will change materially 
until that time mr munn -PRON- would be well for -PRON- to repress -PRON- peculiar view for -PRON- be go to be sorry for -PRON- 
just three week to a day from the time -PRON- reach baigol -PRON- fare forth from the royal city bend upon the performance of -PRON- mission 
-PRON- be armed only with -PRON- wordboxe the king standard and a firm determination to achieve -PRON- liberty by secure the bolla no matter what the cost 
-PRON- journey lead -PRON- through a pleasant country level for the most part and cover with irrigated field grow the white blossom which the baigol gather and cook for food 
the king will as make know by the banner secure -PRON- rest by the way 
i have not consider -PRON- necessary to refer to the fact that there be light and darkness throughout the kingdom of baigol and baigadd during each period of twentyfour hour and three minute 
light and heat be send through the underworld by mean of the two huge reflector already mention and when the sun pass from the heaven of course night fall 
but the climate be at all time delightful 
-PRON- be armor against the temperature and could not -PRON- experience the equable air yet -PRON- eye and ear assure -PRON- of -PRON- presence and this prove another surprise for the professor 
by day -PRON- travel and by night -PRON- rest often cover as many as five hundred spatli in a single day 
four day at that rate be to carry -PRON- to the capital of the other kingdom 
i gather much wisdom from the professor as -PRON- journey and there be two of -PRON- conversation which make a deep impression on -PRON- 
the first have to do with the reflector that turn the sun ray into the bowel of the planet 
without the sun mr munn remark quinn indicate the white field beside -PRON- with a gesture of the hand there could be no vegetable life in baigol 
those field must be quicken to life by the solar ray or -PRON- would be as barren as the outer shell of the planet 
finite ingenuity may always be trust to accommodate -PRON- to -PRON- environment 
i can set the astronomer of terra right on one mystery at least 
what mystery do -PRON- refer to professor 
i ask 
why -PRON- answer a luminous point have be detect by earthly telescope on the disk of mercury 
the phenomenon have be explain as a huge mountain whose top reflect the sun yet -PRON- be only one of the great reflector fabricate by these ingenious people 
then at another time professor say have -PRON- make any discovery relative to that powerful little weapon which the baigol know so well how to use few -PRON- answer 
the baton be call a zetbai and -PRON- ammunition be draw from a peculiar ingredient of the atmosphere 
the white tip of the zetbai furnish the destructive force while the black tip combat and nullifie -PRON- 
the inhabitant of this orb mr munn have a weapon of such awful power in the zetbai that a dozen of -PRON- number arm with the baton could descend upon -PRON- own globe and devastate -PRON- 
well be -PRON- for terra that mean be lack for interplanetary communication otherwise the baigol and -PRON- fellowcreature may prove the napoleon of the universe 
such a contingency be terrible to contemplate 
have the zetbai anything to do with that invisible power that stay -PRON- from cross the circular wall 
-PRON- have everything to do with that 
an unseen barrier be place around usa barrier of zet draw from the atmosphere by these baigol and make to serve -PRON- end 
unlike powder and ball which destroy -PRON- in create destruction zet be indestructible -PRON- can be regathere into the zetbai and use over and over again 
the resist medium control by the black tip of the baton be alone powerful to annul the energy of the white tip 
these be the point that impress -PRON- 
another which -PRON- discuss but which do not appeal to -PRON- as logical or accurate have to do with the object of -PRON- questthe bolla 
with all due respect to mr ocou say -PRON- be certainly talk moonshine when -PRON- describe the bolla would not go so far as to say -PRON- be talk moonshine mr munn the professor answer 
there be strange thing in heaven earth and mercury than be dream of in -PRON- philosophy 
take -PRON- for instance 
-PRON- be a sick man never sick in -PRON- life i declare mean morally go on quinn 
if crime be a disease -PRON- will admit i think that -PRON- be sick 
no i aver be healthy in mind and body 
i take no stock in mr assertionswhich ought to prove that i be mentally sound i take -PRON- 
but well get this palladium just the same for -PRON- liberty depend on -PRON- 
toward noon of the fourth day as -PRON- draw near the boundary of baigadd -PRON- enter a rocky and uneven country the welldefine road -PRON- have be follow cut and circle through the low hill 
when -PRON- be well in among the bowlder a frantic shout reach -PRON- from around a bend in the road a few spatli ahead 
that be a cry in -PRON- own tongue mr munn exclaim the professor come to a halt 
do -PRON- not hear -PRON- 
-PRON- be certainly a call for help 
-PRON- be right sir i answer 
that be a lusty english yell if i ever hear one 
-PRON- be give by one of -PRON- friend of course 
no doubt -PRON- be not hard to distinguish a human voice from the bleat of one of these baigol wordboxe 
possibly the new motive power of the interplanetary have rebel and be flee this way 
no answer the professor excitedly do not think that shout come from gilhooly 
-PRON- be ah mr meigs 
at that instant archibald meig come bound into sight around the bend 
but -PRON- be not the wellgroome richly apparel mr meig of earth and the steel car 
-PRON- only garment be a kirtle 
-PRON- must have be surprise at see -PRON- but so great be -PRON- fear that -PRON- do not show -PRON- 
panic leave no room for any other emotion 
quinn 
munn 
save mesave -PRON- from the soldier 
a few dozen prodigious leap bring -PRON- tremble to -PRON- vicinity and -PRON- fall exhausted to -PRON- knee 
-PRON- -PRON- cry the professor 
what have happen mr meigs 
how be -PRON- that -PRON- find -PRON- in condition a wretched man wail meig grab the professor knee in the stress of -PRON- emotion 
-PRON- have get to save -PRON- professor quinn 
-PRON- be -PRON- who bring -PRON- to this awful planet and if i be slay -PRON- blood will be upon -PRON- head 
that be meig for -PRON- 
even in -PRON- dire extremity -PRON- do not forget to heap censure upon the head of -PRON- great savant 
-PRON- be not go to be slay say the professor confidently 
but these creature be as venomous as centipede murmur meig suffer -PRON- to be lift erect by the professor 
horror 
there -PRON- come now 
oh this be too much too much 
meig get behind the professor 
turn -PRON- eye toward the bend -PRON- see a detachment of the baigadd army just hurl -PRON- into sight 
-PRON- have make some acquaintance with military affair in baigol 
soldier as may be surmise be armed with zetbais but wordboxe be keep out of the rank 
only officer carry talk machine matter be order on the principle that private be to hear and obey 
each soldier wield two zetbaisone with each pair of handsthereby enormously increase -PRON- capacity for destruction 
the fighting force of baigol -PRON- have be inform although organize on a small scale be equip and maneuvre exactly as be the military arm of baigadd 
the detachment approach at a doublequick in pursuit of meig be as -PRON- afterward find a company of gaddbaizet or royal guard 
-PRON- number fifty wear yellow kirtle have the torso gild and be command by a single officer carry nothing but a wordbox 
the sight of the professor and -PRON- cause the gaddbaizet to come to an abrupt halt 
-PRON- have undoubtedly hear of -PRON- but -PRON- be far from expect to encounter -PRON- there at that time 
the officer be the first to recover -PRON- wit and approach the place where -PRON- be stand hold -PRON- talk machine over -PRON- head and punch -PRON- key vigorously 
-PRON- first word be a command to the soldier hold -PRON- zetbais and make no move against these fierce colossi until -PRON- get further order from -PRON- 
then to -PRON- behemoth 
whence come -PRON- and why be -PRON- protect the monster in the red kirtle 
meig -PRON- could easily be see be not on familiar term with the wordboxe 
so far as -PRON- be concern the captain word fall on deaf ear 
-PRON- be from baigol say the professor give an amiable twist to -PRON- word by a deft use of key and come on an errand from the king of that country 
this gentleman be a friend of ours friend screech the captain machine 
-PRON- be a thief and have steal a hundred djin of kaka from -PRON- sovereign storehouse 
i thrill an amused laugh on the seventh key of -PRON- own machine 
how do -PRON- know -PRON- be a thief 
i ask 
do -PRON- try the indexograph on -PRON- do the talk mr munn say the professor in -PRON- own tongue then add to the officer there must be some mistake captain 
this gentleman have a very good reputation and would not commit a theft such as -PRON- describe 
-PRON- bear the proof of -PRON- upon -PRON- person answer the captain 
-PRON- be the kirtle 
now a djin be a unit of measurement and correspond to the inch of -PRON- system from which -PRON- follow that meigs stand convict of steal about eight foot of red kakaenough to make kirtle for a score of the baigadd 
what be -PRON- harp about ask meig 
-PRON- say -PRON- be a thief mr meig say thief -PRON- bluster glare at the captain over the professor shoulder deny -PRON- sir i deny -PRON- 
-PRON- say -PRON- steal that kirtle -PRON- have on i continue man have a right to clothe -PRON- as well as -PRON- may answer meig aggrieve do not count that theft 
the country should see that a man be provide with a respectable covering 
this be too good an opportunity for the professor to let slip 
suffer -PRON- mind to drift back to -PRON- own planet sir say -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- opinion that -PRON- government owe every poor man a suit of clothe 
archibald meig cringe under the blow 
-PRON- be a thrust at -PRON- clothing trust and -PRON- find the weak point in -PRON- armor 
circumstance be different here -PRON- mumble 
in some way yes in other way no 
king gaddbai be the monopolist of this planet 
-PRON- control the kaka output and charge for -PRON- accordingly 
the captain of the royal guard be grow impatient 
if -PRON- be here on an errand from the king of baigol say -PRON- -PRON- shall be glad to escort -PRON- to the capitalbut not until -PRON- have surrender the giant who steal the king property 
take -PRON- to -PRON- majesty return the professor and -PRON- will explain everything in a satisfactory manner 
but this the captain would not do and -PRON- become so threatening that -PRON- retreat behind a barrier of bowlder 
display the banner mr munn say the professor and i hold up the royal standard so that the captain could not help but see -PRON- 
-PRON- one eye gleam insolently and -PRON- come as near swear as the seventh key of -PRON- wordbox would allow 
deliver up the thief -PRON- order or i will command -PRON- man to annihilate -PRON- with -PRON- zetbais 
-PRON- be certainly a critical situation 
i have already have a slight experience with the overpower property of zet and didnot care for further acquaintance with -PRON- 
meig be nothing to -PRON- 
-PRON- would have strip the coat from a poor man back if -PRON- could have have -PRON- way on earth and -PRON- afford -PRON- secret pleasure to see -PRON- hoist by -PRON- own petard 
the trust magnate do not fail to take note of the warlike movement of the soldier -PRON- do anything to save -PRON- professor -PRON- plead 
-PRON- shall not give -PRON- up answer quinn firmly 
can -PRON- think of any way mr munn whereby -PRON- can extricate -PRON- from this difficulty 
i have a quick mind if i do say -PRON- and a happy thought present -PRON- on the spur of the instant 
stooping i pick up a stone then raise -PRON- i let the missile fly straight at the captain 
-PRON- shoulderarm still hold the wordbox above -PRON- head and the stone smash against -PRON- and carry -PRON- away 
-PRON- be rather neatly do for the captain -PRON- be leave untouched 
bravo cry the professor 
-PRON- draw the fang of the enemy by that trick mr munn 
-PRON- have render the captain mute and -PRON- man can not act without order 
i have already figure this out in -PRON- mind and -PRON- be presently prove that i have not go far from the mark 
the captain recover the wordbox and attempt to use -PRON- but -PRON- mechanism be so disarranged that the order to attack become a confused jumble that seem to sound a retreat 
the whole company whirl and flee -PRON- leader follow and gesticulate wildly and helplessly with -PRON- arm 
meig be save for the present and -PRON- should have thank -PRON- for itbut -PRON- do not 
seat -PRON- on a bowlder -PRON- gaze pensively down at the red kirtle 
this be what i call the irony of fate say -PRON- in a morose tone 
and then on top of -PRON- all to be call a thief 
-PRON- lean -PRON- bare elbow on -PRON- knee and drop -PRON- face in -PRON- hand 
how do this happen mr meig ask the professor gently 
happen cry meig lift -PRON- head with a jerk and glare at quinn 
-PRON- would never have happen but for -PRON- 
have -PRON- see gilhooly go on the professor ignore the reproach 
poor gilhooly sigh meigs 
-PRON- have become a power in the traction interest of the country 
the last i see of -PRON- -PRON- be haul train throughout the kingdom 
-PRON- know that much already 
how about popham and markham 
alas groan meigs 
popham be work like a galleyslave in a coal mine and these little fiend be slowly starve -PRON- to death 
all markham do be to wander about the kingdom with a plate and a paddle beg food enough to keep body and soul together 
think of -PRON- 
and the great augustus popham owner of a control interest in all the great anthracite and bituminous field of earth delve in the mine of this planetno better than a miner 
coal field 
i exclaim 
what do -PRON- need of coal in these underground kingdom 
-PRON- use the coal in the kingdom of baijinkz and baigossh which be situate at the pole explain the professor 
during the long night in those country a certain degree of cold must prevail here quinn turn again to -PRON- what happen to -PRON- and the other two gentleman during the storm which separate -PRON- 
-PRON- manage to regain the car reply meig 
-PRON- could not get in of course because -PRON- have the key but -PRON- hang to the latticework at the window 
i be a little hazy as to what happen after that but i think the car must have be pick up by a terrific gust and throw to the bottom of that crater in the volcano 
ah murmur the professor look at -PRON- 
-PRON- remember mr munn i tell -PRON- i fear something of the kind would happen 
i nod 
proceed mr meig add the professor 
this be all intensely interesting 
be the car seriously damage havenot see the car resume meigs hiatus follow the blow away of the castle and when i open -PRON- eye again i be a prisoner in the hand of a legion of those oneeye creature 
for two week i be keep confinedan object of curiosity for the whole kingdom if i could judge from the way the little imp flock to stare at -PRON- 
after a time i be lead off to a place where i join popham and markham 
need i tell -PRON- how affect that meeting be 
popham shed tear and both markham and -PRON- be nearly unmanned 
-PRON- captor have some sort of a contrivance consist of a small shaft and cord 
one end of the cord be put to head and a slide fly up on the end of the shaft 
then markham be lead off give a plate and paddle and cast adrift 
popham be the next one to have the queer machine try on -PRON- 
when -PRON- be remove -PRON- turn come 
meig wring -PRON- hand despairingly 
after the storm -PRON- continue with an effort -PRON- costume be not as complete as i would have have -PRON- but those impudent creature denude -PRON- still further 
in selfdefense i be force to steal this red cloth and run for -PRON- life 
oh -PRON- be terrible 
woe be -PRON- that i should ever have live to see this day 
some good may come out of this unfortunate experience mr meig say the professor 
good almost shout meigs 
sir -PRON- express -PRON- strangely 
be -PRON- good to have a man use to such luxury as i have be flee through these rocky underground hill merely because -PRON- commit theft in order to retain -PRON- selfrespect 
have a care sir 
do not think for a moment that i be under any misapprehension as to the real cause of -PRON- sorry situation 
the king of this country be evidently a man of a humorous and practical turn observe professor quinn after a little thought 
the indexograph make -PRON- familiar with the natural bent of -PRON- three gentleman and -PRON- be seek to show -PRON- the error of -PRON- way 
on earth -PRON- be at one end of a trust here -PRON- be place at the other end 
really i think the experience will prove most wholesome 
archibald meig stare at the speaker with distend eye 
be -PRON- possible say -PRON- that -PRON- brain have be turn like nonsense 
i strike in 
the professor head be as clear as a bell get the right of this thing meigs 
the king of baigadd be make -PRON- take a little of the medicine -PRON- measure out in such large dose on the other planet 
-PRON- be both crazy snarl meig never strip a man to -PRON- hide and throw -PRON- out in the cold worlda the king of this country have do to -PRON- in a figurative sense 
-PRON- donot know how much evil -PRON- have do say quinn an expression on -PRON- face similar to the one i have see when -PRON- jerk the lever and shoot -PRON- into the unknown 
-PRON- have take -PRON- pound of flesh mr meig but be now under the heel of a monopoly -PRON- 
stuff cry meig 
-PRON- will talk no longer about a matter in which -PRON- display such poor judgment 
although i have tell -PRON- -PRON- story i have hear little of yours 
be i to conclude that -PRON- and munn purposely cut loose from -PRON- and -PRON- friend 
after bring -PRON- to this miserable planet do -PRON- have the heart willfully to abandon -PRON- 
not at all meig say the professor hastily 
i wonder if meig have forget all about the attempt -PRON- and -PRON- friend have make to abandon the professor and -PRON- 
-PRON- be one of the most inconsistent man i have ever encounter 
like -PRON- and the other mr meig continue the professor mr munn and i be take prisoner but -PRON- be not treat with the same barbarity as the rest of -PRON- burst out meig -PRON- small mind find even that a cause for temper 
-PRON- who engineer the plot and plunge -PRON- all into these terrific difficulty escape the consequence 
what be that banner 
-PRON- be under the protection of the ruler of the neighboring kingdom of baigol 
that be the royal standard 
ah say meig bitterly -PRON- be even receive at courtyou and a professed thiefwhile markham popham gilhooly and i be no more than outcast 
be there no such thing as justice even on this disgusting planet 
look at -PRON- 
look at -PRON- -PRON- final request for -PRON- to look at -PRON- be a frantic wail 
-PRON- yank savagely at -PRON- kirtle and twist -PRON- bare foot around in fearsome dejection 
-PRON- be look at -PRON- mr meig observe the professor quietly 
do -PRON- find any pleasure in the spectacle 
do not -PRON- situation arouse even a spark of pity 
i do not ask munn for -PRON- sympathy but -PRON- professor quinn although criminally careless in evolve plan and carry -PRON- out be a scientist and -PRON- must have a heart 
-PRON- heart be wring with -PRON- misfortune reply the professor gently but i realize that desperate disease require desperate remedy 
what disease be -PRON- refer to snapped meig suddenly change -PRON- tack and what remedy 
the disease that afflict -PRON- common country and which -PRON- would deny and ridicule be i even to name -PRON- 
the remedy too -PRON- would consider no remedy at all but a useless infliction of discomfort and mental anguish 
what -PRON- be undergo mr meig be not accidental but providential 
the working of fate be as marvelous as -PRON- be effective 
patience a little and -PRON- shall see what -PRON- shall see 
this be no time for oracular remark scowl meig 
these fourhande oneeyed demon be force gilhooly markham popham and -PRON- steadily toward destruction 
gilhooly daft as -PRON- be be pull -PRON- heart out on -PRON- ugly little transportation system markham be gallop from place to place pound -PRON- paddle against -PRON- dish and beg a few morsel of food popham be work like a galleyslave and -PRON- wage already insufficient to give -PRON- the necessary food -PRON- require for -PRON- heartbreake labor be be systematically cut down as for -PRON- the army of baigadd be at -PRON- heel 
baigadd and in -PRON- extreme discouragement meig give vent to a wild mirthless laugh 
baigadd and baigol 
-PRON- sound like expletive from -PRON- own good planet but altogether too mild to express the state of -PRON- feeling 
be calm adjure the professor with an apprehensive look at -PRON- 
calm echo meig brokenly shall be as mad as gilhooly if this keep up much long 
-PRON- start forward with a truculent air 
what be -PRON- go to do for -PRON- quinn -PRON- cry 
how be -PRON- go to get -PRON- out of this fix 
those infernal little soldier go away but -PRON- will come back again 
then what 
-PRON- be here in the role of ambassador answer the professor and munn an ambassador sneer meig draw away from -PRON- 
and as such -PRON- be entitle to some courtesy at the hand of king baigadd 
i feel quite sure that when the high authority understand -PRON- be -PRON- friend -PRON- will be lenient in -PRON- treatment of -PRON- 
that be rather a vague supposition on which to ground a man hope of life or death mutter meigs 
-PRON- be all -PRON- can fall back on mr meigs 
there be but six of -PRON- on this small planet and -PRON- must make the inhabitant -PRON- friend 
if -PRON- do not annihilation will overtake the lot of -PRON- 
-PRON- be fool ever to land on mercury in the first place pursue meig still wild and unreasoning 
-PRON- stamp with -PRON- bare foot to emphasize -PRON- anger and a sharp stone unexpectedly give point to -PRON- 
with a howl of pain -PRON- catch -PRON- foot in -PRON- hand 
i have never be call particularly hardhearte but somehow i take a measure of enjoyment out of all this 
however i have the grace to turn -PRON- head and conceal the smile 
-PRON- must be careful mr meig warn the professor 
sit down and rest -PRON- 
rest fume meig just as though such a thing be possible 
i be one of the miserable victim of -PRON- duplicity and if i could have recourse to the law of -PRON- planet for about an hour i would soon put -PRON- where -PRON- belong 
be sensible i strike in perhaps illadvisedly 
-PRON- act like a whip schoolboy meig hear nothing from -PRON- -PRON- cry glare at -PRON- 
as i be say mr meig proceed the professor mr munn and although -PRON- appear to be free be nevertheless virtual prisoner of the king of baigol 
-PRON- be be send to baigadd upon an important mission and on -PRON- success or failure depend very largely that will do interrupt the broker irritably donot care to hear an account of -PRON- experience quinn 
-PRON- be evident i think that -PRON- and munn have not be cross by the same adversity which have overtake -PRON- and the other 
i have a demand to make 
meig arise from the bowlder and strike an attitude which -PRON- intend to be both dignified and compelling 
with -PRON- unshaven face and red kirtle -PRON- succeed only in make -PRON- ludicrous 
what be the demand inquire quinn 
-PRON- and munn be fairly wellclothe reply meig and i demand that -PRON- share -PRON- distress to the extent of donate enough of -PRON- own clothing to make -PRON- presentable 
on the impulse of the moment the professor begin remove -PRON- coat 
when the garment be half off -PRON- change -PRON- mind and slip back into -PRON- again 
no -PRON- return 
-PRON- have make -PRON- own bed mr meig and i think -PRON- should lie in -PRON- until -PRON- experience a change of heart 
when -PRON- can truly say to mr munn and -PRON- that -PRON- realize how sadly mistaken -PRON- be on the other planet -PRON- will share -PRON- distressbut not till then 
out on -PRON- for a pair of heartless wretch exclaim the broker angrily 
-PRON- reasoning be false and i will never yield assent to -PRON- 
i wash -PRON- hand of both of -PRON- go through the if -PRON- path should cross in the future -PRON- be -PRON- desire that -PRON- pass as stranger 
-PRON- glare at -PRON- turn on -PRON- bare heel and make -PRON- way to the road 
then -PRON- stride off in the direction of the bend 
-PRON- watch -PRON- silently the professor with apprehension and i with unrestrained enjoyment 
as -PRON- be about to vanish from -PRON- sight -PRON- see -PRON- come to a startled halt gaze off along the road that lie beyond the bend then throw up -PRON- arm whirl and race back to -PRON- come -PRON- shout frantically the whole army be come 
be there no way -PRON- can save -PRON- gentleman 
think for mercys sake think 
meig be continually build barrier between -PRON- and the professor and -PRON- only to knock -PRON- down again whenever the slight danger threaten -PRON- 
have i be the one to decide -PRON- should then and there have be leave to shift for -PRON- 
have courage mr meig say professor quinn 
-PRON- be -PRON- hope that some high personage may be with the approach army in which event the royal banner give -PRON- by the king of baigol will be respect and prove the salvation of all three of -PRON- 
this great and good man be utterly incapable of harbor resentment against any one 
-PRON- beguile the plutocrat into -PRON- castle i grant -PRON- and shuffle -PRON- from the scene of -PRON- grievous labor yet this be not because -PRON- love the rich man less but the poor man more 
as i write these word piece -PRON- narrative together out of -PRON- commonplace book a wave of affection and reverence roll over -PRON- 
and often i steal forth o night when sky be propitious gaze at mercury through -PRON- telescope and can almost fancy -PRON- in communion with the gentle soul forever lose to -PRON- native planet 
but i anticipate 
the retreat gaddbaizet have reach headquarter and acquaint the high chief in command with the fact that two more colossi have appear so the major part of the king force have be order out 
by tactful maneuvre -PRON- be approach from all side 
a cordon be draw around usa cordon of soldier with -PRON- flash zetbais present 
one hostile move would have place the seal on -PRON- death warrant 
the high chief perhaps fear -PRON- wordbox may be wreck as -PRON- captain have be have evidently lay plan and give all order in advance of -PRON- attack on -PRON- position 
the assault be noiseless swift and sure 
when completely surround by the troop a number of the soldier disengage -PRON- from various point of the circle 
these soldier carry lance at least ten foot long 
the lance be hold high and to the point of each the upper edge of a net be make fast the low edge of the net trailing along the ground 
as the lanceman advance the net take the form of a rapidly contract circle the professor meig and -PRON- in the centre 
in less than five minute -PRON- three colossi be stoutly encompass by the net hurl together and throw in a helpless jumble 
the web be finely weave and of a material that defy -PRON- effort to break through -PRON- 
professor quinn make a fierce attempt to use -PRON- wordbox but -PRON- be hold so rigidly that -PRON- could not do so 
one by one -PRON- be disentangle the upper part of -PRON- body be wrap about in section of the net so that only -PRON- leg be free and -PRON- be force to proceed with -PRON- captor the army march on every side of -PRON- 
meig be loudly bewail -PRON- evil fortune 
take heart man cry quinn 
if i can see the king or get word to -PRON- i be sure that all will yet be well all day with -PRON- return meig with a groan and -PRON- can not make -PRON- believe otherwise 
there be no twilight in the neth kingdom 
day leap into night as swiftly as a curtain fall on a stage play 
long before -PRON- reach -PRON- destination -PRON- be in stygian blackness 
there be no artificial illuminant know to the creature of the underworld and -PRON- have no need of -PRON- 
-PRON- single eye be gift with power to see at night almost as keenly as in the daytime 
when -PRON- have travel several hour -PRON- be make to halt and a circle of zet similar to the one that have imprison quinn and -PRON- in baigol be rear around -PRON- 
thereupon -PRON- be free of the net and leave to -PRON- 
the instant -PRON- be able to make use of -PRON- hand the professor grab -PRON- wordbox and begin shoot question into the opaque gloom that hem -PRON- in 
why have -PRON- take -PRON- prisoner 
what harm have -PRON- ever do -PRON- 
-PRON- be under the protection of king golbai 
do not the captain of the other detachment so inform -PRON- 
answer come back -PRON- have be take prisoner because -PRON- resist the royal authority and try to protect a man who steal good from -PRON- regal master 
theft of good from -PRON- majestys storehouse be punishable with death 
even ambassador from king golbai be not above the law of -PRON- realm 
what be to be -PRON- fate 
zet be the laconic answer 
-PRON- will all three be slay by the executionergeneral as soon as may be after the great reflector send -PRON- first gleam of day through the kingdom 
that end the professor talk with -PRON- unseen enemy who presumably be the high chief of the force 
-PRON- be sufficiently discourage although i be reckless enough to ease -PRON- feeling with a few expletive on key 7the most insolent and defiant that i have learn in baigol 
mr munn mr munn cry quinn in rebuke 
this be no time to express -PRON- in that key be not endow with -PRON- magnificent forbearance professor say and i have to say something -PRON- all about anyway ask meig 
-PRON- be to die at sunrise meig i answer roughly or as soon after sunrise as the executionergeneral may find -PRON- convenient would have spare mr meig that information say the professor 
-PRON- ought to have time to prepare -PRON- i return 
as the night be far spend i be go to turn in and snatch forty wink against the time the reflector begin to work 
good night professor i add as i stretch out on the ground donot amount to much more than meig and will never be miss but i be sorry for -PRON- 
quinn grope for -PRON- hand 
life in -PRON- be a small thing say -PRON- no matter whether -PRON- be long or short 
-PRON- be what -PRON- do with life that count mr munn have no regret for what i have do with -PRON- i declare 
and i have not 
conscience do not accuse -PRON- in the least 
never have i take a penny from those who could not afford to lose -PRON- 
think again mr munn implore the professor would not have -PRON- face -PRON- doom in that mental attitude 
surely -PRON- sense be not blunt to the evil of -PRON- past life 
sir i answer imbue to the core with the sophistry that have make -PRON- what i be have be a financier in a small way 
not have the requisite capital for large operation i be compel to work in a small way 
-PRON- business however while -PRON- may not have be as legitimate be every whit as honest as that of meig and -PRON- associate 
if -PRON- man would stop that useless palaver call meig from somewhere in the dark and try to think of some way for make -PRON- escape -PRON- would be put in -PRON- time to well advantage 
never mind -PRON- professor say this be probably the last opportunity -PRON- shall ever have for an extended talk 
at such a time a man speak from the heart and i want -PRON- to know just where i stand 
just a moment mr munn 
the professor turn -PRON- head to answer meigs 
-PRON- be impossible for -PRON- to escape say -PRON- 
even if -PRON- could get away from here -PRON- should find the entire country in arm against -PRON- 
possibly -PRON- could get back to that other benighted kingdom from which -PRON- and the thief come accredit as ambassador return meig 
-PRON- be a hard journey from here mr meig and -PRON- should be overtaken and recapture before -PRON- could cross the border into a friendly country 
before -PRON- could take to flight however -PRON- should have to beat down the barrier of zet that hem -PRON- in 
that as i know from experience be out of the question 
meig begin to complain and to find fault and the professor turn from -PRON- and go on talk with -PRON- have bring these trouble upon -PRON- mr munn -PRON- continue a sad note in -PRON- voice and upon the other 
-PRON- seem impossible to accomplish any great good without cause some small amount of misery let -PRON- situation worry -PRON- i remark 
while constantly exercise -PRON- wit to secure the good fortune for -PRON- i have always make -PRON- a point to be prepare for the bad 
i shall face the zetbais in the morning without the quiver of an eyelid misunderstand -PRON- mr munn say the professor earnestly 
while i grieve that matter should have fall out in this fashion yet i would not undo the one thing which bring -PRON- into these troubled water 
in other word i would rather be here in njambai with death stare -PRON- in the face than back there on terra with meigs markham popham and gilhooly free to work out -PRON- nefarious plan the spirit 
i cry warmly the spirit that have put many a man in the penitentiary call meig who appear to be follow -PRON- conversation even if -PRON- be not take any part in -PRON- 
i turn with a stinging reply on -PRON- lip but the professor drop a hand on -PRON- arm and i hold -PRON- peace 
-PRON- be share together -PRON- last few hour say -PRON- and let -PRON- have no quarrelsome talk 
personally i have a good deal of charity for meigs 
-PRON- be a man who until very recently have be accustom to have score of people wait upon -PRON- slight nod 
here -PRON- have be subject to much indignity and at the hand of a people whom -PRON- believe to be -PRON- inferior 
naturally that render -PRON- disagreeable 
-PRON- may at least have the grace to leave -PRON- alone i answer 
not so mr munn 
-PRON- be perfectly right in badger -PRON- 
i be at fault so far as -PRON- and -PRON- associate be concerned and -PRON- know -PRON- 
i do not expect approbation at -PRON- hand but at the hand of those in faraway terra whom -PRON- drastic action have help 
-PRON- calm acceptance of -PRON- fate be so different from the attitude of meig that -PRON- touch -PRON- deeply 
-PRON- have the same cause to blame and abuse -PRON- and yet -PRON- let the opportunity pass 
-PRON- have be worth something professor i respond to stand at -PRON- side and to pass through these remarkable adventure shoulder to shoulder with -PRON- 
thank -PRON- for that -PRON- friend have no doubt i continue that if -PRON- and i be to be spare -PRON- may in time lead -PRON- to see what -PRON- be dispose to call the error of -PRON- way for -PRON- be a master hand at argue but as i be at present i feel that -PRON- chance in the next world be as good as any one 
the rich have take from the poor in a way that the law sanction and i have take from the rich in a way the law do not sanction and in a few rare instance have give to the poor nothing in that to oppress -PRON- conscience 
the only thing i be sorry for be that i enter -PRON- castle with -PRON- felonious intention centre upon -PRON- property 
now that i know -PRON- so well -PRON- plan to steal from -PRON- look more like a crime than anything else i have do 
munn -PRON- reply -PRON- grieve -PRON- to think that -PRON- career be to be cut short before -PRON- have have an opportunity to reform -PRON- sigh be no escape fate on -PRON- own planet or on this 
good night to -PRON- 
i be dogtire and go off into slumber the moment i close -PRON- eye 
about the last thing i hear be the peevish voice of meig resist what little comfort the professor try to offer -PRON- 
i be arouse by the professor

presently gilhooly come along with a loaded train 
-PRON- halt in front of the palace the passenger disembark and gilhooly bent over the car pick -PRON- up carefully and turn -PRON- the other way along the groove 
all aboard -PRON- cry and a minute later -PRON- be off and away

-PRON- couldnot be help professor i return 
-PRON- be a grand idea of yoursthat of abduct these trust magnate and place -PRON- where -PRON- could do no harm to the poor of -PRON- planet 
what though one mind have be wreck 
well that than the misery and enslavement of hundred of thousand 
mr munn say the professor with feel thank -PRON-

i be very very sorry that -PRON- be to be cut off so soon 
quinn be fortitude -PRON- -PRON- courage bear of a knowledge of duty well do 
i be prone to believe also that i -PRON- be not less firm although a less laudable cause lie back of -PRON- 
the square i should judge measure about two hundred foot on each side 
while the professor and i be engage in talk sightseer have be gather in the street keep carefully to the sidewalk boundary of the open space 
every eye be turn upon the professor and -PRON- and the sleep meigs 
the broker be snore dismally the sound rumble above the babble of the wordboxe and echo through the adjacent thoroughfare 
what have happen to the executionergeneral

-PRON- receive no less than two kano for every happy dispatch that -PRON- perform 
in this case -PRON- will be the rich by six kano so -PRON- will understand how anxious -PRON- be to have everything do as -PRON- should be 
a kano be the equivalent of a half cent of -PRON- own money so that -PRON- onetime millionaire mr archibald meig be to yield up -PRON- valuable life and help swell the income to the extent of a single copper 
have -PRON- be awake i should have explain the matter to -PRON- so that -PRON- may have still further expatiate upon the irony of fate

meig face the king and begin an angry outburst which the professor make haste to interrupt 
-PRON- majesty say quinn this needy gentleman be also a friend of our

then i will have -PRON- take back to the house say the king 
-PRON- give order to that end at once and the cart be lay hold of and draw out of the square and down the street olox accompany -PRON- have no idea the king drum on -PRON- wordbox that there be any people in the solar system with so much wealth and so little power with which to guard -PRON- get the other three kingdom of njambai pretty well under -PRON- thumb and the regent i leave behind to boss thing will have an easy time of -PRON- 
quite possibly i may conclude not to come back to njambai 
this other star have natural advantage which -PRON- do not seem to have here and may prove a more comfortable place in which to live 
professor quinn be shiver like a man with an ague 
-PRON- proceed to use -PRON- talkmachine and the word shake under -PRON- unsteady finger 
what -PRON- be think of -PRON- majesty run the professor word be only the wild of dream have have dream before and wild one the king wordbox rattle off complacently and i have make -PRON- come true 
-PRON- shall be the same with this 
i be a conqueror and i come of a line of conqueror 
there be million upon million of people on -PRON- planet persist the professor despairingly 
-PRON- could hurl these countless number against -PRON- faster than -PRON- could slay -PRON- with -PRON- zetbais 
key of the royal wordbox give a screech of contempt 
suppose -PRON- draw a line of zet the box add when the derision have die out imprison group of those countless number and then wipe -PRON- out by detachment 
how would that work 
the atmosphere of earth be different from that of mercury continue the professor 
-PRON- can not draw zet from the air of -PRON- planet 
thank for the hint reply the king 
-PRON- will take an ample supply with -PRON- and charge the atmosphere with -PRON- 
then -PRON- shall have a store at hand whenever the need develop 
while the king be use -PRON- wordbox with two of -PRON- hand -PRON- be rub the other two together with illconceale delight 
condition there be absolutely unknown to -PRON- -PRON- majesty persist the professor in a frantic endeavor to turn the king from -PRON- design 
-PRON- will be bring face to face at every turn with situation that will puzzle -PRON- and be fraught with danger 
all the nation of the earth will combine against -PRON- 
let -PRON- combine be the monarchs answer hope -PRON- will display sufficient strength to make the campaign exciting 
i will capture this earth of -PRON- and rule over -PRON- 
from one end of -PRON- to the other i will make -PRON- -PRON- 
i have long feel that njambai be too small for the proper exercise of -PRON- wide ability 
this be -PRON- world the professor thump angrily on -PRON- wordbox and -PRON- have no right to meddle with any other planet 
that cause the king to turn -PRON- keen eye on the professor and to keep -PRON- there for a full minute have the right to do whatever i see fit snap -PRON- talk machine 
there be no will in this kingdom but mine and no other will in the four kingdom if i choose to have -PRON- so 
but why be -PRON- say such thing on -PRON- wordbox 
after fire -PRON- with a kingly ambition to capture and annex a distant planet why do -PRON- proceed to throw discouragement in -PRON- way 
ha 
i wonder if -PRON- have be tell -PRON- the truth 
-PRON- majesty hum the professor talk machine with dignity be not in the habit of make misstatement find out whether -PRON- be or not come from the king 
this be an important matter and i shall take no man word for anything 
ho there and the wordbox be level at some of the retainer bring an indexograph varlet 
-PRON- will settle this question of veracity here and now 
some of the retainer scurry away and vanish inside the palace 
presently -PRON- reappear with the indexograph 
the professor be backward in face the teststrangely backward as i think for a man so clearminded and conscientious 
the test be not necessary -PRON- demur 
-PRON- action be far from be open and aboveboard remark the king 
-PRON- must submit 
the royal eye be on the machine as the professor be try out 
the ideograph tell of a truthful mind sadly perturb 
the royal wordbox chatter mirthfully 
-PRON- be afraid i can accomplish -PRON- purpose laugh -PRON- majesty 
-PRON- be worried about -PRON- planet 
such a state of mind merely enhance -PRON- determination for -PRON- if i mistake not be a clever man 
-PRON- would not feel worried if -PRON- do not believe i could accomplish what i have in mind 
but be at peace -PRON- dear sir 
-PRON- shall in nowise suffer 
i will make -PRON- ruler of one of the capture kingdom 
this be no lure for the professor 
-PRON- maintain an attitude of dignified silence watch the king with steady eye wise general go on -PRON- majesty always look over -PRON- ground as well as -PRON- may before go out to battle 
that will be advisable in the case of -PRON- present campaign 
what do -PRON- mean by that -PRON- majesty query the professor explain the king again -PRON- shall mount to the upper crust and make a reconnoissance of this orb i be to subjugate 
have -PRON- any astronomical instrument ask quinn 
none whatever reply the king 
have -PRON- 
there be an instrument in the steel car which will bring the planet terra much nearer to -PRON- than the naked eye could do 
what be -PRON- 
describe the instrument to -PRON- and i will have -PRON- bring out for -PRON- night work 
the professor describe the telescope and the king dispatch a messenger after olox in hot haste with supplementary order 
thereupon the king bid -PRON- farewell and leave the square follow by -PRON- suite 
as i stand watch the royal party out of sight i hear a gurgle groan behind -PRON- 
face about i see the professor reel unsteadily the next moment i have catch -PRON- in -PRON- arm and save -PRON- a fall 
a professor quinn do not become unconscious 
the frightful catastrophe that threaten terra have prey upon -PRON- at the expense of -PRON- strength 
ease -PRON- to the ground i drop beside -PRON- and hold -PRON- head on -PRON- knee 
cheer up professor say -PRON- surprise -PRON- to see -PRON- give way like this 
mr munn -PRON- return brokenly if this rattlebrained monarch go out into the universe with a pick company of fifty man and a hundred zetbais -PRON- will mean that the whole solar system will get a setback to a period correspond with -PRON- middle age 
these creature of njambai be far beneath those of terra in civilization and fate have place in -PRON- hand the terrible zetbai a weapon whose destructive power be beyond compute 
oh mr munn think of -PRON- government be overwhelm by these fourhande oneeyed creature 
think of the wordbox screech through the lofty corridor of the capitol at washington where the soulstirre eloquence of senator and representative have be thunder amain 
think of the the professor could give no add touch to the harrowing picture 
throw -PRON- hand to -PRON- face -PRON- groan aloud 
this hasnot happen yet say no but -PRON- will happen unless -PRON- can do something to circumvent the mad scheme 
anarchy will reign in -PRON- beloved landover the whole earthand i will be hold responsible 
ah -PRON- 
in remove the trust magnate i have but pave the way for a mightier monopolist 
i have but follow the sad example of frankenstein for out of -PRON- plan have spring a monstrous project that will check progress and hurl civilization back five hundred year give up hope say but not very cheerfully for i be greatly cast down 
let -PRON- pretend to help -PRON- 
-PRON- will lend -PRON- aid in make the car ready and then at the final moment perhaps -PRON- can dart away and leave -PRON- behind or fail in that -PRON- may be able to throw the zetbais from the car while in space 
that will pull the fang of the baigadd i think and -PRON- will land on earth as harmless as a lot of kitten 
the professor take heart at this 
-PRON- would have rally any way for -PRON- resourceful nature could not struggle long in the slough of despond 
archibald meig have be circle around the edge of -PRON- barrier seek for another glimpse of markham and even call -PRON- name with all -PRON- lung power 
but the foodtrust magnate neither answer nor show -PRON- be engage in a canvass for the pittance of provender that would keep -PRON- alive 
meig finally turn to -PRON- and demand the cause of the professor downcast air 
quinn reveal the king plot and meig tear off into an outburst of recrimination just as i expect -PRON- would do 
the professor bow -PRON- head meekly to the temp and even restrain -PRON- when i would have put a stop to the broker intemperate language 
by and by -PRON- have -PRON- noon meal and with the attendant who bring -PRON- come olox seat -PRON- on the ground and watch -PRON- as -PRON- eat 
the high chief be quite amiable and i begin ask -PRON- question relative to -PRON- surrounding 
-PRON- indicate the king private apartment in the palace and point out -PRON- own residence as well as the dwelling occupy by the late executionergeneral besides vouchsafe other information of interest 
what be that small square building under the wing of the palace 
i ask 
that be the imperial exchequer say -PRON- 
within that build the king keep the most priceless of all -PRON- treasure 
and what be that inquire the professor 
the bolla be the startling answer 
quinn and i exchange expressive glance 
here through a chance remark by olox -PRON- be suddenly remind of -PRON- duty to the king of baigol 
-PRON- be necessary that olox should not see the startled look which the professor and i be exchange and mercurial eye be preternaturally sharp 
bolla 
i allow to come limpingly from the talk instrument 
what may that be stone answer olox and there be suspicion in -PRON- manner in spite of -PRON- attempt to avert -PRON- 
-PRON- already know of the bolla 
-PRON- friend request -PRON- majesty to have -PRON- bring out and at that time -PRON- say that -PRON- have hear of -PRON- in the other kingdom 
so -PRON- do i reply trim -PRON- sail to another breeze but what be -PRON- 
-PRON- information be rather vague stone as i just say go on olox 
-PRON- have a beneficial moral and physical effect on whoever touch -PRON- 
where do -PRON- come from 
-PRON- have be in njambai for age be the indefinite answer 
how do king gaddbai get hold of -PRON- 
-PRON- borrow -PRON- from the king of baigol 
and yet -PRON- call -PRON- one of -PRON- treasure 
if -PRON- be borrow olox how could -PRON- possibly belong here 
king gaddbai have take -PRON- be the calm response 
what -PRON- want -PRON- make -PRON- own 
if king golbai have not loan the stone there would have be a war 
be that the right thing for -PRON- king to do inquire the professor 
whatever -PRON- sovereign do be right 
there be no get around a flat statement of that sort 
evidently the ruler of the country have drill -PRON- subject thoroughly 
what do -PRON- do at the car olox say the professor 
at the iron house 
the professor nod 
nod and gesture be well understand by the people of njambai for with four hand -PRON- be well equipped for finger and whole arm movement 
the king order be carry out at the iron house finish olox 
the paint be return to -PRON- proper place 
even so 
and the telescope that matter be attend to trust -PRON- handle the telescope with care 
-PRON- be exceedingly fragile and could be easily injure 
after the king speak as -PRON- do death by zet would be mete out to the one who injure the instrument 
there be several thing i want to ask olox and the principal one have to do with gilhooly and the way -PRON- have be take from the car and make to serve the traction interest of the kingdom 
however the professor be keep olox so busy with -PRON- wordbox that -PRON- own question be crowd out 
the family of the executionergeneral be anxious to have -PRON- return remark olox while the professor be look for the proper key on which to formulate -PRON- next question 
could that be accomplish 
-PRON- may reply the professor guardedly 
what have become of -PRON- 
-PRON- disappear as -PRON- be about to commit a deed of base injustice say the professor grimly 
-PRON- be aware of that and olox look uneasily around as -PRON- punch the word but -PRON- be ignorant of the cause of -PRON- disappearance 
-PRON- be a distant relative of mine and i promise -PRON- next of kin to put these question to -PRON- 
be -PRON- alive 
undoubtedly 
olox press closer and muffle -PRON- wordbox so that the sound could not carry to dangerous limit 
if -PRON- would tell -PRON- how to proceed in the matter of get the executionergeneral back -PRON- whisper can promise -PRON- and -PRON- friend help in get out of the country 
look out for the indexograph olox say if -PRON- should happen to give -PRON- a try out with -PRON- the ideograph wouldnot look well to the king 
olox be greatly shakenso shake in fact that -PRON- could not pursue the subject further will talk with -PRON- later about the executionergeneral -PRON- finish note the empty dish before the professor and meig and -PRON- and the curious manner of those who have come with -PRON- 
until then pray consider that nothing have be say on the subject 
with that -PRON- arise and beckon to -PRON- companion 
after olox have lead the attendant away with the empty food receptacle the professor and i get -PRON- head together on the mission that have bring -PRON- to baigadd 
-PRON- do not think -PRON- necessary or advisable to let meig know of -PRON- purpose in regain control of the bolla 
-PRON- be pledge to secure the mysterious stone if -PRON- can mr munn say quinn 
undoubtedly the work will put -PRON- in bad odor here and may interfere with -PRON- attempt to balk the king in -PRON- comprehensive scheme of conquest but that do not release -PRON- from the task in question 
a tingle of gratification shoot along -PRON- nerve 
the feeling of oppression that have burden -PRON- be lift for i ever love to crack a professional nut and here be one that would certainly try -PRON- to the utmost 
i survey the small building with critical eye 
here be where -PRON- inch get the well of -PRON- professor say for one of -PRON- size to get into that house be out of the question 
and i wouldnot know where to lay hand on the bolla if -PRON- be physically possible for -PRON- to effect an entrance can make a suggestion mr munn say quinn which would get -PRON- safely around that difficulty 
what be that 
whisper 
i incline -PRON- ear to -PRON- lip 
why not run away with the imperial exchequer 
eh 
i gasp 
steal -PRON- bodily i mean 
when -PRON- get to baigol with -PRON- let the king effect entrance secure -PRON- bolla and then -PRON- return the exchequer to -PRON- original location 
of course -PRON- would be very wrong to steal the king treasury and i would not counsel that under any consideration 
-PRON- merely borrow -PRON- to obtain the bolla the stone return to -PRON- rightful owner -PRON- return the exchequer 
and get zetbaie for -PRON- pain 
i exclaim 
let -PRON- hope say the professor that before -PRON- can get zetbaie -PRON- shall be in a position to use the car and escape from the planet 
i give much thought to the matter 
-PRON- be a long chance i return frankly but i have be take long chance ever since i become a cracksman 
i will put the plan in operation professor at the very first opportunity that present -PRON- 
thus -PRON- leave the matter the professor warmly congratulate -PRON- on -PRON- courage and express the hope that i would prove equally courageous in more worthy pursuit if the chance ever offer 
day slip along to -PRON- close and shortly after the reflector wink out the king come accompany by olox a guard of gaddbaizet and six attendant bear the telescope 
to -PRON- surprise and gratification both markham and popham be in the midst of the royal guard 
-PRON- strike -PRON- say the king graciously that -PRON- friend may also wish to view the orb from which -PRON- come 
-PRON- be a little thing and can be do without inconvenience so i be pleased to favor -PRON- 
the high chief trace an opening in the zet ring with the black tip of -PRON- weapon and meig be first to rush through and hurl -PRON- into the arm of popham 
the unfortunate gentleman be long in each other embrace 
when -PRON- finally draw apart meig grope through the black gloom by markham while the professor feel for the coal baron hand and give -PRON- a gentle and reassuring pressure 
professor quinn say popham be be badly treat 
the king have put -PRON- on the night shift in one of the royal coal mine and the soldier make -PRON- work like a galley slave 
this be the first night i have have off since -PRON- set -PRON- to work 
popham be loud in -PRON- complaining but be cut short by the king 
-PRON- must proceed gentleman 
i have word from above that the night be fine and everything propitious for an excellent view of -PRON- planet but storm come suddenly and -PRON- can never be sure of the weather on the outer crust 
-PRON- be well to make haste 
-PRON- start stumblingly each of -PRON- lead by a soldier to whom the way be plain 
-PRON- be jostle here and there through the gloom and finally be make to mount some object which give a metallic ring beneath -PRON- foot 
this be the royal lift explain the king 
when the heat of the day be suspend i often go above 
-PRON- then address -PRON- to olox 
give the signal at once 
the signal be give and -PRON- shoot aloft 
the transformation from the fury of a storm to the light and tranquillity of the underworld have be great and astounding but this second transformation be none the less impressive 
-PRON- emerge into a wonderful night set with star that be perfectly familiar to -PRON- 
the dipper and polaris be in the north and occupy relatively the same position that -PRON- do when view from little effect have the immensity of distance upon -PRON- post in the vault 
but -PRON- own globe 
-PRON- hang huge and tremulous in the blue of the evening sky so plain that -PRON- could almost note the continent that gem -PRON- surface 
meig give a whimper cry and -PRON- and markham and popham rush together fall upon each other neck and weep aloud 
oh i wish i be back i wish i be back moan the broker lonesome enough to die sobbed markham 
exile exile exile be all the coal baron could murmur in husky tone 
i will not say that i be proof against the sentiment that have unman the onetime magnate but i will declare that both quinn and -PRON- have -PRON- feeling under well control 
in silence i assist the professor to plant the telescope and -PRON- each gaze longingly at the greenish star magnify to many time -PRON- diameter the united state cry popham 
can -PRON- see new york whisper meig hoarsely 
look for new york man 
of course a view of new york be out of the question but the frantic explutocrat imagine -PRON- could see -PRON- and even look down into wall street for aught i know 
again be -PRON- emotion too much for -PRON- and -PRON- give way as -PRON- have do before 
mr munn say the professor this be harrow 
-PRON- be pretty hard on those gentleman i return to be bring face to face with something -PRON- think -PRON- own and yet not be able to possess -PRON- 
that remark be unlike -PRON- answer the professor and turn to the king think occur to -PRON- while -PRON- be come up on the lift -PRON- go on and i should like -PRON- to explain 
if -PRON- be in -PRON- power answer the king -PRON- eye to the telescope 
when -PRON- drop into the kingdom of baigol there be a storm on the surface of this planet 
that storm must have hide the sun and yet the reflector below be send day throughout the realm 
the reflection come from other and small reflector arrange to take care of just such an emergency explain the king 
storm be only local -PRON- know and when one gather over the giant reflector the small one at the other point be bring into use 
but let not talk of this planet but of that other one up here 
and along that line the king conversation run for a full hour 
at last when -PRON- be ready to descend so far from be dismay by the enormity of the task before -PRON- the royal zealot be fortify in -PRON- resolution to carry -PRON- out 
-PRON- majesty be in great good humor and when -PRON- have leave the lift and march back to the square -PRON- very graciously tender -PRON- the freedom of the town 
-PRON- could not understand why the professor and i should have any desire to escape from -PRON- country and inasmuch as -PRON- have make -PRON- -PRON- honor guest to return -PRON- to the circle of zet would be to besmirch -PRON- hospitality 
the zet have be regathere into the high chief zetbai and -PRON- be not again release 
-PRON- be not necessary for popham to return to the royal mine until the following night so -PRON- remain with -PRON- along with markham and -PRON- all bunk down in the centre of the plaza 
be there no way professor quinn quaver popham whereby -PRON- can escape from the inhuman monster who people this planet 
the treatment i have suffer be monstrous 
i feel as though i shall die if i have to go back to those royal coal mine again 
be a large man -PRON- expect -PRON- to do the work of a dozen mercurial 
there be blister on -PRON- hand and -PRON- foot be so sore i can hardly walk 
this wail from the brusque and tyrannical popham be in -PRON- a highly edifying comment on -PRON- sad experience 
-PRON- position be grace -PRON- compare with mine mourn markham 
these people seem determined to starve -PRON- to death 
i be expect to travel from house to house beg food and -PRON- hardly give -PRON- enough at one house to take -PRON- to the next 
-PRON- be on the surface return popham and -PRON- be not delve continually in the hot unhealthy region where i must do -PRON- work 
i have to toil like a galley slave for a cent a day and a cent worth of this vegetable food which seem to be all -PRON- have here do not furnish -PRON- with enough strength for -PRON- labor 
-PRON- have -PRON- clothe at least whimper meigs 
quinn ought to help -PRON- -PRON- must help -PRON- shall do what i can gentleman say the professor wearily have not succeed in show -PRON- the error of -PRON- way but i must let that pass 
a great calamity menace -PRON- planet than any -PRON- could possibly let loose upon -PRON- devoted country 
meig be say something about that speak up popham 
what be -PRON- this mad king think of do 
why with fifty warrior arm with zetbais -PRON- intend make an attack upon terra 
-PRON- hope to conquer -PRON- mother orb 
popham give a faint cry of derision 
why if that rascal ever land on -PRON- planet say -PRON- -PRON- and -PRON- warrior would be capture out of hand and turn over to some museum for exhibition purpose 
if happen to be around at the time of -PRON- capture -PRON- finish angrily would send every last one of -PRON- into mine that be mine make -PRON- toil with -PRON- four hand until -PRON- wear -PRON- off at the wrist 
gad but that would be a revenge worth have 
this be not a time to think of revenge mr popham speak up the professor more in sorrow than rebuke 
-PRON- have -PRON- planet to consider and next to the planet -PRON- 
-PRON- planet be big enough to take care of -PRON- aver markham 
leave that out of the question professor and confine -PRON- attention to some way in which -PRON- can better -PRON- condition 
the danger that threaten earth be great than -PRON- appear to imagine go on quinn 
for whatever happen to -PRON- homestar because of king gaddbai and -PRON- astounding plan of conquest i should be responsible 
the thought weigh upon -PRON- and will give -PRON- no rest 
the king must be foiled 
how do -PRON- intend to reach the earth ask markham 
by mean of -PRON- car 
be that in usable condition come joyously from popham 
so far as i can discover -PRON- lie intact at the bottom of the crater on whose rim -PRON- land 
there be no reason why the car can not be employ for a return to terra but and here the professor word become emphatic -PRON- shall not be so employ by king gaddbai and -PRON- army of conquest 
i shall prevent that at all hazard 
how come hoarsely from the three exmillionaire 
by destroy the car as a last resort and when other mean fail be the calm rejoinder 
-PRON- would not dare breathed popham 
-PRON- would not have the heart to take from -PRON- -PRON- sole mean of escape add markham 
madman grind out meigs 
if i really think that -PRON- would destroy -PRON- only mean of salvation -PRON- wouldnot do a thing meig i chime in 
whatever the professor think best to do be go to be do and no two way about -PRON- donot want to destroy the car continue the professor unmove by this storm -PRON- have arouse if other mean can be make to serve 
and i may say that -PRON- shall exhaust every effort to make other mean serve 
i feel that -PRON- be -PRON- duty to return -PRON- gentleman to the place from whence -PRON- be take 
i have not accomplish what i have hope to do but -PRON- be well to be disappoint in that rather than to let king gaddbai get away in the car with -PRON- fifty warrior 
certainly -PRON- be -PRON- duty to send -PRON- back say meig and -PRON- should consider that duty before anything and everything else 
exactly second popham and -PRON- must take gilhooly with -PRON- 
if one go all must go 
leave the matter to -PRON- gentleman counsel the professor quietly shall do everything possible 
the coal baron and the foodtrust magnate continue to dwell upon -PRON- harrowing experience with various degree of intensity until a command for silence come from a wordbox somewhere around -PRON- 
-PRON- raucous tone be keep the people awake all over the city the talk machine aver and unless -PRON- become instantly quiet the authority would take the matter in hand 
this threat have the desire result 
-PRON- give over -PRON- conversation and settle -PRON- for the night 
i do not know how long i sleep but -PRON- must have be some hour 
i be arouse to find -PRON- still dark and to behold the professor with a light match in one hand and -PRON- other hand over -PRON- lip 
the burn match throw a fitful glare around the open space and even reach to the roof top beyond 
both the palace and the imperial exchequer be bring shadowily forth out of the gloom 
now be the time mr munn whisper the professor 
the time 
i return sotto voce 
time for what 
without a word -PRON- point to the square building under the wing of the palace 
i understand 
-PRON- be now or never if i intend to make -PRON- raid and secure the bolla 
i start erect 
-PRON- have match mr munn the professor ask in the very faint of audible tone 
i nod 
-PRON- must be very careful to keep to the street until -PRON- reach the country the professor go on 
if -PRON- should make a misstep and wreck a block of house the disaster would be irretrievable will strike match and light -PRON- way until i get well into the hill say just what i should have suggest say -PRON- 
mr munn 
fail not to return with the exchequer as soon as the king of baigol have secure the bolla 
meantime i shall hope to get the car in readiness to speed -PRON- departure 
-PRON- strike hand as man will when confront by an issue of life and death 
then i step into the street bend over the imperial exchequer and wrench -PRON- from -PRON- foundation 
-PRON- be a wellconstructed building and although -PRON- content jingle like a rattle box when i take -PRON- under -PRON- arm -PRON- do not give way in any part 
strike a match on the roof of the exchequer i light -PRON- way down the street pick -PRON- step with care and caution 
good fortune fare forth with -PRON- from the royal city and remain steadfastly at -PRON- right hand as long as the match last but when the last one have flicker out and leave -PRON- in impenetrable gloom -PRON- trouble begin 
i be well into the rough country when the light fail thread a road border by hill that in some place be should high 
about the first thing i do be to blunder off the trail in try to regain -PRON- i stumble over a fivefoot mountain and go down all of a heap 
have i fall on the exchequer i should have smash -PRON- into a cocked hata result only narrowly avert 
regain -PRON- foot and smother some good strong language that rise instinctively to -PRON- lip i essay once more to find the baigol road 
i have -PRON- trouble for -PRON- pain and after an hour spend in fruitless blundering i sit down on a cliff prop up the exchequer on the side of a caon and nurse -PRON- barked shin until day begin flash from the reflector 
as i sit there wait for the light -PRON- brain be fill with evil thought which i recall with contrition and chronicle with regret 
i know the exchequer must contain the king wealthgolden piece of eight of a rare fineness unknown to the mint of terra 
i be not of a mind to return the gold after allow the king of baigol to take -PRON- bolla 
why not stow the treasure away about -PRON- clothe and rely upon -PRON- native tact and discretion to get -PRON- to the steel car in spite of the grasp monarch of baigadd 
i be much work up over the way i have lose the loot take from the plutocrat 
in -PRON- mind eye i could see those four bulge handkerchief wax and wane about the castle and i have hope -PRON- would fall to the surface of mercury along with the car so that i may still be able to secure -PRON- 
in this i be disappoint 
once the mercurial atmosphere be strike the loot and the revolver have fall away from the castle like so many piece of lead 
the wallet undoubtedly have be incinerate by the sun ray together with the banknote that be in -PRON- 
i imagine that the intense heat have explode the cartridge in the sixshooter and have warp and twist the firearm until -PRON- be no longer serviceable 
the other plunder also even if find could not by any possibility be utilize by -PRON- or any one else 
all this have make -PRON- savagely eager to recoup -PRON- finance 
and as i sit brood on the cliff i ask -PRON- why i should not do this at the expense of the baigadd exchequer 
i do not arouse -PRON- at the first reflect flash of day 
although i have decide to appropriate the content of coffer i be cast about for a suitable method that would gain -PRON- end with the least inconvenience 
a maudlin chuckle from near at hand bring -PRON- abruptly out of -PRON- reflection 
i turn and there on a neighboring elevation stand gilhooly balance the exchequer on the broad of -PRON- hand 
i be bring up staring 
what could the motive power of the interplanetary be do there at that time 
-PRON- absence must have interfere sadly with the train schedule 
certainly the officer of the system would not have countenance this neglect of duty have -PRON- know of -PRON- 
then -PRON- flash over -PRON- that gilhooly have run away 
-PRON- have tired of race up and down the groove with a string of toy car and have take french leave of the system 
the fire of insanity be still in -PRON- eye and -PRON- retreat step by step as i advance upon -PRON- 
look here gilhooly say i in -PRON- most persuasive tone that build -PRON- have in -PRON- hand be the imperial exchequer 
put -PRON- down there s a good fellow juggle with -PRON- in that way 
suppose -PRON- be to drop -PRON- 
gilhooly have begin shake -PRON- up and down as though -PRON- be one of those castiron bank in which child sometimes deposit -PRON- copper the jingle of the exchequer content appear to please -PRON- 
if -PRON- want this road -PRON- have get to bid up for -PRON- say -PRON- not so young that i donot know a good thing when get -PRON- in -PRON- grip 
that road have go into the hand of a receiver i return humor -PRON- fancy and the receiver 
give -PRON- here gilhooly be not consult when the receiver be appoint -PRON- answer have right in the matter and those right must be protect a deal frame up to beat the pool 
-PRON- how -PRON- rattle and -PRON- shake the exchequer again 
i be at -PRON- wit end 
i know that tact be far and away more effective than violence when deal with a craze person 
put -PRON- down for a moment gilhooly i wheedle and come over to the director meet 
who be the director -PRON- ask suspiciously 
well there be only two one -PRON- know and -PRON- be the other 
-PRON- explode a laugh toss the exchequer in the air like a strong man play with a cannon ball and then catch -PRON- deftly as -PRON- come down the boy to juggle with railroad -PRON- boast 
ask any one in the street and -PRON- will tell -PRON- 
look out 
i gasp or -PRON- will drop -PRON- 
not -PRON- mumble never yet wreck a railroad 
where do -PRON- come from gilhooly 
i ask seek to get -PRON- into conversation while i edge closer to -PRON- by degree 
from distant part -PRON- reply be the whole thing for a big transcontinental line that add to the gilhooly system 
-PRON- chuckle craftily 
-PRON- think -PRON- have -PRON- but i get out from under with the rolling stock hide the car in a gully and -PRON- next move will be to steal the right of way the big railroad man of the country 
just ask anybody who know what s what in transportation circle and -PRON- will tell -PRON- the same thing 
i have arrive within a few foot of -PRON- and suddenly i leap forward 
but -PRON- be wary and spring aside the exchequer jingle sharply 
no -PRON- donot say -PRON- try to serve a subpoena on -PRON- and too foxy for -PRON- 
get out of here or have -PRON- throw downstairs 
come over to the director meeting gilhooly i urge turn and walk away from -PRON- get to look after -PRON- interest -PRON- know 
but the vagary of a shatter mind be hard to deal with 
gilhooly laugh at -PRON- sit down on a rock and take the exchequer on -PRON- knee 
-PRON- be wary and never for an instant permit -PRON- to lose -PRON- eye 
-PRON- canot fool -PRON- -PRON- cry so -PRON- would better take the next train for home 
i hold a majority of the stock and after water -PRON- a little have enough to buy another line easy be a railroad magnate when -PRON- know how 
clear out -PRON- annoy -PRON- 
gilhooly say with a gentleness i be far from feel -PRON- want to know something about popham know -PRON- snarl gilhooly but if -PRON- s try to break into this railroad game just tell -PRON- that i control the whole bag of trick and that -PRON- not worth -PRON- while 
hug the exchequer in -PRON- arm -PRON- rock back and forth and begin to sing 
well say start away again if -PRON- donot want to attend this director meeting have to look after -PRON- -PRON- 
-PRON- make no reply but keep on hug the exchequer rock back and forth and time -PRON- monotonous croon to the rattle of treasure in the king strong room 
warily as i could i circle about creep on all four and screen -PRON- by the little hill and ridge 
-PRON- design be to come up on gilhooly from behind and snatch the exchequer away from -PRON- 
but -PRON- hear -PRON- 
before i have come within a dozen foot of -PRON- -PRON- stop -PRON- singing leap to -PRON- foot and whirl around 
the next moment -PRON- have place -PRON- at a safe distance too many for -PRON- -PRON- shout 
go away or call the police 
i be in a sweat for fear some of king soldier would locate -PRON- and develop -PRON- zetbais 
one flash of that violet fire would do the business for both gilhooly and -PRON- and the professor cherish plan would go by the board 
besides i have plan of -PRON- own and -PRON- seem as though gilhooly be destine to make a mess of everything 
oh come now i cry in a bit of a temper 
that wonot do -PRON- any good gilhooly 
-PRON- doesnot belong to -PRON- and -PRON- havenot any right to keep -PRON- -PRON- ever keep anything that donot belong to -PRON- -PRON- ask sarcastically not that sort of a fellow for i keep everything in the railroad line that i can get -PRON- hand on 
logic and reason be utterly dead in -PRON- mind 
whim -PRON- have but -PRON- be but fancy of the moment 
as i stand there look at -PRON- i wonder how the people of baigadd have ever manage to keep -PRON- haul -PRON- train as long as -PRON- have -PRON- call suddenly take the exchequer under -PRON- arm think go to the office and just then i make a dash at -PRON- 
with a mocking laugh -PRON- whirl about and race off across the hill -PRON- in hot pursuit course intersect the baigol highway and -PRON- turn into -PRON- roar defiantly as -PRON- speed along 
suddenly -PRON- stumble and fall and a cry of dismay escape -PRON- 
-PRON- have fall squarely on the exchequer and wreck -PRON- completely coin the size of a gold dollar and worth five time as muchrolle everywhere about the road diverge from a heap that lie reveal by the collapse wall of the building 
fling forward i go to -PRON- knee and begin plunge -PRON- hand into the pile 
i believe that just then i be as daft as gilhooly -PRON- 
in those day the glimmer of gold always have a demoralizing effect on -PRON- 
as i rake -PRON- outspread finger through the yellow pile i bring up a round jetblack stone the size of -PRON- fist 
i regard -PRON- as a bit of chaff in the bin of wealth and hurl -PRON- from -PRON- down the road 
with a loud yell gilhooly leap after -PRON- 
then i become aware of a weird and inexplicable feeling that lay -PRON- like an axe at the root of -PRON- professional instinct 
what right have i to all this treasure 
-PRON- belong to the king of baigall -PRON- be an unworthy creature perhaps but still -PRON- belong to -PRON- 
what have i be about to do 
-PRON- heart sicken and i spring up spurn the kyzick with -PRON- heel and turn -PRON- back 
that be -PRON- awakening 
in one instant the iron of repentance have pierce -PRON- soul 
the past roll -PRON- turgid water in front of -PRON- 
i shiver and draw back from that wave of evil cover -PRON- eye to blot -PRON- from -PRON- sight 
how should i atone for the day that have be 
could i do -PRON- by an unflinching rectitude in the day there be to be 
conscience be belabor -PRON- with tell blow 
i have not be on intimate term with -PRON- conscience for many year and to have -PRON- thus suddenly overmaster -PRON- and drive -PRON- into reformation be a mystery beyond -PRON- power to explain 
while i stand there consume with regret and hope against hope for the future a voice hail -PRON- from down the road 
do -PRON- say -PRON- name be munn 
could that calm contain voice have come from emmet gilhooly 
i look in -PRON- direction and find -PRON- lean against a jut spur of rock -PRON- right hand clutch convulsively the black stone i have fling from -PRON- 
the craze light have vanish from -PRON- eye 
an expression of wonder be on -PRON- face but -PRON- be a rational wonder develop by an awakening as abrupt and complete as -PRON- have be 
-PRON- have -PRON- right mr gilhooly i answer the extreme mildness of -PRON- voice surprise -PRON- 
-PRON- full name be jam peter munn and -PRON- be the thief who just come into the castle and relieve -PRON- and -PRON- friend of -PRON- valuable normal condition have come back to -PRON- at the point where -PRON- have be drop 
i be not slow in reason how this may be be a thief in the letter and spirit less than ten minute back i humbly answer but now sir i have turn a leaf 
i promise -PRON- that the rest of the book shall read better than what have go before 
gilhooly pass -PRON- left hand across -PRON- forehead be -PRON- falter 
in the kingdom of baigadd i return some distance out of the royal city 
baigadd 
royal city 
-PRON- talk strangely mr munn 
where be the castle 
where be meig markham and popham 
and professor quinn 
be start forward and look wildly in the castle 
but no that canot be 
-PRON- just say -PRON- be somewhere else 
i beg -PRON- pardon mr munn 
i be confused and hardly know what i be say 
i begin an explanation go patiently into every detail and when i finally finish gilhooly know as much about -PRON- situation as i do 
for some time gilhooly walk up and down the road pass and repasse the heap of gold 
at last -PRON- pause beside -PRON- 
-PRON- should return this treasure to -PRON- owner mr munn say -PRON- and -PRON- drop the black stone on the yellow pile 
from what -PRON- tell -PRON- this be a strange planet and strangely people 
yet there be superstition here as well as in -PRON- native orbas these wonder tale about the bolla will bear evidence think with -PRON- sir say the bolla be simply a fetish and -PRON- miraculous power be purely imaginary 
that be the sensible way to look at -PRON- 
suppose -PRON- load -PRON- pocket with the gold and start back with -PRON- to the city from whence -PRON- be take 
i assent and suggest use -PRON- coat as improvise bag for the easy transportation of the king wealth and -PRON- strip to -PRON- shirt sleeve and set about -PRON- work 
in half an hour -PRON- have collect all the scatter treasure have bind -PRON- up in -PRON- coat and have start back 
gilhooly preserve a pensive silence 
-PRON- thought be far away and -PRON- seem entirely oblivious of the fact that i be trudge along at -PRON- side 
-PRON- be only when -PRON- turn an angle in the road and come face to face with quinn meig markham and popham that gilhooly show any interest in -PRON- present situation 
the meeting between gilhooly and -PRON- brother exile be most affect 
in the general joy at find the exrailway magnate restore to reason the matter of the imperial exchequer be temporarily lose sight of 
and i think the man who rejoice most over return sanity be quinn 
the professor beady little eye be fairly glow as -PRON- catch and clung to hand after the other have express -PRON- pleasure and tender congratulation 
this be a glad day for -PRON- mr gilhooly exclaim the professor have take -PRON- very much to task on account of -PRON- clouded mind 
-PRON- reproach of -PRON- be well merit speak up meig who always have a venomous shaft in -PRON- quiver for quinn 
small thank to -PRON- that -PRON- friend be -PRON- again 
gently mr meigs gently come from gilhooly do not find professor quinn in the wrong in any particular 
popham meig and markham regard gilhooly with openmouthed amaze 
i think the professor also be startle i know at least that i be 
do -PRON- mean to say mr gilhooly cry meig that -PRON- can overlook criminal folly in cast -PRON- adrift in the unknown can not only overlook -PRON- be the quiet response but i can forgive -PRON- 
almost i be of the opinion that -PRON- be justifiable 
faugh rasp meigs 
-PRON- have not recover -PRON- reason after all or -PRON- would not talk that way 
let -PRON- not engage in useless dispute gentleman put in the professor 
there be another affair to engage -PRON- 
-PRON- be think quinn go on with an expressive look at -PRON- that mr gilhooly have flee the realm and take the imperial exchequer with -PRON- 
-PRON- be i who take the exchequer say and -PRON- be i who hope to return -PRON- to the king 
what about the bolla query quinn give -PRON- a sharp look 
-PRON- be here say touch the makeshift bundle i be carry under -PRON- arm 
at least i add there be a strange look black stone among the gold coin and i suppose -PRON- must be king palladium 
-PRON- be send forth to look for mr gilhooly and the steal treasure remark the professor 
olox and -PRON- gaddbaizet be likewise on the road but -PRON- have be able to leave -PRON- pretty well in the rear 
what be think of -PRON- absence 
i ask 
very little mr munn 
every officer of the state seem united in fix the blame upon mr gilhooly 
since -PRON- be know to be mentally unsound no crime could be attach to -PRON- act shall tell the truth of -PRON- i declare 
and be condemn to death by zet say the professor gaze at -PRON- fixedly 
let the king believe what -PRON- will say gilhooly should rather have -PRON- so since -PRON- mean so much to mr munn 
why do -PRON- not keep on to the other kingdom with the bolla inquire quinn of -PRON- 
because i didnot think i should be do the right thing i reply 
ah 
and why this sudden change in -PRON- sentiment mr munn canot explain -PRON- professor believe -PRON- be a theory of your that one thief have the right to take from another what do not belong to either of -PRON- 
two wrong do not make a right 
indeed 
the change in -PRON- sentiment be most suddenand remarkable 
will -PRON- please untie the sleeve of -PRON- coat and allow -PRON- to have a look at that black stone 
i lower -PRON- bundle and open -PRON- 
there say but poorly conceal the contempt i feel for the black stone as i point to -PRON- 
-PRON- may take stock in the superstition if -PRON- will professor but i will have none of -PRON- 
the professor give -PRON- a queer smile then pick up the bolla and survey -PRON- curiously 
would -PRON- like to look at -PRON- mr meig -PRON- ask fetish like this be a sure sign of barbarism observed meig take the stone 
the creature who inhabit this planet be not of a very high order mentally 
-PRON- pass the bolla to popham and popham hand -PRON- to markham 
-PRON- be presently return to -PRON- and i pack -PRON- away as before 
the professor then ask -PRON- for an account of what have happen during -PRON- flight toward baigol with the exchequer 
gilhooly be not able to help -PRON- much in the recital as the most important part of -PRON- adventure be a perfect blank to -PRON- 
i do not try to conceal anything from quinn 
i paint -PRON- design on the king money as black as -PRON- really be and -PRON- smile as -PRON- listen 
when do mr gilhooly lay hand on the bolla 
quinn ask 
how do -PRON- know that -PRON- do 
i return be very sure that -PRON- do be the quiet reply 
thereupon i tell the professor how i have throw the stone from the heap of gold and gilhooly have pick -PRON- up -PRON- reason return shortly afterward 
quinn wag -PRON- head sagely and mumble something i could not understand but which have to do with the ridiculous pretension of the bolla 
i fear then for the mind of this great and good man 
be -PRON- break under the tremendous responsibility incur by remove the plutocrat from earth 
a chill of apprehension shoot to -PRON- heart 
i be about to say something of a soothe nature to -PRON- patronfor i certainly look upon -PRON- as suchwhen olox and -PRON- gaddbaizet appear 
key seven of the high chief wordbox titillate with relief the instant the officer get -PRON- eye on gilhooly 
the exuberance fade into a note of foreboding and the foreboding into the word where be the king treasure house 
if that have not be recover calamity threaten -PRON- expedition to the planet terra 
the treasure house have be break and wreck reply the professor but -PRON- friend mr gilhooly and mr munn be return the gold to -PRON- majesty in -PRON- coat 
why should mr gilhooly steal the gold and then help to return -PRON- come incredulously from olox 
be -PRON- simply a vagary of -PRON- unbalanced mind be pleased to say chief olox that -PRON- mind be no longer unbalanced return the professor warn -PRON- to silence with a look as i be about to operate -PRON- talk machine 
mr gilhooly be now as sane as -PRON- or olox look worried declare say -PRON- donot know how the president and board of director of the interplanetary will regard this unexpected occurrence 
-PRON- should feel overjoyed at the unclouding of so bright a mind as mr but what if -PRON- interfere with the traffic of the road 
-PRON- have be run limited train on a schedule heretofore beyond -PRON- wild dream 
-PRON- majesty farm out the concession to the management of the road for ninetynine year on a cash basis 
if the traction power prove unavailable a demand will be make on the king for a return of the moneyand just now any depletion of the imperial coffer may prove fatal to the project expedition 
-PRON- be just as well that the exmagnate could not comprehend what be go on between the wordboxe 
the utilitarian view of the king as exemplify in case would have jar somewhat on -PRON- conceit and selfesteem 
i notice that a gleam of hope cross face when olox speak of a possible failure of the king plan of conquest through lack of the sinew of war 
but the hope die away almost instantly when quinn reflect as i do that the monarch be as unscrupulous as -PRON- be resourceful 
no further conversation be indulge in 
the royal troop execute an about face and return to the capital convoy -PRON- reunite party of alien 
as -PRON- draw up in the square the two glitter soldier appear in the turret and sound a call that draw the king to the balcony 
-PRON- majesty listen to the report of olox with a beam face but -PRON- smile flee when -PRON- learn how the traction interest of the realm be threaten by return sanity 
while this momentous question be still up for debate meig pluck at the professor sleeve 
tell the king professor say -PRON- -PRON- eye downcast that i see the error of -PRON- way and frankly acknowledge -PRON- 
if i be ever so fortunate as to get back to earth i shall be a reformer 
please ask the king when i can have -PRON- clothe 
and this be meigs 
have the heavens fall i could not have be more astounded 
tell -PRON- the same for -PRON- speak hannibal markham 
make -PRON- even strong if -PRON- will 
i have not be starve into should have withstand such a siege to the deathbut the change have be work here 
-PRON- strike a hand against -PRON- heart 
and ask -PRON- professor add markham plaintively to have -PRON- want supply immediately from the palace kitchen 
allow -PRON- to join -PRON- honorable friend in this free announcement of a change of heart chime in augustus popham 
look at -PRON- hand 
-PRON- hold -PRON- hand out to -PRON- and -PRON- find -PRON- calloused and scar canot go back to those mole burrow -PRON- supplement 
professor quinn show no sign of amazement 
after grasp the palm of each exmagnate -PRON- fairly electrify -PRON- wordbox with the supplication of the exile 
be these acknowledgment freely make and do -PRON- come from contrite heart say the king or do -PRON- merely cloak a desire to escape further privation at the expense of truth 
the professor indignantly repel the insinuation 
when -PRON- have finish -PRON- vigorous remark i step to the front and make a complete confession of -PRON- design on the bolla and the imperial exchequer 
quinn try to stop -PRON- but i would suffer no interference 
be -PRON- aware say the king gravely that lse maj felony and half a dozen other capital crime be mix up in -PRON- confession 
be i less courageous than an extrust magnate cry i warmly 
-PRON- confession free -PRON- from servitude and the inconvenience of hunger and lack of raiment respond the king yours condemn -PRON- to a blast of zet that will consume and dissipate -PRON- body as though -PRON- have never be 
professor quinn groan and turn away with one hand over -PRON- eye 
-PRON- affection reach out for the good man then as -PRON- have never do before 
bring on the indexograph olox command the king 
-PRON- will see how much of truth or falsehood -PRON- register in the case of these gentleman 
the indexograph be bring and test be make of all of -PRON- except the professor 
the ideograph must have register mightily in -PRON- favor for the king seem more than convince of -PRON- sincerity 
restore to the clothing trust man the apparel that be rightfully -PRON- order -PRON- majesty allow the gentleman who would monopolize food to partake of a sufficient supply to satisfy -PRON- hunger free the person who have be delve for -PRON- black block from further dutyand incidentally confiscate the fund pay into the royal treasury for -PRON- service as well as for the service of the traction powerfor mr sanity preclude -PRON- further use on the interplanetary 
be happy gentleman 
i feel that i must do some worthy deed to commemorate this the day that witness -PRON- departure for the subjugation of terra 
quinn be rent with conflicting emotion as be plainly apparent 
-PRON- be glad the explutocrat have fall into royal favor -PRON- be sorry to have -PRON- yet under that ban and -PRON- be greatly work up to learn that the king meditate such an early start on -PRON- interstellar campaign 
what of mr munn -PRON- highness -PRON- inquire 
oh yes return the king be forget -PRON- 
olox let -PRON- be decorate with the order of the open hand and see that -PRON- be induct on the morrow into the office of executionergeneral 
-PRON- need an executioner to fill the place of the late incumbent and i should have to look far before i find so conscientious a person as mr munn 
leave order with a subordinate olox 
neither -PRON- nor i will be here to attend the ceremony 
-PRON- royal will shall be convey to the regent 
and now add the king as -PRON- rise from -PRON- seat while the treasurer count the kyick and take care of the bolla olox -PRON- and i will proceed to the metal house guard by the gaddbaizet and accompany by -PRON- alien friend 
some preparation be necessary before a start for the car could be make and while these be go forward meig and markham be lead away to receive the attention -PRON- condition demand 
in an hour -PRON- be on the road 
meig and markham be in jubilant mood popham be optimistic but subdued gilhooly be silent and thoughtful and i be incline to look at the future with reckless indifference 
but professor quinn be bow under a grievous load 
if this madcap monarch carry out -PRON- scheme of conquest quinn feel that on -PRON- alone would rest the responsibility be make -PRON- plan mr munn -PRON- whisper hoarsely to -PRON- as -PRON- proceed on -PRON- journey to the car 
if the king expedition get away i shall have to accompany -PRON- and i shall take care that neither -PRON- nor -PRON- gaddbaizet ever reach -PRON- native planet 
but suppose -PRON- can outwit the king in some way i return and escape in the car leave -PRON- and -PRON- subject behind 
-PRON- and -PRON- other friend may go if -PRON- can possibly manage -PRON- say quinn but i have make up -PRON- mind to stay here 
i stop short and stare at -PRON- 
surely -PRON- canot mean that 
i exclaim do mean -PRON- -PRON- say firmly 
for the good of terra these creature of njambai must be watch 
-PRON- have only a surface knowledge of -PRON- and -PRON- resource 
what if -PRON- should bring forward other mean of span space besides -PRON- car -PRON- see the professor go on passionately that -PRON- misguided enthusiasm paint the wonder of earth in such glow color that king gaddbai will strain every effort to gratify -PRON- cupidity and lust for conquest 
i must remain here to combat -PRON- and hold -PRON- in check 
sir say i in trepidation think -PRON- take fright too easily 
once -PRON- leave njambai in the car -PRON- will be impossible for any of the baigadd to follow -PRON- 
-PRON- overestimate -PRON- possible resource 
whatever be possible can not be overestimate 
-PRON- may chance that i alone shall stand between this resolute monarch and the welfare and happiness of terra 
to desert -PRON- post would be cowardice 
do not seek to argue with -PRON- for i make up -PRON- mind to this last night 
the reckless indifference with which i have fare forth from the city give place to deep sorrow 
professor quinn observe this and continue do not exercise -PRON- over -PRON- fate mr munn 
i remove four rabid enemy of the people from -PRON- planet and i give back to -PRON- four eminent reformer 
-PRON- end have be accomplish beyond -PRON- fond dream if this be bring to pass 
and then too there be a work that i can do here even if -PRON- dire imagining prove unfounded 
i can after i know these mercurial better lead -PRON- perhaps to a high round in the ladder of civilization 
with the pattern of -PRON- earthly institution before -PRON- eye i can choose the good eliminate the evil and build a fabric here that will be a glory to whatever resource the orb may possess 
be -PRON- not a fair destiny for one who be laugh out of the astronomical society because -PRON- dare to have conviction as i do 
-PRON- be a destiny professor say which i intend to share with -PRON- 
-PRON- remain here and so do possibly -PRON- may become prime minister i will be executionergeneral 
between -PRON- -PRON- will have control of the situation 
that be not to be think of answer the professor hastily 
if -PRON- be possible for the exile to escape in the car -PRON- must accompany -PRON- as the one coolheade resourceful man capable of guide the car to -PRON- destination 
i shall instruct -PRON- carefully and fully 
and besides -PRON- add as i be about to demur -PRON- be a changed man mr munn 
there be work for -PRON- on the home planet for -PRON- native worth be to retrieve -PRON- on the very scene of -PRON- unworthy exploit 
i trust -PRON- follow -PRON- 
pardon -PRON- if i hurt -PRON- feeling by be too frank 
-PRON- have wittingly or unwittingly touch the vital chord which make -PRON- eager to regain the world i know and love 
to stand fair in the sight of man who have know -PRON- at -PRON- bad be now -PRON- one consume desire 
be this -PRON- wish professor quinn 
i ask huskily 
-PRON- be mr munn 
then i shall follow -PRON- instruction to the letter 
do so -PRON- say with one of -PRON- rare smile 
and if -PRON- dear desire compass fulfillment open this packet when -PRON- have leave njambai and be in the great void 
-PRON- will be -PRON- last word to -PRON- and -PRON- fellow voyager in space 
-PRON- hand a seal packet to -PRON- and i place -PRON- carefully in -PRON- breast pocket 
then a handclasp follow in which heart go out to heart as -PRON- rarely do between man and man 
look mr munn exclaim the professor release -PRON- palm 
-PRON- have reach the car 
-PRON- have come to a point in the underworld which the reflect ray of the sun reach but dimly 
there would have be semigloom but for an unreflected glow that fall upon -PRON- from above 
the car as have be bring out in the course of this narrative have be blow into the crater of a dead volcano 
this crater may be liken to a deep basin pierce with a huge hole at the bottom 
through the hole fall daylight from the outer shell bathe the car in a soft radiance 
the projectileshape house be stand upright and appear to have suffer no injury by -PRON- fall 
professor quinn have already explain to -PRON- how this may be possible 
the screen of the antigravity cube have be leave open by five decree 
the energy of the cube lighten the house to an extent that make -PRON- offer less than normal resistance to the temp and -PRON- also buoy -PRON- to withstand the shock of a tumble from the upper crust of the sphere 
how like an old friend that car look 
-PRON- heart labor at the mere sight of -PRON- 
-PRON- be to be -PRON- bridge through space if so -PRON- could contrive although -PRON- may easily fall out to prove a bridge for the king and the gaddbaizet to the earth undo 
after -PRON- have halt at the base of the car the king approach the professor 
-PRON- metal house be intact and uninjured say -PRON- majesty save for the door that give admittance to -PRON- 
-PRON- be necessary to burn out the lock with a draft of zet before the door could be open 
the telescope and the tub of white pigment have both be replace and -PRON- will i think find all -PRON- good and chattel intact 
how long before -PRON- can start 
let -PRON- first understand -PRON- arrangement -PRON- majesty the professor answer 
be -PRON- or olox to guide the car through space to -PRON- intend destination 
-PRON- be to do that 
neither i nor olox could manage the car i fear 
then i be to accompany -PRON- have so decide 
what of -PRON- friend 
-PRON- be to be leave here 
-PRON- need not worry about -PRON- however as -PRON- will be well care for 
i have already give proof of -PRON- interest in -PRON- 
before i can give -PRON- an answer as to when -PRON- will be well to start quinn remark after a little thought shall have to go into the car and make some calculation 
-PRON- will go in with -PRON- return the king should prefer to take only mr munn with -PRON- sir 
the king become suspicious and olox get the royal ear and say something in an undertone on -PRON- wordbox 
-PRON- and munn may go in the king say when olox have finish but -PRON- shall keep the rest of -PRON- friend with -PRON- while -PRON- be make -PRON- calculation 
very well 
the professor and i thereupon enter the car watch with some apprehension by meig and the rest 
possibly -PRON- fear that -PRON- be about to desert -PRON- if so the look the professor give -PRON- must have set -PRON- fear at rest 
a survey of the interior of the car show everything to be exactly as -PRON- have leave -PRON- 
the door at the top of the iron stairway have be force precisely as the other at the outside entrance have be but this be a matter of small importance 
the oxygen tank be intact and the professor show -PRON- how to manipulate the lever that regulate the supply necessary for the car there be still plenty of water of good quality in the reservoir and of food such as -PRON- be accustomed to there be an abundance 
everything appear to be in proper order and just as -PRON- should be 
-PRON- be very fortunate mr munn say quinn seat -PRON- on a box bring -PRON- in here with -PRON- less to have -PRON- help in examine the interior of the car than to seize an opportunity for give -PRON- a few direction which -PRON- will find of use 
when -PRON- leave earth -PRON- start at an hour which give -PRON- a course that angle sunward when -PRON- leave njambai however -PRON- must do so at an hour when this part of the planet be turn away from the sun and as far away as possible 
that will cause the car to be hurl toward the outer edge of the solar system and in the direction of the earth orbit wish i could inform -PRON- as to the exact position the earth will be in when -PRON- cross -PRON- orbit but the king mad project be spring so suddenly and -PRON- have act upon -PRON- plan so quickly that i have have no time for calculation in that respect 
-PRON- business however will be to overhaul the earth 
the telescope will inform -PRON- of the planet position and by properly regulate the screen of the cube -PRON- can hang in the orbit of terra until -PRON- reach -PRON- then once within -PRON- influence shut off the energy of the cube and suffer the car to fall to -PRON- surface 
do i make -PRON- plain 
entirely so professor i reply 
-PRON- understand the danger of landing 
all -PRON- can do be to experiment with the atmosphere while -PRON- be fall exactly as -PRON- do when land here 
on -PRON- quickness and discretion will depend the life of -PRON- and the other who will be with -PRON- 
-PRON- be a great responsibility sir say but -PRON- can depend upon -PRON- to do -PRON- utmost to avoid a disaster 
-PRON- press -PRON- hand to assure -PRON- of -PRON- confidence 
midnight tonight will be the hour to start 
the crater of the volcano will then be at -PRON- farth from the sun 
i shall so inform the king when -PRON- leave the car 
have -PRON- think of any plan whereby -PRON- may outwit -PRON- majesty 
i inquire have think of -PRON- 
prior to the moment of embarking i shall request -PRON- majesty to allow -PRON- and the rest of -PRON- friend to come aboard while i detain -PRON- and -PRON- follower outside for a few final instruction 
the king will suspect nothing for -PRON- will not imagine that i would allow -PRON- to escape and leave -PRON- behind shudder to think of that part of -PRON- i murmur 
will -PRON- not reconsider -PRON- determination professor 
no mr munn 
on that point i be adamant 
the instant -PRON- enter the car hurry aloft and set loose the oxygen 
i will drop this bit of rope near the door when -PRON- leave and -PRON- will have to make use of -PRON- to tie the door securely shut on the inside 
mind what i tell youdo not pull the lever until the door be securely closed will remember 
the car be exactly under the crater opening and -PRON- will have a clear path aloft 
therefore i would advise that -PRON- throw the lever to ninety the instant the door be fasten 
i nod think that be all 
-PRON- work be simple enough for in order to reach terra -PRON- have only to reduce or expand the energy of the antigravity cube 
-PRON- will now go below and rejoin the king 
just a few minute more professor i beg 
this may be -PRON- last opportunity for a private talk and there be something i wish to tell -PRON- 
-PRON- turn back from the top of the iron stairway 
go ahead mr munn say -PRON- 
all of -PRON- whom -PRON- bring to njambai i proceed be change man 
to -PRON- alone -PRON- owe this and i wish to go on record here and now for give -PRON- credit 
i see -PRON- past as i think i never should see -PRON- and i realize how i have waste a large part of -PRON- life 
i shall prove a worthy citizen if -PRON- succeed in get back to earth and -PRON- be -PRON- who have bring about -PRON- reformation 
a glow come to the professor face 
-PRON- hold up one hand protestingly 
-PRON- be the truth i insist 
-PRON- have argue with -PRON- constantly ever since -PRON- be throw together and -PRON- be while on the road to baigol that the truth of -PRON- argument suddenly come home to -PRON- 
i stretch out -PRON- hand but -PRON- hold back 
-PRON- be too shrewd a man mr munn say -PRON- kindly to be so deceived 
there have be time when -PRON- artlessness make -PRON- wonder but -PRON- have never arouse -PRON- wonder quite so much as -PRON- have now 
why be that 
i ask puzzle 
answer -PRON- this mr munn -PRON- go on 
how do -PRON- chance that mr gilhooly so suddenly recover -PRON- reason 
-PRON- lose -PRON- wit suddenly and craze people have be know to regain -PRON- sanity as quickly as -PRON- lose -PRON- 
-PRON- must have be so in case 
indeed -PRON- say smile 
and be -PRON- merely a coincidence that -PRON- find -PRON- conscience and gilhooly -PRON- reason at the same time 
merely a coincidence i reply 
-PRON- laugh and -PRON- be -PRON- first happy laugh since king gaddbai have announce -PRON- come campaign in the direction of terra 
let -PRON- go further -PRON- go on 
what cause markham popham and meig to change -PRON- point of view so miraculously 
be -PRON- the coal mine the lack of food and the need of decent clothing 
all that merely pave the way i aver 
-PRON- argument do the rest 
-PRON- be blind mr munn 
-PRON- be not the suffering -PRON- friend endure nor -PRON- argument 
then what be -PRON- 
i demand 
the bolla 
i recoil stare blankly at the kindly face before -PRON- let -PRON- part from -PRON- professor quinn i whisper hoarsely feel that i have leave behind a man of unsound mind 
if i think that i believe i should remain here with -PRON- at any cost 
unsound mind -PRON- return 
-PRON- dear munn 
-PRON- brain be never clear nor -PRON- reason more sound than at the present moment 
-PRON- find the bolla 
the moment -PRON- pick -PRON- up every unworthy thought vanish from -PRON- mind and -PRON- become morally the man -PRON- ought to be 
-PRON- do not understand the cause of -PRON- salvation and -PRON- hurl the stone from -PRON- 
gilhooly pick -PRON- up 
what happen then 
do -PRON- not recover -PRON- sense and a true outlook upon life at one and the same time 
yet as if this be not enough to prove a clear case for the bolla note the change in popham markham and meig when i ask -PRON- to examine the stone 
all this sir should prove -PRON- contention beyond all peradventure 
i be fill with wonder because -PRON- have go so far afield in try to explain what have occur 
the notion amazed and in a measure disappoint -PRON- 
a black stone have turn -PRON- from -PRON- evil coursea mere bit of insensate matter about which cluster the tradition and superstitious veneration of all njambian 
-PRON- regeneration have come from without and not from within and if there be no credit for the professor in -PRON- awakening then there be still less for -PRON- 
not the operation of -PRON- own mind urge and guide by the friendly counsel of the professor but a stone which i have pick up to cast away have work -PRON- transformation 
the fact still remain and would always remain but -PRON- be in no way flatter to -PRON- 
what be go on in -PRON- mind must have be divine by the professor for -PRON- step close and take the hand which -PRON- have a moment before refuse 
the method of fate be inexplicable to -PRON- mortal mr munn say -PRON- but what matter -PRON- how a thing be bring to pass so long as -PRON- really happen 
and why should -PRON- concern -PRON- with a failure to understand the underlying cause 
great be the bolla -PRON- friend even though -PRON- power pass -PRON- comprehension 
i shall make -PRON- a point to see that -PRON- be return to king golbai during -PRON- probation here 
to accomplish that and at the same time keep watchful eye on king gaddbai will not let time hang heavy on -PRON- hand 
and -PRON- will not reconsider -PRON- know what i be about to say press -PRON- hand restrainingly and get up from -PRON- seat 
presently -PRON- remove a few foot of rope from a bale and take a last long look around -PRON- 
what -PRON- thought be i will not even hazard a guess 
cut loose from every tie that hold -PRON- to earth i know very well what -PRON- feeling would have be under the circumstance 
but i have already state that the professor be queer in -PRON- outlook upon life and in -PRON- grasp of way and mean so -PRON- pen hesitate to attempt a description of -PRON- emotion at this critical moment 
when -PRON- emerge from the steel shell the king and -PRON- retainer crowd close to hear what -PRON- companion have to say 
-PRON- majesty be greatly disappointed on learn that the start be not to be make until some hour have pass but -PRON- smother -PRON- impatience and busy -PRON- with a communication to the regent give the exact hour the expedition intend to take -PRON- departure 
the historian choose to accompany the monarch and put into imperishable ideograph the history -PRON- be to make transcribe the king message and -PRON- be dispatch by courier to the capital 
follow this business -PRON- majesty entertain -PRON- with a review of the gaddbaizet select by olox for the expedition 
the diminutive soldier be welldrille wellequippe and present a dazzling spectacle in -PRON- gilt war paint and yellow kirtle 
-PRON- be truly the flower of the country 
each carry a pair of zetbais fill to the white tip with a special supply of zet 
quinn now that -PRON- mind be make up to defeat the king and to remain on njambia display much interest in the maneuvre even go so far as to applaud -PRON- 
store of prepared food have be collect in bale which be pile in a heap beside the car ready for loading 
one bale be open toward the close of day and -PRON- use -PRON- content for -PRON- supper ration 
night fall and the professor ask -PRON- to enter the car and light the lamp on the table 
i do so and in the glow that come through the car window -PRON- who be not gift with the owlsight of the njambaian be able to see a little of what go on around -PRON- 
as the night advance and king gaddbai evince -PRON- impatience and excitement by walk back and forth in front of -PRON- pick guard strain of the national anthem be bear to -PRON- from a distance 
louder and louder swell the tone of the wordboxe and at last the regent arrive accompany by a host from the town 
-PRON- be there to give -PRON- monarch a rousing sendoff and i smile a little as i think of the disappointment that be likely to overtake -PRON- 
while felicitation be be exchange between the king and -PRON- people professor quinn ask -PRON- to consult -PRON- watch 
i find that -PRON- be within fifteen minute of midnight 
-PRON- timepiece be not strictly accurate inasmuch as in the exciting event of the morning i have neglect -PRON- usual custom of set the hand three minute back 
however the indicate time be close enough for all practical purpose 
into the car with -PRON- mr munn say the professor as calmly as though -PRON- command be not go to separate -PRON- from -PRON- kind for all eternity 
i would have take -PRON- hand have -PRON- not observe the movement and say quickly 
be careful 
-PRON- must not let these people suspect by a word or gesture the sort of coup -PRON- be plan 
take the other with will speak to the king and cover -PRON- movement as i have already outline 
those be professor last word to -PRON- 
-PRON- final glimpse of -PRON- show -PRON- -PRON- resolute face and slender form drift away into the gloom in the direction of king gaddbai 
i feel as though i must run after -PRON- and drag -PRON- into the car whether -PRON- would or no 
how i succeed in fight down the mad impulse have ever since be a mystery to -PRON- but i do and a word to popham meigs markham and gilhooly who have already be inform that -PRON- be to expect a startling dnouement bring -PRON- after -PRON- into the steel structure 
i hear olox give a loud command for -PRON- to turn back but -PRON- wordbox be suddenly quiet and i presume that the professor have already go far enough with -PRON- part of the ruse to lull any suspicion that have arise 
rope that steel door on the inside gilhooly 
i cry as i bound up the iron stair 
gilhooly do not know what have be plan but leap instantly to the task 
with a quick pull of the lever i open the oxygen tank and dash below once more 
something have go wrong do not know what and do not know to this day 
the mysterious violet fire which accompany a discharge of the zetbais be roll all around the steel wall that hem -PRON- in and a perfect tumult of shriek and cry come frantically to -PRON- car 
violent hand be lay on the door push -PRON- inward against the rope make fast by gilhooly 
gilhooly and the other hurl -PRON- at the portal and fling -PRON- back hold -PRON- so by main strength be kill shout meig 
no i yell and jump to the switch board 
the next instant the switch be throw and the billow of fire fade from the car window as if by magic 
-PRON- be save 
again have -PRON- plunge into space and behind uslive or dead i know notwe have leave professor quinn 
sink down on -PRON- knee i bury -PRON- face in -PRON- hand 
i have hear some one say that life be only a dream and that when -PRON- awaken in the other country -PRON- shall find -PRON- so 
far be -PRON- from -PRON- to dispute this or affirm -PRON- yet i know of -PRON- own experience that -PRON- wake moment furnish event that seem as illusory as the stuff that dream be make of 
of all -PRON- strange adventure the flight from njambai have be the one that i recall with most vividness and at the same time as seem the most unreal 
the tension of -PRON- nerve at the moment may account for this 
as i state somewhere close to the beginning of this narrative what i set out to write be a description of the planet mercury in so far as -PRON- limited ability for observation enable -PRON- to gather knowledge 
in look back over -PRON- manuscript i find i have make -PRON- more of an adventurous tale than i intend 
now when near the close i can hold more closely to -PRON- text and deal only generally with -PRON- return trip to terra 
-PRON- be needless to dwell upon the way -PRON- miss and mourn the professor 
at every turn some want develop which -PRON- could easily have satisfy have -PRON- be with -PRON- 
however -PRON- wisdom have start -PRON- correctly and -PRON- have perforce to make shift and get along without -PRON- as best -PRON- could 
as captain of the car the weight of a great responsibility rest on -PRON- 
i be almost constantly at the telescope and i keep whom i have the most confidenceabout as constantly at the switch board 
-PRON- be menace by frequent danger during the trip -PRON- course be literally strew with meteoroid which -PRON- require much deft maneuvring to evade but -PRON- come safely out of these peril and as if to compensate -PRON- for -PRON- -PRON- form a most happy juncture with the orbit at a time when that planet be approach and nearly upon -PRON- 
with gilhooly at the lever and -PRON- at the telescope -PRON- accomplish a very successful landing 
so evenly balance do the car hang between the cube and the draw power of gravity that the last thousand foot of -PRON- descent be merely a float earthward and -PRON- alight with so slight a shock that none of -PRON- experience a particle of inconvenience 
the land that claim -PRON- be a deserted island in where -PRON- remain for two week live off -PRON- food supply and keep a sharp lookout for a sail 
-PRON- have not be more than a day on the island before i remember the document professor quinn have give -PRON- 
i have be direct to open -PRON- while on -PRON- way through the great void but i have be so burden with responsibility during that time that i have not once think of the packet 
with -PRON- four companion as auditor i read aloud one of the paper inclose in the packet which be address to all of -PRON- jointly 
when -PRON- read this i trust that the plan of -PRON- and mr munn will have prove so far successful that an impassable gulf will stretch between -PRON- and the undersignedand i write this out of a desire to have -PRON- speed on -PRON- return to -PRON- native planet not because i would willingly separate -PRON- from -PRON- be circumstance here different from what -PRON- have find -PRON- 
as long as i live i shall stand between king gaddbai and any monstrous plan -PRON- may form and attempt to carry out look to the subjugating of the world -PRON- know and love so well 
i be convince that the king have resource of which -PRON- know nothing and -PRON- shall be -PRON- aim to fathom the resource of njambai and assist in -PRON- development along other and more peaceable line 
this be to be -PRON- work and i enter upon -PRON- with a tranquil soul 
no doubt i take what -PRON- gentleman may think be an unwarranted liberty in lure four of -PRON- number to -PRON- castle and cast -PRON- adrift in the unknown 
as for -PRON- i believe i have ample warrant for do what i do i will not dwell on that motive as -PRON- be already familiar to -PRON- 
the experience each of -PRON- have have on njambai have be most salutary 
-PRON- have undergo a change of heart and reform have work -PRON- great work 
have i not be assure of this none of -PRON- would ever have leave this sphere for that other one which have be the cradle of -PRON- pet scheme in speculation 
-PRON- be not the same man -PRON- be 
as reformer -PRON- will do -PRON- share to preserve -PRON- noble country from dire calamity that threaten -PRON- 
that be -PRON- mission and see to -PRON- that -PRON- fail not in -PRON- performance 
-PRON- be -PRON- prayerful hope that -PRON- will reach -PRON- destination in safety and with mr munn at the helm i be prone to think that this result will be achieve 
if a civilized country claim -PRON- immediately upon land -PRON- be -PRON- wish that -PRON- give full power to the antigravity cube and send the car into space -PRON- be -PRON- wish that none of -PRON- give a record of -PRON- experience to the paper either wholly or in part until five year have pass and then that this duty devolve upon mr munn and -PRON- be -PRON- final wish that mr munn accept the enclose deed to -PRON- harlem lot and the enclose check make payable to -PRON- all the fund i have in bank 
i would have -PRON- return to the other four of -PRON- an equivalent for the fund and valuable steal the night -PRON- leave earth in the car 
-PRON- second wish as to the revelation -PRON- gentleman could make be bear of a desire to save the earth dweller any unnecessary fear on the score of king gaddbai and -PRON- undertakings 
if -PRON- have not invade terra with -PRON- terrifying zetbais by the time five year have elapse -PRON- be -PRON- conviction that the danger will be do away with forever 
gentleman adieu 
as -PRON- read this i give -PRON- hail from njambai 
a fortnight after the reading of the above document -PRON- sight a sail on the horizon and by mean of a rope reach from the switch board through a window the lever be pull and professor castle shoot into the cloud and vanish for all time 
three hour later -PRON- be pick up by a whale boat convey to the tramp steamer mollie and in a month sail through the golden gate into san francisco harbor 
the five year have pass and i have set -PRON- hand to the foregoing 
gilhooly and meig have cross to the great majority but the strenuous work -PRON- do in the interest of the people be an imperishable monument to -PRON- memory 
popham and markham be still labor for the good of the cause 
the return to home and friend of these four long give up for dead cause a sensation throughout the country 
true to the express wish of professor quinn none of -PRON- have breathe a whisper of the marvelous thing -PRON- see or of the weird experience that fall to -PRON- lot while journey to and from njambai and while sojourn upon that planet 
so far as i be concern -PRON- life since -PRON- return to earth have be as spotless as a thorough reformation could make -PRON- 
as far as i could i have reimburse those from whom i take what be not rightfully -PRON- i have plead the cause of the poor man and help -PRON- liberally out of the generous fortune bestow upon -PRON- by professor quinn and i intend to pursue this line of action until the last day of -PRON- life 
could a reform burglar have a more suitable occupation
