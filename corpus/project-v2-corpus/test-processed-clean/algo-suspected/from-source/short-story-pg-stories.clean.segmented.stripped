importance of literary style were it not for the clever literary style employed in the writing of a great many shortshort stories which have been accepted and published they would have qualified as ordinary shortstories only
what is meant by this is that great many clever writers have taken what would otherwise have been an ordinary shortstory and by either purposely misleading the reader with dialogue which has a double meaning or by withholding important facts until the last paragraph they have made it into a shortshort story
in other words they have given it what we call the trick ending which is a big dramatic punch or surprise to the reader
in some of the shortshort stories which have been accepted and published the reader is even left in a quandary and is required to supply his own interpretation at the end
in others he is left in a serious and reflective mood with a wealth of food for thought
in practically all of them which are written according to formula there is a surprise in the last paragraph
the majority of those which have been accepted and published are literary gems or have distinctive features about them which lift them out of the ordinary
i will enumerate a few of these features in order to make myself clear
they are in which the dialogue is so clever that it elicits a chuckle or an outright laugh
for example the last two paragraphs in the killer a story written by arthur munion and published in september a thumbnail synopsis of which is number16 on page the closing paragraphs are as follows where he wanted to know did you get that wallop
that
oh that
armstrong assumed a worried look temper he whispered
beastly thing baskerville
ugh
i see red
forget human
growl like a wolf
likely as not to tear a man to ribbons when what going baskerville
well any other time you know
in which the dialogue is so cleverly written that it portrays a character so clearly that one can almost feel he has known the person
for example in the story pearls written by philip wylie and published in october 5m the following paragraphs appear mr bland eyes became more lifeless and opaque
he said quite
throckmorton of taine stared at the ceiling thought with three months you could er assemble something decent
about er say eighty thousand pounds what
mr bradleys fingers lifter and fell
quite he repeated
the thumbnail synopsis of this story is number and appears on page in which the description is so wellworded that one is immediately transported into the atmosphere of the story as in the case of helping hand by morton thompson which appeared in the october issue of and the thumbnail synopsis of which is number on page of this index
this is exemplified by the following paragraph here was her freedom in the magic city
and she had no hob
no money no friends no earthly chance of earning any
a chill must blew in from the battery
thin soupy rain followed
the author of this story also reserved a terrific dramatic punch for the very last line wherein he tells us that what was found crumpled in the hand of the suicide victim was the fivedollar bill that he had given her and that it was a counterfeit thereby leaving great latitude for speculation
in which the story gets under way so speedily that the interest of the reader is immediately seized in an iron grip with the result that it is impossible to lay down the magazine without reading the story through
an example of this will be found in taken for a ride thumbnail synopsis number on page of index and of which the following paragraphs are an illustration
jennings was being taken for a ride
a man sat beside him on the front seat of his car with a gun pressed against his ribs
the gun was in the mans pocket and was held in his left hand
jennings didnot feel that he had ever done any harm to anybody
true he as a bootlegger but he was only a little one and tried not to sell any poison stuff
this story was written by william ford and this clever author not only gets his story under way at the top speed in the first two paragraphs but introduces his main characters in that space also
in which the action of the character is so cleverly described that he is made to live and breathe and to be so human that the illusion of knowing him is perfect
as in the story one strong thing from the june issue of written by carrie tibbets thumbnail synopsis number on page 109of index the following paragraphs illustrates ruth stood for a moment looking down at her husband
he looked at her with the eyes of a beaten dog and the grin of a satyr
she dropped quietly to her knees and began unlacing his shoes
there is also a pathetic punch in this paragraph as it describes the actions of a wife who has decided to desert her husband because of his drinking and how her love triumphs over the decision when he comes in a drunk again
wherein in just a few words an author tells a whole story so cleverly that the reader sees in retrospect perhaps what has required years to develop in the life of a character
an example of this is contained in the story entitle have said goodbye by philip duganne in the july issue of thumbnail synopsis number on page of index
i refer to the following paragraph
emmy was a coward
thirteen years in the state orphanage before old caleb ryder took her out to do the housework which his wife could not attend to from her grave and five years of bullying were not the stuff to make courage
this story also contains a number of other very clever paragraphs descriptive of action and atmosphere
we can see the characters in the story move about as if in real life or on the talking picture screen as we read the following paragraph from the same story
they searched until sundown the house the barn the ground
the sear leaves of the cornstalks rustled ominously as men moved among them and the drunken scarecrows witnesses if there had been a crime to the scene flapped their strawstuffed sleeves in the wind as though they shook with dreadful laughter
in which the author has very cleverly described in just a few words at the end of his story retrospective action or events which explain everything and leave the reader aghast
an illustration of this is contained in the story the perfect murder
thumbnail synopsis number on page written by roy mangum and published in of april following is a paragraph but then willowville folks donot known to this day that emily holden was mark daughter that mark had never been married and that old man fellows was the only human being on earth who knew those things
in which the author has converted into a shortshort story what would have been an ordinary shortstory by opening up his action at the most interesting point of the narrative and then five or six paragraphs later describing in retrospect previous events which would have been uninteresting reading
this was aptly illustrated in love em and written by john franklin fellows and published in on august 15th
thumbnail synopsis number page index
his opening paragraph which immediately seizes interest was as follows it was not until the brig west away had been at sea three days that spud martin got his chance to kill jack wilton
but all the breaks were with him now spud thought grimly even the fact that jack and he had been watch mates for six years
the retrospect which would have been a very uninteresting opening is contained in the following paragraph which appeared a little more than half way down the first column
for six years spud martin and jack wilton had been watch mates
for six years they had spent their hours ashore in the same haunts and for six years they had shared their confidences and ideas
and spud with the admiration which the more homely and cautious of two intimates always show for the other had studied jack until he knew him better than he did himself
that was why spud knew what attitude toward elsie saunders must be even though jack had become taciturn and avoided looking spud in the eye
all the way through these shortshort stories one finds beautifully written lines which aptly describes atmosphere action and character
the following are a few examples the old woman looked like a piece of crumpled brown wax lying there against a high ruffled pillow
the doctor picked up the scalpel
he nodded to the curlyhaired nurse
she placed the cone back on face
drip
drip
dip
but she didnot hear what he was saying for intuitively she placed that tone
it struck the cunning note of the conversationally intimate
gingerly he seated himself upon the straight chair beside the desk and even as he did so the smiling mask dropped from face
the dismal spectre bowed again settled himself wearily upon the cushions and placed the tin box between us
how could i know
what does any woman know about the man she marries
she begins with faith she continues with hope and unless she divorces him she stays by him through charity
philosophy well put
some successful shortshort stories the publishers of magazine have very kindly given their permission to reprint in full several of the shortshort stories which have been purchased by them and published and which provide excellent examples of clever plot construction treatment description dialogue or literary style
in practically every shortshort story there has been displayed by the author an outstanding cleverness in one of these features and that is what lifts the story out of the class of the ordinary shortstory into that of the shortshort
the following is a story which was published in on august and one of those which i have selected as an example
by john franklin fellows
it was not until the brig west away had been at sea three days that spud martin got his chance to kills jack wilton
but all the breaks were with him now spud thought grimly even the fact that jack and he had been watch mates for six years
it was nearly dark and the west away was running into a blow off sable island
shorten sail had been the order and spud martin and jack wilton were on the yard furling the main sail
the rest of the crew were at their own stations
there would be no one to see the cause of the accident no one to prevent its inevitable result
spud usually good natured face looked strained and his short stocky muscles worked jerkily as he furled the sail to windward and studied jack who was down to leeward furling his side
a handsome lad jack was spud thought but hed look different after hed crashed to the deck seventyfive feet below
spud martin pulled his sheath knife and severed the lashing which held the foot rope to the jackstay on his side of the yardarm
holding the foot rope in his hands he watched bleakly as jack wilton began working his way in
and the closer jack came the greater grew the strain on the rope in hands
spud would have to let go shortly or be catapulted from the yard himself
for six years spud martin and jack wilton had been watch mates
for six years they had spent their hours ashore in the same haunts and for six years they had shared their confidences and ideas
and spud with the admiration which the more homely and cautious of two intimates always shows for the other had studied jack until he knew him better than he did himself
that was why spud knew what attitude toward elsie saunders must be even though jack had become taciturn and avoided looking spud in the eye
elsie saunders was a hostess at the royal palm dance palace on st bedolf street in boston
spud had taken one look at her and bought all her dance tickets for the rest of the evening
slim and undeniably graceful with wideset blue eyes and flaxen curly hair she seemed an angel to spud
and in the next few evenings spud did his best to prove that he was well made of better stuff than his unprepossessing exterior indicated he was
at any rate spud looked forward to seeing her after his next voyage
of course he didnot mention this unusual fidelity to his watch mate
he knew jack too well
love em and leave em
jack would say scornfully if not too originally
that was jack a reckless and handsome devil who could get away with it
and because spud had never found a girl worth hanging on to he had agreed with jack
it was different though when spud met elsie
unfortunately on his next arrival in port it fell to spud to stand the anchor watch while the rest of the crew went ashore in the longboat
and when spud finally got to the royal palms dance palace late that night he found jack dancing with elsie saunders
spud did not blame elsie for the obvious fact that she had fallen for jack
who would give a gorilla like himself a second look when jack was about
nor did he blame jack for cutting in on him
jack had always grabbed the best girl he saw even if spud had dated her first
it had not matter much before
and what was to become of the girls jack had loved and left hadnot mattered either
but elsie the two watch mates had gone to sea again and spud had tried for three days to convince himself that love em and leave em went for elsie as well as any other girl
he might have succeeded in convincing himself if jack too had seemed to realize that elsie was different if jack hadnot avoided looking his former chum in the eyes
but spud had failed and jack would pay now
in spite of his straining hands spud felt the rope sag beneath weight
he saw the catlike nervousness with which jack balanced himself
jack was scared
and spud grinned mirthlessly as eyes looked into his own for the first time in three days
you ainot lost your nerve jack
spud asked his voice harshly derisive above the sound of the wind in the rigging
jack nodded in the affirmative and grinned wryly
with good reason too he said something been afraid to tell yuh
spud felt the rope biting into his calloused hands
he could hold but a moment longer
what is it he asked indifferently
that after all the braggin i done about lovin em and leavin em jack blurted out went and done it
i got hitched
spud felt numb
so that was why jack had been afraid to look him in the eye
come in quick he grated
jack startled at the harsh command obeyed it instantly automatically
and as he sprang to the lee rigging releasing the strain on the foot rope the foot rope snapped taut
the sudden jerk threw spud from the yard
be good to her
spud yelled as he hurtled toward the deck below
the end
tis is one of the best examples i have ever seen where by exercising clever judgment in the point of attack or in the manner of opening the story the author has immediately aroused the interest of the reader in what would probably have been an uninteresting story if treated differently
you will note that mr fellows with his opening paragraph has jumped right into the action which immediately precedes the climax
the average inexperienced author and a great many who are not inexperienced would have begun the story with the later paragraph which is indicated by indentation and would have probably lost a sale
in this story the author first establishes a highly dramatic situation by telling you in the first five lines that one of his characters is out to kill the other one thereby also establishing a strong thread of suspense and creating in your mind a desire to know the whys and wherefores or what it is all about
then eight paragraphs later he describes in less than one hundred words the events leading up to the crisis with which he opens the story and presents the entire background and complication at the same time giving you a history of his characters
the plot in this story is very ordinary being nothing more than a situation in which a jealous rival sacrifices himself for the benefit of another man who has a better right to the girl
the climax is not particularly strong nor novel
it was no doubt the authors manner of telling the story in such a way as to immediately seize the interest of the reader and hold it that resulted in the sale of this story to the next published shortshort from which is outstanding and calls for favorable comment was published on may it follows by guy gilpatric we pulled into lyon at about midnight and found that we had twenty minutes to wait
beth said she felt hungry so i walked along the platform to one of those little white enameled pushcart buffets that they have in the french railroad stations and bought a jar of meat pate some fresh flaky rolls and a demi of burgundy
i was just paying for these when i saw a switch locomotive shunting a flat car into the shed and coupling it to the rear of our train
on this flat car lashed by the wheels was a shiny black wagon such as is used by undertakers when they call around at the house to pick up a job
sitting under this wagon were two gendarmes huddled in their cloaks and smoking cigarettes
i called the buffet boys attention
oh
why that is monsieur black wagon he exclaimed
do you know what is inside that wagon monsieur
it is the bois de justice the guillotine
there was an execution here this morning and now they are taking it back to paris
but buy a paper monsieur and you will read
i bought and having taken the paper and the food back to the compartment i started to read aloud
ugh
beth interrupted before i was half through
if you must read such horrors read them to yourself
i am trying to eat
please
it wasnot the sort of thing to give one an appetite at that
a certain madame lubet who had paid the plenty of her crime at fourteen minutes after five that morning
monsieur deibler who it appeared always attends to these little matters for the republic had arrived from paris with the official guillotine the night before and had set it up on the cobblestones in the prison yard
now in doing this said the journal monsieur deibler had been gravely at fault
for when the struggling victim was lashed to the table the apparatus had shifted just enough on the uneven cobbles to cause the knife to jam at well at an awkward point
thus the job was not exactly neat in fact its completion had required a certain amount of hand work by monsieur deibler
it is deplorable the newspaper declared that the horrors of capital punishment should thus be increased by the blunders of the callous ghouls who are paid to inflict it
we respectfully petition the minister of justice to dismiss the man deibler from the service of the state
the train was clicking across the switches out of the yards
a shadow fell across us
we turned and saw a cadaverous figure standing in the door a man who wore a long black cloak and who carried beneath his arm a black tin case about the size and shape of a hatbox
he bowed low
pardon he said and his voice was a hoarse croak
if i may intrude i will avail myself of this vacant place
there was nothing for me to say so i merely nodded and waved my hand toward the seat beside me
the dismal specter bowed again settled himself wearily upon the cushions and placed the tin box between us
i glanced at beth
she was leaning forward from her place in the corner staring at the thin ivoryyellow countenance of the newcomer
i caught her eye
she inclined her head slightly and moved her lips
no sound came from them but i knew she was saying deibler
i had no doubt of course that she was right
here sitting beside us in the compartment was the headsman of france he who had this very morning completed with his own man the gruesome job which his apparatus had bungled
an unpleasant odor became vaguely perceptible an odor as of cheap perfume mixed with a chemical disinfectant
i had never smelled any embalming fluid and yet i recognized it at once
i wondered and yet was afraid to wonder what was in that tin box
monsieur deibler sighed sepulchrally and commenced jotting something in a notebook which he rested upon his bony knee
he seemed to be drawing curves and lines
i glanced surreptitiously over his shoulder
what he had drawn was profile view of a womans head with dotted lines crossing the neck and skull
he studied this diagram in solemn silence and at length
then sighing once more he thrust the notebook into his pocket and turned to me
monsieur he said pardon the liberty which i take in addressing you
but today monsieur i have had great misfortune
my career will be ruined
i ask you monsieur did you see this evenings paper
the er legal news
yes i answered did see it monsieur
ah he said
then you have guessed to what i refer
it is not a matter which ordinarily i would mention before strangers and he bowed to beth and smiled a wolfish smile before a charming lady
i donot know exactly what i said but in any case fault if there was a fault was with the apparatus he continued
the affair was entirely beyond human control
harsh things have been said about me by those in important circles
the name even of the minister of justice has been invoked
well too can appeal to monsieur the minister
with what i have here
he patted the tin case and chuckled sardonically
i shuddered and edged away from him along the seat
in the box monsieur
i exclaimed recoiling
you have it in the box
ah pray put it out in the corridor
oh no indeed he demurred
it is so precious that i do not want it out of my sight
people are saying that i was forced to cut away er cut away what was left by hand
but with the contents of this box monsieur i hope to be able to convince both the medical authorities and the officials of justice that all such talk is rankest calumny
but see monsieur
he unsnapped a catch and threw open the top of the box
there with lips purple cheeks waxen eyes glassy and its hair a tangled mass of black reposed a head
i heard beth give that little whispery cry that always means she is about to faint
things went against me today but now i will appeal to the highest tribunal croaked the headsman will set up my apparatus in court and demonstrate that it could not possibly be as the witnesses and the newspaper have said
yes pierre auguste renoir giraudy the greatest hairdresser in france will prove with this model that suzette valier who claims seventy thousand francs damages because my permanent waving machine burned off her hair is a liar
one of the first things that impresses the reader of this story is that the author has traveled and knows his locale
his description of french atmosphere is so perfect that the reader is immediately transported into the realm of the story
following this we are immediately interested when he starts to describe gruesome details of an execution by guillotine which has taken place that morning thereby planting the events or setting the stage for what it is to follow
the outstanding feature of this story is the clever manipulation of dialogue and description in such a way as to totally mislead the reader or rather to cause the reader to mislead himself by forming the wrong conclusions which by the way are very natural in this case
in this story not only is the reader fooled but so are the two main characters all being lead to believe that the eccentric hair dresser is none other than the equally unusual executioner and that the tin box contained the gruesome severed head of the executed woman
in looking back over this story after experiencing the surprise shock and consequent relief in the last paragraph one cannot find a single instance of where the author has practiced any fraud on the reader
every bit of dialogue action and description is logical and can be accounted for
of course the whole story is based on coincidence of the strangest kind but not upon something that could not happen
as a shortshort story with a surprise twist ending this is a masterpiece
the next one which i will analyze was written by a woman and is highlighted with clever and sophisticated description and dialogue throughout besides having a stinger in the last line
this story was published in on april and follows by roberta yates glad to see you ellen
of course i am
but i i wish you hadnot come to new york
julie andrews looked at her kid sister with troubled eyes
ellen looked back with the clear laughing eyes of eighteen
afraid the big townll get me worry learned about life in freesburg
the men there keep up with the attacks of the times
do they
julie asked dryly hoped youd marry some nice boy there
five nice ones asked me easy to get a man to ask you to be his wife
you just refuse to be anything else
so its that simple
or else run in a rival on him
depends on cases
i use a couple of systems
say you do yourself well you plutocrat
ellen surveyed the penthouse living room with its expensive modernistic furnishings
she looked at frock which bore the stamp of paris
you know sis it surprised me when you made good in new york awfully clever to manage all this on a hundred a week and send money home too
i manage
fear in voice an in her averted eyes
ellen didnot seem to note it
modeling must be nice work wearing pretty clothes and all
it isnot hard is it
no it isnot hard julie said
but not working now the off season going to the theatre tonight
a friend of mine is bringing a friend of his
ellen gave her an athletic hug tickled with everything
remember when you said youd make a mint of money in new york and marry a millionaire
well youve made your mint
have you made your millionaire smile was strained be silly
millionaires tonight
whitney randolph has a bit
wallie langford hasnot so much
and i suppose hes for me
oh you bum
ellen had a grand evening
she gushed and squealed but now and then her bright eyes rested thoughtfully on whitney randolph
she liked him
oh a lot
who wouldnot
he had moviestar looks lean and brown with a crinkly grin
but she didnot like his possessive attitude toward julie
and julie well she let him get away with it
wallie langford was a drab young man
ellen paid him little attention until she saw him looking at julie like a dog who yearns for a pat but expects a kick out of luck ellen murmured both in love with julie
but whit holds the aces wally said
when julie and ellen were alone together ellen said crazy about whitney randolph arenot you like him julie said guardedly
are you engaged to him
no
oh no lips tightened
his mother wouldnot let him marry me a snooty dowager
the poor worm
ellen stormed he the nerve to marry without his mothers permission
and wherell he find a gorgeouser girl than you take it so hard ellen
julie tried to be light
julie you oughtnot to let him thinks he owns you
julie went scarlet
you ought to go around with other men
i heard wallie langford ask you to dinner tomorrow night
why donot you go
wally bores me
whit is going to a debutante dance show him go julie said
on the next evening julie departed with a wallie who was dazed by his good luck
when the door closed behind them ellen sprang to the telephone
she gave the number of whitney club and waited nervously while he was paged
hello he said
she spoke in a breathless squeak
this is ellen sister
oh mr randolph can you come over at once something wrong
i canot tell you over the telephone
when whitney randolph arrived she was still breathless know i shouldnot butt into affairs but i know she loves you
i canot imagine what makes her do such a thing though i guess every girl wants to get married
what are you talking about telling you
about julie marrying wallie langford been asking her to for ages but she wouldnot because she loves you
then she got to thinking what would happen to her when you married a debutante
so wallie and she went to greenwich to have dinner but really to get married
let me get this whitney randolph said hoarsely
julie eloped with wallie langford
ellen are you crazy tell you she did know that road house wallie goes to in greenwich whitney said
can you stop them
ellen was talking to air
whitney had gone
she picked up a book and began to read it calmly but now and again she looked at the clock
at eleven the telephone rang
central said that greenwich connecticut was calling voice came shrill with excitement
ellen married
who to
why to whitney of course
so he did fall for it ellen said
julie didnot hear her
he dashed in and accused wallie of eloping with me
poor wallie was so surprised
then whit literally dragged me out by the hair
he said he didnot give a hoot what his mother said
and so happy
congratulations said the kid sister be getting back to freesburg now that youre fixed up
any darned fool could tell from your letters home that you werenot happy darling so i came along to help always a way to get your man
ellen rang off
even if youre idiot enough to be his mistress first she added
observe how this author establishes the contrasting characters of these sisters in two paragraphs of less than fifty words
both are intensely human and just exactly like girls we all know although they are so different from each other
study the second paragraph which is indented and just observe the dramatic complication that is suggested by thus author in a bit of dialogue between the two girls
we do not have to be told that the older one is involved
then look at the way she builds up her characters in those five words ellen gave her an athletic hug
miss yates sets her stage and moves her characters about with a vim and snap that is refreshing
she does it with a few words in the paragraphs a sentences which are intended and set in black
the author then stands you on your head figuratively speaking with a last line that takes your breath wow what a stinger and something to think about
this is one of those six methods of supplying the surprise or trick ending wherein facts which are pertinent to the story are purposely withheld to supply the necessary punch in the last paragraph
number four which follows and which was one of the first shortshorts to be published in is outstanding because of two features
it appeared in the october issue a by morton thompson it was only a week before her last ten cents had gone for carfare and left her stranded in a downtown park
around were vague tall buildings crowds scurried back and forth in front of her
a man stopped to speak and she looked at him so dully he moved away abashed
the small figure in the cheap crushed hat the wrinkled coarse clothing drooped
here was money moving around her here were people working eating sleeping all with cares and happiness of their own
working in clean offices in bedlams of department stores
here was her freedom in the magic city
and she had no job
no money no friends no earthly chance of earning any
a chill mist blew in from the battery
thin soupy rain followed
through it all disappointment glued her to the bench motionless
she had long since forgotten to cry
a man came through the park
his thin coat was buttoned close against the souldissolving moisture a young man in poor clothing and with a tired face
he saw the girl
there was something so arresting in the sight of her sitting on the bench alone in the dark so heedless of the rain beating down on her that he quickened his steps and planted himself before her the matter girlie
she raised a dull hopeless face
there was no vestige of anything left upon it but hopelessness
he sat down beside her and forgot the weather happened to you
you look as if youd lost your last friend never had no friends
the words moved quickly
they were unstressed
aw say
come on now you donot mean that
he pit his arm around her
at the touch she gave way sobbed and sobbed gasping noises in an incoherent jumble of words that told the same old old story
the narrow home life in the narrow upstate town and the ultimate flight to the big city to show them
money going going gone at last
unknown jostled by the crowds and the bigness and the final decision that all mens hands were against her
and so i come here and almost finished the course in the night school and i was goin to get away from that lousy factory and they laughed at me all of them did an an now lookit me
he pointed to a row of newspaper buildings at one end of the park work there the address
come there tomorrow and get you a job
aw mister you donot mean it do you
sure i mean it kid
i know what it is to be poor an come to this town without a nickel and not knowin anybody
i did it myself
but youll forget it soon
i get you your job and youll be workin and youll tell me some day how funny it was
the world ainot all bad kid
people donot laugh at you when you get in trouble
lookit me
first person saw you i bet and see how tryin to help you
she could not speak
things moved so suddenly past
he stood up
in his pockets were a fivedollar bill and two ones last remnants of a small salary
his hands moved among the bills prudence sweeping the fine cloud of altruistic exaltation a little off his mind
then she looked at him and the animal devotion and relief in her face made him throw off reserve
here kid a five spot
get some sleep and get cleaned up an see you in the morning
he was gone
she sat quiet for a moment while her world swam
a clock boomed and the noise loosed her taut nerves
down on the dripping pavement she sank and sobbed and beat the cold stone
free again
the world had opened to her
half mad with joy she stumbled toward the light of a yawning subway
in one of the offices in the large newspaper building the next morning the young man heard his name called
gangsters had been busy during the night
and go down and get some kind of description will you
into the squat building he slouched
somewhere here was the man he was looking for
the morgue attendant hurried up in time to watch the young mans strange motions
he had backed away from a file of slabs and was leaning one hand upon a table
his eyes opened incredulously
there on a slab directly in front of him was the girl he had befriended last night in the park
the little fool
after hed been so decent to her
talked on all the virtues of humanity and tried to be a friend to her was ready to lend her a helping hand
given her his last fivedollar bill even
the morgue man glanced from one face to the other her
the reporter pulled himself together
what the hell
all in a days work
naw
i seen her some place i guess
oh
well say
she sure was a funny case at that
the reporter was moving toward the aisles again
yeah he flung back over his shoulder
yeah
they brought her in about twothirty this morning
drowned herself she did
yeah
yeah
down by the battery
funny thing
they bring her in all wet and dripping and lay her out an whaddaya suppose she ad clinched in her hand but finished the young man disgustedly
naw
it was a counterfeit fivedollar bill
mr description is beautiful and he gets into a heartinterest situation which grips you before the end of the second paragraph
just visualize the scene descried in paragraph one almost shivers and experiences the chill mist and thin soupy rain
observe how the author intersperses his history or retrospect with interesting action and dialogue which keeps the story moving as illustrated in about the 12th paragraph which is indented
also observe how cleverly he has handled the continuity of his story or the changes of time and place with no apparent break or annoying lapses
the biggest feature in this story is the climax or paradoxical ending which leaves the reader aghast and forces him to go back and read the story over again in an effort to discover what could possibly had lead up to its shocking end
in other words it certainly leaves much food for thought and speculation and is one of those stories which sticks in ones mind because it leaves unanswered a number of questions
why did the girl commit suicide
how did she discover the bill was counterfeit
was this the straw that broke the camels back
this is the type of shortshort that henry might have written and it is easy to see why the editor who bought it immediately recognized its merit
the next story is another written by a woman and although it contains no startling plot it has some outstanding merit
it was published in on july 5th by phyllis duganne emmy was awakened by their angry voices in the kitchen below fred and dan ryder quarreling more loudly more fiercely even than usual
she huddled beneath the patchwork quilt listening
ever since their fathers death they had quarreled so
fred wanted the farm to himself he hated his younger brother hated emmy
until yesterday she had been sick with fear that dan would go
her frightened mouth relaxed a warmth crept over her thin body
if it hadnot been for wanting to send her away dan might never have loved her
it was only yesterday that that miracle had occurred
fred had told her to get out had struck her and dan had come swiftly around the corner of the barn
had picked up in his strong arms and steadied her trembling
em he had said
why em
he stared at her and then held her tightly
why emmy
and she had put her lips to his
the tremulous softness of those young lips was destroyed once more as she pressed them together to stifle a scream
below in the kitchen had sounded the report of a gun
emmy was a coward
thirteen years in the state orphanage before old caleb ryder took her out to do the housework which his wife could not attend to from her grace and five years of bullying were not the stuff to make courage
for a long time she waited
then shaking she got out of bed and walked down the stairs in her cottonflannel nightdress
fred ryder stood at the foot of the steps
well what do you want you little fool he demanded
she wet her lips trying to speak her eyes straining to see past him into the kitchen
that damned hound of ainot going to root up any more land on this farm said fred ryder grimly
his thin lips moved in something like a smile for fertilizer now
then his face darkened
you git back to bed or well use you for fertlizer too
emmy got back
it seemed hours later that she heard a second shot
she pulled the patchwork up over her head and lay motionless
the kitchen was empty when she crept downstairs to get breakfast
then fred came in from the barn whistling and sat down at the table
dan she whispered
cleared out he answered shortly
an you clear out too
as soon as he was gone she thrust her thin arms into her dingy sheepskin coat and started running down the valley
the ground was hard frost had come early this year and the wind was cold
the brown stalks of the corn crackled as she brushed against them and the lank scarecrows who guarded the field seemed to lean toward her leering
in half an hour the entire town was in an uproar
that state girl from ryders had come crying to old sheriff dillingham that fred ryder had murdered his brother
the valley road looked like sunday morning alive with wagons and ford cars and people all moving swiftly more tensely than ever they moved to worship
fred ryder laughed at them
he and dan had had a quarrel and dan had cleared out
he didnot know nor care where the fool had gone
good riddance said fred ryder and his eyes rested with no emotion stronger than contempt upon pale accusing face
shots
of course
a man had a right to shoot a worthless hound hadnot he
the quarrel had begun over that damned dog
dan wouldnot have gone away thout saying goodbye to me said emmy in her thin voice brother looked at her and snorted knew dan was a fool but i didnot think he was that much o a fool
someone laughed voice was scarcely audible flat and unaccented
why had there been two shots shot at the hound twice fred answered easily
tense with excitement the men solemnly exhumed the body of dog
there was one bullet wound
fred shrugged
he was no sharpshooter that was all
he must have missed the second time
as detectives they were first class farmers said fred ryder
two state policemen arrived on motorcycles
the accused murderer became jocular
if he had killed his brother he suggested pleasantly thered probably be a corpse somewhere about
they searched until sundown the house the barn the grounds
the sear leaves of the corn stocks rustled ominously as men moved among them and the drunken scarecrows witnesses if there had been a crime to the scene flapped their strawstuffed sleeves in the wind as though they shook with dreadful laughter
there was no body and the searchers looked at emmy curiously have said goodbye to me if hed gone away she repeated almost without emphasis
the sheriff took fred ryder home with him that night and the search recommenced in the morning
they could not find dan ryder dead but they could not find him alive
insistent tireless the girl emmy reiterated her statement dean gone away thout sayin goodbye to me
you canot hang a man emmy sheriff dillingham told her
when the victim may be walkin around on his own two legs
on the third day emmy sat dryeyed paler than ever watching the searchers
one by one they were giving up forming a doubtful group about the sheriff dull eyes closed
they mustnot give up
once fred was released and back here unwatched cat came and rubbed against legs and the girl stroked her absently her eyes on the men
they mustnot stop searching
the cat was hungry
as emmy moved across the furrowed field toward the sheriff it followed her purring against her skirts weaving in and out about her thin legs as it had used to do with dan
the sheriff shook his head
emmy theres nobody here
the others nodded
dan wouldve said she began again monotonously and suddenly her thin voice stopped
her dull eyes became enormous in the withered corn a grotesque scarecrow stood before them its featureless face of bunched tight about its overstuffed body
dan cat rubbed against its flapping trousers purring loudly lifting herself up on her hind legs and arching her soft back
the men looked at staring eyes and their blood went cold
reluctantly the sheriff stepped forward and lifted the ragged hat
the packed straw slid down and the thing lurched sideways as the sheriff snatched away his trembling hand have said goodbye to me whispered emmy dully
this is another example of where the author has opened the story with interesting action reserving the historic description of characters and situations until some paragraphs later
like this story also has a gruesome element which a great many people like perhaps because they enjoy being shocked
observe how this author has crowded a whole life story of one of her principal characters into one interesting paragraph of less than fifty words and how she has jumped from the present to the past and back again with no apparent break
here she not only gives a perfect description of the character but of her past as well while at the same time keeping the action in the story moving
take a look at the second paragraph which is indented and observe how this young woman indulges in a bit of realistic but brief description which projects perfect illusion for anyone who has ever walked through a corn field on a winter day
it is the ability to observe and describe such apparently trivial things as the rustling of corn stalks and the flapping of the strawstuffed sleeves of the scarecrow in the wind that differentiates the seasoned writer from the amateur
a strong thread of suspense is maintained throughout in this story and the surprise climax is heightened by the simple introduction of a cat which leads to a gruesome discovery
the ending of this story is on a par with the ending of that famous french story in which a sculptor conceals the body of the victim of his crime by covering it with plaster and mounting it in an art gallery
another outstanding feature in this story is the pathetic faith of the girl and her insistent moaning which is expressed in the last line
the last of this series which i have selected for illustration and comment was published in on may and follows by houston day john addington closed his eyes
the nurse with the curly hair was rubbing his face with vaseline
then she covered his mouth and nose with a cone
breathe deeply
obediently addington inhaled the sweet fumes
he wondered how badly he was hurt
what was the doctor going to do to him
but even before he could begin to answer his own questions he realized he was suffocating
he struggled
fought to unclasp his hands
he wanted air
again distantly he heard the nurse deep breath
now
again
again
addington obeyed
magically the feeling of distress passed
he dreamed
memories flooded his mind in flashing pictures
he saw himself as he knocked at evelyn hayes apartment on grove street
then with scarcely an interval he was inside
his face tingled
she had slapped him
bill walsh had said she had round feels
bill was wrong
but bill walsh wasnot usually mistaken
he was a good promoter
he saw himself with bill at the hotel in the adirondacks
they were vacationing together
he saw the lake
from their rowboat it stretched in a calm expanse of shimmering blue to the shore where the shadows of the fir trees turned its color to the black of molten tar
they were in the water struggling
it was cold
like melted ice
their boat bottom up was slippery with moss
there was nothing to grasp
he cried out
addington knew he was drowning
the finality of death terrified him
he saw distorted face
his hair was hanging in sodden locks
bill was careful of his hair
he wore it long
brushed straight back
he heard voices
welcome voices
a hand reached over and grasped him
they were saved
now he was in the city
at apartment
she had slapped him again only two night before but he had gone back
he really liked her now
bill was wrong
she wasnot that kind
evelyn was weeping
she had lost her job donot know what do
he pillowed her head on his shoulder
but baby why worry when you have me
but evelyn was despondent
she dabbed at her eyes have to give up the apartment
he held her closer
tenderly
then he drained his glass
the grin smelled like antifreeze compound
but it glowed pleasantly in his stomach tell you what dearest
if you donot find something by the first well take a stroll down to the municipal building and get married
what do you say
evelyn said no
said it emphatically and unequivocally
she didnot want to be tied down to a husband a radio and a vacuum cleaner
but the alcohol had sharpened his perception
evelyn was too positive
he didnot believe her
he became more cautious
he had already said too much
what the devil did he want to get married for anyway
the gin began to lose its effect
there was no glow now
instead each succeeding glass seemed to hit him dully on the back of his neck
he wanted to go home
he felt dull and stupid
tired too
he would have a headache in the morning
evelyn leaned closer go just yet so lonesome and blue
three days later they were married
the doctor picked up the scalpel
he nodded to the curlyhaired nurse
she placed the cone back on face
drip
drip
drip
addington dream pictures became shorter
more vivid
more fantastic
he was in the army
a german lunged at him with a bayonet
he parried jabbed
the german was bill walsh
but he had a french rifle
his bayonet was a yard long
he leered and said got round heels
then he felt bayonet pierce his body
he screamed
walsh was standing over him
he plunged the bayonet in again
and again
each time the pain became more intense
why didnot it kill him
he couldnot move squirm out of the way
the scene faded
he was in an airplane
bill walsh was the pilot
they soared through misty clouds
he felt the vibrations of the propeller but there was no noise
then he was falling
falling
falling through space
bill had dumped him out
where was his parachute
frantically he searched for the cord
it wasnot there
but had a parachute
he knew it
he twisted his body in the air
beneath him the ground rushed up
it was just like he had read
he saw a telephone pole
it had a sharpened point
he was going to strike it
he cried out
the nurse looked at the doctor
he nodded
she opened a second can
drip
drip
drip
another dream
he was at the office
he knew he had been right
but the boss was insultingly emphatic in his criticism
and if you donot like it you know what you can do
his employer wore his familiar baggy suit but his face was that of bill walsh
addington tried to justify himself for quitting as he ascended the steps to his apartment
he unlocked the door
and then again he saw bill walsh
he felt a different pain a stunning rending pain but he did not cry out
how funny they looked coat was hung over a chair
there was revolver too
he saw himself shooting
he hardly recognized the pale angry face as his own screamed evelyn
oh donot
she should have kept quiet
he turned the gun toward her and pressed the trigger
then there were policemen
he had fired
they shot back
he couldnot feel their bullets
except when he started to run
then they stabbed sharply
bill had said she had round heels
he must have known
he opened his eyes
he felt deathly sick
my god
what a nightmare
the curlyhaired nurse looked like a friendly sympathetic little thing tell her about it
he caught her eyes
she bent nearer
he smiled drunkenly
the nurse looked at him quizzically
well he would have to know sooner or later so why not now while his senses were dulled by the anaesthetic
you did she said
this author adopts a novel literary style by opening his story in the operating room of a hospital and while he describes a scene that is tragically familiar to anyone who has ever witnessed or experienced a surgical operation he intersperses retrospect which explains all that has gone before without in the least slowing up the story or interfering with the thread of suspense
the result is that by the time one has reached the climax all kinds of speculations are being indulged in there is one particular paragraph which i have indented in this story that strikes one more forcibly than all others with the exception of the last line of course
look at the condensed drama in that paragraph which ends with the words drip
drip
drip
it gives me a chill every time i read it
of all the shortshort stories i have read i believe that there is more punch contained in four words in this one than any of them
i refer to the last line which deals one a knock out blow and tells us that not all of the hallucinations which john addington experienced while under the anaesthetic were unreal and that he had murdered his wife and his best friend while in a jealous rage
thumbnail synopses of published shortshort stories from and a study and analysis of the following thumbnail synopses of one hundred and twentyeight of the most outstanding shortshort stories published in and over a period of two years will enable the student to make some interesting conclusions
besides this it gives one a crosssectional idea of the type of stories that seem to be the most popular
