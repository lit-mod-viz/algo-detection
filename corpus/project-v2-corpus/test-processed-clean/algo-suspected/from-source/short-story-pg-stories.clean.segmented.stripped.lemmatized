importance of literary style be -PRON- not for the clever literary style employ in the writing of a great many shortshort story which have be accept and publish -PRON- would have qualify as ordinary shortstorie only 
what be mean by this be that great many clever writer have take what would otherwise have be an ordinary shortstory and by either purposely mislead the reader with dialogue which have a double meaning or by withhold important fact until the last paragraph -PRON- have make -PRON- into a shortshort story 
in other word -PRON- have give -PRON- what -PRON- call the trick end which be a big dramatic punch or surprise to the reader 
in some of the shortshort story which have be accept and publish the reader be even leave in a quandary and be require to supply -PRON- own interpretation at the end 
in other -PRON- be leave in a serious and reflective mood with a wealth of food for thought 
in practically all of -PRON- which be write accord to formula there be a surprise in the last paragraph 
the majority of those which have be accept and publish be literary gem or have distinctive feature about -PRON- which lift -PRON- out of the ordinary 
i will enumerate a few of these feature in order to make -PRON- clear 
-PRON- be in which the dialogue be so clever that -PRON- elicit a chuckle or an outright laugh 
for example the last two paragraph in the killer a story write by arthur munion and publish in september a thumbnail synopsis of which be number16 on page the closing paragraph be as follow where -PRON- want to know do -PRON- get that wallop 
that 
oh that 
armstrong assume a worried look temper -PRON- whisper 
beastly thing baskerville 
ugh 
i see red 
forget human 
growl like a wolf 
likely as not to tear a man to ribbon when what go baskerville 
well any other time -PRON- know 
in which the dialogue be so cleverly write that -PRON- portray a character so clearly that one can almost feel -PRON- have know the person 
for example in the story pearl write by philip wylie and publish in october 5 m the follow paragraph appear mr bland eye become more lifeless and opaque 
-PRON- say quite 
throckmorton of taine stare at the ceiling think with three month -PRON- could er assemble something decent 
about er say eighty thousand pound what 
mr bradley finger lifter and fall 
quite -PRON- repeat 
the thumbnail synopsis of this story be number and appear on page in which the description be so wellworded that one be immediately transport into the atmosphere of the story as in the case of help hand by morton thompson which appear in the october issue of and the thumbnail synopsis of which be number on page of this index 
this be exemplify by the following paragraph here be -PRON- freedom in the magic city 
and -PRON- have no hob 
no money no friend no earthly chance of earn any 
a chill must blow in from the battery 
thin soupy rain follow 
the author of this story also reserve a terrific dramatic punch for the very last line wherein -PRON- tell -PRON- that what be find crumple in the hand of the suicide victim be the fivedollar bill that -PRON- have give -PRON- and that -PRON- be a counterfeit thereby leave great latitude for speculation 
in which the story get under way so speedily that the interest of the reader be immediately seize in an iron grip with the result that -PRON- be impossible to lay down the magazine without read the story through 
an example of this will be find in take for a ride thumbnail synopsis number on page of index and of which the follow paragraph be an illustration 
jenning be be take for a ride 
a man sit beside -PRON- on the front seat of -PRON- car with a gun press against -PRON- rib 
the gun be in the man pocket and be hold in -PRON- left hand 
jenning didnot feel that -PRON- have ever do any harm to anybody 
true -PRON- as a bootlegger but -PRON- be only a little one and try not to sell any poison stuff 
this story be write by william ford and this clever author not only get -PRON- story under way at the top speed in the first two paragraph but introduce -PRON- main character in that space also 
in which the action of the character be so cleverly describe that -PRON- be make to live and breathe and to be so human that the illusion of know -PRON- be perfect 
as in the story one strong thing from the june issue of write by carrie tibbet thumbnail synopsis number on page 109of index the follow paragraph illustrate ruth stand for a moment look down at -PRON- husband 
-PRON- look at -PRON- with the eye of a beat dog and the grin of a satyr 
-PRON- drop quietly to -PRON- knee and begin unlace -PRON- shoe 
there be also a pathetic punch in this paragraph as -PRON- describe the action of a wife who have decide to desert -PRON- husband because of -PRON- drinking and how -PRON- love triumph over the decision when -PRON- come in a drunk again 
wherein in just a few word an author tell a whole story so cleverly that the reader see in retrospect perhaps what have require year to develop in the life of a character 
an example of this be contain in the story entitle have say goodbye by philip duganne in the july issue of thumbnail synopsis number on page of index 
i refer to the following paragraph 
emmy be a coward 
thirteen year in the state orphanage before old caleb ryder take -PRON- out to do the housework which -PRON- wife could not attend to from -PRON- grave and five year of bullying be not the stuff to make courage 
this story also contain a number of other very clever paragraph descriptive of action and atmosphere 
-PRON- can see the character in the story move about as if in real life or on the talk picture screen as -PRON- read the following paragraph from the same story 
-PRON- search until sundown the house the barn the ground 
the sear leave of the cornstalk rustle ominously as man move among -PRON- and the drunken scarecrow witness if there have be a crime to the scene flap -PRON- strawstuffed sleeve in the wind as though -PRON- shake with dreadful laughter 
in which the author have very cleverly describe in just a few word at the end of -PRON- story retrospective action or event which explain everything and leave the reader aghast 
an illustration of this be contain in the story the perfect murder 
thumbnail synopsis number on page write by roy mangum and publish in of april following be a paragraph but then willowville folk donot know to this day that emily holden be mark daughter that mark have never be marry and that old man fellow be the only human being on earth who know those thing 
in which the author have convert into a shortshort story what would have be an ordinary shortstory by open up -PRON- action at the most interesting point of the narrative and then five or six paragraph later describe in retrospect previous event which would have be unintereste reading 
this be aptly illustrate in love -PRON- and write by john franklin fellow and publish in on august 15th 
thumbnail synopsis number page index 
-PRON- opening paragraph which immediately seize interest be as follow -PRON- be not until the brig west away have be at sea three day that spud martin get -PRON- chance to kill jack wilton 
but all the break be with -PRON- now spud think grimly even the fact that jack and -PRON- have be watch mate for six year 
the retrospect which would have be a very uninteresting opening be contain in the following paragraph which appear a little more than half way down the first column 
for six year spud martin and jack wilton have be watch mate 
for six year -PRON- have spend -PRON- hour ashore in the same haunt and for six year -PRON- have share -PRON- confidence and idea 
and spud with the admiration which the more homely and cautious of two intimate always show for the other have study jack until -PRON- know -PRON- better than -PRON- do -PRON- 
that be why spud know what attitude toward elsie saunder must be even though jack have become taciturn and avoid look spud in the eye 
all the way through these shortshort story one find beautifully write line which aptly describe atmosphere action and character 
the follow be a few example the old woman look like a piece of crumple brown wax lie there against a high ruffle pillow 
the doctor pick up the scalpel 
-PRON- nod to the curlyhaire nurse 
-PRON- place the cone back on face 
drip 
drip 
dip 
but -PRON- didnot hear what -PRON- be say for intuitively -PRON- place that tone 
-PRON- strike the cunning note of the conversationally intimate 
gingerly -PRON- seat -PRON- upon the straight chair beside the desk and even as -PRON- do so the smile mask drop from face 
the dismal spectre bow again settle -PRON- wearily upon the cushion and place the tin box between -PRON- 
how could i know 
what do any woman know about the man -PRON- marry 
-PRON- begin with faith -PRON- continue with hope and unless -PRON- divorce -PRON- -PRON- stay by -PRON- through charity 
philosophy well put 
some successful shortshort story the publisher of magazine have very kindly give -PRON- permission to reprint in full several of the shortshort story which have be purchase by -PRON- and publish and which provide excellent example of clever plot construction treatment description dialogue or literary style 
in practically every shortshort story there have be display by the author an outstanding cleverness in one of these feature and that be what lift the story out of the class of the ordinary shortstory into that of the shortshort 
the following be a story which be publish in on august and one of those which i have select as an example 
by john franklin fellow 
-PRON- be not until the brig west away have be at sea three day that spud martin get -PRON- chance to kill jack wilton 
but all the break be with -PRON- now spud think grimly even the fact that jack and -PRON- have be watch mate for six year 
-PRON- be nearly dark and the west away be run into a blow off sable island 
shorten sail have be the order and spud martin and jack wilton be on the yard furl the main sail 
the rest of the crew be at -PRON- own station 
there would be no one to see the cause of the accident no one to prevent -PRON- inevitable result 
spud usually good natured face look strained and -PRON- short stocky muscle work jerkily as -PRON- furl the sail to windward and study jack who be down to leeward furl -PRON- side 
a handsome lad jack be spud think but -PRON- would look different after -PRON- would crash to the deck seventyfive foot below 
spud martin pull -PRON- sheath knife and sever the lashing which hold the foot rope to the jackstay on -PRON- side of the yardarm 
hold the foot rope in -PRON- hand -PRON- watch bleakly as jack wilton begin work -PRON- way in 
and the close jack come the great grow the strain on the rope in hand 
spud would have to let go shortly or be catapult from the yard -PRON- 
for six year spud martin and jack wilton have be watch mate 
for six year -PRON- have spend -PRON- hour ashore in the same haunt and for six year -PRON- have share -PRON- confidence and idea 
and spud with the admiration which the more homely and cautious of two intimate always show for the other have study jack until -PRON- know -PRON- better than -PRON- do -PRON- 
that be why spud know what attitude toward elsie saunder must be even though jack have become taciturn and avoid look spud in the eye 
elsie saunder be a hostess at the royal palm dance palace on st bedolf street in boston 
spud have take one look at -PRON- and buy all -PRON- dance ticket for the rest of the evening 
slim and undeniably graceful with wideset blue eye and flaxen curly hair -PRON- seem an angel to spud 
and in the next few evening spud do -PRON- good to prove that -PRON- be well make of well stuff than -PRON- unprepossessing exterior indicate -PRON- be 
at any rate spud look forward to see -PRON- after -PRON- next voyage 
of course -PRON- didnot mention this unusual fidelity to -PRON- watch mate 
-PRON- know jack too well 
love -PRON- and leave -PRON- 
jack would say scornfully if not too originally 
that be jack a reckless and handsome devil who could get away with -PRON- 
and because spud have never find a girl worth hang on to -PRON- have agree with jack 
-PRON- be different though when spud meet elsie 
unfortunately on -PRON- next arrival in port -PRON- fall to spud to stand the anchor watch while the rest of the crew go ashore in the longboat 
and when spud finally get to the royal palm dance palace late that night -PRON- find jack dance with elsie saunder 
spud do not blame elsie for the obvious fact that -PRON- have fall for jack 
who would give a gorilla like -PRON- a second look when jack be about 
nor do -PRON- blame jack for cut in on -PRON- 
jack have always grab the good girl -PRON- see even if spud have date -PRON- first 
-PRON- have not matter much before 
and what be to become of the girl jack have love and leave hadnot matter either 
but elsie the two watch mate have go to sea again and spud have try for three day to convince -PRON- that love -PRON- and leave -PRON- go for elsie as well as any other girl 
-PRON- may have succeed in convince -PRON- if jack too have seem to realize that elsie be different if jack hadnot avoid look -PRON- former chum in the eye 
but spud have fail and jack would pay now 
in spite of -PRON- strain hand spud feel the rope sag beneath weight 
-PRON- see the catlike nervousness with which jack balance -PRON- 
jack be scare 
and spud grin mirthlessly as eye look into -PRON- own for the first time in three day 
-PRON- ainot lose -PRON- nerve jack 
spud ask -PRON- voice harshly derisive above the sound of the wind in the rig 
jack nod in the affirmative and grin wryly 
with good reason too -PRON- say something be afraid to tell yuh 
spud feel the rope bite into -PRON- calloused hand 
-PRON- could hold but a moment longer 
what be -PRON- -PRON- ask indifferently 
that after all the braggin i do about love -PRON- and leavin -PRON- jack blurt out go and do -PRON- 
i get hitch 
spud feel numb 
so that be why jack have be afraid to look -PRON- in the eye 
come in quick -PRON- grate 
jack startle at the harsh command obey -PRON- instantly automatically 
and as -PRON- spring to the lee rig release the strain on the foot rope the foot rope snap taut 
the sudden jerk throw spud from the yard 
be good to -PRON- 
spud yelled as -PRON- hurtle toward the deck below 
the end 
tis be one of the good example i have ever see where by exercise clever judgment in the point of attack or in the manner of open the story the author have immediately arouse the interest of the reader in what would probably have be an uninteresting story if treat differently 
-PRON- will note that mr fellow with -PRON- opening paragraph have jump right into the action which immediately precede the climax 
the average inexperienced author and a great many who be not inexperienced would have begin the story with the later paragraph which be indicate by indentation and would have probably lose a sale 
in this story the author first establish a highly dramatic situation by tell -PRON- in the first five line that one of -PRON- character be out to kill the other one thereby also establish a strong thread of suspense and create in -PRON- mind a desire to know the why s and wherefore or what -PRON- be all about 
then eight paragraph later -PRON- describe in less than one hundred word the event lead up to the crisis with which -PRON- open the story and present the entire background and complication at the same time give -PRON- a history of -PRON- character 
the plot in this story be very ordinary be nothing more than a situation in which a jealous rival sacrifice -PRON- for the benefit of another man who have a well right to the girl 
the climax be not particularly strong nor novel 
-PRON- be no doubt the author manner of tell the story in such a way as to immediately seize the interest of the reader and hold -PRON- that result in the sale of this story to the next publish shortshort from which be outstanding and call for favorable comment be publish on may -PRON- follow by guy gilpatric -PRON- pull into lyon at about midnight and find that -PRON- have twenty minute to wait 
beth say -PRON- feel hungry so i walk along the platform to one of those little white enamel pushcart buffet that -PRON- have in the french railroad station and buy a jar of meat pate some fresh flaky roll and a demi of burgundy 
i be just pay for these when i see a switch locomotive shunt a flat car into the shed and couple -PRON- to the rear of -PRON- train 
on this flat car lash by the wheel be a shiny black wagon such as be use by undertaker when -PRON- call around at the house to pick up a job 
sit under this wagon be two gendarme huddle in -PRON- cloak and smoking cigarette 
i call the buffet boy attention 
oh 
why that be monsieur black wagon -PRON- exclaim 
do -PRON- know what be inside that wagon monsieur 
-PRON- be the bois de justice the guillotine 
there be an execution here this morning and now -PRON- be take -PRON- back to paris 
but buy a paper monsieur and -PRON- will read 
i buy and have take the paper and the food back to the compartment i start to read aloud 
ugh 
beth interrupt before i be half through 
if -PRON- must read such horror read -PRON- to -PRON- 
i be try to eat 
please 
-PRON- wasnot the sort of thing to give one an appetite at that 
a certain madame lubet who have pay the plenty of -PRON- crime at fourteen minute after five that morning 
monsieur deibler who -PRON- appear always attend to these little matter for the republic have arrive from paris with the official guillotine the night before and have set -PRON- up on the cobblestone in the prison yard 
now in do this say the journal monsieur deibler have be gravely at fault 
for when the struggle victim be lash to the table the apparatus have shift just enough on the uneven cobble to cause the knife to jam at well at an awkward point 
thus the job be not exactly neat in fact -PRON- completion have require a certain amount of hand work by monsieur deibler 
-PRON- be deplorable the newspaper declare that the horror of capital punishment should thus be increase by the blunder of the callous ghoul who be pay to inflict -PRON- 
-PRON- respectfully petition the minister of justice to dismiss the man deibler from the service of the state 
the train be click across the switch out of the yard 
a shadow fall across -PRON- 
-PRON- turn and see a cadaverous figure stand in the door a man who wear a long black cloak and who carry beneath -PRON- arm a black tin case about the size and shape of a hatbox 
-PRON- bow low 
pardon -PRON- say and -PRON- voice be a hoarse croak 
if i may intrude i will avail -PRON- of this vacant place 
there be nothing for -PRON- to say so i merely nod and wave -PRON- hand toward the seat beside -PRON- 
the dismal specter bow again settle -PRON- wearily upon the cushion and place the tin box between -PRON- 
i glance at beth 
-PRON- be lean forward from -PRON- place in the corner stare at the thin ivoryyellow countenance of the newcomer 
i catch -PRON- eye 
-PRON- incline -PRON- head slightly and move -PRON- lip 
no sound come from -PRON- but i know -PRON- be say deibler 
i have no doubt of course that -PRON- be right 
here sit beside -PRON- in the compartment be the headsman of france -PRON- who have this very morning complete with -PRON- own man the gruesome job which -PRON- apparatus have bungle 
an unpleasant odor become vaguely perceptible an odor as of cheap perfume mix with a chemical disinfectant 
i have never smell any embalm fluid and yet i recognize -PRON- at once 
i wonder and yet be afraid to wonder what be in that tin box 
monsieur deibler sigh sepulchrally and commence jot something in a notebook which -PRON- rest upon -PRON- bony knee 
-PRON- seem to be draw curve and line 
i glance surreptitiously over -PRON- shoulder 
what -PRON- have draw be profile view of a womans head with dotted line cross the neck and skull 
-PRON- study this diagram in solemn silence and at length 
then sigh once more -PRON- thrust the notebook into -PRON- pocket and turn to -PRON- 
monsieur -PRON- say pardon the liberty which i take in address -PRON- 
but today monsieur i have have great misfortune 
-PRON- career will be ruin 
i ask -PRON- monsieur do -PRON- see this evening paper 
the er legal news 
yes i answer do see -PRON- monsieur 
ah -PRON- say 
then -PRON- have guess to what i refer 
-PRON- be not a matter which ordinarily i would mention before stranger and -PRON- bow to beth and smile a wolfish smile before a charming lady 
i donot know exactly what i say but in any case fault if there be a fault be with the apparatus -PRON- continue 
the affair be entirely beyond human control 
harsh thing have be say about -PRON- by those in important circle 
the name even of the minister of justice have be invoke 
well too can appeal to monsieur the minister 
with what i have here 
-PRON- pat the tin case and chuckle sardonically 
i shudder and edge away from -PRON- along the seat 
in the box monsieur 
i exclaim recoil 
-PRON- have -PRON- in the box 
ah pray put -PRON- out in the corridor 
oh no indeed -PRON- demur 
-PRON- be so precious that i do not want -PRON- out of -PRON- sight 
people be say that i be force to cut away er cut away what be leave by hand 
but with the content of this box monsieur i hope to be able to convince both the medical authority and the official of justice that all such talk be rank calumny 
but see monsieur 
-PRON- unsnap a catch and throw open the top of the box 
there with lip purple cheek waxen eye glassy and -PRON- hair a tangle mass of black repose a head 
i hear beth give that little whispery cry that always mean -PRON- be about to faint 
thing go against -PRON- today but now i will appeal to the high tribunal croak the headsman will set up -PRON- apparatus in court and demonstrate that -PRON- could not possibly be as the witness and the newspaper have say 
yes pierre auguste renoir giraudy the great hairdresser in france will prove with this model that suzette valier who claim seventy thousand franc damage because -PRON- permanent wave machine burn off -PRON- hair be a liar 
one of the first thing that impress the reader of this story be that the author have travel and know -PRON- locale 
-PRON- description of french atmosphere be so perfect that the reader be immediately transport into the realm of the story 
follow this -PRON- be immediately interested when -PRON- start to describe gruesome detail of an execution by guillotine which have take place that morning thereby plant the event or set the stage for what -PRON- be to follow 
the outstanding feature of this story be the clever manipulation of dialogue and description in such a way as to totally mislead the reader or rather to cause the reader to mislead -PRON- by form the wrong conclusion which by the way be very natural in this case 
in this story not only be the reader fool but so be the two main character all be lead to believe that the eccentric hair dresser be none other than the equally unusual executioner and that the tin box contain the gruesome sever head of the execute woman 
in look back over this story after experience the surprise shock and consequent relief in the last paragraph one can not find a single instance of where the author have practice any fraud on the reader 
every bit of dialogue action and description be logical and can be account for 
of course the whole story be base on coincidence of the strange kind but not upon something that could not happen 
as a shortshort story with a surprise twist end this be a masterpiece 
the next one which i will analyze be write by a woman and be highlight with clever and sophisticated description and dialogue throughout besides have a stinger in the last line 
this story be publish in on april and follow by roberta yate glad to see -PRON- ellen 
of course i be

ellen rang off 
even if -PRON- be idiot enough to be -PRON- mistress first -PRON- add 
observe how this author establish the contrast character of these sister in two paragraph of less than fifty word 
both be intensely human and just exactly like girl -PRON- all know although -PRON- be so different from each other 
study the second paragraph which be indent and just observe the dramatic complication that be suggest by thus author in a bit of dialogue between the two girl 
-PRON- do not have to be tell that the old one be involve 
then look at the way -PRON- build up -PRON- character in those five word ellen give -PRON- an athletic hug 
miss yate set -PRON- stage and move -PRON- character about with a vim and snap that be refresh 
-PRON- do -PRON- with a few word in the paragraph a sentence which be intend and set in black 
the author then stand -PRON- on -PRON- head figuratively speak with a last line that take -PRON- breath wow what a stinger and something to think about 
this be one of those six method of supply the surprise or trick end wherein fact which be pertinent to the story be purposely withhold to supply the necessary punch in the last paragraph

mr description be beautiful and -PRON- get into a heartinter situation which grip -PRON- before the end of the second paragraph 
just visualize the scene descry in paragraph one almost shiver and experience the chill mist and thin soupy rain 
observe how the author intersperse -PRON- history or retrospect with interesting action and dialogue which keep the story move as illustrate in about the 12th paragraph which be indent 
also observe how cleverly -PRON- have handle the continuity of -PRON- story or the change of time and place with no apparent break or annoying lapse 
the big feature in this story be the climax or paradoxical ending which leave the reader aghast and force -PRON- to go back and read the story over again in an effort to discover what could possibly have lead up to -PRON- shocking end 
in other word -PRON- certainly leave much food for thought and speculation and be one of those story which stick in one mind because -PRON- leave unanswere a number of question 
why do the girl commit suicide 
how do -PRON- discover the bill be counterfeit 
be this the straw that break the camel back 
this be the type of shortshort that henry may have write and -PRON- be easy to see why the editor who buy -PRON- immediately recognize -PRON- merit 
the next story be another write by a woman and although -PRON- contain no startling plot -PRON- have some outstanding merit 
-PRON- be publish in on july 5th by phyllis duganne emmy be awaken by -PRON- angry voice in the kitchen below fred and dan ryder quarrel more loudly more fiercely even than usual 
-PRON- huddle beneath the patchwork quilt listening 
ever since -PRON- father death -PRON- have quarrel so

and -PRON- have put -PRON- lip to -PRON- 
the tremulous softness of those young lip be destroy once more as -PRON- press -PRON- together to stifle a scream 
below in the kitchen have sound the report of a gun 
emmy be a coward 
thirteen year in the state orphanage before old caleb ryder take -PRON- out to do the housework which -PRON- wife could not attend to from -PRON- grace and five year of bullying be not the stuff to make courage 
for a long time -PRON- wait 
then shake -PRON- get out of bed and walk down the stair in -PRON- cottonflannel nightdress 
fre ryder stand at the foot of the step 
well what do -PRON- want -PRON- little fool -PRON- demand 
-PRON- wet -PRON- lip try to speak -PRON- eye strain to see past -PRON- into the kitchen 
that damn hound of ainot go to root up any more land on this farm say fre ryder grimly 
-PRON- thin lip move in something like a smile for fertilizer now 
then -PRON- face darken 
-PRON- git back to bed or well use -PRON- for fertlizer too 
emmy get back 
-PRON- seem hour later that -PRON- hear a second shot 
-PRON- pull the patchwork up over -PRON- head and lie motionless 
the kitchen be empty when -PRON- creep downstairs to get breakfast 
then fre come in from the barn whistle and sit down at the table 
dan -PRON- whisper 
clear out -PRON- answer shortly 
an -PRON- clear out too 
as soon as -PRON- be go -PRON- thrust -PRON- thin arm into -PRON- dingy sheepskin coat and start run down the valley 
the ground be hard frost have come early this year and the wind be cold 
the brown stalk of the corn crackle as -PRON- brush against -PRON- and the lank scarecrow who guard the field seem to lean toward -PRON- leering 
in half an hour the entire town be in an uproar 
that state girl from ryder have come cry to old sheriff dillingham that fre ryder have murder -PRON- brother 
the valley road look like sunday morning alive with wagon and ford car and people all move swiftly more tensely than ever -PRON- move to worship 
fre ryder laugh at -PRON- 
-PRON- and dan have have a quarrel and dan have clear out 
-PRON- didnot know nor care where the fool have go 
good riddance say fre ryder and -PRON- eye rest with no emotion strong than contempt upon pale accuse face 
shot 
of course 
a man have a right to shoot a worthless hound hadnot -PRON- 
the quarrel have begin over that damn dog 
dan wouldnot have go away thout say goodbye to -PRON- say emmy in -PRON- thin voice brother look at -PRON- and snorted know dan be a fool but i didnot think -PRON- be that much o a fool 
someone laugh voice be scarcely audible flat and unaccented 
why have there be two shot shoot at the hound twice fre answer easily 
tense with excitement the man solemnly exhume the body of dog 
there be one bullet wound 
fre shrug 
-PRON- be no sharpshooter that be all 
-PRON- must have miss the second time 
as detective -PRON- be first class farmer say fre ryder 
two state policeman arrive on motorcycle 
the accuse murderer become jocular 
if -PRON- have kill -PRON- brother -PRON- suggest pleasantly there d probably be a corpse somewhere about 
-PRON- search until sundown the house the barn the ground 
the sear leave of the corn stock rustle ominously as man move among -PRON- and the drunken scarecrow witness if there have be a crime to the scene flap -PRON- strawstuffed sleeve in the wind as though -PRON- shake with dreadful laughter 
there be no body and the searcher look at emmy curiously have say goodbye to -PRON- if -PRON- would go away -PRON- repeat almost without emphasis 
the sheriff take fre ryd home with -PRON- that night and the search recommence in the morning 
-PRON- could not find dan ryder dead but -PRON- could not find -PRON- alive 
insistent tireless the girl emmy reiterate -PRON- statement dean go away thout sayin goodbye to -PRON- 
-PRON- canot hang a man emmy sheriff dillingham tell -PRON- 
when the victim may be walkin around on -PRON- own two leg 
on the third day emmy sit dryeye paler than ever watch the searcher 
one by one -PRON- be give up form a doubtful group about the sheriff dull eye close 
-PRON- mustnot give up 
once fred be release and back here unwatched cat come and rub against leg and the girl stroke -PRON- absently -PRON- eye on the man 
-PRON- mustnot stop search 
the cat be hungry 
as emmy move across the furrowed field toward the sheriff -PRON- follow -PRON- purr against -PRON- skirt weave in and out about -PRON- thin leg as -PRON- have use to do with dan 
the sheriff shake -PRON- head 
emmy there s nobody here 
the other nod 
dan would have say -PRON- begin again monotonously and suddenly -PRON- thin voice stop 
-PRON- dull eye become enormous in the withered corn a grotesque scarecrow stand before -PRON- -PRON- featureless face of bunch tight about -PRON- overstuffed body 
dan cat rub against -PRON- flap trouser purr loudly lift -PRON- up on -PRON- hind leg and arch -PRON- soft back 
the man look at stare eye and -PRON- blood go cold 
reluctantly the sheriff step forward and lift the ragged hat 
the packed straw slide down and the thing lurch sideways as the sheriff snatch away -PRON- trembling hand have say goodbye to -PRON- whisper emmy dully 
this be another example of where the author have open the story with interesting action reserve the historic description of character and situation until some paragraph later 
like this story also have a gruesome element which a great many people like perhaps because -PRON- enjoy be shock 
observe how this author have crowd a whole life story of one of -PRON- principal character into one interesting paragraph of less than fifty word and how -PRON- have jump from the present to the past and back again with no apparent break 
here -PRON- not only give a perfect description of the character but of -PRON- past as well while at the same time keep the action in the story move 
take a look at the second paragraph which be indent and observe how this young woman indulge in a bit of realistic but brief description which project perfect illusion for anyone who have ever walk through a corn field on a winter day 
-PRON- be the ability to observe and describe such apparently trivial thing as the rustling of corn stalk and the flapping of the strawstuffed sleeve of the scarecrow in the wind that differentiate the seasoned writer from the amateur 
a strong thread of suspense be maintain throughout in this story and the surprise climax be heighten by the simple introduction of a cat which lead to a gruesome discovery 
the ending of this story be on a par with the ending of that famous french story in which a sculptor conceal the body of the victim of -PRON- crime by cover -PRON- with plaster and mount -PRON- in an art gallery 
another outstanding feature in this story be the pathetic faith of the girl and -PRON- insistent moaning which be express in the last line 
the last of this series which i have select for illustration and comment be publish in on may and follow by houston day john addington close -PRON- eye 
the nurse with the curly hair be rub -PRON- face with vaseline 
then -PRON- cover -PRON- mouth and nose with a cone

drip 
drip

another dream 
-PRON- be at the office 
-PRON- know -PRON- have be right 
but the boss be insultingly emphatic in -PRON- criticism 
and if -PRON- donot like -PRON- -PRON- know what -PRON- can do 
-PRON- employer wear -PRON- familiar baggy suit but -PRON- face be that of bill walsh 
addington try to justify -PRON- for quitting as -PRON- ascend the step to -PRON- apartment 
-PRON- unlock the door 
and then again -PRON- see bill walsh 
-PRON- feel a different pain a stunning rend pain but -PRON- do not cry out 
how funny -PRON- look coat be hang over a chair 
there be revolver too 
-PRON- see -PRON- shoot 
-PRON- hardly recognize the pale angry face as -PRON- own screamed evelyn 
oh donot 
-PRON- should have keep quiet 
-PRON- turn the gun toward -PRON- and press the trigger 
then there be policeman 
-PRON- have fire 
-PRON- shoot back 
-PRON- couldnot feel -PRON- bullet 
except when -PRON- start to run 
then -PRON- stab sharply 
bill have say -PRON- have round heel 
-PRON- must have know 
-PRON- open -PRON- eye 
-PRON- feel deathly sick 
-PRON- god 
what a nightmare 
the curlyhaire nurse look like a friendly sympathetic little thing tell -PRON- about -PRON- 
-PRON- catch -PRON- eye 
-PRON- bend nearer 
-PRON- smile drunkenly 
the nurse look at -PRON- quizzically 
well -PRON- would have to know sooner or later so why not now while -PRON- sense be dull by the anaesthetic 
-PRON- do -PRON- say 
this author adopt a novel literary style by open -PRON- story in the operating room of a hospital and while -PRON- describe a scene that be tragically familiar to anyone who have ever witness or experience a surgical operation -PRON- intersperse retrospect which explain all that have go before without in the least slow up the story or interfere with the thread of suspense 
the result be that by the time one have reach the climax all kind of speculation be be indulge in there be one particular paragraph which i have indent in this story that strike one more forcibly than all other with the exception of the last line of course 
look at the condensed drama in that paragraph which end with the word drip 
drip 
drip 
-PRON- give -PRON- a chill every time i read -PRON- 
of all the shortshort story i have read i believe that there be more punch contain in four word in this one than any of -PRON- 
i refer to the last line which deal one a knock out blow and tell -PRON- that not all of the hallucination which john addington experience while under the anaesthetic be unreal and that -PRON- have murder -PRON- wife and -PRON- good friend while in a jealous rage 
thumbnail synopsis of publish shortshort story from and a study and analysis of the follow thumbnail synopsis of one hundred and twentyeight of the most outstanding shortshort story publish in and over a period of two year will enable the student to make some interesting conclusion 
besides this -PRON- give one a crosssectional idea of the type of story that seem to be the most popular
