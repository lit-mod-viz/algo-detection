Cook Is there anything crooked about the way got hold of that property, Silas inquired Bremerton quietly.
Not on your life! and expression became exceedingly virtuous.
I got the property at a bargain, of course, intending to turn it over to a syndicate. make handsomely if I can let go for half a million; but in order to "do that the bullion has got to come as it did a year ago, when I took over the proposition.
You go down there, Lee, and straighten things out.”
I wonot stand for anything offcolor, Deane.”
“Confound it, that’s why I want you!
You can forget more in a minute about mining and milling than any expert knows in a year. make it worth your while, old man.
You ought to get things coming our way inside of a month.
After that, keep up the good showing for six months and unload.”
What am I to get out of it—except a chance to go to the hospital, if lucky Oh, bosh!
When you grab hold, the gang will have the first real man to deal with that sent down there. hunt their holes, and you wonot have a mite of trouble.
I know you, or I wouldnot give you this chance.
Of course, Bremerton, you ainot so darned old, but I guess you sabe it’s getting pretty near time you took a start.
Eh?
Sure!
Now, look here. going to give you five hundred dollars a mdnth, and allow you six months to make that mine a winner.
How does that hit you That will amount to three thousand dollars,” observed Bremerton, provided I last for six months.” last, all right.
Thunder!
If you've got any white feathers concealed on your person, then it’s all happened in the last five years.
Time was when they called you Lee Reckless, and neither hell nor high-water threw a crimp into you.”
Bremerton stirred uneasily.
Reckless he had been called, but not justly.
Occasionally he had made the most of a desperate situation, but not without care—never recklessly.
If you want a reckless man, Deane,” he said, you donot want me.”
Come, now,” insisted the other, I guess I know who I want.
This is a man’s job, and you’re the man for it. never far wide of my trail when I size up a bunch of circumstances and pick a chap to handle ’em.
But if you donot want this chance—if you are not in need of money—” You know in need of money,” was the sharp response, and you know only waiting to grab at something in the way of a chance.
And that,” Bremerton added a trifle grimly, “is why afraid of I hope, for old friendship’s sake, you’re not trying to take advantage of my necessities.”
When you twang the sentimental string, old partner, you sure get me going! crowd a stranger to the his lookout whether or not his eye-teeth are cut—but the needs of an old friend will always hit me close to the heart.
Lee, wonot you see, canot you see, that trying to do something for you Why, you and me drank out of the same coffee-can years ago; and once, when I was nigh petered in the desert, you wrung the last drop from the canteen and gave it to me.
Say, do you imagine that all the money in the world could make me forget a few of those things?
Dash it! not so walled in with dollars that I canot break through to help a chap I think more of than I would of a blood-brother.”
Bremerton listened thoughtfully.
By turning a losing proposition into a winner he would help Deane to half a million.
Balanced against that was the three thousand dollars he was to receive for the risk and the trouble.
As though he had read his old friend’s thoughts, Deane leaned forward and dropped a confiding hand on his knee.
But five hundred a month,” he went on, isnot all willing to do for you. a bonus in the work.
Make a showing, help me to unload, and there’s a stake for you to tuck away in your jeans.
Maybe that wouldnot be a boost, eh?
Bremerton, it would start you on the way to Easy Street.”
Tell me more about the mine, Deane.”
Hanged if I do! down there, and you can see it for yourself.
Make a personal acquaintance w'ith it. give you a letter and a power of attorney; you can handle the proposition just as though you owned it.”
What is the name of the man who is now in the hospital Lacey—Gordon Lacey.”
I donot want to butt in and take his job away from him.”
Deane fell back in his chair with a choppy laugh.
From under a paperweight on his desk he took a yellow slip.
Read that,” said he. a telegram I got from Lacey the same day I wired you.
Oh, I guess you’re not taking anybody’s job away from him.”
The telegram was brief and to the point: Accept resignation.
I am done and probably done for.
Gordon Lacey. advance your first month’s pay, Bremerton,” said Deane as the telegram was quietly returned to him.
All right,” returned Bremerton. take the job.”
Hooray!
When will you start morning.
Now, then, tell me the name of the mine, just where find it, and give me any other particulars that will help me.”
For fifteen minutes the two were in close and earnest conversation; but, in the talk, Deane was strangely reticent about some things and full of detail regarding others.
When Bremerton left the office he had a check for five hundred dollars, the confident good wishes of Deane, and a vague idea that he was taking rather a desperate leap in the dark.
After all, it was that ten-thousanddollar stake that settled the question, so far as Lee Bremerton was concerned.
On his feet and in health, Gordon Lacey must have been a fine figure of a man.
With an eye keen for the architecture of bone and sinew, framing that mystery of the spirit which makes a human being worth while, Bremerton read the late superintendent of the Mariquita Mine for what he was.
Days in hospital, with strength ebbing and flowing about the misty Borderland, had pinched and whitened the face of the sick man.
Yet, close though he was to physical wreck, Lacey was superb.
It was nine in the evening when Bremerton came to him.
The young interne at the office desk was doubtful whether the patient could be seen.
With Lacey the danger-point was past, and he was mending, but up to that hour he had been denied to visitors.
Besides, it was too late for visitors, anyway.
Five minutes is all I ask with him,” pleaded Bremerton.
A nurse was called and sent to the ward.
She returned with the announcement that Lacey insisted on a brief interview with the man who was stepping into his shoes at the Mariquita.
So Bremerton went up, and the man in the white bed and his visitor exchanged looks and were straightway on friendly footing.
You may have just five minutes, Mr. Lacey,” said the nurse, glancing at the open-face watch on her breast.
Five minutes will do,” and the patient peered at Bremerton with a haggard smile.
What can you tell me that will be of help, Lacey?
Bremerton asked.
I donot want to tax your strength, and I should not have come at this hour if another would have served.
It was after seven when I reached Phoenix, and by sunrise to-morrow I shall be on my way into the hills.
In a few words give me the gist of the situation.”
What did Deane tell you?
A good deal, but nothing bearing on the real trouble.
With two superintendents dealt with as you and the other have been, in a mining district supposed to be peaceable and lawabiding, there’s a deep grievance somewhere.
What was it Deane left unsaid It is all a mystery to me, Bremerton.”
Lacey picked thoughtfully at the bedclothes with his gaunt, trembling fingers.
You took the job on plain say-so that everything was square Yes.”
So did I have had hard places before and got the whip-hand of them, but this work at the Mariquita came near being my finish.
When I first came I tried to fill out the gaps Deaneleft in his story.
He secured the mine from Carruthers, who at one time lived here.
I tried to locate Carruthers, but he had decamped rather suddenly, and no one knew where he could be found.
After I had been on the job a few days Mallory came and told me his side, and used threats.
I always look with suspicion upon a cause that is bolstered up with threats.
I was short enough with Mallory, and then I was downed with a cowardly shot from the brush.”
Who is Mallory Deane did not mention him.”
“Mallory bonded the mine from Carruthers, and failed to come across with the cash when the time limit expired.”
Ah! murmured Bremerton.
And what did Mallory tell you, Lacey No use going into that.
The old scoundrel will see you soon and tell you the same thing.
What I want you to know, what I want you to understand, is this: if ever you looked on the bright face of danger, and felt the ground opening beneath you and your feet slipping toward bottomless deeps, remember your peril when girl confronts you, as she surely will.”
A woman A faint smile crossed the strong, sun-browned face of Bremerton.
How is girl mixed up in this Sometimes I have thought she is the very soul of all the plot and counterplot which brought poor old Griggsby to his end and came so near getting me.”
Bewildered lines puckered around the sunken, gleaming eyes?
But I donot know; I donot know.
Angel or she-demon, I did not last long enough at the Mariquita to discover.
When she sfhiled I found my danger greatest.
She sent for me, told me she wanted to give me information of value, and in riding to meet her I was snared like a helpless rabbit.” voice quivered with earnestness as he added: As you value your life, Bremerton, beware of Mariquita Mallory!
Bremerton would have laughed; but out of respect for this strong spirit that had tried and failed, he kept the laugh in his throat.
A few women he had known, and all of the best, and he had yet to find one who could make a fool of him.
His one love was the silent great outdoors, where mountain and plain were ribbed with gold, his for the finding.
A woman could have no part in that.
I can see you think I am babbling like an idiot,” went on Lacey, still gravely and earnestly; “but if I could tell you nothing else, that one thing I want you to know: beware of Mariquita Mallory.
Mallory himself you can take in your two hands and deal with him as an honest man deals with a scoundrel; but a woman, a beautiful that is different.”
The nurse came toward the bed, her eyes on the watch.
I am afraid you must stop now,” said she.
Only five minutes, Dr. Preston said, Mr. Lacey.”
Just one thing more, Bremerton,” the sick man continued.
I had to leave King, the cyanid expert, in charge.
He is a capital cyanid expert, but a poor hand with men.
The quicker you reach the mine the better.”
He lifted and held out his hand.
Remember what I have told you about Mariquita Mallory. and good luck.”
Bremerton clasped the hand cordially and gratefully and left the ward.
Once clear of the hospital building he looked up at the round moon in the blue velvet sky, hesitated a second, then laid a course that carried him directly away from the hotel.
He was not a stranger in that town.
Two years before he had outfitted there for a prospecting trip into the Harqua Halas.
Now he wanted to get away by himself and think.
His word had been given to Deane, and he had taken money.
For better or for worse, he had plunged into this undertaking at the Mariquita Mine.
The key-note of his character was loyalty, and nothing could shake his determination to give to interests the best that was in him. words, however, had plunged him into a train of reflection none too pleasant.
His aimless feet brought him presently to the town ditch, where the waters rippled musically and the moonlight silvered the cottonwoods, and where from the soft recesses of the night came the notes of a whippoorwill.
Out of the dim past his memory constructed a similar scene.
He had gone into camp at.a water-hole; there were cottonwoods like those whose white trunks now rose around him, and then, as now, a whippoorwill sang in the distance.
But on that night, as he recalled, he Jhad been awakened by the cracking of a twig, and had fought in the moonlight with a roving Mexican who had tried to steal his burro and his grubpack.
Suddenly he paused, straightened erect, and listened.
As by the waterhole so long ago, here by the Phoenix town ditch he heard a stealthy footfall behind him.
Instinctively his hands clenched, and he braced himself for an encounter.
Another moment and the mood passed.
With a low laugh he leaned against the trunk of a tree.
Well, friend,” he called, are you following me, or does it just happen that you are on my trail?
The dark figure which his eyes had glimpsed came out of the shadow and into a splotch of moonlight.
A large man in a broad-brimmed hat stood out against the dusky background clear as a silver print.
The head was shaggy with hair and beard, and in the dark of the hat-brim two eyes glowed like points of flame.
My name’s Mallory,” said a husky voice, and been following you ever since you struck town.
Mr. Bremerton, ainot it So this was Mallory, appearing as Lacey had foretold, only somewhat before the time Bremerton had expected him.
Yes, this is Bremerton. like to inquire, Mallory, why you have favored me with your attention get to that,” was the answer as the speaker drew closer. just been to the hospital.
Picked out a comfortable place there against the time you’re ready for it Did Griggsby pick out a place If he did, what good did it do him?
He never lived to get to the hospital, did he I donot know about Griggsby, and I donot know who put Lacey where he is.
All I do know is that Deane will never get any good out of the Mariquita Mine, and those who try to help him will never get no good out of it, either.
Deane is a cutthroat, a pirate, a black-hearted swine who—” You are talking of a friend of mine, Mallory,” Bremerton interrupted sharply.
Friend A husky, jeering laugh came with the word.
A fine riend of yours, when he sends you into such a trap as that at the Mariquita. wonderin’ why so interested in your movements, Bremerton.
I got a reason. no sooner signed on with Deane than I knew of it.
A telegram from Denver was relayed to me in the hills.
I came to town, and have been waitin’ for you.
Since you got here I have trailed around after you, looking for a chance to give you a bit of advice.
Just out of kindness of heart, that’s all.”
Recalling remarks about Mallory, Bremerton observed in a tone of chilling finality: When I want your advice, Mallory, ask for it.”
No, you wonot,” the other returned. dropped into the little pit Deane has dug for you, and you donot even sabe that he’s ntuy malo.
I allow you think the villain in these here tragedies at the Mariquita, but you’re wrong.”
Mallory stepped still closer.
He put out a hand as though to lay it on arm, but Bremerton stepped back.
Now that Mallory was within arm’s reach of him, Bremerton could see that his beard and hair were iron gray, and that his face was old—old in ways of the world, perhaps, as well as in years.
“You act as if I was a rattler,” went on Mallory, and soundin’ a warning before I strike.
Man, you’re way wide of' your trail.
The warning giving you is for your own good.
There are others who will strike if you do not listen. young, Lee Bremerton.
Five hundred dollars a month for six months and ten thousand as a bonus if you make goodwhat are they?
Just a bait to lure you into the same fate that overtook Griggsbyl Leave the Mariquita Mine alone!
You can make nothing of it, and in the end it will wring you dry and toss your bones on the scrap-heap.”
“Clear out!” ordered Bremerton. have none of the threats you call advice and warning.”
The old man drew a deep sigh and, without a word, turned away.
He passed like a specter through the pool of moonlight and melted into the shadows beyond.
Scarcely had he vanished when footfalls reached ears.
Swift and catlike they came from either side and from behind.
Bremerton was a man who always stood his ground.
He squared himself now to meet what was to come.
Vague, shadowy shapes were closing in, gliding toward him swiftly from three different directions.
If that was There was no challenge, no parley.
Out from among the white-trunked cottonwoods hurried fantom shapes and in grim silence fell upon Bremerton.
One moment he saw them coming, and the next moment he was among them and fighting.
He had only his bare hands.
His assailants were armed with clubs; and one of them had a quirt, for its thongs fell stingingly over face and throat.
The hot blood leaped in the prospector’s veins.
These cowards four or five or half a dozen of them were upon him in a crowd with their whips and their bludgeons.
They were like a pack of wolves.
Outraging every principle of fair play, they would smother him under a weight of numbers and give him no chance for himself.
Circumstances like these were more than enough to arouse all the savage resentment rn nature.
In a flash he became the Lee Reckless of those old days with cornered wildcat—a cave man with his back to the wall—a fury, with all the seething elemental passions uppermost.
His foes were many, and he must take them one by one.
While he charged a single vague shape, he was forced to run a gantlet of blows that staggered and dazed him.
Yet one man crumpled under the weight of his fist, and as the ruffian groaned and pitched forward the prospector whirled and charged again.
Feet crunched and slipped in the gravelly soil; sharp, labored breathing rent the air in staccatolike notes, and over all rose the sodden thumps of the clubs.
Again and again the prospector wrenched himself clear of the press.
Perhaps not one blow in half a dozen reached him, for the gloom and the excitement sent many of them wild; but the bludgeons that found their mark had a cruelly crushing strength behind them.
While he drove before him another of his foes the rest hung upon his back and belabored him viciously.
Nothing kept him from his quarry.
At the edge of the town canal the retreating enemy was forced to make a stand.
Bremerton glimpsed the man’s swarthy, scowling face in the moonlight.
The fellow had raised a club for a telling blow.
Before the club could fall Bremerton grasped it and wrenched it away.
Almost simultaneously his hard fist darted at the shadowy face, and the man went over the brink of the canal and into the water with a splash.
Bremerton whirled, smashing right and left with the club.
Another man was struck and beaten to his knees.
The prospector trampled him roughly to get at his companions.
A stick aimed at head glanced and struck his right arm.
The arm fell limp and useless as though a bone had been snapped.
A sickening pain convulsed the prospector’s whole body, but he rallied magnificently.
He had lost his weapon. and fqr offense and defense he had now only his left hand.
Slowly his physical powers were failing, but his resolution grew as his strength diminished.
He sprang at another of his assailants, and just at the moment a pair of arms encircled his knees and he was thrown from his feet.
Then the pack closed in.
On his head, his shoulders, his back, rained the blows.
His left arm protected his face, but finally that arm, too, dropped away.
With a choking gasp he measured his length on. the ground, lying there helplessly while he fought to hold his fading senses.
The attack ceased.
Some one knelt beside him and whispered hoarsely in his ear: This is all for now; but go out to the Mariquita Mine and worse will follow.
Remember what—” The voice died out in ears.
A pall suddenly encompassed his faculties, and he neither heard nor realized anything more.
He drifted back to reason presently and found himself alone.
His head throbbed and his whole body rebelled when he attempted to move.
He ground h'is teeth to stifle a groan.
By degrees his brain cleared.
Mallory had threatened, and men had been handily by to make clear to him that the threats were to be taken seriously. had their chance at me,” muttered Bremerton hoarsely, and some day get my chance at them.”
He tried to lift himself to his knees, but the white stems of the cottonwoods danced mistily around him, and again he flattened out on the earth.
Water would revive him.
If he could get to the crawled in the direction of the ditch, digging into the ground with his fingers, and pulling and pushing himself on.
Pains, like daggers, stabbed him in a dozen places.
For all that, he found he could use his arms and legs, so it could not be that any bones were broken.
He was coming out of that one-sided battle much better than he had any reason to hope.
Although bruised and sore, he was not seriously injured.
For several minutes he lay at the edge of the canal, scooping up the water and splashing it over his face.
Little by little his strength returned.
The night wind whispered soothingly among the cottonwood leaves, and the song of the whippoorwill echoed from the peaceful shadows.
But what was this?
The bird, out yonder—what was it singing?
With a painful effort he lifted his bruised and battered body on one elbow and stared in the direction *of the misty alfalfa-fields. trickle from a flesh-wound on his forehead overflowed and blinded his eyes.
Removing a handkerchief from his pocket, he held it in the water and then passed it over his feverish face. a crazy fool! he mumbled.
What the whippoorwill said to the stars had long ago been established.
Only his disordered fancy could make .anything else out of it.
His wits surely had gone far afield to imagine the burden of those flutelike notes.
What under heaven had possessed him, sick and suffering as he was, to think of Mariquita in connection with that scrap of melody?
Mariquita!
Angel or did not know which.
Why, in that hour, was she in his thoughts?
Lacey had been riding to meet the girl when he was shot from the brush.
Very possibly, there by the town canal, she had inspired that clubbing of the man who was to take place.
Bremerton, sopping the blood from his face with the wet handkerchief, cursed the name and her who bore it.
At last he arose to a sitting posture, wrung the linen dry, and bound up his temples with it.
He was a rifle-shot from the main street of the town, and he must get back to his hotel.
A glow of electric lights hung in the sky, well beyond the shadows of the cottonwoods.
His eyes measured the distance between the canal and the farflung maze of the arcs and the incandescents.
For a man with two good legs under him, the way was not far; but for Bremerton, in his present condition, it was very far indeed, and perhaps impossible.
He tried to lift himself erect; but only half succeeded when he sank to the earth again.
As yet he had not mastered his aching nerves and muscles.
He could crawl, at least, if he could not walk.
On hands and knees, swaying uncertainly as he went, he made his slow passage toward the edge of the cottonwoods.
On the scene of his struggle with bravos his groping fingers encountered something which puzzled him.
The object was round, about the size of his fist, and tied up in a cloth.
At first he thought it a slung-shot, dropped by one of the miscreants who had worked their will with him.
He was curious enough, however, to grope in his pockets for a match, and then by its light to make a more thorough examination.
Yes, at a time when another would have thought only of his physical torments, Bremerton could give time and strength to trifles.
In prospecting for gold a thousand trifles, carefully weighed, might lead to a “strike.”
Years of prospecting had taught him the value of the little things, and he did not neglect them.
The cloth enclosing the round object proved to be a red cotton handkerchief, carefully tied.
He removed the cord, 'the folds of the handkerchief fell away, and a small globe of frosted silver lay revealed.
An exclamation of wonder escaped lips.
The silver ball was a sphere of amalgam-gold coated with quicksilver, just as taken from the plates of a mill and squeezed in a chamois skin.
The squeezing had driven off some of the quick and given the mass its spherical form.
Of course, the ball had been dropped by one of assailants.
It proved that at least one of the rascals was a mill man, or indirectly had something to do with a stamp-mill.
This in itself was no identification, as there were hundreds of such men in that part of the country.
With the aid of another match, Bremerton examined the ball more closely.
Its upper surface was a curious formation of small ridges where the folds of the chamois had been gathered together and strong pressure applied with the hands.
The lower half of the sphere was smooth, save for an indentation that resembled the letter Or was it an Bremerton scowled.
By some chance the Mallorys, father and daughter, were so vividly in his mind that he instinctively looked for them everywhere.
He growled over his folly, replaced the ball in the handkerchief, and stowed it away in a coat pocket.
Then he would have crawled on again had a sound not reached his ears and suggested caution.
It was a sound of horses’ hoofs approaching slowly from the direction of the road.
He could see the rider indistinctly, coming through the heavy shadows cast by the trees.
The horse moved to right and left, in a zigzag course, as though its rider were seeking something.
Bremerton wondered grimly whether he or the ball of amalgam was the object of the stranger’s quest.
Suddenly, while he knelt there, watching and waiting, the approaching rider passed a spot upon which the moonbeams had full play.
A gasp of amazement came from Bremerton.
The silvery light touched as with a caress the bare head of a woman.
The hair, shining and luxuriant, was brushed smoothly back from the temples.
In its strands the stem of a fullblown rose was entangled.
The woman’s face was dim, yet Bremerton could see enough of it to know that it must have been wondrously fair.
Her form was erect and graceful, and she was mounted in a man’s saddle and rode as a man would ride.
“If you happen to be looking for me,” called Bremerton grimly—“ this way.”
The girl started, peered in the direction from which the voice had come, and quickened the pace of her horse.
“If you happen to be Lee Bremerton,” said she in a voice at once soft and musical, then I am looking for you.”
He laughed huskily and jeeringly. am very much alive,” he returned, which is probably a great disappointment to Mariquita Mallory.”
The ill-natured remark seemed to make no impression upon her.
Drawing her horse to a stop, she dismounted calmly and stepped in front of Bremerton.
Bremerton knew this girl was Mariquita Mallory.
In his mind that conviction was as fixed as fate.
First had come her father, then her father’s men, and now why not the girl herself?
It seemed peculiarly fitting.
Not too close! he ordered sharply.
About where you are.will be near enough.”
Fear was a mental poison which his strong soul had never known.
Some day, when his brain was sick and he was physically broken, he might know it; but it would not be a woman who caused his heart to fail and his courage to wane.
He commanded the girl to keep her distance, because his whole nature was in hot revolt against her and her father and their schemes of violence.
She gave his words no attention.
Serenely she glided to a spot from which she could have reached forth and touched him, had she wished to do so.
Are you badly hurt, Mr. Bremerton?” she asked softly.
No,” he answered shortly.
It was cowardly to set a pack of hoodlums upon an unarmed man like that.”
I agree with you, and as soon as I heard of it I came here.
I want to help you, to be your friend.
May I have the chance?”
There was a wistfulness in her voice which did not escape him. warning still rang in his ears, however, and he thought she was playing a part —for purposes of her own.
Clear out,” he called roughly, and leave me to myself. all I ask of you.”
Are you able to get back to your hotel she persisted.
Yes.”
He staggered to his feet.
Swaying drunkenly, he was compelled to lay hold of a tree and support himself.
Madre mia,” the girl breathed, how you must have been beaten!
Oh, the fiends, the cowards!
She clasped her hands convulsively.
And you think—you think that I had a hand in this contemptible night’s work!
He could not see her face, there in the shadow, but her voice went through the phases of sympathy and indignation and reproach.
Her acting was superb. no guesswork,” said he sternly; all a matter of fact. a woman, and I donot want to forget that in my talking with you.
Will you go?
In a little while.
I canot leave you like this.
Are you still intending to go out to the Mariquita Mine, Mr. Bremerton If you and your father have any idea you can scare me, you will have to guess again. going to the mine, and get the goods on those who settled for Griggsby and sent Lacey to the hospital.
Tell your father that.
I suppose I have any more sand than Griggsby or Lacey, but tougher, and going to last long enough to do the work that brings me here.”
A breath like a sigh came from the dark, slender figure confronting Bremerton.
If you were not suffering,” said the girl, if I did not know you were in physical pain, I could tell you things which would make a change in your plans.
I think you are a man of courage, and the brave are usually just.
I can imagine that what you have heard about my father and me has not caused you to feel very friendly toward us; but donot be hasty.
Reserve judgment, Mr. Bremerton.”
A man who will trap another with a crowd of hoodlums, as your father trapped me, wants anything but justice.
If he had his deserts he would probably be in the Phoenix jail this minute; and, for all I know, you’d be there with him.
You canot handle me as you did Lacey, or“ Stop!
The word flashed at him daggerlike.
A temper the girl had carefully concealed up to that moment darted, keen and sharp, to the surface of her nature.
For an instant Bremerton was surprised, and then he reflected that his rough speaking had torn away the mask and given him a glimpse of the real Mariquita Mallory.
There was a throb of sorrow and undernote of grief shuddering through that blaze of anger, but it passed him. say something,” the girl went on in a stifled voice, that you may one day be sorry for.
I am here to help you—let me repeat that again.”
And let me repeat that I want none of your help.
While I am at the Mariquita, the less I see of your father and you the better.”
After a brief space Mariquita stepped to her horse and laid a hand on the bit.
Then she led the animal close to Bremerton.
Get into the saddle,” she said crisply, and ride to your hotel.
Leave the horse at the post in front, and I will either come after him myself or send for him.”
Her persistence irritated Bremerton.
You and your father are enemies of and so of mine,” he answered.
I donot intend to begin my work by placing myself under even a slight obligation to you.
Take your horse and go away.
I can shift for myself.”
She stepped back into the moonlight.
Her right hand lifted to the level of her eyes and a small revolver glimmered in her fingers.
Mount! she ordered.
This will settle the obligation business.
If necessary, I can force you to be sensible.
Mount and ride to your hotel, and leave the horse as I told you.”
The gleam in her eyes matched the silvery sheen of the leveled weapon.
Her erect, graceful figure, the moonbeams shimmering on her hair and on the rose in its thick coils, the beautiful face framed strongly in lights and shadows, and over all her dominant and resolute bearing, conspired to form a picture that stirred Bremerton strangely.
What a woman!
One moment soft and gentle and pleading, and the next moment fiery with determination and enforcing her commands at the muzzle of a revolver!
The novelty, the inconsistency of it all broke over him presently, and he laughed.
Nevertheless, he lifted a foot to the stirrup and climbed weakly into the saddle.
He rode away, leaving Mariquita there in the moonlight.
The last he saw of her, the revolver and the hand that held it swung at her side, and he fancied a smile wreathed her shadowy lips.
It was midnight when Bremerton dismounted in front of his hotel and walked unsteadily into the office.
The night clerk gasped and stared at him wonderingly.
His clothing was torn and earthstained and in disorder, and his face was puffed and bruised, and a reddened bandage was swathed about his forehead.
The key to seventeen,” said Bremerton, bracing himself at the counter.
Great guns! murmured the clerk.
What has happened to you He had not been on duty when Bremerton arrived, and he hastily ran his eye down the page of the open register.
I should think, Mr. Bremerton, that you need a doctor.
Let me help you up-stairs and then I will call a—” I can get up-stairs alone,” cut in Bremerton; and donot bother about a doctor. not in such bad shape as you seem to think.”
He took his key and started for the stairs.
In about five minutes,” he added, halting a moment, send up a boy with a pitcher of ice-water and some telegraph-blanks.”
“If you have been beaten up and robbed by thugs, we ought to get the police busy.”
I havenot been robbed.
Just had a little hard luck, that’s all; and I donot want the matter to go any further. a case of least said soonest mended.
Understand Certainly, Mr. Bremerton, but—” Bremerton waited for no more, but slowly ascended the stairs to his room.
He was weak and dizzy, and after he had snapped on the electric light he fell sprawling on the bed.
His aches and pains seemed to have been lost in a paralyzing nausea that filled his body.
Had he not been in the pink of physical condition, hardy and robust from years of wandering through the untracked wilderness, that beating must surely have been the death of him.
Breathing hard, and with every muscle relaxed, he lay on his back starirtg up at the ceiling.
The Mallorys had taken this method to frighten him away from the Mariquita Mine.
They little knew the temper of the man they were dealing with.
So far from intimidating him, his resolution to help Deane was merely strengthened.
For years he had breasted the blows of circumstance.
The more difficulties he encountered and conquered the greater his pride' in any success he might achieve.
Fear and discouragement were for weaklings.
And Lee Bremerton had never been a weakling.
Strangely enough, the events of the night brought him a certain measure of relief and satisfaction.
He had vaguely imagined, from reticence in certain matters, that some sharp practise lay back of the murderous enmity for men at the mine.
That Deane was none too scrupulous in forwarding his owh interests Bremerton understood thoroughly.
Those who resort to cudgels and a night attack are never the ones with a just cause behind them.
So, by implication, right to the Mariquita property had been proved.
This was what afforded the. prospector his relief and satisfaction. daughter was a good deal of a puzzle.
Certainly she was a splendid actress.
At first she had assumed a friendly attitude, hoping no doubt to deceive him, to win his confidence, and then to work upon his sympathies.
But he had angered her by a few words that emphasized his knowledge of her true character, arid she had burst into sudden flame like a powder magazine touched by a lighted match.
Sick as he was, he rather prided himself on having forced aside the mask for a glimpse of the real Mariquita Mallory.
Yet, in spite of his positive convictions, there was something about the girl that defied a complete understanding of her.
When I get over the effects of this clubbing,” he assured himself, be able to think to better purpose.
Lacey was undecided in his estimate of the girl, but told me to beware of her.
He appears to be a clear-headed sort of fellow, and I canot see why he was undecided.
My little experience with Mariquita Mallory has left me with no doubt at all.
Still, if I knew more—” A sensation hard to define overshadowed his conclusions.
It was a sensation that baffled analysis.
The mine was called the Mariquita.”
The name could scarcely be a coincidence.
Of course, the girl had inspired it.
Yet how and why, if this person, Carruthers, had originally located the property Had Carruthers known Mariquita Mallory?
Had he been so greatly impressed with her that he had given her name to his mine?
These were trifling thoughts.
As questions, they merely harassed a mind which was unequal to any sort of struggle with them.
A light, quick step sounded in the hall, accompanied by a musical tinkling of ice in a pitcher.
A knock fell on the door, and a boy entered the room with water, telegraph-blanks, and writing materials.
Wait,” said Bremerton.
His brain whirled as he rose from the bed and seated himself at a small table.
A drink of ice-water refreshed him somewhat, and he slowly wrote out the following message: Silas Deane.
Denver.
Arrived Phoenix this evening.
Work promises to be interesting.
Off for mine to-morrow.
Bremerton.
He gave telegram arid money to the boy and sent him away.
Then, as well as he was able, he looked after his injuries and went to bed.
A Not always, in real life, do names fit the characters of those who bear them.
As a case in point, Mortimer King, cyanid expert at the Mariquita Mine, was anything but regal, anything but manful and two-handed in his sway over men and affairs.
From A to he knew his cyanid work.
There were keenness and penetration in his mild, washed-out blue eyes.
From a glass of solution held up to the light he could almost determine by sight alone how many pounds of potassium cyanid should be thrown into the big vat to bring its contents up to “standard.”.
And there were those who said that, by merely glancing at a handful of tailings,” he would figure you their worth in ton lots to a cent.
But he was not even primer-wise in a knowledge of human nature, and he was a child in tact and diplomacy, and a mere babe in arms when it came to meeting a hard situation with judgment and energy.
Lacey had known this when leaving King in charge.
Racked with pain and half delirious when borne away from the Mariquita, he had been in no condition to pick and choose a successor pro tern.
Even so, he had yet had no second choice: Whatever his other shortcomings, King was the only man at the mine who, in the absence of the superintendent, would be loyal to Deane.
Two weeks Lacey had been gone.
They were weeks of mental distress for King, who realized fully his own incompetence.
If affairs had gone badly under Lacey, they nearly went to smash under King.
About all the cyathid expert hoped for was to hold the mine, organization together until the new man arrived to fill the place vacated by Lacey.
Troubles began almost before Lacey had been carried over the hill in the mine buckboard.
The miners struck for higher pay, although they were re- ceiving better wages than were being paid at any other mine in that district.
They struck, apparently, just to be contrary and worry Mortimer King.
With no mining going on, the orehaulers had to be laid off; with no drills to point, the blacksmith and his helper were out of a job; and with nothing to mill, the millmen were forced into idleness.
Then the spirit of unrest laid hold of the cyanid workers, and one by one they drifted away to loaf with the others.
King was at his wits’ end and telegraphed wildly to Deane. going to pot. the new man?
And to this Deane answered in characteristic vein: Keep your shirt on!
New man on the job Thursday morning.
King began counting the days until Thursday.
On Wednesday some unknown person smuggled a supply of red liquor into camp.
Steve Bryden, otherwise known as Big Steve,” began imbibing, and slowly and systematically working himself up to concert pitch.
He made an art of getting “in tune,” as he called it.
In twenty-four, thirty-six, or fortyeight hours, according to his own prearranged schedule, he would strike high Then, as King very well knew, the super pro tem would have difficulty keeping his scalp on, let alone his shirt.
The cyanid expert would have sent to Phoenix for the sheriff.
There was nobody to send, however, and he dared not leave the mine himself.
Wednesday night Big Steve got a sledge-hammer from the deserted blacksmith-shop and joyously broke all the windows in the bunk-house.
Just wanted to tease somebody, he explained when King ventured a feeble remonstrance.
The little devils in his drink-maddened brain were growing.
The Mexicans fled to their jacals and herded their wives and children behind closed doors.
The Americans and halfbloods moved their blankets to a dry wash and posted a guard.
Wun Sing, the cook, barricaded himself in the chuck shanty.
From the laboratory King, torn with conflicting emotions, watched the trail from and hoped against hope.
It was known that Big Steve had a dark past.
But he had not acquired it in his sober moments.
Not much of good could be said of him when his brain was clear, although in that state he was never openly lawless.
In drink, all his evil flew brazenly uppermost, and his black folly knew no bounds.
Barring King, the Americans at the Mariquita Mine were a poor lot.
Laborers of the better class would not work there, for the taking off of Griggsby had given the property a hard name. presence was a necessity.
He was the accredited agent of a Denver company that owned cyaniding rights, and King saw to it that royalties were paid from every clean-up.
Big Steve was not the worst of the Americans when sober, but he was far and away the worst of them when tuned.”
And from the others King could expect no aid.
He was thrown wholly upon his own resources; and these, as already observed, were weak and scattering.
Thursday morning Big Steve carried his pleasantries a little further.
Breaking down the door of the chuck shanty, he drove forth the luckless Wun Sing and chased him out of camp.
So, along with the mine; the mill, the blacksmith-shop, and the cyanid plant,” the chuck shanty went out of business.
King lived on sardines and crackers.
How the other Americans lived he did not know, nor care.
He had himself to worry about.
His naked eye could not reach far enough.
From the laboratory he was now scanning the trail with binoculars.
That was Thursday morning, and why did not the new superintedent come?
The sun passed the meridian and slowly descended upon a stricken camp. despair grew as the day faded and no one arrived to take over his responsibilities.
Reason told him .to flee under cover of that Thursday night and while there was yet time.
Duty warned him to remain, in spite of Big Steve and what Big Steve might do.
Yes, he would stay; he must stay.
But he wished he had something to shoot with.
The cyanid expert did not close his eyes between sunset and dawn.
At eight in the morning he crept cautiously toward the end of the pipe-line to renew his water supply.
Then Big Steve, rushing from the chuck-shanty and brandishing a blade which Wun Sing used for peeling potatoes, drove the unhappy expert pellmell in the direction of the headquarters adobe.
The office-door was locked.
King himself had secured it, and at that moment the key was in the laboratory.
White and shaking, the expert turned and flattened out against the adobe wall.
Yah! taunted Big Steve, pausing a dozen feet away and leering with his bloodshot eyes. you good for, say?
His voice was thick, but he kept his feet steadily.
His whole bearing was one of terrible menace.
“Clear out, you big brute!” answered King, shaking the tin waterbucket. you dare come nearer me with that knife!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
By George, report you for this!
It was a gallant effort to hold his own.
What it cost the little cyanid worker a man of more Spartan fiber could never know. got no more sand than a chipmunk! howled Big Steve. even an apology for a real man! plumb annoyed at having you around.
King, you little wart, here’s where you cash in.”
A line of heads rimmed the edge of the distant dry wash.
A swarthy, ragged, palpitating group watched proceedings from the Mexican quarter.
All knew that Big Steve had reached the climax of deviltry, that the grand finale was about to be staged, and that immediately following it his reign of terror would be overwhelmed by a period of sleep and helplessness.
But would he kill the little man with the water-bucket?
Not one of those who looked on from a distance would have given a copper cent for chances.
King, probably, would not have given much more himself.
Slowly, deliberately, Big Steve advanced upon his intended victim.
The millman’s face was puffy and splotched with red, a crazy glare filled his eyes, and as he moved onward he tucked up his right sleeve with his hairy left hand.
You King, there!
Run!
One of those at the edge of the dry wash offered the advice.
It was useless, however. nerves had buckled under the strain, and he was pinned to the adobe wall by the growing horror of his dilemma.
He was like a rabbit fascinated by the diamond eyes of a rattlesnake.
Approaching hoofs sounded suddenly from near at hand.
Neither King nor Big Steve seemed to hear them.
The trail into camp wound around the end of the office building, and a horse carrying a double burden presently emerged into view.
An erect figure in corduroys and laced kneeboots, face decorated with several small squares of court-plaster, occupied the saddle; at the cantle, astride the double war bags, sat the Chinaman Wun Sing.
One glance at the state of affairs by the headquarters adobe was enough for the Chinaman.
With a gurgling cry of fear he tumbled from the horse and fled to a safer distance.
At the dry wash and in the Mexican quarter a fresh interest was injected into the situation.
Here was a stranger, possibly the new man who was taking place.
He had no more than struck camp before being called upon to dispute with Big Steve the right to rule.
What would he do?
How would he conduct himself Intensely stirred by the progress of events, the Americans came out of the dry wash and advanced a few rods.
The Mexicans also took places for a nearer view.
For King the uncanny spell was broken.
A cry of relief broke from his lips, and he flung up his arms and crumpled weakly down on the office door-step.
Big Steve had withdrawn his attention from the cyanid expert and fastened jt upon the newcomer. the new boss, hey?” the niillman flung savagely at the rider.
I am,” was the crisp response.
Not so’s you can notice it! whooped Big Steve. been the boss here for three hull days, and the job pleases me a heap.
I donot share it with nobody.
Sabe that t'other way and say adios before I turn loose at you!
Clear out,” said Bremerton calmly. drunk.”
Not so drunk I canot fight.”
Big Steve waved the knife about his head.
None of the bosses last at the Mariquita!
Come over here, if you got the sand; come over here and git scalped.”
Bremerton flung the reins over his horse’s head, swung down from the saddle, and started toward Big Steve.
He neither hurried nor lagged.
He merely strolled in Big direction, unarmed apparently, and with his compelling gray eyes fixed unswervingly upon the face of the trouble-maker.
More than one of the spectators caught his breath and felt a chill of grisly foreboding.
King tried to shout a word of advice and warning, but his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth.
Big Steve had planted himself firmly on his stocky legs, and his right hand, with the short, ugly blade, was poised for a blow.
He stood like a man of stone while Bremerton drew close.
Then a most astounding thing happened.
Quick as chain-lightning, Bremerton gripped the upraised wrist and wrenched it downward and sidewise.
The knife fell from Big fingers, and, over the captured right arm, master and man looked into each other’s face. bind.”
Big Steve was accustomed to having his own way when his brain was befogged with liquor.
No doubt the surprise of finding some one who was not afraid of him had taken him aback for the moment and given Bremerton the advantage.
With a bellow of rage be wrenched his arm free.
Bremerton, kicked the knife toward King and stepped back warily. kill you for that! fumed Big Steve, running his words together in a way that made them almost unintelligible.
He was losing his steadiness, and he staggered as he rushed at Bremerton.
The latter moved to one side, thrust out a foot, and the millman stumbled over it and lurched headforemost to the ground.
He struck heavily, and his forehead came in contact with a stone which was half embedded in the gravelly soil.
A wheezy gasp escaped him, a tremor ran through his huge body, and he flung his arms wide and lay still.
Bremerton stared at him a moment in silent contempt.
Turning to King, he asked: Is this the fellow who chased the Chinaman out of camp?
Yes,” was the answer.
Big Steve has been on a tear ever since Wednesday.
Jove!
That was a nervy thing you did.
I wouldnot have been in your shoes for all the gold in Arizona.”
Who is he Amalgamator in the mill—one of the best amalgamators in the business.
He has his peculiarities, though.” no room here for a man of his stripe.
When he sleeps off that jag send him to me for his time.
Here, you!
Bremerton beckoned to the men near the dry wash.
I need some of you.”
They came forward with alacrity.
What they had just seen had inspired a certain amount of respect for the new superintendent.
Carry this man away,” ordered Bremerton.
One of you put out my horse and bring the riding gear to the affice.
One minute, first.”
He whirled and ran the man over with a sharp, appraising eye.
What were you doing over there while that big ruffian was trying to massacre the little fellow The men shifted about uneasily.
One of them finally spoke: Pilgrim, when Big in likker we-all makes it a p’int to hide out and! watch keerful.
Meddlin’ with Steve at them times is uncommon risky.”
Mean to say you were all scared?
Wall, now, I donot reckon say skeered. a mighty sight of diff’ence between being skeered and exercisin’ plain caution with a madman like Steve when he’s on the rampage.
I allow you plumb hypnotized him.” been drinking, too,” said Bremerton, quick to read the signs.
Hereafter, when any of you want to get drunk, you’ll do it in Phoenix, and not at the Mariquita Mine. taking place, understand?
While in charge there’ll be no whisky in camp.
Remove that man and look after my horse.”
On the jump.”
Bremerton pulled the saddle bags from behind the cantle and passed to the office-door.
King, anticipating a demand for the office key, had hurried to get it from the laboratory.
When things began to go wrong here; Mr. Bremerton,” he explained, I thought better lock up the office.”
You are Mortimer King Yes.”
The new superintendent stepped through the doorway into the square little room where the clerical work was carried on.
King had paused to watch three of the men pick up Big Steve.
Two or three articles dropped from the amalgamator’s coat while he was being lifted.
One was a bag of tobacco, another a flask, and still another ivas a square of dingy chamois skin.
Better gather up that stuff and take it along,” said King.
Hold on a minute,” interposed Bremerton.
He hurried out of the office and set his heek on the flask.
For a moment his eyes rested on the chamois skin.
An exclamation escaped him and he stooped and picked it up.
He stuffed the chamois skin into his pocket as he went back into the office.
Now, Mr. King,” said he, justr what is the situation here?
I found the Chinaman camping out at a waterhole between here and town.
He told me a little, but only enough to make me anxious for more.”
Bremerton sat down in front of the roll-top desk, took pipe and tobacco from his pockets, and prepared for a smoke.
King drew up a chair, sank into it, and composed his agitated nerves.
There was something about the new superintendent that inspired confidence.
Courage and determination are qualities which never fail to command the wholesome respect of enemies and the trust of friends.
As the weaker vessel, King deferred humbly to Bremerton, glad that Deane had secured such a man to captain the dubious fortunes of the mine.
A strong face shone lividly in the light of the match Bremerton trailed over the pipe-bowl.
Bruised, discolored, and with here and there a black patch, along with its grimness, the face contrived to reflect an amiable as well as a dauntless spirit.
Little Mortimer King warmed to the man and did not hesitate to confess his own failings.
I was a pretty poor stick for Lacey to leave in charge, Bremerton,” said he'.
I have no sense or sand in dealing with the near-desperadoes on this mine’s pay-roll.
The men knew it, and Lacey was hardly carried over the hill before they began to take advantage.” bear down on yourself, King,” returned Bremerton.
Sometimes the difficulties that are one man’s meat are another man’s poison.
A few in this world are equipped for one thing, and a few for some other thing.
The Master Potter fashions the clay from designs and patterns of His own.
It is not our business to go behind the returns and try to puzzle out the reason.
Go on and tell me about the situation here.”
King was surprised to find Bremerton as forceful in thought as well as in action.
He did not know of the lonely years Bremerton had spent in the wilds, communing with himself as he trod the unblazed trails, or guessing at the heart of things as he lay on a blanket looking up at the stars.
The cyanid expert began at the beginning.
He told of the strike among the miners, and how the failure of the ore supply had paralyzed all the other activities of the camp.
As an idle man is always ripe for trouble. report led up logically to the whisky-drinking and the cutting loose of Big Steve.
Bremerton listened quietly and, when King paused, remarked: a wonder you didnot cut and run.”
But I was left in charge! exclaimed the expert.
It was my business to stay here, no matter what happened.”
A quizzical light filled gray eyes, yet he nodded soberly.
I see.
When a man does his best there is nothing more to be said.
When did you have your last clean up at the mill Just after the miners quit work.
The millmen hung on for a while, and I kept them busy scraping the plates.”
How did the clean-up pan out Slim. always slim and not what it ought to be. what bothered Lacey and—and poor old Griggsby.
We mill ten tons of rock, working both shifts.
The ore-feeder throws out every tenth shovelful as the ore goes into the hoppers.
I quarter the samples down and get a value of twelve dollars and some odd cents to the ton—” No bonanza rock about that,” cut in Bremerton. been no bonanza rock milled since Deane took over the property.
If it’s here we havenot been able to find it.
The tailings, coming from the plates, assay something over two dollars to the ton.
The difference of about ten dollars a ton, or a hundred dollars for a twenty-four hour mill-run, should be left on the plates.
But it isnot there.”
The best we can show, the best we’ve ever been able to show since Deane secured this property, is seven hundred to a thousand dollars for every two weeks’ clean-up.”
Fifty dollars a day,” mused Bremerton not enough to pay expenses. being robbed.”
Griggsby thought so, and Lacey was of the same opinion.
But they couldnot prove anything.
The leak, wherever it is, has been too well covered.
You are right in saying we donot pay expenses with the mill.
The cyanid plant is just able to cover the shortage.
That, of course, doesnot leave anything for he’s not running a mine for the love of it.”
No, King, he doesnot do much of anything for the mere love of it,” Bremerton remarked dryly. go into all this later.
I havenot been myself for a couple of days, and the ride from town rather fagged me.
I think rest until after dinner.
Where do I bunk King got up and opened a door off the side of the room.
Here is where Griggsby and Lacey had their sleeping quarters,” said he.
“If you’d rather not sleep here, though, there’s a more comfortable place down at the laboratory.”
This will do.
Tell the miners to see me after the noon meal.” have them here—if they’ll come.”
The man that doesnot come hunts another job.
Impress that on them.”
King left the office.
As soon as he was gone, Bremerton got up, went to the table and removed, a handkerchief-wrapped package from one of the saddle-bags.
He unlocked the desk and pushed back the roll-top.
A litter of papers lay under his eyes, just as left by Lacey.
He brushed the papers aside, untied the handkerchief, seated himself, and leaned forward to examine the ball of amalgam. a clue, all right,” he muttered. a bit «f luck right at the start-off. see how that matches the mark on the mended chamois.”
The chamois skin dropped from the pocket of the unconscious Big Steve was an old one.
Almost in its very center a jagged, tear had been mended with needle and thread.
The sewing had been done by whipping the thread over and over along the edges of the tear, leaving an upraised surface.
This surface mark matched the indentation in the bottom of the amalgam ball perfectly.
It was evidence, indisputable evidence, that the mended chamois had been used in squeezing some of the quicksilver out of that particular lump of amalgam.
Circumstances pointed a damning finger at Big Steve.
They led also to interesting speculations regarding the finding of that stolen silver ball among the cottonwoods by the Phoenix town canal.
While Bremerton bent thoughtfully over the desk, a sheet of paper met his eye on top of the heap he had pushed aside.
Picking it out of the litter, he read the following, written in fine feminine chirography: Mr. Lacey: If you will come to me at the arroyo, at nine this evening, I will tell you something of great importance to yourself.
Trust me this once and you will not regret it.
Mariquita Maleory.
Bremerton dropped back in his chair, a savage exclamation on his lips. the note that lured Lacey into a trap! he murmured, and dropped it on the desk and struck it with his clenched fist.
A long, hard ride from Phoenix had almost worn him out.
He had spent the whole of the preceding day in bed, and every movement of his bruised limbs had brought him pain.
In the small hours of that Friday morning he had dressed, bargained at the nearest corral for a horse, and before sunrise had put miles behind him on the way to the Mariquita Mine.
At first his stubborn will had to goad his battered body into action.
As his ride progressed, however, his stiffened limbs and flagging muscles yielded with growing grace to the grim purpose that drove them.
His iron physique, dormant for a space, recuperated swiftly.
He was like a machine which, slow to start at first, presently yields to the spell of motion and runs with increasing ease and power.
Not until he entered the headquarters adobe had he been conscious of any feeling of fatigue.
He had dismissed King and planned to lie down for a brief rest.
But he could not leave the desk until he had tested the clue of the amalgam ball and the chamois skin; and now that brief note from the Mallory girl aroused feelings that made rest impossible.
He got to his feet, leaned against the top of the desk, and swept his eyes around the office.
There, in premises just taken over by him, Griggsby and Lacey had lived and and Lacey, the unfortunate men who had preceded him in the service of Deane.
The letter-files on the shelf, the map on the wall, the cabinet of ore specimens, the letter-press, the table in the center of the room, the picture of the martyred Garfield hanging near the door—all these trifling details of the room appealed to him strongly.
They constituted surroundings which Griggsby and Lacey had known to their sorrow.
A black memory was over everything and the Mallorys were the cause!
Bremerton, frowning darkly, swore to himself that he would bring home to the girl and her father the consequences of their deeds.
Making a winning proposition of the Mariquita Mine was but a part of his work; the other part was to make sure that Justice had her due.
For the killing of Griggsby, the wounding of Lacey, and the work of that cowardly gang by the Phoenix town ditch, some one should pay!
Bremerton passed to the open door and leaned there, looking out upon the camp.
The mine lay in a shallow valley bordered with bleak hills covered with cactus clumps.
The ramshackle structure housing the ten-stamp mill stood at the left, perched on the top of an incline of the valley floor.
Flanking the mill on one side were the cyanid tanks, and hard by the tanks was the shake-roofed, shake-sided laboratory building.
In the middle distance was the bunk-house, with its shattered windows.
To the right of the bunk-house stood the chuck-shanty.
Beyond Wun headquarters was a cleft in the valley wall, in which were huddled the jacals of the Mexicans.
Between mill and bunk-house were posted the derricks, with their whips, and the shaft-house, with its hoisting engine.
The whole valley was gouged and gophered and sprinkled with heaps of country rock.
The road from the shafts to the head of the mill had been powdered white by hoofs and wheels and gleamed in the sun like a trail of whitewash.
There was nothing alluring in the scene, nothing even picturesque.
The valley wore a forbidding, threatening look.
Like a long, black serpent, the pipe-line trailed past the Mexican quarter, coiled around the chuck-shanty, and reared an ugly, spouting head midway between the bunk-house and the headquarters adobe.
A branch of it crawled on to the cyanid tanks and the mill.
Silence brooded over the place.
The men from the dry wash were loafing about the bunk-house, and there was activity manifested among the Mexicans.
Big Steve had ceased to rule the camp, and the laborers were taking heart.
A new superintendent had come, and while he might not last long, yet his protecting arm was over the property for a time, at least.
And price for this junkheap,” muttered Bremerton, is half a million!
I am the connecting link between Deane and that money his last chance, his only hope for a big clean-up.
Well, we shall see.
If there’s anything better than ten-dollar rock here going to find it.”
He left the door, took an automatic revolver from one of the saddle-bags, and carried it with him into the sleeping-room.
There was a musty smell in the cramped quarters, and he raised a window.
Before lying down on the cot he placed the weapon handy by, on a chair.
With a sigh of relief he stretched himself out on the blankets of his creaking bed.
He relaxed every tired muscle, but he did not want to sleep, and his mind kept busy.
Mentally he catalogued the successive steps of the work before him.
First, the mine must be put in running order.
Next, the leak in the mill must be investigated.
Following that, he would learn why the property had been called a bonanza with only tendollar rock finding its way to the stamps.
A duty which might come first or last, or distribute itself over the entire process of rehabilitating the mine, was searching out the stealthy forces engaged in a death-grapple with' Deane.
To reorganize the workers and keep in motion the wheels of mining, milling, and cyaniding was the smallest part of problem.
Judgment and determination would take care of that.
Probing the thievery in the mill would not be so difficult, now that Bremerton had a reliable clue* Big Steve was not a man to be discharged, the superintendent now decided, but to be retained, kept at work, and watched.
He was the key to the missing amalgam.
With only a ten-stamp mill to grind out rock whose gross assay value was but little better than ten dollars to the ton, the Mariquita Mine could never approach the splendid proportions of a bonanza property.
Here there was something wrong.
Deane was altogether too smart a speculator to be hooked by a job of salt.
When he secured the mine he had certainly known what he was doing.
Nor would the Mallorys fight so savagely to keep Deane out of his rights if the object of that fight was such a poor-paying proposition as showed on its face.
They must know something, that old plotter and his girl.
Yet what was it they knew? one answer to this question was, a fabulously rich lead a lead known to the Mallorys, but lost to Griggsby and Lacey.
While Mallory had worked the mine under bond it had paid huge returns.
Those returns had captured the grasping fancies of Deane. men, however, had failed to make the mine pay anything more than running expenses.
The only explanation of such a state of affairs was a rich vein on the property, which had defied the efforts of Griggsby and Lacey to find it.
It was possible that suqh a vein might have been worked out and exhausted.
Disputing this theory was the fact that the Mallorys would not fight for a mine whose ore was hardly worth the trouble of digging and milling.
No, the Mallorys had an object in keeping up that struggle with Deane.
There was a reef of gold which, uncovered once, must be brought to light again.
As Big Steve was the key to the missing amalgam, so the Mallorys were a key to that lost lead. thoughts covered these various topics slowly and methodically.
He wanted to be sure of his ground as he mentally paced it off.
Two or three hours passed, and he finally became aware that his eyes were absently regarding a framed photograph on the adobe wall.
Absorbed in his reflections, he had looked at that picture without seeing it.
Now, abruptly, he recognized the original of the photograph, and sat up suddenly on the cot.
Another picture, framed among the cottonwoods and lighted with the moon’s beams, flashed out before him.
This picture on the wall was the same, even to the lustrous tresses with the full-blown rose tangled among them.
Getting to his feet, he walked around the foot of the cot and snatched the picture from the wall.
It was framed in cactus-wood, and he stared at it with hard eyes.
Had Griggsby placed it there?
Or Lacey?
He could not bring himself to think that either of his predecessors had been so foolish.
Very likely it was a souvenir of the days when Mallory was working the mine.
Griggsby and Lacey had merely left it hanging on the wall.
Bremerton muttered a fierce imprecation and drove his fist through the frame.
Twisting the cactus-wood apart, he flung the fragments out of the window.
Then he picked up the picture, tore it in pieces, and flung the scraps after the wreck of the frame. no room here for even a picture of she-demon,” said Bremerton with a scowl.
A fine souvenir for me to look at!
The eyes' of a wildcat!
Every glance of them would remind me of the note that lured Lacey into a trap!
Some one entered the outer room.
A shuffling footstep crossed the floor, halted, and a thin voice called: Missa Blemton!
He stepped out of the sleeping apartment and found Wun Sing holding a covered tray and smiling blandly.
What do you want, Sing? he asked.
Me blingee chuck.
Missa King tellee me you sick.
Plaps you likee eatee chuck in office, huh got it wrong. not sick. eat with the men, Sing.
Take the food back to the chuck-shanty.”
Wun face showed chagrin and disappointment.
He wavered a moment, then turned and shuffled toward the door.
Awri,” he remarked.
Ten minutes later Bremerton sat at the head of a long table in the chuckshanty.
At his right sat King.
Some twenty faces, not one of the sort to inspire confidence, ringed the table from King around to left.
Boys,” observed King a little doubtfully, this is Mr. Bremerton, the new superintendent.”
One or two ducked their heads.
A few more grufited.
The majority merely stared and said nothing at all. say anything if it hurts,” said Bremerton, with a quiet smile.
You may not be glad to see me, but donot do any guessing until we’re better acquainted.
It must be rather pleasant for you to have a hot meal after a day or two of living on scraps in the dry wash.
If you had helped King keep order in camp, Wun Sing might have remained on the job.”
These words seemed to startle some of the men.
A few exchanged glances, but others bent sullenly over their plates.
Are these miners and millmen, King? inquired Bremerton casually as he began eating.
Both,” was the reply; along with the blacksmith and a couple of orehaulers.
The rest of the men are keeping house in the Mexican quarter.”
The men ate like famished animals, but they cleaned their plates in a hurry and passed out of the shanty. wait outside for you, Bremerton,” confided King in a shivering whisper, miners and all.
I told them you wanted to see them.
If you donot raise their pay they’ll start a riot.” not raise their pay and they wonot start any riot.”
Bremerton picked up his hat from the floor beside his chair, got to his feet, and proceeded calmly through the door.
Filled with dire forebodings, the little cyanid expert arose and followed.
Bremerton realized very well that his first real fight was just ahead of him.
Every man at table had passed under his keen scrutiny and been mentally tagged.
So artfully was it done that the men themselves did not know it, nor even King.
Here was a tool, there a sneaking fomenter of discontent, yonder a weak character who ran with the biggest pack.
Two had the courage to be openly defiant, and but one of this pair was marked for a leader.
So Bremerton registered that tableful of workers.
On the swiftness and sureness of his judgment he based his plans for dealing with the strikers.
The men had formed themselves into a compact group a few yards from the door of the chuck-shanty.
Their number had been increased by the arrival of Mexican miners from the jacals, and quite a formidable’gathering awaited the new superintendent.
It had been the privilege of all these miners to see latest recruit in action.
They had been afforded a test of his mettle, and a wholesome regard for his powers had been engendered in their minds.
But there was a difference between Big Steve Bryden, charged with deviltry and aimlessly demoralizing the camp, and a crowd of underground workers who presented a solid front of opposition and were swayed by a common cause.
There was courage in numbers, and the miners were eager to see how Bremerton would meet this second test.
If he weakened, they would walk rough-shod over his feeble authority.
Bremerton had halted just outside the chuck-shanty door to fill and light his pipe.
It looked like an attempt at bravado, a bluff at hiding an attack of nerves, and some of the strikers laughed jeeringly.
King,” said Bremerton, who is the man with the rings in his ears That is Chombo Gonzales,” was the murmured response, half American and half Mexican. a foreman among the diggers, Bremerton, and a bad man to get stirred up.”
And who’s the one with the scar on his right cheek?”
Collins, Red Collins, another foreman.
Red is on the day shift and Chombo looks after the night men.”
Bremerton was positive that Chombo and Red were the two keys to that little difficulty.
If the two foremen were properly taken care of the trouble in the underground workings would quickly adjust itself.
The superinterident moved out toward the men. the reason your men are not getting put the ore, Collins?” he asked.
The red headed foreman felt flattered at being singled out in this way by Bremerton.
It gave him an importance which Chombo resented with an ugly flash of the eyes.
The boys think they ainot paid enough,” said Collins.
Three dollars a day for ten hours is what they get, and they demand four.”
“Why?”
Because we want it, that’s why! put in Chombo, jumping clear of the ranks and making it plain that he was to be considered in the discussion.
Bremerton turned on the half-blood and eyed him calmly. talking with Collins,” he remarked.
When ready to talk with you you’ll have a chance to relieve your mind.”
“You canot muzzle me!” cried Chombo. say what I please and when I please.”
Bremerton peered at him ominously for a moment, then swerved his gaze back to Collins.
How much are other mines in this district paying their miners he inquired.
Two and a half and three,” was the reply.
Then three dollars for ten hours is about the top price In other mines, yes, but it’s worth more to work at the Mariquita.”
I understand the Mariquita is the safest mine in the district, no shoring necessary, and quarters fairly comfortable.
Why it is worth" more to work here Because,” said Collins, the camp has a black name.
For one thing, too much shootin’, now and then, that’s liable to go wild; for another thing, Deane got it on a plain steal, and he ought to give up as much as can be gouged out o’ him.”
As for the shooting, Collins,” returned Bremerton, here to look out for that. no concern of yours nor of any of the others.
As for the way Deane got hold of the property, that is none of your business.
The miners are paid a good price for working here, and that’s enough.”
You canot crowd us with no such talk! shouted Chombo excitedly. have our rights or we’ll have nothing.
We—” give you your rights, Gonzales,” cut in Bremerton.
Come to the office in ten minutes and get your time.”
Chombo stared, his lean body crouching and his ugly little eyes blinking.
Por Dios!” he gritted.
“You canot fire me!
But I have,” asserted Bremerton. done your last stroke of work at the Mariquita Mine, and as soon as you’re paid off you will take yourself out of camp. not have a cur of your stripe hanging around here.”
Chombo had been fingering at the breast of his flannel shirt.
King suddenly uttered a cry of warning.
Quick as thought the right hand had executed a movement backward and forward, and from his tawny fingers had shot a bright gleam of steel.
Bremerton fell sidewise.
The gleam grazed his shoulder, flew on to the side of the chuck shanty, and struck and hung with a steady glitter.
It was a knife, blazing in the sun, and the point was embedded in the board wall.
The tragic silence that followed the knife-throwing lasted for a brief moment.
Bremerton righted himself, lifted a hand, and the stillness was broken by the sharp report of a revolver.
The sound faded into a cry of pain, and Chombo stood reeling on his feet, his left hand clasping his right arm and a trickle of red oozing from between his fingers.
“Try that again,” snapped Bremerton, and be more particular about my shooting.
King,” he added, take him to the office and pay him off, then watch while he gets a good start along the trail.
Collins, step over this way!
Chombo was cowed and had nothing to say.
The rest of the miners watched while King, trembling and distraught, moved toward the office with the half-blood staggering behind him.
The cyanid expert was expecting a clash in which Bremerton would get far and away the worst of it.
Bremerton, however, remembered how those men had kept to the dry wash and the Mexican quarter while Big Steve was on parade, and he knew they dared not resent his treatment of Chombo. .
The red-hajred Collins moved in direction, but he came humbly and obediently, as one who had just endured a shock and was slowly recovering his wits.
The superintendent led him aside.
How much are you getting as foreman, Collins inquired Bremerton.
Three and a half.”
The miners are getting every cent they are entitled to.
I guess you know this mine is barely paying expenses, and if the pay is raised all around I shall have to call on Deane to cover a shortage.” lookout, not ours.” my lookout, not Make no mistake on that score.
You are a man of influence, Collins.
I can see that.
If you tell these miners’ they’re getting the limit, they’ll believe you.
In your case willing to make an exception.
If you can get them back to work and keep them at work, from now on your wages will be five dollars a day.
You need not say anything about that if you donot want to.
This is the only concession I will make.
If those men donot begin getting out ore this afternoon, they can come for their time this evening.”
Greed showed in narrowing eyes. to have five a day, am he demanded.
Yes, so long as you keep the gang at work.” on, Bremerton, but keep it quiet. see that they go to work.”
Without paying any further attention to the strikers, the superintendent walked on to the office.
Chombo was moving off along the road, tying up his arm with a red cotton handkerchief as he went.
King, his face pale under its tan, stood in the office door.
Letting Chombo go,” said he, will raise the deuce among the Mexicans. a clannish lot, Bremerton.
I wish explained that to you before.”
Bremerton laughed softly as he pushed past the little cyanid man and dropped into the chair in front of the roll-top desk.
Would you put up with Chombo, after what happened, if you had been in my place? he asked.
Whatever have done would probably have been the wrong thing,” was the answer.
But it’s the devil’s own job, here at the Mariquita, to know what’s best to do in the pinches.”
It strikes me that the first step is to get rid of the trouble-makers. fired one and bribed another, all in the interests of peace.
The ore will begin to come, King.”
The men are going back to work Yes.”
Well, by gracious!
King was looking out of the door.
Collins seems to be arguing with the men, and they’re moving toward the shafthouse.
How did you do it, Bremerton I made it worth while for Collins to line up on our side.
The work must go on here.
After got better acquainted with the situation it may not be necessary to handle Collins with gloves. see about that later.
Start the cyanid gang at once.
If you have any further trouble with them, call me.”
King, taking fresh heart, left the headquarters adobe and started toward the tanks.
He found his own workers in a most receptive frame of mind.
Not one of them had any faultto find over the treatment of Chombo.
Later in the afternoon the teamsters were hauling ore to the platform at the head of the mill.
The stamps were pounding, and a batteryman was temporarily looking after Big part of the work.
Only a few hours had passed since the new superintendent had arrived at the demoralized camp, and already the work of mining and milling had been resumed, and the big vats were being loaded with tailings for another run.”
If Bremerton can only last,” King was saying to himself, we’ll do something here yet.”
The night shift took hold of the work in mine and mill, when the day crews left off, and Bremerton slept that night with the roar of the stamps filling the valley—ten 850-pound hammers, each falling at the rate of ninety-eight times to the minute, beating out gold for ultimate success with the Eastern syndicate.
Big Steve was sleeping off his spree in the bunk-house, the vengeful Chombo might be plotting somewhere in the hills, and the gang under leadership of the Mallorys was probably making ready for the next move.
None of these things bothered Bremerton.
It was his part to take his difficulties as they came, and deal with them as his judgment counseled at the moment.
He had made a good start and, for the present, that sufficed.
A Saturday and Sunday passed without bringing any fresh difficulties for the new superintendent.
The camp, which clung to that seared and blighted valley like a barnacle to the hulk of some weatherbeaten ship, resounded with the peaceful activities of mining and milling.
The distant hills were blue and serene, and gave not the slightest hint of harboring enemies who were eager to stalk and slay.
Bremerton settled comfortably into the routine of his work.
He came and went about the mining property with the perfect nonchalance of one to whom fear and worry are unknown.
Bart Case, otherwise known as Smear,” one of the ore-haulers, remarked upon the super’s calmness and apparent ease of mind.
He addressed himself to Dutch Fred, the other teamster.
The fool ainot got sense enough to know he’s a marked man, Dutch.”
“Vat I care?” was the passiveresponse. a goner in two weeks, I bet you.” you bet I donot care nuther, but it’ll be plumb interestin’ to bet and then watch for what happens.
Lay you a dozen bags o’ smokin’ he’s still on the job come two weeks Saturday.”
I donot get smoking much easier as dot, Smear. a go.”
In this manner tenure of life become a gamble among the men.
But Smear was unjust.
The superintendent was not a fool.
He understood thoroughly that he was gambling with fate.
The stake was large, however, and he was cheerfully taking a gambler’s chance.
Monday morning two events came to pass.
One Bremerton was expecting.
The other was a surprise.
Directly after breakfast, Big Steve, hollow-eyed, his cheeks flabby and of a sickly yellow tinge, tramped heavily into the office and ranged himself alongside the desk.
He emitted a rasping cough by way of claiming the superintendent’s attention.
Bremerton was studying a penciled map of the Mariquita property.
He did not look up until Big Steve had brought a hamlike fist smasing down on the desk top.
Think going to wait here all ’day?” demanded the amalgamator. after my time.”
Bermerton sat back and regarded the huge form fixedly.
Oh, it’s you, is it? he asked.
Yes, it’s me, and here for my money.”
Going to quit The flabby jaw fell open and the sunken eyes stared. that what you said demanded Big Steve. you tell the boys to break it to me that I was fired?”
I believe I did, but changed my mind.
Bryden, we heed an amalgamator. merely assess you for the bunk-house windows and keep you on if you’ve a mind to stay.”
Big Steve drdw his' thick fingers across his head, in a puzzled way; then, thinking Bremerton was afraid to discharge him, he laughed craftily.
Oh, stay, but I donot pay for no bunk-house windows.” only fair that you pay for them, but not insist.
Go up to the mill.”
The amalgamator tramped out a little more heavily than he had tramped in.
The new boss was afraid to give him his walking papers!
He looked back at the door and chuckled in his hairy throat.
Some time he’d have another chance at Bremerton, and they’d see which of ’em could run that camp.
He was pawing the bruise on his temple and still chuckling as he walked to the head of the mill.
King, little as he knew about the management of men, thought that Bremerton had made a grave mistake.
At any cost, Bryden should have been made to go.
Among themselves the men wondered.
Most of them came to the same conclusion as Big Steve and thought that Bremerton was afraid to get rid of the amalgamator.
Others, who remembered Chombo and the way Bryden had been manhandled at the climax of his lawlessness, could not accept the easier conclusion and were at a loss to understand the queer move.
The superintendent was well content to let the matter rest as it was, so long as his real reason for keeping Bryden in the mill was not known.
He was also chuckling over the incident when a beat of approaching hoofs drew his eyes to a near-by window.
From the rim of the valley a rider was advancing along the trail.
The rider was a woman.
She sat her horse manwise, and her graceful figure, swayed rhythmically as she galloped. face hardened.
Talk about nerve! he muttered.
I told her to keep away from me, yet here she comes.
Well,” he added grimly, when she’s done with this visit she’ll never make another.”
He started to rise, preparatory to leaving the office and meeting the girl outside.
Something held him to his chair, however, and glued his eyes to the window.
Mariquita Mallory presented a picture, beautiful by contrast with that seared and blasted valley.
It was not that she rode with skill and grace.
It was the girl herself that added a touch to the ugly environment—a softening, exquisite touch which caught and held eyes in spite of him.
There was a place in the Mogollons where the sun sets as nowhere else in the whole world.
He had camped on the spot for a week just to see the flaming ball go down, watch the crimson and gold fade and then feast his eyes on the purple afterglow.
It was a far cry from the Mogollons to the Bitter Root range in Montana, and yet Bremerton knew of a height in the Bitter Roots where the sun never rose as it rose there.
In the Southwest the brazen shield pops upward from the desert’s rim as though flung abruptly from a mighty hand.
One moment it is dawn, and the next, day.
But over that height in the Bitter Roots it comes slowly, flinging out streamers that grow and grow until the whole east is filled with orange and yellow, and the faint western stars are blotted out one by one.
Bremerton had a soul for the finer things of life.
He saw beauty where others would pass it by.
With the eye of an artist he watched that free, galloping figure.
The girl wore a broad-brimmed hat.
Her costume was mannish in other ways, and yet, oddly enough, there was that about her which made it feminine to the last degree.
Bremerton was still staring as she drew close.
Their eyes met through the dusty window.
She smiled and waved a gauntleted hand.
His face grew stony with the dark thoughts that suddenly surged within him.
He did not get up and leave the headquarters adobe to meet her.
Whirling the chair to face the door, he watched while she dropped the reins, dismounted lightly and stepped across his threshold.
Good morning,' Mr. Bremerton,” she said, still smiling.
He noted the clear, soft, brown face, the comely roundness of the cheek, the arch of the throat, the Castilian languor of the big, dark eyes.
Moonlight has a magic of its own, but it could not add to the charms of Mariquita Mallory.
There, in broad day, she was infinitely more attractive than when Bremerton had seen her among the cottonwoods.
“Why donot you say something?” queried the silvery voice.
“Am I welcome, or am I not?
Like dagger thrusts the words of Lacey pierced brain.
When she smiled I found my danger greatest!
And Mariquita Mallory was smiling.
I told you,” said Bremerton, to keep away from me.”
You couldnot have meant it though,” she laughed, not really.”
She dropped her- head on one side and looked at him critically. in much better shape than when I say you last. you glad I made you take Silverheels and ride to the hotel?
And you’ve never said gracias.
Perhaps come to give you the chance to say that.”
“Then I thank you for something which I do not look upon as an obligation,” he returned.
That is gratitude with a string tied to it.”
She laughed.
But no matter.
When we’re better acquainted, Mr. Bremerton, I think you’re going to like me.
I donot mind saying that rather predisposed ia your favor already.
I know what you hare done here—how you clipped the spurs of Big Steve and winged Chombo. made a very good beginning, Mr. Bremerton.
Are you willing to listen to me?
If you’re going to say anything against Deane—” The black eyes kindled, the smile faded and left the lips stern.
I am—just that,” she cut in.
Then I am not going to listen to you.”
He got slowly out of his chair, and approached her.
Miss Mallory,” he went on, you are a woman, a very beautiful woman, and you are not going to make me forget that I am a man and fighting a man’s fight.
It is a fight that I shall win.
You and your father are enemies.
I have reason to believe that you fight friends from cover, with a reckless disregard of life and consequences.
But you and your father are not going to stand in my way.
Take my advice and leave this part of the country before I bring home to you something which will call for a penalty.
Save yourselves while there is time.”
There was interest in her eyes and she did net seem displeased.
You are taking the wrong trail,” she returned earnestly.
I can explain that to you, if you will let me.
You cannot afford to make a mistake, Mr. mistake so hideous and far-reaching as this of yours is bound to be.
Let me tell you—” “Not a word.
Miss Mallory, you must know I could not believe you.”
You have been talking with Mr. Lacey?
Naturally I saw him as soon as I could after reaching Phoenix.
That is no secret to you or your father.
I was spied upon from the moment I left the train.
Otherwise, that gang of hoodlums would not have been ready for me.”
His voice was tinged with bitterness.
She stepped back and her eyes began to glow again.
I have told you we had nothing to do with that villainous attack upon you! she cried.
He waved his hand I have a fair amount of r«aso» and judgment,” he replied, and you had best give me credit for that right from the beginning.”
Deane will never be able to accomplish anything here,” she declared sharply, no matter who takes up the work for him.
I should hate to see you go the way Griggsby went or suffer as Lacey has suffered.
I want to help you!
Then keep hands off.
Call away your gang.
By doing that, you will not only help me but help yourself a good deal more.”
“We want peace, but not at that price.
If it is to be war between you and my father and me, it is war of your own bringing.”
Call it what you will, I am here to serve Deane.”
Then you are serving a scoundrel she flamed.
With a superb, dramatic gesture, she pulled the gauntlet from her left hand and flung it down in front of him.
You will bring that back to me on your knees before you are done with the Mallorys! she cried, and whirled and ran from the office.
He picked up the glove curiously, wonderingly, while the beat of her horse’s hoofs died swiftly away along the trail that led out of the valley.
“Actress,” muttered Bremerton“ actress to the core!
He threw the small glove upon the table with an angry gesture.
So I am to take that back' to her on my knees, am I He pictured himself crawling at the feet of Mariquita Mallory and humbly lifting that gage of battle which she had flung at him.
A grim smile curled his lips.
I wonder if she takes me for a coward or a sentimental fool He felt as though he had just come off the stage after taking part in a scene from a melodrama.
His annoyance was keen, and he was surprised a moment later to find himself beside the table and again holding _the glove in his hands.
The girl was two-faced; in his own mind there could be no doubt about that.
And yet there was something undeniably attractive about her, something winsome, appealing.
He would have given a month’s pay to hear the truth in the matter of deal for the Mariquita Mine.
But from what unprejudiced source was the truth to come?
Certainly not from the girl.
Lacey had found her mosli dangerous when she smiled.”
Bremer^ ton ground out an exclamation and crushed the glove in his strong fingers.; Unlocking a drawer of the desk he dropped Miss property into it, along with the ball of amalgam and the mended chamois skin, and turned the key on the collection.
The gleaming ball reminded him that he had work to do, and he left the office and mounted the low incline that led to the mill.
A man on the ore platform was shoveling rock into the crusher.
The superintendent picked up a piece at random and examined it.
It was fairly good ore, but not the kind that would make the Mariquita worth half a million dollars.
He tossed the sample into the hopper and climbed through an opening in the rough board wall and descended three or four steps to the ore loft.
The stamp-stems of the two batteries were lifting and falling with a force that shook the old mill in every part.
The uproar was deafening, so close at hand.
The crusherman was also the ore-feeder, and while he was busy on the platform outside Bremerton had the ore-loft to himself.
Making his way between the batteries of dancing stamp-stems, he halted at the edge of the loft and looked down into the body of the mill.
Directly beneath him were the millplates, covered with a thin sheet of flowing water.
The water was stained with the powdered ore, washed away from the stamps and carried through the battery screen to the plates.'
The quicksilver on the plates captured the gold from the muddy tide and held it fast.
For one reason or another, a small quantity of the yellow metal would not catch,” and the water carried it out of the mill and away to the tailings piles.
Giles, the batteryman, sat in the aisle between the plates, keeping a vigilant eye upon the boxes, and smoking as he watched.
At the rear of the mill Big Steve leaned against a bench, tying a fresh cloth over the wide mouth of a bottle of quick.”
Through the door leading into the engine room Bremerton could see the engineer who was his own fireman —heaving crooked lengths of mesquit and palo-verde into the fire-box.
It was a scene of peaceful activity, and offered not the slightest hint of dishonest motives on the part of any of the workers.
And yet, if there was a leak,” and if through it amalgam was dribbling away from Deane, then more than one man in that mill had a hand in the plot.
Bremerton became suddenly aware that Big Steve had finished tinkering with the bottle of quicksilver and was looking upward at the edge of the ore-loft.
A complacent, slightly contemptuous grin creased the flabby face of the amalgamator.
Bremerton met the uplifted glance quietly, and Big Steve dropped his eyes and shouted something to Giles.
The batteryman bounded up the steps to the loft and began hanging up” the stamps.
One by one, with a piece of board, he lifted each stamp in one of the batteries and left it hanging and idle.
There is a knack in the work, and Giles proved his efficiency by doing it deftly and quickly.
The roar of the mill was now decreased by half, and Bremerton was able to compliment Giles without shouting at the top of his voice.
Giles was minus an eye, but the eye that was left gleamed with pride as he listened to the approval of the new superintendent.
If Big Steve had a confederate, Bremerton was sure it could not be Giles.
He had not the air of a man with a guilty conscience.
If there was any fault to be found with Giles, it ’was because he could not see as much crookedness with one eye as he might have seen with his normal equipment.
Bremerton descended a flight of narrow stairs to the body of the mill.
Big Steve was just coming out from under the ore-loft, where he had been turning the water off from the battery.
He pulled a stubby whisk-broom from his pocket and stepped to the side of the plate.
Looking over the mill?” he asked of Bremerton casually.
Bremerton nodded.
Big Steve began passing the broom over the plate in wide, vigorous circles.
The amalgam ridged and loosened under the sweeping splints.
Big Steve laid aside the broom and took a square of rubber from his coat.
Cleaning up a little asked the new superintendent pleasantly.
Got to,” was the reply. stick.
Liable to shuff off and ride out with the tailings in chunks.”
Bremerton knew better.
The amalgam was safe enough and there was no need of removing any from* the plate.
Big Steve was lying.
This was part of his method in lifting” gold.
He pushed the rubber across and across the plate, molded two balls of amalgam in his hands and laid them aside oh a piece of chamois skin.
After that he scattered quicksilver from the bottle upon the plate, dressed the plate down with the broom, called to Giles to start the stamps again and went into the little amalgamator’s room off the side of the mill.
Bremerton followed and watched.
Big Steve, by manner rather than words, seemed to consider his presence an intrusion.
How many times a day do you make this partial clean-up, Bryden the superintendent asked.
Four.”
The amalgamator was gathering a ball up in the chamois.
His big fists clamped down on it tight and the quick oozed through the skin and dropped into a bowl.
Two balls each time?
Big Steve removed the first ball, laid it on a shelf behind him, and then began squeezing the second ball.
Working at the amalgamator’s back, Bremerton drew a knife from his pocket, opened the blade and, with its point, made a cross on the lower surface of the first ball of amalgam.
The maneuver was entirely lost on Big Steve.
I donot reckon we’ll get two balls every partial clean-up this run,” said the amalgamator suddenly, as though his heavy wits had been struggling with question and his own answer. purty low-grade, compared with what it is usually.”
Bremerton strolled out of the little room, across the body of the mill, through the engineer’s quarters and around to where King was working at the cyanid tanks.
What does Bryden do with the amalgam he takes from the plates during the day, King?
Bremerton inquired.
Turns it-over to me when he knocks off work in the afternoon,” was the reply.
Night amalgamator does the same thing in the morning.
Why?”
‘‘Oh, nothing! just getting the run of the details.
After supper, this evening, bring amalgam to the office.”
The little expert’s eyes widened.
You donot think for a minute that Big Steve—” he began, but the superintendent cut him short. bother about what I think, King.
Whatever it is, be sure it is nothing to your discredit.
Just bring up the amalgam this evening—and keep the matter quiet.”
Bremerton went back to the office and resumed his study of the Mariquita property as outlined on the map. holdings comprised several claims, all known by the one general name, and completely filled the little valley and lapped over upon the hills that bordered it.
Where was the bonanza ledge, the golden reef which had dazzled Deane while the mine was in the hands of Mallory or Carruthers?
Bremerton could have sworn that it was somewhere under that scoriated valley, and just as surely as it was there so surely would he one day discover it.
For the rest of the morning and all the afternoon he smoked and reflected, the map under his eyes.
His next step was to go over the property foot by foot and endeavor to locate the lost vein.
Next day he would begin.
Following supper, and after the day men had retired to their quarters and the night men had gone into mine and mill for their work, King came with a canvas bag and rolled four balls of amalgam out upon the office table.
Is that all Big Steve turned in Bremerton inquired.
Certainly,” replied King with a pained look.
I hope, Bremerton, you donot think hold out anything on you?”
Bosh! not your trail on.
How does the ore now running through the mill compare in value with the ore of the last run It is almost identically the same, so far as value is concerned.”
“And the amount milled is the same Yes.”
Bryden says it is his practise to have a partial clean-up four times during his shift, and that generally he gets two balls of amalgam from each plate every time he takes the stuff off.
According to that, there should be sixteen balls of amalgam in this lot.
Where are the other twelve King appeared astounded.
He never turns in any more than this, Bremerton.
Probably Big Steve is a bit hazy, yet, and didnot realize what he was saying.
Or you may have misunderstood him.”
He was sober enough and I didnot misunderstand him.”
Bremerton looked at the balls.
The one he had marked was not among them.
Well,” he added presently, of all the brazen stealing I ever heard of, this is the limit.”
He leaned back in his chair, peered into startled face and laughed.
What was the matter with Griggsby and Lacey that they did not find the leak in the mill? he went on.
It is so confoundedly simple that a blind man could locate it.” not blind,” parried King.
It got past me, Bremerton.
And Griggsby and Lacey worried their heads off about the failure of the clean-ups to tally with my assay figures.”
Take the amalgam back and put it in the laboratory safe, King,” said the superintendent quietly. explain matters to you later on.
I know why the bullion doesnot tally with your assays of the mill-run, but there are a few other things I donot know and which I must find out as quickly as possible.
Keep your own counsel'. get to the bottom of this, and something will drop, and drop hard, before many days. a wonder, by glory, that this mine is doing as well as it is, everything considered.”
King toqk his bag of amalgam and went back to the laboratory.
He was sorely puzzled and half-inclined to doubt statement regarding the discovery of the leak.”
Of Griggsby, Bremerton knew little, but for Lacey, Bremerton cherished the respect which one man of resolution and ability will always feel for another of his kind.
A square look was all Bremerton had needed to get measure.
And how had it been possible for Big Steve, so clumsy and barefaced in his thieving, to pull the wool over eyes?
The deeps of human nature are a tangle of mystery.
Why or wherein Lacey had failed, or what he might ultimately have accomplished had he been left to go on with his work, Bremerton could not pretend to guess.
But this matter of Big Steve and the missing amalgam had yielded so readily to investigation that the blindness of predecessors especially of a thing for wonder.
Bremerton reflected that his very first day at the mine had given him a clue.
That clue had infallibly involved Bryden.
This advantage, however, did not tell the whole story of and carelessness or incompetence.
It may be,” thought Bremerton, that Big Steve worked differently when Lacey was in charge.
The truth may come out sometime.
I canot believe that Lacey was so gullible as the developments seem to indicate.”
He need not bother about Lacey.
It was his own battle and not he was fighting.
There was work to be done that night.
Closing and locking the desk, he got up and walked into his sleeping room.
When he came out into the main office he had the automatic pistol in his hand.
He examined the weapon for a moment under the light, then dropped it into his pocket.
With a whiff down the lamp chimney he filled the room with darkness.
A moment later he passed through the door and turned the key in the lock behind him.
Moving on the bunkhouse through the gloom, he took up a position behind a heap of stones—a position from which he could watch the quarters of the sleeping day-shift.
He wanted to be at the mill so that he .might test the night amalgamator as he had tested Big Steve.
That part of his plans would have to wait, for the present.
It was Big trail he was following, and he must run it out.
There was no one abroad in the camp it that hour.
The night men in the mill and in the underground workings had no cause to leave their posts.
The blacksmith had pointed a supply of drills for those in the levels and stopes, and the teamsters had heaped the ore platform with plenty of rock for the stamps.
Those of the camp who were not on duty slept while the mill roared and the ore gathered at the bottoms of the shafts.
Bremerton ran no risk of discovery.
Such risks as there were would come later, if the superintendent’s vague hopes were realized.
Big Steve, sure of himself and careless in his villainy, was still the peg upon which Bremerton hung his plans.
Where had Bryden put those twelve balls of amalgam?
Even he would realize the danger of secreting them in the bunk house.
He would not let the night pass—so the superintendent reasoned without clearing away the evidence of his crookedness.
The time dragged slowly.
A lessened clamor from the mill suggested the hanging up of a battery and the removal of amalgam from the plates.
The night amalgamator was cutting his cloth according to Big pattern, and all to the financial loss of Deane.
The Mariquita Mine, it seemed, was being assailed from without and within.
The Mallorys and their gang were not sole enemies.
There were traitors in camp with whom there must be a reckoning before a search-light could be turned on the methods of the Mallorys.
All in good time,” muttered Bremerton grimly, and meanwhile one thing at a time.”
The old mill, crashing and clanging, gleaming yellow through every crack in the rough walls and pouring its smoke straight toward the stars, was a weird and fascinating object.
It crouched on the crest of its little hill like some sulky, misshapen devil, growling as it gnashed at the ore and wheezing as it spewed the thick fog out of the tall, black stack.
Bremerton was oddly attracted by that ramshackle structure, flaming and howling in the night.
His eyes shifted from the mill to the bunk-house and back again almost continually.
Perhaps he had been at the rock heap two hours, perhaps three, when a moving blot emerged from the bunk-house shadows and glided toward the trail that led out of the valley.
Bremerton chuckled.
His vague hopes were being realized.
As the shadowy blur lost itself behind the headquarters adobe and reappeared in the starlight beyond, he left his hiding place and cautiously followed.
Once clear of the ruck of the camp the form from the bunk house was thrown into clearer prominence.
It was the form of a large Steve without a doubt—bearing a sack over his shoulder.
The amalgamator followed the trail.
Bremerton, more circumspect, dodged from one clump of greasewood to another at the trailside.
At the top of the rise to the south, Big Steve turned directly out of the road and moved westward, along the ridge.
Bremerton kept below the crest of the uplift.
At a distance, it might have been, of a quarter of a mile, fte man with the bag descended the opposite slope and passed from sight.
The mill-clamor was hushed so that the shrill cries of the coyotes could be heard.
Creeping things, to which Bremerton gave no heed, scuttled out of his way.
He looked down from the ridge-top upon a narrow level of desert, at the farther side of which were more hills and the mouth of an arroyo.
Big Steve was laying a straight course for the arroyo.
He paused once to emit a whistle.
The signal was answered.
Against the arroyo, black as a pocket, a point of light flared, fluttered and died out.
Bremerton crawled over the top of the ridge and, with redoubled caution, let himself down the slope.
Here and there on the level were bits of chaparral.
From screen to screen of bushes he moved and finally was as close to the mouth of the arroyo as he could go without inviting discovery.
He heard a mumble of words.
Big Steve was talking with some one whom he had met.
A match was lighted, and the speck of fire hung over a pipe between the amalgamator’s lips.
Hardly a breath of air was stirring, and that faint glow did not waver.
Big Steve sat on a boulder.
The figure beside him bent to pick up the bag he had carried from the bunk-house.
The face of the stooping form came within the dim circle of light from the match.
It was face, and the light glittered on the rings in his ears.
There was a sling of white cloth suspended from the neck, and in the fold of it his right hand rested.
There could not be the least doubt regarding the identity of Chombo.
Here was positive evidence of conspiracy.
Chombo had assisted Big Steve in his stealings while employed at the mine, and he was still active now that he had been discharged.
How many of those rough workers at the mine were honest and loyal to Deane?
The scene at the mouth of the arroyo suggested the question to Bremerton, and he was in a mood to distrust every man in the camp except King.
Where double-dealing was possible, owing to laxity of those in control, nearly every one would be found with a hand in it.
It was up to Bremerton to make the thieving impossible.
The first step to that end would be accomplished by making object-lessons of Big Steve and Chombo.
When the two in the mouth of the arroyo separated, the amalgamator returned toward the mill by the way he had come, and the half-blood faded into the dark of the narrow valley.
Bremerton allowed Big Steve to go his way and pressed forward into the arroyo.
His object was to discover, if he could, where the stolen amalgam ;was taken by Chombo.
In this he failed.
Chombo had vanished completely, and to prowl aimlessly around in an attempt to locate him might have resulted in disaster to the superintendent.
An examination of the arroyo could wait until the following day.
The heavy gloom made a night search worse than useless.
Bremerton started back towards the ridge.
As he was climbing the slope, a rider galloped along the ridge-top, coming suddenly from nowhere and flinging along in the direction of the trail.
His jaws clamped hard and his brows wrinkled as he stood and gazed.
The rider was cut sharply in silhouette against the lighter background of the night sky.
That swinging, graceful figure, the broad-brimmed hat, the fluttering hair— He could not be mistaken.
It was Mariquita Mallory!
The girl was swallowed up in the shadows as suddenly as she had appeared.
Bremerton muttered angrily.
Why was she there?
Had she a part in that scoundrelly work at the mill?
Was there really but one set of enemies fighting Deane?
Were the foes within the camp linked in deviltry with those outside?
Were they all working together to drive Deane out of that mining district Somewhere, deep down in soul, lurked a sense of disappointment.
He realized that he had been hoping against hope that Mariquita Mallory, in the face of all that had happened, might be as inoncent of actual wrong-doing as she had professed to be.
But evidence was piling upon evidence to prove the contrary.
Big Steve, the thief, had met Chombo, another thief, in the hills.
The girl was there, not present at the meeting, but handily by, to take from Chombo the bag of stolen amalgam.
Quite likely the bag lay across the saddle in front of her as she galloped away. not make a fool of me as she did of Lacey,” Bremerton growled.
He had said that before.
Why was he harping on it Did he feel himself slipping and was he unwittingly making a stand against an event altogether possible His spirit was up in arms against himself.
While climbing the slope and striding along the ridge his thoughts circled around ways and means for gathering both Mallorys in the same snare he was preparing for Big Steve and Chombo.
“If she’s in this,” he vowed, she’ll pay for it.
I warned her.
Whatever the cost, these foes of are to be put out of business.
They canot wipe me out before had my way with them.”
When he had got back to the headquarters adobe and had locked himself in the stuffy rooms, he lpoked at his watch and found that it was two o’clock.
His work for the next day, and for many days to follow, was cut out for him.
It was time he was in bed.
His thoughts, however, gave him no rest.
He fumbled for his keys and started to open the drawer containing the ball of amalgam and the other things, and angrily caught himself up short.
What do I want to look at that stuff for? he mentally asked himself.
And he had no logical answer for the question.
The Mallorys were with the amalgam thieves.
Otherwise, how it was that he found that first ball of amalgam on the scene of his struggle by the Phoenix town ditch? as guilty as the r€st of them! he muttered savagely.
With that conclusion firmly in mind he dismissed the whole subject of his night’s work and went to bed.
The entrance of Michael O’Hara upon the gloomy scenes of this chronicle was excellently timed for Bremerton.
A sordid struggle, inspired by the greed of men, blackened by treachery and tragedy, and with a plaintive note of injustice to some one somewhere ringing through it all, needs the touch of an O’Hara to renew faith in the fitness of things as they are.
He should have been played on with a rollicking quickstep, but not too wild, not too clashing.
A nocturne, perhaps, in two-four time, dreamy in places, but with here and there a laugh at the world for its follies.
Mostly the strings, if you please, with a lilting of the wood-wind, and once or twice but no more the drums and the brasses.
That was the spirit of the O’Hara, the soul of him.
But there was trouble in setting it to music.
For this reason, may bp, he chose personally to express himself through his own flute.
He came suddenly.
It was a habit he had.
And gently and unobtrusively.
That was another habit.
Bremerton had first discovered him in the desert.
His burro was dead, his food and water were gone.
With his back to a sahuara cactus, he was waiting for the and trying to breathe out his soul through the flute with The, Harp That Once Thro’ Halls.”
For two years after that he and Bremerton were inseparable.
They found gold, those two, but it was the gold in each other’s heart.
They struggled, they starved, they broke rock and ripped holes in the flinty earth, and they sfettled down at last to sink a shaft on the Light of Hope,” their only find.
But the light went out and hope died and they, had a hole in the ground for their pains.
Between two days O’Hara decamped, leaving a note and sixteen silver dollars for Bremerton.
The note said briefly: fight for you, die for you; but all hell canot make me saddle you longer with the cursed luck of the O’Haras.”
The sixteen dollars were all he had in the world.
And when he went it was afoot, leaving the burro and all the meager grub-pack for Bremerton.
High and low Bremerton searched for him, but whenever O’Hara effaced himself he did it thoroughly.
No trace of the Irishman could Bremerton find.
For many a month after that heart was sore.
O’Hara had come into his life shortly after Deane had gone out of it, and the loss was a blow.
The friendship of the right man for another who is right is one of the greatest gifts of God.
And it never ends, here or hereafter.
On the morning after his night’s work in the hills Bremerton was wakened by soft music outside his door.
Thrilled, he sat up on the cot and greedily drank in the melody.
He was happy, but he was not precipitate.
The ways of the man outside were known to him and he deferred to them.
To the strains of Mollie he got up deliberately and put on his clothes.
When he was quite ready he went into the outer office and unlocked and opened the door.
A hatless man with red hair sat on his door-step playing a flute.
Not by the wildest flight of fancy could the man be called handsome.
His nose was short and his upper lip was long.
His eyes were a washedout blue, and while one of them looked straight at you the other surveyed the landscape.
He was lean and long; doubled up as he was, his knees all but touching his chin, his length was painfully in evidence.
But he was comfortably clad.
In fact, his whole appearance radiated prosperity.
It was not an effusive prosperity, but an ample amount for creature comforts.
With one eye fixed on Bremerton and the other looking around the corner of the adobe, he continued his playing.
Bremerton took a chair and sat down.
After Mollie had been played up and down and across, with trills and variations and the chorus three times repeated, the player took the flute from his lips and pushed it into a new, green cloth bag.
Come in, O’Hara,” said Bremerton calmly.
I owe you sixteen dollars.”
Divil a cent do you owe me,” and the wide mouth of O’Hara opened in a roar of laughter. owing you a thousand this minute, Bremerton, and no one has been able to see me for dust in the rush made looking for you. changed a little, a very little, for O’Hara, or never have ventured to run onto your trail.
The debt, you mind, could have been canceled by post.”
He pulled himself up from the step, shook his angular frame, and came into the little room.
Twisting a package of bank-notes out of an inside pocket, he flung it to Bremerton.
“Well, by glory!”
Bremerton stared at the money as though hypnotized.
A thousand plunks! said O’Hara, grinning.
Count ’em.”
Where have you made a raise, Mike?
And why in blazes am I entitled to a share in it So you’ll be lookin’ a gift horse in the mouth, will you?
Shame on you for tryin’ to dodge good money at the hand of a friend no safe been crackin’, no strong-arm work in it at all, at all.
Och, my boy, you could never guess.
We thought it a limestone stringer, with not much under the grass-roots but heartache and disappointment.
Sure, we never made a bigger mistake.
Lee, the old Light has made good to the chune of a couple of thousand.
By the same token, your half is there in that wad.
Now will you behave Bremerton looked incredulous.
O’Hara hastened to explain.
This is the way of it, and on my soul you canot be more surprised than I was when the miraculous truth hit me in the face.
’Tis six months gone since I was near that spot where we lived and labored and lost faith.
I went to see' that beautiful hole over which we’d cracked our backs, and will you believe me it was deeper than when we left it, and a bit of a cross-cut had been run, and six men were takin’ out ore that would have made your eyes bulge.
The claim had been jumped, So help me.
And why not, with no assessment work done for a year?
Oh, the fools we were not to be thinkin’ of that cross-cut!
Bremerton was dumfounded.
And yet he need not have been.
Occasionally such things are happening in the mining country, and as long as men dig for gold they will continue to happen.
“But the two thousand?” said Bremerton.
“If the claim was jumped, I donot see why the newcomers had to buy it.”
’Tis there the laugh comes in,” proceeded O’Hara, crinkling his crossed eyes.
It was in my name, do you mind, and you had a quitclaim to half.
My location was filed, but you hadnot taken the trouble to file your quitclaim.
They knew of me, those claim-jumpers, and they imagined trouble where none could be made, and gave me the two thousand to sheer off.
I got it without passin’ my hat! and he wrapped his long legs around the chair and nearly choked with mirth.
Never before for Bremerton had fortune gone to such lengths to give him a bit of a smile.
He appreciated the humor of it, yet, if he had not, the wild joy of O’Hara would have forced a laugh out of sheer sympathy.
The best part of it, Mike,” said Bremerton, is that luck has turned for you.”
Faith,” was the response, the longest lane is bound to have a turn.
Not being able to turn for the worse, it had to be for the better.
As soon as I had the money in my jeans I set off looking for you.
The divil’s own chase you led me.
Here you were grub-stakin’ for a month in the hills, and there you’d come in, with your chuck gone and the burro no more than skin and bones.
Maybe it was carpenter work you did, or clerkin’ in a store, or drivin’ stage until you’d amassed enough capital for another pasear in the wilds.
Och, lad, but you’re a "hard one to come up with when the gold fever’s in you and the heart of you cryin’ for the lonesome trails!
But I kept along until I found the place where you skinned yourself of your property to buy a ticket to Denver.
Then I knew,” and the smiling face went long and the faded, mismatched eyes grew dull.
I knew, by my soul, that you’d knuckled under to Deane.”
O’Hara had no use for Deane.
An honest Irishman, no matter if he is out at elbows, will think of his codscience twice for every once you mention a pirate.
Only,” continued O’Hara, I wished to High Heaven got to you with the thousand in time.
For what have you sold yourself, Lee?
A paragraph in the papers let me know you were here, and that Deane had hired you to lay out this property butterside up.
What was the price?
A grim smile flickered across the other’s lean face.
“If you think sold my birthright for a mess of pottage, Mike,” said hd, you’ll have to guess again.
Now listen. going to tell 'you something confide to no other living soul, and I want you to get it straight.”
He went into his arrangement with Deane exhaustively.
Not only that, but he followed his own trail down from Denver, to the hospital with Lacey, to the cottonwoods by the Phoenix: town canal, to the mine, and, at last, to the mouth of the. arroyo.
Bremerton could speak to O’Hara as to no one else.
His beliefs, his hopes, his intentions were all laid naked before the eyes of his friend.
He had no need to tell of his confidence in Deane, for that tingled in every word of his talk.
But he did declare his black suspicions of Mariquita Mallory, and there was a false note struck again and again as he emphasized his convictions.
O’Hara loved to drink in the music, but he hated the discord.
Man, dear, but you’re out of chune! and he wabbled his red head gruesomely.
The girl is a fiend, of course.
Lacey say so?
He has judgment and penetration, although, to be sure, he couldnot find the hole in the mill where the amalgam ran out; but that was simple, and eye was all for complications. human nature and bitter true that we’d rather take a week hunting for something than travel ’cross lots for an hour and pick it up.
But if there was any doubt o’ the girl’s duplicity, you settled it-.
Beyond a shadow of surmise, in the twice you talked with her and the once you saw her gallopin’ through the night you smoked out her true char-ac-ter.
Oh, the black trick she played on you there by the town ditch!
Forced her horse on you at the muzzle of a gun—made you ride when you could not walk—bullied you into a comfortable trip back to your hotel!
Troth, in hopes to be spared till I can get even with her for that.
It was worse, though, when she came here and wanted to be -friends.
You were right in not letting her speak of the mine or give .you the whys and wherefores of the sorry-work that has been going on here.
She might have exploded some dynamite under that trust you have in Deane.
“Then what?
No matter. the glove?
Begorry,” and a wry smile came into the homely face, like to take it back to her myself and tell her a few things.
Bremerton, a mind to camp down on you for a while.
You need me.
But be no deadhead; work.”
But you donot understand—” I understand more than you think.
Before long there’ll be more broken heads in these diggin’s than there ever was at a Donnybrook fair.
For one of my disposition the outlook is distinctly allurin’. going to work here.”
“Where are you going to work?” laughed Bremerton.
In the mill.
About to-morrow you’ll be needing a new amalgamator, and the man for the job.”
“Then that’s settled, and I could ask nothing better.
There goes the gong at the chuck-shanty, Mike.
Come on to breakfast.”
Bremerton planned a surprise for Big Steve and Chombo.
The law was to be invoked against them and the case relentlessly pressed.
Such a move would constitute an object lesson for all the enemies of Deane.
King was sent to Phoenix directly after breakfast to-communicate plans to the sheriff.
As a cover to the real nature of his errand, it was given out in camp that he had gone to town for a couple of carboys of sulphuric acid.
In looking over the odds and ends of equipment in the office the superintendent had found an old dark-lantern.
He had the lantern cleaned and filled by Wun Sing and made ready against the night’s operations.
At ten o’clock in the evening Bremerton and O’Hara quietly slipped out of camp and made their way along the trail to the top of the ridge.
Three men were waiting for them on the the sheriff, and two deputies. mighty glad,” said Ransom, after a few minutes’ talk, that something is going to be done out here.
Thugs and plug-uglies have been doing about as they please at the Mariquita, and the law has had blamed little to work on.
Sneaking coyotes have covered theft? tracks well, and even when Griggsby went I couldnot lay hold of the first thing in the shape of a clue.
The coroner’s verdict, that he met his death at the hands of some person or persons unknown,’ still stands. a blot on the good name of this county and this mining district; but now, with your help, in hopes to accomplish something.” be a clean-up, Ransom,” declared Bremerton shortly, and you can gamble on that.
Where did you leave your horses got a buckboard back a ways on the trail.”
You understand the scheme.
Captain Bryden and the half-breed is only part of it; in addition to that, we’ve got to recover the stolen amalgam.”
I get you.
Maybe your idea will work, and maybe it wonot; but we’ll try it out.”
All five of them pushed into the chaparral at the trailside.
The night wind rustled the and as it rose and fell the muttering of the mill rose and fell with it.
The clear-cut stars gleamed in the sky like scattered diamonds, and only beneath them the trail was a lone, whitish blur and the ridge-top a shadowy stretch of brush-clumps and massed boulders.
An hour dragged, and that?” whispered Ransom in ear. a horse, and coming from the wrong direction.” make a move.”
The galloping came close and a horse and rider paused within a dozen feet of those in the chaparral.
Rising in the stirrups the rider looked over into the valley for a moment, peering and listening; then, with a sharp turn to the right, was off and out of sight along the ridge.
A woman, by thunder! murmured the amazed sheriff.
He swore under his breath.
Is there a woman mixed up in this, Bremerton he demanded.
How do I know who’s mixed up in it?” returned the superintendent fretfully.
There are others besides Big Steve and Chombo, I suppose, and maybe to-night will give us a line on them.”
With one hand he touched O’Hara.
The latter was sitting comfortably, his long knees hunched to his chin and his hands clasped around them.
He laughed softly but said not a word.
The tide of sentiment had set in toward Mariquita Mallory.
This weakness of the girl’s for nightriding, and at times when the nights were bedeviled with treachery, had in timely fashion been brought home to O’Hara.
Bremerton expected surprise and consternation.
His expectations had been met with a laugh that expressed unreasoning, unshaken faith.
Another hour dragged, and then through the deep, rolling diapason of the mill a sliding foot whispered in the sand.
A dark figure was climbing out of the valley, a sack over the shoulder.
Get ready! said Bremerton to the sheriff.
A tense moment followed.
Ransom took something from his pocket and rose crouching to his feet.
Bremerton brought the lantern around in front of him and made ready to open the shutter.
The figure won to the top of the trail and turned toward the length of the ridge.
In that moment the shutter clicked and an eye of light streamed from the bushes.
Big Steve whirled with a gasp in his throat.
The bag dropped and he stood blinking in the< glare.
Then a hand swept under his coat toward his hip.
None of that!
The bushes crashed and Ransom landed heavily in the trail. got your number, Bryden, and here’s where you lose.
Bring that hand back in front of •you!
The hand came back, but with steel glittering in the lantern-light.
The amalgamator, at bay, would have made a fight of it, even against such odds. long body shot clear of the chaparral as though propelled by springs, and with the swiftness of lightning he caught the steel and tore it away.
“That pulls his fangs for him,” remarked O’Hara, stepping back.
He has no sense at all or he’d know when he’s trapped.” this puffed Big Steve. stoppin’ me?
The sheriff,” replied that official briskly.
Andy!
Both deputies were out of the bushes by then, and Andy hurried to the prisoner with a pair of handcuffs.
Big Steve showed his mettle and his desperation and began a wild fight against the inevitable.
Leave him to me,” said the fluteplayer, and caught the thick, hairy wrists.
With a strength no one but Bremerton knew he possessed, O’Hara slowly but surely. brought the hands of the prisoner together in front of him. be in a rush with those come-alongs, Andy,” cautioned Bremerton wants his coat, do you mind. another one to be dealt with.”
The words caused Big Steve to remember Chombo, and he lifted a roar of warning.
The other deputy came up behind and slapped a hand over the prisoner’s mouth.
Off with the coat,” said Bremerton, bringing the light closer.
I donot think the yell caused any harm.”
With the sheriff’s help the coat was stripped from the amalgamator’s shoulders and the handcuffs snapped in place.
Bremerton put on the coat over his flannel shirt, and picked up a black slouch hat that lay in the trail.
Take him off to the wagon,” he went on the deputies.
A twisted handkerchief was tied between Big jaws as a precaution against any further use of his voice, and the two men half dragged and half carried him along the road.
Ransom borrowed the lantern and turned its light into the open mouth of the sack.
Caught him with the goods, all right!
There was a throb of satisfaction in his husky voice.
Bremerton, we’ve a dead open and shut so far as that fellow is concerned.” get the others in the same way,” was response. only one more, Lee,” put in O’Hara quietly.
Make sure.”
We will make sure of it, Mike.”
Bremerton stuffed his own hat in the front of his coat and put on Big got to proceed carefully, from now on, if we locate the amalgam.”
He picked up the bag and threw it over his shoulder.
Shut off the lantern,” he added, and follow well in the rear.”
Wait a bit.”
O’Hara stepped closer to his friend.
This is the part of your scheme, Bremerton, that has little appeal to me.
The breed may think you’re Bryden for a few moments, but how will this play get you the location of. the amalgam?
If you think you can act the part of Steve and get Chombo to talk, then you’re far wide of your trail.
Again, suppose Chombo heard that yell of Big If he did, he’ll be waiting and ready for you.”
Chombo will be in the dark of the arroyo,” explained Bremerton.
We canot hide out and wait for him, as we did for Steve, and the three of us canot approach the mouth of the arroyo without arousing the breed’s suspicions. a flat to cross, and practically no cover.
This is the only move we can make that will lay Chombo by the heels, and I may get a tip regarding the amalgam.”
And you may get something more than you expect,” muttered O’Hara.
Not from Chombo.
He has only one good hand.”
Well, go ahead,” cut in the sheriff impatiently.
Whatever happens, Bremerton, we’ll be at your back.”
The superintendent started along the ridge.
Indistinct as he was in the starlight Chombo might easily mistake him for Steve Bryden.
Following the route the amalgamator had taken the previous night, Bremerton descended the slope, crossed the little plateau and paused only to give the whistle signal.
The signal was answered, and he advanced swiftly to the arroyo’s mouth.
A figure disentangled itself from the gloom, as the superintendent dropped the bag and seated himself on a boulder, a stealthy figure that crouched forward only to halt warily and at a safe distance.
Steve questioned a voice.
Yes,” answered Bremerton.
The word was lost in a report, and fire flashed in the mouth of the arroyo.
Bremerton gasped, swayed and slowly sank downward at the side of the boulder.
A wild laugh burst from Chombo.
His form straightened and he plunged forward.
Ransom and O’Hara could be heard stumbling across the flat, coming uncertainly but at speed, each with his own forebodings about Bremerton.
Chombo bent and grabbed for the bag of amalgam.
In the same instant, arms went around him.
“Thought you had me, eh?” growled Bremerton.
Not that time!
The two were struggling when Ransom and O’Hara came up.
In short order the half-blood was flung to the ground and pinned there by the sheriff.
“Lee,” asked O’Hara anxiously, how bad is it Bremerton laughed.
Chombo knew something was wrong,” he answered, and some one was handily by to pick me off.
But the shot went wide.”
Och, you schemer! chuckled O’Hara, mightily relieved.
You dropped, and the breed rushed for the sack.
Then you nailed him.
It was well done, for I thought in my soul you had followed Griggsby.”
Good work,” said Ransom approvingly.
Chombo,” he added to his surly captive, the sheriff, arid you’re under arrest.
We have your confederate, Bryden.
Now, where's! the loot? making no promises* but it will surely not go harder with you if you tell us about the amalgam.’*, let me go if I give ye the; amalgam?” panted the half-blood.
No.
You may help yourself, though, if you make a clean breast of this.”
There was a brief silence, during which Chombo seemed to be thinking.
Get off,” he gasped, let me breathe.
You hurt my arm.”
Ransom groped through clothes for weapons, confiscated a knife, and finally got to his feet.
The lantern, O’Hara,” said he.
The yellow gleam fixed itself upon the form of Chombo, and undef the threatening muzzle of the sheriff’s gun he struggled to his feet.
“You did this!” said Chombo between his teeth.
His black eyes, gleaming with hate, turned on Bremerton.
Some day I am going to kill you! do you,” came sharply from Ransom.
Better think of yourself, Chombo. be some years before you’re foot-loose and able to camp on anybody’s trail.
What about that loot The half-blood swore softly and shifted his arm to a more comfortable position in the sling.
“What can I do?” he complained fiercely.
You are three and I am only one. take you where you can find the amalgam.”
How far is it “Half a mile, maybe.”
Just a minute,” put in Bremerton.
Who fired that shot from the arroyo?
Carramba!
Some things I tvill not tell.
That is one.” clear enough to me, anyhow.”
The girl on the horse queried the sheriff.
Easy, easy,” cautioned O’Hara.'
Facts are what we want, not guesses.”
He whirled on Chombo and flung the light full in his evil face. add a lie to the rest o’ your misdoings,” said he, but tell us who shot at Bremerton?”
Cunning flashed in the shifty black eyes.
Senorita Mallory.”
You spawn of the pit! cried O’Hara.
I throw it back in your teeth. too ready to tell when you swore you wouldnot.
The truth is not in you.
If he’d lie about one thing, Ransom, he’d lie about two, and I would not go a step with him to find this amalgam.” give him a chance to make good,” answered the sheriff.
If he’s got any black scheme in his mind, he’ll pay for it.”
Come with me, that’s all,” said Chombo surlily.
If you find lyin’ you can make me pay.” playing fair,” observed Bremerton. be going.”
With O’Hara on one side of him and Ransom on the other, Chombo led the searchers into the arroyo.
For several minutes they stumbled through the darkness, then climbed a steep slope, traversed the length of a hogback,” plunged downward into blackness again, and came finally into a small canon.
The walls were not high, and from somewhere ahead could be heard a drip, drip of water falling into a pool.
A turn in the gulch brought them out on a flat covered with a sparse growth of oaks.
They were now close to the dripping water, and a small house could be seen under the shadow of the trees.
Oak Flats,” remarked Ransom, I know the place.
The only water this side the Mariquita.
Which way, Chombo The adobe barn back of the house,” said the prisoner.
The small house was dark and still.
Twenty yards away, backed up against the rugged gulch wall, stood the barn.
A corral, fenced with okatea stakes braided with wire, was close to the barn.
As they passed the corral a horse whinnied.
Must be some one at home,” commented Bremerton.
If so,” returned O’Hara, they’re in bed like honest folks.
My word for it, this half-breed is muy nialo. not be trusting him under oath.”
Wait! snarled the prisoner.
He conducted them around the side of the adobe barn, then kicked his foot against the base of the wall.
His foot struck wood, and there was a hollow, resonant sound.
Take away that board and look! hissed Chombo.
Then tell me a liar.”
Bremerton dropped to his knees, and while the beam of light played over the base of the adobe wall he removed a square section of board.
A cavity was revealed.
He reached into it and fished up a ball of amalgam the size of his fist.
“Tally one for the breed!” muttered Ransom. right, Bremerton; he’s playing fair.
How much of the stuff is in the cache?
With both hands Bremerton began scooping out the amalgam.
The heap grew into a small mountain of frosted silver before he brought out the last ball and rose to his feet.
As I figure it,” said he, the Mariquita mill has been systematically robbed since the days of Griggsby. not a tenth of the stealings in that pile.”
Figure some more,” came the sneering voice of the half-blood.
Would all the amalgam be left in that' hole under the wall, or would it be taken away when there was enough to make it worth while, retorted, run into bars, and sold quick, light footfall was heard, at that moment, and the men turned.
O’Hara shifted the gleam of the lantern, and the slender, erect figure of Mariquita Mallory was etched clearly against the somber background of the oaks.
She came steadily, bravely on, her wide-brimmed hat pushed back and the rebellious tresses twisting about her forehead and throat.
Her face was set in resolute lines.
A quirt swung from her slender wrist, and her horse could be seen dimly in the distance.
This is hardly a time for visitors,” said she.
May I ask what you are doing?
O’Hara stepped forward.
With a courtly gesture he removed his hat.
“Miss Mariquita Mallory?” he inquired in a voice as soft as any note of his flute.
Her large eyes swerved to him wonderingly, and she inclined her head.
And these are your premises, the place where you live?”
Yes.”
Then be so kind as to bear with the lot of us.
The man there,” and he flashed the lantern upon the prisoner, has been caught takin’ goold from the Mariquita mill.
He led us here, saying he’d show us where he’d cached some more of it.
And, faith, he has.
’Twas under the adobe wall.
Bad cess to the blackguard for hiding his loot on the property of honest folks!
The girl stood like a statue.
Her gaze passed from O’Hara, encountered Bremerton, then fell on the sheriff, and finally rested on the pile of amalgam.
O’Hara threw the light from point to point as the wide, wondering eyes traveled over the oddly assorted group.
That amalgam was found there, under the wall The words were quick and breathless, and they ended in what was almost a sob.
A gloved hand arose to' the white throat and the fingers closed.
Be sure, Miss Mallory,” said O’Hara hastily, you have nothing to fear at all.”
Why why should I have anything to fear You know me, I think, Miss Mallory,” spoke up Ransom with a touch of sternness. the sheriff.
If you can tell us anything about this halfbreed, now is the time.”
The hand dropped from the throat and the lithe figure straightened.
The head went up, the shoulders back, and the girl faced the sheriff squarely.
Has the half-breed told you anything about me she demanded.
He says you shot at Bremerton from the arroyo, and he—” Man, man,” burst wildly from O’Hara, what was the need o’ that?
With measured steps Mariquita Mallory approached Chombo, where he stood at side.
Quick as thought her right hand flew up and the quirt fell stingingly across the halfbreed’s face.
With bosom heaving and eyes flashing she leaped back.
Say it again! she cried.
Here, before me, say it again!
Hate and rage and pain twisted villainous face.
Oh, will you say it? breathed the girl fiercely.
There is no one to help Mariquita Mallory, no one but Mariquita Mallory herself.
A woman’s good name—what is that to a prowling dog in these hills?
What is it to any of you?
Her flaming eyes swept the faces of the nfen.
Does it mean nothing to me, to be lied about, and slandered and my name made a by-word on the lips of honest men?
Shame to you that you listen to the wretch, and double-shame that you leave it to me to drive the lie down his miserable throat.
But I can do it.”
She whirled back to Chombo again, and once more her arm went up and the quirt-thongs trailed over her shoulder.
Was it true Answer!
“No!” said the half-breed, and cowered with his good arm doubled before his face.
The excitement, the frenzy, went out of the girl in an instant.
Her arm fell at her side and her body, seemingly spentjjy that gust of passion, drooped limply forward.
Mr. Bremerton,” she murmured sadly, some day you will be sorry for all your suspicions; some day, if I can bear this long enough to make it clear to you.
If that amalgam was stolen from the Mariquita mill and brought here, it was done for a purpose.
That purpose was to bring nearer the jail with which you so gallantly threatened me that night by the town canal.
This home,” she waved her hand about her, is my home and my mud hovel—the only place we can call our own.
We should have better—some day we will have better, if we get justice and can live and fight till it comes.
Do what you can, -Mr. Bremerton,” she said scornfully, to cheat us out of our rights, but never again take the word of a half-breed thief against Mariquita Mallory.”
A dead silence ensued when the girl had finished.
Ransom was dumfounded, Bremerton amazed, and O’Hara humble and apologetic.
It was the Irishman who first ventured to speak.
Miss Mallory, what you say goes to the heart of all of us.
But, believe me, you have not the right of it.
When the half-breed said what he did, I gave him the lie.
And you donot know the heart of him yet.
Some day, as you said, you’ll come into your rights, and on that day you’ll know Lee Bremerton as I know him.”
A smile played about the girl’s full lips.
You are Irish? she asked.
All but the brogue,” he laughed.
My father is Irish and my mother was Mexican And you think I didnot guess Faith, your name was enough to tell me that.”
You are a friend of Mr. Friend That doesnot tell the half of it.
He saved me in the desert, and for two years we thirsted and starved together.
Such a life does not make for friends, do you mind, but for brothers.”
Then show Mr. Bremerton how wrong he is in his dealings with the Mallorys.
That is the greatest kindness you can ever do him—and me!
She pulled away her glove and reached out her right hand.
O’Hara accepted it with a knightly courtesy.
Trust me for that,” he answered.
Mariquita once more faced the sheriff.
Take that amalgam away with you,” said she.
You will find oresacks in the barn.”
With that, she left him, returned to her horse and led the animal toward the corral.
They watched her until she had passed from sight.'
So that’s old girl! murmured Ransom, in a bewildered tone.
Hanged if I ever knew she had such a temper.”
“Temper?” countered O’Hara.
Not a bit of it. spirit, fine and high, and nothing else.”
She ought to be on the stage,” growled Bremerton; she’d make a hit as an emotional actress.
But let’s sidetrack the heroics and get away.
Give me the lantern, O’Hara.”
O’Hara gave him the light without a word, and he went into the adobe barn to get the ore-sacks.
In due course, Dutch Fred bought, brought out from town and duly delivered to Smear Case one dozen bags of smoking tobacco.
I make no holler,” said Fred, “but I donot got a fair shake.”
Whyever didnot you?” inquired Case.
Dot Irish feller mit der crooked eyes come around since der bet.
He is a masgot for Bremerton.
I bet nodding against masgots.
He is vat beat me oudt of dot smokin’, yah, so.”
Case chuckled; and as he walked away loaded with tribute, he added insult to injury with this gem of song: It takes the Irish to beat the Dutch!
What the Irish canot accomplish it donot amount to much!
With your scientific tricks, You can never fool the can bet your life the Irish beat the Dutch!
For the first time since Deane had acquired the Mariquita Mine the property was more than paying expenses.
This was a matter for congratulation, although it was not going far enough.
It was no showing on which to effect a sale of the mine for half a million dollars. task was to bring the output of bullion up to the bonanza point set by Mallory.
He had unearthed a file of bullion certificates, and these he had compared with assays of rock from the lead on which the miners were now at work.
The ore was different.
Mallory had not worked out a rich pocket on the present vein.
He had dug in virgin and bonanza ground.
But where was it?
While the camp was being reorganized and shaken down to a commercially profitable basis, Big Steve and Chombo had come to trial for the larceny of the bullion and had been sentenced to the penitentiary.
Between arrest and conviction a remarkably short time had intervened.
And the sentences imposed were strangely inadequate Sinister influences had been at work in behalf of Big Steve and Chombo.
A lawyer of prominence had managed their case, but he had hastened rather than checked the law’s course.
As soon as his clients were finally behind the bars, it was known that he had begun disbursing small sums, as pensions, to the immediate families of the two men.
Bremerton had hoped that one or both of the thieves would make a confession involving more of enemies.
In this he was disappointed.
They held their peace and took their medicine, and Bremerton felt sure that somebody had made it worth their while.
Indirectly, it seemed certain that the convicted men were part of the strong and desperate organization that was fighting Deane.
With this murderous and persistent gang Bremerton could not but connect the Mallorys.
Absolute proof, however, was lacking.
While Bremerton gophered and hunted for clues of the lost vein, and pestered his mind with doubts and theories in other directions, O’Hara cheerfully tinkered with the mill-plates and in off-hours played his flute.
Apparently the Irishman had not a care in the world.
Now and then he would drop in on the night amalgamator, in the small hours of the morning, exchange small talk with him and covertly watch for dishonest work.
But if the amalgamator on the night shift had been crooked, the fate of Big Steve had induced him to reform.
This, which came nearer being a care for O’Hara than anything else, settled itself comfortably and left nothing on his mind.
In second month at the mine, at the close of a Monday afternoon, a Mexican boy rode up to the office and asked for the superintendent.
Bremerton was just coming in from a day’s fruitless quest for the lost vein, and the boy handed him a note, offered no explanation one way or the other, and immediately galloped away.
Bremerton read the note and smiled queerly.
After supper that evening, while O’Hara was getting out his flute, the superintendent halted the music for a talk.
What are you doing to carry out your part of the agreement, Mike?”
Bremerton inquired suddenly.
The other looked up blankly. a rolling stone I am, and utterly irresponsible,” said he. a contract to such a man?
But you have me curious, Lee.
What agreement is in your mind The one you made with Mariquita Mallory.
You were to show me how wrong I am in my estimate of her and her father.
Weeks have gone and you have not made a move O’Hara trilled a few notes, then laid the flute on his knee.
Sure, it was an easy job, and I saw it from the start.' makin’ no wrong estimates.
What you say, Bremerton, is one thing, and what you believe, in that case, is another entirely.” not giving me credit for being honest.” giving you credit for trying hard to be loyal to Deane.”
We might as well thrash this out, Mike.
Your attitude toward Mariquita Mallory is so different from mine that it bothers me.”
’Tis not different at all,” and the .flute went to his lips while he ran the scale. no use arguing with an Irishman.”
Then why are you bothered Quizzing wrinkles showed around the twinkling, crossed eyes.
Bremerton frowned and reached for a pigeonhole of his desk.
Removing a folded paper, he handed it to O’Hara and asked him to read it. said O’Hara. give something handsome if such an invite could come to me.
Did Lacey accept the note from Mariquita Mallory,” explained Bremerton sharply, that lured Lacey into a trap.
On the way to make his call he was shot from cover.
Only yesterday he left the Phoenix hospital, almost a wreck of a man, to go East and get back his strength.”
Now, wasnot that the divil’s own luck He couldnot be shot cornin’ back, could he Not at all.
He had to get it going, and that robbed him of a few blessed moments with the only woman ever seen who’s distinctly worth a man’s time.
For me, now, count it a pleasure to run the gantlet of a dozen ambushes just for a smile from the girl.”
At that moment Bremerton was nearer to being out of patience with his friend than at any time since he had known him.
Jumping to his feet, he strode up and down the office.
Calmly the Irishman blew into the flute, and out of it came softly the air of Mollie It was always a favorite in his more serious moments.
Bremerton sat down again and waited until he had finished.
O’Hara took his time, and a smile came to his lips as he again favored his friend with his attention.
Your fur was standing, Lee,” he remarked, and I thought it would calm you.
You canot stay mad at me, and you know it.
Let matters drift.
Before long you’ll be coming around in this Mallory business.” something else for you to read,” said Bremerton, handing him another note.
O’Hara took the paper and read: Mr. Bremerton: You must listen to me now.
You are in danger, and I can help you.
Come to our house in the morning at eight.
You will not be sorry if you do, for this time, trust Mariquita Mallory.
Och, the luck you have when you donot deserve it! commented O’Hara, his faded eyes glowing.
The poor taste she has, sending for you when she might have sent for me.”
He sighed heavily.
But a redheaded freak who canot look at a girl with both eyes at once mustnot expect too much in this world!
Bremerton, I congratulate you.”
The superintendent leaned forward and stayed the hand that was reaching for the flute.
Cut that out for now,” said he sharply.
Do you understand this Perfectly. go, and the girl will be getting you out of one danger only to draw you into another.
For the peace of my soul, rather face a battery of masked guns than come company front with those big black eyes. the danger for you, and known it all along.” talk like an idiot! growled Bremerton impatiently.
This is a. lure, just as the note to Lacey was a lure. you see it He says that,” murmured O’Hara, and calls me an idiot!
My poor man,” he added, you are not yourself. one thing I can see.”
Of course going—” Of course you are!
If for nothing more than to convince you that you’re wasting a lot of sentiment on a scheming, treacherous woman! continued Bremerton hotly.
You canot take that back,” said O'Hara dryly; “but not say it again.
With me it will go no further.” put the girl to the test.” you that will be put to the test, not Mariquita Mallory.”
If an attack is made on me while riding to Oak Flat, you’ll be convinced that the girl is not what she would have you think.”
Nothing of the kind. be convinced that enemies have watched their chance to catch you away from home.
Even two coincidences wouldnot spell the truth.”
Be reasonable,” implored Bremerton. let your heart run away with your head.”
And donot you, Lee Bremerton, let the cursed plots of Deane run away with your sense of right and justice.
Make your call.
If you’re shot out of your saddle and brought back here with the breath gone out of your body, it will not be the girl go hunting.
Mark that!
Whom would you hunt? queried the superintendent curiously.
Why, the fiends who would cause that girl to bear the brunt of their own black deeds!
Lee, you began your work here with a mistaken idea.
You can make have seen you do it before.
You went out of your way to think wrong of a woman.
It comes hard for you to think it, and deep down in your heart you are not convinced; but money has worked its spell, and you’ve got to do something to earn it.
Deane!
Deane! the man who has built himself up by knifing his friends!
He has piled high his dollars by blasting the hopes of others, by back-stabbing, by schemes that wonot bear the light, by—” No more of that, Mike! talking fair to your face and hitting you with a club from behind!
A robber so black that Big Steve and Chombo are white as the saints by comparison!
And he has hooked youbecause I was slow in getting around with that'thousand!
Can I ever forgive myself for that?
The washed-out blue eyes snapped, the red hair seemed to stand on head, and the blood rushed into the thin cheeks.
The Irishman half rose and shook a clenched fist at the ceiling.
He saved my life once,” said Bremerton, his bronzed face almost white; and he wouldnot play anything but square with me.”
Square! sneered O’Hara.
He has forgot how to be square!
When he took the wrong turn of the trail he went money-mad.
Play square with you!
Lee, you’re a tool.
On6 of these days you will find it out, and then, "blackguard that he is, I tremble for Silas Deane.”
Without speaking a word, Bremerton turned on his heel and strode from the office.
The notes of the flute followed Him through the door.
O’Hara was right. attitude toward Mariquita Mallory was one of distrust, not of absolute conviction.
At the first he was sure that the note to Lacey was a part of the tragic plot against him.
Now he was uncertain.
This second note revived his suspicions of the girl’s motives.
It offered a chance to test her character, and as such he welcomed it.
If he were set upon while proceeding to the Mallorys’, then he would know the girl for what she was.
In his own mind there would be no coincidence about it.
For him, perhaps, there was grave risk in the undertaking.
He thought little of that.
On an open trail in broad day he could use his eyes and his wits, and lurking foes would not easily get the better of him.
The mill was sounding the sixo’clock whistle as he rode out of camp.
The stamps clattered to a standstill, and from rising ground Bremerton looked back and saw the night shifts emerging from mine and mill and the day shifts straggling from bunk-house and Mexican quarter.
Boom!
Boom! came muffled explosions out of the distance.
They were the blasts fired by the miners so that levels and shafts might be clear of fumes before the other gang went underground.
From six to seven, at the beginning and the end of each day, the work closed down for breakfast and supper and the changing of shifts.
Bremerton spurred over the top of the trail.
For a quarter of a mile he would follow the main road to town' then turn into a branch that led to the canon and Oak Flat.
The rough country contiguous to the valley had been piled with monuments, filed on, and now belonging to Deane as part of the Mariquita property.
Bremerton had combed those adjacent uplands in his search for the lost vein, and had found no blowouts or other promising indications.
He believed the outlying claims comprised merely a barrier against those who would poach on the Mariquita preserves.
He was thinking less of that morning errand than of the mysterious bonanza ledge when he reached the point where he was to leave the main trail.
An swale crossed the road, and his course lay through ,the swale and toward the west.
A road runner darted out of the bushes on the right.
The horse gave a startled snort and reared backward.
At the same moment a sharp report rang out on the left, and Bremerton felt the wind of a bullet against his face.
On so small a thing may a man’s life hang!
The road-runner had startled the horse, and the horse had reared; and, at just that moment, the shot had been launched from the brush!
Had head been inclined a foot forward, Deane would have been looking for another superintendent.
This flashed through brain.
But he had not much time for thought.
The lurch of his mount had loosened the cinches, and the saddle turned.
He made a wild effort to keep on the horse’s back.
Finding this to he impossible, as the shot had still further alarmed tfie horse and set it to plunging, he tried to kick free of the stirrups and strike the ground on his feet.
One foot was freed, but the other became entangled.
He fell heavily in the trail on his shoulders, kicking desperately to get clear of the clinging stirrup.
The horse, frenzied by the unusual turn of events, continued to rear and fling its heels.
The outlook was dark indeed for Bremerton then, for he was in imminent danger of’ being trampled to death.
A hoarse shout came from the chap¬ arral.
A crushing of brush was heard at hajf a dozen widely separated points.
This, of course, was all lost upon Bremerton, for the more immi¬ nent danger claimed his attention.
Suddenly the horse whirled to the right and ran into the swale, dragging its rider over the rough ground and through the greasewood.
Bremerton was bumped against stones, lashed with brush-branches, and threatened at every leap with the pounding, ironshod heels.
He felt his senses going, and surrounding objects slid past him in a confused blur.
Dimly he was aware of beating hoofs close at hand—not those of his own runaway horse, but others.
One thought rose paramount in his befogged mind.
They had him!
At last those mysterious forces he had defied were closing in on their'quarry The horse stopped.
Some one dismounted.
The next moment his released foot fell and his body lay prone upon the ground.
There f.ollowed a preliminary trampling of the earth, ending in a tattoo of hoofs that faded into silence along the swale.
Mr. Bremerton!
He realized that his horse was gope; that another horse stood quietly a few yards from where he lay, and that on her knees beside him was Mariquita Mallory.
He sat up, bewildered.
“Bring on the rest of the gang!” he said presently.
He felt for his automatic revolver, but it had been lost out of his pocket.
There was nothing left with which to defend himself, and he must take whatever was to come.
Can you get up?
The girl put out her hand.
With her assistance he gained his feet.
Where are the rest of them? he demanded, glaring in the direction of the trail.
They are behind,” she answered, “and crowding us close.
Come, We must hurry.”
Crowding ns close he returned.
You may not believe it,” she said, with a trace of bitterness, “but they would not spare me any more than. they would you. have to trust me now, Mr. Bremerton, and you must pull yourself together and do your best.”
She straightened and peered anxiously up and down the swale; then she bent her head to listen.
What she saw or heard was beyond Bremerton, but a look of wild alarm crossed her pallid face.
Quick! she whispered, and seized his arm convulsively.
He yielded himself passively into her hands.
Whether she was a friend or foe made little difference just then.
He knew his danger could not be more acute either way.
Leaving her horse, Mariquita pulled him toward the bank of the swale.
There she dropped to her knees and began climbing through the thick brush.
The quirt, trailing from her wrist by a leather loop, got in her way.
She jerked it from her arm and flung it aside.
He followed her on all fours up and up through the mask of the chaparral.
His brain was clearing and'he wondered why she had abandoned her horse—why they had not both mounted the animal and galloped away.
If she was really trying to befriend him that would have seemed like the safest course.
He could not hear a sound in the depths of the scrub behind them.
What had become of the man who had fired at him at the fork of the trail Perhaps the murderous scoundrel had been frightened away by the failure of his plans; perhaps the girl was being carried away by her fears—she was a woman, and he had not much faith in a woman’s resourcefulness at such a time.
In spite of his doubts, however, he made no protest.
On hands and knees he crawled after the girl to the top of the bank.
He would have spoken then, but she looked at him wildly and placed a finger on her lips.
He started to rise, but she pulled him down.
Crack!
From somewhere in the swale came the bark of a firearm.
A bullet snapped through the bushes.
The golden echoes had hardly died into silence before they were taken up by another report.
This came from farther up the swale, but the snarling lead struck at the same point that had drawn the first shot.
Then again and again, from widely varying locations below, bullets were hurled at that one spot on the top of the bank.
The girl’s face was white, and yet she seemed to have herself well in hand. nothing else for it! she whispered through tense lips, more to herself than to Bremerton; “we must take to the blind our only chance.”
She turned and once more began worming her way onward.
At a distance of fifty feet the ground broke abruptly into a sheer descent ahead of them.
They looked into a narrow, steep-walled gully.
Bremerton had seen that gully before.
On the opposite side outlying holdings embraced the upand-down wall, and the last monument of the Mariquita property was heaped at the wall’s base. got to get down there, Mr. Bremerton! declared the girl.
I can do it,” he answered; but you—” I can go wherever you can. let that worry you.” have us bottled up once we’re in the gully.
I know the place, and it’s a veritable cul de sac.
We can get into it here, but we canot get out. .Once we’re down there they can take their time picking us off.”
No,” and she spoke with an effort, I know something about this that you donot.”
She began letting herself over the rim.
Wait,” he interposed. go first and help you.”
“After being dragged by your horse as you were you may have all you can do to help yourself.” all over that,” he answered, and lowered himself to a protruding stone in the cliff’s face.
Come after me closely,” he added. used to this rock-climbing.”
Foot by foot they descended, a projecting rock here, or a weather-worn seam in the wall there, affording them treacherous rounds in the cliff ladder.
The girl was clear-headed and steady, and at this Bremerton marveled.
Surely he had known very little about her up to that moment.
Time after time he reached upward to place the small foot in a place of comparative safety, and occasionally he lifted his voice in warning where the hand-holds were weak or the footholds crumbling.
When they neared the foot of the wall lead once more began to fly.
The marksmen kept themselves in hiding, drop-shooting from an angle that made their work more unnerving than dangerous.
Bullets struck against granite and glanced, singing, into space.
A few ranged upward and inward and one spent ball passed through sleeve.
Now where asked Bremerton, as he and the girl stood side by side at the foot of the wall.
His voice was even, almost colorless. strained glance rested on his face curiously.
You are a good deal of a man, Mr. some things,” said she.
This is no time for foolish talk,” he answered sharply.
Nor for foolish actions, perhaps, such as the one I am about to do.
This way, and be quick.”
She ran across the boulder-strewn bed of the gully and gained a screen of chaparral on the other side.
He followed.
The firing, strangely enough, had- slackened and the dash was entirely successful.
Come in here.” called the girl from a granite overhang.
He stepped under the rock.
In the half gloom a hand reached his and led him on and on into blank darkness.
As he stumbled forward he reached out with his free hand and ran it gropingly over a ragged wall.
Wonder gripped him.
They were in a tunnel.
Hard on the heels of wonder came a flash of hope and exultation.
A woman’s sacrifice.
"Who ran this tunnel into the gully wall, Miss Mallory?”
Bremerton, in his excitement over this new discovery, forgot the dangers that had driven them into that subterranean refuge.
His voice rang joyfully between the narrow walls, and the girl must have realized the trend of his thoughts.
My father and she answered quietly, dug and blasted our way into the heart of the hill.” ground!
This is the lost vein, the bonanza ledge, been hunting for!
I had an idea all the time that you and your father knew where it was—that you must know where it was.
What did you do with the waste you took out of the bore?
No one could look into the gully and even suspect that mining operations had been going on.
Why did you mask the work?
Why have you made a secret of it?”
She had dropped his hand.
Almost fiercely her voice leaped at him“ I had to bring you here in order to save your life.
Are you going to take advantage of the sacrifice and wreck the Mallorys completely Carruthers knew nothing about this vein.
I found it.
Our only weapon against Deane, all we could use in defending our rights, has been this secret of the hills.
Are you going to turn that weapon against ns?
Under the torrent of those hot words something like shame rose in his breast.
She had saved his life at the expense of a golden secret, carefully guarded.
Was he more indebted to her, who had rescued him, than to Deane, his employer?
Mariquita interpreted his silence as favoring her interests and her father’s.
Her voice lost some of its sharpness as she went on.
We are safe here.
The wretches in the gully will not show themselvesthey never do.
They plot and kill from cover.
Once seen they could be run to earth, identified, and made to suffer from what they have done and are doing.
Eager as they are to destroy you, Mr. Bremerton, they are more eager to keep themselves out of any entanglement with the law.
They know how hard the law would deal with them—> on account.
Just a moment!
There are candles and matches here, and I want you to see everything and to know everything.
I think you will listen to me now.”
He could hear her moving around near the opposite wall.
Presently she came back to him.
A light might be seen from the overhang,” said she, so we will not make one until we round the angle of the wall, a little way ahead.
Come!
She took his hand as before and led him forward and around a sharp turn.
Half a dozen steps farther, and they halted again.
First,” Mariquita observed, let me tell you how I happened to be in the swale.
I donot have to tell you what happened to Latey in answering a similar note of mine.
You thought evil of me in that matter.
It was in my mind this morning. knew you were threatened, and that a blow might fall while you were on the way to the canon.
But I had to ask you to come to me, for you had made it impossible for me to come to the mine.
I was anxious to learn whether you had faith enough in me—* whether your friend could persuade you—to answer that note in person.”
I didnot need persuasions,” he broke in grimly, for I should have come, anyway.
I wanted to test you—to find out whether a move would be made against me, as it had been made against Lacey in the same situation.”
So when that shot was fired at the fork in the trail you considered the case against me proven!
I had no time to consider anything.
The saddle turned and I dropped in the road.
But never mind that, Miss Mallory.
Go on.”
I had been watching the gang as well as I could, and I knew they were watching you, and only waiting for a chance to catch you off your guard.
Since you sent Big Steve and Chombo, to prison your skulking foes have been hot for reprisal.
They realized that I was trying to help you, and they would have blackened my motives in your eyes if they could.
Chombo tried it that night you found the amalgam.
The stuff was hidden in that place so that, if discovered, you could not but think ill of the Mallorys.”
Her voice caught in her throat, and her quick breathing there in the underground quiet smote on his ears.
I was anxious about you, Mr. Bremerton,” she resumed, steadying herself, for I realized only too well what you would think if anything went wrong on your way to the canon.
I rode to the swale by a roundabout bourse and was waiting for you to borne.
I saw what happened.
“As your horse charged past me, dragging you by a stirrup, I turned my own horse and followed.
The thing I did not expect, but feared in my heart, had come to pass.
If you had been killed, your friend O’Hara would have blamed me; but if I could do something to save you, then you and O’Hara would be compelled to believe in me.
That is why I stopped your horse, and that is why I made the sacrifice in bringing you here.”
You wrong O'Hara.
Nothing could make him suspect you of treachery.
He hasnot the same responsibility at the mine that I have,” Bremerton added dryly.
It wasnot my life particularly but your own good name that concerned you.” think that!
Deane has robbed us, and all we hoped was to effect some settlement with*him on the score of his lost vein.
But he has no heart, no conscience.
The more he was harrassed, and the harder the work at the mine was made for him, the nearer he might be forced to a compromise with us.
But the slaying, the shooting, the robbing—oh, in the name of justice, do not connect my father and me with that!
Who has done it all Others.
I donot know who they are, and I donot know the motives back of it, for they work in the dark.
If you could discover who is paying the relatives of Big Steve and Chombo a pension, you would get a clue that might help unravel the mystery. not go into that now.
My father and I are not to be identified with those wretches.
You are to make sure of that, once and for all.
My father knew you were coming to Phoenix.
We went to town as soon as we heard, and he followed you about and took the first opportunity to warn you.
No work was going on at the Mariquita Mine; and I think I cannot be, positive—that there were some from there concerned in that attack on you by the town canal.”
Remembering the ball of amalgam, and how it had ultimately led to the unmasking of Big Steve, Bremerton made no doubt that the girl was right.
The conclusion was interesting, but led to no substantial results.
My father, after he left you that night in Phoenix,” the girl pursued, heard the rush of men among the cottonwoods.
Oh, the pity that the attack should have happened then, of all times, so that blame could be laid at my father’s door!
He came at once and told me, and I rode to the canal to see how matters had fared with you.
For my trouble I had only hard words and cruel suspicion.
That is what hurts a woman—some women. hurt me.
I wanted you to understand the situation, Mr. Bremerton, and I smothered my pride and rode to the mine for a talk with you.
It would have been better if I had stayed away.
Under the strain of all this wrong and injustice my father’s health is breaking.
He has fought for years with misfortune, and just at the moment when success was, within his grasp it was snatched away by Deane, treacherously, deliberately, cruelly.
If he had done what he should that night in Phoenix, father would have sent the police to the town canal.
But he was not himself; and when he had brought word to me it was too late. soon as we came back home from town, I began trying to learn something about these others who are fighting Deane.
Night after night I have hovered about the mine.
I saw Big Steve go to thtf arroyo and meet Chombo, but I could not follow Chombo and find what he did with the amalgam.
“The night of the capture I was close to Chombo when the shot was fired at you.
I could not see the man who fired, but I heard him scrambling away.
I took after him, but he evaded me in the pitchy darkness of the arroyo.
When I got back to Oak Flat I found you there, and O’Hara and the sheriff.
Can you put yourself in my place and realize how I felt to hear from the sheriff that Chombo accused me of shooting at you?
I had just worn myself out trying to run down that skulking, cowardly scoundrel.”
A feeling of sympathy for the girl had grown in breast as she talked.
He was glad of the dark and that he could not see her face.
Had there been anything more to impress him in her favor, his sense of duty toward Deane would surely have suffered.
“No doubt I have been mistaken,” said Bremerton slowly.
After my interview with Lacey, though, the mistake was natural.
I am willing to set aside our past differences, Miss Mallory, and we can make common cause against these prowling devils who shoot from ambush, and rob and work under cover.
Do you want it that way What will be the end. of our work she asked doubtfully.
We will drive them out,” he answered resolutely, and bring to punishment those who murdered Griggsby and sent Lacey to the hospital.”
But apart from that she persisted.
Why, with the bonanza vein to draw on for ore, I will equal the showing you and your father made at the Mariquita!
Deane will unload the property for half a million, and—” And,” she cut in icily, you will receive five hundred dollars a month for your work and a bonus of ten thousand dollars!
The half million belongs by right to my father and me.
It goes to Deane; and we get—what Bremerton had no answer for that.
His knowledge stopped short of the Mallorys and their so-called rights.”
Deane was his friend, his employer.
When Bremerton gave his word about anything, it as as good as his bond.
You have nothing to say,” murmured Mariquita.
Now that you have listened so far, Mr. Bremerton, you must hear the rest of it.
First, though, it will be well to go to the overhang and reconnoiter.
I do not imagine that the men in the gully have the slightest idea what has become of us, but it is just as well to be on the safe side.
If you will wait here for a few minutes—” do the reconnoitering,” he cut in, and groped his way back around the turn and to the mouth of the tunnel.
At the lip of the overhang he could hear the distant growling of the stampmill.
It was faint, however, and if there had been any stirring about in the gully he would have been aware of it.
It was impossible for him either to see or to hear anything of his mysterious enemies.
When he returned he found that the girl had lighted a candle.
The light fell over her face, bringing out and accentuating each softly molded line.
Her large eyes met his wistfully, appealingly, as she put the candle in his hand and pointed to the breast of the level.
There! she whispered.
Look at the vein—the one I found—the one my father and I developed—the ledge that makes the Mariquita Mine worth half a million!
Examine it, Mr. Bremerton.”
He walked to the breast, brushed his hand over the surface of the rocks, held the candle close, and bent forward.
Another moment and he staggered back astounded, scarcely breathing.
He knew—none better—the full worth of what he saw.
Prospecting was his trade, and often he had hornspooned samples of crushed ore and found values that would have turned many a man’s head.
But never had he seen anything to compare with the indications of that bonanza lead!
A Rich said Mariquita passively.
Rich! he gasped.
Well, it’s the richest thing this side of the Comstock lode!
And the vein’s a foot wide and a true fissure.
Such veins increase in values as you go down on them.
What will the assays be a hundred feet, or a thousand feet, below? a—a—” Words failed him.
His voice trailed off into wondering silence. not much outcropping on top of the hill,” she said, her even tones contrasting queerly with his hoarse, vehement words.
I picked up just one insignificant piece of float and trailed the clue until I had uncovered a mere stringer.’
But that stringer was so rich that father and I covered up the opening and obliterated every sign of mineral.
Every man at the mine was discharged and not one suspected a strike.’
I guess we were wrong in doing that.
The theory was correct, but it did not work out well.
I worked side by side with father, digging that tunnel.
We were months at it, and we guarded every move we made.
The waste from the tunnel we pitched into a hole beside the overhang and covered it with brush.
When we began to take out ore we hauled it in sacks up the side of the gully.
Father fired and ran the engine at the mill, and I stood over the plates, dosing them with quick.’ run a day, then have a cleanup, and spend a week getting out more ore. hardly believe, Mr. Bremerton, the way the amalgam ridged itself up on those plates!
The gold tumbled out of the sieves and banked up so high in front of the batteryboxes that we-had to scrape it away every half-hour.
Father was like a boy.
Twenty years dropped from his shoulders.
He skipped back and forth between the engine-room and the batteries, and every once in a while he would stop to pat me on the shoulder and laugh, Girl, we’re made!
A palace and all the big things in life for you, ’way out there in the East!
At last, so help me, the.
Mallorys are coming into their own.’
But he was too quick with his hurrahs.
We had spent so much time ion the tunnel that we couldnot mine and mill enough ore to pay for the property.”
Into the mild depths of her eyes came a swift change.
She clutched her hands and wrung them convulsively.
Ah, the sorry way luck turned for us! she whispered.
With more than enough gold in sight to pay Carruthers a thousand times over, we had to go to Deane for a paltry twenty thousand dollars.
He put us off, played fast and loose with us, until finally he had the mine, and we were worse off than nothing.”
Her eyes snapped fire, and her hands fell at her sides and clenched fiercely.
A blacker-hearted scoundrel never lived than Silas Deane!
Bremerton had been given time to calm himself.
He studied the flame of the candle for a moment, then fixed the candle on a ledge in drippings of its own grease.
You are to tell me all about that now,” said he.
Why not sit down and be comfortable? not a comfortable subjectfor me,” she answered, standing in front of him as he dropped on a boulder by the hanging wall. getting ahead of my 6tory, too, and starting at the middle, where I should have gone back to the beginning.
It was not always the Mariquita Mine, Mr. Bremerton.
When Carruthers found it, and consolidated the several claims, it was known as the Apache.
Carruthers built the mill and laid the pipe-line, and opened up the vein you are now working on.
You have already discovered that the vein is very ordinary, and leaves no more than a small margin of profit.
It looked pretty good to father and me, though.
An uncle in the East had died and left me two thousand dollars.
One Christmas Day father took over the property at twenty-five thousand dollars.
Carruthers .was to have my two thousand dollars down and three thousand dollars more the first year.
Then, on the next Christmas was at noon the time expired—if the remaining twenty thousand dollars was not paid the mine was to revert at once to Carruthers. a mining man and you know how such deals go.
“We paid expenses, and by careful planning got out of the old vein enough more to give Carruthers his five thousand and complete the first payment.
Then, in midsummer, I discovered the new lead. told you about that.
Father and I were afraid that he knew what we had found, would discover some way to void his contract.
If we had been less suspicious, and had kept some of the men to help run in the tunnel, we could have taken out and milled ten times more than we needed to pay Carruthers.
But we were afraid of him.
For that reason we did the work ourselves and kept our golden secret locked up in our own hearts.
Early December came and we had nothing for Carruthers.
Then, in an unlucky moment, father thought of Deane.”
Mariquita paused, fought down her rising emotion, and presently continued.
Father had a passing acquaintance with this—this mining king,’ as they call him.
He believed that we could go to Denver, show Deane our bullion certificates, and get from him as much money as we needed in exchange for a tenth interest in the property.
So we went to Denver. was more than friendlythat is always his way, told, when he’s planning deviltry.
He listened to father, took his bullion certificates, verified them in course of a week, and then asked how we could make such a good showing with a ten-stamp mill on ten-dollar rock.
Father did not let him into our secret, but told him pointblank that after the got the claim hard and fast and he was in for a tenth interest he would be given further light. take care of you, Mallory,’ said Deane.
Those were his very words, Mr. Bremerton. take care of you, Mallory, and donot you lose any sleep.’
Day after day he put us off, reassuring us, luring us on with false hopes, until the 25th of December came.
Carruthers was in Denver at the time.
We surprised him once with Deane on one of our many trips to office.
Oh, we were blind, blind, not to have suspected trickery!
But father had faith in Deane up till ten o’clock that last day.
Jthe girl’s voice quivered in her throat it was then that Deane threw off his mask and curtly told father he had ho money for him, and that he would have to look elsewhere for it.
Look elsewhere!
Where could we look?
We knew no one in Denver but Deane and Carruthers.
I thought father would go crazy.
He grabbed Deane by the throat, and I believe he would have killed him if I hadnot interfered.
Some clerks came and threw father out of that gilded den of crookedness, and we spent hours trying to get the money for Carruthers.
The girl choked and walked up and down the level for a few moments to get control of herself.
Meanwhile,” she finished, Carruthers had transferred the Mariquita Mine to Deane for fifty thousand dollars!
Do you know what this friend of yours did?”
Her eyes flamed, and she leaned toward Bremerton with her face set and strained and her breath coming in short, labored gasps.
This friend of yours, this man who hired you to come down here and make a showing with the mine that would enable him to sell it for half a million, this mean, false-hearted scoundrel had been browbeating Carruthers all the while he had been feeding my father with hopes and promises.
He told Carruthers that the Mariquita Mine was enormously rich, and he declared that if Carruthers would not give him an option on it for fifty thousand dollars he would give my father the money to get it for half that sum.
Carruthers could take his choice.
So far as Carruthers is concerned, I do not think he was much better than Deane.
It was the case of two rogues' plucking an honest old man.
Carruthers must have squirmed.
For him it was either let the mine go to father or to Deane a mine worth half a million, and for which the best he could get was a paltry fifty thousand.
There were high words in that fine office, but Deane had to give in.
Father and I came back to Phoenix, and all we had in the world were a few tools, a few head of horses—and the secret of that rich! vein.
So long as that new vein could not be discovered, the Mariquita Mine was worth little.
Already our work in the gully had been well hidden, but we went by night and made the hiding more secure.
Poor Griggsby hunted until he was worn out, and Lacey, too, searched high and low.
But neither of them suspected the wall of that of containing mineral.
And you had no better luck, Mr. Bremerton.
There are absolutely no mineral indications in or around the gully.
The original claim there was only an outpost for the Mariquita property, anyway.”
Sadness, almost despair, crept into her voice as she proceeded: Father and I went back to our little ranch in the canon.
We watched the developments over in the valley.
We wanted the superintendents Deane sent out here to fail, and we lived in hopes that Deane would at last be forced to come to us and give us a half interest in the property for telling him what we knew.
After a time we discovered that other and secret enemies were fighting Deane, hampering his operations in every conceivable way and seeking to drive him out of the district.
Night after night, while Griggsby was here, the pipe-line was cut; thieving must have been going on in the mill, too, for the bullion output was barely enough for expenses; the mill was set on fire and barely saved; there was discontent among the men; then, on top of all this, Griggsby worried about the lost vein and his inability to make good.
Finally,” and the girl shivered, he paid the penalty for helping Deane.
Lacey was sent down.
He was energetic and able, and he ruled with an iron hand.
But he was not successful.
His best men left, for the Mariquita Mine was getting an evil name on account of Griggsby.
He had to hire the riffraff of the district in order to do any work at all, and that move brought its own troubles.
Father and while all these other enemies of were at work, watched and hoped.
Would Deane give up?.
Would he come to us?
Father heard of a plot against Lacey.
We were both sick of the shooting and the bloodshed, hard though our thoughts were toward that master schemer in Denver.
I sent Lacey a note and asked him to come to our ranch and hear some important news.
He had distrusted us all along.
For all that, though, he started to come to us, and and those others seized that as their chance to strike.
Afterward you appeared.
Some one in Denver a man in office—informed us about that.
You know what we have done and tried to do since you reached the mine, Mr. Bremerton.
This lost lead has been our only weapon in a hard, hopeless, one-sided fight against a powerful and influential man.
Now sob rushed to lips as she said it—“ you know our secret.
Ought I to have let you die rather than bring you here?
Are we—my father and to any consideration at your hands?
I have told you the truth.
Are you for us or .against us?
There, in the dimly lighted level, her face and manner grew all appealing.
With tears running down her cheeks she reached out her hands in mute supplication. eyes wandered to the breast of the level, to that foot-wide streak of bonanza ore which the girl and her father, by the hardest kind of labor, had laid bare.
The superintendent’s ga:ze returned to the slender, beseeching form and tear-stained face in front of him.
He got slowly to his feet.
I shall prove what you say, Miss Mallory,” he answered then in a husky, unnatural voice, and if it is true, as God hears me, I will see that you get your rights!
But you must wait—you must be patient—you must have confidence in me, and— No, no, not that!
Before he could draw back she had flung herself on her knees at his feet, caught one of his hands, and pressed it to her lips. o’hara goes gunning., Bremerton had not been gone an hour from the mine when King, wildly excited, came running to O’Hara.
The Irishman had just climbed to the ore platform on his way into the mill, and the sharp cries of King brought him to a quick aboutface. to pay?” demanded O’Hara, startled by the look and manner of the cyanid expert. horse has come back, O’Hara, and with an empty saddle!
When was this “Just now just this minute!
I ran from the corral to find you. got him, O’Hara!
By George, they’ve got him!
O’Hara took the pipe from his teeth and knocked out the ashes against the side of the mill.
His thick eyebrows lowered over the crisscross eyes and his big, thin-lipped mouth twisted, but with no attempt at speech.
With one hand he groped in his pocket for his tobacco-sack.
With deliberation he filled the bowl, put away the sack, and scratched a match.
Do you hear piped King, failing to understand why he had not created a sensation. horse has come back, and—” Never you mind,” cut in O’Hara in his softest tones; it’s my "business, and not yours, and be seeing to it.
Go to the bunk-house and get Winchester.
Fetch it to the corral after makin’ sure there are loads in it.”
Why—” shilly-shally.
This is no time for whys.
On the jump now.”
O’Hara thrust his head through the opening that led to the ore-loft and shouted for Giles.
The battery man came bounding up the steps.
Giles, called away,” said O’Hara, and until I come back you’ll be doin’ the amalgamating along with the rest of it.”
Sure.” a cracked shoe in No. battery.
Keep your eye on it.”
I will.” struck another match, trailed it over his pipe-bowl, and jumped from the ore platform.
The pipe was going under forced draft as he hurried in the direction of the corral. horse, still restive, stood with the looped reins thrown over a corral-post.
The saddle swung underneath, the stirrups resting on the ground.
Not so bad maybe,” muttered O’Hara.
“The saddle turned with him, and it’s possible he’s had no more than a spill.
Whoa, Basham!” he added, stepping to the horse and beginning to readjust the riding-gear.
By the time King reached the corral O’Hara had the reins off the post and was mounted and waiting."* loaded,” the little expert fluttered, handing the gun to O’Hara.
“Good enough! not going alone to look for Bremerton?”
“Not?
Watch me!
Keep a still tongue between your teeth, King, and look after the work. be back when I get here.”
He dug in with his heels.
The excited horse snorted and reared, and then was off like an arrow along the trail.
King watched the long body humped over the saddle horn until horse and rider had vanished over the rise.”
The mill began to pound, and the pounding gradually merged into a long, continuous roar.
The expert tossed his hands helplessly and apprehensively, and turned back toward the office. the beginning of the end,” he muttered, but hanged if I stay here while some one else comes to take place! had enough of this, goodness knows! thoughts were busy.
It was clear Bremerton had not gone far before the saddle turned with himthe riderless horse had been too quick in getting back to the mine.
No doubt it was this side of the canon that Bremerton had taken his fall.
As soon as he was over the side of the hill O’Hara pulled the horse down to a slower pace.
His eyes focused on the trail and keenly watched it as he proceeded.
The dust was fetlock deep and he knew it would show signs.
He found what he was looking for near the place where the trail forked.
The marks were as clear as words in an open book.
First, there was a clutter of hoofprints.
Running through them was a broad streak as though a heavy bag had been dragged at the end of a rope.
Then, too, the horse pricked up its ears and seemed to have fears in that particular place. face hardened.
Begorrv,” he murmured, it’s worse than I thought.
Lee was thrown and dragged straight into the swale if the marks donot lie, ajid this mount on is the one that snaked him along.
How did he get loose?
And if he got loose and is all right, why donot I meet him?
I wonder if going to see something in that swale that I donot want to see?”
The horse trembled and did not want to go into the swale.
O’Hara forced the animal, and as they moved along the bushes gave mute evidence of progress through them.
Near the spot where the torn and disordered chaparral ceased to show further signs O’Hara found a horse, patiently standing with the reins drooping from the bit-rings.
Unless the Irishman was greatly mistaken that waiting horse belonged to Mariquita Mallory.
At once his mind was flooded with puzzling questions.
Guess as hard as he would, however, he could make nothing of that odd situation there in the swale.
Dropping the reins of his own mount, he slid to the ground and began beating up the brush.
He found nothing at all, and this was a sort of negative satisfaction.
Just as he had about finished his searching a dull report clashed on his ears, a bit of lead whispered, and the brim of his hat twitched.
“So that’s the way of it!” he exclaimed, and let go with the Winchester from the hip.
His ears were keen even if his eyesight could not serve, and a heavy slug whistled toward the point from which the shot had been fired at him.
A cry broke from the depths of the brush.
O’Hara located the point on the swale bank and hastened toward it.
When, as near as he could judge, he came to the spot he saw no one.
Save for the murmuring of the stamp-mill the swale was steeped in deathly silence.
Faith, this is a brain twister! muttered O’Hara, rearing head and shoulders above the bushes and peering about him.
Show yourselves, you imps of the Old Nick! he cried.
Or come again with a shot so I may be after locatin’ you!
His invitation was not accepted.
No form materialized out of the depths of the chaparral, and there was no more firing.
Now, what would you think of that?” soliloquized the Irishman, removing his hat and surveying the hole through the brim.
Sure I touched up the omadhoun that gave me the souvenir, but where in the name of the saints is he Whisht! he added abruptly, listening.
He heard something.
Whatever it was it was feeble, and the faint murmuring of the mill almost drowned it.
Clapping the hat on his head, he proceeded on over the swale-bank, pausing and straining his ears at every other step.
His course brought him to the brink of the gully.
His gaze, running along the abrupt break in the earth, rested wonderingly on the end of a rope.
The rope was tied to a scraggy ironwood growing near the brink, and was hanging over the cliff’s face.
O’Hara laid aside the gun, dropped to his knees, and looked downward.
Then he gave an exclamation.
Near, the bottom of the swinging rope, a yard from the base of the wall, lay the motionless form of a man.
But it was not Bremerton; no, not Bremerton!
O’Hara breathed again.
Is it the blackguard who shot at me?” thought the Irishman.
“Did my bullet drop him over the edge, or was he going down the rope and did he fall?”
It was a matter for immediate investigation.
O’Hara went to the ironwood, sat down with his heels over space, twisted his long legs in the rope, took the Winchester under his arm, and began to slide.
Hampered with the gun, he made awkward work of it, but reached the foot of the wall safely.
The prostrate form, lying limply and with arms thrown wide from the shoulders, proved to be a man whom O’Hara had never seen before.
His hat lay at a little distance, and his hair was dark and streaked with gray.
A stubble of beard covered his cheeks and chin.
His eyes were closed.
He was plainly unconscious, although a groan was now and then wrenched from his tense lips.
No shot of mine touched him,” muttered O’Hara after an examination.
He fell from the wall, and that’s the whole of it.
Was he or was he not the fellow who cut loose at me with that bullet?
And how, in the fiend’s name, is he mixed up with Bremerton and Mariquita Mallory?
Sure, staggered with what I know and donot know.”
The clothing of the injured man was rather better than that usually worn by miners.
A Mexican carved-leather band was around his hat, and at his waist was a belt with a holster and a heavy navy revolver.
His hands, although browned from exposure, gave no evidence of hard labor.
Here was a mystery, and O’Hara hated mysteries.
Yet he was compelled to grapple with this one, for it seemed to bear directly upon what had happened to Bremerton.
He tried to arouse the stranger, for a few words from him would go far toward clearing up the situation.
His efforts failed and he rose to his feet in perplexity.
While he stood there, cudgeling his brain, he was electrified by a shout from across the gully.
Whirling on the instant, he was amazed and overjoyed to see Bremerton coming toward him.
And behind Bremerton was Miss Mallory.
He advanced to meet them. hat was gone and his clothes were dusty and tom and in much disorder.
All the indications pointed to a desperate experience of some sort on his part.
The sight o’ you does my eyes good, Bremerton! cried O’Hara.
I was not expecting to find you with your feet under you, but down and out somewhere in the scrub.
Your horse came back to the mine without you, and the saddle in such shape that I knew you had had a spill.
Troth, man, but glad things are no worse.
Miss Mallory,” and he smiled and doffed his hat, seeing you is a surprise and a pleasure.
I found your horse in the swale, though, so I ought not to be surprised.”
Miss Mallory saved my life,” began Bremerton, and—” Och, the luck you have!” smiled the Irishman; “not that your life is saved, do you mind, but that Miss Mallory saved it for you.
But if there’s saving to do, she is the kind to be depended upon.
Now, can you tell me who is the man at the foot of the wall O’Hara turned and pointed toward the crumpled heap of humanity.
The girl stared, smothered an exclamation of horror, then ran forward.
When Bremerton and O’Hara came to her side she turned a white face to them.
Stranger to me,” commented Bremerton.
Is he to you.
Miss Mallory No,” she answered in a strained voice.
I have seen the man several times, Mr. Bremerton.”
Her eyes wandered to the rope, followed it down, and rested again on the sprawled-out form.
He is Dave Carruthers,” she added.
A Carruthers!
To O’Hara that name meant little.
To Bremerton and the girl, time and place considered, it was deeply significant. glance sought face, and he read there a‘reflection of his own thoughts.
Here was wily and implacable foe.
Here was the man who, bullied into selling the mine for a tithe of its value, had striven to regain by lawless methods what he had lost by legal sharp practise.
He had fallen from the rope while lowering himself into the gully.
There seemed no doubt of that.
A hard fate had finally unmasked him.
Bremerton knelt and made a hasty examination.
He got up, shaking his head ominously.
“If I am any judge, he is close to the end of his trail,” said he.
Miss Mallory and I heard shooting, O’Hara,” he went on.
Were you concerned in it O’Hara explained.
He fell from the rope,” hazarded Bremerton, and those with him were frightened away.
I think the way is clear for us now.
We must get Carruthers to the mine.
If possible, he must be revived so he can talk.
Miss Mallory, you can climb out of here by means of the rope Yes,” she answered, and started toward the wall.
Wait, please,” interposed Bremerton.
O’Hara should go first with the rifle.
That will guard against possible surprises.
If the horses afe still there, O’Hara, when I am ready here, you can hitch the upper end of the rope to a saddle.”
The Irishman nodded and climbed the rope readily enough.
Bremerton tied the gun to the dangling end, and it was drawn rapidly upward.
When the rope was thrown down again, Mariquita made the ascent, watched anxiously by Bremerton.
There was no call for anxiety.
With strength and skill the girl drew herself from crevice to projecting stone the full length of the wall, and was helped over the brink by O’Hara.
Bremerton then dragged Carruthers closer to the wall, tied the rope snugly under his arms, and called to O’Hara to hoist away.
The limp, twisting body rose gruesomely in the air, and Mariquita caught it at the top of the wall, and by main strength drew it over the ledge.
Finally the rope was thrown back to Bremerton, and he won to the crest with little difficulty.
Both horses were in the swale.
Get into the saddle, Mike,” said Bremerton. lift Carruthers up to you, and you can support him in front of you for the little distance we have to go. walk.”
He turned to the girl while O’Hara was mounting.
Miss Mallory,” he went on, will you ride to Phoenix and send out a doctor and the sheriff?
I want to do anything—everything can,” she answered.
This is all we can do now.
Remember what I told you,” he finished earnestly; and, whatever happens, do not doubt me.”
There was a pathetic curve to her lips as she looked at him trustingly and smiled.
I could not leave the fortunes of the Mallory^ in better hands, Mr. Bremerton,” said she and hurried away to her horse.
She was away at speed while Bremerton and O’Hara were attending to Carruthers.
It was a slow journey they had back to the mine, but they reached their destination and had the injured man in bed long before the noon whistle sounded from the mill.
Neither Bremerton nor O’Hara had done any talking on the return journey.
King, who hurried to the office, did enough talking for half a dozen.
Carruthers!
What in goodness’ name was the matter with him?”
What had happened to Bremerton?
Was he rescued by O’Hara?
The superintendent wearily parried the expert’s questions.
All in due time, King,” said he, you’ll know everything. sent for a doctor.
Just now, though, you might help O’Hara try to bring Carruthers around. got to fix up a little.”
Bremerton attended to his bruises and scratches, and went through with his fixing up.
When he had finished, Carruthers was no nearer consciousness than he had been before. obstinate about getting back to earth,” O’Hara reported.
“Faith, it’s a doctor’s job, or the undertaker’s, and we’ll have to wait.
Why did you send for the sheriff, Lee? important for him to be here in case Carruthers revives and has anything to say.” got me guessing.
Why the importance?
King had gone his wondering way.
Bremerton and O’Hara sat by the bed, watching the injured man closely.
It was high time O’Hara understood the drift of affairs, and Bremerton gave him his full confidence.
The struggle Mariquita and her father had gone through with Deane, treachery to them, and his covert bullying of Carruthers were bluntly stated.
An angry red rushed into the face and hi^eyes gleamed as he listened.
You got all that from lips that couldnot lie!” he exclaimed when his friend finished.
What have you to say to it?
I want more proof that Deane is the unscrupulous devil the girl has painted him.”
Oh, but you can strain at a point!
Where are you to get this proof Bremerton nodded toward Carruthers. furnish it.”
"If he’s ever able to talk, he may. nothing certain.”
Then get the proof from Deane.”
How In my own way,” said Bremerton, gazing out of the window.
O’Hara hoisted around in his chair and peered at his friend through narrowing eyes.
And if you get this proof,” he queried, what will you do Throw a thousand dollars of dirty money in his face,” snapped Bremerton.
That much he has paid me, and you have made it possible to give it back.
Then go further, by Heaven! and see that the Mallorys get what they’re entitled to.”
Fine! exclaimed O’Hara.
Glory be, ’tis the finest thing in life to see a good man get right with himself.
I knew it would come!
You can throw the money in face if you will, although I doubt the sense of that; but you’ll never get the Mallorys their rights.
Deane has gone to school for his bunco games, and you donot know your A abs about the dirty work.
Lock horns with him on that point, Bremerton, and both you and the Mallorys will get the worst of it.”
The mill whistle blew.
The clamor of the stamps died to silence and a general movement set in toward the chuckshanty.
Bremerton remained with Carruthers' while O’Hara went for his meal; then O’Hara relieved Bremerton.
When the latter returned to the office he was surprised to find the Irishman with the contents of pockets on a table in front of him.
When you’re looking for evidence,” explained O’Hara, personal belongings are common property.
Now here’s this solid-framed forty-fivecaliber Colt.
Three empty shells in the cylinder.
One load just missed you at the fork of the trail, thanks to the road-runner; another raked the bushes while you and Mariquita were getting out of the swale; the other, maybe, put that hole in my hat.” guesswork, Mike,” returned Bremerton.
Close to the mark, though.
If you ask for a motive, isnot there a good one to tack onto Carruthers?
When rogues fall out the divil gets his dues. a watch with a nugget fob.
The hands quit telling the time at seven twenty-five. when he dropped.
And here’s a note-book with interesting readin’, Lee.”
O’Hara picked up a small memorandum-book and turned the leaves.
Listen to this, will you.
To Pennyworth, on account of Bryden and the half-breed, Pennyworth Bremerton pricked up his ears.
Pennyworth is the lawyer who had charge of Big and fight in court,” said he.
Is there anything more Not a scrap; and this must have got in by mistake.
Now you know who financed the defense for those blackguards and who’s paying pensions for hush-money.
I guess this is proof enough, even if Carruthers is never able to speak a word.”
Bremerton went out into the other room and, for a whole hour, tramped the floor.
O’Hara knew that his loyalty for Deane was dying hard.
At the end of the hour an automobile dashed up to the headquarters adobe and the doctor and the sheriff sprang out.
Dr. Morton, Bremerton,” said Ransom.
What does all this mean find your man in there, doctor,” observed the superintendent, nodding toward the bedroom.
We have Dave Carruthers, and he’s badly hurt and unable to-talk. know more about what it all means if we can get some information from him.”
Carruthers!
He has always been a wildcatter, and none too strong on the moral points.”
Ransom took off his hat and knocked the dust out of it.
He slipped out of sight a few months ago, and I thought he had left the country.
Was he—shot No.
There was a rope over a cliff and he was found unconscious at the lower end of it.”
Bremerton was in for some more explaining, but he was tactful and said nothing about the overhang, the lost vein, or account of her father’s dealings with Deane.
The superintendent’s recital hinged upon the shooting at the fork of the trail, his accident, the rescue by the girl, and the coming of O’Hara.
The sheriff muttered an exclamation and thumped a fist into his palm.
By gorry, we’re on the track at last! he declared.
Carruthers, and not the Mallorys, has been picking this bone with Deane.
Mallory isnot the one to hide out and go sniping for this mine’s superintendents.
But Carruthers could do it without the flicker of an eyelash. getting “down to cases now.”
Bremerton got the note-book and showed Ransom the entry regarding money paid to Pennyworth on account of Big Steve and Chombo.
That cinches it! averred the sheriff.
He was back of that crowd, and he wouldnot separate himself from good money without a reason.”
Dr. Morton came out of the bedroom.
He had shed his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeves. the word, Morton queried Ransom. done for,” was the reply.
Mangled as he is, I canot understand how he has lived as long as this.”
“Will he recover consciousness?
Do you think—” O’Hara showed himself suddenly at the bedroom door and beckoned.
The doctor hurriedly returned to Carruthers and Bremerton and Ransom followed.
The eyes of the injured man were wide open.
After wandering from, face to face they came to a rest on the sheriff’s. too late.
Ransom,” said Carruthers faintly. fooled you for months, and now off on the long trail and fooling you for good.
Bremerton was more than I bargained for; and yet came within one of getting him.
He—” The voice failed.
While O’Hara lifted head, the doctor picked up a glass from the table and put it to his lips.
Get a pencil and paper, Bremerton,” said Ransom, and take this down.” strength rallied under the stimulant.
There was that in his eyes, however, which told the others unmistakably it could not be for long.
He began to talk as soon as had laid him down, and it was' all around the few points which the sheriff wished to have made clear.
I feel as though there wasnot a whole bone in my body,” moaned Carruthers.
“Why couldnot I go out without realizin’ what had happened?
What did you bring me back for, when I was slippin’ away so easy Now the black horror is gripping me by the throat, scared of it, men, scared of it.
I ainot old! that’s all.
And here crossin’ the divide with the best of my life ahead of me! seized him.
His face hardened like stone and his dull eyes smoldered.
Clenching his fists, he broke into gasping torrents of words whose import sickened those who listened.
Ransom laid a muffling hand over his mouth.
In name, Carruthers,” said he, remember where you are.
You havenot long to stay. pass out with curses on your lips!
Let your final act go toward undoing some of the wrong.”
He bent down so that he could look in the feverish eyes.
Tell me about Griggsby,” he added. why you’re here, eh snarled Carruthers.
Well, you might have saved yourself the trouble.
Not a word about anything.
I fought for my own against that black-hearted Deane.' won and lost! barter my soul for one year more of life—just a year.”
He fell to raving again.
O’Hara got up and passed into the other room.
Returning softly with the flute, he sat down by the head of the bed and began to play.
It was the intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana.”
Never had Bremerton heard O’Hara play as he played then.
The tender melody floated about the room, and there went with it a rustling as of unseen wings.
Ransom stood like a man entranced.
Morton pulled down his sleeves and walked to the window.
Bremerton bowed over his pencil and paper, weirdly thrilled by the pathos and the pleading of those whispering notes.
The twisted lines straightened in face.
He fell silent.
Presently his eyes closed and he lay still.
O’Hara made an end of the music and laid the flute on his knees.
God! breathed Carruthers, opening his eyes. heard that before, somewhere.
What piece was that?
Only a bit of an air to make you see things differently,” said O’Hara.
It does that for me and, by the same token, I thought it might for you.”
For a second Carruthers lay thinking.
Then he turned his head so he could look at the Irishman.
Play it again,” he begged.
Sure, and as long as you please, but not till you’ve talked with Ransom.”
I want to know about Griggsby, Carruthers,” spoke up the sheriff.
What you say can do you no harm.”
Blame nobody but me for what happened to Griggsby and Lacey,” said Carruthers.
The rest of the boys had nothin’ to do with' it.
I went farther with Griggsby than I meant to, and that’s the truth.
I knew Mallory had struck something rich at the Mariquita, and I wanted him to lose.
I asked Deane to help me beat Mallory out, and he said he would keep him dangling until the last minute, and then turn him down cold.
So he did, but not uniil he had got me with my back to the wall.
It was either sell out to Mallory for the twenty-five thousand or to Deane at double that.
He had me, and he knew it; but I swore he would never get any good from the mine until he deeded me a half interest.
That is what I was fighting for, Ransom!
For that I laid low in the hills, fighting the work at the Mariquita.
I did whatever I could to make Deane sick of his bargain, and to force him to come to me.
I know have had him, too, if it hadnot been for Bremerton. girl got Bremerton away from us.
I tried to follow them into the gully and find out where they went, but—but I slipped from the rope as some one fired at my men in the swale. voice died in his throat.
He looked at O’Hara and his lips framed a silent word.
Ransom nodded to O’Hara, then went to Bremerton, took the hastily scrawled transcript and read it over while the flute’s music once more throbbed through the room.
Over and over, while the tide ebbed, O’Hara breathed the Intermezzo into the dead wood and warmed it into life.
The doctor, watching Carruthers, finally went to the bedside and bent down to touch his wrist.
That will be all,” said the doctor to O’Hara; he’s past hearing you.”
The sheriff had cracked the shell of a troublesome mystery.
His professional satisfaction was jarred, a bit in-' congruously, by a sentiment perfectly human and somewhat awkward. the way like to go out myself, when I have to,” he murmured. got a melodeon to home.
Give me the name of that piece, O’Hara, so I can have my daughter learn it.”
O’Hara, with pity in his pale eyes, stood looking down at Carruthers.
Faith,” said he, there’s good in the worst of us and bad in the best of us, and there’s some hope for the man who goes beyond with the love o’ music in his soul.”
He laid the hands on the breast and gently drew the blanket over the face. but cogs in the wheel, anyway,” he added, and the machine keeps running even if a cog here and there is not what it ought to be.”
Come out in the other room, all of you,” requested the sheriff, while I read what Bremerton took down. fresh in your minds, you know, and I want you to sign as witnesses.”
They grouped about Ransom in the office and listened while he read.
After that each set his hand to the document. a black spot cleared up,” went on Ransom.
Beats all I never thought of Carruthers in this matter of Griggsby.
But that’s the way.
The plain truth is so plain, sometimes, we’re apt to dodge it.”
He turned to Bremerton.
Thanks to you, Bremerton, from this on Deane will have clear sailing.
Do you know. blamed glad of one thing.” that?” inquired Bremerton.
Why, that the Mallorys had no hand in the lawlessness out here.
There was a spell when it looked dark for them.
No objection to havingthat nodded toward the bedroom here until I can get the undertakers out?”
Certainly not.”
“Then suppose we hike, Morton?” be ready in a minute, Ransom,” said the doctor.
He went to the end of the pipe-line and washed his hands.
When he had returned to thq office and slipped into his coat, the sheriff had the machine ready.
Bremerton, meanwhile, had picked up a pad of telegraph blanks and written the following: Silas Deane, Denver.
Have cleaned up on the other crowd and located bonanza vein on Mariquita property.
Important you come on at once.
Notify and will meet you He went out of the office and handed the message to the sheriff.
Send that for me, will you, Ransom he asked.
Let it go collect.”
Glad to oblige,” 'said the sheriff.
Will get it on the wires as soomas I hit town.”
Bremerton and O’Hara watched the car vanish over the rise in the trail; jand then the Irishman, after a long look at his friend, turned on his heel and moved off toward the mill.
The news spread through the camp that Carruthers, the man who had located the mine and added to his holdings until they embraced the whole valley and the neighboring hills, had gone his way and was lying in the headquarters adobe.
When the day men came off duty and the night men went on, all eyes sought the little office building, awed and curious.
The same eyes presently Shifted to Bremerton and paid him a tribute of respect and high consideration.
Carruthers represented the evil powers that had skulked in the hills, fighting men savagely and murderously.
With Carruthers, those powers had been laid low, and all the credit was given to Bremerton.
A better spirit manifested itself among the workers.
In the evening Bremerton and O’Hara carried their chairs out of the office and sat by the door.
The Irishman fluted the airs dearest to his heart and the other smoked reflectively.
By and by the flute was laid aside and O’Hara himself filled a pipe and blew fragrant wreaths into the still air. wired for Deane,” announced the superintendent.
There was no demonstration from O’Hara.
Leaning back against the adobe wall he puffed serenely at his pipe.
I say I have sent for Deaneasked him to come on immediately,” repeated Bremerton.
I knew you’d do that, or go to Denver, one or the other,” said O’Hara.
“What will you do, Lee?”
What would you do, Mike Divil knows. expecting, though, that you’ll keep your head and be sensible.
None of the Lee Reckless in your accounting with Deane, man.
You were to blame, along at the first, by getting into this so easy. forget that.”
Carruthers,” mused Bremerton, “got only what was coming to him.
His fight with Deane was a case of diamond cut diamond, and, right or wrong, wouldnot have been strained whichever way the cards fell.
But, between the two of them, the Mallorys were crushed and beaten and flung to the scrap-heap.
The rights most to be considered were not considered at all. the point that involves and concerns— me!
I took word and helped him rob the Mallorys of what was justly theirs.” weighed heavily in the words.
The wrath of a man who had all his life tried to be square, only to have a friend besmirch his ideals and sully his honor, swirled in the tones of voice.
After all, Lee,” said O’Hara soothingly, ’tis no crime you’ve done.
You stepped aside in taking say-so, when you should have gone under the surface indications.
We all do that same, more or less.
When we’re in wrong, the part of a wise man is to retire gracefully and in order.
Which is the same as saying with as little trouble as possible.
In. my opinion, the Mallorys are beyond help, so far as this mine is concerned.” see about that! and face hardened and his teeth clicked on his pipe-stem. not take my advice, I know, in your present temper; but, so help me, be around, and have a hand in what happens if you go too far.
Mind that.”
At that juncture a long, black wagon rolled along the trail, turned, and came to a halt in front of the office.
Two men got down from the seat and one approached Bremerton.
“Mr. Bremerton?”
“Yes.”
The sheriff sent us out.”
Come with me,” said Bremerton, and led the way into the office. was next day that i. man rode out from town with an answer to message.
Shake.
Knew you’d turn the trick.'
Meet me Phoenix Friday morning.
The superintendent smiled grimly.
Deane was coming, and he was destined to receive a few surprises—not all of them pleasant.
On Thursday afternoon Bremerton sent to the bunk-house for Gorman, the night amalgamator.
This millman was the key to some things which the superintendent wanted to know.
Gorman usually slept in the forenoon and loafed in the afternoon. messenger found him, and he came straight to the office.
He was a rat-eyed, weasel-faced little man whose main object in life seemed to be to keep out of sight.
The most devious way between two points was the shortest for Gorman.
He entered the office so silently that Bremerton did not know he was there until he was seen beside the desk.
On deck, Mr. Bremerton,” said Gorman nervously.
Sit down,” said the superintendent.
The millman cuddled into a chair and looked about him shiftily.
He had the air of one who was expecting something disagreeable to happen.
“If you’re under the impression, Gorman, that I donot know you’re a thief, you are mistaken.”
The quiet, conversational tone was weirdly out of harmony with the sentiment expressed. manner disarmed Gorman for a moment, and then, when the burden of the words had sunk in, he bristled angrily.
Nobody can talk to me like that, by gorry!
Insults like them I never stood for and never will. my time.” be a fool,” returned Bremerton.
You know that, if you had your deserts, you’d have been caught in the same net that snared Big Steve and Chombo.
While Steve was here, you turned in no more amalgam than he did; since he’s been gone, you’ve been turning in three times as much as you did before.
I was pretty sure you were stealing, but I had no time to bother with you.
Now that you’re evidently playing fair, I have no inclination to make you trouble.
All I want you to do is to talk.”
Some men with a guilty conscience can bluff successfully.
Gorman was not one of that kind.
For long he had been afraid he was suspected.
I ainot admitting a thing,” said Gorman but what do you want me to talk about Where were you on the night I reached Phoenix King was in charge here, and somebody had brought a supply of whisky into camp.
Not much work was going on.
I guess you remember.”
The millman wriggled uncomfortably.
I donot get you at all,” he answered.
I been at the Mariquita right along.” hem and haw and side-step,” returned Bremerton. not intending to take any action against you. be more kindly disposed, however, if you come out square-toed and tell me what you know.
Were you and Big Steve directly connected with Carruthers Gorman took a. red cotton handkerchief from his pocket and drew it across his face.
He was undergoing an ordeal, and showed it. straight now, Mr. Bremerton,” he whimpered. tryin’ to do what’s right.
You ainot going to put me through if I tell the truth?
No.”
Do I get .fired Not so long as you keep straight.”
Well, then, Chombo worked with Carruthers, and Big Steve worked with Chombo, and I worked with Steve. the gospel of it, and kiss the Book.
I didnot want to go in on it.
Backed away from the propersition for quite a spell.
Steve allowed, though, that they was going to get their toll of amalgam from the night shift, and if I didnot come over, then some night turn up missin’ and there’d be an amalgamator in my place they could depend on.
I was scared into it, Mr. Bremerton; that’s all.”
Who disposed of the amalgam Chombo got it to Carruthers, and he turned it into cash.
We all got our whack, and it was purty profitable.
When Chombo had the pin pulled on him, Steve sneaked the stuff out of camp.
But I reckon you know about that.”
Have you any idea why the stuff jvas cached at Oak Flat?
It wasnot always cached there; Chombo picked out that place.”
“Why?”
I donot know only what I heard 'from Big Steve.”
What did you hear Why, that if you found out anythin’, Carruthers wanted to make it look bad for the Mallorys.” murmured Bremerton and sat back in his chair.
Following a moment's reflection, he went on: “Who left the Mariquita Mine that night the crowd beat me up at the Phoenix townditch?”
“Not me,” said Gorman hastily; I wasnot among ’em.”
“Was Steve Bryden in the gang?
No.
Steve was jest gittin’ busy yvith the likker.
I heard that Chombo was with that outfit. purty sure no one else from the camp had a hand in the doings.” ball of amalgam was dropped by one of the crowd.”
Then it was Chombo dropped it.
He was holdin’ out a little on Carruthers right along.”
Thus one dark point was cleared up.
Bremerton believed that the fellow he had knocked into the canal was Chombo.
“What men did Carruthers have with him out in the hills?
Do you know that, Gorman?”
They was men who had been bounced from the mine.
Griggsby let one or two go, and Lacey ditched the others.
Carruthers gathered ’em in, and they was more than willin’ to help him.
He made it worth their while.”
Where are those men now?
Why, when Carruthers went out them fellers began to run—and I allow they’re still a runnin’.
You can gamble a blue stack they wonot show up around here no more, Mr. Bremerton.”
I canot think of anything else, Gorman,” said the. superintendent. in luck to come out of that amalgam deal as well as you have.
Keep that in mind.
That will be all.”
The millman arose and passed softly toward the door.
He halted there for a final word. to stay on and have no trouble?
So long as you do the right thing, Gorman, you neednot worry.”
I know in luck, and standin’ pat on an honest deal.
Much obliged to you, Mr. Bremerton.”
He faded out of the office, and the superintendent was positive that the fangs of last enemy had been drawn.
From that time on there would be only clear sailing for those in charge of the Mariquita Mine.
Everything was propitious for that final accounting with Deane.
Thursday afternoon Bremerton had Dutch Fred put a pair of cayuses to the pole of the mine buckboard.
When the rig was ready, and the superintendent was about to climb into it for the ride to Phoenix, O’Hara came down from the mill. off after Deane, Bremerton? asked the Irishman.
Yes,” was the answer. reach Phoenix in the morning, and I intend to bring the rest of this business to a close in short order.”
A worried look crossed face. not your plan, is it, to do anything in Phoenix or on the way out he continued.
There had been something that Bremerton had wanted to say to his friend for several days.
Here was a good time for it.
Mike, you’re not my guardian.
No man could ask for a better friend, but there is a dead line which even a friend cannot cross without making trouble.
My business with Deane is my own affair, and going to handle it in my own way without let or hindrance from you. meddle.
Keep hands off.” not let that hot head of yours take you to the divil entirely,” flared O’Hara.
So help me, not have you doing time for roughing it with a yellow dog like Deane.
Smoke that in your pipe.”
O’Hara turned back to the mill.
Bremerton stared after him speculatively, then climbed into the buckboard and drove away.
At the fork in the trail he was surprised to find Mariquita mounted on her horse and evidently waiting for him.
She rode out into the road ahead of his team.
“You have asked Deane to come here! she exclaimed.
It was necessary,” he returned.
You get your information direct from Denver, I suppose?”
You already know, Mr. Bremerton, that we have a friend in Denver office.
Why, why have you done this She spoke vehemently, passionately, and clearly was doubtful of motives.
I told you, Miss Mallory, that you would have to trust me,” he said calmly.
You are not doing it.”
You have sent for Deane to show him that—that lost lead Yes.
I want him to understand that the work he gave me to do has been accomplished.”
How will that help us? she cried.
By showing him how valuable the mine is, how are you going to benefit my father and me I have my plans.
You know Deane pretty well, and I guess you realize that what I have ahead of me is anything but child’s play.
I am going to do what I can.
That, Miss Mallory, is all any man can do.
Are you going to lose confidence in me She rode alongside the buckboard and leaned sidewise to offer her hand.
No,” she said softly and with a wan smile, for you are the only one who can do anything with Deane.
Help us, and it will be worth your while.
If you win an interest for us in the property, I have come to tell you that a part of it will be yours.”
He dropped the hand as though a serpent had stung him.
You know me very well,” he answered.
I canot be bribed, Miss Mallory, and sorry you thought so.”
He picked up the lines and drove on.
Until he was out of sight the girl sat motionless in the saddle, looking after him.
Bremerton had work that evening in Phoenix.
He called on a lawyer and had a certain paper filled out and made ready for signing.
On his way back to the hotel he stepped into a hardware store and bought a small revolver to take the place of the automatic he had lost.
The dealer wanted to sell him a box of cartridges.
Bremerton, however, did not buy.
I want is the revolver,” he said.
With the legal paper in the breast of his coat and the unloaded revolver in his hip-pocket, he retraced his way to the hotel.
The train from the north was due at seven o’clock.
It rolled up to the station promptly on time, and Deane was the last passenger to get out of the Pullman.
The porter obsequiously handed him a black Boston bag, receiving in exchange for it a silver dollar.
The mining king was a picturesque figure as he came down the platform.
His black Stetson, long-tailed coat, and flowing tie compelled attention.
A wonderful diamond sparkled in the white frills of his shirt and a massive chain wriggled across the front of his low-cut vest.
Another stone, conspicuous for size and brilliancy, was very much in evidence on the third finger of his left hand.
Good living and lack of exercise had doubled his girth since the prospecting days with Bremerton.
His walk was the cautious, flat-footed waddle of the fat man, although he carried it off with a touch of distinction. .
All in all, he was a most impressing spectacle.
It was plain that he knew it, and equally plain that he liked it.
His money had brought with it power and influence, and no man was more in the Western lime-light.
The reporters for three different newspapers had reached him ahead of Bremerton.
They wanted interviews.
Blamed if I can travel a dozen miles out of Denver without having a bunch of you cimarrons tight at my heels,” he complained good-naturedly.
Now, boys, I havenot a pesky thing for you to put in the papers.
Maybe have news for you before I leave.
If I have, I promise to herd you all together, treat every one fair, and not play favorites.
Try one of these, will you, and just forget in town till ready to loosen up.”
He drew a silver-mounted cigarcase from the breast of his coat and offered it around.
Then he caught sight of Bremerton.
Howdy, pard! he cried, breaking away from the newspapermen, dropping his satchel and grabbing the tall, gaunt figure in corduroys with both hands.
You done it, by thunder, and ’way this side of the six months!
Lee, you’re the clear quill.
Looking finer’n silk, too.
What did I say, huh?
Did I know what I was doing, or didnot I a cab? go to the hotel and sit in at the chuck-table. hungrier’n a Ute squaw on government rations.”
Bremerton picked up the satchel, Deane hooked arms with him, and they went on to the waiting line of carriages.
A little later they were being hurried to the best hotel in town, Deane talking effusively and giving his friend no chance for a word.
There was the plaza, same old court-house plaza, where he and Bremerton had sat in the shade years ago, wondering where they would strike for next.
Yes, and, by gorry, there was the same identical umhrella tree they had sat under. it beat all how the old times came back?
Below the corner of First Avenue was the wall of the town corral where they had kept their burros; and saywouldnot it rattle your there was Coffee where they had spent many a quarter for grub.
Good grub, too; better grub than any Deane had ever had since or, anyhow, it tasted better.
I guess it’s a sure-enough fact, Lee,” philosophized Deane, that the more money you got to spend for things, the less you appreciate ’em.
Oh, them sure was good days!
The mining king sat back into his coat and relapsed into a mood of flabby and morbid reminiscence.
He came out of it shortly and dropped a fat, friendly hand on knee.
Why donot you tune up, old partner he asked.
I donot reckon you’ve peeped since we got together.”
The recollection of old times, when Deane was different and a comrade worth having, had wrenched hard at the purpose Bremerton had in mind.
He brushed the feeling aside and looked into his friend’s face with a smile. been holding my tongue and listening to you, Silas,” he answered.
Not much chance for me to put in a word when you get started.” right, I guess that’s right,” and Deane chuckled.
This is a regular picnic for me.
Old scenes, old friends, and a pot of money into the bargain.
Enough to make a fellow grow young and feel his oats, eh They got down at the hotel and Deane handed the black bag to a waiting boy.
Careful with that, son,” he warned. two pint bottles of old Scotch in that grip, and if anything happens- to ’em ruined.”
Deane wrote his name on the register.
He began placing under it, but the latter protested. booked at another hotel,” said he. going to be booked at this one, too. going to have breakfast together.” already had breakfast.”
Why didnot you wait Dash it, you’re treating me like a hired man more than a pard. eat again, that’s all.” name went down, and Deane insisted that he accompany him up to his room.
The black bag was opened, and Deane pulled out a flannel shirt, a slouch hat, a pair of khaki trousers, and a pair of laced kneeboots.
He laughed like a boy as he showed the outfit.
Bet your life, old pard, I brought my war clothes along.
After I eat going to get into ’em, and you and me will go pottering off into the hills same as we used to.
Great!
It wonot be hardly the same, Si,” said Bremerton.
Instead of walking and driving our pack-burros we’ll ride in a buckboard.” they got any automobiles in this man’s town Automobiles are a cultivated taste, and the superintendent at the Mariquita canot afford so much style. only a counterfeit at this oldtime game, Deane.
Two days of the old life would kill you.”
Maybe you’re right.
Help yourself to this—every swig is warranted to take ten years off your shoulders. prime.
A man in Denver gets it for me special.”
Bremerton did not drink.
He wanted a clear Jiead while he was with Deane.
While his back was turned he unscrewed the cap and let it go at that.
Deane faced around, took the flask out of his hands, and helped himself generously.
In a few minutes they went down to breakfast together.
Deane raided the bill of fare while Bremerton contented himself with a cup of coffee and griddle-cakes.
Not much was said about the mine.
It was a subject for private discussion, and that dining-room was altogether too public a place.
After the meal Bremerton left Deane to get into his war clothes and went after the team and buckboard.
It was ten o’clock before they took the trail into the hills.
Now,” remarked Deane, when they had left the town well behind them, we can get down to cases, Lee. pleased me a heap the way you’ve managed things.
Old Griggsby was a false alarm and Lacey was a weak sister.
You grabbed the big difficulties by the scruff of the neck and chucked ’em into the discard.
Knew you would.”
This, in few words, was estimate of the man who had died trying to serve him, and of the other who had gone down to physical wreck in his employ.
You donot know what Griggsby would have done if your enemies hadnot picked him off,” said Bremerton sharply; and Lacey is a whole man; seen him and I know.”
Oh, well, yes, if you want it that way,” returned Deane impatiently.
Success, though, is the only thing that counts.
You pulled the old workings through to gloty, and there wasnot much fuss about it, either.
Reel that off to me.”
Bremerton proceeded to reel it off.”
He took a good deal of satisfaction in making the case as bad as it was.
Beginning with the assault by the town canal, he followed with the capture of Steve and Chombo, then told of the shot at the fork of the trail, and finished with the fate of Carruthers.
Skilfully he left Mariquita Mallory out of the narrative.
Not once was her name mentioned.
His discovery of the lost lead was dealt with indefinitely—treated as an accident.
For all this he had his reasons.
Mariquita and her father would become prominent enough before he was through with the mining king.
Deane was absorbed in the recital.
The fire went out of his cigar again and again.
He breathed hard in the pinches, and by the town canal and at the fork in the trail his fat hands clenched and he swore under his breath.
But his fat face beamed while Bremerton was describing that footwide vein back of the overhang. take my oath, Lee,” he commented earnestly, when the telling was done, I never thought Carruthers would rough things up like that! become of the law in these parts, anyhow it protect a man in keeping his own?
Never mind that, though.
A miss is as good as a mile, and you skinned the gang!
It makes my blood sing just to hear you palaver about it.'
A month’s running on that bonanza ore and the mine’s as good as sold.
Half a million, by thunder, and it cost me only fifty thousand. business, Bremerton. the way to get rich.”
There were no regrets for that mound over Griggsby in the Phoenix cemetery, and not a word of commiseration for the unlucky Lacey. eye was single to that half million.
It completely filled his perspective.
Bremerton knew that if he 5had fallen at the fork of the trail his money-grubbing friend would have experienced few twinges and few regrets.
The roar of flood waters in Arapahoe Canon was almost silenced.
Deane had strangled his finer sentiments with a rope of gold.
The Deane that was and the Deane who now sat at side in the buckboard were two different men.
This realization did much to reconcile Bremerton to the course he had mapped out for himself.
In the interests of right and justice he could deal with this swaggering, purse-proud trickster as he could not have dealt his old, loyal prospector-friend.
Deane offered Bremerton a cigar.
Bremerton declined, and filled and lighted his pipe.
For some time they traveled in silence.
Finally Deane aroused to observe: I consider, Bremerton, that another month of you at the mine will be enough. getting out for fifteen hundred less than I calculated on.
Eh?”
The superintendent’s eyes narrowed. that? he asked.
Deane repeated his words.
Bremerton had heard them plainly enough the first time, but he wanted them repeated.
You mean,” said he, that I was hired for six months for three thpusand dollars, and that, inasmuch as I have made good in half the time, I am only entitled to half pay.
Is that it?
Something like that,” replied Deane, giving a canny glance out of the tails of his eyes.
Are you going to split the tenthousand-dollar bonus in two as well?/’ asked Bremerton dryly.
Well, what do you think?
I donot know, Deane.
I shall have to give it a little reflection.”
Of course I intend to do the right thing,” burst out the other in a flurry of virtuous determination. not be small with a friend, and you can gamble a blue stack on that.
Think it over, old pard. leave it to you.
Whatever you say is right goes with Deane.”
Here was the final straw.
For risking his life, for robbing the Mallorys, for making the mine worth half a million, Deane could haggle with his old friend over the paltry sum that was to be paid!
Yes, certainly, Bremerton would think it over!
A flurry of excitement passed through the camp with the arrival of Deane.
Every worker wanted a look at the big boss.”
He was discussed frankly by a few.
These maintained that he won his games by jumping men over the business checker-board, sacrificing ruthlessly in his dash for the king-row.
They said that his employees were catspaws for pulling his golden chestnuts out of the fire; that he had not the nerve for executing his own schemes; that he bought men in open, market and played them selfishly and unscrupulously for his own lawless gain.
Talk of this kind, however, left no sentiment of disgust or disapproval in its train. success and his wealth dazzled the eyes and confused the understanding.
The mining king was a rugged and prominent figure all up and down the Pacific slope, and men shut their eyes to his past and gave him a hand for what he was.
O’Hara took no part in the buzzing gossip in the mill.
He listened passively while Giles and the engineer shouted confidences to each other about the mine-owner.
The Irishman had tact as well as the courage of his convictions.
In the late afternoon Deane and Bremerton visited the blind gully and searched out a place where the visitor could be lowered with least danger and physical effort to himself.
Then they went to the overhang and examined the bonanza lead.
Deane was astounded, overjoyed.
He talked of running up the price on the syndicate, and of profiting more largely by his superintendent’s work.
His greed outran his delight, and his stuffy voice jingled with prospective dollars.
He swaggered up and down the tunnel.
He bragged about what he had and what he was going to have, the things he had done and the things he would do; and he wound up with: Dam it, Bremerton, I donot know but take the bit in my teeth and insist on giving you every sou of that ten thousand!
They returned to the mine in time for supper, and Deane insisted on sitting at table with the grimy, sweatstained workers.
He tried to be a good fellow, and monopolized the conversation with jokes and witticisms.
The jokes were coarse and the witticisms far-fetched, but they never failed to draw a laugh.
Following supper, and cigars smoked in front of the headquarters adobe, Bremerton made ready to tighten the coil.
As a preliminary step, he invited Deane to step into the office. respect for himself would not allow of association with Deane.
He kept away from the headquarters adobe, but watched it carefully from the shadow of the blink-house.
When the mine-owner and the superintendent retired into the office the Irishman approached the little mudwalled building and took up his position at a point where the mumbling voices reached his ears.
The matter of what Bremerton was about to do worried h’im.
He knew his friend so well that he was expecting drastic measures; and these, he was confident, Deane would fight.
Out of that clash what was to come?
When the voices grew high, when passion pitched them in the high key that meant a narrowing of argument and a resort to force, O’Hara was planning to interfere.
Bremerton might go too far with was conceivable—and the Irishman would step in and call a halt before his friend went to extremes.
While biding his time, with every nerve tense and every faculty alert, O’Hara heard a sound of galloping.
He sprang into the trail and was suddenly confronted by Mariquita Mallory.
Saints defend us! he gasped.
Miss Mallory, you will please forgive me for saying it, but this is no place for you.”
“Where is Mr. Bremerton?” the girl demanded; “where is Deane?
I want to talk with them.
I watched while Deane was taken inter the gully and shown the bonanza lead, and I came here to do what I can to get our rights.
Och, wurra, what a night it is! sighed O’Hara.
“Will you be. listening to me.
Miss Mallory?
It will do you no good to see Deane.
Bremerton has him in the office now, and will fight it out with him!- He has his plans divil knows what they are and if Bremerton canot do anything then nobody can.
Will you please go away? afraid for you here.” not go* away,” she declared. stay on the ground till it’s settled.
Why are .you: here, Air.
O’Hara?
Faith, now, it’s just td be handy in case needed.
A better man than Bremerton never lived, and I canot let him get the worst of anything or—” “You think he’s in danger?” murmured Mariquita quickly; you think he’s risking his life trying to get our rights for us?”
Never not in the- way you mean,” and O’Hara laughed shortly.
Why, Lee could take this fat mining king with one hand and strangle the breath out of him.
Begorry, it’s that, or something like it, that worries me. the worst of the law, do you mind?
You canot kill a human, coyote though he is and no matter what he deserves, without complications with sheriffs and courts and prison walls.
If necessary, here to save Bremerton from that.”
Then stay with you and help you.”
In spite of his protests she stayed, leaving her horse by the corral and then sitting beside O’Hara on the rock-heap where he had posted himself.
They listened silently to the' drone of voices, and once tones rose high and his words came to them distinctly. working for me!
What are the Mallorys to you that you’re so keen for them?” hand clutched ofrm convulsively and a sharp breath fluttered through her lips. stand to his guns, this Bremerton,” whispered O’Hara.
I know him, I tell you.”
Again Deane lifted his angry voice. a d— traitor, that’s what you are!
You was on the rocks and I gave you a chance.
This is what I get for it!
The likes of him to be talking to Bremerton like that! gritted O’Hara. where I begin expecting trouble. say anything, donot do anything; just listen and leave it to me, Miss Mallory.”
So, anxious and apprehensive, they waited and listened.
Meanwhile, in the office matters were approaching a climax.
Deane had followed Bremerton into the office wonderingly.
There was that in face which Deane remembered to have seen there out around San Simone once when they were cornered by Mexicans bent oil taking their burros and camp equipment.
The look and manner of the superintendent puzzled Deane.
Bremerton lighted the lamp and placed it on top of the desk; then he waved Deane to a chair.
Silas,” said Bremerton banteringly, you’re a shrewd one. tell me in Denver how you got hold of the Mariquita Mine.
I asked you if it was a square deal, you remember, and you said it was.”
“Well, wasnot it?”
It was clever,” and a false note of admiration rang in Bremerton’? voice.
You kept Mallory dangling while you put on a side deal with Carruthers.”
Mallory was an old fool,” chuckled Deane, whose ear was too gross to detect the false note.
I let him nibble and then jerked the bait away from him.
But I didnot do that, by thunder, until it was too-late for him to raise the money in other quarters.
Carruthers was harder to manage.
He was as big a fool, though, as Mallory.
He could have extended the time for Mallory, but he was afraid.
I had offered him twenty-five thousand better than Mallory was to give him, and his greed got the better cf his common sense.
Then, after it was all over, Carruthers got sore and began to holler.
A lot of good that did him.”
Bremerton sat quietly and listened and marveled.
This was his old friend who was talking, a man who had shared his blanket and his wavering fortunes for years! something for you to store up for future use, Bremerton,” went on Deane, with the air of one who wished to see another prosper along the lines he had made his own. seen how I pulled this off.
Quit being so blamed conscientious and profit by the lesson.
Get busy on a scheme of your own.
Nothing on earth to hinder you from getting where I am but your fool notions about what’s right and what’s wrong.
Do the other fellow for a spell and donot let him do you.
Sabe?”
Oh, I sabe, all right! answered Bremerton.
Maybe it seems strange to you, Deane; but rather have my fool notions than all your pile of dirty dollars.” that snapped the other. willing enough to take my dirty dollars, by thunder!
Yes, and you helped me here. forget that. really the one who put this scheme across.
That lost lead will do the trick.
Griggsby couldnot find it, and Lacey couldnot find it. ou got onto it, and you were my last bet.” paid me a thousand dollars,” continued the superintendent. the money.
I donot want it.”
He flung the package of bank-notes brought to him by O’Hara on the table in front of Deane.
The latter grew red and apoplectic. this, what’s this?” he muttered choppily. the- money you have paid me.
Now, you canot throw it in my face that profited by your dirty work.
My hands are clean for what’s to come.
I have something also to tell you, Deane.
I want to appeal to your sense of justice—if you have any left in your gold-seared soul.
It was Mariquita Mallory who saved me from Carruthers that morning at the fork of the trail.
My horse was dragging me through the swale.
She stopped the brute..
Yes, and when Carruthers and his gang were shooting at us and driving us from cover to cover, Mariquita Mallory took me into the gully.
“We would have been picked off by the bullets had she not led me under the overhang.
That is how I came to discover the lost vein.
It would never have been found otherwise, and this property would have continued to be nothing more than a poor proposition and dear at the fifty thousand you paid for it had Miss Malory not taken me into that tunnel.”
Deane stared at Bremerton, his little eyes glimmering.
But he had not a word to say.
You see how it is, Deane,” the superintendent continued.
Merely as a matter of right, a simple case of justice, asking you to deed a half interest in the mine to Mariquita Mallory.”
When that had taken length, breadth, and depth in mine he gave vent to a roar of wrath. working for me!
What are the Mallorys to you that you’re so keen for them? not working for you, Silas.
I resign.
Carruthers is out of the running, the bonanza ledge is found, and there is nothing between you and half a million but a little time for putting rich ore through the mill.
I want to say, however, that I am not going to help you rob the Mallorys when all the credit is due the girl.
Get that?”
Deane gave vent to another roar and floundered out of his chair.
He shook a fat fist at his old friend and leaned across the table to shout: a traitor, that’s what you are!
You was on the rocks and I gave you a chance.
That is what I get for it!
A gray eyes gleamed like polished steel.
In just one second he was all energy and flaming resolution.
A bound landed him on his feet, and he threw himself half across the table to look into face.
Yes, a traitor,” he said between his teeth.
The best thing done since I came to the Mariquita Mine is to turn against you.
The Silas Deane of five years ago is dead; you’re not even the shell of him. a knave, a thief, and a liar! you make a move, Deane.
Sit downthere, at my desk!
A move of the right hand and Bremerton was looking over the sights of a revolver. little eyes grew filmy, the purple died from his flabby cheeks and left them a sickly, pasty white.
This mining king had never been a coward.
He knew Bremerton, however.
That voice, that look, meant that Bremerton was no longer Bremerton, but Lee Reckless.
The change from the quiet, selfrestrained man to another whose will %as his only law, and whose hand would stop at nothing, had been consummated in a flash.
Deane slumped heavily against the table.
Slowly he raised a hand.
For sake, Bremerton,” he whispered hoarsely, come out of that! your old partner—remember Arapahoe Canon?
Remember them days when we—” Sit down!
The command was sharp and metallic, like the snapping of a trigger.
Deane wheezed and rolled backward into a chair.
The point of the revolver followed him.
Is this what you got me out here for,” he mumbled to threaten and bullyrag me on my own property I brought you out here, you miserable excuse for the man I used to know, to force you to do one thing—just one thing —that you can look back on without regret when you take the Long Trail.
Do you think my nerve will fail, and that I will hang back?
Say! thick shoulders quivered.
He crouched forward, his elbows on the desk, and spoke weakly over his shoulder: No!
In your present temper you’d do anything.” the right point to start on. get me wrong.
And donot you dare mention Arapahoe Canon!
The words, in your mouth, are an insult to the Silas Deane who was my friend.
You killed him, you bragging, murderous hound!
For that alone you’re not fit to live! crazy,” came gurglingly from Deane. worked for you here; risked my neck for you; and given back the money for which I sold myself.
Before I wash my hands of you, though, there’s one thing more.”
Bremerton groped for the breast of his coat with his left hand.
Not once did he take his gleaming eyes off Deane. a deed to a half-interest in the Mariquita Mine,” Bremerton went on. sign and convey a part of this property to the person who is entitled to all of it Mariquita Mallory.”
He flung the document down on the desk.
This blow at the most vulnerable point brought back his courage—for a moment.
Not if you kill me! he muttered. my property, and you’ll not rob me.
A deed like that wouldnot hold good in law nohow! you sense enough to know that It will hold good—this deed. never dispute it.
If you try that, you’ll know that alive and camped on your trail.
Pick up that pen and sign your name!
Again Deane turned his ghastly face over his shoulder.
The muzzle of a blued barrel was within a yard of him, and back of the barrel was a man primed with a reckless disregard of consequences. hands trembled.
He picked up the paper and bowed close to read it.
It fell from his shaking fingers and dropped to the floor. sign under protest,” said Deane.
Pick it up for me.”
Get it yourself. wise to your tricks.”
Deane bent over, grunting and wheezing.
The chair slipped from under him and he went to his knees.
Then, reaching for the deed with his left hand, he brought his right to the front of the blue flannel shirt.
The thick fingers caught at a hand-grip.
The sharp-eyed Bremerton caught the move, but it was too late to interfere.
The table was between him and Deane.
Oh, you cur! cried Bremerton; you shadow of the man that—” Deane pressed a trigger.
A bullet tore its way through the front of his shirt and ranged upward over his left arm. hands dropped, and he swayed a moment.
Tricky to the last! he gasped.
That gun—under the didnot know—” He fell sprawling backward with a force that made the adobe walls shiver and sent the lamp-flame flaring into the chimney.
A scream came from somewhere.
Deane did not hear it.
Approaching footsteps crunched the gravel.
And Deane did not hear them.
Mechanically he picked up the deed and straightened erect.
Walking around the table, he stood looking down on Bremerton with staring, uncomprehending eyes.
O’Hara sprang furiously into the room out of the night.
One look at the form on the floor and he jumped at Deane.
I thought it was you, not Bremerton he cried. kill you for this!
No,” rasped Deane, lifting his revolver and leveling it. not kill me.
Stand where you are!
The long body doubled forward, the muzzle looking him between the eyes.
He choked, and the fingers of his extended hands closed helplessly into the palms.
Mariquita was in the room, but she seemed lost to what was passing between the two men.
Her concern was all for Bremerton.
Kneeling, she took his head in her arms.
Softly she pushed back the hair from his temples and kissed his brow, his cheek, his lips.
“For me,” she whispered “for me!
Oh, I want you to live so I can repay you for this!
I want you—” She paused, her broken voice trailing off into quiet.
Softly from gripping fingers she removed the revolver.
Look! she said.
There are no loads in it!
O’Hara reached for the weapon, examined it, and, with sneering contempt, exhibited it to Deane.
He was bluffing you,” said he; and, like a friend, like an old partner, you called his bluff.
Oh, if that can get under your skin, think of it now, carry it about in your head for years to come.
But look for Mike O’Hara.
You owe me something for this night's work, Deane, and it’s a debt you’ll pay!
Deane backed away from the harmless revolver as from a rattlesnake.
He was staring at it as he reached the door; and he was still staring as he stepped backward into the night, the folded paper in one hand and the leveled revolver in the other.
Another moment and he was gone.
He passed King in the doorway, and King whirled in a frenzy of consternation and ran off toward the bunk-house.
Deane has killed Bremerton! he shouted.
His voice died out in the sullen hum of the mill.
King, still shouting frenziedly, raced on to the sleeping dayshift with his news.
O’Hara would have gone in pursuit of Deane had not Mariquita stopped him.
It is not Deane but Bremerton who should have our attention now, Mr. O’Hara,” said she.
Help me!
The Irishman was like a man in a dream.
He and the girl, between them, gathered Bremerton up in their arms and carried him to the bed in the other room.
Then an oath burst from O’Hara and he ran out into the night. men were rushing from the bunk-house.
The mill clattered into silence, and Gorman led a wild group over the ore-platform and toward the office.
Who did it shouted Gorman.
Is it true True as gospel,” answered O’Hara.
Deane shot Bremerton down.
Find let him be after getting away. in this camp!
But Deane was not in the camp.
He had taken horse, which was ready at his hand by the corral, and had fled.
All the live-stock was pressed into service for the chase.
O’Hara took one cayuse, and Red Collins another.
Case went bareback on one of his horses, and King took the other.
Dutch team was likewise requisitioned.
The doctor and the sheriff, we need them again,” called O’Hara as he galloped away.
King, that’s your work!
The little cyanid expert, for once in his life, felt equal to anything.
He started on the long ride to town.
For the rest of that night mining and milling were forgotten.
The men clustered in groups around the headquarters adobe, talked while waiting for the searchers to return, and looked through the window at the prostrate, silent form on the bed.
Mariquita was doing what she could.
She was all womanly tenderness, and whenever her hands touched Bremerton it was like a caress.
Giles, the one-eyed, tiptoed into the room.
He carried his hat in his hand. think he’ll live, mum?
“Oh, he will; he must!” the girl answered.
Have you sent for a doctor King went, but it’s a long trip, and it will be sunup afore any one from town gits here.
What can we do, mum I can do everything,” said Mariquita.
“And he’s goin’ to pull through?”
Yes, yes!
Giles tiptoed out again and spread the news.
A faint, husky cheer came from the men.
Bremerton had proved himself a man, and his hold upon the workers had strengthened even beyond his own knowledge.
Slowly the dark hours slipped away, and Mariquita sat by the unconscious Bremerton, clasping his hand and waiting and hoping for the return of consciousness.
One by one the searchers came back.
Deane had eluded them.
O’Hara resolutely took his place at side.
He was somber and grief-stricken for his friend and all consideration and kindliness toward the girl.
Go home, Miss Mallory,” he begged.
’Tis too much for you. like a ghost.” ask me to leave him,” she answered.
I canot.”
O’Hara looked at her closely, and a flash of understanding broke over him.
He smiled softly.
If that’s the way of it,” said he, then sure you must stay.”
They fought hard for hours to bring Bremerton back.
Ragged streamers of dawn floated over the eastern hills before they succeeded.
The first face Bremerton saw was His blank eyes slowly filled with realization.
I did my best for you, novia,” he muttered.
The girl’s eyes burned.
Leaning down, she took one of his hands in both her own and held it to her white cheek.
Novia! she whispered.
Is it true, then?”
He disengaged his hand and groped at the breast of his flannel shirt.
He found there only a bandage.
A troubled look came into his eyes.
From her own bosom the girl took a glove, stained red at the fingers.
Here,” went on Mariquita.
I found Her head went down on the pillow beside his.
Novio mio,” she added in a stifled voice, what matters the mine or anything else, now that we know?
He smiled up into face.
And then the throb of a motor-car awakened echoes in the silent camp.
The car halted in front of the office, and Ransom and Dr. Morton and could scarcely believe his came into the room.
What in the name of—” began the sheriff, then saw Mariquita and bit off his words. been going on here?
Who shot Bremerton?
Deane brought us word, and we hit only the high places coming. back of this black business?”
Deane can tell you! cried O’Hara.
Deane shot Bremerton!
The nerve of him, to come back here like this!
Deane was haggard and about spent.
What he had passed through he alone knew.
“It was an accident,” said Bremerton.
Lee! protested O’Hara.
It was an accident,” insisted Bremerton.
Deane turned away and staggered out into the other room.
The. time came when Michael O’Hara, sitting under the oaks in the canon with his flute, paused in his playing to think of what had been and of what was to be.
The old wanderlust was strong within him, and the beckoning hills would have had him long since but for Bremerton.
He could not vanish before his friend was on his feet and the future way made straight for him.
’Twas coming four weeks now since the accidental shooting.
Deane had gone away immediately, but conscience had spoken to him that night.
Why else had he gone for the sheriff and the doctor and come out with them to the mine?
His heart was sore for his anger and his hastiness.
He wanted to know that his old friend would live.
He wanted to see with his own eyes that he had not opened the gates for a dauntless spirit.
Well, he saw.
Troth, and he heard Bremerton speak and insist on the words that cleared him.
After that he went away and not once had he been heard from.
Another superintendent—from Colorado he was—came in a week.
He had a smooth, boyish face, and his brown eyes turned often to Mariquita, who would not leave side.
But the girl thought only, lived only, for the man under her care; and the brown eyes were disappointed.
It was easy sailing for the new super.
The mill was grinding bonanza rock, and was closed down every other day for a partial clean-up.
Men with guns stood guard by the plates, and people from Phoenix came to see that new wonder in the Phoenix Mountains —a mine whose performance outran expectations.
It was no place for a sick man, what with the stream of visitors and the excitement.
So in a week Bremerton was moved to Oak Flat in the canon.
Mariquita would have it that way, and it was admitted that no one had a better right to dictate.
Red Collins and Gorman had charge of the transfer, and their aids were Dutch Fred and Chase.
O’Hara stood vigilantly by, and there were certain safeguards insisted on by Mariquita.
A hammock was stretched between two saddle-horses and in it lay Bremerton.
Without a jar he was carried over the trail and to the house among the oaks.
The girl made it plain to O’Hara that he was to stay with his friend, and together they had been there nearly three weeks.
Red Collins or Gorman or Gilesonce it was over from the valley at frequent intervals to inquire about Bremerton and to leave news about the mine.
The remarkable showing which the property was making brought Deane many offers.
They eclipsed the half-million mark toward which they had striven at the first.
There was no telling now what some one might pay for the Mariquita.
A fortune might have been yours, querida,” said Bremerton to the girl ©nee when he was beginning to sit up.
She leaned over the back of his chair, her soft arms encircling his neck and her happy eyes looking down into his face.
What is money, Lee,” she asked, to the other prize I have found?
No one could buy it with all the gold in all the hills of this world! not your prize,” he doggedly averred; but mine.”
Out under the oaks, with his flute on his knees, O’Hara was wondering what Bremerton was to do.
New responsibilities were coming to him, and how were they to be shouldered?
Then, along the canon trail, came horses and a buckboard with two men riding.
The men turned in at the flat, and the rig halted near O’Hara.
The Irishman got up with his faded, crooked eyes agleam.
One man had descended from the buckboard and was coming toward him.
It was Silas Deane. draw, O’Hara,” said Deane.
Faith,” said the other, not heeled.
If I had something to draw—” You have something,” and little eye twinkled.
Draw on your imagination.
What am I here for?
Divil a bit,” said O’Hara, scowling.
Who can do any guessing about you From the open door of the house at that moment came Bremerton.
Mariquita walked beside him, and his arm was over her strong young shoulders.
They came toward O’Hara and Deane, and the mine owner watched Bremerton closely.
An easy chair in the shade had been arranged, and Mariquita made Bremerton comfortable in it and then turned with hostile eyes to the visitor.
Bremerton had looked at Deane without speaking.
To what, Mr. Deane,” inquired the girl, do we owe this call I have a good bid for the mine, and I think we had better sell.”
What have I to do with that?
As much as I have.
For nearly a month you have owned a half interest in the Mariquita Mine.
The deed was recorded the day following the—the accident.’
O’Hara was like a man in a daze.
Mariquita was breathing quickly and her trembling hands sought the back of chair.
Bremerton merely studied face.
Bremerton made me see a light,” explained Deane.
He showed me how to be square.
I want his goodwill, Miss Mallory, and I want yours and your father’s.
I reckon I acted like a coyote.
I have enough and to spare, and neither chick nor child to leave it to.
The man in the buckboard is a notary.
If you are ready to sign this deed brought along, tomorrow you and your father wijl have enough in bank to make the rest of your lives easy.”
Bremerton struggled to his feet and put out his hand.
His face was glowing with happiness.
Silas, my old partner! he exclaimed.
“You have come back!
I can hear the flood waters in Arapahoe Canon!
This time, though, you have saved more than my life.” that?” queried Deane, gripping the hand.
Bremerton turned to take Mariquita in his arms.
Whisht! murmured O’Hara, taking Deane by the sleeve and drawing him away. you see how it is I knew it from the start. shake with, you, too, Silas Deane.
Neither you nor I can be best friend any more.
The girl, God bless her, is nearest his heart. made their future safe and you ought to be happy.”
O’Hara wiped his eyes. that divilish flute?” he asked, looking around blindly.
