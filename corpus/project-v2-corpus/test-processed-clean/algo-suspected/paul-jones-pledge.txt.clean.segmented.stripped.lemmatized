dale first luff of jone vessel 
right off the starboard be the response from the maintop 
right off the port bow be echo from the forecastle 
at the first cry jone have issue from -PRON- cabin beneath the poop deck -PRON- have be up all the previous night for the vengeance and the squadron act as -PRON- consort have run into a stiff blow and -PRON- have need all the seamanship of jone and -PRON- mate to bring -PRON- through all taut 
the commander of the vengeance run forward button -PRON- wellworn uniform coat as -PRON- go and telescope in hand take up -PRON- position on the forecastle head 
-PRON- be follow by -PRON- first lieutenant and the young fellow to whom the reader have be previously introduce as jimmy blake the powder monkey but whose rank be raise by special act of congress and who be now know as ensign jame blake

what do -PRON- make of -PRON- sir the question come from jimmy whose face be flush with eagerness at the thought that here at last be the vanguard of the british fleet that jone have pledge -PRON- word to congress to keep from a swoop on the shore of america 
the lad heart beat high at the feeling that at last -PRON- be to have a chance to go into action and prove to the nation that -PRON- be a not unworthy son of the first american navy 
jonqp lay aside the telescope and then turn to the lad with a kindly look in -PRON- keen gray eye 
-PRON- be ship of war -PRON- reply that much be certain but of what nation i have no means of ascertaining till -PRON- be near enough tomake -PRON- show -PRON- color 
but -PRON- can be none other than the vanguard of the british fleet let -PRON- hope so for i do not want the britisher to slip past -PRON- in the night or otherwise evade -PRON- 
the vengeance be tear through the water at a rate that give -PRON- two consort the palla and the hrig concord all -PRON- could do to keepwithin sight of -PRON- 
the stiff breeze that be blow have lay -PRON- over till -PRON- channel be awash 
dale cast an anxious glance aloft at the straining top hamper of the flagship 
-PRON- great sail be belly out rill -PRON- seem as if -PRON- must carry away and the taut rig whistle like piano wire 
have i not well order down the main topgallant -PRON- ask look at jone whose gaze be bent intenth ahead at the two ship that be as yet only dim purple shadow on the horizon

i mean to get up with yon craft before nightfall if -PRON- fetch -PRON- stick out 
dale nod but order new tackle bend onto the weather rig and the sheet flatten a little so as to take the strain from the bending spar 
the excitement be intense 
not a man on board the ship but be eager for a brush with the british vessel if indeed -PRON- be british 
-PRON- will teach the beggar a lesson quoth old bill cuff the boatswain to a group of -PRON- mate who have gather about -PRON- to glean from -PRON- fig the veteran opinion of the chance there be of a scrimmage when -PRON- overhaul the two big vessel ahead 
the latter seem to be under no particular apprehension though -PRON- must have long since sight the little yankee squadron 
as jone have say -PRON- be two of the leviathan threedecker of the english navy 
as -PRON- stand about in the bright sunlight the flash atlantic wave heel -PRON- over till -PRON- show -PRON- copper 
both of -PRON- sport three row of port a side 
-PRON- seem madness on the part of the young american commander to pit -PRON- tiny fleet against two such formidable fighting machine but as the british have learn to -PRON- cost -PRON- take more than heavy odd against -PRON- to deter the young sea eagle as people have already begin to call -PRON- from face -PRON- country foe 
hurrah exclaim the young ensign -PRON- be in for a fight sure 
do -PRON- hear that mate cry old bill cuff as -PRON- hear the word of -PRON- young commander -PRON- be in for a fight 
away -PRON- starboard battery man and get -PRON- barker ready to give johnny bull a warm reception 
at this juncture a strange interruption occur in the shape of an exceedingly fat and exceedingly black negro who be project from the door of the galley with a force that suggest that -PRON- movement be not entirely voluntary 
the ship be heel over to the ever stiffening breeze till -PRON- lee scupper be all awash 
the unfortunate cook for such be the office of thedarky who have just emerge from the little galley hold in -PRON- hand a large kid of steam pea soup which be destine for the men dinner 
-PRON- have intend to carry -PRON- forward but as -PRON- cross the threshold of -PRON- domain the ship give a lurch and the negro give a yell as -PRON- feel -PRON- and -PRON- savory burden be gradually impel toward the boiling puddle of the scupper 
scipio seem to be in trouble say dale as -PRON- eye light on the struggle darky 
the word have hardly leave -PRON- lip before a second chocolatecolore face be poke out of the galley door and a second portly senegambian go staggering to the aid of -PRON- unfortunate fellow cook 
old bill cuff see -PRON- predicament 
sink -PRON- if -PRON- feller ainot go to let the crew dinner go to feed the fish -PRON- angrily exclaim as the two darkie wildly gesticulate be force nearer and ever nearer to the seething scupper 
the old bosun be a man of action and -PRON- do not waste any time on mere word but plunge gallantly to the rescue of the two struggle cook

unfortunately for -PRON- dignified demeanor however the ship at the same moment give an unusually violent lurch and the old boatswain be send spin straight against the man to whom -PRON- have be hand out -PRON- admonition 
the two holder of the soup kid give vent to a howl of dismay as -PRON- see the burly form of the old sailor hurtle toward -PRON- with the speed and force of a projectile 
cuff -PRON- see long before -PRON- actually happen that a collision be inevitable unless one or the other of the negro sheer off 
hard over ye lubber -PRON- yell with -PRON- storm voice as -PRON- be pleased to call the stentorian tone with which -PRON- wasin the habit of call the watch on a rough night 
the wretched negro obey -PRON- instruction literally 
-PRON- obedience however be involuntary for the massive body of the old man reel with all the force that a fresh lurch of the plunging ship impart to -PRON- full against -PRON- 
man and soup go slide into the boiling mass of water in the lee scupper 
cuff be on -PRON- foot in a moment and stand painstakingly wipe the soup out of -PRON- grizzle whisker with one hand while -PRON- wrathfully shake the other at the two halfdrowned darkie 
bad luck to -PRON- -PRON- leatherskinne son of ham -PRON- roar

jone and -PRON- young officer be watch the scene from the forecastle head and the young commander when -PRON- have recover from -PRON- first amusement take pity on the misfortune of the two negro who have be take to sea by -PRON- from the plantaion -PRON- own in virginia in order to satisfy the craving -PRON- have express to see de mighty oshun 
many a time since tjie vengeance and -PRON- two consort have sail -PRON- have regret -PRON- rash step and now be look forward in terror to the day when -PRON- would smell powder for the first time 
as -PRON- hasten back to the galley to carry out the furious order jone hail the boatswain 
-PRON- be punish enough mr cuff -PRON- say as seriously as -PRON- could 
besides i have work on hand for -PRON- elsewhere than in the galley 
the vengeance be by this time separate from the two britistuwar vessel by a little over half a mile 
this space -PRON- be rapidly cover 
half an hour more would lay -PRON- alongside the two great craft 
jone face be light up with the eager look peculiar to -PRON- when the young commander be about to go into action 
with flash eye -PRON- feel the hilt of the magnificent sword present to -PRON- by loui of france mean to attack -PRON- ask dale or shall -PRON- try and show -PRON- a clean pair of heel jone turn on -PRON- almost angrily

but -PRON- be undoubtedly not alone the rest of the fleet be somewhere about and -PRON- would be madness to engage the entire force of the british 
-PRON- duty lie plainly before -PRON- 
dale 
will -PRON- order the signal man to inform the palla and the concord that -PRON- will engage the enemy and -PRON- blake lie aft and have the port battery clear for action 
the two officer hasten to obey 
-PRON- be none too soon to put the ship in fight trim for the next moment a puff of smoke from the side of the hindmost of the english ship and the scream of the ball as -PRON- pass over -PRON- head warn -PRON- of the hostile nature of the two stranger even if -PRON- have not be inform of -PRON- nationality by the display of the british naval flag 
shall -PRON- give -PRON- to -PRON- back si ask jimmy who have get -PRON- battery in fight shape and be eager for a chance to show what -PRON- carefully train gunner could do 
not yet reply jone -PRON- would simply be waste powder and shot and -PRON- can not afford to do that 
-PRON- intend to reserve -PRON- fire then ask dale present yes 
-PRON- will wear round tothe windward of -PRON- and then show -PRON- tooth that will give -PRON- a distinct advantage 
the other nod and seem about to say something but -PRON- be interrupt by a wail of anguish from the two negro 
massa jone cry scipio be -PRON- a fac sah dat -PRON- intend to fight with -PRON- two big ship jone nod 
then fo de sake massa i have ter giv -PRON- notice an mus respectfully request tq be put on dry lan once more be afraid that be impossible scipio

as far as be possible out of sight yes sah massa jone dat be a solid fac 
then down with -PRON- into the forecastle 
this ship be no place for two such coward as -PRON- be 
dat may be true sah but i be teach by -PRON- ole mammy in good ole virginia dat -PRON- be a great deal better fo folk to say dar -PRON- go dan dar -PRON- lay 
despite -PRON- disgust jone could not refrain from laugh as the two woollyheade coward disappear down the forecastle hatch 
there be no time however to exchange word on any other topic than the business in hand 
the vengeance be now close enough to the rear frigate to read -PRON- name benbozv which be display in gorgeous scrollwork on -PRON- rounded stern 
this be the vessel command by capt hawksdale who have swear to rid the sea of jone or sink -PRON- own vessel in the attempt 
jone be well aware of thisboast for during -PRON- visit in france -PRON- have be inform of the bitter enmity the british captain cherish toward -PRON- 
as -PRON- recognize -PRON- enemys vessel the battle light come into -PRON- face 
the line about -PRON- mouth set and harden and a steely glint come into -PRON- eye 
-PRON- be the face of a fighting man 
show -PRON- the rattlesnake -PRON- order curtly and a moment later the famous standard of the coiled rattlesnake be float from the peak of the gallant yankee vessel 
the palla and -PRON- companion follow suit and a fullthroate american cheer be bear over the wave as the emblem of liberty be display 
the british vessel reply with a volley of musket ball that do no more harm than to plow up the deck 
-PRON- have the effect however of arouse the american crew to a state of fury 
the scoundrel roar old bill cuff squint along the polished barrel of the wickedlooke bow chaser 
the old man be an expert gunner and jone have intrust to -PRON- the task of wing the great threedecke frigate so that -PRON- would be at the mere of the broadside 
at last jone give the longexpecte signal 
let -PRON- have -PRON- -PRON- say to the boatswain 
cuff step back a foot or two and wait lanyard in hand till the vengeance come up on an even keel cut -PRON- maintop in half if -PRON- can cuff cried jone eagerly 
every eye on board jone vessel be on the old man as -PRON- jerk the lanyard 
the gun speak and the deadly missile screech through the air 
the ball speed through the rigging of the britisher and part some of -PRON- maintop hamper but the spar -PRON- be untouched 
miss by thunder exclaimed bill wipe the smoke from -PRON- eye with the back of -PRON- hand 
at the same moment the britisher wear round an evo lution in which -PRON- be follow by -PRON- sister ship 
signal the other that -PRON- will tackle the benbow ex claim jone turn to the signal master -PRON- must hold the attention of the other threedecker while -PRON- engage 
the signal man break out the bunting and the brig and the little put -PRON- helm up and head for the consort 
jone -PRON- take the wheel of the vengeance and jam -PRON- up into the wind till -PRON- have the britisher on -PRON- weather quarter 
fortunately the vengeance be what be know to sail or as a weatherly craft and -PRON- could hug the breeze a good two point further up than the big threedecker which as be the way of -PRON- type show a wake almost as broad as a county 
the sailing quality of jone ship bring -PRON- up where -PRON- could rake -PRON- foe with deadly effect 
the young commander stand on -PRON- quarterdeck in -PRON- battlestained uniform and watch the movement of the threedecker intently through the telescope 
when the foresail of the vengeance begin to shiver as -PRON- take the wind over -PRON- bow -PRON- order -PRON- to bear down on the huge foe that be now flounder about like some agitated leviathan 
the reason of -PRON- dilemma be that -PRON- captain have attempt to follow jone evolution and have only sue ceede in get -PRON- ship into iron 
that be that -PRON- be jam up into the wind till -PRON- point right at the blow 
this have the effect of set -PRON- all aback and -PRON- lie helpless for a moment till -PRON- people could swing -PRON- great main topsail about 
jone be quick to see -PRON- advantage and act on -PRON- 
fire 
the command be pass from the poop deck to the region below where in the light of the battle lantern the crew strip to the waist and barefoote be ram home the deadly content of the starboard broadside 
a sheet of flame and smoke belch from the side and -PRON- tremble from stern to stempost as the gun discharge -PRON- deadly hail 
jone spring into the lee rig as the smoke blow out over the sea and eagerly observe the effect of -PRON- assault 
the telescope show -PRON- that -PRON- broadside have severely cripple the britisher but owe to the great height of -PRON- side the shot have for the most part strike -PRON- too low to inflict as much damage as would have be the case have -PRON- be rake along the deck 
-PRON- be at this moment that the accident dale have dread take place 
as the yankee ship after pour in the broadside be put before the wflnd the main topmast backstay part with the report of a cannon 
instantly the sail tear the spar of the main topmast clean out of -PRON- stepping and in a moment everything aloft be in a terrible muddle 
the man at the helm let -PRON- pay off in order to save the foremast for have that spar part -PRON- would have be at the mercy of -PRON- foe as much as if -PRON- be aboard a helpless wreck 
the moment be the opportunity for which the benboiv have be wait 
at the same time as jone ship have meet with -PRON- disaster the british ship have be ease and -PRON- prune broadside now threaten the brave little vengeance 
a perfect volcano break from -PRON- three gun tier and the deck of the yankee ship be sweep as though by a tornado under the storm of shell and grapeshot that hurtle about -PRON- 
the little craft be riddle from stem to stern and -PRON- rig cut to shred by the chain shoot with which some of the british gun have be load 
the already strain mast snap like wooden knit6 te needle as the stay part and the fall timber and block convert the deck already strew with the dead and die into a veritable shamble 
amid the confusion jone and dale with jimmy and old bill cuff alone remain calm 
the scene be enough to try the nerve of the brave 
everywhere man be die or dead 
the vessel which but a moment before have be as stanch a craft as sail the sea be convert into a mere dismantle hull at the mercy of the britisher to do as -PRON- will with 
get together all the man -PRON- can be jone first order and cut away all this hamper 
-PRON- ainot much good muttered old bill cuff as -PRON- sound -PRON- boatswain pipe to which however not more than a dozen man answer -PRON- be as good as dead already 
after the mass of rig and spar that have float alongside have be cut away by the crew axe the vessel be find to be fast sinking 
at the same moment jimmy utter a cry and point to the threedecker 
-PRON- have go about after -PRON- deadly broadside and be now bear directly down on the dismantle hull 
what can -PRON- intend to do ask dale 
if -PRON- keep on -PRON- present course that question be easily answer be jone reply 
what do that mean 
that -PRON- be go to ram -PRON- and send -PRON- to the bottom never -PRON- could not be so inhuman 
why not 
this be war and -PRON- be deal with a foe -PRON- be determined to crush out at all hazard 
-PRON- will stop at nothing to accomplish -PRON- purpose 
this be fiendish exclaimed jimmy 
be there no way -PRON- can save -PRON- if -PRON- carry out the plan -PRON- think -PRON- have 
dale ask the question 
-PRON- be a brave man as brave as could be find on the high sea but there be something terrible to -PRON- in the thought of be send to the bottom without have a chance to strike a blow in -PRON- own defense 
if -PRON- could have die fight -PRON- would have meet -PRON- death as would -PRON- two companion without a tremor 
jone think jtfor a moment -PRON- eye fix on the fast advance threedecker as -PRON- ponder 
there be a way -PRON- say at length but -PRON- be such a desperate resort that i be afraid -PRON- will not care to adopt -PRON- 
what be -PRON- 
why when the crash come -PRON- must spring into -PRON- main chain and swarm onto -PRON- deck 
-PRON- be only change -PRON- mode of death 
possibly but while there be life there be hope and i mean to make the attempt 
paul jone -PRON- be a brave man 
to avoid death 
i donot think so that be an instinct even with animal 
-PRON- must take care to keep -PRON- pistol dry for -PRON- shall have plenty of work for both -PRON- and -PRON- cutlass when -PRON- get on the british deck 
the man who remain of the crew be call aft and the plan explain to -PRON- 
-PRON- all agree to stand by -PRON- officer and fight to the death rather than be send to davy 
jone in -PRON- riddled hulk 
there be no doubt now of the plan 
straight down on the doomed yankee bear the leviathan hull of the threedecker drive at tremendous speed by -PRON- great spread of canvas 
-PRON- be draw so near by now that the man on the batter vengeance could almost hear the swish of -PRON- forefoot as -PRON- cut through the sea 
a shudder pass through more than one of the man on the bloody deck as -PRON- think that ere long the keen stem would have cut the hulk -PRON- float on sheer in half 
-PRON- be at this moment that paul jone leave the deck and disappear down the after companion 
-PRON- be not miss for several moment in the general confusion that reign at the time 
the young commander swing -PRON- easily down the companion stairway till -PRON- reach the alleyway lead to the powder magazine 
-PRON- wrench one of the smoking battle lantern from the wall and tear off a strip of -PRON- shirt wet -PRON- in a pail of water which stand near the magazine door and then spread powder on the dampen linen 
then -PRON- listen intently 
above the groan of the dying that make the ship hideous lie hear a warning cry from the deck 
the moment have come 
quickly -PRON- thrust the strip of linen which be to serve as a fuse into the flame of the lantern 
-PRON- make a capital fuse and -PRON- trust -PRON- sputter and glow into the magazine 
then -PRON- turn and run quickly to the deck 
-PRON- be not a moment too soon 
right above the smoking batter hull of the little vengeance tower the huge black shape of the threedecker 
from the low elevation of the little craft the britisher seem to tower like a mountain 
stand by cried jone as the huge sheer bow be right upon -PRON- 
stand by be echo among the devoted little yankee band 
the next moment there be a rend crash as the bowsprit of the britisher tear -PRON- way through what be leftof the top hamper 
as the bobstay of the leviathan sweep over dieir head the man on the deck of the vengeance reach up and seize -PRON- 
several of -PRON- catch the stay and hang for a moment suspend over the rend timber of the ship that have bear -PRON- so long and so faithfully ere -PRON- swarm into the main chain 
tone -PRON- make a spring for the port channel and soon join -PRON- follower in -PRON- effort to reach the deck of the big threedecker 
before the british crew which be mass on the bow of the war ship to witness the destruction of the audacious yankee be aware of what have happen jone and -PRON- man stand or -PRON- forecastle and with draw sword and pistol drive furiously at the johnny bull 
the rather stolid crew of the britisher be so completely take off -PRON- guard that -PRON- be some moment before -PRON- collect -PRON- wit sufficiently to rally and make some resistance to the bold yankee 
by this time the rest of the britisher that be to say the few that have be leave on the poop when the britisher make -PRON- swoop on the poor vengeance have rush to the aid of -PRON- comrade 
-PRON- be too late though to stop the furious swoop of the american who with paul jone wave -PRON- sword high above -PRON- head in the lead have dash right through the group on the forecastle and be now well amidship 
-PRON- cost hard fighting to gain this position and -PRON- number be sensibly decrease in the desperate sortie 
-PRON- can not hold out if -PRON- rally and attack -PRON- in a body dale be say when -PRON- word be cut short by a roar that seem to rend the very sky 
at the same moment there be a blind flash of light as if a thunderbolt have be launch in -PRON- midst and -PRON- be throw flat on -PRON- face by some superlative force 
at the same time the entire forward part of the british war ship be hoist skyward and the air be dark with the rain of shatter timber and dismember human body 
as soon as -PRON- be able after the shock the american struggle to -PRON- foot and gaze about -PRON- daze for a moment at the suddenness of the whole affair 
dale be the first to guess what have happen 
-PRON- fire the magazine of the vengeance -PRON- say to jone 
the young commodore nod 
there be a look of triumph on -PRON- face as -PRON- do so 
-PRON- plan bad succeed beyond -PRON- wildest expectation 
of -PRON- late enemy not more than half a dozen remain and these be huddle forward in a frightened group eye the yankee as if -PRON- be some sort of supernatural being 
-PRON- offer no resistance to jone when -PRON- order -PRON- to be imprison in the forward deckhouse but huddle into -PRON- prison like a herd of frightened sheep 
the smoke hang so heavily over the scene that jone be unable despite -PRON- anxiety to see how the palla and -PRON- consort be fare 
suddenly through the dense fog of powder fume a voice sound 
vast -PRON- british lubber -PRON- hail 
by heaven -PRON- have tackle a genuine yankee sailor this trip and if -PRON- come one step nearer blow some of -PRON- to kingdom come 
the voice have a familiar ring 
-PRON- be that of old bill cuff 
in the excitement of the moment no one have miss -PRON- and -PRON- fill -PRON- heart with joy to think that -PRON- old shipmate be safe and sound 
-PRON- hail -PRON- back and in another moment -PRON- be all shake hand on the battlescarred deck of the britisher 
a puff of wind send the smoke which have hang over -PRON- till now like a pall stream out to leeward 
at what be reveal when -PRON- full vision be restore to -PRON- every man on that deck give a cry 
the sea be within a few foot of the vessel main deck 
-PRON- be evident that the ship be take on water fast and have only a short time to live 
-PRON- be in the most desperate situation that can confront a mariner 
paul jone and -PRON- man be alone on the shatter deck of a sink ship 
anxiously -PRON- cast -PRON- gaze about the ship 
-PRON- vigilance be barren of result however for -PRON- boat hang shatter in the davit 
jone cast a sweeping glance about -PRON- 
down to windward hang a heavy cloud of smoke 
in the midst of -PRON- -PRON- could not doubt be the two remain ship of -PRON- squadron 
what -PRON- fate be the cloud of battle do not enable -PRON- to ascertain but -PRON- have every confidence in commander crawford and biddle and know that -PRON- be give a good account of -PRON- 
although the situation do indeed seem hopeless jone be not the man to let the grass grow under -PRON- foot 
at any time and particularly in moment that would have seem to other man -PRON- last -PRON- bold spirit rise to the emergency and have many time turn defeat into victory 
there be no boat as -PRON- see -PRON- say turn to dale 
no be the reply -PRON- seem -PRON- doom be seal 
not at all 
there be still a chance chance 
yes though -PRON- have no boat -PRON- can build a raft stout enough to hold -PRON- till either the palla or the concord see -PRON- and pick -PRON- up 
this put new hope into the little party and -PRON- set to work to collect a number of plank that seem suitable for -PRON- purpose 
these be lash as securely as -PRON- time limit would allow to a number of empty barrel which would give the raft buoyancy in the water 
-PRON- preparation complete jone throw in a keg of water and a bag of hard sea biscuit 
-PRON- would have stock -PRON- frail craft with more water for -PRON- do not know how long -PRON- may be before -PRON- be pick up but time press 
the last preparation be barely complete when the ship give a sicken lurch 
for a brief second those on board think that -PRON- last moment have come but with a brave effort the die ship right -PRON- 
-PRON- be now so deep in the water that to launch the raft over the side be an easy matter 
a faint cheer rang out from the yankee as the wretched contrivance slip into the water -PRON- be very faint though for not a man who step aboard -PRON- but realize that -PRON- may be go to -PRON- death 
as -PRON- shove off from the side of the sink ship dale cast a swift glance round the horizon 
far to windward there be a faint outline of purple mist lie like a veil over the blue water 
the first luff gaze at this for some moment with a troubled expression on -PRON- face 
-PRON- seem that -PRON- scent trouble in the dim filmy mass 
if -PRON- do however -PRON- say nothing to -PRON- companion none of whom seem to have notice the appearance that have cause a shadow to rest on -PRON- brow 
at this moment -PRON- reflection be cut short by a wild cry from the deckhouse of the sink ship 
-PRON- have forget the imprison british sailor 
-PRON- plea to be take off be pitiful 
without a moment hesitation jone who have the key of the place plunge into the sea 
with swift strong stroke -PRON- have reach the side of the sinking britisher almost before -PRON- companion have have time to guess what -PRON- be about to attempt 
seize a dangle piece of rope -PRON- swing -PRON- easily to the deserted deck and race for the deckhouse 
the cry of the poor creature within be pitiful 
shoot -PRON- if -PRON- will -PRON- cry but for pitys sake do not leave -PRON- to drown like rat in a trap come to save -PRON- cry joneg as -PRON- turn the key and fling the door back 
the deck be tremble with the vessel last throe as the man rush out 
swim for -PRON- life for the raft shout jone -PRON- be go down 
-PRON- all plunge into the water and make for the raft 
all that be but some half dozen who be unable to swim 
one of these a fairhaire young fellow of slender build jone help to the raft 
this man be the only one -PRON- be able to save 
the other sink like lead after a few struggle 
pull for all -PRON- be worth or -PRON- shall be catch in the undertow cry dale as soon as -PRON- leader and the rescue man be safe on board a sink ship create a whirlpool into which everything afloat in -PRON- immediate neighborhood be draw admonition be timely 
as -PRON- speak the stern of the threedecker raise high in the air and then with a noise like the rend apart of huge timber -PRON- sink forever 
those on the raft have little time to watch the spectacle for -PRON- be keep busy scull -PRON- out of the undertow 
the man whom jone have rescue gaze at the sinking derelict with horrified eye 
but for -PRON- -PRON- say to jone should be go to -PRON- grave with the other poor fellow 
who be i to thank for -PRON- rescue -PRON- name be paul jone be the quiet reply 
the fellow start back as if strike by lightning 
paul jone -PRON- exclaim 
why -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- kill every englishman and give no quarter to -PRON- foe 
-PRON- give quarter but -PRON- never ask -PRON- be the curt reply 
speak like the brave man i now believe -PRON- be 
i be the second lieutenant of yon illfated craft -PRON- name be charle harkness at -PRON- service capt jone and can i ever reciprocate -PRON- noble act i will do so 
thank -PRON- say jone be sure that -PRON- will 
-PRON- be interrupt by a cry from dale who for some time past have not remove -PRON- eye from the filmy cloud that have first attract -PRON- attention when -PRON- be put off from the ship 
the fog -PRON- cry 
unless -PRON- can make the palla or the concord before -PRON- be on -PRON- -PRON- be lose 
there be a note in -PRON- tone that give no doubt of the seriousness of -PRON- position 
the man pull with all -PRON- strength for the two vessel which be still fight the other britisher 
the raft be a clumsy contrivance however and despite -PRON- effort the fog curtain roll over the darken sea toward -PRON- till -PRON- be wrap in -PRON- soft impenetrable fold 
a -PRON- be a situation fill with horror 
-PRON- have no compass and even if -PRON- have one -PRON- would have be useless to -PRON- in the surround gloom 
occasionally -PRON- could catch the distant boom of gun which tell -PRON- in a vague way the whereabout of the other two vessel but although -PRON- pull through the dense mist as -PRON- judge in the right direction -PRON- could not seem to get any nearer 
unless the fog lift -PRON- have to face a situation that be unparalleled for sheer hopelessness 
-PRON- raft be ofthe frail and even with the great economy -PRON- slend stock of provision would not last -PRON- more than a day at most 
-PRON- shout with all the strength of -PRON- lung in the effort to attract some attention but no answer come to -PRON- hail 
at length the sound of firing begin to grow fainter and -PRON- be compel to acknowledge although the realization bring with -PRON- a chill that -PRON- be adrift on the unknown with the vessel that may have give -PRON- aid rapidly bear away from -PRON- 
what make -PRON- hard to bear be the thought that assistance have -PRON- be able to signal be so near at hand 
suddenly from out of the fog a voice answer -PRON- hail 
if -PRON- be english for de sake be mussiful an pick up two distressed mariner -PRON- moan 
another voice come from the same direction as the first chime in with -PRON- never do have no use for dat ere paul jone 
-PRON- be genlemen an prisoner till -PRON- be blow up 
now -PRON- dunno if -PRON- be alive or jes color angel 
despite -PRON- terrible situation not a man aboard the raft could forbear smile as -PRON- recognize the voice of scipio and cato have forget -PRON- exclaim jone 
well i be glad -PRON- be safe and sound for have -PRON- be sink in the vengeance i should never have forgive -PRON- 
a rift in the fog reveal to the man the raft two woolly head bob side by side up and down on the swell and hold tight to a float chicken coop 
loud ducking from the interior of the latter show -PRON- to be occupy 
the negro be soon haul on board to the intense disgust of old bill cuff who opine that there wassomethe not just all right about people who could emerge from an explosion like that of the magazine of the vengeance without further hurt than a little singed wool and a bad fright -PRON- drift helplessly about till the fade light tell -PRON- that night be come on 
with the coming of darkness a low moaning wind spring up and the sea begin to roll in a wav that make the wretched collection of plank and barrel creak ominously 
what if the raft should part 
dale whisper to jimmy 
-PRON- should have to trust tc luck to get -PRON- out of -PRON- reply jimmy 
there be another peril -PRON- shall have to face even if -PRON- do escape from the raft what be that 
why -PRON- know these water be alive with british vessel and i suspect that the two -PRON- encounter be simply straggler from the main body 
-PRON- position would indeed be serious if -PRON- fall into the hand of the british 
especially if -PRON- find out that -PRON- have sink one of -PRON- fine ship 
see 
-PRON- look as if this measly fog be go to lift at last 
the rise wind have indeed drive away the fog mass in heavy swirl of vapor that stream far out to leeward like strip of veil 
from behind the driving mass a sickly moon shine out and feebly illumine the heaving waste of water 
the man on the raft gaze eagerly about 
toward every point of the compass -PRON- look 
the result be bitter disappointment 
not a trace of a sail be to be see 
as far as the eye could reach the sea be empty save for the frail and hurriedly put together raft that float a mere speck on the desert of water with -PRON- burden of humanity 
jone approach dale old friend -PRON- say -PRON- have need of all -PRON- courage now for this ip something very different from the excite inent of battle 
true -PRON- mean day and perhaps week of impotent suffering 
day perhaps -PRON- forget that -PRON- can not by any possibility survive for more than a week 
trite and even then -PRON- will not dwell on -PRON- but hope for the good 
now some have well lie down and try to sleep 
the man on the raft lie down on -PRON- frail support of plank and close -PRON- eye 
not one of -PRON- sleep however 
-PRON- thought be busy with various thing far remove from the waste of deserted water that surround -PRON- 
toward morning slumber mercifully visit some of -PRON- 
when dale awake -PRON- see 
jone stand by a make shift mast -PRON- and old cuff have rig up with the aid of one of the oar 
the young commander be eagerly gaze all about -PRON- 
the eastern horizon be dye a delicate pink with the first heral ding of the come day and under the fresh light of dawn the heave desert of salt water show as desolate as though the keel of man have never plow -PRON- 
-PRON- see nothing sir ask dale 
jone shake -PRON- head 
the moaning of one of the man who have be wound strike on -PRON- ear 
water water -PRON- moan 
jone nod with a significant look at the tiny keg of the precious fluid dale know what -PRON- mean at once 
there be hardly enough water to last -PRON- the day 
jone stoop over the wounded man and let -PRON- drink -PRON- fill 
-PRON- be later in the day that the other arouse -PRON- for -PRON- all feel that -PRON- be well to drowse away the hour till -PRON- should be rescue than to suffer the agony of wake suspense 
toward noon jone make a distribution of biscuit and water 
-PRON- eat and drink with avidity 
-PRON- be hour since any of -PRON- have do either 
as the sun rise higher the glare from the water dazzle -PRON- eye and the heat increase till some of the sailor begin to clamor for more water 
man say jone address -PRON- -PRON- be sll in a terrible position and whether -PRON- shall ever get out of -PRON- i know not 
that be in the hand of providence 
of one thing however i can assure -PRON- the first man catch steal ater will be shoot 
that be all -PRON- say but -PRON- have the effect of calm the man down and -PRON- endure in silence till sunset when a second distribution be make 
jone -PRON- take less than anyone 
the british officer notice this and offer to forego -PRON- own share but jone would not hear of -PRON- 
-PRON- be about midnight when jimmv arise from a trou bleed sleep and gaze about -PRON- make out a form by the water cask ri -PRON- be one of the rescue british sailor and -PRON- be in the act of repay -PRON- savior by filch from -PRON- scanty supply of water 
jimmy be on -PRON- in an instant 
a quick backward wrench of -PRON- hand send the fellow sprawling 
-PRON- be up in a minute though and jimmy catch the gleam of a knife in -PRON- hand as -PRON- come at -PRON- 
there be no time for the young ensign to draw -PRON- weapon 
the only thing to do be to grapple with the man 
as -PRON- close jimmy feel a sharp pain in -PRON- shoulder as though a redhot iron have be plunge into -PRON- 
the britisher have use -PRON- steel to good effect 
but -PRON- have not calculate on the strength of the young american 
with all -PRON- might jimmy grasp the man wrist and bend -PRON- slowly back till -PRON- be on -PRON- knee 
then drop that knife 
the blade ring to the deck 
now look here say jimmy to -PRON- now helpless antagonist will spare -PRON- life this time but if ever -PRON- attempt such a thing again i shall shoot -PRON- like the dog -PRON- be 
the fellow answer not a word but slink over to the side of the raft on which -PRON- companion lie and be soon wrap in apparent slumber 
jimmy examine the spigot of the water keg 
-PRON- turn -PRON- slightly so as to see if the british sailor have tamper with -PRON- 
as -PRON- hand meet the spigot -PRON- hear a loud shout behind -PRON- 
-PRON- be the man -PRON- have just wrest the knife from 
the young ensign be about to order the fellow away when -PRON- shout at the top of -PRON- voice here -PRON- be 
here be the fellow who steal the water while -PRON- be asleep 
in a second everyone on the raft be wide awake and jimmy face a score of accuse eye 
even jone be tempt for a moment to believe in the young ensign guilt but one glance into the lad face and the ring of -PRON- voice as -PRON- exclaim a lie convince jone that -PRON- young ensign be guiltless of the base act of which -PRON- be accuse 
what have -PRON- to say about this -PRON- demand sternly of the english sailor a sinisterlooke fellow the low part of whose face be envelop in a huge red beard 
-PRON- small eye dance with hatred -PRON- point at jimmy as -PRON- reply see -PRON- do -PRON- 
a sensation run through the man on the raft 
if a trusted officer be to be detect in the act of steal some of the precious water in whom could -PRON- place any reliance 
jimmy say jone sorrowfully be afraid -PRON- look pretty black against -PRON- -PRON- boy 
-PRON- know when -PRON- all awake -PRON- be by the keg and be in the act of turn the spigot

even jone be compel to admit that -PRON- do not seem very credible 
-PRON- know the penalty for such an act jimmy say the commander sadly 
capt jone exclaim the young ensign -PRON- be make a horrible mistake 
surely surely -PRON- can not think that i have do this thing 
jimmy boy -PRON- look black against -PRON-

-PRON- could not trust -PRON- to speak 
deep confidence as -PRON- have in the lad -PRON- could not doubt but that torture by the thirst that be begin to torment -PRON- all the expowd monkey have be unable to resist the craving 
jimmy bury -PRON- face in -PRON- hand donot mind the penalty commander -PRON- say bitterly for if -PRON- doubt -PRON- there be not much use in -PRON- living but -PRON- should know that i be not a liar 
jimmy -PRON- would all be too glad to believe -PRON- but what be -PRON- do by that water keg 
that i have tell -PRON- once 
that be all the explanation -PRON- have to offer -PRON- be 
the english sailor break into a brutal laugh 
-PRON- voting life will be snuff out anyhow -PRON- remark to a comrade near -PRON- 
not just yet say a clear ringing voice as lieut 
harkness stride up to jone 
all stare at the english officer sudden interruption 
jone look at -PRON- interrogatively 
-PRON- have evidence point to the guilty party -PRON- ask

who be -PRON- there -PRON- stand the britisher point to the sailor who have accuse jimmy 
why do yen not speak before do not dream that matter be go to turn out so seriously besides be unwilling to see a countryman convict of such a base act but i be force to believe the evidence of -PRON- own eye when i see that man drink e from the spigot of the water butt 
a terrible change have come over the face of the bearded sailor as -PRON- officer have speak 
-PRON- florid feature be overspread with a sickly gray 
jone speak to -PRON- sharply 
come here 
the fellow shuffle over to the young commander 
what have -PRON- to say to this charge a lie 
the tone in which -PRON- say -PRON- be enough to convict the man of falsehood but jone let -PRON- go a little further 
-PRON- mean -PRON- be not at the water keg at all that be what i mean yes do not believe -PRON- 
there be stain of water on the front of -PRON- shirt 
the fellow look down in terror 
yes there -PRON- be beyond a doubt 
several wet stain of the water that have dribble from -PRON- mouth as -PRON- drink and -PRON- make a damn piece of evidence against -PRON- 
jone face grow hard as steel as -PRON- look at the cringing creature before -PRON- 
-PRON- hate a sneak and above a sneak -PRON- abhor a liar 
the man who face -PRON- be both 
-PRON- turn to jimmy 
give -PRON- -PRON- pistol 
jimmy blanched 
the fate -PRON- would not have hesitate to face -PRON- -PRON- could not bear to be instrumental in bring on another 
jone see -PRON- hesitation 
come jimmy -PRON- say -PRON- can not save the man by refuse -PRON- -PRON- weapon 
but -PRON- surely do not mean to shoot -PRON- 
as if -PRON- be a dog 
do -PRON- think of the life that depend on that water when -PRON- try to steal -PRON- jimmy be force to admit the justice of jone argu ment 
without another word -PRON- hand -PRON- the pistol 
jone point -PRON- at the shrink wretch in front of -PRON- 
if youliave anything to say speak now -PRON- say 
the sailor break into a torrent of blasphemy 
jone check -PRON- 
do not revile in -PRON- last moment -PRON- say 
the only answer be another burst of profanity then before jone could put -PRON- on guard the frenzied man leap full at -PRON- and bury -PRON- finger in -PRON- throat 
if i be to die by heaven -PRON- go with -PRON- lie shriek in the tone of a madman 
the fury of -PRON- assault send jone stagger backward toward the edge of the raft 
in another moment -PRON- be both struggle in the water 
there be an old saying that there be no enemy as dan gerous as a desperate coward 
jone struggle with all -PRON- might to free -PRON- but the fellow finger sunk deeper into -PRON- flesh 
-PRON- feel -PRON- sense leave -PRON- as completely exhaust -PRON- make a last effort to wrest -PRON- from the madman grasp 
for the first few second after the two man have go over the side jimmy and the other have stand paralyzed with amazement at the affair 
as the young ensign see the difficulty -PRON- commander be in however -PRON- require only the work of a moment for -PRON- to plunge into the water to the rescue 
-PRON- throw -PRON- arm about the throat of jone assailant as the latter be about to sink for the last time and force -PRON- back 
as -PRON- head be wrench round the fellow release -PRON- death grip on jone throat and turn -PRON- attention to jimmy do for -PRON- anyway -PRON- pup -PRON- hiss as -PRON- strive to grasp the boy windpipe i3 but jimmy be on -PRON- guard 
-PRON- force -PRON- arm under the other chin and together -PRON- sink 
jimmy be too experience a hand in the water not to have take a good lungful of air before -PRON- go under 
the other however have not and when -PRON- once more shoot to the surface jimmy feel the form of the treacherous fellow limp in -PRON- arm 
-PRON- feel -PRON- heart 
-PRON- have stop beat 
the man lip too be blue about the comer 
-PRON- be dead beyond a doubt 
nevertheless the man on the raft work over -PRON- to try and fan some faint spark of vitality to life but at the end of an hour -PRON- see that -PRON- effort be useless 
-PRON- be sundown of -PRON- second day on the raft that -PRON- consign the body to the deep 
shortly after -PRON- take -PRON- last drink from the keg and eat the last biscuit 
if help do not come shortly -PRON- be doom man 
all that night -PRON- sit up on -PRON- frail float platform and some of -PRON- pray that aid would come before death claim -PRON- 
dawn however show -PRON- the same monotonous level of rolling water without a sail to break the loneliness of the heaving waste 
-PRON- speak but little 
man in -PRON- position have little to say for each be busy with -PRON- own thought 
the wounded man groan in -PRON- pain and implore -PRON- to give -PRON- a drop of water to moisten -PRON- parched throat 
-PRON- dare not tell -PRON- that the water be all go but with the strange intuition that come sometimes to the dying -PRON- sit upright and point -PRON- finger at the keg scream -PRON- have drink -PRON- all -PRON- curse thief 
-PRON- mean to leave -PRON- to die without a drop to ease -PRON- last hour 
-PRON- be terrible to hear -PRON- raving as -PRON- call down curse on the head of the man who as -PRON- think have deprive -PRON- of -PRON- share of the precious fluid 
at last lie raise -PRON- up and try to drag -PRON- wounded body to the keg 
the effort be too much for -PRON- and -PRON- fall exhausted halfway 
-PRON- let -PRON- lie there until jone see -PRON- position and tenderly lift -PRON- back onto the pile of canvas that serve -PRON- as a pillow 
toward evening a tiny cloud appear on the horizon 
-PRON- spread with the rapidity of an ink spot on blot paper and soon the whole heaven be overcast with a sooty pall of dark cloud 
the castaway hail this with expression of thankfulness 
-PRON- mean the one thing that may yet save -PRON- livesrain 
presently a few heavy drop fall 
-PRON- turn -PRON- face with -PRON- mouth open eagerly up to the sky that -PRON- may not miss a drop of the bless moisture -PRON- must catch some of this downpour and save -PRON- say tone who realize that -PRON- may still have many day of suffering to face ere a ship or death put an end to -PRON- misery 
the canvas from beneath the wound man head be spread so as to catch as much of the rain as possible 
-PRON- leak like a sieve and when the shower cease only a few minute after -PRON- have begin there be not more than a quart of dirty water to show for -PRON- pain 
one of the sailor step up to jone 
be -PRON- go to serve out that water now sir -PRON- ask respectfully enough yet with a note in -PRON- voice that jone do not like 
-PRON- know well enough that this be to be keep for that poor fellow -PRON- say indicate the die man who have cry so beseechingly for water that day 
what -PRON- donot get none of -PRON- 
not a drop -PRON- man 
the sailor turn without a word and join -PRON- mate 
-PRON- talk together for a while in low tone 
evdn in situation such as that in which the castaway find -PRON- man will form into clique 
this be for various reason on land but among seaman there be the line that be draw between forecastle and quarterdeck that nothing not pven the prospect of a terrible death can eliminate 
so -PRON- be that the british officer be in the group comprising jone and -PRON- twoofficer not forget old bill cuff who hold -PRON- to be the equal of any quarterdeck pacer 
the crew on the other hand form a little body of -PRON- own 
-PRON- outnumber the officer two to one and be equally well armed 
mark -PRON- word captain those fellow mean mischief say dale turn to jone 
jone eye snap as -PRON- reply well if -PRON- think -PRON- be go to put tongue to that poor fellow water -PRON- be much mistaken mischief or no mischief be with -PRON- capt jone in this say the britisher hope that the fact that i be -PRON- prisoner will not prevent -PRON- from let -PRON- draw -PRON- sword on -PRON- side if -PRON- come to a tussle 
not at all reply jone 
if -PRON- do indeed intend to mutiny every sword -PRON- have will improve -PRON- chance of beat -PRON- off 
at last the sailor who have approach jone before de tache -PRON- from -PRON- fellow and once more approach the commodore 
-PRON- and -PRON- mate have be talk this thing over -PRON- say and -PRON- have decide that the living have more right to the water than a fellow what canot last more than a few hour anyway 
despite the veiled threat in the man manner jone do not lose -PRON- temper 
surely -PRON- would not have -PRON- pass -PRON- last hour torture by the agony of thirst -PRON- ask 
-PRON- donot know nothing about that 
-PRON- want -PRON- right 
well what do -PRON- wish -PRON- to do 
jone be spar for time 
-PRON- see as soon as the man speak that -PRON- be in for a fight and every moment -PRON- could avert -PRON- while -PRON- decide on some plan of action would be to -PRON- advantage 
the man leer at -PRON- insolently 
all the conventionality that mark the quarterdeck intercourse between officer and man be at an end now 
the two group of man be alone on a deserted sea on a tiny and frail raft 
-PRON- be reduce to the situation of the primitive man to whom the battle for the necessity of life be a daily occurrence 
well do -PRON- get the water 
no ypu donot question and answer rang out sharp as rifle shot 
well -PRON- mean to have -PRON- in spite of -PRON- capt paul jone 
the young commander fist shoot out like a flash and the sailor who have address -PRON- be stretch on the flooring of the raft 
-PRON- mate utter a growl of rage as -PRON- advance threateningly toward the group of officer i 
-PRON- have draw -PRON- sea knife and cutlass and present a formidable appearance compare to the group of officer who await -PRON- come calmly 
the man whom jone have knock down lay like a stone as -PRON- have fall 
this put one of -PRON- foe out of the way 
hold on man cry dale raise -PRON- hand to com mand attention have -PRON- consider what -PRON- be about to do 
this be mutiny on the high sea 
-PRON- canot frighten -PRON- with -PRON- threat growl one of the seamen not on -PRON- cursed quarterdeck now but here as man to man -PRON- mean to drive -PRON- into the sea if -PRON- donot get that water 
well then -PRON- can try to drive -PRON- into the sea but i give -PRON- fair warning that if -PRON- attack -PRON- -PRON- will show -PRON- no mercy say jone 
the man make a concerted rush at these word 
the man who have address jone rush straight at -PRON- and aim a savage sweep of -PRON- great cutless at the young commander head 
jone blow and lunging run the fellow clean through the body 
at the same moment harkness the british officer ac count for another sword be knock out of -PRON- hand and the young ensign would have fare ijadly if -PRON- have not be for old bill cuff who seize the fellow who have strike the blow by the throat and hurl -PRON- into the sea as if -PRON- have be a stone 
then the fighting grow so fast that none of the participant have time to observe the movement of the other 
-PRON- be cut and thrust for dear life 
the young britisher be wound but fight doggedly on with the courage of -PRON- race and old cuff have get a slash over the arm 
on the other hand -PRON- have account for fully half -PRON- opponent and now the officer be evenly match 
slowly -PRON- drive the mutineer back to the edge of the raft the man make a desperate sortie but -PRON- heart be go and -PRON- lose two of -PRON- number in the assault 
at last -PRON- throw down -PRON- arm and call for quarter 
jone and -PRON- officer have win 
at that moment jimmy exclaim look 
-PRON- follow -PRON- gaze and see on the horizon a white sail 
-PRON- be as yet only hull down but at the pace -PRON- be come -PRON- soon make out that -PRON- carry royal and double spencer and be a craft of great speed 
as -PRON- draw near -PRON- reveal a double row of black andwhite port and a line of bright copper be a war ship exclaim dale 
beyond a doubt say jone but of what nation i can not yet make out 
harkness have remain silent since the sail have hove in sight 
all at once however -PRON- give a start and regard the ship earnestly can set -PRON- doubt at rest as to what the nationality of yon ship be -PRON- say 
-PRON- all lean forward to catch -PRON- word 
-PRON- be -PRON- majestys harpy and there on the horizon if -PRON- eye do not deceive -PRON- be two corvette and a brig of the same service 
this be about as bad as -PRON- could be 
the sloop have undoubtedly sight -PRON- for -PRON- have back -PRON- spencer and be round to as gracefully as a great swan know -PRON- skipper say harkness with a side glance at jone 
-PRON- be a man name grimstone and as big a martinet as there be in the british navy

-PRON- mean that there will be a courtmartial on board -PRON- in the morning and the prisoner will be paul jone harkness hang -PRON- head -PRON- could not tell the man -PRON- have grow to admire that in all probability -PRON- would be hang before dawn 
the sloop be round to and bring up with beautiful precision within a cable length of the raft 
a boat be lower and come fly through the water toward the castaway 
as -PRON- draw alongside a midshipman seat in the stern sheet hail -PRON-

indeed the british never dream of man pen as the yankee be make the attempt 
as soon as the sentrys footstep have die away harkness extend -PRON- hand 
jone grasp -PRON- and the british officer slip something hard and cold to the other 
-PRON- be a file 
then from the bosom of -PRON- loose deck coat -PRON- produce two longbarreled pistol and a brace of cutlass

eight bell chime out sharp and clear 
so far as the four prisoner could judge from the motion of the vessel -PRON- be a calm night which be so much the well for -PRON- if -PRON- could only get into the boat 
silently as a thief jone wrench off the file lock and liberty face the four american 
grasp -PRON- cutlass and the precious pistol in a determine grip -PRON- creep along the dark tween deck 
capt grimstone be a great economist and do not provide lantern for the low deck of -PRON- sloop except in time of action 
-PRON- be this fact which save the life of jone and -PRON- follower for as -PRON- advance from behind a bulkhead -PRON- come full on the two sentry steal a smoke in the embrasure of a gun 
-PRON- draw back without a sound and the man go on smoking afterward walk to the port and look out at the sea and talk after the manner of sentimental sailor of -PRON- sweetheart in the green lane of england 
now be -PRON- time and silently as cat the yankee slip up the companion 
-PRON- crouch in the shelter of -PRON- hood for a moment 
after a cautious reconnoitering of the deck however -PRON- deem -PRON- be safe to make -PRON- dash for freedom 
the night be as dark as a pocket and this fact un doubtedly save -PRON- from discovery 
for although -PRON- could not see -PRON- -PRON- could distinctly hear the tramp tramp of the lookout in the bow 
-PRON- creep aft keep carefully in thd shadow of the bulwark 
suddenly jone foot encounter something soft 
the something utter a grunt 
-PRON- be a man 
without a moment hesitation jone seize -PRON- by the throat and choke -PRON- into insensibility 
-PRON- be no time for half measure 
after this -PRON- meet with no obstacle till -PRON- come to the ladder lead to the poop deck 
-PRON- have either to climb this with the risk of be see or creep through the main cabin and drop out of the stern window 
-PRON- decide on the cabin 
-PRON- have cross -PRON- the soft carpet not make a sound and be wrench open one of the big stern window that ship of that day be fit with when there come an interruption 
a man carry a lantern come out of one of the berth open off the main cabin

one after the other -PRON- slide down -PRON- and into the boat 
as soon as -PRON- be all on board jone raise -PRON- cutlass 
harpy -PRON- say as -PRON- cut the painter when next -PRON- meet paul jone may be arrange a neck tie party of -PRON- own 
at this moment there come loud shout from the sloop which be fast vanish in the night 
-PRON- must have find capt grimstone say cuff with a grin 
well if -PRON- donot take -PRON- into -PRON- head to look for the boat -PRON- be all right reply jone 
apparently the britisher do not take -PRON- into -PRON- head to look for the boat for the cry die away and the little craft be alone on the sea 
do -PRON- not see some object out there to leeward sir 
ensign down of the american palla ask the question of capt crawford 
the young officer superior bring -PRON- telescope to bear on the object indicate 
why bless -PRON- soul

no say the captain glance at -PRON- consort which lie a short distance to windward for -PRON- have sight -PRON- too and be head for -PRON- 
who can -PRON- be sir do -PRON- think have no idea unless possibly part of the crew of the threedecker -PRON- sink just after poor paul jone and -PRON- ship be lose 
do -PRON- know sir i canot help think that in spite of -PRON- fear capt jone will turn up all right 
let -PRON- hope so -PRON- boy 
-PRON- do not know but that -PRON- may have get away in the fog 
then may that not be -PRON- boat the captain shake -PRON- head 
so far as i can see -PRON- be a britisher 
-PRON- boat be always paint as be this one 
from -PRON- build though -PRON- evidently belong to a manofwar 
hullo hullo -PRON- break off excitedly that 
-PRON- can not beyes -PRON- be though 
cheer boy 
cheer for all -PRON- be worth -PRON- cry turn to the crew 
paul jone be safe and in yond boat 
a deafening break from the throat of the man at the news that -PRON- beloved commander be safe 
surely no boat be ever lower more briskly than the one that drop from the side of the palla a moment after capt crawford have recognize the young leader of the american navy 
half an hour later jone with -PRON- officer be seat in the wardroom of the palla narrate -PRON- experience with the british and receive the congratulation of high and low 
-PRON- have only drift in the boat for a day and that -PRON- have be pick up so quickly by the pallas be ac count for by the fact that the american ship have spend the time since the suppose loss of -PRON- commodore in cruise about the neighboring ocean in the hope that -PRON- may find some trace of -PRON- fate 
the day be one of general rejoicing 
seat on the capstan head old cuff entertain the crew with a full and not too veracious narrative of -PRON- adventure 
-PRON- account serve to fan the flame of the men hatred for the british and not a soul before the mast on either of the yankee ship but be eager to tackle the king fleet once more 
jone and -PRON- officer have decide after a consultation to head for the coast of france 
-PRON- know that the british fleet be somewhere between -PRON- and the land of gaul but -PRON- trust to the nimbleness of -PRON- wit to escape -PRON- 
from where -PRON- now lay -PRON- be a sail provide the wind hold fair of only a few day before -PRON- could reach the french coast 
to reach america on the other hand would take some week 
as -PRON- be absolutely necessary to refit -PRON- craft -PRON- be decide to run into some port on the west coast of france 
a course be accordingly lay and a few day later -PRON- enter the channel 
the english channel be at that time as -PRON- be at the present day one of the most thoroughly patrol piece of water in the world 
the yankee commander hardly expect to gpt through without encounter some british ship do police work but -PRON- hope to get by through the exercise of -PRON- native wit 
during a calm which fall when -PRON- be still some three hundred mile wet of the scilly island the man be set to work paint out the port on the side of the two yankee ship and muss up -PRON- run gear and generally smart appearance till -PRON- look like two tired old geordie home from a cruise to the west indie 
thus disguise theyslippe past the lizard and into sacred water 
about the middle of the second day when with royal all rove any fashion and topsail timidly reef -PRON- be roll down the channel a dandy frigate of the british line hove in sight 
from topmast to kelson -PRON- speak of discipline 
there be write to the eye of the sailor in every halyard and in the graceful set of -PRON- mast 
down -PRON- bowl until -PRON- lie to within a few cable length of jone disguise craft 
then -PRON- back -PRON- topsail and lose way settle as gracefully as a rest swan on the rolling sea 
an officer resplendent in gold lace and brass button leap to -PRON- rail

jone wave -PRON- hand in true geordie fashion to signify that iff would obey and the topsail be swing round till the pallas be stationary 
the concord follow suit and soon the two vessel be as motionless as the frigate 
a boat come skim over the wave and a dandy young officer step superciliously up in the stem sheet -PRON- gangway -PRON- man -PRON- ask sharply -PRON- see the ladder ask jone that good enough for -PRON- -PRON- man 
none of -PRON- impudence -PRON- fine fellow or well send -PRON- to the bottom without much ceremony say the young officer as -PRON- place -PRON- foot on the ladder and proceed to climb up the side

jone be therefore fully prepared for this and accede to the other request with alacrity 
the young officer be somewhat surprised that jonesoffere no resistance to -PRON- demand but as -PRON- have size -PRON- up as a simple fellow -PRON- do not see anything suspicious in -PRON- 
jone excuse -PRON- and step below 
-PRON- whisper something to each man of the crew and soon the british officer boat be load to the gunwale with roughlooke sailor with no suggestion of train fighter about -PRON-

-PRON- deck be white as snow and from the tedpainte tompion of -PRON- gun to the snowy hammock lash along -PRON- rail -PRON- be as spick and span as a quakeress 
the young officer who have command the boat which impress jone crew lead the suppose merchant captain aft to the cabin under the poop deck 
-PRON- usher -PRON- with a bow into the luxurious cabin of the aristocratic commander and with a word of introduction and another bow leave -PRON-

if -PRON- could have speak much new profanity would have be add to the language of the sea but word fail -PRON- and -PRON- merely look as if -PRON- be about to suffer a fit of apoplexy 
as soon as the boat have receive -PRON- load of brassbuttoned and goldlace britisher the yard of the frigate be swing round and -PRON- slowly gather way follow by the palla and the concord 
as the cloth fill old cuff step nimbly aft and draw from -PRON- blouse the flag jone always use the sign of the coiled rattlesnake -PRON- bend -PRON- on the halyard 
as -PRON- break out at the peak the other two yankee ship fire a deafen salute and the cheer of the sailor rent the air 
what the boatful of british officer feel as -PRON- slowly drift astern -PRON- would be difficult to portray 
-PRON- stand up in the boat as fast as -PRON- sever -PRON- bond and shake -PRON- fist with vehement language at jone and the craft -PRON- have lately officer 
jone mount on the poop rail wave -PRON- hat in valediction as the bellona heel to the freshen wind excite yourself gentleman -PRON- cry -PRON- will soon fall in with some ship to rescue -PRON- and in the meantime think over the american navy and what -PRON- stand for

jimmy be frequently ashore with the other and find much to interest -PRON- in the place 
to get from the wharf to the main part of the little town -PRON- be necessary to take a narrow and illlighted street that be an ideal place for villainy of all kind 
one night when jimmy be pass through this on -PRON- way back to the boat -PRON- hear the scream of a woman from one of the dark alley that branch off 
the lad be not a moment in make up -PRON- mind to go to -PRON- assistance

-PRON- be evidently try to abduct -PRON- but in that low quarter of the town the scresgn of woman and the groan of the assassinate be such common sound after nightfall that no particular attention be pay to either one or the other 
the young american hurl -PRON- like a thunderbolt into the midst of the ruffian 
one of -PRON- clutch -PRON- by the throat but -PRON- pistol speak and the man fall back dead

dale seem to be greatly pleased at -PRON- commander communication and slap -PRON- knee as -PRON- exclaim capital 
the very thing 
-PRON- spend some time at the mouth of the river lie in near the bank where -PRON- be certain of not be observe and watch the light flit over the water as the ship boat pull from one vessel of the fleet to another 
-PRON- find that the observation of the number of ship in the squadron -PRON- have make from the hill be correct 
hello say jone suddenly point to a small sloopsofwar that lie moored dose inshore that fellow have a familiar look to -PRON-

tn fact by the time the tide begin to turn -PRON- have stow away a regular cargo on -PRON- 
at midnight the tide be high and the schooner which have be fit with sail and be paint up till -PRON- look like a war ship begin to glide slowly down the river 
but one man stand on -PRON- deck 
the night be too dark to reveal -PRON- feature but -PRON- evidently be under no apprehension of the british for -PRON- loll at the wheel as the ship slide along with as much nonchalance as if -PRON- have be steer a load of garden stuff to market instead of pilot a ship down a river the mouth of which be police by the british patrol fleet a keen observer would have notice however that -PRON- do not as be the custom among sailor smoke anything 
instead -PRON- hum a tune of old virginia and the water lap against the dingy side of the rickety old craft -PRON- steer be the accompaniment 
close behind the refit schooner creep the palla and the and the big bellow 
the former be slightly in the lead 
as the man on the schooner come within sight of the british vessel -PRON- drop -PRON- nonchalant air and run swiftly forward to the stem of -PRON- old craft 
-PRON- disappear down the forescuttle from which a faint glow be presently visible 
the next moment -PRON- reappear and run swiftly to the stern plunge overboard 
-PRON- swam to the bellona whose sail have be noiselessly lower through greased fall and clamber on board by the main chain 
thank god -PRON- be back safe captain exclaim dale as -PRON- wring the hand of -PRON- commander for the man who have pilot the mysterious schooner down the river be none other than paul jone the man the british have dub the tiger of the atlantic 
thank -PRON- dale -PRON- say as -PRON- shake the water out of -PRON- clothe and now to put the second part of -PRON- plot into execution 
s as -PRON- speak there be a burst of flame from the bow of the schooner and the loud report of a gun 
how do -PRON- arrange the lanyard of the gun ask dale in amazement at the firing of the gun from the now desert schooner 
by tie a piece of rope yarn to the lanyard and the rope attach a piece of rock and throw the whole thing over the side 
when the rock in trail along the bottom strike a submerged obstacle -PRON- jerk the lanyard and fire the gun the report of the cannon have set the british fleet in an uproar 
the sitting of battle lantern about -PRON- deck show the active preparation -PRON- be make to meet paul jone for -PRON- do not doubt that the schooner be one of -PRON- fleet 
in the meantime the craft that have cause all the excitement drift silently on until -PRON- be almost abreast of the big threedecker 
then -PRON- be see to change -PRON- course and run right in between two of -PRON- because of the peculiarity of the tide 
the britisher be take aback by such boldness but -PRON- salute -PRON- with a broadside that seem as if -PRON- would blow -PRON- out of the water 
-PRON- keep right on however and before the two bulky ship could get way on -PRON- -PRON- have lock yard with -PRON- 
at the same moment a tongue of livid flame creep from -PRON- hold and lick hungrily at the mast 
then the truth burst on the british 
-PRON- be lock inextricably with a fireship 
hardly a second elapse from the time the first bluish flame have creep from the hold full of tar and oil the fireship carry before great yellow sheet of fire be shoot high into the air 
the british fight like demon to shove off from -PRON- deadly foe but -PRON- spar be already on fire and the man be leap overboard in wild terror 
high and high shoot the flame and the roar of the fierce volcano could be hear as far as the town 
the glare light up the sea as by day and in the midst of the panic that have fall on the british the sea eagle make -PRON- swoop 
out from the mouth of th river dash -PRON- three vessel 
before the british know what be happen -PRON- be upon -PRON- and hurl -PRON- deadly iron rain right and leave 
suddenly a terrific explosion rent the air

the explosion send a perfect rain of flame ember and redhot bolt over the rest of the vessel 
jone ship be undamage for before go into action the sail and spar have be thoroughly wet down to avoid -PRON- catch fire from the blaze rain 
-PRON- be far otherwise with the british however 
-PRON- ship catch on fire in a dozen place at once and -PRON- crew have to leave the gun to fight the flame that threaten to destroy -PRON- 
in the thick of the inferno of flame and noise and smoke one of the great threedecker the one that have bepn undamage drift down on jone ship and open a grueling fire on -PRON- 
on the other side be jone old enemy the harpy 
-PRON- have never be in a bad position 
from both side the iron hail be hurl into -PRON- ship till -PRON- seem -PRON- must be tear apart 
the night be light up by the wild light of the burn ship and never do battlefield more resemble the infernal region than do the scene about the three vessel that lie lock together and fight handtohand 
man strip to the waist and stain with blood and powder man the gun with a frenzy bom of the desperate nature of the fight 
from time to time a man fall at -PRON- gun with the rammer in -PRON- hand and in a moment another would have snatch -PRON- up and prod the charge home 
the deck be slippery with blood and dim with smoke 
the acrid reek of burn powder be thick over everything and the smoke from the burn ship dim men eye and choke -PRON- throat 
in the midst of this inferno while the cannon belch -PRON- deadly content a chance bullet shoot down the coiled rattlesnake flag of america from the peak of the bellona 
-PRON- be paul jone -PRON- who snatch up the fall flag and springing into the shroud amid a hailstorm of bullet fasten -PRON- once more to the halyard and run -PRON- aloft 
a cheer break from the tired man at the gun as -PRON- witness the heroic deed of -PRON- young leader 
the sight of the gallant flag once more wave amid the thickhanging smoke lend the yankee fresh courage 
cheer -PRON- beat back the boarder from the threedecker and lead by jone advance to drive back the horde of british bluejacket that be pour over the side from the harpy
