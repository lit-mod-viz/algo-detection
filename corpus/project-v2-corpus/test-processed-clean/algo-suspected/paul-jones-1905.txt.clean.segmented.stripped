capt paul jones col washington
ah
he comes by appointment mr henry
pray admit him
patrick henry pulled the door wide open
come in captain he smiled expected
the young planter entered the room and was greeted with warm handclasps from the other two gentlemen washington and mr hewes
you have been for some time in williamsburg paul said mr hewes and i regret that i could not have seen you before but col washington and mr henry have told me what you discovered to the south of norfolkhow british mercenaries are committing piratical acts our shores under supposed connivance of ministers of the crown a gallant service observed col washington hut no more than might be expected from capt jones patrick thin face grew animated and his eyes sparkled
i am sore mistaken said he we shall stand in need of such a man as paul jones before we are many months older
we stand in need of him now returned mr hewes
that is why he is here added col washington sword said the young captain gallantly and my life as well are at the service of these oppressed colonies
i am a virginian to the core henry leaned forward and dropped a hand on his arm
sav rather capt paul he broke in that you are an american
that is better than saying you are a virginian
we are all americans
and thus early did patrick henry voice a sentiment which later in that memorable year of was to ring through carpenters hall in philadelphia
under the noble magic eloquence it was to carry the continental congress by storm
ay cried the young planter clapping hand to the sword at his side and straightening his broad shoulders am an american an it please you arid hope in my soul that presently i may have a chance to prove my right to the title
the older men smiled approval of the youths enthusiasm
your sloop is handily by capt paul queried mr hewes
in the york river sir off yorktown
and you are ready for a quick journey back to her
my boy caesar is holding the horses at the tavern door
i take the road the minute i leave this room
always ready murmured col washington a shade of admiration crossing his grave features
the conference was being held in the best room of master coffee house in nicholson street
the conversation when it came to the particular matter these discoveries of deep significance to the patriot leaders in the colonies at this time were made by the dashing young sailorplanter several days before
the chronicle of his thrilling adventures that led up to the discoveries is set forth in
no of the paul jones weekly paul jones swainp trail the coast raiders that concerned the patriots was in low voices and every thing else had been done to insure its privacy
from the breast of his broadcloth coat mr hewes drew a small ebony box
this box capt paul said he placing the object on the table contains instructions and other papers of great value
were they to fall into the hands of the kings men the kings ministers would make the lot of these devoted colonies even more bitter and unhappy than it is at presentand we have woes enough now heaven knows
there is no one to whom i could intrust the box with more confidence than to you
yovuare to take it to your plantation guard it with your life if necessary andj deliver it only to the man who will call for it with a written order from mr adams
that man an he be the right one has the key
to make assurance doubly sure you will have him produce the key and open the box in your presence
you may rely upon me sir said paul jones calmly
who is this man who is to call for the box
mr hewes exchanged glances with air
henry and col washington
that he went on cannot tell you
the box will be called for and you are to deliver it whenyou have made certain the man who calls is entitled to it
very well gentlemen the matter will be attended to in exact accordance with your instructions
mr hewes drew a long breath feel even safer with the box in your possession than in my own he murmured
perform this service faithfully and i assure you you hqve friends who will not forget it
if i am aiding the cause of america against an unjust king answered paul jones the work is its own reward
once more the patriot leaders pressed his hand warmlyj capt paul stowed the little box safely way in the breast of his coat and took his departure
as he descended the stairs and passed through the long wellfilled public room of the coffee house a started up from an obscure corner
i he was a heavyset broadshouldered person and alj though he wore a shirt of coarse dowlas and leather breeches the roll in his gait would have proved to anyone that his calling was the sea
furthermore his head was bound in a piece of dirty
inen and from under the bandage his eyes glared tigershly at capt paul
for a moment the man stood watching the retreating orm of the young sailorplanter then hurriedly passed tut of the room at a side entrance
in front of the coffee house a negro lad was sitting one horse and holding another by the reins
all right caesar asked capt paul taking the reins rom the negros hand
all right marse paul answered caesar
is we wine to yawktown sah
with all dispatch
capt paul swung to the saddle
he did not start immediately but pulled up in a glow light that issued from a window of the coffee house
taking a pair of pistols from their red velvet holsters front of him he examined them carefully
must be marse is lookin fo trouble on de tawktown road thought caesar then he chuckled
golly
if any trouble comes suah hate to be at de dder end ob it when marse has dem flintlock oppin machines in his hands
having satisfied himself that the pistols were in orer capt paul thrust them back into their holsters gathred up the reins and spurred along the darkened and alfdeserted street
presently they turned from nicholson into duke of gloucester street a broad unpaved dusty thoroughare edged with mulberries and poplars and stretching rom the gate of william and mary college to the brick iqade of the capitol
here gay blades of the town in groups or singly vere proceeding homeward lighted on their way by pluttering flambeaus in the hands of linkboys
many a rollicking and halftipsy song was in the air mt young capt paul gave no attention to sights or mounds along theway
with bowed head he rode onward caesar following him y two or three horses lengths
skirting a meadow that formed part of the college grounds they plunged through a grove of elms and vere soon fairly on the road to the york river
here capt paul struck into a planters pace pulling iis riding cloak snugly about him to keep out the flying lust
the miles slipped away from under his horses hoofs
the youth could feel the ebony box pressing against his breast under his waistcoat and the thought that he was to gain the york without placing the precious papers in jeopardy filled him with deep satisfaction
nevertheless in capt life he had been taught that the unexpected was the thing that usually happened
in a little while the horseman descended a low hill and when they reached the foot of it the glimmer of a light was seen in advance in a tangle of timber that edged both sides of the road
sounds reached the ears of capt paul tooa tramp as of frightened horses coupled with an oath in a hoarse voice
a moment later there came a wild call in shrill feminine tones help
oh is there no one to protect me
help
the gallant young planter was not the one to hang back in the face of such an appeal
since his sword was ever his favorite weapon he drew it shouted for caesar to follow and raced toward the light ahead
as he drew nearer the flickering gleam resolved itself into a lanthom carried beside a driver on a ponderous coach
the coach had four sable horses attached and at the heads of the leaders was a mounted man barring the way and pointing a pistol at the negro on the box
another man had dismounted at the coach door which was flung open
in a twinkling capt paul drew a pistol with his left hand and fired at the fellow at the horses headsfired as he galloped and with the dark night making him none too sure in his aim
capt paul could use either hand with equal facility and but for the darkness and the wild pace at which he rode he well knew that the bullet would have found its mark
as it was the man at the horses heads fired a weapon of his own so that a bullet sang uncomfortably close to capt ear
after making use of his own pistol the fellow wheeled about and vanished in the darkness of the timber
the young planter swept on toward the other man
that individual however showed the white feather
hurling himself astride his horse he was away before the young planters slashing sword could reach him
capt paul did not give pursuit his concern was chiefly for the woman in distress whose voice had brought him to the scene
pulling his horse back opposite the swinging coach door he peered into the interior of the vehicle
the darkness there was so intense he could see nothing
oh mah po missis wailed the black coachman
what have dem robbahs done to mah po missis he started as though he would abandon the four plunging horses leap to the ground and investigate his mistress condition
had he carried out his intention a runaway would have been imminent
stay where you are ordered capt paul and hold the horses then leaning further into the coach he cried say madame
are you alone
i trust you are uninjured
a choking moan was the only reply
hastily sheathing his sword capt paul slipped clear of the saddle and climbed into he coach
in another instant a pair of steellike arms went round him and he was thrown backward upon one of the seats
simultaneously the door of the coach was slammed shut and thereupon a voice hissed in his ear those papers
give me those papers intrusted to you by the archtraitors washington hewes and henry or by heaven your life pays the forfeit
capt paul jones had been neatly trapped
nothing but the appeal of a woman seemingly in distress could have tempted him to hazard the valuable box so recently consigned to his care
the villainous play had been bravely carried out and at no little risk to the players
the patriot leaders who had requested jones to take the box to his plantation and hold it until called for had thrown as much secrecy as possible about theirjdans and operations
that the secret of the papers was out was due rather to tory guile and vigilance rather than to any lack of cautiousness on the part of the patriots
while not expecting to encounter difficulties capt paul was on the alert for them but he would have looked upon himself as a heartless wretch had he passed a woman who needed aid and failed to give it
the two men who had seemingly fled had presumabl not retired far enough to get out of the plot
one or other pf them had slammed the coach door
directly after the hissing demand for the papers h been made the black coachman put his four horses the gallop and the lumbering vehicle swayed and bounds at a terrific speed
although trapped the daring young captain was ni captured
you get nothing from me he cried defiantly exeri ing all his wonderful strength
struggle at your peril capt jones came a woman voice with a hiss like a venomous serpent
here
do feel this
a point of cold steel was pressed against the youn captains forehead
we take the papers the merciless voice went ot whether it be from you alive or dead
the blank darkness inside the coach prevented paul from seeing a thing
he was fighting in the dark with a woman and a ma for his unknown foes
without the coach he knew there were at least thre more enemiesthe negro driver and the two miscreanj who had simulated flight in order to avoid his weapons
much as he disliked battling with a woman no oth choice was left open to the young captain
although somewhat slender and of only mediup height capt paul had a superb breadth of shoulders ah was noted for his strength and prowess
his arms were pinioned at his sides by the man but feet were free and he used them with such sudden an telling effect that the woman was thrown back in tl coach with a cry of pain her pistol dropping frem hand
capt paul then gave his attention to the man
the swaying of the coach rolled them from ttye seal at that precise instant the young captain summoned a his strength for a supreme effort and broke from antagonists arms
the report of a pistol followed and it must have bee the woman who fired for capt enemy with groan of pain tumbled helplessly at the young planter feet
a cry of consternation broke from the womans lips
the moment was ripe for escape and capt paul too advantage of it had he not been the guardian of that ebony box he mild have followed his bent and remained with his uniown enemies until there had been developments more accord with strict justice as it was he felt that he bst not tarry a moment now that escape lay open to to
with a stout kick he sent the coach door crashing outiard
wounded though the other man was he made one delairing effort to detain paul jones
there was a final struggle albeit a brief one and hen the young planter gained the roadwhich he did on xnds and knees and roughly as might be expected was gripping a memento of the baffled plot in the lape of a wig
the two horsemen who had enacted the role of robts were galloping along ahead of the coach which was veling in the direction of williamsburg they had heard the shooting and had witnessed the ung planters leap into the road
the black tugged at the reins and the horsemen started ck
at the selfsame moment the frightened caesar came sloping up with his masters horse
is dat you marse queried the black peerg at the figure in the road
ay caesar answered capt paul springing erect
is yo hurted marse
in no way was the answer as the young captain iped to his horses back and drew from its holster the stol he still had
a shot over his left arm wounded one of the approachg riders and immediately he used his spurs and charged other
this onslaught from a man who appeared to be inncible was too much for the rascals and they whirled td fled in the wake of the coach the uninjured man sup rting his wounded comrade
capt paul drew rein and faced the other way with a rim laugh rogues have had their trouble and some hard faling for their pains he muttered think twice fcfore they attempt to trick paul jones in that way gam yo gwine to foller em marse asked caesar who well knew what a hot spark his faster was when dealt with as he had been that night no caesar was the reply
there is other business in hand and we have scant time
there is an ordinary near here an i mistake not
we will take a short rest at the place
the ordinary was at a crossroads half a mile further on the way to the york
its windows were dark but a few lusty blows on the front door brought a glow from above and a nightcapped head was thrust out and demanded their business
half an hours rest and a bottle of madeira answered paul jones
at the same time friend i would have a few words with you on an important matter
the landlord hastily dressed himself descended and admitted capt paul into the public room
the madeira was set forth and a glass of it ordered to be taken to caesar who was looking to the horses
while the landlord was in front of his establishment the young captain examined the wig that had come with him out of the coach
it was a blenheim wig of goats hair bushy at the sides and with a long plaited tail ornamented with a ribbon at the top of the braid and at the bottom
the color was black and on one side the hair wore a brown and singed look
capt paul seemed startled
he had seen such a wig not many days before and was wondering if it were possible to identify the wearer of the wig by the wig itself
when the landlord returned the young captain began to quiz him
are we the first travelers you entertained this night
nay sir replied the landlord my establishment was honored by a lady of quality who came to it in a coach and four with a black for driver and two outriders and a companion who i took it was more a guard than a friend
when was this asked capt paul
the landlords description tallied with the party just met and worsted on the road
they came some two hours since and bided until half an hour agone when a strapping big fellow in dowlas shirt and leathern breeches his head swathed in a bandage came and had talk with the lady and her escort
they left immediately after
tell me m re about this man who seemed to be the ladys companion
he was brown sir almost like an indian and wore jack boots and talked and walked like a sailor
by my faith ye have there his wig or one like it
the landlord pointed to the piece of headgear on the table
did you learn the name of the lady or of any of her companions asked capt paul
nay sir they were closemouthed and said little in my hearing
did the man with the bandage around his head go away with the rest think not
when the coach left i did not see hint among the others
however he went from the inn at the same time the rest did
the young planter would have asked more questions but at that juncture caesar was heard from
marse marse the boy was excited over something as the young planter could easily tell
leaping up from the table he ran out of the inn the landlord tight at his heels
exciting events were crowding fast upon each other that night
when capt paul reached the entrance he saw a most surprising scene in the light that came from the public room of the inn
caesar was sitting up on the ground a few feetaway from his horse
he was holding his woolly head in his hands and had evidently been struck from the saddle with a fierce blow
a large man wearing dowlas shirt and leather breeches and having his head bandaged was trying to mount the negros horse
with one foot in the stirrup the man was seeking to rise to the saddle but the horse no doubt frightened by the rough work that had just been done across its back was leaping sideways so that the man was obliged to hop on one foot and could not find opportunity to mount
the fellow was swearing heartily
at sight of capt paul and the landlord the man made one more desperate attempt the fellow we were speaking afyut sir l cried the landlord
the horse still further terrified by the hurried appro of capt paul and the landlord reared upward
the man who was seeking to mount was cast to ground and came within an ace of being trampled ouj breaking from his hand the horse snorted and gallop along the road
take my mount caesar cried capt paul and cat the other horse
the black regained his feet and was soon in oq saddle
while he dashed away after the horse the yovu planter took after the man who had caused the trouble that worthy recognizing his peril sprang up ai flung away into the darkness as fast as his legs coo carry him
he did not keep to the road but turned from it it the brush and timber at the roadside
capt paul knowing he would have a bootless chase he gave pursuit returned to the inn regained posse sion of the wig and stood in the door with the landlo awaiting the return of the black boy
if that rascal had a horse said capt paul w should he want another
his horse was far spentj sir answered the landloi noticed that when he left here lay ye a punches that he and the rest o the rascally crew are ripe for tf hangman
but the woman
she seemed like a persi of consequence sir and it passed my wits that should be in such company
was there anything about her by which she cov be identified if seen again
there was a scar as i remember or a birthmai it may be on her right cheek a little red line shape like a letter and she was passing fair sir though i can take my oath not over young
but tb wig
may i ask how you came in possession of it capt paul did not set the landlords mind at rest a to the way he had secured the blenheim wig
caesar came clattering up just then leading the rq away horse
under cover of his arrival capt pi found it easy to ignore the landlords question got de horse marse said caesar
how came you to lose him lad you seen dat man wif de cloth tied round his haidi yes
well sah i sat heah waitin fo you when dat ffl comes round de conah ob de inn
he comes so suddc dat mah horse begins to rar an while trying to iet de horse dat man comes longside an give me a tow on de side ob de haid dat makes me see stahs
next knowed i was on de ground an de man was trvin to ft on de back ob mah horse
den you come marse ipn an you know de rest
barring a slight delay said capt paul swinging to own saddle when caesar had changed horses pie the worse off for the rascals attempt to get away ith the mount got a roarin in mah eahs marse dats far from mfotable muttered caesar tenderly rubbing the side his head
the young planter paid no attention to the rueful reark but loaded his pistols and returned them care3 lly to the red velvet holsters then settling with the idlord he clapped spurs to his horse and was soon off ce more on the way to yorktown
the young patriot was not a little puzzled in his mind from all he could learn the man who had assisted the iman inside the coach was none other than a piratical alawag who sailed under the name of cockle
paul thought he had left skipper cockle in the ieat swamp south of norfolk and thus to encounter m after a lapse of several days on the road to york iver was in the nature of a tremendous surprise
cockle bearing capt paul a black grudge had sworn have his life
this vow in nowise worried the young planter for he is ready to settle scores with cockle wherever and whener that worthy deemed best to try conclusions
by the same token the fellow with the bandaged head as recognized by capt paul as righthand bn
if it hadnot been for the young planter the rascals jad would never have needed a bandage so the rogue id sufficient cause for enmity on his own account
but how was it that skipper cockle and the disguised man had trimmed their sails on this new kk bothered the young planter not a little
the woman in the case did not cause him so much pnder
she was probably tory and filled with an ardent desire help the kings cause no matter to what extreme she tight be driven such thoughts as these capt paul beguiled the fmainder o his journey
by dawn heand caesar had reached yorktown and had returned their hired mounts to the liveryman of whom they had been secured for the ride to williamsburg and by early morning the two had rejoined the twentyton sloop belonging to capt paul and she was picking her way down the river
the winds served poorly and it was the forenoon of the next day before the boat drove into the rappahannock
capt paul was standing well forward with alec gilpin a lad who had accompanied him on the cruise to norfolk as the drew in sight of the plantation
the warehouse and the landing unfolded slowly before their eyes
great jemimy captain cried alec a crowd around your warehouse an it ainot a crowd o blacks neither
the young planter had already descried the throng
when the sloop came closer he made out the faces of some of the neighboring planters and also discovered that his landing was filled with barges and other small craft such as those from the river plantations used when they went avisiting one another
there must be something in the wind said capt paul
you bet averred alec his eyes brightening at the prospect of excitement lot o niggers have run away i reckon an the planters have come to get you to tell em what to do
whenever anythin goes wrong up or down the river its capt paul they look to
the sight of the sloop sweeping in toward the landing caused the crowd to break up and scatter along the wharf waving hats and kerchiefs
foremost of them all was the young planters brave and efficient overseer the highlander duncan macbean
the dress was ordinary plantation garb save as to his headgear for he was topped with a highland bonnet
he waved the bonnet and shouted a cheery greeting
his words were taken up by others in the crowd
capt paul back again
bravo capt paul
sure he couldnot have come at a more opporchune time glad we are to see ye back lad
huzza for the captain
huzza
there was no room just then for the sloop at her usual moorings so the young captain had sail in and anchor dropped a cables length off the landing then the gig was lowered away and he got into it with alec cato and scip and was quickly ashore
old duncan grabbed his hand fervently as he sprang from the boat his honest weatherbeaten face aglow with happiness
lpsh man cried duncan gude to press your hand again heard o your luck but fine i knew yed succeed when ye left the plantation thematter here duncan inquired the young planter curiously
why have so many of my neighbors come together in this fashion
hoot lad theres rare mischief afoot
come up by the warehouse and yell learn it all sune enough i promise ye
the next moment the youth was fairly surrounded by some of the crowd and almost carried to the vicinity of the warehouse where the rest of the throng was waiting
in die crowd were bob tichenor from across the river nathan kaggs samuel swallow james ludwell and morris stringham from up the stream and messrs
hapwell bruton and brave terence omalley from below there were others also from the country to the south
although at this time capt paul had been less than two years in virginia yet he made friends easily and was popular with all the planters in the vicinity of the rappahannock
he was a dashing young spark loved his adopted country with all his heart and soul and was ready at all times with his sword or his fists to avenge a personal affront or give aid to a friend
among the planters there were kings men as well as patriots but enmity between the two factions was not yet so open and bitter as at a later period
paul jones was a redhot whig and was proud of it
not only did he proclaim just what he was so there could be no possible doubt on the subject but he made no secret of his affiliations with washington henry and die rest of the patriot clique
samuel swallow from up the river was the most inveterate tory of any of the kings men that day assembled at capt plantation
master swallow was as round as a rum cask had very red face and a much redder nose wore a tenpo wig dressed in cherrycolored silk gave the latest to his hat and strutted as he walked
he was cordially disliked even by the tories
wbever there was anything of importance going forward always tried to make himself the leader
he sat on a bench by the warehouse taking snuff a gold box as the young captain drew near surround by omalley ludwell and a few of the younger set snapping shut the lid of the snuffbox master sw low floundered to his feet and leaned heavily on his cai an it please you capt jones he puffed we y neighbors have assembled here this morning to take coi sel concerning a number of outrages that have been per trated on our plantations
master swallow waved his right hand pompously a thrust it into his ruffled bosom
a laugh went up from omalley and others
young alec gilpin was standing behind master sw low his nose in the air leaning on a stick which he in his left hand and his other hand thrust gracefully the breast of his leather jacket
every move made by the fat tory was perfectly mi icked by alec even the coonskin cap which the boy w was cocked overhis left eye
the effect was ridiculous to say the least
failing to grasp the cause of the laughter
mast swallow glared indignantly
this gentlemen he cried pounding the ground wi his cane is no time for levity
i am astonished tl you should treat the matter in that way
we must mi the issue courageouslycourageously i repeat or tl organized band of robbers will leave us without hot and home
he withdrew his hand from among the ruffles a stroked his chin
alec had also thumped the earth with his stick raisj his eyebrows and began stroking his chin
the boys face was gravity itself and the laught increased
master wrath continued to rise
all at once he glanced around and saw alec little imp of the archfiend puffed
sw low
how dare you you young scalawag make spc of your betters cane ye by gad flourishing his cane the for alec to elected to take account of the bench that was between to and the boy
stumbling over the bench
master swallow went down a heap his fat legs thrashing the air
in some way he got on his back and was as helpless that position as a turtle
faith laughed omalley these kings men are lie good when ye have their backs to our good virlia soil
steady away master swallow be so e with your cane but give us your hand
capt paul and omalley taking the fat gentlemans nd on either side lifted him to his feet
ludwell picked up the threecorned hat and placed it the big wig
gad fumed swallow his face purple with rage come here to be insulted
alec said capt paul repressing his merriment with ficulty and trying to be stem you should pay more ipect to master swallow
beg his pardon lad for ur apish tricks was all humility as he came closer to the tory
forgive me sir said he was but trying to leam jirpolished manner which is the talk of all virginia give my eyeteeth sir an i was as courtly and grace swallow was as proud as a peacock
he wanted to considered the beau brummel of the colony and was ft enough to take flattery in sober earnest
ha he cried casting a look at the planters about em even the young are quick to appreciate the courtly aces
then placing a fat hand on head he ent on ye do well lad to imitate those who by itural study and aptitude have made themselves the ass of fashion and the mold of form
omalley snickered behind his hand and all the others id to turn their heads to hide their smiles or their disst alex continued to be meek and humble
reaching into is breeches pocket he brought out an old horn snuffbox allow me sir he said presenting the box to swalfw with a flourish and a bow
bravo cried swallow
but you can improve on pat lad
try it once morelike this
and swallow pulled out his own box swept it through ie air and bowed with his hat against his ruffles
alec copied the maneuver and master swallow graciously accepted the old horn box and took a liberal pinch of its contents in each nostril
then alec with astonishing alacrity started for the woods
pepper he yelled between bursts of impish laughter
the tory fairly bellowed in his wrath
with all his might he hurled the horn box after the prankish lad then fell to sneezing and coughing until the tears rolled down his cheeks his hat flew off his wig came awry and he tumbled back on the bench at thesneeze for this
when he recovered a little he got on his feet and sneezed out a call for his blacks
when they came he sneezed himself down to the landing sneezed himself into the boat and went sneezing up the river
fiend take me said omalley leaning against the warehouse and laughing till he cried our tory friend has sneezed more in the last five minutes than he has in a whole twelvemonth back
when the planters had somewhat recovered from their mirth capt paul asked to know the purpose of the meeting
our plantations are being harried by a gang of robbers capt paul said morris stringham
everyone here has suffered more or less
plate and money have been stolen from my house hogshead of wintercured was taken from my warehouse spoke up james ludwell and one of my blacks who heard the marauders and tried to stop them was shot and killed
and said bruton found a writing pinned to my door saying that if i did not leave a hundred gold guineas at the foot of the black rock on st day one of my tobacco houses would be fired
and if the money was not left at the rock on the day following the other house would be burned
did you leave the money
master bruton inquired capt paul
not on the first call
and one of your tobacco houses was burned ay to the ground
next day i left the money and tother house was spared also have lost tobacco reported hapwell as well as indian corn
id and by the same token put in omalley the blackguards raided my place and took away a pair of fine flintlocks and a supply of powder and ball
all had had their say save duncan macbean
capt paul looked at him
hdith captain said duncan lost nothing as yet but yesterday morning as i came frae the house i found this arrow athwart the step
an indian arrow crosswise of the threshold meant war
capt paul took the arrow as the overseer handed it over and snapped it in half
and on the house door proceeded duncan taking a folded paper from the crown of his bonnet found this capt paul read the paper
capt paul jones will leave five hundred golden guineas at the black rock on tuesday night or his warehouse will be burnt an he leaves not the guineas the day following his grist mill follows the warehouse
signed old truepenny tyburn
every eye was on the young planter
with a disdainful laugh he tore the note in pieces and cast the pieces to the winds
what answer captain asked duncan surveying the other planters with a proud smile on his grizzled face
go to the slave quarters duncan said capt paul and find me a rattlesnake skin
bring with it a horn of powder and a bullet pouch
the work was quickly performed then capt paul pushed the broken arrow into the snakeskin and packed it round with powder and ball
there duncan said he handing the stuffed snakeskin to the overseer when old truepenny comes to the black rock tonight hunting his golden guineas let him find that
duncan macbean was never prouder of the young planter than he was at that moment
old truepenny has a man o parts to deal wi now ye ken he exclaimed broadly to the planters lad cried bruton lose your warehouse and mill een as i lost my tobacco house
let ole truepenny try his tricks here answered capt paul and hell have an ounce ball in his robbers heart tell me has nothing been done to bring these thieves to book much captain said omalley but to no avail
sure weve followed their trail with the dogs but trail vanishes into the water and the dogs are at sea
neighbors said capt paul this work is to my ing
since i am sending old truepenny my defiance is fair to suppose that my plantation will be his field operations for the next few days so the rest of you nf feel secure give you my promise that i will lay him and his throat crew by the heels and rid the rappahannock them for all time
will ye need help my lad asked terence omalk an i do replied capt paul have duncan aj he is a host in himself
caesar approached at that moment
marse said he a coach at de do o de mansion an a lady askin for marse paul
she she bliged tuh stop case her mammy done took sick de way
capt paul excused himself to the planters a started for the house
the planters having finished business that brought them together took to their bc and departed for their estates
a chariot drawn by tw white horses was at the of the house overlooking the highroad
the black driver was on the ground at the head the horses evidently waiting for the master of the ma sion to appear
doleful moans were coming from inside the charil and capt paul hat under his arm stepped to the opjj door
the young planter because of his dashing mann ready courage and courtly bearing was equally popul among the lasses of tidewater virginia as among lads
within the chariot were two ladies one young ag dressed in dimity her slippers giving a glimpse of neat turned ankles in silken hose beautifully clocked w fancy designs
on her right cheek was a black patch cut in form a crescent
such patches were much worn by ladies the day but this it seemed to the young planter overlarge
this young lady was as beautiful as anv the you captain had met in the colonies ir companion was middleaged and in brocade much as he did a is saying a good she was being supported by the younger woman who the same time was using a small phial of smelling jts
at your service ladies said capt paul with a low tfw
sir returned the younger woman am miss betsy yonin of williamsburg and this is my mother
we are i our way to samuel plantation beyond the ver but mother has been taken ill with megrims and we fcnnot travel further today
if we could find some refife until tomorrow my house madame is at your service
there are no jmen folk about the place but i assure you you will be safe in the home of capt paul jones as in your own sace at williamsburg
the megrims was a fashionable complaint of the y and in these times would be referred to as a headhe
if the chariot was bound for master betnd the river it was somewhat out of its course as it ould have taken a road several miles to the west and ossed the rappahannock at ferry
the young planter made no comment on this point it called caesar to take the hand bags and cato to help je black coachman put up the horses and then supported jame cronin into the house and upstairs to the best iamber
mistress betsy followed and when they were safe in eir room capt paul ordered his old housekeeper to fend to their wants
duncan macbean was in the great living room when ipt
paul entered it after seeing to the comfort of his tests
two ladies are to be with us overnight said the tung planter
they are the cronins of williamsburg pther and daughter and are bound for master tories growled duncan macbean
he had fought with the redcoats under braddock and id been in at defeat when but for washgton every redcoat and provincial would have bit dust
washington had been despised by the regular britishs and his advice had not been taken
macbean could not forget this and he hated a tory as deal
why he demanded are they near this plantation if they are bound for samuel twere impolite to inquiry duncan smiled capt paul
they are here for the night and are to be well cared for
the elder lady is ill but tomorrow they will go on to master stepping to the great fireplace the young planter ran his fingers over the front of the blue tiles
suddenly the fingers paused pressed upon a certain spot and the face of one of the tiles swung noiselessly outward revealing a small aperture behind it
you know of this place duncan said capt paul
many a time i have stored valuable papers in this place
look
the youth drew the little ebony box from his breast and held it up for the inspection see lad said the overseer
this is to be guarded with your life if necessary duncan went on capt paul placing the box in the hiding place and pushing the tile shut
it is the overseer sprang up hastily approached a hall door with catlike softness and flung it quickly open
after looking about the hall for a space he reclosed the door and came back to his young masters side
what is it queried the youth thought i heard a noise replied duncan
there is no one in the house save you and the housekeeper and the two ladies above stairs natheless i thought i heard some one at the door insisted duncan
but you did not saw no one lad
but the box
ye say it is to be guarded
we must be watchfu concernin it
ay for the good of the colonies duncan
you are as much a patriot as i am
if these thieves who are prowling about the plantations should come upon us do you guard the fireplace and leave me to attend to the marauders
ay lad that i will
and if anything should happen to me that box is to be given over to the man who calls for it with a letter from mr adams an he be the right man he will have a key to fit the box which you will have him open before you
should evil befall ye haud fast to the box till the right man comes but ye are no in much danger from these night prowlers thinkin
still said paul tis best to be on the safe side
have you had my defiance taken to old truepenny
it has gone to the black rock fjcip took it
alec has some powder aboard the sloop
let him have the barge with cato and enough blacks to man it to take the powder upriver to his father at the ferry
ay sir
and post guards at the warehouse night and day
i hope old truepenny and his rascals will come
an they do duncan i can pick up their trail with the dogs will take care to guard against fire captain
duncan left soon after receiving his instructions and the young planter filling the bowl of a churchwarden from a jar of tobacco on a table settled himself by a window to smoke and reflect
while he was never happier than when actively engaged in some such work as trailing down this band of freebooters he liked it little that such work should come upon him at the very time he was taking care of the ebony box
but with the active aid of brave old duncan he had little doubt of his ability to acquit himself well of both duties
he hoped as he sat there smoking that mistress betsy cronin would favor him with a glimpse of herself and a brief chat but she did not
instead the housekeeper came to announce that dame cronin was still too ill to leave her chamber or allow her daughter to leave
if it pleased the master of the house they would like their meals in their room
the young captain gave orders in accordance with this request
the afternoon he spent on horseback riding over the estate with the overseer
the ladies sent down another excuse and their evening meal like their dinner was sent up to them
duncan had made some attempt at quizzing the black who had driven the chariot to the door but the slave might as well have been deaf and dumb so far as anything could be learned of hint
following supper duncan was posted in the living room
a conch covered with deerskins was to be his bed for the night and there was a tankard of bombo forhis use set out on the table
the overseer as the saying is slept always withi eye open
the slightest noise would waken him out slumber
as for the young planter he went to the wareho where scip and cato were watching
these black boys were particular favorites with ti master because of their courage and faithfulness
they were armed with firelocks and in addition cutlasses at their sides
the sloop had been moored at her old berth against t landing and opposite the warehouse
capt paul sprang to her silent deck and groped way down the companion and into the after cabin
life ashore was never much to his mind what loved was a heaving deck under his feet and but for sloop which had come to him with the plantation could hardly have contented himself on his estate
in the cabin he was close enough to the warehotj to be of assistance if needed and without striking a ligl he stretched himself out in his berth sword and pist within easy reach
dozing in a half slumber he did not know how ma minutes or hours had passed when abruptly he starl to a sitting posture in his bunk
a noise as of a boat rubbing against the sloops si had reached his ears
this was followed by shuffling catlike steps on deck overhead and then a moment later the slo seemed to be in motionthe lap of bilge water indicatii that such was the case
noiselessly as he could capt paul got out of berth buckled on his sword grasped his pistols and st up the edmpanion way
on the deck near the companion a man was standii looking past him the young planter saw that the slo was indeed in motion heading toward the middle of river noiselessly leaving the warehouse astern
scip and cato expecting trouble from the landwa side of the warehouse were there
if they had not been taken care of by the thieves which hardly seemed likely for that could not have b done without scuffling and an alarmthe sloop was ing stolen right out from under their noses
stepping with catlike softness to the deck capt pi saw that a tow line had been passed to a rowboat sloops cables had been cut and she was being tow away into the darkness
the man who had come aboard from the river side nd had severed the cables turned
had he seen a ghost he could not have shown greater onsternation than when his eyes encountered the young lanter
without allowing him a moments time to shout an iarm capt right fist shot out with the force of a atteringram
the fellow staggered and dropped senseless to the eck
the youth thereupon ran forward fired at the men the rowboat dropped his pistols and cut the tow line rith his sword
apparently both capt shots were effective pr two of the dark figures in the smaller craft sank rom sight under the gunwales
while the daring youth bent over the tow line a rifle facked and his hat was turned half around on his head jy a bullet
back at the landing cato and scip came rushing from ie opposite side of the warehouse and there was a turloil at the quarters proving that the slaves were aroused
dogs began barking and an excited din took the place the recent silence
de sloop yelled cato done gwine off into de ibber done stealin de sloop echoed the frantic cip some un aboad de sloop and the two black loys had their guns leveled at capt paul in a twinkling
steady there boys shouted capt paul the sloop yas in tow of a small boat
run along the bank and see you can pick off some of the rascals in the boat donot et them get ashore
the blacks started away and at about that time the tmng planter heard a splash
hastening to the spot where he had felled the man moment before he found that the fellow had recovered lis wits and vanishedundoubtedly taking to the water
although capt paul looked for him he was not to be seen
by then a large number of the blacks had reached the anding capt paul hove a rope ashore and the sloop was soon yarped back to her moorings springing to the wharf the young planter asked for duncan macbean
none of the negroes had seen him
knowing macbean must have heard the noise and that he would have shown himself if able to do so the youth decided to make a hurried call at the house
bidding part of the blacks to watch the sloop and the rest to hurry after cato and scip and give them aid if any were needed capt paul dashed off in the direction of the mansion
curtains were drawn at the livingroom windows at the edges of the curtains however he saw lines of light
the windows of the great chamber above the living room were dark
letting himself in at the great entrance door paul jones crept along the hall to the door of the living room
it stood a little ajar giving him a glimpse of the interior
the young woman betsy cronin was there
she was dressed as when she had got out of the carriage with the exception of her hat
carrying a lighted candle she stood before the fireplace carefully examining the tiles
for a brief space the youug planter was astounded
duncan macbean was not far wrong when he thought he had overheard some one at the door at the time paul had opened the secret cupboard and placed the ebony box within it
this young woman a selfconfessed tory was there to obtain the papers intrusted to paul jones care
a suspicion flashed through the young planters mind almost at the selfsame moment the suspicion was verified
the girl slightly turned her face
the black patch had disappeared from the right cheek and there just as described by the landlord of the crossroads ordinary was the small red scar in the shape of an this woman then and the woman who had fought for the papers on the williamsburg road were one and the same
paul jones eyes hardened like jade
where was duncan macbean he swept his eves about the room but was unable to see any trace of the overseer
another instant and he had leaped into the apartment
for what are you looking may i ask he inquired dryly
my guest i should think ought to be attending her afflicted parent instead of roaming my premises at this hour
a little cry escaped the woman and she flung back dropping the candle and one hand darting toward her bosom
the candle sputtered out harmlessly on the fireplace hearth
other candles blazed in the room lighting it brightly
betsy eyes blazed fiercely and she drew from her bosom a jeweled dagger
those papers are concealed here she cried shrilly will have them now traitor
you shall not escape me this time paul jones
then she rushed at him like a wild cat
so befouled with contrary winds had been the sloop on her trip from the york to the rappahannock that it was no difficult matter for the young woman to travel at speed cross country and reach paul jones plantation at about the same time he did
at some point the coafch and four had been exchanged for the chariot and the other two horses
determined as this beautiful young vixen certainly was her first thought after the young planter had escaped with his papers would be to make another play in the young planters home
again she had approached the youth on the side of his chivalrous nature but had paul jones seen that scar on her cheek or been able to recognize her in any other way he would not have stumbled into this second trap
the raging girl having come within arms length of him made a sweeping lunge with the dagger
with inconceivable quickness the young captain caught her white slender wrist in a grip of steel
a cry of pain was emitted from the womans beautiful lips and the dagger fell to the polished floor
pushing her from him capt paul picked up the dagger
it ill becomes me to use force against a woman said he tossing the dagger into a far corner back of the couch but when a woman twice attempts my life i have nothing else for it
steps were heard outside and the other woman appeared in the door wringing her hands
betsy betsy it is as i feared wailed the elder woman
you have failed and now have not failed cried the girl as a dripping m3 pushed past her mother into the room
the man was bareheaded and water dripped from swarthy face
he was fair drenched and as he walke his feet ground in his soggy jack boots
ho cried capt paul a light breaking over hii was it you
skipper cockle whom i felled to the da of my sloop
ay dash me growled cockle and it was the seven holy spritsails from whom you escaped in tt coach on the williamsburg road
but this scoundrel did not finish but leaped to the fin place
above the mantel were two crossed swords
cock jerked one of these from its fastenings swung aroui in front of capt paul and stood at guard
his eyes gleamed like those of an enraged panther
capt paul had his pistols but they had been used an he had not taken time to reload them
he was beginning to see throifgh this pretty plot mot and more clearly
it must have been a strange and vital matter that coul bring such tories as the cronins wit such spawn as skipper cockle
front to front at last breathed cockle
split fore an aft if i donot settle our old account by runnio ye through
try it an welcome smiled capt paul whipping ou his blade
stand back mistress said cockle in warning void to betsy cronin
give us room and keep yourself am the dame beyond the circle of our swords
king georg will have one rebel the less to fight before we are done hast got the papers
nay answered the girl seizing her mother am pressing back but i know where they are
gain th mastery of capt jones friend cockle and we shall ven soon have the papers
hast secured the sloop so tha we may sail in her
cockle started an oath but bit the words short the sloop cannot be taken
an we fly it must in the chariot
guard cried capt paul and leaped at the man
with a moan dame cronin sank down in a chair aw buried her face in her hands
her daughter was not si squeamish but stood erect watching the combat wit steady eyes
with the sword capt paul had no superior in the colonies
he was lighter on his feet had a truer hand and a quicker eye than cockle and knew that he could best him
besides he had but to raise his voice and his slaves would come
cockle knowing capt love of fair play felt sure he would not do this
the skippers aim was to slay his antagonist and then slip away from the mansion before the deed was discovered
it was desperate but cockle had taken desperate chances all his life long
the swords circled like strips of fire in the candlelight and the musical clash of a against steel echoed through the room inferiority was apparent from the very first and the girl suddenly throwing a footstool endeavored to trip his adversary and place him at the skippers mercy
another attempt like that said capt paul and i will call my blacks
i am giving this blackguard a fair khow for his skill but you may tempt me to do other wise
the girl drew back pallid and breathless
step by step capt paul forced cockle backward around the room playing with him as a cat might play with a mouse
the skipper panted and swore lunging madly and leaving his breast unguarded a score of times
suddenly he tripped against the couch pushed it backward and its covering of deerskins revealed the form of duncan macbean lying at full length on the floor
the unexpected sight so unnerved capt paul that a quick lunge oh the part of cockle rent his coat and came within an inch of piercing his breast
the girl clapped her hands
another like that friend cockle
another
a fair fiend she was or else her zeal in the interest of the king had robbed her of every womanly feeling
capt paul enraged at the sight of duncan silent form was all for passing his blade through the murderous skippers heart
he pressed the skipper harder and harder and finally had him against the wall
just then swift steps echoed from the hall and a door opened at the young planters back
he did not look around not daring to take his eyes from the vengeful cockle in such a critical moment
capture the women lads he shouted thinking the newcomers must be his blacks leave this rascal to me before he could finish a fierce blow was dealt from behind
capt paul dropped his sword threw up his hands and staggered back
half dazed he saw a man with a bandaged head standing before him and simultaneously he heard his negroes hastening toward the house outside
again the man used his flinty fist and paul jones fell backward across the cot
when capt paul regained his wits his aged housekeeper was in the room directing the negroes who were laboring to resuscitate him
french brandy had been forced between his lips and water dashed in his face
he sat up on the cot stunned and bewildered trying to remember what had taken place
is yo all right marse does yo feel better marse paul paul jones like his brother william before him was a kind and considerate master
he was almost worshiped by his slaves several of whom he had manumitted in recognition of some brave act
presently he started up poured himself another draught of brandy and tossed it off
where are those who were in this room when you came he asked of cato
der wasnot no one heah marse replied cato jess you and marse duncan on de flo dere
run to the barn cato and see if the chariot that brought the visitors to the mansion is still here said the young planter feverishly energetic as a full realization of events returned to him
scip he added ran upstairs and see if those two ladies are in their room the two black boys hurried out of the room and their master sank on his knees beside duncan macbean
to his surprise there was no wound upon the overseers body
he was breathing heavily and was more like a man in a trance than in a natural sleep
his breath carried an odor that caused the youth to start and give vent to a muttered exclamation
lift him to the couch he ordered and arose and went to the table
lifting the goblet that stood near the tankard he smelled of it and detected the same odor that hung so heavily on the overseers breath
drugged he muttered
it was the young woman who had done this it could have been no other
in some way she had succeeded in slipping a sleeping potion into the overseers liquor and he had drained the goblet without suspecting
when drowsiness overtook him the girl had entered the room dragged his form to the couch and concealed it and then had taken the candle and begun her examination of the tiles
as he thought of the tiles and the ebony box capt eyes sought the fireplace
another surprise was in store for him
the tile that covered the secret compartment swung open
with a cry of dismay he leaped to the fireplace and thrust his hand into the aperture
the box was gone
overcome by the discovery the young planter dropped limply into a chair
the trust reposed in him by col washington patrick henry and his good friend mr hewes had been misplaced the papers were gone and the tories through this desperate and determined young woman had dealt a telling blow at their enemies the patriots
the same spirit that cropped out in capt paul when later he stood on his battered and sinking ship and called out we have just begun to fight froze in him then
quickly he had marshaled his wits and was on his feet once more
cassar said he you and juba will take the skiff and cross the river after bob tichenor
bring him at once and have him do what he can for duncan
as the negroes went out cato came in from the barn
de charyut is gone marse he reported an dat strange niggah is gone wif it on the heels of this came scip with the announce ment dem ladies ainot upstairs no mo marse dej clean gone
get my riding horse neb capt paul ordere bring a torch with you and hold the horse till i come he turned to scip and cato again
load my pistols cato he went on handing tl weapons to the black
now scip he ordered wh cato had left you and cato hear those rasca when they came and made fast to the sloop
we didnot heah a sound marse protest scip fust thing we heah was de shootin
what about the men in the boat
we kep em from landin sah
dey pulled off up ribber
when dey was gone we stated to look fo yc see yo nowhere so we come to de house front do was wide open an when we reached dishyet room marse duncan was on de flo an you was er lvir crost de couch
dar wasnot no one else heah
you didnot hear anyone running or hear the charie drive away
no marse cato came back with the loaded revolvers
capt paul took his naked sword from the table wbei one of the negroes had laid it and slipped it into th scabbard
then he took his pistols from cato and thrust theo into his sword belt
picking up his spurs from the mantel he buckled the to his heels
scip he went on when ready to start you an cato will take half a dozen of the other boys with ya and go to the sloop
stay right with her and watch hi until further orders
is yo goin alone aftah dat charyut marse inquired scip
certainly ye take me long marse rig fo you to go alone sah
do as i tell you answered capt paul and hurri from the house
down by the horseblock stood neb with the horse an the torch
taking the torch out of the blacks hand the youn planter held it low and swept it back and forth across ti road
neb was wise in all the arts of tracking runaway aves he could follow a trail like a bloodhound and rery twig leaf and blade of grass along the course told own story of the feet that had passed over it
look neb
capt paul said indicating the road do you see there prints ob horses an a kerridge goin east marse apn answered neb sagaciously an prints ob de ime horses an kerridge goin west
the prints pointing west were made after those gog the other way
yass sah dats whut i makes out
that is what i make out too
capt paul leaped to the saddle his spurs rattled and was off at speed pointing due west
old truepenny tyburn it now seemed very certain as assisting skipper cockle
old truepenny and his bandits were to steal the sloop id have her ready for dame cronin and her daughter id the skipper and man when they had icured the papers and were ready for flight
capt prompt and resolute work had prevented te carrying out of that part of the plan
the women and their helpers had perforce to fall back the chariot which capt paul was pursuing at top peed
capt paul would have given much to know how cockle and old truepenny had been able to unite their forces opportunely
but the business that concerned capt paul at that ime was the overhauling of the chariot and the recovery if the ebony box
for wellnigh an hour he rode goading his horse to he utmost
at the end of that time he heard the rattle if a vehicle ahead
he knew he was drawing close to his quarry and vas soon able to see chariot horses and driver
the driver was plying the lash and forcing the horses o their best pace
presently capt paul was abreast of be negro covering him with a pistol
stop he ordered stop at once or shoot you off he seat doan shoot marse doan shoot implored the negro
in pursuing the chariot alone the young captain was icting with his usual impetuosity
as he believed the two women were in the vehicle and also cockle and the man
counting the black driver he was one against threeone against four if betsy cronin were counted
as the chariot halted capt paul backed his horse about and faced the door pistols in hand
not a sound came from the interior of the vehicle in the coach the young planter demanded
no one marse answered the driver
what exclaimed capt paul
where are your mistress and her daughter dunno marse answered the negro vacantly
suspecting another trap the young planter dismounted and cautiously opened the chariot door holding one of his pistols in readiness for instant use
still no hostile move against him was made
getting into the vehicle he found that the driver had told the truth and that it was indeed empty
where are your passengers he demanded springing out dunno marse repeated the negro
you do know you black rascal cried capt paul leveling one of his weapons
is your life worth anything
if it is you will answer me at once and tell the truth
you can kill me marse said the negro but i kainot tell yo somethin i doan know
after a moments thought capt paul thrust the pistol back into his belt
turn the chariot around said he curtly and drive back to the plantation
the negro obeyed but not with a very good grace and together they returned to the place from whence they had started
it was a silent and far from pleasant journey for either of them
dawn was breaking as they drew up in the road in front of the mansion
caesar juba neb and several more of the watchful negroes witnessed their approach and hurried up from the quarters
capt paul told the blacks to put the horses back in the bam and to make a prisoner of the negro driver
then he went to the house
bob tichenor who had some skill in the practice of medicine was there doing what he could for duncan macbean
duncan was still unconscious
some strange narcotic has been used remarked i8 tichenor and i am not able to say how long this state of coma will last
macbean may recover in a few minutes and it may be several hours
i have done all i can for him and the only thing to do now is to wait until the drug has spent itself
tichenor put on his hat and took his box of phials and physic under his arm
you had trouble here last night i am told he went on but managed to beat off the invaders
yes bob capt paul answered old truepenny and his crew tried to steal my sloop and we all had a braw time of it
how did this happen to duncan jack
surely truepenny isnot waging his campaign with sleep powders what happened to duncan is a mystery to me
i hope he will recover soon so that i may know
the young planter was quiet on the subject of the stolen papers
tichenor was a good whig and a good friend but the fate of the papers capt paul was determined to keep to himself
tichenor went away and capt paul ate his breakfast
it was a gloomy breakfast since brave old duncan who usually ate with him was stretched on his back unconscious of all that took place
following the meal capt paul walked out into the sunshine
scip he called fetch me the strange negro
have juba come with you and bring the cat black was brought struggling to the scene and fald in front of the young planter
capt brow was black as a thundercloud am positive you know where your mistress went said he and that it was a part of your plan to make me lose time following the empty chariot while those i wanted were making their escape in another way
you must tell me what became of your mistress
if you do not tell me of your own free will i shall flog you until you do dunno huffin bout it marse insisted the negro
strip his back ordered capt paul and take him to the whippingpost
the young planter was not in love with the whippingpost and it was rarely brought into use on his plantation
he could be stern enough when occasion derma and so could duncan but they so ruled the blacks extreme measures were rarely called for
from the other planters slaves were continually ning away but never from capt paul
in the present instance capt paul felt that he entirely justified
so much hung on the recovery of the ebony box he would be lax in the duty he owed his country did not exhaust every means for apprehending those had stolen it
the negro juba was an immense fellow and muss like an ox
when the cronin slave was bound to the post cast aside his dowlas shirt grasped the handle of the and stepped to the side of theblack who was to ree punishment
your name said capt paul placing himself in fr of the cronin negro where he could watch his fact hugon marse
you are french
oui from guiana marse
will you tell what became of your mistress dunno marse face had turned a sickly gray under its bla skin
capt paul raised his hand
the cat swished through the air and fell on the nak back
an earsplitting yell came from hugon donot want to punish you more than necessary s capt paul
you have a chance to tell me where yq mistress went hugon and there jyill be no mo flogging face was writhing with pain but still he ga his stereotyped answer dunno marse
again capt paul raised hi hand and again juba la on with the stinging thongs
five times in quick so cession the cat descended and then unable to stand t punishment longer hugon cried that he would yield
juba drew aside holding the cat readyto use on more if it should be needed
did your mistress and her daughter get into chariot at all asked the young planter
yass marse dey come from de house an got into charyut
how far did they ride
jess a lil ways marse not mo dan er mile became of them then dey all got out who do you mean by all
cockle an dat sailor man wif de bandaged tid

what happened after the fight was told to drive back to marse country ace where we got de charyut an anodder team an ime on heah was cockle hurt during that fight we had in the bach
capt paul recalled that mistress betsy had used the evolver that time and that cockle had cried out as vith the pain of a wound
jess a lil hurt marse said hugon in de side ut it doan amount to nuffin
capt paul had learned all that he cared to know
the cronins cockle and the man had gone upriver and he had no time to lose if he cherished any hopes of overhauling them
he gave orders that hugon was to be untied from the post conveyed to the quarters and tenderly cared for hut he was to be kept a prisoner
neb was sent again for his masters riding horse and the youth went again into the house for a final look at poor duncan before leaving the plantation
the overseer was lying just as he had been not a flicker of returning consciousness showing in his immobile face
with a sigh the young captain turned away left the house swung into the saddle and spurred along the bridle path that followed the river
never was the young planters iron endurance better exemplified than in this series of exciting adventures
he had had no rest during the preceding night saving the brief interval he had passed in his berth on the sloop and for hours he had been actively engaged
notwithstanding this his hardy nature leaped unweariedly to meet what fate might have in store for him
his nerves were steady his faculties keen and he was in fine trim to do his best whenever he should be called upon
as he rode upstream he came presently to a stretch of sandy shore with a huge black bowlder in the middle of it
the black rock he muttered thinking of what had taken place at his plantation on the forenoon of the preceding day
the empty rattlesnake skin lay over the face of the bowlder and to it was attached a bit of paper bearing these words old truepenny presents his compliments to capt paul jones and wishes to state that he accepts the powder and ball as a loan and will return them to capt jones at the muzzle of a flintlock
tidewater virginia is not large enough for both capt jones and old truepenny tyburn
a grim smile curled capt lip
old truepenny is a rare rogue thought he as he started on faith i should like to meet him
while the young planter was threading the thick woods a mile further his quick ears caught a thud of galloping hoofs
backing his mount into the undergrowth the youth waited one hand on the butt of a pistol
the next moment an exclamation of surprise escaped him for the approaching rider was none other than alec gilpin
the lad was lying along his horses neck plying the gad and riding like mad
alec called capt paul
hello returned alec straightening up and stopping his horse there
the young planter rode out and joy found vent in a loud huzza
great jemimy jest the feller i was lookin fer capt paul
why are you looking for me my lad there was fightin at your plantation last night wasnot there
ay rather a brisk setto with the gang of robbers who are trying to rule the roost in this section
they made an attempt to steal the sloop but it was frustrated
do ye know where the gang has their headquarters capt paul eyes were bright and his face showed considerable excitement
no answered the young planter eying the lad sharply
have you any information on that point alec
sure i have capt paul
brother han an i went fishin yesterday afternoon late and while we was settin on the river bank we seen some roughlookin fellers rowin a boat an towin the queerestlookin craft that ever come inter these waters
it looked like a flatboat but there was a cabin on it an a smokepipe cornin out o the roof of the cabin
han an i hid an saw the men tow the boat inter a creek where it couldnot be seen from the river
the men got out o the boat an i saw then that one o them was that skipper cockle who made ye sp much trouble below norfolk
now that we got the roost anchored says one jest come aboard cockle an well lay our plans fer ternight some prime grog aboard the roost an i reckon ye ainot averse ter wettin yer whistle eh old sea dog
then the lot o them went inter the cabin on the flatboat an han an i lit out fer home why didnot you bring word to me about this before alec asked capt paul was kinder mixed up like in my mind an didnot know what ter do
when a trader showed up from downriver this mornin an brought word o the trouble at your plantation i thinks o the flatboat at once lay a straight course fer capt paul says i ter myself an tell him about the roost is the flatboat still in the creek there
i jest come from that way an i stopped long enough ter creep up on the roost an look through a cabin winder
was there anyone in the cabin
three men capt paul an roughlookin chaps they are too
they had weapons hanging from nails in the wallwas carryin on as though they had been drink they as sin an would jest as soon shoot a as ter look at him
capt paul now understood why it was impossible the planters to follow the trail of the robbers with dogs when they fled after committing their depredatio it was by water and they left no trail
by moving the roost about from place to place th were able to fend off discovery and continue their nefa ous work
how far is that creek where the roost is hove from here alec
not moren two mile capt paul
then point your horse the other way lad ing there
alec gasped
are we goin alone sir
why not
you said there were only three of rascals in this robbers roost a good time to raid place
it wouldnot take me long ter ride ter the ferry a git dad need dad
turn your horse and lead way jest like capt paul exulted alec whirlit his horse about tackle anythin that comes yoi way big or little
i druther sail with you than with ai other man in shoe leather
the two miles were covered swiftly
when within a bowshot of the creek the two mounted and tied their horses
have you a weapon of any kind alec asked cap paul
no captain replied the lad an thats whats woi ryin me
i canot do ye much good without somethin ta shoot with
possibly you can be of aidafter a little side by side they crept up to the brushy margin ci the little stream not far from the point where it enterd the rappahannock
on hands and knees capt paul parted the tangki thicket in front of him and peered out at the queerlookiq craft that rubbed its side against the bank
alec had described it well
it was nothing more or less than a flatboat with rude cabin occupying the larger part of its deck
from within the cabin came roaring voices singing a lutical catch known as tom bowling
remain here alec whispered paul and do not ir until i call you an opportunity to nab three this lawless brood and i cannot let it slip
have a care of yerself capt paul admonished the d as the young planter rose from the thicket cautiously ished his way through to the edge of the bank and larded the flatboat
capt daring maneuver was executed with a
are that kept any suspicion of it from the boisterous trio the cabin
drawing his pistols from his belt and grasping one in jach hand he suddenly kicked open the door and entered die robbers rendezvous
there were three men there just as alec had said
and they were gallows birds every mothers son of hemas ripe for murder as for eating a meal or drinkjjag a glass of grog
just then however they were taken at a disadvantage
not only were they somewhat under the influence of liquor but their surprise was so intense as to be ludicrous
for a full minute they stared at capt paul with jaws igape and bewilderment in their eyes
then voicing wild oaths they sprang up and reached ip as though they would snatch their weapons down from the wall
pray do not trouble yourselves gentlemen said
ones you may be three against one but the first to urn a weapon on me goes out of this world suddenly
the young captain brought his pistols to a level covring the rascals before him
there was a glint in his eyes that spoke volumes for iis resolute purpose and the trio of worthies exchanged ipprehensive looks and sank back into their seats
who might you be queried one hoarsely
capt paul jones was the airy reply
you paid our respects to me last night and i am now but retiming the compliment
flat on the floor the three of hey
the unusual order startled the rogues
capt paul repeated the command accompanying it with a significant flourish of his pistols
the three men dropped instanter lying at full length on the cabin floor
turn on your faces hands behind you went on capt paul
the order was obeyed
alec shouted the young planter this way alec
the lad was heard rending the brush in his haste to reach the boat another moment and he sprang to the deck and ran in at the open door
great he cried surveying the prostrate robbers
have ye killed em all capt paul
i didnot hear any shootin alive right enough alec answered capt paul but they must be bound
find ropes somewhere there must be a supply of material in this vipers nest
alec found some suitable cords in a locker and with a dirk taken from one of the prisoners he cut the cords into lengths and made the hands of the robbers fast at their backs then he performed the same duty at their ankles
when this was finished the young planter thrust his pistgls back into his belt turned the rogues on their backs and proceeded to twist more of the cord between the jaws of two of themthus making effective gags
the third manwhose appearance suggested that he was the most intelligent of the paul reserved for crossexamination holding another piece of cord ready for his gagging when the crossexamining was done
there are arms on the wall alec said he take what you please and then do an anchor watch on the deck outside
i took these scoundrels by surprise and we must not let their comrades treat us in similar fashion
alec delighted with the chance to use the robbers weapons pushed four pistols into his breeches band slipped two dirks into the breast of his linsey shirt and laid hold of a flintlock rifle
thus armed to the teeth he went forth from the cabin and performed sentinel duty on the after deck
the fortunes of war gentlemen said capt paul seating himself on one of the vacated stools
there is a neat gibbet in williamsburg and youd decorate it finely old truepenny know nothin about sech a man asserted the rogue who could talk
have you so soon forgotten your leader
refresh your memory a little
how about cockle a fit mate for old truepenny and i suppose theyre cruising together eh
the young captains knowledge seemed to astonish all three of the prisoners
the two who were gagged mumbled behind their cords while their comrade used his free tongue and swore heartily the very devil paul jones
thank you for your high opinion
how did ye find out old truepenny was away with cockle an the man
when i play at picquet i never give away my hand to those who play against me a rum uni did old truepenny cockle and the man bring the ladies to this roost of yours mayhap
if ye know so much ye ort ter know that too tell ye how ye can find out what ye want ter know
how
stay here long enough my blood an old truepenny cockle an the manll come back
when they do ye can ask em what ye want ter know
the fellow grinned sardonically
thank you for the suggestion answered the daring capt paul a good one and as playing the cards to win i believe i shall carry it out
old truepenny an make a lead mine of ye if ye do a little bit out of your reckoning when you say that
capt paul got up and stepped to the door
alec said he go back along the bridle path and tie the horses further off in the timber
when you return come into the cabin
ay ay sir answered the lad and at once leaped ashore
the captured rogue had no idea that capt paul was about to carry out his suggestionwhich proved how little he knew the youth
impetuous in the extreme the young planter had led and was in future to lead many a forlorn hope wresting success from the very teeth of adversity
a bold even a reckless policy ever appealed to him
as a first step in his plans he silenced the third man with a gag as he had silenced the other two then unceremoniously rolled them under some bunks buil against one of the walls
in looking for ropes to bind the prisoners alec had delved into a locker containing rough clothing
capt paul had made mental note of this at the time his wit suggesting the use to which the homely gear waj now to be put
over his coat he drew a muchfrayed shirt of buck skin then covered his lower limbs with linsey breechei and leggins about his middle he strapped his trust sword giving his pistols their wonted place under his belt
his own hat he tucked away under the leather shirt replacing it with an old beaver
from a muchbegrimed lanthorn pendent from the ceil ing he secured a little candleblack with which hi smeared his face and hands
it was a very much transformed paul jones resulting from these devices
his best friend would not havi known him
having completed the change from capt paul t freebooter he awaited the return of alec resolved t test upon him the completeness of the change
in a few minutes a crashing of the bushes on tht creek bank informed the young planter that some ora was approaching
stepping to a window commanding that side of the little stream he waited expectantly
a form appeared directly but it was not the form ol alec gilpin
a bandaged head showed above the thicket and was followed by the broad tall figure of the man
did he come alone or were cockle and old truepenny in his wake
capt paul had no time to ascertain this
even if the skipper and the leader of the band were with the man they were but three to one and he had already got the better of such odds
seating himself on a stool he waited
the man came from the direction which alec had gone to attend to the horses
capt paul hoped in his heart that no harm had be23 fallen the lad and felt sure there had not for alec was teenwitted and able to take care of himself
the sailor scrambled to the deck of the roost and altered the cabin
at the sight of capt paul he seemed nonplused
ahoy the sailor grunted stopping short and staring it the disguised planter
are ye one o the crew o this raft am returned capt paul disremember seein ye among the lot growled the other
the cut o yer jib is summat furrin yourn fer that matter
dost know old truebenny my buck
ay for a matter o twentyfour hours or such like was away among the plantations lookin fer fresh lickins so yeve joined while i was absent from the tendezvous
sit down mate an yere one o us
beflike added capt paul as by sudden thought kvith cockle an dame an mistress cronin workin for lold king george
ye have it right replied the sailor
an what name do ye sail under
black bart is what ihe lads call me
rotherick is my name ben rotherick barrin p crack i got on the skull as able a seaman as ever
help yerself to a noggin o rum said capt paul generously waving his hand toward the liquor on the table
by then the young planter felt easier in his mind
it was a safe guess that rotherick had come to the flatboat alone
the man drained a full mug dried his lips on his sleeve and settled back with a satisfied grin
nothin like drink to rest a mans nerves an body he commented
since i left cockle an truepenny an the women been afoot
we ran afoul o hard luck last night an cleared the breakers by the skin of our teeth
ye got the sloop
rotherick swore disgustedly
this capt paul blocked the game wussn the flyin dutchman fer bein on a dozen seas at the same time hopin fate will lay me alongside o him long enough to give me a chance to board be one traitor the less after that hot the only one whod like to come to close quarters with capt paul
ay mate ye speak fair
but harkye
it was capt paul cracked my skull south o norfolk an all but scuttled cockle an sent him to the bottom had a chance at the planter last night
if his slaves hadnot come in the nick o time have settled old scores
but mistress cronin got what she was after i hear
do ye know what it was mate
not cockle doe mayhap
all i know we rode in the kerridge several knots due west from the jones plantation got out an took to a boat
the women was landed across the river at plantation an directly after cockle spoke this old truepenny o yours and we cruised in company till daylight then i was landed on this side the river and told to regain the roost and gather up a supply of powder and ball old truepenny was runnin short
he an cockle and me is after paul we donot leave these waters until we sink him
burn me if i donot think weve got the planter on the run
rotherick got up and stretched his huge limbs
this land cruisin ainot to my likin mate he went on but the quicker i get the ammunition an git back to the skipper an old truepenny the sooner well be able to up anchor an bear away
he took the lanthorn from its swinging hook set it on the table and reached for a tinder box on a nearby shelf
while he worked at striking a light he kept up his running fire of small talk
old truepenny lost some men last night
that makes him as hungry for this traitor captains life as cockle an me
having lighted the lanthorn rotherick set it down on the floor beside a trap with an iron ring
then he glanced around
there ought to be a hatchet somers he muttered and started to look under the row of bunks where the prisoners had been stowed think its under the bunks on this side mate said capt paul quite calmly
discovery had hung by a hair
as it fell out it was merely postbound and was to happen later
by good luck the hatchet was in the place capt paul had indicated
possessing himself of it
rotherick knelt beside the trap and pulled it open with the ring
reaching down into the shallow hold he drew up a powder horn
empty he muttered shaking the horn close to his ear have ter smash in a cask o powder
the holds full o the stuff
if the crew o this craft ever git too free with their pipes the lot of sail skyward
capt paul awaiting his opportunity was watching rotherick like a weasel
as it happened rotherick knelt facing him bending over and using the hatchet on a cask below
had the mans back been to the young planter a welldirected blow would have stunned the fellow and made his capture comparatively an easy matter
but that considering the circumstances was out of the question
the head of the cask was quickly smashed revealing the black contents
as rotherick reached for the powder horn one of the prisoners rolled from beneath the bunk and struggled to his knees before capt paul had a chance to get at him
the fellow had chewed at the cords until they had parted and he was free to use his tongue
look out rotherick he roared
capt jones yere talkin to
rotherick leaped erect glaring
so ho he shouted the traitor himself the he was reaching for his dirk when the young planter grappled with him
there was a terrific struggle back and forth across the cabin each man seeking to draw a weapon and bring the battle to an end the other preventing him
at last with an effort that called forth all his great strength capt paul tore away and struck rotherick from him
the sailor staggered backward struck the lanthom with his foot and toppled it through the trap
from that moment it was a drawn battle
neither combatant thought of anything but getting clear of the roost in the shortest possible time
as he bounded past the man kneeling on the floor the young planter lingered an instant to sever the cords that bound his feet then raced on
he gained the after deck caught a glimpse of rotherick and the robber behind him and bluish flash puffed upward from the hold and a thunderous explosion followed
the young planter dazed and bewildered found himself a few minutes after the explosion standing on the creek bank leaning against a tree
his left arm numb and bleeding hung limply at his side
a dozen yards away the wreck of the roost was burning fiercely floating fragments of the illstarred craft littering the water for a hundred feet up and down the small stream
rotherick was nowhere in sight nor was the robber
capt paul was presently aware that some one was talking to him and that the muzzle of a gun was staring him in the face ye try ter fight cause i got the dead wood on ye
now tell me whats become o capt paul jones
was he in that alec was behind the rifle and in his face was a strange mingling of grief and determination
the young planter in his borrowed garb was not recognized by the boy albeit the planters hat was gone and but for the excitement of the moment wits would have proved equal to the emergency
capt paul alec answered jones weakly
the man rotherick came aboard the flatboat and we had a struggle
a lighted lanthom was knocked into the hold on a lot of powder and the magazine blew up
capt paul cried alec
yer own mother wouldnot have known ye in that getup hurt
look at yer all bloody
yes said the young planter had a close call of it and not myself yet by a long chalk
get the horses alec dizzy and can hardly stand
as he spoke capt paul sank down at the base of the tree everything in his range of vision whirling about him
for some time after that he had only a confused notion of what happened
he was not unconscious as he had been in his own house the evening before but he was on the verge of it
the rough treatment rotherick had given him at the plantation might have had something to do with his hazy condition in the main however the explosion was to be jeld responsible
how he had gained the shore when the deck of the flatboat heaved upward beneath him capt paul had not
he slightest idea
he remembered vaguely that alec came with the brses and lifted him to his saddle then that they ihreaded the woods
next dame gilpin and her husband were helping him
rom the horse and after that he was in a chair dame gilpin attending to his arm and master gilpin holding a jewter mug of madeira to his lips
presently he walked to a couch assisted by the ferryman and sank into a heavy slumber
he slept out the remainder of that day and the whole ff the succeeding night apparently in as deep a trance as was duncan macbean but it was a natural sleep the deep of a man who had endured much and was far spent with weariness
his dreams had to do with the ebony box intrusted to him by the virginia patriots
when he awoke the morning sun was looking in at the open door and terence omalley and master gilpin were standing at the head of the couch
ah ha cried omalley the lads himself again
faith its a wonder hes alive at all at all
yez may well say that same masther omalley me an echoing brogue from the kitchen
it was dame gilpin who like the dashing terence was a gift of the ould sod to the new world
many a man would have been dead long since av he had gone through all that
capt paul has done
sure its a lad av iron he is
how do ye feel captain asked gilpin as the young planter sat up on the couch
hearty thank you smiled the young planter must have slept well i take it
the whole night long sir said gilpin
capt paul whistled incredulously
where did you come from omalley he inquired afield with some of the other planters tryin to jet a crack at old truepenny tyburn north of the river and i rode over here for a word with master gilpin
you thought you couldnot trust me to scatter this iband of robbers
not so me lad cried omalley trust ye scatter anything from a corporals guard o red coats to a company o the own done your work paul the mangy breed is scattered by that nights work at your plantation an the blowin up of the roost
the leader is tryin to get clear an were hot after him
you heard about the explosion then
everyone has heard of it up an down the river
as near as we can make out three o the band lost their lives in the fight at your plantation an two more were found near the charred wreck o the flatboat
that makes foive an old truepenny was not strong enough in numbers to stand the loss of so many
the plantations paul owin to your gallant work are well rid o the band those that are left are makin for distant parts to leave ye now happy in the thought that yere yourself again
hold hard a minute terence cried paul
when did you halt at my place last
in the early hours of the mornin
had anyone called there inquiring for me
not a soul me boy
capt paul was thinking of the man who was to call with the letter from mr adams and the key to the ebony box
the messenger had not yet arrived and there was still time for him to make another attempt at recovering the papers
how was duncan macbean
terence omalley shook his head a strange case for ye
bob tichenor was there and he said condition was the quarest thing hed ever encountered
he lies quiet enough breathin natural and seeminly asleep
sure it must have been a powerful drug
but tichenor thinks hell come around all right an ye give him time
omalley thereupon took his departure and capt paul got up and stripped himself of the borrowed gear which he had donned on the flatboat
although his arm pained him the numbness was gone and on the whole it felt better
a brief examination showed him that he was not to be crippled nor to be long without the use of the hand
furthermore he discovered that he had lost neither his sword nor his pistols
if he had not carried them ashore after the explosion alec must have found them and taken them in charge
anyhow the weapons lay by the captains bunk in as good trim as ever they were
a refreshing dip in cold spring water served still further in giving back to the young planter all his customary strength and vigor and when he had joined the gilpins in a hearty breakfast he was primed for the road and eager to be about his work
he had in mind a call at the house of samuel sparrow
master plantation lay on both sides of the river and it was rather two plantations than one each had its house and quarters but the master himself lived on the south shore
if rotherick was to be believed the cronins had crossed over to the north side thereby putting a broad sweep of water between them and capt paul
whether they were beyond the rappahannock still or had left for other parts since the night they had fled from capt plantation was the point the youth wished to settle by a call at master since mansion lay on his road to his own plantation capt paul would not be at much inconvenience in calling there
when the morning meal was done the young planter lost no time in taking to the road
he followed the highroad and not the bridle path
had he desired he could have traveled the latter course and thus have gained a final look at the relic of the robber roost which he had so successfully invaded
however he had no wish to return to the spot which had witnessed the explosion that had cost two of the robbers their lives and came so near to costing him his own
there was a languid warmth even in that early hour and as he galloped through the heart of the thick woods redbirds catbirds and robins sang around him
from some cause his hope mounted high
a feeling sprang in his breast that all was not lost and that the messenger who was to call for the ebony box would ultimately receive it at his hands
it would be difficult to account for this reassuring thought
so far as the ebony box was concerned the wiles of mistress betsy seemed to have been entirely successful
nevertheless capt paul spurred on with a more complacent spirit than he had had at any time since he had discovered the loss of the papers
by and by he drew rein at master door finding master sparrow himself enjoying a pipe on his veranda
the gentlemans greeting was sour and uncordial and it was plain his sad treatment at capt plantation still rankled in his bosom
the visitor was not invited to dismount so he kept his saddle
may i inquire master sparrow said capt paul if you have visitors here
gad yes paul jones was the grumpy answer you may inquire but tis all the good it will do you
ladies from williamsburg went on capt paul imperturbably
dame cronin and her daughter betsy tories i take it as warm for king george as you are ourself
an they be here what then demanded master sparrow would have talk with mistress betsy that is all
no man enters my house returned the planter except by my invitation
mayhap youd see fit to give the invitation sir an i came here with terence omalley and some of the lads he has at his back
zounds sir exclaimed master sparrow
dost dare to threaten me
nay there is no need to wax hot over what i say went on capt paul calmly
if the ladies are not here they are not sir nor are they at my other place across the rappahannock
if ye seek that knowledge there ye have it had it on fair authority that they were across the river mistress betsy told me herself that they were bound there
gad paul jones thou hast the manners of a stableboy
ye treated them so uncivilly they were obliged to fly your house i the night and sought refuge with the
rappahanock between you and them
yesterday in my own coach i sent them to williamsburg for you sir an ye think o calling on me with master omalley and his bravos
slife
when his majesty god bless him tames these rebellious colonies there are a few i shall hope to see swung higher than haman
i will not mention names
no need said capt paul coolly
he would have baited the old tory further had he not it that moment glimpsed no less a horseman that cato lying along the highroad bound northward
cato he shouted whirling his horse and riding for he road
cato
whither bound
cato pulled up and awaited his master lookin fo you marse said he
we eard dat yo was at marse at de ferry so i was oin dere the news lad is duncan worse marse duncan is about de same sah
it wasnot about lim i was goin to see yo
what then
speak out an be quick barkentine is hove to in de roads off de plantation barkentine fortune bound acrost de watah nicholas biddle
biddle he low he want see marse paul immejitly
he say he done got a lettah o you an dat you brought somethin from williamsburg lot he wants ter git
then in spite of his newborn hopes capt leart sank like lead
here was the messenger in a hurry to secure the ebony ox and its inclosed papers
what was he to say when he met capt biddle
an ordeal was before him from which even his brave pul shrank
but there was nothing else for it but to lace the issue
as he approached the plantation along the highroad capt paul saw the barkentine riding the waters in the oads
a gig was at the landing with two sailors lounging it the snubposts and a fine figure of a mariner smoking pipe and pacing the wharf
tossing his reins to cato capt paul started for the finding
he had a disagreeable communication to give capt fiddle and wanted it over with
as he passed the house scip came running out marse paul
marse paul wanted in heah ih a in a few minutes scip replied the young planter a gentleman at the landing who wants to see m and duncan say he wants to see yo right now jpsisted scip
marse duncan came in startled tones from capt paul
has he recovered his senses dat he has sah
he come to a while ago an de fus thing he ask fo you
i done tole him biddle was heah to see marse paul and dat cato done gone fo you so marse duncan say de minit yo come to send yo in where he is
down at the landing capt biddle was shouting and waving his hands
it was plain he wanted capt paul but capt paul instead of going to him entered the house and waited on duncan macbean
the brave old overseer sat in a chair by the fireplace
he was the same duncan he had been and seemed none the worse for his long sleep under the spell of the narcotic
paul lad he exclaimed rising and grasping the young planters hand
come i maun speak wi ye but the messenger has come for that box duncan and i have got to tell him that tory woman took it no be tellin him a lie boy will ye
you do not understand duncan went on capt paul for all this happened while you were under influence of that powerful drug
mistress betsy cronin was really at the door watching and listening when i opened the secret tile and placed the ebony box in the compartment losh said duncan well i knew it
old truepenny and his band tried to steal the sloop but i was aboard her and gave them a pretty go for their trouble
the sloop was saved and as soon as she had been warped back to her moorings i started for the house
there had been considerable popping of firelocks and i felt sure if all was right with you you would have shown yourself
when i came here mistress betsy candle in hand was running her fingers over the tiles looking for the one that concealed the box
duncan macbean chuckled in his beard
go on lad said he
why do you hang fire
what are you laughing about demanded capt paul a grave matter duncan and not to be treated lightly
so so boy
proceed wi your harrowin tale
capt paul could not understand manner but continued entered the room and taxed mistress betsy with her perfidy
then i saw that the black patch she wore on her right cheek was gone revealing a little scar
duncan she was the very same woman who sought to waylay me on the williamsburg road
fine i ken that exclaimed duncan had it in my noddle all along
but proceed lad proceed a rare tale yere tellin
while i was engaged with mistress betsy who should enter the room but skipper cockle cockle gasped macbean no tellin me cockle was here
the very same man duncan
he came took a sword from above the mantel and we had to cut and thrust all around the room
he stumbled over the couch the deerskins fell aside and i saw you there stretched at full length on the floor
not knowing what foul play had befallen you the sight of your form maddened me
i should have run cockle through had not another struck me from behind
the man duncan braw plot that cried duncan breathlessly interested
how came the cronins mixed with such a breed o vermin all for the king and against the colonies
that is the principle that drew them together
in some way
mistress betsy got wind of that box in williams burg and was waiting for me on the road with men to help her
but to go on couple of blows dealt from the rear laid me across the cot wellnigh as lifeless as yourself duncan
when i drifted back to the world the cronins were gone
cockle was gone the man was gone
more than that the secret tile was open and the ebony box was gone have tried to recover it and in doing so have met with some strange happenings
but of these more anon
just now i cannot delay longer but must wait on capt biddle
he probably wonders hy i linger here when he is so anxious to have talk with me
hoith lad not so fast listened to your tale an tis right that ye listen to mine
but capt biddle he has waited so long let him wait a wee bit longer
till the end o my days paul i shall smell my bombo before i drink of it
had i done so that night there would have been no trance for old duncan
the girl came while i sat here smoking an thinkin she talked o this an that but never a word about the box or the papers
i saw her eyes gang now an thet to the fireplace and i had suspicions
weel she sat by the table and she did some playin wi her slim fingers about the mugs
i thought naething o it fool that i was
then she poured some bombo and we drank together then by an by i was off to the land o nod realizin what had happened but no more able to prevent what was cornin than a bairn
yes somehow i was fu content as i dropped asleep
can ye guess why
this is no time for guessing answered capt paul sharply
duncan all this can wait until after i see biddle
it can no wait answered the highlander stoutly an ye wonot guess why i was content tell ye
because and here he leaned toward capt paul hi old eyes winking cannily because my lad i had opened that secret place early i th evenin an removed the ebony box
paul was on his feet with a gasp
the overseers words had fair stunned him
you had removed the box he repeated blankly
ay lad
i feared the young woman an i was sure she had listened in the hall while ye put the box away an told me o it
so opened the secret place an took it away
twas on my own responsibility where is the box now whispered capt paul huskily where is it
duncan macbean lifted the top of capt tobacco jar
had ye done some smokin lad said he dryly on had i awoke befure much worryin ye maun hae been saved
from the tobacco jar a grim smile on his lips dun can took the ebony box and handed it to capt paul
the young planter stared for a moment then he caught the overseers hand fervently trow well duncan macbean said he with emoi tion ye hae saved my honor this day
your honor lad is as dear to duncan macbean as hi4 m but your honor was not concerned
ye had done i that mortal man could to haud the box an deliver heavy steps resounded in the hall and a wellbuilt man sea togs entered the room
nicholas biddle gentlemen said he
which o ye capt paul jones sir answered the young planter stepping forird have a letter for you
the wind serves and i must zzy in my ship at the earliest possible moment
capt biddle took a letter from the pocket of his coat
will you please to read this capt jones he asked
the letter as expected was from the hand of mr iams and requested delivery of certain papers brought williamsburg
the letter is all right as far as it goes capt biddle id the young planter
have you anything else about that proves your authority in this matter key capt jones and the skipper produced a ninutive key swinging about his neck by a bit of cord was told to be careful of the letter and the key and ey have been by me night and day from the moment i ceived them
this box i was instructed to deliver to you on receipt the letter from mr adams but you were also to open box will do so an the key fits the lock
the key fitted and the box was opened revealing a cket of papers
art satisfied capt jones inquired biddle
perfectly
the ebony box was closed locked and capt biddle msferred it to an inner pocket of his coat
that is ail i believe said biddle
one thing more captain said capt paul
caesar
the black dodged into the room from the hall
marse tankard of that right madeira
tankard and goblets were brought and the madeira poured
true to his resolve canny duncan macbean sniffed of his glass while holding it in his hand toast capt biddle said capt paul
will you honor us with one
right cheerfully
standin an you pl ease
they rose to their feet
to the colonies murmured capt biddle
mav these dispatches whose purport i know not aid our people in the coming war with great britain
eyes to eyes they drank the toast and set their goblets down
no more said capt biddle briskly have tarried too long already
farewell to you gentlemen
i trust capt jones when we meet again twill be in ships on the high seas with the british before us
amen to that captain said john paul jones maun fight ashore put in duncan
the sea was never to my likin they accompanied capt biddle to the landing and cheered him as he put off to the barkentine in his gig
then they waited on the wharf until the barkentine spread her sails and vanished along the rappahannock
hast any idea paul what those papers are about
no more than biddle yet i imagine they are secret instructions for some trusted agent in europe had thought the like
duncan said capt paul once more grasping the overseers hand shall never forget what you have saved me this day
the fact that i hae been usefu to ye is mair than enough boy said duncan and no more ever passed between them concerning the ebony box
that afternoon terence omalley and his riders came back and with them came a bushybearded gentleman in buckskin his hands tied behind and his feet roped under his saddle girth
no less a personage he proved than old truepenny tyburn
he was much chagrined over his capture and loudly declared that skipper cockle and the cronins had been a the cause of his downfall
finding him bitter against the skipper and in talkative mood capt paul proceded to quiz him
hoiv long have you known skipper cockle
three days belike and they were three days too many for my own good
did he engage you to help steal certain papers know nothing of any papers
he paid me fifty guineas down to help steal yon sloop
i got the guineas but master cockle did not get his sloop
yet even the guineas are gone an fiere am where are your followers
at the bottom of the rappahannock two blown up with the roost and a few more at large in the forest
we did bravely here capt paul until you came
you made war upon me said the young planter and have only yourself to blame for what befell
mayhap yet it boots not to think of what might have been
dost know what has become of cockle
old truepenny swore
no said he nor care
he is somewhere among the plantations hot with rage for you
he swears he will have your life an he lives
i have sworn a like oath so look to yourself should i cheat the hangman will not worry much on your score old truepenny nor on skipper either a fine fighter he is paul spoke up omalley
faith before we downed him he had broken half a dozen heads with his rifle butt
if he had had powder thered have been some lives lost
capt paul knew well how it chanced that old truepenny was out of powder
rotherick had not been able to get away from the roost with any and the robbers store had gone to perdition with the lawless craft
how about rotherick old truepenny askin more than i can tell capt paul answered the prisoner
but the man must be alive he like cockle was born to grace a yardarm so hell live till he gets his deserts
whence did you come before making these plantations your prey
my past is a closed book frowned the robber a let it be tell ye naught of it
seeming to realize that talk could only injure his caa from that on the prisoner held his peace
he was taken to yorktown tried and neatly hung
omalley afterward told of the overland trip to york river and of a futile attempt presumably mail by some of the escaped members of the gang to resctt their old leader
capt paul learned before many days that dani cronin and her fiery daughter were at the cronin tow house in williamsburg
he did not trouble them with their misdeeds loyal the king as mistress betsy was she felt perhaps tha she was doing her duty in her unsuccessful attempt t wrest the patriots papers from the hands of capt pad slow to tell the vixen in these ladies o quality lad observed duncan macbean sagely pretty fact an a pair o bright eyes have proved mony a mans un doin
remember that woman in distress duncan has a right to even mans sympathy and aid answered the young planter
losh said duncan with a shrug
chivalry as yi call it is like to entrap ye one o these days with mor serious consequences
i suspected that young womai o designs on ye the minute she showed herself at th plantation
she was bound for master ove the river
ha
she was far afield an did not even ex cuse herself by sayin she was lost
hugon released by capt paul and his back salved wit a guinea was started toward williamsburg with th chariot and horses guinea wasted quote duncan
will ye no lear to be economical paul
the young planters hand and arm healed quickly an he was soon again in the midst of a series qf thrillin adventures
what these were the reader may learn by reading th story to follow which will be entitled paul jone double or cruise of the floating feather
