-PRON- three pulqueswillin breed who run mangy sheep an cattle while -PRON- loafs in sierrita or ride gun trail -PRON- wouldnotve 
be side grate woulda want the fun of do sech a stinkin job hissef 
joe burnie look at the stack of cure dobe brick ready to form the house -PRON- and judy ward would occupy when -PRON- be build and -PRON- be marry 
scowl uneasily -PRON- look back at tim and state -PRON- canot go gunnin for grute tim a killer an when crowded i cn be one too

no use worry judy unnecessarily -PRON- fig ure 
poor kid shed have too many wor rie anyhow since -PRON- fatherd die and shed have to sell -PRON- little ranch to level the debt -PRON- would leave

judy ward wasnot the only one who be afraid of ben grute who leave -PRON- coyote spread for -PRON- breed hand to run while -PRON- stay in sierrita gambling drink ing and roughhandle the darkskinned senorita 
a majority of the populace fear grute who d kill two man here on -PRON- own stomping ground and whose gun be for hire away from there 
stranger would hit town and talk to -PRON- or -PRON- would receive a letter and then grute would ride out 
when -PRON- return -PRON- would be wellheele with cash and would make brag reference to a gunslinging job -PRON- would do in texas new mexico or ari zona 
so folk in sierrita have reason to fear ben grute

at -PRON- favorite table by the wall grute sit read an old newspaper 
look up -PRON- eye narrow when -PRON- see the sixshooter drag at right hip and then a hun gry wolfish grin spread over -PRON- face

so -PRON- would bet ter fork over the dinero an ride close herd on -PRON- mouth 
savvy as -PRON- speak grute raise -PRON- left hand and begin shake -PRON- finger under nose 
that be the move joe have hope for 
brace -PRON- -PRON- lean a little toward grute and bark -PRON- both get gun so stop the gab an grab 
grute as -PRON- go for -PRON- gun stiffen -PRON- left arm and ram the palm of -PRON- upraised left hand against chest 
for an instant then -PRON- feature twist the fluid rhythm of -PRON- draw be break and -PRON- jerk as though -PRON- would contact a wire charge with elec tricity 
in that split second joe get the break -PRON- would play forbut -PRON- be barely an even break and nothing more 
the gun of both man clear leather and flash flame and lead simultaneously 
the only difference between -PRON- be that grute surprised and upset by the sudden realization that -PRON- trick to cinch a surefire kill have boomerang throw -PRON- lead away 
-PRON- slug tug at shirt leave a welt along left side bullet place with cold delibera tion smash chest 
a horrible shocked expression on -PRON- face stagger by the force of lead grute drop -PRON- sixgun and grip the rim of the bar

not till -PRON- house finish joe stubbornly demur 
impulsively unmindful of onlooker judy fling -PRON- arm around neck pull -PRON- head down and press -PRON- lip to -PRON-

as the second go by ear redden garcia become slack jaw and the doctor mop -PRON- face with -PRON- handkerchief and whistle long and softly
