cast away at the pole by author of little miss vassar the cotton bag the et cetera 
a -PRON- situation be not only hopeless but demoralize as well 
i realize this when i catch the professor look at -PRON- with hard and hungry eye 
what ail -PRON- prebble 
i ask straiglitene out the sleep bag with -PRON- numb finger 
-PRON- body crave nutrition -PRON- answer huskily must eat 
have -PRON- forgoiten that -PRON- divide the last ounce of pemmican yesterday 
how could i forget -PRON- i reply with this dreadful gnawing at -PRON- stomach to serve as a constant reminder something must be do -PRON- companion declare with convulsive energy 
but what 
i return 
here -PRON- be lose on the ice cap abandon by -PRON- eskimo guide sle go dog go compass break and nothing to eat but -PRON- sealskin clothe 
something must be do -PRON- say and i agree with -PRON- fully 
-PRON- join this expedition to solve problem 
solve this one 
that should have floor prebble 
but -PRON- do not have already solve this oneto -PRON- own satisfaction say -PRON- 
and again that hard and hungry look be turn on -PRON- 
what be -PRON- think of 
i demand angrily 
-PRON- give a cackling illtime laugha laugh that irritate -PRON- beyond word 
the old law of the survival of the fit will apply here -PRON- say 
in -PRON- dash for the pole captain -PRON- have attain the farth north and i have demonstrate the truth of the meteoric theory of the aurora borealis 
if i go back i can tell what -PRON- have do but -PRON- if -PRON- return to civilization without -PRON- could no more tell of -PRON- discovery than discourse in attic greek 
ergo return 
i know what -PRON- mean well enough 
but i be notready to serve as a diet for the professor even at the command of science and as for eke out -PRON- own miserable existence with a ragout la prebble iwould as soon have think of bolt the rule of three crazy i say shiveringly 
consistent -PRON- dear fellow 
see here i go on behind -PRON- be the ship and the ship crew 
when the eskimo guide get back without -PRON- search party will be send out and well be find 
but suppose the eskimo guide donot get back choose to think that -PRON- will i respond firmly not go to yield up -PRON- life to -PRON- and -PRON- meteoric theory of the aurora flat -PRON- a thought beyond -PRON- own selfish aim and ambition prebble return indignantly 
possibly i have i fling back at -PRON- tartly but i refuse to throw -PRON- away on a little old professor with a bee in -PRON- bonnet 
that be a shot that go home 
the professor sink into a morbid silence 
besides i proceed farth north doesnot satisfy -PRON- 
i shall attain the only point on this earth where the compass have but three cardinal point east west and south 
the north pole -PRON- exclaim 
madman shall attain -PRON- i fepeatd warm olow of enthusiasm pulse through -PRON- hungry body shall plant -PRON- country flag at the apex of the earth 
what good will -PRON- do vour country or any other country -PRON- ask 
-PRON- talk strangely professor i say frigidly will the discovery of the north pole benefit mankind or advance civilization a single inch consider the luster of the achievement sir 
luster of the achievement irabile dictu 
not only that i go on wave -PRON- mittened hand in a direction i believe to be south but somewhere behind -PRON- be that execrable griffyn englishman sir who have swear to beat -PRON- to the pole 
have -PRON- no pride no patriotism i have both say prebble plaintively 
i be hungry 
hungry 
the insolence of this professor fill -PRON- with wrath unutterable 
i tower above -PRON- and give -PRON- a look that send -PRON- crouch to -PRON- knee 
-PRON- lift -PRON- hand appealingly 
-PRON- nose sir say -PRON- be very white 
i leave off glare at -PRON- pick up a handful of snow and begin rub -PRON- nose 
by the time circulation be restore i find the professor have crawl into the sleep bag so i crawl in beside -PRON- thankful -PRON- have warm -PRON- up 
this particular bag be a threeman bag that be capable of hold three adult 
-PRON- be shape like an envelope opening from end to end be make of reindeer skin and have an outer covering of oiltanned sealskin the latter keep out the water and keeping in the animal heat 
i fasten the flap over the opening 
then prebble bade -PRON- an ironical good night 
the professor good night may have be ironical because of one of two thing either because of -PRON- resentment toward -PRON- or at that time of the year in the arctic continual day reign and there be no night 
which be the great achievement prebble i ask find the pole or demonstrate the truth of a meteoric theory 
there be no comparison captain salis 
find the north pole be simply a matter of brute endurance but demonstrate the truth of that theory sir involve forth all the good power of the mind 
bah sir 
i cry 
bah to -PRON- -PRON- retort 
there and then i make a mental vow that the next time i go explore in the arctic i would use more care in select the scientific member of the expedition 
prebble have a string of letter after -PRON- name abbreviate -PRON- honorable suffix and extend -PRON- to sit with the highbrow but -PRON- be about as sociable as a polar bear 
-PRON- have say good night merely to open -PRON- mutfle canversation in the sleep bag 
sometimes -PRON- be like thata human movingpicture film run through the lantern wrong end to 
i have bakd -PRON- in the hope of cut short -PRON- garrulity 
but the effort fail 
suppose -PRON- find the pole say -PRON- how be -PRON- go to know when -PRON- get there 
for a professor of -PRON- attainment observe frigidly that remark be asinine 
-PRON- cackle jeeringly 
how be -PRON- go to make sure -PRON- be at the north pole when -PRON- get there -PRON- repeat with madden insistence 
by observation 
i snap vouch for the accuracy of -PRON- observation 
-PRON- will 
-PRON- havenot any sympathy with -PRON- aim or aspiration prebble but -PRON- will have to support -PRON- in a matter of truth and verity 
if -PRON- donot -PRON- scientific reputation will suffer 
once more -PRON- cackle have be make mental note and draw deduction -PRON- proceed and from -PRON- study of human activity in the frozen world i venture a most remarkable but most scientific conclusion 
do -PRON- care to hear -PRON- 
if -PRON- have discover anything remarkable i score the event be sufficiently unique to command -PRON- attention 
out with -PRON- prebble 
listen -PRON- return in -PRON- most didactic tone 
the basis of all observation that be to command the respect and confidence of the learn public be embrace in the old statement of mei sana in corpore sanoa sound mind in a sound body 
in use -PRON- artificial horizon and work out -PRON- position -PRON- must approach the task with every faculty alert and unclouded 
certainly agree 
sali -PRON- declare no human being can undergo the awful peril and hardship of polar discovery without an overthrow of -PRON- mental poise 
bosh 
i cry 
derision say -PRON- be the fool answer to an argument prove nothing and lead nowherc 
do -PRON- mean to say i demand that i will not keep -PRON- reason 
-PRON- have not keep -PRON- -PRON- friend 
even now with the pole still far away the intense cold the terrific physical strain and the insufficient food have throw -PRON- off -PRON- mental balance 
-PRON- be not -PRON- and -PRON- have not be -PRON- for several day 
-PRON- discovery along this line lead -PRON- to propound a theory of polar aberration 
the other day -PRON- call the white snow purple 
that be a chromatic proof of fail reason rage fill -PRON- rage and indignation 
prebble cry -PRON- be the one who be lose -PRON- mind 
-PRON- another proof -PRON- continue calmly be -PRON- obstinate refusal to listen to -PRON- highly valuable suggestion 
if -PRON- mind be uncloude -PRON- would profit by -PRON- very excellent advice 
if -PRON- have -PRON- sense i answer -PRON- wouldnot think of turn cannibal merely to enable -PRON- to get back to civilization and propound -PRON- meteoric theory of the aurora 
desperate strait require desperate remedy -PRON- insist 
if -PRON- be to propound such a desperate remedy back home how long would -PRON- be before -PRON- be clap intoa straitjacket a remedy would not be propound back home -PRON- would not be necessary mad as a hatter 
i tell himand i be really begin to think so 
when a mind fail say -PRON- -PRON- be a fact of record that -PRON- believe every other mind have fail 
sali more and more -PRON- prove -PRON- contention 
the fact of record i return apply both way 
-PRON- think crazy and i know -PRON- be 
i shall discover the pole and shall convince the learn public that i have discover -PRON- 
when i get out of this bag and the ink in -PRON- fountain pen be thaw out so i can write with -PRON- put down the substance of -PRON- remark in -PRON- diary hope so -PRON- answer 
and i hope -PRON- will put -PRON- down exactly as i make -PRON- 
in -PRON- present deplorable condition however i presume that be ask too much 
thereupon -PRON- roll to one side of the bag and i roll to the other 
there be a coldness between -PRON- 
strange how little thing conspire to shape -PRON- destine here below 
but for the space which mutual intolerance place between the professor and -PRON- in that threeman sleep bag one or both of -PRON- would have be sacrifice and -PRON- sleep would have be a sleep of death 
i remember reflect bitterly on -PRON- hapless lot and dozing off by degree the professor snore fade on -PRON- ear and at last die away utterly 
how long i sleep i have no means of know but suddenly i be awaken by such a tremendous shock as i never expect to experience again and live the end of the frozen bag be bent toward each other with a great crackling so that insfead of lie prostrate i be in a sit position thrust one hand toward side of the bag only to encounter a partition of deerskin 
what have happen 
the sleep bag have suddenly acquire motionnot over the rough surface of the ice cap but apparently throughthe air 
i have a thought which chill -PRON- blood 
have the bag slip over a precipice at the edge of the ice cap 
and be -PRON- fall fall but no this could not be 
there be no precipice at the edge of the ice cap and the theory be untenable 
besides if -PRON- have be fall -PRON- would have strike something long since 
have -PRON- notice captain that -PRON- have a concentric and a lateral as well as a forward motion prebble exclaim 
be -PRON- alive 
keenly sir 
this be a most astounding phenomenon 
i now discover that the partition of reindeer hide separate the professor from -PRON- consist of a fold of the sleep bag push inward as by some hard substance 
what do -PRON- think be go on i ask 
-PRON- gyratory motion suggest a hurricane -PRON- answer 
-PRON- may be that -PRON- have be catch off the top of the ice cap by an arctic whirlwind 
can -PRON- open the flap captain 
i could and do after some little trouble 
the lengthwise slit be in front of -PRON- and -PRON- be able to look through -PRON- without a change of position 
the view be not satisfactory for a great white cloud envelop -PRON- and make -PRON- impossible to see very far in any direction 
-PRON- be suspend in gray space and move with frightful rapidity 
as -PRON- gaze out into the void a black object come rush from overhead graze the side of the sleep bag and vanish below 
-PRON- be over in a flash so quickly in fact that neither i nor -PRON- companion could determine what manner of thing the object be 
merciful power gasp 
-PRON- be bound upward muse prebble as well as onward 
can -PRON- imagine what that thing be 
i query 
possibly a missile of meteoric origin 
-PRON- be more athletic than i be captain and donot -PRON- think -PRON- could get an upward look without fall from the bag 
i crane -PRON- neck outside 
the next instang an exclamation escape -PRON- lip 
what do -PRON- see ask prebble eagerly rope 
suspend from what canot see 
the object -PRON- hang from be lose in the cloud 
by the mizzenffuck of the gr harry 
what now 
i have make a discovery that almost cause -PRON- hair to stand on end 
this sleep bag be catch on the fluke of an anchor see i see 
the sleping bag be scoop up bodily the fluke catch -PRON- in the center 
-PRON- weight on one side and -PRON- weight on the other balance the bag 
beautiful beautiful 
some aronaut be make for the pole by balloonhis drag rope sweep the ice capthe anchor catch -PRON- 
the object that dart downward a moment ago be a sandbag throw from the balloon to offset -PRON- add weight 
most remarkable 
prebble be chuckle rub -PRON- mittene hand together and thoroughly enjoy the situation some scamp be try to get ahead of griffyn and -PRON- say i crossly 
do -PRON- observe that the cold be abate inquire -PRON- companton 
the sleep bag do seem to be thaw out 
exactly 
and i be in a profuse perspiration 
prebble divest -PRON- of -PRON- mitten and parka then from somewhere about -PRON- person -PRON- produce -PRON- steelrimme spectaclesand adjust -PRON- to -PRON- nose 
ah -PRON- exclaim peer at -PRON- sharply 
-PRON- be a joy to use one glass and have -PRON- keep ciear of the frost 
do -PRON- realize what a rise thermometer mean captain say divest -PRON- mean warm weather -PRON- of a few of -PRON- fur 
also that -PRON- be sail southward at a greaf rate 
i be startle for i have not think of the rise temperature in that way 
-PRON- hope of reach the pole on that expedition be to be only a hope and nothing more 
the field be be leave clear for -PRON- rival griffyn the man who have follow -PRON- like shadow ever since leave the coast of labrador 
-PRON- bitterness of soul may be imagine but not describe 
in the gloom of the moment i forget -PRON- hunger forget thatthe professor and i werebalance on the iron horn of a dilemma that may easily prove -PRON- undoingforgot everything in fact but that i have weather that long arctic night and bear innumerable hardship all to nno purpose 
-PRON- enter the domain of the improbable come the remark of the professor break in upon -PRON- unpleasant reflection 
hard luck have a domain of -PRON- own say glare from -PRON- niche into and -PRON- so commonplace -PRON- canot call -PRON- improbable 
-PRON- do not grasp -PRON- meaning captain -PRON- companion proceed 
if -PRON- be to give any one in the temperate zone a true account of this adventure -PRON- statement would be dismiss with a shrugif with nothing bad 
-PRON- would have to back up -PRON- statement prebble 
-PRON- scientific standing would bolster up -PRON- integrity as a navigator and donot know about that 
i fall back aghast 
pick off the ice cap by a balloon and carry southward on the fluke of an anhor i have be meditate an indictiment against some reckless aronaut 
the term of that indictment be to set -PRON- right before those who have help finance -PRON- expedition 
what do -PRON- mean i rasp angrily know -PRON- have no sympathy with -PRON- poar aim and ambition but -PRON- canot deny the evidence of -PRON- sense 
captain -PRON- return be doubt the evidence of -PRON- sense 
north of the arctic circle the human faculty become frozen and unrelable 
i do not credit -PRON- present do not dare 
poppycock 
i cry inwrathful impatience -PRON- be under the spell of the purple snow -PRON- go on adventure seem very real to -PRON- because -PRON- hardship have create illusion 
all -PRON- life i have fight against be lead astray by illusionsand under the pole star lie the abode of thing that seem but be not mad as a hatter 
i storm 
not mad sali -PRON- protest mildly but temporarily unbalanced 
-PRON- be in the same state of mind 
i see -PRON- wriggle around in -PRON- half of the sleep bag punching and pinch -PRON- 
really -PRON- seem -PRON- have an idea that -PRON- be asleep and dream these very momentous event see -PRON- shake -PRON- head forebodingly upon be force to the conclusion that -PRON- be wide awake a scientific freak prebble i jeer be try in -PRON- feeble way -PRON- answer to combat error 
-PRON- be try to give reason the lie what -PRON- amount to 
when -PRON- brain be clear captain -PRON- will consider -PRON- action differently 
-PRON- be be snatch southward at a pace which should soon carry -PRON- out of these region of illusion i observe 
then if -PRON- be still in this sleep bag and balance across the fluke of the anchor i suppose -PRON- will have to believe what -PRON- see 
-PRON- make no response but i could see that -PRON- word have throw -PRON- into a brown study 
and i continue bitterly while -PRON- be bind for the prosy land of reality and truth -PRON- rival for polar honor be press forward into the white world of enchantment where -PRON- will probably discover what i have spend the well part of -PRON- life look for let that fact distress -PRON- captain say prebble 
griffyn may think -PRON- have find the pole and -PRON- may even get back to civilization to tell of itbut who will believe -PRON- 
these word although i know -PRON- to be farfetche and far from dependable give -PRON- a thrill of delight 
if -PRON- own statement and figure regard the discovery of the pole be not to be offer in evidence i take pleasure in see the report of -PRON- rival completely discredit 
the sentiment be unworthy i grant but i be human and have the customary human failing anyhow captain proceed prebble -PRON- have a contract with a newspaper a contract with a magazine and a contract with a lecture bureau 
out of these various contract -PRON- will be able to amass a fortune even if -PRON- find the pole 
griffyn even though -PRON- be successful will be discredit 
-PRON- be an exofficer of the army and the army will be behind -PRON- 
griffyn be only a poor devil who take a chance on reach the pole because -PRON- happne to find the way open 
nobody will believe griflyn 
if -PRON- claim only the farth north everybody will believe youin spite of the fact that -PRON- may not believe in -PRON- 
this be foolish talk prebble i declare 
-PRON- ought to be above such random conversation 
in -PRON- mind however i be already plan -PRON- newspaper and magazine article and be figure on the result of that lecture campaign 
there be a possibility that i should receive the thanksof congress and a medal 
-PRON- heart begin to thaw out even as the frost be melt away from the sleep bag 
-PRON- motion through space be easy and exhilarating 
-PRON- be like fly through the sky on downy bed of ease 
swinge through the air and cover the mile with magical swiftness be vastly different from trek with dog and sledge over the broken floe and make great detour to avoid open lead of water 
-PRON- be go southward and the result of -PRON- daring and -PRON- peril have be merely the attainment of the farth north 
although the fact be deplorable -PRON- have -PRON- amenity i give -PRON- over to a long period o contemplation 
in the course of -PRON- thought i find occasion to dwell at some length on the arrival of this mysterious balloon 
who be the aronaut and where have -PRON- come from 
quite naturally i could formulate no answer to these mental query 
hour pass then suddenly -PRON- companion reach over the partition and touch -PRON- shoulder 
the cloud be vanish -PRON- say out and look upward captain 
i obey 
high above -PRON- be the huge bulk of a balloon and visible over the rim of the wickerwork car suspend beneath be the face of two man whom i know only too well 
i be speechless for a moment 
then a cry of rage escape -PRON- 
sali by jupiter boom a voice from overhead 
griffyn 
i shout 
what an irony of fate 
-PRON- enemy and -PRON- secretary be the aronaut and -PRON- be theiranchor that have hook into -PRON- sleep bag 
prebble clasp -PRON- bony hand convulsively didnot know that griffyn have a balloon -PRON- mutter hoarsely 
for sake captain be amiable 
be silence 
i command 
-PRON- have take an underhand advantage of -PRON- captain sali -PRON- enemy call down 
-PRON- have attach -PRON- to -PRON- anchor sirrah with never so much as a by -PRON- leave 
-PRON- conduct be unprofessional and i shall make -PRON- know to the member of the arctic club 
if i have want to take -PRON- with -PRON- i should have invite -PRON- 
be a sailor i have a supply of language for just such an emergency as this 
before i could release the torrent of word however griffyn -PRON- last infamy be -PRON- saidhad reach -PRON- hand from the basket and have sever the drag rope with a keen knife 
down -PRON- drop through the depth of space down down the wind shriek in -PRON- ear and -PRON- brain reel 
then a shock a roar as of a hundred niagara and after thatoblivion 
where be -PRON- 
that be -PRON- first question 
-PRON- fall instinctively from -PRON- lip and be address to no one in particular 
i be a very much bewilder man 
as i recline on the ground and make use of -PRON- startled eye to -PRON- right i see a pond circular in form and perhaps fifty yard in diameter 
this pond be edge with block of white stone in the center of -PRON- stand a graven figure of colossal proportion a jet of water spout from -PRON- uplifted hand 
rosebush in full bloom border the lake and back of the rosebush separate by a stretch of white sand grow palm tree toss -PRON- fronde top in the balmy air 
bird sing in the depth of the grove and a genial heat pervade the atmosphere 
i rub -PRON- foreheadwater 
hye from the sleeve of -PRON- soaked coat as i raise -PRON- hand 
where be -PRON- 
i ask again this time in a loud key 
marvelous croon a familiar voice behind -PRON- be the balloon be -PRON- be the lake and the way -PRON- get out divide from a goes into i look around and there kneel that bless old professor wet as a rat trace algebraic symbol in the sand with -PRON- finger 
professor i call avast with -PRON- foolish ness and try to make a guess as to where -PRON- be 
-PRON- look up at -PRON- blankly 
water from -PRON- drench garment have rille around -PRON- in the sandy soil and be run down -PRON- arm and off the index finger that be trace the symbol 
still on -PRON- knee over the unsolved equation -PRON- allow -PRON- eye to wander from -PRON- toward -PRON- surrounding fountain -PRON- say 
really a most admirable work of art and -PRON- spout fresh water say freeingy -PRON- lung of a mouthful of -PRON- 
the lake -PRON- go on run -PRON- gaze oven the circular stone border show calculation and design carry out with engineering skill and a rare eye for beauty correct i agree 
rose in full bloom -PRON- proceed 
the air be redolent of odor that be soothe and delightful 
exactly i return 
-PRON- must have make a tremendous southing on the fluke of that anchor 
palm tree suggest the tropic 
suggest -PRON- answer grant -PRON- but -PRON- be a suggestion -PRON- must adopt warily 
the league upon league that lie between the arctic circle and the equator could not have be cover by -PRON- on the fluke of the anchor 
l know that say and i wish -PRON- would exercise -PRON- wit and make a guess at -PRON- present position bewilder 
one thing at a time captain -PRON- admonish bend over -PRON- problem be the balloon be -PRON- have become of the balloon i cut in searchmg the sky for some 5ign of the sky wanderer 
prebble frown and again look up 
bus -PRON- do not rise 
when -PRON- be cut away captain -PRON- explain the immense weight suddenly release from the balloon cause -PRON- to mount to extraordimary height 
this warm air too would have -PRON- effect on the gas in the bag expand -PRON- and give -PRON- tremendous buoyancy 
griffyn be sail on 
and southward i chuckle 
the scoundrel drop -PRON- by the way and i be glad -PRON- have part company 
in -PRON- rage -PRON- be at least leave -PRON- nearer the pole than -PRON- be -PRON- 
the professor frown thoughtfully 
griffyn must have come from the north captain -PRON- observe 
in order to pick -PRON- off the ice cap and bear -PRON- south griffyn must have come out of the north 
the professor logic paralyze -PRON- 
do -PRON- thinkis -PRON- possible -PRON- tongue clove to the roof of -PRON- mouth and i could carry the ditressing word no further 
do i think finish the professor that -PRON- have discover the pole and that -PRON- be come away from -PRON- when the anchor pick -PRON- up 
that be an open question an open question 
-PRON- need not concern -PRON- about -PRON- once more -PRON- begin -PRON- movement over the sand be the balloon be but i do concern -PRON- about -PRON- 
i shout 
if griffyn have find the pole i donot believe i can ever get over -PRON- 
prebble be annoy by -PRON- interruption and jab -PRON- finger angrily into the symbol b 
remember what i have already tell -PRON- sali -PRON- flare 
nobody will believe griyn find the pole even if -PRON- claim the honor 
-PRON- canot proveit 
-PRON- observation will be faulty anyhow would -PRON- be possible to take observation from a balloon travel as fast as that one 
the airship be the sport of the wind 
be -PRON- possible that the wind carry griffyn to the pole 
exercise reason sali 
then -PRON- admit that -PRON- reasoning be to be trust 
i inquire 
-PRON- be in a tropical clime 
the frozen ice field have be leave behind -PRON- 
the result of -PRON- calculation can not be nip by the 
rost 
i that be not the case why should i be qtraoglmo to work out a problem that have to do with -PRON- rescue from the lake 
amuse -PRON- sali and leave -PRON- to -PRON- labor 
professor say be in a land that be inhabit by people well advanced in the art and science 
what -PRON- see prove -PRON- 
instead of waste -PRON- energy try to work out a trifling problem would -PRON- not be well to stroll off somewhere and look for some one who can tell -PRON- what -PRON- want to know 
-PRON- be still annoy still fretful 
that equation have obsess -PRON- and -PRON- be not to be draw aw ay from -PRON- 
one thing at a time -PRON- answer 
let -PRON- meet -PRON- problem as -PRON- come to -PRON- 
-PRON- be sure of the present but -PRON- can not predicate certain of the future 
if -PRON- have business any place else sali donot let -PRON- detain -PRON- a moment 
-PRON- wave -PRON- hand to command silence 
in disgust i turn from -PRON- and search the distance with wonder eye 
fortune have be extremely kind to the professor and -PRON- there be no gainsaying that 
cut joose from the balloon by the murderous hand of griffyn -PRON- have from space 
apparently -PRON- line have fall in pleasant place 
i say apparently for presently something happen which prove -PRON- position be not so secure as i have imagine 
a sound reach -PRON- earsa sound as of a stealthy movement 
i whirl on the professor 
-PRON- have not leave -PRON- kneeling posture but be gabble to -PRON- and oblivious of everything but -PRON- foolish problem and behind -PRON- good heaven 
what i see behind the professor steal upon -PRON- with deadly intent be a figure such as i have never before encounter outside of a hideous nightmare 
seven foot the figure stand if -PRON- stand an inch -PRON- walk upright and bear a striking resemblance to man have two arm two leg a head and feature more or less human 
but -PRON- be cover from top to toe with a fine reddish hair the hair of the scalp long and flow mg about the shoulder save for a bearskin twist around -PRON- middle the monster be entirely nude 
how -PRON- eye snappgd and glow in the furry recess of -PRON- face 
and as -PRON- steal toward the professor with catlike tread -PRON- raise a long spear with a shimmering point poise the weapon 
i try to shout a warning but -PRON- tongue clove to the roof of -PRON- mough 
i try again and this time i manage to gurgle incoherently 
the professor peer in -PRON- direction 
i flutter a hand toward the impending danger and -PRON- turn around 
ha -PRON- gasp 
miss link 
speech return to -PRON- 
with -PRON- come the thought that unless i put the professor peril into term -PRON- could instantly comprehend -PRON- be lose be the miss link i cry b be the spear and be -PRON- 
a divide -PRON- from b go into and be what become of prebble 
-PRON- give a yell of horror and 
fall flat 
chug 
as -PRON- drop the spear flash through the air above -PRON- head and bury -PRON- point in the sand 
this danger have hurl -PRON- upon -PRON- with paralyze suddenness 
i have succeed in master -PRON- nerve however and be able to deal actively with the situation 
in a twinkling i spring for the spear jerk -PRON- from the ground and balance -PRON- in -PRON- hand as i face the hairy demon kill -PRON- captaindonot cry prebble excitedly 
really -PRON- s a most remarkable speciman and -PRON- must take -PRON- back with -PRON- 
the thing crouch in front of -PRON- eye burnmg like twin coal and muscle work with an itch to spring a gigantic gorilla 
i declare 
nonsense return prebble as much above the gorilla as -PRON- be below man 
-PRON- think be paoan god and be bent on test -PRON- mvulnerability 
careful what vou do captain

prebble get up and look the hairy monster in the eye hungry -PRON- say make motion with -PRON- hand and jaw as though eat famish 
what kind of a pagan god do -PRON- imagine -PRON- will think vou if -PRON- find -PRON- be hungry demand so say the professor 
-PRON- lucubration captain occasionally evolve something that be particularly apt 
just then the monster roar aloud 
the mighty sound go echo through the grove and be answer in kind from a dozen different point 
-PRON- be undo 
i groan as a whole pack of the fiend appear and race toward -PRON- in full cry from every quarter 
i be not blind to the incongruity of the situa tion 
although no judge of art i know full well that the colossus in the center of the lake be beyond the craft of these halfnake creature whose facial angle be small improvement on those of the orangutan 
grant that these man brute be subject of a ruling race where be the real lord of the country or some one in authority to whom -PRON- could make appeal 
prebble and i be face to face with death in a most horrible form 
the red demon be rush upon -PRON- snarl and yelping like so many bloodhound -PRON- spear level and ready to impale -PRON- 
-PRON- could not take to tree for the attack force be between -PRON- and the grove 
nor could -PRON- retreat for the lake lie behind -PRON- 
-PRON- doom be seal 
i feel -PRON- in every fiber yet i would not shame the glorious tradition ofthe american sailor by stand supinely and allow -PRON- to be spear 
the last ditch for -PRON- 
grip the haft of -PRON- sevenfoot lance i hold -PRON- at attention 
consider that the world be to lose an exhaustive paper on the meteoric theory of the aurora and a thesis on the miss link prebble carry -PRON- admirably 
thirty second of life captain say -PRON- -PRON- be get ready to thiow 
only one of -PRON- be to throw say look 
that hulkig imp with the ring in -PRON- ear be to have the first cast 
see -PRON- rise on one foot -PRON- throw -PRON- backhe let the spear y i watch every faculty whet to abnormal keenness 
the weapon dart toward -PRON- -PRON- bright point cleave the air like a jet of fire 
i strike at -PRON- wildly 
fate be kind and i counter the shaft swerve -PRON- sideways and send -PRON- hiss into the water of the lake 
the fatal moment be postpone that be all 
clench -PRON- tooth i wait for the next enemy to step to the front and make a trial 
captain quaver the professor clutch -PRON- arm convulsively have this forget about -PRON- a revolver 
prebble be hold -PRON- out to -PRON- in -PRON- shake hand 
a shout escape -PRON- lige down the spear i clutch the firearm and before a second savage could launch a shaft i have fire 
the effect of that shot be tremendous 
the bullet do not find a markmy nerve be not steady enough for accurate shootingbut the report be allsufficient of the uncanny creature fall face downward and lie groveling on the earth now prebble cry sharply run for -PRON- life 
the woodsthe wood 
-PRON- start and have almost gain the shelter of the tree when a second detachment of the enemy appear before -PRON- 
i present the revolver and pull the trigger but only an omi rnious click follow 
again and again i try but without success the cylinder be empty 
togmlfchaqua pura mix with the ammumtion say the professor sagely 
thar hath in the lake must have disable the firearm a wonder captain that -PRON- be able to fire even a single shot 
a very pretty problem suggest -PRON- and i 
look 
i cry interrupt -PRON- idle chattbr in a frenzy elevate -PRON- spear point be dead man in a dozen tick of the watch unless -PRON- can do something to save -PRON- be at the end of -PRON- resource declare the professor calmly 
but i be not 
an idea flash over -PRON- and i begin pufte -PRON- into execution without delziy 
with a hop skip and jump i start a grotesque dance hop up and down wave -PRON- arm and grimace as horribly as i know how 
the professor watch -PRON- in a sort of fascination 
i see wonder in -PRON- face and then dismay and something very like anguish 
but i also see the lift spear of the red rabble poise motionless in midair 
that be the result for which i be work and i redouble -PRON- exertion scream prebble be afraid of this 
i know -PRON- be unbalanced 
i know -PRON- mind be trend toward this deplorable condition but i have not expect such violence 
get busy prebble 
i pant pirouette on -PRON- toe and throw off a small cascade of water as i whirl 
-PRON- poor friend wail prebble clasp -PRON- hand and strike an attitude of extreme dejection 
go to -PRON- 
pffe show off a few buckandwing step a pair of dance dervish prebble 
reel -PRON- off manreel -PRON- off 
the spear still hang motionless in the air 
i have the hairy monster guess for -PRON- contoetion be make a powerful appeal to -PRON- aboriginal mind 
the professor hurry toward -PRON- and lay an implore hand on -PRON- arm 
if -PRON- must die captain sali -PRON- beg let -PRON- go decently and as become intelligent man be an idiot 
i fling back -PRON- see that do this for a purpose purpose the professor answer 
what purpose can such crazy antic serve resemble a coupie of pincushion by now prebble if i hadnot start this fandangd 
the word be fairly jolt ouit of -PRON- as i totter around first on one foot and then on the other see this trick work on the incian 
all barbarian particularly those who be low in the human scale have a sperstitious eration for person who be crazy 
the idea pop into -PRON- head and i begin to carry -PRON- out 
-PRON- see what an effect -PRON- be have 
-PRON- enemy have now drop -PRON- spear point and be gaze at -PRON- curiously 
-PRON- imagine remark the professor study the savage with a gooddeal of interest -PRON- be some sort of an evil deity donot care what -PRON- imagine say just so -PRON- keep -PRON- distance and donot use -PRON- spear 
how long do -PRON- think -PRON- can keep that up donot know i answer hope i can keep -PRON- up until somethingor other happen to insure -PRON- safety indenitely 
the professor be showig no disposition to join -PRON- in the dance 
-PRON- be only when the savage execute a movement en masse toward the right and lift -PRON- spear for a throw at -PRON- that -PRON- leap into terpsichorean effort 
-PRON- require no ufging from -PRON- 
-PRON- be quick to perceive the danger and equally quick toresont to the only mean for avert -PRON- 
round and round -PRON- whirl exemplify everything from a double shuffle to hornpipe and a highland fle 
this be monstrous wail the protessor step high 
what a performance for a man of -PRON- professional standing 
sali have never feel more humiliate in -PRON- life 
keep -PRON- up 
i beg of -PRON- hoarsely 
when -PRON- give out and have to drop feign a fit 
if -PRON- do -PRON- well -PRON- may save -PRON- 
at that moment when the spear be again lift the savage who have be routedpear the lake by the report of the revolver come war ily upon the scene 
by a wide detour -PRON- avoid -PRON- and join the one who be threaten -PRON- be something do now gasp hoarsely savage who just come will tell the other about the report of the revolver say prebble hopefully and that will so awe those who be hostile that -PRON- will be spare and allow to go in peace 
but the professor be wrong 
instead of the late comer inspire fear in -PRON- comrade by tell of the explode firearm the other side seem to get the good of the argument 
both party present a united front what be bad -PRON- exhibition of fancy dancing seerpe to have lose -PRON- charm 
the hostility wheeze the professor to have become general 
all hand be make ready to comc at -PRON- i whisper to be do sali 
can -PRON- run useless 
spear would lay -PRON- low before -PRON- have take a dozen leap toward the sky line may as well stop this foolish dancing 
yes and -PRON- both stagger to a stop like top that have all but run down 
i face the desperate situation with all the fortitude i could muster 
die like a man prebble i gasp all -PRON- can do now 
another moment and -PRON- should have fall pierce by half a dozen spear but the unexpected happen 
out from the shadow of the palm tree glide a form jn white halt between -PRON- and the threatening spear point and raise one hand commandingly 
instantly every spear point drop and the form in white turn slowly and survey -PRON- 
-PRON- protector be a woman 
-PRON- delicate feature the shelllike tint of -PRON- cheek -PRON- long sunny hair -PRON- graceful form all testify to that 
-PRON- be clothe in a cling robe of white edge with gold galloon buskin of white and gold cover -PRON- small foot and around -PRON- brow be a gold ribbon 
-PRON- wear no head cover and -PRON- wealth of yellow tress flow about hern like a veil even to -PRON- waist 
never have i behold such rare loveliness and twenty year of sea have not blunt -PRON- appreciation of the divine in woman 
an exclamation of astonishment and admiration fall from -PRON- lip 
nor be the astonishment all on -PRON- part 
surprise and wonder be mirror in the woman wide blue eye 
although thankful for -PRON- timely intervention i would have have -PRON- meeting with -PRON- occur unaer ippier auspex 
a young be but be particular how -PRON- come under the eye of beauty and -PRON- watersoaked clothe and disheveled appearance make -PRON- position most embarrassing 
prebble do not seem to mind -PRON- -PRON- be smirk and rub -PRON- hand and pushmg -PRON- forward in a way that irritate -PRON- 
thank -PRON- kindly say -PRON- bob -PRON- head and flash -PRON- bald pate in -PRON- eye the owner of these beautiful ground madam -PRON- language be not her 
-PRON- stare at the professor blankly and then shift -PRON- gaze to -PRON- 
-PRON- smile 
small wonder -PRON- smile with -PRON- learned companion ogling and duck and make a display of -PRON- hungry whimper the professor convey imaginary thing to -PRON- mouth and work -PRON- jaw famish -PRON- turn to -PRON- with an unwonted lusterin -PRON- eye 
-PRON- canot deceive -PRON- into thinking -PRON- be pagan god -PRON- impart 
this be paradise captain and -PRON- be one of the peri 
stop -PRON- tomfoolery say petulantly 
-PRON- spectacle be hang from one of -PRON- ear one of -PRON- mukluk be go and -PRON- look as though -PRON- have be through a cyclone laugh at -PRON- 
at -PRON- -PRON- titter 
both of -PRON- mukluk be go captain and i do not hear the rest 
look down i discover to -PRON- horror that -PRON- foot be bare and never before have -PRON- seem so large or so out of place 
i redden to the root of -PRON- hair 
a sailor and a gentleman may be excuse i trust 
-PRON- speak to -PRON- -PRON- voice like a flow rill ripple musical 
but -PRON- word 
-PRON- be as much beyond -PRON- as our be beyond -PRON- 
when -PRON- cease speak there be silence look perhaps what i could not say for -PRON- vouclisafe another smile turn to the hairy one behind -PRON- and address -PRON- imperiously 
-PRON- vanish then vanish whither -PRON- have come 
i gaze after -PRON- with eye that speak what -PRON- lip dare not utter if -PRON- could 
the fiend steal up to -PRON- fawningly make sign indicative of good will as well as suggest that -PRON- go with -PRON- 
-PRON- heed the mute request and be lead off through the grove in the direction take by the lady -PRON- lady of hope and deliverance 
behind -PRON- troop the other detachment of miss link equally harmless and equally desirous of show the amicable turn -PRON- feeling have take 
where be -PRON- professor 
i ask for the third time 
-PRON- have fall say -PRON- upon some uncharted isle in the tropic 
-PRON- be telemachus i be mentor the maid be circe 
beware captain 
folly 
do -PRON- mean to say that -PRON- be carry on the anchor of balloon from above the arctic circle to below the tropic of cancer 
how else do -PRON- account for the flower the palm the balmy atmosphere 
-PRON- be castaway captain and -PRON- line -PRON- seem have fall in pleasant place 
i marvel 
yet how else could -PRON- explain the surrounding in which -PRON- find -PRON- 
presently -PRON- come upon a vista which seem cut bodily from the thousand and one night 
a palace arise before -PRON- a palace with dome and tower of pure white outline against the blue sky 
a great flight of marble step lead upward to the facade of the building 
on either side of the first sfep stand two stalwart warrior on guard 
such a magnificent building murmur prebble 
there must be something to eat inside of -PRON- captain 
that be -PRON- hope say and the quicker -PRON- fall to the well be grow weak in the knee 
at the foot of the grand stairway a man appear as if by magic 
evidently -PRON- have be inform of -PRON- coming and be expect -PRON- 
ile be of normal height and wear a white tunie edge with silver 
-PRON- head be uncover and -PRON- forehead and short vellow hair be span with a silver ribbon -PRON- face be highbrowe and almost of grecian contour 
-PRON- eye be blue as be those of the young woman and as -PRON- rest on -PRON- a peculiar sensation speed along every nerve 
mentality be the keynote of the man eye 
the power of -PRON- mind be extraordinary and be reflect in -PRON- glance in a manner most strange and incomprehensible 
not be verse in psychology i could not explain this visual force 
i merely realize that the eye of this startling individual usurp the office of lip and tongue speak a language and compelling obedience 
without a spoken word the man turn on the hairy creature who have conduct -PRON- to the palace 
-PRON- quail under -PRON- look shiver and slink away 
then -PRON- flash an order to -PRON- 
the next moment -PRON- be ascend the step prebble and i at -PRON- heel 
whether -PRON- be the hypnotism of the man eye or a weakness cause by hunger ver -PRON- brain grow dizzy i stagger rather than walk and have but faint recollection of event for some time 
-PRON- be in a large room -PRON- seem and more of the uncouth slave be at work over -PRON- 
in duc course -PRON- leave this room and come out into another where there be strange plant and blossom and couch cover with fine skin -PRON- recline 
slave hover about -PRON- give -PRON- food out of silver dish what -PRON- eat i do not know but the food whatever -PRON- be be piquant and delicious 
with hunger finally appease i feel in a mood for sleep but the professor be gartulous -PRON- sizhe with blissful content settline -PRON- luxuriously upon -PRON- couch this be paradise this be the abode of the bl tor one be very much oblige to griffyn for cut -PRON- clear of -PRON- balloon 
-PRON- will answer for that 
i scowl allow a spasm of righteous wrath to cross -PRON- contentment 
will -PRON- so mv dear captain chuckle prebble 
where and when if i may ask 
where 
i snap 
why where else can i pillory -PRON- save in -PRON- own country which -PRON- unprofessional conduct have disgrace 
and when -PRON- ask 
as to that prebble i promise -PRON- -PRON- shall happen directly -PRON- return to civilization 
return to civilization have alreadyreturne to civilization captain 
ever since -PRON- drop from the balloon -PRON- have see all around -PRON- evidence of a most civilized and progressive people 
-PRON- quibble sald with strong dlsapproval -PRON- do not fit -PRON- character professor 
-PRON- understand what i mean 
-PRON- have here a very high grade of civilization -PRON- seem but what i have in mind be a return to -PRON- own country 
and when will that be -PRON- ask in the dark as to that presume however that -PRON- have only to describe -PRON- situation to the people in authority here in order to be assist to a home port 
-PRON- cackle 
there be something in that jaugh of -PRON- which always ruffle -PRON- nerve the wrong way 
what be there humorous about that 
i demand fancy -PRON- reply that -PRON- be build -PRON- hope on a very insecure foundation 
the ruler of this most delightful land may have other plan for -PRON- 
-PRON- may not lend -PRON- -PRON- assistance as -PRON- so fondly imagine 
certainly i return -PRON- must have compassion upon -PRON- 
people so artistic and so progressive must have heart to be touch by -PRON- forlorn situation 
-PRON- be a rich people and a rich and cultured people be always generous 
-PRON- may not be able to help -PRON- however 
why not 
prebble loved disputation for -PRON- own sake 
-PRON- be not always to be take seriously when -PRON- grow arguinentative be fairly well acquaint with the chart portion of the seven sea -PRON- go on and i have read extensively along the line of anthropology and kindre science but i find -PRON- impossible to identify those hairy monster who come so near prove -PRON- undoing or these whiterobe demigod who come to -PRON- rescue 
nor have i the least idea what country this be or where -PRON- can be situate 
if wvisite before -PRON- certainly must have be write about 
there be nothing in literature however that touch upon this favor country 
of that be positive 
do -PRON- incline to the belief that -PRON- make an abnormal southing while on the anchor of that balloon 
-PRON- doubt -PRON- when i mention the matter by the lake and then on -PRON- way to this palace -PRON- seem to swerve and incline to -PRON- original opinion 
but -PRON- own idea have undercrone a change 
-PRON- be physically impossible for -PRON- to be carry so far south say -PRON- after a little reflection 
-PRON- be in a tropic land tropic land under the arctic circle paradox i grant -PRON- 
yet -PRON- must helieve the evidence of -PRON- sense and predicate equatorial region here or else -PRON- must doubt the evidence altogether and fall back upon the assumption that -PRON- be non cou pos and be not to place any credence in what -PRON- see or feel or hear 
bah say l rather incline to the theory -PRON- proceed unmove by -PRON- disgusted retort -PRON- be under the spell of the purple snow 
-PRON- be very possible that -PRON- be btlll on the ice cap in the sleep bag far go with hunger and freeze slowly 
-PRON- mind be benumb save for a few of -PRON- faculty which appear to be abnormally alert 
this astounding theory quite take -PRON- breath 
noensense 
i exclaim as soon as i be able to express -PRON- suppose -PRON- have be immpale by that spear down by the lake 
that be not an imaginative spear prebble and -PRON- would not have die an mmaginative death 
to drop into the vernacular -PRON- smile -PRON- frozen finish would merely have be symbolize by that spear 
what -PRON- be apparently underit seem to -PRON- be merely symbolical and -PRON- think be asleep 
if -PRON- be -PRON- would be difficult to awake in a pleasanter paradise than this 
for one captain i be not particular whether -PRON- ever leave this abode of bliss or not 
how about -PRON- meteoric theory of the aurora -PRON- will be a distinct loss to science if that be never enunciate -PRON- answer with a dash of disappointment -PRON- brightenedif -PRON- fail to qualify with -PRON- newspaper and magazine and the lecture platform i believe i should be able to bear with -PRON- own disappoint ment -PRON- principal reason for return to -PRON- own country just now say i firmly be to enlighten the arctic club and the world regard griffyn 
forget griffyn captain 
-PRON- own safety seem to demand that -PRON- cut -PRON- adrift 
i be thankful that -PRON- release -PRON- from -PRON- balloon for otherwise -PRON- should not have visit this most lnterestlng country 
i have a sufciency of -PRON- view however and while -PRON- talk on i go to sleep 
i be awaken by a touch on the shoulder 
start up from the couch i encounter the yes of the man who have meet -PRON- at the palace step 
the eye bid -PRON- get up obeyed and catch a ghimpse of the professor in a tunic of white and silver with a silver ribbon snugly encircle -PRON- bald spot 
at this i laugh immoderately but cease when the face of -PRON- unknown friend turn on -PRON- in rebuke 
the face be grave ominous and i read disaster in -PRON- every line 
command by a look prebble and i trail after -PRON- guide to an archway hang with arra in cloth of gold 
the curtain be part by invisible hand and -PRON- pass through into an immense apartment -PRON- eye dazzle with a scene ofgorgeousness i shall never forget 
yellow and white and blood red be the prevail color of vaulted roof lofty wall and tessellate floor 
the gleam of gold be above -PRON- the sheen of silver on all side and -PRON- buskine foot trod tile of jasper 
in front of -PRON- at the farther end of the vast room be a throne with a crimson canopy 
un der the canopy sit a man clothe in the prevail white and silver and wear a crown that flash with jewel 
on the topmost step of the short flight lead to the dais sit a regal figure in white and gold 
i rub -PRON- bewilder eye for unless -PRON- deceive -PRON- this be -PRON- who have save -PRON- at the lake 
the room be throng with people in white and silver and white and gold and a lane have be open for -PRON- up to the very step of the throne 
ray of sun enter through window in the eastern wall strike the tile and throw wondrous patch of scarlet over the whiteclad group 
amid all this bewilder scene the mind of prebble be amalytically at work 
i could hear -PRON- mutter the woman wear the gold and the man wear the silver 
how do -PRON- come that an island so rich with inhabitant of such intellectual power have never be hear of by the outside ordp captain well breathe softly 
-PRON- still think be pagan deity 
-PRON- have be robe in the costume of the country and -PRON- with -PRON- black hair and dark eye look well enough although a trifle out of place stand there like a dazed imbecile 
throw dignity into -PRON- bearing 
watch -PRON- 
-PRON- adjust -PRON- spectacle fold -PRON- arm across -PRON- narrow chest and peer about -PRON- with lofty disdain 
but -PRON- be not of a size to foster an impression of haughtiness 
as -PRON- stand there cynosure for all eye two between -PRON- -PRON- carry -PRON- old sleep bag and lay -PRON- on the floor before the throne 
the man who have take -PRON- in hand advanced kowtow to -PRON- ruler and begin to talk 
-PRON- be word that come from -PRON- lip and that -PRON- have all to do with -PRON- be evident from the astounded look that continue to be turn in -PRON- direction 
when -PRON- have make an end -PRON- salaam and step back 
thereupon the young woman speak to the king from -PRON- seat on the tep 
-PRON- remark finish the king -PRON- indulge in a few word and the man who have bring -PRON- to the throne room give -PRON- attention to the sleep bag 
-PRON- clothe be inside the bag and be bring out and duly exhibit 
there be something else which -PRON- friend want and -PRON- get -PRON- by bury himsellfto the heel in the bag 
as i live -PRON- be a quaft flask of whisky 
look here prebble i growl in -PRON- ear do -PRON- have that flask all the while -PRON- be lose on the ice cap -PRON- mumble 
and -PRON- never say anything about -PRON- 
i exclaim fiercely 
i tell -PRON- be save -PRON- for emergency 
i be strongly tempt to lay hand on prebble but just then hand be lay on both of -PRON- and -PRON- be hurry up nearer the throne 
the king rap -PRON- scepter against the arm of the throne chair 
a little man appear a little man with luminous eye and the nose and chin of a punchinello 
in -PRON- hand -PRON- carry two metal circlet each cross with a pair of thin metal band bent into concave form 
-PRON- seem to understand what be wanie of -PRON- for after salute the king -PRON- come to prebble and -PRON- and place the contrivance upon -PRON- head 
-PRON- fit the skull like a cap i trust that so far -PRON- have not be necessary for an officer and a gentleman to dwell upon -PRON- veracity 
that i advert to -PRON- here be simply because i have reach a point where the reader credulity may receive -PRON- first shock 
other shock will follow and i wish to lighten the blow by a manly and straightforward statement 
prebble and i have drop in on a truly wonderful people 
the skill -PRON- show the art -PRON- apply the highly develop mental process that be -PRON- be the natural concomitant of a civilization mark at every turn by way and mean to -PRON- oftentime inexplicable i be write these experience with painstaking care and if the reader will abide with -PRON- to the end i promisethat -PRON- shall not only be instruct and thrill but convince as well wa then for the first shock 
the instant those metal cap be place upon -PRON- head prebble and i be put en rapport with these amazing being 
-PRON- could not only understand -PRON- speech but -PRON- tongue be endow with -PRON- 
stranger wherice come -PRON- demand the king 
prebble clap -PRON- hand like a delighted schoolboy pull off -PRON- metal cap look at -PRON- gloatingly fondle -PRON- and then replace -PRON- upon -PRON- shine pate 
from a far country sir lic answer 
what bring vou hither chance 
and a drag rope i add mentally 
be -PRON- from beyond the ice wall 
prebble blink in bewilderment do not understand -PRON- majesty say -PRON- 
for once i happen to be a little quick of comprehension 
what be the latitude of this country sir i askud eagerly 
the king nod toward the little man with the hooked nose and chin degree and forty minute north say the little man 
twenty minute i gasp reel against prebble 
twenty minute from the pole falter prebble 
what do this all mean 
only twentythree mile from the goal of -PRON- hope shout only twentvthree mile from fame from the great discovery tie world have ever know 
glory 
i dance around like a wild man mile 
i roar 
tnile 
i start at a run for the doorway anxious to leave the palace and race on foot over the twentythree mile that separate -PRON- from the spot -PRON- be -PRON- consume desire to reach 
prebble grab -PRON- but i keep on jerk -PRON- heel over head 
the two hairy warrior then place -PRON- in -PRON- way and i fight like a fiend to escape 
there be the great disorder in the vast room 
the king be on -PRON- foot and the court be in a tumult be fiercely -PRON- sense dazzle by -PRON- proximity to the pole 
have i use -PRON- reason i may have question the reliable nature of the knowledge just give -PRON- for how could i be in a tropical region and yet only twentythree mile from the goal of myl ambition 
but i be in no condition just then to reason about anything 
i be wild with excitement 
food and rest have revive -PRON- failing strength a straightcut blow from the shoulder daze one of the hairy guard -PRON- only daze -PRON- however 
have -PRON- be endow with ordinary physical power -PRON- would have floor -PRON- 
the fellow come back at -PRON- hiss like a wild eat 
i see -PRON- ponderous hand clench for a retaliate blow and -PRON- gigantic arm draw back 
a shout from the king cause the second of the two guard to seize -PRON- companion arm before -PRON- could strike 
this diversion seem to leave the path clear for -PRON- and i turn to continue mry mad flight 
a foot trip -PRON- and i measure -PRON- length on the jasper tile 
before i could rise two bare knee be on -PRON- chest pin -PRON- down and two hand be at -PRON- wrist hold -PRON- powerless 
prebble white and apprehensive draw close 
captain say -PRON- -PRON- be beside -PRON- 
what folly 
man man donot -PRON- know -PRON- be impossible to escape from this palace guard as -PRON- be 
even if -PRON- do manage to get outside in traverse the twentythree mile say to lie between -PRON- and the pole there wculd be ample opportunity to lay -PRON- by the heel 
the whole country would be up in arm against -PRON- 
i cease struggle 
that be quite true professor answer 
-PRON- enthusiasm run away with -PRON- 
-PRON- enthusiasm come very near cost -PRON- -PRON- life 
but the pole there be some wild guessing on the part of the gentleman with the hooked nose 
reason tell -PRON- that the polar region be choke with ice 
there could be no summer weather such a short distance from the north pole 
either that captain or -PRON- be in a realm of enchantment donot believe in enchantment i scoff enough of this 
get off -PRON- say to the giant on -PRON- chest and be tractable 
the guard do not seem to comprehend 
prebble pick up the helmet which i have drop from -PRON- brow and replace -PRON- 
now tell -PRON- say -PRON- 
by the aid of that marvelous ring hell be able to understand -PRON- 
some of the noble have advance by that time and the hostile flash of -PRON- blue compelling eye force the warrior to arise and allow -PRON- to regain a more dlgme attitude 
i arrange -PRON- disordered tunic 
the sallen guard place -PRON- one on cach side of -PRON- and one of the noble step close and speak sharply 
this say -PRON- most unseemly conduct for the throne room be carry away by the knowledge that be impart to -PRON- i return humbly be very sorry i cause any trouble 
-PRON- be very impulsive put in prebble altogether too much so at time for -PRON- own good 
but at least assure -PRON- bar a few little conceit and crochet -PRON- be a very agreeable fellow 
-PRON- majesty deal very severely with any infraction of court etiquette go on the noblc unless -PRON- promise to be more circumspect in -PRON- behavior -PRON- will be necessary to put -PRON- in restraint do that vour lordship speak up prebble in considerable agitation captainmean well i assure -PRON- although now and then -PRON- have a poor way of show -PRON- 
i will stand sponsor for -PRON- 
the flinty blue eye of the noble wither the professor for a space 
and who will be responsible for -PRON- -PRON- ask 
prebble be usually sufficient unto -PRON- and -PRON- be humorous to see -PRON- squirm and shrivel under the flash of the noble blue orb 
in -PRON- own country answer the professor attempt a little dignity but with scant success -PRON- word be as good as -PRON- bond 
prebble be measure with a swift glance and the noble turn away with a shadow of a smile be -PRON- laugh at -PRON- the professor whisper in -PRON- ear do -PRON- mean by that 
-PRON- ring crook say completely restore to -PRON- normal condition of mind and -PRON- doesnot enhance the dignity of -PRON- appearamnpe 
better straighten -PRON- prebble afraid this outburst of yours capfan remark prebble as -PRON- straighten the ring will inspire the king to harsh measure against -PRON- donot think much of -PRON- as a king if -PRON- allow -PRON- judgment to be sway by a little natural exuberance on -PRON- part 
-PRON- should have repress -PRON- 
the fellow in the skin robe be still blink from the effect of that blow -PRON- deal -PRON- 
but for a remarkably thick skull i return not now be able even to blink 
the disorder have die away and a measure of courtly quiet once more prevailed 
the king have seat -PRON- and -PRON- guard obey an imperial gesture return prebble and -PRON- to the foot of the throne 
for age say -PRON- majesty -PRON- mythology have teach usto look for two fiend who wcre to drop from the sky and bring woe and ruin to -PRON- devoted kingdom 
be -PRON- those arch fiend 
answer 
by this time i have recover -PRON- wit 
no sir reply -PRON- be not the fiend -PRON- be expect 
-PRON- be come through the air on a strange ship and seem to be a little behind schedule but i assure -PRON- -PRON- will arrive all right 
prebble whirl on -PRON- catch one of -PRON- hand and shake -PRON- heartily neatly do captain -PRON- whisper must beat griffyn to the pole i return excitedly 
if -PRON- come down anywhere this side of latitude ninety i think that will block -PRON- 
-PRON- will be on the lockout fiend -PRON- mention pursue -PRON- meanwhile as there seem to be no httle mystery surroundmg -PRON- two gentleman i shall be under the pamful necessity of have -PRON- put to death 
sire cry the young woman look up at the king and hold out -PRON- hard appalingly 
-PRON- start to enter a vigorous protest but the king wave -PRON- hand impatiently 
princess ylma enough say -PRON- to the young woman sternly to -PRON- -PRON- add be deaf to -PRON- entreaty -PRON- have come as tradition say the demon be to come -PRON- act stranely and an ounce of prevention in this particular case be worth a pound of cure 
the professor and i gaze at each other in wildest horror 
for a space prebble dppeare to shrivel up then suddenly -PRON- expand a forlorn hope flicker across -PRON- pallid face 
spring to the heap of garment lie on the sleep bag -PRON- pick up the flask and carry -PRON- to the edge of the dais 
-PRON- be very great prophet in -PRON- own land king -PRON- aver glibly 
behold the proof of -PRON- skill and -PRON- wave the bottle aloft 
what be -PRON- ask the king 
the elixir of life sire 
drink and -PRON- will renew -PRON- youth 
eagerly the king grasp at the flask 
unwittingly prebble have touch a button that connect with -PRON- majestys dear desire 
beware -PRON- majesty cry voice 
itmay be poison already the king have unscrew the top 
after hesitate a moment -PRON- smile craftily 
drink say -PRON- hand the flask to the professor 
if -PRON- kill -PRON- 
i will let -PRON- alone 
prebble take a swallow from the flask 
then i grab -PRON- away from -PRON- and take another 
this satisfy the king 
take the flask from -PRON- hand -PRON- raise -PRON- to -PRON- lip and drank deeply 
-PRON- be lose 
as the fiery liquor go down an electric thrill send the hot blood race through -PRON- vein and -PRON- feel that the beginning of -PRON- rejuvenation be at hand 
these be not the fiend who be to bring destruction to -PRON- kingdom -PRON- cry 
these be -PRON- good friend 
lord nyli -PRON- be in -PRON- chargetheir safety be upon -PRON- head 
lodge -PRON- royally give -PRON- the good of everything 
gadzook but i feel a different man already 
away with -PRON- lord nylis 
and as for the rest of -PRON- depart from the presence 
i would fain be alone with -PRON- elixir 
again be there confusion 
during the hubbub prebble and i be conduct from the throne room and from the palace by lord nyli 
the flask of bourbon have save -PRON- for the time be but at what a cost of danger to -PRON- and vicissitude to that devoted kingdom forty eightynine forty i keep repeat to -PRON- as the professor and i follow lord nylis down the grand stairway of the palace could think of nothing but that the culmination of -PRON- earthly desire lie only twentythree mile away 
this lord nyhs be the astute person who have engineer -PRON- entrance into the palace 
at the foot of the marble step -PRON- pause and look toward the red warrior on the right 
instantly the warrior spear ring thrice against -PRON- shield 
that call -PRON- oyd car explain -PRON- lordship 
-PRON- be some distance from -PRON- palace and must ride 
the metallic crash of spear on shield have bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
at -PRON- lordship mention of a conveyance an idea flash through -PRON- mind 
could -PRON- not ride to the pole 
i ask eagerly 
-PRON- be not far lord nylis and i particularly desire to reach the pole 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- would be as much as -PRON- life be worth -PRON- answer 
a cold chill strike to -PRON- heart 
what do -PRON- mean 
i falter 
the pole be in the land of the chur -PRON- go on 
-PRON- be brute like these -PRON- indicate the guard to right and leave of the palace step but -PRON- be not under -PRON- domination of the chur -PRON- have bring to submission b will power alone and -PRON- be everywhere throughout the kingdom serve as soidieysand menial 
the chur at the pole however be wild and ferocious 
-PRON- never encroach upon -PRON- territory unless in quest of slave 
ah here be the oyd car 
mount genemgn 
the vehicle now draw up before -PRON- be a queer bit of mechanism 
the bed of -PRON- be dia tondshape and have a large wheel 
at each side and small one at the point front and rear 
aeros the middle be throw a very wide seat and there be another narrow one occupy by a shaggy chur in the front point 
home klimon say lord nyl 
klimon bend over asquare box and slightly raise a cover at the same time manipulate a lever on -PRON- left 
at once -PRON- glide and noiselessly run point foremost what furnish the motive power the professor be first with a question on this head be the powr that drive this vehicle -PRON- lordship 
-PRON- call -PRON- oyd answer the noble 
-PRON- drive all the machinery in the kingdom 
oyd mutter the professor know about everything worth know but somehow that have -PRON- 
will -PRON- explain 
the force be magnetic be the answer 
there be a mineral which -PRON- delve from deep in the ground and call zellin 
the whirl of the earth create a friction which make of the north pole a tremendously powerful loadstone so that -PRON- attract every particle of zellin on the surface of the kingdomand -PRON- attract only zellin and nothing else see say the professor sagely 
-PRON- have a piece of zellin in that box on the forward point of the carriage 
yes 
that box be a nonmagnetic screen and when -PRON- cover the cube of zellin the oyd power be shut off 
but the instant the front of the screen be raise the attract force set in and -PRON- move 
most remarkable cry prebble 
the amount of power be regulate by lift the front of the screenr exactly 
if the front be raise onethird the oyd force or attraction be only onethird but raise onehalf the attraction be onehalf the power of the zellin cube and so on 
hence -PRON- proceed at a slow pace at a run or with the full power of the cube -PRON- all but fly 
prebble strike -PRON- hand together in ecstasy 
how large be the cube -PRON- lordship -PRON- ask 
this car be fit with a twelveinch block which be a power 
a sixinch cube would be a twelveman power a tenty fourinch cube would be a power and so on 
be the force of the polar attraction always the same 
always 
and always attract due north the attraction be continually toward the pole 
how be -PRON- able to proceed in anything but a straight line lever on left conneet with the wheel at the rear point 
the turning of that wheel act as a rudder and steer -PRON- easterly or westerly 
beautiful beautiful 
but if -PRON- wish to go south directly away from the pole 
-PRON- rudder couldnot help -PRON- to move in that direction 
certainly not 
when -PRON- wish to go southward -PRON- make use of the suboyd power 
what be that pray 
do -PRON- not know that there be another magnetic pole 
the other be simply a focus of magnetic power and be the one that attract the needle of the mariner compass ah yes murmur prebble 
that pole be locate in seventyone north and ninetysix west 
-PRON- be the source of -PRON- suboyd power resume -PRON- lordship 
there be another screened box under foot inclose a cube of soft iron 
if -PRON- wish to travel due south or in any direction east or west by south the cube of zellin be scr eene entlrely and the cube of iron be switch forward on a movable arm 
the ratio of power in the suboyd cube be the same as in the oyd bldck how beautifully nature have care for -PRON- in this delightful country chirrup the professor 
beyond the ice wall -PRON- know nothmg of the oyd or suboyd power 
the force that attract -PRON- cube of soft iron be barely sufficient to sway -PRON- magnetlc needle 
how do -PRON- explain the difference in the power of -PRON- country and ours donot explain -PRON- say lord nylis 
-PRON- be one of inscrutable law 
-PRON- be travel swiftly over awellpave road 
the breath of june be in the air green grove and flowerstrewn meadow stretch on both side of -PRON- and as -PRON- journey i catch glimpse of strangelooke house half hide by the tree 
the people -PRON- pass or who come down to the roadway to look at -PRON- be all of a kind with the man and woman -PRON- have already see albeit of low station 
but i see none of -PRON- at work 
the country blossom as the rise yet no yellowhaired laborer be in the field 
i ask lord nylis about this 
-PRON- labor with the mind not with the hand -PRON- reply 
what the oyd and suboyd force can not accomplish the chur take care of 
-PRON- brain be overwhelm with all this riot of new sensation and unheurdof condition and i have be drop into a country as different from -PRON- own as -PRON- mind could conceive 
there be a thousand and one question want to ask but -PRON- very multitude appal and silence -PRON- 
i think of the pole and in spite of the savage chur i determine to reach -PRON- just as soon as i have familiarize -PRON- somewhat with the way of the country and could plan intelligently 
certainly if i could not get to the pole griffyn would not be able to do so 
from the pole -PRON- thought wndgre to the princess yima 
-PRON- lovely face be before -PRON- the rich cadence of -PRON- voice in -PRON- ear 
ah if fortune would be kind to -PRON- 
tl could win -PRON- and carry -PRON- back to -PRON- own country and -PRON- own come to -PRON- with a guilty start 
what crazy notion have take possession of -PRON- thag i should raise -PRON- eye to a princess of the blood 
i try to banish -PRON- from -PRON- thought but -PRON- entrance feature and dulcet voice would nof allow -PRON- to be ignore 
i recall the smile -PRON- give -PRON- and then i recall -PRON- miss mukluk and turn toward -PRON- two companion 
prebble be just ask for a test of speedhe want to see how fast the oyd car could run 
full power klimon 
say lord nylis 
the chur open the screen to -PRON- full extent and the carriage leap away like a bullet from a gun clung to the professor and the professor clung to -PRON- 
house people tree pass so swiftly that -PRON- dance on the sight in blur line 
finally -PRON- slow down by degree and come to a halt in front of -PRON- lordship palace 
thank heaven 
i exclaim 
hurrah for the oyd power cry the professor beside -PRON- 
the most wonderful power on earth -PRON- be the making of the kingdom remark lord nylis as -PRON- descend 
follow -PRON- gentleman this palace as be fitting be much small and less ornate than the one -PRON- have just quit 
still -PRON- be a gem in -PRON- way 
on a terrace amid flower and shrubbery and splashing fountain -PRON- recline at length on couch spread with downy robe of fur 
the heat be such that the shade of the terrace be most refreshing 
if i have have a cigar or a pipe i would have be in a seventh heaven 
lord nyli have make -PRON- as comfortable as -PRON- could in the circumstance excuse -PRON- for a space 
prebble peer at -PRON- as one in a daze 
-PRON- start to speak then check -PRON- as though -PRON- dare not trust -PRON- wonder to word 
out with -PRON- professor say i languidly 
what problem be bother -PRON- just now one problem captain but ahundre problem sigh prebble all atsea over this astounding adventure 
frozen fancy 
i laugh dream itall still on the ice cap in the sleep bag hope not i hope not -PRON- mumble 
all these experience with thing new and before untried be too interesting to be pase with any explanation of that sort 
of all the remarkable object -PRON- have so far behold -PRON- remove the glitter circlet from -PRON- browseasily carry off the palm 
i wonder norw and -PRON- frown as -PRON- wit begin work if -PRON- think in an alien language as well as talk in -PRON- 
do this ring exercise a power over -PRON- intellect to such an unheardof degree be too pleasant an hour to be disturb with riddle past -PRON- solving i break in 
suppose -PRON- consider a mistake -PRON- have madea mistake into which i be lead by -PRON- 
-PRON- lift -PRON- brow 
what mistake -PRON- inquire 
when the anchor pick -PRON- oft the ice cap i explain -PRON- assert that -PRON- be carry -PRON- south and that the balloon be come out of the north 
that seem a proper inference captain before -PRON- be inform of -PRON- proximity to the pole while in the throne room 
even at this moment be incline to take the information impart by that hooknose gentleman with a grain of salt 
however in a country of so many wonder perhaps -PRON- be not well to doubt anything 
if griffyn have come irom the north i go on there be another proper inference that -PRON- have come from the pole perhaps have discover -PRON- 
prebble replace the ring and nod to signify that -PRON- be follow -PRON- 
-PRON- have now proofk i continue that griffyn be go north when -PRON- snatch -PRON- off the ice cap -PRON- both tacitly realize and acknowledge that error in -PRON- audience with the king say the professor 
-PRON- chuckle 
the ruler of this delightful country tell -PRON- that two fiend be to drop out of the sky and bring trouble 
-PRON- very brilliantly inform -PRON- majesty that the fiend be none other than griffyn and -PRON- companion in the balloon 
admirable 
that be indeed a happy inspiration if griffyn and -PRON- friend will only come down and let -PRON- be discover i fancy the king will have confidence in -PRON- assertion 
that captain will mean continued safety for -PRON- 
but i return suppose the balloon come down among the chur 
that take -PRON- would prove a coup de grdce for the englishman hope -PRON- wonot happen say be -PRON- relent toward griffyn query prebble somewhat surprised canot find -PRON- in -PRON- heart i answer to wish -PRON- ill to that extent 
think of the spear which -PRON- so narrowly escape and i shudder have a welldefine impression observe prebble after a little reflection that -PRON- shall presently be put to -PRON- to look after -PRON- so -PRON- may just as well cease worry about the fate that be to overtake griffyn 
aye be -PRON- answer -PRON- have buy -PRON- life at the price of a flask of bourbon 
no good can come of such a transaction and i feel moody and apprehensive have be expect applause from -PRON- on the score of that flask of bourbon say prebble a little hurt 
-PRON- turn a point concern griffyn and -PRON- fellow voyager be the expect fiend and i shake hand with -PRON- anderwell gloat 
now -PRON- rebuke -PRON- ifor turn a point with the whisky 
not at all i hasten to answer 
-PRON- save -PRON- life and i appreciate -PRON- resourcefulness even though i overlook the selfish manner in which -PRON- stow away thatflask while -PRON- be on the ice cap 
a flask and a revolver 
i know nothing about these -PRON- friend 
each have do -PRON- part in preserve -PRON- captain 
the end therefore have justify the meaun 
let -PRON- pass 
the oyd and suboyd power be much in -PRON- mind here -PRON- have subtle force fully control and make to perform the will of man 
the people of this land have invent -PRON- selve into that blissfulstate where labor be unnecessary 
by sheer force of the intellect -PRON- conquer and hold in subjection the chur and make the hairy savage do menial service 
the life of the ruling race seem to be a life of enjoyment 
which be not and can never be a successful life i declare 
the dignity of labor be need to round out the life of this rule race 
if this situation have continue for any length of time then something be due to happen 
captain agree prebble -PRON- be probably correct 
but after -PRON- wear struggle with the ice a period of idleness afford a most refreshing prospect 
i nod 
but say prebble grow disputatious although the ruler of this land do not work with -PRON- hand let -PRON- not suppose that -PRON- be idle 
-PRON- mind must be busy 
and such mind 
the mental effort necessary to keep the enslave chur under subjection must be enormous 
at that moment lord nyli return and seat -PRON- on a couch beside -PRON- 
what be the name of this country -PRON- lordship i ask 
-PRON- call -PRON- nyll -PRON- answer 
and what be the name of the reign house 
boazar 
boazar be now on the throne 
have -PRON- many child 
i be slowly work up to the subject that be become as dear to -PRON- heart as the discovery of the pole 
one only the princess ylma 
-PRON- lordship voice sadden as -PRON- add with a gloomy shake of the head poor princess ylma 
i rouse to inquire why the princess yima should be the object of -PRON- commiseration when prebble break in ahead of -PRON- with a question on an altogether different matter 
whence come this heat lord nylis 
-PRON- have the sun here for six at a time but -PRON- do no furnish sufficient caloric fora climate like this 
the friction of the earth in -PRON- rotation around the pole generate the heat -PRON- lordship explain 
but the pole be figurative demur the professor 
the earth can cause no friction in turn around a figurative axis 
the axis be not figurative 
the pole i5 a real one 
of course -PRON- be say what do -PRON- think look for prebble 
-PRON- turn -PRON- head and blink at -PRON- through -PRON- glass learn thing captain sali say -PRON- that no two man outside of nyll ever learn before 
-PRON- press one hand to -PRON- temple 
merciful power -PRON- head be split 
this be morning isnot -PRON- lord nylis yes reply -PRON- lordship the morning of the long day 
when do -PRON- dine inquire prebble moisten -PRON- lip with -PRON- tongue and think no doubt of the good thing -PRON- have have at the palace of king boazar 
in two week and three day say lord nylis 
i be startle 
prebble nearly fall off -PRON- couch 
-PRON- lordship notice -PRON- astonishment and add -PRON- eat but three time daily -PRON- custom in -PRON- own country i comment 
but -PRON- day be six month long 
i groan 
and -PRON- eat only once in two month ask 
three month intervene between breakfast and dinner and dinner and supper 
-PRON- sleep throughout the long nmight not a canot hibernate say preb ble rear up on -PRON- elbow and look at -PRON- 
captain let go home 
although -PRON- frame be meager and show no result of high living i yet know that prebble be fond of -PRON- meal and something of an epicure 
home 
i exclaim invent the fly machine professor and navigate -PRON- -PRON- do donot talk about home waste -PRON- time 
there there -PRON- friend put in lord nyli smilingly -PRON- shall not expect -PRON- to abide by -PRON- custom in this respect 
eat when -PRON- feel like -PRON- sleep when -PRON- wish 
-PRON- shall have the run of the larder and untrammeled use of the dormitory 
the king order gentleman humble roof be yours 
many thank -PRON- lordship say prebble -PRON- again be a man of science but -PRON- stomach be -PRON- weak point believe that even by the way what do -PRON- drink in this glorious land water 
nothing but water -PRON- have nothing else find water sufficient now i a glass ofof prebble be forget -PRON- 
have there be any alcoholic beverage in the kingdom that flask of bourbon would have be no novelty to the king 
a glitter come into the eye of -PRON- host and -PRON- rest a keen glance on -PRON- friend suppose say -PRON- that -PRON- elixir of life be the common beverage in the land from which -PRON- come prebble coughed 
tt be not so plentiftil as to be what -PRON- may call common lord nyli say -PRON- 
not -PRON- go on hastily that there be a scarcity of -PRON- 
on the contrary -PRON- be to be find nearly everywhere but -PRON- be for the select few who be able -PRON- quibble be carry -PRON- into deep place 
-PRON- be a subject moreover which make -PRON- uneasy 
i attempt to shift the topic should like to know something more about this princess ylma lord nyli i remark with assumed carelessness 
-PRON- affect not to hear -PRON- 
-PRON- -PRON- go on study the professor attentively must surely be of the select few who be able to obtain the elixir 
why yes reply prebble 
as need manifest -PRON- i have have -PRON- share of the potent fluid 
i be a scientist however and know where to draw the line 
now -PRON- go on with abrupt eagerness about this oyd force -PRON- be clearly as distrustful of the matter lord nyli be press as i be also -PRON- be seek to give another turn to the conversation 
-PRON- lordship however be not to be shake 
-PRON- cling to the subject relentlessly 
as i covertly watch the eye of -PRON- host an uncanny conviction that -PRON- be probe deep than -PRON- tongue lay hold of -PRON- 
what unplumbe depth lie at the back of -PRON- lordship penetrate glance 
-PRON- inform the king lord nyli interrupt prebble to remark that -PRON- and -PRON- friend be very great prophet in -PRON- own land 
the professor make a heroic effort to at ease and to meet the issue plausibly 
exactly so -PRON- return 
-PRON- own prophetic line be scientific 
the captain on the other hand be explore 
whenever -PRON- go explore -PRON- take -PRON- along to furnish fact and figure to work out various problem to the elixir -PRON- claim be a ptoof of -PRON- skill 
i wish in -PRON- soul that something may happen to draw -PRON- lordship off 
-PRON- be payingl out more than enough rope to entangle prebble and to trip -PRON- the less that elixir be discuss the well -PRON- would be for -PRON- 
quite true assert prebble with a panicky look in -PRON- direction 
then score lord nylis if -PRON- be a prophet if the elixir be a product of -PRON- skill and -PRON- know -PRON- virtue and make use of -PRON- why have -PRON- not renew -PRON- own youth 
prebble be silent 
-PRON- show -PRON- good sense by not plunge into some farfetched explanation that would give -PRON- lordship a chance to score again 
and lord nyli turn to meis youth not a condition in much demand in -PRON- own country 
be grow old so agreeable to those who live in -PRON- native land 
the professor answer for -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- be even more afraid to trust -PRON- than -PRON- be to trust -PRON- 
gray hair command respect say -PRON- and that be what -PRON- prophet demand more than youththe respect bear of gray hair and wisdom 
this remark appear to please lord nylis 
the professor have touch -PRON- intellectual side where -PRON- be strong 
-PRON- seem then say -PRON- that -PRON- countryman particularly -PRON- prophet reverence knowledge far more than -PRON- desire youth 
that be the case -PRON- lordship 
then why do -PRON- give such a proof of -PRON- skill to -PRON- people 
if -PRON- be wise to grow old in year and wisdom even though -PRON- must die for -PRON- why cater to folly with a beverage which keep people young all man do not think the same on a subject so broad as that cough the professor no doubt wish -PRON- have leave -PRON- lordship to talk with -PRON- -PRON- elixir have a most remarkable effect upon the king be assure of that before i give -PRON- to -PRON- -PRON- royal will be completely overturn 
the elixir be warrant to overturn the will of any one royal or otherwise 
a troubled look as i think cross -PRON- lordship countenance 
-PRON- must be exceedingly powerful -PRON- exclaim hesitate to describe the elixir full power to -PRON- lord nyli 
possibfy -PRON- would not believe -PRON- 
i be glad the professor hesitate 
the princess ylma i venture save -PRON- from the chur 
naturally -PRON- lordship i should be glad to learn something about the young lady 
the professor and i be deeply indebted to -PRON- and pardon -PRON- lord nyli interrupt but the marvelous power of -PRON- elixir have quite captivate -PRON- fancy 
and yet -PRON- frown a little as -PRON- speak have a premonition that -PRON- be not well for the people of this kingdom to renew -PRON- youth by mean of -PRON- elixir 
i feel -PRON- friend that i must go deeper into this subject 
-PRON- be new and at this juncture there be an interruption 
i draw a deep breath of satisfaction although certainly i should not have feel such profound relief have i know at the moment all that the interruption portend 
suddenly there come to -PRON- ear a loud shout from the direction of the road 
-PRON- spring up in time to see a large oyd car with a dozen armed chur and one nyllite sweep up to the palace step 
the instant the car stop the warrior and the man in charge of -PRON- leap to the ground and rush up to the terrace 
in another instant prebble and i be surround 
seize -PRON- command the nyllite who be captain of the king guard 
six spear point prick -PRON- breast and six pair of ferocious bloodshot eye glare into -PRON- the professor be also at bay in a precisely similar manner 
count zylox what mean this demand the indignant lord nyli confront the captain of the guard 
the king be die cry the count excitedly 
die echo -PRON- lordship aghast 
aye and through the madchination of these foreign devil 
woe woe to this land lord nylis 
at this very instant king boazar be stretch out on the dais at the foot of the throne chair roll -PRON- eye gasp and chokingly endeavor to give -PRON- final order 
what do -PRON- say query -PRON- hortified lordship 
-PRON- can not understand -PRON- pitiful attempt at speech resfonde the tearful captain of the guard 
whash mazzer -PRON- sound like mazzer whash mazzer over and over agam ah this be a sorry day for -PRON- beloved country 
-PRON- good king 
the last of the boazar 
-PRON- whirl furiously upon the chur who be thxeatemng prebble and -PRON- 
bind the foreign devil -PRON- shriek 
-PRON- life shall pay for this and a poor enough forfeit -PRON- be 
out of the fry pan into the fire be a homely expression but -PRON- describe a situation which seem to fit -PRON- case 
the king be in no danger but have use -PRON- elixir too freely 
yet how to convince count zylox of this before -PRON- be draw and quarter 
that be the question vou ever think in -PRON- life captain sali think now cry the professor brush the sweat from -PRON- forehead with a fold of -PRON- tunic 
cord cord shout count zylox 
dind -PRON- 
lord nyli i exclaim -PRON- appeal to -PRON- 
the king be in no danger 
i swear -PRON- 
danger repeat the captain of the guard 
-PRON- lie like a log i tell -PRON- and -PRON- end be near 
not so clamor the professor 
that be the way the elixir work 
do -PRON- not see -PRON- swallow -PRON- 
and -PRON- friend there 
if -PRON- have be poison -PRON- -PRON- would be dead or die 
look out -PRON- relic of the stone age -PRON- be stick -PRON- brush aside a spear point that be make -PRON- too keenly feel 
what -PRON- say be true i aver 
in a few hour the king will be -PRON- again will not believe -PRON- be the fierce response of count zylox 
rather than bother with bind -PRON- -PRON- would perhaps be as well for -PRON- to run -PRON- through not that speak up lord nylis 
the king have place these gentleman in -PRON- charge and i be responsible for -PRON- with -PRON- head 
but the king be pass 
-PRON- gentleman say not 
i yield up -PRON- guest only on the king order count zylox king be incapable of give order 
-PRON- will issue -PRON- when -PRON- be capable 
what if -PRON- die 
in that event i take -PRON- command from princess ylma 
count zylox be an exceedingly angry man 
-PRON- stamp about the terrace in -PRON- buskin 
-PRON- hospitality have take a rathet grim turn count observe -PRON- lordship must request that -PRON- have -PRON- chur lower -PRON- weapon 
and permit these foreign devil to escape cry the exasperate count 
by no means 
guard -PRON- until -PRON- have further news of the king 
the count gnaw -PRON- under lip for a moment 
then -PRON- say -PRON- will tarry three hour 
by that time a courier from the palace will let -PRON- know whether the king live or be dead 
if -PRON- live -PRON- wish will be bring by the courier say lord nyli and shall be implicitly obey 
and if -PRON- die 
if -PRON- die these foreigner shall suffer death by oyd well say the count and give order that cause the chur to withdraw and marshal -PRON- in a column behind prebble and -PRON- 
i sit down on -PRON- couch and prebble sit down on -PRON- 
this constant peril be most try to the nerve for -PRON- never seem ableto tell when the lightning be go to strike or how 
this death by oyd murmur prebble what be -PRON- -PRON- lordship 
if the king die and the princess ylma so command as -PRON- undoubtedly will in that event -PRON- foot will be securely bind to thefeetof -PRON- friend 
a block of zellin properly screen will be chain to -PRON- wrist and a be chain to the wrist of -PRON- 
the screen will then be by degree 
-PRON- will be pull north -PRON- friend south 
first a force equivalent to six man will drag at -PRON- limb pull against each other then twelve man then eighteen then the full twentyfour 
-PRON- be awful to contempate the very fiendishness of -PRON- fairly sicken -PRON- 
-PRON- be the punishment for high treason comment the count glower at -PRON- 
wait six hour instead of three implore prebble three heur only snap the count 
how slowly the minute drag 
surround and guard to make sure that -PRON- do not escape prebble and i endeavor to compose -PRON- nerve be afraid of something like this professor say -PRON- would be rather a humorous situation say prebble if these nyllite werenot so ignorant 
what a sight for godsand man to see king boazar prone upon the throne surround by -PRON- griefstricken court and only give vent to hiccup and gurgle and the two mysterious word whash mazzer the professor forget -PRON- own desperate situation so far as to cackle with suppress merriment liable to be anything but a laugh matter for -PRON- and -PRON- prebble i admonish -PRON- 
how can there be a tragedy 
the king will come out of -PRON- trance and word will be send to release -PRON- 
suppose the court doctor get busy with the king 
-PRON- donot understand what ail -PRON- and -PRON- may resort to heroic measure 
-PRON- may suecumb to th measure but the clixir will be charge up with -PRON- and of course -PRON- be already charge up with the elixir 
prebble look worried something in that captain -PRON- fal tere wish -PRON- could get word to those doctor to keep -PRON- hand off 
what good would -PRON- do -PRON- to get word to -PRON- 
i inquire 
do -PRON- think -PRON- would pay any attention to -PRON- wish in the matter one way or the other 
possibly not 
certainly not not a doubt as to the position -PRON- occupy in the land of nyll 
let -PRON- suppose say the professor that the king case be not aggravate by the solicitude of -PRON- physician 
qur danger will pass in that event 
very likely provide these troublesome chur be not goad into something violent by zylox 
the captain of the guard be still tramp fretfully up and down itch to be at and yet not dare to override the instruction of the king count be in a hard row of stump i go on to prebble give -PRON- eye to see -PRON- impale on the poing of those spear but if the king should recover the count would be call on to pay with -PRON- head for -PRON- rash action 
and lord nyli too add prebble 
an execution by oyd -PRON- proceed -PRON- thought take a gruesome trend must be a particularly horrible performance 
-PRON- have the electric chair beat both way say slowly but relentlessly a victim be pull to piece 
a sicken pallor spread -PRON- over the professor face 
sit upright on -PRON- couch -PRON- shade -PRON- eye with one hand and look off along the road that lead to the palace wonder why some one doesnot come from the king -PRON- worry 
no one will come until the king either die or recover sufciently to tell -PRON- court that -PRON- have no intention of die i answer 
lord nyli observe that some of the chur be becbme rather overzealous in -PRON- guard duty place -PRON- closer to prebble and -PRON- 
a single look which -PRON- throw at the hairy warrior dampen -PRON- vengeful ardor and -PRON- draw back 
this condition of -PRON- majesty remark -PRON- lordship turn to prebble seem an odd way of renew youth 
and yet -PRON- declare that the elixir work in that manner -PRON- majesty take too much of -PRON- say prebble 
too much be dangerous not at all 
too much merely stupefie 
so the king be out of -PRON- sense 
nothing bad have befall -PRON- lord nyli i assure -PRON- 
be there many court physician dozen or more 
do -PRON- suppose the whole dozen of -PRON- be work over the king 
undoubtedly 
prebble could not restrain a groan dozen doctor captain say -PRON- turn in -PRON- direction apt to cause tragic complicatlon the doctor just then be a prolific source of danger for the professor andme and second only to the doctor stand count zylox and the chur guard 
the physician will do everything possible speak up lord nyli hope no doubt to set -PRON- at -PRON- ease 
could -PRON- not send word to the physician return prebble that all the king need be to be let alone physician i presume do not understand the king malady say nyli but certainly -PRON- can do no harm 
send word anyhow implore prebble 
tell the messenger to annournce at the palace that the stranger guarantee the king recovery but that the physician must not mix up in the matter 
if i do that and the king do not recover say lord nyli should be condemn to death -PRON- 
there be no use insist and the minute continue to drag 
-PRON- seem as though i have live an age before -PRON- eye eagerly scan the road see a small oyd car come fly to -PRON- lordships step 
one chur and one nyllite be the passenger 
bound to the ground the nyllite dash up the slope toward -PRON- flash the king ring in -PRON- hand come from princess cry the courier 
why the princess ylma 
i ask -PRON- 
if the king be not dead why be the princess ylma assume the prerogative of government 
what of the king demand the count 
-PRON- recover tell -PRON- so jubilate the professor 
be -PRON- well ask the count 
bar a headache 
the lord in wait be attend -PRON- 
what say the princess ylmar that under no circumstance be the stranger to be injure 
i begin to breathe once more 
prebble be again -PRON- cocksure and assertive self 
the count come forward and i think -PRON- look like a man 
-PRON- bow to -PRON- humbly 
pardon the disagreeable interruption say -PRON- 
when i come again -PRON- will be by -PRON- majestys command 
-PRON- give order to -PRON- chur and -PRON- defile toward -PRON- oyd car 
the messenger have already return to -PRON- and be race back whence -PRON- come presently the large car get in motion and -PRON- be leave alone with -PRON- genial host as before 
prebble settle -PRON- comfortably on -PRON- couch continue to delve for fact 
regard these chur say -PRON- be -PRON- animal pure and simple -PRON- lordship whether or not -PRON- have soul reply -PRON- lordship be a moot point 
-PRON- have a certain amount of reason but be so brutelike that only -PRON- superior mind hold -PRON- in check 
a commission of -PRON- wise man appoint by the king be now make experiment to discover whether the chur be imbue with the immortal gpark 
-PRON- be all slave 
every one outside the great wall 
if -PRON- be not hold down with a will of iron -PRON- would rebel and seek to overthrow -PRON- 
fear alone keep the horde of chur back of the great wall 
if -PRON- once lose this fear -PRON- would swarm over the wall and lie this kingdom in ashe 
wall query the professor scent another mystery 
boazar of illustrious memory encircle the land of the chur with a great wall of granite 
since then -PRON- mind have develop in power to an extent that give -PRON- no fear of -PRON- traditional enemy 
the only disaster that could befall -PRON- would be a dethronement of reason an eclipse of -PRON- faculty 
this would vive the chur -PRON- opportunity here -PRON- lordship straighten proudly -PRON- brain continue to improve while the chur continue to sink into barbarism and brutality 
some day -PRON- shall grow so strong that -PRON- can invade the country of the chur enslave -PRON- all and after that gradually train -PRON- and so well -PRON- condition 
-PRON- be the dream of boazar one day to emancipate the slave 
but this will not come for many generation not until such an act be entirely safe 
-PRON- speak of the chur as traditional cnemie -PRON- be here when lokai the bold break throuch the ice wall and settle the land an event which take place in the night of prehistoric time 
then the chur roam through the sun of the long day and through the blackness of the long night fighting rend each other like beast 
lokai war with -PRON- and drive -PRON- out with sword and spear 
but sword and spear be useless against -PRON- 
-PRON- multiply amazingly and return again and again to the attack 
only the irresistible power of the brain be efficacious and not until the descendant of lokai begin to develop and use these latent power be there any peace in the land 
this be glorious murmur the professor 
-PRON- be an ideal statea kingdom of the mind with the power of darkness under heel 
but here a poiht -PRON- ancestor lokai the bold penetrate the ice wall 
have -PRON- people never try to reach the world whence -PRON- come 
expedition after expedition have try but in all save one instance without success 
the cultivation of mental power have ill prepare -PRON- to cope with the rigor of ice and cold 
brute endurance be need there 
nevertheless in -PRON- own generation the ice have be successfully conquer by one gneiseti 
-PRON- do not live to return butsent back a gort plate tie to an eagle leg 
the gorr plate tell -PRON- thing of the outside world that have entirely wipe out all desire to know more about -PRON- 
gorr plate exclaim prebble deeper -PRON- go the thick the mystery 
what in the name of all that s good be a gorr plate 
-PRON- be a square of chalcedony a thought record 
-PRON- wish to communicate with one another so -PRON- send thought and impression not word 
on the chalcedony square -PRON- place -PRON- hand -PRON- think the thought record -PRON- in the plate 
the plate be send to the one -PRON- would have know -PRON- wish or experience and -PRON- or -PRON- layshand on the plate and the thought of the communicant come to the brain 
prebble jump to -PRON- foot and walk around -PRON- couch 
then -PRON- sit down again -PRON- head in -PRON- hand 
have -PRON- one of these gorr plate in -PRON- pocket -PRON- inquire 
lord nyli smile 
no but if i have -PRON- would be nothing but so much chalcedony to -PRON- 
-PRON- mindpardon mei not cultivate along the proper line 
at thls imply doubt of -PRON- mentallty prebble bristle up 
the next moment however the irritation pass 
will -PRON- read this gorr plate send home by gneisen -PRON- ask 
tt js in the archive of the king palace 
but i have the gist of -PRON- in -PRON- mind 
what be thought 
horrible 
-PRON- recordeei impression of two thing in particular that fill -PRON- with disgust and despair for the human race 
one of these thing be a thin silver disk with a womans head on one side and an eagle on the other 
there be also a motto in god -PRON- trust 
the desire to accumulate these fetich be so strong that people do not hesitate to betray a trust barter -PRON- honor and sometimes -PRON- life for the insensateobject there be those who have million more of these than -PRON- need and other who have not one 
-PRON- be a mad race accordmg to gneisen and many of the weak be crush trample on and slain 
the professor look at -PRON- and indulge in a sly wink 
-PRON- lordship be on ground familiar to -PRON- but neither prebble nor i have anything to say 
what be the other thing that fill -PRON- with disgust and despair lord nyli query the professor 
-PRON- be a brown fluid in glass receptacle go on -PRON- lordship fluid be even more insatiable in devour honor and life than be the silver disk 
-PRON- strike at the mind with sledgehammer blow accord to gneisen make rave beast of sensible man and finally bring horrible death 
the wonder be that sensible man would have anything to do with -PRON- 
do -PRON- know anything about this fluid believe i have hear of -PRON- mumble the professor 
talk about gorr plate be -PRON- possible to prebble thus deftly shift the topic 
the gorr platesi be wonderful enough but i be not particularly interested in -PRON- at that moment 
-PRON- fancy fly to princess ylma 
young beautiful only child of the reign kingwhat could there be in such a fate to commend the piin8ess to -PRON- lordship commiseration 
i resolve to find out 
at that moment lord nyli be deep in an earnest discussion with prebble and while wait for a chance to put in a word on -PRON- own account i fall asleep 
how long i sleep be of no importance 
the period seem brief but -PRON- may have be hour in duration i waken abruptly and start to a sit posture 
-PRON- lordship be go but on the couch near mine lie prebble count zylox stand over -PRON- 
behind the count be the same detachment of soldier that have accompany -PRON- on -PRON- previous visit 
the professor be just open -PRON- eye 
-PRON- here again -PRON- exclaim start up and cast a quick glance at the forbidding face of the chur 
by the king express command answer the count 
how be -PRON- royal highness inquire prebble 
-PRON- be feel much well and desire that -PRON- refill this flask forthwith 
the captain draw the bottle from the breast of -PRON- tunic and extend -PRON- toward prebble 
-PRON- majesty must have more of -PRON- elixir within the hour 
blockhead that -PRON- be 
why have -PRON- not foreseen this contingency 
still if -PRON- have foresee -PRON- what could -PRON- have do to save -PRON- 
-PRON- be possible -PRON- could have steal an oyd car give the zellin cube free reign and thus reach the pole 
would -PRON- have better -PRON- condition by so do 
may not the savage chur have kill -PRON- out of hand 
there be no time to waste in useless surmise 
count zylox represent the king and the king mean business 
mercy on -PRON- man gurgle the proiessor 
do -PRON- think i carry a supply of the elixir around with -PRON- and have -PRON- constantly on tap 
the count smile sardonically think nothing at all 
the king command that i bring -PRON- the elixir within the hour 
if -PRON- refuse to comply with -PRON- reasonable demand i be to convey -PRON- into the serene presence the point of a spear 
as to which i do i be indifferent 
zlox have educate -PRON- head at the expense of -PRON- heart 
-PRON- have no kindly feel for -PRON- and order be order old prebble 
i see -PRON- now as i see -PRON- then clasp -PRON- bony hand shake as with an aue look despairingly from the count to the file of chur 
suddenly -PRON- sink back on the couch with a muffled groan -PRON- stony cye uptdrned to the cloudless vault overhead 
where be lord nylis 
i strike in think -PRON- host may devise some way out of the difficulty 
nyli can be of no assistance to -PRON- return the officer frigidly 
be i to have the elixir or be i not must consult privately with the other prophet -PRON- companion say prebble be a matter of some moment 
have i -PRON- permission to engage -PRON- friend in a brief conversation escape be impossible warn count zylox sternly 
lam a0 t contemplate anything of that sort 
very well 
proceed with -PRON- conversation 
the professor get up come over to -PRON- couch and sit down beside -PRON- 
captain say -PRON- be -PRON- asleep or do -PRON- wake up in time to hear what be go on overheard -PRON- all i reply 
well what be -PRON- to do in this case not a thing -PRON- can do so far as i can discover 
the king have send an ultimatum more elixir or death to the stranger 
-PRON- be a mistake to tell the king that the bourbon be a product of -PRON- skill presume reflect prebble that the whisky could be distil but -PRON- would take time 
and the king be in a hurry get to fill the flask at once or suffer the consequence 
then -PRON- must suffer the consequence say i chieerlessly 
the professor problem be grow more and more difficult of solution 
largely -PRON- present predicament be owe to the professor extravagant claim with respect to -PRON- power as prophet 
a prophet be not really a wizard and yet -PRON- learned companion in -PRON- conference with the king have rather imply that such be the case while count zylox watch warily from a distance and the barbarian of -PRON- guard stand ready to discorage any attempt at escape the professor pucker up -PRON- brow and turn the matter over in -PRON- mind 
-PRON- may as well give up prebble say harass -PRON- with further posing 
-PRON- canot conjure a demijohn of rum out of the air 
tell zylox to do -PRON- bad 
if -PRON- could secure another audience with the king return prebble -PRON- may be able to do something that would postpone -PRON- fate deceive -PRON- 
the king be thoroughly in earnest 
when an appetite for bourbon be arouse -PRON- know how difficult -PRON- be to combat -PRON- donone well 
the imperial appetite wait only upon the imperial will and the king word be law 
but captain perhaps if i tell -PRON- majesty that a little time would be require to minister to -PRON- desire -PRON- would grant a stay of sentence that would only prolong the agony say and what s the use 
while there s life there s hope 
so long as -PRON- can keep from be spit on the lance of the chur or from be draw and quarter by oyd and suboyd i choose to believe that chance of ultimate escape will favor -PRON- 
that may be 
i be as anxious to live as -PRON- be prebble for the object of -PRON- lifelong ambition have be to attain the pole 
now that -PRON- be so near the pole -PRON- seem too bad that chance and a flask of bourbon should conspire to disappoint -PRON- 
suppose -PRON- could escape now murmur the professor with a wary glance at zylox and the churssuch a supposition be folly 
i protest 
no one know what a man can do to save -PRON- life until -PRON- be put to the test 
a rush an exchange of blow and a little of that fortune which favor the brave and the desperate may carry -PRON- to the road and the oyd car 
then away captainaway with the screen tear from the cube of zellin and -PRON- speed an eagle flight 
i stare at -PRON- in amazement 
if -PRON- own action in seek to escape from the throne room have be reckless and illconsidere present suggestion be even more so 
-PRON- be out of -PRON- wit prebble say in the first place -PRON- could never get clear of this press of chur alive 
take that for grant at the outset grant -PRON- this captain that -PRON- be a forlorn hope but well that than nohope at all 
-PRON- be not even a forlorn hope go onseverely 
suppose -PRON- reach the car therewould remain the operating of -PRON- 
what do -PRON- know about that 
-PRON- know what lord ll tell -PRON- on the way here answer the professor confidently 
all one have to do in drive an ovd car be to lift the screen and steer 
admit that -PRON- could escape from the guard and reach and successfully operate the car where be -PRON- to go 
anywhere 
safety lie in flight sali and where that flight take -PRON- be not a particular point 
yes -PRON- ismost particular 
if -PRON- could get to the pole and fall into the hand of the chur 
not that well i shall not join -PRON- in any such mad enterprise 
if argument canot save -PRON- force certainly can not 
-PRON- get up and go back to -PRON- own couch 
fling -PRON- down on -PRON- back -PRON- fix -PRON- eye thoughtfully upon the zenith 
see that -PRON- interview have terminate the impatient zylox approach the professor 
have -PRON- decide the count demand be wait to be move in the business mumble the professor 
time press return zylox ask -PRON- be i to have the elixir or be i not 
-PRON- be screech prebble hurl -PRON- to -PRON- foot tell the king i be a great prophet and -PRON- shall see i be not without honor even in this country 
obsrv 
watch 
i shall work a spell to fulfill the king desire 
ah ha 
room there 
give -PRON- room 
-PRON- zave -PRON- room plenty of -PRON- 
i fear that danger have suddenly turn the professor brain and that -PRON- have go stark staring mad 
-PRON- whoop -PRON- howl -PRON- throw -PRON- inte the most amazing attitude and fan the air with -PRON- arm 
i look on horrified 
count zylox gaze at the contortion of -PRON- learned friend in startled wonder 
as for the chur -PRON- superstitious mind be imagine dire thing and -PRON- seem more than half inclined to run 
suddenly the air above -PRON- be rent with a terrific explosion 
simultaneously with the explo sion the heavens be light by a flash of reddish fire ghastly in the broad light of day 
every eye turn aloft 
a blaze balloon be drop earthward like a lead plummet and follow the airy track of the balloon at slow pace and with hairfaising gyration be parachute two man be cling to theparachute recognize one of -PRON- as -PRON- rival griffyn the other as pollock -PRON- secretary and companion 
the burn balloon drop into the roadway the wickerwork car load with food scientific instrument and other impedimenta strike the ground with a prodigious thump 
griffyn and -PRON- companion alight a moment later on the terrace and not more than a dozen foot from prebble 
the englishman be stun by the shock and lie on the ground in a state of dazed bewilderment 
without loss of a second prebble bound to griffyn bent over -PRON- search -PRON- pocket and arise triumphantly with a nickel plate flask 
turn upon the astourtde captain of the guard prebble present the flask with a low bow 
the elixir be not in the same flask count say -PRON- but i do not think -PRON- majesty will be overparticular 
-PRON- give -PRON- great pleasure to comply with -PRON- majestys command 
prebble be not mad on the contrary -PRON- wasj very levellleaded 
but what would -PRON- have do if there have be no flask in the pocket of either griffyn or -PRON- secretary 
the professor afterward tell -PRON- that in fall backward on the couch the despair gaze -PRON- turn upward have encounter the balioon 
the airship be in difficulty plunge wildly and make ready to fall 
griftyn and pollock be even then take to the void with theirparachute 
idea come rapidly continue prebble for be between the chur and the deep sea so to speak and -PRON- life as well as mine hang in the balance 
chance be that either griffyn or pollock have a flask and those be the chance i have to take 
a special providence watch over child andand other captain and i get the flask 
i think count zylox be deeply impressed 
at any rate -PRON- hand tremble as -PRON- take the flask from prebble 
the chur be flat on the ground face downward 
-PRON- be -PRON- customary attitude when anything occur which to -PRON- be supernatural 
before the count entirely recover or the chur arise griffyn be on -PRON- foot and have advance to where i be stand 
-PRON- face be vacuous -PRON- eye stare know -PRON- but -PRON- be one thing to cut a man from -PRON- balloon and launch -PRON- into eternity and another thing to meet -PRON- again front to front 
finally -PRON- speak but there be no sense to -PRON- word 
i answer -PRON- and that -PRON- fail to understand -PRON- be evident from the blank lvok -PRON- wear haf be wrong 
have i forget -PRON- mother tongue 
remove the talk ring captain suggest prebble give -PRON- english and -PRON- be give -PRON- nyll 
i remove the talk ring 
while wear -PRON- i think in nyll talk in -PRON- and -PRON- own language be a dead letter 
captain sali breathe griffyn 
captain sali can i belive -PRON- eye 
-PRON- cast a brother mariner adrift in nudheaven say i cuttingly 
no wonder -PRON- be surprised to meet -PRON- again alive and hearty 
-PRON- take a base advantage of -PRON- -PRON- protest warmly 
-PRON- attach yeurselve to the drag anchor in the hope of reach the pole neck and neck with -PRON- 
rubbish explode a sane man griffyn and -PRON- do not really think that prebble and i would do such a thing and run the risk of have -PRON- life batter out against the top of some iceberg 
-PRON- mutter in -PRON- beard 
at last -PRON- observe -PRON- have be hover over this country for hour drive back and forth by one current and then another 
the intense heat or something else burst -PRON- balloon and the have no interest in -PRON- misadventure say i coldly 
-PRON- cut -PRON- adrift and -PRON- be save by a miracle only to find -PRON- in the midst of a sea of danger 
-PRON- will be youlr business to share some of these danger with -PRON- 
pollock come up just then burst with question 
but pollock be the kind of man i leave out of -PRON- calculation 
-PRON- be the son of a rich distiller i have be inform and -PRON- father have help -PRON- to a place in expedition by subscribe twenty thousand pound to the exploration fund 
count zylox and prebble be hold an animate conversation and i don -PRON- talk ring to take part in -PRON- 
these be the two fiend speak of in that tradition of your count the wily professor be say 
take -PRON- back with -PRON- to the king keep -PRON- in confinement and watch -PRON- well 
tt shall be do the count answer cheerfully 
-PRON- be show a good deal of respect for -PRON- since the professor have work -PRON- spell 
tell the king i put in that -PRON- request -PRON- not to deal with the prisoner in a summary manner 
prebble throw a surprised look at -PRON- 
-PRON- could not understand i suppose why i wish to spare the englishman when -PRON- have show no disposition to spare -PRON- will carry -PRON- message to the king say count zylox 
thereupon -PRON- order the chur to make prisoner of griffyn and pollock but the englishman set -PRON- shoulder together and prepare to resist 
i have never doubt courage so i be not surprlse to find -PRON- show -PRON- tooth -PRON- begin to jook call the count to -PRON- as though these stranger would have to be roughly deal with 
would -PRON- care to speak with -PRON- and give -PRON- a little good advice know of no way in which -PRON- could serve -PRON- better will see what i can do say i 
then remove the mystical ring from iy brow i step up in front of griffyn and pollock be rash griffyn i advise -PRON- be outnumber and -PRON- have just come through a severe shake up 
by jove -PRON- cry brandish -PRON- fist if these swab be sicken for something well do -PRON- good to oblige -PRON- 
what sort of a way be this to receive stranger be tactful and -PRON- will find these people hospitable and kind 
resort to violence and -PRON- will let loose a storm that will break on -PRON- own head know because i have have some experience with the way of the country 
what sort of a country be -PRON- 
really magnificentand something of a paradox 
the inhabitant be wel advanced in the art and science and the labor of the ruling race be entirely on the mental order 
i havenot be here long enough to make any detailed explanation but i can assure -PRON- that a resort to fisticufl will not prosper vour cause 
what have -PRON- in -PRON- hand there -PRON- ask survey the object curiously 
an example of the scientific progress -PRON- have find in this country i answer 
this be a talk ring and talk ring -PRON- echo wideeye 
precisely 
by adjust -PRON- properly be able to think in the language of the people and to talk to -PRON- and to understand -PRON- 
what bally nonsense be -PRON- give -PRON- be try to tell -PRON- thing which -PRON- incredulity will not allow -PRON- to believe say but for all that i be speak the truth 
-PRON- be put in the professor but -PRON- be waste -PRON- time 
count zylox in charge of the guard be go to take -PRON- and pollock alive or dead to the king of the country 
sali out of a generous feeling toward -PRON- which be not warrant by -PRON- past behavior have volunteer to pursuade -PRON- to go with the count without resistance 
if -PRON- be wise griffyn -PRON- will heed the advice of captain sali 
salis have something at the back of -PRON- head declare griffyn suspiciously 
what be -PRON- up to -PRON- fling at -PRON- pointblank 
justify although i may be in act and think otherwise i answer do not wish to see any harm come to -PRON- griffyn 
-PRON- be try to beat -PRON- out in come at the pole 
something tell -PRON- that -PRON- be play the game even now 
where do -PRON- think -PRON- be griffyn 
i inquire 
in what latitude and longitude havenot be able to take an observation for some time and i havenot the least idea say -PRON- 
-PRON- will discover all about that and many other thing of interest to -PRON- if -PRON- go peacefully with count zylox not -PRON- cry obstinately 
here -PRON- add reach out -PRON- hand let -PRON- take -PRON- talk ring 
if -PRON- be all -PRON- say give this count a piece of -PRON- mind in short order 
prebble look at -PRON- and shake -PRON- head mean to signify that -PRON- would not be safe just then to make -PRON- possible for griffyn to converse understandingly with count zylox 
griffyn may do other thing besides give the count a piece of -PRON- mind 
for instance -PRON- would have be possible for -PRON- to give information that would be a detriment to prebble and -PRON- 
i shall not allow -PRON- to sample the power of -PRON- talk ring i answer 
do -PRON- know what -PRON- impression be ask griffyn donot know as that matter materially but -PRON- may as well tell -PRON- 
-PRON- and prebble be mad 
as pollock and i come down onthe parachute -PRON- see prebble throw -PRON- about in a crazy sort of way 
why do -PRON- rob -PRON- of -PRON- flask 
why do -PRON- hand -PRON- over to that fellow in the mother hubbard a black business afoot sali if -PRON- turn out that -PRON- and -PRON- friend be not mad 
will -PRON- go peaceably 
i ask to cut the conference short 
-PRON- be go to fight to the last breath -PRON- aver 
i put on the talk ring and step back 
-PRON- wonot listen to reason count zylox say take -PRON- but do -PRON- carefully 
again the count order -PRON- chur to make prisoner of griffyn and pollock 
although -PRON- resist like true driton -PRON- be easily overcome and bear away 
zylox would also have carry off the wreek of the balloon have not prebble vigorously object 
i could not imagine what prebble want with the remain of the airship 
in du urse however -PRON- idea be communicate to -PRON- and i find -PRON- particularly bright 
the departure of zylox and th guard with the prisoner leave prebble and -PRON- alone and to -PRON- own device 
during these momentous event lord nyli have not show -PRON- 
nor have any one issue from the palace to make inquiry or to take part in the proceeding 
the hour be ripe for something of moment to transpire and i be not keep long in suspense 
now captain say prebble after a swift precautionary glance around -PRON- -PRON- must get to work without loss of time 
at what sort of work 
i inquire 
-PRON- will find out presently 
-PRON- must act first and then do -PRON- talk 
-PRON- gather up -PRON- tunic about -PRON- thin leg and put off down the terrace toward the road 
i hurry along in -PRON- wake and ome -PRON- beside the wickerwork balloon car 
nothing remain of the basket but a jumble of broken reed 
there be a water can knocked into a cocked hat and trickle -PRON- content over the road also a number of scientific instrument a shotgun and cartridze lelt and a bag contain pemmican and ship biscuit 
the scientific instrument be ruin but the bag of food be in good condition and the gun and ammunition appear to be uninjure 
bring the biscuit and pemmican captain say prebble take possession of the firearm and belt stow these away where -PRON- can find -PRON- when want and then hold a council of war 
the article be hide in a clump of bush and -PRON- return to -PRON- couch on the terrace 
prebble be rub -PRON- hand delightedly count on find the food say -PRON- but the shotgun and the ammunition be a stroke of luck 
just what -PRON- need too think of make a run for -PRON- be -PRON- 
i ask -PRON- return look around apprehensively 
come over to -PRON- couch -PRON- sit down beside -PRON- nothing else for -PRON- captain -PRON- proceed am of -PRON- opinion i return 
-PRON- position here be become untenable -PRON- resume 
the king will want more of the elixir and if -PRON- be not forthcome -PRON- will be impale on the same spear and convey into the royal presence 
-PRON- may have reason that out before say think -PRON- but -PRON- need time in which to recuperate after -PRON- long fast and to adjust -PRON- to certain of the country 
food and rest have prepare -PRON- physically and now that -PRON- be acquaint with the mechanism of the oyd car and be possess of a shotgun and a bag of food -PRON- be well equipped for flight 
-PRON- must have the car 
car be plentiful 
-PRON- will lie in wait along the road then with the aid of the shotgun -PRON- can take possession of the first car that come along 
after that away to the south en route for home 
to the south i exclaim 
certalnly -PRON- canot go astray captain 
the cube of iron will draw -PRON- along the proper road 
-PRON- will make in the direction of least resistance 
good heaven 
i rie -PRON- think the oyd car will carry -PRON- over the ice wall and the open sea how do -PRON- know there be an open sea as for the ice wall que transtulii sustinet 
-PRON- good star be above -PRON- 
south -PRON- must goit be the only way 
-PRON- be not the only way 
i declare 
-PRON- hope lie in the zellin cube and -PRON- must go whither -PRON- take -PRON- 
to the land of the chur -PRON- dear sir palpitate prebble 
-PRON- would be slaughter on sight 
have -PRON- not have sufficient experience with these man brute 
remember how superstitious the chur be i urge 
the report of that revolver be enough to vanquish -PRON- and now -PRON- have a shotgun 
think of that read -PRON- captain say the professor disgruntle 
griffyn have arrive 
-PRON- fear that -PRON- will reach the pole first impel -PRON- to take any chance however desperate 
i go south sir 
and i go north 
i return firmly 
-PRON- will divide the pemmican and the ship hiscuit 
and the shotgun -PRON- ask coolly 
-PRON- will draw straw for the shotgun 
-PRON- can get -PRON- own oyd car and i will -PRON- can not quarrel over this matter interrupt prebble nor can -PRON- divide -PRON- slender force and resource in the face of such a desperate contingency 
-PRON- must stand or falt together captain sali be in charge of the expedition say i sternly 
when -PRON- join -PRON- -PRON- agree to obey order 
-PRON- be quite correct -PRON- answer be overlook that point be resolve to bear away to the land of the chur 
that be what -PRON- shall do 
-PRON- be under -PRON- order and -PRON- will obey whatever hist 
-PRON- lordship 
i look up hastily 
lord nyli be approach -PRON- across the terrace 
klimon in the road below be sit in the point of -PRON- lordship conveyance gentleman begin lord nylis -PRON- face trouble the fame of -PRON- elixir have spread throughout the kingdom 
to the lord in wait -PRON- majesty have describe -PRON- effect upon the system so eloquently that all be wild to try the new fluid for -PRON- 
the second flask the king claim as -PRON- own to the last drop 
but -PRON- order -PRON- through -PRON- to work another spell for one thousand keese of the elixir 
if not too much trouble to -PRON- -PRON- desire that -PRON- have -PRON- fall at the palace step 
menial be already wait there with goblet 
-PRON- heart smote wildly against -PRON- rib 
have -PRON- be too late with -PRON- pilan for flight 
how much be a keese -PRON- lordship 
prebble inquire with a businesslike air two blick make one keese 
a blick i should say be about the quantity contain in the second flask 
in other word say prebble briskly the king want two thousand flask of -PRON- elixir rain down in front of -PRON- palace 
the menial arewaite -PRON- lordship repeat and the king household be impatient 
-PRON- shall have to repair to the king palace to make the incantation say prebble 
while speak -PRON- telegraph -PRON- a message with -PRON- if -PRON- flee -PRON- must be now or never 
whether north or south make little difference 
the thing be to get away before the household grow too impatient imagine as much remark -PRON- lordship gravely 
if -PRON- gentleman will descend to the oyd car will retire into the palace for ten minute or less and rejoin -PRON- the moment i have finish the business that detain -PRON- 
this be important or i should not delay 
nothing could have be more opportune 
-PRON- lordship go one way and prebble and i the other 
the bag of food and the gun mutter prebble 
-PRON- must have those before -PRON- go to the oyd car 
proceed to the clump of bush -PRON- bring out the article 
as the executive end of the expedition i assume charge of the gun and belt strap the latter over -PRON- tunic about -PRON- waist 
next -PRON- steal silently upon the oyd car 
approach the unconscious klimon from the rear i tumble -PRON- incontinently into the road and jump into -PRON- seat 
prebble be already up behind 
with the shotgun firmly hold between -PRON- knee i bend over the power box and lift the screen 
away jump the car with a suddenness that almost throw the professor into the road 
and not an instant too soon 
the dazed klimon have bound to -PRON- foot and grab at the rear of the vehicle miss -PRON- by no more than a hairbreadth 
-PRON- pursue -PRON- but -PRON- may as well have try to overtake a whirlwind 
-PRON- be head for the land of the chur and for the north pole 
all fear be lose in the excitement of the moment 
-PRON- nerve be not so prey upon that reason fail -PRON- and while bend over the zellin box one hand on the screen and the other on the steering lever i have a few thought pertinent to the situation 
when -PRON- have leave the king palace klimon have use the zellin cube 
that mean of course that -PRON- have proceed in a northerly direction 
to use the suboyd power as represent by the iron block would have be to drive back through the heart of the kingdom 
flight in that direction mean undoubted capture 
another pomnt i be not sufficiently familiar with oyd car to distinguish the iron box from the zellin box 
-PRON- lordship car however have just come from the king palace 
the zellin cube must have be use and therefor -PRON- be reasonable to infer that this cube be still ready for duty 
i do not pull out the screen to -PRON- full extent and thus give the car the full power 
-PRON- could easily distance klimon with half the oyd force and i want to accustom -PRON- to run the machine before urge -PRON- to -PRON- utmost 
the car be easily handle 
the rear wheel be the rudder and -PRON- resistance be strong in move any way short of due north 
the feel of the tiller if i may be allow the expression be an indication of the direction -PRON- be go 
as i figure -PRON- -PRON- be head north by east 
suddenly i be startle out of -PRON- reflection 
directly ahead and bear down on -PRON- be the official oyd car contain count zylox and the detachment of the guard 
a groan come from prebble after -PRON- captain be the burden of -PRON- lament 
i be of the same opinion 
but there be no retreat for -PRON- and -PRON- must go ahead and look pleasant 
keep a stiff upper lip prebble i call over -PRON- shoulder wave -PRON- hand and laugh as -PRON- pass the count think be out for a little spin just for the fun of the thing 
-PRON- may think be bind for the palace say the professor revive 
-PRON- wonot think that be go directly away from the palace 
then -PRON- canot be come from the palace can -PRON- 
no but -PRON- may be after -PRON- all the same there 
now hail -PRON- laugh and be hearty about -PRON- 
the count have slow down -PRON- car and be watch -PRON- with surprise and suspicion 
ahoy there count 
i yell as -PRON- speed by 
how be i for a navigator anyway prebble give a laugh but there be not much heartiness in if 
where be -PRON- go shout the count 
yes roar back at -PRON- to understand draw out the screen a little farther could not look behind and manage the car so i ask prebble what the count be do keep right on return the professor 
great colossus -PRON- sputter aghast 
what now 
i demand 
klimon dash along the road captain meet the count of course 
tell -PRON- whether the count stop to talk with the chur prebble 
lopk alive now right in front of the official car salis 
the count have get to halt or run over the chur wave -PRON- hand 
well i dare not take -PRON- attention from -PRON- work to look behind but have to depend on the professor to keep -PRON- informed of what be go on 
-PRON- shall soon be push to the last extremity captain cry prebble 
-PRON- ought to be use to that by this time i answer grimly 
the count have stop -PRON- car and be talk with klimon mean pursuit by a highpowered car a car that can walk upon -PRON- hand over fist klimon fling -PRON- into the official car go on prebble and there be nothing else for couldnot resist look back 
the official car be just turn to head toward -PRON- as i fling the look over -PRON- shoulder 
at that moment -PRON- speed over an uneven place in the road 
i lurch wildly and be throw down on the zellin box 
one of -PRON- hand be on the slide screen and as i drop forward the screen be push home abruptly shut off the power of the cube and bring -PRON- to a slow pace so abruptly that prebble already wabble because of the thankyoumaam go by the board precipitately 
i have a fleeting glimpse of -PRON- stand on -PRON- head heel in the air 
abandon the professor be farth fromi -PRON- mind and i jam down on the brake and bring the car to a standstill 
prebble 
i yell 
-PRON- be lie sprawl out on the earth a dozen foot behind 
as ill luck would have -PRON- -PRON- be silent and inert and apparently have meet with injury which may prove serious 
in the distance approach swiftly be the other car moment be precious but i leap from the seat and be about to start for prebble when -PRON- suddenly sit up 
come on 
i shout 
hurry 
although daze -PRON- be not long in pick up the trend of event 
-PRON- see the car with -PRON- laad of warlike chur and scramble to -PRON- foot with mere haste than grace 
merciful power -PRON- stutter 
-PRON- have almost gain the car when -PRON- whirl and turn back 
what be -PRON- try to do 
i roar 
just at that moment i see -PRON- bend and pick up the glitter circlet 
the talk ring have drop from -PRON- head during -PRON- fall and -PRON- have go back after -PRON- couldnot understand -PRON- -PRON- pant as -PRON- scramble to -PRON- place in -PRON- wait vehicle 
if be the count and be -PRON- then never mind that 
i cut in 
hang on prebble for be go to start on the hih speed 
very good captain 
the more peed the well 
i jerk the screen half through the slot and -PRON- shoot ahead like an arrow from a bow 
the machine be wrench in every part and i fear for a second that -PRON- would be rive to piece 
happily -PRON- fear be without foundation 
the car hold togetherand -PRON- fly onward like the wind a poor navigator captain call the professor 
this be -PRON- first experience withthis kind of a ship i call back to -PRON- 
what do -PRON- do 
try to look behind 
while i be about -PRON- the machine strike a high place in the road and the power be shut off 
-PRON- grunt a wonder i do not break -PRON- neck captain say -PRON- be stun for an instant 
when i sit up i hear -PRON- call but couldinot understand what -PRON- say 
the sight of that other car be enough though to remind -PRON- of what be go forward lose time when -PRON- have no time to lose 
-PRON- be under the heel of fortune and must put up with whatever come 
-PRON- should have shoot klimon 
have -PRON- do that -PRON- may have escape without have the official car take after -PRON- 
deal in such murderous fashion with even a chur be not in -PRON- 
nevertheless i could see now how -PRON- may have be well for -PRON- to put klimon out of the way 
watch the car behind professor 
i caution watch go on the chur be get ready to use -PRON- dpear 
what the professor have saidabout use the shotgun on klimon have give -PRON- an idea 
i be bide only the proper moment to put -PRON- into execution make short work of -PRON- captain shrill the professor if -PRON- overhaul -PRON- small doubt of that return letween -PRON- tooth can see the count eye flame like live coal 
this race be offer -PRON- a chance to even up old score 
and hell improve the opportunity if -PRON- can gain gaining whoop prebble -PRON- be useless for -PRON- to attempt to escape from the official car 
-PRON- have a threefoot cube of zellin equivalent to a draw power of seventytwa man 
-PRON- machine on the contrary be equip with only a block 
even allow for the add bulk and heavy load of the count car -PRON- be greatly outclass 
i open the screen to -PRON- wide and at time -PRON- seem hardly to touch the road so fast do -PRON- go 
be -PRON- hold -PRON- own prebble 
i cry still gain -PRON- answer 
there come a spear where do -PRON- strike 
ten foot behind -PRON- 
half a minute pass 
another spear chatter prebble six foot behind 
i mutter an exclamation 
the count have gain four foot in thirty second and something wotld have to be do at once prebble i shout come here and run the car canot -PRON- exclaim 
yes -PRON- can -PRON- will have to what be -PRON- go to do 
never mind 
time be too precious to waste tatk 
on hand and knee -PRON- creep to the forward point of the car and slip into the driver seat as i vacate -PRON- steer a boat 
i ask -PRON- lip to -PRON- ear 
-PRON- nod steer in the same way 
keep a firm grip on the helm or -PRON- will get a broken rib 
with this warning i creep back to the middle seat the shotgun in -PRON- hand 
the official car look like a sailless junk load to the gunwale with pirate 
shield and spear bristle in the sun and out of the center of the phalanx gleam the white face of count zylox gloomy and ominous 
stop -PRON- cry fiercely 
i pay no attention to the word but rivet -PRON- eye on the front of the official car 
two chur sit in the point one manage the steering lever and the other the screen 
at -PRON- foot between -PRON- be the large box hold the zellin cube 
a quick thought plunge through -PRON- brain 
i hesitate but a moment and then kneel on the broad seat i throw up the breech of thegun there be a cartridge each barrel 
throw the piece to -PRON- shoulder i take a long and careful aim at the zellin box 
a spear clove the air narrowly miss -PRON- head 
that be -PRON- signal to pull the trigger 
bang 
the recoil wrench -PRON- shoulder and nearly throw -PRON- from the seat 
when the smoke lift i see that i have work havoc enough 
that single charge have tear away the front and side of the zellin box cause trouble with the steering gear and prick the shin of the chur in the point the driver and the helmsman scare out of -PRON- wit have hurl -PRON- into the road 
the rest of -PRON- red companion follow -PRON- and flatten out along the ground leave only count zylox in the car 
what contortion that wonderful machine go through 
jerk ahead by a force as of seventytwo chur the broken helm thrashing in all divection -PRON- zigzag here and there jump aloft with wheel whir and finally crash into a tree at the roadside and lie a complete wreck count zylox i be glad to note have hurl -PRON- from the car before the final catastrophe and be suffer from nothing more than a few a a wail from the professor call -PRON- attention from the scene behind go -PRON- go go the screen cover 
i draw -PRON- from the box to get the entire force of the cube and the tiller jam sideways and knock -PRON- out of -PRON- hand 
i be angry for this carelessness of the professor be like to cost -PRON- dear -PRON- be not pursue -PRON- be true but -PRON- car be run away with -PRON- 
the only power -PRON- have over -PRON- be to guide -PRON- a little to right and leave 
-PRON- could not stop or diminish the speed 
-PRON- gait be that of the empire state express and the track before -PRON- have suddenly widen into all outdoors 
where -PRON- have leave the road i do not know but -PRON- be race across a broad plain hot sandy level as a floor 
there be no house no tree no rocksnothe to impede -PRON- progicss 
this be well consider -PRON- limited ability in handle the oyd car peer ahecad 
in ilie distance there rise from the earih a cloud like haze funnelshaped and resemble the swirl vortex of a cyclone 
what be -PRON- 
i have no time to debate the question even have i be so disposed 
the wall 
the wall shriek prebble 
yes there be the great wall build to hem in the chur 
-PRON- stretch across the plain as far as the eye could see and appear to encircle the column of smoke or dust or whatever -PRON- be 
as -PRON- charge toward -PRON- and -PRON- come plainer and plainer into view i conclude that -PRON- must be at least thirty foot in height of solid masonry pierce with one brazen gate toward which -PRON- be head 
the gate twenty foot wide and twenty high look forbid enough but well a colliston with that than with the granite wall 
port -PRON- helm prebble 
i shout 
port 
as -PRON- move the tiller i see a score of the red fiend silhouette on top of the wall 
-PRON- be look at -PRON- whoop dancing and beat -PRON- spear against -PRON- shield 
prebble begzin a paternostr but i cut -PRON- short with the remain barrel of the shotgun fire into the air 
the chur melt from the wall as if by magic 
-PRON- see 
i shout triumphantly 
this gun be go to do the business for -PRON- prebble 
that wall be go to do the business -PRON- fling back head for the gate 
i answer 
do -PRON- think -PRON- can smash open the gate and ride through the land of the chur straight to the pole -PRON- retort grimly 
make -PRON- peace with heaven sali be a smashup in less than a minute get to jump say as calmly as possible 
well to jump than have -PRON- life batter out against the gate 
while speak i throw out the bag of pemmican and ship biscuit 
the bag strike the ground spring twenty foot into the air and fall again in a shower of sand 
and -PRON- have get to go through that cry the professor not be a whole bone leave in -PRON- body 
jump 
i shout 
follow -PRON- 
out i go shotgun in hand 
when i come down i must have turn a dozen somersault 
the gun leave -PRON- hand and the talk re -PRON- head 
i rip -PRON- toga to rag and would have lose -PRON- utterly have not the cartridge belt hold -PRON- remnant about -PRON- waist 
after a second or two i realize that i be sit on the sand watch a figure fly upward from the point of the oyd car squirm through the air drop and ricochet along the ground halting at last a mere heap of humanity in a wrecked tunic 
be the professor dead or alive 
as i pick -PRON- up painfully to go forward and investigate a crashing sound reach -PRON- from the gate 
look toward that point i note with wonder that the barrier have not withstand the impact of the zellin cube 
the gate be ajar various piece of the oyd car pile in the opening 
prebble be on -PRON- foot before i reach -PRON- -PRON- still wear -PRON- buskin and be frantically engage in tie the remain of the tunic about -PRON- waist 
yes -PRON- cry angrily -PRON- would come north captain 
reason circumstance evervthe point south 
but no -PRON- would go north or nowhere 
and now look at -PRON- 
-PRON- pick up -PRON- talk ring and jam -PRON- down on -PRON- head 
-PRON- say something else but as -PRON- be talk nyll and i be listen in english the sense of -PRON- be lose upon -PRON- 
-PRON- be clear to -PRON- that -PRON- be not very seriously hurt and i go back for -PRON- own talk ring and the gun the professor be sorely out of patience with everybody and everything 
-PRON- have have two fall from the oyd car and the first one alone would have sour -PRON- temper but for the excitement attend the pursuit 
this second fall be far more dangerous and annoying than the first and i could not blame -PRON- for display some rancor to become of -PRON- sali the professo demand survey -PRON- as though -PRON- consider -PRON- salvation -PRON- part of the work cantell -PRON- better about that in a few minate i answer dizzy in brain and weak in the leg 
the only way i could hold -PRON- upright be by jeane on the shotgun 
if -PRON- isnot one thing -PRON- two scowl prebble 
how be -PRON- to get out of this wish i know 
-PRON- strike -PRON- though that the farther -PRON- can get away from that smash gate the well -PRON- will be for -PRON- 
come on prebble 
i reel to an about face and begin stagger off along the wall 
prebble shout an angry protest and i turn to discover that -PRON- have piumpe -PRON- down in the sand 
how do -PRON- think i can move -PRON- groan joint in -PRON- body be unhinge 
look where i light and -PRON- point to a gougedout spot in the earth 
no man could hit the ground like that without be half kill 
if -PRON- linger here until the chur come out say finish the job willing -PRON- declare resignedly have quantum sufficit 
be flesh and blood and not whalebone and india rubber -PRON- body tell -PRON- when i have bear hardship to the limit of endurance 
if -PRON- be bind to go on sali good by 
-PRON- be impossible for -PRON- to accompany -PRON- 
buck up answer wish i could but i canot 
here let -PRON- help -PRON- decline to be interfere with to stay righthere so that the chur can have a good chance at -PRON- 
why be -PRON- hang back 
why donot -PRON- show -PRON- 
i look toward the break gate 
the oyd car be heap fantastically in the middle of -PRON- but there be no sign of chur te be see 
the roar of the gun have frighten -PRON- i explain 
-PRON- couldnot frighten all the chur but only those who be on the wall 
where be the rest not theorize about the rest the present situation that concern -PRON- 
remember what happen at the lake when that revolver be fire 
those who hear the report drop pronc on -PRON- face but those who didnot hear the report refuse to be awe by the description the other cave of -PRON- 
there il be a smother of the hairy demon ail around -PRON- before long 
somie messenzer have revive and go after -PRON- 
the professor voice be hopeful appear to be honestly glad that -PRON- misadventurc be soon to be terminate 
-PRON- voice be strong and robust 
from that i gather that -PRON- be not so severely injure as -PRON- be try to make -PRON- believe 
let -PRON- lift -PRON- to -PRON- lcet professor i suggest and then i can support -PRON- while -PRON- make -PRON- escape 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- dblankly 
escape -PRON- echo 
why do -PRON- talk about such a thing 
where be -PRON- to escape to 
be there any haven of refuge in all this region for -PRON- and -PRON- 
if -PRON- go back the nyllite will catch -PRON- if -PRON- go forward then -PRON- fall into the hand of the chur not a spot in all this henighte country wherewe can call -PRON- safe 
-PRON- should have go south in the direction of the ice wall 
i see that i must reason with -PRON- companion and get -PRON- back into a normal state of mind 
tl adfnit professor say that -PRON- situation seem hopeless but have -PRON- not seem equally hopeless several time before this 
and havenot -PRON- always manage to slip through the gather danger get to be a first time captain when -PRON- fail to slip through -PRON- answer shake -PRON- head forebodingly 
personally i think -PRON- have come to that time have hope i go on take another tack that -PRON- would live to give to the world -PRON- proof regard the meteoric theory of the aurora 
possibly there be more glory in that for -PRON- than for -PRON- in discover the pole what i dislike about this chur business say -PRON- a flash 9f pride cross -PRON- dusty face proof -PRON- add fondly which scientific man can not dodge have to delieve -PRON- 
i intend to write a book that will place -PRON- name high on the scroll of fame 
-PRON- get up quite briskly while -PRON- be talk be absolutely certain that -PRON- word be the very last on this meteoric theory of the aurora 
from that ipse dixit there be no escape 
right -PRON- be 
i cry enthusiastically 
suppose -PRON- stroll off along the wall and see what -PRON- can discover 
-PRON- lean on -PRON- for a space while -PRON- adjust -PRON- glass ought to feel grateful to -PRON- captain -PRON- maunder for give -PRON- the chance to settle a question which have bother scientific mind for year 
i be grateful believe -PRON- 
how be -PRON- fele 
i ask solicitously 
well 
i be not so much of a wreck as have imagine 
there be no fracture naturally -PRON- dignitjr have suffer somewhat but -PRON- voice trail off into silence for just at that moment an army of chur have begin fairly to boil out of the gate in the wall 
these be not the one who have hear the terrifying report of the shotgun and drop from the wall a short time before but other undaunte and eager to fall upon -PRON- 
with fierce yell and spear clash against shield -PRON- literally swarm in -PRON- direction 
quick pant prebble 
the gunthe gun 
i throw up the breech and the empty shell be automatically eject 
then i pluck from the belt one of the few cartridge that have remain in -PRON- after -PRON- tumble from the car 
i press the shell to the breech 
the next moment -PRON- be possible i swear for i be a sailor and the provocation be great 
what falter prebble whisperingly what now 
i look at -PRON- with dilate eye 
these shell i reply hoarsely be too large 
i canot get -PRON- into the gun 
griffyn must have have two shotgunswe get the belt that go with the other weapoh 
the professor toss -PRON- arm and fall to the ground 
i stoe over -PRON- the muzzle of the gun in -PRON- hand sweep a circle about -PRON- with the stock 
i forget how many of those rabid chur i mow down with the clubbed firearm can only remember that -PRON- be take tie together with thong and drive beyond the great wall spear point prick -PRON- at every step 
prebble and 
i have be on tenterhook ever since -PRON- arrival in this circumpolar region but -PRON- have not face a more desperate situation than the one that now confront -PRON- 
personally i would not have give a copper cent for -PRON- chance 
-PRON- learned companion as be so often the case with -PRON- be lose in contemplation of -PRON- strange surrounding to the exclusion of the animal instinct of fear 
-PRON- mind be grapple with scientific datum and be therefore too busy to consider -PRON- peril here i hear -PRON- mutter -PRON- see the human faculty emerge through -PRON- chrysalis of brutality primordial obscure but very pronounce nevertheless 
how these head and these face would delight a lombroso 
there be no other savage in the world like these 
if i could abduct one of the creature and take -PRON- back to -PRON- own country what a stir would be cause the scientific world 
unless i be greatly mistaken professor i observe dryly -PRON- will have a splendid chance to study these interesting savage at close quarter hope so i do indeed -PRON- answer absently and be off again with -PRON- mumbling 
how do -PRON- live 
what do -PRON- eat 
be -PRON- monogamous 
do -PRON- have village 
that prognathous visage predicate cruelty and determination 
ah very absorbing very donot see anything in the nature of till field professor say -PRON- lift -PRON- bowed head and become suddenly aware that be march at -PRON- side 
no captain -PRON- return in an attempt to be sociable these savage be not agricultural 
in one way or another most savage be find to take a certain toll from mother earth and i presume that these chur must raise something in the nature of food even though none of -PRON- field be in evidence 
the art of the husbandman be very primitive in origin 
adnuration fill -PRON- face as -PRON- bend -PRON- gaze on a tall savage march just ahead of -PRON- 
what perfect physical development -PRON- exclaim can see little in these hairy scoundrel say i testily but vast power for evil -PRON- be mere brutesat the bottoin of the scale while the nyllite be at the top 
the nyllite symbolize the mind even as these chur be symbolical of the matter remark prebble 
the brilliant mentality of the nyll kingdom reach here for -PRON- physicaljpower take -PRON- by sheer force of the will humble -PRON- and shape -PRON- to various use 
where could -PRON- happen upon a finer commientary on the power of mind over matter 
-PRON- be get in too deep for -PRON- professor say warrant -PRON- however that if these hur only realize -PRON- power -PRON- could overrun the kingdom of yil and lie -PRON- waste 
the professor shudder 
what a catastrophe that would be -PRON- murmur 
think of the gorgeous palace the beautiful garden the wondrous invention and discovery of nyl all lie under the strangle hand of these brute 
such a calamity be too monstrous captain 
-PRON- could never happen 
what cause the downfall of the roman enipire 
i ask 
luxury effiminacy too much wealth and power 
all the empire become drunk with prosperity 
and as a result the roman eagle have -PRON- neck wrung and be cast to the vulture 
be i right -PRON- very tersely captain 
nyll strike -PRON- as be much in the same way 
-PRON- throw -PRON- a startled look 
at time captain say -PRON- -PRON- uncover a rich vein of thought that strike into profound depth yes -PRON- be right 
nyll base -PRON- power upon faculty of the mind that have be most astonishingly deveope if anything be to becloud those power the whole kingdom would be pillage by these brute who be now confine wlthln the great wall 
the possibility be terrible to contemplate and -PRON- quite unnerve -PRON- 
but nyllite be not exact replica of the ancient roman 
although a land of idleness the other kingdom be not lap in sensuous ease 
-PRON- experience with the nyllite have not be pleasant yet -PRON- must grant -PRON- -PRON- due 
i know personally that labor of the mind be more exhausting than labor of the body 
the professor be intensely interested in -PRON- captor 
without the wall -PRON- have be willing to bide in hdpelessness while the chur sally forth and dispatch -PRON- but now -PRON- be in another mood 
-PRON- realize i suppose say i grimly that -PRON- be prisoner these rope that bind -PRON- arm at -PRON- back -PRON- reply serve to remind -PRON- of that fact captain 
do -PRON- also realize that -PRON- may be doom to death 
that be quite possible -PRON- return gravely but i hope -PRON- will spare -PRON- long enough so that i may make some inquiry regard -PRON- mode of life 
an examination into -PRON- tribal custom -PRON- language the limitation of -PRON- intellect and -PRON- way of war would be highly divert -PRON- be but a step above the beast of the forest and may prove to be the trye miss ing link that unite man to the low order of creation 
if -PRON- could take one of -PRON- back with -PRON- captain 
-PRON- have no visible mean for get -PRON- away to -PRON- own country i break in so let -PRON- say nothing of burden -PRON- return with savage like these 
-PRON- see that i be out of sympathy with -PRON- aspiration and i see plainly that -PRON- be in a trancelike condition where -PRON- scientific knowledge be wrestle with recondite enigma to the complete exclusion of -PRON- present unhappy state 
i watch the chur stride swiftly along and force -PRON- to hurry in -PRON- midst 
-PRON- face reflect a purpose which be ominous and arouse disagreeable thought of what be to happen to the professor and -PRON- 
there be nothing to be do however except to submit passively and face the end with fortitude 
something may happen to make the end more pleasant than the present situation promise 
i see no building nothing in the way of shelter even of the rude description 
there be no evidence of art and craft beyond the shield and the spear 
these be wellmade wepon of offense and defense but suggest nothing more than war and savagery 
i lis tene to the professor discourse to -PRON- the facial angle retreat from the prognathous jaw to the low forehead prove these chur to be bestial 
-PRON- be cruel merciless superstitiousprimitive child as yet untouche by the faint ray of real knowledge 
thus -PRON- mumble scarcely heed the spear that accelerate -PRON- lag pace 
i also take notice of many thing but only in a perfunctory and general way 
for instance in pass through the gate i judge the wall of masonry to betwenty foot in thickness i see that the land of the chur be ridge with rocky hill for the most part barren i feel the earth to be uncomfortably warm under -PRON- foot and when -PRON- wade a small stream the water be hot to -PRON- flesh 
in the distance that column of cloudlike vapor trail skyward bending and twisting at the crest and spread out so that the sun resemble a fiery ball a drift shroud 
on and on -PRON- walk until -PRON- turn into a defile among the gaunt rock 
spear strike shield in a ring clamor and presto the bowlder spew out a perfect mob of unkempt creature who run toward -PRON- some erect andsome on all four 
woman and child drone prebble very curious very 
evidently these creature be cave dweller possibly survivor of the stone age and as such -PRON- progenitor 
i should like -PRON- measurement on the bertillon system 
the woman and child survey -PRON- in awe 
the professor however claim most of -PRON- attention -PRON- eye be focus on -PRON- head and spectaclesthe spectacle and buskin be about all that remain to -PRON- of -PRON- former state -PRON- be goad into a vilesmelling hole in the rocky hillside and be make to sit down while -PRON- fect be pinion 
then perfectly helpless -PRON- be leave to -PRON- own device 
one of the tall that -PRON- stand head and shoulder above the restbarke out a series of order 
immediately the creature seattere woman and child with the rest and begin fetch armful of dry wood and throw -PRON- down in a heap 
while thiswas go forward other chur arrive 
two carry the shotgun across -PRON- spear in front of -PRON- not dare to touch -PRON- with -PRON- hand 
four with spear elevate have -PRON- bag of pemmican and ship biscuit on the spear point 
that also i suppose be a fetich and to be handle warily 
lastly come a train of grizzle warrior each with a lose cartridge on the flat of -PRON- spear head these be throw in a heap beside the gun and bag of food in for -PRON- i mutter gloomily -PRON- think so prebble monosyllabic -PRON- answer absently 
what 
i query 
-PRON- give a start 
-PRON- speech captain be of the onesyilablfc variety that be rudimentary 
now the ancient aryan belay 
i interrupt out of temper want none of -PRON- homily now 
-PRON- have plenty of food for thought of a different kind 
yes yes -PRON- answer eagerly should call -PRON- homonymous or rather i lurch against -PRON- and bring -PRON- out of -PRON- vagary 
eh -PRON- exclaim 
do -PRON- say something captain look out there 
i answer brutally 
lord nyli say these creature be cannibal and -PRON- appear to be collect wood a chain of reason to claim -PRON- immediate attention 
-PRON- think the professor grow pallid donot think i answer know 
-PRON- press -PRON- clawlike hand together bind as -PRON- be 
a at last the professor be completely en rapport with -PRON- desperate situation 
the world will lose -PRON- demonstration of the meteoric theory -PRON- cry bitterly and -PRON- sali be the cause 
outside the wall -PRON- offer hope 
hope 
and look at -PRON- now 
upon -PRON- head sir will fall the consequence guess be both in for the consequence i return 
by the mizzentruck of the great harry 
i add look toward the wood gatherer a nyllite prisoner ask prebble 
no -PRON- act as though -PRON- have some authority among -PRON- 
strange mutter -PRON- companion -PRON- eye on the man 
-PRON- wear the skin of a wild beast like the chur and there be not the same intelligenceshown in -PRON- face as in the face of other of -PRON- race 
here come the tallman -PRON- s a chief i suppose 
the leader of the pack make toward the cave follow by four other ready for -PRON- i take -PRON- say try to speak calmly beg -PRON- pardon captain say prebble 
for what 
for accuse -PRON- of lead -PRON- into this predicament 
-PRON- have just flash over -PRON- that -PRON- could not have go south i -PRON- have want too think -PRON- would come to -PRON- i answer 
-PRON- will meet -PRON- fate shoulder to shoulder -PRON- go on not death that terrify -PRON- what follow in this case 
i lay -PRON- bound hand against -PRON- which be as near a handshake as -PRON- could come 
-PRON- differ often prebble and for -PRON- be two of diverse nature vet never doubt -PRON- innate manhood nor do i think -PRON- ever doubt mme 
there be something incongruous in remark just make when compare with other remark remember by -PRON- of which -PRON- have relieve -PRON- while -PRON- be on the ice cap but i have yetto find a man who be at all fime perfectly consistent 
surely no scientific man can lay claim to such an honor 
through the opening of -PRON- cave -PRON- watch the tall man and the four other 
suddenly the tall man come to a halt group the four around begin a harangue 
the guttural voice be pitch so low that -PRON- could not distinguish anything except husky syllable and staccato pause between -PRON- 
-PRON- be devise way and mean i suppose say the professor 
omne supposition be as good as another i answer 
-PRON- all come to one thing in the end be a bad dream an exceedingly disagreeable dream 
-PRON- still cling to that fiotion do -PRON- 
why not if -PRON- please -PRON- 
all life -PRON- dear captain be a dream 
at least so -PRON- fancy run 
an immortal fall asleep in elysium and what -PRON- dream be a human life 
sometimes -PRON- dream be short and sometimes long sometimes -PRON- be sad and bitter and sometimes full of happiness and hope realize 
but the immortal wake whether -PRON- dream be bright or dull and again -PRON- discover -PRON- in elysium and -PRON- realize that -PRON- have be in elysium all the time 
with -PRON- eye on the gabbling chur i give rather deep attention to this odd conceit of i have never suspect that -PRON- have a vein of poetry in -PRON- makeup 
very pretty say and what be dbetter and more to the point there may be a little truth in -PRON- 
but elysium must be full of sleeper 
-PRON- mutter a few word under -PRON- breath and i fear -PRON- be tinker up another equation 
but no 
presently -PRON- lift -PRON- head remove -PRON- spectacle and begin clean -PRON- on a rag of -PRON- tunic 
at that moment the chief come on with -PRON- four chur and the professor come to a pause 
the chur chieftain unbound -PRON- ankle and motion to -PRON- to rise 
-PRON- obey and walk out among the ragged rabble that surround the pyre there -PRON- be cut asunder and the professor be lead aside and make to seat -PRON- on a bearskin 
after this the nyllite step in front of -PRON- 
-PRON- be from nyll -PRON- ask 
recentiy i answer 
where from originally 
there be no blackhaired man in nyll and no hairless man like the one yonder 
-PRON- turn and indicate prebble 
-PRON- come from beyond the ice wall 
who be -PRON- if i may inquire 
sertez i be call 
banish from nyll by king boazar on the morning of the long day 
banish -PRON- add acrimoniously because i dare to make love to the princess ylma 
-PRON- strike a note that make -PRON- hearstring vibgate 
i eye -PRON- keenly 
princess ylma would notreceive -PRON- advance i query 
no -PRON- answer be nothing 
-PRON- do not know -PRON- own mind 
apart from that however -PRON- be promise to a man -PRON- hate 
who 
to count zylox captain of the king guard at last i know why -PRON- lordship feel pity for princess ylma 
why will the king force -PRON- to marriage agajnsther will 
i proceed feign carelessness 
because zylox be head of the house of almik rival of the boazar 
on -PRON- death the king fear ylma will be set aside in favor of zylox and -PRON- wish to unite the two house 
sertez turn and shake -PRON- clench fist southward bide -PRON- time -PRON- hiss 
some day i shall lead a horde of chur into nyll and steal theprincess 
the next moment -PRON- shrug -PRON- shoulder and toss -PRON- hand deprecatingly 
but enough of this suppose -PRON- know the fate for which -PRON- be intend can imagine what -PRON- be to be 
have -PRON- any power among these people 
can -PRON- not persuade -PRON- to give over -PRON- horrible design 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- companion will be spare say -PRON- 
-PRON- be taboo among the chur because of -PRON- hairless head 
-PRON- can none of -PRON- understand the what -PRON- can not understand -PRON- believe to be supernatural 
i laugh bitterly at the inconsistency of the chur 
the professor would live 
-PRON- may never be able to return to -PRON- own country but -PRON- bald pate save -PRON- from thie disaster that threaten -PRON- 
i be near the shotgun the small heap of cartridge and the food bag 
-PRON- despondent eye fall upon -PRON- and i notice something small in -PRON- but of great importance just then 
the cartridge differ in size 
have there be two size of loaded shell in the belt 
and have in -PRON- haste at the great wall pluck out one of the large shell will ask -PRON- say i to the nyllite to take this cord from -PRON- wrist 
-PRON- can not escape say -PRON- 
therefore the less reason for -PRON- to hesitate in grant -PRON- request 
-PRON- remove the bond 
instantly i pick up the shotgun throw up the breech and try one of the small shell 
i tremble even now to think of that agonizing moment 
would -PRON- fit or have i try the small kind just without the wall 
the shell slide into the barrel and i snap the breech back into place 
glory shout prebble leap to -PRON- foot and wave frantically the bearskin on which -PRON- have be sit 
-PRON- perform a dance bizarre enough consider -PRON- regalia 
the chur think i be about to make some attempt at escape begin close in on -PRON- with savage cry and ferocious gesture 
i fire the single barrel into the air and stand quietly under the smoke wreath note the effect 
the result be all that i have dare to hope 
down go the chur even sertez sink to one knee 
silence follow disturb only by the gabbling old professor who not know -PRON- bald head have save -PRON- believe the gun have prove the salvation of both of -PRON- 
presently the chief get up on -PRON- hand and knee crawl to -PRON- foot and lift a handful of sand and throw -PRON- over -PRON- head 
then -PRON- rise and yelp at the rest of -PRON- hairy follower 
immediately a long line of the creature begin creep past -PRON- every one of -PRON- perform the same operation 
what be the meaning of this sertez -PRON- in quire 
as long as -PRON- remain on earth thunder maker return fulsomely -PRON- and -PRON- companionare the honor guest of the pack 
koz the chieftain tender -PRON- abject apology for the manner in which -PRON- have be treat 
those on the wall prior to the breaking of the gate aver stoutly that -PRON- be the thunder maker but koz would not believe 
now that -PRON- hae hear with -PRON- own ear and seenwith -PRON- own eye -PRON- declare that heand -PRON- pack will be -PRON- slave umtil -PRON- depart from the land 
tis well i answer with dighity 
tell koz that -PRON- be put out somiewhat at themanner of -PRON- reception but that -PRON- harbor noill will 
-PRON- shall be inform also wish -PRON- to tell -PRON- i continue i and -PRON- companion be merely human like the nyliite 
but -PRON- have power to requite evil for evil andgood for good 
there be no such word as good in the chur language 
then repeat the substance of -PRON- remark in way 
chief koz leader of the pack seem overjoyed when -PRON- word be translate by sertez for -PRON- benefit 
from condemn stranger -PRON- rise at one leap to the rank of honored guest 
the good cave in the hill be place at -PRON- two of the chief son be tell off to serve -PRON- 
one of -PRON- first act be to send for the bag of pemgnican and biscuit and to fortify -PRON- with ahearty meal against other emergency which -PRON- know would be sure to arise 
soon after -PRON- have finish -PRON- meal sertez look in on -PRON- for a little chat 
prebble and i have just be discuss sertez 
-PRON- be by -PRON- own admission a banished man but i regard -PRON- in the light of a renegade 
-PRON- have say princess ylma do not like himfor which i commend -PRON- warmlyand that in the face of this -PRON- be -PRON- desire to abduct -PRON- 
no gentleman would express -PRON- in such a manner 
prebble be of one mind with -PRON- but advise that -PRON- tolerate the fellow because of -PRON- value to -PRON- in -PRON- dealing with the chur 
so when sertez creep through the low entrance into -PRON- cave and then get up and advanced into the glare of the torch that light the interior -PRON- welcome -PRON- civilly 
-PRON- remark upon the head room to be have in -PRON- quarter say -PRON- be the only cave in the district where a man could stand upright without fear of knock out -PRON- brain 
-PRON- loll on a bearskin and -PRON- present -PRON- with a bit of pemmican and a ship biscuit both of which -PRON- appear to relish should think say that if the chur can climb to the top of the great wall on one side -PRON- could drop over on the other 
so -PRON- could -PRON- answer but there be no need of any climbing 
-PRON- gentleman have demolish the gate and -PRON- be now possible to walk through with perfect ease 
then why donot -PRON- do -PRON- strike in prebble 
from the little i have see of both country nyll be far preferable to this 
the chur be cow by the superiority of the nyllite say sertez 
with one look a nyllite can make a chur drop -PRON- spear and run howl back to -PRON- wilderness can -PRON- ever hope to make a raid into the other country i ask have be wait for king doazar and the almiks to come to dagger draw 
but now i have another plan 
i propose to cooperate with -PRON- 
in what way 
-PRON- seem to be possess of wonderful pow ers sertez proceed audaciously and if -PRON- could by some mean the nyllite the chur would immediately overrun -PRON- country and i could get the princess 
the shotgun be within reach i put out -PRON- hand toward -PRON- 
prebble halt -PRON- with a look 
that be out of -PRON- power say -PRON- 
disappointment overspread thie villainousface of sertez 
there be no way -PRON- can help -PRON- -PRON- query 
no i reply shortly 
what be the extent of the chur possessiotis ask the professor at -PRON- old tradeof delve for fact 
twenty mile fromwall to wall 
and what cause that pillar of smoke which -PRON- see to the north 
sertez look surprised suppose everybody know that say -PRON- 
the earth grind around -PRON- great spindle cause much heat so that smoke and minute particle of dust arise and mingle with the clowds 
tlie professor grab at -PRON- head 
adter a moment -PRON- continue what be the diameter of the north pole a geographical mile 
round on top 
no flatflat as a floor 
the great ziff live there 
who under the canopy be the great ziff 
i demand 
again the surprised lock filter across face 
-PRON- ignorance astonish -PRON- -PRON- exclaim 
the great ziff gentleman be head chief of all the pack 
when the time come to raid the land of the nyllite -PRON- will head the pack in person 
-PRON- be a warrior of prowess 
-PRON- be invincible in combat a veritable lion 
but the eye of the nyllite be too much for -PRON- as for the rest of -PRON- follower 
there be some peculiar thing ahout the great ziff for instance -PRON- be not subject to the gentleman 
fe have live many thousand influenice of time of vear and will no doubt last as long as the earth endure 
i see a grin form about the professor thin lip 
how do -PRON- account for thiserremarka ble longevity very easily 
what make timer 
day of course the succession of light and darkness 
what make day 
the rotation of the earth on -PRON- axis 
the great ziff live on the end of the axis and doesnot rotate 
therefore -PRON- be not subject to the influence of time 
the professor reach for the gun this time but i grab jt from -PRON- 
sophistry -PRON- cry rotation of the earth as -PRON- sdy make what -PRON- call a day but neither day nor month nor year make time 
-PRON- be but way station on the eternal path 
when -PRON- have be long in the country -PRON- will know more about -PRON- be unruffle rejoinder 
prebble grow red in the face and only succeed in calm -PRON- after a great effort 
how far be the north pole from here 
i ask 
an hour journey be anxious to pay -PRON- respect to the great zi impossible 
why impossible 
at a distance of fifty foot from the pole the terrific heat would scorch -PRON- to a cinder 
how do the great ziff get on and off the pole rarely get off 
as for get on -PRON- be there when the earth begin to rotate 
nonsense whoop the professor 
the longer -PRON- stay the more -PRON- will kuow say sertez laconically 
if the great ziff lead -PRON- subject on -PRON- raid into the land of nyll i put in have to get off the pole wonot -PRON- 
-PRON- will answer sertez 
when ready hell come fire have no effect on -PRON- and that be another of -PRON- peculiarity 
-PRON- be say -PRON- be very fond of blue fire 
-PRON- be serve by little boy in red cap what folly be the man talk exclaim the disgusted professor 
and by monster all head and no tail continue sertez and by hideous slimy thing that creep on the earth and slide through the air and order prebble 
-PRON- have enough of that after fact not fancy 
the longer -PRON- be with -PRON- the more yes yes -PRON- say that before 
the chur believe these thing about the great ziff 
about what i would expect of -PRON- primitive mind sniff the professor run to physical rather than to mental power say sertez rise 
if i can be of assistance to -PRON- at any time gentleman -PRON- add not fail to call on -PRON- 
thereupon -PRON- crawl out on all four as -PRON- have crawl in 
there go the big begin the pro fessor but pause abruptly 
no -PRON- go on wonot say -PRON- 
what -PRON- tell be hardly more in credible than the thing -PRON- have see with -PRON- own ecye since reach these circumpolar re gion if -PRON- be to put -PRON- experience down in black and white for the benefit of -PRON- fellow countryman captain -PRON- would call -PRON- monumental reirain again 
the term grate on a sensitive ear 
truth be strange than fiction ever dare to be say i sagely 
a few minute later accompany by -PRON- servitor bigoll and xit -PRON- emerge from -PRON- cavern and start for the pole 
-PRON- den open on a rocky defile with steep side which -PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to traverse 
at the end of the defile -PRON- come upon a group of warrior who grin behind -PRON- couch spear dispute -PRON- advance 
i motion -PRON- aside but -PRON- would not stir around for sertez thinking to make -PRON- wish know through -PRON- 
-PRON- be not in sight however 
as a last resort i fire the gun 
the chur quake in -PRON- track but do not fall as have heretofore be -PRON- invariable custom tr the other end of the defile say the professor 
-PRON- do and be meet by more of the chur who blockade -PRON- as effectuauy as the other have do -PRON- be honor guest with a vengeance i fume do this mean anyway 
-PRON- mean reply the professor that -PRON- prize -PRON- company so highly -PRON- canot let -PRON- go

i be for snatch the plate from this renegade -PRON- rival but what -PRON- have say only make -PRON- wildly eager for more 
i could learn more through -PRON- alone so i suffer -PRON- to proceed wondrous and unheardof thing be in the land of nyllite and i be fill with fearful foreboding 
the other stranger comljure from the sky by the hairless prophet be condemn to death by oyd but save -PRON- by offer to deliver to the king and -PRON- people thousand of keese of the elixir introduce by the little prophet with the glass eye 
whereto the foreigner last to arrive have rearet a strange structure fill with wonderful vat and call by -PRON- a distillery 
into this structure maize be carry and from -PRON- keese upon keese of the elixir be take to the end that the whole kingdom may renew -PRON- youth 
but if youth must be renew at such a price -PRON- be -PRON- prayer that the all wise will suffer -PRON- to age quickly and die that i may nolonger witness the orgy of these -PRON- people 
the king -PRON- father lie constantly in a state of torpor the gentleman in wait sing song and hold wassail from hour to hour the minister have lackluster eye and mumble to -PRON- and the business of state be at a standstill 
the people be even as the chur dull besotte reel along the road shout rave fill the air with hideous sound 
-PRON- have become heast and worsethan beast

the voice of sertez cease 
while speak -PRON- tone have become soft and gentle as though -PRON- appropriate for -PRON- the thought of the carnelian block 
then abruptly -PRON- leap erect with flame fling the gorr plate at -PRON- foot 
in a voice husky with anger -PRON- cry -PRON- blackhaire interloper from the antipode dare to raise -PRON- eye to the princess ylma 
-PRON- have the unblushing audacity to rival one of -PRON- own race 
liscreant 
renegade cry i hotly 
captain captain implore prebble observe -PRON- clench fist be calm calm i cry calm when this banish scoundrel speak to -PRON- in the manner -PRON- do 
by the mizzentruck of the great harry -PRON- s the bad enemy king boazar have do -PRON- frst stroke of work for princess ylma attend to this beggar so -PRON- pretty plan for raid the country will fall through 
prebble step in front of -PRON- 
enough of this captain say -PRON- 
remove -PRON- talk ring so that -PRON- may converse without let sertez understand -PRON- word 
i remove the ring and string -PRON- on -PRON- arm meanwhile keep wary and wrathful eye on the renegade 
i will say for -PRON- that -PRON- hold -PRON- ground with great firmness give every indication of be a knave of unusual quality to find together 
now go on prebble -PRON- own ring in -PRON- hand let -PRON- tell -PRON- captain that -PRON- be unwise to arouse sertez against -PRON- 
-PRON- safety among the chur be problematical 
-PRON- be alive by grace of -PRON- being esteem the thunder maker but the remegade have power with the chur and may at any moment withdraw -PRON- from -PRON- favor 
-PRON- can not afford to take chance 
the scoundrel have design upon the princess ylma 
i flare 
prebble look at -PRON- keenly 
have -PRON- any design on the princess captain -PRON- ask bluntly 
l be a man of honor say draw up to -PRON- full height and that question be lead and highly personal 
be sensible captain beg prebble be i not 
i growl glowering into the saturnine face of sertez 
-PRON- be not if -PRON- contemplate an alliance by marriage with the princess 
-PRON- be not of vour people and -PRON- be of the royal family 
such a union would be a misalliance and result in disaster 
believe -PRON- sali 
-PRON- be a beautiful girl and as goed as -PRON- be beautiful i answer 
and -PRON- have see -PRON- twice and talk with -PRON- not at all 
much -PRON- know about -PRON- captain be an explorer prebble but that do not deny some small amount of sentiment in -PRON- soul 
strangle this bit of sentiment 
-PRON- have warp -PRON- judgment 
continue to harbor -PRON- and -PRON- will suffer 
suffer i echo angrily 
yes suffer 
suppose -PRON- could get away from this part of the earth and return to other part -PRON- know well 
would -PRON- take princess ylma with -PRON- 
as mrs salis yesif -PRON- would go 
what would happen to the throne in that event 
when the time come for boazar to die with princess ylma go the kingdom wauld fall into the hand of sertez 
could there be a great disaster and if yima be -PRON- would fall into the hand of sertez 
that prebble be an infinitely great disaster 
-PRON- smile 
-PRON- look at the princess through the small end of the telescope captain say -PRON- and at the kingdom through the big end 
as a conseguence the importance of the princess be magnify out of all proportion 
there be no use argue with -PRON- prebble i storm know -PRON- heart man and i will go -PRON- own way 
as for this scoundrel sertez will save nyll from -PRON- lawless intention 
when i be do with -PRON- there will be no chance of the kingdom or of the princess ever talle into -PRON- unworthy hand 
i consider -PRON- duty to put sertez out of the way and all this mutter prebble because of the think wave imbed in one gorr plate 
be -PRON- all mad 
call -PRON- what -PRON- will -PRON- mind be make up 
yima have call upon -PRON- to save -PRON- father kingdom 
pollock have release an evil which have -PRON- inception with -PRON- -PRON- be at fault and the least -PRON- can do be to pay heed to the cry send -PRON- by the princess in that carnelian block 
listen counsel the professor 
there be a possibility that sertez do not translate the think wave of the princess correctly 
no possibility of that at all 
-PRON- want to learn what thought the princess be send to -PRON- 
-PRON- may have repeat to -PRON- a message which be not in the plate 
prebble the message prove -PRON- to be correct no sidestep all that about pollock the dlstlllel son flooding nyll with that tt have happen and all th confound elixir rest have happen just as sertez tell -PRON- 
the sentiment of the princess be correctly translate and lie -PRON- life on -PRON- 
that gorr plate be a call to actiona commandand -PRON- can not ignore -PRON- be as eager for action as -PRON- be captain say prebble but what can -PRON- do if -PRON- tie -PRON- hand by antagonize sertez 
-PRON- be already antagonize 
in -PRON- -PRON- recognize a rival and that be more than enough to set -PRON- against the two of -PRON- 
stand aside 
i tell -PRON- professor i be determined to see this through to the bitter end 
-PRON- must strike a blow for nyll 
-PRON- be subordinate the welfare of nyll to that of the princess 
if -PRON- slay sertez captain every chur will be at -PRON- throat 
reecf please on that phase of the matter have reflect and i tell -PRON- there be no time to lose 
over the professor shoulder be the evil leer face of the renegade taunt -PRON- and give -PRON- a dare to do -PRON- bad 
in order to stop the professor argument clap on the talk ring then i start by a detour for sertez 
prebble seek to hold -PRON- but i shake -PRON- off 
the next moment i hurl -PRON- at the renegade 
-PRON- be slender and quick of movement and manage to avoid -PRON- 
duck under -PRON- fist -PRON- race for the entrance to the cave pick up the gun and cartridge belt as -PRON- flee 
there -PRON- go scream prebble steal -PRON- thunder let -PRON- steal -PRON- thunder captain 
i try -PRON- good to overhaul the rascal but -PRON- claw through the opening a dozen foot in the lead 
down i go on -PRON- marrow bone to follow andthen just as i be close to the exit there come a crash and the light of day be shut 
rom -PRON- eye 
ahuge bowlder which have be keep in readiness as afterward learn be knock free and fall across the entrance 
prebble and be imprison in the cave 
imprison and render helpless when -PRON- be need elsewhere 
for -PRON- sole wish now be to get back to the prince and save -PRON- and -PRON- people from the doom that threaten -PRON- 
i could have imitate the army in flander -PRON- be possible i do although the memory escape -PRON- 
what be that harp the queruious voice of the professor bowlder block the entrance answer 
push -PRON- aside 
i have try without avail locomotive couldnot move -PRON- pant -PRON- squeeze around the edg 
the opening be hermetically seal 
that scoundrel design this for a live grave i creep back to the torch beside which -PRON- companion crouch wring -PRON- hand 
think of i say in a hollow voice 
what noble mind be there oerthrown 
captain reply prebble in an awesome whisper -PRON- be the demon refer to in the legend 
aye return -PRON- save -PRON- miserable life with a flask of bourbon and pollock the distiller son have complete the work 
-PRON- have build a gin mill and the kingdom of boazar be steep in debauchery 
the serpent have crawl into paradise 
and the princess ylma 
merciful heaven what will become of -PRON- i stagger erect and beat -PRON- brow with -PRON- clench fist 
the opportunity of the chur have arrive say prebble still in -PRON- awed whisper 
lead by the great ziff the ally pack will sweep through the broken gate and lie domain in waste 
awful captain 
-PRON- soul shrink at the thought 
and that arch fiend sertez will bear away the princess yima 
i rave must get out of here 
-PRON- must i tell -PRON- 
i crawl to the rock again and push until i see star 
not an inch could i move -PRON- 
come back captain call prebble calmly waste -PRON- strength 
come back and let -PRON- think 
can -PRON- think -PRON- out of this hole in the hillside 
i retort be what -PRON- want think must precede action 
come here and be quiet 
there be a command in -PRON- voice and i crawl back to the torch once more and crouch opposite -PRON- watch -PRON- fac in the sickly glare 
-PRON- be a thin strong face the face of a thinker 
-PRON- eye gleam and glow as -PRON- cogitate 
i be in the mood for quick and decisive action and the necessity of inaction gall and fret -PRON- 
first say the professor -PRON- must calm -PRON- 
a passive brain evolve the most fruitful suggestion 
this be not the first time -PRON- have ask -PRON- to be calm i return 
if -PRON- feeling be yours prebble -PRON- would understand the uselessness of the request be as much concerned as -PRON- be captain over the trouble that menace nyll 
sertez the renegade seem destine to have -PRON- day 
if boazar die and the kingdom fall into the hand of sertez 
-PRON- have already speak of that prebble i mterrupte if boazar die and if princess yima do not reign as queen regal authority fail into the hand of count zylox 
-PRON- be tell vou remember that zvlox be the head of another branch of the roval family 
-PRON- be the pretender 
-PRON- have not grasp ny mean captain sertez for -PRON- reward in helpmd the great ziff aoamst -PRON- own people will be give the hand of yhna in marriage 
thus -PRON- will be the queen consort and undoubtedly elevate to a high place in the wreck adfter the great ziff get through with nyll i answer in a hollow tone there will be noth leit to rule 
thc chur will occupy the fertile plain of nyll and will overrun and desecrate the palace and the templea ev enthmcf worth while will be trmlp lead underfoot and destrove and the conquer brute will brutalize everything good and noble with which -PRON- come in contact 
in time however the nyllite will shake o7 tie vstupor recover thetr brilliant mental power and reconquer -PRON- kingdom 
-PRON- may require year perhaps decade but that result il be evolve ultimately out of the wreck 
nyl will have learn a lesson and can rebuild ijts glory on a firm foundation not forget professor i remind -PRON- that -PRON- present business be to escape from this cavern 
-PRON- be need and -PRON- must not del lay or waste -PRON- time in idle talk 
the talk be not idle captain reply prebble 
-PRON- wit be at work upon this problem and discourse merely sharpen -PRON- 
i have no hkmg for this sertez from the first be -PRON- response but -PRON- find -PRON- of one mind on that point very soon after -PRON- fall into the hand of the chur in what way do -PRON- think -PRON- can effect -PRON- escape from this hole in the hillside an idea have not yet offer -PRON- captain but i have an instinctive feeling that i be close to of the problem 
let the talk go on flow i shall suddenly see the light 
here be another inconsistency of at time while -PRON- be busy with hi prollem -PRON- want to be alone and would bear with nothing that may distract -PRON- here at this time -PRON- be eager for conversation and declare -PRON- an aid to quick and effective thinking 
as -PRON- mind be entirely wrap up in the princess and the sorry plight of -PRON- father and -PRON- kingdom i be at a loss to put forward any subject for discourse 
the professor step into the breach 
what do -PRON- think of the great ziff -PRON- inquire 
why that -PRON- be a great fake be a myth professor and the myth have be develop as a sort of check on the wild chur 
the professor shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- be no myth -PRON- declare 
-PRON- be a symbol indeed but a live symbol 
there be a vast amount of folk lore and tradition surround the great ziff but the person -PRON- be a reality 
-PRON- be the real king of the chur and -PRON- keep -PRON- hidden because -PRON- know that will bind -PRON- authority more closely around -PRON- savage subject 
why all that tommyrot about the little boy in red ap and monster all head and no tail and soon 
when 
sertez vwa talk to -PRON- alout those thing -PRON- -PRON- halt -PRON- and ask for fact not fancy 
the fancy as i now believe captain symbotize fact beyond -PRON- depth i observe helplesly 
i see in the story about the great ziff nothing but fatry taleschronicle of the cid and aljce in wonderland 
surely -PRON- donot agree with the chur that time have no effect upon the ziff and that -PRON- have live alwaysand wili always live belteve the fact which that statement symbolize assert prebble 
since man inhabit the earth the idea for which the ziff stand have be in the background immutable eternal 
but what be that idea 
prebble stare at -PRON- 
there be sentiment in -PRON- soul captain and surely -PRON- wit should be able to match -PRON- against the nimble fancy of a lot old hairy demon like these chur a puzzle which i have no time to work on at present must do something prebble and at once -PRON- think of any way out of here be close to something captain 
-PRON- eye for several moment have be fix on the torch flame 
that say -PRON- point to the flare offer the suggestion that may lead -PRON- to freedom 
how open -PRON- say be hermetically seal yes 
nou be sure 
dositive what cause that flame to bend toward the rear of the cavern 
there be a draft and there could be no draft without an opening right 
i cry overjoyed 
there be an exit somewhere 
-PRON- pull the torch from -PRON- socket 
hold -PRON- in -PRON- hand -PRON- walk slowly toward the back part of the cavern watch the flame as -PRON- bend forward direct -PRON- with flicker finger 
the roof dip toward the floor 
prebble go down on hand and knee still holdine the torch and followi e as -PRON- commandel -PRON- trail away and i see -PRON- weave to and fro in the distance the fluttering torch like astar 
-PRON- be a star -PRON- star of hope if ever -PRON- have one 
suddenly the little reddish dot come to a standstill and voice float back to -PRON- eureka -PRON- call 
bring what s leave of the biscuit and pemmican captain 
i snatch up the bagit be now light and of small dimensionsand follow -PRON- companion 
-PRON- wait for -PRON- have a tight squeeze of -PRON- say -PRON- 
when the great primordial cataclysm fashion this hill -PRON- have the forethought to leave a narrow passage through from the cavern to the top 
i can see daylight ahead 
crawl for -PRON- i return be close after -PRON- 
in some way i push and drag -PRON- through and at last -PRON- emerge on the hillside overlook the defile that lie at -PRON- cavern mouth 
from -PRON- position -PRON- could look down and see the great bowlder that have be balance over the entrance 
the gully be full of chur and the center of interest seem to be sertez 
the renegade have the gun and be handle -PRON- with dangerous carelessness 
if -PRON- s not careful say kill somebody 
the word be barely out of -PRON- mouth when the piece explode and one of the chur fall in -PRON- track 
consternation seize upon every one sertez along with the rest 
the destructive power of the gun have not before be bring home to these creature for the mere report of -PRON- have be sufficient to compass -PRON- end 
now however the bunghng of sertez have work a catastrophe which cause the thunder maker to be doubly fear 
the chur prostrate -PRON- and sertez drop the firearma though -PRON- have be a serpent fling the belt down upon -PRON- and then retreat to a respeetful distance 
this be -PRON- opportunity professor say and -PRON- hurry down the slope and make -PRON- way to where the gun and belt be lie 
-PRON- would be difficult to decide whether -PRON- appearance in the defile have apparently issue through the solid bowlder block -PRON- cave or the fatal use of the shotgun frighten these iavaze creature the more on several occasion i have see -PRON- primitive mind overcome but never to the extent that -PRON- be now be -PRON- able to get out of the cave falter sertez 
-PRON- be not mecessary for -PRON- to know say i sternly pick up the belt and buckle -PRON- around -PRON- and then possess -PRON- of the gun 
inform koz that -PRON- desire to go to the pole and interview the great ziff 
but -PRON- can not do as i tell -PRON- 
i break in sternly and emphasize the command by point the gun in -PRON- direction 
-PRON- give a shout of horror and run to the chief 
koz listen attentively while sertez tell -PRON- wish and then approach -PRON- with -PRON- two servitor bigollrand xit 
sertez do not venture in -PRON- proximity 
krom a distance -PRON- call koz and -PRON- son will accompany -PRON- 
see to -PRON- sertez shout -PRON- head no foray into the kingdom of nyll otherwise the thunder maker shall speak in term -PRON- eannot fail to understand 
-PRON- show -PRON- tooth in a snarling smile and from that i know that -PRON- be not yet do with -PRON- 
koz -PRON- take the food bag and carry -PRON- aerdss -PRON- shoulder but neither -PRON- nor bigoll nor xit could be induce to bear the thunder maker 
with the three chur in the lead -PRON- course lead -PRON- down the defile and out throtigh a country where titan have at one time be at play hurl mountain at each other pile -PRON- up fantastically 
steadily but surely -PRON- advance upon the pillar of smoke and dust 
as -PRON- go on the ground grow hotter beneath -PRON- 
often -PRON- strike a spot where -PRON- foot be compel to fly upward in a wild dance or bear the weight of -PRON- body on -PRON- toe 
everywhere be desolation 
contiguous to the great wall be area where plant and tree grow and stream of warm water have -PRON- course 
but here the heat be fatal to plant life and what moisture the ground contain be give off insteam 
still onward -PRON- keep -PRON- course although -PRON- seem every moment as though -PRON- must turn back 
a weird exaltation thrill -PRON- 
for the present i forget that i be seek the great zift to threaten -PRON- in case -PRON- seize upon the misfortune of nyll to make an invasion of the country 
again the polar explorer search for that baffling and elusive thing call the north pole 
vith -PRON- eye turn straight ahead of -PRON- i press on and on 
at last -PRON- reach a point beyond which -PRON- would have be suicide to venture 
and there before -PRON- arise the coal of -PRON- ambition 
adequatcly to describe the soulinspiring spectacle be beyond -PRON- 
no pen could do justice to the scene least of all mine which heretofore have be comnfine to the simple annal of the log book 
i have see a volcano in eruption and the vomiting forth of fire and smoke and dust bear some resemblance to this polar phenomenon 
here the zone of activity be half a mile in diameter completely circular 
within the vortex as the veil shift the great spindle be disclose a mighty bulwark of celestial law and orderwithout which there could be no night no dayno certainty of recur seasonsno life on this fruitful planet entrance -PRON- stand and watch the wondrous whirligig perform -PRON- mighty evolution 
nearly three hundred and fifty foot per hour -PRON- move more than five foot per minutethe grand majestic sweep of a vast world set spin in the night of age by the allpowerful hand 
prebble and i stand dumb in the presence of the stupendous mechanism koz and -PRON- son lie prostrate pour upon -PRON- head the dust of humility and reverence 
thus in -PRON- several way do the finite pay tribute to the infinite 
-PRON- must build a cairn say i hoarsely turn -PRON- bloodshot eye upon prebble 
why a cairn -PRON- ask 
as a mark to commemorate this visit a proof to any who follow that captain sali and phinea prebble have be here before -PRON- 
the chur be here before any of -PRON- say prebble 
can -PRON- go away and claim the discovery of the north pole when human eye have already look upon -PRON- 
-PRON- eye look out at -PRON- from lid inflame by the heat twinkle oddly 
-PRON- have be first to pierce the ice wall i answer and be entitle to be call discoverer 
suaviter in modo fortiter in re murmur -PRON- learn companion 
-PRON- may just as well claim the discovery without see the thing discover 
i see small difference in the ethic of the case 
-PRON- hop around to ease -PRON- stew foot 
if -PRON- be on cool ground professor say -PRON- may go into thatsubject more exhaustively give -PRON- attention to the cairn however 
who will know what the cairn stand for in case -PRON- happen to be find 
-PRON- will leave a tablet and a flag hot for such work and the professor draw a hand across -PRON- dripping forehead and i fail to see the usefulness of -PRON- 
explorer always build cairn i cry irritably 
then mivabile dictu let -PRON- build one set the chur to collect stone i order while i prepare the tablet 
-PRON- hop away over the steam stone and get the chur at work 
after a short search i discover a piece of flat slatelike rock soft enough to take the sharp point of a piece of agate 
with great care i scratch the following on the slate tablet at this point during the summer of arrived captain sali and professor phinea prebble have set out from america in the year on a voyage of discovery and exploration 
i show the inscription to prebble -PRON- have leave out the most important point -PRON- cry 
what be that 
-PRON- have say nothing about -PRON- own discovery the proof i have develop regard the meteoric theory of the aurora add that as a postscript say by way of humor -PRON- 
so i append the following during the progress of the polar expedition say professor prebble demonstrate the truth ot the meteoric theory of the aurora 
will that do 
i inquire 
very well -PRON- answer greatly pleased 
now if neither of -PRON- live to return to -PRON- own country and some other explorer be able to come to this benighted region shall have -PRON- niche in the hall of fame 
but the tablet be still incomplete 
the tablet already hadscorche -PRON- finger and be become altogether too hot for any more inscription 
what else be there i ask impatiently 
-PRON- theory concern the failure of the human mind north of the arctic circle say -PRON- 
put that in will not i answer and go down on -PRON- knee to affix the eiece of slate in the hot earth 
upon this -PRON- pile -PRON- gather rock 
i superintend the laying of the stone and consider the difficulty under which -PRON- work i believe that a most excellent cairn be construct and one that must still remain on that very spot 
-PRON- be try labor and -PRON- sweat over the task 
the chur labor in a state of awe and apprehension pause constantly to look around -PRON- as though -PRON- expect something to happen -PRON- scarcely know what 
-PRON- action communicate to -PRON- a certain uncanny feeling which have begin with the vast mechanism of the pole -PRON- get nervous confide the professor 
-PRON- be in a region well qualified to make any one nervous i answer make ready to lay the final stone on the apex of the heap have do with this cairn building captain and move to some other place 
-PRON- must continue -PRON- examination of the pole say greatly regret that -PRON- have not the instrument mecessary to make an observation too torrid for observation and -PRON- have already linger here so long that the sol of -PRON- foot be literally do to a turn

at the precise moment the final stone be add to the heap -PRON- attention be attract by fearful cry from the chur 
i face about and at once -PRON- startled gaze encounter a sight that freeze -PRON- blood 
the veil of smoke dust and flame be part by a form that plunge through -PRON- like a swimmer through the sea separate the red billow with -PRON- naked hand

a whip seem lash -PRON- brain with stinging force and at every blow the voice of sertez rang in -PRON- ear the great ziff 
now will -PRON- believe 
in one hand this hideous giant carry a skull in the other hand a thigh bone 
again and again -PRON- would strike the skull and a dull sepulchral sound would be the result 
as -PRON- pound -PRON- horrid drum -PRON- would roar in monotonous tone syllable which sound like then at interval -PRON- would lift the thigh bone and point southward

but the monotony be suddenly varied 
sertez lean forward like lightning 
i advice be spear pointfell rise and there be a reddish stain mar thebrightness of a mutter anathema the count catch the haft of -PRON- weapon in -PRON- left hand and continue the battle -PRON- right ari hang limp at -PRON- side i try to press forward and draw the attention of sertez

the combat go on 
zylox fight at a terrible disadvantage as be apparent to all of -PRON- and from the throne princess ylma watch with breathless lip and pallid cheek 
the stertorous breathing of the king come to -PRON- ear through the dead silence and now and again -PRON- would move restlessly and mutter incoherently once more there be the monotony of thrust and parry above below and clash clash as the spear head meet and send ring echo through the vault chamber

but -PRON- do not fall backward as i believe -PRON- would 
-PRON- pitch forward upon -PRON- weapon and -PRON- impale -PRON- to the heart 
prone on the floor -PRON- lie the long shaft cling to -PRON- breast 
as -PRON- stand over -PRON- an appalling sound floated to -PRON- from the distant corridor 
poom poom poom 
the chur drop in a flash

i have no spear but i pick up the one wield by sertez give -PRON- to -PRON- lordship and take from -PRON- the gun

the chur spring erect 
now captain if -PRON- can do anything whisper -PRON- lordship frantically now 
the giant be advance upon the throne 
in a trice i raise the gun and give -PRON- hoth barrel 
the roar in that confine space be awful beyond word 
as the smoke clear -PRON- see the great ziff sprawl on the floor 
-PRON- gaze be tell what i behold with -PRON- own eyeseven as -PRON- look -PRON- form fade into thin air so that -PRON- see nothing but the bloodred tile 
and then from without -PRON- hear the sepulchral sound of bone and skull and the roar of the ziff as strong as ever 
the chur rush from the throne room and from the palace while the count -PRON- lordship and i hasten to one of the window 
there this colossal creature stand gather -PRON- cohort unharme in body or limb 
i be sorry the professor be not a witness of this proceeding for -PRON- afterward tell -PRON- i must have be frighten out of -PRON- wit so that fear color -PRON- account of the extraordinary event 
those who have follow -PRON- so far i trust will know -PRON- better than that the palace door cry count zylox 
-PRON- three will hold the place against the invader 
-PRON- hurry to follow out -PRON- suggestion 
after every door have be secure -PRON- look down from a lofty window and to -PRON- infense surprise find that the great ziff and -PRON- follower have leave the vicinity of the palace 
-PRON- be safe for the present say lord nyli heave a sigh of relief 
the ziff will return aver the count 
until -PRON- do go on -PRON- lordship turn to -PRON- there will be little for -PRON- to do captain 
if -PRON- would like to go to the lavatory and make a change of garment i will be glad to conduct -PRON- 
-PRON- make the suggestion out of the kindness of -PRON- heart and i be grateful to -PRON- for -PRON- in truth i be a sorrylooke representative of the united state army as i stand before -PRON- 
i still wear what remain of -PRON- buskin but -PRON- be the sole relic of -PRON- former state 
in the land of the chur prebble and i have both don the prevail bearskin and while mine cover -PRON- from shoulder to knee and be respectable enough yet -PRON- be hardly a court even for those try time 
while i be engage in make myseli more presentable lord nyli from an adjoin room beguie -PRON- labor with conversation know -PRON- should hear from sertez in some such maunner say -PRON- 
who be this sertez 
i inquire scoundrel and a renegade have discover that much for -PRON- -PRON- lordship 
i have also learn that -PRON- have be among the chur since the beginning of the long day 
-PRON- be banish 
yes 
that be a mistake however 
mistake in this way captain -PRON- should have be condemn to death by oyd instead of merely be banish 
count zylox and i be anxious to see -PRON- receive the death penalty but princess ylma prevail with the king and sentence of banishment be pronounce 
i be wash the red stain from -PRON- shoulder 
the wound be merely a scratch and in no wise interfere with -PRON- uscfulness fagerly i caucht at -PRON- lordship mention of the princess why do the princess interfere in behalf of sertez i query 
that trench upon the matter for which sertez be send away be the reply 
there be no reason why i should not tell -PRON- about -PRON- captain 
-PRON- have becn of great service to the king and the princess md the kingdom be under a vast obligation to -PRON- shall be glad to hear about -PRON- say sertez -PRON- lordship go on be make much of by king boazar 
the fortune of sertez be small but wealth be no bar to advancement in the kingdom of nyll 
-PRON- majesty conceive a liking for sertez and take -PRON- into the palace as one of the gentleman in wait 
the possession of twenty chur entitle a nyllite to a patent of nobility for in the old time to rule a score of chur one prove the possession of a powerful intellect and intellect alone admit to the peerage 
one who aspire to be a noble be require to capture -PRON- chur with -PRON- own hand and subdue -PRON- 
sertez with great bravery win -PRON- twenly slave and be take into the palace as one of the king houschold 
-PRON- lordship pause for a moment have little time to dwell upon the peculiar ability necessary before one could become a noble of that queer kingdom 
once in the palace proceed lord nylis sertez have the presumption to lift -PRON- eyve to the princess 
thus in a way -PRON- prove -PRON- a serpent and strike at the hand which feed -PRON- 
princess ylma be design by the king as a mate for count zylox thus weld the two branch of the royal family together and avert discord when the time come for the king to pass 
sertez be that right lord nylis 
i demand 
should the king use -PRON- power to consummate such an alliance 
be not princess ylma to have a choice in the matter princess of the blood captain come sadly from -PRON- lordship be but pawn inthe game of royalty 
-PRON- lot be cast wherever policy may elect 
in this case and i quite coincide with -PRON- majesty the two branch of the roval family must be unite 
from what i have say about the king plan for -PRON- daughter vou will understand more clearly the presumption of sertez in aspire to the hand of the princess 
-PRON- repulse -PRON- and place the matter before the king 
i majesty be enrage and summon sertez before -PRON- to answer for -PRON- action 
sertez be find guilty and condemn to death by oyd 
princess ylma interfere and the sentence be commute to banishment 
the princess should not have interfere say most assuredly not but -PRON- have a tender heart and could not bear to think that sertez be to suffer death on -PRON- account 
-PRON- be all one with sertez now lord nylis 
-PRON- be spare to plan with the chur the destruction of the kingdom bu -PRON- end have finally overtake -PRON- 
the evil have be accomplish comment lord with a heavy sigh and -PRON- will be long before -PRON- country recover from the blow 
-PRON- be a lesson to -PRON- country say -PRON- should teach all of -PRON- to beware of anything indulgence in which will tend to becloud -PRON- faculty do not know the power of this elixir 
for which the pfofessor and i be guilty 
i acknowledge the debt -PRON- owe -PRON- people nylis and -PRON- be do what -PRON- can to atone for -PRON- misguided action lay nothing at -PRON- door captain 
-PRON- and -PRON- companion have to do something to preserve -PRON- life and -PRON- take the ready mean at hand be hopeful as -PRON- say that -PRON- country will profit by the grievous lesson 
do -PRON- think the professor will succeed in -PRON- am positive of -PRON- say with conviction 
prebble be an able man and when -PRON- set -PRON- hand to a piece of work -PRON- usually accomplish -PRON- 
the elixir be a weapon that work both way 
savage be especially partial to -PRON- 
the chur be not gift with the reason power of the will easily fall victim to the insidious beverage 
-PRON- and -PRON- people on the other hand will profit by the lesson and abstain from such elixir in future 
the easy way to make -PRON- abstain be to remove the elixir from among -PRON- 
the place where -PRON- be manufacture must be destroy at the early possible moment 
that will be attend to 
be the process of manufacture know to any of the yllite no pollock and griffyn have keep the process a secret good 
i exclaim 
before another hour have pass i feel a different man 
tmmediately after emerge from the lavatory and dress chamber i repair to the throne room 
princess ylma be still beside the king who be recover slightly and call for more of the elixir 
the moment i enter -PRON- descend and come toward -PRON- with outstretche hand 
the count as observed have thoughtfully drag the body of sertez rom the apartment and only the stain of blood remain to mark the spot where the sanguinary struggle have take place 
save for the king -PRON- be alone the princess and i catch -PRON- hand and hold -PRON- for a moment peer into -PRON- wonderful hlue cye 
a knew -PRON- would come -PRON- say softly -PRON- lid droop and the color come and go in -PRON- full round cheek come quickly -PRON- princess say but could not arrive before the chur 
-PRON- be a stranger -PRON- say flash a quick look at -PRON- and i can not be -PRON- princess 
neverthelessx i return drop on one knee and press -PRON- hand to -PRON- lip -PRON- be -PRON- princess and must call -PRON- so 
-PRON- raise -PRON- gently be tell that -PRON- would not be able to learn the secret of the gorr plate -PRON- proceed as i stand at -PRON- side learn -PRON- i answer not think -PRON- necessary to describe the means 
then be i ble -PRON- hesitate -PRON- lip be ever in -PRON- heart i whisper 
and -PRON- think of -PRON- in the same manner that i think of -PRON- 
yes i reply 
lver since -PRON- save -PRON- companion and -PRON- at the lake -PRON- have never be absent from either mind or heart 
a lover must be allow some latitude even at the pole where latitude be stretch to -PRON- farth limit 
-PRON- withdraw -PRON- hand quickly 
turn -PRON- make -PRON- way back to the throne and sit on the step 
come -PRON- say make a place beside -PRON- 
i wish to ask -PRON- if -PRON- and -PRON- companion can be of any aid to this poor country in -PRON- present plight 
-PRON- shall do -PRON- good to save the country be -PRON- response and i believe that success will attend -PRON- effort 
the professor be now engage in the work griffyn and pollock be with -PRON- 
nothing can be do -PRON- declare with spirit this elixir be destroy to the last drop 
i have give order for the burning of the building in which -PRON- be make 
the professor countermand -PRON- order 
-PRON- eye flash 
why -PRON- ask imperiousuy 
because although -PRON- have be the mean of bring woe and unhappiness to nyll -PRON- may yet be employ in save the country 
the elixir be a good servant but a bad master 
how may the elixir be employ 
let the chur partake of -PRON- and -PRON- will render -PRON- helpless 
then the nyllite may rise conquer the savage and resume -PRON- use of the elixir -PRON- interrupt sorrowfully 
no 
after the chur have be conquer then burn the distillery and let every keese of the elixir be pour on the ground 
-PRON- clap -PRON- hand and a joyful look overspread -PRON- face 
but the joy be shortlive 
and then -PRON- resume the king will order the other stranger to build a new distillery as -PRON- call -PRON- and -PRON- will have to comply in order to save -PRON- life 
princess return -PRON- poor life have be the cause of all this misery 
have the professor and i not value -PRON- existence so highly the king would never have taste the content of that first flask nor would the second flask have be give -PRON- nor would the distillery have be build 
be -PRON- sure -PRON- will demand more of the elixir when -PRON- recover reason and see what direful consequence have follow -PRON- use the taste be strong upon -PRON- -PRON- drink the brown fluid continually be sure -PRON- will order more of -PRON- 
in that event say i grimly griffyn the professor and must leave the country where will -PRON- go -PRON- ask tremulously 
back to -PRON- own land 
beyond the ice wall -PRON- hand creep toward -PRON- and catch -PRON- clingingly 
yes 
will there not be danger in the attempt suppose so be -PRON- glum rejoinder 
will -PRON- not dread to face -PRON- -PRON- cheek be close to mine -PRON- starvy eye fix upon -PRON- own and burn with a light that thrill -PRON- 
i place -PRON- other hand about -PRON- waist shall dread face the danger much less than leave the princess ylma 
-PRON- sigh 
tell -PRON- of -PRON- own country -PRON- sard

in some way more wonderful but in other less so 
-PRON- have no gorr plate no oyd car no king no princess but -PRON- have -PRON- ziff many of -PRON- and all fully as terrible as the one -PRON- have lately see 
do -PRON- not destroy the mind of the people 
the brown fluid do that then come the ziff 
do the ziff bring -PRON- chur 
-PRON- have no chur princess 
every man be -PRON- own chur 
these shaggy monster skulk in the trail of the brown fluid and battle with the man well self until the ziff come and finish the work 
-PRON- shudder should not like -PRON- country -PRON- say 
onlys if -PRON- be there even such a land may be paradise for -PRON- 
the word be still on -PRON- lip as i pluck the last one with a kiss -PRON- scoundrel count zylox 
the princess push from -PRON- with a ittle cry and -PRON- both look up to find the captain of the guard regard -PRON- with a scowl 
i arise haughtily can not forget that i be in the presence of a lady say or i should answer -PRON- speech in kind 
eavesdropper rarely hear anything to -PRON- liking 
-PRON- introduce a curse into the land sneer the count and after destroy the people -PRON- attempt the destruction of the king only daughter so liar 
i cry 
-PRON- base insinuation be too much for -PRON- hot blood 
i launch -PRON- toward -PRON- and have not the princess interfere would have teach -PRON- a lesson then and there 
the king daughter be between -PRON- hand fall and i step back 
-PRON- pardon princess ylma murmur 
aly at somie other time and in some other place -PRON- shall yield -PRON- satisfaction for -PRON- word 
-PRON- shall not -PRON- return a very queen in speech and bearing shall prove -PRON- manhood by ignore a man who forget -PRON- as count zylox have do 
-PRON- face the count desire -PRON- to leave this room 
there aie other thing to command -PRON- attention at the present moment 
nothing more imiportant than this -PRON- answer 
-PRON- bend -PRON- eye upon -PRON- steadily 
withdraw -PRON- command 
for the first time i see that the count have the shotgun in -PRON- hand 
let -PRON- first give -PRON- that weapon princess ylma i request 
take -PRON- say the count savagely and fling -PRON- with all the force of -PRON- left arm down on the tile 
the piece be break beyond repair 
-PRON- heart sink for i have count on use the gun in defense of the palace should -PRON- be attack 
as the count turn on -PRON- heel a loud commotion be hear at the palace entrance 
-PRON- hurry away and i start to follow 
promise -PRON- before -PRON- go say princess yima that -PRON- will not renew this quarrel promise say and hasten on 
-PRON- be unnecessarily alarm by the noise on the palace step 
the great ziff have not return with the chur but pollock have come with an oyd car and a tank of elixir 
-PRON- report that prebble griffyn and -PRON- have start in different direction through the kingdom each with a large quantity of the brown fluid 
this be be judiciously distribute among the chur 
-PRON- be wild atter the stuff say pollock and be cast aside -PRON- loot -PRON- shield and spear and even allow -PRON- prisoner to escape so that -PRON- may drink more and more of the fire water 
in twentyfour hour if the nyllite will rise nyll will be -PRON- once more 
pollock leave after be reassure as to the safety of the king and the princess 
i run back to the throne room to acquaint the princess with the progress of the good work but the apartment be desert 
since there be rfo danger to threaten i throw -PRON- down in one of the reclining room to rest after the exciting event of the last few hour 
wear out i fall asleep 
when i awake i be not in the reclining room 
all around -PRON- be black darkness and a dank smell as from moldy wall 
what have happen to -PRON- 
i dash -PRON- hand across -PRON- face to free -PRON- brain from the evil spell that seem to encompass -PRON- 
still the darkness would not lift 
be i mad 
i reach out on either side 
on -PRON- right space on -PRON- left a blank slippery wall 
i feel below 
i be lie on a slab of stome 
staggering erect i grope -PRON- way aimlessly about 
presently i come to another wall 
turn i pace to the wall opposite 
twenty pace 
detween wall the other way i also count twenty pace 
then i climb upon the block of stone and reach upward -PRON- finger touch the roof 
under -PRON- around above nothing but granite 
sit down on the slab i bow -PRON- head in -PRON- hand be a prisoner there be no doubt of that 
but how have -PRON- be able to carry -PRON- off without wake -PRON- 
i be not a heavy sleeper and the croon of a rope through an oil sheave have more than once send -PRON- from niy bunk 
i smell an odor strange to -PRON- nostril 
abh i have be drug 
resistance be fear and these man who be wide awake for six month of the year have take advantage of -PRON- in -PRON- sleep and drug and imprison -PRON- 
-PRON- be zylox of course 
-PRON- have see -PRON- with the princess have hear -PRON- conversation and -PRON- have increase -PRON- enmity toward -PRON- 
-PRON- be a brave man and have the good of the kingdom at heart 
but brave man be weak when strike on the side of -PRON- affection 
-PRON- love the princess and -PRON- care nothing for -PRON- 
-PRON- would not brook interfence on -PRON- part and death be to be -PRON- portion 
i wonder how long an interval have pass since i lie down in the reclining room 
i also think of prebble and wonder if -PRON- have succeed in save the klingdom what would -PRON- do when -PRON- hear that i be a prisoncr 
what could -PRON- do 
possibly -PRON- would not hear 
no doubt i be in the stronghold of count zylox where i conld be deal with at -PRON- enemys pleasure 
and the princess 
would -PRON- ever know -PRON- fate 
as i sit there with bow head a door open raspingly and light strike across the gloom look up and see the count enter accompany by four armed chur 
i spring erect and rush toward -PRON- but two spear cross front of -PRON- breast and stay mec 
keep -PRON- distance say the count 
be there a spark of honor or manhood about -PRON- i cry 
will -PRON- not orant -PRON- the satisfaction one gentleman may yield another face to face would not soil -PRON- hand fight coward 
-PRON- smile ith -PRON- cage rat may rage at a lion say -PRON- coolly 
where be in a dungeon of the king palace 
why be i here lese majesty 
high treason 
i exclaim trumpedup charge zylox 
no stranger in the country can commit treason 
no but -PRON- can do bad and plan odious thing 
i tremble with anger 
tt be not the part of a brave man to taunt a prisoner unable to defend -PRON- say then donot force -PRON- with -PRON- question 
do the king know i be here 
-PRON- be here by -PRON- order 
then -PRON- have poison -PRON- mind against -PRON- have simply tell -PRON- the truth and -PRON- have draw -PRON- own conclusion 
what be to be do with -PRON- 
what should have be do when -PRON- and -PRON- comrade first show yourself in the land 
-PRON- add laconically death by oyd 
i sink down on the stone slab 
when 
i ask after a moment 
in two hour 
where 
here in this cell 
-PRON- impending doom strange as -PRON- may seem have a quieting effect upon -PRON- nerve 
what of the kingdom i ask 
-PRON- and will live to the end of time under the reign of the almikboazar 
the chur be all enslave and the great ziff have flee to the unknown 
heaven be praise for that 
the professor be successful in -PRON- attempt to save the land 
the weapon that work the havoc be turn upon -PRON- foe 
small credit to this professor of yours 
-PRON- and -PRON- introduce the evil so -PRON- be -PRON- business to stamp -PRON- out if -PRON- could 
-PRON- be safe 
i ask 
yes -PRON- and the other two 
-PRON- will be give safe conduct to the ice wall 
i -PRON- return to the country -PRON- fate will be -PRON- 
leave -PRON- in peace say will -PRON- have more peace with a light -PRON- sneer have bring -PRON- one 
one of the slave carry two luminous globe 
at a signal from the count -PRON- lay one of the globe on the floor say zylox with a grim laugh a hour and pass out with -PRON- attendant 
the door be secure and again leave alone 
the light however make -PRON- situation more endurable 
even when confront by death a man mind will deal with trivial thing 
i marvel at the luminous globe for -PRON- be not feed with oil nor have -PRON- a wick 
-PRON- resemble a sphere of glass but if -PRON- be glass -PRON- be the first speciman of -PRON- i have see in nyll 
i walk to the globe bent over -PRON- and pick -PRON- up 
something white lie under -PRON- 
hastily i put down the globe and possess -PRON- of the object 
-PRON- be a bit of fold linen 
i unfold -PRON- and find that -PRON- bear queer mark upon -PRON- surface make with a yellow pigment long and earnestly i study the mark but could make nothing of -PRON- 
i turn the square of linen upside down and still the character be not legible 
suddenly a thought strike -PRON- and i remove the talk ring 
i have find the key to the situation for the word be write in english and of course i could not read -PRON- while think in nyll keep a stiff upper lip captain 
-PRON- friend have not abandon -PRON- will be with -PRON- presently 
the note be unsigned but i know -PRON- must come from prebble 
the light bearer have be bribe to lay down the note with the glohe 
hope revive in -PRON- breast although for the life of -PRON- i could not understand how get out of the dungeon would save -PRON- from impend doom 
after escape from the palace i would still have to leave the kingdom and to do that unseen in the broad glare of that long day would be impossible 
for some time i continue to rack -PRON- brain with doubt 
then again come the creak of the door and prebble stand before -PRON- 
-PRON- also be cladin a new tunic and through the lense of -PRON- spectacle -PRON- eye beam encouragingly 
i rush to -PRON- and catch -PRON- by both hand 
prebble 
i exclaim 
how have vou manage to come tome lord nyli request -PRON- of the king as a personal favor -PRON- answer 
the king be determine on -PRON- death -PRON- be adamant 
if that flask of bourbon be to be blame for -PRON- -PRON- be strange the rest of vou be not here with -PRON- 
-PRON- be not on account of the flask of bourbon captain 
the rest of -PRON- have not dare to make love to princess yima 
then as i expect zylox be the move force agamst -PRON- 
not only zylox but the whole lord nylis 
-PRON- regret the occurrence but -PRON- have make -PRON- -PRON- friend and -PRON- stand by -PRON- 
what of the princess 
i smile 
-PRON- stand by -PRON- too and there have be stormy time in the palace the princess entreat -PRON- father to spare -PRON- and -PRON- father only wish -PRON- have nine life like a cat so -PRON- could take -PRON- all 
-PRON- have commit a very heinous offense captain 
l could not help -PRON- nor would i have help -PRON- if i could like -PRON- 
but i must not squander anything so valuable as time at the present moment 
plan have be make to rescue -PRON- 
to get -PRON- out of the palace 
yes 
what will -PRON- avail 
suppose i do get out of the palace what then 
must i hide -PRON- somewhere until the long night while all nyll sleep hardly 
griffyn have construct a new balloon construct a balloon 
i gasp 
that be -PRON- 
-PRON- have make -PRON- out of a royal cloth weave from thread spin byspider 
griffyn have really do remarkably well 
the structure use as a distillery form -PRON- workroom and while -PRON- be ostensibly assist pollock in the manu facture of spirit -PRON- be really construct this airship 
-PRON- utilize what material -PRON- could take from the wreck of the old balloon and the result be most creditable 
the bag be now be inflate in an open space near where the distillery use to be 
the gin mill have be burn to the ground -PRON- know and there be not a drop of elixir to be have anywhere in the kingdom 
will griffyn feeling as -PRON- do toward -PRON- take -PRON- with -PRON- 
i inquire doubtfully 
misfortune have draw -PRON- all together captain and feeling toward -PRON- have undergo a hange 
besides i insure -PRON- assage in the agreement 
what agreement balloon be not of much use without gas 
griffyn could make the balloon but -PRON- could not make the gas 
i have do that in return for the privilege of -PRON- be allow to go with -PRON- in the airship 
and the balloon be beinr inflate -PRON- say 
-PRON- will be ready for uce by the time -PRON- be ready to use -PRON- 
but i be to meet -PRON- fate within two hour 
-PRON- laugh 
so -PRON- be but not in the way -PRON- imagine 
now listen captain shortly after i leave a slave will come to -PRON- with food 
when -PRON- go out -PRON- will accompany -PRON- 
-PRON- understand and there will be notrouble 
when -PRON- part from the chur some one else will take -PRON- in charge 
that be all 
-PRON- be think that i have come to say good by to -PRON- so i must ng or suspicion will be arouse not hnfrer too lo say do everything i be tell to do pfessmg hand 
prebble go away and i pace the confine of the dungeon impatiently while wait for the chur with whom i be to depart 
-PRON- come in due course nervous to a degree and frighten almost out of -PRON- wit by the part -PRON- be plave 
through damp and tortuous underground passage i be conduct until -PRON- seem as though -PRON- have traverse several mile of labyrinth 
when -PRON- reach the end -PRON- be at a flight of stone step lead upward 
the chur ascend the step and push at an iron door 
after some effort -PRON- succeed in throw the door open and daylight penetrate the gloom 
as the slave stand on the topmost step i see hand reach over and lie a golden chain around -PRON- neck 
-PRON- face quiver with joy and -PRON- kiss the hand before -PRON- be withdraw 
then -PRON- beckon -PRON- and stand aside while i pass up and out 
the exit let -PRON- out of door grove stretch around -PRON- and i could see no one not even the person who have confer the gold necklace upon the chur 
i turn to question the slave by sign but -PRON- have disappear cover the spot where i have gain the surface from below and so nicely be the door fit into the turf that no eye could detect -PRON- presence 
as i stand wait i hear a soft voice captain

on the crest of the hill arise the fzur ruin wall of distillery and near the walle be the huge swaying bulk of the balloon 
in the sunlight the great globe look like frost silver 
about the basket i could see the form of prebble griffyn and pollock look down on -PRON- with frantically wave arm 
what be the matter with -PRON- i be ask -PRON-

save cry prebble jubilantly tell -PRON- that when -PRON- leave the dungeon captain -PRON- would meet -PRON- fate 
ylma smile and hold out -PRON- hand to -PRON- do not think of -PRON- word in this light say take the little hand in mine think the lot of -PRON- have have a time of -PRON- say griffyn 
so -PRON- have -PRON- hearty i return well that end well may i look over captain ask ylma 
certainly -PRON- may say and i hold -PRON- arm about -PRON- while -PRON- take a final look at -PRON- country and -PRON- people 
when -PRON- turn to mea moment later there be a smile of joy on -PRON- lip and tear of sorrow in -PRON- eye 
the wind favor -PRON- return southward say griffyn 
if nothing unforeseen happen -PRON- shall reach the land beyond the ice wall before the griffyn pause 
-PRON- could not calculate the ienzth of time that would be require for crossinz the kingdom and the frozen plain beyond 
l can make no guess about the length of time necessary to place -PRON- in comfort and safety say -PRON- but the present breeze seem to be as strong or strong than the wind that carrizd -PRON- north 
how many hour be -PRON- in the air on the other occasion inquire prebble 
-PRON- be twentyfive hour professor 
from the time -PRON- leave the spot where the balloon be inflate until pollock and i land in the parachute 
then by tomorrow if this wind hold and nothing go wrong with the gas bag -PRON- should be among the settlement say i yes nod griffyn donot think anything will go wrong with the balloon 
-PRON- hasbeen strongly construct and if the professor have furnish -PRON- with a good brand of gas -PRON- should make a landall safely and quickly 
-PRON- and the professor have do exceedingly well griffyn say approvingly 
the englishman laugh 
-PRON- life depend on -PRON- effort and -PRON- may be sure that -PRON- labor like a lot of bally slave 
-PRON- try to think of everythingfood water ballast and good warm clothing against -PRON- passage over the ice field have not have time as yet to note the equipment of the car 
now however i take occasion to look around -PRON- and find that -PRON- be snugly ensconce amony many package regret exceedingly say i that -PRON- be oblige to resort to so much violence in get away 
the nyllite and the chur get -PRON- whack return griffyn easily 
-PRON- life be at stake sali and -PRON- could not be expect to stand on ceremony 
-PRON- voice take on a note of reproach as -PRON- add -PRON- affection for the be hardly wise 
but for that there would have be no violence and no trouble 
-PRON- will kindly leave the princess out of the question i answer -PRON- sharply maintain however say -PRON- steadily that -PRON- be well that -PRON- leave -PRON- princess behind that i demand think i have not hear aright 
-PRON- would have be a calamity for all concerned have -PRON- bring princess ylma away with -PRON- 
nyll be -PRON- home and the nyllite be -PRON- people 
-PRON- would not thrive in a foreign land and to spirit -PRON- away be hardly the fair thing for the kingdom 
i stare at the man 
-PRON- could talk in that inexplicable strain with the princess in the car with -PRON- 
from -PRON- i turn to the professor 
-PRON- dear captain say prebble commiseratingly i be quite of opmion 
-PRON- do well to leave princess ylma behind -PRON- be unhurt in spite of the violent scene -PRON- both pass through and let -PRON- hope -PRON- will soon forget -PRON- and turn a more favoring cye upon zylox 
i turn to look toward the place where the princessmy princesswa stand 
-PRON- smile brightly at -PRON- and i whirl upon the professor and griffyn 
be -PRON- mad i shout 
or be -PRON- talk of leave the princess behind when -PRON- be here with -PRON- in plain view of all of -PRON- 
speak ylma 
i ask look around at -PRON- 
-PRON- be quite true captain ylma answer softly be with -PRON- and shall always be with -PRON- 
there 
i exclaim triumphantly 
griffyn and prebble merely smile at mesmile tolerantly and kindly trust with all -PRON- heart say prebble i ill will come to nylis for the aid -PRON- give s 
-PRON- have powerful friend at court speak up the princess and -PRON- lordship can not be harm 
to -PRON- anger and surprise no one in the car aside from -PRON- pay any attention to the princess word 
i begin to experience a bewderlng sensation a sensation which fill -PRON- with an astonishment that remain even to this day 
i step to the side of ylma speak to -PRON- i try to touch -PRON- with -PRON- hand 
where -PRON- have stand -PRON- be not the word i address to -PRON- receive no answer the hand i put forth touch only space 
where be -PRON- shout angrily 
what have -PRON- do with -PRON- 
griffyn 
prebble 
what have become of princess ylma 
i be angry for feel that some trick have be play upon -PRON- 
in -PRON- bewilderment and wrath i lay hand upon griffyn 
instantly -PRON- and prebble and pollock seize -PRON- in a fierce grip and while the car sway with the struggle i be bear down upon the bale and package double up in the confined space and hold by sheer force 
be the victim of a plot 
what plot could there be which prebble always loyal could take part against -PRON- 
suddenly a weight seem lift 
something snap in -PRON- brain or else the two end of a mental chain be reunite with a flashing as of live wire 
-PRON- anger fall from -PRON- and -PRON- lift hand drop nerveless 
what be -PRON- man try to do 
i mnqure 
thank heaven exclaim prebble 
lie will be all right now griffyn 
let hin sleep 
and somehow i do sleep 
i have now come to a part of this chronicle which have always be a mystery to -PRON- 
the event surround the escape from the land of nyll and especially those which have to do with the princess at that time have fade into the wraek leave by a weirdand in many respect a delightfuldream 
when i open -PRON- eye after fall asleep in the car i experience a disagreeable feeling of cold and discomfort 
griffyn prebble and pollock swathe in heavy garment be release bag of ballast with -PRON- mittene hand 
have -PRON- ballast enough 
i hear prebble inquire think so professor griffyn answer 
-PRON- see i have count upon the effect the frigid air over the ice field would have on the gas in the envelope 
the only way to counteract the loss of buoyancy be by hurl ballast out of the car 
therefore i make the balloon large and equip -PRON- with plenty of sandbag 
where be the princess demand sit up 
pollock have as little interest in -PRON- as i have inhim 
-PRON- keep to -PRON- work without pay the slight attention griffyn and prebble however face around and give -PRON- encouraging smile 
if -PRON- donot feel warm enough captain say prebble wrap another bearskin around -PRON- 
this climate be vastly different from that of nyll 
but where be the princess 
i persist 
safely in the palace i make no doubt and i hope there be peace between -PRON- and -PRON- father and that count zylox be find favor 
-PRON- be a worthy gentleman in spite of the fact that -PRON- have -PRON- difference and -PRON- deserve the good of fortune 
i look around the car confuse and wonder e knock zylox off -PRON- lordship car with the gorr plate i observe be when -PRON- find -PRON- wait for -PRON- instead of lord nyli 
-PRON- be no insignificant blow i can tell -PRON- 
the professor cackle 
then captain -PRON- have leave with -PRON- a memento say -PRON- 
probably -PRON- will not treasure -PRON- will -PRON- not tell -PRON- what have become of the princess beg pass a mittened hand over -PRON- brow 
-PRON- remember bound up the rock carry princess ylma in -PRON- arm ask the professor remember that yes i answer eagerly 
and do -PRON- remember that griffyn and pollock come to -PRON- rescue just as a chur have knock -PRON- flat with a blow from behind remember about griffyn and pollock but i be not strike down by the chur 
blank astonishient cross the professor face 
i proceed to recite the progress of event from that point 
-PRON- be pollock who bowl over the chur 
then griffyn help -PRON- carry yima to the balloon and -PRON- place -PRON- in the basket 
-PRON- tumble in after -PRON- 
-PRON- prebble be standine on the rim of the basket a knife in vour haud and the moment -PRON- be all aboard -PRON- slash a rope in twain and the balloon sail away into spacc 
the chur fling a shower of spear afier -PRON- but -PRON- fall short 
zylox be below and -PRON- face be the last one i see that i can distinctly remember 
ylma be with usthere can be no doubt on that score 
-PRON- want to take a final look at the kingdom of nyl as ve sweep over -PRON- and i remember steady -PRON- as hc peer over the edge of the basket 
pollbck have look around in considerable astonishment 
prebble and griffyn be exchange puzzle look face be first to clear 
why say -PRON- with a laugh from the mompent griffyn and pollock go to -PRON- rescue captain -PRON- fancy have be play weird prank 
-PRON- prove -PRON- add jubilantly -PRON- theory regard the irresponsible of the mind north of the arctic circle be correct mean to say cry protestingly that i imagine all that about -PRON- escape with the princess exactly that say prebble 
what really happen captain be this -PRON- be wait for -PRON- at the balloon and -PRON- hardly think -PRON- possible for -PRON- to get clear of -PRON- enemy 
but -PRON- do manage to force a way through -PRON- by leave the road and take to the wood 
ve see -PRON- hard beset climb the rock with the princess in -PRON- arm griffyn and pollock sally out to do what -PRON- could 
just as -PRON- reach -PRON- a chur floor -PRON- with a blow 
-PRON- fall and the princess drop from -PRON- arm 
griffyn and pollock could not bear away both -PRON- and the princess so -PRON- pick -PRON- up and carry -PRON- to the balloon 
-PRON- be half daze and wholly irrational 
the princess be not here but -PRON- insist on talk to -PRON- just as though -PRON- be here 
-PRON- grow angry when -PRON- try to explain and -PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to use force 
while -PRON- be hold -PRON- down -PRON- seem to recover -PRON- wit but the delusion regard the princess have not be dispel 
i trust i have make that matter clear to -PRON- now however canot understand -PRON- i mutter 
although i could not understand yet i be force to accept explanation princess be not in the car 
this one fact prove -PRON- in error would almost as readily think that -PRON- experience in the land of nyll and among the chur be equally a product of -PRON- imagination say not at all speak up griffyn for -PRON- have the testimony of the rest of -PRON- to adduce in prooi 
that blow on the head deal by the chur be what do the business for -PRON- sali have no recollection of -PRON- 
-PRON- head be bandage 
that ought to be suflicient proof even though the hurt be cause -PRON- no discomfort 
i be conscious then of a throbbing at the back of -PRON- head joke of -PRON- all be cackle the professor that the captain knock coitat zylox off the oyd car with a love letter from the princess 
that letter be impress in a block of carnelian and weigh a pound 
griffyn smile and pollock laugh outright 
i lean back against the framework of the car and wonder if i have really recover -PRON- sense 
-PRON- romance with the princess have come to a most unsatisfactory conclusion 
-PRON- heart be deeply involved and the disappointment be bitter 
prebble see how hard i take the affair knelt down beside -PRON- 
let -PRON- assure -PRON- captain say -PRON- that -PRON- be well the affair end in this way 
i shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- go on with -PRON- reason -PRON- be good that princess ylma should remain in -PRON- own land among -PRON- own people 
good for -PRON- and good for the kingdom 
the line of the boazar end with ylma 
have -PRON- bear the princess away the kingdom would indeed have have cause to consider -PRON- demon of destruction 
-PRON- may find -PRON- hard to reconcile -PRON- to the fact now but in year to come -PRON- will be glad the matter turn out as -PRON- have 
i keep -PRON- head howe in gloomy silence besides proceed prebble -PRON- have leave behind -PRON- a few good fricnd 
if the princess remam to mtercede for them7for lord nvli particularly -PRON- may console -PRON- with a wellgrounded hope that -PRON- will not suffer for arde in -PRON- escape 
then there be -PRON- word come in startled tone from griffyn 
prebble scramble to -PRON- foot and jomed griffyn who be look excitedly over the rim of the basket 
pollock also be contain -PRON- only with great diffculty 
glory cry the professor exultantly 
look captain 
see who be below 
some of -PRON- eskimo guide as live and with -PRON- be several of the crew 
rom the ship 
here be something to take -PRON- mind off the amazing tangle in which -PRON- have become mvolve 
scramble erect lean on the rim of the car and look down be perhaps five hundred foot in the atr and only maintain that height by the expenditure of vast quantity of ballast 
below and a littie way to the south be dog sledge cap high with provision 
around the sledge be the eskimo and in front of the lead sledze stand the furclad man from the ship 
i recognize lieutenant corson -PRON- second in command and bentnick -PRON- doctor 
-PRON- be on the way to the ice cap say wave -PRON- hand to the startled man below 
after the eskimo get back to the ship corson lose no time in start out make a landing griffyvn -PRON- and pollock say i turn to prebble and grip -PRON- hand 
-PRON- danger be nearly over with prebble say soon be aboard ship and under the flag 
which put -PRON- a long step toward home cry the professor delightedly wonder where -PRON- ship be pollock ask griffyn of -PRON- secretary 
heaven know 
pollock answer 
-PRON- be welcome to sail south with -PRON- griffyn and -PRON- pollock say -PRON- accept -PRON- offer sali return griffrn heatily 
-PRON- may need -PRON- testimony to substantiate -PRON- claim 
-PRON- can help -PRON- there 
-PRON- catch the valve cord 
stand at the edge of the basket i watch while -PRON- settle slowly toward the gleam plain of white 
almost that princess ylma be beside -PRON- and almost i could hear -PRON- voice give -PRON- final message -PRON- be quite true captain i be with -PRON- and shall always be with -PRON- 
-PRON- be a message for -PRON- alone and treasure -PRON- as a promise
