by rancher joe burnie was no hand with a sixgun and his skunkaroo enemy ben grute was a gunman who was as sharp as a tack
there had to be a showdown because joe wouldnot run away even though his staying would mean deathand then suddenly joe burnie discovered other ways to be literally a fighter sharp as a tack himself on the prod was like a thunderhead riding up to darken the sunbathed new mexi co hills
dismounting where his pard and neighbor joe burnie was starting con struction on a new adobe house lanky irishman wore a dark expression on his face and a colt on his hip
considering that tim omara was a man who wore a smile habitually and a sixshooter set dom the signs were ominous
joe tim grimly announced without preamble ben grute has shot an kilt our hereford bull an goin to kill ben grute
stocky sandyhaired joe burnie was younger than tim omara but more levelheaded and contained
he didnot blow up although he and tim sweated and denied themselves equally in order to buy that blooded bull and six heifers aimed to raise breeders and improve the small range herd they ran pooled on their adjoining spreads
loss of the bull was a bard blow yet joe accepted it with cold eyed calmness and customary grave deliberation while thinking it over
this mawnin tim irately elaborated rode upcrick to see after the here fords an found a section of our fence pulled down
the bull was dead over on side of the fenceline
how dyou know grute done it
joe questioned levelly
whoinell else woulda
tim chal lenged
them three pulqueswillin breeds who run mangy sheeps an cattle while he loafs in sierrita or rides gun trails they wouldnotve
be sides grate woulda wanted the fun of doin sech a stinkin job hissef
joe burnie looked at the stacks of cured dobe bricks ready to form the house he and judy ward would occupy when it was built and they were married
scowling uneasily he looked back at tim and stated you canot go gunnin for grute tim a killer an when crowded i cn be one too
tim snarled
an it ainot your place to deal with him joe went on we know grute nev er had a chance with judy ward but he hates my guts because she took up with me when i come here
now that its been announced that judy an me are goin to be married aimin to raise hell with us outa sheer spite an meanness why he kilt our bull an so its up to me to handle the settlin up
since yuh put er thetaway tim grudgingly agreed allow the first licks yours
but how do you aim to go about takin it
not with a sixgun joe declared ainot no shucks with one an wouldnot try makin settlement with one if i was
just what grute hopes do giv in him a chance to kill me
i blieve in law an order tim an so goin to the law an ask for an arrest of grute then ask for damages ask an yuhll git nawthin tim snorted
but go ahead
after yuhve wasted time try grute in colt court truculence forbade further ar gument
silent joe got his horse
his sixgun a battered relic he never packed anyhow he left behind in his cabin when he and tim jogged away toward the town of sierrita
packing a beltgun in volved risk of gunplay joe figured
he wished tim would shuck his hardware silence of siesta hour cloaked sierrita when joe and tim rode in
as they racked their horses at one edge of the plaza joe glanced over toward the store where judy ward worked hoping she hadnot seen them ride in
apparently she hadnot and joe was glad because he didnot want to have to tell her why theyd come to town until after things had been settled
no use worrying judy unnecessarily he fig ured
poor kid shed had too many wor ries anyhow since her fatherd died and shed had to sell their little ranch to level the debts hed left
grute pestering after her had been her biggest worry and she feared the man
judy ward wasnot the only one who was afraid of ben grute who left his coyote spread for his breed hands to run while he stayed in sierrita gambling drink ing and roughhandling the darkskinned senoritas
a majority of the populace feared grute whod killed two men here on his own stomping grounds and whose gun was for hire away from there
strangers would hit town and talk to him or hed receive a letter and then grute would ride out
when he returned hed be wellheeled with cash and would make bragging reference to a gunslinging job hed done in texas new mexico or ari zona
so folks in sierrita had reason to fear ben grute
walking over to the west side of the square joe and tim looked into the office of jose garcia a dealer in mohair wool and hides
as a sideline garcia was a deputy sheriff the only law in that part of the county
finding the office empty tim said be in cantina an likely be there too
no gunplay mind you joe admon ished
tim grunted sourly as they headed for entering they found garcia his big paunch pressed against the bar talk ing to the lame owner
as tim had pre dicted grate was also in the dingy place
a glass of aguardiente at his elbow a cigar between his thin lips he sat over a game of solitaire at a table against the wall
a big devil who affected foxed buok skin clothing and wore his black hair long and his sixgun lowandtied grute looked up and sneered at joe and tim
tim twisted his lips back at grute but joe ignoring him stepped up to garcia and said want to swear out a warrant against grute there
he shot an killed our hereford bull
eh ees thees
instantly un happy and apprehensive the deputy turned his fat face toward the man at the table
taking the cigar out of his mouth grute spat damn right i shot the bellerin devil
yesterday on the way to my sheep camp i heard snuffun snortun an bawlin
i rode up to find that here ford had busted down the fence an was killin one of my range bulls
when i tried to stop im he come at my horse so i shot the damn critter
i was on my own range garcia an within my rights an any sons wantin to say diffrunt can have their dealins direct with me
so make er direct by callin yuh a liar
tim erupted
our fences exter strong along yuhr line
i claim yuh pulled it down then run our bull acrost onto yuhr range an shot im
tim i warned you not to start noth in joe barked
peace senores garcia croaked the law command eet lust fired snaky eyes as he leaped to his feet but he made no play for his gunpartly because of garcia but mostly because tim was ready to fight
grute never tackled a man who was set for trouble if he could avoid it
no matter what gunswift edge he held grute preferred to wait stack the deck all in his favor and name the time for turning the cards would grute weesh to tear down the fence an keel your bool like you say
garcia arched his bushy brows at joe
they ainot got no proof it was like that grute jeered
garcia eyed joe questioningly
his ex pression bitter joe shook his head
pat ently relieved garcia declared seence there ees no proof the bool donot try to gore grute can be no warrant issued an no arrest
you geet proof i geet warrant
meantime i must bid you adios amigos an tell you to keep the peacefulness
garcia showed them a broad stern as he turned and waddled out
watching him go tim growled wal joe i told yuh so
an tell you somethun omara grute snarled as he stepped close to tim
just because too yaller to pack a sixgun an do his own fightin it donot mean you can horn in for him call me a liar an get away with it
as he spoke grute raised his left hand and shook his finger under nose and joe tried to step around tim and get between him and grute
driving joe back with a hard thrust of one elbow tim raged at grute damn yuh stop shakin yuhr finger under my nose an draw
simultaneous with the sounds of palms slapping gunbutts and leather grute lunged and drove the heel of his upraised left hand against chest
it was doubtful that tim even under the best circumstances could have begun to have matched gunspeed
now stag gered backward and off balance caught flat by foul trick he hadnot the ghost of a show
his colt had barely cleared leather when the blast of sixshooter jarred the cantina
tim rocked back teetered on his heels dropped his colt and pressed both hands against his chest vacant eyed his knees suddenly buckled and he plunged forward to the floor
through a little swirl of gunsmoke joe looked down at tim then up at grute eyes were glazed by sudden grief and the damning realization that tim was dead
the wolfish killers ex pression on face maddened joe
an animal cry on his lips ignoring the colt in hand joe sprang at him
grute struck out with the sixgun lay ing the barrel along forehead
blood gushing from a long gash above one eye stunned joe dropped to his knees
next time we meet youd better be packin a iron or give you a pistolwhippin you wonot likely live over grute snarled at joe as jose garcia and several townsmen came hightailing in
madre de dios
garcia cried tell you to be peaceable
that loco omara drawed first grute grunted
looking over at cojo across the bar he added that right
speak up
cojo gave grute a stare of dislike
but cojo was lame and old and thoughtful of his own welfare
regretfully cojo an swered si
sleeving blood off his face swaying on widespread legs joe croaked grute tricked
tim garcia
i tried to stop things but tim elbowed me back
then grute pulled his shovin trick on tim tried to stop him from drawin an gettin hisself killed grute grunted as he went back to his table and picked up his drink
gripping arm garcia led him doorward
regretfully he said sabe theengs but wat can i do
notheeng
so better now you go away from grute
i weel have omara took to the onder taker
joe moved through the crowd outside and cut across the plaza toward the doctors
from the doorway of the store where she worked judy ward saw him
a darkhaired girl with a pulseaccelerating figure judy ran to him crying joe are you badly hurt hap pened to you
what happened in the cantina before joe could answer the doctor emerged from his office his kit in hand
seeing joe blood streaming down his face he came toward him asking burnie does anyone in need me
no joe intoned
tim there but you canot help him doc
that sneakin grute killed tim an it was my fault
judy gasped but said nothing as they went into the doctors office
there pre paring to attend injury the doctor said joe if you want to talk tell judy what happened go ahead
joe told about the bull and subsequent events then said so ysee judy its my fault dead
if been packin a gun i coulda sided him
i shoulda listened to him in the first place an known it was loco to run to the law
now that learned that its too late to do tim any goodbut not too late for me to try to finish what he started
such was bitterness he didnot even seem to notice it when the doctor stitched the gash above his eye
now while the doctor fastened a bandage in place judy caught hold of hand and gently protested but joe death wasnot your fault
if tim hadnot been carrying a gun thered have been no gun battle
if he hadnot lost his temper in hadnot elbowed you away hed not have been killed
so you see joe it couldnot be your fault
mebbe not joe bleakly conceded
but if packed my sixgun i couldve at leastve tried tove held up my end to day
and grute would have killed you judy said what he wants
if hed seen no safe chance against both you and tim hed have waited until he created a situation to his liking
yeah joe growled awaited
he wonot quit judy so goin to get my gun an face the son an get it over with
nonsense the doctor snapped dazed from the blow and the shock of sudden death
you listen to judy man the matter of the bull bein killed
joe persisted
and not a shred of proof that grute did it illegally the doctor said as with a meaning glance at judy he turned and left the room
alone with joe judy put her arms around his neck and kissed him
joe she begged for my sake let grute alone hurry our marriage
after that sure grute wonot bother us any more plea the unshed tears glistening in her eyes and the urgent yielding of her young body in arms broke his stubborn resolve
after all judy and the doctor likely were right and a long life on a sunday morning some two weeks after tim omara had been buried in grave yard when judy rode out to spend the day with joe
throughout those two weeks he had spent most of his time rush ing the new house toward completion been able to do that because it was the slack season and ben grute wasnot around to be watched out for
the day after shooting tim grute had ridden off somewhere to do a paid job of killing
judy was surprised to find the walls up and the window and doorframes in
going through the house she tried to be gay as she decided how shed place the fur niture but her gaiety was forced
final ly unable to pretend any longer she blurted joe you must be careful
grute returned to sierrita yesterday then rode on out to his spread
garcia brought me that news and said to warn you
so
joe grunted
then i reckon better go haze back any stock that mighta drifted to the fenceline
wanta ride along
getting his horse joe led the way suddenly started shaking and his stomach began to roll over as the reaction of his first killing seized him ward onto range now since he and tim had been pards and tim had no living kin
riding through juniper and pifion they came to a lush creekside mead ow where a few steers grazed
looking them over joe rasped them hereford heifers was here two days ago now with judy was better than an eternity in boothill
joe yielded groaning all right
but i tell you now i donot think waitins any good
grute wonot rest until weve had er out gone an they didnot just drift off by themsefs
see them tracks
judy whitefaced nodded but said nothing as they followed the tracks of the six herefords and a shod horse up out of the meadow and to the fenceiine
there three fenceposts and the wire be tween was flat or the ground and the tracks crossed there likely find em all dead over there joe snarled going with you judy stated
and donot tell me i canot
joe shrugged and they rode across the line onto range following the tracks into a draw
a little ways along it turned sharply and they came up against a barrier of freshly cut timber that held herefords corraled in the draw above it donot savvy this joe muttered wonder what the you doin on my range
judy gave an involuntary cry
together she and joe reined their horses around and faced ben grute whod slid down into the draw behind them
hands on hips grute eyed joe balefully
you know what doin joe answered flatly
you ran my heifers up here so have to come onto your range didnot you
they huntin that bull grute jeered
an since you brung judy along to perfect you maybe shell help pay the fee for them grazin on my range a buck a day apiece an i ag ger they been here all the fifteen days i been gone
you ainot cuttin no such rusty on me joe stonily stated
dismounting he walked up and began pulling the brush aside
damn you burnie grute snarled as he walked toward joe who faced the taller heavier man with fists raised
since youre too yaller to pack a gun like i warned you to an you got judy here to ride herd on you i reckon there ainot much i can do this time
so take your damn critters an get to hell yonderly
lowering his fists joe turned toward the barrier
grute hit him then his left fist opening the barely healed gash above eye right fist slamming against temple
lights and fierce pain flash ing in his head joe went down
he gasped as grute kicked him in theribs rolled away and got up weaving dizzily
he swung a feeble blow at grute as the lat ter charged him and again joe hit the ground
after that joe had no idea how many cutting blows he took nor how many times he staggered up and was knocked down until he was unable to rise again
grute he heard judy screamand heard a rifle crack
grute one foot lifted to grind his boot heel into face jerked back as the bullet from the rifle judy had gotten oat of saddle boot sang over his head
grute drew his breath in sharply
the desperate expression on face told him that she would put the next slug through him if she had to shoot again
all right grute barked
take your weaklin an get off my range
an donot think i ainot holdin this agin you you heifer
climbing out of the draw grute got his horse out of the scrub and rode away
sitting up joe groaned ainot half a man
i donot do nothin when grute kills tim an now youve had to save my hide
lifting her divided skirt judy ripped off part of her underskirt and knelt be side joe using it to wipe away the blood streaming down his terribly beaten face
hush she rebuked him
grute resort ed to treachery to beat you even though hes larger than you
he tricked you just as he tricked tim and other men hes killed
helping joe to his feet judy had to lead him to his horse because his eyes were swelling shut
tearing down the brush barrier then she took to her own saddle and drove the herefords back onto range as she headed joe for sier rita and the doctor two days before joe could see and two more before he left his bed in a hotel room in town
during that time judy laid off from work and attended him and she was there when the doctor let joe get up
now watching stiff progress around the room the doctor said joe youre a lucky jasper
your cracked rib and battered face will soon heal and then youll be as good as ever
an what goods that
joe bleakly de manded
joe the doctor counseled picking up his medicine kit think like that become embittered against your self
when the doctor had gone judy came to joe and put her arms around him
after lightly kissing his battered lips she said joe honey the doctors rightyou mustnot become bitter
why after you sell out here and we settle somewhere else youll forget this
sell out
joe laughed and it sound ed like cold wind blowing through a tomb sell what tim left an high tail
not me judy
i ainot got to the point where run away from grute
but wed be better off somewhere else judy protested
would weknowin that rabbited joe shook his head
besides thiss where i want to stay an where i will stayeither on top of the ground or six feet under it
then what do you mean to do joe
judy quavered
right now he answered goin out an see to things on the spread likely be back in a couple of days or so
telling judy solong joe got his horse out of the feed barn eased himself stiffly into the saddle and rode out of town
three days later happening to be look ing out through the store window judy saw him ride back in
watching him rack his horse she was relieved to see that he packed no gun
since joe wasnot heeled judy figured that he hadnot come in to have a showdown with grute have felt less easy had she known that old singleaction was in one of his saddlebags
grossing the plaza joe entered the office of nabor andrade lawyer and justice of the peace
there taking the chair andrade offered he announced want you to fix me up a will andrade gave joe a shrewd glance
the lines of determination around mouth and the dull tone of finality in his voice didnot escape the lawyer
heavily he sat down at his desk and wrote as joe dictated a will that left worldly pos sessions to judy
when the will was finished and signed joe arose and said you keep it andrade until its needed
you intend to go after ben grute
andrade surmised
not exactly
joe smiled bleakly aim to strap my cutter on then go where grute is
trust that son to do the rest
why commit suicide playing game
andrade demanded
why not challenge him to fight with rifles or to meet you in the street both of you with your guns already drawn that way you might have some hope of killing that spawn of diablo
grute would accept any such challenge
joe hooted
that cabrone no andrade sourly admitted
but he added you have no chance against him any other way
not only is grute lightningfast with his pis tol but hes as sharp as a tack when it comes to pulling dirty gunfight tricks
yeah sharp as a tack joe echoed
frowning he snapped his fingers suddenly like a man whod remembered something or had hit on a good idea and exclaimed but his sharp trickery might be the hole card i need to give as a haf way even chance in the game
how can that be
andrade wondered
he received no answer because joe was leaving the oifice
watching him go andrade shook his head and wondered if joe hadnot gone a little loco to think that he had a chance in a with grute
as for that joe knew how slim his chances were
but the idea that had come to him did give him a little bit or a chance and that was a lot better than none at all
so pursuing that idea he went from to the hardware store bought a box of carpet tacks and then headed for deputy jose in his chair the dep uty sheriff and hide dealer straight ened up when joe entered his office
wor riedly he said joe eet ees not good that youre een sierrita now
grute ees over een an there weel be trouble eef you ron eento heem him joe brushed worries aside
have you got an ol cowhide one thats no good layin around anywhere
nodding garcia got up and led the way out to a shed in back of his office
point ing at a hide hanging on a hook he indignantly said there ees a torn one some crook put een a bale i bought
when joe then opened his pocket knife and cut a footsquare piece out of the dried tough cowhide garcia was un able to contain his curiosity he begged to know ees eet for a hole card joe told him
an thanks a lot
watching joe walk away garcia like andrade was wondering if joe burnie hadnot gone haywire in the cabeza
had he seen joe as the latter went over to the livery barn and into an empty stall garcia would have sworn that joe was as nutty as a pifion tree
kneeling he laid the square of cowhide on the floor took the box of carpet tacks out of his pocket and began sticking them through the hide
a little later when the hide had been studded with tacks joe left the barn emptyhanded
going back to his horse he got his holstered colt out of the saddle bag and buckled the belt around him
that done he made a cigarette and stood with his head thoughtfully bowed while he smoked
tossing the butt away then he drew a deep breath squared his shoulders and walked down the street to cojo serving two cowpunchers at the far end of the bar scowled apprehensively when joe came in
at his favorite table by the wall grute sat reading an old newspaper
looking up his eyes narrowed when he saw the sixshooter dragging at right hip and then a hun gry wolfish grin spread over his face
rising quickly grute said burnie i wanta see you and stepped over to the bar
well joe grunted you ainot blind are you
you talkin up trouble
grute snarled get it if you donot pay what you owe me for your critters grazin on my range with you
joe burnie hooted
burnie i warn you not to rile me or force me to draw my iron an burn what you owe me out of your hide
so youd bet ter fork over the dinero an ride close herd on your mouth
savvy as he spoke grute raised his left hand and began shaking his finger under nose
that was the move joe had hoped for
bracing himself he leaned a little toward grute and barked we both got guns so stop the gab an grab
grute as they went for their guns stiffened his left arm and rammed the palms of his upraised left hand against chest
for an instant then his features twisting the fluid rhythm of his draw was broken and he jerked as though hed contacted a wire charged with elec tricity
in that split second joe got the break hed played forbut it was barely an even break and nothing more
the guns of both men cleared leather and flashed flame and lead simultaneously
the only difference between them was that grute surprised and upset by the sudden realization that his trick to cinch a surefire kill had boomeranged threw his lead away
his slug tugged at shirt left a welt along left side bullets placed with cold delibera tion smashed chest
a horrible shocked expression on his face staggered by the force of lead grute dropped his sixgun and gripped the rim of the bar
swaying he tried to speak but managed only a wet grunting sound
that sound then became a hideous gurgle and his hold loosening grute col lapsed his body wedging down between the face of the bar and the brass footrail there staring down at ben body joe suddenly started shaking and his stomach began to roll over as the reaction of killinghis first killingseized him
knowing what joe was going through old cojo limped hurriedly along the bar and thrust a bottle of whiskey into hand
dreenk a big dreenk cojo command ed
you be aright
the drink steadied joe stopped shaking when deputy garcia who was followed by the doctor ran panting into the cantina
stopping short when he saw that grute not joe was down garcia beat his fat palms together and cried thees ees ver good
ai bueno
and a good job of shooting joe the doctor said after a hasty examination of the body
but how did you beat his draw
before joe could answer judy rushed into the cantina
tears streaming down her cheeks her relief overwhelmed her when she saw that joe was still among the living
crying his name she flung herself on him before he could prevent it
ohhh squealing judy leaped backward
red lips parted she pressed her hands to her breasts and eyed joe in pained bewilderment
grinning sheepishly joe unbuttoned his shirt untied a rawhide thong and pulled out the tackstudded square of cow hide that had been tied over his chest
offering it to garcia he said my hole card amigo
you savvy now
good gravy one of the cowboys whod witnessed the gunfight exclaimed
so why the son kinda bogged down when he shoved youhe jabbed his paw on the pints of them there tacks
joe nodded got the idea when andrade said that grute was sharp as a tack when it come to dirty tricks
so i dealt me that hole card gamblin that grute would try the same trick on me that he tried on tim all i wanted was an even breakbut wonderin if you folks think it was fair on my part holy smoke
the doctor clapped one hand to his forehead
he gambles his life for an even break then asks us was he fair
but he wouldnot gamble on marrying me before inadvertantly glancing at body judy left her teasing sen tence unfinished
taking hold of arm joe escort ed her out of motioning to the doc tor to come along garcia followed them
outside beyond the crowd around the door judy and joe halted and the doctor and garcia joined them
you say thees sopoor sport wonot marry you eh
garcia sighed and shook his head at judy
ees bad
i like for to geet up a baile an dance een the plaza
a weddeeng would be fine oxcuse
andrade could tie the knot the doctor added
not till our houses finished joe stubbornly demurred
impulsively unmindful of onlookers judy flung her arms around neck pulled his head down and pressed her lips to his
it wasnot a quick kiss nor a cool one either
as the seconds went by ears reddened garcia became slack jawed and the doctor mopped his face with his handkerchief and whistled long and softly
there
breathless and starryeyed judy at last let go of joe
now do you want to wait until our house is finished joe
momma joe exploded that settles it
doc you an garcia come need you for witnesses
grabbing hand then he lit out for nabor on the run
