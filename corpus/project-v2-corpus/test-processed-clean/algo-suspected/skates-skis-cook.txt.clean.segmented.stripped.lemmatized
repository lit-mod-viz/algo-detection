skate ski and a saphead by william wallace cook wide awake magazine volume number jan deeply steep in gloom perfectly describe the condition of young nixon peter 
loneliness and bitter regret pervade -PRON- soul as -PRON- sit by -PRON- on the rear seat of the fly sleigh and thought of what may have be 
-PRON- have reason to believe that -PRON- be the good skater and ski jumper enter in the winter sport contest at lake on the precede afternoon and yet -PRON- have lose both main event by an apparent failure to look well to -PRON- equipment at the last moment 
every one have expect that -PRON- would blunder somewhere and so no one be greatly disappoint that be no on except nixon peter 
almost at the takeoff of the jump one of ski have break 
-PRON- have take a wild header and land in a snow bank with heel in the air 
a big laugh have be the result 
also -PRON- have cast a skate at the critical moment of the skating race and the other contestant have slit past -PRON- porter markham in the lead 
this same porter markham too have win the ski jump 
now porter markham be on the front seat of the sleigh drive blithely and exchange jest and small talk with hesther morton who sit beside -PRON- 
truly nixon line have fall in hard place 
nixon be nix to those who know -PRON- good 
often -PRON- suffer the crowning indignity of be refer to as the saphead 
-PRON- have hear the unlovely nickname apply to -PRON- many time while dig -PRON- out of the snow bank 
-PRON- have punctuate the merriment release by -PRON- sorry mishap 
hesther morton have join in the riot of laughter 
nixon know this only too well for -PRON- be the first person -PRON- have see after dig the snow out of -PRON- eye 
for hesther to be amuse at -PRON- expense well that be something that hurt 
then while seek with dogged resolution to retrieve -PRON- on the steel runner a strap have break ad a skate have shoot off across the glittering ice 
peter have slip and slam around on the course like a crazy curling stone finally cut the foot out from under a fat spectator who call -PRON- saphead right to -PRON- face 
ah what a windup for a sorry afternoon 
peter clench -PRON- hand in -PRON- bearskin glove and crouch down on the rear seat in a fruitless effort to efface -PRON- 
-PRON- be nineteen and porter markham be twenty 
-PRON- both work for uncle sila goddard who have a ranch in montana and make a business of send range horse into north dakota to be halter break and sell to the settler 
goddard be uncle to all -PRON- man in the sense that give an avuncular character to every genial middleage person who look after the welfare of young employee 
in the early summer uncle sila have send a hundred horse into north dakota 
business have not be good and late fall find half the horse still outhand 
these horse be be winter at the morton ranch on marsh hay cut and stack by peter markham and reece bailey who have be send by uncle sila to take care of the horse herd 
when spring come there be a promise of turn off every head of the stock at a good profit 
the winter so far have not be particularly lonely for the montana man 
the snow of december have be light and -PRON- have be possible for th horse to paw out considerable forage in the hill 
january however bring in a good fall of the beautiful and -PRON- have be necessary to corral and shelter the animal and to go extensively into the feeding 
reese bailey uncle foreman find time to play cribbage with lance morton father and peter and nixon acquire leisure for skating and ski popular sport at -PRON- home ranch in the rockie 
a would have be a creek in a country of large through the morton holding and -PRON- glassy surface offer a resistless invitation to the steel runner 
as for the skiing there be plam and hill for run climbing and glissade 
while bailey and morton be busy at -PRON- eternal fifteentwo fifteenfour peter and markham be skate or skiing often with hesther who be fond of both sport 
the girl if appearance be to be believe be rather fond of markham also but have few smile to waste on peter 
in -PRON- bashful blundering way peter try to make -PRON- agreeable to hesther 
-PRON- be big and awkward however and have towcolore hair a slow wit and a few grace of speech or manner 
-PRON- effort to impress hesther be overwhelm by the never fail persiflage and the rakish dress and carriage of handsome porter markham 
markham posesse a confidence in -PRON- that be sublime a confidence that shine brilliantly in contrast with clumsy ineffectiveness of nixon peter 
peter realize this and nourish a bitter grudge against -PRON- physical and mental shortcoming 
-PRON- use to dream of a fire at the ranch in which -PRON- pose as a hero and bear the fair hesther to safety from the ranch house through a furnace of flame 
then in -PRON- vision hi picture the girl as take -PRON- hand and humbly ask -PRON- forgiveness for -PRON- failure to perceive -PRON- sterling quality from the first 
during such moment of illusion the saphead be almost happy 
but the ranch house never take fire and the chance to prove -PRON- a hero by rescue hesther morton be deny by fate 
in however an opportunity present -PRON- through the winter sport at lake 
markham and peter enter -PRON- in the skijumpe context and skate race 
-PRON- drive the fifty mile which separate from the lagke and hesther go with -PRON- to see the carnival of sport and to spend a night or two with relative in lake city 
again peter have dream but now on the homeward drive every hope be shatter and -PRON- long for for a period of blank obscurity and complete retirement 
-PRON- could have declare that one of -PRON- ski have be tamper with and that one of -PRON- skate strap have be all but cut through with the point of a knife 
examination make -PRON- sure of both fact yet -PRON- have not occur to -PRON- to sob 
-PRON- have blunder in not make certain of -PRON- ski and skate beforehand so -PRON- could not see how any one but -PRON- be at fault 
as -PRON- crouch in the back seat of the sleigh -PRON- consider request uncle silas goddard to recall -PRON- to the montana headquarters 
there at last -PRON- would be rid of markham and cut off forever from the demoralizing and disdainful eye of hesther 
yes -PRON- would go back to the home ranch and -PRON- would do this in spite of something which -PRON- know and which be very important to -PRON- future 
-PRON- be common knowledge that a place of preferment be to be give by uncle sila to either peter or to foremanship at a new ranch with a chance to acquire an interest in the horse and cattle 
reece bailey be watch peter and markham and on -PRON- report uncle sila would act 
to retire from the north dakota venture of the ranchowner now would cut peter off entirely from promotion and drop the plum in porter hand 
but peter in the bitterness of -PRON- heart be allow nothing aside form -PRON- own peace of mind to influence -PRON- 
yes -PRON- would ask uncle sila to recall -PRON- to montana 
-PRON- still there nix 
markham suddenly ask ture to look rearward 
peter grunt so blame quiet go on markham with a laugh that i reckon -PRON- may have take another header into the snow back a way on the trail 
hesther join in the laugh and in spirit poor peter writhe 
the short day be close and the sun go down beyond the white horizon in cold glory 
-PRON- be five mile form and markham have drive the horse so hard that -PRON- be nearly fag 
-PRON- breathe wheezingly and frost coated heaving side 
the place drag in spite of relentless use of the whip 
anyhow speak up peter suddenly -PRON- may think of the team a little porter near tucker do this driving cry markham never yet have to ask a saphead for advice in handle horse 
and again the whip fall on the strain flank 
peter clench -PRON- fist in the bearskin glove 
-PRON- occur to -PRON- that -PRON- could lift markham bodily out of the front seat take -PRON- place and do the driving -PRON- but -PRON- do not 
the horse struggle on and in the fall dark the traveler top a rise that give -PRON- a dim view of the building of ranch 
a light show in one of the ranchhouse window like a star and toward -PRON- markham drive and presently halt at the door 
now that handle the rein all the way from lake nix remark markham as -PRON- jump out and help hesther to alight allow -PRON- up to -PRON- to take care of the team 
cold essie 
not a bit the girl answer and hurry toward the door 
markham follow -PRON- and peter drive on to the stable 
as -PRON- unhitch and bring the horse into the shelter -PRON- be a little surprised to discover that there be no other animal in the place 
the team be but cow horse together with those of peter and markham should have be in the stable unless bailey be out oat the corral and shelter shed look after the fifty range horse that be keep up there 
peter light a lantern remove the harness from the horse and after put hay in the manger begin rub the animal down with an old gummy sack 
-PRON- be hard at this when a call reach -PRON- ear from the house peter 
this the jump 
-PRON- be voice and there be a note of alarm in -PRON- that startle peter 
lantern in hand -PRON- hurry out of the stable and make -PRON- way to the house 
fling the door wide -PRON- cross the threshold into the ranchhouse sit room wrong porter -PRON- ask 
the cannonball stove glow with heat 
that and the bright oil lamp dazzle eye for the moment and -PRON- could not see what be go on in the room 
bailey have be hurt come the voice of markham 
every horse in the herd wha be drive off by -PRON- even take mount with the rest 
big outrage that ever happen in these part like to know what the blame country be come to 
the blur lift from before peter eye

mrs morton bend over -PRON- bathe a wound shoulder from a basin of hot water 
-PRON- husband be walk up and down fume and sputtering

take -PRON- team and go to roscommon 
the sheriff get to be notify 
bailey say the thief be make for the north and if -PRON- and markham be quick a posse can get between the gang and the boundary line 
for heavens sake peter wake up 
peter shake -PRON- put down the lantern and come to the side of the couch 
whey donot markham wake up -PRON- ask -PRON- suggest anything yet 
nothing to suggest markham answer flash a sharp look at peter twenty mile to roscommon and no chance of get there ahead of the thief and the steal stock 
the only animal -PRON- can put -PRON- hand on be the two that bring -PRON- from lake and -PRON- be do up 
-PRON- know that peter 
what about use skate or ski inquire peter 
by thunder there be a way of get to roscommon in time to help the sheriff head off the steal stock 
there be a dominant compelling note in the voice of peter 
-PRON- be so unexpected in -PRON- assertiveness that every one in the room be startle 
-PRON- washedout blue eye fence aggressively with the snap black eye of markham 
skate or ski repeat markham -PRON- upper lip curl 
why -PRON- all of thirty mile to roscommon if -PRON- follow the crook of the river 
and how much would -PRON- figure -PRON- by ski if -PRON- cross bear butte instead of go around -PRON- 
talk sense if -PRON- know how nix forget the fellow who rustle -PRON- stock have three hour the lead 
how far will three hour of drive in this snow get the steal herd return peter

the varmint be go north by the long knife dry wash -PRON- say -PRON- voice shake with the pain of -PRON- wound only three mile west of roscommon 
if -PRON- boy could get word to the sheriff somehow i reckon -PRON- may head off the raider with a posse 
but if -PRON- do anything -PRON- will have to do -PRON- quick 
porter and -PRON- eye swerve to markham look to si goddard be look to -PRON- 
nigh on to five thousand dollar worth of horse be be push towards the border and here helpless to do a thing

if -PRON- could round up a crown of man in short order and take after the thief on fresh horse like enough -PRON- may overhaul -PRON- 
but where s the ride stock 
why near neighbor be ten mile away 
peter flash a disapproving glance at markham pull off -PRON- bearskin glove and slump down in a chair by the stove 
from the pocket of -PRON- overcoat -PRON- take -PRON- skate also a new strap -PRON- have secure in lake city 
quickly -PRON- replace the broken strap with the new one 
-PRON- go to try and get to roscommon by river nix 
morton inquire figure the chance be well that way than go over bear butte on ski peter answer 
the river clean of snow and mostly the ice be like a lookingglass 
i be go to do -PRON- good to get word to the sheriff and to start a roscommon doctor this way to look after bailey 
-PRON- be locoed growl markham all right to get a doctor for reese here but there ainot a chance to save the stock this side of the line 
let the raider get -PRON- across the boundary and then take the matter up with the canadian mount police -PRON- advice 
if -PRON- wait till the stock be out of this country put in the rancher there wonot be a chance 
not a chance on earth agree bailey 
that outfit of thief know exactly what -PRON- be about 
everything be cut and dry and somebody sure tip -PRON- off regard the layout here bet a thousand against a chink wash ticket that -PRON- bronk will be take care of across the line sost -PRON- canot be locate by nobody 
-PRON- thief pick a time when i be alone at the shelter shed and porter and nix be to the winter sport at the lake 
-PRON- drop -PRON- out of -PRON- saddle without why s or wherefore and then make off with -PRON- mount and send a man to the stable for peter and ride horse 
by the time i cover the mile back to the ranch house the stock be ell on the way north 
-PRON- break off abruptly clench -PRON- tooth hard as a spasm of pain run through -PRON- body get another coat remark peter rise from -PRON- chair and start for the door that lead to -PRON- room 
-PRON- wonot be possible to make any kind of time in a long overcoat like this 
-PRON- disappear 
markham come to the side of the couch 
if peter have a chance reece say -PRON- hell make a bobble of some kind and spoil -PRON- all -PRON- way 
i better go to roscommon -PRON- 
peter can use -PRON- skate and take the river trail and use -PRON- ski and go over the butte 
i donot think -PRON- have a ghost of snow ahead of the stock but -PRON- up to -PRON- to see what -PRON- can do the talk exclaimed morton approvingly 
the thief have help from this ranch -PRON- add darkly toss a significant glance toward the door through which peter just pass and i havenot get a whole lot of confidence peter be square bailey aver 
square as a die 
-PRON- j donot seem to have the knack for puttin -PRON- idee across 
the man that save -PRON- bronk porter -PRON- add significantly be go to make the big kind of a hit with goddard 
if any one connect with the sheriff at roscommon in time to save the bronk markham return -PRON- will be -PRON- 
-PRON- speak with a confidence that thrill every one in the room and hesther if the red in -PRON- cheek and the sparkle in -PRON- eye be any indication most of all be ready -PRON- finish move toward the door in about two shake 
-PRON- must have some hot coffee before -PRON- start say hesther and see that -PRON- be ready for -PRON- 
markham be back in the room before peter have reappear 
-PRON- wear a leather coat and the bottom of -PRON- trouser be lace inside -PRON- high shoe top 
trim and handsome -PRON- look and ready for a grueling night work 
hesther be just place the coffee on the table and -PRON- lift -PRON- eye to flash a glance of admiration at the young ski runner be ready in a minute essie say markham with a nod and a smile 
take -PRON- ski from a corner of the room -PRON- sit down lay -PRON- across -PRON- knee and proceed to grease -PRON- well from a can which -PRON- have bring into the room and have place on the stove 
while -PRON- work peter come lumber in 
peter have don a ragged sweater whose collar come up around -PRON- ear 
over this be button a faded and threadbare coat 
-PRON- oldfashione skate be under -PRON- arm 
from beneath the rim of -PRON- motheaten fur cap -PRON- tow hair show in a sort of fringe 
the cap have ear flap with string at -PRON- end 
the flap be loose and the string flutter as -PRON- move -PRON- head 
-PRON- shoe be of cowhide strong and serviceable but not at all ornamental 
-PRON- have tie the bottom of -PRON- trouser to -PRON- ankle with piece of cord 
the contrast between peter and markham be very striking 
so far as appearance go markham have -PRON- on peter by about a hundred to one go too nix observe markham lay -PRON- ski to one side go over the butte and get a month pay that say i beat -PRON- into roscommon 
maybe -PRON- will return peter start for the outside door 
there be more bitterness in peters heart 
-PRON- believe -PRON- understand the situation 
markham have win the ski jump and the skating race and now -PRON- want to round off -PRON- triumph by be first to carry the news of the horse thieve to the sheriff 
markham be plan a spectacular bit of work for uncle si goddard incidentally 
mainly -PRON- be think of the effect of -PRON- night success on hesth morton 
wait nixon call mrs morton 
essie have get some hot coffee ready and -PRON- must have a cup before -PRON- leave 
the rancher wife be the only one who ever give much thought to peter 
-PRON- consider -PRON- now when the consideration and confidence of the other seem to center wholly in markham 
much oblige mrs morton peter answer but i donot reckon take the time 
-PRON- see -PRON- add as -PRON- lay a hand on the doorknob a case where every minute count 
before the good woman could answer the door have close behind peter 
markham pull up -PRON- shoulder in a shrug as -PRON- lift the cup of steam coffee first blunder -PRON- remark 
-PRON- have a habit of go -PRON- blind and without give any preparation to the work ahead of -PRON- hope -PRON- wonot meet with any accident murmur mrs morton 
that boy get a good heart even if -PRON- be a little odd always be a blunder and a saphead grunt -PRON- husband 
if the steal horse be recover -PRON- will be markham who make -PRON- possible 
markham do not tarry long over -PRON- coffee 
within a few moment after peter leave -PRON- be out in the nipping air 
hesther a shawl over -PRON- head step through the doorway to watch while -PRON- cross the trampled snow around the ranch house and then knelt to thrust the toe of -PRON- shoe in the bilgeri binding of the ski and to buckle the ankle strap 
-PRON- arise presently and shout a farewell to the girl glide away over the snowy level gracefully swiftly with -PRON- ski stick bite into the snow and propel -PRON- onward do a man work this night murmur hesther and -PRON- will as -PRON- win at lake city carnival 
then -PRON- go back into the house to describe in detail how peter have lose and markham have win in the winter sport contest at the lake 
river have many twist and turn in the thirty mile which -PRON- cover between ranch and roscommon 
pass within a stone throw of the ranch house -PRON- flow almost due north for six mile then enter the rough hill country -PRON- double back on -PRON- course for three mile round the base of bluff in a fourmile curve come east by south around the base of bear butte and then curve in a northwesterly direction for the last twelve mile that carry -PRON- through the outskirt of the county seat 
markham on -PRON- ski could con a direct course to roscommon bisect the river at three point and finally climb the butte for a long glissade into the town 
that glissade right into the edge of the settlement measure ten mile of down grade 
the slope of bear butte be smooth and directly under -PRON- crest the descent be steep 
a mile of this and then the course fall away more gently 
markham if -PRON- make good time to the eastern base of bear butte would very likely reach that particular spot ahead of peter for -PRON- would have to travel only seven mile while peter be go sixteen 
where markham would lose would be in climb the butte and where -PRON- would make up -PRON- loss would be in the long glissade down the opposite side 
at the river edge peter screw the skate into -PRON- heel pull the strap tight and buckle -PRON- then put on -PRON- bearskin glove and strike out 
-PRON- be well away toward bluff before markham make -PRON- first crossing of the river near the ranch house 
the ice be in splendid condition 
a strong wind have sweep -PRON- clean of loose snow save here and there at the turn where drift have form 
then a slight thaw a few day before have be follow by a tightening of the cold and all rough spot have be smooth away 
markham whose steel runner be the very last word in allmetal skate excel as a figure skater 
-PRON- could cut all sort of graceful figure on the ice and with hesther morton would do a sort of waltz which the girl seem to consider rare sport 
peter on the other hand be not proficient at that sort of thing 
-PRON- prefer straight skate possibly because -PRON- realize that fancy caper be quite out of -PRON- line 
the steel wood and leather with which -PRON- be shod seem best adapt to straightaway work anyhow 
peter know every foot of the river between the ranch and roscommon 
-PRON- have cover that long stretch of ice several time while get -PRON- in trim for the skating race at lake 
there be white ice under the shelter of the bluff and the butte cause by a fall of snow while the first crystal be form 
this have be full of air bubble and have be treacherous up to the time the severe frost have follow the thaw 
after that the liquefy snow have congeal into a sound and superlative smoothness 
there be not a spot to be fear on the entire course 
with long steady swinging stroke peter sweep around the first turn and come south on the stretch which markham be to cross in order to thread a seam through bluff 
but although the moonlight be brilliant upon the sparkle snow crust -PRON- could see nothing of -PRON- rival 
-PRON- may be -PRON- reason that markham have already effect -PRON- second crossing of the river and be even then in the gash that cut through the bluff 
peter grind -PRON- tooth and with -PRON- runner ring musically pass like a gliding specter around the bluff base 
three mile farther and -PRON- may obtain a view of markham as -PRON- emerge from the shallow defile and push over the open level toward the butte 
-PRON- be have queer thought about markham 
why have the fellow protest against any attempt to reach roscommon and notify the sheriff 
then in the face of -PRON- protest why have -PRON- determine to pit -PRON- ski against peter accomplish the thing which -PRON- have aver could not be accomplish 
there be but one answer to this accord to peter conclusion 
markham could not bear to think that peter may succeed that -PRON- may win favorable notice from uncle sila and that -PRON- may gain some credit in the eye of hesther morton 
markham be not think of save the horse no -PRON- be impress with the idea of -PRON- own prestige and importance and -PRON- could not take a chance of lose out to a saphead 
that be all there be to -PRON- so peter believe 
a determination to win that race and save the steal stock grow strong and strong in peter breast 
here after the miserable failure at lake be a most unexpected opportunity to retrieve -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- business to make the most of -PRON- 
three straight mile lay ahead of -PRON- to the westward of the bluff 
come down the stretch like the wind -PRON- survey the shadowy opening of the swale in the hope of catch a glimpse of markham 
but the ski runner be not in sight 
in the distance the sparkle crest of bear butte could be vaguely determine yet between the bluff and the butte no dusky figure could be see toil on the ski 
-PRON- hasnot clear the bluff yet think peter exultantly lead -PRON- by ginger 
the river at the end of the threemile stretch describe a curve like a gigantic horseshoe 
in -PRON- first begin the stream have attempt to run west by south meet the rough country -PRON- course have be deflect toward the northwest then strike the widespreading base of bear butte -PRON- have follow northeast and east on -PRON- way around the huge uplift 
on clear the butte the puyallup strike off due northwest and so in a dozen mile come to roscommon 
peter although -PRON- have not time -PRON- know -PRON- have be make excellent speed 
-PRON- be seventeen mile from the ranch and come rapidly under the shadow of the butte 
markham could scarcely climb the massive rise and glissade into roscommon ahead of -PRON- 
so far as -PRON- have be able to discover markham be not yet anywhere near bear butte i say peter 
peter be amazed 
above -PRON- ringing steel a sharp cry echo in the frosty air 
-PRON- be voice and call -PRON- name 
peter dig into the ice with the heel of -PRON- runner and come to a quick halt 
that -PRON- porter -PRON- call 
yes nix in hard luck 
stop a minute will -PRON- 
the voice come from a shadowy overhang at the butte foot 
peter skate toward the black cavity and be meet by the dusky figure of markham limp out of the darkness and across the ice 
markham have -PRON- ski under -PRON- arm 
by george cry peter 
-PRON- get here in a hurry wrong fall from a sixfoot bank as i be cross the river and splinter one of -PRON- ski be the answer and i canot go on with the wood runner 
i reckon take -PRON- skate markham add coolly 
peter catch -PRON- breath reckon -PRON- wonot -PRON- return with spirit go on to roscommon start the sheriff and a posse for the dry wash and get a doctor for bailey 
what do -PRON- take -PRON- for a plain everyday saphead say markham 
down on the ice peter and off with those skate 
pronto be the word no time to lose 
markham have drop the ski and strip a glove from -PRON- right hand 
the bare hand be in the pocket of -PRON- leather coat 
suddenly as the two stand face each other the hand emerge from the pocket with a short uglylooking bulldog revolver 
markham level the weapon and the moonlight glint frostily on the barrel 
again peter catch -PRON- breath 
-PRON- be daze bewilder 
to be threaten in that manner by one whom -PRON- have believe to be a friendor if not a friend at least a fellow employee of uncle silas goddard with interest in a decided shock 
-PRON- crazy porter demand peter when -PRON- could find -PRON- tongue 
hardly be the reply with a husky illomene laugh -PRON- will be a long time before -PRON- reach roscommon -PRON- laddybuck 
take off those skate i tell -PRON- 
i mean business peter 
there be that in word and manner which leave no doubt of the fact that -PRON- mean business 
peter be wild with indignation and anger but -PRON- be also helpless 
reece bailey say to this when i tell -PRON- -PRON- ask drop to the ice and work at the skate strap cross that bridge when -PRON- get to -PRON- be the response 
throw the skate over here when -PRON- get -PRON- off 
-PRON- have to butt into this deal with the fool suggestion of get word to the sheriff now blame -PRON- take -PRON- medicine bind to win grunt peter if -PRON- have to do -PRON- with a gun 
-PRON- ainot square markham 
i may be a good deal of a saphead but i find when -PRON- be too late that one of -PRON- ski and one of -PRON- skate strap have be tamper with at lake 
-PRON- do that 
why didnot -PRON- tell hesther about -PRON- jeer markham or the judge of the contest -PRON- have nerve enough to put up a holler 
peter give the skate a shove across the ice 
ten foot away markham sit down to screw the skate to -PRON- heel and adjust the strap 
the revolver lie at -PRON- side and -PRON- watch peter sharply as -PRON- work 
peter a desperate purpose form in -PRON- mind be await the moment when -PRON- could spring to the attack 
-PRON- be not to be conquer in that way 
there be plenty of fight in -PRON- and markham would discover -PRON- to -PRON- cost 
markham work rapidly 
the skate be on and snugly buckle and -PRON- be just rise when peter go after -PRON- with a short run and a slide 
but if peter be quick markham be a shade quicker 
crack the revolver explode in the air and peter left arm seem suddenly to have be scorch with a hot iron 
the shock cause -PRON- to lose -PRON- footing and -PRON- fall in a sprawl on the slippery surface of the river 
-PRON- would have -PRON- shout markham fiercely something more for -PRON- to tell bailey 
the last word fade in mellow ring of slide steel 
peter sit up on the ice and clasp -PRON- numbed arm with -PRON- right hand watch markham slip from sight around the curve at the foot of bear butte 
peter be think less of the pain in -PRON- arm than -PRON- be of the rascally work of peter markham 
the fellow must be mad to make such an attack 
-PRON- have plan the whole thing of course and have arm -PRON- before leave reach the butte ahead of peter -PRON- have go into hiding against the moment peter should come skate down the river 
then by way of make -PRON- treachery more contemptible -PRON- have call to peter for help only to threaten -PRON- with a revolver and steal -PRON- skate 
-PRON- bet tell bailey mutter peter reckon thisll cook -PRON- goose with goddard even if -PRON- do get to roscommon in time to have the sheriff head off the bronk 
what can a fellow make of a man like -PRON- act thataway 
with difficulty peter remove -PRON- coat and shove up the shirt and sweater sleeve 
the wound be in the forearm and be bleed profusely 
with a bandanna handkerchief -PRON- bind up the injury tightly knot the handkerchief corner with -PRON- finger and -PRON- tooth then get into -PRON- coat again -PRON- begin consider -PRON- next move 
-PRON- be twelve mile by river to roscommon and eighteen mile back to the ranch 
even if -PRON- be now useless for -PRON- to get to the town in order to carry the news of the horse steal to the sheriff return to would have be a fierce pull on -PRON- strength and -PRON- dare not attempt -PRON- 
-PRON- would make -PRON- way to roscommon 
if -PRON- could reach the settlement before markham leave -PRON- -PRON- would lodge a complaint against the treacherous scoundrel and have -PRON- hold in the town jail 
peter be burn for revenge 
yes that be what -PRON- would do 
-PRON- get up feel a little dizzy and faint and start down the river 
-PRON- foot strike against ski and another idea come to -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- could tinker up the splintered ski and use the runner 
after the accident that have lose -PRON- the jump at lake peter have buy a little fine wire for the mending of -PRON- own broken runner 
that wire be still in -PRON- trouser pocket and -PRON- may be that -PRON- could use -PRON- in fix splintered ski 
pick up both runner and hold the damage one between -PRON- knee -PRON- strike a match and make a careful examination 
the stout ash have be crack under the bind mechanism 
a few wrap of fine wire may yet make the runner serve 
with -PRON- jackknife peter dig a shallow groove across the ski bottom and in this -PRON- imbed the half dozen coil of wire that -PRON- wove over and over and make fast on the upper surface 
for -PRON- -PRON- have never fancy that bilgeri bind 
although light and well make -PRON- be not nearly so strong or dependable as the lilienfield bind with which peter own ski be equip 
peter work have be do at a tremendous disadvantage 
-PRON- could work with one hand only and in lieu of -PRON- other hand -PRON- make shift to use -PRON- tooth 
the moon although brilliant leave much to be desire in the matter of light for such fine and exact labor and sense of touch have to help -PRON- where that of sight fail 
in the main however -PRON- do very well all thing consider and when -PRON- have secure -PRON- foot in the binding -PRON- arise on the ash runner with a feeling of exultation in -PRON- breast 
where be the stick 
-PRON- search for -PRON- carry -PRON- to the overhang and there -PRON- find not only the ski stick but two strip of gunny sack each heavily knot in the middle 
those strip of sack rather puzzle peter 
markham have bring -PRON- as an aid in get up the steep eastern slope of the butte 
but why have -PRON- prepare -PRON- with -PRON- if -PRON- object be to waylay peter and secure the skate 
markham always figure a matter out both way peter reflect 
-PRON- bring the gun to help corral the skate but if i happen to beat -PRON- to the butte then -PRON- would have to keep right on over the rise 
if -PRON- couldnot do one thing then -PRON- be ready to do the other more -PRON- splinter that ski apurpose and -PRON- didnot do -PRON- until -PRON- know i be behind -PRON- at the overhang 
-PRON- didnot want -PRON- to have a chance to use the ski that s all 
-PRON- never occur to -PRON- that have something along to use in patchin up the runner once anyhow that a saphead fool -PRON- 
peter shuffle -PRON- way to a point beyond the overhang then pause to tie the strip of cloth around the ski knot side down 
this maneuver would help to keep -PRON- from slide backward 
-PRON- flash an upward look at the difficult grade -PRON- be to negotiate 
if -PRON- heart fail -PRON- for a moment because of -PRON- useless arm and the shock -PRON- whole body have suffer because of the wound -PRON- only result in let -PRON- get a firm grip on -PRON- resolution and strength 
the wound be nothing serious be merely a clean gash through the fleshy part of the forearm 
-PRON- would not allow -PRON- to endanger the success of -PRON- night exploit 
markham must be make to suffer for -PRON- lawlessness and -PRON- be up to peter to see that -PRON- do not escape 
the first easy slope of the butte be take just as one may travel over level forward movement in long gliding step 
the ski be merely advanced never lift 
as the ascent stiffen peter turn out the end of the runner slightly in what be know as the half fishbone step 
there be a trick in this and peter have long since acquire -PRON- 
steep and steeper become the course as the snowy slope be climb and the full fishbone step be gradually bring into requisition 
for such a long ascent the work be extremely tiring and peter be force to do a number of serpentine tack back and forth and execute the difficult about face at each turn 
a good deal of time be require in make the climb but peter handicap of awkwardness have teach -PRON- how to be patient and doggedly resolute in carry out -PRON- aim 
-PRON- keep unflinchingly to -PRON- tiresome task and in due course be reward by find -PRON- on the flat crest of bear butte ready for the long glissade 
by this time -PRON- sport blood be arouse and -PRON- look forward with keen enjoyment to the breathlessly swift glide that lie ahead of -PRON- 
-PRON- rest a few moment tuck the hand of -PRON- injured arm into the front of -PRON- coat remove the knot strip from the runner take firm hold of the ski stick and then let -PRON- over the butte crest 
with ski so close together that -PRON- touch the point of one lead the other by a foot body not bent but incline forward peter be off down the steep slope like a bullet out of a gun 
-PRON- be at a disadvantage in not have both hand for use with the stick 
where -PRON- be necessary to brake and avoid a small crevasse or a bowlder peter do -PRON- entirely with the ski by execute the telemark swing 
-PRON- be not often that -PRON- be confront by such an emergency but -PRON- be proficient in that method of dodge possible disaster and unhesitatingly avail -PRON- of -PRON- 
at lightning speed -PRON- shoot down the butte the air hum in -PRON- ear and snowy particle sting -PRON- face 
-PRON- exhilaration mount high and high 
in -PRON- delight over the coasting -PRON- forget the steal horse the treachery of markham and the reprisal -PRON- be count upon when -PRON- should reach roscommon 
-PRON- every faculty be call into play and busy -PRON- with the fly ski to the exclusion of everything else 
the slope flatten and peter speed lessen perceptibly although -PRON- be still go at a rate comparable to that of a limited express train 
on and on mile after mile -PRON- sensation be that of one fall through space 
-PRON- scarcely realize that -PRON- have any connection whatever with the whiteclad earth beneath -PRON- 
at last in the distance -PRON- see a twinkling light and a confused blur of building 
roscommon 
the town jump toward -PRON- as though crazily bent on foul -PRON- course 
-PRON- give rather more attention to roscommon than to the slope ahead of -PRON- and suddenly -PRON- pitch into the air as the runner hit an obstacle 
-PRON- fall with the ski braid around -PRON- neck fall hard upon the clear track of the roscommon railroad yard and so suddenly that -PRON- have no time to realize -PRON- have go over the embankment at the side of the network of rail 
instinctively -PRON- try to lift -PRON- only to drop in an awkward huddle with a blaze of shoot star crisscross before -PRON- eye 
then the bright light fade and nixon peter quietly go to sleep 
when peter awake -PRON- find -PRON- on a bench in the railroad station 
a local train be expect and there have be man on the station platform when peter shoot over the railroad embankment and hit the track 
three or four of the man go forward to investigate the strange phenomenon and -PRON- be the one who have bring peter into the waiting room 
-PRON- have no more than lay -PRON- down and strip off -PRON- ski when -PRON- open -PRON- eye 
sheriff go to the dry wash yet -PRON- inquire faintly 
a man bent over -PRON- 
jordan the sheriff say -PRON- 
what dry wash do -PRON- mean 
why should i go there 
markham reach town go on peter see a thing of markham 
oh 
jordan exclaim know -PRON- now 
-PRON- be man peter from the morton ranch 
why be -PRON- slide into town at this time o night on a pair of ski 
thunder 
-PRON- be as much as -PRON- life be worth 
-PRON- gang of horse thief run off -PRON- fifty of -PRON- cut in peter wildly 
-PRON- happen early in the evening 
get a posse jordan and head off the gang at long knife dry wash 
when markham show up leave somebody in town to arrest -PRON- 
-PRON- shoot -PRON- in the arm 
and send a doctor to to look after bailey wound too 
then peter go to sleep again 
when -PRON- next come to -PRON- and pick up the chain of event -PRON- be in a bed in a room at the roscommon house 
broad day look in at the room window and peter could gaze dreamily out at roof cover with snow and sparkle under the sun ray as though cover with diamond 
hour have pass since -PRON- have have the brief awakening in the railroad station 
now -PRON- be in a comfortable bed -PRON- left arm neatly bandage and toynbee the proprietor of the hotel be sit beside -PRON- 
do -PRON- get markham toynbee ask peter 
the landlord be read a newspaper 
-PRON- jump in -PRON- chair as the unexpected word reach -PRON- from the bed 
oh -PRON- be back eh say -PRON- be a long time on the road although the doctor say -PRON- neednot to mind 
get markham 
well i guess 
and toynbee chuckle 
jordan get -PRON- and four other along with the steal horse 
-PRON- be push through the dry wash when the sheriff and -PRON- party arrive there 
-PRON- bet -PRON- get -PRON- peter and redhande at that 
big surprise to everybody 
why markham have put the whole thing up 
-PRON- be back of the entire scheme 
-PRON- have all come out 
markham wonot talk but the rest of the gang feel different 
across the line there be man wait to take the horse and rush -PRON- off where -PRON- would never be find 
say 
i guess -PRON- ought to have a medal for what -PRON- do last night 
how be -PRON- feel anyhow 
peter be stunned 
porter markham one of the horse thief 
could peter believe -PRON- ear 
markham have have a reason for drive the horse off -PRON- foot on the return from lake 
with all the other stock take from -PRON- have be plan to make the sleigh team useless so far as a drive of twenty mile to roscommon with news for the sheriff be concerned and markham have protest against peter plan of use skate in carry an alarm to roscommon but when the method have be put into effect in spite of -PRON- markham have take to the ski and have waylay peter at the eastern foot of bear butte 
in the light of recent event the motive for that attack could be see at an even more treacherous angle scheme be not to beat peter to roscommon with news for the sheriff but to keep all knowledge of the robbery from the authority until the steal horse have be deliver across the line 
instead of make for the town after secure peter skate markham have follow the river bend beyond the town to a point where -PRON- could join -PRON- rascally confederate with the horse herd 
how do -PRON- feel peter repeat toynbee after wait a long time for a reply 
mighty nigh locoed say peter 
no wonder 
say -PRON- hit the railroad iron with -PRON- head when -PRON- go over the embankment 
any other head but -PRON- would probably have be crack 
-PRON- canot crack a saphead comment peter but not in bitterness 
next day when peter be think of get out of -PRON- bed and help drive the horse back to the ranch no less a person than uncle silas goddard walk into -PRON- room 
uncle sila be an irongray man big and broad and with a regular heart under -PRON- rib 
-PRON- have receive a telegram sign reece bailey per morton and have come to north dakota by first train 
there be greeting not those of a pleased employer for a worthy employee but more in line with what one next of kin may say in circumstance altogether creditable 
bailey be come fine and would be on the job again in two or three week and peter the doctor say would be fit as a fiddle in seven day at the outside 
the horse be on the way back to what about markham query peter 
uncle silas cheery face grow troubled 
well markham be only a boy and a very foolish one 
-PRON- have have a hard lesson 
no stock have be lose and uncle sila feel that -PRON- ought not to be too hard on markham 
-PRON- be go to let markham go on a promise to leave the country and make something of -PRON- in other part 
any one at all acquaint with uncle sila may have know -PRON- would do that very thing 
as for -PRON- nixon the big ranchowner go on a job wait in montana for a chap of -PRON- heft and disposition 
but do -PRON- want to return to the home ranch -PRON- ask quizzically 
miss hesth morton send a very kindly message to -PRON- by -PRON- 
-PRON- be sorry for a lot of thing -PRON- say and hope to see -PRON- right soon 
but nixon peter have see another light 
-PRON- recall -PRON- saphead dream of rescue hesther from a burn house and the shame red stain -PRON- cheek to the towcolored hair 
miss morton all at once be waste -PRON- consideration on the wrong party 
uncle sila say peter for montana as soon as -PRON- want -PRON- there 
good exclaimed uncle sila and clasped peter hand with a fervor that suggest not only good will but hearty congratulation
