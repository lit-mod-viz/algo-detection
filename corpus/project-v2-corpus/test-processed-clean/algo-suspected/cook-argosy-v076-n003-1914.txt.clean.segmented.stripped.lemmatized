cook be there anything crooked about the way get hold of that property sila inquire bremerton quietly 
not on -PRON- life and expression become exceedingly virtuous 
i get the property at a bargain of course intend to turn -PRON- over to a syndicate make handsomely if i can let go for half a million but in order to do that the bullion have get to come as -PRON- do a year ago when i take over the proposition 
-PRON- go down there lee and straighten thing out 
i wonot stand for anything offcolor deane 
confound -PRON- that s why i want -PRON- 
-PRON- can forget more in a minute about mining and milling than any expert know in a year make -PRON- worth -PRON- while old man 
-PRON- ought to get thing come -PRON- way inside of a month 
after that keep up the good showing for six month and unload 
what be i to get out of itexcept a chance to go to the hospital if lucky oh bosh 
when -PRON- grab hold the gang will have the first real man to deal with that send down there hunt -PRON- hole and -PRON- wonot have a mite of trouble 
i know -PRON- or i wouldnot give -PRON- this chance 
of course bremerton -PRON- ainot so darn old but i guess -PRON- sabe -PRON- get pretty near time -PRON- take a start 
eh 
sure 
now look here go to give -PRON- five hundred dollar a mdnth and allow -PRON- six month to make that -PRON- a winner 
how do that hit -PRON- that will amount to three thousand dollar observe bremerton provide i last for six month last all right 
thunder 
if -PRON- have get any white feather conceal on -PRON- person then -PRON- all happen in the last five year 
time be when -PRON- call -PRON- lee reckless and neither hell nor highwater throw a crimp into -PRON- 
bremerton stir uneasily 
reckless -PRON- have be call but not justly 
occasionally -PRON- have make the most of a desperate situation but not without carenever recklessly 
if -PRON- want a reckless man deane -PRON- say -PRON- donot want -PRON- 
come now insist the other i guess i know who i want 
this be a man job and -PRON- be the man for -PRON- never far wide of -PRON- trail when i size up a bunch of circumstance and pick a chap to handle -PRON- 
but if -PRON- donot want this chanceif -PRON- be not in need of money -PRON- know in need of money be the sharp response and -PRON- know only wait to grab at something in the way of a chance 
and that bremerton add a trifle grimly be why afraid of i hope for old friendship sake -PRON- be not try to take advantage of -PRON- necessity 
when -PRON- twang the sentimental string old partner -PRON- sure get -PRON- go crowd a stranger to the -PRON- lookout whether or not -PRON- eyeteeth be cutbut the need of an old friend will always hit -PRON- close to the heart 
lee wonot -PRON- see canot -PRON- see that try to do something for -PRON- why -PRON- and -PRON- drink out of the same coffeecan year ago and once when i be nigh petere in the desert -PRON- wring the last drop from the canteen and give -PRON- to -PRON- 
say do -PRON- imagine that all the money in the world could make -PRON- forget a few of those thing 
dash -PRON- not so walled in with dollar that i canot break through to help a chap i think more of than i would of a bloodbrother 
bremerton listen thoughtfully 
by turn a lose proposition into a winner -PRON- would help deane to half a million 
balance against that be the three thousand dollar -PRON- be to receive for the risk and the trouble 
as though -PRON- have read -PRON- old friend thought deane lean forward and drop a confiding hand on -PRON- knee 
but five hundred a month -PRON- go on isnot all willing to do for -PRON- a bonus in the work 
make a show help -PRON- to unload and there s a stake for -PRON- to tuck away in -PRON- jean 
maybe that wouldnot be a boost eh 
bremerton -PRON- would start -PRON- on the way to easy street 
tell -PRON- more about the mine deane 
hang if i do down there and -PRON- can see -PRON- for -PRON- 
make a personal acquaintance with -PRON- give -PRON- a letter and a power of attorney -PRON- can handle the proposition just as though -PRON- own -PRON- 
what be the name of the man who be now in the hospital laceygordon lacey 
i donot want to butt in and take -PRON- job away from -PRON- 
deane fall back in -PRON- chair with a choppy laugh 
from under a paperweight on -PRON- desk -PRON- take a yellow slip 
read that say -PRON- a telegram i get from lacey the same day i wire -PRON- 
oh i guess -PRON- be not take anybodys job away from -PRON- 
the telegram be brief and to the point accept resignation 
i be do and probably do for 
gordon lacey advance -PRON- first month pay bremerton say deane as the telegram be quietly return to -PRON- 
all right return bremerton take the job 
hooray 
when will -PRON- start morning 
now then tell -PRON- the name of the mine just where find -PRON- and give -PRON- any other particular that will help -PRON- 
for fifteen minute the two be in close and earnest conversation but in the talk deane be strangely reticent about some thing and full of detail regard other 
when bremerton leave the office -PRON- have a check for five hundred dollar the confident good wish of deane and a vague idea that -PRON- be take rather a desperate leap in the dark 
after all -PRON- be that tenthousanddollar stake that settle the question so far as lee bremerton be concern 
on -PRON- foot and in health gordon lacey must have be a fine figure of a man 
with an eye keen for the architecture of bone and sinew frame that mystery of the spirit which make a human being worth while bremerton read the late superintendent of the mariquita mine for what -PRON- be 
day in hospital with strength ebb and flow about the misty borderland have pinch and whiten the face of the sick man 
yet close though -PRON- be to physical wreck lacey be superb 
-PRON- be nine in the evening when bremerton come to -PRON- 
the young interne at the office desk be doubtful whether the patient could be see 
with lacey the dangerpoint be past and -PRON- be mend but up to that hour -PRON- have be deny to visitor 
besides -PRON- be too late for visitor anyway 
five minute be all i ask with -PRON- plead bremerton 
a nurse be call and send to the ward 
-PRON- return with the announcement that lacey insist on a brief interview with the man who be step into -PRON- shoe at the mariquita 
so bremerton go up and the man in the white bed and -PRON- visitor exchange look and be straightway on friendly footing 
-PRON- may have just five minute mr lacey say the nurse glance at the openface watch on -PRON- breast 
five minute will do and the patient peer at bremerton with a haggard smile 
what can -PRON- tell -PRON- that will be of help lacey 
bremerton ask 
i donot want to tax -PRON- strength and i should not have come at this hour if another would have serve 
-PRON- be after seven when i reach phoenix and by sunrise tomorrow i shall be on -PRON- way into the hill 
in a few word give -PRON- the gist of the situation 
what do deane tell -PRON- 
a good deal but nothing bear on the real trouble 
with two superintendent deal with as -PRON- and the other have be in a mining district suppose to be peaceable and lawabide there s a deep grievance somewhere 
what be -PRON- deane leave unsaid -PRON- be all a mystery to -PRON- bremerton 
lacey pick thoughtfully at the bedclothe with -PRON- gaunt trembling finger 
-PRON- take the job on plain sayso that everything be square yes 
so do i have have hard place before and get the whiphand of -PRON- but this work at the mariquita come near be -PRON- finish 
when i first come i try to fill out the gap deaneleft in -PRON- story 
-PRON- secure the mine from carruther who at one time live here 
i try to locate carruther but -PRON- have decamp rather suddenly and no one know where -PRON- could be find 
after i have be on the job a few day mallory come and tell -PRON- -PRON- side and use threat 
i always look with suspicion upon a cause that be bolster up with threat 
i be short enough with mallory and then i be down with a cowardly shoot from the brush 
who be mallory deane do not mention -PRON- 
mallory bond the mine from carruther and fail to come across with the cash when the time limit expire 
ah murmur bremerton 
and what do mallory tell -PRON- lacey no use go into that 
the old scoundrel will see -PRON- soon and tell -PRON- the same thing 
what i want -PRON- to know what i want -PRON- to understand be this if ever -PRON- look on the bright face of danger and feel the ground opening beneath -PRON- and -PRON- foot slip toward bottomless deep remember -PRON- peril when girl confront -PRON- as -PRON- surely will 
a woman a faint smile cross the strong sunbrowne face of bremerton 
how be girl mix up in this sometimes i have think -PRON- be the very soul of all the plot and counterplot which bring poor old griggsby to -PRON- end and come so near get -PRON- 
bewilder line pucker around the sink gleam eye 
but i donot know i donot know 
angel or shedemon i do not last long enough at the mariquita to discover 
when -PRON- sfhile i find -PRON- danger great 
-PRON- send for -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- want to give -PRON- information of value and in ride to meet -PRON- i be snare like a helpless rabbit voice quiver with earnestness as -PRON- add as -PRON- value -PRON- life bremerton beware of mariquita mallory 
bremerton would have laugh but out of respect for this strong spirit that have try and fail -PRON- keep the laugh in -PRON- throat 
a few woman -PRON- have know and all of the good and -PRON- have yet to find one who could make a fool of -PRON- 
-PRON- one love be the silent great outdoors where mountain and plain be rib with gold -PRON- for the finding 
a woman could have no part in that 
i can see -PRON- think i be babble like an idiot go on lacey still gravely and earnestly but if i could tell -PRON- nothing else that one thing i want -PRON- to know beware of mariquita mallory 
mallory -PRON- -PRON- can take in -PRON- two hand and deal with -PRON- as an honest man deal with a scoundrel but a woman a beautiful that be different 
the nurse come toward the bed -PRON- eye on the watch 
i be afraid -PRON- must stop now say -PRON- 
only five minute dr preston say mr lacey 
just one thing more bremerton the sick man continue 
i have to leave king the cyanid expert in charge 
-PRON- be a capital cyanid expert but a poor hand with man 
the quicker -PRON- reach the mine the well 
-PRON- lift and hold out -PRON- hand 
remember what i have tell -PRON- about mariquita mallory and good luck 
bremerton clasp the hand cordially and gratefully and leave the ward 
once clear of the hospital building -PRON- look up at the round moon in the blue velvet sky hesitate a second then lay a course that carry -PRON- directly away from the hotel 
-PRON- be not a stranger in that town 
two year before -PRON- have outfit there for a prospecting trip into the harqua hala 
now -PRON- want to get away by -PRON- and think 
-PRON- word have be give to deane and -PRON- have take money 
for well or for bad -PRON- have plunge into this undertaking at the mariquita mine 
the keynote of -PRON- character be loyalty and nothing could shake -PRON- determination to give to interest the good that be in -PRON- word however have plunge -PRON- into a train of reflection none too pleasant 
-PRON- aimless foot bring -PRON- presently to the town ditch where the water ripple musically and the moonlight silver the cottonwood and where from the soft recess of the night come the note of a whippoorwill 
out of the dim past -PRON- memory construct a similar scene 
-PRON- have go into camp ata waterhole there be cottonwood like those whose white trunk now rise around -PRON- and then as now a whippoorwill sing in the distance 
but on that night as -PRON- recall -PRON- jhad be awaken by the cracking of a twig and have fight in the moonlight with a roving mexican who have try to steal -PRON- burro and -PRON- grubpack 
suddenly -PRON- pause straighten erect and listen 
as by the waterhole so long ago here by the phoenix town ditch -PRON- hear a stealthy footfall behind -PRON- 
instinctively -PRON- hand clench and -PRON- brace -PRON- for an encounter 
another moment and the mood pass 
with a low laugh -PRON- lean against the trunk of a tree 
well friend -PRON- call be -PRON- follow -PRON- or do -PRON- just happen that -PRON- be on -PRON- trail 
the dark figure which -PRON- eye have glimpse come out of the shadow and into a splotch of moonlight 
a large man in a broadbrimmed hat stand out against the dusky background clear as a silver print 
the head be shaggy with hair and beard and in the dark of the hatbrim two eye glow like point of flame 
-PRON- name mallory say a husky voice and be follow -PRON- ever since -PRON- strike town 
mr bremerton ainot -PRON- so this be mallory appear as lacey have foretell only somewhat before the time bremerton have expect -PRON- 
yes this be bremerton like to inquire mallory why -PRON- have favor -PRON- with -PRON- attention get to that be the answer as the speaker draw closer just be to the hospital 
pick out a comfortable place there against the time -PRON- be ready for -PRON- do griggsby pick out a place if -PRON- do what good do -PRON- do -PRON- 
-PRON- never live to get to the hospital do -PRON- i donot know about griggsby and i donot know who put lacey where -PRON- be 
all i do know be that deane will never get any good out of the mariquita mine and those who try to help -PRON- will never get no good out of -PRON- either 
deane be a cutthroat a pirate a blackhearte swine who -PRON- be talk of a friend of mine mallory bremerton interrupt sharply 
friend a husky jeering laugh come with the word 
a fine riend of -PRON- when -PRON- send -PRON- into such a trap as that at the mariquita wonderin why so interested in -PRON- movement bremerton 
i get a reason no sooner sign on with deane than i know of -PRON- 
a telegram from denver be relay to -PRON- in the hill 
i come to town and have be waitin for -PRON- 
since -PRON- get here i have trail around after -PRON- look for a chance to give -PRON- a bit of advice 
just out of kindness of heart that s all 
recall remark about mallory bremerton observe in a tone of chill finality when i want -PRON- advice mallory ask for -PRON- 
no -PRON- wonot the other return drop into the little pit deane have dig for -PRON- and -PRON- donot even sabe that -PRON- s ntuy malo 
i allow -PRON- think the villain in these here tragedy at the mariquita but -PRON- be wrong 
mallory step still close 
-PRON- put out a hand as though to lay -PRON- on arm but bremerton step back 
now that mallory be within arm reach of -PRON- bremerton could see that -PRON- beard and hair be iron gray and that -PRON- face be oldold in way of the world perhaps as well as in year 
-PRON- act as if i be a rattler go on mallory and soundin a warning before i strike 
man -PRON- be way wide of -PRON- trail 
the warning give -PRON- be for -PRON- own good 
there be other who will strike if -PRON- do not listen young lee bremerton 
five hundred dollar a month for six month and ten thousand as a bonus if -PRON- make goodwhat be -PRON- 
just a bait to lure -PRON- into the same fate that overtake griggsbyl leave the mariquita mine alone 
-PRON- can make nothing of -PRON- and in the end -PRON- will wring -PRON- dry and toss -PRON- bone on the scrapheap 
clear out order bremerton have none of the threat -PRON- call advice and warning 
the old man draw a deep sigh and without a word turn away 
-PRON- pass like a specter through the pool of moonlight and melt into the shadow beyond 
scarcely have -PRON- vanish when footfall reach ear 
swift and catlike -PRON- come from either side and from behind 
bremerton be a man who always stand -PRON- ground 
-PRON- square -PRON- now to meet what be to come 
vague shadowy shape be close in glide toward -PRON- swiftly from three different direction 
if that be there be no challenge no parley 
out from among the whitetrunke cottonwood hurry fantom shape and in grim silence fall upon bremerton 
one moment -PRON- see -PRON- come and the next moment -PRON- be among -PRON- and fighting 
-PRON- have only -PRON- bare hand 
-PRON- assailant be arm with club and one of -PRON- have a quirt for -PRON- thong fall stingingly over face and throat 
the hot blood leap in the prospector vein 
these coward four or five or half a dozen of -PRON- be upon -PRON- in a crowd with -PRON- whip and -PRON- bludgeon 
-PRON- be like a pack of wolf 
outrage every principle of fair play -PRON- would smother -PRON- under a weight of number and give -PRON- no chance for -PRON- 
circumstance like these be more than enough to arouse all the savage resentment rn nature 
in a flash -PRON- become the lee reckless of those old day with cornered wildcata cave man with -PRON- back to the walla fury with all the seethe elemental passion uppermost 
-PRON- foe be many and -PRON- must take -PRON- one by one 
while -PRON- charge a single vague shape -PRON- be force to run a gantlet of blow that stagger and daze -PRON- 
yet one man crumple under the weight of -PRON- fist and as the ruffian groan and pitch forward the prospector whirl and charge again 
foot crunch and slip in the gravelly soil sharp labored breathing rent the air in staccatolike note and over all rise the sodden thump of the club 
again and again the prospector wrench -PRON- clear of the press 
perhaps not one blow in half a dozen reach -PRON- for the gloom and the excitement send many of -PRON- wild but the bludgeon that find -PRON- mark have a cruelly crush strength behind -PRON- 
while -PRON- drive before -PRON- another of -PRON- foe the rest hang upon -PRON- back and belabor -PRON- viciously 
nothing keep -PRON- from -PRON- quarry 
at the edge of the town canal the retreat enemy be force to make a stand 
bremerton glimpse the man swarthy scowl face in the moonlight 
the fellow have raise a club for a tell blow 
before the club could fall bremerton grasp -PRON- and wrench -PRON- away 
almost simultaneously -PRON- hard fist dart at the shadowy face and the man go over the brink of the canal and into the water with a splash 
bremerton whirl smash right and leave with the club 
another man be strike and beat to -PRON- knee 
the prospector trample -PRON- roughly to get at -PRON- companion 
a stick aim at head glance and strike -PRON- right arm 
the arm fall limp and useless as though a bone have be snap 
a sicken pain convulse the prospector whole body but -PRON- rally magnificently 
-PRON- have lose -PRON- weapon and fqr offense and defense -PRON- have now only -PRON- left hand 
slowly -PRON- physical power be fail but -PRON- resolution grow as -PRON- strength diminish 
-PRON- spring at another of -PRON- assailant and just at the moment a pair of arm encircle -PRON- knee and -PRON- be throw from -PRON- foot 
then the pack close in 
on -PRON- head -PRON- shoulder -PRON- back rain the blow 
-PRON- left arm protect -PRON- face but finally that arm too drop away 
with a choking gasp -PRON- measure -PRON- length on the ground lie there helplessly while -PRON- fight to hold -PRON- fading sense 
the attack cease 
some one knelt beside -PRON- and whisper hoarsely in -PRON- ear this be all for now but go out to the mariquita mine and bad will follow 
remember what the voice die out in ear 
a pall suddenly encompass -PRON- faculty and -PRON- neither hear nor realize anything more 
-PRON- drift back to reason presently and find -PRON- alone 
-PRON- head throb and -PRON- whole body rebel when -PRON- attempt to move 
-PRON- grind -PRON- tooth to stifle a groan 
by degree -PRON- brain clear 
mallory have threaten and man have be handily by to make clear to -PRON- that the threat be to be take seriously have -PRON- chance at -PRON- muttered bremerton hoarsely and some day get -PRON- chance at -PRON- 
-PRON- try to lift -PRON- to -PRON- knee but the white stem of the cottonwood dance mistily around -PRON- and again -PRON- flatten out on the earth 
water would revive -PRON- 
if -PRON- could get to the crawl in the direction of the ditch dig into the ground with -PRON- finger and pull and push -PRON- on 
pain like dagger stab -PRON- in a dozen place 
for all that -PRON- find -PRON- could use -PRON- arm and leg so -PRON- could not be that any bone be break 
-PRON- be come out of that oneside battle much better than -PRON- have any reason to hope 
although bruised and sore -PRON- be not seriously injure 
for several minute -PRON- lie at the edge of the canal scoop up the water and splash -PRON- over -PRON- face 
little by little -PRON- strength return 
the night wind whisper soothingly among the cottonwood leave and the song of the whippoorwill echo from the peaceful shadow 
but what be this 
the bird out yonderwhat be -PRON- singe 
with a painful effort -PRON- lift -PRON- bruised and batter body on one elbow and stare in the direction of the misty alfalfafield trickle from a fleshwound on -PRON- forehead overflow and blind -PRON- eye 
remove a handkerchief from -PRON- pocket -PRON- hold -PRON- in the water and then pass -PRON- over -PRON- feverish face a crazy fool -PRON- mumble 
what the whippoorwill say to the star have long ago be establish 
only -PRON- disordered fancy could make anything else out of -PRON- 
-PRON- wit surely have go far afield to imagine the burden of those flutelike note 
what under heaven have possess -PRON- sick and suffer as -PRON- be to think of mariquita in connection with that scrap of melody 
mariquita 
angel or do not know which 
why in that hour be -PRON- in -PRON- thought 
lacey have be ride to meet the girl when -PRON- be shoot from the brush 
very possibly there by the town canal -PRON- have inspire that club of the man who be to take place 
bremerton sop the blood from -PRON- face with the wet handkerchief curse the name and -PRON- who bear -PRON- 
at last -PRON- arise to a sit posture wring the linen dry and bind up -PRON- temple with -PRON- 
-PRON- be a rifleshot from the main street of the town and -PRON- must get back to -PRON- hotel 
a glow of electric light hang in the sky well beyond the shadow of the cottonwood 
-PRON- eye measure the distance between the canal and the farflung maze of the arc and the incandescent 
for a man with two good leg under -PRON- the way be not far but for bremerton in -PRON- present condition -PRON- be very far indeed and perhaps impossible 
-PRON- try to lift -PRON- erect but only half succeed when -PRON- sink to the earth again 
as yet -PRON- have not master -PRON- ache nerve and muscle 
-PRON- could crawl at least if -PRON- could not walk 
on hand and knee sway uncertainly as -PRON- go -PRON- make -PRON- slow passage toward the edge of the cottonwood 
on the scene of -PRON- struggle with bravos -PRON- grope finger encounter something which puzzle -PRON- 
the object be round about the size of -PRON- fist and tie up in a cloth 
at first -PRON- think -PRON- a slungshot drop by one of the miscreant who have work -PRON- will with -PRON- 
-PRON- be curious enough however to grope in -PRON- pocket for a match and then by -PRON- light to make a more thorough examination 
yes at a time when another would have think only of -PRON- physical torment bremerton could give time and strength to trifle 
in prospect for gold a thousand trifle carefully weigh may lead to a strike 
year of prospect have teach -PRON- the value of the little thing and -PRON- do not neglect -PRON- 
the cloth enclose the round object prove to be a red cotton handkerchief carefully tie 
-PRON- remove the cord the fold of the handkerchief fall away and a small globe of frost silver lie reveal 
an exclamation of wonder escape lip 
the silver ball be a sphere of amalgamgold coat with quicksilver just as take from the plate of a mill and squeeze in a chamois skin 
the squeezing have drive off some of the quick and give the mass -PRON- spherical form 
of course the ball have be drop by one of assailant 
-PRON- prove that at least one of the rascal be a mill man or indirectly have something to do with a stampmill 
this in -PRON- be no identification as there be hundred of such man in that part of the country 
with the aid of another match bremerton examine the ball more closely 
-PRON- upper surface be a curious formation of small ridge where the fold of the chamois have be gather together and strong pressure apply with the hand 
the low half of the sphere be smooth save for an indentation that resemble the letter or be -PRON- an bremerton scowl 
by some chance the mallory father and daughter be so vividly in -PRON- mind that -PRON- instinctively look for -PRON- everywhere 
-PRON- growl over -PRON- folly replace the ball in the handkerchief and stow -PRON- away in a coat pocket 
then -PRON- would have crawl on again have a sound not reach -PRON- ear and suggest caution 
-PRON- be a sound of horse hoof approach slowly from the direction of the road 
-PRON- could see the rider indistinctly come through the heavy shadow cast by the tree 
the horse move to right and leave in a zigzag course as though -PRON- rider be seek something 
bremerton wonder grimly whether -PRON- or the ball of amalgam be the object of the stranger quest 
suddenly while -PRON- kneel there watch and wait the approach rider pass a spot upon which the moonbeam have full play 
a gasp of amazement come from bremerton 
the silvery light touch as with a caress the bare head of a woman 
the hair shine and luxuriant be brush smoothly back from the temple 
in -PRON- strand the stem of a fullblown rose be entangle 
the woman face be dim yet bremerton could see enough of -PRON- to know that -PRON- must have be wondrously fair 
-PRON- form be erect and graceful and -PRON- be mount in a man saddle and ride as a man would ride 
if -PRON- happen to be look for -PRON- call bremerton grimly this way 
the girl start peer in the direction from which the voice have come and quicken the pace of -PRON- horse 
if -PRON- happen to be lee bremerton say -PRON- in a voice at once soft and musical then i be look for -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh huskily and jeeringly be very much alive -PRON- return which be probably a great disappointment to mariquita mallory 
the illnature remark seem to make no impression upon -PRON- 
draw -PRON- horse to a stop -PRON- dismount calmly and step in front of bremerton 
bremerton know this girl be mariquita mallory 
in -PRON- mind that conviction be as fix as fate 
first have come -PRON- father then -PRON- father man and now why not the girl -PRON- 
-PRON- seem peculiarly fitting 
not too close -PRON- order sharply 
about where -PRON- arewill be near enough 
fear be a mental poison which -PRON- strong soul have never know 
some day when -PRON- brain be sick and -PRON- be physically break -PRON- may know -PRON- but -PRON- would not be a woman who cause -PRON- heart to fail and -PRON- courage to wane 
-PRON- command the girl to keep -PRON- distance because -PRON- whole nature be in hot revolt against -PRON- and -PRON- father and -PRON- scheme of violence 
-PRON- give -PRON- word no attention 
serenely -PRON- glide to a spot from which -PRON- could have reach forth and touch -PRON- have -PRON- wish to do so 
be -PRON- badly hurt mr bremerton -PRON- ask softly 
no -PRON- answer shortly 
-PRON- be cowardly to set a pack of hoodlum upon an unarmed man like that 
i agree with -PRON- and as soon as i hear of -PRON- i come here 
i want to help -PRON- to be -PRON- friend 
may i have the chance 
there be a wistfulness in -PRON- voice which do not escape -PRON- warn still rang in -PRON- ear however and -PRON- think -PRON- be play a part for purpose of -PRON- own 
clear out -PRON- call roughly and leave -PRON- to -PRON- all i ask of -PRON- 
be -PRON- able to get back to -PRON- hotel -PRON- persist 
yes 
-PRON- stagger to -PRON- foot 
sway drunkenly -PRON- be compel to lay hold of a tree and support -PRON- 
madre mia the girl breathe how -PRON- must have be beat 
oh the fiend the coward 
-PRON- clasp -PRON- hand convulsively 
and -PRON- thinkyou think that i have a hand in this contemptible night work 
-PRON- could not see -PRON- face there in the shadow but -PRON- voice go through the phase of sympathy and indignation and reproach 
-PRON- acting be superb no guesswork say -PRON- sternly all a matter of fact a woman and i donot want to forget that in -PRON- talking with -PRON- 
will -PRON- go 
in a little while 
i canot leave -PRON- like this 
be -PRON- still intend to go out to the mariquita mine mr bremerton if -PRON- and -PRON- father have any idea -PRON- can scare -PRON- -PRON- will have to guess again go to the mine and get the good on those who settle for griggsby and send lacey to the hospital 
tell -PRON- father that 
i suppose i have any more sand than griggsby or lacey but tough and go to last long enough to do the work that bring -PRON- here 
a breath like a sigh come from the dark slender figure confront bremerton 
if -PRON- be not suffer say the girl if i do not know -PRON- be in physical pain i could tell -PRON- thing which would make a change in -PRON- plan 
i think -PRON- be a man of courage and the brave be usually just 
i can imagine that what -PRON- have hear about -PRON- father and -PRON- have not cause -PRON- to feel very friendly toward -PRON- but donot be hasty 
reserve judgment mr bremerton 
a man who will trap another with a crowd of hoodlum as -PRON- father trap -PRON- want anything but justice 
if -PRON- have -PRON- desert -PRON- would probably be in the phoenix jail this minute and for all i know -PRON- would be there with -PRON- 
-PRON- canot handle -PRON- as -PRON- do lacey or stop 
the word flash at -PRON- daggerlike 
a temper the girl have carefully conceal up to that moment dart keen and sharp to the surface of -PRON- nature 
for an instant bremerton be surprised and then -PRON- reflect that -PRON- rough speaking have tear away the mask and give -PRON- a glimpse of the real mariquita mallory 
there be a throb of sorrow and undernote of grief shudder through that blaze of anger but -PRON- pass -PRON- say something the girl go on in a stifle voice that -PRON- may one day be sorry for 
i be here to help youlet -PRON- repeat that again 
and let -PRON- repeat that i want none of -PRON- help 
while i be at the mariquita the less i see of -PRON- father and -PRON- the well 
after a brief space mariquita step to -PRON- horse and lay a hand on the bit 
then -PRON- lead the animal close to bremerton 
get into the saddle -PRON- say crisply and ride to -PRON- hotel 
leave the horse at the post in front and i will either come after -PRON- -PRON- or send for -PRON- 
-PRON- persistence irritated bremerton 
-PRON- and -PRON- father be enemy of and so of mine -PRON- answer 
i donot intend to begin -PRON- work by place -PRON- under even a slight obligation to -PRON- 
take -PRON- horse and go away 
i can shift for -PRON- 
-PRON- step back into the moonlight 
-PRON- right hand lift to the level of -PRON- eye and a small revolver glimmer in -PRON- finger 
mount -PRON- order 
this will settle the obligation business 
if necessary i can force -PRON- to be sensible 
mount and ride to -PRON- hotel and leave the horse as i tell -PRON- 
the gleam in -PRON- eye match the silvery sheen of the level weapon 
-PRON- erect graceful figure the moonbeam shimmer on -PRON- hair and on the rose in -PRON- thick coil the beautiful face frame strongly in light and shadow and over all -PRON- dominant and resolute bearing conspire to form a picture that stir bremerton strangely 
what a woman 
one moment soft and gentle and pleading and the next moment fiery with determination and enforce -PRON- command at the muzzle of a revolver 
the novelty the inconsistency of -PRON- all break over -PRON- presently and -PRON- laugh 
nevertheless -PRON- lift a foot to the stirrup and climb weakly into the saddle 
-PRON- ride away leave mariquita there in the moonlight 
the last -PRON- see of -PRON- the revolver and the hand that hold -PRON- swing at -PRON- side and -PRON- fancy a smile wreathe -PRON- shadowy lip 
-PRON- be midnight when bremerton dismount in front of -PRON- hotel and walk unsteadily into the office 
the night clerk gasp and stare at -PRON- wonderingly 
-PRON- clothing be tear and earthstaine and in disorder and -PRON- face be puff and bruise and a redden bandage be swathe about -PRON- forehead 
the key to seventeen say bremerton brace -PRON- at the counter 
great gun murmur the clerk 
what have happen to -PRON- -PRON- have not be on duty when bremerton arrive and -PRON- hastily run -PRON- eye down the page of the open register 
i should think mr bremerton that -PRON- need a doctor 
let -PRON- help -PRON- upstairs and then i will call a i can get upstairs alone cut in bremerton and donot bother about a doctor not in such bad shape as -PRON- seem to think 
-PRON- take -PRON- key and start for the stair 
in about five minute -PRON- add halt a moment send up a boy with a pitcher of icewater and some telegraphblank 
if -PRON- have be beat up and rob by thug -PRON- ought to get the police busy 
i havenot be rob 
just have a little hard luck that s all and i donot want the matter to go any further a case of least say soon mend 
understand certainly mr bremerton but bremerton wait for no more but slowly ascend the stair to -PRON- room 
-PRON- be weak and dizzy and after -PRON- have snap on the electric light -PRON- fall sprawl on the bed 
-PRON- ache and pain seem to have be lose in a paralyzing nausea that fill -PRON- body 
have -PRON- not be in the pink of physical condition hardy and robust from year of wander through the untracked wilderness that beating must surely have be the death of -PRON- 
breathe hard and with every muscle relax -PRON- lie on -PRON- back starirtg up at the ceiling 
the mallory have take this method to frighten -PRON- away from the mariquita mine 
-PRON- little know the temper of the man -PRON- be deal with 
so far from intimidate -PRON- -PRON- resolution to help deane be merely strengthen 
for year -PRON- have breast the blow of circumstance 
the more difficulty -PRON- encounter and conquer the great -PRON- pride in any success -PRON- may achieve 
fear and discouragement be for weakling 
and lee bremerton have never be a weakling 
strangely enough the event of the night bring -PRON- a certain measure of relief and satisfaction 
-PRON- have vaguely imagine from reticence in certain matter that some sharp practise lie back of the murderous enmity for man at the mine 
that deane be none too scrupulous in forward -PRON- owh interest bremerton understand thoroughly 
those who resort to cudgel and a night attack be never the one with a just cause behind -PRON- 
so by implication right to the mariquita property have be prove 
this be what afford the prospector -PRON- relief and satisfaction daughter be a good deal of a puzzle 
certainly -PRON- be a splendid actress 
at first -PRON- have assume a friendly attitude hope no doubt to deceive -PRON- to win -PRON- confidence and then to work upon -PRON- sympathy 
but -PRON- have anger -PRON- by a few word that emphasize -PRON- knowledge of -PRON- true character arid -PRON- have burst into sudden flame like a powder magazine touch by a light match 
sick as -PRON- be -PRON- rather pride -PRON- on have force aside the mask for a glimpse of the real mariquita mallory 
yet in spite of -PRON- positive conviction there be something about the girl that defy a complete understanding of -PRON- 
when i get over the effect of this club -PRON- assure -PRON- be able to think to well purpose 
lacey be undecided in -PRON- estimate of the girl but tell -PRON- to beware of -PRON- 
-PRON- appear to be a clearheaded sort of fellow and i canot see why -PRON- be undecided 
-PRON- little experience with mariquita mallory have leave -PRON- with no doubt at all 
still if i know more a sensation hard to define overshadow -PRON- conclusion 
-PRON- be a sensation that baffle analysis 
the mine be call the mariquita 
the name could scarcely be a coincidence 
of course the girl have inspire -PRON- 
yet how and why if this person carruther have originally locate the property have carruther know mariquita mallory 
have -PRON- be so greatly impressed with -PRON- that -PRON- have give -PRON- name to -PRON- mine 
these be trifle thought 
as question -PRON- merely harass a mind which be unequal to any sort of struggle with -PRON- 
a light quick step sound in the hall accompany by a musical tinkling of ice in a pitcher 
a knock fall on the door and a boy enter the room with water telegraphblank and write material 
wait say bremerton 
-PRON- brain whirl as -PRON- rise from the bed and seat -PRON- at a small table 
a drink of icewater refresh -PRON- somewhat and -PRON- slowly write out the following message silas deane 
denver 
arrive phoenix this evening 
work promise to be interesting 
off for mine tomorrow 
bremerton 
-PRON- give telegram arid money to the boy and send -PRON- away 
then as well as -PRON- be able -PRON- look after -PRON- injury and go to bed 
a not always in real life do name fit the character of those who bear -PRON- 
as a case in point mortimer king cyanid expert at the mariquita mine be anything but regal anything but manful and twohande in -PRON- sway over man and affair 
from a to -PRON- know -PRON- cyanid work 
there be keenness and penetration in -PRON- mild washedout blue eye 
from a glass of solution hold up to the light -PRON- could almost determine by sight alone how many pound of potassium cyanid should be throw into the big vat to bring -PRON- content up to standard 
and there be those who say that by merely glance at a handful of tailing -PRON- would figure -PRON- -PRON- worth in ton lot to a cent 
but -PRON- be not even primerwise in a knowledge of human nature and -PRON- be a child in tact and diplomacy and a mere babe in arm when -PRON- come to meet a hard situation with judgment and energy 
lacey have know this when leave king in charge 
rack with pain and half delirious when bear away from the mariquita -PRON- have be in no condition to pick and choose a successor pro tern 
even so -PRON- have yet have no second choice whatever -PRON- other shortcoming king be the only man at the mine who in the absence of the superintendent would be loyal to deane 
two week lacey have be go 
-PRON- be week of mental distress for king who realize fully -PRON- own incompetence 
if affair have go badly under lacey -PRON- nearly go to smash under king 
about all the cyathid expert hope for be to hold the mine organization together until the new man arrive to fill the place vacate by lacey 
trouble begin almost before lacey have be carry over the hill in the mine buckboard 
the miner strike for high pay although -PRON- be re ceive well wage than be be pay at any other mine in that district 
-PRON- strike apparently just to be contrary and worry mortimer king 
with no mining go on the orehauler have to be lay off with no drill to point the blacksmith and -PRON- helper be out of a job and with nothing to mill the millman be force into idleness 
then the spirit of unrest lay hold of the cyanid worker and one by one -PRON- drift away to loaf with the other 
king be at -PRON- wit end and telegraph wildly to deane go to pot the new man 
and to this deane answer in characteristic vein keep -PRON- shirt on 
new man on the job thursday morning 
king begin count the day until thursday 
on wednesday some unknown person smuggle a supply of red liquor into camp 
steve bryden otherwise know as big steve begin imbibe and slowly and systematically work -PRON- up to concert pitch 
-PRON- make an art of get in tune as -PRON- call -PRON- 
in twentyfour thirtysix or fortyeight hour accord to -PRON- own prearranged schedule -PRON- would strike high then as king very well know the super pro tem would have difficulty keep -PRON- scalp on let alone -PRON- shirt 
the cyanid expert would have send to phoenix for the sheriff 
there be nobody to send however and -PRON- dare not leave the mine -PRON- 
wednesday night big steve get a sledgehammer from the desert blacksmithshop and joyously break all the window in the bunkhouse 
just want to tease somebody -PRON- explain when king venture a feeble remonstrance 
the little devil in -PRON- drinkmaddened brain be grow 
the mexican flee to -PRON- jacal and herded -PRON- wife and child behind closed door 
the american and halfblood move -PRON- blanket to a dry wash and post a guard 
wun sing the cook barricade -PRON- in the chuck shanty 
from the laboratory king tear with conflicting emotion watch the trail from and hope against hope 
-PRON- be know that big steve have a dark past 
but -PRON- have not acquire -PRON- in -PRON- sober moment 
not much of good could be say of -PRON- when -PRON- brain be clear although in that state -PRON- be never openly lawless 
in drink all -PRON- evil fly brazenly uppermost and -PRON- black folly know no bound 
bar king the american at the mariquita mine be a poor lot 
laborer of the well class would not work there for the taking off of griggsby have give the property a hard name presence be a necessity 
-PRON- be the accredit agent of a denver company that own cyanide right and king see to -PRON- that royalty be pay from every cleanup 
big steve be not the bad of the american when sober but -PRON- be far and away the bad of -PRON- when tune 
and from the other king could expect no aid 
-PRON- be throw wholly upon -PRON- own resource and these as already observe be weak and scattering 
thursday morning big steve carry -PRON- pleasantry a little further 
break down the door of the chuck shanty -PRON- drive forth the luckless wun sing and chase -PRON- out of camp 
so along with the mine the mill the blacksmithshop and the cyanid plant the chuck shanty go out of business 
king live on sardine and cracker 
how the other american live -PRON- do not know nor care 
-PRON- have -PRON- to worry about 
-PRON- naked eye could not reach far enough 
from the laboratory -PRON- be now scan the trail with binocular 
that be thursday morning and why do not the new superintedent come 
the sun pass the meridian and slowly descend upon a stricken camp despair grow as the day fade and no one arrive to take over -PRON- responsibility 
reason tell -PRON- to flee under cover of that thursday night and while there be yet time 
duty warn -PRON- to remain in spite of big steve and what big steve may do 
yes -PRON- would stay -PRON- must stay 
but -PRON- wish -PRON- have something to shoot with 
the cyanid expert do not close -PRON- eye between sunset and dawn 
at eight in the morning -PRON- creep cautiously toward the end of the pipeline to renew -PRON- water supply 
then big steve rush from the chuckshanty and brandish a blade which wun sing use for peeling potato drive the unhappy expert pellmell in the direction of the headquarters adobe 
the officedoor be lock 
king -PRON- have secure -PRON- and at that moment the key be in the laboratory 
white and shake the expert turn and flatten out against the adobe wall 
yah taunt big steve pause a dozen foot away and leer with -PRON- bloodshot eye -PRON- good for say 
-PRON- voice be thick but -PRON- keep -PRON- foot steadily 
-PRON- whole bearing be one of terrible menace 
clear out -PRON- big brute answer king shake the tin waterbucket -PRON- dare come nearer -PRON- with that knife 
-PRON- ought to be ashamed of -PRON- 
by george report -PRON- for this 
-PRON- be a gallant effort to hold -PRON- own 
what -PRON- cost the little cyanid worker a man of more spartan fiber could never know get no more sand than a chipmunk howl big steve even an apology for a real man plumb annoy at have -PRON- around 
king -PRON- little wart here where -PRON- cash in 
a line of head rim the edge of the distant dry wash 
a swarthy ragged palpitating group watch proceeding from the mexican quarter 
all know that big steve have reach the climax of deviltry that the grand finale be about to be stage and that immediately follow -PRON- -PRON- reign of terror would be overwhelm by a period of sleep and helplessness 
but would -PRON- kill the little man with the waterbucket 
not one of those who look on from a distance would have give a copper cent for chance 
king probably would not have give much more -PRON- 
slowly deliberately big steve advanced upon -PRON- intend victim 
the millman face be puffy and splotch with red a crazy glare fill -PRON- eye and as -PRON- move onward -PRON- tuck up -PRON- right sleeve with -PRON- hairy left hand 
-PRON- king there 
run 
one of those at the edge of the dry wash offer the advice 
-PRON- be useless however nerve have buckle under the strain and -PRON- be pin to the adobe wall by the grow horror of -PRON- dilemma 
-PRON- be like a rabbit fascinate by the diamond eye of a rattlesnake 
approach hoof sound suddenly from near at hand 
neither king nor big steve seem to hear -PRON- 
the trail into camp wound around the end of the office building and a horse carry a double burden presently emerge into view 
an erect figure in corduroy and lace kneeboot face decorate with several small square of courtplaster occupy the saddle at the cantle astride the double war bag sit the chinaman wun sing 
one glance at the state of affair by the headquarters adobe be enough for the chinaman 
with a gurgle cry of fear -PRON- tumble from the horse and flee to a safe distance 
at the dry wash and in the mexican quarter a fresh interest be inject into the situation 
here be a stranger possibly the new man who be take place 
-PRON- have no more than strike camp before be call upon to dispute with big steve the right to rule 
what would -PRON- do 
how would -PRON- conduct -PRON- intensely stir by the progress of event the american come out of the dry wash and advance a few rod 
the mexican also take place for a nearer view 
for king the uncanny spell be break 
a cry of relief break from -PRON- lip and -PRON- fling up -PRON- arm and crumple weakly down on the office doorstep 
big steve have withdraw -PRON- attention from the cyanid expert and fasten jt upon the newcomer the new boss hey the niillman fling savagely at the rider 
i be be the crisp response 
not sos -PRON- can notice -PRON- whoop big steve be the boss here for three hull day and the job please -PRON- a heap

big steve wave the knife about -PRON- head 
none of the boss last at the mariquita 
come over here if -PRON- get the sand come over here and git scalp 
bremerton fling the rein over -PRON- horse head swing down from the saddle and start toward big steve 
-PRON- neither hurry nor lag 
-PRON- merely stroll in big direction unarm apparently and with -PRON- compelling gray eye fix unswervingly upon the face of the troublemaker 
more than one of the spectator catch -PRON- breath and feel a chill of grisly forebode 
king try to shout a word of advice and warning but -PRON- tongue clove to the roof of -PRON- mouth 
big steve have plant -PRON- firmly on -PRON- stocky leg and -PRON- right hand with the short ugly blade be poise for a blow 
-PRON- stand like a man of stone while bremerton draw close 
then a most astounding thing happen 
quick as chainlightne bremerton grip the upraised wrist and wrench -PRON- downward and sidewise 
the knife fall from big finger and over the capture right arm master and man look into each other face bind 
big steve be accustomed to have -PRON- own way when -PRON- brain be befog with liquor 
no doubt the surprise of find some one who be not afraid of -PRON- have take -PRON- aback for the moment and give bremerton the advantage 
with a bellow of rage be wrench -PRON- arm free 
bremerton kick the knife toward king and step back warily kill -PRON- for that fume big steve run -PRON- word together in a way that make -PRON- almost unintelligible 
-PRON- be lose -PRON- steadiness and -PRON- stagger as -PRON- rush at bremerton 
the latter move to one side thrust out a foot and the millman stumble over -PRON- and lurch headforemost to the ground 
-PRON- strike heavily and -PRON- forehead come in contact with a stone which be half embed in the gravelly soil 
a wheezy gasp escape -PRON- a tremor run through -PRON- huge body and -PRON- fling -PRON- arm wide and lie still 
bremerton stare at -PRON- a moment in silent contempt 
turn to king -PRON- ask be this the fellow who chase the chinaman out of camp 
yes be the answer 
big steve have be on a tear ever since wednesday

i wouldnot have be in -PRON- shoe for all the gold in arizona 
who be -PRON- amalgamator in the millone of the good amalgamator in the business 
-PRON- have -PRON- peculiarity though no room here for a man of -PRON- stripe 
when -PRON- sleep off that jag send -PRON- to -PRON- for -PRON- time 
here -PRON- 
bremerton beckon to the man near the dry wash 
i need some of -PRON- 
-PRON- come forward with alacrity 
what -PRON- have just see have inspire a certain amount of respect for the new superintendent 
carry this man away order bremerton 
one of -PRON- put out -PRON- horse and bring the ride gear to the affice 
one minute first 
-PRON- whirl and run the man over with a sharp appraising eye 
what be -PRON- do over there while that big ruffian be try to massacre the little fellow the man shift about uneasily 
one of -PRON- finally speak pilgrim when big in likker weall make -PRON- a pint to hide out and watch keerful 
meddlin with steve at -PRON- time be uncommon risky 
mean to say -PRON- be all scared 
wall now i donot reckon say skeere a mighty sight of diffence between be skeere and exercisin plain caution with a madman like steve when -PRON- s on the rampage 
i allow -PRON- plumb hypnotize -PRON- be drink too say bremerton quick to read the sign 
hereafter when any of -PRON- want to get drunk -PRON- will do -PRON- in phoenix and not at the mariquita mine take place understand 
while in charge there will be no whisky in camp 
remove that man and look after -PRON- horse 
on the jump 
bremerton pull the saddle bag from behind the cantle and pass to the officedoor 
king anticipate a demand for the office key have hurry to get -PRON- from the laboratory 
when thing begin to go wrong here mr bremerton -PRON- explain i think well lock up the office 
-PRON- be mortimer king yes 
the new superintendent step through the doorway into the square little room where the clerical work be carry on 
king have pause to watch three of the man pick up big steve 
two or three article drop from the amalgamator coat while -PRON- be be lift 
one be a bag of tobacco another a flask and still another ivas a square of dingy chamois skin 
well gather up that stuff and take -PRON- along say king 
hold on a minute interpose bremerton 
-PRON- hurry out of the office and set -PRON- heek on the flask 
for a moment -PRON- eye rest on the chamois skin 
an exclamation escape -PRON- and -PRON- stoop and pick -PRON- up 
-PRON- stuff the chamois skin into -PRON- pocket as -PRON- go back into the office 
now mr king say -PRON- justr what be the situation here 
i find the chinaman camp out at a waterhole between here and town 
-PRON- tell -PRON- a little but only enough to make -PRON- anxious for more 
bremerton sit down in front of the rolltop desk take pipe and tobacco from -PRON- pocket and prepare for a smoke 
king draw up a chair sink into -PRON- and compose -PRON- agitate nerve 
there be something about the new superintendent that inspire confidence 
courage and determination be quality which never fail to command the wholesome respect of enemy and the trust of friend 
as the weak vessel king defer humbly to bremerton glad that deane have secure such a man to captain the dubious fortune of the mine 
a strong face shine lividly in the light of the match bremerton trail over the pipebowl 
bruise discolored and with here and there a black patch along with -PRON- grimness the face contrive to reflect an amiable as well as a dauntless spirit 
little mortimer king warm to the man and do not hesitate to confess -PRON- own failing 
i be a pretty poor stick for lacey to leave in charge bremerton say -PRON- 
i have no sense or sand in deal with the neardesperadoe on this mine payroll 
the man know -PRON- and lacey be hardly carry over the hill before -PRON- begin to take advantage bear down on -PRON- king return bremerton 
sometimes the difficulty that be one man meat be another man poison 
a few in this world be equip for one thing and a few for some other thing 
the master potter fashion the clay from design and pattern of -PRON- own 
-PRON- be not -PRON- business to go behind the return and try to puzzle out the reason 
go on and tell -PRON- about the situation here 
king be surprised to find bremerton as forceful in thought as well as in action 
-PRON- do not know of the lonely year bremerton have spend in the wild commune with -PRON- as -PRON- trod the unblazed trail or guess at the heart of thing as -PRON- lie on a blanket look up at the star 
the cyanid expert begin at the beginning 
-PRON- tell of the strike among the miner and how the failure of the ore supply have paralyze all the other activity of the camp 
as an idle man be always ripe for trouble report lead up logically to the whiskydrinking and the cut loose of big steve 
bremerton listen quietly and when king pause remark a wonder -PRON- didnot cut and run 
but i be leave in charge exclaim the expert 
-PRON- be -PRON- business to stay here no matter what happen 
a quizzical light fill gray eye yet -PRON- nod soberly 
i see 
when a man do -PRON- good there be nothing more to be say 
when do -PRON- have -PRON- last clean up at the mill just after the miner quit work 
the millman hang on for a while and i keep -PRON- busy scrape the plate 
how do the cleanup pan out slim always slim and not what -PRON- ought to be what bother lacey andand poor old griggsby 
-PRON- mill ten ton of rock work both shift 
the orefeeder throw out every tenth shovelful as the ore go into the hopper 
i quarter the sample down and get a value of twelve dollar and some odd cent to the ton no bonanza rock about that cut in bremerton be no bonanza rock mill since deane take over the property 
if -PRON- here -PRON- havenot be able to find -PRON- 
the tailing come from the plate assay something over two dollar to the ton 
the difference of about ten dollar a ton or a hundred dollar for a twentyfour hour millrun should be leave on the plate 
but -PRON- isnot there 
the good -PRON- can show the good -PRON- have ever be able to show since deane secure this property be seven hundred to a thousand dollar for every two week cleanup 
fifty dollar a day muse bremerton not enough to pay expense be rob 
griggsby think so and lacey be of the same opinion 
but -PRON- couldnot prove anything 
the leak wherever -PRON- be have be too well covered 
-PRON- be right in say -PRON- donot pay expense with the mill 
the cyanid plant be just able to cover the shortage 
that of course doesnot leave anything for -PRON- s not run a mine for the love of -PRON- 
no king -PRON- doesnot do much of anything for the mere love of -PRON- bremerton remark dryly go into all this later 
i havenot be -PRON- for a couple of day and the ride from town rather fag -PRON- 
i think rest until after dinner 
where do i bunk king get up and open a door off the side of the room 
here be where griggsby and lacey have -PRON- sleep quarter say -PRON- 
if -PRON- would rather not sleep here though there s a more comfortable place down at the laboratory 
this will do 
tell the miner to see -PRON- after the noon meal have -PRON- hereif -PRON- will come 
the man that doesnot come hunt another job 
impress that on -PRON- 
king leave the office 
as soon as -PRON- be go bremerton get up go to the table and remove a handkerchiefwrapped package from one of the saddlebag 
-PRON- unlock the desk and push back the rolltop 
a litter of paper lie under -PRON- eye just as leave by lacey 
-PRON- brush the paper aside untie the handkerchief seat -PRON- and lean forward to examine the ball of amalgam a clue all right -PRON- mutter a bit f luck right at the startoff see how that match the mark on the mend chamois 
the chamois skin drop from the pocket of the unconscious big steve be an old one 
almost in -PRON- very center a jagged tear have be mend with needle and thread 
the sewing have be do by whip the thread over and over along the edge of the tear leave an upraised surface 
this surface mark match the indentation in the bottom of the amalgam ball perfectly 
-PRON- be evidence indisputable evidence that the mend chamois have be use in squeeze some of the quicksilver out of that particular lump of amalgam 
circumstance point a damn finger at big steve 
-PRON- lead also to interesting speculation regard the finding of that steal silver ball among the cottonwood by the phoenix town canal 
while bremerton bent thoughtfully over the desk a sheet of paper meet -PRON- eye on top of the heap -PRON- have push aside 
pick -PRON- out of the litter -PRON- read the follow write in fine feminine chirography mr lacey if -PRON- will come to -PRON- at the arroyo at nine this evening i will tell -PRON- something of great importance to -PRON- 
trust -PRON- this once and -PRON- will not regret -PRON- 
mariquita maleory 
bremerton drop back in -PRON- chair a savage exclamation on -PRON- lip the note that lure lacey into a trap -PRON- murmur and drop -PRON- on the desk and strike -PRON- with -PRON- clenched fist 
a long hard ride from phoenix have almost wear -PRON- out 
-PRON- have spend the whole of the precede day in bed and every movement of -PRON- bruised limb have bring -PRON- pain 
in the small hour of that friday morning -PRON- have dress bargain at the near corral for a horse and before sunrise have put mile behind -PRON- on the way to the mariquita mine 
at first -PRON- stubborn will have to goad -PRON- batter body into action 
as -PRON- ride progress however -PRON- stiffen limb and flag muscle yield with grow grace to the grim purpose that drive -PRON- 
-PRON- iron physique dormant for a space recuperate swiftly 
-PRON- be like a machine which slow to start at first presently yield to the spell of motion and run with increase ease and power 
not until -PRON- enter the headquarters adobe have -PRON- be conscious of any feeling of fatigue 
-PRON- have dismiss king and plan to lie down for a brief rest 
but -PRON- could not leave the desk until -PRON- have test the clue of the amalgam ball and the chamois skin and now that brief note from the mallory girl arouse feeling that make rest impossible 
-PRON- get to -PRON- foot lean against the top of the desk and sweep -PRON- eye around the office 
there in premise just take over by -PRON- griggsby and lacey have live and and lacey the unfortunate man who have precede -PRON- in the service of deane 
the letterfile on the shelf the map on the wall the cabinet of ore specimen the letterpress the table in the center of the room the picture of the martyr garfield hang near the doorall these trifle detail of the room appeal to -PRON- strongly 
-PRON- constitute surrounding which griggsby and lacey have know to -PRON- sorrow 
a black memory be over everything and the mallory be the cause 
bremerton frowning darkly swear to -PRON- that -PRON- would bring home to the girl and -PRON- father the consequence of -PRON- deed 
make a win proposition of the mariquita mine be but a part of -PRON- work the other part be to make sure that justice have -PRON- due 
for the killing of griggsby the wounding of lacey and the work of that cowardly gang by the phoenix town ditch some one should pay 
bremerton pass to the open door and lean there look out upon the camp 
the mine lie in a shallow valley border with bleak hill cover with cactus clump 
the ramshackle structure housing the tenstamp mill stand at the left perch on the top of an incline of the valley floor 
flank the mill on one side be the cyanid tank and hard by the tank be the shakeroofed shakesided laboratory building 
in the middle distance be the bunkhouse with -PRON- shatter window 
to the right of the bunkhouse stand the chuckshanty 
beyond wun headquarters be a cleft in the valley wall in which be huddle the jacal of the mexican 
between mill and bunkhouse be post the derrick with -PRON- whip and the shafthouse with -PRON- hoisting engine 
the whole valley be gouge and gophere and sprinkle with heap of country rock 
the road from the shaft to the head of the mill have be powder white by hoof and wheel and gleam in the sun like a trail of whitewash 
there be nothing allure in the scene nothing even picturesque 
the valley wear a forbidding threatening look 
like a long black serpent the pipeline trail past the mexican quarter coil around the chuckshanty and rear an ugly spouting head midway between the bunkhouse and the headquarters adobe 
a branch of -PRON- crawl on to the cyanid tank and the mill 
silence brood over the place 
the man from the dry wash be loaf about the bunkhouse and there be activity manifest among the mexican 
big steve have cease to rule the camp and the laborer be take heart 
a new superintendent have come and while -PRON- may not last long yet -PRON- protect arm be over the property for a time at least 
and price for this junkheap mutter bremerton be half a million 
i be the connect link between deane and that money -PRON- last chance -PRON- only hope for a big cleanup 
well -PRON- shall see 
if there s anything well than tendollar rock here go to find -PRON- 
-PRON- leave the door take an automatic revolver from one of the saddlebag and carry -PRON- with -PRON- into the sleepingroom 
there be a musty smell in the cramped quarter and -PRON- raise a window 
before lie down on the cot -PRON- place the weapon handy by on a chair 
with a sigh of relief -PRON- stretch -PRON- out on the blanket of -PRON- creak bed 
-PRON- relax every tired muscle but -PRON- do not want to sleep and -PRON- mind keep busy 
mentally -PRON- catalogue the successive step of the work before -PRON- 
first the mine must be put in run order 
next the leak in the mill must be investigate 
follow that -PRON- would learn why the property have be call a bonanza with only tendollar rock find -PRON- way to the stamp 
a duty which may come first or last or distribute -PRON- over the entire process of rehabilitate the mine be search out the stealthy force engage in a deathgrapple with deane 
to reorganize the worker and keep in motion the wheel of mining milling and cyaniding be the small part of problem 
judgment and determination would take care of that 
probe the thievery in the mill would not be so difficult now that bremerton have a reliable clue big steve be not a man to be discharge the superintendent now decide but to be retain keep at work and watch 
-PRON- be the key to the miss amalgam 
with only a tenstamp mill to grind out rock whose gross assay value be but little well than ten dollar to the ton the mariquita mine could never approach the splendid proportion of a bonanza property 
here there be something wrong 
deane be altogether too smart a speculator to be hook by a job of salt 
when -PRON- secure the mine -PRON- have certainly know what -PRON- be do 
nor would the mallory fight so savagely to keep deane out of -PRON- right if the object of that fight be such a poorpaying proposition as show on -PRON- face 
-PRON- must know something that old plotter and -PRON- girl 
yet what be -PRON- -PRON- know one answer to this question be a fabulously rich lead a lead know to the mallory but lose to griggsby and lacey 
while mallory have work the mine under bond -PRON- have pay huge return 
those return have capture the grasp fancy of deane man however have fail to make the mine pay anything more than run expense 
the only explanation of such a state of affair be a rich vein on the property which have defy the effort of griggsby and lacey to find -PRON- 
-PRON- be possible that suqh a vein may have be work out and exhausted 
dispute this theory be the fact that the mallory would not fight for a mine whose ore be hardly worth the trouble of dig and milling 
no the mallory have an object in keep up that struggle with deane 
there be a reef of gold which uncover once must be bring to light again 
as big steve be the key to the miss amalgam so the mallory be a key to that lose lead thought cover these various topic slowly and methodically 
-PRON- want to be sure of -PRON- ground as -PRON- mentally pace -PRON- off 
two or three hour pass and -PRON- finally become aware that -PRON- eye be absently regard a frame photograph on the adobe wall 
absorb in -PRON- reflection -PRON- have look at that picture without see -PRON- 
now abruptly -PRON- recognize the original of the photograph and sit up suddenly on the cot 
another picture frame among the cottonwood and light with the moon beam flash out before -PRON- 
this picture on the wall be the same even to the lustrous tress with the fullblown rise tangle among -PRON- 
get to -PRON- foot -PRON- walk around the foot of the cot and snatch the picture from the wall 
-PRON- be frame in cactuswood and -PRON- stare at -PRON- with hard eye 
have griggsby place -PRON- there 
or lacey 
-PRON- could not bring -PRON- to think that either of -PRON- predecessor have be so foolish 
very likely -PRON- be a souvenir of the day when mallory be work the mine 
griggsby and lacey have merely leave -PRON- hang on the wall 
bremerton mutter a fierce imprecation and drive -PRON- fist through the frame 
twist the cactuswood apart -PRON- fling the fragment out of the window 
then -PRON- pick up the picture tear -PRON- in piece and fling the scrap after the wreck of the frame no room here for even a picture of shedemon say bremerton with a scowl 
a fine souvenir for -PRON- to look at 
the eye of a wildcat 
every glance of -PRON- would remind -PRON- of the note that lure lacey into a trap 
some one enter the outer room 
a shuffle footstep cross the floor halt and a thin voice call missa blemton 
-PRON- step out of the sleep apartment and find wun sing hold a cover tray and smile blandly 
what do -PRON- want sing -PRON- ask 
-PRON- blingee chuck 
missa king tellee -PRON- -PRON- sick 
plap -PRON- likee eatee chuck in office huh get -PRON- wrong not sick eat with the man sing 
take the food back to the chuckshanty 
wun face show chagrin and disappointment 
-PRON- waver a moment then turn and shuffle toward the door 
awri -PRON- remark 
ten minute later bremerton sit at the head of a long table in the chuckshanty 
at -PRON- right sit king 
some twenty face not one of the sort to inspire confidence ring the table from king around to left 
boy observe king a little doubtfully this be mr bremerton the new superintendent 
one or two duck -PRON- head 
a few more grufited 
the majority merely stare and say nothing at all say anything if -PRON- hurt say bremerton with a quiet smile 
-PRON- may not be glad to see -PRON- but donot do any guessing until be better acquaint 
-PRON- must be rather pleasant for -PRON- to have a hot meal after a day or two of live on scrap in the dry wash 
if -PRON- have help king keep order in camp wun sing may have remain on the job 
these word seem to startle some of the man 
a few exchange glance but other bend sullenly over -PRON- plate 
be these miner and millman king inquire bremerton casually as -PRON- begin eat 
both be the reply along with the blacksmith and a couple of orehauler 
the rest of the man be keep house in the mexican quarter 
the man eat like famished animal but -PRON- clean -PRON- plate in a hurry and pass out of the shanty wait outside for -PRON- bremerton confide king in a shiver whisper miner and all 
i tell -PRON- -PRON- want to see -PRON- 
if -PRON- donot raise -PRON- pay -PRON- will start a riot not raise -PRON- pay and -PRON- wonot start any riot 
bremerton pick up -PRON- hat from the floor beside -PRON- chair get to -PRON- foot and proceed calmly through the door 
fill with dire foreboding the little cyanid expert arise and follow 
bremerton realize very well that -PRON- first real fight be just ahead of -PRON- 
every man at table have pass under -PRON- keen scrutiny and be mentally tag 
so artfully be -PRON- do that the man -PRON- do not know -PRON- nor even king 
here be a tool there a sneak fomenter of discontent yonder a weak character who run with the big pack 
two have the courage to be openly defiant and but one of this pair be mark for a leader 
so bremerton register that tableful of worker 
on the swiftness and sureness of -PRON- judgment -PRON- base -PRON- plan for deal with the striker 
the man have form -PRON- into a compact group a few yard from the door of the chuckshanty 
-PRON- number have be increase by the arrival of mexican miner from the jacal and quite a formidablegathering await the new superintendent 
-PRON- have be the privilege of all these miner to see late recruit in action 
-PRON- have be afford a test of -PRON- mettle and a wholesome regard for -PRON- power have be engender in -PRON- mind 
but there be a difference between big steve bryden charge with deviltry and aimlessly demoralize the camp and a crowd of underground worker who present a solid front of opposition and be sway by a common cause 
there be courage in number and the miner be eager to see how bremerton would meet this second test 
if -PRON- weaken -PRON- would walk roughshod over -PRON- feeble authority 
bremerton have halt just outside the chuckshanty door to fill and light -PRON- pipe 
-PRON- look like an attempt at bravado a bluff at hide an attack of nerve and some of the striker laugh jeeringly 
king say bremerton who be the man with the ring in -PRON- ear that be chombo gonzale be the murmured response half american and half mexican a foreman among the digger bremerton and a bad man to get stir up 
and who s the one with the scar on -PRON- right cheek 
collin red collin another foreman 
red be on the day shift and chombo look after the night man 
bremerton be positive that chombo and red be the two key to that little difficulty 
if the two foreman be properly take care of the trouble in the underground working would quickly adjust -PRON- 
the superinterident move out toward the man the reason -PRON- man be not get put the ore collin -PRON- ask 
the red head foreman feel flatter at be single out in this way by bremerton 
-PRON- give -PRON- an importance which chombo resent with an ugly flash of the eye 
the boy think -PRON- ainot pay enough say collin 
three dollar a day for ten hour be what -PRON- get and -PRON- demand four 
why 
because -PRON- want -PRON- that s why put in chombo jump clear of the rank and make -PRON- plain that -PRON- be to be consider in the discussion 
bremerton turn on the halfblood and eye -PRON- calmly talk with collin -PRON- remark 
when ready to talk with -PRON- -PRON- will have a chance to relieve -PRON- mind 
-PRON- canot muzzle -PRON- cry chombo say what i please and when i please 
bremerton peer at -PRON- ominously for a moment then swerve -PRON- gaze back to collin 
how much be other mine in this district pay -PRON- miner -PRON- inquire 
two and a half and three be the reply 
then three dollar for ten hour be about the top price in other mine yes but -PRON- worth more to work at the mariquita 
i understand the mariquita be the safe mine in the district no shore necessary and quarter fairly comfortable 
why -PRON- be worth more to work here because say collin the camp have a black name 
for one thing too much shootin now and then that s liable to go wild for another thing deane get -PRON- on a plain steal and -PRON- ought to give up as much as can be gouge out o -PRON- 
as for the shooting collin return bremerton here to look out for that no concern of -PRON- nor of any of the other 
as for the way deane get hold of the property that be none of -PRON- business 
the miner be pay a good price for work here and that s enough 
-PRON- canot crowd -PRON- with no such talk shout chombo excitedly have -PRON- right or well have nothing 
-PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- right gonzale cut in bremerton 
come to the office in ten minute and get -PRON- time 
chombo stare -PRON- lean body crouching and -PRON- ugly little eye blink 
por dio -PRON- grit 
-PRON- canot fire -PRON- 
but i have assert bremerton do -PRON- last stroke of work at the mariquita mine and as soon as -PRON- be pay off -PRON- will take -PRON- out of camp not have a cur of -PRON- stripe hang around here 
chombo have be finger at the breast of -PRON- flannel shirt 
king suddenly utter a cry of warning 
quick as think the right hand have execute a movement backward and forward and from -PRON- tawny finger have shoot a bright gleam of steel 
bremerton fall sidewise 
the gleam graze -PRON- shoulder fly on to the side of the chuck shanty and strike and hang with a steady glitter 
-PRON- be a knife blazing in the sun and the point be embed in the board wall 
the tragic silence that follow the knifethrowing last for a brief moment 
bremerton right -PRON- lift a hand and the stillness be break by the sharp report of a revolver 
the sound fade into a cry of pain and chombo stand reel on -PRON- foot -PRON- left hand clasp -PRON- right arm and a trickle of red ooze from between -PRON- finger 
try that again snap bremerton and be more particular about -PRON- shooting 
king -PRON- add take -PRON- to the office and pay -PRON- off then watch while -PRON- get a good start along the trail 
collin step over this way 
chombo be cow and have nothing to say 
the rest of the miner watch while king trembling and distraught move toward the office with the halfblood stagger behind -PRON- 
the cyanid expert be expect a clash in which bremerton would get far and away the bad of -PRON- 
bremerton however remember how those man have keep to the dry wash and the mexican quarter while big steve be on parade and -PRON- know -PRON- dare not resent -PRON- treatment of chombo 
the redhajre collin move in direction but -PRON- come humbly and obediently as one who have just endure a shock and be slowly recover -PRON- wit 
the superintendent lead -PRON- aside 
how much be -PRON- get as foreman collin inquire bremerton 
three and a half 
the miner be get every cent -PRON- be entitle to 
i guess -PRON- know this mine be barely pay expense and if the pay be raise all around i shall have to call on deane to cover a shortage lookout not our -PRON- lookout not make no mistake on that score 
-PRON- be a man of influence collin 
i can see that 
if -PRON- tell these miner -PRON- be get the limit -PRON- will believe -PRON- 
in -PRON- case willing to make an exception 
if -PRON- can get -PRON- back to work and keep -PRON- at work from now on -PRON- wage will be five dollar a day 
-PRON- need not say anything about that if -PRON- donot want to 
this be the only concession i will make 
if those man donot begin get out ore this afternoon -PRON- can come for -PRON- time this evening 
greed show in narrow eye to have five a day be -PRON- demand 
yes so long as -PRON- keep the gang at work on bremerton but keep -PRON- quiet see that -PRON- go to work 
without pay any further attention to the striker the superintendent walk on to the office 
chombo be move off along the road tie up -PRON- arm with a red cotton handkerchief as -PRON- go 
king -PRON- face pale under -PRON- tan stand in the office door 
let chombo go say -PRON- will raise the deuce among the mexican a clannish lot bremerton 
i wish explain that to -PRON- before 
bremerton laugh softly as -PRON- push past the little cyanid man and drop into the chair in front of the rolltop desk 
would -PRON- put up with chombo after what happen if -PRON- have be in -PRON- place -PRON- ask 
whatever have do would probably have be the wrong thing be the answer 
but -PRON- the devil own job here at the mariquita to know what s good to do in the pinche 
-PRON- strike -PRON- that the first step be to get rid of the troublemaker fire one and bribe another all in the interest of peace 
the ore will begin to come king 
the man be go back to work yes 
well by gracious 
king be look out of the door 
collin seem to be argue with the man and -PRON- be move toward the shafthouse 
how do -PRON- do -PRON- bremerton i make -PRON- worth while for collin to line up on -PRON- side 
the work must go on here 
after get better acquaint with the situation -PRON- may not be necessary to handle collin with glove see about that later 
start the cyanid gang at once 
if -PRON- have any further trouble with -PRON- call -PRON- 
king take fresh heart leave the headquarters adobe and start toward the tank 
-PRON- find -PRON- own worker in a most receptive frame of mind 
not one of -PRON- have any faultto find over the treatment of chombo 
later in the afternoon the teamster be haul ore to the platform at the head of the mill 
the stamp be pound and a batteryman be temporarily look after big part of the work 
only a few hour have pass since the new superintendent have arrive at the demoralized camp and already the work of mining and milling have be resume and the big vat be be load with tailing for another run 
if bremerton can only last king be say to -PRON- well do something here yet 
the night shift take hold of the work in mine and mill when the day crew leave off and bremerton sleep that night with the roar of the stamp fill the valleyten 850pound hammer each fall at the rate of ninetyeight time to the minute beat out gold for ultimate success with the eastern syndicate 
big steve be sleep off -PRON- spree in the bunkhouse the vengeful chombo may be plot somewhere in the hill and the gang under leadership of the mallory be probably make ready for the next move 
none of these thing bother bremerton 
-PRON- be -PRON- part to take -PRON- difficulty as -PRON- come and deal with -PRON- as -PRON- judgment counsel at the moment 
-PRON- have make a good start and for the present that suffice 
a saturday and sunday pass without bring any fresh difficulty for the new superintendent 
the camp which clung to that seared and blight valley like a barnacle to the hulk of some weatherbeaten ship resound with the peaceful activity of mining and milling 
the distant hill be blue and serene and give not the slight hint of harbor enemy who be eager to stalk and slay 
bremerton settle comfortably into the routine of -PRON- work 
-PRON- come and go about the mining property with the perfect nonchalance of one to whom fear and worry be unknown 
bart case otherwise know as smear one of the orehauler remark upon the super calmness and apparent ease of mind 
-PRON- address -PRON- to dutch fre the other teamster 
the fool ainot get sense enough to know -PRON- s a marked man dutch 
vat i care be the passiveresponse a goner in two week i bet -PRON- -PRON- bet i donot care nuther but -PRON- will be plumb interestin to bet and then watch for what happen 
lie -PRON- a dozen bag o smokin -PRON- s still on the job come two week saturday 
i donot get smoke much easy as dot smear a go 
in this manner tenure of life become a gamble among the man 
but smear be unjust 
the superintendent be not a fool 
-PRON- understand thoroughly that -PRON- be gamble with fate 
the stake be large however and -PRON- be cheerfully take a gambler chance 
monday morning two event come to pass 
one bremerton be expect 
the other be a surprise 
directly after breakfast big steve holloweye -PRON- cheek flabby and of a sickly yellow tinge tramp heavily into the office and range -PRON- alongside the desk 
-PRON- emit a rasp cough by way of claim the superintendent attention 
bremerton be study a pencil map of the mariquita property 
-PRON- do not look up until big steve have bring a hamlike fist smase down on the desk top 
think go to wait here all day demand the amalgamator after -PRON- time 
bermerton sit back and regard the huge form fixedly 
oh -PRON- -PRON- be -PRON- -PRON- ask 
yes -PRON- -PRON- and here for -PRON- money 
go to quit the flabby jaw fall open and the sink eye stare that what -PRON- say demand big steve -PRON- tell the boy to break -PRON- to -PRON- that i be fire 
i believe i do but change -PRON- mind 
bryden -PRON- heed an amalgamator merely assess -PRON- for the bunkhouse window and keep -PRON- on if -PRON- have a mind to stay 
big steve drdw -PRON- thick finger across -PRON- head in a puzzled way then think bremerton be afraid to discharge -PRON- -PRON- laugh craftily 
oh stay but i donot pay for no bunkhouse window only fair that -PRON- pay for -PRON- but not insist 
go up to the mill 
the amalgamator tramp out a little more heavily than -PRON- have tramp in 
the new boss be afraid to give -PRON- -PRON- walk paper 
-PRON- look back at the door and chuckle in -PRON- hairy throat 
some time -PRON- would have another chance at bremerton and -PRON- would see which of -PRON- could run that camp 
-PRON- be paw the bruise on -PRON- temple and still chuckle as -PRON- walk to the head of the mill 
king little as -PRON- know about the management of man think that bremerton have make a grave mistake 
at any cost bryden should have be make to go 
among -PRON- the man wonder 
most of -PRON- come to the same conclusion as big steve and think that bremerton be afraid to get rid of the amalgamator 
other who remember chombo and the way bryden have be manhandle at the climax of -PRON- lawlessness could not accept the easy conclusion and be at a loss to understand the queer move 
the superintendent be well content to let the matter rest as -PRON- be so long as -PRON- real reason for keep bryden in the mill be not know 
-PRON- be also chuckle over the incident when a beat of approach hoof draw -PRON- eye to a nearby window 
from the rim of the valley a rider be advance along the trail 
the rider be a woman 
-PRON- sit -PRON- horse manwise and -PRON- graceful figure sway rhythmically as -PRON- gallop face harden 
talk about nerve -PRON- mutter 
i tell -PRON- to keep away from -PRON- yet here -PRON- come 
well -PRON- add grimly when -PRON- s do with this visit shell never make another 
-PRON- start to rise preparatory to leave the office and meet the girl outside 
something hold -PRON- to -PRON- chair however and glue -PRON- eye to the window 
mariquita mallory present a picture beautiful by contrast with that seared and blast valley 
-PRON- be not that -PRON- ride with skill and grace 
-PRON- be the girl -PRON- that add a touch to the ugly environmenta soften exquisite touch which catch and hold eye in spite of -PRON- 
there be a place in the mogollon where the sun set as nowhere else in the whole world 
-PRON- have camp on the spot for a week just to see the flame ball go down watch the crimson and gold fade and then feast -PRON- eye on the purple afterglow 
-PRON- be a far cry from the mogollon to the bitter root range in montana and yet bremerton know of a height in the bitter root where the sun never rise as -PRON- rise there 
in the southwest the brazen shield pop upward from the desert rim as though fling abruptly from a mighty hand 
one moment -PRON- be dawn and the next day 
but over that height in the bitter root -PRON- come slowly fling out streamer that grow and grow until the whole east be fill with orange and yellow and the faint western star be blot out one by one 
bremerton have a soul for the finer thing of life 
-PRON- see beauty where other would pass -PRON- by 
with the eye of an artist -PRON- watch that free galloping figure 
the girl wear a broadbrimmed hat 
-PRON- costume be mannish in other way and yet oddly enough there be that about -PRON- which make -PRON- feminine to the last degree 
bremerton be still stare as -PRON- draw close 
-PRON- eye meet through the dusty window 
-PRON- smile and wave a gauntlete hand 
-PRON- face grow stony with the dark thought that suddenly surge within -PRON- 
-PRON- do not get up and leave the headquarters adobe to meet -PRON- 
whirl the chair to face the door -PRON- watch while -PRON- drop the rein dismount lightly and step across -PRON- threshold 
good morning mr bremerton -PRON- say still smile 
-PRON- note the clear soft brown face the comely roundness of the cheek the arch of the throat the castilian languor of the big dark eye 
moonlight have a magic of -PRON- own but -PRON- could not add to the charm of mariquita mallory 
there in broad day -PRON- be infinitely more attractive than when bremerton have see -PRON- among the cottonwood 
why donot -PRON- say something query the silvery voice 
be i welcome or be i not 
like dagger thrust the word of lacey pierce brain 
when -PRON- smile i find -PRON- danger great 
and mariquita mallory be smile 
i tell -PRON- say bremerton to keep away from -PRON- 
-PRON- couldnot have mean -PRON- though -PRON- laugh not really 
-PRON- drop -PRON- head on one side and look at -PRON- critically in much well shape than when i say -PRON- last -PRON- glad i make -PRON- take silverheel and ride to the hotel 
and -PRON- have never say gracia 
perhaps come to give -PRON- the chance to say that 
then i thank -PRON- for something which i do not look upon as an obligation -PRON- return 
that be gratitude with a string tie to -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh 
but no matter 
when be better acquaint mr bremerton i think -PRON- be go to like -PRON- 
i donot mind say that rather predispose ia -PRON- favor already 
i know what -PRON- hare do herehow -PRON- clip the spur of big steve and wing chombo make a very good beginning mr bremerton 
be -PRON- willing to listen to -PRON- 
if -PRON- be go to say anything against deane the black eye kindle the smile fade and leave the lip stern 
i amjust that -PRON- cut in 
then i be not go to listen to -PRON- 
-PRON- get slowly out of -PRON- chair and approach -PRON- 
miss mallory -PRON- go on -PRON- be a woman a very beautiful woman and -PRON- be not go to make -PRON- forget that i be a man and fight a man fight 
-PRON- be a fight that i shall win 
-PRON- and -PRON- father be enemy 
i have reason to believe that -PRON- fight friend from cover with a reckless disregard of life and consequence 
but -PRON- and -PRON- father be not go to stand in -PRON- way 
take -PRON- advice and leave this part of the country before i bring home to -PRON- something which will call for a penalty 
save yourself while there be time 
there be interest in -PRON- eye and -PRON- do net seem displeased 
-PRON- be take the wrong trail -PRON- return earnestly 
i can explain that to -PRON- if -PRON- will let -PRON- 
-PRON- can not afford to make a mistake mr mistake so hideous and farreaching as this of -PRON- be bind to be 
let -PRON- tell -PRON- not a word 
miss mallory -PRON- must know i could not believe -PRON- 
-PRON- have be talk with mr lacey 
naturally i see -PRON- as soon as i could after reach phoenix 
that be no secret to -PRON- or -PRON- father 
i be spy upon from the moment i leave the train 
otherwise that gang of hoodlum would not have be ready for -PRON- 
-PRON- voice be tinge with bitterness 
-PRON- step back and -PRON- eye begin to glow again 
i have tell -PRON- -PRON- have nothing to do with that villainous attack upon -PRON- -PRON- cry 
-PRON- wave -PRON- hand i have a fair amount of raso and judgment -PRON- reply and -PRON- have best give -PRON- credit for that right from the beginning 
deane will never be able to accomplish anything here -PRON- declare sharply no matter who take up the work for -PRON- 
i should hate to see -PRON- go the way griggsby go or suffer as lacey have suffer 
i want to help -PRON- 
then keep hand off 
call away -PRON- gang 
by do that -PRON- will not only help -PRON- but help -PRON- a good deal more 
-PRON- want peace but not at that price 
if -PRON- be to be war between -PRON- and -PRON- father and -PRON- -PRON- be war of -PRON- own bringing 
call -PRON- what -PRON- will i be here to serve deane 
then -PRON- be serve a scoundrel -PRON- flame 
with a superb dramatic gesture -PRON- pull the gauntlet from -PRON- left hand and fling -PRON- down in front of -PRON- 
-PRON- will bring that back to -PRON- on -PRON- knee before -PRON- be do with the mallory -PRON- cry and whirl and run from the office 
-PRON- pick up the glove curiously wonderingly while the beat of -PRON- horse hoof die swiftly away along the trail that lead out of the valley 
actress mutter bremerton actress to the core 
-PRON- throw the small glove upon the table with an angry gesture 
so i be to take that back to -PRON- on -PRON- knee be i -PRON- picture -PRON- crawl at the foot of mariquita mallory and humbly lift that gage of battle which -PRON- have fling at -PRON- 
a grim smile curl -PRON- lip 
i wonder if -PRON- take -PRON- for a coward or a sentimental fool -PRON- feel as though -PRON- have just come off the stage after take part in a scene from a melodrama 
-PRON- annoyance be keen and -PRON- be surprise a moment later to find -PRON- beside the table and again hold the glove in -PRON- hand 
the girl be twoface in -PRON- own mind there could be no doubt about that 
and yet there be something undeniably attractive about -PRON- something winsome appeal 
-PRON- would have give a month pay to hear the truth in the matter of deal for the mariquita mine 
but from what unprejudiced source be the truth to come 
certainly not from the girl 
lacey have find -PRON- mosli dangerous when -PRON- smile 
bremer ton grind out an exclamation and crush the glove in -PRON- strong finger unlock a drawer of the desk -PRON- drop miss property into -PRON- along with the ball of amalgam and the mend chamois skin and turn the key on the collection 
the gleam ball remind -PRON- that -PRON- have work to do and -PRON- leave the office and mount the low incline that lead to the mill 
a man on the ore platform be shovel rock into the crusher 
the superintendent pick up a piece at random and examine -PRON- 
-PRON- be fairly good ore but not the kind that would make the mariquita worth half a million dollar 
-PRON- toss the sample into the hopper and climb through an opening in the rough board wall and descend three or four step to the ore loft 
the stampstem of the two battery be lift and fall with a force that shake the old mill in every part 
the uproar be deafen so close at hand 
the crusherman be also the orefeeder and while -PRON- be busy on the platform outside bremerton have the oreloft to -PRON- 
make -PRON- way between the battery of dancing stampstem -PRON- halt at the edge of the loft and look down into the body of the mill 
directly beneath -PRON- be the millplate cover with a thin sheet of flow water 
the water be stain with the powdered ore wash away from the stamp and carry through the battery screen to the plate 
the quicksilver on the plate capture the gold from the muddy tide and hold -PRON- fast 
for one reason or another a small quantity of the yellow metal would not catch and the water carry -PRON- out of the mill and away to the tailing pile 
gile the batteryman sit in the aisle between the plate keep a vigilant eye upon the box and smoking as -PRON- watch 
at the rear of the mill big steve lean against a bench tie a fresh cloth over the wide mouth of a bottle of quick 
through the door lead into the engine room bremerton could see the engineer who be -PRON- own fireman heave crooked length of mesquit and paloverde into the firebox 
-PRON- be a scene of peaceful activity and offer not the slight hint of dishonest motive on the part of any of the worker 
and yet if there be a leak and if through -PRON- amalgam be dribble away from deane then more than one man in that mill have a hand in the plot 
bremerton become suddenly aware that big steve have finish tinker with the bottle of quicksilver and be look upward at the edge of the oreloft 
a complacent slightly contemptuous grin crease the flabby face of the amalgamator 
bremerton meet the uplifted glance quietly and big steve drop -PRON- eye and shout something to gile 
the batteryman bound up the step to the loft and begin hang up the stamp 
one by one with a piece of board -PRON- lift each stamp in one of the battery and leave -PRON- hang and idle 
there be a knack in the work and gile prove -PRON- efficiency by do -PRON- deftly and quickly 
the roar of the mill be now decrease by half and bremerton be able to compliment gile without shout at the top of -PRON- voice 
gile be minus an eye but the eye that be leave gleamed with pride as -PRON- listen to the approval of the new superintendent 
if big steve have a confederate bremerton be sure -PRON- could not be gile 
-PRON- have not the air of a man with a guilty conscience 
if there be any fault to be find with gile -PRON- be because -PRON- could not see as much crookedness with one eye as -PRON- may have see with -PRON- normal equipment 
bremerton descend a flight of narrow stair to the body of the mill 
big steve be just come out from under the oreloft where -PRON- have be turn the water off from the battery 
-PRON- pull a stubby whiskbroom from -PRON- pocket and step to the side of the plate 
look over the mill -PRON- ask of bremerton casually 
bremerton nod 
big steve begin pass the broom over the plate in wide vigorous circle 
the amalgam ridge and loosen under the sweeping splint 
big steve lay aside the broom and take a square of rubber from -PRON- coat 
clean up a little ask the new superintendent pleasantly 
get to be the reply stick 
liable to shuff off and ride out with the tailing in chunk 
bremerton know well 
the amalgam be safe enough and there be no need of remove any from the plate 
big steve be lie 
this be part of -PRON- method in lift gold 
-PRON- push the rubber across and across the plate mold two ball of amalgam in -PRON- hand and lay -PRON- aside oh a piece of chamois skin 
after that -PRON- scatter quicksilver from the bottle upon the plate dress the plate down with the broom call to gile to start the stamp again and go into the little amalgamator room off the side of the mill 
bremerton follow and watch 
big steve by manner rather than word seem to consider -PRON- presence an intrusion 
how many time a day do -PRON- make this partial cleanup bryden the superintendent ask 
four 
the amalgamator be gather a ball up in the chamois 
-PRON- big fist clamp down on -PRON- tight and the quick ooze through the skin and drop into a bowl 
two ball each time 
big steve remove the first ball lay -PRON- on a shelf behind -PRON- and then begin squeeze the second ball 
work at the amalgamator back bremerton draw a knife from -PRON- pocket open the blade and with -PRON- point make a cross on the low surface of the first ball of amalgam 
the maneuver be entirely lose on big steve 
i donot reckon well get two ball every partial cleanup this run say the amalgamator suddenly as though -PRON- heavy wit have be struggle with question and -PRON- own answer purty lowgrade compare with what -PRON- be usually 
bremerton stroll out of the little room across the body of the mill through the engineer quarter and around to where king be work at the cyanid tank 
what do bryden do with the amalgam -PRON- take from the plate during the day king 
bremerton inquire 
turn itover to -PRON- when -PRON- knock off work in the afternoon be the reply 
night amalgamator do the same thing in the morning 
why 
oh nothing just get the run of the detail 
after supper this evening bring amalgam to the office 
the little expert eye widen 
-PRON- donot think for a minute that big steve -PRON- begin but the superintendent cut -PRON- short bother about what i think king 
whatever -PRON- be be sure -PRON- be nothing to -PRON- discredit 
just bring up the amalgam this eveningand keep the matter quiet 
bremerton go back to the office and resume -PRON- study of the mariquita property as outline on the map holding comprise several claim all know by the one general name and completely fill the little valley and lap over upon the hill that border -PRON- 
where be the bonanza ledge the golden reef which have dazzle deane while the mine be in the hand of mallory or carruther 
bremerton could have swear that -PRON- be somewhere under that scoriate valley and just as surely as -PRON- be there so surely would -PRON- one day discover -PRON- 
for the rest of the morning and all the afternoon -PRON- smoke and reflect the map under -PRON- eye 
-PRON- next step be to go over the property foot by foot and endeavor to locate the lose vein 
next day -PRON- would begin 
follow supper and after the day man have retire to -PRON- quarter and the night man have go into mine and mill for -PRON- work king come with a canvas bag and roll four ball of amalgam out upon the office table 
be that all big steve turn in bremerton inquire 
certainly reply king with a pained look 
i hope bremerton -PRON- donot think hold out anything on -PRON- 
bosh not -PRON- trail on 
how do the ore now run through the mill compare in value with the ore of the last run -PRON- be almost identically the same so far as value be concern 
and the amount mill be the same yes 
bryden say -PRON- be -PRON- practise to have a partial cleanup four time during -PRON- shift and that generally -PRON- get two ball of amalgam from each plate every time -PRON- take the stuff off 
accord to that there should be sixteen ball of amalgam in this lot 
where be the other twelve king appear astounded 
-PRON- never turn in any more than this bremerton 
probably big steve be a bit hazy yet and didnot realize what -PRON- be say 
or -PRON- may have misunderstood -PRON- 
-PRON- be sober enough and i didnot misunderstand -PRON- 
bremerton look at the ball 
the one -PRON- have mark be not among -PRON- 
well -PRON- add presently of all the brazen steal i ever hear of this be the limit 
-PRON- lean back in -PRON- chair peer into startled face and laugh 
what be the matter with griggsby and lacey that -PRON- do not find the leak in the mill -PRON- go on 
-PRON- be so confoundedly simple that a blind man could locate -PRON- not blind parried king 
-PRON- get past -PRON- bremerton 
and griggsby and lacey worry -PRON- head off about the failure of the cleanup to tally with -PRON- assay figure 
take the amalgam back and put -PRON- in the laboratory safe king say the superintendent quietly explain matter to -PRON- later on 
i know why the bullion doesnot tally with -PRON- assay of the millrun but there be a few other thing i donot know and which i must find out as quickly as possible 
keep -PRON- own counsel get to the bottom of this and something will drop and drop hard before many day a wonder by glory that this mine be do as well as -PRON- be everything consider 
king toqk -PRON- bag of amalgam and go back to the laboratory 
-PRON- be sorely puzzle and halfincline to doubt statement regard the discovery of the leak 
of griggsby bremerton know little but for lacey bremerton cherish the respect which one man of resolution and ability will always feel for another of -PRON- kind 
a square look be all bremerton have need to get measure 
and how have -PRON- be possible for big steve so clumsy and bareface in -PRON- thieving to pull the wool over eye 
the deep of human nature be a tangle of mystery 
why or wherein lacey have fail or what -PRON- may ultimately have accomplish have -PRON- be leave to go on with -PRON- work bremerton could not pretend to guess 
but this matter of big steve and the miss amalgam have yield so readily to investigation that the blindness of predecessor especially of a thing for wonder 
bremerton reflect that -PRON- very first day at the mine have give -PRON- a clue 
that clue have infallibly involve bryden 
this advantage however do not tell the whole story of and carelessness or incompetence 
-PRON- may be think bremerton that big steve work differently when lacey be in charge 
the truth may come out sometime 
i canot believe that lacey be so gullible as the development seem to indicate 
-PRON- nee not bother about lacey 
-PRON- be -PRON- own battle and not -PRON- be fight 
there be work to be do that night 
close and lock the desk -PRON- get up and walk into -PRON- sleeping room 
when -PRON- come out into the main office -PRON- have the automatic pistol in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- examine the weapon for a moment under the light then drop -PRON- into -PRON- pocket 
with a whiff down the lamp chimney -PRON- fill the room with darkness 
a moment later -PRON- pass through the door and turn the key in the lock behind -PRON- 
move on the bunkhouse through the gloom -PRON- take up a position behind a heap of stonesa position from which -PRON- could watch the quarter of the sleep dayshift 
-PRON- want to be at the mill so that -PRON- may test the night amalgamator as -PRON- have test big steve 
that part of -PRON- plan would have to wait for the present 
-PRON- be big trail -PRON- be follow and -PRON- must run -PRON- out 
there be no one abroad in the camp -PRON- that hour 
the night man in the mill and in the underground working have no cause to leave -PRON- post 
the blacksmith have point a supply of drill for those in the level and stope and the teamster have heap the ore platform with plenty of rock for the stamp 
those of the camp who be not on duty sleep while the mill roar and the ore gather at the bottom of the shaft 
bremerton run no risk of discovery 
such risk as there be would come later if the superintendent vague hope be realize 
big steve sure of -PRON- and careless in -PRON- villainy be still the peg upon which bremerton hang -PRON- plan 
where have bryden put those twelve ball of amalgam 
even -PRON- would realize the danger of secrete -PRON- in the bunk house 
-PRON- would not let the night passso the superintendent reason without clear away the evidence of -PRON- crookedness 
the time drag slowly 
a lessened clamor from the mill suggest the hanging up of a battery and the removal of amalgam from the plate 
the night amalgamator be cut -PRON- cloth accord to big pattern and all to the financial loss of deane 
the mariquita mine -PRON- seem be be assail from without and within 
the mallory and -PRON- gang be not sole enemy 
there be traitor in camp with whom there must be a reckoning before a searchlight could be turn on the method of the mallory 
all in good time mutter bremerton grimly and meanwhile one thing at a time 
the old mill crashing and clang gleam yellow through every crack in the rough wall and pour -PRON- smoke straight toward the star be a weird and fascinating object 
-PRON- crouch on the crest of -PRON- little hill like some sulky misshapen devil growl as -PRON- gnash at the ore and wheeze as -PRON- spew the thick fog out of the tall black stack 
bremerton be oddly attract by that ramshackle structure flame and howl in the night 
-PRON- eye shift from the mill to the bunkhouse and back again almost continually 
perhaps -PRON- have be at the rock heap two hour perhaps three when a move blot emerge from the bunkhouse shadow and glide toward the trail that lead out of the valley 
bremerton chuckle 
-PRON- vague hope be be realize 
as the shadowy blur lose -PRON- behind the headquarters adobe and reappear in the starlight beyond -PRON- leave -PRON- hiding place and cautiously follow 
once clear of the ruck of the camp the form from the bunk house be throw into clear prominence 
-PRON- be the form of a large steve without a doubtbeare a sack over -PRON- shoulder 
the amalgamator follow the trail 
bremerton more circumspect dodge from one clump of greasewood to another at the trailside 
at the top of the rise to the south big steve turn directly out of the road and move westward along the ridge 
bremerton keep below the crest of the uplift 
at a distance -PRON- may have be of a quarter of a mile fte man with the bag descend the opposite slope and pass from sight 
the millclamor be hush so that the shrill cry of the coyote could be hear 
creep thing to which bremerton give no heed scuttle out of -PRON- way 
-PRON- look down from the ridgetop upon a narrow level of desert at the farther side of which be more hill and the mouth of an arroyo 
big steve be lay a straight course for the arroyo 
-PRON- pause once to emit a whistle 
the signal be answer 
against the arroyo black as a pocket a point of light flare flutter and die out 
bremerton crawl over the top of the ridge and with redouble caution let -PRON- down the slope 
here and there on the level be bit of chaparral 
from screen to screen of bush -PRON- move and finally be as close to the mouth of the arroyo as -PRON- could go without invite discovery 
-PRON- hear a mumble of word 
big steve be talk with some one whom -PRON- have meet 
a match be light and the speck of fire hang over a pipe between the amalgamator lip 
hardly a breath of air be stirring and that faint glow do not waver 
big steve sit on a boulder 
the figure beside -PRON- bent to pick up the bag -PRON- have carry from the bunkhouse 
the face of the stooping form come within the dim circle of light from the match 
-PRON- be face and the light glitter on the ring in -PRON- ear 
there be a sling of white cloth suspend from the neck and in the fold of -PRON- -PRON- right hand rest 
there could not be the least doubt regard the identity of chombo 
here be positive evidence of conspiracy 
chombo have assist big steve in -PRON- stealing while employ at the mine and -PRON- be still active now that -PRON- have be discharge 
how many of those rough worker at the mine be honest and loyal to deane 
the scene at the mouth of the arroyo suggest the question to bremerton and -PRON- be in a mood to distrust every man in the camp except king 
where doubledealing be possible owe to laxity of those in control nearly every one would be find with a hand in -PRON- 
-PRON- be up to bremerton to make the thieve impossible 
the first step to that end would be accomplish by make objectlesson of big steve and chombo 
when the two in the mouth of the arroyo separate the amalgamator return toward the mill by the way -PRON- have come and the halfblood fade into the dark of the narrow valley 
bremerton allow big steve to go -PRON- way and press forward into the arroyo 
-PRON- object be to discover if -PRON- could where the steal amalgam be take by chombo 
in this -PRON- fail 
chombo have vanish completely and to prowl aimlessly around in an attempt to locate -PRON- may have result in disaster to the superintendent 
an examination of the arroyo could wait until the follow day 
the heavy gloom make a night search bad than useless 
bremerton start back towards the ridge 
as -PRON- be climb the slope a rider gallop along the ridgetop come suddenly from nowhere and fling along in the direction of the trail 
-PRON- jaw clamp hard and -PRON- brow wrinkle as -PRON- stand and gaze 
the rider be cut sharply in silhouette against the light background of the night sky 
that swinge graceful figure the broadbrimmed hat the fluttering hair -PRON- could not be mistake 
-PRON- be mariquita mallory 
the girl be swallow up in the shadow as suddenly as -PRON- have appear 
bremerton mutter angrily 
why be -PRON- there 
have -PRON- a part in that scoundrelly work at the mill 
be there really but one set of enemy fight deane 
be the foe within the camp link in deviltry with those outside 
be -PRON- all work together to drive deane out of that mining district somewhere deep down in soul lurk a sense of disappointment 
-PRON- realize that -PRON- have be hope against hope that mariquita mallory in the face of all that have happen may be as inoncent of actual wrongdoing as -PRON- have profess to be 
but evidence be pile upon evidence to prove the contrary 
big steve the thief have meet chombo another thief in the hill 
the girl be there not present at the meeting but handily by to take from chombo the bag of steal amalgam 
quite likely the bag lie across the saddle in front of -PRON- as -PRON- gallop away not make a fool of -PRON- as -PRON- do of lacey bremerton growl 
-PRON- have say that before 
why be -PRON- harp on -PRON- do -PRON- feel -PRON- slip and be -PRON- unwittingly make a stand against an event altogether possible -PRON- spirit be up in arm against -PRON- 
while climb the slope and stride along the ridge -PRON- thought circle around way and mean for gather both mallory in the same snare -PRON- be prepare for big steve and chombo 
if -PRON- s in this -PRON- vow shell pay for -PRON- 
i warn -PRON- 
whatever the cost these foe of be to be put out of business 
-PRON- canot wipe -PRON- out before have -PRON- way with -PRON- 
when -PRON- have get back to the headquarters adobe and have lock -PRON- in the stuffy room -PRON- lpoke at -PRON- watch and find that -PRON- be two oclock 
-PRON- work for the next day and for many day to follow be cut out for -PRON- 
-PRON- be time -PRON- be in bed 
-PRON- thought however give -PRON- no rest 
-PRON- fumble for -PRON- key and start to open the drawer contain the ball of amalgam and the other thing and angrily catch -PRON- up short 
what do i want to look at that stuff for -PRON- mentally ask -PRON- 
and -PRON- have no logical answer for the question 
the mallory be with the amalgam thief 
otherwise how -PRON- be that -PRON- find that first ball of amalgam on the scene of -PRON- struggle by the phoenix town ditch as guilty as the rst of -PRON- -PRON- mutter savagely 
with that conclusion firmly in mind -PRON- dismiss the whole subject of -PRON- night work and go to bed 
the entrance of michael ohara upon the gloomy scene of this chronicle be excellently time for bremerton 
a sordid struggle inspire by the greed of man blacken by treachery and tragedy and with a plaintive note of injustice to some one somewhere ring through -PRON- all need the touch of an ohara to renew faith in the fitness of thing as -PRON- be 
-PRON- should have be play on with a rollick quickstep but not too wild not too clash 
a nocturne perhaps in twofour time dreamy in place but with here and there a laugh at the world for -PRON- folly 
mostly the string if -PRON- please with a lilting of the woodwind and once or twice but no more the drum and the brass 
that be the spirit of the ohara the soul of -PRON- 
but there be trouble in set -PRON- to music 
for this reason may bp -PRON- choose personally to express -PRON- through -PRON- own flute 
-PRON- come suddenly 
-PRON- be a habit -PRON- have 
and gently and unobtrusively 
that be another habit 
bremerton have first discover -PRON- in the desert 
-PRON- burro be dead -PRON- food and water be go 
with -PRON- back to a sahuara cactus -PRON- be wait for the and try to breathe out -PRON- soul through the flute with the harp that once thro hall 
for two year after that -PRON- and bremerton be inseparable 
-PRON- find gold those two but -PRON- be the gold in each other heart 
-PRON- struggle -PRON- starve -PRON- break rock and rip hole in the flinty earth and -PRON- sfettle down at last to sink a shaft on the light of hope -PRON- only find 
but the light go out and hope die and -PRON- have a hole in the ground for -PRON- pain 
between two day ohara decamp leave a note and sixteen silver dollar for bremerton 
the note say briefly fight for -PRON- die for -PRON- but all hell canot make -PRON- saddle -PRON- longer with the curse luck of the ohara 
the sixteen dollar be all -PRON- have in the world 
and when -PRON- go -PRON- be afoot leave the burro and all the meager grubpack for bremerton 
high and low bremerton search for -PRON- but whenever ohara efface -PRON- -PRON- do -PRON- thoroughly 
no trace of the irishman could bremerton find 
for many a month after that heart be sore 
ohara have come into -PRON- life shortly after deane have go out of -PRON- and the loss be a blow 
the friendship of the right man for another who be right be one of the great gift of god 
and -PRON- never end here or hereafter 
on the morning after -PRON- night work in the hill bremerton be waken by soft music outside -PRON- door 
thrill -PRON- sit up on the cot and greedily drink in the melody 
-PRON- be happy but -PRON- be not precipitate 
the way of the man outside be know to -PRON- and -PRON- defer to -PRON- 
to the strain of mollie -PRON- get up deliberately and put on -PRON- clothe 
when -PRON- be quite ready -PRON- go into the outer office and unlocked and open the door 
a hatless man with red hair sit on -PRON- doorstep play a flute 
not by the wild flight of fancy could the man be call handsome 
-PRON- nose be short and -PRON- upper lip be long 
-PRON- eye be a washedout blue and while one of -PRON- look straight at -PRON- the other survey the landscape 
-PRON- be lean and long double up as -PRON- be -PRON- knee all but touch -PRON- chin -PRON- length be painfully in evidence 
but -PRON- be comfortably clothe 
in fact -PRON- whole appearance radiate prosperity 
-PRON- be not an effusive prosperity but an ample amount for creature comfort 
with one eye fix on bremerton and the other look around the corner of the adobe -PRON- continue -PRON- playing 
bremerton take a chair and sit down 
after mollie have be play up and down and across with trill and variation and the chorus three time repeat the player take the flute from -PRON- lip and push -PRON- into a new green cloth bag 
come in ohara say bremerton calmly 
i owe -PRON- sixteen dollar 
divil a cent do -PRON- owe -PRON- and the wide mouth of ohara open in a roar of laughter owe -PRON- a thousand this minute bremerton and no one have be able to see -PRON- for dust in the rush make look for -PRON- change a little a very little for ohara or never have venture to run onto -PRON- trail 
the debt -PRON- mind could have be cancel by post 
-PRON- pull -PRON- up from the step shake -PRON- angular frame and come into the little room 
twist a package of banknote out of an inside pocket -PRON- fling -PRON- to bremerton 
well by glory 
bremerton stare at the money as though hypnotize 
a thousand plunk say ohara grinning 
count -PRON- 
where have -PRON- make a raise mike 
and why in blaze be i entitle to a share in -PRON- so -PRON- will be lookin a gift horse in the mouth will -PRON- 
shame on -PRON- for tryin to dodge good money at the hand of a friend no safe be crackin no strongarm work in -PRON- at all at all 
och -PRON- boy -PRON- could never guess 
-PRON- think -PRON- a limestone stringer with not much under the grassroot but heartache and disappointment 
sure -PRON- never make a big mistake 
lee the old light have make good to the chune of a couple of thousand 
by the same token -PRON- half be there in that wad 
now will -PRON- behave bremerton look incredulous 
ohara hasten to explain 
this be the way of -PRON- and on -PRON- soul -PRON- canot be more surprised than i be when the miraculous truth hit -PRON- in the face 
tis six month go since i be near that spot where -PRON- live and labor and lose faith 
i go to see that beautiful hole over which -PRON- would crack -PRON- back and will -PRON- believe -PRON- -PRON- be deep than when -PRON- leave -PRON- and a bit of a crosscut have be run and six man be takin out ore that would have make -PRON- eye bulge 
the claim have be jump so help -PRON- 
and why not with no assessment work do for a year 
oh the fool -PRON- be not to be thinkin of that crosscut 
bremerton be dumfounde 
and yet -PRON- nee not have be 
occasionally such thing be happen in the mining country and as long as man dig for gold -PRON- will continue to happen 
but the two thousand say bremerton 
if the claim be jump i donot see why the newcomer have to buy -PRON- 
tis there the laugh come in proceed ohara crinkle -PRON- cross eye 
-PRON- be in -PRON- name do -PRON- mind and -PRON- have a quitclaim to half 
-PRON- location be file but -PRON- hadnot take the trouble to file -PRON- quitclaim 
-PRON- know of -PRON- those claimjumper and -PRON- imagine trouble where none could be make and give -PRON- the two thousand to sheer off 
i get -PRON- without passin -PRON- hat and -PRON- wrap -PRON- long leg around the chair and nearly choke with mirth 
never before for bremerton have fortune go to such length to give -PRON- a bit of a smile 
-PRON- appreciate the humor of -PRON- yet if -PRON- have not the wild joy of ohara would have force a laugh out of sheer sympathy 
the good part of -PRON- mike say bremerton be that luck have turn for -PRON- 
faith be the response the long lane be bind to have a turn 
not be able to turn for the bad -PRON- have to be for the well 
as soon as i have the money in -PRON- jean i set off look for -PRON- 
the divil own chase -PRON- lead -PRON- 
here -PRON- be grubstakin for a month in the hill and there -PRON- would come in with -PRON- chuck go and the burro no more than skin and bone 
maybe -PRON- be carpenter work -PRON- do or clerkin in a store or drivin stage until -PRON- would amass enough capital for another pasear in the wild 
och lad but -PRON- be a hard one to come up with when the gold fever in -PRON- and the heart of -PRON- cryin for the lonesome trail 
but i keep along until i find the place where -PRON- skin -PRON- of -PRON- property to buy a ticket to denver 
then i know and the smile face go long and the fade mismatched eye grow dull 
i know by -PRON- soul that -PRON- would knuckle under to deane 
ohara have no use for deane 
an honest irishman no matter if -PRON- be out at elbow will think of -PRON- codscience twice for every once -PRON- mention a pirate 
only continue ohara i wish to high heaven get to -PRON- with the thousand in time 
for what have -PRON- sell -PRON- lee 
a paragraph in the paper let -PRON- know -PRON- be here and that deane have hire -PRON- to lay out this property butterside up 
what be the price 
a grim smile flicker across the other lean face 
if -PRON- think sell -PRON- birthright for a mess of pottage mike say hd -PRON- will have to guess again 
now listen go to tell -PRON- something confide to no other live soul and i want -PRON- to get -PRON- straight 
-PRON- go into -PRON- arrangement with deane exhaustively 
not only that but -PRON- follow -PRON- own trail down from denver to the hospital with lacey to the cottonwood by the phoenix town canal to the mine and at last to the mouth of the arroyo 
bremerton could speak to ohara as to no one else 
-PRON- belief -PRON- hope -PRON- intention be all lay naked before the eye of -PRON- friend 
-PRON- have no need to tell of -PRON- confidence in deane for that tingle in every word of -PRON- talk 
but -PRON- do declare -PRON- black suspicion of mariquita mallory and there be a false note strike again and again as -PRON- emphasize -PRON- conviction 
ohara love to drink in the music but -PRON- hate the discord 
man dear but -PRON- be out of chune and -PRON- wabble -PRON- red head gruesomely 
the girl be a fiend of course 
lacey say so 
-PRON- have judgment and penetration although to be sure -PRON- couldnot find the hole in the mill where the amalgam run out but that be simple and eye be all for complication human nature and bitter true that -PRON- would rather take a week hunt for something than travel cross lot for an hour and pick -PRON- up 
but if there be any doubt o the girl duplicity -PRON- settle -PRON- 
beyond a shadow of surmise in the twice -PRON- talk with -PRON- and the once -PRON- see -PRON- gallopin through the night -PRON- smoke out -PRON- true character 
oh the black trick -PRON- play on -PRON- there by the town ditch 
force -PRON- horse on -PRON- at the muzzle of a gunmade -PRON- ride when -PRON- could not walkbullied -PRON- into a comfortable trip back to -PRON- hotel 
troth in hope to be spare till i can get even with -PRON- for that 
-PRON- be bad though when -PRON- come here and want to be friend 
-PRON- be right in not let -PRON- speak of the mine or give -PRON- the why s and wherefore of the sorrywork that have be go on here 
-PRON- may have explode some dynamite under that trust -PRON- have in deane 
then what 
no matter the glove 
begorry and a wry smile come into the homely face like to take -PRON- back to -PRON- -PRON- and tell -PRON- a few thing 
bremerton a mind to camp down on -PRON- for a while 
-PRON- need -PRON- 
but be no deadhead work 
but -PRON- donot understand i understand more than -PRON- think 
before long there will be more broken head in these diggin than there ever be at a donnybrook fair 
for one of -PRON- disposition the outlook be distinctly allurin go to work here 
where be -PRON- go to work laugh bremerton 
in the mill 
about tomorrow -PRON- will be need a new amalgamator and the man for the job 
then that s settle and i could ask nothing well 
there go the gong at the chuckshanty mike 
come on to breakfast 
bremerton plan a surprise for big steve and chombo 
the law be to be invoke against -PRON- and the case relentlessly press 
such a move would constitute an object lesson for all the enemy of deane 
king be send to phoenix directly after breakfast tocommunicate plan to the sheriff 
as a cover to the real nature of -PRON- errand -PRON- be give out in camp that -PRON- have go to town for a couple of carboy of sulphuric acid 
in look over the odd and end of equipment in the office the superintendent have find an old darklantern 
-PRON- have the lantern clean and fill by wun sing and make ready against the night operation 
at ten oclock in the evening bremerton and ohara quietly slip out of camp and make -PRON- way along the trail to the top of the ridge 
three man be wait for -PRON- on the the sheriff and two deputy mighty glad say ransom after a few minute talk that something be go to be do out here 
thug and pluguglie have be do about as -PRON- please at the mariquita and the law have have blame little to work on 
sneak coyote have cover theft track well and even when griggsby go i couldnot lie hold of the first thing in the shape of a clue 
the coroner verdict that -PRON- meet -PRON- death at the hand of some person or person unknown still stand a blot on the good name of this county and this mining district but now with -PRON- help in hope to accomplish something be a cleanup ransom declare bremerton shortly and -PRON- can gamble on that 
where do -PRON- leave -PRON- horse get a buckboard back a way on the trail 
-PRON- understand the scheme 
captain bryden and the halfbreed be only part of -PRON- in addition to that -PRON- have get to recover the steal amalgam 
i get -PRON- 
maybe -PRON- idea will work and maybe -PRON- wonot but well try -PRON- out 
all five of -PRON- push into the chaparral at the trailside 
the night wind rustle the and as -PRON- rise and fall the muttering of the mill rise and fall with -PRON- 
the clearcut star gleam in the sky like scatter diamond and only beneath -PRON- the trail be a lone whitish blur and the ridgetop a shadowy stretch of brushclump and mass boulder 
an hour drag and that whisper ransom in ear a horse and come from the wrong direction make a move 
the galloping come close and a horse and rider pause within a dozen foot of those in the chaparral 
rise in the stirrup the rider look over into the valley for a moment peer and listen then with a sharp turn to the right be off and out of sight along the ridge 
a woman by thunder murmur the amazed sheriff 
-PRON- swear under -PRON- breath 
be there a woman mix up in this bremerton -PRON- demand 
how do i know who s mix up in -PRON- return the superintendent fretfully 
there be other besides big steve and chombo i suppose and maybe tonight will give -PRON- a line on -PRON- 
with one hand -PRON- touch ohara 
the latter be sit comfortably -PRON- long knee hunch to -PRON- chin and -PRON- hand clasp around -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh softly but say not a word 
the tide of sentiment have set in toward mariquita mallory 
this weakness of the girl for nightriding and at time when the night be bedevil with treachery have in timely fashion be bring home to ohara 
bremerton expect surprise and consternation 
-PRON- expectation have be meet with a laugh that express unreasoning unshaken faith 
another hour drag and then through the deep rolling diapason of the mill a slide foot whisper in the sand 
a dark figure be climb out of the valley a sack over the shoulder 
get ready say bremerton to the sheriff 
a tense moment follow 
ransom take something from -PRON- pocket and rise crouch to -PRON- foot 
bremerton bring the lantern around in front of -PRON- and make ready to open the shutter 
the figure win to the top of the trail and turn toward the length of the ridge 
in that moment the shutter click and an eye of light stream from the bush 
big steve whirl with a gasp in -PRON- throat 
the bag drop and -PRON- stand blink in the glare 
then a hand sweep under -PRON- coat toward -PRON- hip 
none of that 
the bush crash and ransom land heavily in the trail get -PRON- number bryden and here where -PRON- lose 
bring that hand back in front of -PRON- 
the hand come back but with steel glitter in the lanternlight 
the amalgamator at bay would have make a fight of -PRON- even against such odd long body shoot clear of the chaparral as though propel by spring and with the swiftness of lightning -PRON- catch the steel and tear -PRON- away 
that pull -PRON- fang for -PRON- remark ohara step back 
-PRON- have no sense at all or -PRON- would know when -PRON- s trap this puff big steve stoppin -PRON- 
the sheriff reply that official briskly 
andy 
both deputy be out of the bush by then and andy hurry to the prisoner with a pair of handcuff 
big steve show -PRON- mettle and -PRON- desperation and begin a wild fight against the inevitable 
leave -PRON- to -PRON- say the fluteplayer and catch the thick hairy wrist 
with a strength no one but bremerton know -PRON- possess ohara slowly but surely bring the hand of the prisoner together in front of -PRON- be in a rush with those comealong andy caution bremerton want -PRON- coat do -PRON- mind another one to be deal with 
the word cause big steve to remember chombo and -PRON- lift a roar of warning 
the other deputy come up behind and slap a hand over the prisoner mouth 
off with the coat say bremerton bring the light closer 
i donot think the yell cause any harm 
with the sheriff help the coat be strip from the amalgamator shoulder and the handcuff snap in place 
bremerton put on the coat over -PRON- flannel shirt and pick up a black slouch hat that lie in the trail 
take -PRON- off to the wagon -PRON- go on the deputy 
a twisted handkerchief be tie between big jaw as a precaution against any further use of -PRON- voice and the two man half drag and half carry -PRON- along the road 
ransom borrow the lantern and turn -PRON- light into the open mouth of the sack 
catch -PRON- with the good all right 
there be a throb of satisfaction in -PRON- husky voice 
bremerton -PRON- have a dead open and shut so far as that fellow be concern get the other in the same way be response only one more lee put in ohara quietly

-PRON- pick up the bag and throw -PRON- over -PRON- shoulder 
shut off the lantern -PRON- add and follow well in the rear 
wait a bit 
ohara step closer to -PRON- friend 
this be the part of -PRON- scheme bremerton that have little appeal to -PRON- 
the breed may think -PRON- be bryden for a few moment but how will this play get -PRON- the location of the amalgam 
if -PRON- think -PRON- can act the part of steve and get chombo to talk then -PRON- be far wide of -PRON- trail 
again suppose chombo hear that yell of big if -PRON- do hell be wait and ready for -PRON- 
chombo will be in the dark of the arroyo explain bremerton 
-PRON- canot hide out and wait for -PRON- as -PRON- do for steve and the three of -PRON- canot approach the mouth of the arroyo without arouse the breed suspicion a flat to cross and practically no cover 
this be the only move -PRON- can make that will lay chombo by the heel and i may get a tip regard the amalgam 
and -PRON- may get something more than -PRON- expect muttered ohara 
not from chombo 
-PRON- have only one good hand 
well go ahead cut in the sheriff impatiently 
whatever happen bremerton well be at -PRON- back 
the superintendent start along the ridge 
indistinct as -PRON- be in the starlight chombo may easily mistake -PRON- for steve bryden 
follow the route the amalgamator have take the previous night bremerton descend the slope cross the little plateau and pause only to give the whistle signal 
the signal be answer and -PRON- advance swiftly to the arroyos mouth 
a figure disentangle -PRON- from the gloom as the superintendent drop the bag and seat -PRON- on a boulder a stealthy figure that crouch forward only to halt warily and at a safe distance 
steve question a voice 
yes answer bremerton 
the word be lose in a report and fire flash in the mouth of the arroyo 
bremerton gasp sway and slowly sink downward at the side of the boulder 
a wild laugh burst from chombo 
-PRON- form straighten and -PRON- plunge forward 
ransom and ohara could be hear stumble across the flat coming uncertainly but at speed each with -PRON- own foreboding about bremerton 
chombo bent and grab for the bag of amalgam 
in the same instant arm go around -PRON- 
think -PRON- have -PRON- eh growl bremerton

chombo know something be wrong -PRON- answer and some one be handily by to pick -PRON- off 
but the shot go wide 
och -PRON- schemer chuckle ohara mightily relieve

-PRON- may help -PRON- though if -PRON- make a clean breast of this 
there be a brief silence during which chombo seem to be think

-PRON- hurt -PRON- arm 
ransom grope through clothe for weapon confiscate a knife and finally get to -PRON- foot 
the lantern ohara say -PRON- 
the yellow gleam fix -PRON- upon the form of chombo and undef the threaten muzzle of the sheriff gun -PRON- struggle to -PRON- foot

with ohara on one side of -PRON- and ransom on the other chombo lead the searcher into the arroyo 
for several minute -PRON- stumble through the darkness then climb a steep slope traverse the length of a hogback plunge downward into blackness again and come finally into a small canon 
the wall be not high and from somewhere ahead could be hear a drip drip of water fall into a pool 
a turn in the gulch bring -PRON- out on a flat cover with a sparse growth of oak 
-PRON- be now close to the dripping water and a small house could be see under the shadow of the tree 
oak flat remark ransom i know the place

then tell -PRON- a liar 
bremerton drop to -PRON- knee and while the beam of light play over the base of the adobe wall -PRON- remove a square section of board 
a cavity be reveal

ohara shift the gleam of the lantern and the slender erect figure of mariquita mallory be etch clearly against the somber background of the oak 
-PRON- come steadily bravely on -PRON- widebrimmed hat push back and the rebellious tress twist about -PRON- forehead and throat 
-PRON- face be set in resolute line 
a quirt swing from -PRON- slender wrist and -PRON- horse could be see dimly in the distance

and the sentence impose be strangely inadequate sinister influence have be at work in behalf of big steve and chombo 
a lawyer of prominence have manage -PRON- case but -PRON- have hasten rather than check the law course 
as soon as -PRON- client be finally behind the bar -PRON- be know that -PRON- have begin disburse small sum as pension to the immediate family of the two man 
bremerton have hope that one or both of the thief would make a confession involve more of enemy 
in this -PRON- be disappoint 
-PRON- hold -PRON- peace and take -PRON- medicine and bremerton feel sure that somebody have make -PRON- worth -PRON- while 
indirectly -PRON- seem certain that the convict man be part of the strong and desperate organization that be fight deane 
with this murderous and persistent gang bremerton could not but connect the mallory 
absolute proof however be lack 
while bremerton gophere and hunt for clue of the lose vein and pester -PRON- mind with doubt and theory in other direction ohara cheerfully tinker with the millplate and in offhour play -PRON- flute 
apparently the irishman have not a care in the world 
now and then -PRON- would drop in on the night amalgamator in the small hour of the morning exchange small talk with -PRON- and covertly watch for dishonest work 
but if the amalgamator on the night shift have be crook the fate of big steve have induce -PRON- to reform 
this which come nearer be a care for ohara than anything else settle -PRON- comfortably and leave nothing on -PRON- mind 
in second month at the mine at the close of a monday afternoon a mexican boy ride up to the office and ask for the superintendent 
bremerton be just come in from a day fruitless quest for the lose vein and the boy hand -PRON- a note offer no explanation one way or the other and immediately gallop away 
bremerton read the note and smile queerly 
after supper that evening while ohara be get out -PRON- flute the superintendent halt the music for a talk 
what be -PRON- do to carry out -PRON- part of the agreement mike 
bremerton inquire suddenly 
the other look up blankly a rolling stone i be and utterly irresponsible say -PRON- a contract to such a man 
but -PRON- have -PRON- curious lee 
what agreement be in -PRON- mind the one -PRON- make with mariquita mallory 
-PRON- be to show -PRON- how wrong i be in -PRON- estimate of -PRON- and -PRON- father 
week have go and -PRON- have not make a move ohara trill a few note then lay the flute on -PRON- knee 
sure -PRON- be an easy job and i see -PRON- from the start makin no wrong estimate 
what -PRON- say bremerton be one thing and what -PRON- believe in that case be another entirely not give -PRON- credit for be honest give -PRON- credit for try hard to be loyal to deane 
-PRON- may as well thrash this out mike 
-PRON- attitude toward mariquita mallory be so different from -PRON- that -PRON- bother -PRON- 
tis not different at all and the flute go to -PRON- lip while -PRON- run the scale no use argue with an irishman 
then why be -PRON- bother quizzing wrinkle show around the twinkling cross eye 
bremerton frown and reach for a pigeonhole of -PRON- desk 
remove a fold paper -PRON- hand -PRON- to ohara and ask -PRON- to read -PRON- say ohara give something handsome if such an invite could come to -PRON- 
do lacey accept the note from mariquita mallory explain bremerton sharply that lure lacey into a trap 
on the way to make -PRON- call -PRON- be shoot from cover 
only yesterday -PRON- leave the phoenix hospital almost a wreck of a man to go east and get back -PRON- strength 
now wasnot that the divil own luck -PRON- couldnot be shoot cornin back could -PRON- not at all 
-PRON- have to get -PRON- go and that rob -PRON- of a few blessed moment with the only woman ever see who s distinctly worth a man time 
for -PRON- now count -PRON- a pleasure to run the gantlet of a dozen ambush just for a smile from the girl 
at that moment bremerton be near to be out of patience with -PRON- friend than at any time since -PRON- have know -PRON- 
jump to -PRON- foot -PRON- stride up and down the office 
calmly the irishman blow into the flute and out of -PRON- come softly the air of mollie -PRON- be always a favorite in -PRON- more serious moment 
bremerton sit down again and wait until -PRON- have finish 
ohara take -PRON- time and a smile come to -PRON- lip as -PRON- again favor -PRON- friend with -PRON- attention 
-PRON- fur be stand lee -PRON- remark and i think -PRON- would calm -PRON- 
-PRON- canot stay mad at -PRON- and -PRON- know -PRON- 
let matter drift 
before long -PRON- will be come around in this mallory business something else for -PRON- to read say bremerton hand -PRON- another note 
ohara take the paper and read mr bremerton -PRON- must listen to -PRON- now 
-PRON- be in danger and i can help -PRON- 
come to -PRON- house in the morning at eight 
-PRON- will not be sorry if -PRON- do for this time trust mariquita mallory 
och the luck -PRON- have when -PRON- donot deserve -PRON- comment ohara -PRON- faded eye glow 
the poor taste -PRON- have send for -PRON- when -PRON- may have send for -PRON- 
-PRON- sigh heavily 
but a redheade freak who canot look at a girl with both eye at once mustnot expect too much in this world 
bremerton i congratulate -PRON- 
the superintendent lean forward and stay the hand that be reach for the flute 
cut that out for now say -PRON- sharply 
do -PRON- understand this perfectly go and the girl will be get -PRON- out of one danger only to draw -PRON- into another 
for the peace of -PRON- soul rather face a battery of mask gun than come company front with those big black eye the danger for -PRON- and know -PRON- all along talk like an idiot growl bremerton impatiently 
this be a lure just as the note to lacey be a lure -PRON- see -PRON- -PRON- say that murmur ohara and call -PRON- an idiot 
-PRON- poor man -PRON- add -PRON- be not -PRON- one thing i can see 
of course go of course -PRON- be 
if for nothing more than to convince -PRON- that -PRON- be waste a lot of sentiment on a scheming treacherous woman continue bremerton hotly 
-PRON- canot take that back say ohara dryly but not say -PRON- again 
with -PRON- -PRON- will go no further put the girl to the test -PRON- that will be put to the test not mariquita mallory 
if an attack be make on -PRON- while ride to oak flat -PRON- will be convince that the girl be not what -PRON- would have -PRON- think 
nothing of the kind be convince that enemy have watch -PRON- chance to catch -PRON- away from home 
even two coincidence wouldnot spell the truth 
be reasonable implore bremerton let -PRON- heart run away with -PRON- head 
and donot -PRON- lee bremerton let the cursed plot of deane run away with -PRON- sense of right and justice 
make -PRON- call 
if -PRON- be shoot out of -PRON- saddle and bring back here with the breath go out of -PRON- body -PRON- will not be the girl go hunting 
mark that 
whom would -PRON- hunt query the superintendent curiously 
why the fiend who would cause that girl to bear the brunt of -PRON- own black deed 
lee -PRON- begin -PRON- work here with a mistaken idea 
-PRON- can make have see -PRON- do -PRON- before 
-PRON- go out of -PRON- way to think wrong of a woman 
-PRON- come hard for -PRON- to think -PRON- and deep down in -PRON- heart -PRON- be not convince but money have work -PRON- spell and -PRON- have get to do something to earn -PRON- 
deane 
deane the man who have build -PRON- up by knife -PRON- friend 
-PRON- have pile high -PRON- dollar by blast the hope of other by backstabbe by scheme that wonot bear the light by no more of that mike talk fair to -PRON- face and hit -PRON- with a club from behind 
a robber so black that big steve and chombo be white as the saint by comparison 
and -PRON- have hook youbecause i be slow in get around with thatthousand 
can i ever forgive -PRON- for that 
the washedout blue eye snap the red hair seem to stand on head and the blood rush into the thin cheek 
the irishman half rise and shake a clenched fist at the ceiling 
-PRON- save -PRON- life once say bremerton -PRON- bronze face almost white and -PRON- wouldnot play anything but square with -PRON- 
square sneer ohara 
-PRON- have forget how to be square 
when -PRON- take the wrong turn of the trail -PRON- go moneymad 
play square with -PRON- 
lee -PRON- be a tool 
on6 of these day -PRON- will find -PRON- out and then blackguard that -PRON- be i tremble for silas deane 
without speak a word bremerton turn on -PRON- heel and strode from the office 
the note of the flute follow -PRON- through the door 
ohara be right attitude toward mariquita mallory be one of distrust not of absolute conviction 
at the first -PRON- be sure that the note to lacey be a part of the tragic plot against -PRON- 
now -PRON- be uncertain 
this second note revive -PRON- suspicion of the girl motive 
-PRON- offer a chance to test -PRON- character and as such -PRON- welcome -PRON- 
if -PRON- be set upon while proceed to the mallory then -PRON- would know the girl for what -PRON- be 
in -PRON- own mind there would be no coincidence about -PRON- 
for -PRON- perhaps there be grave risk in the undertaking 
-PRON- think little of that 
on an open trail in broad day -PRON- could use -PRON- eye and -PRON- wit and lurk foe would not easily get the well of -PRON- 
the mill be sound the sixoclock whistle as -PRON- ride out of camp 
the stamp clatter to a standstill and from rise ground bremerton look back and see the night shift emerge from mine and mill and the day shift straggle from bunkhouse and mexican quarter 
boom 
boom come muffled explosion out of the distance 
-PRON- be the blast fire by the miner so that level and shaft may be clear of fume before the other gang go underground 
from six to seven at the beginning and the end of each day the work close down for breakfast and supper and the changing of shift 
bremerton spur over the top of the trail 
for a quarter of a mile -PRON- would follow the main road to town then turn into a branch that lead to the canon and oak flat 
the rough country contiguous to the valley have be pile with monument file on and now belong to deane as part of the mariquita property 
bremerton have comb those adjacent upland in -PRON- search for the lose vein and have find no blowout or other promising indication 
-PRON- believe the outlying claim comprise merely a barrier against those who would poach on the mariquita preserve 
-PRON- be think less of that morning errand than of the mysterious bonanza ledge when -PRON- reach the point where -PRON- be to leave the main trail 
an swale cross the road and -PRON- course lie through the swale and toward the west 
a road runner dart out of the bush on the right 
the horse give a startled snort and rear backward 
at the same moment a sharp report rang out on the left and bremerton feel the wind of a bullet against -PRON- face 
on so small a thing may a man life hang 
the roadrunner have startle the horse and the horse have rear and at just that moment the shot have be launch from the brush 
have head be incline a foot forward deane would have be look for another superintendent 
this flash through brain 
but -PRON- have not much time for thought 
the lurch of -PRON- mount have loosen the cinch and the saddle turn 
-PRON- make a wild effort to keep on the horse back 
find this to -PRON- impossible as the shot have still further alarmed tfie horse and set -PRON- to plunge -PRON- try to kick free of the stirrup and strike the ground on -PRON- foot 
one foot be free but the other become entangled 
-PRON- fall heavily in the trail on -PRON- shoulder kick desperately to get clear of the cling stirrup 
the horse frenzy by the unusual turn of event continue to rear and fle -PRON- heel 
the outlook be dark indeed for bremerton then for -PRON- be in imminent danger of be trample to death 
a hoarse shout come from the chap arral 
a crushing of brush be hear at hajf a dozen widely separate point 
this of course be all lose upon bremerton for the more immi nent danger claim -PRON- attention 
suddenly the horse whirl to the right and run into the swale drag -PRON- rider over the rough ground and through the greasewood 
bremerton be bump against stone lash with brushbranche and threaten at every leap with the pound ironshod heel 
-PRON- feel -PRON- sense go and surround object slide past -PRON- in a confused blur 
dimly -PRON- be aware of beating hoof close at handnot those of -PRON- own runaway horse but other 
one thought rise paramount in -PRON- befog mind 
-PRON- have -PRON- 
at last those mysterious force -PRON- have defy be close in on theirquarry the horse stop 
some one dismount 
the next moment -PRON- release foot fall and -PRON- body lie prone upon the ground 
there follow a preliminary trampling of the earth end in a tattoo of hoof that fade into silence along the swale 
mr bremerton 
-PRON- realize that -PRON- horse be gope that another horse stand quietly a few yard from where -PRON- lie and that on -PRON- knee beside -PRON- be mariquita mallory 
-PRON- sit up bewilder 
bring on the rest of the gang -PRON- say presently 
-PRON- feel for -PRON- automatic revolver but -PRON- have be lose out of -PRON- pocket 
there be nothing leave with which to defend -PRON- and -PRON- must take whatever be to come 
can -PRON- get up 
the girl put out -PRON- hand 
with -PRON- assistance -PRON- gain -PRON- foot 
where be the rest of -PRON- -PRON- demand glare in the direction of the trail 
-PRON- be behind -PRON- answer and crowd -PRON- close 
come -PRON- must hurry 
crowd ns close -PRON- return 
-PRON- may not believe -PRON- -PRON- say with a trace of bitterness but -PRON- would not spare -PRON- any more than -PRON- would -PRON- have to trust -PRON- now mr bremerton and -PRON- must pull -PRON- together and do -PRON- good 
-PRON- straighten and peer anxiously up and down the swale then -PRON- bend -PRON- head to listen 
what -PRON- see or hear be beyond bremerton but a look of wild alarm cross -PRON- pallid face 
quick -PRON- whisper and seize -PRON- arm convulsively 
-PRON- yield -PRON- passively into -PRON- hand 
whether -PRON- be a friend or foe make little difference just then 
-PRON- know -PRON- danger could not be more acute either way 
leave -PRON- horse mariquita pull -PRON- toward the bank of the swale 
there -PRON- drop to -PRON- knee and begin climb through the thick brush 
the quirt trail from -PRON- wrist by a leather loop get in -PRON- way 
-PRON- jerk -PRON- from -PRON- arm and fling -PRON- aside 
-PRON- follow -PRON- on all four up and up through the mask of the chaparral 
-PRON- brain be clear andhe wonder why -PRON- have abandon -PRON- horsewhy -PRON- have not both mount the animal and gallop away 
if -PRON- be really try to befriend -PRON- that would have seem like the safe course 
-PRON- could not hear a sound in the depth of the scrub behind -PRON- 
what have become of the man who have fire at -PRON- at the fork of the trail perhaps the murderous scoundrel have be frighten away by the failure of -PRON- plan perhaps the girl be be carry away by -PRON- fearsshe be a woman and -PRON- have not much faith in a woman resourcefulness at such a time 
in spite of -PRON- doubt however -PRON- make no protest 
on hand and knee -PRON- crawl after the girl to the top of the bank 
-PRON- would have speak then but -PRON- look at -PRON- wildly and place a finger on -PRON- lip 
-PRON- start to rise but -PRON- pull -PRON- down 
crack 
from somewhere in the swale come the bark of a firearm 
a bullet snap through the bush 
the golden echo have hardly die into silence before -PRON- be take up by another report 
this come from farther up the swale but the snarl lead strike at the same point that have draw the first shot 
then again and again from widely vary location below bullet be hurl at that one spot on the top of the bank 
the girl face be white and yet -PRON- seem to have -PRON- well in hand nothing else for -PRON- -PRON- whisper through tense lip more to -PRON- than to bremerton -PRON- must take to the blind -PRON- only chance 
-PRON- turn and once more begin worm -PRON- way onward 
at a distance of fifty foot the ground break abruptly into a sheer descent ahead of -PRON- 
-PRON- look into a narrow steepwalle gully 
bremerton have see that gully before 
on the opposite side outlying holding embrace the upanddown wall and the last monument of the mariquita property be heap at the wall base get to get down there mr bremerton declare the girl 
i can do -PRON- -PRON- answer but -PRON- i can go wherever -PRON- can let that worry -PRON- have -PRON- bottle up once be in the gully 
i know the place and -PRON- a veritable cul de sac 
-PRON- can get into -PRON- here but -PRON- canot get out once be down there -PRON- can take -PRON- time pick -PRON- off 
no and -PRON- speak with an effort i know something about this that -PRON- donot 
-PRON- begin let -PRON- over the rim 
wait -PRON- interpose go first and help -PRON- 
after be drag by -PRON- horse as -PRON- be -PRON- may have all -PRON- can do to help -PRON- all over that -PRON- answer and lower -PRON- to a protrude stone in the cliff face 
come after -PRON- closely -PRON- add use to this rockclimbing 
foot by foot -PRON- descend a project rock here or a weatherworn seam in the wall there afford -PRON- treacherous round in the cliff ladder 
the girl be clearheade and steady and at this bremerton marvel 
surely -PRON- have know very little about -PRON- up to that moment 
time after time -PRON- reach upward to place the small foot in a place of comparative safety and occasionally -PRON- lift -PRON- voice in warning where the handhold be weak or the foothold crumble 
when -PRON- near the foot of the wall lead once more begin to fly 
the marksman keep -PRON- in hiding dropshoote from an angle that make -PRON- work more unnerving than dangerous 
bullet strike against granite and glanced singing into space 
a few ranged upward and inward and one spend ball pass through sleeve 
now where ask bremerton as -PRON- and the girl stand side by side at the foot of the wall 
-PRON- voice be even almost colorless strain glance rest on -PRON- face curiously 
-PRON- be a good deal of a man mr some thing say -PRON- 
this be no time for foolish talk -PRON- answer sharply 
nor for foolish action perhaps such as the one i be about to do 
this way and be quick 
-PRON- run across the boulderstrewn bed of the gully and gain a screen of chaparral on the other side 
-PRON- follow 
the fire strangely enough have slacken and the dash be entirely successful 
come in here call the girl from a granite overhang 
-PRON- step under the rock 
in the half gloom a hand reach -PRON- and lead -PRON- on and on into blank darkness 
as -PRON- stumble forward -PRON- reach out with -PRON- free hand and run -PRON- gropingly over a ragged wall 
wonder grip -PRON- 
-PRON- be in a tunnel 
hard on the heel of wonder come a flash of hope and exultation 
a woman sacrifice 
who run this tunnel into the gully wall miss mallory 
bremerton in -PRON- excitement over this new discovery forget the danger that have drive -PRON- into that subterranean refuge 
-PRON- voice ring joyfully between the narrow wall and the girl must have realize the trend of -PRON- thought 
-PRON- father and -PRON- answer quietly dig and blast -PRON- way into the heart of the hill ground 
this be the lose vein the bonanza ledge be hunt for 
i have an idea all the time that -PRON- and -PRON- father know where -PRON- wasthat -PRON- must know where -PRON- be 
what do -PRON- do with the waste -PRON- take out of the bore 
no one could look into the gully and even suspect that mining operation have be go on 
why do -PRON- mask the work 
why have -PRON- make a secret of -PRON- 
-PRON- have drop -PRON- hand 
almost fiercely -PRON- voice leap at -PRON- i have to bring -PRON- here in order to save -PRON- life 
be -PRON- go to take advantage of the sacrifice and wreck the mallory completely carruther know nothing about this vein 
i find -PRON- 
-PRON- only weapon against deane all -PRON- could use in defend -PRON- right have be this secret of the hill 
be -PRON- go to turn that weapon against ns 
under the torrent of those hot word something like shame rise in -PRON- breast 
-PRON- have save -PRON- life at the expense of a golden secret carefully guard 
be -PRON- more indebted to -PRON- who have rescue -PRON- than to deane -PRON- employer 
mariquita interpret -PRON- silence as favor -PRON- interest and -PRON- father 
-PRON- voice lose some of -PRON- sharpness as -PRON- go on 
-PRON- be safe here 
the wretch in the gully will not show themselvesthey never do 
-PRON- plot and kill from cover 
once see -PRON- could be run to earth identify and make to suffer from what -PRON- have do and be do 
eager as -PRON- be to destroy -PRON- mr bremerton -PRON- be more eager to keep -PRON- out of any entanglement with the law 
-PRON- know how hard the law would deal with -PRON- on account 
just a moment 
there be candle and match here and i want -PRON- to see everything and to know everything 
i think -PRON- will listen to -PRON- now 
-PRON- could hear -PRON- move around near the opposite wall 
presently -PRON- come back to -PRON- 
a light may be see from the overhang say -PRON- so -PRON- will not make one until -PRON- round the angle of the wall a little way ahead 
come 
-PRON- take -PRON- hand as before and lead -PRON- forward and around a sharp turn 
half a dozen step farther and -PRON- halt again 
first mariquita observe let -PRON- tell -PRON- how i happen to be in the swale 
i donot have to tell -PRON- what happen to latey in answer a similar note of mine 
-PRON- think evil of -PRON- in that matter 
-PRON- be in -PRON- mind this morning know -PRON- be threaten and that a blow may fall while -PRON- be on the way to the canon 
but i have to ask -PRON- to come to -PRON- for -PRON- have make -PRON- impossible for -PRON- to come to the mine 
i be anxious to learn whether -PRON- have faith enough in -PRON- whether -PRON- friend could persuade youto answer that note in person 
i didnot need persuasion -PRON- break in grimly for i should have come anyway 
i want to test youto find out whether a move would be make against -PRON- as -PRON- have be make against lacey in the same situation 
so when that shot be fire at the fork in the trail -PRON- consider the case against -PRON- prove 
i have no time to consider anything 
the saddle turn and i drop in the road 
but never mind that miss mallory 
go on 
i have be watch the gang as well as i could and i know -PRON- be watch -PRON- and only wait for a chance to catch -PRON- off -PRON- guard 
since -PRON- send big steve and chombo to prison -PRON- skulking foe have be hot for reprisal 
-PRON- realize that i be try to help -PRON- and -PRON- would have blacken -PRON- motive in -PRON- eye if -PRON- could 
chombo try -PRON- that night -PRON- find the amalgam 
the stuff be hide in that place so that if discover -PRON- could not but think ill of the mallory 
-PRON- voice catch in -PRON- throat and -PRON- quick breathing there in the underground quiet smote on -PRON- ear 
i be anxious about -PRON- mr bremerton -PRON- resume steady -PRON- for i realize only too well what -PRON- would think if anything go wrong on -PRON- way to the canon 
i ride to the swale by a roundabout bourse and be wait for -PRON- to bear 
i see what happen 
as -PRON- horse charge past -PRON- drag -PRON- by a stirrup i turn -PRON- own horse and follow 
the thing i do not expect but fear in -PRON- heart have come to pass 
if -PRON- have be kill -PRON- friend ohara would have blame -PRON- but if i could do something to save -PRON- then -PRON- and ohara would be compel to believe in -PRON- 
that be why i stop -PRON- horse and that be why i make the sacrifice in bring -PRON- here 
-PRON- wrong ohara 
nothing could make -PRON- suspect -PRON- of treachery 
-PRON- hasnot the same responsibility at the mine that i have bremerton add dryly 
-PRON- wasnot -PRON- life particularly but -PRON- own good name that concern -PRON- think that 
deane have rob -PRON- and all -PRON- hope be to effect some settlement withhim on the score of -PRON- lose vein 
but -PRON- have no heart no conscience 
the more -PRON- be harrassed and the hard the work at the mine be make for -PRON- the nearer -PRON- may be force to a compromise with -PRON- 
but the slay the shooting the robbingoh in the name of justice do not connect -PRON- father and -PRON- with that 
who have do -PRON- all other 
i donot know who -PRON- be and i donot know the motive back of -PRON- for -PRON- work in the dark 
if -PRON- could discover who be pay the relative of big steve and chombo a pension -PRON- would get a clue that may help unravel the mystery not go into that now 
-PRON- father and i be not to be identify with those wretch 
-PRON- be to make sure of that once and for all 
-PRON- father know -PRON- be come to phoenix 
-PRON- go to town as soon as -PRON- hear and -PRON- follow -PRON- about and take the first opportunity to warn -PRON- 
no work be go on at the mariquita mine and i think i can not be positivethat there be some from there concern in that attack on -PRON- by the town canal 
remember the ball of amalgam and how -PRON- have ultimately lead to the unmasking of big steve bremerton make no doubt that the girl be right 
the conclusion be interesting but lead to no substantial result 
-PRON- father after -PRON- leave -PRON- that night in phoenix the girl pursue hear the rush of man among the cottonwood 
oh the pity that the attack should have happen then of all time so that blame could be lay at -PRON- father door 
-PRON- come at once and tell -PRON- and i ride to the canal to see how matter have fare with -PRON- 
for -PRON- trouble i have only hard word and cruel suspicion 
that be what hurt a womansome woman hurt -PRON- 
i want -PRON- to understand the situation mr bremerton and i smother -PRON- pride and ride to the mine for a talk with -PRON- 
-PRON- would have be well if i have stay away 
under the strain of all this wrong and injustice -PRON- father health be break 
-PRON- have fight for year with misfortune and just at the moment when success be within -PRON- grasp -PRON- be snatch away by deane treacherously deliberately cruelly 
if -PRON- have do what -PRON- should that night in phoenix father would have send the police to the town canal 
but -PRON- be not -PRON- and when -PRON- have bring word to -PRON- -PRON- be too late soon as -PRON- come back home from town i begin try to learn something about these other who be fight deane 
night after night i have hover about the mine 
i see big steve go to thtf arroyo and meet chombo but i could not follow chombo and find what -PRON- do with the amalgam 
the night of the capture i be close to chombo when the shot be fire at -PRON- 
i could not see the man who fire but i hear -PRON- scramble away 
i take after -PRON- but -PRON- evade -PRON- in the pitchy darkness of the arroyo 
when i get back to oak flat i find -PRON- there and ohara and the sheriff 
can -PRON- put -PRON- in -PRON- place and realize how i feel to hear from the sheriff that chombo accuse -PRON- of shoot at -PRON- 
i have just wear -PRON- out try to run down that skulking cowardly scoundrel 
a feeling of sympathy for the girl have grow in breast as -PRON- talk 
-PRON- be glad of the dark and that -PRON- could not see -PRON- face 
have there be anything more to impress -PRON- in -PRON- favor -PRON- sense of duty toward deane would surely have suffer 
no doubt i have be mistake say bremerton slowly 
after -PRON- interview with lacey though the mistake be natural 
i be willing to set aside -PRON- past difference miss mallory and -PRON- can make common cause against these prowling devil who shoot from ambush and rob and work under cover 
do -PRON- want -PRON- that way what will be the end of -PRON- work -PRON- ask doubtfully 
-PRON- will drive -PRON- out -PRON- answer resolutely and bring to punishment those who murder griggsby and send lacey to the hospital 
but apart from that -PRON- persist 
why with the bonanza vein to draw on for ore i will equal the show -PRON- and -PRON- father make at the mariquita 
deane will unload the property for half a million and and -PRON- cut in icily -PRON- will receive five hundred dollar a month for -PRON- work and a bonus of ten thousand dollar 
the half million belong by right to -PRON- father and -PRON- 
-PRON- go to deane and -PRON- getwhat bremerton have no answer for that 
-PRON- knowledge stop short of the mallory and -PRON- socalle right 
deane be -PRON- friend -PRON- employer 
when bremerton give -PRON- word about anything -PRON- as as good as -PRON- bond 
-PRON- have nothing to say murmured mariquita 
now that -PRON- have listen so far mr bremerton -PRON- must hear the rest of -PRON- 
first though -PRON- will be well to go to the overhang and reconnoiter 
i do not imagine that the man in the gully have the slight idea what have become of -PRON- but -PRON- be just as well to be on the safe side 
if -PRON- will wait here for a few minute do the reconnoitering -PRON- cut in and grope -PRON- way back around the turn and to the mouth of the tunnel 
at the lip of the overhang -PRON- could hear the distant growling of the stampmill 
-PRON- be faint however and if there have be any stirring about in the gully -PRON- would have be aware of -PRON- 
-PRON- be impossible for -PRON- either to see or to hear anything of -PRON- mysterious enemy 
when -PRON- return -PRON- find that the girl have light a candle 
the light fall over -PRON- face bring out and accentuate each softly mold line 
-PRON- large eye meet -PRON- wistfully appealingly as -PRON- put the candle in -PRON- hand and point to the breast of the level 
there -PRON- whisper 
look at the veinthe one i foundthe one -PRON- father and i developedthe ledge that make the mariquita mine worth half a million 
examine -PRON- mr bremerton 
-PRON- walk to the breast brush -PRON- hand over the surface of the rock hold the candle close and bend forward 
another moment and -PRON- stagger back astound scarcely breathe 
-PRON- knewnone betterthe full worth of what -PRON- see 
prospecting be -PRON- trade and often -PRON- have hornspoone sample of crush ore and find value that would have turn many a man head 
but never have -PRON- see anything to compare with the indication of that bonanza lead 
a rich say mariquita passively 
rich -PRON- gasp 
well -PRON- the rich thing this side of the comstock lode 
and the vein a foot wide and a true fissure 
such vein increase in value as -PRON- go down on -PRON- 
what will the assay be a hundred foot or a thousand foot below aa word fail -PRON- 
-PRON- voice trail off into wonder silence not much outcrop on top of the hill -PRON- say -PRON- even tone contrast queerly with -PRON- hoarse vehement word 
i pick up just one insignificant piece of float and trail the clue until i have uncover a mere stringer 
but that stringer be so rich that father and i cover up the opening and obliterate every sign of mineral 
every man at the mine be discharge and not one suspect a strike 
i guess -PRON- be wrong in do that 
the theory be correct but -PRON- do not work out well 
i work side by side with father dig that tunnel 
-PRON- be month at -PRON- and -PRON- guard every move -PRON- make 
the waste from the tunnel -PRON- pitch into a hole beside the overhang and cover -PRON- with brush 
when -PRON- begin to take out ore -PRON- haul -PRON- in sack up the side of the gully 
father fire and run the engine at the mill and i stand over the plate dose -PRON- with quick run a day then have a cleanup and spend a week get out more ore hardly believe mr bremerton the way the amalgam ridge -PRON- up on those plate 
the gold tumble out of the sieve and bank up so high in front of the batteryboxe that wehad to scrape -PRON- away every halfhour 
father be like a boy 
twenty year drop from -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- skip back and forth between the engineroom and the battery and every once in a while -PRON- would stop to pat -PRON- on the shoulder and laugh girl be make 
a palace and all the big thing in life for -PRON- way out there in the east 
at last so help -PRON- the 
mallory be come into -PRON- own 
but -PRON- be too quick with -PRON- hurrah 
-PRON- have spend so much time ion the tunnel that -PRON- couldnot -PRON- and mill enough ore to pay for the property 
into the mild depth of -PRON- eye come a swift change 
-PRON- clutch -PRON- hand and wring -PRON- convulsively 
ah the sorry way luck turn for -PRON- -PRON- whisper 
with more than enough gold in sight to pay carruther a thousand time over -PRON- have to go to deane for a paltry twenty thousand dollar 
-PRON- put -PRON- off play fast and loose with -PRON- until finally -PRON- have the mine and -PRON- be bad off than nothing 
-PRON- eye snap fire and -PRON- hand fall at -PRON- side and clench fiercely 
a blackerhearte scoundrel never live than silas deane 
bremerton have be give time to calm -PRON- 
-PRON- study the flame of the candle for a moment then fix the candle on a ledge in dripping of -PRON- own grease 
-PRON- be to tell -PRON- all about that now say -PRON- 
why not sit down and be comfortable not a comfortable subjectfor -PRON- -PRON- answer stand in front of -PRON- as -PRON- drop on a boulder by the hang wall get ahead of -PRON- 6tory too and start at the middle where i should have go back to the beginning 
-PRON- be not always the mariquita mine mr bremerton 
when carruther find -PRON- and consolidate the several claim -PRON- be know as the apache 
carruther build the mill and lay the pipeline and open up the vein -PRON- be now work on 
-PRON- have already discover that the vein be very ordinary and leave no more than a small margin of profit 
-PRON- look pretty good to father and -PRON- though 
an uncle in the east have die and leave -PRON- two thousand dollar 
one christmas day father take over the property at twentyfive thousand dollar 
carruther be to have -PRON- two thousand dollar down and three thousand dollar more the first year 
then on the next christmas be at noon the time expiredif the remain twenty thousand dollar be not pay the mine be to revert at once to carruther a mining man and -PRON- know how such deal go 
-PRON- pay expense and by careful planning get out of the old vein enough more to give carruther -PRON- five thousand and complete the first payment 
then in midsummer i discover the new lead tell -PRON- about that 
father and i be afraid that -PRON- know what -PRON- have find would discover some way to void -PRON- contract 
if -PRON- have be less suspicious and have keep some of the man to help run in the tunnel -PRON- could have take out and mill ten time more than -PRON- need to pay carruther 
but -PRON- be afraid of -PRON- 
for that reason -PRON- do the work -PRON- and keep -PRON- golden secret lock up in -PRON- own heart 
early december come and -PRON- have nothing for carruther 
then in an unlucky moment father think of deane 
mariquita pause fight down -PRON- rise emotion and presently continue 
father have a passing acquaintance with thisthis mining king as -PRON- call -PRON- 
-PRON- believe that -PRON- could go to denver show deane -PRON- bullion certificate and get from -PRON- as much money as -PRON- need in exchange for a tenth interest in the property 
so -PRON- go to denver be more than friendlythat be always -PRON- way tell when -PRON- s plan deviltry 
-PRON- listen to father take -PRON- bullion certificate verify -PRON- in course of a week and then ask how -PRON- could make such a good showing with a tenstamp mill on tendollar rock 
father do not let -PRON- into -PRON- secret but tell -PRON- pointblank that after the get the claim hard and fast and -PRON- be in for a tenth interest -PRON- would be give further light take care of -PRON- mallory say deane 
those be -PRON- very word mr bremerton take care of -PRON- mallory and donot -PRON- lose any sleep 
day after day -PRON- put -PRON- off reassure -PRON- lure -PRON- on with false hope until the 25th of december come 
carruther be in denver at the time 
-PRON- surprise -PRON- once with deane on one of -PRON- many trip to office 
oh -PRON- be blind blind not to have suspect trickery 
but father have faith in deane up till ten oclock that last day 
jthe girl voice quiver in -PRON- throat -PRON- be then that deane throw off -PRON- mask and curtly tell father -PRON- have ho money for -PRON- and that -PRON- would have to look elsewhere for -PRON- 
look elsewhere 
where could -PRON- look 
-PRON- know no one in denver but deane and carruther 
i think father would go crazy 
-PRON- grab deane by the throat and i believe -PRON- would have kill -PRON- if i hadnot interfere 
some clerk come and throw father out of that gild den of crookedness and -PRON- spend hour try to get the money for carruther 
the girl choke and walk up and down the level for a few moment to get control of -PRON- 
meanwhile -PRON- finish carruther have transfer the mariquita mine to deane for fifty thousand dollar 
do -PRON- know what this friend of your do 
-PRON- eye flame and -PRON- lean toward bremerton with -PRON- face set and strained and -PRON- breath come in short labor gasp 
this friend of -PRON- this man who hire -PRON- to come down here and make a showing with the mine that would enable -PRON- to sell -PRON- for half a million this mean falsehearted scoundrel have be browbeat carruther all the while -PRON- have be feed -PRON- father with hope and promise 
-PRON- tell carruther that the mariquita mine be enormously rich and -PRON- declare that if carruther would not give -PRON- an option on -PRON- for fifty thousand dollar -PRON- would give -PRON- father the money to get -PRON- for half that sum 
carruther could take -PRON- choice 
so far as carruther be concern i do not think -PRON- be much well than deane 
-PRON- be the case of two rogue pluck an honest old man 
carruther must have squirm 
for -PRON- -PRON- be either let the -PRON- go to father or to deane a mine worth half a million and for which the good -PRON- could get be a paltry fifty thousand 
there be high word in that fine office but deane have to give in 
father and i come back to phoenix and all -PRON- have in the world be a few tool a few head of horsesand the secret of that rich vein 
so long as that new vein could not be discover the mariquita mine be worth little 
already -PRON- work in the gully have be well hide but -PRON- go by night and make the hiding more secure 
poor griggsby hunt until -PRON- be wear out and lacey too search high and low 
but neither of -PRON- suspect the wall of that of contain mineral 
and -PRON- have no well luck mr bremerton 
there be absolutely no mineral indication in or around the gully 
the original claim there be only an outpost for the mariquita property anyway 
sadness almost despair creep into -PRON- voice as -PRON- proceed father and i go back to -PRON- little ranch in the canon 
-PRON- watch the development over in the valley 
-PRON- want the superintendent deane send out here to fail and -PRON- live in hope that deane would at last be force to come to -PRON- and give -PRON- a half interest in the property for tell -PRON- what -PRON- know 
after a time -PRON- discover that other and secret enemy be fight deane hamper -PRON- operation in every conceivable way and seek to drive -PRON- out of the district 
night after night while griggsby be here the pipeline be cut thieving must have be go on in the mill too for the bullion output be barely enough for expense the mill be set on fire and barely save there be discontent among the man then on top of all this griggsby worry about the lose vein and -PRON- inability to make good 
finally and the girl shiver -PRON- pay the penalty for help deane 
lacey be send down 
-PRON- be energetic and able and -PRON- rule with an iron hand 
but -PRON- be not successful 
-PRON- good man leave for the mariquita mine be get an evil name on account of griggsby 
-PRON- have to hire the riffraff of the district in order to do any work at all and that move bring -PRON- own trouble 
father and while all these other enemy of be at work watch and hope 
would deane give up 
would -PRON- come to -PRON- 
father hear of a plot against lacey 
-PRON- be both sick of the shooting and the bloodshed hard though -PRON- thought be toward that master schemer in denver 
i send lacey a note and ask -PRON- to come to -PRON- ranch and hear some important news 
-PRON- have distrust -PRON- all along 
for all that though -PRON- start to come to -PRON- and and those other seize that as -PRON- chance to strike 
afterward -PRON- appear 
some one in denver a man in officeinforme -PRON- about that 
-PRON- know what -PRON- have do and try to do since -PRON- reach the mine mr bremerton 
this lose lead have be -PRON- only weapon in a hard hopeless oneside fight against a powerful and influential man 
now sob rush to lip as -PRON- say -PRON- -PRON- know -PRON- secret 
ought i to have let -PRON- die rather than bring -PRON- here 
be wemy father and to any consideration at -PRON- hand 
i have tell -PRON- the truth 
be -PRON- for -PRON- or against -PRON- 
there in the dimly light level -PRON- face and manner grow all appealing 
with tear run down -PRON- cheek -PRON- reach out -PRON- hand in mute supplication eye wander to the breast of the level to that footwide streak of bonanza ore which the girl and -PRON- father by the hard kind of labor have lay bare 
the superintendent gaze return to the slender beseeching form and tearstained face in front of -PRON- 
-PRON- get slowly to -PRON- foot 
i shall prove what -PRON- say miss mallory -PRON- answer then in a husky unnatural voice and if -PRON- be true as god hear -PRON- i will see that -PRON- get -PRON- right 
but -PRON- must waityou must be patientyou must have confidence in -PRON- and no no not that 
before -PRON- could draw back -PRON- have fling -PRON- on -PRON- knee at -PRON- foot catch one of -PRON- hand and press -PRON- to -PRON- lip ohara go gun bremerton have not be go an hour from the mine when king wildly excited come run to ohara 
the irishman have just climb to the ore platform on -PRON- way into the mill and the sharp cry of king bring -PRON- to a quick aboutface to pay demand ohara startle by the look and manner of the cyanid expert horse have come back ohara and with an empty saddle 
when be this just now just this minute 
i run from the corral to find -PRON- get -PRON- ohara 
by george -PRON- have get -PRON- 
ohara take the pipe from -PRON- tooth and knock out the ashe against the side of the mill 
-PRON- thick eyebrow lower over the crisscross eye and -PRON- big thinlipped mouth twist but with no attempt at speech 
with one hand -PRON- grope in -PRON- pocket for -PRON- tobaccosack 
with deliberation -PRON- fill the bowl put away the sack and scratch a match 
do -PRON- hear pipe king fail to understand why -PRON- have not create a sensation horse have come back and never -PRON- mind cut in ohara in -PRON- soft tone -PRON- -PRON- business and not yours and be see to -PRON- 
go to the bunkhouse and get winchester 
fetch -PRON- to the corral after makin sure there be load in -PRON- 
why shillyshally 
this be no time for why s 
on the jump now 
ohara thrust -PRON- head through the opening that lead to the oreloft and shout for gile 
the battery man come bound up the step 
gile call away say ohara and until i come back -PRON- will be do the amalgamating along with the rest of -PRON- 
sure a cracked shoe in no battery 
keep -PRON- eye on -PRON- 
i will strike another match trail -PRON- over -PRON- pipebowl and jump from the ore platform 
the pipe be go under force draft as -PRON- hurry in the direction of the corral horse still restive stand with the loop rein throw over a corralpost 
the saddle swing underneath the stirrup rest on the ground 
not so bad maybe muttered ohara 
the saddle turn with -PRON- and -PRON- possible -PRON- s have no more than a spill 
whoa basham -PRON- add step to the horse and beginning to readjust the ridinggear 
by the time king reach the corral ohara have the rein off the post and be mount and wait load the little expert flutter hand the gun to ohara 
good enough not go alone to look for bremerton 
not 
watch -PRON- 
keep a still tongue between -PRON- tooth king and look after the work be back when i get here 
-PRON- dig in with -PRON- heel 
the excited horse snort and rear and then be off like an arrow along the trail 
king watch the long body hump over the saddle horn until horse and rider have vanish over the rise 
the mill begin to pound and the pounding gradually merge into a long continuous roar 
the expert toss -PRON- hand helplessly and apprehensively and turn back toward the office the beginning of the end -PRON- mutter but hang if i stay here while some one else come to take place have enough of this goodness know thought be busy 
-PRON- be clear bremerton have not go far before the saddle turn with himthe riderless horse have be too quick in get back to the mine 
no doubt -PRON- be this side of the canon that bremerton have take -PRON- fall 
as soon as -PRON- be over the side of the hill ohara pull the horse down to a slow pace 
-PRON- eye focus on the trail and keenly watch -PRON- as -PRON- proceed 
the dust be fetlock deep and -PRON- know -PRON- would show sign 
-PRON- find what -PRON- be look for near the place where the trail fork 
the mark be as clear as word in an open book 
first there be a clutter of hoofprint 
run through -PRON- be a broad streak as though a heavy bag have be drag at the end of a rope 
then too the horse prick up -PRON- ear and seem to have fear in that particular place face harden 
begorrv -PRON- murmur -PRON- bad than i think 
lee be throw and drag straight into the swale if the mark donot lie ajid this mount on be the one that snake -PRON- along 
how do -PRON- get loose 
and if -PRON- get loose and be all right why donot i meet -PRON- 
i wonder if go to see something in that swale that i donot want to see 
the horse tremble and do not want to go into the swale 
ohara force the animal and as -PRON- move along the bush give mute evidence of progress through -PRON- 
near the spot where the torn and disordered chaparral cease to show further sign ohara find a horse patiently stand with the rein droop from the bitring 
unless the irishman be greatly mistaken that wait horse belong to mariquita mallory 
at once -PRON- mind be flood with puzzle question 
guess as hard as -PRON- would however -PRON- could make nothing of that odd situation there in the swale 
drop the rein of -PRON- own mount -PRON- slide to the ground and begin beat up the brush 
-PRON- find nothing at all and this be a sort of negative satisfaction 
just as -PRON- have about finish -PRON- search a dull report clash on -PRON- ear a bit of lead whisper and the brim of -PRON- hat twitched 
so that s the way of -PRON- -PRON- exclaim and let go with the winchester from the hip 
-PRON- ear be keen even if -PRON- eyesight could not serve and a heavy slug whistle toward the point from which the shot have be fire at -PRON- 
a cry break from the depth of the brush 
ohara locate the point on the swale bank and hasten toward -PRON- 
when as near as -PRON- could judge -PRON- come to the spot -PRON- see no one 
save for the murmuring of the stampmill the swale be steep in deathly silence 
faith this be a brain twister mutter ohara rear head and shoulder above the bush and peer about -PRON- 
show yourself -PRON- imp of the old nick -PRON- cry 
or come again with a shot so i may be after locatin -PRON- 
-PRON- invitation be not accept 
no form materialize out of the depth of the chaparral and there be no more firing 
now what would -PRON- think of that soliloquize the irishman remove -PRON- hat and survey the hole through the brim 
sure i touch up the omadhoun that give -PRON- the souvenir but where in the name of the saint be -PRON- whisht -PRON- add abruptly listen 
-PRON- hear something 
whatever -PRON- be -PRON- be feeble and the faint murmuring of the mill almost drown -PRON- 
clap the hat on -PRON- head -PRON- proceed on over the swalebank pause and strain -PRON- ear at every other step 
-PRON- course bring -PRON- to the brink of the gully 
-PRON- gaze run along the abrupt break in the earth rest wonderingly on the end of a rope 
the rope be tie to a scraggy ironwood grow near the brink and be hang over the cliff face 
ohara lay aside the gun drop to -PRON- knee and look downward 
then -PRON- give an exclamation 
near the bottom of the swinging rope a yard from the base of the wall lie the motionless form of a man 
but -PRON- be not bremerton no not bremerton 
ohara breathe again 
be -PRON- the blackguard who shoot at -PRON- think the irishman 
do -PRON- bullet drop -PRON- over the edge or be -PRON- go down the rope and do -PRON- fall 
-PRON- be a matter for immediate investigation 
ohara go to the ironwood sit down with -PRON- heel over space twist -PRON- long leg in the rope take the winchester under -PRON- arm and begin to slide 
hamper with the gun -PRON- make awkward work of -PRON- but reach the foot of the wall safely 
the prostrate form lie limply and with arm throw wide from the shoulder prove to be a man whom ohara have never see before 
-PRON- hat lie at a little distance and -PRON- hair be dark and streak with gray 
a stubble of beard cover -PRON- cheek and chin 
-PRON- eye be closed 
-PRON- be plainly unconscious although a groan be now and then wrench from -PRON- tense lip 
no shot of mine touch -PRON- mutter ohara after an examination 
-PRON- fall from the wall and that s the whole of -PRON- 
be -PRON- or be -PRON- not the fellow who cut loose at -PRON- with that bullet 
and how in the fiend name be -PRON- mix up with bremerton and mariquita mallory 
sure stagger with what i know and donot know 
the clothing of the injured man be rather well than that usually wear by miner 
a mexican carvedleather band be around -PRON- hat and at -PRON- waist be a belt with a holster and a heavy navy revolver 
-PRON- hand although brown from exposure give no evidence of hard labor 
here be a mystery and ohara hate mystery 
yet -PRON- be compel to grapple with this one for -PRON- seem to bear directly upon what have happen to bremerton 
-PRON- try to arouse the stranger for a few word from -PRON- would go far toward clear up the situation 
-PRON- effort fail and -PRON- rise to -PRON- foot in perplexity 
while -PRON- stand there cudgel -PRON- brain -PRON- be electrify by a shout from across the gully 
whirl on the instant -PRON- be amazed and overjoyed to see bremerton come toward -PRON- 
and behind bremerton be miss mallory 
-PRON- advance to meet -PRON- hat be go and -PRON- clothe be dusty and tom and in much disorder 
all the indication point to a desperate experience of some sort on -PRON- part 
the sight o -PRON- do -PRON- eye good bremerton cry ohara 
i be not expect to find -PRON- with -PRON- foot under -PRON- but down and out somewhere in the scrub 
-PRON- horse come back to the mine without -PRON- and the saddle in such shape that i know -PRON- have have a spill 
troth man but glad thing be no bad 
miss mallory and -PRON- smile and doff -PRON- hat see -PRON- be a surprise and a pleasure 
i find -PRON- horse in the swale though so i ought not to be surprised 
miss mallory save -PRON- life begin bremerton and och the luck -PRON- have smile the irishman not that -PRON- life be save do -PRON- mind but that miss mallory save -PRON- for -PRON- 
but if there s save to do -PRON- be the kind to be depend upon 
now can -PRON- tell -PRON- who be the man at the foot of the wall ohara turn and point toward the crumple heap of humanity 
the girl stare smother an exclamation of horror then run forward 
when bremerton and ohara come to -PRON- side -PRON- turn a white face to -PRON- 
strange to -PRON- comment bremerton 
be -PRON- to -PRON- 
miss mallory no -PRON- answer in a strained voice 
i have see the man several time mr bremerton 
-PRON- eye wander to the rope follow -PRON- down and rest again on the sprawledout form 
-PRON- be dave carruther -PRON- add 
a carruther 
to ohara that name mean little 
to bremerton and the girl time and place consider -PRON- be deeply significant glance seek face and -PRON- read there areflection of -PRON- own thought 
here be wily and implacable foe 
here be the man who bully into sell the mine for a tithe of -PRON- value have strive to regain by lawless method what -PRON- have lose by legal sharp practise 
-PRON- have fall from the rope while lower -PRON- into the gully 
there seem no doubt of that 
a hard fate have finally unmask -PRON- 
bremerton knelt and make a hasty examination 
-PRON- get up shake -PRON- head ominously 
if i be any judge -PRON- be close to the end of -PRON- trail say -PRON- 
miss mallory and i hear shoot ohara -PRON- go on 
be -PRON- concerned in -PRON- ohara explain 
-PRON- fall from the rope hazard bremerton and those with -PRON- be frighten away 
i think the way be clear for -PRON- now 
-PRON- must get carruther to the mine 
if possible -PRON- must be revive so -PRON- can talk 
miss mallory -PRON- can climb out of here by mean of the rope yes -PRON- answer and start toward the wall 
wait please interpose bremerton 
ohara should go first with the rifle 
that will guard against possible surprise 
if the horse afe still there ohara when i be ready here -PRON- can hitch the upper end of the rope to a saddle 
the irishman nod and climb the rope readily enough 
bremerton tie the gun to the dangling end and -PRON- be draw rapidly upward 
when the rope be throw down again mariquita make the ascent watch anxiously by bremerton 
there be no call for anxiety 
with strength and skill the girl draw -PRON- from crevice to project stone the full length of the wall and be help over the brink by ohara 
bremerton then drag carruther closer to the wall tie the rope snugly under -PRON- arm and call to ohara to hoist away 
the limp twisting body rise gruesomely in the air and mariquita catch -PRON- at the top of the wall and by main strength draw -PRON- over the ledge 
finally the rope be throw back to bremerton and -PRON- win to the crest with little difficulty 
both horse be in the swale 
get into the saddle mike say bremerton lift carruther up to -PRON- and -PRON- can support -PRON- in front of -PRON- for the little distance -PRON- have to go walk 
-PRON- turn to the girl while ohara be mount 
miss mallory -PRON- go on will -PRON- ride to phoenix and send out a doctor and the sheriff 
i want to do anythingeverythe can -PRON- answer 
this be all -PRON- can do now 
remember what i tell -PRON- -PRON- finish earnestly and whatever happen do not doubt -PRON- 
there be a pathetic curve to -PRON- lip as -PRON- look at -PRON- trustingly and smile 
i could not leave the fortune of the mallory in well hand mr bremerton say -PRON- and hurry away to -PRON- horse 
-PRON- be away at speed while bremerton and ohara be attend to carruther 
-PRON- be a slow journey -PRON- have back to the mine but -PRON- reach -PRON- destination and have the injured man in bed long before the noon whistle sound from the mill 
neither bremerton nor ohara have do any talking on the return journey 
king who hurry to the office do enough talk for half a dozen 
carruther 
what in goodness name be the matter with -PRON- 
what have happen to bremerton 
be -PRON- rescue by ohara 
the superintendent wearily parry the expert question 
all in due time king say -PRON- -PRON- will know everything send for a doctor 
just now though -PRON- may help ohara try to bring carruther around get to fix up a little 
bremerton attend to -PRON- bruise and scratch and go through with -PRON- fix up 
when -PRON- have finish carruther be no near consciousness than -PRON- have be before obstinate about get back to earth ohara report 
faith -PRON- a doctor job or the undertaker and well have to wait 
why do -PRON- send for the sheriff lee important for -PRON- to be here in case carruther revive and have anything to say get -PRON- guess 
why the importance 
king have go -PRON- wonder way 
bremerton and ohara sit by the bed watch the injured man closely 
-PRON- be high time ohara understand the drift of affair and bremerton give -PRON- -PRON- full confidence 
the struggle mariquita and -PRON- father have go through with deane treachery to -PRON- and -PRON- covert bullying of carruther be bluntly state 
an angry red rush into the face and hieye gleam as -PRON- listen 
-PRON- get all that from lip that couldnot lie -PRON- exclaim when -PRON- friend finish 
what have -PRON- to say to -PRON- 
i want more proof that deane be the unscrupulous devil the girl have paint -PRON- 
oh but -PRON- can strain at a point 
where be -PRON- to get this proof bremerton nod toward carruther furnish -PRON- 
if -PRON- s ever able to talk -PRON- may nothing certain 
then get the proof from deane 
how in -PRON- own way say bremerton gaze out of the window 
ohara hoist around in -PRON- chair and peer at -PRON- friend through narrow eye 
and if -PRON- get this proof -PRON- query what will -PRON- do throw a thousand dollar of dirty money in -PRON- face snap bremerton 
that much -PRON- have pay -PRON- and -PRON- have make -PRON- possible to give -PRON- back 
then go further by heaven and see that the mallory get what -PRON- be entitle to 
fine exclaimed ohara 
glory be tis the fine thing in life to see a good man get right with -PRON- 
i know -PRON- would come 
-PRON- can throw the money in face if -PRON- will although i doubt the sense of that but -PRON- will never get the mallory -PRON- right 
deane have go to school for -PRON- bunco game and -PRON- donot know -PRON- a abs about the dirty work 
lock horn with -PRON- on that point bremerton and both -PRON- and the mallory will get the bad of -PRON- 
the mill whistle blow 
the clamor of the stamp die to silence and a general movement set in toward the chuckshanty 
bremerton remain with carruther while ohara go for -PRON- meal then ohara relieve bremerton 
when the latter return to the office -PRON- be surprised to find the irishman with the content of pocket on a table in front of -PRON- 
when -PRON- be look for evidence explain ohara personal belonging be common property 
now here this solidframed fortyfivecaliber colt 
three empty shell in the cylinder 
one load just miss -PRON- at the fork of the trail thank to the roadrunner another rake the bush while -PRON- and mariquita be get out of the swale the other maybe put that hole in -PRON- hat guesswork mike return bremerton 
close to the mark though 
if -PRON- ask for a motive isnot there a good one to tack onto carruther 
when rogue fall out the divil get -PRON- due a watch with a nugget fob 
the hand quit tell the time at seven twentyfive when -PRON- drop 
and here a notebook with interesting readin lee 
ohara pick up a small memorandumbook and turn the leave 
listen to this will -PRON- 
to pennyworth on account of bryden and the halfbreed pennyworth bremerton prick up -PRON- ear 
pennyworth be the lawyer who have charge of big and fight in court say -PRON- 
be there anything more not a scrap and this must have get in by mistake 
now -PRON- know who finance the defense for those blackguard and who s pay pension for hushmoney 
i guess this be proof enough even if carruther be never able to speak a word 
bremerton go out into the other room and for a whole hour tramp the floor 
ohara know that -PRON- loyalty for deane be die hard 
at the end of the hour an automobile dash up to the headquarters adobe and the doctor and the sheriff spring out

bremerton be in for some more explaining but -PRON- be tactful and say nothing about the overhang the lose vein or account of -PRON- father dealing with deane 
the superintendent recital hinge upon the shooting at the fork of the trail -PRON- accident the rescue by the girl and the coming of ohara 
the sheriff mutter an exclamation and thump a fist into -PRON- palm 
by gorry be on the track at last -PRON- declare 
carruther and not the mallory have be pick this bone with deane

bremerton get the notebook and show ransom the entry regard money pay to pennyworth on account of big steve and chombo 
that cinch -PRON- aver the sheriff 
-PRON- be back of that crowd and -PRON- wouldnot separate -PRON- from good money without a reason

the doctor hurriedly return to carruther and bremerton and ransom follow 
the eye of the injured man be wide open 
after wander from face to face -PRON- come to a rest on the sheriff too late

get a pencil and paper bremerton say ransom and take this down strength rally under the stimulant 
there be that in -PRON- eye however which tell the other unmistakably -PRON- could not be for long 
-PRON- begin to talk as soon as have lay -PRON- down and -PRON- be all around the few point which the sheriff wish to have make clear 
i feel as though there wasnot a whole bone in -PRON- body moan carruther 
why couldnot i go out without realizin what have happen 
what do -PRON- bring -PRON- back for when i be slippin away so easy now the black horror be grip -PRON- by the throat scared of -PRON- man scared of -PRON- 
i ainot old that s all 
and here crossin the divide with the good of -PRON- life ahead of -PRON- seize -PRON- 
-PRON- face harden like stone and -PRON- dull eye smolder 
clench -PRON- fist -PRON- break into gasp torrent of word whose import sicken those who listen 
ransom lay a muffling hand over -PRON- mouth 
in name carruther say -PRON- remember where -PRON- be 
-PRON- havenot long to stay pass out with curse on -PRON- lip 
let -PRON- final act go toward undo some of the wrong 
-PRON- bend down so that -PRON- could look in the feverish eye 
tell -PRON- about griggsby -PRON- add why -PRON- be here eh snarl carruther 
well -PRON- may have save -PRON- the trouble 
not a word about anything 
i fight for -PRON- own against that blackhearte deane win and lose barter -PRON- soul for one year more of lifejust a year 
-PRON- fall to rave again 
ohara get up and pass into the other room 
return softly with the flute -PRON- sit down by the head of the bed and begin to play 
-PRON- be the intermezzo from cavalleria rusticana 
never have bremerton hear ohara play as -PRON- play then 
the tender melody float about the room and there go with -PRON- a rustling as of unseen wing 
ransom stand like a man entrance 
morton pull down -PRON- sleeve and walk to the window 
bremerton bow over -PRON- pencil and paper weirdly thrill by the pathos and the pleading of those whisper note 
the twisted line straighten in face 
-PRON- fall silent 
presently -PRON- eye close and -PRON- lie still 
ohara make an end of the music and lay the flute on -PRON- knee 
god breathe carruther open -PRON- eye hear that before somewhere 
what piece be that 
only a bit of an air to make -PRON- see thing differently say ohara 
-PRON- do that for -PRON- and by the same token i think -PRON- may for -PRON- 
for a second carruther lie think 
then -PRON- turn -PRON- head so -PRON- could look at the irishman 
play -PRON- again -PRON- beg 
sure and as long as -PRON- please but not till -PRON- have talk with ransom 
i want to know about griggsby carruther speak up the sheriff 
what -PRON- say can do -PRON- no harm 
blame nobody but -PRON- for what happen to griggsby and lacey say carruther 
the rest of the boy have nothing to do with -PRON- 
i go farther with griggsby than i mean to and that s the truth 
i know mallory have strike something rich at the mariquita and i want -PRON- to lose 
i ask deane to help -PRON- beat mallory out and -PRON- say -PRON- would keep -PRON- dangle until the last minute and then turn -PRON- down cold 
so -PRON- do but not uniil -PRON- have get -PRON- with -PRON- back to the wall 
-PRON- be either sell out to mallory for the twentyfive thousand or to deane at double that 
-PRON- have -PRON- and -PRON- know -PRON- but i swear -PRON- would never get any good from the mine until -PRON- deede -PRON- a half interest 
that be what i be fight for ransom 
for that i lay low in the hill fight the work at the mariquita 
i do whatever i could to make deane sick of -PRON- bargain and to force -PRON- to come to -PRON- 
i know have have -PRON- too if -PRON- hadnot be for bremerton girl get bremerton away from -PRON- 
i try to follow -PRON- into the gully and find out where -PRON- go butbut i slip from the rope as some one fire at -PRON- man in the swale voice die in -PRON- throat 
-PRON- look at ohara and -PRON- lip frame a silent word 
ransom nod to ohara then go to bremerton take the hastily scrawl transcript and read -PRON- over while the flute music once more throb through the room 
over and over while the tide ebb ohara breathe the intermezzo into the dead wood and warm -PRON- into life 
the doctor watch carruther finally go to the bedside and bend down to touch -PRON- wrist 
that will be all say the doctor to ohara -PRON- s past hear -PRON- 
the sheriff have crack the shell of a troublesome mystery 
-PRON- professional satisfaction be jar a bit in congruously by a sentiment perfectly human and somewhat awkward the way like to go out -PRON- when i have to -PRON- murmur get a melodeon to home 
give -PRON- the name of that piece ohara so i can have -PRON- daughter learn -PRON- 
ohara with pity in -PRON- pale eye stand look down at carruther 
faith say -PRON- there s good in the bad of -PRON- and bad in the good of -PRON- and there s some hope for the man who go beyond with the love o music in -PRON- soul 
-PRON- lay the hand on the breast and gently draw the blanket over the face but cog in the wheel anyway -PRON- add and the machine keep run even if a cog here and there be not what -PRON- ought to be 
come out in the other room all of -PRON- request the sheriff while i read what bremerton take down fresh in -PRON- mind -PRON- know and i want -PRON- to sign as witness 
-PRON- group about ransom in the office and listen while -PRON- read 
after that each set -PRON- hand to the document a black spot clear up go on ransom 
beat all i never think of carruther in this matter of griggsby 
but that s the way 
the plain truth be so plain sometimes be apt to dodge -PRON- 
-PRON- turn to bremerton 
thank to -PRON- bremerton from this on deane will have clear sailing 
do -PRON- know blame glad of one thing that inquire bremerton 
why that the mallory have no hand in the lawlessness out here 
there be a spell when -PRON- look dark for -PRON- 
no objection to havingthat nod toward the bedroom here until i can get the undertaker out 
certainly not 
then suppose -PRON- hike morton be ready in a minute ransom say the doctor 
-PRON- go to the end of the pipeline and wash -PRON- hand 
when -PRON- have return to thq office and slip into -PRON- coat the sheriff have the machine ready 
bremerton meanwhile have pick up a pad of telegraph blank and write the follow silas deane denver 
have clean up on the other crowd and locate bonanza vein on mariquita property 
important -PRON- come on at once 
notify and will meet -PRON- -PRON- go out of the office and hand the message to the sheriff 
send that for -PRON- will -PRON- ransom -PRON- ask 
let -PRON- go collect 
glad to oblige say the sheriff 
will get -PRON- on the wire as sooma i hit town 
bremerton and ohara watch the car vanish over the rise in the trail jand then the irishman after a long look at -PRON- friend turn on -PRON- heel and move off toward the mill 
the news spread through the camp that carruther the man who have locate the mine and add to -PRON- holding until -PRON- embrace the whole valley and the neighboring hill have go -PRON- way and be lie in the headquarters adobe 
when the day man come off duty and the night man go on all eye seek the little office building awe and curious 
the same eye presently shift to bremerton and pay -PRON- a tribute of respect and high consideration 
carruther represent the evil power that have skulk in the hill fight man savagely and murderously 
with carruther those power have be lay low and all the credit be give to bremerton 
a well spirit manifest -PRON- among the worker 
in the evening bremerton and ohara carry -PRON- chair out of the office and sit by the door 
the irishman flute the air dear to -PRON- heart and the other smoke reflectively 
by and by the flute be lay aside and ohara -PRON- fill a pipe and blow fragrant wreath into the still air wire for deane announce the superintendent 
there be no demonstration from ohara 
lean back against the adobe wall -PRON- puff serenely at -PRON- pipe 
i say i have send for deaneaske -PRON- to come on immediately repeat bremerton 
i know -PRON- would do that or go to denver one or the other say ohara 
what will -PRON- do lee 
what would -PRON- do mike divil know expect though that -PRON- will keep -PRON- head and be sensible 
none of the lee reckless in -PRON- accounting with deane man 
-PRON- be to blame along at the first by get into this so easy forget that 
carruther muse bremerton get only what be come to -PRON- 
-PRON- fight with deane be a case of diamond cut diamond and right or wrong wouldnot have be strain whichever way the card fall 
but between the two of -PRON- the mallory be crush and beat and fling to the scrapheap 
the right most to be consider be not consider at all the point that involve and concern -PRON- 
i take word and help -PRON- rob the mallory of what be justly -PRON- weigh heavily in the word 
the wrath of a man who have all -PRON- life try to be square only to have a friend besmirch -PRON- ideal and sully -PRON- honor swirl in the tone of voice 
after all lee say ohara soothingly tis no crime -PRON- have do 
-PRON- step aside in take sayso when -PRON- should have go under the surface indication 
-PRON- all do that same more or less 
when be in wrong the part of a wise man be to retire gracefully and in order 
which be the same as say with as little trouble as possible 
in -PRON- opinion the mallory be beyond help so far as this mine be concern see about that and face hardened and -PRON- tooth click on -PRON- pipestem not take -PRON- advice i know in -PRON- present temper but so help -PRON- be around and have a hand in what happen if -PRON- go too far 
mind that 
at that juncture a long black wagon roll along the trail turn and come to a halt in front of the office 
two man get down from the seat and one approach bremerton 
mr bremerton 
yes 
the sheriff send -PRON- out 
come with -PRON- say bremerton and lead the way into the office be next day that i man ride out from town with an answer to message 
shake 
know -PRON- would turn the trick 
meet -PRON- phoenix friday morning 
the superintendent smile grimly 
deane be come and -PRON- be destine to receive a few surprisesnot all of -PRON- pleasant 
on thursday afternoon bremerton send to the bunkhouse for gorman the night amalgamator 
this millman be the key to some thing which the superintendent want to know 
gorman usually sleep in the forenoon and loaf in the afternoon messenger find -PRON- and -PRON- come straight to the office 
-PRON- be a rateye weaselfaced little man whose main object in life seem to be to keep out of sight 
the most devious way between two point be the short for gorman 
-PRON- enter the office so silently that bremerton do not know -PRON- be there until -PRON- be see beside the desk 
on deck mr bremerton say gorman nervously 
sit down say the superintendent 
the millman cuddle into a chair and look about -PRON- shiftily 
-PRON- have the air of one who be expect something disagreeable to happen 
if -PRON- be under the impression gorman that i donot know -PRON- be a thief -PRON- be mistaken 
the quiet conversational tone be weirdly out of harmony with the sentiment express manner disarm gorman for a moment and then when the burden of the word have sink in -PRON- bristle angrily 
nobody can talk to -PRON- like that by gorry 
insult like -PRON- i never stand for and never will -PRON- time be a fool return bremerton 
-PRON- know that if -PRON- have -PRON- desert -PRON- would have be catch in the same net that snare big steve and chombo 
while steve be here -PRON- turn in no more amalgam than -PRON- do since -PRON- s be go -PRON- have be turn in three time as much as -PRON- do before 
i be pretty sure -PRON- be steal but i have no time to bother with -PRON- 
now that -PRON- be evidently play fair i have no inclination to make -PRON- trouble 
all i want -PRON- to do be to talk 
some man with a guilty conscience can bluff successfully 
gorman be not one of that kind 
for long -PRON- have be afraid -PRON- be suspect 
i ainot admit a thing say gorman but what do -PRON- want -PRON- to talk about where be -PRON- on the night i reach phoenix king be in charge here and somebody have bring a supply of whisky into camp 
not much work be go on 
i guess -PRON- remember 
the millman wriggle uncomfortably 
i donot get -PRON- at all -PRON- answer 
i be at the mariquita right along hem and haw and sidestep return bremerton not intend to take any action against -PRON- be more kindly disposed however if -PRON- come out squaretoed and tell -PRON- what -PRON- know 
be -PRON- and big steve directly connect with carruther gorman take a red cotton handkerchief from -PRON- pocket and draw -PRON- across -PRON- face 
-PRON- be undergo an ordeal and show -PRON- straight now mr bremerton -PRON- whimper tryin to do what s right 
-PRON- ainot go to put -PRON- through if i tell the truth 
no 
do i get fire not so long as -PRON- keep straight 
well then chombo work with carruther and big steve work with chombo and i work with steve the gospel of -PRON- and kiss the book 
i didnot want to go in on -PRON- 
back away from the propersition for quite a spell 
steve allow though that -PRON- be go to get -PRON- toll of amalgam from the night shift and if i didnot come over then some night turn up missin and there d be an amalgamator in -PRON- place -PRON- could depend on 
i be scare into -PRON- mr bremerton that s all 
who dispose of the amalgam chombo get -PRON- to carruther and -PRON- turn -PRON- into cash 
-PRON- all get -PRON- whack and -PRON- be purty profitable 
when chombo have the pin pull on -PRON- steve sneak the stuff out of camp 
but i reckon -PRON- know about that 
have -PRON- any idea why the stuff jvas cache at oak flat 
-PRON- wasnot always cache there chombo pick out that place 
why 
i donot know only what i hear from big steve 
what do -PRON- hear why that if -PRON- find out anythin carruther want to make -PRON- look bad for the mallory murmur bremerton and sit back in -PRON- chair 
follow a moment reflection -PRON- go on who leave the mariquita mine that night the crowd beat -PRON- up at the phoenix townditch 
not -PRON- say gorman hastily i wasnot among -PRON- 
be steve bryden in the gang 
no 
steve be j gittin busy yvith the likker 
i hear that chombo be with that outfit purty sure no one else from the camp have a hand in the doing ball of amalgam be drop by one of the crowd 
then -PRON- be chombo drop -PRON- 
-PRON- be holdin out a little on carruther right along 
thus one dark point be clear up 
bremerton believe that the fellow -PRON- have knock into the canal be chombo 
what man do carruther have with -PRON- out in the hill 
do -PRON- know that gorman 
-PRON- be man who have be bounce from the mine 
griggsby let one or two go and lacey ditch the other 
carruther gather -PRON- in and -PRON- be more than willin to help -PRON- 
-PRON- make -PRON- worth -PRON- while 
where be those man now 
why when carruther go out -PRON- feller begin to runand i allow -PRON- be still a runnin 
-PRON- can gamble a blue stack -PRON- wonot show up around here no more mr bremerton 
i canot think of anything else gorman say the superintendent in luck to come out of that amalgam deal as well as -PRON- have 
keep that in mind 
that will be all 
the millman arise and pass softly toward the door 
-PRON- halt there for a final word to stay on and have no trouble 
so long as -PRON- do the right thing gorman -PRON- neednot worry 
i know in luck and standin pat on an honest deal 
much oblige to -PRON- mr bremerton 
-PRON- fade out of the office and the superintendent be positive that the fang of last enemy have be draw 
from that time on there would be only clear sailing for those in charge of the mariquita mine 
everything be propitious for that final accounting with deane 
thursday afternoon bremerton have dutch fre put a pair of cayuse to the pole of the mine buckboard 
when the rig be ready and the superintendent be about to climb into -PRON- for the ride to phoenix ohara come down from the mill off after deane bremerton ask the irishman

-PRON- business with deane be -PRON- own affair and go to handle -PRON- in -PRON- own way without let or hindrance from -PRON- meddle 
keep hand off not let that hot head of your take -PRON- to the divil entirely flare ohara 
so help -PRON- not have -PRON- do time for rough -PRON- with a yellow dog like deane 
smoke that in -PRON- pipe 
ohara turn back to the mill 
bremerton stare after -PRON- speculatively then climb into the buckboard and drive away 
at the fork in the trail -PRON- be surprised to find mariquita mount on -PRON- horse and evidently wait for -PRON- 
-PRON- ride out into the road ahead of -PRON- team 
-PRON- have ask deane to come here -PRON- exclaim 
-PRON- be necessary -PRON- return 
-PRON- get -PRON- information direct from denver i suppose

i be go to do what i can 
that miss mallory be all any man can do 
be -PRON- go to lose confidence in -PRON- -PRON- ride alongside the buckboard and lean sidewise to offer -PRON- hand 
no -PRON- say softly and with a wan smile for -PRON- be the only one who can do anything with deane 
help -PRON- and -PRON- will be worth -PRON- while 
if -PRON- win an interest for -PRON- in the property i have come to tell -PRON- that a part of -PRON- will be yours 
-PRON- drop the hand as though a serpent have sting -PRON- 
-PRON- know -PRON- very well -PRON- answer 
i canot be bribe miss mallory and sorry -PRON- think so 
-PRON- pick up the line and drive on 
until -PRON- be out of sight the girl sit motionless in the saddle look after -PRON- 
bremerton have work that evening in phoenix 
-PRON- call on a lawyer and have a certain paper fill out and make ready for sign 
on -PRON- way back to the hotel -PRON- step into a hardware store and buy a small revolver to take the place of the automatic -PRON- have lose

-PRON- roll up to the station promptly on time and deane be the last passenger to get out of the pullman 
the porter obsequiously hand -PRON- a black boston bag receive in exchange for -PRON- a silver dollar 
the mining king be a picturesque figure as -PRON- come down the platform 
-PRON- black stetson longtaile coat and flow tie compel attention 
a wonderful diamond sparkle in the white frill of -PRON- shirt and a massive chain wriggle across the front of -PRON- lowcut vest 
another stone conspicuous for size and brilliancy be very much in evidence on the third finger of -PRON- left hand 
good living and lack of exercise have double -PRON- girth since the prospect day with bremerton 
-PRON- walk be the cautious flatfooted waddle of the fat man although -PRON- carry -PRON- off with a touch of distinction 
all in all -PRON- be a most impressing spectacle 
-PRON- be plain that -PRON- know -PRON- and equally plain that -PRON- like -PRON- 
-PRON- money have bring with -PRON- power and influence and no man be more in the western limelight 
the reporter for three different newspaper have reach -PRON- ahead of bremerton 
-PRON- want interview 
blame if i can travel a dozen mile out of denver without have a bunch of -PRON- cimarron tight at -PRON- heel -PRON- complain goodnaturedly

maybe have news for -PRON- before i leave 
if i have i promise to herd -PRON- all together treat every one fair and not play favorite 
try one of these will -PRON- and just forget in town till ready to loosen up 
-PRON- draw a silvermounte cigarcase from the breast of -PRON- coat and offer -PRON- around 
then -PRON- catch sight of bremerton 
howdy pard -PRON- cry break away from the newspaperman drop -PRON- satchel and grab the tall gaunt figure in corduroy with both hand 
-PRON- do -PRON- by thunder and way this side of the six month

what do i say huh 
do i know what i be do or didnot i a cab go to the hotel and sit in at the chucktable hungriern a ute squaw on government ration 
bremerton pick up the satchel deane hook arm with -PRON- and -PRON- go on to the wait line of carriage 
a little later -PRON- be be hurry to the good hotel in town deane talk effusively and give -PRON- friend no chance for a word 
there be the plaza same old courthouse plaza where -PRON- and bremerton have sit in the shade year ago wonder where -PRON- would strike for next 
yes and by gorry there be the same identical umhrella tree -PRON- have sit under -PRON- beat all how the old time come back 
below the corner of first avenue be the wall of the town corral where -PRON- have keep -PRON- burro and saywouldnot -PRON- rattle -PRON- there be coffee where -PRON- have spend many a quarter for grub 
good grub too well grub than any deane have ever have since or anyhow -PRON- taste well 
i guess -PRON- a sureenough fact lee philosophized deane that the more money -PRON- get to spend for thing the less -PRON- appreciate -PRON- 
oh -PRON- sure be good day 
the mining king sit back into -PRON- coat and relapse into a mood of flabby and morbid reminiscence 
-PRON- come out of -PRON- shortly and drop a fat friendly hand on knee 
why donot -PRON- tune up old partner -PRON- ask 
i donot reckon -PRON- have peep since -PRON- get together 
the recollection of old time when deane be different and a comrade worth have have wrench hard at the purpose bremerton have in mind 
-PRON- brush the feeling aside and look into -PRON- friend face with a smile be hold -PRON- tongue and listen to -PRON- silas -PRON- answer 
not much chance for -PRON- to put in a word when -PRON- get start right i guess that s right and deane chuckle 
this be a regular picnic for -PRON- 
old scene old friend and a pot of money into the bargain 
enough to make a fellow grow young and feel -PRON- oats eh -PRON- get down at the hotel and deane hand the black bag to a wait boy 
careful with that son -PRON- warn two pint bottle of old scotch in that grip and if anything happen to -PRON- ruin 
deane write -PRON- name on the register 
-PRON- begin place under -PRON- but the latter protest book at another hotel say -PRON- go to be book at this one too go to have breakfast together already have breakfast 
why didnot -PRON- wait dash -PRON- -PRON- be treat -PRON- like a hire man more than a pard eat again that s all name go down and deane insist that -PRON- accompany -PRON- up to -PRON- room 
the black bag be open and deane pull out a flannel shirt a slouch hat a pair of khaki trouser and a pair of laced kneeboot 
-PRON- laugh like a boy as -PRON- show the outfit 
bet -PRON- life old pard i bring -PRON- war clothe along 
after i eat go to get into -PRON- and -PRON- and -PRON- will go potter off into the hill same as -PRON- use to 
great 
-PRON- wonot be hardly the same si say bremerton 
instead of walk and drive -PRON- packburro well ride in a buckboard -PRON- get any automobile in this man town automobile be a cultivate taste and the superintendent at the mariquita canot afford so much style only a counterfeit at this oldtime game deane 
two day of the old life would kill -PRON- 
maybe -PRON- be right 
help -PRON- to thisevery swig be warrant to take ten year off -PRON- shoulder prime 
a man in denver get -PRON- for -PRON- special 
bremerton do not drink 
-PRON- want a clear jiead while -PRON- be with deane 
while -PRON- back be turn -PRON- unscrew the cap and let -PRON- go at that 
deane face around take the flask out of -PRON- hand and help -PRON- generously 
in a few minute -PRON- go down to breakfast together 
deane raid the bill of fare while bremerton content -PRON- with a cup of coffee and griddlecake 
not much be say about the mine 
-PRON- be a subject for private discussion and that diningroom be altogether too public a place 
after the meal bremerton leave deane to get into -PRON- war clothe and go after the team and buckboard 
-PRON- be ten oclock before -PRON- take the trail into the hill 
now remark deane when -PRON- have leave the town well behind -PRON- -PRON- can get down to case lee please -PRON- a heap the way -PRON- have manage thing 
old griggsby be a false alarm and lacey be a weak sister 
-PRON- grab the big difficulty by the scruff of the neck and chuck -PRON- into the discard 
know -PRON- would 
this in few word be estimate of the man who have die try to serve -PRON- and of the other who have go down to physical wreck in -PRON- employ 
-PRON- donot know what griggsby would have do if -PRON- enemy hadnot pick -PRON- off say bremerton sharply and lacey be a whole man see -PRON- and i know 
oh well yes if -PRON- want -PRON- that way return deane impatiently 
success though be the only thing that count 
-PRON- pull the old working through to gloty and there wasnot much fuss about -PRON- either 
reel that off to -PRON- 
bremerton proceed to reel -PRON- off 
-PRON- take a good deal of satisfaction in make the case as bad as -PRON- be 
begin with the assault by the town canal -PRON- follow with the capture of steve and chombo then tell of the shot at the fork of the trail and finish with the fate of carruther 
skilfully -PRON- leave mariquita mallory out of the narrative 
not once be -PRON- name mention 
-PRON- discovery of the lose lead be deal with indefinitelytreate as an accident 
for all this -PRON- have -PRON- reason 
mariquita and -PRON- father would become prominent enough before -PRON- be through with the mining king 
deane be absorb in the recital 
the fire go out of -PRON- cigar again and again 
-PRON- breathe hard in the pinche and by the town canal and at the fork in the trail -PRON- fat hand clench and -PRON- swear under -PRON- breath 
but -PRON- fat face beam while bremerton be describe that footwide vein back of the overhang take -PRON- oath lee -PRON- comment earnestly when the telling be do i never think carruther would rough thing up like that become of the law in these part anyhow -PRON- protect a man in keep -PRON- own 
never mind that though 
a miss be as good as a mile and -PRON- skin the gang 
-PRON- make -PRON- blood sing just to hear -PRON- palaver about -PRON- 
a month run on that bonanza ore and the mine as good as sell 
half a million by thunder and -PRON- cost -PRON- only fifty thousand business bremerton the way to get rich 
there be no regret for that mound over griggsby in the phoenix cemetery and not a word of commiseration for the unlucky lacey eye be single to that half million 
-PRON- completely fill -PRON- perspective 
bremerton know that if -PRON- 5had fall at the fork of the trail -PRON- moneygrubbing friend would have experience few twinge and few regret 
the roar of flood water in arapahoe canon be almost silence 
deane have strangle -PRON- finer sentiment with a rope of gold 
the deane that be and the deane who now sit at side in the buckboard be two different man 
this realization do much to reconcile bremerton to the course -PRON- have map out for -PRON- 
in the interest of right and justice -PRON- could deal with this swagger purseproud trickster as -PRON- could not have deal -PRON- old loyal prospectorfriend 
deane offer bremerton a cigar 
bremerton decline and fill and light -PRON- pipe 
for some time -PRON- travel in silence 
finally deane arouse to observe i consider bremerton that another month of -PRON- at the mine will be enough get out for fifteen hundred less than i calculate on 
eh 
the superintendent eye narrow that -PRON- ask 
deane repeat -PRON- word 
bremerton have hear -PRON- plainly enough the first time but -PRON- want -PRON- repeat 
-PRON- mean say -PRON- that i be hire for six month for three thpusand dollar and that inasmuch as i have make good in half the time i be only entitle to half pay 
be that -PRON- 
something like that reply deane give a canny glance out of the tail of -PRON- eye 
be -PRON- go to split the tenthousanddollar bonus in two as well ask bremerton dryly 
well what do -PRON- think 
i donot know deane 
i shall have to give -PRON- a little reflection 
of course i intend to do the right thing burst out the other in a flurry of virtuous determination not be small with a friend and -PRON- can gamble a blue stack on that 
think -PRON- over old pard leave -PRON- to -PRON- 
whatever -PRON- say be right go with deane 
here be the final straw 
for risk -PRON- life for rob the mallory for make the mine worth half a million deane could haggle with -PRON- old friend over the paltry sum that be to be pay 
yes certainly bremerton would think -PRON- over 
a flurry of excitement pass through the camp with the arrival of deane 
every worker want a look at the big boss 
-PRON- be discuss frankly by a few 
these maintain that -PRON- win -PRON- game by jump man over the business checkerboard sacrifice ruthlessly in -PRON- dash for the kingrow 
-PRON- say that -PRON- employee be catspaw for pull -PRON- golden chestnut out of the fire that -PRON- have not the nerve for execute -PRON- own scheme that -PRON- buy man in open market and play -PRON- selfishly and unscrupulously for -PRON- own lawless gain 
talk of this kind however leave no sentiment of disgust or disapproval in -PRON- train success and -PRON- wealth dazzle the eye and confuse the understanding 
the mining king be a rugged and prominent figure all up and down the pacific slope and man shut -PRON- eye to -PRON- past and give -PRON- a hand for what -PRON- be 
ohara take no part in the buzz gossip in the mill 
-PRON- listen passively while gile and the engineer shout confidence to each other about the mineowner 
the irishman have tact as well as the courage of -PRON- conviction 
in the late afternoon deane and bremerton visit the blind gully and search out a place where the visitor could be lower with least danger and physical effort to -PRON- 
then -PRON- go to the overhang and examine the bonanza lead 
deane be astound overjoyed 
-PRON- talk of run up the price on the syndicate and of profit more largely by -PRON- superintendent work 
-PRON- greed outrun -PRON- delight and -PRON- stuffy voice jingle with prospective dollar 
-PRON- swagger up and down the tunnel 
-PRON- brag about what -PRON- have and what -PRON- be go to have the thing -PRON- have do and the thing -PRON- would do and -PRON- wind up with dam -PRON- bremerton i donot know but take the bit in -PRON- tooth and insist on give -PRON- every sou of that ten thousand 
-PRON- return to the mine in time for supper and deane insist on sit at table with the grimy sweatstained worker 
-PRON- try to be a good fellow and monopolize the conversation with joke and witticism 
the joke be coarse and the witticism farfetche but -PRON- never fail to draw a laugh 
follow supper and cigar smoke in front of the headquarters adobe bremerton make ready to tighten the coil 
as a preliminary step -PRON- invite deane to step into the office respect for -PRON- would not allow of association with deane 
-PRON- keep away from the headquarters adobe but watch -PRON- carefully from the shadow of the blinkhouse 
when the mineowner and the superintendent retire into the office the irishman approach the little mudwalle building and take up -PRON- position at a point where the mumble voice reach -PRON- ear 
the matter of what bremerton be about to do worry -PRON- 
-PRON- know -PRON- friend so well that -PRON- be expect drastic measure and these -PRON- be confident deane would fight 
out of that clash what be to come 
when the voice grow high when passion pitch -PRON- in the high key that mean a narrowing of argument and a resort to force ohara be plan to interfere 
bremerton may go too far with be conceivableand the irishman would step in and call a halt before -PRON- friend go to extreme 
while bide -PRON- time with every nerve tense and every faculty alert ohara hear a sound of galloping 
-PRON- spring into the trail and be suddenly confront by mariquita mallory 
saint defend -PRON- -PRON- gasp 
miss mallory -PRON- will please forgive -PRON- for say -PRON- but this be no place for -PRON- 
where be mr bremerton the girl demand where be deane 
i want to talk with -PRON- 
i watch while deane be take inter the gully and show the bonanza lead and i come here to do what i can to get -PRON- right

a well man than bremerton never live and i canot let -PRON- get the bad of anything or -PRON- think -PRON- s in danger murmur mariquita quickly -PRON- think -PRON- s risk -PRON- life try to get -PRON- right for -PRON- 
never not in the way -PRON- mean and ohara laugh shortly 
why lee could take this fat mining king with one hand and strangle the breath out of -PRON- 
begorry -PRON- that or something like -PRON- that worry -PRON- the bad of the law do -PRON- mind 
-PRON- canot kill a human coyote though -PRON- be and no matter what -PRON- deserve without complication with sheriff and court and prison wall 
if necessary here to save bremerton from that 
then stay with -PRON- and help -PRON- 
in spite of -PRON- protest -PRON- stay leave -PRON- horse by the corral and then sit beside ohara on the rockheap where -PRON- have post -PRON- 
-PRON- listen silently to the drone of voice and once tone rise high and -PRON- word come to -PRON- distinctly work for -PRON- 
what be the mallory to -PRON- that -PRON- be so keen for -PRON- hand clutch ofrm convulsively and a sharp breath flutter through -PRON- lip stand to -PRON- gun this bremerton whisper ohara

the like of -PRON- to be talk to bremerton like that grit ohara where i begin expect trouble say anything donot do anything just listen and leave -PRON- to -PRON- miss mallory 
so anxious and apprehensive -PRON- wait and listen 
meanwhile in the office matter be approach a climax 
deane have follow bremerton into the office wonderingly 
there be that in face which deane remember to have see there out around san simone once when -PRON- be corner by mexican bent oil take -PRON- burro and camp equipment 
the look and manner of the superintendent puzzle deane 
bremerton light the lamp and place -PRON- on top of the desk then -PRON- wave deane to a chair 
sila say bremerton banteringly -PRON- be a shrewd one tell -PRON- in denver how -PRON- get hold of the mariquita mine 
i ask -PRON- if -PRON- be a square deal -PRON- remember and -PRON- say -PRON- be 
well wasnot -PRON- 
-PRON- be clever and a false note of admiration rang in bremerton voice 
-PRON- keep mallory dangling while -PRON- put on a side deal with carruther 
mallory be an old fool chuckle deane whose ear be too gross to detect the false note 
i let -PRON- nibble and then jerk the bait away from -PRON- 
but i didnot do that by thunder until -PRON- be toolate for -PRON- to raise the money in other quarter 
carruther be hard to manage 
-PRON- be as big a fool though as mallory 
-PRON- could have extend the time for mallory but -PRON- be afraid 
i have offer -PRON- twentyfive thousand well than mallory be to give -PRON- and -PRON- greed get the well cf -PRON- common sense 
then after -PRON- be all over carruther get sore and begin to holler

bremerton sit quietly and listen and marvel 
this be -PRON- old friend who be talk a man who have share -PRON- blanket and -PRON- wavering fortune for year something for -PRON- to store up for future use bremerton go on deane with the air of one who wish to see another prosper along the line -PRON- have make -PRON- own see how i pull this off 
quit be so blame conscientious and profit by the lesson 
get busy on a scheme of -PRON- own

do the other fellow for a spell and donot let -PRON- do -PRON- 
sabe 
oh i sabe all right answer bremerton 
maybe -PRON- seem strange to -PRON- deane but rather have -PRON- fool notion than all -PRON- pile of dirty dollar that snap the other willing enough to take -PRON- dirty dollar by thunder

that lose lead will do the trick 
griggsby couldnot find -PRON- and lacey couldnot find -PRON- ou get onto -PRON- and -PRON- be -PRON- last bet pay -PRON- a thousand dollar continue the superintendent the money

-PRON- would have be pick off by the bullet have -PRON- not lead -PRON- under the overhang 
that be how i come to discover the lose vein 
-PRON- would never have be find otherwise and this property would have continue to be nothing more than a poor proposition and dear at the fifty thousand -PRON- pay for -PRON- have miss malory not take -PRON- into that tunnel 
deane stare at bremerton -PRON- little eye glimmer 
but -PRON- have not a word to say 
-PRON- see how -PRON- be deane the superintendent continue 
merely as a matter of right a simple case of justice ask -PRON- to deed a half interest in the mine to mariquita mallory 
when that have take length breadth and depth in mine -PRON- give vent to a roar of wrath work for -PRON- 
what be the mallory to -PRON- that -PRON- be so keen for -PRON- not work for -PRON- silas

carruther be out of the run the bonanza ledge be find and there be nothing between -PRON- and half a million but a little time for put rich ore through the mill 
i want to say however that i be not go to help -PRON- rob the mallory when all the credit be due the girl

deane give vent to another roar and flounder out of -PRON- chair 
-PRON- shake a fat fist at -PRON- old friend and lean across the table to shout a traitor that s what -PRON- be 
-PRON- be on the rock and i give -PRON- a chance 
that be what i get for -PRON- 
a gray eye gleam like polished steel 
in just one second -PRON- be all energy and flame resolution 
a bound land -PRON- on -PRON- foot and -PRON- throw -PRON- half across the table to look into face 
yes a traitor -PRON- say between -PRON- tooth 
the good thing do since i come to the mariquita mine be to turn against -PRON- 
the silas deane of five year ago be dead -PRON- be not even the shell of -PRON- a knave a thief and a liar -PRON- make a move deane 
sit downthere at -PRON- desk 
a move of the right hand and bremerton be look over the sight of a revolver little eye grow filmy the purple die from -PRON- flabby cheek and leave -PRON- a sickly pasty white 
this mining king have never be a coward 
-PRON- know bremerton however 
that voice that look mean that bremerton be no longer bremerton but lee reckless 
the change from the quiet selfrestrained man to another whose will as -PRON- only law and whose hand would stop at nothing have be consummate in a flash 
deane slump heavily against the table 
slowly -PRON- raise a hand 
for sake bremerton -PRON- whisper hoarsely come out of that -PRON- old partnerremember arapahoe canon 
remember -PRON- day when -PRON- sit down 
the command be sharp and metallic like the snapping of a trigger 
deane wheeze and roll backward into a chair 
the point of the revolver follow -PRON- 
be this what -PRON- get -PRON- out here for -PRON- mumble to threaten and bullyrag -PRON- on -PRON- own property i bring -PRON- out here -PRON- miserable excuse for the man i use to know to force -PRON- to do one thingjust one thing that -PRON- can look back on without regret when -PRON- take the long trail 
do -PRON- think -PRON- nerve will fail and that i will hang back 
say thick shoulder quiver 
-PRON- crouch forward -PRON- elbow on the desk and speak weakly over -PRON- shoulder no 
in -PRON- present temper -PRON- would do anything the right point to start on get -PRON- wrong 
and donot -PRON- dare mention arapahoe canon 
the word in -PRON- mouth be an insult to the silas deane who be -PRON- friend

for that alone -PRON- be not fit to live crazy come gurglingly from deane work for -PRON- here risk -PRON- neck for -PRON- and give back the money for which i sell -PRON-

this blow at the most vulnerable point bring back -PRON- couragefor a moment 
not if -PRON- kill -PRON- -PRON- mutter -PRON- property and -PRON- will not rob -PRON- 
a deed like that wouldnot hold good in law nohow -PRON- sense enough to know that -PRON- will hold goodthis deed never dispute -PRON- 
if -PRON- try that -PRON- will know that alive and camp on -PRON- trail 
pick up that pen and sign -PRON- name 
again deane turn -PRON- ghastly face over -PRON- shoulder 
the muzzle of a blued barrel be within a yard of -PRON- and back of the barrel be a man prime with a reckless disregard of consequence hand tremble 
-PRON- pick up the paper and bow close to read -PRON- 
-PRON- fall from -PRON- shake finger and drop to the floor sign under protest say deane 
pick -PRON- up for -PRON- 
get -PRON- -PRON- wise to -PRON- trick 
deane bent over grunt and wheeze 
the chair slip from under -PRON- and -PRON- go to -PRON- knee 
then reach for the deed with -PRON- left hand -PRON- bring -PRON- right to the front of the blue flannel shirt 
the thick finger catch at a handgrip 
the sharpeye bremerton catch the move but -PRON- be too late to interfere 
the table be between -PRON- and deane

a bullet tear -PRON- way through the front of -PRON- shirt and range upward over -PRON- left arm hand drop and -PRON- sway a moment 
tricky to the last -PRON- gasp 
that gununder the didnot know -PRON- fall sprawl backward with a force that make the adobe wall shiver and send the lampflame flaring into the chimney 
a scream come from somewhere 
deane do not hear -PRON- 
approach footstep crunch the gravel 
and deane do not hear -PRON- 
mechanically -PRON- pick up the deed and straighten erect 
walk around the table -PRON- stand look down on bremerton with stare uncomprehende eye 
ohara spring furiously into the room out of the night 
one look at the form on the floor and -PRON- jump at deane 
i think -PRON- be -PRON- not bremerton -PRON- cry kill -PRON- for this 
no rasp deane lift -PRON- revolver and level -PRON- not kill -PRON-

but look for mike ohara 
-PRON- owe -PRON- something for this night work deane and -PRON- a debt -PRON- will pay 
deane back away from the harmless revolver as from a rattlesnake 
-PRON- be stare at -PRON- as -PRON- reach the door and -PRON- be still stare as -PRON- step backward into the night the fold paper in one hand and the level revolver in the other 
another moment and -PRON- be go
