skates skis and a saphead by william wallace cook wide awake magazine volume number jan deeply steeped in gloom perfectly described the condition of young nixon peters
loneliness and bitter regret pervaded his soul as he sat by himself on the rear seat of the flying sleigh and thought of what might have been
he had reason to believe that he was the best skater and ski jumper entered in the winter sports contest at lake on the preceding afternoon and yet he had lost both main events by an apparent failure to look well to his equipment at the last moment
every one had expected that he would blunder somewhere and so no one was greatly disappointed that is no on except nixon peters
almost at the takeoff of the jump one of skis had broken
he had taken a wild header and landed in a snow bank with heels in the air
a big laugh had been the result
also he had cast a skate at the critical moment of the skating race and the other contestants had slit past him porter markham in the lead
this same porter markham too had won the ski jump
now porter markham was on the front seat of the sleigh driving blithely and exchanging jest and small talk with hesther morton who sat beside him
truly nixon lines had fallen in hard places
nixon was nix to those who knew him best
often he suffered the crowning indignity of being referred to as the saphead
he had heard the unlovely nickname applied to him many times while digging himself out of the snow bank
it had punctuated the merriment released by his sorry mishap
hesther morton had joined in the riot of laughter
nixon knew this only too well for she was the first person he had seen after digging the snow out of his eyes
for hesther to be amused at his expense well that was something that hurt
then while seeking with dogged resolution to retrieve himself on the steel runners a strap had broken ad a skate had shot off across the glittering ice
peters had slipped and slammed around on the course like a crazy curling stone finally cutting the feet out from under a fat spectator who called him saphead right to his face
ah what a windup for a sorry afternoon
peters clenched his hands in his bearskin gloves and crouched down on the rear seat in a fruitless effort to efface himself
he was nineteen and porter markham was twenty
they both worked for uncle silas goddard who had a ranch in montana and made a business of sending range horses into north dakota to be halter broken and sold to the settlers
goddard was uncle to all his men in the sense that gives an avuncular character to every genial middleaged person who looks after the welfare of younger employees
in the early summer uncle silas had sent a hundred horses into north dakota
business had not been good and late fall found half the horses still outhand
these horses were being wintered at the morton ranch on marsh hay cut and stacked by peters markham and reece bailey who had been sent by uncle silas to take care of the horse herd
when spring came there was a promise of turning off every head of the stock at a good profit
the winter so far had not been particularly lonely for the montana men
the snows of december had been light and it had been possible for th horses to paw out considerable forage in the hills
january however brought in a good fall of the beautiful and it had been necessary to corral and shelter the animals and to go extensively into the feeding
reese bailey uncle foreman found time to play cribbage with lance morton father and peters and nixon acquired leisure for skating and skiing popular sports at their home ranch in the rockies
a would have been a creek in a country of large through the morton holdings and its glassy surface offered a resistless invitation to the steel runners
as for the skiing there were plam and hill for running climbing and glissading
while bailey and morton were busy at their eternal fifteentwo fifteenfour peters and markham were skating or skiing often with hesther who was fond of both sports
the girl if appearances were to be believed was rather fond of markham also but had few smiles to waste on peters
in his bashful blundering way peters tried to make himself agreeable to hesther
he was big and awkward however and had towcolored hair a slow wit and a few graces of speech or manner
his efforts to impress hesther were overwhelmed by the never failing persiflage and the rakish dress and carriage of handsome porter markham
markham posessed a confidence in himself that was sublime a confidence that shone brilliantly in contrast with clumsy ineffectiveness of nixon peters
peters realized this and nourished a bitter grudge against his physical and mental shortcomings
he used to dream of a fire at the ranch in which he posed as a hero and bore the fair hesther to safety from the ranch house through a furnace of flames
then in his visions hi pictured the girl as taking his hand and humbly asking his forgiveness for her failure to perceive his sterling qualities from the first
during such moments of illusion the saphead was almost happy
but the ranch house never took fire and the chance to prove himself a hero by rescuing hesther morton was denied by fate
in however an opportunity presented itself through the winter sports at lake
markham and peters entered themselves in the skijumping context and skating race
they drove the fifty miles which separated from the lagke and hesther went with them to see the carnival of sports and to spend a night or two with relatives in lake city
again peters had dreams but now on the homeward drive every hope was shattered and he longed for for a period of blank obscurity and complete retirement
he could have declared that one of his skis had been tampered with and that one of his skate straps had been all but cut through with the point of a knife
examination made him sure of both facts yet it had not occurred to him to sob
he had blundered in not making certain of his skis and skates beforehand so he could not see how any one but himself was at fault
as he crouched in the back seat of the sleigh he considered requesting uncle silas goddard to recall him to the montana headquarters
there at last he would be rid of markham and cut off forever from the demoralizing and disdainful eyes of hesther
yes he would go back to the home ranch and he would do this in spite of something which he knew and which was very important to his future
it was common knowledge that a place of preferment was to be given by uncle silas to either peters or to foremanship at a newer ranch with a chance to acquire an interest in the horses and cattle
reece bailey was watching peters and markham and on his report uncle silas would act
to retire from the north dakota venture of the ranchowner now would cut peters off entirely from promotion and drop the plum in porter hand
but peters in the bitterness of his heart was allowing nothing aside form his own peace of mind to influence him
yes he would ask uncle silas to recall him to montana
you still there nix
markham suddenly asked turing to look rearward
peters grunted so blamed quiet went on markham with a laugh that i reckoned you might have taken another header into the snow back a ways on the trail
hesther joined in the laugh and in spirit poor peters writhed
the short day was closing and the sun went down beyond the white horizon in cold glory
they were five miles form and markham had driven the horses so hard that they were nearly fagged
they breathed wheezingly and frost coated heaving sides
the place dragged in spite of relentless use of the whip
anyhow spoke up peters suddenly you might think of the team a little porter near tuckered doing this driving cried markham never yet had to ask a saphead for advice in handling horses
and again the whip fell on the straining flanks
peters clenched his fists in the bearskin gloves
it occurred to him that he could lift markham bodily out of the front seat take his place and do the driving himself but he did not
the horses struggled on and in the falling dark the travelers topped a rise that gave them a dim view of the buildings of ranch
a light showed in one of the ranchhouse windows like a star and toward it markham drove and presently halted at the door
now that handled the reins all the way from lake nix remarked markham as he jumped out and helped hesther to alight allow its up to you to take care of the team
cold essie
not a bit the girl answered and hurried toward the door
markham followed her and peter drove on to the stable
as he unhitched and brought the horses into the shelter he was a little surprised to discover that there were no other animals in the place
the team was but cow horse together with those of peters and markham should have been in the stable unless bailey was out oat the corral and shelter sheds looking after the fifty range horses that were kept up there
peters lighted a lantern removed the harness from the horses and after putting hay in the mangers began rubbing the animals down with an old gummy sack
he was hard at this when a call reached his ears from the house peters
this the jump
it was voice and there was a note of alarm in it that startled peters
lantern in hand he hurried out of the stable and made his way to the house
flinging the door wide he crossed the threshold into the ranchhouse sitting room wrong porter he asked
the cannonball stove glowed with heat
that and the bright oil lamp dazzled eyes for the moment and he could not see what was going on in the room
bailey has been hurt came the voice of markham
every horse in the herd whas been driven off by they even took mount with the rest
biggest outrage that ever happened in these parts like to know what the blamed country is coming to
the blur lifted from before peters eyes
he saw bailey his face twisted with pain lying on a couch
mrs morton bent over him bathing a wounded shoulder from a basin of hot water
her husband was walking up and down fuming and sputtering
markham stood beside the couch looking down at the foreman with a queer expression on his face
hesther all excited was removing her wraps with shaking hands
horses stolen gasped peters dazed by the weird calamity
how could it happen
is bailey badly hurt stand there gawping fussed morton
something has got to be done and its up to you and markham to do it
a gang of scoundrels from across the line made off with the stock and its been no more than three hours since it happened
take my team and go to roscommon
the sheriffs got to be notified
bailey says the thieves are making for the north and if you and markham are quick a posse can get between the gang and the boundary line
for heavens sake peters wake up
peters shook himself put down the lantern and came to the side of the couch
whey donot markham wake up he asked he suggested anything yet
nothing to suggest markham answered flashing a sharp look at peters twenty miles to roscommon and no chance of getting there ahead of the thieves and the stolen stock
the only animals we can put our hands on are the two that brought us from lake and they are done up
you know that peters
what about using skates or skis inquired peters
by thunder there is a way of getting to roscommon in time to help the sheriff head off the stolen stock
there was a dominant compelling note in the voice of peters
it was so unexpected in its assertiveness that every one in the room was startled
his washedout blue eyes fenced aggressively with the snapping black eyes of markham
skates or skis repeated markham his upper lip curling
why its all of thirty miles to roscommon if you follow the crook of the river
and how much would you figure it by skis if you crossed bear butte instead of going around it
talk sense if you know how nix forget the fellows who rustled our stock have three hours the lead
how far will three hours of driving in this snow get the stolen herd returned peters
the thieves will have a tough job of it
they bailey twisted his flushed face from under the ministering hands of mrs morton
the varmints are going north by the long knife dry wash he said his voice shaking with the pain of his wound only three miles west of roscommon
if you boys could get word to the sheriff somehow i reckon he might head off the raiders with a posse
but if you do anything youll have to do it quick
porter and his eyes swerved to markham looking to si goddard is looking to you
nigh on to five thousand dollars worth of horses are being pushed towards the border and here helpless to do a thing
it donot seem possible to do a thing reece returned markham
if we could round up a crown of men in short order and take after the thieves on fresh horses like enough we might overhaul them
but wheres the riding stock
why nearest neighbor is ten miles away
peters flashed a disapproving glance at markham pulled off his bearskin gloves and slumped down in a chair by the stove
from the pockets of his overcoat he took his skates also a new strap he had secured in lake city
quickly he replaced the broken strap with the new one
you going to try and get to roscommon by river nix
morton inquired figure the chances are better that way than going over bear butte on skis peters answered
the rivers clean of snow and mostly the ice is like a lookingglass
i am going to do my best to get word to the sheriff and to start a roscommon doctor this way to look after bailey
you are locoed growled markham all right to get a doctor for reese here but there ainot a chance to save the stock this side of the line
let the raiders get it across the boundary and then take the matter up with the canadian mounted police my advice
if you wait till the stock is out of this country put in the rancher there wonot be a chance
not a chance on earth agreed bailey
that outfit of thieves knowed exactly what they was about
everything was cut and dried and somebody sure tipped them off regarding the layout here bet a thousand against a chink wash ticket that them bronks will be took care of across the line sost they canot be located by nobody
them thieves picked a time when i was alone at the shelter sheds and porter and nix was to the winter sports at the lake
they dropped me out of my saddle without whys or wherefores and then made off with my mount and sent a man to the stable for peters and riding horses
by the time i covered the mile back to the ranch house the stock was ell on the way north
he broke off abruptly clenching his teeth hard as a spasm of pain ran through his body get another coat remarked peters rising from his chair and starting for the door that led to his room
it wonot be possible to make any kind of time in a long overcoat like this
he disappeared
markham came to the side of the couch
if peters has a chance reece said he hell make a bobble of some kind and spoil it all his way
i better go to roscommon myself
peters can use his skates and take the river trail and use my skis and go over the butte
i donot think we have a ghost of snow ahead of the stock but its up to us to see what we can do the talk exclaimed morton approvingly
the thieves had help from this ranch he added darkly tossing a significant glance toward the door through which peters just passed and i havenot got a whole lot of confidence peters is square bailey averred
square as a die
he jest donot seem to have the knack for puttin his idees across
the man that saves them bronks porter he added significantly is goin to make the biggest kind of a hit with goddard
if any one connects with the sheriff at roscommon in time to save the bronks markham returned it will be me
he spoke with a confidence that thrilled every one in the room and hesther if the red in her cheeks and the sparkle in her eyes were any indication most of all be ready he finished moving toward the door in about two shakes
you must have some hot coffee before you start said hesther and see that it is ready for you
markham was back in the room before peters had reappeared
he wore a leather coat and the bottoms of his trousers were laced inside his high shoe tops
trim and handsome he looked and ready for a grueling nights work
hesther was just placing the coffee on the table and she lifted her eyes to flash a glance of admiration at the young ski runner be ready in a minute essie said markham with a nod and a smile
taking his skis from a corner of the room he sat down laid them across his knees and proceeded to grease them well from a can which he had brought into the room and had placed on the stove
while he worked peters came lumbering in
peters had donned a ragged sweater whose collar came up around his ears
over this was buttoned a faded and threadbare coat
his oldfashioned skates were under his arm
from beneath the rim of his motheaten fur cap his tow hair showed in a sort of fringe
the cap had ear flaps with strings at their ends
the flaps were loose and the strings fluttered as he moved his head
his shoes were of cowhide strong and serviceable but not at all ornamental
he had tied the bottoms of his trousers to his ankles with pieces of cord
the contrast between peters and markham was very striking
so far as appearances went markham had it on peters by about a hundred to one going too nix observed markham laying his skis to one side go over the butte and got a months pay that says i beat you into roscommon
maybe you will returned peters starting for the outside door
there was more bitterness in peters heart
he believed he understood the situation
markham had won the ski jump and the skating race and now he wanted to round off his triumphs by being first to carry the news of the horse thieving to the sheriff
markham was planning a spectacular bit of work for uncle si goddard incidentally
mainly he was thinking of the effect of his nights success on hesther morton
wait nixon called mrs morton
essie has got some hot coffee ready and you must have a cup before you leave
the ranchers wife was the only one who ever gave much thought to peters
she considered him now when the consideration and confidence of the others seemed to center wholly in markham
much obliged mrs morton peters answered but i donot reckon take the time
you see he added as he laid a hand on the doorknob a case where every minute counts
before the good woman could answer the door had closed behind peters
markham pulled up his shoulders in a shrug as he lifted the cup of steaming coffee first blunder he remarked
he has a habit of going it blind and without giving any preparation to the work ahead of him hope he wonot meet with any accident murmured mrs morton
that boys got a good heart even if he is a little odd always be a blunderer and a saphead grunted her husband
if the stolen horses are recovered itll be markham who makes it possible
markham did not tarry long over his coffee
within a few moments after peters left he was out in the nipping air
hesther a shawl over her head stepped through the doorway to watch while he crossed the trampled snow around the ranch house and then knelt to thrust the toes of his shoes in the bilgeri binding of the skis and to buckle the ankle straps
he arose presently and shouting a farewell to the girl glided away over the snowy level gracefully swiftly with his ski stick biting into the snow and propelling him onward doing a mans work this night murmured hesther and he will as he won at lake city carnival
then she went back into the house to describe in detail how peters had lost and markham had won in the winter sports contests at the lake
river had many twists and turns in the thirty miles which it covered between ranch and roscommon
passing within a stones throw of the ranch house it flowed almost due north for six miles then entering the rough hill country it doubled back on its course for three miles rounded the base of bluff in a fourmile curve came east by south around the base of bear butte and then curved in a northwesterly direction for the last twelve miles that carried it through the outskirts of the county seat
markham on his skis could con a direct course to roscommon bisecting the river at three points and finally climbing the butte for a long glissade into the town
that glissade right into the edge of the settlement measured ten miles of down grade
the slopes of bear butte were smooth and directly under its crest the descent was steep
a mile of this and then the course fell away more gently
markham if he made good time to the eastern base of bear butte would very likely reach that particular spot ahead of peters for he would have to travel only seven miles while peters was going sixteen
where markham would lose would be in climbing the butte and where he would make up his loss would be in the long glissade down the opposite side
at the rivers edge peters screwed the skates into his heels pulled the straps tight and buckled them then put on his bearskin gloves and struck out
he was well away toward bluff before markham made his first crossing of the river near the ranch house
the ice was in splendid condition
a strong wind had swept it clean of loose snow save here and there at the turns where drifts had formed
then a slight thaw a few days before had been followed by a tightening of the cold and all rough spots had been smoothed away
markham whose steel runners were the very last word in allmetal skates excelled as a figure skater
he could cut all sorts of graceful figures on the ice and with hesther morton would do a sort of waltz which the girl seemed to consider rare sport
peters on the other hand was not proficient at that sort of thing
he preferred straight skating possibly because he realized that fancy capers were quite out of his line
the steel wood and leather with which he was shod seemed best adapted to straightaway work anyhow
peters knew every foot of the river between the ranch and roscommon
he had covered that long stretch of ice several times while getting himself in trim for the skating race at lake
there was white ice under the shelter of the bluff and the butte caused by a fall of snow while the first crystals were forming
this had been full of air bubbles and had been treacherous up to the time the severe frost had followed the thaw
after that the liquefied snow had congealed into a sound and superlative smoothness
there was not a spot to be feared on the entire course
with long steady swinging strokes peters swept around the first turn and came south on the stretch which markham was to cross in order to thread a seam through bluff
but although the moonlight was brilliant upon the sparkling snow crust he could see nothing of his rival
it might be he reasoned that markham had already effected his second crossing of the river and was even then in the gash that cut through the bluff
peters ground his teeth and with his runners ringing musically passed like a gliding specter around the bluffs base
three miles farther and he might obtain a view of markham as he emerged from the shallow defile and pushed over the open levels toward the butte
he was having queer thoughts about markham
why had the fellow protested against any attempt to reach roscommon and notify the sheriff
then in the face of his protests why had he determined to pit his skis against peters accomplish the thing which he had averred could not be accomplished
there was but one answer to this according to peters conclusions
markham could not bear to think that peters might succeed that he might win favorable notice from uncle silas and that he might gain some credit in the eyes of hesther morton
markham was not thinking of saving the horses no he was impressed with the idea of his own prestige and importance and he could not take a chance of losing out to a saphead
that was all there was to it so peters believed
a determination to win that race and save the stolen stock grew stronger and stronger in peters breast
here after the miserable failures at lake was a most unexpected opportunity to retrieve himself
it was his business to make the most of it
three straight miles lay ahead of him to the westward of the bluff
coming down the stretch like the wind he surveyed the shadowy opening of the swale in the hope of catching a glimpse of markham
but the ski runner was not in sight
in the distance the sparkling crest of bear butte could be vaguely determined yet between the bluff and the butte no dusky figure could be seen toiling on the skis
he hasnot cleared the bluff yet thought peters exultantly leading him by ginger
the river at the end of the threemile stretch described a curve like a gigantic horseshoe
in its first beginning the stream had attempted to run west by south meeting the rough country its course had been deflected toward the northwest then striking the widespreading base of bear butte it had followed northeast and east on its way around the huge uplift
on clearing the butte the puyallup struck off due northwest and so in a dozen miles came to roscommon
peters although he had not timed himself knew he had been making excellent speed
he was seventeen miles from the ranch and coming rapidly under the shadow of the butte
markham could scarcely climb the massive rise and glissade into roscommon ahead of him
so far as he had been able to discover markham was not yet anywhere near bear butte i say peters
peters was amazed
above his ringing steel a sharp cry echoed in the frosty air
it was voice and calling his name
peters dug into the ice with the heels of his runners and came to a quick halt
that you porter he called
yes nix in hard luck
stop a minute will you
the voice came from a shadowy overhang at the buttes foot
peters skated toward the black cavity and was met by the dusky figure of markham limping out of the darkness and across the ice
markham had his skis under his arm
by george cried peters
you got here in a hurry wrong fell from a sixfoot bank as i was crossing the river and splintered one of my skis was the answer and i canot go on with the wood runners
i reckon take your skates markham added coolly
peters caught his breath reckon you wonot he returned with spirit going on to roscommon start the sheriff and a posse for the dry wash and get a doctor for bailey
what do you take me for a plain everyday saphead said markham
down on the ice peters and off with those skates
pronto is the word no time to lose
markham had dropped the skis and stripped a glove from his right hand
the bare hand was in the pocket of his leather coat
suddenly as the two stood facing each other the hand emerged from the pocket with a short uglylooking bulldog revolver
markham leveled the weapon and the moonlight glinted frostily on the barrel
again peters caught his breath
he was dazed bewildered
to be threatened in that manner by one whom he had believed to be a friendor if not a friend at least a fellow employee of uncle silas goddard with interests in a decided shock
you crazy porter demanded peters when he could find his tongue
hardly was the reply with a husky illomened laugh it will be a long time before you reach roscommon my laddybuck
take off those skates i tell you
i mean business peters
there was that in words and manner which left no doubt of the fact that he meant business
peters was wild with indignation and anger but he was also helpless
reece bailey say to this when i tell him he asked dropping to the ice and working at the skate straps cross that bridge when we get to it was the response
throw the skates over here when you get em off
you had to butt into this deal with the fool suggestion of getting word to the sheriff now blame you take your medicine bound to win grunted peters if you have to do it with a gun
you ainot square markham
i may be a good deal of a saphead but i found when it was too late that one of my skis and one of my skate straps had been tampered with at lake
you did that
why didnot you tell hesther about it jeered markham or the judges of the contests you have nerve enough to put up a holler
peters gave the skates a shove across the ice
ten feet away markham sat down to screw the skates to his heels and adjust the straps
the revolver lay at his side and he watched peters sharply as he worked
peters a desperate purpose forming in his mind was awaiting the moment when he could spring to the attack
he was not to be conquered in that way
there was plenty of fight in him and markham would discover it to his cost
markham worked rapidly
the skates were on and snugly buckled and he was just rising when peters went after him with a short run and a slide
but if peters was quick markham was a shade quicker
crack the revolver exploded in the air and peters left arm seemed suddenly to have been scorched with a hot iron
the shock caused him to lose his footing and he fell in a sprawl on the slippery surface of the river
you would have it shouted markham fiercely something more for you to tell bailey
the last words faded in mellow ring of sliding steel
peters sitting up on the ice and clasping his numbed arm with his right hand watched markham slip from sight around the curve at the foot of bear butte
peters was thinking less of the pain in his arm than he was of the rascally work of peter markham
the fellow must be mad to make such an attack
he had planned the whole thing of course and had armed himself before leaving reaching the butte ahead of peters he had gone into hiding against the moment peters should come skating down the river
then by way of making his treachery more contemptible he had called to peters for help only to threaten him with a revolver and steal his skates
you bet tell bailey muttered peters reckon thisll cook your goose with goddard even if you do get to roscommon in time to have the sheriff head off the bronks
what can a fellow make of a man like him acting thataway
with difficulty peters removed his coat and shoved up the shirt and sweater sleeves
the wound was in the forearm and was bleeding profusely
with a bandanna handkerchief he bound up the injury tightly knotting the handkerchief corners with his fingers and his teeth then getting into his coat again he began considering his next move
it was twelve miles by river to roscommon and eighteen miles back to the ranch
even if it was now useless for him to get to the town in order to carry the news of the horse stealing to the sheriff returning to would have been a fierce pull on his strength and he dared not attempt it
he would make his way to roscommon
if he could reach the settlement before markham left it he would lodge a complaint against the treacherous scoundrel and have him held in the town jail
peters was burning for revenge
yes that is what he would do
he got up feeling a little dizzy and faint and started down the river
his feet struck against skis and another idea came to him
perhaps he could tinker up the splintered ski and use the runners
after the accident that had lost him the jump at lake peters had bought a little fine wire for the mending of his own broken runner
that wire was still in his trousers pocket and it might be that he could use it in fixing splintered ski
picking up both runners and holding the damaged one between his knees he struck a match and made a careful examination
the stout ash had been cracked under the binding mechanism
a few wraps of fine wire might yet make the runner serve
with his jackknife peters dug a shallow groove across the skis bottom and in this he imbedded the half dozen coils of wire that he wove over and over and made fast on the upper surface
for himself he had never fancied that bilgeri binding
although light and well made it was not nearly so strong or dependable as the lilienfield binding with which peters own skis were equipped
peters work had been done at a tremendous disadvantage
he could work with one hand only and in lieu of his other hand he made shift to use his teeth
the moon although brilliant left much to be desired in the matter of light for such fine and exacting labor and sense of touch had to help him where that of sight failed
in the main however he did very well all things considered and when he had secured his feet in the bindings he arose on the ash runners with a feeling of exultation in his breast
where was the stick
his search for it carried him to the overhang and there he found not only the ski stick but two strips of gunny sacking each heavily knotted in the middle
those strips of sacking rather puzzled peters
markham had brought them as an aid in getting up the steep eastern slope of the butte
but why had he prepared himself with them if his object was to waylay peters and secure the skates
markham always figures a matter out both ways peters reflected
he brought the gun to help corral the skates but if i happened to beat him to the butte then hed have to keep right on over the rise
if he couldnot do one thing then he was ready to do the other more he splintered that ski apurpose and he didnot do it until he knew i was behind him at the overhang
he didnot want me to have a chance to use the ski thats all
it never occurred to him that have something along to use in patchin up the runner once anyhow that a saphead fooled him
peters shuffled his way to a point beyond the overhang then paused to tie the strips of cloth around the skis knot side down
this maneuver would help to keep him from sliding backward
he flashed an upward look at the difficult grade he was to negotiate
if his heart failed him for a moment because of his useless arm and the shock his whole body had suffered because of the wound it only resulted in letting him get a firmer grip on his resolution and strength
the wound was nothing serious being merely a clean gash through the fleshy part of the forearm
he would not allow it to endanger the success of his nights exploit
markham must be made to suffer for his lawlessness and it was up to peters to see that he did not escape
the first easy slopes of the butte were taken just as one might travel over level forward movement in long gliding steps
the skis were merely advanced never lifted
as the ascent stiffened peters turned out the ends of the runners slightly in what is known as the half fishbone step
there was a trick in this and peters had long since acquired it
steeper and steeper became the course as the snowy slope was climbed and the full fishbone step was gradually brought into requisition
for such a long ascent the work was extremely tiring and peters was forced to do a number of serpentines tacking back and forth and executing the difficult about face at each turn
a good deal of time was required in making the climb but peters handicap of awkwardness had taught him how to be patient and doggedly resolute in carrying out his aims
he kept unflinchingly to his tiresome task and in due course was rewarded by finding himself on the flat crest of bear butte ready for the long glissade
by this time his sporting blood was aroused and he looked forward with keen enjoyment to the breathlessly swift glide that lay ahead of him
he rested a few moments tucked the hand of his injured arm into the front of his coat removed the knotted strips from the runners took firm hold of the ski stick and then let himself over the buttes crest
with skis so close together that they touched the point of one leading the other by a foot body not bent but inclined forward peters was off down the steep slope like a bullet out of a gun
he was at a disadvantage in not having both hands for use with the stick
where it was necessary to brake and avoid a small crevasse or a bowlder peters did it entirely with the skis by executing the telemark swing
it was not often that he was confronted by such an emergency but he was proficient in that method of dodging possible disaster and unhesitatingly availed himself of it
at lightning speed he shot down the butte the air humming in his ears and snowy particles stinging his face
his exhilaration mounted higher and higher
in his delight over the coasting he forgot the stolen horses the treachery of markham and the reprisal he was counting upon when he should reach roscommon
his every faculty was called into play and busied itself with the flying skis to the exclusion of everything else
the slope flattened and peters speed lessened perceptibly although he was still going at a rate comparable to that of a limited express train
on and on mile after mile his sensation was that of one falling through space
he scarcely realized that he had any connection whatever with the whiteclad earth beneath him
at last in the distance he saw a twinkling light and a confused blur of buildings
roscommon
the town jumped toward him as though crazily bent on fouling his course
he gave rather more attention to roscommon than to the slope ahead of him and suddenly he pitched into the air as the runners hit an obstacle
he fell with the skis braided around his neck fell hard upon the cleared tracks of the roscommon railroad yards and so suddenly that he had no time to realize he had gone over the embankment at the side of the network of rails
instinctively he tried to lift himself only to drop in an awkward huddle with a blaze of shooting stars crisscrossing before his eyes
then the bright lights faded and nixon peters quietly went to sleep
when peters awoke he found himself on a bench in the railroad station
a local train was expected and there had been men on the station platform when peters shot over the railroad embankment and hit the tracks
three or four of the men went forward to investigate the strange phenomenon and they were the ones who had brought peters into the waiting room
they had no more than laid him down and stripped off his skis when he opened his eyes
sheriff gone to the dry wash yet he inquired faintly
a man bent over him
jordan the sheriff said he
what dry wash do you mean
why should i go there
markham reached town went on peters seen a thing of markham
oh
jordan exclaimed know you now
you are man peters from the morton ranch
why were you sliding into town at this time o night on a pair of skis
thunder
it was as much as your life was worth
you gang of horse thieves ran off our fifty of em cut in peters wildly
it happened early in the evening
get a posse jordan and head off the gang at long knife dry wash
when markham shows up leave somebody in town to arrest him
he shot me in the arm
and send a doctor to to look after bailey wounded too
then peters went to sleep again
when he next came to himself and picked up the chain of events he was in a bed in a room at the roscommon house
broad day looked in at the room windows and peters could gaze dreamily out at roofs covered with snow and sparkling under the suns rays as though covered with diamonds
hours had passed since he had had the brief awakening in the railroad station
now he was in a comfortable bed his left arm neatly bandaged and toynbee the proprietor of the hotel was sitting beside him
did they get markham toynbee asked peters
the landlord was reading a newspaper
he jumped in his chair as the unexpected words reached him from the bed
oh youre back eh said he been a long time on the road although the doctor said we neednot to mind
get markham
well i guess
and toynbee chuckled
jordan got him and four others along with the stolen horses
they were pushing through the dry wash when the sheriff and his party arrived there
you bet they got him peters and redhanded at that
big surprise to everybody
why markham had put the whole thing up
he was back of the entire scheme
it has all come out
markham wonot talk but the rest of the gang feel different
across the line there were men waiting to take the horses and rush em off where theyd never be found
say
i guess you ought to have a medal for what you did last night
how are you feeling anyhow
peters was stunned
porter markham one of the horse thieves
could peters believe his ears
markham had had a reason for driving the horses off their feet on the return from lake
with all the other stock taken from it had been plan to make the sleigh team useless so far as a drive of twenty miles to roscommon with news for the sheriff was concerned and markham had protested against peters plan of using skates in carrying an alarm to roscommon but when the method had been put into effect in spite of him markham had taken to the skis and had waylaid peters at the eastern foot of bear butte
in the light of recent events the motive for that attack could be seen at an even more treacherous angle scheme was not to beat peters to roscommon with news for the sheriff but to keep all knowledge of the robbery from the authorities until the stolen horses had been delivered across the line
instead of making for the town after securing peters skates markham had followed the river bends beyond the town to a point where he could join his rascally confederates with the horse herd
how do you feel peters repeated toynbee after waiting a long time for a reply
mighty nigh locoed said peters
no wonder
say you hit the railroad iron with your head when you went over the embankment
any other head but yours would probably have been cracked
you canot crack a saphead commented peters but not in bitterness
next day when peters was thinking of getting out of his bed and helping drive the horses back to the ranch no less a person than uncle silas goddard walked into his room
uncle silas was an irongray man big and broad and with a regular heart under his ribs
he had received a telegram signed reece bailey per morton and had come to north dakota by first train
there were greetings not those of a pleased employer for a worthy employee but more in line with what ones next of kin might say in circumstances altogether creditable
bailey was coming fine and would be on the job again in two or three weeks and peters the doctor said would be fit as a fiddle in seven days at the outside
the horses were on the way back to what about markham queried peters
uncle silas cheery face grew troubled
well markham was only a boy and a very foolish one
he had had a hard lesson
no stock had been lost and uncle silas felt that he ought not to be too hard on markham
he was going to let markham go on a promise to leave the country and make something of himself in other parts
any one at all acquainted with uncle silas might have known he would do that very thing
as for you nixon the big ranchowner went on a job waiting in montana for a chap of your heft and disposition
but do you want to return to the home ranch he asked quizzically
miss hesther morton sends a very kindly message to you by me
she is sorry for a lot of things she says and hopes to see you right soon
but nixon peters had seen another light
he recalled his saphead dreams of rescuing hesther from a burning house and the shamed red stained his cheeks to the towcolored hair
miss morton all at once is wasting her consideration on the wrong party
uncle silas said peters for montana as soon as you want me there
good exclaimed uncle silas and clasped peters hand with a fervor that suggested not only good will but hearty congratulations
