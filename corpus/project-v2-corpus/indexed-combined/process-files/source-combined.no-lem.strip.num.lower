who makes the mistake,14183
how is the mistake made,14184
what is the person object or situation erroneously thought to be,14185
what bearing does this have on a crisis in which the principal character finds himself,14186
who is the person with the guilty conscience,14187
of what does he know himself to be guilty,14188
what does he fear from exposure,14189
in this robot outline no stretch of the imagination is necessary to associate together logically the locale and the principal character by the animal trainer making an appearance behind the footlights in either a circus or theater,14190
let us make this a circus story,14191
the fact that some one is deprived of justice as stated in the crisis suggests that one of the important characters perhaps the animal trainer is a fugitive from justice or has been accused of something of which he or she is innocent and that some other character is using a knowledge of this for blackmail purposes,14192
under the head of method an appeal is made to the underworld and some one who is also motivated with a desire to frighten an enemy,14193
of the many interpretations possible in this situation one might be that the animal trainer is a woman who in some manner has been previously connected with the underworld and who has escaped its toils and who is now being pursued by a man,14194
in fact we might as well impregnate the entire story with an underworld flavor and give it the following development,14195
a beautiful young woman who has been the sweetheart of a gangster has decided to desert the underworld and return to her profession which was that of an animal trainer,14196
she obtains a position with the circus and is pursued by the gangster who is madly infatuated with her,14197
she refuses to have anything further to do with him,14198
in the meantime in order to frighten him into leaving her alone she threatens to have him arrested for a murder which has been committed by the gang,14199
this greatly enrages him and he returns to his gang and they discuss taking her for a ride because she knows too much,14200
finally it is decided that a better plan is to hang the crime on her which they proceed to do,14201
in the meantime they line up with a crooked prosecutor or other official who is in league with them and the girl is arrested in the midst of a performance and charged with murder,14202
now we come to the climax or surprise twist,14203
during the process of the trial and when the gangster is on the witness stand he sees the man whom he thought he himself had killed and for whose murder he is trying to have the girl convicted,14204
thinking it to be a case of the dead coming to life he loses his nerve and becomes so excited that he confesses the murder himself,14205
the man in the audience is the long lost twin of the man who was murdered and he has unexpectedly appeared on the scene,14206
the end,14207
here we have a surprise twist and a trick ending,14208
by reserving the fact that the murdered man had a twin we provide ourselves with a trick ending and by having a character do something unexpected at or near the end of the story we have the desired surprise twist,14209
another way to have accomplished the same purpose would have been to have a male member of the circus one who loves the girl and who was a clever makeup artist disguise himself so as to look exactly like the murdered man and then appear in courtroom at the psychological moment,14210
the only trouble about this latter suggestion would be that it would probably introduce too much material for a shortshort story because it would be necessary to devote some attention to the romance between the couple,14211
i can see that by using this treatment the story could be developed into a ten thousand word story or more,14212
my reader will of course understand that this is only one of scores of shortshort story plots that could be evolved from outline number of the even numbers and it was developed in less than fifteen minutes,14213
now let us select one of the number outlines and develop a plot in which there is no melodrama,14214
let us also take number from this list,14215
the questions which we would ask ourselves might be as follows where is the cabaret located,14216
what is the husband doing in the cabaret,14217
whose husband is he,14218
what is his profession,14219
who is the loved one whose soul is to be saved,14220
in what way is the soul about to be saved,14221
how is it proposed to save the soul,14222
is the lost soul a man or a woman,14223
is the lost soul any relation to the husband,14224
what relation,14225
who is possessed of false pride,14226
who makes the pathetic effort to eclipse another,14227
in what way is the effort made,14228
who is the other one,14229
why is the effort pathetic,14230
what kind of a mistake is about to be made on account of a dream,14231
who is about to make the mistake,14232
who is the dreamer,14233
what was the dream,14234
how could a dream cause the mistake,14235
how does a little child bring about a reconciliation,14236
between whom is a reconciliation affected,14237
what has been the cause of the rift between the parties who become reconciled,14238
what relation is the child to the parties who become reconciled,14239
is the husband one of the parties who become reconciled,14240
if so with whom does he become reconciled,14241
is the child any relation to the husband,14242
if so what,14243
a young woman who has been a dancer becomes the wife of a more or less prosaic or commonplace husband whose position some time later places him in contact with a radio station,14244
it is discovered that he has natural ability as a singer,14245
he is given few tryouts takes training and soon becomes a star baritone,14246
the couple have a little girl three or four years old and being the wife of a star whose time and attention are largely monopolized by other people soon becomes burdensome to the wife,14247
having been a dancer she has some professional ambition which never forsakes her and she takes seriously the remarks made by some of her friends about the attention paid to her husband by other women,14248
professional engagements take the husband away for a time and the wife places the little girl in the care of a friend and resolves to make a name for herself in the professional world,14249
the first opportunity that presents itself is in a night club,14250
the husband returns and is shocked,14251
he goes to the night club and please with her to give up the idea and she proudly refuses,14252
he sees that she is in an atmosphere that may prove to be ruinous,14253
she can think of nothing but her consuming ambition to become his equal professionally or to perhaps eclipse him,14254
he tells her that she is going to the devil,14255
this results in an estrangement,14256
for a time he makes veiled appeals to her over the radio as he sings to his audience,14257
she gets the message but does not heed them,14258
then comes a time when he in the broadcasting studio hears the announcer describe an accident to an unidentified child who has been run down by an automobile and he recognizes it as his own,14259
in the midst of a gay number at the cabaret she hears the same announcement and with a cry dashes from the stage,14260
the two meet at the bedside of the injured tot at the hospital and silently pray for her life,14261
the child hovers between life and death for days during which time all misunderstanding between the mother and the father are melted away and when the child recovers consciousness she sees them in each others arms,14262
when the father asks the little one how she came to run away and be injured she replies dreamed the devil was after my mama and i was going down to get her,14263
the end,14264
it is more difficult to write a heart interest drama than it is a melodrama and even though this little story appears to have less plot in it than the other one more mental effort has been required to write it as to include the necessary heart interest and pathos as well as the dramatic punch at the end,14265
attention is directed here to the difference between the trick ending or surprise twist which is found in the other story and the dramatic punch or heart throb which we have at the end of this one,14266
here we have not purposely reserved any pertinent facts introduced misleading dialogue or had any character do some unexpected thing at the last minute in order to provide the trick ending or surprise twist,14267
instead we have simply used the childs statement of her dream about her mother as the climax,14268
there is heart interest in this for the reason that it emphasizes the love of the child for her mother and establishes the fact that she has perhaps overhead the fathers statement that the mother is going to the devil and has taken it seriously,14269
to have introduced the statement of the child earlier in the story would have been to have lost the dramatic punch and heart interest climax at the end,14270
all of which goes to show that the way in which one tells the story is as important as the story itself,14271
right here it might be well to emphasize the fact that the plot genie is not designed to supply the continuity for a story but merely a plot outline,14272
in other words it is not necessary that the introduction of story elements appear in the same order or even a similar order in the finished story as they do in the plot outline,14273
the genie is intended to supply the plot and then the author can tell the story in any manner desired,14274
one must first have a story before he can tell it however and to supply this story is the purpose of the plot genie,14275

importance of literary style were it not for the clever literary style employed in the writing of a great many shortshort stories which have been accepted and published they would have qualified as ordinary shortstories only,15156
what is meant by this is that great many clever writers have taken what would otherwise have been an ordinary shortstory and by either purposely misleading the reader with dialogue which has a double meaning or by withholding important facts until the last paragraph they have made it into a shortshort story,15157
in other words they have given it what we call the trick ending which is a big dramatic punch or surprise to the reader,15158
in some of the shortshort stories which have been accepted and published the reader is even left in a quandary and is required to supply his own interpretation at the end,15159
in others he is left in a serious and reflective mood with a wealth of food for thought,15160
in practically all of them which are written according to formula there is a surprise in the last paragraph,15161
the majority of those which have been accepted and published are literary gems or have distinctive features about them which lift them out of the ordinary,15162
i will enumerate a few of these features in order to make myself clear,15163
they are in which the dialogue is so clever that it elicits a chuckle or an outright laugh,15164
for example the last two paragraphs in the killer a story written by arthur munion and published in september a thumbnail synopsis of which is number16 on page the closing paragraphs are as follows where he wanted to know did you get that wallop,15165
that,15166
oh that,15167
armstrong assumed a worried look temper he whispered,15168
beastly thing baskerville,15169
ugh,15170
i see red,15171
forget human,15172
growl like a wolf,15173
likely as not to tear a man to ribbons when what going baskerville,15174
well any other time you know,15175
in which the dialogue is so cleverly written that it portrays a character so clearly that one can almost feel he has known the person,15176
for example in the story pearls written by philip wylie and published in october 5m the following paragraphs appear mr bland eyes became more lifeless and opaque,15177
he said quite,15178
throckmorton of taine stared at the ceiling thought with three months you could er assemble something decent,15179
about er say eighty thousand pounds what,15180
mr bradleys fingers lifter and fell,15181
quite he repeated,15182
the thumbnail synopsis of this story is number and appears on page in which the description is so wellworded that one is immediately transported into the atmosphere of the story as in the case of helping hand by morton thompson which appeared in the october issue of and the thumbnail synopsis of which is number on page of this index,15183
this is exemplified by the following paragraph here was her freedom in the magic city,15184
and she had no hob,15185
no money no friends no earthly chance of earning any,15186
a chill must blew in from the battery,15187
thin soupy rain followed,15188
the author of this story also reserved a terrific dramatic punch for the very last line wherein he tells us that what was found crumpled in the hand of the suicide victim was the fivedollar bill that he had given her and that it was a counterfeit thereby leaving great latitude for speculation,15189
in which the story gets under way so speedily that the interest of the reader is immediately seized in an iron grip with the result that it is impossible to lay down the magazine without reading the story through,15190
an example of this will be found in taken for a ride thumbnail synopsis number on page of index and of which the following paragraphs are an illustration,15191
jennings was being taken for a ride,15192
a man sat beside him on the front seat of his car with a gun pressed against his ribs,15193
the gun was in the mans pocket and was held in his left hand,15194
jennings didnot feel that he had ever done any harm to anybody,15195
true he as a bootlegger but he was only a little one and tried not to sell any poison stuff,15196
this story was written by william ford and this clever author not only gets his story under way at the top speed in the first two paragraphs but introduces his main characters in that space also,15197
in which the action of the character is so cleverly described that he is made to live and breathe and to be so human that the illusion of knowing him is perfect,15198
as in the story one strong thing from the june issue of written by carrie tibbets thumbnail synopsis number on page 109of index the following paragraphs illustrates ruth stood for a moment looking down at her husband,15199
he looked at her with the eyes of a beaten dog and the grin of a satyr,15200
she dropped quietly to her knees and began unlacing his shoes,15201
there is also a pathetic punch in this paragraph as it describes the actions of a wife who has decided to desert her husband because of his drinking and how her love triumphs over the decision when he comes in a drunk again,15202
wherein in just a few words an author tells a whole story so cleverly that the reader sees in retrospect perhaps what has required years to develop in the life of a character,15203
an example of this is contained in the story entitle have said goodbye by philip duganne in the july issue of thumbnail synopsis number on page of index,15204
i refer to the following paragraph,15205
emmy was a coward,15206
thirteen years in the state orphanage before old caleb ryder took her out to do the housework which his wife could not attend to from her grave and five years of bullying were not the stuff to make courage,15207
this story also contains a number of other very clever paragraphs descriptive of action and atmosphere,15208
we can see the characters in the story move about as if in real life or on the talking picture screen as we read the following paragraph from the same story,15209
they searched until sundown the house the barn the ground,15210
the sear leaves of the cornstalks rustled ominously as men moved among them and the drunken scarecrows witnesses if there had been a crime to the scene flapped their strawstuffed sleeves in the wind as though they shook with dreadful laughter,15211
in which the author has very cleverly described in just a few words at the end of his story retrospective action or events which explain everything and leave the reader aghast,15212
an illustration of this is contained in the story the perfect murder,15213
thumbnail synopsis number on page written by roy mangum and published in of april following is a paragraph but then willowville folks donot known to this day that emily holden was mark daughter that mark had never been married and that old man fellows was the only human being on earth who knew those things,15214
in which the author has converted into a shortshort story what would have been an ordinary shortstory by opening up his action at the most interesting point of the narrative and then five or six paragraphs later describing in retrospect previous events which would have been uninteresting reading,15215
this was aptly illustrated in love em and written by john franklin fellows and published in on august 15th,15216
thumbnail synopsis number page index,15217
his opening paragraph which immediately seizes interest was as follows it was not until the brig west away had been at sea three days that spud martin got his chance to kill jack wilton,15218
but all the breaks were with him now spud thought grimly even the fact that jack and he had been watch mates for six years,15219
the retrospect which would have been a very uninteresting opening is contained in the following paragraph which appeared a little more than half way down the first column,15220
for six years spud martin and jack wilton had been watch mates,15221
for six years they had spent their hours ashore in the same haunts and for six years they had shared their confidences and ideas,15222
and spud with the admiration which the more homely and cautious of two intimates always show for the other had studied jack until he knew him better than he did himself,15223
that was why spud knew what attitude toward elsie saunders must be even though jack had become taciturn and avoided looking spud in the eye,15224
all the way through these shortshort stories one finds beautifully written lines which aptly describes atmosphere action and character,15225
the following are a few examples the old woman looked like a piece of crumpled brown wax lying there against a high ruffled pillow,15226
the doctor picked up the scalpel,15227
he nodded to the curlyhaired nurse,15228
she placed the cone back on face,15229
drip,15230
drip,15231
dip,15232
but she didnot hear what he was saying for intuitively she placed that tone,15233
it struck the cunning note of the conversationally intimate,15234
gingerly he seated himself upon the straight chair beside the desk and even as he did so the smiling mask dropped from face,15235
the dismal spectre bowed again settled himself wearily upon the cushions and placed the tin box between us,15236
how could i know,15237
what does any woman know about the man she marries,15238
she begins with faith she continues with hope and unless she divorces him she stays by him through charity,15239
philosophy well put,15240
some successful shortshort stories the publishers of magazine have very kindly given their permission to reprint in full several of the shortshort stories which have been purchased by them and published and which provide excellent examples of clever plot construction treatment description dialogue or literary style,15241
in practically every shortshort story there has been displayed by the author an outstanding cleverness in one of these features and that is what lifts the story out of the class of the ordinary shortstory into that of the shortshort,15242
the following is a story which was published in on august and one of those which i have selected as an example,15243
by john franklin fellows,15244
it was not until the brig west away had been at sea three days that spud martin got his chance to kills jack wilton,15245
but all the breaks were with him now spud thought grimly even the fact that jack and he had been watch mates for six years,15246
it was nearly dark and the west away was running into a blow off sable island,15247
shorten sail had been the order and spud martin and jack wilton were on the yard furling the main sail,15248
the rest of the crew were at their own stations,15249
there would be no one to see the cause of the accident no one to prevent its inevitable result,15250
spud usually good natured face looked strained and his short stocky muscles worked jerkily as he furled the sail to windward and studied jack who was down to leeward furling his side,15251
a handsome lad jack was spud thought but hed look different after hed crashed to the deck seventyfive feet below,15252
spud martin pulled his sheath knife and severed the lashing which held the foot rope to the jackstay on his side of the yardarm,15253
holding the foot rope in his hands he watched bleakly as jack wilton began working his way in,15254
and the closer jack came the greater grew the strain on the rope in hands,15255
spud would have to let go shortly or be catapulted from the yard himself,15256
for six years spud martin and jack wilton had been watch mates,15257
for six years they had spent their hours ashore in the same haunts and for six years they had shared their confidences and ideas,15258
and spud with the admiration which the more homely and cautious of two intimates always shows for the other had studied jack until he knew him better than he did himself,15259
that was why spud knew what attitude toward elsie saunders must be even though jack had become taciturn and avoided looking spud in the eye,15260
elsie saunders was a hostess at the royal palm dance palace on st bedolf street in boston,15261
spud had taken one look at her and bought all her dance tickets for the rest of the evening,15262
slim and undeniably graceful with wideset blue eyes and flaxen curly hair she seemed an angel to spud,15263
and in the next few evenings spud did his best to prove that he was well made of better stuff than his unprepossessing exterior indicated he was,15264
at any rate spud looked forward to seeing her after his next voyage,15265
of course he didnot mention this unusual fidelity to his watch mate,15266
he knew jack too well,15267
love em and leave em,15268
jack would say scornfully if not too originally,15269
that was jack a reckless and handsome devil who could get away with it,15270
and because spud had never found a girl worth hanging on to he had agreed with jack,15271
it was different though when spud met elsie,15272
unfortunately on his next arrival in port it fell to spud to stand the anchor watch while the rest of the crew went ashore in the longboat,15273
and when spud finally got to the royal palms dance palace late that night he found jack dancing with elsie saunders,15274
spud did not blame elsie for the obvious fact that she had fallen for jack,15275
who would give a gorilla like himself a second look when jack was about,15276
nor did he blame jack for cutting in on him,15277
jack had always grabbed the best girl he saw even if spud had dated her first,15278
it had not matter much before,15279
and what was to become of the girls jack had loved and left hadnot mattered either,15280
but elsie the two watch mates had gone to sea again and spud had tried for three days to convince himself that love em and leave em went for elsie as well as any other girl,15281
he might have succeeded in convincing himself if jack too had seemed to realize that elsie was different if jack hadnot avoided looking his former chum in the eyes,15282
but spud had failed and jack would pay now,15283
in spite of his straining hands spud felt the rope sag beneath weight,15284
he saw the catlike nervousness with which jack balanced himself,15285
jack was scared,15286
and spud grinned mirthlessly as eyes looked into his own for the first time in three days,15287
you ainot lost your nerve jack,15288
spud asked his voice harshly derisive above the sound of the wind in the rigging,15289
jack nodded in the affirmative and grinned wryly,15290
with good reason too he said something been afraid to tell yuh,15291
spud felt the rope biting into his calloused hands,15292
he could hold but a moment longer,15293
what is it he asked indifferently,15294
that after all the braggin i done about lovin em and leavin em jack blurted out went and done it,15295
i got hitched,15296
spud felt numb,15297
so that was why jack had been afraid to look him in the eye,15298
come in quick he grated,15299
jack startled at the harsh command obeyed it instantly automatically,15300
and as he sprang to the lee rigging releasing the strain on the foot rope the foot rope snapped taut,15301
the sudden jerk threw spud from the yard,15302
be good to her,15303
spud yelled as he hurtled toward the deck below,15304
the end,15305
tis is one of the best examples i have ever seen where by exercising clever judgment in the point of attack or in the manner of opening the story the author has immediately aroused the interest of the reader in what would probably have been an uninteresting story if treated differently,15306
you will note that mr fellows with his opening paragraph has jumped right into the action which immediately precedes the climax,15307
the average inexperienced author and a great many who are not inexperienced would have begun the story with the later paragraph which is indicated by indentation and would have probably lost a sale,15308
in this story the author first establishes a highly dramatic situation by telling you in the first five lines that one of his characters is out to kill the other one thereby also establishing a strong thread of suspense and creating in your mind a desire to know the whys and wherefores or what it is all about,15309
then eight paragraphs later he describes in less than one hundred words the events leading up to the crisis with which he opens the story and presents the entire background and complication at the same time giving you a history of his characters,15310
the plot in this story is very ordinary being nothing more than a situation in which a jealous rival sacrifices himself for the benefit of another man who has a better right to the girl,15311
the climax is not particularly strong nor novel,15312
it was no doubt the authors manner of telling the story in such a way as to immediately seize the interest of the reader and hold it that resulted in the sale of this story to the next published shortshort from which is outstanding and calls for favorable comment was published on may it follows by guy gilpatric we pulled into lyon at about midnight and found that we had twenty minutes to wait,15313
beth said she felt hungry so i walked along the platform to one of those little white enameled pushcart buffets that they have in the french railroad stations and bought a jar of meat pate some fresh flaky rolls and a demi of burgundy,15314
i was just paying for these when i saw a switch locomotive shunting a flat car into the shed and coupling it to the rear of our train,15315
on this flat car lashed by the wheels was a shiny black wagon such as is used by undertakers when they call around at the house to pick up a job,15316
sitting under this wagon were two gendarmes huddled in their cloaks and smoking cigarettes,15317
i called the buffet boys attention,15318
oh,15319
why that is monsieur black wagon he exclaimed,15320
do you know what is inside that wagon monsieur,15321
it is the bois de justice the guillotine,15322
there was an execution here this morning and now they are taking it back to paris,15323
but buy a paper monsieur and you will read,15324
i bought and having taken the paper and the food back to the compartment i started to read aloud,15325
ugh,15326
beth interrupted before i was half through,15327
if you must read such horrors read them to yourself,15328
i am trying to eat,15329
please,15330
it wasnot the sort of thing to give one an appetite at that,15331
a certain madame lubet who had paid the plenty of her crime at fourteen minutes after five that morning,15332
monsieur deibler who it appeared always attends to these little matters for the republic had arrived from paris with the official guillotine the night before and had set it up on the cobblestones in the prison yard,15333
now in doing this said the journal monsieur deibler had been gravely at fault,15334
for when the struggling victim was lashed to the table the apparatus had shifted just enough on the uneven cobbles to cause the knife to jam at well at an awkward point,15335
thus the job was not exactly neat in fact its completion had required a certain amount of hand work by monsieur deibler,15336
it is deplorable the newspaper declared that the horrors of capital punishment should thus be increased by the blunders of the callous ghouls who are paid to inflict it,15337
we respectfully petition the minister of justice to dismiss the man deibler from the service of the state,15338
the train was clicking across the switches out of the yards,15339
a shadow fell across us,15340
we turned and saw a cadaverous figure standing in the door a man who wore a long black cloak and who carried beneath his arm a black tin case about the size and shape of a hatbox,15341
he bowed low,15342
pardon he said and his voice was a hoarse croak,15343
if i may intrude i will avail myself of this vacant place,15344
there was nothing for me to say so i merely nodded and waved my hand toward the seat beside me,15345
the dismal specter bowed again settled himself wearily upon the cushions and placed the tin box between us,15346
i glanced at beth,15347
she was leaning forward from her place in the corner staring at the thin ivoryyellow countenance of the newcomer,15348
i caught her eye,15349
she inclined her head slightly and moved her lips,15350
no sound came from them but i knew she was saying deibler,15351
i had no doubt of course that she was right,15352
here sitting beside us in the compartment was the headsman of france he who had this very morning completed with his own man the gruesome job which his apparatus had bungled,15353
an unpleasant odor became vaguely perceptible an odor as of cheap perfume mixed with a chemical disinfectant,15354
i had never smelled any embalming fluid and yet i recognized it at once,15355
i wondered and yet was afraid to wonder what was in that tin box,15356
monsieur deibler sighed sepulchrally and commenced jotting something in a notebook which he rested upon his bony knee,15357
he seemed to be drawing curves and lines,15358
i glanced surreptitiously over his shoulder,15359
what he had drawn was profile view of a womans head with dotted lines crossing the neck and skull,15360
he studied this diagram in solemn silence and at length,15361
then sighing once more he thrust the notebook into his pocket and turned to me,15362
monsieur he said pardon the liberty which i take in addressing you,15363
but today monsieur i have had great misfortune,15364
my career will be ruined,15365
i ask you monsieur did you see this evenings paper,15366
the er legal news,15367
yes i answered did see it monsieur,15368
ah he said,15369
then you have guessed to what i refer,15370
it is not a matter which ordinarily i would mention before strangers and he bowed to beth and smiled a wolfish smile before a charming lady,15371
i donot know exactly what i said but in any case fault if there was a fault was with the apparatus he continued,15372
the affair was entirely beyond human control,15373
harsh things have been said about me by those in important circles,15374
the name even of the minister of justice has been invoked,15375
well too can appeal to monsieur the minister,15376
with what i have here,15377
he patted the tin case and chuckled sardonically,15378
i shuddered and edged away from him along the seat,15379
in the box monsieur,15380
i exclaimed recoiling,15381
you have it in the box,15382
ah pray put it out in the corridor,15383
oh no indeed he demurred,15384
it is so precious that i do not want it out of my sight,15385
people are saying that i was forced to cut away er cut away what was left by hand,15386
but with the contents of this box monsieur i hope to be able to convince both the medical authorities and the officials of justice that all such talk is rankest calumny,15387
but see monsieur,15388
he unsnapped a catch and threw open the top of the box,15389
there with lips purple cheeks waxen eyes glassy and its hair a tangled mass of black reposed a head,15390
i heard beth give that little whispery cry that always means she is about to faint,15391
things went against me today but now i will appeal to the highest tribunal croaked the headsman will set up my apparatus in court and demonstrate that it could not possibly be as the witnesses and the newspaper have said,15392
yes pierre auguste renoir giraudy the greatest hairdresser in france will prove with this model that suzette valier who claims seventy thousand francs damages because my permanent waving machine burned off her hair is a liar,15393
one of the first things that impresses the reader of this story is that the author has traveled and knows his locale,15394
his description of french atmosphere is so perfect that the reader is immediately transported into the realm of the story,15395
following this we are immediately interested when he starts to describe gruesome details of an execution by guillotine which has taken place that morning thereby planting the events or setting the stage for what it is to follow,15396
the outstanding feature of this story is the clever manipulation of dialogue and description in such a way as to totally mislead the reader or rather to cause the reader to mislead himself by forming the wrong conclusions which by the way are very natural in this case,15397
in this story not only is the reader fooled but so are the two main characters all being lead to believe that the eccentric hair dresser is none other than the equally unusual executioner and that the tin box contained the gruesome severed head of the executed woman,15398
in looking back over this story after experiencing the surprise shock and consequent relief in the last paragraph one cannot find a single instance of where the author has practiced any fraud on the reader,15399
every bit of dialogue action and description is logical and can be accounted for,15400
of course the whole story is based on coincidence of the strangest kind but not upon something that could not happen,15401
as a shortshort story with a surprise twist ending this is a masterpiece,15402
the next one which i will analyze was written by a woman and is highlighted with clever and sophisticated description and dialogue throughout besides having a stinger in the last line,15403
this story was published in on april and follows by roberta yates glad to see you ellen,15404
of course i am,15405
but i i wish you hadnot come to new york,15406
julie andrews looked at her kid sister with troubled eyes,15407
ellen looked back with the clear laughing eyes of eighteen,15408

she looked at frock which bore the stamp of paris,15421
you know sis it surprised me when you made good in new york awfully clever to manage all this on a hundred a week and send money home too,15422
i manage,15423

well youve made your mint,15433

and i suppose hes for me,15438
oh you bum,15439
ellen had a grand evening,15440
she gushed and squealed but now and then her bright eyes rested thoughtfully on whitney randolph,15441
she liked him,15442
oh a lot,15443
who wouldnot,15444
he had moviestar looks lean and brown with a crinkly grin,15445
but she didnot like his possessive attitude toward julie,15446
and julie well she let him get away with it,15447
wallie langford was a drab young man,15448
ellen paid him little attention until she saw him looking at julie like a dog who yearns for a pat but expects a kick out of luck ellen murmured both in love with julie,15449
but whit holds the aces wally said,15450
when julie and ellen were alone together ellen said crazy about whitney randolph arenot you like him julie said guardedly,15451
are you engaged to him,15452
no,15453
oh no lips tightened,15454
his mother wouldnot let him marry me a snooty dowager,15455
the poor worm,15456
ellen stormed he the nerve to marry without his mothers permission,15457
and wherell he find a gorgeouser girl than you take it so hard ellen,15458
julie tried to be light,15459
julie you oughtnot to let him thinks he owns you,15460
julie went scarlet,15461

i heard wallie langford ask you to dinner tomorrow night,15463
why donot you go,15464
wally bores me,15465
whit is going to a debutante dance show him go julie said,15466
on the next evening julie departed with a wallie who was dazed by his good luck,15467
when the door closed behind them ellen sprang to the telephone,15468
she gave the number of whitney club and waited nervously while he was paged,15469
hello he said,15470
she spoke in a breathless squeak,15471
this is ellen sister,15472
oh mr randolph can you come over at once something wrong,15473
i canot tell you over the telephone,15474
when whitney randolph arrived she was still breathless know i shouldnot butt into affairs but i know she loves you,15475
i canot imagine what makes her do such a thing though i guess every girl wants to get married,15476
what are you talking about telling you,15477
about julie marrying wallie langford been asking her to for ages but she wouldnot because she loves you,15478
then she got to thinking what would happen to her when you married a debutante,15479
so wallie and she went to greenwich to have dinner but really to get married,15480
let me get this whitney randolph said hoarsely,15481
julie eloped with wallie langford,15482
ellen are you crazy tell you she did know that road house wallie goes to in greenwich whitney said,15483
can you stop them,15484
ellen was talking to air,15485
whitney had gone,15486
she picked up a book and began to read it calmly but now and again she looked at the clock,15487
at eleven the telephone rang,15488
central said that greenwich connecticut was calling voice came shrill with excitement,15489
ellen married,15490
who to,15491
why to whitney of course,15492
so he did fall for it ellen said,15493
julie didnot hear her,15494
he dashed in and accused wallie of eloping with me,15495
poor wallie was so surprised,15496
then whit literally dragged me out by the hair,15497
he said he didnot give a hoot what his mother said,15498

congratulations said the kid sister be getting back to freesburg now that youre fixed up,15500
any darned fool could tell from your letters home that you werenot happy darling so i came along to help always a way to get your man,15501
ellen rang off,15502
even if youre idiot enough to be his mistress first she added,15503
observe how this author establishes the contrasting characters of these sisters in two paragraphs of less than fifty words,15504
both are intensely human and just exactly like girls we all know although they are so different from each other,15505
study the second paragraph which is indented and just observe the dramatic complication that is suggested by thus author in a bit of dialogue between the two girls,15506
we do not have to be told that the older one is involved,15507
then look at the way she builds up her characters in those five words ellen gave her an athletic hug,15508
miss yates sets her stage and moves her characters about with a vim and snap that is refreshing,15509
she does it with a few words in the paragraphs a sentences which are intended and set in black,15510
the author then stands you on your head figuratively speaking with a last line that takes your breath wow what a stinger and something to think about,15511
this is one of those six methods of supplying the surprise or trick ending wherein facts which are pertinent to the story are purposely withheld to supply the necessary punch in the last paragraph,15512
number four which follows and which was one of the first shortshorts to be published in is outstanding because of two features,15513
it appeared in the october issue a by morton thompson it was only a week before her last ten cents had gone for carfare and left her stranded in a downtown park,15514
around were vague tall buildings crowds scurried back and forth in front of her,15515
a man stopped to speak and she looked at him so dully he moved away abashed,15516
the small figure in the cheap crushed hat the wrinkled coarse clothing drooped,15517
here was money moving around her here were people working eating sleeping all with cares and happiness of their own,15518
working in clean offices in bedlams of department stores,15519
here was her freedom in the magic city,15520
and she had no job,15521
no money no friends no earthly chance of earning any,15522
a chill mist blew in from the battery,15523
thin soupy rain followed,15524
through it all disappointment glued her to the bench motionless,15525
she had long since forgotten to cry,15526
a man came through the park,15527
his thin coat was buttoned close against the souldissolving moisture a young man in poor clothing and with a tired face,15528
he saw the girl,15529
there was something so arresting in the sight of her sitting on the bench alone in the dark so heedless of the rain beating down on her that he quickened his steps and planted himself before her the matter girlie,15530
she raised a dull hopeless face,15531
there was no vestige of anything left upon it but hopelessness,15532
he sat down beside her and forgot the weather happened to you,15533
you look as if youd lost your last friend never had no friends,15534
the words moved quickly,15535
they were unstressed,15536
aw say,15537
come on now you donot mean that,15538
he pit his arm around her,15539
at the touch she gave way sobbed and sobbed gasping noises in an incoherent jumble of words that told the same old old story,15540
the narrow home life in the narrow upstate town and the ultimate flight to the big city to show them,15541
money going going gone at last,15542
unknown jostled by the crowds and the bigness and the final decision that all mens hands were against her,15543
and so i come here and almost finished the course in the night school and i was goin to get away from that lousy factory and they laughed at me all of them did an an now lookit me,15544
he pointed to a row of newspaper buildings at one end of the park work there the address,15545
come there tomorrow and get you a job,15546
aw mister you donot mean it do you,15547
sure i mean it kid,15548
i know what it is to be poor an come to this town without a nickel and not knowin anybody,15549
i did it myself,15550
but youll forget it soon,15551
i get you your job and youll be workin and youll tell me some day how funny it was,15552
the world ainot all bad kid,15553
people donot laugh at you when you get in trouble,15554
lookit me,15555
first person saw you i bet and see how tryin to help you,15556
she could not speak,15557
things moved so suddenly past,15558
he stood up,15559
in his pockets were a fivedollar bill and two ones last remnants of a small salary,15560
his hands moved among the bills prudence sweeping the fine cloud of altruistic exaltation a little off his mind,15561
then she looked at him and the animal devotion and relief in her face made him throw off reserve,15562
here kid a five spot,15563
get some sleep and get cleaned up an see you in the morning,15564
he was gone,15565
she sat quiet for a moment while her world swam,15566
a clock boomed and the noise loosed her taut nerves,15567
down on the dripping pavement she sank and sobbed and beat the cold stone,15568
free again,15569
the world had opened to her,15570
half mad with joy she stumbled toward the light of a yawning subway,15571
in one of the offices in the large newspaper building the next morning the young man heard his name called,15572
gangsters had been busy during the night,15573
and go down and get some kind of description will you,15574
into the squat building he slouched,15575
somewhere here was the man he was looking for,15576
the morgue attendant hurried up in time to watch the young mans strange motions,15577
he had backed away from a file of slabs and was leaning one hand upon a table,15578
his eyes opened incredulously,15579
there on a slab directly in front of him was the girl he had befriended last night in the park,15580
the little fool,15581
after hed been so decent to her,15582
talked on all the virtues of humanity and tried to be a friend to her was ready to lend her a helping hand,15583
given her his last fivedollar bill even,15584
the morgue man glanced from one face to the other her,15585
the reporter pulled himself together,15586
what the hell,15587
all in a days work,15588
naw,15589
i seen her some place i guess,15590
oh,15591
well say,15592
she sure was a funny case at that,15593
the reporter was moving toward the aisles again,15594
yeah he flung back over his shoulder,15595
yeah,15596
they brought her in about twothirty this morning,15597
drowned herself she did,15598
yeah,15599
yeah,15600
down by the battery,15601
funny thing,15602
they bring her in all wet and dripping and lay her out an whaddaya suppose she ad clinched in her hand but finished the young man disgustedly,15603
naw,15604
it was a counterfeit fivedollar bill,15605
mr description is beautiful and he gets into a heartinterest situation which grips you before the end of the second paragraph,15606
just visualize the scene descried in paragraph one almost shivers and experiences the chill mist and thin soupy rain,15607
observe how the author intersperses his history or retrospect with interesting action and dialogue which keeps the story moving as illustrated in about the 12th paragraph which is indented,15608
also observe how cleverly he has handled the continuity of his story or the changes of time and place with no apparent break or annoying lapses,15609
the biggest feature in this story is the climax or paradoxical ending which leaves the reader aghast and forces him to go back and read the story over again in an effort to discover what could possibly had lead up to its shocking end,15610
in other words it certainly leaves much food for thought and speculation and is one of those stories which sticks in ones mind because it leaves unanswered a number of questions,15611
why did the girl commit suicide,15612
how did she discover the bill was counterfeit,15613
was this the straw that broke the camels back,15614
this is the type of shortshort that henry might have written and it is easy to see why the editor who bought it immediately recognized its merit,15615
the next story is another written by a woman and although it contains no startling plot it has some outstanding merit,15616
it was published in on july 5th by phyllis duganne emmy was awakened by their angry voices in the kitchen below fred and dan ryder quarreling more loudly more fiercely even than usual,15617
she huddled beneath the patchwork quilt listening,15618
ever since their fathers death they had quarreled so,15619
fred wanted the farm to himself he hated his younger brother hated emmy,15620
until yesterday she had been sick with fear that dan would go,15621
her frightened mouth relaxed a warmth crept over her thin body,15622
if it hadnot been for wanting to send her away dan might never have loved her,15623
it was only yesterday that that miracle had occurred,15624
fred had told her to get out had struck her and dan had come swiftly around the corner of the barn,15625
had picked up in his strong arms and steadied her trembling,15626
em he had said,15627
why em,15628
he stared at her and then held her tightly,15629
why emmy,15630
and she had put her lips to his,15631
the tremulous softness of those young lips was destroyed once more as she pressed them together to stifle a scream,15632
below in the kitchen had sounded the report of a gun,15633
emmy was a coward,15634
thirteen years in the state orphanage before old caleb ryder took her out to do the housework which his wife could not attend to from her grace and five years of bullying were not the stuff to make courage,15635
for a long time she waited,15636
then shaking she got out of bed and walked down the stairs in her cottonflannel nightdress,15637
fred ryder stood at the foot of the steps,15638
well what do you want you little fool he demanded,15639
she wet her lips trying to speak her eyes straining to see past him into the kitchen,15640
that damned hound of ainot going to root up any more land on this farm said fred ryder grimly,15641
his thin lips moved in something like a smile for fertilizer now,15642
then his face darkened,15643
you git back to bed or well use you for fertlizer too,15644
emmy got back,15645
it seemed hours later that she heard a second shot,15646
she pulled the patchwork up over her head and lay motionless,15647
the kitchen was empty when she crept downstairs to get breakfast,15648
then fred came in from the barn whistling and sat down at the table,15649
dan she whispered,15650
cleared out he answered shortly,15651
an you clear out too,15652
as soon as he was gone she thrust her thin arms into her dingy sheepskin coat and started running down the valley,15653
the ground was hard frost had come early this year and the wind was cold,15654
the brown stalks of the corn crackled as she brushed against them and the lank scarecrows who guarded the field seemed to lean toward her leering,15655
in half an hour the entire town was in an uproar,15656
that state girl from ryders had come crying to old sheriff dillingham that fred ryder had murdered his brother,15657
the valley road looked like sunday morning alive with wagons and ford cars and people all moving swiftly more tensely than ever they moved to worship,15658
fred ryder laughed at them,15659
he and dan had had a quarrel and dan had cleared out,15660
he didnot know nor care where the fool had gone,15661
good riddance said fred ryder and his eyes rested with no emotion stronger than contempt upon pale accusing face,15662
shots,15663
of course,15664
a man had a right to shoot a worthless hound hadnot he,15665
the quarrel had begun over that damned dog,15666
dan wouldnot have gone away thout saying goodbye to me said emmy in her thin voice brother looked at her and snorted knew dan was a fool but i didnot think he was that much o a fool,15667
someone laughed voice was scarcely audible flat and unaccented,15668
why had there been two shots shot at the hound twice fred answered easily,15669
tense with excitement the men solemnly exhumed the body of dog,15670
there was one bullet wound,15671
fred shrugged,15672
he was no sharpshooter that was all,15673
he must have missed the second time,15674
as detectives they were first class farmers said fred ryder,15675
two state policemen arrived on motorcycles,15676
the accused murderer became jocular,15677
if he had killed his brother he suggested pleasantly thered probably be a corpse somewhere about,15678
they searched until sundown the house the barn the grounds,15679
the sear leaves of the corn stocks rustled ominously as men moved among them and the drunken scarecrows witnesses if there had been a crime to the scene flapped their strawstuffed sleeves in the wind as though they shook with dreadful laughter,15680
there was no body and the searchers looked at emmy curiously have said goodbye to me if hed gone away she repeated almost without emphasis,15681
the sheriff took fred ryder home with him that night and the search recommenced in the morning,15682
they could not find dan ryder dead but they could not find him alive,15683
insistent tireless the girl emmy reiterated her statement dean gone away thout sayin goodbye to me,15684
you canot hang a man emmy sheriff dillingham told her,15685
when the victim may be walkin around on his own two legs,15686
on the third day emmy sat dryeyed paler than ever watching the searchers,15687
one by one they were giving up forming a doubtful group about the sheriff dull eyes closed,15688
they mustnot give up,15689
once fred was released and back here unwatched cat came and rubbed against legs and the girl stroked her absently her eyes on the men,15690
they mustnot stop searching,15691
the cat was hungry,15692
as emmy moved across the furrowed field toward the sheriff it followed her purring against her skirts weaving in and out about her thin legs as it had used to do with dan,15693
the sheriff shook his head,15694
emmy theres nobody here,15695
the others nodded,15696
dan wouldve said she began again monotonously and suddenly her thin voice stopped,15697
her dull eyes became enormous in the withered corn a grotesque scarecrow stood before them its featureless face of bunched tight about its overstuffed body,15698
dan cat rubbed against its flapping trousers purring loudly lifting herself up on her hind legs and arching her soft back,15699
the men looked at staring eyes and their blood went cold,15700
reluctantly the sheriff stepped forward and lifted the ragged hat,15701
the packed straw slid down and the thing lurched sideways as the sheriff snatched away his trembling hand have said goodbye to me whispered emmy dully,15702
this is another example of where the author has opened the story with interesting action reserving the historic description of characters and situations until some paragraphs later,15703
like this story also has a gruesome element which a great many people like perhaps because they enjoy being shocked,15704
observe how this author has crowded a whole life story of one of her principal characters into one interesting paragraph of less than fifty words and how she has jumped from the present to the past and back again with no apparent break,15705
here she not only gives a perfect description of the character but of her past as well while at the same time keeping the action in the story moving,15706
take a look at the second paragraph which is indented and observe how this young woman indulges in a bit of realistic but brief description which projects perfect illusion for anyone who has ever walked through a corn field on a winter day,15707
it is the ability to observe and describe such apparently trivial things as the rustling of corn stalks and the flapping of the strawstuffed sleeves of the scarecrow in the wind that differentiates the seasoned writer from the amateur,15708
a strong thread of suspense is maintained throughout in this story and the surprise climax is heightened by the simple introduction of a cat which leads to a gruesome discovery,15709
the ending of this story is on a par with the ending of that famous french story in which a sculptor conceals the body of the victim of his crime by covering it with plaster and mounting it in an art gallery,15710
another outstanding feature in this story is the pathetic faith of the girl and her insistent moaning which is expressed in the last line,15711
the last of this series which i have selected for illustration and comment was published in on may and follows by houston day john addington closed his eyes,15712
the nurse with the curly hair was rubbing his face with vaseline,15713
then she covered his mouth and nose with a cone,15714
breathe deeply,15715
obediently addington inhaled the sweet fumes,15716
he wondered how badly he was hurt,15717
what was the doctor going to do to him,15718
but even before he could begin to answer his own questions he realized he was suffocating,15719
he struggled,15720
fought to unclasp his hands,15721
he wanted air,15722
again distantly he heard the nurse deep breath,15723
now,15724
again,15725
again,15726
addington obeyed,15727
magically the feeling of distress passed,15728
he dreamed,15729
memories flooded his mind in flashing pictures,15730
he saw himself as he knocked at evelyn hayes apartment on grove street,15731
then with scarcely an interval he was inside,15732
his face tingled,15733
she had slapped him,15734
bill walsh had said she had round feels,15735
bill was wrong,15736
but bill walsh wasnot usually mistaken,15737
he was a good promoter,15738
he saw himself with bill at the hotel in the adirondacks,15739
they were vacationing together,15740
he saw the lake,15741
from their rowboat it stretched in a calm expanse of shimmering blue to the shore where the shadows of the fir trees turned its color to the black of molten tar,15742
they were in the water struggling,15743
it was cold,15744
like melted ice,15745
their boat bottom up was slippery with moss,15746
there was nothing to grasp,15747
he cried out,15748
addington knew he was drowning,15749
the finality of death terrified him,15750
he saw distorted face,15751
his hair was hanging in sodden locks,15752
bill was careful of his hair,15753
he wore it long,15754
brushed straight back,15755
he heard voices,15756
welcome voices,15757
a hand reached over and grasped him,15758
they were saved,15759
now he was in the city,15760
at apartment,15761
she had slapped him again only two night before but he had gone back,15762
he really liked her now,15763
bill was wrong,15764
she wasnot that kind,15765
evelyn was weeping,15766
she had lost her job donot know what do,15767
he pillowed her head on his shoulder,15768
but baby why worry when you have me,15769
but evelyn was despondent,15770
she dabbed at her eyes have to give up the apartment,15771
he held her closer,15772
tenderly,15773
then he drained his glass,15774
the grin smelled like antifreeze compound,15775
but it glowed pleasantly in his stomach tell you what dearest,15776
if you donot find something by the first well take a stroll down to the municipal building and get married,15777
what do you say,15778
evelyn said no,15779
said it emphatically and unequivocally,15780
she didnot want to be tied down to a husband a radio and a vacuum cleaner,15781
but the alcohol had sharpened his perception,15782
evelyn was too positive,15783
he didnot believe her,15784
he became more cautious,15785
he had already said too much,15786
what the devil did he want to get married for anyway,15787
the gin began to lose its effect,15788
there was no glow now,15789
instead each succeeding glass seemed to hit him dully on the back of his neck,15790
he wanted to go home,15791
he felt dull and stupid,15792
tired too,15793
he would have a headache in the morning,15794
evelyn leaned closer go just yet so lonesome and blue,15795
three days later they were married,15796
the doctor picked up the scalpel,15797
he nodded to the curlyhaired nurse,15798
she placed the cone back on face,15799
drip,15800
drip,15801
drip,15802
addington dream pictures became shorter,15803
more vivid,15804
more fantastic,15805
he was in the army,15806
a german lunged at him with a bayonet,15807
he parried jabbed,15808
the german was bill walsh,15809
but he had a french rifle,15810
his bayonet was a yard long,15811
he leered and said got round heels,15812
then he felt bayonet pierce his body,15813
he screamed,15814
walsh was standing over him,15815
he plunged the bayonet in again,15816
and again,15817
each time the pain became more intense,15818
why didnot it kill him,15819
he couldnot move squirm out of the way,15820
the scene faded,15821
he was in an airplane,15822
bill walsh was the pilot,15823
they soared through misty clouds,15824
he felt the vibrations of the propeller but there was no noise,15825
then he was falling,15826
falling,15827
falling through space,15828
bill had dumped him out,15829
where was his parachute,15830
frantically he searched for the cord,15831
it wasnot there,15832
but had a parachute,15833
he knew it,15834
he twisted his body in the air,15835
beneath him the ground rushed up,15836
it was just like he had read,15837
he saw a telephone pole,15838
it had a sharpened point,15839
he was going to strike it,15840
he cried out,15841
the nurse looked at the doctor,15842
he nodded,15843
she opened a second can,15844
drip,15845
drip,15846
drip,15847
another dream,15848
he was at the office,15849
he knew he had been right,15850
but the boss was insultingly emphatic in his criticism,15851
and if you donot like it you know what you can do,15852
his employer wore his familiar baggy suit but his face was that of bill walsh,15853
addington tried to justify himself for quitting as he ascended the steps to his apartment,15854
he unlocked the door,15855
and then again he saw bill walsh,15856
he felt a different pain a stunning rending pain but he did not cry out,15857
how funny they looked coat was hung over a chair,15858
there was revolver too,15859
he saw himself shooting,15860
he hardly recognized the pale angry face as his own screamed evelyn,15861
oh donot,15862
she should have kept quiet,15863
he turned the gun toward her and pressed the trigger,15864
then there were policemen,15865
he had fired,15866
