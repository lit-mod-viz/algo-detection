with whom is he infatuated
how could such an infatuation prove to be an obstacle
why is an appeal made to the underworld
in what way is the appeal made
to what character in the underworld is the appeal made
what complication results
who is back of the crooked politics
how does this deprive one of justice
who is deprived of justice
what is the motive of the crooked politician
what person object or situation is mistaken as to identity in the climax
who makes the mistake
how is the mistake made
what is the person object or situation erroneously thought to be
what bearing does this have on a crisis in which the principal character finds himself
who is the person with the guilty conscience
of what does he know himself to be guilty
what does he fear from exposure
in this robot outline no stretch of the imagination is necessary to associate together logically the locale and the principal character by the animal trainer making an appearance behind the footlights in either a circus or theater
let us make this a circus story
the fact that some one is deprived of justice as stated in the crisis suggests that one of the important characters perhaps the animal trainer is a fugitive from justice or has been accused of something of which he or she is innocent and that some other character is using a knowledge of this for blackmail purposes
under the head of method an appeal is made to the underworld and some one who is also motivated with a desire to frighten an enemy
of the many interpretations possible in this situation one might be that the animal trainer is a woman who in some manner has been previously connected with the underworld and who has escaped its toils and who is now being pursued by a man
in fact we might as well impregnate the entire story with an underworld flavor and give it the following development
a beautiful young woman who has been the sweetheart of a gangster has decided to desert the underworld and return to her profession which was that of an animal trainer
she obtains a position with the circus and is pursued by the gangster who is madly infatuated with her
she refuses to have anything further to do with him
in the meantime in order to frighten him into leaving her alone she threatens to have him arrested for a murder which has been committed by the gang
this greatly enrages him and he returns to his gang and they discuss taking her for a ride because she knows too much
finally it is decided that a better plan is to hang the crime on her which they proceed to do
in the meantime they line up with a crooked prosecutor or other official who is in league with them and the girl is arrested in the midst of a performance and charged with murder
now we come to the climax or surprise twist
during the process of the trial and when the gangster is on the witness stand he sees the man whom he thought he himself had killed and for whose murder he is trying to have the girl convicted
thinking it to be a case of the dead coming to life he loses his nerve and becomes so excited that he confesses the murder himself
the man in the audience is the long lost twin of the man who was murdered and he has unexpectedly appeared on the scene
the end
here we have a surprise twist and a trick ending
by reserving the fact that the murdered man had a twin we provide ourselves with a trick ending and by having a character do something unexpected at or near the end of the story we have the desired surprise twist
another way to have accomplished the same purpose would have been to have a male member of the circus one who loves the girl and who was a clever makeup artist disguise himself so as to look exactly like the murdered man and then appear in courtroom at the psychological moment
the only trouble about this latter suggestion would be that it would probably introduce too much material for a shortshort story because it would be necessary to devote some attention to the romance between the couple
i can see that by using this treatment the story could be developed into a ten thousand word story or more
my reader will of course understand that this is only one of scores of shortshort story plots that could be evolved from outline number of the even numbers and it was developed in less than fifteen minutes
now let us select one of the number outlines and develop a plot in which there is no melodrama
let us also take number from this list
the questions which we would ask ourselves might be as follows where is the cabaret located
what is the husband doing in the cabaret
whose husband is he
what is his profession
who is the loved one whose soul is to be saved
in what way is the soul about to be saved
how is it proposed to save the soul
is the lost soul a man or a woman
is the lost soul any relation to the husband
what relation
who is possessed of false pride
who makes the pathetic effort to eclipse another
in what way is the effort made
who is the other one
why is the effort pathetic
what kind of a mistake is about to be made on account of a dream
who is about to make the mistake
who is the dreamer
what was the dream
how could a dream cause the mistake
how does a little child bring about a reconciliation
between whom is a reconciliation affected
what has been the cause of the rift between the parties who become reconciled
what relation is the child to the parties who become reconciled
is the husband one of the parties who become reconciled
if so with whom does he become reconciled
is the child any relation to the husband
if so what
a young woman who has been a dancer becomes the wife of a more or less prosaic or commonplace husband whose position some time later places him in contact with a radio station
it is discovered that he has natural ability as a singer
he is given few tryouts takes training and soon becomes a star baritone
the couple have a little girl three or four years old and being the wife of a star whose time and attention are largely monopolized by other people soon becomes burdensome to the wife
having been a dancer she has some professional ambition which never forsakes her and she takes seriously the remarks made by some of her friends about the attention paid to her husband by other women
professional engagements take the husband away for a time and the wife places the little girl in the care of a friend and resolves to make a name for herself in the professional world
the first opportunity that presents itself is in a night club
the husband returns and is shocked
he goes to the night club and please with her to give up the idea and she proudly refuses
he sees that she is in an atmosphere that may prove to be ruinous
she can think of nothing but her consuming ambition to become his equal professionally or to perhaps eclipse him
he tells her that she is going to the devil
this results in an estrangement
for a time he makes veiled appeals to her over the radio as he sings to his audience
she gets the message but does not heed them
then comes a time when he in the broadcasting studio hears the announcer describe an accident to an unidentified child who has been run down by an automobile and he recognizes it as his own
in the midst of a gay number at the cabaret she hears the same announcement and with a cry dashes from the stage
the two meet at the bedside of the injured tot at the hospital and silently pray for her life
the child hovers between life and death for days during which time all misunderstanding between the mother and the father are melted away and when the child recovers consciousness she sees them in each others arms
when the father asks the little one how she came to run away and be injured she replies dreamed the devil was after my mama and i was going down to get her
the end
it is more difficult to write a heart interest drama than it is a melodrama and even though this little story appears to have less plot in it than the other one more mental effort has been required to write it as to include the necessary heart interest and pathos as well as the dramatic punch at the end
attention is directed here to the difference between the trick ending or surprise twist which is found in the other story and the dramatic punch or heart throb which we have at the end of this one
here we have not purposely reserved any pertinent facts introduced misleading dialogue or had any character do some unexpected thing at the last minute in order to provide the trick ending or surprise twist
instead we have simply used the childs statement of her dream about her mother as the climax
there is heart interest in this for the reason that it emphasizes the love of the child for her mother and establishes the fact that she has perhaps overhead the fathers statement that the mother is going to the devil and has taken it seriously
to have introduced the statement of the child earlier in the story would have been to have lost the dramatic punch and heart interest climax at the end
all of which goes to show that the way in which one tells the story is as important as the story itself
right here it might be well to emphasize the fact that the plot genie is not designed to supply the continuity for a story but merely a plot outline
in other words it is not necessary that the introduction of story elements appear in the same order or even a similar order in the finished story as they do in the plot outline
the genie is intended to supply the plot and then the author can tell the story in any manner desired
one must first have a story before he can tell it however and to supply this story is the purpose of the plot genie
