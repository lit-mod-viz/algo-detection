tis is one of the best examples i have ever seen where by exercising clever judgment in the point of attack or in the manner of opening the story the author has immediately aroused the interest of the reader in what would probably have been an uninteresting story if treated differently,no doubt there was not much use in poetry and as for novels to his mind there were only works,0.80433923
in this story the author first establishes a highly dramatic situation by telling you in the first five lines that one of his characters is out to kill the other one thereby also establishing a strong thread of suspense and creating in your mind a desire to know the whys and wherefores or what it is all about,if he had one abiding trait it was his desire of astonishing people and in some way best known to himself managed to cause the circulation of the most extraordinary stories wherein he himself was the chief actor,0.8231120999999999
it was no doubt the authors manner of telling the story in such a way as to immediately seize the interest of the reader and hold it that resulted in the sale of this story to the next published shortshort from which is outstanding and calls for favorable comment was published on may it follows by guy gilpatric we pulled into lyon at about midnight and found that we had twenty minutes to wait,well returned the other you know what the publication of this article would mean for you,0.81994456

beneath him the ground rushed up,their divingstone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre,0.8349995000000001
beneath him the ground rushed up,he snatched the ashplant roughly from hand and sprang down the steps but temple hearing him move in pursuit fled through the dusk like a wild creature nimble and fleetfooted heavy boots were heard loudly charging across the quadrangle and then returning heavily foiled and spurning the gravel at each step,0.8155659000000001
beneath him the ground rushed up,he dug his bootheel into the ground and turned away to the house abruptly cursing beneath his breath,0.8195389999999999
beneath him the ground rushed up,he had only time to jump back upon the embankment when with a quivering of all the earth a locomotive single unattached shot by him with a roar filling the air with the reek of hot oil vomiting smoke and sparks its enormous eye cyclopean red throwing a glare far in advance shooting by in a sudden crash of confused thunder filling the night with the terrific clamour of its iron hoofs,0.8100616999999999

beneath him the ground rushed up,it was like sand blown from off a rock the throng of guests carried by an impulse that was not to be resisted bore back against the sides of the barn overturning chairs tripping upon each other falling down scrambling to their feet again stepping over one another getting behind each other diving under chairs flattening themselves against the wild clamouring pellmell blind deaf panicstricken a confused tangle of waving arms torn muslin crushed flowers pale faces tangled legs that swept in all directions back from the centre of the floor leaving annixter and hilma alone deserted their arms about each other face to face with delaney mad with alcohol bursting with remembered insult bent on evil reckless of results,0.8338046
beneath him the ground rushed up,for years he could with but little effort reconstruct the densely packed crowd flattened against the sides of the barn the festoons of lanterns the mingled smell of evergreens new wood sachets and powder smoke the vague clamour of distress and terror that rose from the throng of guests the squealing of the buckskin the uneven explosions of the revolvers the reverberation of trampling hoofs a brief glimpse of harran excited face at the door of the harness room and in the open space in the centre of the floor himself and delaney manoeuvring swiftly in a cloud of smoke revolver contained but six cartridges,0.8002956
beneath him the ground rushed up,she stood for an instant spellbound her eyes wide her bosom swelling then all at once turned and fled darting across the plank that served for a foot bridge over the creek gaining the opposite bank and disappearing with a brisk rustle of underbrush such as might have been made by the flight of a frightened fawn,0.81793463

beneath him the ground rushed up,the steam hissed and rasped the ground reverberated a hollow note and the thousands upon thousands of wheat stalks sliced and slashed in the clashing shears of the header rattled like dry rushes in a hurricane as they fell inward and were caught up by an endless belt to disappear into the bowels of the vast brute that devoured them,0.8386737
beneath him the ground rushed up,he got upon his feet only to find that he sunk ankle deep in the loose packed mass underfoot,0.8389839
beneath him the ground rushed up,directly underneath the chute the wheat as it poured in raised itself in a conical mound but from the sides of this mound it shunted away incessantly in thick layers flowing in all directions with the nimbleness of water,0.82064915
beneath him the ground rushed up,furthermore the succeeding waves of wheat rolling from the mound under the chute beat him back swirling and dashing against his legs and knees mounting swiftly higher carrying him off his feet,0.8486976999999999
beneath him the ground rushed up,once more he retreated drawing back from beneath the hatch,0.8182745
beneath him the ground rushed up,before he knew it he was kneedeep again and a long swirl of grain sweeping outward from the everbreaking everreforming pyramid below the chute poured around his thighs immobolising him,0.8348730999999999
beneath him the ground rushed up,he stumbled as he reached it and fell directly beneath the pour,0.8265159
beneath him the ground rushed up,but even as he thought about this the cone under the chute broke again and sent a great layer of grain rippling and tumbling toward him,0.8021060999999999

beneath him the ground rushed up,guided by the sound of the falling wheat behrman crawled on hands and knees toward the hatchway,0.8018403000000001
beneath him the ground rushed up,deafened with the roar of the grain blinded and made dumb with its chaff he threw himself forward with clutching fingers rolling upon his back and lay there moving feebly the head rolling from side to side,0.81295514
beneath him the ground rushed up,the swanhilda lifted and rolled slowly majestically on the ground swell of the pacific the water hissing and boiling under her forefoot her cordage vibrating and droning in the steady rush of the trade winds,0.8175705
