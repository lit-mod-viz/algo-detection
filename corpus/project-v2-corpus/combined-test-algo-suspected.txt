judy ward wasnot the only one who be afraid of ben grute who leave -PRON- coyote spread for -PRON- breed hand to run while -PRON- stay in sierrita gambling drink ing and roughhandle the darkskinned senorita 
a majority of the populace fear grute who d kill two man here on -PRON- own stomping ground and whose gun be for hire away from there 
stranger would hit town and talk to -PRON- or -PRON- would receive a letter and then grute would ride out 
when -PRON- return -PRON- would be wellheele with cash and would make brag reference to a gunslinging job -PRON- would do in texas new mexico or ari zona

that the secret of the paper be out be due rather to tory guile and vigilance rather than to any lack of cautiousness on the part of the patriot 
while not expect to encounter difficulty capt paul be on the alert for -PRON- but -PRON- would have look upon -PRON- as a heartless wretch have -PRON- pass a woman who need aid and fail to give -PRON-

as -PRON- happen rotherick knelt face -PRON- bend over and use the hatchet on a cask below 
have the man back be to the young planter a welldirecte blow would have stun the fellow and make -PRON- capture comparatively an easy matter 
but that consider the circumstance be out of the question 
the head of the cask be quickly smash reveal the black content 
as rotherick reach for the powder horn one of the prisoner roll from beneath the bunk and struggle to -PRON- knee before capt paul have a chance to get at -PRON- 
the fellow have chew at the cord until -PRON- have part and -PRON- be free to use -PRON- tongue 
look out rotherick -PRON- roar 
capt jone yere talkin to 
rotherick leap erect glare 
so ho -PRON- shout the traitor -PRON- the -PRON- be reach for -PRON- dirk when the young planter grapple with -PRON- 
there be a terrific struggle back and forth across the cabin each man seek to draw a weapon and bring the battle to an end the other prevent -PRON- 
at last with an effort that call forth all -PRON- great strength capt paul tear away and strike rotherick from -PRON- 
the sailor stagger backward strike the lanthom with -PRON- foot and topple -PRON- through the trap 
from that moment -PRON- be a drawn battle 
neither combatant thought of anything but get clear of the roost in the short possible time 
as -PRON- bound past the man kneel on the floor the young planter linger an instant to sever the cord that bind -PRON- foot then race on 
-PRON- gain the after deck catch a glimpse of rotherick and the robber behind -PRON- and bluish flash puff upward from the hold and a thunderous explosion follow 
the young planter daze and bewilder find -PRON- a few minute after the explosion stand on the creek bank lean against a tree 
-PRON- left arm numb and bleeding hang limply at -PRON- side 
a dozen yard away the wreck of the roost be burn fiercely float fragment of the illstarre craft litter the water for a hundred foot up and down the small stream 
rotherick be nowhere in sight nor be the robber 
capt paul be presently aware that some one be talk to -PRON- and that the muzzle of a gun be stare -PRON- in the face ye try ter fight cause i get the dead wood on ye 
now tell -PRON- what s become o capt paul jone 
be -PRON- in that alec be behind the rifle and in -PRON- face be a strange mingling of grief and determination 
the young planter in -PRON- borrow garb be not recognize by the boy albeit the planter hat be go and but for the excitement of the moment wit would have prove equal to the emergency 
capt paul alec answer jone weakly 
the man rotherick come aboard the flatboat and -PRON- have a struggle 
a lighted lanthom be knock into the hold on a lot of powder and the magazine blow up 
capt paul cry alec 
yer own mother wouldnot have know ye in that getup hurt 
look at yer all bloody 
yes say the young planter have a close call of -PRON- and not -PRON- yet by a long chalk 
get the horse alec dizzy and can hardly stand 
as -PRON- speak capt paul sink down at the base of the tree everything in -PRON- range of vision whirl about -PRON- 
for some time after that -PRON- have only a confused notion of what happen 
-PRON- be not unconscious as -PRON- have be in -PRON- own house the evening before but -PRON- be on the verge of -PRON- 
the rough treatment rotherick have give -PRON- at the plantation may have have something to do with -PRON- hazy condition in the main however the explosion be to be jeld responsible 
how -PRON- have gain the shore when the deck of the flatboat heave upward beneath -PRON- capt paul have not 
-PRON- slight idea 
-PRON- remember vaguely that alec come with the brse and lift -PRON- to -PRON- saddle then that -PRON- ihreade the wood 
next dame gilpin and -PRON- husband be help -PRON- 
rom the horse and after that -PRON- be in a chair dame gilpin attend to -PRON- arm and master gilpin hold a jewter mug of madeira to -PRON- lip 
presently -PRON- walk to a couch assist by the ferryman and sink into a heavy slumber 
-PRON- sleep out the remainder of that day and the whole ff the succeed night apparently in as deep a trance as be duncan macbean but -PRON- be a natural sleep the deep of a man who have endure much and be far spend with weariness 
-PRON- dream have to do with the ebony box intrust to -PRON- by the virginia patriot 
when -PRON- awake the morning sun be look in at the open door and terence omalley and master gilpin be stand at the head of the couch 
ah ha cry omalley the lad -PRON- again 
faith -PRON- a wonder -PRON- s alive at all at all 
yez may well say that same masther omalley -PRON- an echoing brogue from the kitchen 
-PRON- be dame gilpin who like the dash terence be a gift of the ould sod to the new world 
many a man would have be dead long since av -PRON- have go through all that 
capt paul have do 
sure -PRON- a lad av iron -PRON- be 
how do ye feel captain ask gilpin as the young planter sit up on the couch 
hearty thank -PRON- smile the young planter must have sleep well i take -PRON- 
the whole night long sir say gilpin 
capt paul whistle incredulously 
where do -PRON- come from omalley -PRON- inquire afield with some of the other planter tryin to jet a crack at old truepenny tyburn north of the river and i ride over here for a word with master gilpin 
-PRON- think -PRON- couldnot trust -PRON- to scatter this iband of robber 
not so -PRON- lad cry omalley trust ye scatter anything from a corporal guard o red coat to a company o the own do -PRON- work paul the mangy breed be scatter by that night work at -PRON- plantation an the blowin up of the roost 
the leader be tryin to get clear an be hot after -PRON- 
-PRON- hear about the explosion then 
everyone have hear of -PRON- up an down the river 
as near as -PRON- can make out three o the band lose -PRON- life in the fight at -PRON- plantation an two more be find near the char wreck o the flatboat 
that make foive an old truepenny be not strong enough in number to stand the loss of so many 
the plantation paul owin to -PRON- gallant work be well rid o the band those that be leave be makin for distant part to leave ye now happy in the thought that yere -PRON- again 
hold hard a minute terence cry paul 
when do -PRON- halt at -PRON- place last 
in the early hour of the mornin 
have anyone call there inquire for -PRON- 
not a soul -PRON- boy 
capt paul be think of the man who be to call with the letter from mr adam and the key to the ebony box 
the messenger have not yet arrive and there be still time for -PRON- to make another attempt at recover the paper 
how be duncan macbean 
terence omalley shake -PRON- head a strange case for ye 
bob tichenor be there and -PRON- say condition be the quar thing -PRON- would ever encounter 
-PRON- lie quiet enough breathin natural and seeminly asleep 
sure -PRON- must have be a powerful drug 
but tichenor think hell come around all right an ye give -PRON- time 
omalley thereupon take -PRON- departure and capt paul get up and strip -PRON- of the borrow gear which -PRON- have don on the flatboat 
although -PRON- arm pain -PRON- the numbness be go and on the whole -PRON- feel well 
a brief examination show -PRON- that -PRON- be not to be cripple nor to be long without the use of the hand 
furthermore -PRON- discover that -PRON- have lose neither -PRON- sword nor -PRON- pistol 
if -PRON- have not carry -PRON- ashore after the explosion alec must have find -PRON- and take -PRON- in charge 
anyhow the weapon lie by the captain bunk in as good trim as ever -PRON- be 
a refreshing dip in cold spring water serve still further in give back to the young planter all -PRON- customary strength and vigor and when -PRON- have join the gilpin in a hearty breakfast -PRON- be prime for the road and eager to be about -PRON- work 
-PRON- have in mind a call at the house of samuel sparrow 
master plantation lie on both side of the river and -PRON- be rather two plantation than one each have -PRON- house and quarter but the master -PRON- live on the south shore 
if rotherick be to be believe the cronin have cross over to the north side thereby put a broad sweep of water between -PRON- and capt paul 
whether -PRON- be beyond the rappahannock still or have leave for other part since the night -PRON- have flee from capt plantation be the point the youth wish to settle by a call at master since mansion lie on -PRON- road to -PRON- own plantation capt paul would not be at much inconvenience in call there 
when the morning meal be do the young planter lose no time in take to the road 
-PRON- follow the highroad and not the bridle path 
have -PRON- desire -PRON- could have travel the latter course and thus have gain a final look at the relic of the robber roost which -PRON- have so successfully invade 
however -PRON- have no wish to return to the spot which have witness the explosion that have cost two of the robber -PRON- life and come so near to cost -PRON- -PRON- own 
there be a languid warmth even in that early hour and as -PRON- gallop through the heart of the thick wood redbird catbird and robin sing around -PRON- 
from some cause -PRON- hope mount high 
a feeling spring in -PRON- breast that all be not lose and that the messenger who be to call for the ebony box would ultimately receive -PRON- at -PRON- hand 
-PRON- would be difficult to account for this reassuring thought 
so far as the ebony box be concern the wile of mistress betsy seem to have be entirely successful 
nevertheless capt paul spur on with a more complacent spirit than -PRON- have have at any time since -PRON- have discover the loss of the paper 
by and by -PRON- draw rein at master door find master sparrow -PRON- enjoy a pipe on -PRON- veranda 
the gentleman greeting be sour and uncordial and -PRON- be plain -PRON- sad treatment at capt plantation still rankle in -PRON- bosom

goddard be uncle to all -PRON- man in the sense that give an avuncular character to every genial middleage person who look after the welfare of young employee 
in the early summer uncle sila have send a hundred horse into north dakota 
business have not be good and late fall find half the horse still outhand 
these horse be be winter at the morton ranch on marsh hay cut and stack by peter markham and reece bailey who have be send by uncle sila to take care of the horse herd 
when spring come there be a promise of turn off every head of the stock at a good profit 
the winter so far have not be particularly lonely for the montana man 
the snow of december have be light and -PRON- have be possible for th horse to paw out considerable forage in the hill 
january however bring in a good fall of the beautiful and -PRON- have be necessary to corral and shelter the animal and to go extensively into the feeding 
reese bailey uncle foreman find time to play cribbage with lance morton father and peter and nixon acquire leisure for skating and ski popular sport at -PRON- home ranch in the rockie 
a would have be a creek in a country of large through the morton holding and -PRON- glassy surface offer a resistless invitation to the steel runner 
as for the skiing there be plam and hill for run climbing and glissade 
while bailey and morton be busy at -PRON- eternal fifteentwo fifteenfour peter and markham be skate or skiing often with hesther who be fond of both sport 
the girl if appearance be to be believe be rather fond of markham also but have few smile to waste on peter 
in -PRON- bashful blundering way peter try to make -PRON- agreeable to hesther 
-PRON- be big and awkward however and have towcolore hair a slow wit and a few grace of speech or manner 
-PRON- effort to impress hesther be overwhelm by the never fail persiflage and the rakish dress and carriage of handsome porter markham 
markham posesse a confidence in -PRON- that be sublime a confidence that shine brilliantly in contrast with clumsy ineffectiveness of nixon peter 
peter realize this and nourish a bitter grudge against -PRON- physical and mental shortcoming 
-PRON- use to dream of a fire at the ranch in which -PRON- pose as a hero and bear the fair hesther to safety from the ranch house through a furnace of flame 
then in -PRON- vision hi picture the girl as take -PRON- hand and humbly ask -PRON- forgiveness for -PRON- failure to perceive -PRON- sterling quality from the first 
during such moment of illusion the saphead be almost happy 
but the ranch house never take fire and the chance to prove -PRON- a hero by rescue hesther morton be deny by fate 
in however an opportunity present -PRON- through the winter sport at lake 
markham and peter enter -PRON- in the skijumpe context and skate race 
-PRON- drive the fifty mile which separate from the lagke and hesther go with -PRON- to see the carnival of sport and to spend a night or two with relative in lake city 
again peter have dream but now on the homeward drive every hope be shatter and -PRON- long for for a period of blank obscurity and complete retirement 
-PRON- could have declare that one of -PRON- ski have be tamper with and that one of -PRON- skate strap have be all but cut through with the point of a knife 
examination make -PRON- sure of both fact yet -PRON- have not occur to -PRON- to sob 
-PRON- have blunder in not make certain of -PRON- ski and skate beforehand so -PRON- could not see how any one but -PRON- be at fault 
as -PRON- crouch in the back seat of the sleigh -PRON- consider request uncle silas goddard to recall -PRON- to the montana headquarters 
there at last -PRON- would be rid of markham and cut off forever from the demoralizing and disdainful eye of hesther 
yes -PRON- would go back to the home ranch and -PRON- would do this in spite of something which -PRON- know and which be very important to -PRON- future 
-PRON- be common knowledge that a place of preferment be to be give by uncle sila to either peter or to foremanship at a new ranch with a chance to acquire an interest in the horse and cattle 
reece bailey be watch peter and markham and on -PRON- report uncle sila would act 
to retire from the north dakota venture of the ranchowner now would cut peter off entirely from promotion and drop the plum in porter hand 
but peter in the bitterness of -PRON- heart be allow nothing aside form -PRON- own peace of mind to influence -PRON- 
yes -PRON- would ask uncle sila to recall -PRON- to montana 
-PRON- still there nix 
markham suddenly ask ture to look rearward 
peter grunt so blame quiet go on markham with a laugh that i reckon -PRON- may have take another header into the snow back a way on the trail 
hesther join in the laugh and in spirit poor peter writhe 
the short day be close and the sun go down beyond the white horizon in cold glory 
-PRON- be five mile form and markham have drive the horse so hard that -PRON- be nearly fag 
-PRON- breathe wheezingly and frost coated heaving side 
the place drag in spite of relentless use of the whip 
anyhow speak up peter suddenly -PRON- may think of the team a little porter near tucker do this driving cry markham never yet have to ask a saphead for advice in handle horse 
and again the whip fall on the strain flank 
peter clench -PRON- fist in the bearskin glove 
-PRON- occur to -PRON- that -PRON- could lift markham bodily out of the front seat take -PRON- place and do the driving -PRON- but -PRON- do not 
the horse struggle on and in the fall dark the traveler top a rise that give -PRON- a dim view of the building of ranch 
a light show in one of the ranchhouse window like a star and toward -PRON- markham drive and presently halt at the door 
now that handle the rein all the way from lake nix remark markham as -PRON- jump out and help hesther to alight allow -PRON- up to -PRON- to take care of the team 
cold essie 
not a bit the girl answer and hurry toward the door 
markham follow -PRON- and peter drive on to the stable 
as -PRON- unhitch and bring the horse into the shelter -PRON- be a little surprised to discover that there be no other animal in the place 
the team be but cow horse together with those of peter and markham should have be in the stable unless bailey be out oat the corral and shelter shed look after the fifty range horse that be keep up there 
peter light a lantern remove the harness from the horse and after put hay in the manger begin rub the animal down with an old gummy sack 
-PRON- be hard at this when a call reach -PRON- ear from the house peter 
this the jump 
-PRON- be voice and there be a note of alarm in -PRON- that startle peter 
lantern in hand -PRON- hurry out of the stable and make -PRON- way to the house 
fling the door wide -PRON- cross the threshold into the ranchhouse sit room wrong porter -PRON- ask 
the cannonball stove glow with heat 
that and the bright oil lamp dazzle eye for the moment and -PRON- could not see what be go on in the room 
bailey have be hurt come the voice of markham 
every horse in the herd wha be drive off by -PRON- even take mount with the rest 
big outrage that ever happen in these part like to know what the blame country be come to 
the blur lift from before peter eye 
-PRON- see bailey -PRON- face twist with pain lie on a couch 
mrs morton bend over -PRON- bathe a wound shoulder from a basin of hot water 
-PRON- husband be walk up and down fume and sputtering 
markham stand beside the couch look down at the foreman with a queer expression on -PRON- face 
hesther all excited be remove -PRON- wrap with shake hand 
horse steal gasp peter daze by the weird calamity 
how could -PRON- happen 
be bailey badly hurt stand there gawp fussed morton 
something have get to be do and -PRON- up to -PRON- and markham to do -PRON- 
a gang of scoundrel from across the line make off with the stock and -PRON- be no more than three hour since -PRON- happen 
take -PRON- team and go to roscommon 
the sheriff get to be notify 
bailey say the thief be make for the north and if -PRON- and markham be quick a posse can get between the gang and the boundary line 
for heavens sake peter wake up 
peter shake -PRON- put down the lantern and come to the side of the couch 
whey donot markham wake up -PRON- ask -PRON- suggest anything yet 
nothing to suggest markham answer flash a sharp look at peter twenty mile to roscommon and no chance of get there ahead of the thief and the steal stock 
the only animal -PRON- can put -PRON- hand on be the two that bring -PRON- from lake and -PRON- be do up 
-PRON- know that peter 
what about use skate or ski inquire peter 
by thunder there be a way of get to roscommon in time to help the sheriff head off the steal stock 
there be a dominant compelling note in the voice of peter 
-PRON- be so unexpected in -PRON- assertiveness that every one in the room be startle 
-PRON- washedout blue eye fence aggressively with the snap black eye of markham 
skate or ski repeat markham -PRON- upper lip curl 
why -PRON- all of thirty mile to roscommon if -PRON- follow the crook of the river 
and how much would -PRON- figure -PRON- by ski if -PRON- cross bear butte instead of go around -PRON- 
talk sense if -PRON- know how nix forget the fellow who rustle -PRON- stock have three hour the lead 
how far will three hour of drive in this snow get the steal herd return peter 
the thief will have a tough job of -PRON- 
-PRON- bailey twist -PRON- flushed face from under the minister hand of mrs morton 
the varmint be go north by the long knife dry wash -PRON- say -PRON- voice shake with the pain of -PRON- wound only three mile west of roscommon 
if -PRON- boy could get word to the sheriff somehow i reckon -PRON- may head off the raider with a posse 
but if -PRON- do anything -PRON- will have to do -PRON- quick 
porter and -PRON- eye swerve to markham look to si goddard be look to -PRON- 
nigh on to five thousand dollar worth of horse be be push towards the border and here helpless to do a thing 
-PRON- donot seem possible to do a thing reece return markham 
if -PRON- could round up a crown of man in short order and take after the thief on fresh horse like enough -PRON- may overhaul -PRON- 
but where s the ride stock 
why near neighbor be ten mile away 
peter flash a disapproving glance at markham pull off -PRON- bearskin glove and slump down in a chair by the stove 
from the pocket of -PRON- overcoat -PRON- take -PRON- skate also a new strap -PRON- have secure in lake city 
quickly -PRON- replace the broken strap with the new one 
-PRON- go to try and get to roscommon by river nix 
morton inquire figure the chance be well that way than go over bear butte on ski peter answer 
the river clean of snow and mostly the ice be like a lookingglass 
i be go to do -PRON- good to get word to the sheriff and to start a roscommon doctor this way to look after bailey 
-PRON- be locoed growl markham all right to get a doctor for reese here but there ainot a chance to save the stock this side of the line 
let the raider get -PRON- across the boundary and then take the matter up with the canadian mount police -PRON- advice 
if -PRON- wait till the stock be out of this country put in the rancher there wonot be a chance 
not a chance on earth agree bailey 
that outfit of thief know exactly what -PRON- be about 
everything be cut and dry and somebody sure tip -PRON- off regard the layout here bet a thousand against a chink wash ticket that -PRON- bronk will be take care of across the line sost -PRON- canot be locate by nobody 
-PRON- thief pick a time when i be alone at the shelter shed and porter and nix be to the winter sport at the lake 
-PRON- drop -PRON- out of -PRON- saddle without why s or wherefore and then make off with -PRON- mount and send a man to the stable for peter and ride horse 
by the time i cover the mile back to the ranch house the stock be ell on the way north 
-PRON- break off abruptly clench -PRON- tooth hard as a spasm of pain run through -PRON- body get another coat remark peter rise from -PRON- chair and start for the door that lead to -PRON- room 
-PRON- wonot be possible to make any kind of time in a long overcoat like this 
-PRON- disappear 
markham come to the side of the couch 
if peter have a chance reece say -PRON- hell make a bobble of some kind and spoil -PRON- all -PRON- way 
i better go to roscommon -PRON- 
peter can use -PRON- skate and take the river trail and use -PRON- ski and go over the butte 
i donot think -PRON- have a ghost of snow ahead of the stock but -PRON- up to -PRON- to see what -PRON- can do the talk exclaimed morton approvingly 
the thief have help from this ranch -PRON- add darkly toss a significant glance toward the door through which peter just pass and i havenot get a whole lot of confidence peter be square bailey aver 
square as a die 
-PRON- j donot seem to have the knack for puttin -PRON- idee across 
the man that save -PRON- bronk porter -PRON- add significantly be go to make the big kind of a hit with goddard 
if any one connect with the sheriff at roscommon in time to save the bronk markham return -PRON- will be -PRON- 
-PRON- speak with a confidence that thrill every one in the room and hesther if the red in -PRON- cheek and the sparkle in -PRON- eye be any indication most of all be ready -PRON- finish move toward the door in about two shake 
-PRON- must have some hot coffee before -PRON- start say hesther and see that -PRON- be ready for -PRON- 
markham be back in the room before peter have reappear 
-PRON- wear a leather coat and the bottom of -PRON- trouser be lace inside -PRON- high shoe top 
trim and handsome -PRON- look and ready for a grueling night work 
hesther be just place the coffee on the table and -PRON- lift -PRON- eye to flash a glance of admiration at the young ski runner be ready in a minute essie say markham with a nod and a smile 
take -PRON- ski from a corner of the room -PRON- sit down lay -PRON- across -PRON- knee and proceed to grease -PRON- well from a can which -PRON- have bring into the room and have place on the stove 
while -PRON- work peter come lumber in 
peter have don a ragged sweater whose collar come up around -PRON- ear 
over this be button a faded and threadbare coat 
-PRON- oldfashione skate be under -PRON- arm 
from beneath the rim of -PRON- motheaten fur cap -PRON- tow hair show in a sort of fringe 
the cap have ear flap with string at -PRON- end 
the flap be loose and the string flutter as -PRON- move -PRON- head 
-PRON- shoe be of cowhide strong and serviceable but not at all ornamental 
-PRON- have tie the bottom of -PRON- trouser to -PRON- ankle with piece of cord 
the contrast between peter and markham be very striking 
so far as appearance go markham have -PRON- on peter by about a hundred to one go too nix observe markham lay -PRON- ski to one side go over the butte and get a month pay that say i beat -PRON- into roscommon 
maybe -PRON- will return peter start for the outside door 
there be more bitterness in peters heart 
-PRON- believe -PRON- understand the situation 
markham have win the ski jump and the skating race and now -PRON- want to round off -PRON- triumph by be first to carry the news of the horse thieve to the sheriff 
markham be plan a spectacular bit of work for uncle si goddard incidentally 
mainly -PRON- be think of the effect of -PRON- night success on hesth morton 
wait nixon call mrs morton 
essie have get some hot coffee ready and -PRON- must have a cup before -PRON- leave 
the rancher wife be the only one who ever give much thought to peter 
-PRON- consider -PRON- now when the consideration and confidence of the other seem to center wholly in markham 
much oblige mrs morton peter answer but i donot reckon take the time 
-PRON- see -PRON- add as -PRON- lay a hand on the doorknob a case where every minute count 
before the good woman could answer the door have close behind peter 
markham pull up -PRON- shoulder in a shrug as -PRON- lift the cup of steam coffee first blunder -PRON- remark 
-PRON- have a habit of go -PRON- blind and without give any preparation to the work ahead of -PRON- hope -PRON- wonot meet with any accident murmur mrs morton 
that boy get a good heart even if -PRON- be a little odd always be a blunder and a saphead grunt -PRON- husband 
if the steal horse be recover -PRON- will be markham who make -PRON- possible 
markham do not tarry long over -PRON- coffee 
within a few moment after peter leave -PRON- be out in the nipping air 
hesther a shawl over -PRON- head step through the doorway to watch while -PRON- cross the trampled snow around the ranch house and then knelt to thrust the toe of -PRON- shoe in the bilgeri binding of the ski and to buckle the ankle strap 
-PRON- arise presently and shout a farewell to the girl glide away over the snowy level gracefully swiftly with -PRON- ski stick bite into the snow and propel -PRON- onward do a man work this night murmur hesther and -PRON- will as -PRON- win at lake city carnival 
then -PRON- go back into the house to describe in detail how peter have lose and markham have win in the winter sport contest at the lake 
river have many twist and turn in the thirty mile which -PRON- cover between ranch and roscommon 
pass within a stone throw of the ranch house -PRON- flow almost due north for six mile then enter the rough hill country -PRON- double back on -PRON- course for three mile round the base of bluff in a fourmile curve come east by south around the base of bear butte and then curve in a northwesterly direction for the last twelve mile that carry -PRON- through the outskirt of the county seat 
markham on -PRON- ski could con a direct course to roscommon bisect the river at three point and finally climb the butte for a long glissade into the town 
that glissade right into the edge of the settlement measure ten mile of down grade 
the slope of bear butte be smooth and directly under -PRON- crest the descent be steep 
a mile of this and then the course fall away more gently 
markham if -PRON- make good time to the eastern base of bear butte would very likely reach that particular spot ahead of peter for -PRON- would have to travel only seven mile while peter be go sixteen 
where markham would lose would be in climb the butte and where -PRON- would make up -PRON- loss would be in the long glissade down the opposite side 
at the river edge peter screw the skate into -PRON- heel pull the strap tight and buckle -PRON- then put on -PRON- bearskin glove and strike out 
-PRON- be well away toward bluff before markham make -PRON- first crossing of the river near the ranch house 
the ice be in splendid condition 
a strong wind have sweep -PRON- clean of loose snow save here and there at the turn where drift have form 
then a slight thaw a few day before have be follow by a tightening of the cold and all rough spot have be smooth away 
markham whose steel runner be the very last word in allmetal skate excel as a figure skater 
-PRON- could cut all sort of graceful figure on the ice and with hesther morton would do a sort of waltz which the girl seem to consider rare sport 
peter on the other hand be not proficient at that sort of thing 
-PRON- prefer straight skate possibly because -PRON- realize that fancy caper be quite out of -PRON- line 
the steel wood and leather with which -PRON- be shod seem best adapt to straightaway work anyhow 
peter know every foot of the river between the ranch and roscommon 
-PRON- have cover that long stretch of ice several time while get -PRON- in trim for the skating race at lake 
there be white ice under the shelter of the bluff and the butte cause by a fall of snow while the first crystal be form 
this have be full of air bubble and have be treacherous up to the time the severe frost have follow the thaw 
after that the liquefy snow have congeal into a sound and superlative smoothness 
there be not a spot to be fear on the entire course 
with long steady swinging stroke peter sweep around the first turn and come south on the stretch which markham be to cross in order to thread a seam through bluff 
but although the moonlight be brilliant upon the sparkle snow crust -PRON- could see nothing of -PRON- rival 
-PRON- may be -PRON- reason that markham have already effect -PRON- second crossing of the river and be even then in the gash that cut through the bluff 
peter grind -PRON- tooth and with -PRON- runner ring musically pass like a gliding specter around the bluff base 
three mile farther and -PRON- may obtain a view of markham as -PRON- emerge from the shallow defile and push over the open level toward the butte 
-PRON- be have queer thought about markham 
why have the fellow protest against any attempt to reach roscommon and notify the sheriff 
then in the face of -PRON- protest why have -PRON- determine to pit -PRON- ski against peter accomplish the thing which -PRON- have aver could not be accomplish 
there be but one answer to this accord to peter conclusion 
markham could not bear to think that peter may succeed that -PRON- may win favorable notice from uncle sila and that -PRON- may gain some credit in the eye of hesther morton 
markham be not think of save the horse no -PRON- be impress with the idea of -PRON- own prestige and importance and -PRON- could not take a chance of lose out to a saphead 
that be all there be to -PRON- so peter believe 
a determination to win that race and save the steal stock grow strong and strong in peter breast 
here after the miserable failure at lake be a most unexpected opportunity to retrieve -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- business to make the most of -PRON- 
three straight mile lay ahead of -PRON- to the westward of the bluff 
come down the stretch like the wind -PRON- survey the shadowy opening of the swale in the hope of catch a glimpse of markham 
but the ski runner be not in sight 
in the distance the sparkle crest of bear butte could be vaguely determine yet between the bluff and the butte no dusky figure could be see toil on the ski 
-PRON- hasnot clear the bluff yet think peter exultantly lead -PRON- by ginger 
the river at the end of the threemile stretch describe a curve like a gigantic horseshoe 
in -PRON- first begin the stream have attempt to run west by south meet the rough country -PRON- course have be deflect toward the northwest then strike the widespreading base of bear butte -PRON- have follow northeast and east on -PRON- way around the huge uplift 
on clear the butte the puyallup strike off due northwest and so in a dozen mile come to roscommon 
peter although -PRON- have not time -PRON- know -PRON- have be make excellent speed 
-PRON- be seventeen mile from the ranch and come rapidly under the shadow of the butte 
markham could scarcely climb the massive rise and glissade into roscommon ahead of -PRON- 
so far as -PRON- have be able to discover markham be not yet anywhere near bear butte i say peter 
peter be amazed 
above -PRON- ringing steel a sharp cry echo in the frosty air 
-PRON- be voice and call -PRON- name 
peter dig into the ice with the heel of -PRON- runner and come to a quick halt 
that -PRON- porter -PRON- call 
yes nix in hard luck 
stop a minute will -PRON- 
the voice come from a shadowy overhang at the butte foot 
peter skate toward the black cavity and be meet by the dusky figure of markham limp out of the darkness and across the ice 
markham have -PRON- ski under -PRON- arm 
by george cry peter 
-PRON- get here in a hurry wrong fall from a sixfoot bank as i be cross the river and splinter one of -PRON- ski be the answer and i canot go on with the wood runner 
i reckon take -PRON- skate markham add coolly 
peter catch -PRON- breath reckon -PRON- wonot -PRON- return with spirit go on to roscommon start the sheriff and a posse for the dry wash and get a doctor for bailey 
what do -PRON- take -PRON- for a plain everyday saphead say markham 
down on the ice peter and off with those skate 
pronto be the word no time to lose 
markham have drop the ski and strip a glove from -PRON- right hand 
the bare hand be in the pocket of -PRON- leather coat 
suddenly as the two stand face each other the hand emerge from the pocket with a short uglylooking bulldog revolver 
markham level the weapon and the moonlight glint frostily on the barrel 
again peter catch -PRON- breath 
-PRON- be daze bewilder 
to be threaten in that manner by one whom -PRON- have believe to be a friendor if not a friend at least a fellow employee of uncle silas goddard with interest in a decided shock 
-PRON- crazy porter demand peter when -PRON- could find -PRON- tongue 
hardly be the reply with a husky illomene laugh -PRON- will be a long time before -PRON- reach roscommon -PRON- laddybuck 
take off those skate i tell -PRON- 
i mean business peter 
there be that in word and manner which leave no doubt of the fact that -PRON- mean business 
peter be wild with indignation and anger but -PRON- be also helpless 
reece bailey say to this when i tell -PRON- -PRON- ask drop to the ice and work at the skate strap cross that bridge when -PRON- get to -PRON- be the response 
throw the skate over here when -PRON- get -PRON- off 
-PRON- have to butt into this deal with the fool suggestion of get word to the sheriff now blame -PRON- take -PRON- medicine bind to win grunt peter if -PRON- have to do -PRON- with a gun 
-PRON- ainot square markham 
i may be a good deal of a saphead but i find when -PRON- be too late that one of -PRON- ski and one of -PRON- skate strap have be tamper with at lake 
-PRON- do that 
why didnot -PRON- tell hesther about -PRON- jeer markham or the judge of the contest -PRON- have nerve enough to put up a holler 
peter give the skate a shove across the ice 
ten foot away markham sit down to screw the skate to -PRON- heel and adjust the strap 
the revolver lie at -PRON- side and -PRON- watch peter sharply as -PRON- work 
peter a desperate purpose form in -PRON- mind be await the moment when -PRON- could spring to the attack 
-PRON- be not to be conquer in that way 
there be plenty of fight in -PRON- and markham would discover -PRON- to -PRON- cost 
markham work rapidly 
the skate be on and snugly buckle and -PRON- be just rise when peter go after -PRON- with a short run and a slide 
but if peter be quick markham be a shade quicker 
crack the revolver explode in the air and peter left arm seem suddenly to have be scorch with a hot iron 
the shock cause -PRON- to lose -PRON- footing and -PRON- fall in a sprawl on the slippery surface of the river 
-PRON- would have -PRON- shout markham fiercely something more for -PRON- to tell bailey 
the last word fade in mellow ring of slide steel 
peter sit up on the ice and clasp -PRON- numbed arm with -PRON- right hand watch markham slip from sight around the curve at the foot of bear butte 
peter be think less of the pain in -PRON- arm than -PRON- be of the rascally work of peter markham 
the fellow must be mad to make such an attack 
-PRON- have plan the whole thing of course and have arm -PRON- before leave reach the butte ahead of peter -PRON- have go into hiding against the moment peter should come skate down the river 
then by way of make -PRON- treachery more contemptible -PRON- have call to peter for help only to threaten -PRON- with a revolver and steal -PRON- skate 
-PRON- bet tell bailey mutter peter reckon thisll cook -PRON- goose with goddard even if -PRON- do get to roscommon in time to have the sheriff head off the bronk 
what can a fellow make of a man like -PRON- act thataway 
with difficulty peter remove -PRON- coat and shove up the shirt and sweater sleeve 
the wound be in the forearm and be bleed profusely 
with a bandanna handkerchief -PRON- bind up the injury tightly knot the handkerchief corner with -PRON- finger and -PRON- tooth then get into -PRON- coat again -PRON- begin consider -PRON- next move 
-PRON- be twelve mile by river to roscommon and eighteen mile back to the ranch 
even if -PRON- be now useless for -PRON- to get to the town in order to carry the news of the horse steal to the sheriff return to would have be a fierce pull on -PRON- strength and -PRON- dare not attempt -PRON- 
-PRON- would make -PRON- way to roscommon 
if -PRON- could reach the settlement before markham leave -PRON- -PRON- would lodge a complaint against the treacherous scoundrel and have -PRON- hold in the town jail 
peter be burn for revenge 
yes that be what -PRON- would do 
-PRON- get up feel a little dizzy and faint and start down the river 
-PRON- foot strike against ski and another idea come to -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- could tinker up the splintered ski and use the runner 
after the accident that have lose -PRON- the jump at lake peter have buy a little fine wire for the mending of -PRON- own broken runner 
that wire be still in -PRON- trouser pocket and -PRON- may be that -PRON- could use -PRON- in fix splintered ski 
pick up both runner and hold the damage one between -PRON- knee -PRON- strike a match and make a careful examination 
the stout ash have be crack under the bind mechanism 
a few wrap of fine wire may yet make the runner serve 
with -PRON- jackknife peter dig a shallow groove across the ski bottom and in this -PRON- imbed the half dozen coil of wire that -PRON- wove over and over and make fast on the upper surface 
for -PRON- -PRON- have never fancy that bilgeri bind 
although light and well make -PRON- be not nearly so strong or dependable as the lilienfield bind with which peter own ski be equip 
peter work have be do at a tremendous disadvantage 
-PRON- could work with one hand only and in lieu of -PRON- other hand -PRON- make shift to use -PRON- tooth 
the moon although brilliant leave much to be desire in the matter of light for such fine and exact labor and sense of touch have to help -PRON- where that of sight fail 
in the main however -PRON- do very well all thing consider and when -PRON- have secure -PRON- foot in the binding -PRON- arise on the ash runner with a feeling of exultation in -PRON- breast 
where be the stick 
-PRON- search for -PRON- carry -PRON- to the overhang and there -PRON- find not only the ski stick but two strip of gunny sack each heavily knot in the middle 
those strip of sack rather puzzle peter 
markham have bring -PRON- as an aid in get up the steep eastern slope of the butte 
but why have -PRON- prepare -PRON- with -PRON- if -PRON- object be to waylay peter and secure the skate 
markham always figure a matter out both way peter reflect 
-PRON- bring the gun to help corral the skate but if i happen to beat -PRON- to the butte then -PRON- would have to keep right on over the rise 
if -PRON- couldnot do one thing then -PRON- be ready to do the other more -PRON- splinter that ski apurpose and -PRON- didnot do -PRON- until -PRON- know i be behind -PRON- at the overhang 
-PRON- didnot want -PRON- to have a chance to use the ski that s all 
-PRON- never occur to -PRON- that have something along to use in patchin up the runner once anyhow that a saphead fool -PRON- 
peter shuffle -PRON- way to a point beyond the overhang then pause to tie the strip of cloth around the ski knot side down 
this maneuver would help to keep -PRON- from slide backward 
-PRON- flash an upward look at the difficult grade -PRON- be to negotiate 
if -PRON- heart fail -PRON- for a moment because of -PRON- useless arm and the shock -PRON- whole body have suffer because of the wound -PRON- only result in let -PRON- get a firm grip on -PRON- resolution and strength 
the wound be nothing serious be merely a clean gash through the fleshy part of the forearm 
-PRON- would not allow -PRON- to endanger the success of -PRON- night exploit 
markham must be make to suffer for -PRON- lawlessness and -PRON- be up to peter to see that -PRON- do not escape 
the first easy slope of the butte be take just as one may travel over level forward movement in long gliding step 
the ski be merely advanced never lift 
as the ascent stiffen peter turn out the end of the runner slightly in what be know as the half fishbone step 
there be a trick in this and peter have long since acquire -PRON- 
steep and steeper become the course as the snowy slope be climb and the full fishbone step be gradually bring into requisition 
for such a long ascent the work be extremely tiring and peter be force to do a number of serpentine tack back and forth and execute the difficult about face at each turn 
a good deal of time be require in make the climb but peter handicap of awkwardness have teach -PRON- how to be patient and doggedly resolute in carry out -PRON- aim 
-PRON- keep unflinchingly to -PRON- tiresome task and in due course be reward by find -PRON- on the flat crest of bear butte ready for the long glissade 
by this time -PRON- sport blood be arouse and -PRON- look forward with keen enjoyment to the breathlessly swift glide that lie ahead of -PRON- 
-PRON- rest a few moment tuck the hand of -PRON- injured arm into the front of -PRON- coat remove the knot strip from the runner take firm hold of the ski stick and then let -PRON- over the butte crest 
with ski so close together that -PRON- touch the point of one lead the other by a foot body not bent but incline forward peter be off down the steep slope like a bullet out of a gun 
-PRON- be at a disadvantage in not have both hand for use with the stick 
where -PRON- be necessary to brake and avoid a small crevasse or a bowlder peter do -PRON- entirely with the ski by execute the telemark swing 
-PRON- be not often that -PRON- be confront by such an emergency but -PRON- be proficient in that method of dodge possible disaster and unhesitatingly avail -PRON- of -PRON- 
at lightning speed -PRON- shoot down the butte the air hum in -PRON- ear and snowy particle sting -PRON- face 
-PRON- exhilaration mount high and high 
in -PRON- delight over the coasting -PRON- forget the steal horse the treachery of markham and the reprisal -PRON- be count upon when -PRON- should reach roscommon 
-PRON- every faculty be call into play and busy -PRON- with the fly ski to the exclusion of everything else 
the slope flatten and peter speed lessen perceptibly although -PRON- be still go at a rate comparable to that of a limited express train 
on and on mile after mile -PRON- sensation be that of one fall through space 
-PRON- scarcely realize that -PRON- have any connection whatever with the whiteclad earth beneath -PRON- 
at last in the distance -PRON- see a twinkling light and a confused blur of building 
roscommon 
the town jump toward -PRON- as though crazily bent on foul -PRON- course 
-PRON- give rather more attention to roscommon than to the slope ahead of -PRON- and suddenly -PRON- pitch into the air as the runner hit an obstacle 
-PRON- fall with the ski braid around -PRON- neck fall hard upon the clear track of the roscommon railroad yard and so suddenly that -PRON- have no time to realize -PRON- have go over the embankment at the side of the network of rail 
instinctively -PRON- try to lift -PRON- only to drop in an awkward huddle with a blaze of shoot star crisscross before -PRON- eye 
then the bright light fade and nixon peter quietly go to sleep 
when peter awake -PRON- find -PRON- on a bench in the railroad station 
a local train be expect and there have be man on the station platform when peter shoot over the railroad embankment and hit the track 
three or four of the man go forward to investigate the strange phenomenon and -PRON- be the one who have bring peter into the waiting room 
-PRON- have no more than lay -PRON- down and strip off -PRON- ski when -PRON- open -PRON- eye 
sheriff go to the dry wash yet -PRON- inquire faintly 
a man bent over -PRON- 
jordan the sheriff say -PRON- 
what dry wash do -PRON- mean 
why should i go there 
markham reach town go on peter see a thing of markham 
oh 
jordan exclaim know -PRON- now 
-PRON- be man peter from the morton ranch 
why be -PRON- slide into town at this time o night on a pair of ski 
thunder 
-PRON- be as much as -PRON- life be worth 
-PRON- gang of horse thief run off -PRON- fifty of -PRON- cut in peter wildly 
-PRON- happen early in the evening 
get a posse jordan and head off the gang at long knife dry wash 
when markham show up leave somebody in town to arrest -PRON- 
-PRON- shoot -PRON- in the arm 
and send a doctor to to look after bailey wound too 
then peter go to sleep again 
when -PRON- next come to -PRON- and pick up the chain of event -PRON- be in a bed in a room at the roscommon house 
broad day look in at the room window and peter could gaze dreamily out at roof cover with snow and sparkle under the sun ray as though cover with diamond 
hour have pass since -PRON- have have the brief awakening in the railroad station 
now -PRON- be in a comfortable bed -PRON- left arm neatly bandage and toynbee the proprietor of the hotel be sit beside -PRON- 
do -PRON- get markham toynbee ask peter 
the landlord be read a newspaper 
-PRON- jump in -PRON- chair as the unexpected word reach -PRON- from the bed 
oh -PRON- be back eh say -PRON- be a long time on the road although the doctor say -PRON- neednot to mind 
get markham 
well i guess 
and toynbee chuckle 
jordan get -PRON- and four other along with the steal horse 
-PRON- be push through the dry wash when the sheriff and -PRON- party arrive there 
-PRON- bet -PRON- get -PRON- peter and redhande at that 
big surprise to everybody 
why markham have put the whole thing up 
-PRON- be back of the entire scheme 
-PRON- have all come out 
markham wonot talk but the rest of the gang feel different 
across the line there be man wait to take the horse and rush -PRON- off where -PRON- would never be find 
say 
i guess -PRON- ought to have a medal for what -PRON- do last night 
how be -PRON- feel anyhow 
peter be stunned 
porter markham one of the horse thief 
could peter believe -PRON- ear 
markham have have a reason for drive the horse off -PRON- foot on the return from lake 
with all the other stock take from -PRON- have be plan to make the sleigh team useless so far as a drive of twenty mile to roscommon with news for the sheriff be concerned and markham have protest against peter plan of use skate in carry an alarm to roscommon but when the method have be put into effect in spite of -PRON- markham have take to the ski and have waylay peter at the eastern foot of bear butte 
in the light of recent event the motive for that attack could be see at an even more treacherous angle scheme be not to beat peter to roscommon with news for the sheriff but to keep all knowledge of the robbery from the authority until the steal horse have be deliver across the line 
instead of make for the town after secure peter skate markham have follow the river bend beyond the town to a point where -PRON- could join -PRON- rascally confederate with the horse herd 
how do -PRON- feel peter repeat toynbee after wait a long time for a reply 
mighty nigh locoed say peter 
no wonder 
say -PRON- hit the railroad iron with -PRON- head when -PRON- go over the embankment 
any other head but -PRON- would probably have be crack 
-PRON- canot crack a saphead comment peter but not in bitterness 
next day when peter be think of get out of -PRON- bed and help drive the horse back to the ranch no less a person than uncle silas goddard walk into -PRON- room 
uncle sila be an irongray man big and broad and with a regular heart under -PRON- rib 
-PRON- have receive a telegram sign reece bailey per morton and have come to north dakota by first train 
there be greeting not those of a pleased employer for a worthy employee but more in line with what one next of kin may say in circumstance altogether creditable 
bailey be come fine and would be on the job again in two or three week and peter the doctor say would be fit as a fiddle in seven day at the outside 
the horse be on the way back to what about markham query peter 
uncle silas cheery face grow troubled 
well markham be only a boy and a very foolish one 
-PRON- have have a hard lesson 
no stock have be lose and uncle sila feel that -PRON- ought not to be too hard on markham 
-PRON- be go to let markham go on a promise to leave the country and make something of -PRON- in other part 
any one at all acquaint with uncle sila may have know -PRON- would do that very thing 
as for -PRON- nixon the big ranchowner go on a job wait in montana for a chap of -PRON- heft and disposition 
but do -PRON- want to return to the home ranch -PRON- ask quizzically 
miss hesth morton send a very kindly message to -PRON- by -PRON- 
-PRON- be sorry for a lot of thing -PRON- say and hope to see -PRON- right soon 
but nixon peter have see another light 
-PRON- recall -PRON- saphead dream of rescue hesther from a burn house and the shame red stain -PRON- cheek to the towcolored hair 
miss morton all at once be waste -PRON- consideration on the wrong party 
uncle sila say peter for montana as soon as -PRON- want -PRON- there 
good exclaimed uncle sila and clasped peter hand with a fervor that suggest not only good will but hearty congratulation 

cast away at the pole by author of little miss vassar the cotton bag the et cetera 
a -PRON- situation be not only hopeless but demoralize as well 
i realize this when i catch the professor look at -PRON- with hard and hungry eye 
what ail -PRON- prebble 
i ask straiglitene out the sleep bag with -PRON- numb finger 
-PRON- body crave nutrition -PRON- answer huskily must eat 
have -PRON- forgoiten that -PRON- divide the last ounce of pemmican yesterday 
how could i forget -PRON- i reply with this dreadful gnawing at -PRON- stomach to serve as a constant reminder something must be do -PRON- companion declare with convulsive energy 
but what 
i return 
here -PRON- be lose on the ice cap abandon by -PRON- eskimo guide sle go dog go compass break and nothing to eat but -PRON- sealskin clothe 
something must be do -PRON- say and i agree with -PRON- fully 
-PRON- join this expedition to solve problem 
solve this one 
that should have floor prebble 
but -PRON- do not have already solve this oneto -PRON- own satisfaction say -PRON- 
and again that hard and hungry look be turn on -PRON- 
what be -PRON- think of 
i demand angrily 
-PRON- give a cackling illtime laugha laugh that irritate -PRON- beyond word 
the old law of the survival of the fit will apply here -PRON- say 
in -PRON- dash for the pole captain -PRON- have attain the farth north and i have demonstrate the truth of the meteoric theory of the aurora borealis 
if i go back i can tell what -PRON- have do but -PRON- if -PRON- return to civilization without -PRON- could no more tell of -PRON- discovery than discourse in attic greek 
ergo return 
i know what -PRON- mean well enough 
but i be notready to serve as a diet for the professor even at the command of science and as for eke out -PRON- own miserable existence with a ragout la prebble iwould as soon have think of bolt the rule of three crazy i say shiveringly 
consistent -PRON- dear fellow 
see here i go on behind -PRON- be the ship and the ship crew 
when the eskimo guide get back without -PRON- search party will be send out and well be find 
but suppose the eskimo guide donot get back choose to think that -PRON- will i respond firmly not go to yield up -PRON- life to -PRON- and -PRON- meteoric theory of the aurora flat -PRON- a thought beyond -PRON- own selfish aim and ambition prebble return indignantly 
possibly i have i fling back at -PRON- tartly but i refuse to throw -PRON- away on a little old professor with a bee in -PRON- bonnet 
that be a shot that go home 
the professor sink into a morbid silence 
besides i proceed farth north doesnot satisfy -PRON- 
i shall attain the only point on this earth where the compass have but three cardinal point east west and south 
the north pole -PRON- exclaim 
madman shall attain -PRON- i fepeatd warm olow of enthusiasm pulse through -PRON- hungry body shall plant -PRON- country flag at the apex of the earth 
what good will -PRON- do vour country or any other country -PRON- ask 
-PRON- talk strangely professor i say frigidly will the discovery of the north pole benefit mankind or advance civilization a single inch consider the luster of the achievement sir 
luster of the achievement irabile dictu 
not only that i go on wave -PRON- mittened hand in a direction i believe to be south but somewhere behind -PRON- be that execrable griffyn englishman sir who have swear to beat -PRON- to the pole 
have -PRON- no pride no patriotism i have both say prebble plaintively 
i be hungry 
hungry 
the insolence of this professor fill -PRON- with wrath unutterable 
i tower above -PRON- and give -PRON- a look that send -PRON- crouch to -PRON- knee 
-PRON- lift -PRON- hand appealingly 
-PRON- nose sir say -PRON- be very white 
i leave off glare at -PRON- pick up a handful of snow and begin rub -PRON- nose 
by the time circulation be restore i find the professor have crawl into the sleep bag so i crawl in beside -PRON- thankful -PRON- have warm -PRON- up 
this particular bag be a threeman bag that be capable of hold three adult 
-PRON- be shape like an envelope opening from end to end be make of reindeer skin and have an outer covering of oiltanned sealskin the latter keep out the water and keeping in the animal heat 
i fasten the flap over the opening 
then prebble bade -PRON- an ironical good night 
the professor good night may have be ironical because of one of two thing either because of -PRON- resentment toward -PRON- or at that time of the year in the arctic continual day reign and there be no night 
which be the great achievement prebble i ask find the pole or demonstrate the truth of a meteoric theory 
there be no comparison captain salis 
find the north pole be simply a matter of brute endurance but demonstrate the truth of that theory sir involve forth all the good power of the mind 
bah sir 
i cry 
bah to -PRON- -PRON- retort 
there and then i make a mental vow that the next time i go explore in the arctic i would use more care in select the scientific member of the expedition 
prebble have a string of letter after -PRON- name abbreviate -PRON- honorable suffix and extend -PRON- to sit with the highbrow but -PRON- be about as sociable as a polar bear 
-PRON- have say good night merely to open -PRON- mutfle canversation in the sleep bag 
sometimes -PRON- be like thata human movingpicture film run through the lantern wrong end to 
i have bakd -PRON- in the hope of cut short -PRON- garrulity 
but the effort fail 
suppose -PRON- find the pole say -PRON- how be -PRON- go to know when -PRON- get there 
for a professor of -PRON- attainment observe frigidly that remark be asinine 
-PRON- cackle jeeringly 
how be -PRON- go to make sure -PRON- be at the north pole when -PRON- get there -PRON- repeat with madden insistence 
by observation 
i snap vouch for the accuracy of -PRON- observation 
-PRON- will 
-PRON- havenot any sympathy with -PRON- aim or aspiration prebble but -PRON- will have to support -PRON- in a matter of truth and verity 
if -PRON- donot -PRON- scientific reputation will suffer 
once more -PRON- cackle have be make mental note and draw deduction -PRON- proceed and from -PRON- study of human activity in the frozen world i venture a most remarkable but most scientific conclusion 
do -PRON- care to hear -PRON- 
if -PRON- have discover anything remarkable i score the event be sufficiently unique to command -PRON- attention 
out with -PRON- prebble 
listen -PRON- return in -PRON- most didactic tone 
the basis of all observation that be to command the respect and confidence of the learn public be embrace in the old statement of mei sana in corpore sanoa sound mind in a sound body 
in use -PRON- artificial horizon and work out -PRON- position -PRON- must approach the task with every faculty alert and unclouded 
certainly agree 
sali -PRON- declare no human being can undergo the awful peril and hardship of polar discovery without an overthrow of -PRON- mental poise 
bosh 
i cry 
derision say -PRON- be the fool answer to an argument prove nothing and lead nowherc 
do -PRON- mean to say i demand that i will not keep -PRON- reason 
-PRON- have not keep -PRON- -PRON- friend 
even now with the pole still far away the intense cold the terrific physical strain and the insufficient food have throw -PRON- off -PRON- mental balance 
-PRON- be not -PRON- and -PRON- have not be -PRON- for several day 
-PRON- discovery along this line lead -PRON- to propound a theory of polar aberration 
the other day -PRON- call the white snow purple 
that be a chromatic proof of fail reason rage fill -PRON- rage and indignation 
prebble cry -PRON- be the one who be lose -PRON- mind 
-PRON- another proof -PRON- continue calmly be -PRON- obstinate refusal to listen to -PRON- highly valuable suggestion 
if -PRON- mind be uncloude -PRON- would profit by -PRON- very excellent advice 
if -PRON- have -PRON- sense i answer -PRON- wouldnot think of turn cannibal merely to enable -PRON- to get back to civilization and propound -PRON- meteoric theory of the aurora 
desperate strait require desperate remedy -PRON- insist 
if -PRON- be to propound such a desperate remedy back home how long would -PRON- be before -PRON- be clap intoa straitjacket a remedy would not be propound back home -PRON- would not be necessary mad as a hatter 
i tell himand i be really begin to think so 
when a mind fail say -PRON- -PRON- be a fact of record that -PRON- believe every other mind have fail 
sali more and more -PRON- prove -PRON- contention 
the fact of record i return apply both way 
-PRON- think crazy and i know -PRON- be 
i shall discover the pole and shall convince the learn public that i have discover -PRON- 
when i get out of this bag and the ink in -PRON- fountain pen be thaw out so i can write with -PRON- put down the substance of -PRON- remark in -PRON- diary hope so -PRON- answer 
and i hope -PRON- will put -PRON- down exactly as i make -PRON- 
in -PRON- present deplorable condition however i presume that be ask too much 
thereupon -PRON- roll to one side of the bag and i roll to the other 
there be a coldness between -PRON- 
strange how little thing conspire to shape -PRON- destine here below 
but for the space which mutual intolerance place between the professor and -PRON- in that threeman sleep bag one or both of -PRON- would have be sacrifice and -PRON- sleep would have be a sleep of death 
i remember reflect bitterly on -PRON- hapless lot and dozing off by degree the professor snore fade on -PRON- ear and at last die away utterly 
how long i sleep i have no means of know but suddenly i be awaken by such a tremendous shock as i never expect to experience again and live the end of the frozen bag be bent toward each other with a great crackling so that insfead of lie prostrate i be in a sit position thrust one hand toward side of the bag only to encounter a partition of deerskin 
what have happen 
the sleep bag have suddenly acquire motionnot over the rough surface of the ice cap but apparently throughthe air 
i have a thought which chill -PRON- blood 
have the bag slip over a precipice at the edge of the ice cap 
and be -PRON- fall fall but no this could not be 
there be no precipice at the edge of the ice cap and the theory be untenable 
besides if -PRON- have be fall -PRON- would have strike something long since 
have -PRON- notice captain that -PRON- have a concentric and a lateral as well as a forward motion prebble exclaim 
be -PRON- alive 
keenly sir 
this be a most astounding phenomenon 
i now discover that the partition of reindeer hide separate the professor from -PRON- consist of a fold of the sleep bag push inward as by some hard substance 
what do -PRON- think be go on i ask 
-PRON- gyratory motion suggest a hurricane -PRON- answer 
-PRON- may be that -PRON- have be catch off the top of the ice cap by an arctic whirlwind 
can -PRON- open the flap captain 
i could and do after some little trouble 
the lengthwise slit be in front of -PRON- and -PRON- be able to look through -PRON- without a change of position 
the view be not satisfactory for a great white cloud envelop -PRON- and make -PRON- impossible to see very far in any direction 
-PRON- be suspend in gray space and move with frightful rapidity 
as -PRON- gaze out into the void a black object come rush from overhead graze the side of the sleep bag and vanish below 
-PRON- be over in a flash so quickly in fact that neither i nor -PRON- companion could determine what manner of thing the object be 
merciful power gasp 
-PRON- be bound upward muse prebble as well as onward 
can -PRON- imagine what that thing be 
i query 
possibly a missile of meteoric origin 
-PRON- be more athletic than i be captain and donot -PRON- think -PRON- could get an upward look without fall from the bag 
i crane -PRON- neck outside 
the next instang an exclamation escape -PRON- lip 
what do -PRON- see ask prebble eagerly rope 
suspend from what canot see 
the object -PRON- hang from be lose in the cloud 
by the mizzenffuck of the gr harry 
what now 
i have make a discovery that almost cause -PRON- hair to stand on end 
this sleep bag be catch on the fluke of an anchor see i see 
the sleping bag be scoop up bodily the fluke catch -PRON- in the center 
-PRON- weight on one side and -PRON- weight on the other balance the bag 
beautiful beautiful 
some aronaut be make for the pole by balloonhis drag rope sweep the ice capthe anchor catch -PRON- 
the object that dart downward a moment ago be a sandbag throw from the balloon to offset -PRON- add weight 
most remarkable 
prebble be chuckle rub -PRON- mittene hand together and thoroughly enjoy the situation some scamp be try to get ahead of griffyn and -PRON- say i crossly 
do -PRON- observe that the cold be abate inquire -PRON- companton 
the sleep bag do seem to be thaw out 
exactly 
and i be in a profuse perspiration 
prebble divest -PRON- of -PRON- mitten and parka then from somewhere about -PRON- person -PRON- produce -PRON- steelrimme spectaclesand adjust -PRON- to -PRON- nose 
ah -PRON- exclaim peer at -PRON- sharply 
-PRON- be a joy to use one glass and have -PRON- keep ciear of the frost 
do -PRON- realize what a rise thermometer mean captain say divest -PRON- mean warm weather -PRON- of a few of -PRON- fur 
also that -PRON- be sail southward at a greaf rate 
i be startle for i have not think of the rise temperature in that way 
-PRON- hope of reach the pole on that expedition be to be only a hope and nothing more 
the field be be leave clear for -PRON- rival griffyn the man who have follow -PRON- like shadow ever since leave the coast of labrador 
-PRON- bitterness of soul may be imagine but not describe 
in the gloom of the moment i forget -PRON- hunger forget thatthe professor and i werebalance on the iron horn of a dilemma that may easily prove -PRON- undoingforgot everything in fact but that i have weather that long arctic night and bear innumerable hardship all to nno purpose 
-PRON- enter the domain of the improbable come the remark of the professor break in upon -PRON- unpleasant reflection 
hard luck have a domain of -PRON- own say glare from -PRON- niche into and -PRON- so commonplace -PRON- canot call -PRON- improbable 
-PRON- do not grasp -PRON- meaning captain -PRON- companion proceed 
if -PRON- be to give any one in the temperate zone a true account of this adventure -PRON- statement would be dismiss with a shrugif with nothing bad 
-PRON- would have to back up -PRON- statement prebble 
-PRON- scientific standing would bolster up -PRON- integrity as a navigator and donot know about that 
i fall back aghast 
pick off the ice cap by a balloon and carry southward on the fluke of an anhor i have be meditate an indictiment against some reckless aronaut 
the term of that indictment be to set -PRON- right before those who have help finance -PRON- expedition 
what do -PRON- mean i rasp angrily know -PRON- have no sympathy with -PRON- poar aim and ambition but -PRON- canot deny the evidence of -PRON- sense 
captain -PRON- return be doubt the evidence of -PRON- sense 
north of the arctic circle the human faculty become frozen and unrelable 
i do not credit -PRON- present do not dare 
poppycock 
i cry inwrathful impatience -PRON- be under the spell of the purple snow -PRON- go on adventure seem very real to -PRON- because -PRON- hardship have create illusion 
all -PRON- life i have fight against be lead astray by illusionsand under the pole star lie the abode of thing that seem but be not mad as a hatter 
i storm 
not mad sali -PRON- protest mildly but temporarily unbalanced 
-PRON- be in the same state of mind 
i see -PRON- wriggle around in -PRON- half of the sleep bag punching and pinch -PRON- 
really -PRON- seem -PRON- have an idea that -PRON- be asleep and dream these very momentous event see -PRON- shake -PRON- head forebodingly upon be force to the conclusion that -PRON- be wide awake a scientific freak prebble i jeer be try in -PRON- feeble way -PRON- answer to combat error 
-PRON- be try to give reason the lie what -PRON- amount to 
when -PRON- brain be clear captain -PRON- will consider -PRON- action differently 
-PRON- be be snatch southward at a pace which should soon carry -PRON- out of these region of illusion i observe 
then if -PRON- be still in this sleep bag and balance across the fluke of the anchor i suppose -PRON- will have to believe what -PRON- see 
-PRON- make no response but i could see that -PRON- word have throw -PRON- into a brown study 
and i continue bitterly while -PRON- be bind for the prosy land of reality and truth -PRON- rival for polar honor be press forward into the white world of enchantment where -PRON- will probably discover what i have spend the well part of -PRON- life look for let that fact distress -PRON- captain say prebble 
griffyn may think -PRON- have find the pole and -PRON- may even get back to civilization to tell of itbut who will believe -PRON- 
these word although i know -PRON- to be farfetche and far from dependable give -PRON- a thrill of delight 
if -PRON- own statement and figure regard the discovery of the pole be not to be offer in evidence i take pleasure in see the report of -PRON- rival completely discredit 
the sentiment be unworthy i grant but i be human and have the customary human failing anyhow captain proceed prebble -PRON- have a contract with a newspaper a contract with a magazine and a contract with a lecture bureau 
out of these various contract -PRON- will be able to amass a fortune even if -PRON- find the pole 
griffyn even though -PRON- be successful will be discredit 
-PRON- be an exofficer of the army and the army will be behind -PRON- 
griffyn be only a poor devil who take a chance on reach the pole because -PRON- happne to find the way open 
nobody will believe griflyn 
if -PRON- claim only the farth north everybody will believe youin spite of the fact that -PRON- may not believe in -PRON- 
this be foolish talk prebble i declare 
-PRON- ought to be above such random conversation 
in -PRON- mind however i be already plan -PRON- newspaper and magazine article and be figure on the result of that lecture campaign 
there be a possibility that i should receive the thanksof congress and a medal 
-PRON- heart begin to thaw out even as the frost be melt away from the sleep bag 
-PRON- motion through space be easy and exhilarating 
-PRON- be like fly through the sky on downy bed of ease 
swinge through the air and cover the mile with magical swiftness be vastly different from trek with dog and sledge over the broken floe and make great detour to avoid open lead of water 
-PRON- be go southward and the result of -PRON- daring and -PRON- peril have be merely the attainment of the farth north 
although the fact be deplorable -PRON- have -PRON- amenity i give -PRON- over to a long period o contemplation 
in the course of -PRON- thought i find occasion to dwell at some length on the arrival of this mysterious balloon 
who be the aronaut and where have -PRON- come from 
quite naturally i could formulate no answer to these mental query 
hour pass then suddenly -PRON- companion reach over the partition and touch -PRON- shoulder 
the cloud be vanish -PRON- say out and look upward captain 
i obey 
high above -PRON- be the huge bulk of a balloon and visible over the rim of the wickerwork car suspend beneath be the face of two man whom i know only too well 
i be speechless for a moment 
then a cry of rage escape -PRON- 
sali by jupiter boom a voice from overhead 
griffyn 
i shout 
what an irony of fate 
-PRON- enemy and -PRON- secretary be the aronaut and -PRON- be theiranchor that have hook into -PRON- sleep bag 
prebble clasp -PRON- bony hand convulsively didnot know that griffyn have a balloon -PRON- mutter hoarsely 
for sake captain be amiable 
be silence 
i command 
-PRON- have take an underhand advantage of -PRON- captain sali -PRON- enemy call down 
-PRON- have attach -PRON- to -PRON- anchor sirrah with never so much as a by -PRON- leave 
-PRON- conduct be unprofessional and i shall make -PRON- know to the member of the arctic club 
if i have want to take -PRON- with -PRON- i should have invite -PRON- 
be a sailor i have a supply of language for just such an emergency as this 
before i could release the torrent of word however griffyn -PRON- last infamy be -PRON- saidhad reach -PRON- hand from the basket and have sever the drag rope with a keen knife 
down -PRON- drop through the depth of space down down the wind shriek in -PRON- ear and -PRON- brain reel 
then a shock a roar as of a hundred niagara and after thatoblivion 
where be -PRON- 
that be -PRON- first question 
-PRON- fall instinctively from -PRON- lip and be address to no one in particular 
i be a very much bewilder man 
as i recline on the ground and make use of -PRON- startled eye to -PRON- right i see a pond circular in form and perhaps fifty yard in diameter 
this pond be edge with block of white stone in the center of -PRON- stand a graven figure of colossal proportion a jet of water spout from -PRON- uplifted hand 
rosebush in full bloom border the lake and back of the rosebush separate by a stretch of white sand grow palm tree toss -PRON- fronde top in the balmy air 
bird sing in the depth of the grove and a genial heat pervade the atmosphere 
i rub -PRON- foreheadwater 
hye from the sleeve of -PRON- soaked coat as i raise -PRON- hand 
where be -PRON- 
i ask again this time in a loud key 
marvelous croon a familiar voice behind -PRON- be the balloon be -PRON- be the lake and the way -PRON- get out divide from a goes into i look around and there kneel that bless old professor wet as a rat trace algebraic symbol in the sand with -PRON- finger 
professor i call avast with -PRON- foolish ness and try to make a guess as to where -PRON- be 
-PRON- look up at -PRON- blankly 
water from -PRON- drench garment have rille around -PRON- in the sandy soil and be run down -PRON- arm and off the index finger that be trace the symbol 
still on -PRON- knee over the unsolved equation -PRON- allow -PRON- eye to wander from -PRON- toward -PRON- surrounding fountain -PRON- say 
really a most admirable work of art and -PRON- spout fresh water say freeingy -PRON- lung of a mouthful of -PRON- 
the lake -PRON- go on run -PRON- gaze oven the circular stone border show calculation and design carry out with engineering skill and a rare eye for beauty correct i agree 
rose in full bloom -PRON- proceed 
the air be redolent of odor that be soothe and delightful 
exactly i return 
-PRON- must have make a tremendous southing on the fluke of that anchor 
palm tree suggest the tropic 
suggest -PRON- answer grant -PRON- but -PRON- be a suggestion -PRON- must adopt warily 
the league upon league that lie between the arctic circle and the equator could not have be cover by -PRON- on the fluke of the anchor 
l know that say and i wish -PRON- would exercise -PRON- wit and make a guess at -PRON- present position bewilder 
one thing at a time captain -PRON- admonish bend over -PRON- problem be the balloon be -PRON- have become of the balloon i cut in searchmg the sky for some 5ign of the sky wanderer 
prebble frown and again look up 
bus -PRON- do not rise 
when -PRON- be cut away captain -PRON- explain the immense weight suddenly release from the balloon cause -PRON- to mount to extraordimary height 
this warm air too would have -PRON- effect on the gas in the bag expand -PRON- and give -PRON- tremendous buoyancy 
griffyn be sail on 
and southward i chuckle 
the scoundrel drop -PRON- by the way and i be glad -PRON- have part company 
in -PRON- rage -PRON- be at least leave -PRON- nearer the pole than -PRON- be -PRON- 
the professor frown thoughtfully 
griffyn must have come from the north captain -PRON- observe 
in order to pick -PRON- off the ice cap and bear -PRON- south griffyn must have come out of the north 
the professor logic paralyze -PRON- 
do -PRON- thinkis -PRON- possible -PRON- tongue clove to the roof of -PRON- mouth and i could carry the ditressing word no further 
do i think finish the professor that -PRON- have discover the pole and that -PRON- be come away from -PRON- when the anchor pick -PRON- up 
that be an open question an open question 
-PRON- need not concern -PRON- about -PRON- once more -PRON- begin -PRON- movement over the sand be the balloon be but i do concern -PRON- about -PRON- 
i shout 
if griffyn have find the pole i donot believe i can ever get over -PRON- 
prebble be annoy by -PRON- interruption and jab -PRON- finger angrily into the symbol b 
remember what i have already tell -PRON- sali -PRON- flare 
nobody will believe griyn find the pole even if -PRON- claim the honor 
-PRON- canot proveit 
-PRON- observation will be faulty anyhow would -PRON- be possible to take observation from a balloon travel as fast as that one 
the airship be the sport of the wind 
be -PRON- possible that the wind carry griffyn to the pole 
exercise reason sali 
then -PRON- admit that -PRON- reasoning be to be trust 
i inquire 
-PRON- be in a tropical clime 
the frozen ice field have be leave behind -PRON- 
the result of -PRON- calculation can not be nip by the 
rost 
i that be not the case why should i be qtraoglmo to work out a problem that have to do with -PRON- rescue from the lake 
amuse -PRON- sali and leave -PRON- to -PRON- labor 
professor say be in a land that be inhabit by people well advanced in the art and science 
what -PRON- see prove -PRON- 
instead of waste -PRON- energy try to work out a trifling problem would -PRON- not be well to stroll off somewhere and look for some one who can tell -PRON- what -PRON- want to know 
-PRON- be still annoy still fretful 
that equation have obsess -PRON- and -PRON- be not to be draw aw ay from -PRON- 
one thing at a time -PRON- answer 
let -PRON- meet -PRON- problem as -PRON- come to -PRON- 
-PRON- be sure of the present but -PRON- can not predicate certain of the future 
if -PRON- have business any place else sali donot let -PRON- detain -PRON- a moment 
-PRON- wave -PRON- hand to command silence 
in disgust i turn from -PRON- and search the distance with wonder eye 
fortune have be extremely kind to the professor and -PRON- there be no gainsaying that 
cut joose from the balloon by the murderous hand of griffyn -PRON- have from space 
apparently -PRON- line have fall in pleasant place 
i say apparently for presently something happen which prove -PRON- position be not so secure as i have imagine 
a sound reach -PRON- earsa sound as of a stealthy movement 
i whirl on the professor 
-PRON- have not leave -PRON- kneeling posture but be gabble to -PRON- and oblivious of everything but -PRON- foolish problem and behind -PRON- good heaven 
what i see behind the professor steal upon -PRON- with deadly intent be a figure such as i have never before encounter outside of a hideous nightmare 
seven foot the figure stand if -PRON- stand an inch -PRON- walk upright and bear a striking resemblance to man have two arm two leg a head and feature more or less human 
but -PRON- be cover from top to toe with a fine reddish hair the hair of the scalp long and flow mg about the shoulder save for a bearskin twist around -PRON- middle the monster be entirely nude 
how -PRON- eye snappgd and glow in the furry recess of -PRON- face 
and as -PRON- steal toward the professor with catlike tread -PRON- raise a long spear with a shimmering point poise the weapon 
i try to shout a warning but -PRON- tongue clove to the roof of -PRON- mough 
i try again and this time i manage to gurgle incoherently 
the professor peer in -PRON- direction 
i flutter a hand toward the impending danger and -PRON- turn around 
ha -PRON- gasp 
miss link 
speech return to -PRON- 
with -PRON- come the thought that unless i put the professor peril into term -PRON- could instantly comprehend -PRON- be lose be the miss link i cry b be the spear and be -PRON- 
a divide -PRON- from b go into and be what become of prebble 
-PRON- give a yell of horror and 
fall flat 
chug 
as -PRON- drop the spear flash through the air above -PRON- head and bury -PRON- point in the sand 
this danger have hurl -PRON- upon -PRON- with paralyze suddenness 
i have succeed in master -PRON- nerve however and be able to deal actively with the situation 
in a twinkling i spring for the spear jerk -PRON- from the ground and balance -PRON- in -PRON- hand as i face the hairy demon kill -PRON- captaindonot cry prebble excitedly 
really -PRON- s a most remarkable speciman and -PRON- must take -PRON- back with -PRON- 
the thing crouch in front of -PRON- eye burnmg like twin coal and muscle work with an itch to spring a gigantic gorilla 
i declare 
nonsense return prebble as much above the gorilla as -PRON- be below man 
-PRON- think be paoan god and be bent on test -PRON- mvulnerability 
careful what vou do captain 
-PRON- complete the darwinian chain darwinian fiddlestick i cut in out of patience 
calm -PRON- sir 
tortune favor -PRON- when -PRON- be cut loose from the balloon 
-PRON- fall into that lake and this creature must have pull -PRON- out 
if -PRON- have want to slay -PRON- why didnot -PRON- do so while -PRON- be unconscious and entirely at -PRON- mercy 
observe captain 
prebble get up and look the hairy monster in the eye hungry -PRON- say make motion with -PRON- hand and jaw as though eat famish 
what kind of a pagan god do -PRON- imagine -PRON- will think vou if -PRON- find -PRON- be hungry demand so say the professor 
-PRON- lucubration captain occasionally evolve something that be particularly apt 
just then the monster roar aloud 
the mighty sound go echo through the grove and be answer in kind from a dozen different point 
-PRON- be undo 
i groan as a whole pack of the fiend appear and race toward -PRON- in full cry from every quarter 
i be not blind to the incongruity of the situa tion 
although no judge of art i know full well that the colossus in the center of the lake be beyond the craft of these halfnake creature whose facial angle be small improvement on those of the orangutan 
grant that these man brute be subject of a ruling race where be the real lord of the country or some one in authority to whom -PRON- could make appeal 
prebble and i be face to face with death in a most horrible form 
the red demon be rush upon -PRON- snarl and yelping like so many bloodhound -PRON- spear level and ready to impale -PRON- 
-PRON- could not take to tree for the attack force be between -PRON- and the grove 
nor could -PRON- retreat for the lake lie behind -PRON- 
-PRON- doom be seal 
i feel -PRON- in every fiber yet i would not shame the glorious tradition ofthe american sailor by stand supinely and allow -PRON- to be spear 
the last ditch for -PRON- 
grip the haft of -PRON- sevenfoot lance i hold -PRON- at attention 
consider that the world be to lose an exhaustive paper on the meteoric theory of the aurora and a thesis on the miss link prebble carry -PRON- admirably 
thirty second of life captain say -PRON- -PRON- be get ready to thiow 
only one of -PRON- be to throw say look 
that hulkig imp with the ring in -PRON- ear be to have the first cast 
see -PRON- rise on one foot -PRON- throw -PRON- backhe let the spear y i watch every faculty whet to abnormal keenness 
the weapon dart toward -PRON- -PRON- bright point cleave the air like a jet of fire 
i strike at -PRON- wildly 
fate be kind and i counter the shaft swerve -PRON- sideways and send -PRON- hiss into the water of the lake 
the fatal moment be postpone that be all 
clench -PRON- tooth i wait for the next enemy to step to the front and make a trial 
captain quaver the professor clutch -PRON- arm convulsively have this forget about -PRON- a revolver 
prebble be hold -PRON- out to -PRON- in -PRON- shake hand 
a shout escape -PRON- lige down the spear i clutch the firearm and before a second savage could launch a shaft i have fire 
the effect of that shot be tremendous 
the bullet do not find a markmy nerve be not steady enough for accurate shootingbut the report be allsufficient of the uncanny creature fall face downward and lie groveling on the earth now prebble cry sharply run for -PRON- life 
the woodsthe wood 
-PRON- start and have almost gain the shelter of the tree when a second detachment of the enemy appear before -PRON- 
i present the revolver and pull the trigger but only an omi rnious click follow 
again and again i try but without success the cylinder be empty 
togmlfchaqua pura mix with the ammumtion say the professor sagely 
thar hath in the lake must have disable the firearm a wonder captain that -PRON- be able to fire even a single shot 
a very pretty problem suggest -PRON- and i 
look 
i cry interrupt -PRON- idle chattbr in a frenzy elevate -PRON- spear point be dead man in a dozen tick of the watch unless -PRON- can do something to save -PRON- be at the end of -PRON- resource declare the professor calmly 
but i be not 
an idea flash over -PRON- and i begin pufte -PRON- into execution without delziy 
with a hop skip and jump i start a grotesque dance hop up and down wave -PRON- arm and grimace as horribly as i know how 
the professor watch -PRON- in a sort of fascination 
i see wonder in -PRON- face and then dismay and something very like anguish 
but i also see the lift spear of the red rabble poise motionless in midair 
that be the result for which i be work and i redouble -PRON- exertion scream prebble be afraid of this 
i know -PRON- be unbalanced 
i know -PRON- mind be trend toward this deplorable condition but i have not expect such violence 
get busy prebble 
i pant pirouette on -PRON- toe and throw off a small cascade of water as i whirl 
-PRON- poor friend wail prebble clasp -PRON- hand and strike an attitude of extreme dejection 
go to -PRON- 
pffe show off a few buckandwing step a pair of dance dervish prebble 
reel -PRON- off manreel -PRON- off 
the spear still hang motionless in the air 
i have the hairy monster guess for -PRON- contoetion be make a powerful appeal to -PRON- aboriginal mind 
the professor hurry toward -PRON- and lay an implore hand on -PRON- arm 
if -PRON- must die captain sali -PRON- beg let -PRON- go decently and as become intelligent man be an idiot 
i fling back -PRON- see that do this for a purpose purpose the professor answer 
what purpose can such crazy antic serve resemble a coupie of pincushion by now prebble if i hadnot start this fandangd 
the word be fairly jolt ouit of -PRON- as i totter around first on one foot and then on the other see this trick work on the incian 
all barbarian particularly those who be low in the human scale have a sperstitious eration for person who be crazy 
the idea pop into -PRON- head and i begin to carry -PRON- out 
-PRON- see what an effect -PRON- be have 
-PRON- enemy have now drop -PRON- spear point and be gaze at -PRON- curiously 
-PRON- imagine remark the professor study the savage with a gooddeal of interest -PRON- be some sort of an evil deity donot care what -PRON- imagine say just so -PRON- keep -PRON- distance and donot use -PRON- spear 
how long do -PRON- think -PRON- can keep that up donot know i answer hope i can keep -PRON- up until somethingor other happen to insure -PRON- safety indenitely 
the professor be showig no disposition to join -PRON- in the dance 
-PRON- be only when the savage execute a movement en masse toward the right and lift -PRON- spear for a throw at -PRON- that -PRON- leap into terpsichorean effort 
-PRON- require no ufging from -PRON- 
-PRON- be quick to perceive the danger and equally quick toresont to the only mean for avert -PRON- 
round and round -PRON- whirl exemplify everything from a double shuffle to hornpipe and a highland fle 
this be monstrous wail the protessor step high 
what a performance for a man of -PRON- professional standing 
sali have never feel more humiliate in -PRON- life 
keep -PRON- up 
i beg of -PRON- hoarsely 
when -PRON- give out and have to drop feign a fit 
if -PRON- do -PRON- well -PRON- may save -PRON- 
at that moment when the spear be again lift the savage who have be routedpear the lake by the report of the revolver come war ily upon the scene 
by a wide detour -PRON- avoid -PRON- and join the one who be threaten -PRON- be something do now gasp hoarsely savage who just come will tell the other about the report of the revolver say prebble hopefully and that will so awe those who be hostile that -PRON- will be spare and allow to go in peace 
but the professor be wrong 
instead of the late comer inspire fear in -PRON- comrade by tell of the explode firearm the other side seem to get the good of the argument 
both party present a united front what be bad -PRON- exhibition of fancy dancing seerpe to have lose -PRON- charm 
the hostility wheeze the professor to have become general 
all hand be make ready to comc at -PRON- i whisper to be do sali 
can -PRON- run useless 
spear would lay -PRON- low before -PRON- have take a dozen leap toward the sky line may as well stop this foolish dancing 
yes and -PRON- both stagger to a stop like top that have all but run down 
i face the desperate situation with all the fortitude i could muster 
die like a man prebble i gasp all -PRON- can do now 
another moment and -PRON- should have fall pierce by half a dozen spear but the unexpected happen 
out from the shadow of the palm tree glide a form jn white halt between -PRON- and the threatening spear point and raise one hand commandingly 
instantly every spear point drop and the form in white turn slowly and survey -PRON- 
-PRON- protector be a woman 
-PRON- delicate feature the shelllike tint of -PRON- cheek -PRON- long sunny hair -PRON- graceful form all testify to that 
-PRON- be clothe in a cling robe of white edge with gold galloon buskin of white and gold cover -PRON- small foot and around -PRON- brow be a gold ribbon 
-PRON- wear no head cover and -PRON- wealth of yellow tress flow about hern like a veil even to -PRON- waist 
never have i behold such rare loveliness and twenty year of sea have not blunt -PRON- appreciation of the divine in woman 
an exclamation of astonishment and admiration fall from -PRON- lip 
nor be the astonishment all on -PRON- part 
surprise and wonder be mirror in the woman wide blue eye 
although thankful for -PRON- timely intervention i would have have -PRON- meeting with -PRON- occur unaer ippier auspex 
a young be but be particular how -PRON- come under the eye of beauty and -PRON- watersoaked clothe and disheveled appearance make -PRON- position most embarrassing 
prebble do not seem to mind -PRON- -PRON- be smirk and rub -PRON- hand and pushmg -PRON- forward in a way that irritate -PRON- 
thank -PRON- kindly say -PRON- bob -PRON- head and flash -PRON- bald pate in -PRON- eye the owner of these beautiful ground madam -PRON- language be not her 
-PRON- stare at the professor blankly and then shift -PRON- gaze to -PRON- 
-PRON- smile 
small wonder -PRON- smile with -PRON- learned companion ogling and duck and make a display of -PRON- hungry whimper the professor convey imaginary thing to -PRON- mouth and work -PRON- jaw famish -PRON- turn to -PRON- with an unwonted lusterin -PRON- eye 
-PRON- canot deceive -PRON- into thinking -PRON- be pagan god -PRON- impart 
this be paradise captain and -PRON- be one of the peri 
stop -PRON- tomfoolery say petulantly 
-PRON- spectacle be hang from one of -PRON- ear one of -PRON- mukluk be go and -PRON- look as though -PRON- have be through a cyclone laugh at -PRON- 
at -PRON- -PRON- titter 
both of -PRON- mukluk be go captain and i do not hear the rest 
look down i discover to -PRON- horror that -PRON- foot be bare and never before have -PRON- seem so large or so out of place 
i redden to the root of -PRON- hair 
a sailor and a gentleman may be excuse i trust 
-PRON- speak to -PRON- -PRON- voice like a flow rill ripple musical 
but -PRON- word 
-PRON- be as much beyond -PRON- as our be beyond -PRON- 
when -PRON- cease speak there be silence look perhaps what i could not say for -PRON- vouclisafe another smile turn to the hairy one behind -PRON- and address -PRON- imperiously 
-PRON- vanish then vanish whither -PRON- have come 
i gaze after -PRON- with eye that speak what -PRON- lip dare not utter if -PRON- could 
the fiend steal up to -PRON- fawningly make sign indicative of good will as well as suggest that -PRON- go with -PRON- 
-PRON- heed the mute request and be lead off through the grove in the direction take by the lady -PRON- lady of hope and deliverance 
behind -PRON- troop the other detachment of miss link equally harmless and equally desirous of show the amicable turn -PRON- feeling have take 
where be -PRON- professor 
i ask for the third time 
-PRON- have fall say -PRON- upon some uncharted isle in the tropic 
-PRON- be telemachus i be mentor the maid be circe 
beware captain 
folly 
do -PRON- mean to say that -PRON- be carry on the anchor of balloon from above the arctic circle to below the tropic of cancer 
how else do -PRON- account for the flower the palm the balmy atmosphere 
-PRON- be castaway captain and -PRON- line -PRON- seem have fall in pleasant place 
i marvel 
yet how else could -PRON- explain the surrounding in which -PRON- find -PRON- 
presently -PRON- come upon a vista which seem cut bodily from the thousand and one night 
a palace arise before -PRON- a palace with dome and tower of pure white outline against the blue sky 
a great flight of marble step lead upward to the facade of the building 
on either side of the first sfep stand two stalwart warrior on guard 
such a magnificent building murmur prebble 
there must be something to eat inside of -PRON- captain 
that be -PRON- hope say and the quicker -PRON- fall to the well be grow weak in the knee 
at the foot of the grand stairway a man appear as if by magic 
evidently -PRON- have be inform of -PRON- coming and be expect -PRON- 
ile be of normal height and wear a white tunie edge with silver 
-PRON- head be uncover and -PRON- forehead and short vellow hair be span with a silver ribbon -PRON- face be highbrowe and almost of grecian contour 
-PRON- eye be blue as be those of the young woman and as -PRON- rest on -PRON- a peculiar sensation speed along every nerve 
mentality be the keynote of the man eye 
the power of -PRON- mind be extraordinary and be reflect in -PRON- glance in a manner most strange and incomprehensible 
not be verse in psychology i could not explain this visual force 
i merely realize that the eye of this startling individual usurp the office of lip and tongue speak a language and compelling obedience 
without a spoken word the man turn on the hairy creature who have conduct -PRON- to the palace 
-PRON- quail under -PRON- look shiver and slink away 
then -PRON- flash an order to -PRON- 
the next moment -PRON- be ascend the step prebble and i at -PRON- heel 
whether -PRON- be the hypnotism of the man eye or a weakness cause by hunger ver -PRON- brain grow dizzy i stagger rather than walk and have but faint recollection of event for some time 
-PRON- be in a large room -PRON- seem and more of the uncouth slave be at work over -PRON- 
in duc course -PRON- leave this room and come out into another where there be strange plant and blossom and couch cover with fine skin -PRON- recline 
slave hover about -PRON- give -PRON- food out of silver dish what -PRON- eat i do not know but the food whatever -PRON- be be piquant and delicious 
with hunger finally appease i feel in a mood for sleep but the professor be gartulous -PRON- sizhe with blissful content settline -PRON- luxuriously upon -PRON- couch this be paradise this be the abode of the bl tor one be very much oblige to griffyn for cut -PRON- clear of -PRON- balloon 
-PRON- will answer for that 
i scowl allow a spasm of righteous wrath to cross -PRON- contentment 
will -PRON- so mv dear captain chuckle prebble 
where and when if i may ask 
where 
i snap 
why where else can i pillory -PRON- save in -PRON- own country which -PRON- unprofessional conduct have disgrace 
and when -PRON- ask 
as to that prebble i promise -PRON- -PRON- shall happen directly -PRON- return to civilization 
return to civilization have alreadyreturne to civilization captain 
ever since -PRON- drop from the balloon -PRON- have see all around -PRON- evidence of a most civilized and progressive people 
-PRON- quibble sald with strong dlsapproval -PRON- do not fit -PRON- character professor 
-PRON- understand what i mean 
-PRON- have here a very high grade of civilization -PRON- seem but what i have in mind be a return to -PRON- own country 
and when will that be -PRON- ask in the dark as to that presume however that -PRON- have only to describe -PRON- situation to the people in authority here in order to be assist to a home port 
-PRON- cackle 
there be something in that jaugh of -PRON- which always ruffle -PRON- nerve the wrong way 
what be there humorous about that 
i demand fancy -PRON- reply that -PRON- be build -PRON- hope on a very insecure foundation 
the ruler of this most delightful land may have other plan for -PRON- 
-PRON- may not lend -PRON- -PRON- assistance as -PRON- so fondly imagine 
certainly i return -PRON- must have compassion upon -PRON- 
people so artistic and so progressive must have heart to be touch by -PRON- forlorn situation 
-PRON- be a rich people and a rich and cultured people be always generous 
-PRON- may not be able to help -PRON- however 
why not 
prebble loved disputation for -PRON- own sake 
-PRON- be not always to be take seriously when -PRON- grow arguinentative be fairly well acquaint with the chart portion of the seven sea -PRON- go on and i have read extensively along the line of anthropology and kindre science but i find -PRON- impossible to identify those hairy monster who come so near prove -PRON- undoing or these whiterobe demigod who come to -PRON- rescue 
nor have i the least idea what country this be or where -PRON- can be situate 
if wvisite before -PRON- certainly must have be write about 
there be nothing in literature however that touch upon this favor country 
of that be positive 
do -PRON- incline to the belief that -PRON- make an abnormal southing while on the anchor of that balloon 
-PRON- doubt -PRON- when i mention the matter by the lake and then on -PRON- way to this palace -PRON- seem to swerve and incline to -PRON- original opinion 
but -PRON- own idea have undercrone a change 
-PRON- be physically impossible for -PRON- to be carry so far south say -PRON- after a little reflection 
-PRON- be in a tropic land tropic land under the arctic circle paradox i grant -PRON- 
yet -PRON- must helieve the evidence of -PRON- sense and predicate equatorial region here or else -PRON- must doubt the evidence altogether and fall back upon the assumption that -PRON- be non cou pos and be not to place any credence in what -PRON- see or feel or hear 
bah say l rather incline to the theory -PRON- proceed unmove by -PRON- disgusted retort -PRON- be under the spell of the purple snow 
-PRON- be very possible that -PRON- be btlll on the ice cap in the sleep bag far go with hunger and freeze slowly 
-PRON- mind be benumb save for a few of -PRON- faculty which appear to be abnormally alert 
this astounding theory quite take -PRON- breath 
noensense 
i exclaim as soon as i be able to express -PRON- suppose -PRON- have be immpale by that spear down by the lake 
that be not an imaginative spear prebble and -PRON- would not have die an mmaginative death 
to drop into the vernacular -PRON- smile -PRON- frozen finish would merely have be symbolize by that spear 
what -PRON- be apparently underit seem to -PRON- be merely symbolical and -PRON- think be asleep 
if -PRON- be -PRON- would be difficult to awake in a pleasanter paradise than this 
for one captain i be not particular whether -PRON- ever leave this abode of bliss or not 
how about -PRON- meteoric theory of the aurora -PRON- will be a distinct loss to science if that be never enunciate -PRON- answer with a dash of disappointment -PRON- brightenedif -PRON- fail to qualify with -PRON- newspaper and magazine and the lecture platform i believe i should be able to bear with -PRON- own disappoint ment -PRON- principal reason for return to -PRON- own country just now say i firmly be to enlighten the arctic club and the world regard griffyn 
forget griffyn captain 
-PRON- own safety seem to demand that -PRON- cut -PRON- adrift 
i be thankful that -PRON- release -PRON- from -PRON- balloon for otherwise -PRON- should not have visit this most lnterestlng country 
i have a sufciency of -PRON- view however and while -PRON- talk on i go to sleep 
i be awaken by a touch on the shoulder 
start up from the couch i encounter the yes of the man who have meet -PRON- at the palace step 
the eye bid -PRON- get up obeyed and catch a ghimpse of the professor in a tunic of white and silver with a silver ribbon snugly encircle -PRON- bald spot 
at this i laugh immoderately but cease when the face of -PRON- unknown friend turn on -PRON- in rebuke 
the face be grave ominous and i read disaster in -PRON- every line 
command by a look prebble and i trail after -PRON- guide to an archway hang with arra in cloth of gold 
the curtain be part by invisible hand and -PRON- pass through into an immense apartment -PRON- eye dazzle with a scene ofgorgeousness i shall never forget 
yellow and white and blood red be the prevail color of vaulted roof lofty wall and tessellate floor 
the gleam of gold be above -PRON- the sheen of silver on all side and -PRON- buskine foot trod tile of jasper 
in front of -PRON- at the farther end of the vast room be a throne with a crimson canopy 
un der the canopy sit a man clothe in the prevail white and silver and wear a crown that flash with jewel 
on the topmost step of the short flight lead to the dais sit a regal figure in white and gold 
i rub -PRON- bewilder eye for unless -PRON- deceive -PRON- this be -PRON- who have save -PRON- at the lake 
the room be throng with people in white and silver and white and gold and a lane have be open for -PRON- up to the very step of the throne 
ray of sun enter through window in the eastern wall strike the tile and throw wondrous patch of scarlet over the whiteclad group 
amid all this bewilder scene the mind of prebble be amalytically at work 
i could hear -PRON- mutter the woman wear the gold and the man wear the silver 
how do -PRON- come that an island so rich with inhabitant of such intellectual power have never be hear of by the outside ordp captain well breathe softly 
-PRON- still think be pagan deity 
-PRON- have be robe in the costume of the country and -PRON- with -PRON- black hair and dark eye look well enough although a trifle out of place stand there like a dazed imbecile 
throw dignity into -PRON- bearing 
watch -PRON- 
-PRON- adjust -PRON- spectacle fold -PRON- arm across -PRON- narrow chest and peer about -PRON- with lofty disdain 
but -PRON- be not of a size to foster an impression of haughtiness 
as -PRON- stand there cynosure for all eye two between -PRON- -PRON- carry -PRON- old sleep bag and lay -PRON- on the floor before the throne 
the man who have take -PRON- in hand advanced kowtow to -PRON- ruler and begin to talk 
-PRON- be word that come from -PRON- lip and that -PRON- have all to do with -PRON- be evident from the astounded look that continue to be turn in -PRON- direction 
when -PRON- have make an end -PRON- salaam and step back 
thereupon the young woman speak to the king from -PRON- seat on the tep 
-PRON- remark finish the king -PRON- indulge in a few word and the man who have bring -PRON- to the throne room give -PRON- attention to the sleep bag 
-PRON- clothe be inside the bag and be bring out and duly exhibit 
there be something else which -PRON- friend want and -PRON- get -PRON- by bury himsellfto the heel in the bag 
as i live -PRON- be a quaft flask of whisky 
look here prebble i growl in -PRON- ear do -PRON- have that flask all the while -PRON- be lose on the ice cap -PRON- mumble 
and -PRON- never say anything about -PRON- 
i exclaim fiercely 
i tell -PRON- be save -PRON- for emergency 
i be strongly tempt to lay hand on prebble but just then hand be lay on both of -PRON- and -PRON- be hurry up nearer the throne 
the king rap -PRON- scepter against the arm of the throne chair 
a little man appear a little man with luminous eye and the nose and chin of a punchinello 
in -PRON- hand -PRON- carry two metal circlet each cross with a pair of thin metal band bent into concave form 
-PRON- seem to understand what be wanie of -PRON- for after salute the king -PRON- come to prebble and -PRON- and place the contrivance upon -PRON- head 
-PRON- fit the skull like a cap i trust that so far -PRON- have not be necessary for an officer and a gentleman to dwell upon -PRON- veracity 
that i advert to -PRON- here be simply because i have reach a point where the reader credulity may receive -PRON- first shock 
other shock will follow and i wish to lighten the blow by a manly and straightforward statement 
prebble and i have drop in on a truly wonderful people 
the skill -PRON- show the art -PRON- apply the highly develop mental process that be -PRON- be the natural concomitant of a civilization mark at every turn by way and mean to -PRON- oftentime inexplicable i be write these experience with painstaking care and if the reader will abide with -PRON- to the end i promisethat -PRON- shall not only be instruct and thrill but convince as well wa then for the first shock 
the instant those metal cap be place upon -PRON- head prebble and i be put en rapport with these amazing being 
-PRON- could not only understand -PRON- speech but -PRON- tongue be endow with -PRON- 
stranger wherice come -PRON- demand the king 
prebble clap -PRON- hand like a delighted schoolboy pull off -PRON- metal cap look at -PRON- gloatingly fondle -PRON- and then replace -PRON- upon -PRON- shine pate 
from a far country sir lic answer 
what bring vou hither chance 
and a drag rope i add mentally 
be -PRON- from beyond the ice wall 
prebble blink in bewilderment do not understand -PRON- majesty say -PRON- 
for once i happen to be a little quick of comprehension 
what be the latitude of this country sir i askud eagerly 
the king nod toward the little man with the hooked nose and chin degree and forty minute north say the little man 
twenty minute i gasp reel against prebble 
twenty minute from the pole falter prebble 
what do this all mean 
only twentythree mile from the goal of -PRON- hope shout only twentvthree mile from fame from the great discovery tie world have ever know 
glory 
i dance around like a wild man mile 
i roar 
tnile 
i start at a run for the doorway anxious to leave the palace and race on foot over the twentythree mile that separate -PRON- from the spot -PRON- be -PRON- consume desire to reach 
prebble grab -PRON- but i keep on jerk -PRON- heel over head 
the two hairy warrior then place -PRON- in -PRON- way and i fight like a fiend to escape 
there be the great disorder in the vast room 
the king be on -PRON- foot and the court be in a tumult be fiercely -PRON- sense dazzle by -PRON- proximity to the pole 
have i use -PRON- reason i may have question the reliable nature of the knowledge just give -PRON- for how could i be in a tropical region and yet only twentythree mile from the goal of myl ambition 
but i be in no condition just then to reason about anything 
i be wild with excitement 
food and rest have revive -PRON- failing strength a straightcut blow from the shoulder daze one of the hairy guard -PRON- only daze -PRON- however 
have -PRON- be endow with ordinary physical power -PRON- would have floor -PRON- 
the fellow come back at -PRON- hiss like a wild eat 
i see -PRON- ponderous hand clench for a retaliate blow and -PRON- gigantic arm draw back 
a shout from the king cause the second of the two guard to seize -PRON- companion arm before -PRON- could strike 
this diversion seem to leave the path clear for -PRON- and i turn to continue mry mad flight 
a foot trip -PRON- and i measure -PRON- length on the jasper tile 
before i could rise two bare knee be on -PRON- chest pin -PRON- down and two hand be at -PRON- wrist hold -PRON- powerless 
prebble white and apprehensive draw close 
captain say -PRON- -PRON- be beside -PRON- 
what folly 
man man donot -PRON- know -PRON- be impossible to escape from this palace guard as -PRON- be 
even if -PRON- do manage to get outside in traverse the twentythree mile say to lie between -PRON- and the pole there wculd be ample opportunity to lay -PRON- by the heel 
the whole country would be up in arm against -PRON- 
i cease struggle 
that be quite true professor answer 
-PRON- enthusiasm run away with -PRON- 
-PRON- enthusiasm come very near cost -PRON- -PRON- life 
but the pole there be some wild guessing on the part of the gentleman with the hooked nose 
reason tell -PRON- that the polar region be choke with ice 
there could be no summer weather such a short distance from the north pole 
either that captain or -PRON- be in a realm of enchantment donot believe in enchantment i scoff enough of this 
get off -PRON- say to the giant on -PRON- chest and be tractable 
the guard do not seem to comprehend 
prebble pick up the helmet which i have drop from -PRON- brow and replace -PRON- 
now tell -PRON- say -PRON- 
by the aid of that marvelous ring hell be able to understand -PRON- 
some of the noble have advance by that time and the hostile flash of -PRON- blue compelling eye force the warrior to arise and allow -PRON- to regain a more dlgme attitude 
i arrange -PRON- disordered tunic 
the sallen guard place -PRON- one on cach side of -PRON- and one of the noble step close and speak sharply 
this say -PRON- most unseemly conduct for the throne room be carry away by the knowledge that be impart to -PRON- i return humbly be very sorry i cause any trouble 
-PRON- be very impulsive put in prebble altogether too much so at time for -PRON- own good 
but at least assure -PRON- bar a few little conceit and crochet -PRON- be a very agreeable fellow 
-PRON- majesty deal very severely with any infraction of court etiquette go on the noblc unless -PRON- promise to be more circumspect in -PRON- behavior -PRON- will be necessary to put -PRON- in restraint do that vour lordship speak up prebble in considerable agitation captainmean well i assure -PRON- although now and then -PRON- have a poor way of show -PRON- 
i will stand sponsor for -PRON- 
the flinty blue eye of the noble wither the professor for a space 
and who will be responsible for -PRON- -PRON- ask 
prebble be usually sufficient unto -PRON- and -PRON- be humorous to see -PRON- squirm and shrivel under the flash of the noble blue orb 
in -PRON- own country answer the professor attempt a little dignity but with scant success -PRON- word be as good as -PRON- bond 
prebble be measure with a swift glance and the noble turn away with a shadow of a smile be -PRON- laugh at -PRON- the professor whisper in -PRON- ear do -PRON- mean by that 
-PRON- ring crook say completely restore to -PRON- normal condition of mind and -PRON- doesnot enhance the dignity of -PRON- appearamnpe 
better straighten -PRON- prebble afraid this outburst of yours capfan remark prebble as -PRON- straighten the ring will inspire the king to harsh measure against -PRON- donot think much of -PRON- as a king if -PRON- allow -PRON- judgment to be sway by a little natural exuberance on -PRON- part 
-PRON- should have repress -PRON- 
the fellow in the skin robe be still blink from the effect of that blow -PRON- deal -PRON- 
but for a remarkably thick skull i return not now be able even to blink 
the disorder have die away and a measure of courtly quiet once more prevailed 
the king have seat -PRON- and -PRON- guard obey an imperial gesture return prebble and -PRON- to the foot of the throne 
for age say -PRON- majesty -PRON- mythology have teach usto look for two fiend who wcre to drop from the sky and bring woe and ruin to -PRON- devoted kingdom 
be -PRON- those arch fiend 
answer 
by this time i have recover -PRON- wit 
no sir reply -PRON- be not the fiend -PRON- be expect 
-PRON- be come through the air on a strange ship and seem to be a little behind schedule but i assure -PRON- -PRON- will arrive all right 
prebble whirl on -PRON- catch one of -PRON- hand and shake -PRON- heartily neatly do captain -PRON- whisper must beat griffyn to the pole i return excitedly 
if -PRON- come down anywhere this side of latitude ninety i think that will block -PRON- 
-PRON- will be on the lockout fiend -PRON- mention pursue -PRON- meanwhile as there seem to be no httle mystery surroundmg -PRON- two gentleman i shall be under the pamful necessity of have -PRON- put to death 
sire cry the young woman look up at the king and hold out -PRON- hard appalingly 
-PRON- start to enter a vigorous protest but the king wave -PRON- hand impatiently 
princess ylma enough say -PRON- to the young woman sternly to -PRON- -PRON- add be deaf to -PRON- entreaty -PRON- have come as tradition say the demon be to come -PRON- act stranely and an ounce of prevention in this particular case be worth a pound of cure 
the professor and i gaze at each other in wildest horror 
for a space prebble dppeare to shrivel up then suddenly -PRON- expand a forlorn hope flicker across -PRON- pallid face 
spring to the heap of garment lie on the sleep bag -PRON- pick up the flask and carry -PRON- to the edge of the dais 
-PRON- be very great prophet in -PRON- own land king -PRON- aver glibly 
behold the proof of -PRON- skill and -PRON- wave the bottle aloft 
what be -PRON- ask the king 
the elixir of life sire 
drink and -PRON- will renew -PRON- youth 
eagerly the king grasp at the flask 
unwittingly prebble have touch a button that connect with -PRON- majestys dear desire 
beware -PRON- majesty cry voice 
itmay be poison already the king have unscrew the top 
after hesitate a moment -PRON- smile craftily 
drink say -PRON- hand the flask to the professor 
if -PRON- kill -PRON- 
i will let -PRON- alone 
prebble take a swallow from the flask 
then i grab -PRON- away from -PRON- and take another 
this satisfy the king 
take the flask from -PRON- hand -PRON- raise -PRON- to -PRON- lip and drank deeply 
-PRON- be lose 
as the fiery liquor go down an electric thrill send the hot blood race through -PRON- vein and -PRON- feel that the beginning of -PRON- rejuvenation be at hand 
these be not the fiend who be to bring destruction to -PRON- kingdom -PRON- cry 
these be -PRON- good friend 
lord nyli -PRON- be in -PRON- chargetheir safety be upon -PRON- head 
lodge -PRON- royally give -PRON- the good of everything 
gadzook but i feel a different man already 
away with -PRON- lord nylis 
and as for the rest of -PRON- depart from the presence 
i would fain be alone with -PRON- elixir 
again be there confusion 
during the hubbub prebble and i be conduct from the throne room and from the palace by lord nyli 
the flask of bourbon have save -PRON- for the time be but at what a cost of danger to -PRON- and vicissitude to that devoted kingdom forty eightynine forty i keep repeat to -PRON- as the professor and i follow lord nylis down the grand stairway of the palace could think of nothing but that the culmination of -PRON- earthly desire lie only twentythree mile away 
this lord nyhs be the astute person who have engineer -PRON- entrance into the palace 
at the foot of the marble step -PRON- pause and look toward the red warrior on the right 
instantly the warrior spear ring thrice against -PRON- shield 
that call -PRON- oyd car explain -PRON- lordship 
-PRON- be some distance from -PRON- palace and must ride 
the metallic crash of spear on shield have bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
at -PRON- lordship mention of a conveyance an idea flash through -PRON- mind 
could -PRON- not ride to the pole 
i ask eagerly 
-PRON- be not far lord nylis and i particularly desire to reach the pole 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- would be as much as -PRON- life be worth -PRON- answer 
a cold chill strike to -PRON- heart 
what do -PRON- mean 
i falter 
the pole be in the land of the chur -PRON- go on 
-PRON- be brute like these -PRON- indicate the guard to right and leave of the palace step but -PRON- be not under -PRON- domination of the chur -PRON- have bring to submission b will power alone and -PRON- be everywhere throughout the kingdom serve as soidieysand menial 
the chur at the pole however be wild and ferocious 
-PRON- never encroach upon -PRON- territory unless in quest of slave 
ah here be the oyd car 
mount genemgn 
the vehicle now draw up before -PRON- be a queer bit of mechanism 
the bed of -PRON- be dia tondshape and have a large wheel 
at each side and small one at the point front and rear 
aeros the middle be throw a very wide seat and there be another narrow one occupy by a shaggy chur in the front point 
home klimon say lord nyl 
klimon bend over asquare box and slightly raise a cover at the same time manipulate a lever on -PRON- left 
at once -PRON- glide and noiselessly run point foremost what furnish the motive power the professor be first with a question on this head be the powr that drive this vehicle -PRON- lordship 
-PRON- call -PRON- oyd answer the noble 
-PRON- drive all the machinery in the kingdom 
oyd mutter the professor know about everything worth know but somehow that have -PRON- 
will -PRON- explain 
the force be magnetic be the answer 
there be a mineral which -PRON- delve from deep in the ground and call zellin 
the whirl of the earth create a friction which make of the north pole a tremendously powerful loadstone so that -PRON- attract every particle of zellin on the surface of the kingdomand -PRON- attract only zellin and nothing else see say the professor sagely 
-PRON- have a piece of zellin in that box on the forward point of the carriage 
yes 
that box be a nonmagnetic screen and when -PRON- cover the cube of zellin the oyd power be shut off 
but the instant the front of the screen be raise the attract force set in and -PRON- move 
most remarkable cry prebble 
the amount of power be regulate by lift the front of the screenr exactly 
if the front be raise onethird the oyd force or attraction be only onethird but raise onehalf the attraction be onehalf the power of the zellin cube and so on 
hence -PRON- proceed at a slow pace at a run or with the full power of the cube -PRON- all but fly 
prebble strike -PRON- hand together in ecstasy 
how large be the cube -PRON- lordship -PRON- ask 
this car be fit with a twelveinch block which be a power 
a sixinch cube would be a twelveman power a tenty fourinch cube would be a power and so on 
be the force of the polar attraction always the same 
always 
and always attract due north the attraction be continually toward the pole 
how be -PRON- able to proceed in anything but a straight line lever on left conneet with the wheel at the rear point 
the turning of that wheel act as a rudder and steer -PRON- easterly or westerly 
beautiful beautiful 
but if -PRON- wish to go south directly away from the pole 
-PRON- rudder couldnot help -PRON- to move in that direction 
certainly not 
when -PRON- wish to go southward -PRON- make use of the suboyd power 
what be that pray 
do -PRON- not know that there be another magnetic pole 
the other be simply a focus of magnetic power and be the one that attract the needle of the mariner compass ah yes murmur prebble 
that pole be locate in seventyone north and ninetysix west 
-PRON- be the source of -PRON- suboyd power resume -PRON- lordship 
there be another screened box under foot inclose a cube of soft iron 
if -PRON- wish to travel due south or in any direction east or west by south the cube of zellin be scr eene entlrely and the cube of iron be switch forward on a movable arm 
the ratio of power in the suboyd cube be the same as in the oyd bldck how beautifully nature have care for -PRON- in this delightful country chirrup the professor 
beyond the ice wall -PRON- know nothmg of the oyd or suboyd power 
the force that attract -PRON- cube of soft iron be barely sufficient to sway -PRON- magnetlc needle 
how do -PRON- explain the difference in the power of -PRON- country and ours donot explain -PRON- say lord nylis 
-PRON- be one of inscrutable law 
-PRON- be travel swiftly over awellpave road 
the breath of june be in the air green grove and flowerstrewn meadow stretch on both side of -PRON- and as -PRON- journey i catch glimpse of strangelooke house half hide by the tree 
the people -PRON- pass or who come down to the roadway to look at -PRON- be all of a kind with the man and woman -PRON- have already see albeit of low station 
but i see none of -PRON- at work 
the country blossom as the rise yet no yellowhaired laborer be in the field 
i ask lord nylis about this 
-PRON- labor with the mind not with the hand -PRON- reply 
what the oyd and suboyd force can not accomplish the chur take care of 
-PRON- brain be overwhelm with all this riot of new sensation and unheurdof condition and i have be drop into a country as different from -PRON- own as -PRON- mind could conceive 
there be a thousand and one question want to ask but -PRON- very multitude appal and silence -PRON- 
i think of the pole and in spite of the savage chur i determine to reach -PRON- just as soon as i have familiarize -PRON- somewhat with the way of the country and could plan intelligently 
certainly if i could not get to the pole griffyn would not be able to do so 
from the pole -PRON- thought wndgre to the princess yima 
-PRON- lovely face be before -PRON- the rich cadence of -PRON- voice in -PRON- ear 
ah if fortune would be kind to -PRON- 
tl could win -PRON- and carry -PRON- back to -PRON- own country and -PRON- own come to -PRON- with a guilty start 
what crazy notion have take possession of -PRON- thag i should raise -PRON- eye to a princess of the blood 
i try to banish -PRON- from -PRON- thought but -PRON- entrance feature and dulcet voice would nof allow -PRON- to be ignore 
i recall the smile -PRON- give -PRON- and then i recall -PRON- miss mukluk and turn toward -PRON- two companion 
prebble be just ask for a test of speedhe want to see how fast the oyd car could run 
full power klimon 
say lord nylis 
the chur open the screen to -PRON- full extent and the carriage leap away like a bullet from a gun clung to the professor and the professor clung to -PRON- 
house people tree pass so swiftly that -PRON- dance on the sight in blur line 
finally -PRON- slow down by degree and come to a halt in front of -PRON- lordship palace 
thank heaven 
i exclaim 
hurrah for the oyd power cry the professor beside -PRON- 
the most wonderful power on earth -PRON- be the making of the kingdom remark lord nylis as -PRON- descend 
follow -PRON- gentleman this palace as be fitting be much small and less ornate than the one -PRON- have just quit 
still -PRON- be a gem in -PRON- way 
on a terrace amid flower and shrubbery and splashing fountain -PRON- recline at length on couch spread with downy robe of fur 
the heat be such that the shade of the terrace be most refreshing 
if i have have a cigar or a pipe i would have be in a seventh heaven 
lord nyli have make -PRON- as comfortable as -PRON- could in the circumstance excuse -PRON- for a space 
prebble peer at -PRON- as one in a daze 
-PRON- start to speak then check -PRON- as though -PRON- dare not trust -PRON- wonder to word 
out with -PRON- professor say i languidly 
what problem be bother -PRON- just now one problem captain but ahundre problem sigh prebble all atsea over this astounding adventure 
frozen fancy 
i laugh dream itall still on the ice cap in the sleep bag hope not i hope not -PRON- mumble 
all these experience with thing new and before untried be too interesting to be pase with any explanation of that sort 
of all the remarkable object -PRON- have so far behold -PRON- remove the glitter circlet from -PRON- browseasily carry off the palm 
i wonder norw and -PRON- frown as -PRON- wit begin work if -PRON- think in an alien language as well as talk in -PRON- 
do this ring exercise a power over -PRON- intellect to such an unheardof degree be too pleasant an hour to be disturb with riddle past -PRON- solving i break in 
suppose -PRON- consider a mistake -PRON- have madea mistake into which i be lead by -PRON- 
-PRON- lift -PRON- brow 
what mistake -PRON- inquire 
when the anchor pick -PRON- oft the ice cap i explain -PRON- assert that -PRON- be carry -PRON- south and that the balloon be come out of the north 
that seem a proper inference captain before -PRON- be inform of -PRON- proximity to the pole while in the throne room 
even at this moment be incline to take the information impart by that hooknose gentleman with a grain of salt 
however in a country of so many wonder perhaps -PRON- be not well to doubt anything 
if griffyn have come irom the north i go on there be another proper inference that -PRON- have come from the pole perhaps have discover -PRON- 
prebble replace the ring and nod to signify that -PRON- be follow -PRON- 
-PRON- have now proofk i continue that griffyn be go north when -PRON- snatch -PRON- off the ice cap -PRON- both tacitly realize and acknowledge that error in -PRON- audience with the king say the professor 
-PRON- chuckle 
the ruler of this delightful country tell -PRON- that two fiend be to drop out of the sky and bring trouble 
-PRON- very brilliantly inform -PRON- majesty that the fiend be none other than griffyn and -PRON- companion in the balloon 
admirable 
that be indeed a happy inspiration if griffyn and -PRON- friend will only come down and let -PRON- be discover i fancy the king will have confidence in -PRON- assertion 
that captain will mean continued safety for -PRON- 
but i return suppose the balloon come down among the chur 
that take -PRON- would prove a coup de grdce for the englishman hope -PRON- wonot happen say be -PRON- relent toward griffyn query prebble somewhat surprised canot find -PRON- in -PRON- heart i answer to wish -PRON- ill to that extent 
think of the spear which -PRON- so narrowly escape and i shudder have a welldefine impression observe prebble after a little reflection that -PRON- shall presently be put to -PRON- to look after -PRON- so -PRON- may just as well cease worry about the fate that be to overtake griffyn 
aye be -PRON- answer -PRON- have buy -PRON- life at the price of a flask of bourbon 
no good can come of such a transaction and i feel moody and apprehensive have be expect applause from -PRON- on the score of that flask of bourbon say prebble a little hurt 
-PRON- turn a point concern griffyn and -PRON- fellow voyager be the expect fiend and i shake hand with -PRON- anderwell gloat 
now -PRON- rebuke -PRON- ifor turn a point with the whisky 
not at all i hasten to answer 
-PRON- save -PRON- life and i appreciate -PRON- resourcefulness even though i overlook the selfish manner in which -PRON- stow away thatflask while -PRON- be on the ice cap 
a flask and a revolver 
i know nothing about these -PRON- friend 
each have do -PRON- part in preserve -PRON- captain 
the end therefore have justify the meaun 
let -PRON- pass 
the oyd and suboyd power be much in -PRON- mind here -PRON- have subtle force fully control and make to perform the will of man 
the people of this land have invent -PRON- selve into that blissfulstate where labor be unnecessary 
by sheer force of the intellect -PRON- conquer and hold in subjection the chur and make the hairy savage do menial service 
the life of the ruling race seem to be a life of enjoyment 
which be not and can never be a successful life i declare 
the dignity of labor be need to round out the life of this rule race 
if this situation have continue for any length of time then something be due to happen 
captain agree prebble -PRON- be probably correct 
but after -PRON- wear struggle with the ice a period of idleness afford a most refreshing prospect 
i nod 
but say prebble grow disputatious although the ruler of this land do not work with -PRON- hand let -PRON- not suppose that -PRON- be idle 
-PRON- mind must be busy 
and such mind 
the mental effort necessary to keep the enslave chur under subjection must be enormous 
at that moment lord nyli return and seat -PRON- on a couch beside -PRON- 
what be the name of this country -PRON- lordship i ask 
-PRON- call -PRON- nyll -PRON- answer 
and what be the name of the reign house 
boazar 
boazar be now on the throne 
have -PRON- many child 
i be slowly work up to the subject that be become as dear to -PRON- heart as the discovery of the pole 
one only the princess ylma 
-PRON- lordship voice sadden as -PRON- add with a gloomy shake of the head poor princess ylma 
i rouse to inquire why the princess yima should be the object of -PRON- commiseration when prebble break in ahead of -PRON- with a question on an altogether different matter 
whence come this heat lord nylis 
-PRON- have the sun here for six at a time but -PRON- do no furnish sufficient caloric fora climate like this 
the friction of the earth in -PRON- rotation around the pole generate the heat -PRON- lordship explain 
but the pole be figurative demur the professor 
the earth can cause no friction in turn around a figurative axis 
the axis be not figurative 
the pole i5 a real one 
of course -PRON- be say what do -PRON- think look for prebble 
-PRON- turn -PRON- head and blink at -PRON- through -PRON- glass learn thing captain sali say -PRON- that no two man outside of nyll ever learn before 
-PRON- press one hand to -PRON- temple 
merciful power -PRON- head be split 
this be morning isnot -PRON- lord nylis yes reply -PRON- lordship the morning of the long day 
when do -PRON- dine inquire prebble moisten -PRON- lip with -PRON- tongue and think no doubt of the good thing -PRON- have have at the palace of king boazar 
in two week and three day say lord nylis 
i be startle 
prebble nearly fall off -PRON- couch 
-PRON- lordship notice -PRON- astonishment and add -PRON- eat but three time daily -PRON- custom in -PRON- own country i comment 
but -PRON- day be six month long 
i groan 
and -PRON- eat only once in two month ask 
three month intervene between breakfast and dinner and dinner and supper 
-PRON- sleep throughout the long nmight not a canot hibernate say preb ble rear up on -PRON- elbow and look at -PRON- 
captain let go home 
although -PRON- frame be meager and show no result of high living i yet know that prebble be fond of -PRON- meal and something of an epicure 
home 
i exclaim invent the fly machine professor and navigate -PRON- -PRON- do donot talk about home waste -PRON- time 
there there -PRON- friend put in lord nyli smilingly -PRON- shall not expect -PRON- to abide by -PRON- custom in this respect 
eat when -PRON- feel like -PRON- sleep when -PRON- wish 
-PRON- shall have the run of the larder and untrammeled use of the dormitory 
the king order gentleman humble roof be yours 
many thank -PRON- lordship say prebble -PRON- again be a man of science but -PRON- stomach be -PRON- weak point believe that even by the way what do -PRON- drink in this glorious land water 
nothing but water -PRON- have nothing else find water sufficient now i a glass ofof prebble be forget -PRON- 
have there be any alcoholic beverage in the kingdom that flask of bourbon would have be no novelty to the king 
a glitter come into the eye of -PRON- host and -PRON- rest a keen glance on -PRON- friend suppose say -PRON- that -PRON- elixir of life be the common beverage in the land from which -PRON- come prebble coughed 
tt be not so plentiftil as to be what -PRON- may call common lord nyli say -PRON- 
not -PRON- go on hastily that there be a scarcity of -PRON- 
on the contrary -PRON- be to be find nearly everywhere but -PRON- be for the select few who be able -PRON- quibble be carry -PRON- into deep place 
-PRON- be a subject moreover which make -PRON- uneasy 
i attempt to shift the topic should like to know something more about this princess ylma lord nyli i remark with assumed carelessness 
-PRON- affect not to hear -PRON- 
-PRON- -PRON- go on study the professor attentively must surely be of the select few who be able to obtain the elixir 
why yes reply prebble 
as need manifest -PRON- i have have -PRON- share of the potent fluid 
i be a scientist however and know where to draw the line 
now -PRON- go on with abrupt eagerness about this oyd force -PRON- be clearly as distrustful of the matter lord nyli be press as i be also -PRON- be seek to give another turn to the conversation 
-PRON- lordship however be not to be shake 
-PRON- cling to the subject relentlessly 
as i covertly watch the eye of -PRON- host an uncanny conviction that -PRON- be probe deep than -PRON- tongue lay hold of -PRON- 
what unplumbe depth lie at the back of -PRON- lordship penetrate glance 
-PRON- inform the king lord nyli interrupt prebble to remark that -PRON- and -PRON- friend be very great prophet in -PRON- own land 
the professor make a heroic effort to at ease and to meet the issue plausibly 
exactly so -PRON- return 
-PRON- own prophetic line be scientific 
the captain on the other hand be explore 
whenever -PRON- go explore -PRON- take -PRON- along to furnish fact and figure to work out various problem to the elixir -PRON- claim be a ptoof of -PRON- skill 
i wish in -PRON- soul that something may happen to draw -PRON- lordship off 
-PRON- be payingl out more than enough rope to entangle prebble and to trip -PRON- the less that elixir be discuss the well -PRON- would be for -PRON- 
quite true assert prebble with a panicky look in -PRON- direction 
then score lord nylis if -PRON- be a prophet if the elixir be a product of -PRON- skill and -PRON- know -PRON- virtue and make use of -PRON- why have -PRON- not renew -PRON- own youth 
prebble be silent 
-PRON- show -PRON- good sense by not plunge into some farfetched explanation that would give -PRON- lordship a chance to score again 
and lord nyli turn to meis youth not a condition in much demand in -PRON- own country 
be grow old so agreeable to those who live in -PRON- native land 
the professor answer for -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- be even more afraid to trust -PRON- than -PRON- be to trust -PRON- 
gray hair command respect say -PRON- and that be what -PRON- prophet demand more than youththe respect bear of gray hair and wisdom 
this remark appear to please lord nylis 
the professor have touch -PRON- intellectual side where -PRON- be strong 
-PRON- seem then say -PRON- that -PRON- countryman particularly -PRON- prophet reverence knowledge far more than -PRON- desire youth 
that be the case -PRON- lordship 
then why do -PRON- give such a proof of -PRON- skill to -PRON- people 
if -PRON- be wise to grow old in year and wisdom even though -PRON- must die for -PRON- why cater to folly with a beverage which keep people young all man do not think the same on a subject so broad as that cough the professor no doubt wish -PRON- have leave -PRON- lordship to talk with -PRON- -PRON- elixir have a most remarkable effect upon the king be assure of that before i give -PRON- to -PRON- -PRON- royal will be completely overturn 
the elixir be warrant to overturn the will of any one royal or otherwise 
a troubled look as i think cross -PRON- lordship countenance 
-PRON- must be exceedingly powerful -PRON- exclaim hesitate to describe the elixir full power to -PRON- lord nyli 
possibfy -PRON- would not believe -PRON- 
i be glad the professor hesitate 
the princess ylma i venture save -PRON- from the chur 
naturally -PRON- lordship i should be glad to learn something about the young lady 
the professor and i be deeply indebted to -PRON- and pardon -PRON- lord nyli interrupt but the marvelous power of -PRON- elixir have quite captivate -PRON- fancy 
and yet -PRON- frown a little as -PRON- speak have a premonition that -PRON- be not well for the people of this kingdom to renew -PRON- youth by mean of -PRON- elixir 
i feel -PRON- friend that i must go deeper into this subject 
-PRON- be new and at this juncture there be an interruption 
i draw a deep breath of satisfaction although certainly i should not have feel such profound relief have i know at the moment all that the interruption portend 
suddenly there come to -PRON- ear a loud shout from the direction of the road 
-PRON- spring up in time to see a large oyd car with a dozen armed chur and one nyllite sweep up to the palace step 
the instant the car stop the warrior and the man in charge of -PRON- leap to the ground and rush up to the terrace 
in another instant prebble and i be surround 
seize -PRON- command the nyllite who be captain of the king guard 
six spear point prick -PRON- breast and six pair of ferocious bloodshot eye glare into -PRON- the professor be also at bay in a precisely similar manner 
count zylox what mean this demand the indignant lord nyli confront the captain of the guard 
the king be die cry the count excitedly 
die echo -PRON- lordship aghast 
aye and through the madchination of these foreign devil 
woe woe to this land lord nylis 
at this very instant king boazar be stretch out on the dais at the foot of the throne chair roll -PRON- eye gasp and chokingly endeavor to give -PRON- final order 
what do -PRON- say query -PRON- hortified lordship 
-PRON- can not understand -PRON- pitiful attempt at speech resfonde the tearful captain of the guard 
whash mazzer -PRON- sound like mazzer whash mazzer over and over agam ah this be a sorry day for -PRON- beloved country 
-PRON- good king 
the last of the boazar 
-PRON- whirl furiously upon the chur who be thxeatemng prebble and -PRON- 
bind the foreign devil -PRON- shriek 
-PRON- life shall pay for this and a poor enough forfeit -PRON- be 
out of the fry pan into the fire be a homely expression but -PRON- describe a situation which seem to fit -PRON- case 
the king be in no danger but have use -PRON- elixir too freely 
yet how to convince count zylox of this before -PRON- be draw and quarter 
that be the question vou ever think in -PRON- life captain sali think now cry the professor brush the sweat from -PRON- forehead with a fold of -PRON- tunic 
cord cord shout count zylox 
dind -PRON- 
lord nyli i exclaim -PRON- appeal to -PRON- 
the king be in no danger 
i swear -PRON- 
danger repeat the captain of the guard 
-PRON- lie like a log i tell -PRON- and -PRON- end be near 
not so clamor the professor 
that be the way the elixir work 
do -PRON- not see -PRON- swallow -PRON- 
and -PRON- friend there 
if -PRON- have be poison -PRON- -PRON- would be dead or die 
look out -PRON- relic of the stone age -PRON- be stick -PRON- brush aside a spear point that be make -PRON- too keenly feel 
what -PRON- say be true i aver 
in a few hour the king will be -PRON- again will not believe -PRON- be the fierce response of count zylox 
rather than bother with bind -PRON- -PRON- would perhaps be as well for -PRON- to run -PRON- through not that speak up lord nylis 
the king have place these gentleman in -PRON- charge and i be responsible for -PRON- with -PRON- head 
but the king be pass 
-PRON- gentleman say not 
i yield up -PRON- guest only on the king order count zylox king be incapable of give order 
-PRON- will issue -PRON- when -PRON- be capable 
what if -PRON- die 
in that event i take -PRON- command from princess ylma 
count zylox be an exceedingly angry man 
-PRON- stamp about the terrace in -PRON- buskin 
-PRON- hospitality have take a rathet grim turn count observe -PRON- lordship must request that -PRON- have -PRON- chur lower -PRON- weapon 
and permit these foreign devil to escape cry the exasperate count 
by no means 
guard -PRON- until -PRON- have further news of the king 
the count gnaw -PRON- under lip for a moment 
then -PRON- say -PRON- will tarry three hour 
by that time a courier from the palace will let -PRON- know whether the king live or be dead 
if -PRON- live -PRON- wish will be bring by the courier say lord nyli and shall be implicitly obey 
and if -PRON- die 
if -PRON- die these foreigner shall suffer death by oyd well say the count and give order that cause the chur to withdraw and marshal -PRON- in a column behind prebble and -PRON- 
i sit down on -PRON- couch and prebble sit down on -PRON- 
this constant peril be most try to the nerve for -PRON- never seem ableto tell when the lightning be go to strike or how 
this death by oyd murmur prebble what be -PRON- -PRON- lordship 
if the king die and the princess ylma so command as -PRON- undoubtedly will in that event -PRON- foot will be securely bind to thefeetof -PRON- friend 
a block of zellin properly screen will be chain to -PRON- wrist and a be chain to the wrist of -PRON- 
the screen will then be by degree 
-PRON- will be pull north -PRON- friend south 
first a force equivalent to six man will drag at -PRON- limb pull against each other then twelve man then eighteen then the full twentyfour 
-PRON- be awful to contempate the very fiendishness of -PRON- fairly sicken -PRON- 
-PRON- be the punishment for high treason comment the count glower at -PRON- 
wait six hour instead of three implore prebble three heur only snap the count 
how slowly the minute drag 
surround and guard to make sure that -PRON- do not escape prebble and i endeavor to compose -PRON- nerve be afraid of something like this professor say -PRON- would be rather a humorous situation say prebble if these nyllite werenot so ignorant 
what a sight for godsand man to see king boazar prone upon the throne surround by -PRON- griefstricken court and only give vent to hiccup and gurgle and the two mysterious word whash mazzer the professor forget -PRON- own desperate situation so far as to cackle with suppress merriment liable to be anything but a laugh matter for -PRON- and -PRON- prebble i admonish -PRON- 
how can there be a tragedy 
the king will come out of -PRON- trance and word will be send to release -PRON- 
suppose the court doctor get busy with the king 
-PRON- donot understand what ail -PRON- and -PRON- may resort to heroic measure 
-PRON- may suecumb to th measure but the clixir will be charge up with -PRON- and of course -PRON- be already charge up with the elixir 
prebble look worried something in that captain -PRON- fal tere wish -PRON- could get word to those doctor to keep -PRON- hand off 
what good would -PRON- do -PRON- to get word to -PRON- 
i inquire 
do -PRON- think -PRON- would pay any attention to -PRON- wish in the matter one way or the other 
possibly not 
certainly not not a doubt as to the position -PRON- occupy in the land of nyll 
let -PRON- suppose say the professor that the king case be not aggravate by the solicitude of -PRON- physician 
qur danger will pass in that event 
very likely provide these troublesome chur be not goad into something violent by zylox 
the captain of the guard be still tramp fretfully up and down itch to be at and yet not dare to override the instruction of the king count be in a hard row of stump i go on to prebble give -PRON- eye to see -PRON- impale on the poing of those spear but if the king should recover the count would be call on to pay with -PRON- head for -PRON- rash action 
and lord nyli too add prebble 
an execution by oyd -PRON- proceed -PRON- thought take a gruesome trend must be a particularly horrible performance 
-PRON- have the electric chair beat both way say slowly but relentlessly a victim be pull to piece 
a sicken pallor spread -PRON- over the professor face 
sit upright on -PRON- couch -PRON- shade -PRON- eye with one hand and look off along the road that lead to the palace wonder why some one doesnot come from the king -PRON- worry 
no one will come until the king either die or recover sufciently to tell -PRON- court that -PRON- have no intention of die i answer 
lord nyli observe that some of the chur be becbme rather overzealous in -PRON- guard duty place -PRON- closer to prebble and -PRON- 
a single look which -PRON- throw at the hairy warrior dampen -PRON- vengeful ardor and -PRON- draw back 
this condition of -PRON- majesty remark -PRON- lordship turn to prebble seem an odd way of renew youth 
and yet -PRON- declare that the elixir work in that manner -PRON- majesty take too much of -PRON- say prebble 
too much be dangerous not at all 
too much merely stupefie 
so the king be out of -PRON- sense 
nothing bad have befall -PRON- lord nyli i assure -PRON- 
be there many court physician dozen or more 
do -PRON- suppose the whole dozen of -PRON- be work over the king 
undoubtedly 
prebble could not restrain a groan dozen doctor captain say -PRON- turn in -PRON- direction apt to cause tragic complicatlon the doctor just then be a prolific source of danger for the professor andme and second only to the doctor stand count zylox and the chur guard 
the physician will do everything possible speak up lord nyli hope no doubt to set -PRON- at -PRON- ease 
could -PRON- not send word to the physician return prebble that all the king need be to be let alone physician i presume do not understand the king malady say nyli but certainly -PRON- can do no harm 
send word anyhow implore prebble 
tell the messenger to annournce at the palace that the stranger guarantee the king recovery but that the physician must not mix up in the matter 
if i do that and the king do not recover say lord nyli should be condemn to death -PRON- 
there be no use insist and the minute continue to drag 
-PRON- seem as though i have live an age before -PRON- eye eagerly scan the road see a small oyd car come fly to -PRON- lordships step 
one chur and one nyllite be the passenger 
bound to the ground the nyllite dash up the slope toward -PRON- flash the king ring in -PRON- hand come from princess cry the courier 
why the princess ylma 
i ask -PRON- 
if the king be not dead why be the princess ylma assume the prerogative of government 
what of the king demand the count 
-PRON- recover tell -PRON- so jubilate the professor 
be -PRON- well ask the count 
bar a headache 
the lord in wait be attend -PRON- 
what say the princess ylmar that under no circumstance be the stranger to be injure 
i begin to breathe once more 
prebble be again -PRON- cocksure and assertive self 
the count come forward and i think -PRON- look like a man 
-PRON- bow to -PRON- humbly 
pardon the disagreeable interruption say -PRON- 
when i come again -PRON- will be by -PRON- majestys command 
-PRON- give order to -PRON- chur and -PRON- defile toward -PRON- oyd car 
the messenger have already return to -PRON- and be race back whence -PRON- come presently the large car get in motion and -PRON- be leave alone with -PRON- genial host as before 
prebble settle -PRON- comfortably on -PRON- couch continue to delve for fact 
regard these chur say -PRON- be -PRON- animal pure and simple -PRON- lordship whether or not -PRON- have soul reply -PRON- lordship be a moot point 
-PRON- have a certain amount of reason but be so brutelike that only -PRON- superior mind hold -PRON- in check 
a commission of -PRON- wise man appoint by the king be now make experiment to discover whether the chur be imbue with the immortal gpark 
-PRON- be all slave 
every one outside the great wall 
if -PRON- be not hold down with a will of iron -PRON- would rebel and seek to overthrow -PRON- 
fear alone keep the horde of chur back of the great wall 
if -PRON- once lose this fear -PRON- would swarm over the wall and lie this kingdom in ashe 
wall query the professor scent another mystery 
boazar of illustrious memory encircle the land of the chur with a great wall of granite 
since then -PRON- mind have develop in power to an extent that give -PRON- no fear of -PRON- traditional enemy 
the only disaster that could befall -PRON- would be a dethronement of reason an eclipse of -PRON- faculty 
this would vive the chur -PRON- opportunity here -PRON- lordship straighten proudly -PRON- brain continue to improve while the chur continue to sink into barbarism and brutality 
some day -PRON- shall grow so strong that -PRON- can invade the country of the chur enslave -PRON- all and after that gradually train -PRON- and so well -PRON- condition 
-PRON- be the dream of boazar one day to emancipate the slave 
but this will not come for many generation not until such an act be entirely safe 
-PRON- speak of the chur as traditional cnemie -PRON- be here when lokai the bold break throuch the ice wall and settle the land an event which take place in the night of prehistoric time 
then the chur roam through the sun of the long day and through the blackness of the long night fighting rend each other like beast 
lokai war with -PRON- and drive -PRON- out with sword and spear 
but sword and spear be useless against -PRON- 
-PRON- multiply amazingly and return again and again to the attack 
only the irresistible power of the brain be efficacious and not until the descendant of lokai begin to develop and use these latent power be there any peace in the land 
this be glorious murmur the professor 
-PRON- be an ideal statea kingdom of the mind with the power of darkness under heel 
but here a poiht -PRON- ancestor lokai the bold penetrate the ice wall 
have -PRON- people never try to reach the world whence -PRON- come 
expedition after expedition have try but in all save one instance without success 
the cultivation of mental power have ill prepare -PRON- to cope with the rigor of ice and cold 
brute endurance be need there 
nevertheless in -PRON- own generation the ice have be successfully conquer by one gneiseti 
-PRON- do not live to return butsent back a gort plate tie to an eagle leg 
the gorr plate tell -PRON- thing of the outside world that have entirely wipe out all desire to know more about -PRON- 
gorr plate exclaim prebble deeper -PRON- go the thick the mystery 
what in the name of all that s good be a gorr plate 
-PRON- be a square of chalcedony a thought record 
-PRON- wish to communicate with one another so -PRON- send thought and impression not word 
on the chalcedony square -PRON- place -PRON- hand -PRON- think the thought record -PRON- in the plate 
the plate be send to the one -PRON- would have know -PRON- wish or experience and -PRON- or -PRON- layshand on the plate and the thought of the communicant come to the brain 
prebble jump to -PRON- foot and walk around -PRON- couch 
then -PRON- sit down again -PRON- head in -PRON- hand 
have -PRON- one of these gorr plate in -PRON- pocket -PRON- inquire 
lord nyli smile 
no but if i have -PRON- would be nothing but so much chalcedony to -PRON- 
-PRON- mindpardon mei not cultivate along the proper line 
at thls imply doubt of -PRON- mentallty prebble bristle up 
the next moment however the irritation pass 
will -PRON- read this gorr plate send home by gneisen -PRON- ask 
tt js in the archive of the king palace 
but i have the gist of -PRON- in -PRON- mind 
what be thought 
horrible 
-PRON- recordeei impression of two thing in particular that fill -PRON- with disgust and despair for the human race 
one of these thing be a thin silver disk with a womans head on one side and an eagle on the other 
there be also a motto in god -PRON- trust 
the desire to accumulate these fetich be so strong that people do not hesitate to betray a trust barter -PRON- honor and sometimes -PRON- life for the insensateobject there be those who have million more of these than -PRON- need and other who have not one 
-PRON- be a mad race accordmg to gneisen and many of the weak be crush trample on and slain 
the professor look at -PRON- and indulge in a sly wink 
-PRON- lordship be on ground familiar to -PRON- but neither prebble nor i have anything to say 
what be the other thing that fill -PRON- with disgust and despair lord nyli query the professor 
-PRON- be a brown fluid in glass receptacle go on -PRON- lordship fluid be even more insatiable in devour honor and life than be the silver disk 
-PRON- strike at the mind with sledgehammer blow accord to gneisen make rave beast of sensible man and finally bring horrible death 
the wonder be that sensible man would have anything to do with -PRON- 
do -PRON- know anything about this fluid believe i have hear of -PRON- mumble the professor 
talk about gorr plate be -PRON- possible to prebble thus deftly shift the topic 
the gorr platesi be wonderful enough but i be not particularly interested in -PRON- at that moment 
-PRON- fancy fly to princess ylma 
young beautiful only child of the reign kingwhat could there be in such a fate to commend the piin8ess to -PRON- lordship commiseration 
i resolve to find out 
at that moment lord nyli be deep in an earnest discussion with prebble and while wait for a chance to put in a word on -PRON- own account i fall asleep 
how long i sleep be of no importance 
the period seem brief but -PRON- may have be hour in duration i waken abruptly and start to a sit posture 
-PRON- lordship be go but on the couch near mine lie prebble count zylox stand over -PRON- 
behind the count be the same detachment of soldier that have accompany -PRON- on -PRON- previous visit 
the professor be just open -PRON- eye 
-PRON- here again -PRON- exclaim start up and cast a quick glance at the forbidding face of the chur 
by the king express command answer the count 
how be -PRON- royal highness inquire prebble 
-PRON- be feel much well and desire that -PRON- refill this flask forthwith 
the captain draw the bottle from the breast of -PRON- tunic and extend -PRON- toward prebble 
-PRON- majesty must have more of -PRON- elixir within the hour 
blockhead that -PRON- be 
why have -PRON- not foreseen this contingency 
still if -PRON- have foresee -PRON- what could -PRON- have do to save -PRON- 
-PRON- be possible -PRON- could have steal an oyd car give the zellin cube free reign and thus reach the pole 
would -PRON- have better -PRON- condition by so do 
may not the savage chur have kill -PRON- out of hand 
there be no time to waste in useless surmise 
count zylox represent the king and the king mean business 
mercy on -PRON- man gurgle the proiessor 
do -PRON- think i carry a supply of the elixir around with -PRON- and have -PRON- constantly on tap 
the count smile sardonically think nothing at all 
the king command that i bring -PRON- the elixir within the hour 
if -PRON- refuse to comply with -PRON- reasonable demand i be to convey -PRON- into the serene presence the point of a spear 
as to which i do i be indifferent 
zlox have educate -PRON- head at the expense of -PRON- heart 
-PRON- have no kindly feel for -PRON- and order be order old prebble 
i see -PRON- now as i see -PRON- then clasp -PRON- bony hand shake as with an aue look despairingly from the count to the file of chur 
suddenly -PRON- sink back on the couch with a muffled groan -PRON- stony cye uptdrned to the cloudless vault overhead 
where be lord nylis 
i strike in think -PRON- host may devise some way out of the difficulty 
nyli can be of no assistance to -PRON- return the officer frigidly 
be i to have the elixir or be i not must consult privately with the other prophet -PRON- companion say prebble be a matter of some moment 
have i -PRON- permission to engage -PRON- friend in a brief conversation escape be impossible warn count zylox sternly 
lam a0 t contemplate anything of that sort 
very well 
proceed with -PRON- conversation 
the professor get up come over to -PRON- couch and sit down beside -PRON- 
captain say -PRON- be -PRON- asleep or do -PRON- wake up in time to hear what be go on overheard -PRON- all i reply 
well what be -PRON- to do in this case not a thing -PRON- can do so far as i can discover 
the king have send an ultimatum more elixir or death to the stranger 
-PRON- be a mistake to tell the king that the bourbon be a product of -PRON- skill presume reflect prebble that the whisky could be distil but -PRON- would take time 
and the king be in a hurry get to fill the flask at once or suffer the consequence 
then -PRON- must suffer the consequence say i chieerlessly 
the professor problem be grow more and more difficult of solution 
largely -PRON- present predicament be owe to the professor extravagant claim with respect to -PRON- power as prophet 
a prophet be not really a wizard and yet -PRON- learned companion in -PRON- conference with the king have rather imply that such be the case while count zylox watch warily from a distance and the barbarian of -PRON- guard stand ready to discorage any attempt at escape the professor pucker up -PRON- brow and turn the matter over in -PRON- mind 
-PRON- may as well give up prebble say harass -PRON- with further posing 
-PRON- canot conjure a demijohn of rum out of the air 
tell zylox to do -PRON- bad 
if -PRON- could secure another audience with the king return prebble -PRON- may be able to do something that would postpone -PRON- fate deceive -PRON- 
the king be thoroughly in earnest 
when an appetite for bourbon be arouse -PRON- know how difficult -PRON- be to combat -PRON- donone well 
the imperial appetite wait only upon the imperial will and the king word be law 
but captain perhaps if i tell -PRON- majesty that a little time would be require to minister to -PRON- desire -PRON- would grant a stay of sentence that would only prolong the agony say and what s the use 
while there s life there s hope 
so long as -PRON- can keep from be spit on the lance of the chur or from be draw and quarter by oyd and suboyd i choose to believe that chance of ultimate escape will favor -PRON- 
that may be 
i be as anxious to live as -PRON- be prebble for the object of -PRON- lifelong ambition have be to attain the pole 
now that -PRON- be so near the pole -PRON- seem too bad that chance and a flask of bourbon should conspire to disappoint -PRON- 
suppose -PRON- could escape now murmur the professor with a wary glance at zylox and the churssuch a supposition be folly 
i protest 
no one know what a man can do to save -PRON- life until -PRON- be put to the test 
a rush an exchange of blow and a little of that fortune which favor the brave and the desperate may carry -PRON- to the road and the oyd car 
then away captainaway with the screen tear from the cube of zellin and -PRON- speed an eagle flight 
i stare at -PRON- in amazement 
if -PRON- own action in seek to escape from the throne room have be reckless and illconsidere present suggestion be even more so 
-PRON- be out of -PRON- wit prebble say in the first place -PRON- could never get clear of this press of chur alive 
take that for grant at the outset grant -PRON- this captain that -PRON- be a forlorn hope but well that than nohope at all 
-PRON- be not even a forlorn hope go onseverely 
suppose -PRON- reach the car therewould remain the operating of -PRON- 
what do -PRON- know about that 
-PRON- know what lord ll tell -PRON- on the way here answer the professor confidently 
all one have to do in drive an ovd car be to lift the screen and steer 
admit that -PRON- could escape from the guard and reach and successfully operate the car where be -PRON- to go 
anywhere 
safety lie in flight sali and where that flight take -PRON- be not a particular point 
yes -PRON- ismost particular 
if -PRON- could get to the pole and fall into the hand of the chur 
not that well i shall not join -PRON- in any such mad enterprise 
if argument canot save -PRON- force certainly can not 
-PRON- get up and go back to -PRON- own couch 
fling -PRON- down on -PRON- back -PRON- fix -PRON- eye thoughtfully upon the zenith 
see that -PRON- interview have terminate the impatient zylox approach the professor 
have -PRON- decide the count demand be wait to be move in the business mumble the professor 
time press return zylox ask -PRON- be i to have the elixir or be i not 
-PRON- be screech prebble hurl -PRON- to -PRON- foot tell the king i be a great prophet and -PRON- shall see i be not without honor even in this country 
obsrv 
watch 
i shall work a spell to fulfill the king desire 
ah ha 
room there 
give -PRON- room 
-PRON- zave -PRON- room plenty of -PRON- 
i fear that danger have suddenly turn the professor brain and that -PRON- have go stark staring mad 
-PRON- whoop -PRON- howl -PRON- throw -PRON- inte the most amazing attitude and fan the air with -PRON- arm 
i look on horrified 
count zylox gaze at the contortion of -PRON- learned friend in startled wonder 
as for the chur -PRON- superstitious mind be imagine dire thing and -PRON- seem more than half inclined to run 
suddenly the air above -PRON- be rent with a terrific explosion 
simultaneously with the explo sion the heavens be light by a flash of reddish fire ghastly in the broad light of day 
every eye turn aloft 
a blaze balloon be drop earthward like a lead plummet and follow the airy track of the balloon at slow pace and with hairfaising gyration be parachute two man be cling to theparachute recognize one of -PRON- as -PRON- rival griffyn the other as pollock -PRON- secretary and companion 
the burn balloon drop into the roadway the wickerwork car load with food scientific instrument and other impedimenta strike the ground with a prodigious thump 
griffyn and -PRON- companion alight a moment later on the terrace and not more than a dozen foot from prebble 
the englishman be stun by the shock and lie on the ground in a state of dazed bewilderment 
without loss of a second prebble bound to griffyn bent over -PRON- search -PRON- pocket and arise triumphantly with a nickel plate flask 
turn upon the astourtde captain of the guard prebble present the flask with a low bow 
the elixir be not in the same flask count say -PRON- but i do not think -PRON- majesty will be overparticular 
-PRON- give -PRON- great pleasure to comply with -PRON- majestys command 
prebble be not mad on the contrary -PRON- wasj very levellleaded 
but what would -PRON- have do if there have be no flask in the pocket of either griffyn or -PRON- secretary 
the professor afterward tell -PRON- that in fall backward on the couch the despair gaze -PRON- turn upward have encounter the balioon 
the airship be in difficulty plunge wildly and make ready to fall 
griftyn and pollock be even then take to the void with theirparachute 
idea come rapidly continue prebble for be between the chur and the deep sea so to speak and -PRON- life as well as mine hang in the balance 
chance be that either griffyn or pollock have a flask and those be the chance i have to take 
a special providence watch over child andand other captain and i get the flask 
i think count zylox be deeply impressed 
at any rate -PRON- hand tremble as -PRON- take the flask from prebble 
the chur be flat on the ground face downward 
-PRON- be -PRON- customary attitude when anything occur which to -PRON- be supernatural 
before the count entirely recover or the chur arise griffyn be on -PRON- foot and have advance to where i be stand 
-PRON- face be vacuous -PRON- eye stare know -PRON- but -PRON- be one thing to cut a man from -PRON- balloon and launch -PRON- into eternity and another thing to meet -PRON- again front to front 
finally -PRON- speak but there be no sense to -PRON- word 
i answer -PRON- and that -PRON- fail to understand -PRON- be evident from the blank lvok -PRON- wear haf be wrong 
have i forget -PRON- mother tongue 
remove the talk ring captain suggest prebble give -PRON- english and -PRON- be give -PRON- nyll 
i remove the talk ring 
while wear -PRON- i think in nyll talk in -PRON- and -PRON- own language be a dead letter 
captain sali breathe griffyn 
captain sali can i belive -PRON- eye 
-PRON- cast a brother mariner adrift in nudheaven say i cuttingly 
no wonder -PRON- be surprised to meet -PRON- again alive and hearty 
-PRON- take a base advantage of -PRON- -PRON- protest warmly 
-PRON- attach yeurselve to the drag anchor in the hope of reach the pole neck and neck with -PRON- 
rubbish explode a sane man griffyn and -PRON- do not really think that prebble and i would do such a thing and run the risk of have -PRON- life batter out against the top of some iceberg 
-PRON- mutter in -PRON- beard 
at last -PRON- observe -PRON- have be hover over this country for hour drive back and forth by one current and then another 
the intense heat or something else burst -PRON- balloon and the have no interest in -PRON- misadventure say i coldly 
-PRON- cut -PRON- adrift and -PRON- be save by a miracle only to find -PRON- in the midst of a sea of danger 
-PRON- will be youlr business to share some of these danger with -PRON- 
pollock come up just then burst with question 
but pollock be the kind of man i leave out of -PRON- calculation 
-PRON- be the son of a rich distiller i have be inform and -PRON- father have help -PRON- to a place in expedition by subscribe twenty thousand pound to the exploration fund 
count zylox and prebble be hold an animate conversation and i don -PRON- talk ring to take part in -PRON- 
these be the two fiend speak of in that tradition of your count the wily professor be say 
take -PRON- back with -PRON- to the king keep -PRON- in confinement and watch -PRON- well 
tt shall be do the count answer cheerfully 
-PRON- be show a good deal of respect for -PRON- since the professor have work -PRON- spell 
tell the king i put in that -PRON- request -PRON- not to deal with the prisoner in a summary manner 
prebble throw a surprised look at -PRON- 
-PRON- could not understand i suppose why i wish to spare the englishman when -PRON- have show no disposition to spare -PRON- will carry -PRON- message to the king say count zylox 
thereupon -PRON- order the chur to make prisoner of griffyn and pollock but the englishman set -PRON- shoulder together and prepare to resist 
i have never doubt courage so i be not surprlse to find -PRON- show -PRON- tooth -PRON- begin to jook call the count to -PRON- as though these stranger would have to be roughly deal with 
would -PRON- care to speak with -PRON- and give -PRON- a little good advice know of no way in which -PRON- could serve -PRON- better will see what i can do say i 
then remove the mystical ring from iy brow i step up in front of griffyn and pollock be rash griffyn i advise -PRON- be outnumber and -PRON- have just come through a severe shake up 
by jove -PRON- cry brandish -PRON- fist if these swab be sicken for something well do -PRON- good to oblige -PRON- 
what sort of a way be this to receive stranger be tactful and -PRON- will find these people hospitable and kind 
resort to violence and -PRON- will let loose a storm that will break on -PRON- own head know because i have have some experience with the way of the country 
what sort of a country be -PRON- 
really magnificentand something of a paradox 
the inhabitant be wel advanced in the art and science and the labor of the ruling race be entirely on the mental order 
i havenot be here long enough to make any detailed explanation but i can assure -PRON- that a resort to fisticufl will not prosper vour cause 
what have -PRON- in -PRON- hand there -PRON- ask survey the object curiously 
an example of the scientific progress -PRON- have find in this country i answer 
this be a talk ring and talk ring -PRON- echo wideeye 
precisely 
by adjust -PRON- properly be able to think in the language of the people and to talk to -PRON- and to understand -PRON- 
what bally nonsense be -PRON- give -PRON- be try to tell -PRON- thing which -PRON- incredulity will not allow -PRON- to believe say but for all that i be speak the truth 
-PRON- be put in the professor but -PRON- be waste -PRON- time 
count zylox in charge of the guard be go to take -PRON- and pollock alive or dead to the king of the country 
sali out of a generous feeling toward -PRON- which be not warrant by -PRON- past behavior have volunteer to pursuade -PRON- to go with the count without resistance 
if -PRON- be wise griffyn -PRON- will heed the advice of captain sali 
salis have something at the back of -PRON- head declare griffyn suspiciously 
what be -PRON- up to -PRON- fling at -PRON- pointblank 
justify although i may be in act and think otherwise i answer do not wish to see any harm come to -PRON- griffyn 
-PRON- be try to beat -PRON- out in come at the pole 
something tell -PRON- that -PRON- be play the game even now 
where do -PRON- think -PRON- be griffyn 
i inquire 
in what latitude and longitude havenot be able to take an observation for some time and i havenot the least idea say -PRON- 
-PRON- will discover all about that and many other thing of interest to -PRON- if -PRON- go peacefully with count zylox not -PRON- cry obstinately 
here -PRON- add reach out -PRON- hand let -PRON- take -PRON- talk ring 
if -PRON- be all -PRON- say give this count a piece of -PRON- mind in short order 
prebble look at -PRON- and shake -PRON- head mean to signify that -PRON- would not be safe just then to make -PRON- possible for griffyn to converse understandingly with count zylox 
griffyn may do other thing besides give the count a piece of -PRON- mind 
for instance -PRON- would have be possible for -PRON- to give information that would be a detriment to prebble and -PRON- 
i shall not allow -PRON- to sample the power of -PRON- talk ring i answer 
do -PRON- know what -PRON- impression be ask griffyn donot know as that matter materially but -PRON- may as well tell -PRON- 
-PRON- and prebble be mad 
as pollock and i come down onthe parachute -PRON- see prebble throw -PRON- about in a crazy sort of way 
why do -PRON- rob -PRON- of -PRON- flask 
why do -PRON- hand -PRON- over to that fellow in the mother hubbard a black business afoot sali if -PRON- turn out that -PRON- and -PRON- friend be not mad 
will -PRON- go peaceably 
i ask to cut the conference short 
-PRON- be go to fight to the last breath -PRON- aver 
i put on the talk ring and step back 
-PRON- wonot listen to reason count zylox say take -PRON- but do -PRON- carefully 
again the count order -PRON- chur to make prisoner of griffyn and pollock 
although -PRON- resist like true driton -PRON- be easily overcome and bear away 
zylox would also have carry off the wreek of the balloon have not prebble vigorously object 
i could not imagine what prebble want with the remain of the airship 
in du urse however -PRON- idea be communicate to -PRON- and i find -PRON- particularly bright 
the departure of zylox and th guard with the prisoner leave prebble and -PRON- alone and to -PRON- own device 
during these momentous event lord nyli have not show -PRON- 
nor have any one issue from the palace to make inquiry or to take part in the proceeding 
the hour be ripe for something of moment to transpire and i be not keep long in suspense 
now captain say prebble after a swift precautionary glance around -PRON- -PRON- must get to work without loss of time 
at what sort of work 
i inquire 
-PRON- will find out presently 
-PRON- must act first and then do -PRON- talk 
-PRON- gather up -PRON- tunic about -PRON- thin leg and put off down the terrace toward the road 
i hurry along in -PRON- wake and ome -PRON- beside the wickerwork balloon car 
nothing remain of the basket but a jumble of broken reed 
there be a water can knocked into a cocked hat and trickle -PRON- content over the road also a number of scientific instrument a shotgun and cartridze lelt and a bag contain pemmican and ship biscuit 
the scientific instrument be ruin but the bag of food be in good condition and the gun and ammunition appear to be uninjure 
bring the biscuit and pemmican captain say prebble take possession of the firearm and belt stow these away where -PRON- can find -PRON- when want and then hold a council of war 
the article be hide in a clump of bush and -PRON- return to -PRON- couch on the terrace 
prebble be rub -PRON- hand delightedly count on find the food say -PRON- but the shotgun and the ammunition be a stroke of luck 
just what -PRON- need too think of make a run for -PRON- be -PRON- 
i ask -PRON- return look around apprehensively 
come over to -PRON- couch -PRON- sit down beside -PRON- nothing else for -PRON- captain -PRON- proceed am of -PRON- opinion i return 
-PRON- position here be become untenable -PRON- resume 
the king will want more of the elixir and if -PRON- be not forthcome -PRON- will be impale on the same spear and convey into the royal presence 
-PRON- may have reason that out before say think -PRON- but -PRON- need time in which to recuperate after -PRON- long fast and to adjust -PRON- to certain of the country 
food and rest have prepare -PRON- physically and now that -PRON- be acquaint with the mechanism of the oyd car and be possess of a shotgun and a bag of food -PRON- be well equipped for flight 
-PRON- must have the car 
car be plentiful 
-PRON- will lie in wait along the road then with the aid of the shotgun -PRON- can take possession of the first car that come along 
after that away to the south en route for home 
to the south i exclaim 
certalnly -PRON- canot go astray captain 
the cube of iron will draw -PRON- along the proper road 
-PRON- will make in the direction of least resistance 
good heaven 
i rie -PRON- think the oyd car will carry -PRON- over the ice wall and the open sea how do -PRON- know there be an open sea as for the ice wall que transtulii sustinet 
-PRON- good star be above -PRON- 
south -PRON- must goit be the only way 
-PRON- be not the only way 
i declare 
-PRON- hope lie in the zellin cube and -PRON- must go whither -PRON- take -PRON- 
to the land of the chur -PRON- dear sir palpitate prebble 
-PRON- would be slaughter on sight 
have -PRON- not have sufficient experience with these man brute 
remember how superstitious the chur be i urge 
the report of that revolver be enough to vanquish -PRON- and now -PRON- have a shotgun 
think of that read -PRON- captain say the professor disgruntle 
griffyn have arrive 
-PRON- fear that -PRON- will reach the pole first impel -PRON- to take any chance however desperate 
i go south sir 
and i go north 
i return firmly 
-PRON- will divide the pemmican and the ship hiscuit 
and the shotgun -PRON- ask coolly 
-PRON- will draw straw for the shotgun 
-PRON- can get -PRON- own oyd car and i will -PRON- can not quarrel over this matter interrupt prebble nor can -PRON- divide -PRON- slender force and resource in the face of such a desperate contingency 
-PRON- must stand or falt together captain sali be in charge of the expedition say i sternly 
when -PRON- join -PRON- -PRON- agree to obey order 
-PRON- be quite correct -PRON- answer be overlook that point be resolve to bear away to the land of the chur 
that be what -PRON- shall do 
-PRON- be under -PRON- order and -PRON- will obey whatever hist 
-PRON- lordship 
i look up hastily 
lord nyli be approach -PRON- across the terrace 
klimon in the road below be sit in the point of -PRON- lordship conveyance gentleman begin lord nylis -PRON- face trouble the fame of -PRON- elixir have spread throughout the kingdom 
to the lord in wait -PRON- majesty have describe -PRON- effect upon the system so eloquently that all be wild to try the new fluid for -PRON- 
the second flask the king claim as -PRON- own to the last drop 
but -PRON- order -PRON- through -PRON- to work another spell for one thousand keese of the elixir 
if not too much trouble to -PRON- -PRON- desire that -PRON- have -PRON- fall at the palace step 
menial be already wait there with goblet 
-PRON- heart smote wildly against -PRON- rib 
have -PRON- be too late with -PRON- pilan for flight 
how much be a keese -PRON- lordship 
prebble inquire with a businesslike air two blick make one keese 
a blick i should say be about the quantity contain in the second flask 
in other word say prebble briskly the king want two thousand flask of -PRON- elixir rain down in front of -PRON- palace 
the menial arewaite -PRON- lordship repeat and the king household be impatient 
-PRON- shall have to repair to the king palace to make the incantation say prebble 
while speak -PRON- telegraph -PRON- a message with -PRON- if -PRON- flee -PRON- must be now or never 
whether north or south make little difference 
the thing be to get away before the household grow too impatient imagine as much remark -PRON- lordship gravely 
if -PRON- gentleman will descend to the oyd car will retire into the palace for ten minute or less and rejoin -PRON- the moment i have finish the business that detain -PRON- 
this be important or i should not delay 
nothing could have be more opportune 
-PRON- lordship go one way and prebble and i the other 
the bag of food and the gun mutter prebble 
-PRON- must have those before -PRON- go to the oyd car 
proceed to the clump of bush -PRON- bring out the article 
as the executive end of the expedition i assume charge of the gun and belt strap the latter over -PRON- tunic about -PRON- waist 
next -PRON- steal silently upon the oyd car 
approach the unconscious klimon from the rear i tumble -PRON- incontinently into the road and jump into -PRON- seat 
prebble be already up behind 
with the shotgun firmly hold between -PRON- knee i bend over the power box and lift the screen 
away jump the car with a suddenness that almost throw the professor into the road 
and not an instant too soon 
the dazed klimon have bound to -PRON- foot and grab at the rear of the vehicle miss -PRON- by no more than a hairbreadth 
-PRON- pursue -PRON- but -PRON- may as well have try to overtake a whirlwind 
-PRON- be head for the land of the chur and for the north pole 
all fear be lose in the excitement of the moment 
-PRON- nerve be not so prey upon that reason fail -PRON- and while bend over the zellin box one hand on the screen and the other on the steering lever i have a few thought pertinent to the situation 
when -PRON- have leave the king palace klimon have use the zellin cube 
that mean of course that -PRON- have proceed in a northerly direction 
to use the suboyd power as represent by the iron block would have be to drive back through the heart of the kingdom 
flight in that direction mean undoubted capture 
another pomnt i be not sufficiently familiar with oyd car to distinguish the iron box from the zellin box 
-PRON- lordship car however have just come from the king palace 
the zellin cube must have be use and therefor -PRON- be reasonable to infer that this cube be still ready for duty 
i do not pull out the screen to -PRON- full extent and thus give the car the full power 
-PRON- could easily distance klimon with half the oyd force and i want to accustom -PRON- to run the machine before urge -PRON- to -PRON- utmost 
the car be easily handle 
the rear wheel be the rudder and -PRON- resistance be strong in move any way short of due north 
the feel of the tiller if i may be allow the expression be an indication of the direction -PRON- be go 
as i figure -PRON- -PRON- be head north by east 
suddenly i be startle out of -PRON- reflection 
directly ahead and bear down on -PRON- be the official oyd car contain count zylox and the detachment of the guard 
a groan come from prebble after -PRON- captain be the burden of -PRON- lament 
i be of the same opinion 
but there be no retreat for -PRON- and -PRON- must go ahead and look pleasant 
keep a stiff upper lip prebble i call over -PRON- shoulder wave -PRON- hand and laugh as -PRON- pass the count think be out for a little spin just for the fun of the thing 
-PRON- may think be bind for the palace say the professor revive 
-PRON- wonot think that be go directly away from the palace 
then -PRON- canot be come from the palace can -PRON- 
no but -PRON- may be after -PRON- all the same there 
now hail -PRON- laugh and be hearty about -PRON- 
the count have slow down -PRON- car and be watch -PRON- with surprise and suspicion 
ahoy there count 
i yell as -PRON- speed by 
how be i for a navigator anyway prebble give a laugh but there be not much heartiness in if 
where be -PRON- go shout the count 
yes roar back at -PRON- to understand draw out the screen a little farther could not look behind and manage the car so i ask prebble what the count be do keep right on return the professor 
great colossus -PRON- sputter aghast 
what now 
i demand 
klimon dash along the road captain meet the count of course 
tell -PRON- whether the count stop to talk with the chur prebble 
lopk alive now right in front of the official car salis 
the count have get to halt or run over the chur wave -PRON- hand 
well i dare not take -PRON- attention from -PRON- work to look behind but have to depend on the professor to keep -PRON- informed of what be go on 
-PRON- shall soon be push to the last extremity captain cry prebble 
-PRON- ought to be use to that by this time i answer grimly 
the count have stop -PRON- car and be talk with klimon mean pursuit by a highpowered car a car that can walk upon -PRON- hand over fist klimon fling -PRON- into the official car go on prebble and there be nothing else for couldnot resist look back 
the official car be just turn to head toward -PRON- as i fling the look over -PRON- shoulder 
at that moment -PRON- speed over an uneven place in the road 
i lurch wildly and be throw down on the zellin box 
one of -PRON- hand be on the slide screen and as i drop forward the screen be push home abruptly shut off the power of the cube and bring -PRON- to a slow pace so abruptly that prebble already wabble because of the thankyoumaam go by the board precipitately 
i have a fleeting glimpse of -PRON- stand on -PRON- head heel in the air 
abandon the professor be farth fromi -PRON- mind and i jam down on the brake and bring the car to a standstill 
prebble 
i yell 
-PRON- be lie sprawl out on the earth a dozen foot behind 
as ill luck would have -PRON- -PRON- be silent and inert and apparently have meet with injury which may prove serious 
in the distance approach swiftly be the other car moment be precious but i leap from the seat and be about to start for prebble when -PRON- suddenly sit up 
come on 
i shout 
hurry 
although daze -PRON- be not long in pick up the trend of event 
-PRON- see the car with -PRON- laad of warlike chur and scramble to -PRON- foot with mere haste than grace 
merciful power -PRON- stutter 
-PRON- have almost gain the car when -PRON- whirl and turn back 
what be -PRON- try to do 
i roar 
just at that moment i see -PRON- bend and pick up the glitter circlet 
the talk ring have drop from -PRON- head during -PRON- fall and -PRON- have go back after -PRON- couldnot understand -PRON- -PRON- pant as -PRON- scramble to -PRON- place in -PRON- wait vehicle 
if be the count and be -PRON- then never mind that 
i cut in 
hang on prebble for be go to start on the hih speed 
very good captain 
the more peed the well 
i jerk the screen half through the slot and -PRON- shoot ahead like an arrow from a bow 
the machine be wrench in every part and i fear for a second that -PRON- would be rive to piece 
happily -PRON- fear be without foundation 
the car hold togetherand -PRON- fly onward like the wind a poor navigator captain call the professor 
this be -PRON- first experience withthis kind of a ship i call back to -PRON- 
what do -PRON- do 
try to look behind 
while i be about -PRON- the machine strike a high place in the road and the power be shut off 
-PRON- grunt a wonder i do not break -PRON- neck captain say -PRON- be stun for an instant 
when i sit up i hear -PRON- call but couldinot understand what -PRON- say 
the sight of that other car be enough though to remind -PRON- of what be go forward lose time when -PRON- have no time to lose 
-PRON- be under the heel of fortune and must put up with whatever come 
-PRON- should have shoot klimon 
have -PRON- do that -PRON- may have escape without have the official car take after -PRON- 
deal in such murderous fashion with even a chur be not in -PRON- 
nevertheless i could see now how -PRON- may have be well for -PRON- to put klimon out of the way 
watch the car behind professor 
i caution watch go on the chur be get ready to use -PRON- dpear 
what the professor have saidabout use the shotgun on klimon have give -PRON- an idea 
i be bide only the proper moment to put -PRON- into execution make short work of -PRON- captain shrill the professor if -PRON- overhaul -PRON- small doubt of that return letween -PRON- tooth can see the count eye flame like live coal 
this race be offer -PRON- a chance to even up old score 
and hell improve the opportunity if -PRON- can gain gaining whoop prebble -PRON- be useless for -PRON- to attempt to escape from the official car 
-PRON- have a threefoot cube of zellin equivalent to a draw power of seventytwa man 
-PRON- machine on the contrary be equip with only a block 
even allow for the add bulk and heavy load of the count car -PRON- be greatly outclass 
i open the screen to -PRON- wide and at time -PRON- seem hardly to touch the road so fast do -PRON- go 
be -PRON- hold -PRON- own prebble 
i cry still gain -PRON- answer 
there come a spear where do -PRON- strike 
ten foot behind -PRON- 
half a minute pass 
another spear chatter prebble six foot behind 
i mutter an exclamation 
the count have gain four foot in thirty second and something wotld have to be do at once prebble i shout come here and run the car canot -PRON- exclaim 
yes -PRON- can -PRON- will have to what be -PRON- go to do 
never mind 
time be too precious to waste tatk 
on hand and knee -PRON- creep to the forward point of the car and slip into the driver seat as i vacate -PRON- steer a boat 
i ask -PRON- lip to -PRON- ear 
-PRON- nod steer in the same way 
keep a firm grip on the helm or -PRON- will get a broken rib 
with this warning i creep back to the middle seat the shotgun in -PRON- hand 
the official car look like a sailless junk load to the gunwale with pirate 
shield and spear bristle in the sun and out of the center of the phalanx gleam the white face of count zylox gloomy and ominous 
stop -PRON- cry fiercely 
i pay no attention to the word but rivet -PRON- eye on the front of the official car 
two chur sit in the point one manage the steering lever and the other the screen 
at -PRON- foot between -PRON- be the large box hold the zellin cube 
a quick thought plunge through -PRON- brain 
i hesitate but a moment and then kneel on the broad seat i throw up the breech of thegun there be a cartridge each barrel 
throw the piece to -PRON- shoulder i take a long and careful aim at the zellin box 
a spear clove the air narrowly miss -PRON- head 
that be -PRON- signal to pull the trigger 
bang 
the recoil wrench -PRON- shoulder and nearly throw -PRON- from the seat 
when the smoke lift i see that i have work havoc enough 
that single charge have tear away the front and side of the zellin box cause trouble with the steering gear and prick the shin of the chur in the point the driver and the helmsman scare out of -PRON- wit have hurl -PRON- into the road 
the rest of -PRON- red companion follow -PRON- and flatten out along the ground leave only count zylox in the car 
what contortion that wonderful machine go through 
jerk ahead by a force as of seventytwo chur the broken helm thrashing in all divection -PRON- zigzag here and there jump aloft with wheel whir and finally crash into a tree at the roadside and lie a complete wreck count zylox i be glad to note have hurl -PRON- from the car before the final catastrophe and be suffer from nothing more than a few a a wail from the professor call -PRON- attention from the scene behind go -PRON- go go the screen cover 
i draw -PRON- from the box to get the entire force of the cube and the tiller jam sideways and knock -PRON- out of -PRON- hand 
i be angry for this carelessness of the professor be like to cost -PRON- dear -PRON- be not pursue -PRON- be true but -PRON- car be run away with -PRON- 
the only power -PRON- have over -PRON- be to guide -PRON- a little to right and leave 
-PRON- could not stop or diminish the speed 
-PRON- gait be that of the empire state express and the track before -PRON- have suddenly widen into all outdoors 
where -PRON- have leave the road i do not know but -PRON- be race across a broad plain hot sandy level as a floor 
there be no house no tree no rocksnothe to impede -PRON- progicss 
this be well consider -PRON- limited ability in handle the oyd car peer ahecad 
in ilie distance there rise from the earih a cloud like haze funnelshaped and resemble the swirl vortex of a cyclone 
what be -PRON- 
i have no time to debate the question even have i be so disposed 
the wall 
the wall shriek prebble 
yes there be the great wall build to hem in the chur 
-PRON- stretch across the plain as far as the eye could see and appear to encircle the column of smoke or dust or whatever -PRON- be 
as -PRON- charge toward -PRON- and -PRON- come plainer and plainer into view i conclude that -PRON- must be at least thirty foot in height of solid masonry pierce with one brazen gate toward which -PRON- be head 
the gate twenty foot wide and twenty high look forbid enough but well a colliston with that than with the granite wall 
port -PRON- helm prebble 
i shout 
port 
as -PRON- move the tiller i see a score of the red fiend silhouette on top of the wall 
-PRON- be look at -PRON- whoop dancing and beat -PRON- spear against -PRON- shield 
prebble begzin a paternostr but i cut -PRON- short with the remain barrel of the shotgun fire into the air 
the chur melt from the wall as if by magic 
-PRON- see 
i shout triumphantly 
this gun be go to do the business for -PRON- prebble 
that wall be go to do the business -PRON- fling back head for the gate 
i answer 
do -PRON- think -PRON- can smash open the gate and ride through the land of the chur straight to the pole -PRON- retort grimly 
make -PRON- peace with heaven sali be a smashup in less than a minute get to jump say as calmly as possible 
well to jump than have -PRON- life batter out against the gate 
while speak i throw out the bag of pemmican and ship biscuit 
the bag strike the ground spring twenty foot into the air and fall again in a shower of sand 
and -PRON- have get to go through that cry the professor not be a whole bone leave in -PRON- body 
jump 
i shout 
follow -PRON- 
out i go shotgun in hand 
when i come down i must have turn a dozen somersault 
the gun leave -PRON- hand and the talk re -PRON- head 
i rip -PRON- toga to rag and would have lose -PRON- utterly have not the cartridge belt hold -PRON- remnant about -PRON- waist 
after a second or two i realize that i be sit on the sand watch a figure fly upward from the point of the oyd car squirm through the air drop and ricochet along the ground halting at last a mere heap of humanity in a wrecked tunic 
be the professor dead or alive 
as i pick -PRON- up painfully to go forward and investigate a crashing sound reach -PRON- from the gate 
look toward that point i note with wonder that the barrier have not withstand the impact of the zellin cube 
the gate be ajar various piece of the oyd car pile in the opening 
prebble be on -PRON- foot before i reach -PRON- -PRON- still wear -PRON- buskin and be frantically engage in tie the remain of the tunic about -PRON- waist 
yes -PRON- cry angrily -PRON- would come north captain 
reason circumstance evervthe point south 
but no -PRON- would go north or nowhere 
and now look at -PRON- 
-PRON- pick up -PRON- talk ring and jam -PRON- down on -PRON- head 
-PRON- say something else but as -PRON- be talk nyll and i be listen in english the sense of -PRON- be lose upon -PRON- 
-PRON- be clear to -PRON- that -PRON- be not very seriously hurt and i go back for -PRON- own talk ring and the gun the professor be sorely out of patience with everybody and everything 
-PRON- have have two fall from the oyd car and the first one alone would have sour -PRON- temper but for the excitement attend the pursuit 
this second fall be far more dangerous and annoying than the first and i could not blame -PRON- for display some rancor to become of -PRON- sali the professo demand survey -PRON- as though -PRON- consider -PRON- salvation -PRON- part of the work cantell -PRON- better about that in a few minate i answer dizzy in brain and weak in the leg 
the only way i could hold -PRON- upright be by jeane on the shotgun 
if -PRON- isnot one thing -PRON- two scowl prebble 
how be -PRON- to get out of this wish i know 
-PRON- strike -PRON- though that the farther -PRON- can get away from that smash gate the well -PRON- will be for -PRON- 
come on prebble 
i reel to an about face and begin stagger off along the wall 
prebble shout an angry protest and i turn to discover that -PRON- have piumpe -PRON- down in the sand 
how do -PRON- think i can move -PRON- groan joint in -PRON- body be unhinge 
look where i light and -PRON- point to a gougedout spot in the earth 
no man could hit the ground like that without be half kill 
if -PRON- linger here until the chur come out say finish the job willing -PRON- declare resignedly have quantum sufficit 
be flesh and blood and not whalebone and india rubber -PRON- body tell -PRON- when i have bear hardship to the limit of endurance 
if -PRON- be bind to go on sali good by 
-PRON- be impossible for -PRON- to accompany -PRON- 
buck up answer wish i could but i canot 
here let -PRON- help -PRON- decline to be interfere with to stay righthere so that the chur can have a good chance at -PRON- 
why be -PRON- hang back 
why donot -PRON- show -PRON- 
i look toward the break gate 
the oyd car be heap fantastically in the middle of -PRON- but there be no sign of chur te be see 
the roar of the gun have frighten -PRON- i explain 
-PRON- couldnot frighten all the chur but only those who be on the wall 
where be the rest not theorize about the rest the present situation that concern -PRON- 
remember what happen at the lake when that revolver be fire 
those who hear the report drop pronc on -PRON- face but those who didnot hear the report refuse to be awe by the description the other cave of -PRON- 
there il be a smother of the hairy demon ail around -PRON- before long 
somie messenzer have revive and go after -PRON- 
the professor voice be hopeful appear to be honestly glad that -PRON- misadventurc be soon to be terminate 
-PRON- voice be strong and robust 
from that i gather that -PRON- be not so severely injure as -PRON- be try to make -PRON- believe 
let -PRON- lift -PRON- to -PRON- lcet professor i suggest and then i can support -PRON- while -PRON- make -PRON- escape 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- dblankly 
escape -PRON- echo 
why do -PRON- talk about such a thing 
where be -PRON- to escape to 
be there any haven of refuge in all this region for -PRON- and -PRON- 
if -PRON- go back the nyllite will catch -PRON- if -PRON- go forward then -PRON- fall into the hand of the chur not a spot in all this henighte country wherewe can call -PRON- safe 
-PRON- should have go south in the direction of the ice wall 
i see that i must reason with -PRON- companion and get -PRON- back into a normal state of mind 
tl adfnit professor say that -PRON- situation seem hopeless but have -PRON- not seem equally hopeless several time before this 
and havenot -PRON- always manage to slip through the gather danger get to be a first time captain when -PRON- fail to slip through -PRON- answer shake -PRON- head forebodingly 
personally i think -PRON- have come to that time have hope i go on take another tack that -PRON- would live to give to the world -PRON- proof regard the meteoric theory of the aurora 
possibly there be more glory in that for -PRON- than for -PRON- in discover the pole what i dislike about this chur business say -PRON- a flash 9f pride cross -PRON- dusty face proof -PRON- add fondly which scientific man can not dodge have to delieve -PRON- 
i intend to write a book that will place -PRON- name high on the scroll of fame 
-PRON- get up quite briskly while -PRON- be talk be absolutely certain that -PRON- word be the very last on this meteoric theory of the aurora 
from that ipse dixit there be no escape 
right -PRON- be 
i cry enthusiastically 
suppose -PRON- stroll off along the wall and see what -PRON- can discover 
-PRON- lean on -PRON- for a space while -PRON- adjust -PRON- glass ought to feel grateful to -PRON- captain -PRON- maunder for give -PRON- the chance to settle a question which have bother scientific mind for year 
i be grateful believe -PRON- 
how be -PRON- fele 
i ask solicitously 
well 
i be not so much of a wreck as have imagine 
there be no fracture naturally -PRON- dignitjr have suffer somewhat but -PRON- voice trail off into silence for just at that moment an army of chur have begin fairly to boil out of the gate in the wall 
these be not the one who have hear the terrifying report of the shotgun and drop from the wall a short time before but other undaunte and eager to fall upon -PRON- 
with fierce yell and spear clash against shield -PRON- literally swarm in -PRON- direction 
quick pant prebble 
the gunthe gun 
i throw up the breech and the empty shell be automatically eject 
then i pluck from the belt one of the few cartridge that have remain in -PRON- after -PRON- tumble from the car 
i press the shell to the breech 
the next moment -PRON- be possible i swear for i be a sailor and the provocation be great 
what falter prebble whisperingly what now 
i look at -PRON- with dilate eye 
these shell i reply hoarsely be too large 
i canot get -PRON- into the gun 
griffyn must have have two shotgunswe get the belt that go with the other weapoh 
the professor toss -PRON- arm and fall to the ground 
i stoe over -PRON- the muzzle of the gun in -PRON- hand sweep a circle about -PRON- with the stock 
i forget how many of those rabid chur i mow down with the clubbed firearm can only remember that -PRON- be take tie together with thong and drive beyond the great wall spear point prick -PRON- at every step 
prebble and 
i have be on tenterhook ever since -PRON- arrival in this circumpolar region but -PRON- have not face a more desperate situation than the one that now confront -PRON- 
personally i would not have give a copper cent for -PRON- chance 
-PRON- learned companion as be so often the case with -PRON- be lose in contemplation of -PRON- strange surrounding to the exclusion of the animal instinct of fear 
-PRON- mind be grapple with scientific datum and be therefore too busy to consider -PRON- peril here i hear -PRON- mutter -PRON- see the human faculty emerge through -PRON- chrysalis of brutality primordial obscure but very pronounce nevertheless 
how these head and these face would delight a lombroso 
there be no other savage in the world like these 
if i could abduct one of the creature and take -PRON- back to -PRON- own country what a stir would be cause the scientific world 
unless i be greatly mistaken professor i observe dryly -PRON- will have a splendid chance to study these interesting savage at close quarter hope so i do indeed -PRON- answer absently and be off again with -PRON- mumbling 
how do -PRON- live 
what do -PRON- eat 
be -PRON- monogamous 
do -PRON- have village 
that prognathous visage predicate cruelty and determination 
ah very absorbing very donot see anything in the nature of till field professor say -PRON- lift -PRON- bowed head and become suddenly aware that be march at -PRON- side 
no captain -PRON- return in an attempt to be sociable these savage be not agricultural 
in one way or another most savage be find to take a certain toll from mother earth and i presume that these chur must raise something in the nature of food even though none of -PRON- field be in evidence 
the art of the husbandman be very primitive in origin 
adnuration fill -PRON- face as -PRON- bend -PRON- gaze on a tall savage march just ahead of -PRON- 
what perfect physical development -PRON- exclaim can see little in these hairy scoundrel say i testily but vast power for evil -PRON- be mere brutesat the bottoin of the scale while the nyllite be at the top 
the nyllite symbolize the mind even as these chur be symbolical of the matter remark prebble 
the brilliant mentality of the nyll kingdom reach here for -PRON- physicaljpower take -PRON- by sheer force of the will humble -PRON- and shape -PRON- to various use 
where could -PRON- happen upon a finer commientary on the power of mind over matter 
-PRON- be get in too deep for -PRON- professor say warrant -PRON- however that if these hur only realize -PRON- power -PRON- could overrun the kingdom of yil and lie -PRON- waste 
the professor shudder 
what a catastrophe that would be -PRON- murmur 
think of the gorgeous palace the beautiful garden the wondrous invention and discovery of nyl all lie under the strangle hand of these brute 
such a calamity be too monstrous captain 
-PRON- could never happen 
what cause the downfall of the roman enipire 
i ask 
luxury effiminacy too much wealth and power 
all the empire become drunk with prosperity 
and as a result the roman eagle have -PRON- neck wrung and be cast to the vulture 
be i right -PRON- very tersely captain 
nyll strike -PRON- as be much in the same way 
-PRON- throw -PRON- a startled look 
at time captain say -PRON- -PRON- uncover a rich vein of thought that strike into profound depth yes -PRON- be right 
nyll base -PRON- power upon faculty of the mind that have be most astonishingly deveope if anything be to becloud those power the whole kingdom would be pillage by these brute who be now confine wlthln the great wall 
the possibility be terrible to contemplate and -PRON- quite unnerve -PRON- 
but nyllite be not exact replica of the ancient roman 
although a land of idleness the other kingdom be not lap in sensuous ease 
-PRON- experience with the nyllite have not be pleasant yet -PRON- must grant -PRON- -PRON- due 
i know personally that labor of the mind be more exhausting than labor of the body 
the professor be intensely interested in -PRON- captor 
without the wall -PRON- have be willing to bide in hdpelessness while the chur sally forth and dispatch -PRON- but now -PRON- be in another mood 
-PRON- realize i suppose say i grimly that -PRON- be prisoner these rope that bind -PRON- arm at -PRON- back -PRON- reply serve to remind -PRON- of that fact captain 
do -PRON- also realize that -PRON- may be doom to death 
that be quite possible -PRON- return gravely but i hope -PRON- will spare -PRON- long enough so that i may make some inquiry regard -PRON- mode of life 
an examination into -PRON- tribal custom -PRON- language the limitation of -PRON- intellect and -PRON- way of war would be highly divert -PRON- be but a step above the beast of the forest and may prove to be the trye miss ing link that unite man to the low order of creation 
if -PRON- could take one of -PRON- back with -PRON- captain 
-PRON- have no visible mean for get -PRON- away to -PRON- own country i break in so let -PRON- say nothing of burden -PRON- return with savage like these 
-PRON- see that i be out of sympathy with -PRON- aspiration and i see plainly that -PRON- be in a trancelike condition where -PRON- scientific knowledge be wrestle with recondite enigma to the complete exclusion of -PRON- present unhappy state 
i watch the chur stride swiftly along and force -PRON- to hurry in -PRON- midst 
-PRON- face reflect a purpose which be ominous and arouse disagreeable thought of what be to happen to the professor and -PRON- 
there be nothing to be do however except to submit passively and face the end with fortitude 
something may happen to make the end more pleasant than the present situation promise 
i see no building nothing in the way of shelter even of the rude description 
there be no evidence of art and craft beyond the shield and the spear 
these be wellmade wepon of offense and defense but suggest nothing more than war and savagery 
i lis tene to the professor discourse to -PRON- the facial angle retreat from the prognathous jaw to the low forehead prove these chur to be bestial 
-PRON- be cruel merciless superstitiousprimitive child as yet untouche by the faint ray of real knowledge 
thus -PRON- mumble scarcely heed the spear that accelerate -PRON- lag pace 
i also take notice of many thing but only in a perfunctory and general way 
for instance in pass through the gate i judge the wall of masonry to betwenty foot in thickness i see that the land of the chur be ridge with rocky hill for the most part barren i feel the earth to be uncomfortably warm under -PRON- foot and when -PRON- wade a small stream the water be hot to -PRON- flesh 
in the distance that column of cloudlike vapor trail skyward bending and twisting at the crest and spread out so that the sun resemble a fiery ball a drift shroud 
on and on -PRON- walk until -PRON- turn into a defile among the gaunt rock 
spear strike shield in a ring clamor and presto the bowlder spew out a perfect mob of unkempt creature who run toward -PRON- some erect andsome on all four 
woman and child drone prebble very curious very 
evidently these creature be cave dweller possibly survivor of the stone age and as such -PRON- progenitor 
i should like -PRON- measurement on the bertillon system 
the woman and child survey -PRON- in awe 
the professor however claim most of -PRON- attention -PRON- eye be focus on -PRON- head and spectaclesthe spectacle and buskin be about all that remain to -PRON- of -PRON- former state -PRON- be goad into a vilesmelling hole in the rocky hillside and be make to sit down while -PRON- fect be pinion 
then perfectly helpless -PRON- be leave to -PRON- own device 
one of the tall that -PRON- stand head and shoulder above the restbarke out a series of order 
immediately the creature seattere woman and child with the rest and begin fetch armful of dry wood and throw -PRON- down in a heap 
while thiswas go forward other chur arrive 
two carry the shotgun across -PRON- spear in front of -PRON- not dare to touch -PRON- with -PRON- hand 
four with spear elevate have -PRON- bag of pemmican and ship biscuit on the spear point 
that also i suppose be a fetich and to be handle warily 
lastly come a train of grizzle warrior each with a lose cartridge on the flat of -PRON- spear head these be throw in a heap beside the gun and bag of food in for -PRON- i mutter gloomily -PRON- think so prebble monosyllabic -PRON- answer absently 
what 
i query 
-PRON- give a start 
-PRON- speech captain be of the onesyilablfc variety that be rudimentary 
now the ancient aryan belay 
i interrupt out of temper want none of -PRON- homily now 
-PRON- have plenty of food for thought of a different kind 
yes yes -PRON- answer eagerly should call -PRON- homonymous or rather i lurch against -PRON- and bring -PRON- out of -PRON- vagary 
eh -PRON- exclaim 
do -PRON- say something captain look out there 
i answer brutally 
lord nyli say these creature be cannibal and -PRON- appear to be collect wood a chain of reason to claim -PRON- immediate attention 
-PRON- think the professor grow pallid donot think i answer know 
-PRON- press -PRON- clawlike hand together bind as -PRON- be 
a at last the professor be completely en rapport with -PRON- desperate situation 
the world will lose -PRON- demonstration of the meteoric theory -PRON- cry bitterly and -PRON- sali be the cause 
outside the wall -PRON- offer hope 
hope 
and look at -PRON- now 
upon -PRON- head sir will fall the consequence guess be both in for the consequence i return 
by the mizzentruck of the great harry 
i add look toward the wood gatherer a nyllite prisoner ask prebble 
no -PRON- act as though -PRON- have some authority among -PRON- 
strange mutter -PRON- companion -PRON- eye on the man 
-PRON- wear the skin of a wild beast like the chur and there be not the same intelligenceshown in -PRON- face as in the face of other of -PRON- race 
here come the tallman -PRON- s a chief i suppose 
the leader of the pack make toward the cave follow by four other ready for -PRON- i take -PRON- say try to speak calmly beg -PRON- pardon captain say prebble 
for what 
for accuse -PRON- of lead -PRON- into this predicament 
-PRON- have just flash over -PRON- that -PRON- could not have go south i -PRON- have want too think -PRON- would come to -PRON- i answer 
-PRON- will meet -PRON- fate shoulder to shoulder -PRON- go on not death that terrify -PRON- what follow in this case 
i lay -PRON- bound hand against -PRON- which be as near a handshake as -PRON- could come 
-PRON- differ often prebble and for -PRON- be two of diverse nature vet never doubt -PRON- innate manhood nor do i think -PRON- ever doubt mme 
there be something incongruous in remark just make when compare with other remark remember by -PRON- of which -PRON- have relieve -PRON- while -PRON- be on the ice cap but i have yetto find a man who be at all fime perfectly consistent 
surely no scientific man can lay claim to such an honor 
through the opening of -PRON- cave -PRON- watch the tall man and the four other 
suddenly the tall man come to a halt group the four around begin a harangue 
the guttural voice be pitch so low that -PRON- could not distinguish anything except husky syllable and staccato pause between -PRON- 
-PRON- be devise way and mean i suppose say the professor 
omne supposition be as good as another i answer 
-PRON- all come to one thing in the end be a bad dream an exceedingly disagreeable dream 
-PRON- still cling to that fiotion do -PRON- 
why not if -PRON- please -PRON- 
all life -PRON- dear captain be a dream 
at least so -PRON- fancy run 
an immortal fall asleep in elysium and what -PRON- dream be a human life 
sometimes -PRON- dream be short and sometimes long sometimes -PRON- be sad and bitter and sometimes full of happiness and hope realize 
but the immortal wake whether -PRON- dream be bright or dull and again -PRON- discover -PRON- in elysium and -PRON- realize that -PRON- have be in elysium all the time 
with -PRON- eye on the gabbling chur i give rather deep attention to this odd conceit of i have never suspect that -PRON- have a vein of poetry in -PRON- makeup 
very pretty say and what be dbetter and more to the point there may be a little truth in -PRON- 
but elysium must be full of sleeper 
-PRON- mutter a few word under -PRON- breath and i fear -PRON- be tinker up another equation 
but no 
presently -PRON- lift -PRON- head remove -PRON- spectacle and begin clean -PRON- on a rag of -PRON- tunic 
at that moment the chief come on with -PRON- four chur and the professor come to a pause 
the chur chieftain unbound -PRON- ankle and motion to -PRON- to rise 
-PRON- obey and walk out among the ragged rabble that surround the pyre there -PRON- be cut asunder and the professor be lead aside and make to seat -PRON- on a bearskin 
after this the nyllite step in front of -PRON- 
-PRON- be from nyll -PRON- ask 
recentiy i answer 
where from originally 
there be no blackhaired man in nyll and no hairless man like the one yonder 
-PRON- turn and indicate prebble 
-PRON- come from beyond the ice wall 
who be -PRON- if i may inquire 
sertez i be call 
banish from nyll by king boazar on the morning of the long day 
banish -PRON- add acrimoniously because i dare to make love to the princess ylma 
-PRON- strike a note that make -PRON- hearstring vibgate 
i eye -PRON- keenly 
princess ylma would notreceive -PRON- advance i query 
no -PRON- answer be nothing 
-PRON- do not know -PRON- own mind 
apart from that however -PRON- be promise to a man -PRON- hate 
who 
to count zylox captain of the king guard at last i know why -PRON- lordship feel pity for princess ylma 
why will the king force -PRON- to marriage agajnsther will 
i proceed feign carelessness 
because zylox be head of the house of almik rival of the boazar 
on -PRON- death the king fear ylma will be set aside in favor of zylox and -PRON- wish to unite the two house 
sertez turn and shake -PRON- clench fist southward bide -PRON- time -PRON- hiss 
some day i shall lead a horde of chur into nyll and steal theprincess 
the next moment -PRON- shrug -PRON- shoulder and toss -PRON- hand deprecatingly 
but enough of this suppose -PRON- know the fate for which -PRON- be intend can imagine what -PRON- be to be 
have -PRON- any power among these people 
can -PRON- not persuade -PRON- to give over -PRON- horrible design 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- companion will be spare say -PRON- 
-PRON- be taboo among the chur because of -PRON- hairless head 
-PRON- can none of -PRON- understand the what -PRON- can not understand -PRON- believe to be supernatural 
i laugh bitterly at the inconsistency of the chur 
the professor would live 
-PRON- may never be able to return to -PRON- own country but -PRON- bald pate save -PRON- from thie disaster that threaten -PRON- 
i be near the shotgun the small heap of cartridge and the food bag 
-PRON- despondent eye fall upon -PRON- and i notice something small in -PRON- but of great importance just then 
the cartridge differ in size 
have there be two size of loaded shell in the belt 
and have in -PRON- haste at the great wall pluck out one of the large shell will ask -PRON- say i to the nyllite to take this cord from -PRON- wrist 
-PRON- can not escape say -PRON- 
therefore the less reason for -PRON- to hesitate in grant -PRON- request 
-PRON- remove the bond 
instantly i pick up the shotgun throw up the breech and try one of the small shell 
i tremble even now to think of that agonizing moment 
would -PRON- fit or have i try the small kind just without the wall 
the shell slide into the barrel and i snap the breech back into place 
glory shout prebble leap to -PRON- foot and wave frantically the bearskin on which -PRON- have be sit 
-PRON- perform a dance bizarre enough consider -PRON- regalia 
the chur think i be about to make some attempt at escape begin close in on -PRON- with savage cry and ferocious gesture 
i fire the single barrel into the air and stand quietly under the smoke wreath note the effect 
the result be all that i have dare to hope 
down go the chur even sertez sink to one knee 
silence follow disturb only by the gabbling old professor who not know -PRON- bald head have save -PRON- believe the gun have prove the salvation of both of -PRON- 
presently the chief get up on -PRON- hand and knee crawl to -PRON- foot and lift a handful of sand and throw -PRON- over -PRON- head 
then -PRON- rise and yelp at the rest of -PRON- hairy follower 
immediately a long line of the creature begin creep past -PRON- every one of -PRON- perform the same operation 
what be the meaning of this sertez -PRON- in quire 
as long as -PRON- remain on earth thunder maker return fulsomely -PRON- and -PRON- companionare the honor guest of the pack 
koz the chieftain tender -PRON- abject apology for the manner in which -PRON- have be treat 
those on the wall prior to the breaking of the gate aver stoutly that -PRON- be the thunder maker but koz would not believe 
now that -PRON- hae hear with -PRON- own ear and seenwith -PRON- own eye -PRON- declare that heand -PRON- pack will be -PRON- slave umtil -PRON- depart from the land 
tis well i answer with dighity 
tell koz that -PRON- be put out somiewhat at themanner of -PRON- reception but that -PRON- harbor noill will 
-PRON- shall be inform also wish -PRON- to tell -PRON- i continue i and -PRON- companion be merely human like the nyliite 
but -PRON- have power to requite evil for evil andgood for good 
there be no such word as good in the chur language 
then repeat the substance of -PRON- remark in way 
chief koz leader of the pack seem overjoyed when -PRON- word be translate by sertez for -PRON- benefit 
from condemn stranger -PRON- rise at one leap to the rank of honored guest 
the good cave in the hill be place at -PRON- two of the chief son be tell off to serve -PRON- 
one of -PRON- first act be to send for the bag of pemgnican and biscuit and to fortify -PRON- with ahearty meal against other emergency which -PRON- know would be sure to arise 
soon after -PRON- have finish -PRON- meal sertez look in on -PRON- for a little chat 
prebble and i have just be discuss sertez 
-PRON- be by -PRON- own admission a banished man but i regard -PRON- in the light of a renegade 
-PRON- have say princess ylma do not like himfor which i commend -PRON- warmlyand that in the face of this -PRON- be -PRON- desire to abduct -PRON- 
no gentleman would express -PRON- in such a manner 
prebble be of one mind with -PRON- but advise that -PRON- tolerate the fellow because of -PRON- value to -PRON- in -PRON- dealing with the chur 
so when sertez creep through the low entrance into -PRON- cave and then get up and advanced into the glare of the torch that light the interior -PRON- welcome -PRON- civilly 
-PRON- remark upon the head room to be have in -PRON- quarter say -PRON- be the only cave in the district where a man could stand upright without fear of knock out -PRON- brain 
-PRON- loll on a bearskin and -PRON- present -PRON- with a bit of pemmican and a ship biscuit both of which -PRON- appear to relish should think say that if the chur can climb to the top of the great wall on one side -PRON- could drop over on the other 
so -PRON- could -PRON- answer but there be no need of any climbing 
-PRON- gentleman have demolish the gate and -PRON- be now possible to walk through with perfect ease 
then why donot -PRON- do -PRON- strike in prebble 
from the little i have see of both country nyll be far preferable to this 
the chur be cow by the superiority of the nyllite say sertez 
with one look a nyllite can make a chur drop -PRON- spear and run howl back to -PRON- wilderness can -PRON- ever hope to make a raid into the other country i ask have be wait for king doazar and the almiks to come to dagger draw 
but now i have another plan 
i propose to cooperate with -PRON- 
in what way 
-PRON- seem to be possess of wonderful pow ers sertez proceed audaciously and if -PRON- could by some mean the nyllite the chur would immediately overrun -PRON- country and i could get the princess 
the shotgun be within reach i put out -PRON- hand toward -PRON- 
prebble halt -PRON- with a look 
that be out of -PRON- power say -PRON- 
disappointment overspread thie villainousface of sertez 
there be no way -PRON- can help -PRON- -PRON- query 
no i reply shortly 
what be the extent of the chur possessiotis ask the professor at -PRON- old tradeof delve for fact 
twenty mile fromwall to wall 
and what cause that pillar of smoke which -PRON- see to the north 
sertez look surprised suppose everybody know that say -PRON- 
the earth grind around -PRON- great spindle cause much heat so that smoke and minute particle of dust arise and mingle with the clowds 
tlie professor grab at -PRON- head 
adter a moment -PRON- continue what be the diameter of the north pole a geographical mile 
round on top 
no flatflat as a floor 
the great ziff live there 
who under the canopy be the great ziff 
i demand 
again the surprised lock filter across face 
-PRON- ignorance astonish -PRON- -PRON- exclaim 
the great ziff gentleman be head chief of all the pack 
when the time come to raid the land of the nyllite -PRON- will head the pack in person 
-PRON- be a warrior of prowess 
-PRON- be invincible in combat a veritable lion 
but the eye of the nyllite be too much for -PRON- as for the rest of -PRON- follower 
there be some peculiar thing ahout the great ziff for instance -PRON- be not subject to the gentleman 
fe have live many thousand influenice of time of vear and will no doubt last as long as the earth endure 
i see a grin form about the professor thin lip 
how do -PRON- account for thiserremarka ble longevity very easily 
what make timer 
day of course the succession of light and darkness 
what make day 
the rotation of the earth on -PRON- axis 
the great ziff live on the end of the axis and doesnot rotate 
therefore -PRON- be not subject to the influence of time 
the professor reach for the gun this time but i grab jt from -PRON- 
sophistry -PRON- cry rotation of the earth as -PRON- sdy make what -PRON- call a day but neither day nor month nor year make time 
-PRON- be but way station on the eternal path 
when -PRON- have be long in the country -PRON- will know more about -PRON- be unruffle rejoinder 
prebble grow red in the face and only succeed in calm -PRON- after a great effort 
how far be the north pole from here 
i ask 
an hour journey be anxious to pay -PRON- respect to the great zi impossible 
why impossible 
at a distance of fifty foot from the pole the terrific heat would scorch -PRON- to a cinder 
how do the great ziff get on and off the pole rarely get off 
as for get on -PRON- be there when the earth begin to rotate 
nonsense whoop the professor 
the longer -PRON- stay the more -PRON- will kuow say sertez laconically 
if the great ziff lead -PRON- subject on -PRON- raid into the land of nyll i put in have to get off the pole wonot -PRON- 
-PRON- will answer sertez 
when ready hell come fire have no effect on -PRON- and that be another of -PRON- peculiarity 
-PRON- be say -PRON- be very fond of blue fire 
-PRON- be serve by little boy in red cap what folly be the man talk exclaim the disgusted professor 
and by monster all head and no tail continue sertez and by hideous slimy thing that creep on the earth and slide through the air and order prebble 
-PRON- have enough of that after fact not fancy 
the longer -PRON- be with -PRON- the more yes yes -PRON- say that before 
the chur believe these thing about the great ziff 
about what i would expect of -PRON- primitive mind sniff the professor run to physical rather than to mental power say sertez rise 
if i can be of assistance to -PRON- at any time gentleman -PRON- add not fail to call on -PRON- 
thereupon -PRON- crawl out on all four as -PRON- have crawl in 
there go the big begin the pro fessor but pause abruptly 
no -PRON- go on wonot say -PRON- 
what -PRON- tell be hardly more in credible than the thing -PRON- have see with -PRON- own ecye since reach these circumpolar re gion if -PRON- be to put -PRON- experience down in black and white for the benefit of -PRON- fellow countryman captain -PRON- would call -PRON- monumental reirain again 
the term grate on a sensitive ear 
truth be strange than fiction ever dare to be say i sagely 
a few minute later accompany by -PRON- servitor bigoll and xit -PRON- emerge from -PRON- cavern and start for the pole 
-PRON- den open on a rocky defile with steep side which -PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to traverse 
at the end of the defile -PRON- come upon a group of warrior who grin behind -PRON- couch spear dispute -PRON- advance 
i motion -PRON- aside but -PRON- would not stir around for sertez thinking to make -PRON- wish know through -PRON- 
-PRON- be not in sight however 
as a last resort i fire the gun 
the chur quake in -PRON- track but do not fall as have heretofore be -PRON- invariable custom tr the other end of the defile say the professor 
-PRON- do and be meet by more of the chur who blockade -PRON- as effectuauy as the other have do -PRON- be honor guest with a vengeance i fume do this mean anyway 
-PRON- mean reply the professor that -PRON- prize -PRON- company so highly -PRON- canot let -PRON- go 
-PRON- must return to the cave 
this -PRON- do and for one hundred and sixtyeight hourswhich would have be seven day in a country where night and day recur in accept orderwe sleep eat converse and make essay to begin -PRON- journey poleward 
but -PRON- be unable to leave the defile the outlook be discourage 
sertez keep -PRON- in the background the whole time and whenever -PRON- question bigoll and xit by sign to tell -PRON- about -PRON- -PRON- shake -PRON- head and grin blankly 
finally in the hundred and sixtyeighth hour sertez materialize 
-PRON- bring with -PRON- a silver box 
-PRON- tell -PRON- to call on -PRON- say with some heat whenever -PRON- desire -PRON- service be here gentleman -PRON- answer blandly where have -PRON- peen 
abroad in the land of the 
chur organize and prepare for the coming of the great ziff 
i notice that -PRON- be highly pleased over something and repress -PRON- jubilant teeling with dituculey on foot 
i ask messenger one of the chur have come from the land of boazar 
-PRON- say the blight have fall and that the mental power of the nyllite be dethrone 
-PRON- have become gibber idiot dodder fool 
and now now the accept time approach 
-PRON- do not believe in the great ziff 
but -PRON- shall see -PRON- come in a cloud of blue fire with the little boy in red cap and monster all head and no tail and hideous thing that creep on earth and slide through air 
-PRON- shall witness the gathering of the pack under the great ziff and then if -PRON- follow -PRON- shall observe the overthrow of the nyllite and behold sertez and princess ylma united and hold sway under protection of the high chief of the chur 
-PRON- draw a picture which horrify -PRON- 
for the moment prebble be dumb 
sertez laugh diabolically and hand -PRON- the silver box and a little golden kel for -PRON- say -PRON- the messenger bring -PRON- 
-PRON- say -PRON- be for the stranger with the black hair and eye be all agog with curiosity 
and so be prebble for that matter 
both -PRON- and sertez watch eagerly while unlocked the casket and throw back the lid gorr plate with the royal arm exclaim the astonished sertez 
carnelian -PRON- add 
the plate be from a woman 
in the box be a square thin block of a fleshre color

how do -PRON- contrive to learn the secret of the plate 
i ask will show -PRON- 
-PRON- reach for the carnelian block but i thrust -PRON- behind -PRON- 
this be mine i believe -PRON- say i remark very well -PRON- simper but i detect a flash of -PRON- eye which make -PRON- distrustful 
try for -PRON- and -PRON- learn nothing 
-PRON- be not educate up to -PRON- 
take the plate between -PRON- palm so 
-PRON- hold -PRON- palm close togethet illustrate how i be to hold the thirfg 
i do as direct 
a delightful sensation the very poetry of exquisite feeling speed along -PRON- nerve and center in -PRON- brain apart from this however no tangible think impress -PRON- on -PRON- mind 
what mystery be lock in the plate burn to know yet dread use the only channel lie open to -PRON- 
sertez be a vilai 
still -PRON- be a nyllite and have be bring up on gorr plate so to speak 
-PRON- imnatience tn receive the message overcaame -PRON- repugnance of the mean 
i hand the royal block to the renegade 
tell -PRON- what -PRON- say i request 
a gleam of satisfaction dart through -PRON- blue eye 
i kmew i be play into -PRON- hand but i also know there be nothing else for -PRON- 
-PRON- sink on a bearskin the plate between -PRON- palm 
bend -PRON- head -PRON- begin in a low voice the thought of ylma princess of nyll daughter of boazar concern momentous event takmg place in the kingdom and coacernmg the blackhaired blackeye stranger from beyond the ice wall who be often in -PRON- mind and atway abide in -PRON- heart 
i be for snatch the plate from this renegade -PRON- rival but what -PRON- have say only make -PRON- wildly eager for more 
i could learn more through -PRON- alone so i suffer -PRON- to proceed wondrous and unheardof thing be in the land of nyllite and i be fill with fearful foreboding 
the other stranger comljure from the sky by the hairless prophet be condemn to death by oyd but save -PRON- by offer to deliver to the king and -PRON- people thousand of keese of the elixir introduce by the little prophet with the glass eye 
whereto the foreigner last to arrive have rearet a strange structure fill with wonderful vat and call by -PRON- a distillery 
into this structure maize be carry and from -PRON- keese upon keese of the elixir be take to the end that the whole kingdom may renew -PRON- youth 
but if youth must be renew at such a price -PRON- be -PRON- prayer that the all wise will suffer -PRON- to age quickly and die that i may nolonger witness the orgy of these -PRON- people 
the king -PRON- father lie constantly in a state of torpor the gentleman in wait sing song and hold wassail from hour to hour the minister have lackluster eye and mumble to -PRON- and the business of state be at a standstill 
the people be even as the chur dull besotte reel along the road shout rave fill the air with hideous sound 
-PRON- have become heast and worsethan beast 
princess ylma cry aloud in -PRON- despair to the hblackeye stranger from the land beyond the ice wall 
will -PRON- come to the rescue of the hyperborean save this distressed people and gain the cternal gratitude of -PRON- unhappy ylma 
something tell -PRON- -PRON- will not ignore this prayer and that i be as much in -PRON- heart as -PRON- be in mine 
the voice of sertez cease 
while speak -PRON- tone have become soft and gentle as though -PRON- appropriate for -PRON- the thought of the carnelian block 
then abruptly -PRON- leap erect with flame fling the gorr plate at -PRON- foot 
in a voice husky with anger -PRON- cry -PRON- blackhaire interloper from the antipode dare to raise -PRON- eye to the princess ylma 
-PRON- have the unblushing audacity to rival one of -PRON- own race 
liscreant 
renegade cry i hotly 
captain captain implore prebble observe -PRON- clench fist be calm calm i cry calm when this banish scoundrel speak to -PRON- in the manner -PRON- do 
by the mizzentruck of the great harry -PRON- s the bad enemy king boazar have do -PRON- frst stroke of work for princess ylma attend to this beggar so -PRON- pretty plan for raid the country will fall through 
prebble step in front of -PRON- 
enough of this captain say -PRON- 
remove -PRON- talk ring so that -PRON- may converse without let sertez understand -PRON- word 
i remove the ring and string -PRON- on -PRON- arm meanwhile keep wary and wrathful eye on the renegade 
i will say for -PRON- that -PRON- hold -PRON- ground with great firmness give every indication of be a knave of unusual quality to find together 
now go on prebble -PRON- own ring in -PRON- hand let -PRON- tell -PRON- captain that -PRON- be unwise to arouse sertez against -PRON- 
-PRON- safety among the chur be problematical 
-PRON- be alive by grace of -PRON- being esteem the thunder maker but the remegade have power with the chur and may at any moment withdraw -PRON- from -PRON- favor 
-PRON- can not afford to take chance 
the scoundrel have design upon the princess ylma 
i flare 
prebble look at -PRON- keenly 
have -PRON- any design on the princess captain -PRON- ask bluntly 
l be a man of honor say draw up to -PRON- full height and that question be lead and highly personal 
be sensible captain beg prebble be i not 
i growl glowering into the saturnine face of sertez 
-PRON- be not if -PRON- contemplate an alliance by marriage with the princess 
-PRON- be not of vour people and -PRON- be of the royal family 
such a union would be a misalliance and result in disaster 
believe -PRON- sali 
-PRON- be a beautiful girl and as goed as -PRON- be beautiful i answer 
and -PRON- have see -PRON- twice and talk with -PRON- not at all 
much -PRON- know about -PRON- captain be an explorer prebble but that do not deny some small amount of sentiment in -PRON- soul 
strangle this bit of sentiment 
-PRON- have warp -PRON- judgment 
continue to harbor -PRON- and -PRON- will suffer 
suffer i echo angrily 
yes suffer 
suppose -PRON- could get away from this part of the earth and return to other part -PRON- know well 
would -PRON- take princess ylma with -PRON- 
as mrs salis yesif -PRON- would go 
what would happen to the throne in that event 
when the time come for boazar to die with princess ylma go the kingdom wauld fall into the hand of sertez 
could there be a great disaster and if yima be -PRON- would fall into the hand of sertez 
that prebble be an infinitely great disaster 
-PRON- smile 
-PRON- look at the princess through the small end of the telescope captain say -PRON- and at the kingdom through the big end 
as a conseguence the importance of the princess be magnify out of all proportion 
there be no use argue with -PRON- prebble i storm know -PRON- heart man and i will go -PRON- own way 
as for this scoundrel sertez will save nyll from -PRON- lawless intention 
when i be do with -PRON- there will be no chance of the kingdom or of the princess ever talle into -PRON- unworthy hand 
i consider -PRON- duty to put sertez out of the way and all this mutter prebble because of the think wave imbed in one gorr plate 
be -PRON- all mad 
call -PRON- what -PRON- will -PRON- mind be make up 
yima have call upon -PRON- to save -PRON- father kingdom 
pollock have release an evil which have -PRON- inception with -PRON- -PRON- be at fault and the least -PRON- can do be to pay heed to the cry send -PRON- by the princess in that carnelian block 
listen counsel the professor 
there be a possibility that sertez do not translate the think wave of the princess correctly 
no possibility of that at all 
-PRON- want to learn what thought the princess be send to -PRON- 
-PRON- may have repeat to -PRON- a message which be not in the plate 
prebble the message prove -PRON- to be correct no sidestep all that about pollock the dlstlllel son flooding nyll with that tt have happen and all th confound elixir rest have happen just as sertez tell -PRON- 
the sentiment of the princess be correctly translate and lie -PRON- life on -PRON- 
that gorr plate be a call to actiona commandand -PRON- can not ignore -PRON- be as eager for action as -PRON- be captain say prebble but what can -PRON- do if -PRON- tie -PRON- hand by antagonize sertez 
-PRON- be already antagonize 
in -PRON- -PRON- recognize a rival and that be more than enough to set -PRON- against the two of -PRON- 
stand aside 
i tell -PRON- professor i be determined to see this through to the bitter end 
-PRON- must strike a blow for nyll 
-PRON- be subordinate the welfare of nyll to that of the princess 
if -PRON- slay sertez captain every chur will be at -PRON- throat 
reecf please on that phase of the matter have reflect and i tell -PRON- there be no time to lose 
over the professor shoulder be the evil leer face of the renegade taunt -PRON- and give -PRON- a dare to do -PRON- bad 
in order to stop the professor argument clap on the talk ring then i start by a detour for sertez 
prebble seek to hold -PRON- but i shake -PRON- off 
the next moment i hurl -PRON- at the renegade 
-PRON- be slender and quick of movement and manage to avoid -PRON- 
duck under -PRON- fist -PRON- race for the entrance to the cave pick up the gun and cartridge belt as -PRON- flee 
there -PRON- go scream prebble steal -PRON- thunder let -PRON- steal -PRON- thunder captain 
i try -PRON- good to overhaul the rascal but -PRON- claw through the opening a dozen foot in the lead 
down i go on -PRON- marrow bone to follow andthen just as i be close to the exit there come a crash and the light of day be shut 
rom -PRON- eye 
ahuge bowlder which have be keep in readiness as afterward learn be knock free and fall across the entrance 
prebble and be imprison in the cave 
imprison and render helpless when -PRON- be need elsewhere 
for -PRON- sole wish now be to get back to the prince and save -PRON- and -PRON- people from the doom that threaten -PRON- 
i could have imitate the army in flander -PRON- be possible i do although the memory escape -PRON- 
what be that harp the queruious voice of the professor bowlder block the entrance answer 
push -PRON- aside 
i have try without avail locomotive couldnot move -PRON- pant -PRON- squeeze around the edg 
the opening be hermetically seal 
that scoundrel design this for a live grave i creep back to the torch beside which -PRON- companion crouch wring -PRON- hand 
think of i say in a hollow voice 
what noble mind be there oerthrown 
captain reply prebble in an awesome whisper -PRON- be the demon refer to in the legend 
aye return -PRON- save -PRON- miserable life with a flask of bourbon and pollock the distiller son have complete the work 
-PRON- have build a gin mill and the kingdom of boazar be steep in debauchery 
the serpent have crawl into paradise 
and the princess ylma 
merciful heaven what will become of -PRON- i stagger erect and beat -PRON- brow with -PRON- clench fist 
the opportunity of the chur have arrive say prebble still in -PRON- awed whisper 
lead by the great ziff the ally pack will sweep through the broken gate and lie domain in waste 
awful captain 
-PRON- soul shrink at the thought 
and that arch fiend sertez will bear away the princess yima 
i rave must get out of here 
-PRON- must i tell -PRON- 
i crawl to the rock again and push until i see star 
not an inch could i move -PRON- 
come back captain call prebble calmly waste -PRON- strength 
come back and let -PRON- think 
can -PRON- think -PRON- out of this hole in the hillside 
i retort be what -PRON- want think must precede action 
come here and be quiet 
there be a command in -PRON- voice and i crawl back to the torch once more and crouch opposite -PRON- watch -PRON- fac in the sickly glare 
-PRON- be a thin strong face the face of a thinker 
-PRON- eye gleam and glow as -PRON- cogitate 
i be in the mood for quick and decisive action and the necessity of inaction gall and fret -PRON- 
first say the professor -PRON- must calm -PRON- 
a passive brain evolve the most fruitful suggestion 
this be not the first time -PRON- have ask -PRON- to be calm i return 
if -PRON- feeling be yours prebble -PRON- would understand the uselessness of the request be as much concerned as -PRON- be captain over the trouble that menace nyll 
sertez the renegade seem destine to have -PRON- day 
if boazar die and the kingdom fall into the hand of sertez 
-PRON- have already speak of that prebble i mterrupte if boazar die and if princess yima do not reign as queen regal authority fail into the hand of count zylox 
-PRON- be tell vou remember that zvlox be the head of another branch of the roval family 
-PRON- be the pretender 
-PRON- have not grasp ny mean captain sertez for -PRON- reward in helpmd the great ziff aoamst -PRON- own people will be give the hand of yhna in marriage 
thus -PRON- will be the queen consort and undoubtedly elevate to a high place in the wreck adfter the great ziff get through with nyll i answer in a hollow tone there will be noth leit to rule 
thc chur will occupy the fertile plain of nyll and will overrun and desecrate the palace and the templea ev enthmcf worth while will be trmlp lead underfoot and destrove and the conquer brute will brutalize everything good and noble with which -PRON- come in contact 
in time however the nyllite will shake o7 tie vstupor recover thetr brilliant mental power and reconquer -PRON- kingdom 
-PRON- may require year perhaps decade but that result il be evolve ultimately out of the wreck 
nyl will have learn a lesson and can rebuild ijts glory on a firm foundation not forget professor i remind -PRON- that -PRON- present business be to escape from this cavern 
-PRON- be need and -PRON- must not del lay or waste -PRON- time in idle talk 
the talk be not idle captain reply prebble 
-PRON- wit be at work upon this problem and discourse merely sharpen -PRON- 
i have no hkmg for this sertez from the first be -PRON- response but -PRON- find -PRON- of one mind on that point very soon after -PRON- fall into the hand of the chur in what way do -PRON- think -PRON- can effect -PRON- escape from this hole in the hillside an idea have not yet offer -PRON- captain but i have an instinctive feeling that i be close to of the problem 
let the talk go on flow i shall suddenly see the light 
here be another inconsistency of at time while -PRON- be busy with hi prollem -PRON- want to be alone and would bear with nothing that may distract -PRON- here at this time -PRON- be eager for conversation and declare -PRON- an aid to quick and effective thinking 
as -PRON- mind be entirely wrap up in the princess and the sorry plight of -PRON- father and -PRON- kingdom i be at a loss to put forward any subject for discourse 
the professor step into the breach 
what do -PRON- think of the great ziff -PRON- inquire 
why that -PRON- be a great fake be a myth professor and the myth have be develop as a sort of check on the wild chur 
the professor shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- be no myth -PRON- declare 
-PRON- be a symbol indeed but a live symbol 
there be a vast amount of folk lore and tradition surround the great ziff but the person -PRON- be a reality 
-PRON- be the real king of the chur and -PRON- keep -PRON- hidden because -PRON- know that will bind -PRON- authority more closely around -PRON- savage subject 
why all that tommyrot about the little boy in red ap and monster all head and no tail and soon 
when 
sertez vwa talk to -PRON- alout those thing -PRON- -PRON- halt -PRON- and ask for fact not fancy 
the fancy as i now believe captain symbotize fact beyond -PRON- depth i observe helplesly 
i see in the story about the great ziff nothing but fatry taleschronicle of the cid and aljce in wonderland 
surely -PRON- donot agree with the chur that time have no effect upon the ziff and that -PRON- have live alwaysand wili always live belteve the fact which that statement symbolize assert prebble 
since man inhabit the earth the idea for which the ziff stand have be in the background immutable eternal 
but what be that idea 
prebble stare at -PRON- 
there be sentiment in -PRON- soul captain and surely -PRON- wit should be able to match -PRON- against the nimble fancy of a lot old hairy demon like these chur a puzzle which i have no time to work on at present must do something prebble and at once -PRON- think of any way out of here be close to something captain 
-PRON- eye for several moment have be fix on the torch flame 
that say -PRON- point to the flare offer the suggestion that may lead -PRON- to freedom 
how open -PRON- say be hermetically seal yes 
nou be sure 
dositive what cause that flame to bend toward the rear of the cavern 
there be a draft and there could be no draft without an opening right 
i cry overjoyed 
there be an exit somewhere 
-PRON- pull the torch from -PRON- socket 
hold -PRON- in -PRON- hand -PRON- walk slowly toward the back part of the cavern watch the flame as -PRON- bend forward direct -PRON- with flicker finger 
the roof dip toward the floor 
prebble go down on hand and knee still holdine the torch and followi e as -PRON- commandel -PRON- trail away and i see -PRON- weave to and fro in the distance the fluttering torch like astar 
-PRON- be a star -PRON- star of hope if ever -PRON- have one 
suddenly the little reddish dot come to a standstill and voice float back to -PRON- eureka -PRON- call 
bring what s leave of the biscuit and pemmican captain 
i snatch up the bagit be now light and of small dimensionsand follow -PRON- companion 
-PRON- wait for -PRON- have a tight squeeze of -PRON- say -PRON- 
when the great primordial cataclysm fashion this hill -PRON- have the forethought to leave a narrow passage through from the cavern to the top 
i can see daylight ahead 
crawl for -PRON- i return be close after -PRON- 
in some way i push and drag -PRON- through and at last -PRON- emerge on the hillside overlook the defile that lie at -PRON- cavern mouth 
from -PRON- position -PRON- could look down and see the great bowlder that have be balance over the entrance 
the gully be full of chur and the center of interest seem to be sertez 
the renegade have the gun and be handle -PRON- with dangerous carelessness 
if -PRON- s not careful say kill somebody 
the word be barely out of -PRON- mouth when the piece explode and one of the chur fall in -PRON- track 
consternation seize upon every one sertez along with the rest 
the destructive power of the gun have not before be bring home to these creature for the mere report of -PRON- have be sufficient to compass -PRON- end 
now however the bunghng of sertez have work a catastrophe which cause the thunder maker to be doubly fear 
the chur prostrate -PRON- and sertez drop the firearma though -PRON- have be a serpent fling the belt down upon -PRON- and then retreat to a respeetful distance 
this be -PRON- opportunity professor say and -PRON- hurry down the slope and make -PRON- way to where the gun and belt be lie 
-PRON- would be difficult to decide whether -PRON- appearance in the defile have apparently issue through the solid bowlder block -PRON- cave or the fatal use of the shotgun frighten these iavaze creature the more on several occasion i have see -PRON- primitive mind overcome but never to the extent that -PRON- be now be -PRON- able to get out of the cave falter sertez 
-PRON- be not mecessary for -PRON- to know say i sternly pick up the belt and buckle -PRON- around -PRON- and then possess -PRON- of the gun 
inform koz that -PRON- desire to go to the pole and interview the great ziff 
but -PRON- can not do as i tell -PRON- 
i break in sternly and emphasize the command by point the gun in -PRON- direction 
-PRON- give a shout of horror and run to the chief 
koz listen attentively while sertez tell -PRON- wish and then approach -PRON- with -PRON- two servitor bigollrand xit 
sertez do not venture in -PRON- proximity 
krom a distance -PRON- call koz and -PRON- son will accompany -PRON- 
see to -PRON- sertez shout -PRON- head no foray into the kingdom of nyll otherwise the thunder maker shall speak in term -PRON- eannot fail to understand 
-PRON- show -PRON- tooth in a snarling smile and from that i know that -PRON- be not yet do with -PRON- 
koz -PRON- take the food bag and carry -PRON- aerdss -PRON- shoulder but neither -PRON- nor bigoll nor xit could be induce to bear the thunder maker 
with the three chur in the lead -PRON- course lead -PRON- down the defile and out throtigh a country where titan have at one time be at play hurl mountain at each other pile -PRON- up fantastically 
steadily but surely -PRON- advance upon the pillar of smoke and dust 
as -PRON- go on the ground grow hotter beneath -PRON- 
often -PRON- strike a spot where -PRON- foot be compel to fly upward in a wild dance or bear the weight of -PRON- body on -PRON- toe 
everywhere be desolation 
contiguous to the great wall be area where plant and tree grow and stream of warm water have -PRON- course 
but here the heat be fatal to plant life and what moisture the ground contain be give off insteam 
still onward -PRON- keep -PRON- course although -PRON- seem every moment as though -PRON- must turn back 
a weird exaltation thrill -PRON- 
for the present i forget that i be seek the great zift to threaten -PRON- in case -PRON- seize upon the misfortune of nyll to make an invasion of the country 
again the polar explorer search for that baffling and elusive thing call the north pole 
vith -PRON- eye turn straight ahead of -PRON- i press on and on 
at last -PRON- reach a point beyond which -PRON- would have be suicide to venture 
and there before -PRON- arise the coal of -PRON- ambition 
adequatcly to describe the soulinspiring spectacle be beyond -PRON- 
no pen could do justice to the scene least of all mine which heretofore have be comnfine to the simple annal of the log book 
i have see a volcano in eruption and the vomiting forth of fire and smoke and dust bear some resemblance to this polar phenomenon 
here the zone of activity be half a mile in diameter completely circular 
within the vortex as the veil shift the great spindle be disclose a mighty bulwark of celestial law and orderwithout which there could be no night no dayno certainty of recur seasonsno life on this fruitful planet entrance -PRON- stand and watch the wondrous whirligig perform -PRON- mighty evolution 
nearly three hundred and fifty foot per hour -PRON- move more than five foot per minutethe grand majestic sweep of a vast world set spin in the night of age by the allpowerful hand 
prebble and i stand dumb in the presence of the stupendous mechanism koz and -PRON- son lie prostrate pour upon -PRON- head the dust of humility and reverence 
thus in -PRON- several way do the finite pay tribute to the infinite 
-PRON- must build a cairn say i hoarsely turn -PRON- bloodshot eye upon prebble 
why a cairn -PRON- ask 
as a mark to commemorate this visit a proof to any who follow that captain sali and phinea prebble have be here before -PRON- 
the chur be here before any of -PRON- say prebble 
can -PRON- go away and claim the discovery of the north pole when human eye have already look upon -PRON- 
-PRON- eye look out at -PRON- from lid inflame by the heat twinkle oddly 
-PRON- have be first to pierce the ice wall i answer and be entitle to be call discoverer 
suaviter in modo fortiter in re murmur -PRON- learn companion 
-PRON- may just as well claim the discovery without see the thing discover 
i see small difference in the ethic of the case 
-PRON- hop around to ease -PRON- stew foot 
if -PRON- be on cool ground professor say -PRON- may go into thatsubject more exhaustively give -PRON- attention to the cairn however 
who will know what the cairn stand for in case -PRON- happen to be find 
-PRON- will leave a tablet and a flag hot for such work and the professor draw a hand across -PRON- dripping forehead and i fail to see the usefulness of -PRON- 
explorer always build cairn i cry irritably 
then mivabile dictu let -PRON- build one set the chur to collect stone i order while i prepare the tablet 
-PRON- hop away over the steam stone and get the chur at work 
after a short search i discover a piece of flat slatelike rock soft enough to take the sharp point of a piece of agate 
with great care i scratch the following on the slate tablet at this point during the summer of arrived captain sali and professor phinea prebble have set out from america in the year on a voyage of discovery and exploration 
i show the inscription to prebble -PRON- have leave out the most important point -PRON- cry 
what be that 
-PRON- have say nothing about -PRON- own discovery the proof i have develop regard the meteoric theory of the aurora add that as a postscript say by way of humor -PRON- 
so i append the following during the progress of the polar expedition say professor prebble demonstrate the truth ot the meteoric theory of the aurora 
will that do 
i inquire 
very well -PRON- answer greatly pleased 
now if neither of -PRON- live to return to -PRON- own country and some other explorer be able to come to this benighted region shall have -PRON- niche in the hall of fame 
but the tablet be still incomplete 
the tablet already hadscorche -PRON- finger and be become altogether too hot for any more inscription 
what else be there i ask impatiently 
-PRON- theory concern the failure of the human mind north of the arctic circle say -PRON- 
put that in will not i answer and go down on -PRON- knee to affix the eiece of slate in the hot earth 
upon this -PRON- pile -PRON- gather rock 
i superintend the laying of the stone and consider the difficulty under which -PRON- work i believe that a most excellent cairn be construct and one that must still remain on that very spot 
-PRON- be try labor and -PRON- sweat over the task 
the chur labor in a state of awe and apprehension pause constantly to look around -PRON- as though -PRON- expect something to happen -PRON- scarcely know what 
-PRON- action communicate to -PRON- a certain uncanny feeling which have begin with the vast mechanism of the pole -PRON- get nervous confide the professor 
-PRON- be in a region well qualified to make any one nervous i answer make ready to lay the final stone on the apex of the heap have do with this cairn building captain and move to some other place 
-PRON- must continue -PRON- examination of the pole say greatly regret that -PRON- have not the instrument mecessary to make an observation too torrid for observation and -PRON- have already linger here so long that the sol of -PRON- foot be literally do to a turn 
perhaps -PRON- shall never be able to come here again and -PRON- ought to make the most of -PRON- visit 
at the precise moment the final stone be add to the heap -PRON- attention be attract by fearful cry from the chur 
i face about and at once -PRON- startled gaze encounter a sight that freeze -PRON- blood 
the veil of smoke dust and flame be part by a form that plunge through -PRON- like a swimmer through the sea separate the red billow with -PRON- naked hand 
the figure be that of a chur of gigantic proportion -PRON- face be the face of the archfiend monstrous in -PRON- every feature be like diamond the tooth long yellow and two of -PRON- overhang the neth liplike tusk the long red hair writhe as so many tongue of fire about head and shoulder and the long furry limb move with marvelous rapidity 
a whip seem lash -PRON- brain with stinging force and at every blow the voice of sertez rang in -PRON- ear the great ziff 
now will -PRON- believe 
in one hand this hideous giant carry a skull in the other hand a thigh bone 
again and again -PRON- would strike the skull and a dull sepulchral sound would be the result 
as -PRON- pound -PRON- horrid drum -PRON- would roar in monotonous tone syllable which sound like then at interval -PRON- would lift the thigh bone and point southward 
-PRON- must not be suppose that -PRON- see this frightful creature lony 
at one leap -PRON- clear the pole and touch earth then away -PRON- fly at a brobdingnagian pace pomte southward peate the skull and roar -PRON- i look at prebble 
-PRON- head be in -PRON- hand 
i turn to where the chur have be lyinz and see that -PRON- have depart follow the great ziff at top speed 
have -PRON- series of remarkable adventure in this circumpolar country not harden -PRON- to the improbable and the unexpected prebble and i would have think -PRON- go daft get out of this say the professor huskily pick up the biscuit and pemmican bag 
i grab the shotgun irom the rock scarcely notice that the barrel blister -PRON- hand 
then away -PRON- go on the track of the great ziff koz bigoll and xit 
what be -PRON- present opinion of the great ziff prebble 
i ask when -PRON- have reach cool ground and could walk and talk with some little comfort ask -PRON- -PRON- beg 
imagination appear to have take the place of sober sense 
event follow event so swiftly that all seem a riot of the imagination 
the scientific mind find nothing firm enough to stand on and hence all scientific deduction fall flat 
i behold and marvel captain i make no attempt to explain 
the fury be unleashed say i sadly 
nyl will beoverrun and all -PRON- magnificent civilization lay waste 
the great ziff head the ally pack and every chur be like a raven woll 
-PRON- must hasten back to nyll aver the professor 
but what can -PRON- do 
-PRON- can save the kingdom -PRON- answer promptly or as much of -PRON- as be leave when -PRON- arrive 
how leave that to -PRON- 
let -PRON- care be the rescue of princess ylma 
-PRON- apprehension spur -PRON- on to great effort 
just before -PRON- reach the defile from which -PRON- have issue o begin -PRON- journey to the pole -PRON- surmount an elevation that afford -PRON- a viw of the wall the break gate and the plaiz beyond 
a host of chur be flow southward 
the pcssage through the wall be like a strait the animate billow crush through and spread out once more on reach the sandy stretch as far as the eye could reach the inundation roll and -PRON- have no doubt that in the lead rush the great ziff sound -PRON- infernal tocsin and roar -PRON- mysterious slogan 
thus ignorance overwhelm learn mutter prebble and brute force subdue the mind 
let -PRON- not halt i cry in herce impatience on prebble on 
-PRON- could not overtake the procession of warrior but -PRON- come among the woman and child straggle along in the rear 
-PRON- be hour before -PRON- reach the populous portion of nyll and what a melanholy spectacle greet -PRON- on every hand 
house be burn and the chris be everywhere like the red imp of satan carry -PRON- spoil upon -PRON- back or drive nyllite before -PRON- load with the loot of -PRON- own dwelling 
-PRON- appear to have be the policy of the great 
zift to spare that the chur may enslave everywhere there be brutality but nowhere could -PRON- see bloodshed 
as -PRON- make along the road toward the king palace an oyd car come tear toward -PRON- 
in the car be two man whom recognize as griffyn and pollock 
halt 
i command place -PRON- in the middle of the roadway and raise -PRON- hand

halt or i fire 
i cry agam 
this time be obey 
great heaven cry griffyn as -PRON- stop the car 
can this be salis andand prebble say -PRON- fail to recognize -PRON- i answer 
but i do though

what do -PRON- mean ask griffyn and pollock in one breath 
if that distillery have never be build say this awful invasion would never have happen 
i level a trembling forehnger at responsible for all 
-PRON- and prebble be responsible flung back pollock

-PRON- be all of -PRON- at fault but -PRON- be human life be dear to -PRON- and sometimes -PRON- buy -PRON- at too great a price 
have -PRON- any elixir on hand pollock 
several thousand kiss

then i will go with -PRON- and -PRON- will save the kingdom -PRON- turn on -PRON- with a hearty grip of the hand must leave -PRON- captain 
-PRON- be necessary for -PRON- have -PRON- work to do as i have mine 
-PRON- remember what -PRON- lordship tell -PRON- about the nyllite who penetrate the ice wall 
the work now go on be strictly accord to gneisen 
shrewd fellow that gneisen 
-PRON- spring into the oyd car 
similia similibus curantur 
to the distillery griffyn top speed 
while -PRON- have stand in the road talk many 
chur pass -PRON- but give -PRON- little notice 
possibly -PRON- be too intent on the nefarious work before -PRON- 
i journey horror thicken about -PRON- as i proceed 
a whir of wheel from behind claim -PRON- attention and i turn just as a familiar voice call -PRON- name 
a car be dart in iny direction to the broad seat in -PRON- center lord nyli be bind and in the front point be kiimon shriek like a fiend

the condition of affair could not be bad 
every slave in the country have rise and even the slave outnumber the nyllite two to one 
add -PRON- number to the horde that have sweep down on -PRON- from the north and -PRON- will understand how desperate be the situation 
klimon whom i have own for year turn on -PRON- and be conveyiny -PRON- to the great ziff

hope dart into -PRON- face have not think of that -PRON- say 
but let -PRON- on to the palace 
i be worried about -PRON- lord nyli take the driver seat and drive the car at full speed along the road 
many attempt be make to interfere with -PRON- but the shotgun stand -PRON- in good stead and -PRON- finally reach the palace step unmolested 
the king guard to the last warrior have turn against count zylox and -PRON- have be compel to barricade -PRON- in one of the state apartment

-PRON- yelp tone the clashing of -PRON- implement of war cause a deafen din in the room king boazar occupy the massive chair on the dais 
-PRON- hand hang listlessly over the arm and -PRON- head be bow forward -PRON- may have be an attitude of sorrow and despair but attribute -PRON- to another causc 
before -PRON- at the top old the short flight of step stand princess ylma -PRON- eyecs glow and li arm outspread to block the advance of sertez 
the renegade stand below -PRON- oot on the first step and -PRON- gloat gaze turn upward 
nothing can keep -PRON- apart now ylmal -PRON- cry have level every barrier that stand between -PRON-

these chur happen to be from the pack of koz 
thus i be know to -PRON- and the terror of the thunder maker which i carry throw over -PRON- a spell of silence and inaction 
princess ylma be gaze at -PRON- as though -PRON- dare not credit -PRON- sense

the count be a man after -PRON- own heart 
-PRON- show a spirit that arouse -PRON- admiration and i be sorry -PRON- be not a friend of mine 
sertez spring to the fray with a laugh and a taunt the count meet -PRON- bravely and spear strike spear 
then -PRON- be thrust parry thrust parrynow high now lowthe spear head shimmer as -PRON- dart toward each other like serpent count force sertez back step by step and again sertez press the count 
there be a monotony about -PRON- all in spite of the fascination which a battle to the death will always call forth 
but the monotony be suddenly varied

the combat go on 
zylox fight at a terrible disadvantage as be apparent to all of -PRON- and from the throne princess ylma watch with breathless lip and pallid cheek 
the stertorous breathing of the king come to -PRON- ear through the dead silence and now and again -PRON- would move restlessly and mutter incoherently once more there be the monotony of thrust and parry above below and clash clash as the spear head meet and send ring echo through the vault chamber 
a diversion come and come quickly 
the count slipie on the jasper tile and go down -PRON- weapon fly from -PRON- hmd a slight seream escape princess ylma 
with a cry of triumph sertez plunge at -PRON- opponent breast but strike the long shaft aside thereby earn curse from both sertez and the count then sertez and i go at -PRON-

poom poom poom echo the grinning skull roar the great ziff and point the thigh bone at the king 
the chur spring erect 
now captain if -PRON- can do anything whisper -PRON- lordship frantically now 
the giant be advance upon the throne 
in a trice i raise the gun and give -PRON- hoth barrel 
the roar in that confine space be awful beyond word 
as the smoke clear -PRON- see the great ziff sprawl on the floor 
-PRON- gaze be tell what i behold with -PRON- own eyeseven as -PRON- look -PRON- form fade into thin air so that -PRON- see nothing but the bloodred tile 
and then from without -PRON- hear the sepulchral sound of bone and skull and the roar of the ziff as strong as ever 
the chur rush from the throne room and from the palace while the count -PRON- lordship and i hasten to one of the window 
there this colossal creature stand gather -PRON- cohort unharme in body or limb 
i be sorry the professor be not a witness of this proceeding for -PRON- afterward tell -PRON- i must have be frighten out of -PRON- wit so that fear color -PRON- account of the extraordinary event 
those who have follow -PRON- so far i trust will know -PRON- better than that the palace door cry count zylox 
-PRON- three will hold the place against the invader 
-PRON- hurry to follow out -PRON- suggestion 
after every door have be secure -PRON- look down from a lofty window and to -PRON- infense surprise find that the great ziff and -PRON- follower have leave the vicinity of the palace 
-PRON- be safe for the present say lord nyli heave a sigh of relief 
the ziff will return aver the count 
until -PRON- do go on -PRON- lordship turn to -PRON- there will be little for -PRON- to do captain 
if -PRON- would like to go to the lavatory and make a change of garment i will be glad to conduct -PRON- 
-PRON- make the suggestion out of the kindness of -PRON- heart and i be grateful to -PRON- for -PRON- in truth i be a sorrylooke representative of the united state army as i stand before -PRON- 
i still wear what remain of -PRON- buskin but -PRON- be the sole relic of -PRON- former state 
in the land of the chur prebble and i have both don the prevail bearskin and while mine cover -PRON- from shoulder to knee and be respectable enough yet -PRON- be hardly a court even for those try time 
while i be engage in make myseli more presentable lord nyli from an adjoin room beguie -PRON- labor with conversation know -PRON- should hear from sertez in some such maunner say -PRON- 
who be this sertez 
i inquire scoundrel and a renegade have discover that much for -PRON- -PRON- lordship 
i have also learn that -PRON- have be among the chur since the beginning of the long day 
-PRON- be banish 
yes 
that be a mistake however 
mistake in this way captain -PRON- should have be condemn to death by oyd instead of merely be banish 
count zylox and i be anxious to see -PRON- receive the death penalty but princess ylma prevail with the king and sentence of banishment be pronounce 
i be wash the red stain from -PRON- shoulder 
the wound be merely a scratch and in no wise interfere with -PRON- uscfulness fagerly i caucht at -PRON- lordship mention of the princess why do the princess interfere in behalf of sertez i query 
that trench upon the matter for which sertez be send away be the reply 
there be no reason why i should not tell -PRON- about -PRON- captain 
-PRON- have becn of great service to the king and the princess md the kingdom be under a vast obligation to -PRON- shall be glad to hear about -PRON- say sertez -PRON- lordship go on be make much of by king boazar 
the fortune of sertez be small but wealth be no bar to advancement in the kingdom of nyll 
-PRON- majesty conceive a liking for sertez and take -PRON- into the palace as one of the gentleman in wait 
the possession of twenty chur entitle a nyllite to a patent of nobility for in the old time to rule a score of chur one prove the possession of a powerful intellect and intellect alone admit to the peerage 
one who aspire to be a noble be require to capture -PRON- chur with -PRON- own hand and subdue -PRON- 
sertez with great bravery win -PRON- twenly slave and be take into the palace as one of the king houschold 
-PRON- lordship pause for a moment have little time to dwell upon the peculiar ability necessary before one could become a noble of that queer kingdom 
once in the palace proceed lord nylis sertez have the presumption to lift -PRON- eyve to the princess 
thus in a way -PRON- prove -PRON- a serpent and strike at the hand which feed -PRON- 
princess ylma be design by the king as a mate for count zylox thus weld the two branch of the royal family together and avert discord when the time come for the king to pass 
sertez be that right lord nylis 
i demand 
should the king use -PRON- power to consummate such an alliance 
be not princess ylma to have a choice in the matter princess of the blood captain come sadly from -PRON- lordship be but pawn inthe game of royalty 
-PRON- lot be cast wherever policy may elect 
in this case and i quite coincide with -PRON- majesty the two branch of the roval family must be unite 
from what i have say about the king plan for -PRON- daughter vou will understand more clearly the presumption of sertez in aspire to the hand of the princess 
-PRON- repulse -PRON- and place the matter before the king 
i majesty be enrage and summon sertez before -PRON- to answer for -PRON- action 
sertez be find guilty and condemn to death by oyd 
princess ylma interfere and the sentence be commute to banishment 
the princess should not have interfere say most assuredly not but -PRON- have a tender heart and could not bear to think that sertez be to suffer death on -PRON- account 
-PRON- be all one with sertez now lord nylis 
-PRON- be spare to plan with the chur the destruction of the kingdom bu -PRON- end have finally overtake -PRON- 
the evil have be accomplish comment lord with a heavy sigh and -PRON- will be long before -PRON- country recover from the blow 
-PRON- be a lesson to -PRON- country say -PRON- should teach all of -PRON- to beware of anything indulgence in which will tend to becloud -PRON- faculty do not know the power of this elixir 
for which the pfofessor and i be guilty 
i acknowledge the debt -PRON- owe -PRON- people nylis and -PRON- be do what -PRON- can to atone for -PRON- misguided action lay nothing at -PRON- door captain 
-PRON- and -PRON- companion have to do something to preserve -PRON- life and -PRON- take the ready mean at hand be hopeful as -PRON- say that -PRON- country will profit by the grievous lesson 
do -PRON- think the professor will succeed in -PRON- am positive of -PRON- say with conviction 
prebble be an able man and when -PRON- set -PRON- hand to a piece of work -PRON- usually accomplish -PRON- 
the elixir be a weapon that work both way 
savage be especially partial to -PRON- 
the chur be not gift with the reason power of the will easily fall victim to the insidious beverage 
-PRON- and -PRON- people on the other hand will profit by the lesson and abstain from such elixir in future 
the easy way to make -PRON- abstain be to remove the elixir from among -PRON- 
the place where -PRON- be manufacture must be destroy at the early possible moment 
that will be attend to 
be the process of manufacture know to any of the yllite no pollock and griffyn have keep the process a secret good 
i exclaim 
before another hour have pass i feel a different man 
tmmediately after emerge from the lavatory and dress chamber i repair to the throne room 
princess ylma be still beside the king who be recover slightly and call for more of the elixir 
the moment i enter -PRON- descend and come toward -PRON- with outstretche hand 
the count as observed have thoughtfully drag the body of sertez rom the apartment and only the stain of blood remain to mark the spot where the sanguinary struggle have take place 
save for the king -PRON- be alone the princess and i catch -PRON- hand and hold -PRON- for a moment peer into -PRON- wonderful hlue cye 
a knew -PRON- would come -PRON- say softly -PRON- lid droop and the color come and go in -PRON- full round cheek come quickly -PRON- princess say but could not arrive before the chur 
-PRON- be a stranger -PRON- say flash a quick look at -PRON- and i can not be -PRON- princess 
neverthelessx i return drop on one knee and press -PRON- hand to -PRON- lip -PRON- be -PRON- princess and must call -PRON- so 
-PRON- raise -PRON- gently be tell that -PRON- would not be able to learn the secret of the gorr plate -PRON- proceed as i stand at -PRON- side learn -PRON- i answer not think -PRON- necessary to describe the means 
then be i ble -PRON- hesitate -PRON- lip be ever in -PRON- heart i whisper 
and -PRON- think of -PRON- in the same manner that i think of -PRON- 
yes i reply 
lver since -PRON- save -PRON- companion and -PRON- at the lake -PRON- have never be absent from either mind or heart 
a lover must be allow some latitude even at the pole where latitude be stretch to -PRON- farth limit 
-PRON- withdraw -PRON- hand quickly 
turn -PRON- make -PRON- way back to the throne and sit on the step 
come -PRON- say make a place beside -PRON- 
i wish to ask -PRON- if -PRON- and -PRON- companion can be of any aid to this poor country in -PRON- present plight 
-PRON- shall do -PRON- good to save the country be -PRON- response and i believe that success will attend -PRON- effort 
the professor be now engage in the work griffyn and pollock be with -PRON- 
nothing can be do -PRON- declare with spirit this elixir be destroy to the last drop 
i have give order for the burning of the building in which -PRON- be make 
the professor countermand -PRON- order 
-PRON- eye flash 
why -PRON- ask imperiousuy 
because although -PRON- have be the mean of bring woe and unhappiness to nyll -PRON- may yet be employ in save the country 
the elixir be a good servant but a bad master 
how may the elixir be employ 
let the chur partake of -PRON- and -PRON- will render -PRON- helpless 
then the nyllite may rise conquer the savage and resume -PRON- use of the elixir -PRON- interrupt sorrowfully 
no 
after the chur have be conquer then burn the distillery and let every keese of the elixir be pour on the ground 
-PRON- clap -PRON- hand and a joyful look overspread -PRON- face 
but the joy be shortlive 
and then -PRON- resume the king will order the other stranger to build a new distillery as -PRON- call -PRON- and -PRON- will have to comply in order to save -PRON- life 
princess return -PRON- poor life have be the cause of all this misery 
have the professor and i not value -PRON- existence so highly the king would never have taste the content of that first flask nor would the second flask have be give -PRON- nor would the distillery have be build 
be -PRON- sure -PRON- will demand more of the elixir when -PRON- recover reason and see what direful consequence have follow -PRON- use the taste be strong upon -PRON- -PRON- drink the brown fluid continually be sure -PRON- will order more of -PRON- 
in that event say i grimly griffyn the professor and must leave the country where will -PRON- go -PRON- ask tremulously 
back to -PRON- own land 
beyond the ice wall -PRON- hand creep toward -PRON- and catch -PRON- clingingly 
yes 
will there not be danger in the attempt suppose so be -PRON- glum rejoinder 
will -PRON- not dread to face -PRON- -PRON- cheek be close to mine -PRON- starvy eye fix upon -PRON- own and burn with a light that thrill -PRON- 
i place -PRON- other hand about -PRON- waist shall dread face the danger much less than leave the princess ylma 
-PRON- sigh 
tell -PRON- of -PRON- own country -PRON- sard 
be -PRON- a wonderful land like our 
in some way more wonderful but in other less so 
-PRON- have no gorr plate no oyd car no king no princess but -PRON- have -PRON- ziff many of -PRON- and all fully as terrible as the one -PRON- have lately see 
do -PRON- not destroy the mind of the people 
the brown fluid do that then come the ziff 
do the ziff bring -PRON- chur 
-PRON- have no chur princess 
every man be -PRON- own chur 
these shaggy monster skulk in the trail of the brown fluid and battle with the man well self until the ziff come and finish the work 
-PRON- shudder should not like -PRON- country -PRON- say 
onlys if -PRON- be there even such a land may be paradise for -PRON- 
the word be still on -PRON- lip as i pluck the last one with a kiss -PRON- scoundrel count zylox 
the princess push from -PRON- with a ittle cry and -PRON- both look up to find the captain of the guard regard -PRON- with a scowl 
i arise haughtily can not forget that i be in the presence of a lady say or i should answer -PRON- speech in kind 
eavesdropper rarely hear anything to -PRON- liking 
-PRON- introduce a curse into the land sneer the count and after destroy the people -PRON- attempt the destruction of the king only daughter so liar 
i cry 
-PRON- base insinuation be too much for -PRON- hot blood 
i launch -PRON- toward -PRON- and have not the princess interfere would have teach -PRON- a lesson then and there 
the king daughter be between -PRON- hand fall and i step back 
-PRON- pardon princess ylma murmur 
aly at somie other time and in some other place -PRON- shall yield -PRON- satisfaction for -PRON- word 
-PRON- shall not -PRON- return a very queen in speech and bearing shall prove -PRON- manhood by ignore a man who forget -PRON- as count zylox have do 
-PRON- face the count desire -PRON- to leave this room 
there aie other thing to command -PRON- attention at the present moment 
nothing more imiportant than this -PRON- answer 
-PRON- bend -PRON- eye upon -PRON- steadily 
withdraw -PRON- command 
for the first time i see that the count have the shotgun in -PRON- hand 
let -PRON- first give -PRON- that weapon princess ylma i request 
take -PRON- say the count savagely and fling -PRON- with all the force of -PRON- left arm down on the tile 
the piece be break beyond repair 
-PRON- heart sink for i have count on use the gun in defense of the palace should -PRON- be attack 
as the count turn on -PRON- heel a loud commotion be hear at the palace entrance 
-PRON- hurry away and i start to follow 
promise -PRON- before -PRON- go say princess yima that -PRON- will not renew this quarrel promise say and hasten on 
-PRON- be unnecessarily alarm by the noise on the palace step 
the great ziff have not return with the chur but pollock have come with an oyd car and a tank of elixir 
-PRON- report that prebble griffyn and -PRON- have start in different direction through the kingdom each with a large quantity of the brown fluid 
this be be judiciously distribute among the chur 
-PRON- be wild atter the stuff say pollock and be cast aside -PRON- loot -PRON- shield and spear and even allow -PRON- prisoner to escape so that -PRON- may drink more and more of the fire water 
in twentyfour hour if the nyllite will rise nyll will be -PRON- once more 
pollock leave after be reassure as to the safety of the king and the princess 
i run back to the throne room to acquaint the princess with the progress of the good work but the apartment be desert 
since there be rfo danger to threaten i throw -PRON- down in one of the reclining room to rest after the exciting event of the last few hour 
wear out i fall asleep 
when i awake i be not in the reclining room 
all around -PRON- be black darkness and a dank smell as from moldy wall 
what have happen to -PRON- 
i dash -PRON- hand across -PRON- face to free -PRON- brain from the evil spell that seem to encompass -PRON- 
still the darkness would not lift 
be i mad 
i reach out on either side 
on -PRON- right space on -PRON- left a blank slippery wall 
i feel below 
i be lie on a slab of stome 
staggering erect i grope -PRON- way aimlessly about 
presently i come to another wall 
turn i pace to the wall opposite 
twenty pace 
detween wall the other way i also count twenty pace 
then i climb upon the block of stone and reach upward -PRON- finger touch the roof 
under -PRON- around above nothing but granite 
sit down on the slab i bow -PRON- head in -PRON- hand be a prisoner there be no doubt of that 
but how have -PRON- be able to carry -PRON- off without wake -PRON- 
i be not a heavy sleeper and the croon of a rope through an oil sheave have more than once send -PRON- from niy bunk 
i smell an odor strange to -PRON- nostril 
abh i have be drug 
resistance be fear and these man who be wide awake for six month of the year have take advantage of -PRON- in -PRON- sleep and drug and imprison -PRON- 
-PRON- be zylox of course 
-PRON- have see -PRON- with the princess have hear -PRON- conversation and -PRON- have increase -PRON- enmity toward -PRON- 
-PRON- be a brave man and have the good of the kingdom at heart 
but brave man be weak when strike on the side of -PRON- affection 
-PRON- love the princess and -PRON- care nothing for -PRON- 
-PRON- would not brook interfence on -PRON- part and death be to be -PRON- portion 
i wonder how long an interval have pass since i lie down in the reclining room 
i also think of prebble and wonder if -PRON- have succeed in save the klingdom what would -PRON- do when -PRON- hear that i be a prisoncr 
what could -PRON- do 
possibly -PRON- would not hear 
no doubt i be in the stronghold of count zylox where i conld be deal with at -PRON- enemys pleasure 
and the princess 
would -PRON- ever know -PRON- fate 
as i sit there with bow head a door open raspingly and light strike across the gloom look up and see the count enter accompany by four armed chur 
i spring erect and rush toward -PRON- but two spear cross front of -PRON- breast and stay mec 
keep -PRON- distance say the count 
be there a spark of honor or manhood about -PRON- i cry 
will -PRON- not orant -PRON- the satisfaction one gentleman may yield another face to face would not soil -PRON- hand fight coward 
-PRON- smile ith -PRON- cage rat may rage at a lion say -PRON- coolly 
where be in a dungeon of the king palace 
why be i here lese majesty 
high treason 
i exclaim trumpedup charge zylox 
no stranger in the country can commit treason 
no but -PRON- can do bad and plan odious thing 
i tremble with anger 
tt be not the part of a brave man to taunt a prisoner unable to defend -PRON- say then donot force -PRON- with -PRON- question 
do the king know i be here 
-PRON- be here by -PRON- order 
then -PRON- have poison -PRON- mind against -PRON- have simply tell -PRON- the truth and -PRON- have draw -PRON- own conclusion 
what be to be do with -PRON- 
what should have be do when -PRON- and -PRON- comrade first show yourself in the land 
-PRON- add laconically death by oyd 
i sink down on the stone slab 
when 
i ask after a moment 
in two hour 
where 
here in this cell 
-PRON- impending doom strange as -PRON- may seem have a quieting effect upon -PRON- nerve 
what of the kingdom i ask 
-PRON- and will live to the end of time under the reign of the almikboazar 
the chur be all enslave and the great ziff have flee to the unknown 
heaven be praise for that 
the professor be successful in -PRON- attempt to save the land 
the weapon that work the havoc be turn upon -PRON- foe 
small credit to this professor of yours 
-PRON- and -PRON- introduce the evil so -PRON- be -PRON- business to stamp -PRON- out if -PRON- could 
-PRON- be safe 
i ask 
yes -PRON- and the other two 
-PRON- will be give safe conduct to the ice wall 
i -PRON- return to the country -PRON- fate will be -PRON- 
leave -PRON- in peace say will -PRON- have more peace with a light -PRON- sneer have bring -PRON- one 
one of the slave carry two luminous globe 
at a signal from the count -PRON- lay one of the globe on the floor say zylox with a grim laugh a hour and pass out with -PRON- attendant 
the door be secure and again leave alone 
the light however make -PRON- situation more endurable 
even when confront by death a man mind will deal with trivial thing 
i marvel at the luminous globe for -PRON- be not feed with oil nor have -PRON- a wick 
-PRON- resemble a sphere of glass but if -PRON- be glass -PRON- be the first speciman of -PRON- i have see in nyll 
i walk to the globe bent over -PRON- and pick -PRON- up 
something white lie under -PRON- 
hastily i put down the globe and possess -PRON- of the object 
-PRON- be a bit of fold linen 
i unfold -PRON- and find that -PRON- bear queer mark upon -PRON- surface make with a yellow pigment long and earnestly i study the mark but could make nothing of -PRON- 
i turn the square of linen upside down and still the character be not legible 
suddenly a thought strike -PRON- and i remove the talk ring 
i have find the key to the situation for the word be write in english and of course i could not read -PRON- while think in nyll keep a stiff upper lip captain 
-PRON- friend have not abandon -PRON- will be with -PRON- presently 
the note be unsigned but i know -PRON- must come from prebble 
the light bearer have be bribe to lay down the note with the glohe 
hope revive in -PRON- breast although for the life of -PRON- i could not understand how get out of the dungeon would save -PRON- from impend doom 
after escape from the palace i would still have to leave the kingdom and to do that unseen in the broad glare of that long day would be impossible 
for some time i continue to rack -PRON- brain with doubt 
then again come the creak of the door and prebble stand before -PRON- 
-PRON- also be cladin a new tunic and through the lense of -PRON- spectacle -PRON- eye beam encouragingly 
i rush to -PRON- and catch -PRON- by both hand 
prebble 
i exclaim 
how have vou manage to come tome lord nyli request -PRON- of the king as a personal favor -PRON- answer 
the king be determine on -PRON- death -PRON- be adamant 
if that flask of bourbon be to be blame for -PRON- -PRON- be strange the rest of vou be not here with -PRON- 
-PRON- be not on account of the flask of bourbon captain 
the rest of -PRON- have not dare to make love to princess yima 
then as i expect zylox be the move force agamst -PRON- 
not only zylox but the whole lord nylis 
-PRON- regret the occurrence but -PRON- have make -PRON- -PRON- friend and -PRON- stand by -PRON- 
what of the princess 
i smile 
-PRON- stand by -PRON- too and there have be stormy time in the palace the princess entreat -PRON- father to spare -PRON- and -PRON- father only wish -PRON- have nine life like a cat so -PRON- could take -PRON- all 
-PRON- have commit a very heinous offense captain 
l could not help -PRON- nor would i have help -PRON- if i could like -PRON- 
but i must not squander anything so valuable as time at the present moment 
plan have be make to rescue -PRON- 
to get -PRON- out of the palace 
yes 
what will -PRON- avail 
suppose i do get out of the palace what then 
must i hide -PRON- somewhere until the long night while all nyll sleep hardly 
griffyn have construct a new balloon construct a balloon 
i gasp 
that be -PRON- 
-PRON- have make -PRON- out of a royal cloth weave from thread spin byspider 
griffyn have really do remarkably well 
the structure use as a distillery form -PRON- workroom and while -PRON- be ostensibly assist pollock in the manu facture of spirit -PRON- be really construct this airship 
-PRON- utilize what material -PRON- could take from the wreck of the old balloon and the result be most creditable 
the bag be now be inflate in an open space near where the distillery use to be 
the gin mill have be burn to the ground -PRON- know and there be not a drop of elixir to be have anywhere in the kingdom 
will griffyn feeling as -PRON- do toward -PRON- take -PRON- with -PRON- 
i inquire doubtfully 
misfortune have draw -PRON- all together captain and feeling toward -PRON- have undergo a hange 
besides i insure -PRON- assage in the agreement 
what agreement balloon be not of much use without gas 
griffyn could make the balloon but -PRON- could not make the gas 
i have do that in return for the privilege of -PRON- be allow to go with -PRON- in the airship 
and the balloon be beinr inflate -PRON- say 
-PRON- will be ready for uce by the time -PRON- be ready to use -PRON- 
but i be to meet -PRON- fate within two hour 
-PRON- laugh 
so -PRON- be but not in the way -PRON- imagine 
now listen captain shortly after i leave a slave will come to -PRON- with food 
when -PRON- go out -PRON- will accompany -PRON- 
-PRON- understand and there will be notrouble 
when -PRON- part from the chur some one else will take -PRON- in charge 
that be all 
-PRON- be think that i have come to say good by to -PRON- so i must ng or suspicion will be arouse not hnfrer too lo say do everything i be tell to do pfessmg hand 
prebble go away and i pace the confine of the dungeon impatiently while wait for the chur with whom i be to depart 
-PRON- come in due course nervous to a degree and frighten almost out of -PRON- wit by the part -PRON- be plave 
through damp and tortuous underground passage i be conduct until -PRON- seem as though -PRON- have traverse several mile of labyrinth 
when -PRON- reach the end -PRON- be at a flight of stone step lead upward 
the chur ascend the step and push at an iron door 
after some effort -PRON- succeed in throw the door open and daylight penetrate the gloom 
as the slave stand on the topmost step i see hand reach over and lie a golden chain around -PRON- neck 
-PRON- face quiver with joy and -PRON- kiss the hand before -PRON- be withdraw 
then -PRON- beckon -PRON- and stand aside while i pass up and out 
the exit let -PRON- out of door grove stretch around -PRON- and i could see no one not even the person who have confer the gold necklace upon the chur 
i turn to question the slave by sign but -PRON- have disappear cover the spot where i have gain the surface from below and so nicely be the door fit into the turf that no eye could detect -PRON- presence 
as i stand wait i hear a soft voice captain 
behind -PRON- stand princess ylma have just step out from among the tree 
i hurry to -PRON- catch -PRON- in -PRON- arm and press -PRON- lip to -PRON- be not expect -PRON- ylma i say 
do -PRON- think i would abandon -PRON- -PRON- return a surprised look on -PRON- face 
no nonot that 
i be sure -PRON- could do nothing 
the professor in fact tell -PRON- how hard -PRON- have labor with the ling and how unsuccessful -PRON- be 
-PRON- father be very unkind to -PRON- -PRON- say with tremble lip 
-PRON- do not appreciate what -PRON- and the professor have donefor the kingdom 
-PRON- work the evil ylma and -PRON- be -PRON- duty to repair -PRON- as well as -PRON- could 
-PRON- majesty owe -PRON- nothing on that score 
but where be -PRON- 
have i not better be hasten to the airship 
be -PRON- so anxious to leave -PRON- then -PRON- pout wish that i may never leave -PRON- 
i answer fervently be forsake nyll for the good of the kingdom -PRON- understand

there be several car pursue -PRON- say -PRON- companion 
have -PRON- far to go 
i ask draw out the screen and give the car more speed 
only a little way 
there 
ahead of -PRON- be the airship 
a low hill bare of tree lay directly before -PRON- 
on the crest of the hill arise the fzur ruin wall of distillery and near the walle be the huge swaying bulk of the balloon 
in the sunlight the great globe look like frost silver 
about the basket i could see the form of prebble griffyn and pollock look down on -PRON- with frantically wave arm 
what be the matter with -PRON- i be ask -PRON- 
certainly the mere excitement attend -PRON- flight and pursuit could not cause such strange action on -PRON- part 
presently the road angle to the right and when -PRON- dash around -PRON- come upon six oyd car draw up abreast of each other across -PRON- path 
there be no get between the car and no swerve to right or leave to pass -PRON- 
thick wood flank each side of the way 
in order to avoid a wreck i be force to draw to a halt 
tn the name of the king shout a voice as a man arise in one of the car that confront -PRON- 
the whir and rumble of the other car could be hear advance upon -PRON- from behind 
tost exclaim ylma a heartbreake tone

i understand then that -PRON- be to leave the car and take to the wood 
not lose i pant springing to the ground the sword grip tightly in -PRON- right hand 
come 
-PRON- will gain the hill if heaven so will -PRON- or i shall die make the attempt 
-PRON- courage rise grandly to the occasion and -PRON- leap lightly to -PRON- side 
do -PRON- think there be hope -PRON- ask 
while there be life there be always hope 
with hand clasp -PRON- hurry into the deep shadow of the wood 
-PRON- be within spear throw but none of the ugly dart be iaunche at -PRON- 
-PRON- -PRON- be willing enough to spear but the princess be at -PRON- side and none dare risk a throw -PRON- order a voice rescue the princessnot a hair of -PRON- head must be injuredbut slay the foreign devilslay -PRON-

from behind -PRON- come a triumphant cry 
i pauscd turn and see that a chur have overtake -PRON-

-PRON- be ascend the hill now 
there be no timber and -PRON- be in plain view of -PRON- pursuer 
but still no spear be thrownthe danger to the princess be too great 
a hundred yard more and -PRON- would be at the balloon 
could i make -PRON- 
the chur be bound up the hillside from rock to rock come closer and closer at every spring 
the sweat stand out on -PRON- forehead in great drop -PRON- heart pound furiously and i could hear the roar of rush blood in -PRON- ear 
another of the chur be right at -PRON- heel 
then i perceive that griffyn and pallock be beside -PRON- 
a lusty righthander from pollock lay the chur in -PRON- track 
let -PRON- help -PRON- captain say griffyn 
between -PRON- -PRON- bear ylma the remain distance and place -PRON- in the basket 
in with -PRON- cry prebble sake hurry 
the professor be stand on the rim of the basket knife in hand wait to cut the rope that hold the balloon to earth 
i be throw into the basket by griffyn who pile in after -PRON- 
prebble cut the rope and -PRON- shoot skyward with pollock cling to the edge of the car 
i look over and downward 
nyll and the nyllite be recede rapidly 
as i gaze the chur hurl an impetent shower of spear which fall far short of -PRON- 
zylox be below and -PRON- be the last face i see 
-PRON- expression of hate and baffled rage be awful to behold 
as -PRON- figure fade and blur on -PRON- sight -PRON- be shake -PRON- fist upward at the mount airship 
save cry prebble jubilantly tell -PRON- that when -PRON- leave the dungeon captain -PRON- would meet -PRON- fate 
ylma smile and hold out -PRON- hand to -PRON- do not think of -PRON- word in this light say take the little hand in mine think the lot of -PRON- have have a time of -PRON- say griffyn 
so -PRON- have -PRON- hearty i return well that end well may i look over captain ask ylma 
certainly -PRON- may say and i hold -PRON- arm about -PRON- while -PRON- take a final look at -PRON- country and -PRON- people 
when -PRON- turn to mea moment later there be a smile of joy on -PRON- lip and tear of sorrow in -PRON- eye 
the wind favor -PRON- return southward say griffyn 
if nothing unforeseen happen -PRON- shall reach the land beyond the ice wall before the griffyn pause 
-PRON- could not calculate the ienzth of time that would be require for crossinz the kingdom and the frozen plain beyond 
l can make no guess about the length of time necessary to place -PRON- in comfort and safety say -PRON- but the present breeze seem to be as strong or strong than the wind that carrizd -PRON- north 
how many hour be -PRON- in the air on the other occasion inquire prebble 
-PRON- be twentyfive hour professor 
from the time -PRON- leave the spot where the balloon be inflate until pollock and i land in the parachute 
then by tomorrow if this wind hold and nothing go wrong with the gas bag -PRON- should be among the settlement say i yes nod griffyn donot think anything will go wrong with the balloon 
-PRON- hasbeen strongly construct and if the professor have furnish -PRON- with a good brand of gas -PRON- should make a landall safely and quickly 
-PRON- and the professor have do exceedingly well griffyn say approvingly 
the englishman laugh 
-PRON- life depend on -PRON- effort and -PRON- may be sure that -PRON- labor like a lot of bally slave 
-PRON- try to think of everythingfood water ballast and good warm clothing against -PRON- passage over the ice field have not have time as yet to note the equipment of the car 
now however i take occasion to look around -PRON- and find that -PRON- be snugly ensconce amony many package regret exceedingly say i that -PRON- be oblige to resort to so much violence in get away 
the nyllite and the chur get -PRON- whack return griffyn easily 
-PRON- life be at stake sali and -PRON- could not be expect to stand on ceremony 
-PRON- voice take on a note of reproach as -PRON- add -PRON- affection for the be hardly wise 
but for that there would have be no violence and no trouble 
-PRON- will kindly leave the princess out of the question i answer -PRON- sharply maintain however say -PRON- steadily that -PRON- be well that -PRON- leave -PRON- princess behind that i demand think i have not hear aright 
-PRON- would have be a calamity for all concerned have -PRON- bring princess ylma away with -PRON- 
nyll be -PRON- home and the nyllite be -PRON- people 
-PRON- would not thrive in a foreign land and to spirit -PRON- away be hardly the fair thing for the kingdom 
i stare at the man 
-PRON- could talk in that inexplicable strain with the princess in the car with -PRON- 
from -PRON- i turn to the professor 
-PRON- dear captain say prebble commiseratingly i be quite of opmion 
-PRON- do well to leave princess ylma behind -PRON- be unhurt in spite of the violent scene -PRON- both pass through and let -PRON- hope -PRON- will soon forget -PRON- and turn a more favoring cye upon zylox 
i turn to look toward the place where the princessmy princesswa stand 
-PRON- smile brightly at -PRON- and i whirl upon the professor and griffyn 
be -PRON- mad i shout 
or be -PRON- talk of leave the princess behind when -PRON- be here with -PRON- in plain view of all of -PRON- 
speak ylma 
i ask look around at -PRON- 
-PRON- be quite true captain ylma answer softly be with -PRON- and shall always be with -PRON- 
there 
i exclaim triumphantly 
griffyn and prebble merely smile at mesmile tolerantly and kindly trust with all -PRON- heart say prebble i ill will come to nylis for the aid -PRON- give s 
-PRON- have powerful friend at court speak up the princess and -PRON- lordship can not be harm 
to -PRON- anger and surprise no one in the car aside from -PRON- pay any attention to the princess word 
i begin to experience a bewderlng sensation a sensation which fill -PRON- with an astonishment that remain even to this day 
i step to the side of ylma speak to -PRON- i try to touch -PRON- with -PRON- hand 
where -PRON- have stand -PRON- be not the word i address to -PRON- receive no answer the hand i put forth touch only space 
where be -PRON- shout angrily 
what have -PRON- do with -PRON- 
griffyn 
prebble 
what have become of princess ylma 
i be angry for feel that some trick have be play upon -PRON- 
in -PRON- bewilderment and wrath i lay hand upon griffyn 
instantly -PRON- and prebble and pollock seize -PRON- in a fierce grip and while the car sway with the struggle i be bear down upon the bale and package double up in the confined space and hold by sheer force 
be the victim of a plot 
what plot could there be which prebble always loyal could take part against -PRON- 
suddenly a weight seem lift 
something snap in -PRON- brain or else the two end of a mental chain be reunite with a flashing as of live wire 
-PRON- anger fall from -PRON- and -PRON- lift hand drop nerveless 
what be -PRON- man try to do 
i mnqure 
thank heaven exclaim prebble 
lie will be all right now griffyn 
let hin sleep 
and somehow i do sleep 
i have now come to a part of this chronicle which have always be a mystery to -PRON- 
the event surround the escape from the land of nyll and especially those which have to do with the princess at that time have fade into the wraek leave by a weirdand in many respect a delightfuldream 
when i open -PRON- eye after fall asleep in the car i experience a disagreeable feeling of cold and discomfort 
griffyn prebble and pollock swathe in heavy garment be release bag of ballast with -PRON- mittene hand 
have -PRON- ballast enough 
i hear prebble inquire think so professor griffyn answer 
-PRON- see i have count upon the effect the frigid air over the ice field would have on the gas in the envelope 
the only way to counteract the loss of buoyancy be by hurl ballast out of the car 
therefore i make the balloon large and equip -PRON- with plenty of sandbag 
where be the princess demand sit up 
pollock have as little interest in -PRON- as i have inhim 
-PRON- keep to -PRON- work without pay the slight attention griffyn and prebble however face around and give -PRON- encouraging smile 
if -PRON- donot feel warm enough captain say prebble wrap another bearskin around -PRON- 
this climate be vastly different from that of nyll 
but where be the princess 
i persist 
safely in the palace i make no doubt and i hope there be peace between -PRON- and -PRON- father and that count zylox be find favor 
-PRON- be a worthy gentleman in spite of the fact that -PRON- have -PRON- difference and -PRON- deserve the good of fortune 
i look around the car confuse and wonder e knock zylox off -PRON- lordship car with the gorr plate i observe be when -PRON- find -PRON- wait for -PRON- instead of lord nyli 
-PRON- be no insignificant blow i can tell -PRON- 
the professor cackle 
then captain -PRON- have leave with -PRON- a memento say -PRON- 
probably -PRON- will not treasure -PRON- will -PRON- not tell -PRON- what have become of the princess beg pass a mittened hand over -PRON- brow 
-PRON- remember bound up the rock carry princess ylma in -PRON- arm ask the professor remember that yes i answer eagerly 
and do -PRON- remember that griffyn and pollock come to -PRON- rescue just as a chur have knock -PRON- flat with a blow from behind remember about griffyn and pollock but i be not strike down by the chur 
blank astonishient cross the professor face 
i proceed to recite the progress of event from that point 
-PRON- be pollock who bowl over the chur 
then griffyn help -PRON- carry yima to the balloon and -PRON- place -PRON- in the basket 
-PRON- tumble in after -PRON- 
-PRON- prebble be standine on the rim of the basket a knife in vour haud and the moment -PRON- be all aboard -PRON- slash a rope in twain and the balloon sail away into spacc 
the chur fling a shower of spear afier -PRON- but -PRON- fall short 
zylox be below and -PRON- face be the last one i see that i can distinctly remember 
ylma be with usthere can be no doubt on that score 
-PRON- want to take a final look at the kingdom of nyl as ve sweep over -PRON- and i remember steady -PRON- as hc peer over the edge of the basket 
pollbck have look around in considerable astonishment 
prebble and griffyn be exchange puzzle look face be first to clear 
why say -PRON- with a laugh from the mompent griffyn and pollock go to -PRON- rescue captain -PRON- fancy have be play weird prank 
-PRON- prove -PRON- add jubilantly -PRON- theory regard the irresponsible of the mind north of the arctic circle be correct mean to say cry protestingly that i imagine all that about -PRON- escape with the princess exactly that say prebble 
what really happen captain be this -PRON- be wait for -PRON- at the balloon and -PRON- hardly think -PRON- possible for -PRON- to get clear of -PRON- enemy 
but -PRON- do manage to force a way through -PRON- by leave the road and take to the wood 
ve see -PRON- hard beset climb the rock with the princess in -PRON- arm griffyn and pollock sally out to do what -PRON- could 
just as -PRON- reach -PRON- a chur floor -PRON- with a blow 
-PRON- fall and the princess drop from -PRON- arm 
griffyn and pollock could not bear away both -PRON- and the princess so -PRON- pick -PRON- up and carry -PRON- to the balloon 
-PRON- be half daze and wholly irrational 
the princess be not here but -PRON- insist on talk to -PRON- just as though -PRON- be here 
-PRON- grow angry when -PRON- try to explain and -PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to use force 
while -PRON- be hold -PRON- down -PRON- seem to recover -PRON- wit but the delusion regard the princess have not be dispel 
i trust i have make that matter clear to -PRON- now however canot understand -PRON- i mutter 
although i could not understand yet i be force to accept explanation princess be not in the car 
this one fact prove -PRON- in error would almost as readily think that -PRON- experience in the land of nyll and among the chur be equally a product of -PRON- imagination say not at all speak up griffyn for -PRON- have the testimony of the rest of -PRON- to adduce in prooi 
that blow on the head deal by the chur be what do the business for -PRON- sali have no recollection of -PRON- 
-PRON- head be bandage 
that ought to be suflicient proof even though the hurt be cause -PRON- no discomfort 
i be conscious then of a throbbing at the back of -PRON- head joke of -PRON- all be cackle the professor that the captain knock coitat zylox off the oyd car with a love letter from the princess 
that letter be impress in a block of carnelian and weigh a pound 
griffyn smile and pollock laugh outright 
i lean back against the framework of the car and wonder if i have really recover -PRON- sense 
-PRON- romance with the princess have come to a most unsatisfactory conclusion 
-PRON- heart be deeply involved and the disappointment be bitter 
prebble see how hard i take the affair knelt down beside -PRON- 
let -PRON- assure -PRON- captain say -PRON- that -PRON- be well the affair end in this way 
i shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- go on with -PRON- reason -PRON- be good that princess ylma should remain in -PRON- own land among -PRON- own people 
good for -PRON- and good for the kingdom 
the line of the boazar end with ylma 
have -PRON- bear the princess away the kingdom would indeed have have cause to consider -PRON- demon of destruction 
-PRON- may find -PRON- hard to reconcile -PRON- to the fact now but in year to come -PRON- will be glad the matter turn out as -PRON- have 
i keep -PRON- head howe in gloomy silence besides proceed prebble -PRON- have leave behind -PRON- a few good fricnd 
if the princess remam to mtercede for them7for lord nvli particularly -PRON- may console -PRON- with a wellgrounded hope that -PRON- will not suffer for arde in -PRON- escape 
then there be -PRON- word come in startled tone from griffyn 
prebble scramble to -PRON- foot and jomed griffyn who be look excitedly over the rim of the basket 
pollock also be contain -PRON- only with great diffculty 
glory cry the professor exultantly 
look captain

rom the ship 
here be something to take -PRON- mind off the amazing tangle in which -PRON- have become mvolve 
scramble erect lean on the rim of the car and look down be perhaps five hundred foot in the atr and only maintain that height by the expenditure of vast quantity of ballast 
below and a littie way to the south be dog sledge cap high with provision 
around the sledge be the eskimo and in front of the lead sledze stand the furclad man from the ship 
i recognize lieutenant corson -PRON- second in command and bentnick -PRON- doctor 
-PRON- be on the way to the ice cap say wave -PRON- hand to the startled man below 
after the eskimo get back to the ship corson lose no time in start out make a landing griffyvn -PRON- and pollock say i turn to prebble and grip -PRON- hand 
-PRON- danger be nearly over with prebble say soon be aboard ship and under the flag 
which put -PRON- a long step toward home cry the professor delightedly wonder where -PRON- ship be pollock ask griffyn of -PRON- secretary 
heaven know

-PRON- may need -PRON- testimony to substantiate -PRON- claim 
-PRON- can help -PRON- there 
-PRON- catch the valve cord 
stand at the edge of the basket i watch while -PRON- settle slowly toward the gleam plain of white 
almost that princess ylma be beside -PRON- and almost i could hear -PRON- voice give -PRON- final message -PRON- be quite true captain i be with -PRON- and shall always be with -PRON-

i mean to get up with yon craft before nightfall if -PRON- fetch -PRON- stick out 
dale nod but order new tackle bend onto the weather rig and the sheet flatten a little so as to take the strain from the bending spar 
the excitement be intense 
not a man on board the ship but be eager for a brush with the british vessel if indeed -PRON- be british 
-PRON- will teach the beggar a lesson quoth old bill cuff the boatswain to a group of -PRON- mate who have gather about -PRON- to glean from -PRON- fig the veteran opinion of the chance there be of a scrimmage when -PRON- overhaul the two big vessel ahead 
the latter seem to be under no particular apprehension though -PRON- must have long since sight the little yankee squadron 
as jone have say -PRON- be two of the leviathan threedecker of the english navy 
as -PRON- stand about in the bright sunlight the flash atlantic wave heel -PRON- over till -PRON- show -PRON- copper 
both of -PRON- sport three row of port a side 
-PRON- seem madness on the part of the young american commander to pit -PRON- tiny fleet against two such formidable fighting machine but as the british have learn to -PRON- cost -PRON- take more than heavy odd against -PRON- to deter the young sea eagle as people have already begin to call -PRON- from face -PRON- country foe 
hurrah exclaim the young ensign -PRON- be in for a fight sure

at this juncture a strange interruption occur in the shape of an exceedingly fat and exceedingly black negro who be project from the door of the galley with a force that suggest that -PRON- movement be not entirely voluntary 
the ship be heel over to the ever stiffening breeze till -PRON- lee scupper be all awash 
the unfortunate cook for such be the office of thedarky who have just emerge from the little galley hold in -PRON- hand a large kid of steam pea soup which be destine for the men dinner 
-PRON- have intend to carry -PRON- forward but as -PRON- cross the threshold of -PRON- domain the ship give a lurch and the negro give a yell as -PRON- feel -PRON- and -PRON- savory burden be gradually impel toward the boiling puddle of the scupper 
scipio seem to be in trouble say dale as -PRON- eye light on the struggle darky 
the word have hardly leave -PRON- lip before a second chocolatecolore face be poke out of the galley door and a second portly senegambian go staggering to the aid of -PRON- unfortunate fellow cook 
old bill cuff see -PRON- predicament 
sink -PRON- if -PRON- feller ainot go to let the crew dinner go to feed the fish -PRON- angrily exclaim as the two darkie wildly gesticulate be force nearer and ever nearer to the seething scupper 
the old bosun be a man of action and -PRON- do not waste any time on mere word but plunge gallantly to the rescue of the two struggle cook

ef yer spill that thar soup ye black idjut brain yer with this fist 
with these word -PRON- shake thatformidable member at the already terrify negro 
unfortunately for -PRON- dignified demeanor however the ship at the same moment give an unusually violent lurch and the old boatswain be send spin straight against the man to whom -PRON- have be hand out -PRON- admonition 
the two holder of the soup kid give vent to a howl of dismay as -PRON- see the burly form of the old sailor hurtle toward -PRON- with the speed and force of a projectile 
cuff -PRON- see long before -PRON- actually happen that a collision be inevitable unless one or the other of the negro sheer off 
hard over ye lubber -PRON- yell with -PRON- storm voice as -PRON- be pleased to call the stentorian tone with which -PRON- wasin the habit of call the watch on a rough night 
the wretched negro obey -PRON- instruction literally 
-PRON- obedience however be involuntary for the massive body of the old man reel with all the force that a fresh lurch of the plunging ship impart to -PRON- full against -PRON- 
man and soup go slide into the boiling mass of water in the lee scupper 
cuff be on -PRON- foot in a moment and stand painstakingly wipe the soup out of -PRON- grizzle whisker with one hand while -PRON- wrathfully shake the other at the two halfdrowned darkie 
bad luck to -PRON- -PRON- leatherskinne son of ham -PRON- roar

jone and -PRON- young officer be watch the scene from the forecastle head and the young commander when -PRON- have recover from -PRON- first amusement take pity on the misfortune of the two negro who have be take to sea by -PRON- from the plantaion -PRON- own in virginia in order to satisfy the craving -PRON- have express to see de mighty oshun 
many a time since tjie vengeance and -PRON- two consort have sail -PRON- have regret -PRON- rash step and now be look forward in terror to the day when -PRON- would smell powder for the first time 
as -PRON- hasten back to the galley to carry out the furious order jone hail the boatswain 
-PRON- be punish enough mr cuff -PRON- say as seriously as -PRON- could 
besides i have work on hand for -PRON- elsewhere than in the galley 
the vengeance be by this time separate from the two britistuwar vessel by a little over half a mile 
this space -PRON- be rapidly cover 
half an hour more would lay -PRON- alongside the two great craft 
jone face be light up with the eager look peculiar to -PRON- when the young commander be about to go into action 
with flash eye -PRON- feel the hilt of the magnificent sword present to -PRON- by loui of france mean to attack -PRON- ask dale or shall -PRON- try and show -PRON- a clean pair of heel jone turn on -PRON- almost angrily

but -PRON- be undoubtedly not alone the rest of the fleet be somewhere about and -PRON- would be madness to engage the entire force of the british 
-PRON- duty lie plainly before -PRON- 
dale 
will -PRON- order the signal man to inform the palla and the concord that -PRON- will engage the enemy and -PRON- blake lie aft and have the port battery clear for action 
the two officer hasten to obey 
-PRON- be none too soon to put the ship in fight trim for the next moment a puff of smoke from the side of the hindmost of the english ship and the scream of the ball as -PRON- pass over -PRON- head warn -PRON- of the hostile nature of the two stranger even if -PRON- have not be inform of -PRON- nationality by the display of the british naval flag 
shall -PRON- give -PRON- to -PRON- back si ask jimmy who have get -PRON- battery in fight shape and be eager for a chance to show what -PRON- carefully train gunner could do 
not yet reply jone -PRON- would simply be waste powder and shot and -PRON- can not afford to do that 
-PRON- intend to reserve -PRON- fire then ask dale present yes 
-PRON- will wear round tothe windward of -PRON- and then show -PRON- tooth that will give -PRON- a distinct advantage 
the other nod and seem about to say something but -PRON- be interrupt by a wail of anguish from the two negro 
massa jone cry scipio be -PRON- a fac sah dat -PRON- intend to fight with -PRON- two big ship jone nod 
then fo de sake massa i have ter giv -PRON- notice an mus respectfully request tq be put on dry lan once more be afraid that be impossible scipio

as far as be possible out of sight yes sah massa jone dat be a solid fac 
then down with -PRON- into the forecastle 
this ship be no place for two such coward as -PRON- be 
dat may be true sah but i be teach by -PRON- ole mammy in good ole virginia dat -PRON- be a great deal better fo folk to say dar -PRON- go dan dar -PRON- lay 
despite -PRON- disgust jone could not refrain from laugh as the two woollyheade coward disappear down the forecastle hatch 
there be no time however to exchange word on any other topic than the business in hand 
the vengeance be now close enough to the rear frigate to read -PRON- name benbozv which be display in gorgeous scrollwork on -PRON- rounded stern 
this be the vessel command by capt hawksdale who have swear to rid the sea of jone or sink -PRON- own vessel in the attempt 
jone be well aware of thisboast for during -PRON- visit in france -PRON- have be inform of the bitter enmity the british captain cherish toward -PRON- 
as -PRON- recognize -PRON- enemys vessel the battle light come into -PRON- face 
the line about -PRON- mouth set and harden and a steely glint come into -PRON- eye 
-PRON- be the face of a fighting man 
show -PRON- the rattlesnake -PRON- order curtly and a moment later the famous standard of the coiled rattlesnake be float from the peak of the gallant yankee vessel 
the palla and -PRON- companion follow suit and a fullthroate american cheer be bear over the wave as the emblem of liberty be display 
the british vessel reply with a volley of musket ball that do no more harm than to plow up the deck 
-PRON- have the effect however of arouse the american crew to a state of fury 
the scoundrel roar old bill cuff squint along the polished barrel of the wickedlooke bow chaser 
the old man be an expert gunner and jone have intrust to -PRON- the task of wing the great threedecke frigate so that -PRON- would be at the mere of the broadside 
at last jone give the longexpecte signal 
let -PRON- have -PRON- -PRON- say to the boatswain 
cuff step back a foot or two and wait lanyard in hand till the vengeance come up on an even keel cut -PRON- maintop in half if -PRON- can cuff cried jone eagerly 
every eye on board jone vessel be on the old man as -PRON- jerk the lanyard 
the gun speak and the deadly missile screech through the air 
the ball speed through the rigging of the britisher and part some of -PRON- maintop hamper but the spar -PRON- be untouched 
miss by thunder exclaimed bill wipe the smoke from -PRON- eye with the back of -PRON- hand 
at the same moment the britisher wear round an evo lution in which -PRON- be follow by -PRON- sister ship 
signal the other that -PRON- will tackle the benbow ex claim jone turn to the signal master -PRON- must hold the attention of the other threedecker while -PRON- engage 
the signal man break out the bunting and the brig and the little put -PRON- helm up and head for the consort 
jone -PRON- take the wheel of the vengeance and jam -PRON- up into the wind till -PRON- have the britisher on -PRON- weather quarter 
fortunately the vengeance be what be know to sail or as a weatherly craft and -PRON- could hug the breeze a good two point further up than the big threedecker which as be the way of -PRON- type show a wake almost as broad as a county 
the sailing quality of jone ship bring -PRON- up where -PRON- could rake -PRON- foe with deadly effect 
the young commander stand on -PRON- quarterdeck in -PRON- battlestained uniform and watch the movement of the threedecker intently through the telescope 
when the foresail of the vengeance begin to shiver as -PRON- take the wind over -PRON- bow -PRON- order -PRON- to bear down on the huge foe that be now flounder about like some agitated leviathan 
the reason of -PRON- dilemma be that -PRON- captain have attempt to follow jone evolution and have only sue ceede in get -PRON- ship into iron 
that be that -PRON- be jam up into the wind till -PRON- point right at the blow 
this have the effect of set -PRON- all aback and -PRON- lie helpless for a moment till -PRON- people could swing -PRON- great main topsail about 
jone be quick to see -PRON- advantage and act on -PRON- 
fire 
the command be pass from the poop deck to the region below where in the light of the battle lantern the crew strip to the waist and barefoote be ram home the deadly content of the starboard broadside 
a sheet of flame and smoke belch from the side and -PRON- tremble from stern to stempost as the gun discharge -PRON- deadly hail 
jone spring into the lee rig as the smoke blow out over the sea and eagerly observe the effect of -PRON- assault 
the telescope show -PRON- that -PRON- broadside have severely cripple the britisher but owe to the great height of -PRON- side the shot have for the most part strike -PRON- too low to inflict as much damage as would have be the case have -PRON- be rake along the deck 
-PRON- be at this moment that the accident dale have dread take place 
as the yankee ship after pour in the broadside be put before the wflnd the main topmast backstay part with the report of a cannon 
instantly the sail tear the spar of the main topmast clean out of -PRON- stepping and in a moment everything aloft be in a terrible muddle 
the man at the helm let -PRON- pay off in order to save the foremast for have that spar part -PRON- would have be at the mercy of -PRON- foe as much as if -PRON- be aboard a helpless wreck 
the moment be the opportunity for which the benboiv have be wait 
at the same time as jone ship have meet with -PRON- disaster the british ship have be ease and -PRON- prune broadside now threaten the brave little vengeance 
a perfect volcano break from -PRON- three gun tier and the deck of the yankee ship be sweep as though by a tornado under the storm of shell and grapeshot that hurtle about -PRON- 
the little craft be riddle from stem to stern and -PRON- rig cut to shred by the chain shoot with which some of the british gun have be load 
the already strain mast snap like wooden knit6 te needle as the stay part and the fall timber and block convert the deck already strew with the dead and die into a veritable shamble 
amid the confusion jone and dale with jimmy and old bill cuff alone remain calm 
the scene be enough to try the nerve of the brave 
everywhere man be die or dead 
the vessel which but a moment before have be as stanch a craft as sail the sea be convert into a mere dismantle hull at the mercy of the britisher to do as -PRON- will with 
get together all the man -PRON- can be jone first order and cut away all this hamper 
-PRON- ainot much good muttered old bill cuff as -PRON- sound -PRON- boatswain pipe to which however not more than a dozen man answer -PRON- be as good as dead already 
after the mass of rig and spar that have float alongside have be cut away by the crew axe the vessel be find to be fast sinking 
at the same moment jimmy utter a cry and point to the threedecker 
-PRON- have go about after -PRON- deadly broadside and be now bear directly down on the dismantle hull 
what can -PRON- intend to do ask dale 
if -PRON- keep on -PRON- present course that question be easily answer be jone reply 
what do that mean 
that -PRON- be go to ram -PRON- and send -PRON- to the bottom never -PRON- could not be so inhuman 
why not 
this be war and -PRON- be deal with a foe -PRON- be determined to crush out at all hazard 
-PRON- will stop at nothing to accomplish -PRON- purpose 
this be fiendish exclaimed jimmy 
be there no way -PRON- can save -PRON- if -PRON- carry out the plan -PRON- think -PRON- have 
dale ask the question 
-PRON- be a brave man as brave as could be find on the high sea but there be something terrible to -PRON- in the thought of be send to the bottom without have a chance to strike a blow in -PRON- own defense 
if -PRON- could have die fight -PRON- would have meet -PRON- death as would -PRON- two companion without a tremor 
jone think jtfor a moment -PRON- eye fix on the fast advance threedecker as -PRON- ponder 
there be a way -PRON- say at length but -PRON- be such a desperate resort that i be afraid -PRON- will not care to adopt -PRON- 
what be -PRON- 
why when the crash come -PRON- must spring into -PRON- main chain and swarm onto -PRON- deck 
-PRON- be only change -PRON- mode of death 
possibly but while there be life there be hope and i mean to make the attempt 
paul jone -PRON- be a brave man 
to avoid death 
i donot think so that be an instinct even with animal 
-PRON- must take care to keep -PRON- pistol dry for -PRON- shall have plenty of work for both -PRON- and -PRON- cutlass when -PRON- get on the british deck 
the man who remain of the crew be call aft and the plan explain to -PRON- 
-PRON- all agree to stand by -PRON- officer and fight to the death rather than be send to davy 
jone in -PRON- riddled hulk 
there be no doubt now of the plan 
straight down on the doomed yankee bear the leviathan hull of the threedecker drive at tremendous speed by -PRON- great spread of canvas 
-PRON- be draw so near by now that the man on the batter vengeance could almost hear the swish of -PRON- forefoot as -PRON- cut through the sea 
a shudder pass through more than one of the man on the bloody deck as -PRON- think that ere long the keen stem would have cut the hulk -PRON- float on sheer in half 
-PRON- be at this moment that paul jone leave the deck and disappear down the after companion 
-PRON- be not miss for several moment in the general confusion that reign at the time 
the young commander swing -PRON- easily down the companion stairway till -PRON- reach the alleyway lead to the powder magazine 
-PRON- wrench one of the smoking battle lantern from the wall and tear off a strip of -PRON- shirt wet -PRON- in a pail of water which stand near the magazine door and then spread powder on the dampen linen 
then -PRON- listen intently 
above the groan of the dying that make the ship hideous lie hear a warning cry from the deck 
the moment have come 
quickly -PRON- thrust the strip of linen which be to serve as a fuse into the flame of the lantern 
-PRON- make a capital fuse and -PRON- trust -PRON- sputter and glow into the magazine 
then -PRON- turn and run quickly to the deck 
-PRON- be not a moment too soon 
right above the smoking batter hull of the little vengeance tower the huge black shape of the threedecker 
from the low elevation of the little craft the britisher seem to tower like a mountain 
stand by cried jone as the huge sheer bow be right upon -PRON- 
stand by be echo among the devoted little yankee band 
the next moment there be a rend crash as the bowsprit of the britisher tear -PRON- way through what be leftof the top hamper 
as the bobstay of the leviathan sweep over dieir head the man on the deck of the vengeance reach up and seize -PRON- 
several of -PRON- catch the stay and hang for a moment suspend over the rend timber of the ship that have bear -PRON- so long and so faithfully ere -PRON- swarm into the main chain 
tone -PRON- make a spring for the port channel and soon join -PRON- follower in -PRON- effort to reach the deck of the big threedecker 
before the british crew which be mass on the bow of the war ship to witness the destruction of the audacious yankee be aware of what have happen jone and -PRON- man stand or -PRON- forecastle and with draw sword and pistol drive furiously at the johnny bull 
the rather stolid crew of the britisher be so completely take off -PRON- guard that -PRON- be some moment before -PRON- collect -PRON- wit sufficiently to rally and make some resistance to the bold yankee 
by this time the rest of the britisher that be to say the few that have be leave on the poop when the britisher make -PRON- swoop on the poor vengeance have rush to the aid of -PRON- comrade 
-PRON- be too late though to stop the furious swoop of the american who with paul jone wave -PRON- sword high above -PRON- head in the lead have dash right through the group on the forecastle and be now well amidship 
-PRON- cost hard fighting to gain this position and -PRON- number be sensibly decrease in the desperate sortie 
-PRON- can not hold out if -PRON- rally and attack -PRON- in a body dale be say when -PRON- word be cut short by a roar that seem to rend the very sky 
at the same moment there be a blind flash of light as if a thunderbolt have be launch in -PRON- midst and -PRON- be throw flat on -PRON- face by some superlative force 
at the same time the entire forward part of the british war ship be hoist skyward and the air be dark with the rain of shatter timber and dismember human body 
as soon as -PRON- be able after the shock the american struggle to -PRON- foot and gaze about -PRON- daze for a moment at the suddenness of the whole affair 
dale be the first to guess what have happen 
-PRON- fire the magazine of the vengeance -PRON- say to jone 
the young commodore nod 
there be a look of triumph on -PRON- face as -PRON- do so 
-PRON- plan bad succeed beyond -PRON- wildest expectation 
of -PRON- late enemy not more than half a dozen remain and these be huddle forward in a frightened group eye the yankee as if -PRON- be some sort of supernatural being 
-PRON- offer no resistance to jone when -PRON- order -PRON- to be imprison in the forward deckhouse but huddle into -PRON- prison like a herd of frightened sheep 
the smoke hang so heavily over the scene that jone be unable despite -PRON- anxiety to see how the palla and -PRON- consort be fare 
suddenly through the dense fog of powder fume a voice sound 
vast -PRON- british lubber -PRON- hail 
by heaven -PRON- have tackle a genuine yankee sailor this trip and if -PRON- come one step nearer blow some of -PRON- to kingdom come 
the voice have a familiar ring 
-PRON- be that of old bill cuff 
in the excitement of the moment no one have miss -PRON- and -PRON- fill -PRON- heart with joy to think that -PRON- old shipmate be safe and sound 
-PRON- hail -PRON- back and in another moment -PRON- be all shake hand on the battlescarred deck of the britisher 
a puff of wind send the smoke which have hang over -PRON- till now like a pall stream out to leeward 
at what be reveal when -PRON- full vision be restore to -PRON- every man on that deck give a cry 
the sea be within a few foot of the vessel main deck 
-PRON- be evident that the ship be take on water fast and have only a short time to live 
-PRON- be in the most desperate situation that can confront a mariner 
paul jone and -PRON- man be alone on the shatter deck of a sink ship 
anxiously -PRON- cast -PRON- gaze about the ship 
-PRON- vigilance be barren of result however for -PRON- boat hang shatter in the davit 
jone cast a sweeping glance about -PRON- 
down to windward hang a heavy cloud of smoke 
in the midst of -PRON- -PRON- could not doubt be the two remain ship of -PRON- squadron 
what -PRON- fate be the cloud of battle do not enable -PRON- to ascertain but -PRON- have every confidence in commander crawford and biddle and know that -PRON- be give a good account of -PRON- 
although the situation do indeed seem hopeless jone be not the man to let the grass grow under -PRON- foot 
at any time and particularly in moment that would have seem to other man -PRON- last -PRON- bold spirit rise to the emergency and have many time turn defeat into victory 
there be no boat as -PRON- see -PRON- say turn to dale 
no be the reply -PRON- seem -PRON- doom be seal 
not at all 
there be still a chance chance 
yes though -PRON- have no boat -PRON- can build a raft stout enough to hold -PRON- till either the palla or the concord see -PRON- and pick -PRON- up 
this put new hope into the little party and -PRON- set to work to collect a number of plank that seem suitable for -PRON- purpose 
these be lash as securely as -PRON- time limit would allow to a number of empty barrel which would give the raft buoyancy in the water 
-PRON- preparation complete jone throw in a keg of water and a bag of hard sea biscuit 
-PRON- would have stock -PRON- frail craft with more water for -PRON- do not know how long -PRON- may be before -PRON- be pick up but time press 
the last preparation be barely complete when the ship give a sicken lurch 
for a brief second those on board think that -PRON- last moment have come but with a brave effort the die ship right -PRON- 
-PRON- be now so deep in the water that to launch the raft over the side be an easy matter 
a faint cheer rang out from the yankee as the wretched contrivance slip into the water -PRON- be very faint though for not a man who step aboard -PRON- but realize that -PRON- may be go to -PRON- death 
as -PRON- shove off from the side of the sink ship dale cast a swift glance round the horizon 
far to windward there be a faint outline of purple mist lie like a veil over the blue water 
the first luff gaze at this for some moment with a troubled expression on -PRON- face 
-PRON- seem that -PRON- scent trouble in the dim filmy mass 
if -PRON- do however -PRON- say nothing to -PRON- companion none of whom seem to have notice the appearance that have cause a shadow to rest on -PRON- brow 
at this moment -PRON- reflection be cut short by a wild cry from the deckhouse of the sink ship 
-PRON- have forget the imprison british sailor 
-PRON- plea to be take off be pitiful 
without a moment hesitation jone who have the key of the place plunge into the sea 
with swift strong stroke -PRON- have reach the side of the sinking britisher almost before -PRON- companion have have time to guess what -PRON- be about to attempt 
seize a dangle piece of rope -PRON- swing -PRON- easily to the deserted deck and race for the deckhouse 
the cry of the poor creature within be pitiful 
shoot -PRON- if -PRON- will -PRON- cry but for pitys sake do not leave -PRON- to drown like rat in a trap come to save -PRON- cry joneg as -PRON- turn the key and fling the door back 
the deck be tremble with the vessel last throe as the man rush out 
swim for -PRON- life for the raft shout jone -PRON- be go down 
-PRON- all plunge into the water and make for the raft 
all that be but some half dozen who be unable to swim 
one of these a fairhaire young fellow of slender build jone help to the raft 
this man be the only one -PRON- be able to save 
the other sink like lead after a few struggle 
pull for all -PRON- be worth or -PRON- shall be catch in the undertow cry dale as soon as -PRON- leader and the rescue man be safe on board a sink ship create a whirlpool into which everything afloat in -PRON- immediate neighborhood be draw admonition be timely 
as -PRON- speak the stern of the threedecker raise high in the air and then with a noise like the rend apart of huge timber -PRON- sink forever 
those on the raft have little time to watch the spectacle for -PRON- be keep busy scull -PRON- out of the undertow 
the man whom jone have rescue gaze at the sinking derelict with horrified eye 
but for -PRON- -PRON- say to jone should be go to -PRON- grave with the other poor fellow 
who be i to thank for -PRON- rescue -PRON- name be paul jone be the quiet reply 
the fellow start back as if strike by lightning 
paul jone -PRON- exclaim 
why -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- kill every englishman and give no quarter to -PRON- foe 
-PRON- give quarter but -PRON- never ask -PRON- be the curt reply 
speak like the brave man i now believe -PRON- be 
i be the second lieutenant of yon illfated craft -PRON- name be charle harkness at -PRON- service capt jone and can i ever reciprocate -PRON- noble act i will do so 
thank -PRON- say jone be sure that -PRON- will 
-PRON- be interrupt by a cry from dale who for some time past have not remove -PRON- eye from the filmy cloud that have first attract -PRON- attention when -PRON- be put off from the ship 
the fog -PRON- cry 
unless -PRON- can make the palla or the concord before -PRON- be on -PRON- -PRON- be lose 
there be a note in -PRON- tone that give no doubt of the seriousness of -PRON- position 
the man pull with all -PRON- strength for the two vessel which be still fight the other britisher 
the raft be a clumsy contrivance however and despite -PRON- effort the fog curtain roll over the darken sea toward -PRON- till -PRON- be wrap in -PRON- soft impenetrable fold 
a -PRON- be a situation fill with horror 
-PRON- have no compass and even if -PRON- have one -PRON- would have be useless to -PRON- in the surround gloom 
occasionally -PRON- could catch the distant boom of gun which tell -PRON- in a vague way the whereabout of the other two vessel but although -PRON- pull through the dense mist as -PRON- judge in the right direction -PRON- could not seem to get any nearer 
unless the fog lift -PRON- have to face a situation that be unparalleled for sheer hopelessness 
-PRON- raft be ofthe frail and even with the great economy -PRON- slend stock of provision would not last -PRON- more than a day at most 
-PRON- shout with all the strength of -PRON- lung in the effort to attract some attention but no answer come to -PRON- hail 
at length the sound of firing begin to grow fainter and -PRON- be compel to acknowledge although the realization bring with -PRON- a chill that -PRON- be adrift on the unknown with the vessel that may have give -PRON- aid rapidly bear away from -PRON- 
what make -PRON- hard to bear be the thought that assistance have -PRON- be able to signal be so near at hand 
suddenly from out of the fog a voice answer -PRON- hail 
if -PRON- be english for de sake be mussiful an pick up two distressed mariner -PRON- moan 
another voice come from the same direction as the first chime in with -PRON- never do have no use for dat ere paul jone 
-PRON- be genlemen an prisoner till -PRON- be blow up 
now -PRON- dunno if -PRON- be alive or jes color angel 
despite -PRON- terrible situation not a man aboard the raft could forbear smile as -PRON- recognize the voice of scipio and cato have forget -PRON- exclaim jone 
well i be glad -PRON- be safe and sound for have -PRON- be sink in the vengeance i should never have forgive -PRON- 
a rift in the fog reveal to the man the raft two woolly head bob side by side up and down on the swell and hold tight to a float chicken coop 
loud ducking from the interior of the latter show -PRON- to be occupy 
the negro be soon haul on board to the intense disgust of old bill cuff who opine that there wassomethe not just all right about people who could emerge from an explosion like that of the magazine of the vengeance without further hurt than a little singed wool and a bad fright -PRON- drift helplessly about till the fade light tell -PRON- that night be come on 
with the coming of darkness a low moaning wind spring up and the sea begin to roll in a wav that make the wretched collection of plank and barrel creak ominously 
what if the raft should part 
dale whisper to jimmy 
-PRON- should have to trust tc luck to get -PRON- out of -PRON- reply jimmy 
there be another peril -PRON- shall have to face even if -PRON- do escape from the raft what be that 
why -PRON- know these water be alive with british vessel and i suspect that the two -PRON- encounter be simply straggler from the main body 
-PRON- position would indeed be serious if -PRON- fall into the hand of the british 
especially if -PRON- find out that -PRON- have sink one of -PRON- fine ship 
see 
-PRON- look as if this measly fog be go to lift at last 
the rise wind have indeed drive away the fog mass in heavy swirl of vapor that stream far out to leeward like strip of veil 
from behind the driving mass a sickly moon shine out and feebly illumine the heaving waste of water 
the man on the raft gaze eagerly about 
toward every point of the compass -PRON- look 
the result be bitter disappointment 
not a trace of a sail be to be see 
as far as the eye could reach the sea be empty save for the frail and hurriedly put together raft that float a mere speck on the desert of water with -PRON- burden of humanity 
jone approach dale old friend -PRON- say -PRON- have need of all -PRON- courage now for this ip something very different from the excite inent of battle 
true -PRON- mean day and perhaps week of impotent suffering 
day perhaps -PRON- forget that -PRON- can not by any possibility survive for more than a week 
trite and even then -PRON- will not dwell on -PRON- but hope for the good 
now some have well lie down and try to sleep 
the man on the raft lie down on -PRON- frail support of plank and close -PRON- eye 
not one of -PRON- sleep however 
-PRON- thought be busy with various thing far remove from the waste of deserted water that surround -PRON- 
toward morning slumber mercifully visit some of -PRON- 
when dale awake -PRON- see 
jone stand by a make shift mast -PRON- and old cuff have rig up with the aid of one of the oar 
the young commander be eagerly gaze all about -PRON- 
the eastern horizon be dye a delicate pink with the first heral ding of the come day and under the fresh light of dawn the heave desert of salt water show as desolate as though the keel of man have never plow -PRON- 
-PRON- see nothing sir ask dale 
jone shake -PRON- head 
the moaning of one of the man who have be wound strike on -PRON- ear 
water water -PRON- moan 
jone nod with a significant look at the tiny keg of the precious fluid dale know what -PRON- mean at once 
there be hardly enough water to last -PRON- the day 
jone stoop over the wounded man and let -PRON- drink -PRON- fill 
-PRON- be later in the day that the other arouse -PRON- for -PRON- all feel that -PRON- be well to drowse away the hour till -PRON- should be rescue than to suffer the agony of wake suspense 
toward noon jone make a distribution of biscuit and water 
-PRON- eat and drink with avidity 
-PRON- be hour since any of -PRON- have do either 
as the sun rise higher the glare from the water dazzle -PRON- eye and the heat increase till some of the sailor begin to clamor for more water 
man say jone address -PRON- -PRON- be sll in a terrible position and whether -PRON- shall ever get out of -PRON- i know not 
that be in the hand of providence 
of one thing however i can assure -PRON- the first man catch steal ater will be shoot 
that be all -PRON- say but -PRON- have the effect of calm the man down and -PRON- endure in silence till sunset when a second distribution be make 
jone -PRON- take less than anyone 
the british officer notice this and offer to forego -PRON- own share but jone would not hear of -PRON- 
-PRON- be about midnight when jimmv arise from a trou bleed sleep and gaze about -PRON- make out a form by the water cask ri -PRON- be one of the rescue british sailor and -PRON- be in the act of repay -PRON- savior by filch from -PRON- scanty supply of water 
jimmy be on -PRON- in an instant 
a quick backward wrench of -PRON- hand send the fellow sprawling 
-PRON- be up in a minute though and jimmy catch the gleam of a knife in -PRON- hand as -PRON- come at -PRON- 
there be no time for the young ensign to draw -PRON- weapon 
the only thing to do be to grapple with the man 
as -PRON- close jimmy feel a sharp pain in -PRON- shoulder as though a redhot iron have be plunge into -PRON- 
the britisher have use -PRON- steel to good effect 
but -PRON- have not calculate on the strength of the young american 
with all -PRON- might jimmy grasp the man wrist and bend -PRON- slowly back till -PRON- be on -PRON- knee 
then drop that knife 
the blade ring to the deck 
now look here say jimmy to -PRON- now helpless antagonist will spare -PRON- life this time but if ever -PRON- attempt such a thing again i shall shoot -PRON- like the dog -PRON- be 
the fellow answer not a word but slink over to the side of the raft on which -PRON- companion lie and be soon wrap in apparent slumber 
jimmy examine the spigot of the water keg 
-PRON- turn -PRON- slightly so as to see if the british sailor have tamper with -PRON- 
as -PRON- hand meet the spigot -PRON- hear a loud shout behind -PRON- 
-PRON- be the man -PRON- have just wrest the knife from 
the young ensign be about to order the fellow away when -PRON- shout at the top of -PRON- voice here -PRON- be 
here be the fellow who steal the water while -PRON- be asleep 
in a second everyone on the raft be wide awake and jimmy face a score of accuse eye 
even jone be tempt for a moment to believe in the young ensign guilt but one glance into the lad face and the ring of -PRON- voice as -PRON- exclaim a lie convince jone that -PRON- young ensign be guiltless of the base act of which -PRON- be accuse 
what have -PRON- to say about this -PRON- demand sternly of the english sailor a sinisterlooke fellow the low part of whose face be envelop in a huge red beard 
-PRON- small eye dance with hatred -PRON- point at jimmy as -PRON- reply see -PRON- do -PRON- 
a sensation run through the man on the raft 
if a trusted officer be to be detect in the act of steal some of the precious water in whom could -PRON- place any reliance 
jimmy say jone sorrowfully be afraid -PRON- look pretty black against -PRON- -PRON- boy 
-PRON- know when -PRON- all awake -PRON- be by the keg and be in the act of turn the spigot

capt jone exclaim the young ensign -PRON- be make a horrible mistake 
surely surely -PRON- can not think that i have do this thing 
jimmy boy -PRON- look black against -PRON-

-PRON- could not trust -PRON- to speak 
deep confidence as -PRON- have in the lad -PRON- could not doubt but that torture by the thirst that be begin to torment -PRON- all the expowd monkey have be unable to resist the craving 
jimmy bury -PRON- face in -PRON- hand donot mind the penalty commander -PRON- say bitterly for if -PRON- doubt -PRON- there be not much use in -PRON- living but -PRON- should know that i be not a liar 
jimmy -PRON- would all be too glad to believe -PRON- but what be -PRON- do by that water keg 
that i have tell -PRON- once 
that be all the explanation -PRON- have to offer -PRON- be 
the english sailor break into a brutal laugh 
-PRON- voting life will be snuff out anyhow -PRON- remark to a comrade near -PRON- 
not just yet say a clear ringing voice as lieut 
harkness stride up to jone 
all stare at the english officer sudden interruption 
jone look at -PRON- interrogatively 
-PRON- have evidence point to the guilty party -PRON- ask

who be -PRON- there -PRON- stand the britisher point to the sailor who have accuse jimmy 
why do yen not speak before do not dream that matter be go to turn out so seriously besides be unwilling to see a countryman convict of such a base act but i be force to believe the evidence of -PRON- own eye when i see that man drink e from the spigot of the water butt 
a terrible change have come over the face of the bearded sailor as -PRON- officer have speak 
-PRON- florid feature be overspread with a sickly gray 
jone speak to -PRON- sharply 
come here 
the fellow shuffle over to the young commander 
what have -PRON- to say to this charge a lie 
the tone in which -PRON- say -PRON- be enough to convict the man of falsehood but jone let -PRON- go a little further 
-PRON- mean -PRON- be not at the water keg at all that be what i mean yes do not believe -PRON- 
there be stain of water on the front of -PRON- shirt 
the fellow look down in terror 
yes there -PRON- be beyond a doubt 
several wet stain of the water that have dribble from -PRON- mouth as -PRON- drink and -PRON- make a damn piece of evidence against -PRON- 
jone face grow hard as steel as -PRON- look at the cringing creature before -PRON- 
-PRON- hate a sneak and above a sneak -PRON- abhor a liar 
the man who face -PRON- be both 
-PRON- turn to jimmy 
give -PRON- -PRON- pistol 
jimmy blanched 
the fate -PRON- would not have hesitate to face -PRON- -PRON- could not bear to be instrumental in bring on another 
jone see -PRON- hesitation 
come jimmy -PRON- say -PRON- can not save the man by refuse -PRON- -PRON- weapon 
but -PRON- surely do not mean to shoot -PRON- 
as if -PRON- be a dog 
do -PRON- think of the life that depend on that water when -PRON- try to steal -PRON- jimmy be force to admit the justice of jone argu ment 
without another word -PRON- hand -PRON- the pistol 
jone point -PRON- at the shrink wretch in front of -PRON- 
if youliave anything to say speak now -PRON- say 
the sailor break into a torrent of blasphemy 
jone check -PRON- 
do not revile in -PRON- last moment -PRON- say 
the only answer be another burst of profanity then before jone could put -PRON- on guard the frenzied man leap full at -PRON- and bury -PRON- finger in -PRON- throat 
if i be to die by heaven -PRON- go with -PRON- lie shriek in the tone of a madman 
the fury of -PRON- assault send jone stagger backward toward the edge of the raft 
in another moment -PRON- be both struggle in the water 
there be an old saying that there be no enemy as dan gerous as a desperate coward 
jone struggle with all -PRON- might to free -PRON- but the fellow finger sunk deeper into -PRON- flesh 
-PRON- feel -PRON- sense leave -PRON- as completely exhaust -PRON- make a last effort to wrest -PRON- from the madman grasp 
for the first few second after the two man have go over the side jimmy and the other have stand paralyzed with amazement at the affair 
as the young ensign see the difficulty -PRON- commander be in however -PRON- require only the work of a moment for -PRON- to plunge into the water to the rescue 
-PRON- throw -PRON- arm about the throat of jone assailant as the latter be about to sink for the last time and force -PRON- back 
as -PRON- head be wrench round the fellow release -PRON- death grip on jone throat and turn -PRON- attention to jimmy do for -PRON- anyway -PRON- pup -PRON- hiss as -PRON- strive to grasp the boy windpipe i3 but jimmy be on -PRON- guard 
-PRON- force -PRON- arm under the other chin and together -PRON- sink 
jimmy be too experience a hand in the water not to have take a good lungful of air before -PRON- go under 
the other however have not and when -PRON- once more shoot to the surface jimmy feel the form of the treacherous fellow limp in -PRON- arm 
-PRON- feel -PRON- heart 
-PRON- have stop beat 
the man lip too be blue about the comer 
-PRON- be dead beyond a doubt 
nevertheless the man on the raft work over -PRON- to try and fan some faint spark of vitality to life but at the end of an hour -PRON- see that -PRON- effort be useless 
-PRON- be sundown of -PRON- second day on the raft that -PRON- consign the body to the deep 
shortly after -PRON- take -PRON- last drink from the keg and eat the last biscuit 
if help do not come shortly -PRON- be doom man 
all that night -PRON- sit up on -PRON- frail float platform and some of -PRON- pray that aid would come before death claim -PRON- 
dawn however show -PRON- the same monotonous level of rolling water without a sail to break the loneliness of the heaving waste 
-PRON- speak but little 
man in -PRON- position have little to say for each be busy with -PRON- own thought 
the wounded man groan in -PRON- pain and implore -PRON- to give -PRON- a drop of water to moisten -PRON- parched throat 
-PRON- dare not tell -PRON- that the water be all go but with the strange intuition that come sometimes to the dying -PRON- sit upright and point -PRON- finger at the keg scream -PRON- have drink -PRON- all -PRON- curse thief 
-PRON- mean to leave -PRON- to die without a drop to ease -PRON- last hour 
-PRON- be terrible to hear -PRON- raving as -PRON- call down curse on the head of the man who as -PRON- think have deprive -PRON- of -PRON- share of the precious fluid 
at last lie raise -PRON- up and try to drag -PRON- wounded body to the keg 
the effort be too much for -PRON- and -PRON- fall exhausted halfway 
-PRON- let -PRON- lie there until jone see -PRON- position and tenderly lift -PRON- back onto the pile of canvas that serve -PRON- as a pillow 
toward evening a tiny cloud appear on the horizon 
-PRON- spread with the rapidity of an ink spot on blot paper and soon the whole heaven be overcast with a sooty pall of dark cloud 
the castaway hail this with expression of thankfulness 
-PRON- mean the one thing that may yet save -PRON- livesrain 
presently a few heavy drop fall 
-PRON- turn -PRON- face with -PRON- mouth open eagerly up to the sky that -PRON- may not miss a drop of the bless moisture -PRON- must catch some of this downpour and save -PRON- say tone who realize that -PRON- may still have many day of suffering to face ere a ship or death put an end to -PRON- misery 
the canvas from beneath the wound man head be spread so as to catch as much of the rain as possible 
-PRON- leak like a sieve and when the shower cease only a few minute after -PRON- have begin there be not more than a quart of dirty water to show for -PRON- pain 
one of the sailor step up to jone 
be -PRON- go to serve out that water now sir -PRON- ask respectfully enough yet with a note in -PRON- voice that jone do not like 
-PRON- know well enough that this be to be keep for that poor fellow -PRON- say indicate the die man who have cry so beseechingly for water that day 
what -PRON- donot get none of -PRON- 
not a drop -PRON- man 
the sailor turn without a word and join -PRON- mate 
-PRON- talk together for a while in low tone 
evdn in situation such as that in which the castaway find -PRON- man will form into clique 
this be for various reason on land but among seaman there be the line that be draw between forecastle and quarterdeck that nothing not pven the prospect of a terrible death can eliminate 
so -PRON- be that the british officer be in the group comprising jone and -PRON- twoofficer not forget old bill cuff who hold -PRON- to be the equal of any quarterdeck pacer 
the crew on the other hand form a little body of -PRON- own 
-PRON- outnumber the officer two to one and be equally well armed 
mark -PRON- word captain those fellow mean mischief say dale turn to jone 
jone eye snap as -PRON- reply well if -PRON- think -PRON- be go to put tongue to that poor fellow water -PRON- be much mistaken mischief or no mischief be with -PRON- capt jone in this say the britisher hope that the fact that i be -PRON- prisoner will not prevent -PRON- from let -PRON- draw -PRON- sword on -PRON- side if -PRON- come to a tussle 
not at all reply jone 
if -PRON- do indeed intend to mutiny every sword -PRON- have will improve -PRON- chance of beat -PRON- off 
at last the sailor who have approach jone before de tache -PRON- from -PRON- fellow and once more approach the commodore 
-PRON- and -PRON- mate have be talk this thing over -PRON- say and -PRON- have decide that the living have more right to the water than a fellow what canot last more than a few hour anyway 
despite the veiled threat in the man manner jone do not lose -PRON- temper 
surely -PRON- would not have -PRON- pass -PRON- last hour torture by the agony of thirst -PRON- ask 
-PRON- donot know nothing about that 
-PRON- want -PRON- right 
well what do -PRON- wish -PRON- to do 
jone be spar for time 
-PRON- see as soon as the man speak that -PRON- be in for a fight and every moment -PRON- could avert -PRON- while -PRON- decide on some plan of action would be to -PRON- advantage 
the man leer at -PRON- insolently 
all the conventionality that mark the quarterdeck intercourse between officer and man be at an end now 
the two group of man be alone on a deserted sea on a tiny and frail raft 
-PRON- be reduce to the situation of the primitive man to whom the battle for the necessity of life be a daily occurrence 
well do -PRON- get the water 
no ypu donot question and answer rang out sharp as rifle shot 
well -PRON- mean to have -PRON- in spite of -PRON- capt paul jone 
the young commander fist shoot out like a flash and the sailor who have address -PRON- be stretch on the flooring of the raft 
-PRON- mate utter a growl of rage as -PRON- advance threateningly toward the group of officer i 
-PRON- have draw -PRON- sea knife and cutlass and present a formidable appearance compare to the group of officer who await -PRON- come calmly 
the man whom jone have knock down lay like a stone as -PRON- have fall 
this put one of -PRON- foe out of the way 
hold on man cry dale raise -PRON- hand to com mand attention have -PRON- consider what -PRON- be about to do 
this be mutiny on the high sea 
-PRON- canot frighten -PRON- with -PRON- threat growl one of the seamen not on -PRON- cursed quarterdeck now but here as man to man -PRON- mean to drive -PRON- into the sea if -PRON- donot get that water 
well then -PRON- can try to drive -PRON- into the sea but i give -PRON- fair warning that if -PRON- attack -PRON- -PRON- will show -PRON- no mercy say jone 
the man make a concerted rush at these word 
the man who have address jone rush straight at -PRON- and aim a savage sweep of -PRON- great cutless at the young commander head 
jone blow and lunging run the fellow clean through the body 
at the same moment harkness the british officer ac count for another sword be knock out of -PRON- hand and the young ensign would have fare ijadly if -PRON- have not be for old bill cuff who seize the fellow who have strike the blow by the throat and hurl -PRON- into the sea as if -PRON- have be a stone 
then the fighting grow so fast that none of the participant have time to observe the movement of the other 
-PRON- be cut and thrust for dear life 
the young britisher be wound but fight doggedly on with the courage of -PRON- race and old cuff have get a slash over the arm 
on the other hand -PRON- have account for fully half -PRON- opponent and now the officer be evenly match 
slowly -PRON- drive the mutineer back to the edge of the raft the man make a desperate sortie but -PRON- heart be go and -PRON- lose two of -PRON- number in the assault 
at last -PRON- throw down -PRON- arm and call for quarter 
jone and -PRON- officer have win 
at that moment jimmy exclaim look 
-PRON- follow -PRON- gaze and see on the horizon a white sail 
-PRON- be as yet only hull down but at the pace -PRON- be come -PRON- soon make out that -PRON- carry royal and double spencer and be a craft of great speed 
as -PRON- draw near -PRON- reveal a double row of black andwhite port and a line of bright copper be a war ship exclaim dale

-PRON- all lean forward to catch -PRON- word 
-PRON- be -PRON- majestys harpy and there on the horizon if -PRON- eye do not deceive -PRON- be two corvette and a brig of the same service

the sloop be round to and bring up with beautiful precision within a cable length of the raft 
a boat be lower and come fly through the water toward the castaway

the face of capt grimstone grow purple with rage at the calm tone of the man -PRON- be endeavor to bully 
very well sir if -PRON- do not choose to answer -PRON- question -PRON- be under no obligation to do so 
but i give -PRON- fair warning that i shall hold -PRON- equally free and order -PRON- hang at sunrise 
paul jone regard the man opposite -PRON- with steadfast gaze

then may that not be -PRON- boat the captain shake -PRON- head 
so far as i can see -PRON- be a britisher

cheer boy 
cheer for all -PRON- be worth -PRON- cry turn to the crew 
paul jone be safe and in yond boat 
a deafening break from the throat of the man at the news that -PRON- beloved commander be safe 
surely no boat be ever lower more briskly than the one that drop from the side of the palla a moment after capt crawford have recognize the young leader of the american navy 
half an hour later jone with -PRON- officer be seat in the wardroom of the palla narrate -PRON- experience with the british and receive the congratulation of high and low 
-PRON- have only drift in the boat for a day and that -PRON- have be pick up so quickly by the pallas be ac count for by the fact that the american ship have spend the time since the suppose loss of -PRON- commodore in cruise about the neighboring ocean in the hope that -PRON- may find some trace of -PRON- fate 
the day be one of general rejoicing

-PRON- account serve to fan the flame of the men hatred for the british and not a soul before the mast on either of the yankee ship but be eager to tackle the king fleet once more 
jone and -PRON- officer have decide after a consultation to head for the coast of france 
-PRON- know that the british fleet be somewhere between -PRON- and the land of gaul but -PRON- trust to the nimbleness of -PRON- wit to escape -PRON- 
from where -PRON- now lay -PRON- be a sail provide the wind hold fair of only a few day before -PRON- could reach the french coast 
to reach america on the other hand would take some week 
as -PRON- be absolutely necessary to refit -PRON- craft -PRON- be decide to run into some port on the west coast of france 
a course be accordingly lay and a few day later -PRON- enter the channel 
the english channel be at that time as -PRON- be at the present day one of the most thoroughly patrol piece of water in the world 
the yankee commander hardly expect to gpt through without encounter some british ship do police work but -PRON- hope to get by through the exercise of -PRON- native wit 
during a calm which fall when -PRON- be still some three hundred mile wet of the scilly island the man be set to work paint out the port on the side of the two yankee ship and muss up -PRON- run gear and generally smart appearance till -PRON- look like two tired old geordie home from a cruise to the west indie

from topmast to kelson -PRON- speak of discipline 
there be write to the eye of the sailor in every halyard and in the graceful set of -PRON- mast

jone wave -PRON- hand in true geordie fashion to signify that iff would obey and the topsail be swing round till the pallas be stationary 
the concord follow suit and soon the two vessel be as motionless as the frigate 
a boat come skim over the wave and a dandy young officer step superciliously up in the stem sheet -PRON- gangway -PRON- man -PRON- ask sharply -PRON- see the ladder ask jone that good enough for -PRON- -PRON- man

dale seem to be greatly pleased at -PRON- commander communication and slap -PRON- knee as -PRON- exclaim capital 
the very thing 
-PRON- spend some time at the mouth of the river lie in near the bank where -PRON- be certain of not be observe and watch the light flit over the water as the ship boat pull from one vessel of the fleet to another 
-PRON- find that the observation of the number of ship in the squadron -PRON- have make from the hill be correct 
hello say jone suddenly point to a small sloopsofwar that lie moored dose inshore that fellow have a familiar look to -PRON-

this be capt chance to get even with -PRON- for spoil -PRON- hang remark jone with a laugh as -PRON- pull back to the pallas 
may heaven grant that -PRON- disappoint -PRON- all once more say dale 
the rest of the time till midnight be spend by the yankee in transfer bag of some substance which -PRON- handle with the great care and barrel of tar and piece of canvas to the abandon schooner 
tn fact by the time the tide begin to turn -PRON- have stow away a regular cargo on -PRON- 
at midnight the tide be high and the schooner which have be fit with sail and be paint up till -PRON- look like a war ship begin to glide slowly down the river 
but one man stand on -PRON- deck 
the night be too dark to reveal -PRON- feature but -PRON- evidently be under no apprehension of the british for -PRON- loll at the wheel as the ship slide along with as much nonchalance as if -PRON- have be steer a load of garden stuff to market instead of pilot a ship down a river the mouth of which be police by the british patrol fleet a keen observer would have notice however that -PRON- do not as be the custom among sailor smoke anything 
instead -PRON- hum a tune of old virginia and the water lap against the dingy side of the rickety old craft -PRON- steer be the accompaniment 
close behind the refit schooner creep the palla and the and the big bellow 
the former be slightly in the lead 
as the man on the schooner come within sight of the british vessel -PRON- drop -PRON- nonchalant air and run swiftly forward to the stem of -PRON- old craft 
-PRON- disappear down the forescuttle from which a faint glow be presently visible 
the next moment -PRON- reappear and run swiftly to the stern plunge overboard 
-PRON- swam to the bellona whose sail have be noiselessly lower through greased fall and clamber on board by the main chain 
thank god -PRON- be back safe captain exclaim dale as -PRON- wring the hand of -PRON- commander for the man who have pilot the mysterious schooner down the river be none other than paul jone the man the british have dub the tiger of the atlantic 
thank -PRON- dale -PRON- say as -PRON- shake the water out of -PRON- clothe and now to put the second part of -PRON- plot into execution 
s as -PRON- speak there be a burst of flame from the bow of the schooner and the loud report of a gun 
how do -PRON- arrange the lanyard of the gun ask dale in amazement at the firing of the gun from the now desert schooner 
by tie a piece of rope yarn to the lanyard and the rope attach a piece of rock and throw the whole thing over the side 
when the rock in trail along the bottom strike a submerged obstacle -PRON- jerk the lanyard and fire the gun the report of the cannon have set the british fleet in an uproar 
the sitting of battle lantern about -PRON- deck show the active preparation -PRON- be make to meet paul jone for -PRON- do not doubt that the schooner be one of -PRON- fleet 
in the meantime the craft that have cause all the excitement drift silently on until -PRON- be almost abreast of the big threedecker 
then -PRON- be see to change -PRON- course and run right in between two of -PRON- because of the peculiarity of the tide 
the britisher be take aback by such boldness but -PRON- salute -PRON- with a broadside that seem as if -PRON- would blow -PRON- out of the water 
-PRON- keep right on however and before the two bulky ship could get way on -PRON- -PRON- have lock yard with -PRON- 
at the same moment a tongue of livid flame creep from -PRON- hold and lick hungrily at the mast 
then the truth burst on the british 
-PRON- be lock inextricably with a fireship 
hardly a second elapse from the time the first bluish flame have creep from the hold full of tar and oil the fireship carry before great yellow sheet of fire be shoot high into the air 
the british fight like demon to shove off from -PRON- deadly foe but -PRON- spar be already on fire and the man be leap overboard in wild terror 
high and high shoot the flame and the roar of the fierce volcano could be hear as far as the town 
the glare light up the sea as by day and in the midst of the panic that have fall on the british the sea eagle make -PRON- swoop 
out from the mouth of th river dash -PRON- three vessel 
before the british know what be happen -PRON- be upon -PRON- and hurl -PRON- deadly iron rain right and leave

the explosion send a perfect rain of flame ember and redhot bolt over the rest of the vessel 
jone ship be undamage for before go into action the sail and spar have be thoroughly wet down to avoid -PRON- catch fire from the blaze rain 
-PRON- be far otherwise with the british however 
-PRON- ship catch on fire in a dozen place at once and -PRON- crew have to leave the gun to fight the flame that threaten to destroy -PRON- 
in the thick of the inferno of flame and noise and smoke one of the great threedecker the one that have bepn undamage drift down on jone ship and open a grueling fire on -PRON- 
on the other side be jone old enemy the harpy

from both side the iron hail be hurl into -PRON- ship till -PRON- seem -PRON- must be tear apart 
the night be light up by the wild light of the burn ship and never do battlefield more resemble the infernal region than do the scene about the three vessel that lie lock together and fight handtohand 
man strip to the waist and stain with blood and powder man the gun with a frenzy bom of the desperate nature of the fight 
from time to time a man fall at -PRON- gun with the rammer in -PRON- hand and in a moment another would have snatch -PRON- up and prod the charge home 
the deck be slippery with blood and dim with smoke 
the acrid reek of burn powder be thick over everything and the smoke from the burn ship dim men eye and choke -PRON- throat 
in the midst of this inferno while the cannon belch -PRON- deadly content a chance bullet shoot down the coiled rattlesnake flag of america from the peak of the bellona 
-PRON- be paul jone -PRON- who snatch up the fall flag and springing into the shroud amid a hailstorm of bullet fasten -PRON- once more to the halyard and run -PRON- aloft 
a cheer break from the tired man at the gun as -PRON- witness the heroic deed of -PRON- young leader 
the sight of the gallant flag once more wave amid the thickhanging smoke lend the yankee fresh courage

if -PRON- donot live up to instruction that first check will be the last one leave the rest of -PRON- money to charity some home for superannuated miner and prospector if there be any such thing have thirty day to spend a hundred thousand dollar 
show -PRON- how -PRON- do -PRON- 
everybody say -PRON- be a great spender but i never learn the knack 
i stakin -PRON- to a round of pleasure now go out and make a business of bein happy want -PRON- to be a gentleman about -PRON- i know -PRON- be an honest soul and that -PRON- have a lot of fine sensibility inherit from -PRON- mother 
-PRON- pa be short of ability as a moneymaker and some other thing but -PRON- get an a inheritance of character from the squander that money in a genteel way but donot let one sou of -PRON- make anything through investment 
report to -PRON- often in person or by letter -PRON- see fm aimin to spend -PRON- last day enjoyin -PRON- experience 
i never be able to get any fun out of the money -PRON- so fm plannin to take -PRON- fun secondhand 
make -PRON- snappy and if -PRON- throw in a few thrill -PRON- will oblige 
when a man be packin for -PRON- trip across the great divide same as -PRON- a leetle excitement will make -PRON- forget the trip ahead of -PRON- and be as -PRON- may say soothin 
as fm prepare to lay down life i want -PRON- to pick -PRON- up real life mind the kind miss 
i faintly somewhere within the confine of the board house there sound the musical note of a triangle 
uncle wes stir restlessly go the supper call -PRON- say 
hopper charge four bit a meal for transient like right well to have -PRON- stay and eat with -PRON- but fm short four bit in change 
if -PRON- happen to have -PRON- havenot a red uncle wes put in whipple but -PRON- credit be good at the fordham 
-PRON- credit ought to be good anywhere with that paper i just give -PRON- but the bank be closed and hopper want cash on the nail 
maybe -PRON- would better go to the fordham when the bank open -PRON- can begin to step high wide and handsome 
i only wish i be able to trot along with -PRON- but -PRON- all i can do to walk from this porch to the dinin room 
this heart of mine wonot let -PRON- exercise 
help -PRON- downstairs and then -PRON- can go to -PRON- hotel and plan -PRON- campaign 
if -PRON- put away a dollar of that money where -PRON- bring any interest remember -PRON- be do 
whipple catch -PRON- breath once more 
-PRON- be hardly able to realize -PRON- good fortune 
as one in a wake dream -PRON- help uncle wes out of the canvas chair into the board house and down the stair to the door of the dining room 
there -PRON- thank -PRON- mechanically leave -PRON- and drift out into the bright beautiful afternoon 
one hundred thousand dollar all -PRON- own 
whipple be so daze by -PRON- all that -PRON- barely miss be run down by a street car in washington street 
a whipple come into the lobby of the hotel fordham five man arise from -PRON- chair and advanced upon -PRON- 
-PRON- have learn -PRON- be in town and each have a bill 
one hundred dollar would pay every cent that whipple owe and while that be a large amount to an amalgamator earn thirty a week and with a thousand way in which to lay out that meager stipend -PRON- be a mere bagatelle to a young croesus upon whom have devolve the pleasant duty of spend more than three thousand dollar a day for thirty day 
whipple drop into a chair while -PRON- creditor surround -PRON- and hold out -PRON- statement of account 
sway by a spirit of mischief whipple mutely pull -PRON- pocket inside out 
gentleman -PRON- say come into town with thirty dollar and -PRON- be all go 
five face grow very long and then come some peppery comment 
whipple allow this to continue until -PRON- get on -PRON- nerve then with a flourish -PRON- bring out -PRON- certify check and hold -PRON- under five pair of pop eye 
however -PRON- go on tomorrow as soon as the bank open i shall have the money 
spread the good news that monte cristo junior will be at hotel fordham at eleven oclock tomorrow morning load to the guard with mazuma and ready to meet all comer with a claim on -PRON- 
money have a magic touch 
long face broadened and sour look fade into genial smile 
the man the haberdasher the jeweler who have overhaul watch 
coffee of the shortorder cafe and the garage proprietor with a bill for taxi all these nearly smother whipple with -PRON- kindly attention 
one hundred thousand dollar 
the good will mount in a direct ratio with the size of the check reach height that whipple find rather annoying 
-PRON- be know to be a good spender whenever -PRON- have the cash or if -PRON- do not have the ready money wherever -PRON- credit be good 
but the limit of cash and credit for a amalgamator be modest 
the wealthy wesley plunkett because of -PRON- know character as a tightwad never have influence the merchant in put whipple on -PRON- book 
now that have loosen in such a royal manner however every tradesman have cheerful glimpse of the nephew in the role of a princely spendthrift and -PRON- begin lay -PRON- plan accordingly 
wrench -PRON- clear of the enthusiastic group whipple go in to dinner 
every one even the waiter have a smile and a nod for -PRON- 
news of the cleck be travel like wildfire 
-PRON- hardly seem possible that old plunk have reverse -PRON- so magnificently but every one who smile and nod have see some one who have see somebody else who have feast -PRON- eye on that oblong square of negotiable certify paper 
so the check be a fact and the quick way to get a little of money be to be on a friendly footing with lucky nephew 
later in the evening whipple find time to do a little sober thinking 
in order to be completely strap by next may fourteenth -PRON- would be necessary for -PRON- to spend three thousand three hundred and thirtythree dollar every day 
and -PRON- could make no investment all the money would have to go for a good time a period of pleasure snappy and full of thrill if the approval of uncle wes be to be win 
the problem when consider at some length give whipple a sink sensation 
on one evening the previous fall -PRON- have spend fifteen dollar and forty cent 
this madden round of pleasure have include taxicab hire a picture show a dance and then a little supper and katie mingo have be -PRON- companion 
-PRON- have give that jamboree all the trimming -PRON- could imagine even buy katie a bunch of flower and a box of chocolate 
-PRON- have consider -PRON- a wonderful plunge and -PRON- recall how katie have gently reprove -PRON- for -PRON- extravagance 
but that fifteen forty wasnot a circumstance to the obligation that face -PRON- now 
how in sam hill be -PRON- go to spend more than three thousand dollar a day for the next thirty day 
-PRON- canot be do -PRON- tell -PRON- gloomily 
all the pleasure i know anything about wouldnot cost -PRON- three thousand a month in this man town 
like many another man whipple have often dream of the fun -PRON- would have if some kindhearte genie would toss a million dollar into -PRON- lap 
now face with cold fact -PRON- couldnot devise way and mean for get rid of one tenth of a million 
-PRON- need help 
in a flash of inspiration -PRON- think of concho charley vandeever 
by george that be an idea vandeever be an oldtime friend of and -PRON- proud boast be that -PRON- never have anything more than a stetson on -PRON- mind 
charley van be a cowboy 
an aunt in the east have die and leave -PRON- four thousand dollar 
the moment -PRON- get the money charley van have excuse -PRON- from the ranch and in just ten day -PRON- be back at the tumbling punching cow again flat broke 
that feat of concho have go down in the history of the cattle country as a performance never before equal -PRON- have even be perpetuate in a song entitle charley and the wad that wilt and so have be embalm for all time as a lesson to spendthrift 
as soon as -PRON- could get to a telegraph office whipple send the following message mark -PRON- rush charley vandeevef tumbling ranch prescott arizona 
get to get rid of one hundred thousand dollar in thirty day 
come on and help 
at the rate of four thousand dollar in ten day supreme effort would have amount to only twelve thousand dollar in a month 
if that be the good -PRON- could do then whipple be lean on a broken reed 
nevertheless -PRON- have confidence in charley van 
-PRON- experience would be valuable and there be no tell what prodigal height -PRON- may not attain if back with unlimited fund 
the nimble fancy of a free range would suggest way and mean for pleasure not to be find within the four wall of a gold mill 
two head be well than one in the emergency anyhow and there be nothing in uncle instruction bar an assistant spender 
whipple go to bed that night in a fairly comfortable frame of mind 
next morning at ten oclock -PRON- deposit -PRON- check in a checking account and draw three thousand three hundred and thirtythree dollar and thirtyfour cent 
-PRON- would try -PRON- prentice hand at get rid of -PRON- before midnight 
charley van could not possibly connect with the telegram and reach the side of -PRON- hardpressed friend before some time the follow day meanwhile whipple could experiment unaide with -PRON- latent power as a spendthrift 
-PRON- have a chance to begin just as -PRON- turn from the pay teller window 
hello call a voice 
put er there son be trail around for two hour try to find -PRON- 
congratulation a chunky man in a shiny prince albert coat a slouch hat and trouser bag at the knee stand in front of whipple and hold out -PRON- hand 
-PRON- be middleage have gray chin whisker and wear a pair of large tortoiseshell glass 
this person have the look of an amiable owl and -PRON- advance be more than friendly 
doc flickinger exclaim whipple take the hand 
erasmus flickinger by special appointment at cut rate physician in ordinary to that doomed and unhappy man -PRON- uncle 
still cling to hand flickinger pull -PRON- close and whisper in -PRON- ear miss -PRON- but hopper eh 
well such be life and -PRON- never know what minute be go to be the next 
auricle and ventricle all shoot to piece and now there s a valvular lesion 
july fifteenth along about three in the afternoon i should say will tell the story 
how about a commission commission echo whipple free -PRON- and draw back to look full at the sure go on flickinger always customary 
if i hadnot give -PRON- three month -PRON- wouldnot be pull down a hundred thousand a month the source of -PRON- good luck 
ten per cent all right 
-PRON- be bark up the wrong tree flickinger reply whipple coldly not hand anybody an honorarium for give -PRON- uncle bad news 
make -PRON- one per cent then beg flickinger 
all i can pry out of old plunk be fifty cent a call 
even -PRON- up for -PRON- 
just a measly thousand for shake this plum tree for -PRON- 
fifty cent a call be about half a dollar more than -PRON- call be worth 
not a cent flickinger 
this demand of -PRON- be bad than unprofessional -PRON- an attempt holdup 
with that whipple push on out of the bank 
-PRON- have no confidence in erasmus flickinger even though -PRON- have develop some success as a prognosticator in a patient length of day 
-PRON- gorge rise at the brazen demand for a commission on the misfortune of uncle wes but out of -PRON- indignation there come an idea 
make -PRON- way to the telegraph office -PRON- proceed to wire five hundred dollar to doctor mixinger of prescott and request -PRON- immediate attention in the matter of wesley plunkett five hundred dollar plus telegraph toll make cheer inroad upon the necessary disbursement of the day and whipple could not have spend the money for anything that would have contribute more to -PRON- personal pleasure 
on -PRON- way back to the hotel attention be arrest by the fact that all phoenix seem to know of -PRON- good fortune 
somehow -PRON- have get into the morning paper 
-PRON- buy one cross over to the courthouse plaza seat -PRON- on a bench and read the racy account of what must have strike the townspeople as a sevenday wonder 
the heading run whipple from threeply strike -PRON- rich 
young amalgamator at mine ride into phoenix and drop into a fortune 
easy come easy go be the string to -PRON- 
and uncle wes hold the end of the string 
there on -PRON- bench in the plaza whipple lean back in the shade of an oleander and smile a little 
be -PRON- become famous or notorious 
-PRON- wonder and then continue to read wesley whipple more power to -PRON- open hand be say to be a spender 
well have now the chance of a lifetime to prove -PRON- 
-PRON- must spend one hundred thousand dollar a month for the next two month solely for -PRON- own pleasure and without make any investment that may bring money return and then if -PRON- measure up to expectation there will be another hundred thousand dollar for -PRON- to put in the bank and draw on only as -PRON- need -PRON- for living expense 
query will -PRON- develop such prodigal habit during the two month that -PRON- third hundred thousand will take wing and finally leave -PRON- strand in mill with only -PRON- salary as amalgamator for a stake in life 
the experiment will be watch with interest by the many friend of in this town 
-PRON- appear that -PRON- wealthy townsman have discover that -PRON- have only three month to live 
mr as all know be an old prospector of frugal habit who turn up a fortune when -PRON- discover and sell the famous letty lee mine in the harqua hala 
ever since that time ten year ago -PRON- have be in fail health 
-PRON- declare that -PRON- know how to save money but have never acquire the knack of spend -PRON- for -PRON- own comfort and pleasure 
so as -PRON- day draw toward a close -PRON- turn -PRON- wealth over to -PRON- nephew in liberal monthly installment to be spend at the rate of more than three thousand dollar a day in the quest of joy and happiness 
and mr whose eccentricity be well know assert that by this method -PRON- will be secure thrill and excitement by watch -PRON- nephew riot away a fortune must be flat broke at the end of -PRON- thirty day if -PRON- be not the deal be off and -PRON- will not receive the second stake for another jamboree of thirty day 
and -PRON- can not invest in anything that will bring monetary return every red cent -PRON- disburse must go for comfort and pleasure and the question naturally arise how may a man of ingrained habit base upon the spending of a hundred or so a month blossom out as the regal spender of a hundred thousand a month 
-PRON- look easy but be -PRON- as easy as -PRON- look 
-PRON- extend -PRON- condolence to mr and to -PRON- nephew mr whipple also unless -PRON- can prove as the spendthrift day go on that -PRON- be entitle to congratulation 
whipple be laugh at this story in the paper when -PRON- look up to see a young man stand in front of -PRON- 
mr wesley whipple inquire the stranger nick -PRON- be carter wainwright of the ne plus ultra sale company mr whipple get a lot of money to spend and the right way to begin be by buy a ne plus ultra automobile 
-PRON- will set -PRON- back twentyfive hundred dollar but will give -PRON- twentyfive thousand dollar worth of pleasure 
six other automobile salesman be wait for -PRON- at the hotel but i have steal a march on -PRON- by overhaul -PRON- in the plaza 
now the ne plus ultra be the classy car on the market today 
-PRON- come equip with cord tire have all right mr wainwright cut in whipple take one -PRON- charge -PRON- more by throw in a few extra 
possibly 
come over to the salesroom and well fix -PRON- up 
by george enthuse mr wainwright this be the easy and quick sale make since be in the business -PRON- catch -PRON- at what -PRON- call the psychological moment be comment 
-PRON- arise from the bench the salesman hook an arm through -PRON- and -PRON- start for the place where the ne plus ultra be to be have superintendent at the mine have a ne plus ultra car and whipple have a turn for mechanic have repair -PRON- and tinker with -PRON- and drive -PRON- until there be nothing about the ne plus ultra with which -PRON- be not thoroughly familiar 
so -PRON- drive -PRON- shiny new machine back to the fordham and leave -PRON- out in front while -PRON- go into the hotel and become involved in the design of a greedy mob that fill the lobby and have be wait for -PRON- 
-PRON- single out -PRON- creditor and pay -PRON- off 
three gambler lead by montgomery king otherwise monte -PRON- summarily dismiss with the emphatic declaration that -PRON- be out to get a run for -PRON- money and not to enrich the card sharp 
mogollon mike moloney a povertystricken prospector whom h have know for year and who at that moment be particularly down on -PRON- luck -PRON- present with fifty dollar 
four mining broker with good thing in which -PRON- want to interest -PRON- have -PRON- ardor dampen by the statement that -PRON- wasnot allow to invest a point -PRON- would not have miss if -PRON- have read the morning paper carefully

by the time -PRON- have finish -PRON- noon meal another crowd have gather in the lobby each member of -PRON- prime with suggestion for help -PRON- get rid of -PRON- hundred thousand 
evade these caller -PRON- dodge out at a side door reach -PRON- wait automobile with a rush and a jump kick at the selfstarter let in the clutch and be off for a ride through the countryside 
the car work like a charm and just to handle the control and realize that everything from the headlight forward to the tail light aft be -PRON- very own cause -PRON- the most delightful sensation 
-PRON- afternoon spin carry -PRON- out along the cave creek road around by the indian school and then back to town again 
if only katie or mamie or lorena have be with -PRON- -PRON- enjoyment would have be complete 
but which one of the three would -PRON- have enjoy most to have along 
ordinarily -PRON- answer would have be katie but pa hard jolt over the phone have rather daze and discourage -PRON- so far as katie be concern 
and mamie philbrick have turn -PRON- down courteously but not with any regret that -PRON- have be able to discover 
miss lorena marlin have be out of town 
in the absence of any disconcert word from miss marlin -PRON- rather guess that -PRON- would have enjoy most -PRON- company on the little afternoon spin 
in the lobby of the fordham the rank of those with design on -PRON- money have be reenforce by several newspaper man who be look for a story 
-PRON- refuse -PRON- to all of -PRON- after felix vannell have catch -PRON- ear and pour into -PRON- the information that three lady be in the parlor upstairs wait to see -PRON- 
the wide door of the parlor hang with portiere open at the head of the first flight 
as whipple come close to one of the swinging curtain a voice that be very familiar strike on -PRON- ear know -PRON- first and -PRON- s -PRON- by the right of discovery 
-PRON- two may as well be on -PRON- way 
that be lorena marlin speaking 
-PRON- gurgle musical voice which have always seem so cute and childlike to whipple have lose some of -PRON- rich cadence and be tinge with temper 
-PRON- stop to debate with -PRON- and more conversation drift out to -PRON- 
-PRON- may have know -PRON- first miss marlin but when -PRON- call up last night and -PRON- have serena haskin tell -PRON- -PRON- be out of town i guess that let -PRON- out 
oh i get wise to that 
wesley will feel fine when -PRON- hear -PRON- be in the board house all the time and didnot want to see -PRON- 
well miss smarty since -PRON- know so much tell -PRON- something that be wise to 
-PRON- phone to -PRON- yesterday didnot -PRON- 
and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have another engagement but -PRON- never have any caller and werenot out of the house all evening 
so i guess be even 
whipple be terribly shake by this cross fire between lorena marlin and miss mamie philbrick 
-PRON- have no business stand there and listen to -PRON- but -PRON- could hardly have avoid hearing disclosure 
be these girl like all the other 
have wesley whipple become popular with -PRON- merely because of the hundred thousand dollar 
-PRON- draw out -PRON- handkerchief and pass -PRON- over -PRON- moist brow think -PRON- be just horrid both of -PRON- 
here come a third voice equally familiar to whipple but vastly more pleasing 
katie mingo be speak 
-PRON- tone express indignation and there be nothing in -PRON- of a spiteful quality 
whipple clutch at -PRON- as at a straw of hope 
a mocking laugh greet word horrid be -PRON- return lorena marlin 
well how have -PRON- father be talk about wes whipple these last few week

step lightly -PRON- dear step lightly whipple think -PRON- be high time to appear on the scene 
-PRON- cough fling back -PRON- shoulder and show -PRON- between the portiere 
a cry of delight welcome -PRON- and lorena and mamie spring up from -PRON- chair and hurry forward 
katie remain seat by a window and do not join in the demonstration 
lorena have black hair and black eye and katie have flaxen hair and blue eye while mamie be neither a brunette nor a blonde 
all be lovely of feature and form but a flash of revelation have show whipple that the character of at least two of -PRON- be not so lovely 
-PRON- bow in -PRON- good manner 
congrat wes cry lorena put out -PRON- hand always think -PRON- uncle would do something for -PRON- wes mamie remark and isnot -PRON- fine how be -PRON- make -PRON- make -PRON- fly whipple answer

whipple could have make these statement of fact very cutting but -PRON- be not in -PRON- to be disagreeable to the lady 
-PRON- smile as -PRON- speak 
so -PRON- go on be sure -PRON- will not be very much disappointed if i tell -PRON- that i have other plan for this evening 
-PRON- walk over to katie 
miss mingo -PRON- inquire why arenot -PRON- congratulate -PRON- think wait answer katie 
the truth be i donot know whether -PRON- be to be congratulate or not 
time will tell about that wes 
if the paper be to be believe the condition under which -PRON- uncle be give -PRON- the money may prove a handicap in the long run 
father want -PRON- to come to dinner at -PRON- house this evening 
then -PRON- have reverse -PRON- 
-PRON- opinion about -PRON- have undergo a change since uncle wes prove so liberal 
mamie and lorena titter fair face flush painfully 
whipple be sorry at once that -PRON- have speak in just that way 
before katie could answer -PRON- go on suppose -PRON- take a ride in -PRON- new car and talk -PRON- over 
just out around camelback mountain get -PRON- home in time for supper 
-PRON- offer -PRON- arm 
katie arise put -PRON- hand through the arm and cross with whipple to the wide doorway 
mamie have lose the power of speech and have drop into a chair 
not so lorena -PRON- seat -PRON- quickly at a piano thrum a few note and begin to sing 
-PRON- voice follow katie and whipple as -PRON- descend the stair katie be wait at the door 
oh dear gasp katie in charming confusion 
never mind say whipple cheerily 
-PRON- be a little hard to find out who -PRON- real friend be sometimes especially -PRON- add when one happen to have a hundred thousand dollar to spend 
that money of uncle be go to prove a great education to -PRON- 
-PRON- have a wonderful ride and not the least wonderful part of -PRON- be explanation of the way -PRON- father have reverse -PRON- sentiment be never -PRON- -PRON- tell whipple earnestly know -PRON- have always think well of -PRON- but -PRON- have have such hard luck all -PRON- life that -PRON- canot bear to see any one squander money 
and -PRON- have be in debt so much -PRON- that -PRON- fill -PRON- with horror to see a young man start life as -PRON- say completely surround with bill 
-PRON- have watch -PRON- carefully for the last three year ever since -PRON- begin call at -PRON- house 
-PRON- -PRON- didnot seem to improve wes and so -PRON- take the stand -PRON- do 
after -PRON- talk with -PRON- i try hard to get -PRON- at the hotel -PRON- but couldnot 
now worried for fear -PRON- will think like lorena and mamie invite -PRON- to dinner because -PRON- have suddenly come into a lot of money 
no katie never think that of -PRON- whipple aver never forget how i spend fifteen dollar and forty cent once and -PRON- call -PRON- down for be so extravagant

-PRON- isnot right to throw away so much money 
-PRON- be almost six oclock when whipple halt the car in front of door let katie out and then drive on toward the hotel 
galusha mingo meet -PRON- daughter as -PRON- enter the house 
-PRON- wouldnot come to dinner -PRON- ask 
no father answer katie brightly 
-PRON- tell -PRON- what i want 
yes -PRON- answer dutifully 
galusha mingo rub -PRON- hand 
then -PRON- have plant the seed and -PRON- will grow and bear flower and fruit -PRON- dear 
-PRON- shall see what -PRON- shall see 
while -PRON- be utter this oraculaf comment whipple be just cross the street car track to drive into a garage 
-PRON- work of driving be purely mechanical for -PRON- thought be all about katie and the delightful two hour -PRON- have just spend with -PRON- 
-PRON- do not hear the jangled warning of an approach street car and the first -PRON- know of -PRON- danger be a tremendous crash 
one side of the ne plus ultra double up and wreck and break -PRON- be roll and push along the track 
whipple -PRON- have be throw through the wind shield by the impact and be lie crumple and unconscious in the street in front of the garage 
-PRON- have all happen so quickly that even the crowd on the sidewalk be slow in realize that there have be an accident 
a awoke to find -PRON- lyvv e on three chair in a drug store 
doc flickinger be bend over -PRON- 
both arm and one foot have be bandage and flickinger be now decorate -PRON- face with courtplaster 
get out -PRON- say to flickinger 
fm all right remark flickinger to the druggist and the druggist two clerk 
as near as i can make out -PRON- s get a compound fracture of the tibia lacerated ligament of both arm and very grave internal injury 
call the ambulance and well send -PRON- to a hospital 
no -PRON- donot cry whipple stay at the fordham and that s where go right now 
with that -PRON- get off the three chair and start for the door 
although -PRON- limp wesley whipple walk remarkably well for a man with a compound fracture of the tibia 
flickinger chase after -PRON- wildly but -PRON- brace -PRON- in the doorway turn and shake a bandaged fist under nose have some internal and external injury -PRON- if -PRON- try to trail after -PRON- -PRON- threaten 
flickinger be intimidate and fall back 
hatless coatless bandage and wear only one shoe whipple turn a corner and walk half a block to the hotel fordham 
the usual crowd of schemer be lie in wait for -PRON- but the sight of whipple in this gruesome condition be discourage and only felix vannell and the chinese bell hop accost -PRON- 
for the love o pete exclaim the clerk the matter accident say whipple but -PRON- isnot as bad as -PRON- look 
want a doctor 
no all i want be to get up to -PRON- room 
the chinaman help -PRON- get -PRON- to -PRON- room on the second floor and would have continue -PRON- ministration have whipple not order -PRON- out 
then whipple lock the door and proceed to remove the bandage 
there be absolutely no need of -PRON- so far as whipple could discover 
the compound fracture and the lacerate ligament so feelingly mention by doc flickinger be wholly imaginary 
whipple kick the bandage into one corner of the room and air -PRON- opinion of flickinger in burn word 
-PRON- realize that -PRON- be shake and bruise and that the glass of the broken wind shield make necessary the three bit of courtplaster that decorate -PRON- face 
aside from this however -PRON- have suffer no injury 
be an athletic person and hard as nail as the saying be -PRON- have come through that accident remarkably well 
a hand try the knob of -PRON- door then the same hand drum a summon on the panel 
-PRON- be vannell and -PRON- bring a coat hat and the miss shoe 
these be just bring to the office -PRON- explain shy fiftyeight dollar and a quarter felix say whipple 
see if -PRON- in the coat 
-PRON- be not in the coat and whipple be force to the conclusion that when -PRON- be throw from the car -PRON- must have empty -PRON- pocket into the street 
-PRON- still have -PRON- watch and chain and the rabbit foot charm and for these and for -PRON- wonderful good luck -PRON- be very thankful 
vannell report that the car be a total wreck that brandnew ne plus ultra which whipple have own and enjoy for only a few fleeting hour 
but the situation have -PRON- amenity 
whipple be clean out of every cent of the money which -PRON- have draw for the day spending 
-PRON- laugh jubilantly while the clerk look on and wonclere if -PRON- be right in -PRON- mind 
in half an hour felix whipple instruct send -PRON- dinner up to -PRON- room the clerk retire and whipple lock -PRON- in again then -PRON- take a hot bath and greatly refresh crawl into bed 
when -PRON- dinner come -PRON- eat with a heartiness that in no way suggest the invalid 
about eight oclock vannell bring -PRON- an evening paper and two telegram 
the clerk be off duty and would have like to sit down and talk but whipple make -PRON- plain that -PRON- be in no mood for company lot of people have call up and ask about -PRON- say vannell galusha mingo among other 
mingo give order that -PRON- be not to be disturb and inform -PRON- that -PRON- be in charge of -PRON- case 
that all right -PRON- be pleasant to know that father be take such an interest in -PRON- 
whipple inform the clerk that -PRON- be all right and be once more left to -PRON- 
one telegram be from doctor mixinger will run down friday and give -PRON- uncle -PRON- good attention 
the other message be from charley van have be send collect and be charge against whipple on the book of the hotel get -PRON- pard go out and take a view of the universe spend a red till i get there and show -PRON- how 
will arrive thursday a m 
whipple go to sleep that night feel splendidly but -PRON- awake next morning lame and sore and with an ache in all -PRON- joint 
-PRON- try to get up and dress but topple back into bed again 
-PRON- be bear in on -PRON- that -PRON- be doom to take a day off and that -PRON- riotous spending would have to be break for a interval 
at the end of that time however charley van would be with -PRON- in person and there would be two head to plan and four hand to scatter the largess of uncle wes 
-PRON- be a quieting thought reflection have mostly to do with katie mingo during that inactive day 
and -PRON- happen to remember that -PRON- father be in need of ten thousand dollar 
-PRON- occur to -PRON- that unknown to katie -PRON- may bestow that amount upon galusha mingo win -PRON- abide friendship and get rid of more than a three day allowance of uncle money 
galusha mingo have study for the law only to find that -PRON- could not earn -PRON- salt as a lawyer 
-PRON- have then give -PRON- attention to assaying and now have a little shop about six door from corral 
the business be not prosperous and mingo have a hard time to get along 
-PRON- be a psychologist and -PRON- bring so much of the shadowy science into -PRON- business affair that possibly the fact account for -PRON- failure 
-PRON- have the faculty nevertheless of see good thing in a business way and if -PRON- have have the fund with which to back up -PRON- analysis of opportunity -PRON- may have be a rich man 
at the present moment -PRON- be very busy with affair and oa wednesday afternoon about three oclock the angle of -PRON- activity be bring very forcibly and not very pleasantly home to the young man in room mr mingo call and with -PRON- there come a little sharpvisaged man who seem deeply interested in the state of health 
mingo introduce -PRON- companion as jule fortheringham a claim agent 
the plunge at once into the business of the interview brandnew automobile be a total wreck 
-PRON- have cost -PRON- just a few hour before the accident something like twentysix hundred dollar 
-PRON- be a miracle as -PRON- may say that whipple -PRON- have not be kill outright 
seemingly -PRON- have come off extraordinarily well 
-PRON- be feel fairly well at the moment and yet who know what may not develop in the day or week to come 
mingo have vision of whipple walk with a cane or a crutch for the rest of -PRON- life 
that be a possibility 
the claim agent recognize the possibility and -PRON- be ready to give a check for five thousand dollar part to reimburse whipple for the loss of the car and the rest to in16 sure the company against any further claim 
but i be all right assert whipple and i donot want to goldbrick anybody 
galusha mingo put up a restraining hand 
whipple think -PRON- be all right but time alone could tell whether -PRON- be or be not 
disease result from the accident may creep into -PRON- system in course of time and put -PRON- completely out of the running 
then again whipple continue to protest pm not so sure that the street car be at fault 
i galusha mingo interrupt hastily to state that there be six eyewitness who would all swear that the street car be at fault 
-PRON- be probable that heredity have less to do with this matter of be square than environment 
the child of the most honest parent in the world will be mar for life if abandon in the tender year to evil surrounding but -PRON- will grow up a credit to those who bear -PRON- if right teaching be sift into -PRON- environment with discrimination and care 
whipple in -PRON- extreme youth have be well ground in proper principle and -PRON- now rebel against the course along which mingo be hurry -PRON- donot care about -PRON- eyewitness -PRON- say know that what happen be due entirely to -PRON- own carelessness 
that settle -PRON- 
jule fortheringham push a bundle of paper with which -PRON- have be busy back into -PRON- pocket 
this frankness be er most unusual where a soulless corporation and easy money be concern -PRON- remark 
who be the old chap who go hunt with a lantern for an honest man 
-PRON- could have find -PRON- prize right here in room the fordham 
-PRON- shake hand with whipple 
son -PRON- go on as -PRON- move to the door and pause there let -PRON- tell -PRON- something -PRON- canot spend or throw away a red cent without make an investment and the return be bind to be make manifest in spite of -PRON- 
just remember that 
galusha mingo to all appearance be bitterly disappointed 
-PRON- turn on whipple the moment -PRON- be alone together and vent -PRON- feeling 
young man -PRON- say angrily -PRON- havenot an idea of the value of money 
if -PRON- ever expect to get marry what business have -PRON- get turn down a chance like that 
less to -PRON- than to the lady who will some day be mrs whipple -PRON- be under an obligation to get ahead 
on the chance that -PRON- little girl may somehow be concern in -PRON- future plan i be try to help -PRON- 
flickinger make out as good a case for -PRON- as -PRON- could -PRON- be to receive ten per cent of the gross and i certainly pull the wire for -PRON- in masterful fashion 
now -PRON- have knock everything into a cocked hat 
-PRON- start for the door 
katie be grieve over this orgy of fool spending mingo go on 
-PRON- be a woman and take to heart more than -PRON- ought to the deliberate manner in which -PRON- be shatter -PRON- future go to send -PRON- to an aunt in los angele so -PRON- wonot be anywhere near this scene of criminal extravagance 
i feel that -PRON- will be good 
-PRON- jerk the door open but before -PRON- could leave whipple stay -PRON- with a word am try to give -PRON- uncle a little excitement and a few thrill in -PRON- last day mr mingo -PRON- explain as the other turn back 
in that desk over in the corner be a check book and pen and ink 
may i trouble -PRON- to bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
mingo obeyed order and whipple write out a check to -PRON- for ten thousand dollar 
katie tell -PRON- yesterday that -PRON- be desperately in need of this amount of money whipple go on as -PRON- pass over the check and i be glad to oblige an old friend 
i would suggest however that -PRON- do not tell katie anything about -PRON- 
-PRON- may not approve 
mingo be touch almost to tear 
til give -PRON- -PRON- note -PRON- say huskily 
if -PRON- do fll tear -PRON- up 
that be a free gift 
i be empower to spend the hundred thousand in way that will bring -PRON- the most pleasure 
look at in such a way if the donation mean anything to -PRON- -PRON- mean infinitely more to -PRON- 
-PRON- whole life turn right at this point continue mingo feelingly on behalf of -PRON- family and -PRON- i thank -PRON- from -PRON- heart 
be -PRON- still of a mind to send katie to los angele 
on second thought return mingo believe leave that move to katie -PRON- 
thursday morning whipple be feel much well 
-PRON- be out of bed by seven and torture -PRON- weary muscle with settingup exercise 
the cold bath and brisk rub down that follow bring a warm glow and a feeling of exhilaration 
the complaint of -PRON- dependable nerve and sinew be very mild indeed and only just enough to remind -PRON- that -PRON- have be in a collision 
the patch of courtplaster of course still remain as souvenir 
-PRON- be busily shave when something like an avalanche bump against -PRON- lock door 
-PRON- open -PRON- and fall into the fond embrace of charley van -PRON- -PRON- old seed whoop the cowboy ready to take -PRON- little hand in -PRON- and go out and put some fancy crimp in the big wad

just long enough to get -PRON- on -PRON- foot so be patient

uncle wes go into a flurry 
-PRON- rage about the dollar and a half and the extra few cent for the stamp 
while -PRON- be rave three other bottle go over the rail 
-PRON- grab for the last one but be not quick enough 
utterly beside -PRON- with rage the old prospector jump out of -PRON- chair and begin prance up and down the veranda now and then -PRON- would pause and look over the railing and moan at the sight of the broken glass and waste medicine 
say -PRON- quaver if i have a gun i surely would doctor mixinger draw a small gleam automatic pistol from one of -PRON- pocket 
-PRON- havenot one handy -PRON- say

-PRON- grow quiet instantly and slump into -PRON- chair again 
how long have -PRON- be like this go on the doctor 
uncle wes moisten -PRON- lip with -PRON- tongue and try twice before -PRON- could answer then -PRON- manage to say ten year 
ten year lose murmured doctor mixinger and just when -PRON- ought to be in -PRON- prime 
any appetite not a particle return uncle wes -PRON- fascinate eye on the automatic which the doctor continue to hold in -PRON- hand 
all i can eat for breakfast be about six slice o bacon a couple o slab of bread three or four egg and two cup o coffee every last thing -PRON- stomachll take in the morning eat enough t keep life in a chipmunk

-PRON- and i be go to take a walk around the block 
never mind -PRON- shoe those slipper will do

go way or call the police 
i canot come on doctor eye flash and -PRON- level the automatic 
uncle wes stagger to -PRON- foot 
with the doctor right behind -PRON- -PRON- reel across the veranda and through the doorway into the hall 
brace up order the doctor 
throw -PRON- shoulder back breathe deep hang on to the banister as -PRON- go downstairs 
there that s right 
now then keep step with -PRON- 
down on the sidewalk the neighbor have a glimpse of uncle wes hatless and in -PRON- old slipper move along at the side of doctor mixinger 
josh hopper stare after the two from -PRON- front step 
-PRON- wag -PRON- head forebodingly killin -PRON- -PRON- say to -PRON- reckon i may as well call the undertaker 
this be awful as doctor mixinger and uncle wes round the block the doctor steadily increase the pace 
when -PRON- get back to front door uncle wes have to gallop to keep up but -PRON- notice as -PRON- climb the stair and return to the secondstory veranda that -PRON- be not breathe much faster than usual 
-PRON- be astound 
well remark the doctor with a laugh -PRON- didnot drop do -PRON- 
mr either flickinger have scare -PRON- or -PRON- have scare -PRON- 
-PRON- havenot any more heart trouble than i have 
what -PRON- need and all -PRON- need be exercise physical and mental 
that be -PRON- proper tonic 
forget -PRON- health take on a hobby or find some compelling purpose and follow -PRON- with all the enthusiasm -PRON- can muster 
-PRON- must have an object in life that will make -PRON- think and stir around 
then then i ainot go to die in three month ask uncle wes faint with wonder 
-PRON- be go to die in about thirty year provide -PRON- smoke less and stop dose -PRON- with those patent nostrum 
-PRON- be perfectly sound and that be quite remarkable consider the way -PRON- have coddle -PRON- for ten year 
i never see a man of -PRON- age who be potentially more capable of get the utmost out of life 
but cut loose and be active 
this be a bright and happy world and -PRON- be perfectly competent to get -PRON- full share of the brightness and happiness 
while talk the doctor have be close the little square case 
straighten -PRON- turn and hold out -PRON- hand in a friendly way be pay five hundred dollar to come here and tell -PRON- this -PRON- continue and -PRON- ought to be grateful to -PRON- nephew for -PRON- be the good advice -PRON- have ever have 
i beg -PRON- pardon for display the pistol but i think -PRON- will admit that -PRON- be a difficult case and hard to handle 
i trust there be no hard feeling 
uncle wes take the offer hand then startle by the great truth that have suddenly dawn upon -PRON- -PRON- watch wideeye while doctor mixinger vanish through the doorway 
ten o -PRON- good year plumb waste -PRON- mutter kick over the canvas chair 
run around that block without so much as ketchin -PRON- breath nothing the matter not a thing except the want of exercise 
i -PRON- break off abruptly as -PRON- eye happen to cross the veranda rail encounter doc flickinger move on the board house from up the street 
flickinger be come to make -PRON- customary morning call on uncle wes 
the eye of the old prospector narrow and -PRON- face grow hard the cimiroon that do more to make -PRON- waste -PRON- ten year than any one else on earth -PRON- growl reckon due for a little more exercise -PRON- finish and crouch beside the door lead to the secondstory veranda 
a a of shock that jar the board house from underpin to roof lift josh hopper out of -PRON- chair and carry -PRON- at a double quick to the second floor of -PRON- establishment 
mrs hopper and pedro the man of all work join -PRON- as -PRON- race 
when the three of -PRON- arrive on the upper veranda what -PRON- see make -PRON- almost doubt the evidence of -PRON- sense 
uncle wes the confirm invalid have doc flickinger flat on the porch floor and be pin -PRON- there with two knee on -PRON- chest 
in a fury uncle wes be bump head on the hard board while flickinger beg for mercy 
yes roar uncle wes feelin quite well this morning doc 
no this exercise ainot hurtin -PRON- heart a particle but seem to be right soothin 
i reckon -PRON- neednot call any more 
-PRON- see make up -PRON- mind to live thirty year instead of jest three month convalescin fast -PRON- glad to see how recuperatin under -PRON- treatment -PRON- mr and mrs hopper and pedro fling at -PRON- and with -PRON- united effort manage to heave -PRON- clear of the prostrate flickinger 
the latter bounding to -PRON- foot flee for the stair the street and safety 
-PRON- leave -PRON- hat spectacle and -PRON- medicine case behind 
uncle wes fling -PRON- after -PRON- over the railing and the medicine case jingle merrily as -PRON- strike the ground 
what on earth be the matter wailed mrs hopper hysterically 
uncle wes leap into the air and let off a whoop a well man that s what s the matter -PRON- declare come to and get wise to how flickinger be stringin -PRON- along 
that lady doc doctor sort of open -PRON- eye 
-PRON- make -PRON- do thing that flickinger say i couldnot do without passin out 
oh my gorry what a fool be 
-PRON- can have -PRON- secondstory porch hopper do with -PRON- 
-PRON- run to -PRON- room kick off -PRON- slipper and begin put on a pair of shoe 
then -PRON- get into clothe which -PRON- have make -PRON- a practice to wear only on sunday 
-PRON- have a compelling object in mind 
now that -PRON- be a healthy man with thirty good year ahead of -PRON- -PRON- realize -PRON- mistake in give the hundred thousand dollar to -PRON- nephew 
-PRON- business be to overhaul and recover as much of the money as possible 
dinner be ready by the time uncle wes be ready for the street but delay to eat while be spend with an open hand be out of the question 
uncle wes reason that the faster -PRON- hurry the more of -PRON- good money -PRON- would recover 
the sight of wesley plunkett travel at speed along the street of phoenix cause the oldtimer to rub -PRON- eye and wonder if -PRON- be see thing 
-PRON- be ten year since anything like that have happen before 
-PRON- be an incredible performance for one whose day be say to be number 
must be flighty be the general comment -PRON- ought to be capture and take back to but no one try to capture -PRON- 
there be a look in the old prospector face that warn against interference 
-PRON- come to the hotel fordham dash through the street entrance and run to the counter behind which felix vannell stand and blink -PRON- nephew demand uncle wes 
tell -PRON- here and want -PRON- pronto 
get a move on young feller because this be mighty important left here bright and early this morning mr reply the clerk 
uncle wes drop -PRON- elbow on the desk and bow -PRON- tall form across -PRON- -PRON- go -PRON- bark 
-PRON- and charley vandeever start for los angele where the chance for spend money in a big way be a lot well than -PRON- be here 
this be a terrible wrench for uncle wes 
-PRON- stifle a groan 
physically there have be a change in -PRON- a complete transformation but mentally -PRON- be the same old tightwad 
the thought that have already escape and be on -PRON- way to a big and extravagant city where the rest of the hundred thousand would melt away like dew in the morning sun be a blow between the eye 
uncle wes come out of -PRON- daze to inquire wh what train do -PRON- take 
i can overhaul -PRON- with a telegram 
hurry what train do -PRON- leave on 
and what s -PRON- do with charley vandeever think -PRON- call in vandeever to help -PRON- get rid of -PRON- money and -PRON- didnot leave by train 
-PRON- buy one of these aeroplane for sixteen thousand dollar and hire the chap that own -PRON- to take -PRON- to los angele pay that pilot a hundred dollar a day -PRON- see the paper this morning full of -PRON- 
uncle wes groan again 
-PRON- stagger 
then -PRON- think of the bank in which have deposit the money 
on a forlorn chance -PRON- go there and institute inquiry 
-PRON- be inform by the cashier that whipple have draw out all the money in -PRON- account take -PRON- in thousanddollar bill 
when -PRON- leave the bank uncle wes feel like a beaten man 
-PRON- have -PRON- health and -PRON- have a lot of money leave but -PRON- hurt -PRON- to the soul to see the remain of that hundred thousand dollar get away from -PRON- 
back at -PRON- make -PRON- plan to go to los angele by train and be there to meet and vandeever when -PRON- arrive 
hopper however explain to -PRON- that the aeroplane travel so fast that -PRON- would probably be in los angele before uncle wes could get a train out of phoenix 
uncle wes suddenly have an idea 
til send a telegram to the chief of police in los angele -PRON- say and have and vandeever arrest the minute -PRON- come down stop -PRON- 
-PRON- wonot be able to spend any money if -PRON- be in jail 
jest as soon as i learn -PRON- have be arrest go to los angele -PRON- get back what s leave of -PRON- money and tell the police to turn -PRON- loose 
-PRON- go to the courthouse and talk with the sheriff then the sheriff get busy and wire the los angele police department 
follow this there be a period of wait 
feel that -PRON- have make an excellent move uncle wes grow calm 
-PRON- read the paper and learn how accompany by the irrepressible charley vandeever have buy the aeroplane hire the pilot and take flight from the city park 
this sensation divide honor in the daily press with a big bank robbery at eudora arizona in which three bandit have make a daylight raid and escape with sixty thousand dollar in cash and liberty bond 
the bank be offer five thousand dollar for the capture of the robber and ten per cent of all cash and bond recover 
this affair interested uncle wes only because -PRON- claim the attention of the local sheriff and give -PRON- less time to devote to and vandeever 
uncle wes haunt the sheriff office wait for news of the arrest of -PRON- nephew and vandeever and make -PRON- a nuisance 
one day two day pass and still the aeroplane have not reach los angele nor have -PRON- reach any other know port of call east or west north or south 
a deep dark mystery have suddenly fall over that aeroplane 
after leave phoenix -PRON- have neither be sight nor hear of 
probably the opinion run -PRON- have be wreck somewhere on the desert or in the mountain and would never be hear of again 
then on the third day after the fly machine have leave phoenix among the suspicious character bring in by the sheriff and -PRON- posse to be question regard the eudora robbery be a weazelface know to be a side partner of the gambler threecard monte 
-PRON- tell a story after a session of the third degree that let in a flood of light on the spender bind for los angele 
monte -PRON- seem have subsidize the pilot of the aeroplane and win -PRON- consent to land -PRON- passenger on saddleback flat at the edge of the estrella mountain 
this be a lonely hole in the hill inhabit solely by scorpion tarantula and sidewinder 
but the gambler and some of -PRON- friend would be at saddleback flat if not when the aeroplane arrive at least shortly thereafter and -PRON- plan be to annex every dollar carry by and vandeever by fair mean or foul 
the discovery that monte and -PRON- confederate have leave by fast automobile in the general direction of saddleback flat the very morning the aeroplane have hop off corroborate the story tell by the informer 
deputy sheriff start at once for saddleback flat 
-PRON- refuse to let uncle wes ride in -PRON- car but -PRON- enthusiasm for an active role in recover -PRON- money spur -PRON- to hire a flivver and follow on to the flat 
galusha mingo go with -PRON- and although -PRON- be manifestly no work for a woman katie mingo insist on go with -PRON- father 
katie be wild with apprehension over and uncle wes have not the heart to insist that -PRON- stay at home especially since mingo be bear rather more than -PRON- share of the flivver hire 
this second party get away three hour after the deputy sheriff have start all be too late hazarded galusha mingo gloomily 
more than likely monte and -PRON- gang have get the money and be in part unknown by this time have a lesson mourn uncle wes hang on to -PRON- money after this and not fool -PRON- away on a spendthrift nephew 
but oh what do -PRON- suppose have happen to wail katie fret about -PRON- katie say uncle wes with whom girl be a prime favorite be back in gold mill before many day work for thirty a week as usual a after all say and do and nobody ever yet make -PRON- hard to find aeroplane have be name by percival simmon the ace high and since a hand in a poker game with nothing but ace high seldom win simmon name for -PRON- flyer be not much of a recommendation 
neither whipple nor vandeever however draw -PRON- speculation out so fine 
the former pay ten thousand and the latter six thousand and when the ace high hop off at phoenix that bright friday morning -PRON- be -PRON- property and the former owner be on -PRON- pay roll at one hundred dollar a day 
whipple have turn the balance of -PRON- bank account into cash and -PRON- have with -PRON- on take the air in -PRON- fly start for los angele seventyfive bill and a hundred plus in small change 
-PRON- be enough certainly to finance a tolerable round of pleasure for two wandering spendthrift 
the three passenger be distribute in separate cockpit along the backbone of the ace high simmon in front just back of the propeller then whipple and then vandeever 
just before the takeoff whipple have overhear simmon make inquiry about the estrella mountain and saddleback flat 
this strike -PRON- as queer and -PRON- have ask the pilot why -PRON- be so interested in that particular part of the country 
simmon answer that -PRON- merely want to use the mountain and the flat as a landmark while con -PRON- course 
whipple be surprised to discover as soon as -PRON- be in the air that -PRON- be not in the least dizzy 
there be a deafen clamor in -PRON- ear 
this be continuous and make conversation impossible 
and when -PRON- get out from behind -PRON- wind shield to look overside a frightful rush of wind tear the breath out of -PRON- lung 
but there be no unpleasant sensation and all -PRON- doubt about the aeroplane be a good buy be dissipate 
thirty minute after the start a sunbaked wilderness destitute of human life be unroll beneath the ace high at the rate of a hundred mile an hour 
whipple know that a mountainous country lie below but view from overhead -PRON- seem flat and every highflung butte and peak have no more visible elevation than a cactus clump 
simmon keep constant watch presumably look for landmark 
why this be necessary at that stage of the journey be incomprehensible to whipple 
a compass course due west be all that be need 
the pilot theless seem anxious and worried and at last confused 
-PRON- dip lower in order to get a clear view of the country and then -PRON- lift higher circle and cut figure eight mile long twist and turn and fall and rise until whipple lose all sense of direction and could only judge the way -PRON- be travel by take a slant at the sun 
charley van be likewise puzzle by these maneuver 
-PRON- lean over to yell something in ear 
after several attempt -PRON- make -PRON- manifest to whipple that -PRON- do not like the proceeding and that -PRON- be lose time with all those curlicue when -PRON- ought to be whoop -PRON- up on a straightaway course and wouldnot just yell that into simmon ear order -PRON- to point for los angele keep go and oblige 
whipple lean over -PRON- wind shield and shout at the aviator helmete head the joint objection of the two owner of the machine to the man -PRON- have hire to run -PRON- 
simmon answer something but whipple could not understand what -PRON- be 
with one hand on simmon leatherclad shoulder with the other whipple indicate a westerly direction 
the pilot nod nosed the machine skyward and start again on the proper course 
for ten minute everything go beautifully and then all at once the terrific din of the propeller fail in a swift diminuendo 
presently only the screech of the wind could be hear among the taut wire and stay 
there could be talk now that be clearly hear the idee simmon demand charley van 
engine trouble of some kind answer the pilot -PRON- hand pass swiftly over the control dead and i canot get a kick out of -PRON- 
then what inquire whipple with a sink sensation get to volplane down 
look for a place to land both of -PRON- 
if -PRON- canot find the right kind of a place be all do for 
this be pleasant news 
the ace high be corkscrew downward in wide circle and the ground below seem to be jump up at -PRON- greedy for a collision 
with wide fearful eye whipple and vandeever be try to discover a level stretch of ground among the tumbled mountain peak 
can -PRON- see anything of saddleback flat yelled simmon wildly mile to the west of -PRON- flat charley van roar at -PRON- 
the country down there look to -PRON- a heap more like the gila bend divide than the estrella 
oh by glory sim -PRON- have sure get -PRON- all mix up 
hit the flat desert canot -PRON- -PRON- canot hit anything but those peak be the pilot answer -PRON- see anything that look level and smooth down there 
use -PRON- eye 
with sicken rapidity the sawtooth crest of the hill leap at the ace high a canon cry whipple as the fly machine cut across the yawn mountain chasm at perhaps five hundred foot 
and a flat at the bottom of -PRON- add vandeever 
can -PRON- drop into that gash and light on the flat get to answer simmon between -PRON- set tooth if i donot -PRON- all over but payin the bet 
-PRON- manipulate the fall machine in such fashion that the nose of -PRON- be bring in line with the north and south trend of the canon then straighten out the plane rush downward 
-PRON- clear the two steep wall of the gash and by a turn to the left hit the flat with a shock that almost throw whipple and vandeever out of -PRON- cockpit 
the flyer lurch and wabble over the rough ground finally halt with a crash 
whipple take a header into the air land on one of the wing roll down the steep slope of -PRON- and off the end in a sixfoot fall on a nest of bowlder 
there -PRON- curl up quietly and go to sleep 
-PRON- awake to find charley van throwing water in -PRON- face 
how -PRON- feelin inquire the cowboy anxiously good deal like i do when the street car hit -PRON- answer whipple in a faint voice waste all that good water charley give -PRON- a drink 
vandeever limp away bend down over a small stream refill -PRON- stetson and come back this fierce -PRON- comment gloomily as whipple gulp the water over the hat brim reckon this deal be a mistake simmon ask whipple 
who care a hoot about sim snap vandeever 
-PRON- sell -PRON- a sky boat with a bum engine and now see what s happen 
i allow if -PRON- break -PRON- neck -PRON- wouldnot be much moren even 
no such luck come the melancholy voice of the pilot 
-PRON- be sit on a bowlder minus -PRON- helmet and leather jacket and be knot a handkerchief around -PRON- left forearm use -PRON- right hand and -PRON- tooth 
whipple have be drag clear of the rock pile and -PRON- now sit up and take a look around 
-PRON- be at the edge of a flat and the flat be at the bend of the canon 
the wall of the defile be high and straight up and dow merely smooth precipice 
a small stream babble over the rock of -PRON- narrow course and in the sandy stretch be rank growth of mesquite 
the ace high have run head on into the canon east wall 
the lefthand plane have be crumple up by a big cottonwood tree and the front end of the machine have be crush as far back as the pilot cockpit 
simmon surely have be lucky to escape alive 
think -PRON- can fix up the old catamaran sim inquire vandeever 
not hardly be the sarcastic response a total wreck 
landing gear all smash propeller all in piece port plane in smithereen and engine knock into a cocked hat 
when -PRON- get away from here well have to walk 
walk yell the exasperate vandeever 
do -PRON- know what sort of country lie between -PRON- and civilization bout steen hundred mile of desolation with nothing to feed on but chuckwalla and nothing to drink but the juice of niggerhead cactus 
walk 
man -PRON- never could make -PRON- 
if -PRON- old pop bottle have to give out why didnot -PRON- pull the play within hailin distance of phoenix an elegant mess o fish 
whipple get up and balance -PRON- dizzily on -PRON- leg look around and get -PRON- bearing -PRON- suggest something to do anyways vandeever assent 
-PRON- move northward toward the upper end of the canon 
simmon do not go with -PRON- but sit disconsolately on -PRON- bowlder and begin spiritlessly to manufacture a cigarette 
-PRON- donot need to worry a hull lot remark vandeever get -PRON- sixteen thousand so bustin up the ace high donot mean a thing in -PRON- young life 
-PRON- didnot take -PRON- long to get rid o that bunch o money anyways 
plumb waste and nothing to show for -PRON- this be a right discouragin canon if anybody ask -PRON- 
look at -PRON- wall a hundred foot straight up and even a squirrel couldnot get from here to the rim rock 
and there s the north end -PRON- be just like the side wall 
i move -PRON- take a look over south 
the north end of the canon be close by a sheer precipice 
the little stream hit the wall sink out of sight under -PRON- flow through a subterranean channel 
wait a minute call whipple halt -PRON- companion who be about to turn back this 
on the smooth surface of the end wall some hand have rudely inscribe with red pigment lose creek canon 
no chance to get out 
bottle up 
johnson blue 
vandeever read the inscription give a howl of despair and throw up -PRON- hand 
lose creek canon by glory that do settle -PRON- be plant for keep 
what do -PRON- mean charley 
whipple ask -PRON- never hear tell of johnson blue over to the no one ever mention lose creek canon around -PRON- not that i remember 
say listen 
this here be a pocket there ainot no gettin out of 
once here -PRON- be here to stay 
only -PRON- as hard to get into as -PRON- be to get out of mostly 
johnson blue get into -PRON- with rope explorin like and the rope get loose and come down on -PRON- 
a carrier pigeon -PRON- have with -PRON- get back to prescott with the news but the message be weatherbeaten and dim in spot 
the location of lose creek canon wasnot readable and people hunt for -PRON- for month hopin to save blue 
but -PRON- wasnot never save 
i reckon if -PRON- look well find what s leave o -PRON- around here somer 
vandeever take off -PRON- hat and slam -PRON- down on the rock then -PRON- lean against the sheer wall and laugh huskily and mirthlessly 
and here -PRON- and -PRON- -PRON- go on load to the brim with dinero and aimin to cut loose with -PRON- in los angele bottle up in lose creek canon without no carrier pigeon or rope or nothing j plumb cast away that s all and when be lay out cold the birdsll get -PRON- thousanddollar bill and line -PRON- nest with -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh again and the wall of the canon give back the nervewracke echo 
a north end of lose creek canon be cheerless forlorn and offer a despairing prospect but a find be make around the bend in the south end that put heart in the three castaway 
the wall here be steep and unscalable and a lofty barrier throw across the defile make of -PRON- a complete culdesac 
here lose creek find -PRON- bubble up from beneath the foot of the barrier flow the length of the canon and lose -PRON- again at the other end of that tremendous blind alley 
the surrounding south of the bend be not so depressing 
the wall be hang with trail vine which give a bowerlike aspect to that part of the mountain prison and there be a flat cover with a thick growth of oak and pinon and in the heart of this grove whipple and vandeever stumble upon -PRON- big surprise a small but comfortable log cabin 
that cabin could not have be build by johnson blue discoverer and original castaway of lose creek canon 
-PRON- be seven year accord to vandeever since home pigeon have flutter into prescott and the cabin be plainly of very recent construction 
-PRON- stand empty and deserted and there be no path lead to -PRON- door 
the door be not secure in any way but open readily to hand 
the single room within be marvelously equip for comfort 
three bunk furnish with blanket and pillow be build against the wall 
three chair stand around a small table and in a cupboard plate cup and saucer knife fork and spoon continue to carry out this remarkable grouping of three 
charley van pull off -PRON- hat and run -PRON- finger through -PRON- hair 
look like somebody have be gettin ready for -PRON- party be -PRON- comment this j nacherly rattle -PRON- spur in a second cupboard be find a bag of flour strip of hacon a box of potato and a generous supply of can good 
there be a stove too in one corner of the room with pot and pan hang all around -PRON- and even a supply of firewood pile beside -PRON- 
charley van collapse into one of the chair once say that -PRON- cup be and catch a little good luck when -PRON- rain trouble -PRON- didnot outfit -PRON- with so much as a ham sandwich when makin that start for los angele in the skyhooter so if mrs class luck hadnot drop this cabin and content down in the canon for -PRON- -PRON- would sure have starve plumb to death so new the worm havenot even get in the prune 
-PRON- can draw out the agony for quite a spell figgerin 
charley return whipple this pocket in the hill isnot so blame inaccessible as -PRON- have be try to make -PRON- believe 
somebody come here and fix up this place calculate to make a home out of -PRON- see for -PRON- vandeever return that there ainot no gettin out of here unless -PRON- sprout wing admit that hombre could come down on a rope same as johnson blue do but without that same rope gettin out be go to bother a heap 
three man build this cabin and get -PRON- ready to live in whipple go on and that wasnot so long ago because everything be fresh and new 
-PRON- must be plan to come back here very soon 
well charley when -PRON- come well use -PRON- mean for get into the canon to get out of -PRON- 
all -PRON- have to do be to wait exclaim vandeever hope toe get -PRON- chance to pull out before -PRON- thirty day be up and -PRON- be leave strand with that bundle of kale have to spend faster than i reckon on when -PRON- do hit los angele 
now bein hungry and the like o that how about gettin simmon over here 
-PRON- be braggin about how -PRON- can cook 
suppose -PRON- start -PRON- in 
all right go get -PRON- 
vandeever find simmon still sit on -PRON- bowlder very much cast down -PRON- forget be -PRON- first word to vandeever that still draw -PRON- hundred a day a mere baggytelle perce return the cowboy be -PRON- stringin -PRON- when -PRON- say -PRON- could cook a regular chef boast simmon and i be sit here think how i could eat if there be only anything eatable in sight 
well chirk up be go to feed 
come on and show -PRON- 
when the cabin and -PRON- supply burst on -PRON- vision the aviator be astound 
whipple be build a fire in the stove but vandeever pull -PRON- away from the work 
sim tell -PRON- that -PRON- expect -PRON- to pay -PRON- the hundred a day whether be flyin or lay up in this canon say vandeever 
by do the cookin and take care of the ranch i calculate that hell make all of five dollar a day anyways so i move -PRON- let -PRON- do -PRON- -PRON- and -PRON- will jest sit around and fret because the spendin be so poor 
get busy sim among the supply be two or three dozen package of cigarette several pound of smoke tobacco and half a dozen deck of card 
vandeever make these discovery and announce -PRON- joyfully -PRON- whisper to -PRON- friend with -PRON- luck at the pasteboard -PRON- will be blame little of that hundred a day ever see 
simmon prove that -PRON- be really a capable cook by prepare an excellent meal 
all be in well spirit after -PRON- have eat -PRON- dinner 
while simmon be clear away the empty dish vandeever tumble into one of the bunk for a nap and whipple roam around the flat 
-PRON- seem to whipple as though there must be some way into that canon and out of -PRON- 
the story about johnson imprisonment in that mountain pocket may be farfetche 
whipple be not so credulous as vandeever seem to be so -PRON- go hunt for a possible avenue of escape 
-PRON- fail to find -PRON- 
the wall mask with trail vine be as precipitous as the bare rock face in other part of the canon 
whipple wonder if the vine be strong enough to bear -PRON- weight 
-PRON- learn that -PRON- be not for essay a climb by mean of the festoon creeper -PRON- sustain a fall of a dozen foot and give up -PRON- attempt 
as -PRON- move around the edge of the flat -PRON- foot kick against something and -PRON- stoop and pick up a small tin box 
the box be scar and worn and lock 
-PRON- break -PRON- open 
inside of -PRON- be an openface silver watch with a leather fob and an elk tooth charm attach to -PRON- eighteen cent in change a comb and brush a pocket knife and a memorandum book 
sit down at the foot of an oak -PRON- fall to examine the various object 
on the back of the watch be the monogram the same initial be engrave on the handle of the knife 
relic of johnson blue think whipple and pick up the little book 
on the flyleaf -PRON- read this write in a firm businesslike hand johnson blue late of new york city now of nowhere in particular -PRON- impression of life base on the way in which -PRON- live -PRON- and write for -PRON- own amusement while -PRON- slowly starve to death 
this be gruesome but -PRON- hold a fascination for whipple 
blue really have be bottle up in that canon 
-PRON- have send out -PRON- carrier pigeon hope for rescue 
rescue have not come and famine have claim -PRON- for a victim 
what -PRON- get this be vandeever 
have finish -PRON- nap -PRON- have go search for whipple 
the latter tell -PRON- what -PRON- have find and how -PRON- have chance upon -PRON- 
by glory the cowboy exclaim sit down at -PRON- friend side and look with deep interest at the watch the knife the military hair brush and the comb 
eighteen cent 
-PRON- be mighty nigh bust flat wasnot -PRON- 
whipple read from the flyleaf of the book 
purty tough comment vandeever with feeling 
and -PRON- may have starve allee same as blue if somebody hadnot build that cabin for -PRON- and fill -PRON- with supply 
poor old blue 
-PRON- must a be blue -PRON- last day 
i canot imagine nothing bad than have hunger get -PRON- 
read about -PRON- impression of -PRON- whipple begin to read no help have arrive and i have come to the conviction that the carrier pigeon fail to reach prescott 
that mean that -PRON- day be number 
the chuckwalla be not very plenty and not very appetizing 
in the heyday of -PRON- wastrel year i remember how squab on toast chicken a la maryland and roast canvasback duck pal on -PRON- jaded appetite 
if i have -PRON- million back i would give all of -PRON- for one dinner at i have keep pull up -PRON- belt a notch until -PRON- make a circle no big than a dog collar and not a very large dog collar at that 
but why repine 
i have have -PRON- fling and here i be hole away among the bleak mountain with -PRON- large fortune dwindle to a pitiful eighteen cent a good exhibit in the case of gal life versus a sensible existence i be a horrible example in the matter of what not to do with a million dollar and i feel the urge to put some of -PRON- philosophy down with pen and ink 
no one will ever see -PRON- but the mere writing will be a relief to -PRON- mind and will serve to beguile this period of wait for the end 
and i have an idea that i can make -PRON- finish the fine thing i have do in all -PRON- riotous year 
gosh exclaimed vandeever as whipple pause reflectively 
now whyever do -PRON- suppose -PRON- be writin like that read on answer whipple and see if -PRON- can find out be a happy man before -PRON- uncle ezra die and leave -PRON- that million dollar in hard cash 
keep book for halloran beezley and receive a hundred dollar a month for -PRON- 
get along beautifully put aside a little every week for a rainy day and have enough leave to ride over to coney of a saturday afternoon and take some real enjoyment 
and get away to the polo ground occasionally and yell -PRON- hoarse over a good ball game 
and there be ethel 
there be fine rls in this land but none fine than ethel wish -PRON- may know what have finally happen to -PRON- but that be hardly possible 
if i have take -PRON- advice but not sob about that or anything else 
i mix this dose of medicine for -PRON- and go to swallow -PRON- with a smile 
back in the old day though i be happy 
and i didnot know -PRON- 
i live in a little paradise all -PRON- own and i be get ahead at the rate of about three hundred a year 
then a snake crawl into -PRON- paradise a snake with glitter golden scale and diamond eye uncle million dollar didnot have to work any more what i tell halloran beezley 
work be for those poor fish who have no uncle to die and leave -PRON- a million 
i start out to put some new brightness in the gay white way 
-PRON- say i make good 
i have friend everywhere and -PRON- do -PRON- good to make -PRON- forget i have ever be a bookkeeper 
be -PRON- much of a trick to run through a million in a year 
not in a town like new york wet or dry 
when a man who now and then have to walk to save car fare wake up with a million in -PRON- mitt maybe hell still walk to save car fare but i doubt -PRON- 
if -PRON- be young as i be and if -PRON- have ability as a spender as i have hell probably buy -PRON- a flock of automobile and never walk any more than -PRON- just have to 
i scatter the million in twelve month and now here be far from the bright light a prisoner in these hill and with only eighteen cent in -PRON- pocket a fine case of dyspepsia and roasted chuckwallah do not agree with a finicky stomach all rusty from lack of exercise and i come to arizona for the mountain cure everlastingly too late time i die and r vandeever reach over jerk the book from hand and throw -PRON- angrily out across the flat reckon that will be all of that -PRON- growl 
now that -PRON- get -PRON- pocket full o money i ainot in any mood to listen to such stuff 
i hadnot a notion blue be that kind of a ciiniroon 
look like -PRON- be hit at -PRON- eh charley query whipple tell a man and -PRON- ainot a fair go either 
why inmlaze do -PRON- have to kick that tin box out o the brush but blue wasnot the same as -PRON- in -PRON- uncle contract that -PRON- get to spend 
blue wasnot oblige to do what -PRON- do 
-PRON- be go on -PRON- own when -PRON- get down to -PRON- eighteen cent some people plumb foolish 
whipple and vandeever at the foot of the oak in lose creek canon sit brood in deep thought over the foolishness of johnson blue 
what angle be take by -PRON- vagrant thought be no matter but presently the cowboy get up walk sheepishly over to the little book and pick -PRON- up and dust -PRON- off 
take care of -PRON- -PRON- say hand the melancholy record to -PRON- friend 
like enough after all -PRON- and -PRON- will get eighteen cent worth o fun out o readin -PRON- 
if -PRON- go into -PRON- spendin habit maybe there will be a tip for -PRON- when -PRON- get to lo have to work fast if be hold up here for much of a spell 
a little book of johnson wield an uncanny influence 
two day after -PRON- have be find all three young man in the canon have come under -PRON- mystic spell 
when whipple be not read -PRON- aloud to -PRON- companion either vandeever or simmon be sure to have -PRON- and to be deeply immersed in -PRON- content 
the sorry chronicle be less than five thousand word in length 
in give so much time to -PRON- therefore the castaway be continually reread part of the manuscript 
each have -PRON- favorite passage and whipple curious to know just what appeal most to vandeever and simmon take up the little book as each lay -PRON- down 
in case -PRON- clew be various leave bent at the corner and in simmon a pencil checking of sundry paragraph 
-PRON- develop that the cowboy interest be hold by ingenious method of extravagance 
-PRON- would charter a sumptuous private train for instance and take a large party of friend to some prize fight in the middle west or -PRON- would buy a private yacht spend a riotous month in the west indie and then sell the yacht for less than half what -PRON- have pay for -PRON- 
-PRON- would give dinner to boon companion at which diamond and platinum stick pin be pass around as favor 
once in florida -PRON- have rent an entire hotel for a week live in -PRON- in lonely grandeur with every employee at -PRON- beck and nod 
an extravagant eccentricity be never to wear the same suit of clothe twice but give away each suit when -PRON- be take off 
simmon mark passage consist largely of philosophical deduction false friend be one who share -PRON- bounty batten on -PRON- favor and then fail to recognize -PRON- when -PRON- money be go 
-PRON- be a deceiver and a thief 
and this crook be the physical manifestation of a crooked soul warp by greed and a hunger for easy money 
well that a man should have a millstone hung about -PRON- neck and be fling into the sea than to profit in such a way 
and again not money but the love of money be the root of all evil 
because of this -PRON- betray a trust and land in jail or -PRON- commit murder and hang 
one who love money for -PRON- be capable of any atrocity 
whipple on -PRON- own part be entrance with the whole tragic story but -PRON- pet paragraph be some of platitude such as waste not want not and be careful with what -PRON- earn and doubly careful with what be give -PRON- and stand on -PRON- own foot -PRON- behold to no man for so much as a nickel and spend wisely but save with even more wisdom for a tightwad be anathema and a wastrel be a lost soul and lastly this priceless ruby in the casket of diamond be not lure by relative or friend or stranger into way of wasteful extravagance for an act repeat become habit and habit become second nature and second nature become character and character make -PRON- what -PRON- be for well or for bad 
all this to some mind would have be a mere collection of rubbish 
-PRON- be quite possible to understand why the last writing of johnson blue may appeal to whipple and why a cowboy eager to master all the fine art of get rid of money may be interested in -PRON- but that percival simmon should ponder such passage as -PRON- have mark be an incomprehensible mystery 
johnson blue with just money enough leave to get -PRON- to some corner of the country have come to prescott 
like timon of athen -PRON- yearn for some desert place where -PRON- could forget the ingratitude of those whom -PRON- have believe to be friend and kill all thought of the girl ethel who have marry a well man 
so -PRON- buy a burro a grub stake several hundred foot of rope a homing pigeon in a wicker cage and set out for the heart of the hill 
-PRON- idea be to immure -PRON- on an island in the air a supposedly unscalable mesa call encan tada that have come to be a legend in the southwest 
-PRON- purpose be to get away by -PRON- burn all -PRON- bridge and even cast off the rope by which -PRON- have hope to gain the mesas top 
then if -PRON- tire of -PRON- hermitlike existence -PRON- would send word back to prescott by mean of the carrier pigeon and some one would come and effect -PRON- rescue 
-PRON- be a wild fancy 
-PRON- fail to find mesa encantada but -PRON- do happen upon a pocket in the ground as difficult of access as any island in the air 
with -PRON- rope -PRON- manage to get into -PRON- but the rope loosen and come down on -PRON- before -PRON- have lower the remainder of -PRON- supply into the canon 
week later -PRON- half starve burro wander into wickenburg this however be long after the carrier pigeon have make -PRON- home port with a damage message that tell of plight but fail to define -PRON- exact whereabouts 
so from last writing and information give by vandeever whipple piece the story together 
somehow the thrill of -PRON- grow on -PRON- as the day pass 
-PRON- seem to grow on the cowboy and the aviator as well 
knotty problem offer -PRON- to the castaway 
be -PRON- destine to reach the end of -PRON- provision and come to a wretched end there in lose creek canon as blue have do 
who have build and furnish that cabin on the flat with supply for three 
on the answer to this second question hang -PRON- hope of deliverance 
a week pass however without bring the owner of the cabin 
vandeever for once in -PRON- life at least have something more than -PRON- stetson on -PRON- mind 
by glory -PRON- complain lose a hull week here in this hole in the hill waitin for some one to come get to stop coolin -PRON- heel and try to find a way out 
grub be go fast and i move -PRON- meander around and try to find -PRON- rope of maybe -PRON- havenot rot clean to piece and -PRON- can use -PRON- in gettin clear o this blame pocket 
so -PRON- go hunt for the rope 
but -PRON- have vanish completely 
when absolutely certain that -PRON- be not to be find further attempt be make to climb the wall by mean of the hanging vine 
the vine be fragile and after vandeever have take a bad tumble the maneuver be give up as hopeless 
simmon raid the wreck of the ace high and remove and splice to34 gether a number of guy wire 
the result cable prove too stiff and unwieldy and nothing could be do with -PRON- 
in desperation another forlorn search for the rope be begin 
-PRON- be while this be go on that simmon creep along at the edge of the flat under a festoon of trail vine find a small wicker cage with -PRON- door unlatche 
this recall blue to the mind of the castaway 
here undoubtedly be the very cage in which -PRON- have keep -PRON- carrier pigeon 
vandeever fire with a sudden thought drop to -PRON- knee and continue investigation at that part of the foot of the cliff 
-PRON- creep through the vine be lose to sight for five minute and at last emerge into view with a white face and wild eye touch -PRON- -PRON- gasp draw -PRON- sleeve across -PRON- wet forehead and -PRON- -PRON- rattle 
oh -PRON- glory 
what rattle demand whipple 
bone in there blue what s leave o -PRON- 
never have such a start in -PRON- hull life layin under a bit of an overhang and -PRON- grin up at -PRON- all white and and well -PRON- finish jest have to have air 
blue be j a pile o bone in a khaki suit 
say muttered vandeever -PRON- give -PRON- a start sure answer whipple but -PRON- have get a duty to do charley a great little book -PRON- write and the least -PRON- can do be to bury these bone away in the pleasant part of the flat 
look -PRON- fountain pen 
i want -PRON- for -PRON- own this and the eighteen cent 
-PRON- can take the watch and knife and simmon can have the fob and the elktooth charm 
who get the book draw cut for that 
get simmon now get to do the good -PRON- can charley 
the three man get to work and in a short time all that remain of johnson blue have be decently inter to the good of -PRON- ability

evidently these man have find foothold on a shelf conceal by the hanging vine 
at the distance from which -PRON- be view by whipple and -PRON- companion the form be indistinct although -PRON- could clearly be see that there be three of -PRON-

by jupiter look at that 
something be toss out through the gap in the vine 
-PRON- twist writhe unfold and drop down ward resolve -PRON- into a long rope ladder 
as soon as -PRON- be in place the three man descend from the shelf one by one and land on the flat 
by that time the whole canon be plunge in gloom although the eastern rim rock still glimmer under the sun ray 
wait till -PRON- get to the cabin whipple suggest and then well walk in on -PRON- light up and well be able to give each other a good siz ing give -PRON- a big surprise chuckle vandeever if i know anything about -PRON-

and how do -PRON- happen to know about this canon and get here and be wait for -PRON- with these lamb of the golden fleece 
-PRON- seem to have play -PRON- card pretty well but be hang if i can understand -PRON- 
whipple be amazed 
the last speaker be monte a trimlooke blackleg in fancy mountaineer clothe 
the two with -PRON- be -PRON- roughneck pal peco pete geohegan and silver sam hornaday 
all in all -PRON- be about as hard an outfit as ever drift through the arizona hill 
each of the three be well armed and at the moment have a vicious sixgun on display 
what weird turn of fate have bring these man into that lonely canon 
whipple wish then that -PRON- have be even more cautious 
bind for los angele on a quest for spendthrift pleasure neither -PRON- nor -PRON- companion have carry anything in the way of firearm and -PRON- partner be hold all the trump that hand 
the surprise be mutual but every advantage lie with the newcomer a fine lot of coyote ainot -PRON- now 
vandeever remark with fine sarcasm 
-PRON- plan to trim -PRON- there in the back room at but i gallop off with every sou -PRON- three have in -PRON- clothe matchin -PRON- run o luck aginst every nickelplated holdout in -PRON- tinhorn crowd 
then -PRON- scheme to get -PRON- all back by one way or another and miss the bet 
oh -PRON- be a fine outfit of sobber 
monte smile in the oily way characteristic of -PRON- not miss any bet here in lose creek canon concho -PRON- purr 
why didnot -PRON- come down at saddleback flat accord to agreement simmon -PRON- demand whirl on the aviator 
-PRON- get wise to -PRON- here simmon nod toward whipple and vandeever and -PRON- wasnot safe 
then the engine of the old boat go back on -PRON- and -PRON- just happen to land in this canon glad -PRON- get here threecard the good piece of luck that ever come -PRON- way 
whipple and -PRON- pard would have kill -PRON- i guess if i hadnot have help 
cold rage rise in heart -PRON- sorry now -PRON- ask that -PRON- didnot let -PRON- beat -PRON- up 
sim have be playin off on -PRON- 
whipple be nonplus 
at the grave of johnson blue such a short time before -PRON- have feel that simmon confession and regret be sincere but now -PRON- have execute a direct aboutface and be one of crowd 
-PRON- make this certain by step to the other side of the cabin and join the rank of the gambler 
how much have -PRON- get with -PRON- simmon query thousand in cash be the prompt reply 
good i didnot know but -PRON- may have hide -PRON- away somewhere 
put -PRON- on the table whipple every last stiver of -PRON- -PRON- never roar vandeever show -PRON- -PRON- tooth 
if -PRON- get that dinero make -PRON- fight for -PRON- 
-PRON- pick up a chair and back into a corner 
concho remark calmly when -PRON- and -PRON- outfit drop into this canon -PRON- come within one of put a crimp into the smooth paign i ever plan 
-PRON- find a neat little cabin here well stock with supply 
-PRON- and -PRON- friend jump right in and take possession of -PRON- not find any fault with that but i want to assure -PRON- that while be here -PRON- and whipple be go to stay here 
i expect to make this place -PRON- headquarters for the next six month 
show fight concho and well drop -PRON- in -PRON- track 
put down that chair be foolish charley say whipple all the odd be against -PRON- 
this easy yielding wasnot at all like whipple as vandeever know -PRON- so the latter reason that -PRON- friend have something at the back of -PRON- head in the way of a ruse 
strategy that be what -PRON- must be 
build -PRON- hope on that vandeever lower the chair sit clown in -PRON- gloomily and watch while whipple put all of uncle money on the table the part of wisdom whipple observe monte with unctuous approval 
-PRON- may also sit down for the moment 
peco -PRON- go on -PRON- go back to the shelf and pull up the ladder have an uncomfortable night up there but -PRON- have get to make sure that whipple and concho donot clear out and tip off this new roost of -PRON- to the sheriff 
-PRON- canot let that happen -PRON- understand until be through with the canon 
silver will relieve -PRON- in the morning and tomorrow night simmon or i will pull up the ladder and sleep on the shelf forget peco finish that there s a bundle of money in this for all hand 
the mention of money stifle the grumbling of pecos 
-PRON- put away -PRON- gun pull up -PRON- belt and leave the cabin 
monte approach the table and coolly appropriate the crisp bank note that lay there 
this should mean little to -PRON- whipple say -PRON- easily get rid of -PRON- quickly and with a few thrill that ought to interest old plunk 
sorry to dispossess -PRON- but -PRON- have get to have the cabin 
-PRON- and concho can bunk down on the flat see that -PRON- donot starve at least while be here in the canon with -PRON- 
when -PRON- leave for good well that will be another matter 
get a mine here inquire vandeever 
hornaday laugh hoarsely 
well -PRON- may call -PRON- that return with a twisted smile 
peco must be on the shelf by now -PRON- add so -PRON- two can clear out try any foolishness either of -PRON- 
-PRON- voice sharpen as -PRON- launch the warning play for a big stake and wonot stand for any nonsense on -PRON- part 
good night send -PRON- something to eat in the morning 
whipple and vandeever walk out of the cabin follow by the jeer of silver sam hornaday and percival simmon 
as -PRON- move away across the flat leaving behind -PRON- the cabin and -PRON- comfort the cowboy complain bitterly about the aviator 
-PRON- ort to be kill have even up -PRON- score jyith -PRON- if -PRON- would only have let -PRON- alone a while back 
now see how -PRON- have turn on -PRON- 
johnson book never get to -PRON- the same as -PRON- do to -PRON- and -PRON- 
whipple draw closer to -PRON- irate friend 
charley -PRON- whisper believe simmon be still on -PRON- side and that -PRON- s pretend to stand in with in order to be of help to -PRON- 
never in this world declare vandeever emphatically 
be that the reason -PRON- as so pesky meek in shellin out -PRON- thousanddollar bill 
if a thought -PRON- be bankin on that 
a fought till i drop 
simmon be a twofaced measly coyote all off with that noble idee o -PRON- to give back the dinero to -PRON- uncle 
but that ainot worryin -PRON- so much as gettin clear o this tough outfit and takin a slant for phoenix get back the money before -PRON- leave the canon assert whipple 
how 
whipple do not know how but -PRON- believe there would be opportunity and -PRON- would be able to manage -PRON- 
-PRON- lead the way through the gloom to the overhang where johnson blue have pitch -PRON- dismal camp 
aimin to sleep in there demand vandeever 
why not 
-PRON- get pretty cold at night and -PRON- must have some kind of shelter 
what be good enough for blue ought to be good enough for -PRON- 
whipple go down on all four and crawl through the swinging vine 
the cowboy follow -PRON- finally but not without many protest 
pll bet the place be hante -PRON- mutter 
well -PRON- couldnot be haunt by a kindly spirit than greatly oblige to johnson blue charley 
-PRON- have show -PRON- how to look wisely at some of the problem of life 
huh grunted vandeever -PRON- be only a spender that get cold foot when -PRON- money be go 
mebby -PRON- will sleep but be hang if i think go to 
night pard 
a a rock be all that whipple and vandeever have to sleep on there under the overhang 
but -PRON- be man of hard fiber and use to the hardship of the hill 
the chastened spirit of johnson blue seem to fill the place 
to whipple this unseen presence be as a benediction nor be -PRON- as disturb to vandeever as -PRON- have fancy -PRON- may be for when morning come -PRON- be sleep so soundly that -PRON- friend have to shake -PRON- into wakefulness 
see anything last night inquire the cowboy as -PRON- sit up and rub -PRON- eye 
not a thing 
same here 
glory 
i never reckon sleep like that crawl out o this hole in the wall and find the sun 
a morning in southern arizona be one of the most cheer wonder of the country 
the mount sun have a glory all -PRON- own and the air have a tonic warrant to put to flight all the blue devil that lurk in a human heart 
vandeever be in a more hopeful mood than on the precede evening 
if -PRON- could get hold of a couple o -PRON- sixgun -PRON- remark while -PRON- and whipple be dip -PRON- head in the creek -PRON- neednot ask no odd of anybody whipple shake the water out of -PRON- hair and dry -PRON- face on -PRON- handkerchief play a wait game charley -PRON- say and see what turn up busy get breakfast over there at the cabin -PRON- add -PRON- speculative gaze on the smoke that be rise from the chimney could mow away a man size share o grub if i have the chance 
seem like may invite -PRON- in for the morning snack 
-PRON- wonot do that -PRON- s plan to keep -PRON- at a distance from the money and the gun and will send breakfast out to -PRON- 
there come sam hornaday now whipple add 
and -PRON- ainot totin any chow grumble vandeever disappointedly 
hornaday however be not come in the direction of the two at the foot of the vineclad cliff 
-PRON- look in -PRON- direction grin unpleasantly and keep on toward the eastern wall 
there -PRON- halt and yell for pecos 
the latter look out from the opening among the vine answer the hail and then throw down the rope ladder 
-PRON- could capture the ladder from -PRON- two if -PRON- have any kind o luck vandeever suggest 
whipple shake -PRON- head 
while peco be descend the ladder hornaday stand at the foot of -PRON- on guard with a gun in each hand have a dream charley say whipple would be glad to have -PRON- try something like that 
after the dust settle there would be one amalgamator and one cowpunch to keep johnson blue company on this flat 
and what good would the ladder be to -PRON- if -PRON- have to use -PRON- and leave the money behind get to have action vandeever fret 
walkin lame and jumpin through the hoop at order be a heap more than i can stand 
take -PRON- easy there will be plenty of action when the right time cony 
peco step from the rope ladder to the ground do a brief round of sentry go while hornaday climb to the shelf and hoist the trail rope then peco make -PRON- way to the cabin 
everything so far as cleverness could devise -PRON- have be make secure 
presently simmon appear at the cabin door carry a basket 
-PRON- strike out briskly across the flat moving in the direction of whipple and vandeever 
the latter breathing hard jump to -PRON- foot 
whipple catch -PRON- and pull -PRON- back 
hang on to -PRON- charley -PRON- admonish 
-PRON- donot want to spoil -PRON- breakfast do -PRON- canot begin to tell -PRON- how the sight o that traitor grind -PRON- muttered vandeever see that -PRON- get -PRON- if -PRON- the last thing i ever do 
simmon halt a few foot away and set down the basket warily eye the cowboy as -PRON- do so 
charley be get -PRON- wrong -PRON- say pitch -PRON- voice low with -PRON- two but i can be of more help by pretend to stand in with straight 
kick up some kind of a row so i can have an excuse to stand here and talk for a minute be watch from the cabin and hornaday from the shelf 
at the first suspicion that not really throw in with -PRON- be as helpless as -PRON- two be maybe bad off 
whipple jump to -PRON- foot and advance a step bad than a sidewinder to turn -PRON- down like this -PRON- shout apparently in great anger 
all i want be a club roar vandeever 
simmon jerk a revolver from -PRON- pocket seemingly -PRON- be hold the two wrathful man at bay 
what -PRON- say still in an undertone be this hornaday and geohegan rob the bank at eudora and -PRON- be hide out here with sixty thousand dollar in cash and liberty bond 
-PRON- have fix up this canon for a hangout and have some more robbery -PRON- be aim to pull off 
when -PRON- find -PRON- here -PRON- sort of spill the bean 
go easy -PRON- two 
and be watchful 
bullet be apt to come -PRON- way at any time not do yet 
do something make -PRON- look as though there be bad blood between -PRON- and -PRON- be try to get -PRON- 
i be tell to shoot at the first sign of trouble 
vandeever start to make a rush 
crack go simmon revolver 
the bullet fly wide but vandeever clutch at -PRON- left arm and reel back to be on the shelf tonight guard the ladder simmon go on speak hurriedly -PRON- chance to do something come down around midnight and well see what -PRON- can do at the cabin 
-PRON- will be desperate though make up -PRON- mind to that 
simmon whirl on -PRON- heel and start back across the flat turning again and again to flourish the revolver and shout wild threat reckon that play look like the real thing say vandeever and sure surprised at that sim 
at that mebby -PRON- s only stringin -PRON- along 
give -PRON- the benefit of the doubt charley urge whipple prove to -PRON- satisfaction whether or not -PRON- can rely on -PRON- tonight 
-PRON- donot seem right sensible that would send -PRON- here with that grub unless there be some kind of a hen on muse the cowboy darkly 
-PRON- be roll up -PRON- sleeve and bind a handkerchief about -PRON- arm a red silk handkerchief with which -PRON- have supply -PRON- in phoenix 
have pretend to be wound -PRON- be important to keep the deception alive 
while eat breakfast -PRON- do not use -PRON- left hand but keep -PRON- tuck away between the button of -PRON- coat 
the meal be a generous one consisting of coffee cracker bacon and fry potato 
as the two friend eat -PRON- consider this new turn of event 
monte widely know as a crooked gambler have blossom into an robber and holdup man 
a safe retreat from the law be that hidden and inaccessible canon 
how have find -PRON- be a mystery but have find -PRON- -PRON- be not slow to recognize -PRON- value from a lawless viewpoint 
if press by officer of the law -PRON- could come down -PRON- rope ladder and if the canon be find -PRON- could pull down the ladder as a last resort 
from that spot -PRON- and -PRON- confederate could make -PRON- raid and then return to a rendezvous that be almost proof against discovery 
naturally find whipple and -PRON- companion in the canon be a disagreeable surprise to the unpleasantness however be temper by the seventyfive thousand dollar which whipple have be force to give up 
for a little while and because of uncle money the gambler may bear with the castaway but in due course as whipple know monte would tire of the trouble whipple and vandeever make -PRON- and would seek to eliminate -PRON- 
before this tragic move be deliberately attempt the amalgamator and the cowboy would have to strike and strike hard with simmon help be the time aver whipple for -PRON- be take grave chance if -PRON- wait longer than that 
have finish -PRON- breakfast -PRON- light a pipe and arise to -PRON- foot go over to the bend and see if the wreck of the ace high have anything to offer -PRON- in the way of a makeshift weapon 
if -PRON- come to close quarter with the gang tonight charley -PRON- ought to have something besides -PRON- fist to fight with 
good idee assented vandeever 
as -PRON- start north along the creek suddenly appear from the cabin 
-PRON- carry a rifle 
where have -PRON- start for -PRON- shout 
j takin a little amble to stretch -PRON- leg vandeever answer with a scowl 
well amble around the flat but keep clear of the cabin 
try to leave the flat concho and well open up on -PRON- 
that go as -PRON- lay 
vandeever hesitate clench -PRON- fist and grind -PRON- tooth 
fust time on record i ever take order from a tinhorn -PRON- growl 
but i reckon there ainot anything else to be do 
-PRON- turn and begin follow whipple back toward the vineclad cliff 
and here something else yell 
-PRON- two have get to cut out the rough stuff when i send some one over with -PRON- meal 
simmon ought to have lay -PRON- out concho 
just for what -PRON- do this morning -PRON- man will get no dinner 
if -PRON- prove to be peaceable and obey order about stay on the flat take some supper over to -PRON- -PRON- 
vandeever be furious but -PRON- have sense enough to smother -PRON- feeling 
most certainly -PRON- and whipple be under the thumb of this smooth tricky card sharp and hard though -PRON- be the situation would have to be bear for the present 
the morning pass with another reading of johnson book and the discussion to which the various philosophical gem give rise 
in view of the melancholy circumstance that prevail in the canon the last word of the wastrel castaway be more impressive than ever 
noon pass and be as good as -PRON- word about withhold dinner 
at one oclock peco relieve silver as guardian of the ladder and both ruffian in go and come jeer the two hungry man as -PRON- pass -PRON- 
this be fierce tell a man grunt vandeever 
hit -PRON- anywhere but where i live i can stand anything but that 
-PRON- ought to be able to miss a meal with good grace charley say whipple 
think what blue have to put up with 
oh stand -PRON- return the cowboy hastily but like to eat a hundred dollar wuth o ham and egg in front of and -PRON- famishin and lace to a post with a reata 
the afternoon drag horribly and hornaday and simmon play card in the shade of the cabin gun close at hand 
-PRON- be careful to take up a position from which -PRON- could watch whipple and deever every minute 
as the sun drop low over the rim of the canon the card playing cease and hornaday and simmon go into the house to get supper 
when be call by hornaday to come in an eat -PRON- stand up and look in the direction of the amalgamator and the cowboy change -PRON- mind conho -PRON- call 
-PRON- and -PRON- pard stand -PRON- so well without dinner that go to hold back ypur supper 
vandeever give an ugly laugh as vanish inside the cabin 
even a smooth tinhorn like -PRON- can play the fool now and then -PRON- remark to -PRON- friend 
the bad fighter i ever see be a guy just hungry enough to be mad and not starve sufficient to be any way weak 
because of losin -PRON- two meal walk in on the hull gang this minute alone and with -PRON- bare hand go to be some fight when -PRON- pull -PRON- off have play well a very difficult role 
-PRON- be no easy maneuver to deceive monte and yet this be precisely what simmon have do 
the gambler be convince that the aviator be faithful to -PRON- and -PRON- lawless plotting and believe fully that no love be lose between the aviator and whipple and vandeever 
so simmon be trust with the work of guard the rope ladder 
-PRON- relieve peco and go on duty while the sun be still flash brightly on the vineclad wall but -PRON- have not be fifteen minute on the shelf before and hornaday run swiftly across the flat and take up -PRON- position at the foot of the cliff 
hey simmon shout what be -PRON- do with two extra sixgun get a brace of revolver more than -PRON- need or be entitle to 
drop -PRON- into the blanket 
as -PRON- finish speak -PRON- and hornaday stretch a blanket between -PRON- and wait for the weapon to be throw into -PRON- 
but -PRON- wait in vain 
whipple and vandeever guess what have happen 
in -PRON- zeal to help -PRON- simmon have appropriate the extra revolver and take -PRON- with -PRON- when -PRON- climb to the shelf 
-PRON- be not minded to give -PRON- up and so yield an advantage gain by -PRON- cleverness 
besides faith in -PRON- be shake and temporize with a man like this gambler when -PRON- be in such a state of mind would have be suicidal 
simmon keep well back on the shelf and hang on to the gun 
hornaday lose patience and swear heartily have well command of -PRON- 
put over the ladder percy and come down request the gambler -PRON- tone and manner not at all suggestive of the emotion that fill -PRON- 
simmon however be too know to let down the ladder and descend and place -PRON- at the mercy of threecard monte 
come down the gambler order at last drop -PRON- mask of friendliness and proceed to threat give -PRON- two minute and if -PRON- be not down by that time silver and i will riddle the face of the cliff with bullet 
no word or sign come from simmon then promptly when the two minute be up a merry fusillade stir wild echo in the canon 
peco a cup of coffee in one hand and a sourdough biscuit in the other come to a corner of the cabin to watch the excitement 
whipple be not slow to see that a situation have develop which if quickly and properly use would be highly advantageous to -PRON- and vandeever 
charley -PRON- whisper while and hornaday be busy with simmon and while geohegan be give all -PRON- attention to that side of the canon no one seem to take any interest in -PRON- and -PRON- 
come on detour to the west and reach the cabin door while geohegan be face the other way 
that scheme be a lulu mutter the cowboy with enthusiasm 
a quick run to the left bring the two around the western side of the cabin 
whipple be almost at the open door when peco awake to what be go on behind -PRON- 
the coffee cup go one way and what be leave of the biscuit go another 
no yu donot -PRON- roar dash for the open door and juggle with a revolver as -PRON- come on 
back up or drop yu where yu stand whipple shift -PRON- line of advance and instead of enter the cabin -PRON- plunge straight at pecos 
the latter halted plant -PRON- firmly and lift the revolver 
whipple be desperate and geohegan equally determine 
a distant report shatter the still air break a lull in the target practice of and hornaday 
geohegan give vent to a hoarse yell of pain and the revolver fall from -PRON- fist 
score one for sim shout vandeever jubilantly 
that be as neat a bit of drop firin as i ever see 
simmon have come into action and at the very instant -PRON- service could best serve -PRON- friend 
whipple reach side at a jump and in a flash have gather up the fall weapon 
into the cabin with -PRON- -PRON- order prod peco with the muzzle of the gun 
monte yelled peco as -PRON- grip -PRON- injure right arm with -PRON- left hand sam trouble at the ca whipple give peco a push that send -PRON- through the open door headlong get -PRON- cry vandeever from inside the cabin 
get in here quick once the door be closed -PRON- can hold this shack aginst all comer 
that move however effective though -PRON- may be be not for whipple and hornaday have lose all interest in simmon for the moment and be race back toward the cabin 
a revolver crack and a bullet buzz angrily past cheek 
-PRON- find -PRON- look into the gambler cool murderous eye tell -PRON- what to expect if -PRON- cut any caper snap and now here where -PRON- get your 
-PRON- first shot have miss because -PRON- be in too much of a hurry 
now -PRON- be more deliberate and laugh jeeringly when whipple flex -PRON- finger bring down the hammer of gun on an empty shell no doubt feel that -PRON- could afford to take -PRON- time and make sure 
whipple be near the great divide at that moment than uncle wes have ever be in -PRON- life

with a useless gun and no cartridge at hand with which to replenish the cylinder whipple be at an impasse 
hornaday watch weaseleye be wait for -PRON- to show enough of -PRON- to make a target worth while 
this blockade be lift by simmon as unexpectedly as vandeever have crash through the window and fere with watch from the shelf in the gathering half gloom the aviator have realize how badly -PRON- be need by -PRON- friend so -PRON- have lower the ladder cross the flat and come up noiselessly on side of the woodpile 
the first whipple know of this be by a startled yell from hornaday

from that point on the struggle be as brief as -PRON- be decisive 
when hornaday at the revolver point be march into the cabin be discover flat on -PRON- back on the floor two knee on -PRON- chest one hand compress -PRON- throat and the other hand grip revolver threaten and hold geohegan at bay

funny how a batch of writin like get under a feller hide ainot -PRON- 
whipple vandeever and simmon pass -PRON- last night in the canon cabin 
while two of -PRON- sleep one be always on guard 
the prisoner be resourceful and desperate man and no chance be to be take with -PRON- 
next morning there be an early breakfast and the three friend make -PRON- preparation for leave the cabin and get out of the hill 
three canteen be fill with cool clear water from the creek and three pack of supply be make ready 
three revolver belong to and -PRON- partner be appropriate and -PRON- cylinder replenish with fresh ammunition 
whipple have try hard to learn something about the situation of the canon the route to be follow in get back to phoenix and the method by which and those with -PRON- have reach that part of the rough country 
the gambler have nothing to tell -PRON- and neither have hornaday nor geohegan never make -PRON- on foot have say -PRON- grub and water will be go before -PRON- be halfway out 
a stray prospector may find -PRON- bone some time in the future but even that be a bet 
then return whipple coolly -PRON- will be as hard on -PRON- as -PRON- be on -PRON- for when -PRON- leave here well haul up the rope ladder 
if -PRON- get out well send a sheriff and posse back after -PRON- better isnot -PRON- than starve to death in this canon 
a gloomy expression cross the face of hornaday and geohegan but the gambler seem utterly unmoved 
not accord to -PRON- way of thinking say all the firearm in the cabin be carry away by whipple and -PRON- friend 
geohegan be leave with -PRON- hand free and -PRON- would be only a short time before -PRON- release and hornaday of -PRON- bond 
carry off the gun be to prevent further trouble while the homewardbound party climb to the rim rock and set out on the eastern trail 
whipple who be the last man to reach the shelf find -PRON- on a broad smooth ledge which have a downward pitch to the place where -PRON- join the cliff 
simmon explain how easy -PRON- have be to keep clear of bullet launch from the flat merely by hug the rear wall 
and there s the way up -PRON- finish indicate the lip of a fissure that angle steeply toward the top of the wall back of the swinging vine have a mind to explore that only didnot give -PRON- time 
the rope ladder be draw up and pile on the shelf and all the extra firearm be lay beside -PRON- then whipple lead the climb for the top be begin 
steady nerve be demand for this and the amalgamator be glad that the festoon vine hide from -PRON- eye the dizzy depth of the canon 
in due course -PRON- come out on the crest of the bank and pause to let -PRON- gaze rove over the flat 
all the prisoner be free of -PRON- rope and stand in a forlorn group by the cabin -PRON- face no more than white patch against the greenery below 
hornaday and geohegan shake -PRON- fist coolly light a cigarette gaze move toward the left where a sandy mound lift -PRON- among the tree 
all that be mortal of johnson blue be there a misguided man who find wisdom in the spot where death overtake -PRON-

-PRON- turn to look eastward 
-PRON- be a discouraging vista for all that could be see in that direction be peak after peak 
whipple descend an easy slope on -PRON- way to a seam that open between two of the hill 
-PRON- stop suddenly -PRON- eye on the sand in front of -PRON- 
one secret be out anyway -PRON- exclaim get here in an automobile where the machine stop to let -PRON- and -PRON- two partner off and there s where -PRON- turn to take the back track 
a note of cheer creep into -PRON- voice 
if an automobile could get here -PRON- go on donot see how be go to run into any very hard traveling 
all -PRON- have get to do be to follow the track 
the track be easily trace and lead into the seam wound tortuously about the basis of the hill and then climb a ridge and descend into a wide shallow valley 
the sun be mount toward the zenith a brazen fiery shield whose ray grow hotter as the day wear on 
heat wave rise from the baked earth quiver in the furnacelike air 
clump of cholla cactus and greasewood dance grotesquely when view through the waver transparent veil 
simmon be first to give out 
-PRON- stagger to -PRON- knee with a groan no good at this kind of travel -PRON- complain 
this pack on -PRON- shoulder weigh a ton 
for the dozenth time -PRON- uncap -PRON- canteen and put -PRON- to -PRON- lip 
vandeever snatch -PRON- away from -PRON- waterlogge sim say the cowboy 
-PRON- get to be careful o the stuff in the canteen 
and anyways -PRON- could drink like a fish and -PRON- wouldnot help none 
get up and try agin help -PRON- 
with vandeever on one side and whipple on the other lend -PRON- -PRON- support the aviator reel on 
over -PRON- head the amalgamator and the cowboy exchange significant glance 
simmon be not toughen to the desert as -PRON- be and -PRON- realize that -PRON- be go to be a tremendous handicap 
but -PRON- have play a man part in the canon face set hard and lip tighten 
what one think be at that moment in the mind of the other -PRON- would all win clear of those scorch waterless hill or -PRON- would all stay in -PRON- to the end of time 
when simmon foot refuse to move another step whipple find a great bare pinnacle of rock and in -PRON- shadow all three sit down for a rest 
-PRON- eat some of -PRON- food wash -PRON- down with a few sip from the canteen 
when the time come for -PRON- to start on again whipple and vandeever scan the sky with ominous eye and decide to remain where -PRON- be 
the hilltop to the north be blur with a haze of ghastly yellow 
the haze thicken into an opaque curtain and draw onward with a rush 
a puff of wind blister hot stir the sand of the valley until the ground seem to be smoke an elegant row of stump growl vandeever a thing like this couldnot happen only right now could -PRON- the matter query simmon 
sand storm answer whipple briefly 
hug the lee of that rock simmon and pull off -PRON- coat and have -PRON- ready to put over -PRON- head 
-PRON- all knelt and push close to the rock pinnacle 
the fly sand whisper against -PRON- worn side then as the wind increase in fury gusty blast eddy around the huge bowlder and drive the sand stingingly against -PRON- face 
the yellow fog be all around -PRON- and the smother heat make breathe almost impossible 
with head muffle in -PRON- coat -PRON- gasp and choke and almost stifle 
the physical torment bring by the storm give the impression that -PRON- be hour in pass but -PRON- duration could have be measure in minute 
after reach -PRON- height -PRON- breathe -PRON- out leave three mound of sand from which the traveler extricate -PRON- 
that be short than usual remark vandeever shake the sand out of -PRON- sleeve and wipe -PRON- from -PRON- grimy face 
the bad thing -PRON- do to -PRON- be to blot out the track of that automobile say whipple now -PRON- have get to head east and go -PRON- blind 
when -PRON- pack be disinter -PRON- be discover that simmon canteen be miss 
-PRON- could remember nothing about -PRON- 
all three spend an hour kick around in the loose sand and be compel at last to give up the search 
lose the canteen be a calamity but nothing be say by whipple or vandeever to make simmon feel bad about -PRON- carelessness than -PRON- do 
-PRON- struggle on down that interminable valley -PRON- only blessing the lessen heat of the sun as -PRON- drop toward -PRON- setting 
another halt be make at sundown 
the aviator by that time be in a sorry state 
-PRON- eye be puff -PRON- tongue and lip be swollen and the last particle of energy have be sap from -PRON- body 
but there be a grow coolness in the air that be most refreshing and simmon slump to the ground close -PRON- eye and sleep 
whipple arouse -PRON- after a while and give -PRON- -PRON- ration from the pack 
-PRON- eat gulp down the little water -PRON- be allow to have then go to sleep again 
an hour later -PRON- two companion get -PRON- to -PRON- foot once more and -PRON- continue -PRON- weary plodding onward under the brilliant arizona night sky 
whipple con -PRON- course by the star and press the pace 
there be now a very decided chill in the air which would have be most uncomfortable have the three traveler not be constantly move 
simmon bear up better than -PRON- have do during the day but -PRON- strength be flag even while whipple and vandeever be go at -PRON- good no good at this -PRON- pant -PRON- fellow go on and leave -PRON- here 
when -PRON- get out send somebody back to pick -PRON- up 
not on -PRON- tintype sim return the cowboy with emphasis 
-PRON- all go or -PRON- all stay and that s flat 
buck up 
-PRON- can make five mile at night a heap easy than -PRON- can do one by day 
here well help -PRON- 
whipple and vandeever take turn carry simmon pack and help to support -PRON- 
-PRON- manage to keep -PRON- on -PRON- foot until after midnight and then find further attempt useless 
drop to the ground on the very spot where simmon give out all of -PRON- sleep dog weary and worn to the point of exhaustion 
-PRON- awake with the blaze sun once more in -PRON- eye and the blister heat grow as the sun mount toward the high heaven 
then begin such a struggle as neither whipple nor vandeever have ever know in all -PRON- arizona year 
simmon grow lightheade and become hard to manage 
-PRON- fight to get hold of the canteen and the few drop of water that remain in -PRON- -PRON- discard -PRON- pack -PRON- sit down obstinately and refuse to move in short -PRON- do everything -PRON- irrational mind suggest to delay the journey 
the amalgamator and the cowboy grapple with -PRON- drag -PRON- carry -PRON- -PRON- one consume desire to get onward at any cost 
simmon begin to see vision of flow water and green tree 
-PRON- babble about -PRON- and try to crawl to the shelter of the grove and reach the stream 
vandeever sprawl in the hot sand give vent to a croak laugh 
-PRON- reach out gropingly with -PRON- hand -PRON- canteen -PRON- ask faintly 
right in front of -PRON- there exclaim the startled whipple -PRON- see -PRON- charley 
see nothing be sun blind for an hour

sure say whipple and toss the canteen away 
once more vandeever laugh -PRON- the gay spender for -PRON- -PRON- croak hundred and thirtyfive thousand dollar in -PRON- jean and -PRON- couldnot buy a glass o water with -PRON-

well that s about like -PRON- be all i can say there be no answer 
with an effort vandeever get to -PRON- knee and crawl over the hot sand grope with -PRON- hand 
-PRON- find what -PRON- be hunt for at last a still form crumple and motionless 
-PRON- feel the face and with -PRON- hand -PRON- pat one of the shoulder 
good pard a man ever have -PRON- mutter 
if here where -PRON- take the long trail i couldnot ask for no well company ride back to consciousness on a sea of troubled dream and a voice which have an oddly familiar sound cause -PRON- to sit up quickly and take notice 
-PRON- be night one of those splendid night for which the desert country be note 
the star be so big and bright that -PRON- seem as though one have only to reach out a hand in order to get hold of belt or of the big or little bear 
there be a lush smell of standing water and whipple lower -PRON- eye and see a goodsized water hole surround by a dusky chaparral of mesquite 
how the moonbeam play and dance over that stretch of water in the near distance be a glow camp fire 
a very tall man in sharp silhouette be jerk a bag from the tooth of a scrawny cropeare burro 
toss the bag on a heap of camp plunder the man haul the burro away on a picket rope picket -PRON- where -PRON- wonot be so handy to the grub handsome say the boss of the camp and -PRON- and the burro lose -PRON- temporarily in the chaparral shadow wander glance take in -PRON- close vicinity

-PRON- prescription be to stir around and be active what be do ever since -PRON- sail away in a flyin machine and drop plumb off the earth 
pm not feelin more than thirty year old this minute 
this spell of desert ramblin have chirk -PRON- up wonderful 
that lady doc doctor sure know -PRON- business 
for a minute or two whipple be so overwhelmed that -PRON- lose the power of speech 
at last -PRON- find -PRON- tongue 
lady doctor -PRON- echo 
be that doctor mixinger a lady 
in every sense o the word declare uncle wes and -PRON- s a right competent lady if anybody want to ask -PRON-

i have to get back -PRON- money before -PRON- have spend -PRON- all 
believe -PRON- i do stir around i figgere that every day i lose while lookin for -PRON- cost -PRON- more than three thousand dollar 
and i lose a lot of -PRON- mainly because -PRON- and -PRON- party have climb into the sky and nobody have any idee where -PRON- have come down 
the guess be pretty general that -PRON- be all kill by an accident to -PRON- machine and be lyin in the mountain somewhere 
naturally i want to beat the coyote to -PRON- money 
monte have put up a job on -PRON- and -PRON- know about that uncle wes cut in whipple 
so charley vandeever be tellin -PRON- 
well the sheriff and a posse start for saddleback flat uncle wes continue and galusha mingo and katie and -PRON- -PRON- get an automobile and follow -PRON- up but katie murmur whipple 
do -PRON- try to find -PRON- too never see a girl feel so bad over anything as -PRON- do over the way -PRON- disappear 
-PRON- and galusha be still look for -PRON- but -PRON- be stay at jimmie cabin in apache draw and do -PRON- searchin from there 
-PRON- see there be no sign of -PRON- at saddleback flat and no sign of and -PRON- crowd but -PRON- all have a notion -PRON- have be wreck in the mountain so -PRON- begin to hunt each in -PRON- different way 
i borrow jimmie burro handsome and get a grub stake off of jimmie and put off into the hill on -PRON- own 
the sheriff and -PRON- bunch be usin an automobile and galusha and daughter katie be ridin hossback 
day before yesterday i hit some automobile track 
i could tell by the tread of the tire that -PRON- track wasnot make by the sheriff machine so i follere -PRON- straight into the heart of the rough country 
i reckon i be get purty warm just when that blame sand storm hit the hill and wipe out the automobile track 
i make for this water hole as soon as i dig handsome and -PRON- out of the drifted sand and pitch camp here then i stroll up that wide valley and fairly stumble over -PRON- and -PRON- two pard 
-PRON- look for a spell as though -PRON- lay right where the flyin machine have drop -PRON- and that about all that be leave of -PRON- be reemain 
but i be wrong for all three of -PRON- be alive 
two swallow of water make vandeever sit up and talk then i begin to get the hang o thing 
i be playin in great luck and -PRON- and -PRON- friend be do the same 
the suddenness with which -PRON- uncle have step out of the role of a confirm invalid and spread -PRON- over the country in active pursuit of what be leave of -PRON- hundred thousand dollar be a matter of consume wonder to whipple 
now that uncle wes have a long life ahead of -PRON- nothing be more natural than that -PRON- should want -PRON- money back again should say -PRON- be in luck declare whipple 
-PRON- understand get a right to take back what s leave of -PRON- money 
of course why uncle wes i be plan to return -PRON- to -PRON- shy something like twentyfive thousand say the old tightwad 
be -PRON- willin to make -PRON- up to -PRON- a nice kind of an uncle -PRON- old skinflint yelp vandeever 
after tellin to go out and spend the dinero -PRON- be now crawfishin on -PRON- own game 
how can -PRON- give -PRON- back what -PRON- hasnot get an extry twenty thousand in cash in the satchel remark uncle wes and forty thousand in liberty bond 
-PRON- canot have -PRON- uncle say whipple -PRON- belong to the eudora bank loot a reward of five thousand dollar out for capturin the robber return uncle wes cannily and ten per cent of all the loot recover 
that mean eleven thousand cornin to -PRON- 
that would help some 
part of the reward go to charley and simmon whipple tell -PRON- uncle but -PRON- can have -PRON- third of -PRON- 
then there s something else pursued uncle wes 
-PRON- give muggyone mike moloney fifty dollar and the old hassayamper use -PRON- for a grubstake drawin up an agreement with -PRON- signin -PRON- and leavin -PRON- with felix vannell at the fordham 
and be bless if muggyone didnot prance right out into the phoenix mountain and drop onto a true fissure that everybody have walk over for the last fifty year 
the rock go fifty dollar to the ton and already muggyone have be offer a big price for -PRON- find 
muggyone locate that prospect file on -PRON- and have the big offer to buy all in lessn ten day fast work on reecord and the only time in -PRON- hull rovin life that muggyone ever have any luck 
-PRON- hasnot run much in -PRON- line 
-PRON- three go ahead and sleep uncle wes continue go to sit up and keep the fire blazin bright 
the sheriff and -PRON- posse be trailin around in this part of the hill and tryin to signal -PRON- readin a right interestin book -PRON- have in the satchel with all that money the last writing of johnson blue 
go ahead and read -PRON- urge vandeever as -PRON- fall back on the sand and turn over on -PRON- side if -PRON- wasnot such an ironclad old hiderack mebby -PRON- word of would get under -PRON- skin and do some good 
but -PRON- wonot do no harm to give -PRON- a chance anyways be all a part of history now the sudden and meteoric rise of one wesley whipple who ride into phoenix one spring day scattering ballad all along the trail from the threeply mine to town 
-PRON- story as one glean -PRON- from the paper read like a tale from the thousand and one night 
first there be uncle wesley plunkett deceive -PRON- with the help of doc flickinger into believe -PRON- be already climb the foothill of the great divide and be to be over the summit in three month to a day almost to an hour 
then come the queer proceeding whereby uncle wes execute a rightabout from -PRON- miserly habit give -PRON- nephew outright one hundred thousand dollar to spend and enjoy and a few day later in a spirit of rich comedy the record tell of doctor mixinger of prescott proving to the old prospector by stern method that -PRON- heart be all right and that -PRON- still have thirty year to live 
there be chuckle in phoenix over that and more chuckle over the way old plunk go into the hill hunt for -PRON- vanish nephew and what remain of the hundred thousand 
all arizona know in due course how whipple and vandeever and -PRON- hire aviator simmon have be cast away in the mysterious lost creek canon and there have be find by hornaday and geohegan fresh from saddleback flat where -PRON- have miss a gay scheme of plunder only to connect with -PRON- again in pocket among the hill 
how whipple and -PRON- comrade have turn the table on and -PRON- man leave -PRON- in the canon and almost perished on -PRON- way out of the hill be but part of a story tell over and over in store and dwelling among the mine and on the cattle range 
and the kick which fate have put into this particular angle of the affair be wrap up in the fact that -PRON- be the one who have find and rescue -PRON- nephew vandeever and simmon not only get back what remain of -PRON- money but also and this be the big the marvelous thing as -PRON- turn out find the book of johnson blue and develop an absorb interest in the wastrel sound philosophy 
the whole southwest learn how the sheriff and posse in -PRON- flivver catch smoke signal from the camp at the water hole make for -PRON- and learn about the bank looter trap and hold in lose creek canon 
vandeever -PRON- sight restore but with eye protect by smoked glass furnish by uncle wes pilot the law officer along the shallow valley over the ridge through the seam and so to the canon 
there the wily and -PRON- two roughneck confederate be capture with very little trouble and land behind the bar of the building in the courthouse plaza in phoenix 
after the court have deal with -PRON- -PRON- be take to another place of stone wall and bar for an extended stay 
bad news however be current regard mogollon mike moloney and the fiftydollar grubstake furnish by whipple 
originally -PRON- have be bestow as a free gift to an old friend but so white be moloney in -PRON- intention that in secret -PRON- draw up a grubstake agreement and deposit -PRON- with felix vanne in trust for whipple 
the mine be sell ultimately for fifty thousand dollar 
of this amount however whipple receive nothing as moloney lose the entire amount in settle gambling debt which -PRON- incur on the strength of -PRON- find fifty dollar cast as bread upon the water therefore never return to -PRON- and the incident could not be include among the dazzle romance of the mining country 
but as whipple remark -PRON- have expect nothing and therefore could not be disappoint 
the bank reward go share and share alike to whipple vandeever and simmon 
and vandeever and simmon be not forget by whipple for when the latter buy a ranch near prescott charley van have an interest in -PRON- and act as foreman and simmon who start wrong but catch -PRON- up through the writing of the late johnson blue be also give a position

when -PRON- return -PRON- to -PRON- nephew -PRON- be a changed man

uncle wes want to return the seventyfive thousand dollar to whipple declare that -PRON- have give -PRON- in good faith and should not take -PRON- back 
but whipple insist that -PRON- have no right to the money quote blue to support -PRON- argument and refuse flatly to accept -PRON- 
although overrule on this point uncle wes be like the rock of gibraltar in refuse to let -PRON- nephew make up any of the amount -PRON- have spend wasnot to invest any of the hundred thousand uncle wes argue whipple but -PRON- seem that i do that unwittingly

i owe that to a land that can produce a man like johnson blue 
hereafter go to live like a white man

and there s that galusha mingo investment -PRON- boy and then the rest of -PRON- the wedding go to buy a present for that affair that will cost a wad of money -PRON- to be

but well not discuss that 
-PRON- finish -PRON- recital katie listen breathlessly 
all very good approve galusha mingo 
capture the robber and recover the money have cause -PRON- to get ahead in spite of -PRON- 
no doubt -PRON- have wonder about the ten thousand dollar which i pry out of -PRON- 
well tell about that 
katie and i be worried to see -PRON- spend -PRON- money so foolishly so -PRON- lay -PRON- plan to save some of -PRON- for -PRON- 
with the money -PRON- let -PRON- have i buy an option on big brick block 
-PRON- be hard up and eager to sell and -PRON- option call for a bargain and give -PRON- thirty day for a turnover didnot need the thirty day -PRON- continue 
in just a week i dispose of the option for twenty thousand dollar and i be hold the profit for -PRON- 
-PRON- would be a start -PRON- see want -PRON- to know add mingo earnestly that i didnot take that money for -PRON- 
-PRON- be a plot of and -PRON- to help -PRON- and i have to draw on -PRON- psychology and proceed by indirection in order to be of any assistance to -PRON- 
katie have worry about that and the false position in which -PRON- have apparently place -PRON- talk that over say to mingo 
suppose -PRON- take a walk down the draw katie -PRON- ask 
-PRON- take -PRON- walk and by a spring under a cottonwood tree -PRON- sit down and katie begin to speak of mamie and lorena want to tell -PRON- about mamie and lorena katie whipple interrupt 
if -PRON- will remember i meet those two girl at a party at -PRON- house 
-PRON- introduce -PRON- to -PRON- 
whenever i come into town with a little money to spend mamie and lorena be all for help -PRON- get rid of -PRON- while -PRON- be always ask -PRON- to put -PRON- in the bank or pay -PRON- debt 
well -PRON- know debt never bother -PRON- much 
i be always for let the other fellow worry 
too free and easy -PRON- understand but with not a desire to beat anybody out of what be -PRON- just due 
i just couldnot seem to get the hang of that 
i want a lot and thirty a week wonot go very far 
-PRON- constant talk of save rather jar on -PRON- so i turn to mamie and lorena 
there i make -PRON- big mistake 
that night i plunge with -PRON- to the extent of fifteen dollar and forty cent and -PRON- call -PRON- down oh very nicely for do -PRON- i feel as though all the fun have be take out of the evening 
but always i want -PRON- to know i have a thousand thought of katie mingo where i have one of mamie or lorena how i feel deep down in -PRON- heart 
there be that in -PRON- eye at this moment which bring a vivid flush to cheek 
and when -PRON- take -PRON- hand -PRON- do not withdraw -PRON- be worry over there in lose creek canon katie whipple go on 
-PRON- see johnson blue when -PRON- be a bookkeeper at a hundred a month lose -PRON- heart to a girl name ethel the only part of -PRON- name that appear in -PRON- book 
just ethel if i have the full name and address go personally to tell ethel what happen to johnson blue 
well when blue get -PRON- million dollar from -PRON- uncle and begin have high jink with -PRON- -PRON- appear that ethel reprove -PRON- for -PRON- spendthrift habit just as -PRON- reprove -PRON- i imagine

what if -PRON- marry a well man while i be read johnson blue and see the error of -PRON- way and make a firm resolution to be different if i ever get out of that pocket 
what if wesley say katie softly -PRON- wasnot possible 
what wasnot possible demand whipple a wild suspicion stab at -PRON- heart 
why answer katie -PRON- eye lower that i could marry a well man than than -PRON- 
the wild suspicion that katie may be pledge to another at once take wing 
and will -PRON- marry -PRON- katie ask whipple have prospect now and thank to johnson blue i can be all that -PRON- father would have -PRON-

but -PRON- situation lumley be not so perilous as -PRON- appear 
those guard would never have dare to annihilate -PRON- with -PRON- electric gun 
-PRON- know too well that the vengeance of the dictator would be swift and sure 
if -PRON- man have the whole city under -PRON- control ask lumley how be -PRON- possible for any of the citizen of the period to defy -PRON- authority 
that be because -PRON- have dr kelpie explain jernyngham 
-PRON- use the doctor as a club threaten -PRON- with death if -PRON- do not give up the important post -PRON- occupy 
find -PRON- threat would not intimidate -PRON- 
smith use the doctor timemachine to go back into the past after more of -PRON- fellow 
the situation be become pretty jerry dick evolve that plot to help -PRON- escape 
-PRON- know now why -PRON- anticipate activity 
of course be not out of the wood yet by a long shot but be go to hang on to -PRON- power and prerogative great lumley for a bunch of year man to boss this year if -PRON- have a hand in the game -PRON- would know how -PRON- feel have to leave these time mile say lumley

where be the rest of -PRON- friend who escape with -PRON- -PRON- inquire and lindley be pick up by an airship belong to the department of custom kinch and mortimer be rescue by a detachment of muglug under command of jerry dick 
now that -PRON- and jefferson plunkett be account for the only man miss be dr kelpie 
i presume that -PRON- and plunkett be in the hand of the guard 
at this moment simpson begin bring in a number of cover dish and place -PRON- on the table 
the appetizing odor -PRON- bring with -PRON- be most delightful 
-PRON- final act be to place half a dozen cigar in the center of the table and push up a couple of chair

-PRON- be very certain that never in -PRON- whole life have -PRON- be so nearly famish as -PRON- be at that moment 
-PRON- pause on -PRON- way to the table startle by cry from the chartroom 
before jernyngham could investigate the cause of the commotion a short fat man come puff through the office door 
-PRON- face be red and -PRON- little eye glimmer 
in one hand -PRON- hold a small revolver of the ancient pattern and -PRON- fan the point of -PRON- back and forth so that -PRON- cover impartially jernyngham lumley and simpson

still watch the three plunkett move to the table take a chair face -PRON- and rest the elbow of -PRON- gunhand on the white linen 
now listen -PRON- go on go to have a square meal and -PRON- be go to stay right where -PRON- be and watch -PRON- eat -PRON-

cautiously jefferson plunkett lay the weapon beside -PRON- plate and proceed to relieve the very large famine that have afflict -PRON- for twentyfour hour 
lumley watch -PRON- wistfully even if a little fearfully while jernyngham look on with humorous resignation startling jefferson plunkett make a clean sweep of everything on the table 
double portion of ham and egg fry potato and toast vanish from before -PRON- like magic 
as the food disappear -PRON- complacency grow 
when the plate be empty -PRON- select a cigar sniff at -PRON- with the fastidiousness of a connoisseur smile gratefully and light -PRON- then very coolly -PRON- appropriate the rest of the cigar and stow -PRON- away in -PRON- pocket 
take -PRON- from -PRON- gentleman say -PRON- that i have just experience the pleasant part of this little dream 
-PRON- mind be begin to smooth -PRON- out and have a few lucid interval a cinch that this situation be too many for -PRON- and -PRON- another cinch that i be shanghai and push idto -PRON- against -PRON- will

-PRON- may now -PRON- add indulge in any conversation that seem appropriate

yes sir 
simpson disappear 
plunkett grab the edge of the table stare at jernyngham and -PRON- low jaw fall 
-PRON- cigar drop into a plate 
after a moment -PRON- mumble to -PRON- pick up the cigar absently and resume -PRON- smoking 
just as begin to feel tolerably comfortable say -PRON- something like this have to happen 
mr plunkett speak up lumley this gentleman be mile jernyngham of the weather bureau 
plunkett acknowledge the introduction with a scowl and a nod 
jernyngham lift -PRON- voice and call for simpson 
duplicate that breakfast order simp say -PRON- and see how quick -PRON- can do -PRON- 
-PRON- turn to plunkett 
lumley and -PRON- go on have just make up -PRON- mind that -PRON- have be recapture so -PRON- appearance here be in the nature of a pleasant surprise 
how do -PRON- get away from the guard miss kennedy attend to that answer plunkett 
-PRON- drop -PRON- through a grating in the diningroom and then lead -PRON- up to the roof in a roundabout way 
there -PRON- board the family flier 
miss kennedy let -PRON- off on top of the weather bureau and tell -PRON- to go down and look for friend 
a derisive smile dig crease in the drummer face 
and i donot think -PRON- finish that i give -PRON- a pleasant surprise when i show up here -PRON- be a surprise all right but the pleasure be mostly -PRON- get to hand -PRON- a piece of -PRON- mind mr plunkett observe jernyngham and i may as well do -PRON- right now 
i hope -PRON- will take -PRON- kindly but -PRON- have get to take -PRON- whether kindly or no 
-PRON- conduct toward those who come with -PRON- to these time have be most reprehensible 
-PRON- seem plunkett to be constantly on the lookout for opportunity to betray -PRON- companion into the hand of -PRON- enemy 
now be a little band of castaway who by -PRON- native shrewdness and ability have succeed in get a strangle hold on -PRON- environment get to hang together understand 
eternal vigilance be the price of -PRON- success 
-PRON- brother tod be the boss dictator and on -PRON- account if for no other reason -PRON- ought to be with -PRON- rather than against -PRON- 
if plunkett be impress with these blunt remark -PRON- fail to show -PRON- 
-PRON- listen to jemyngham with a derisive smile jerry to this all right say -PRON- that everything seem and that nothing really be be dope and when i come to -PRON- can bet -PRON- bottom sou marquee that go to make thing hot for the bunch that work the hocus pocus 
when i wake up i want to have the satisfaction of know that i plug for -PRON- side even while i be under the influence of that funny powder 
just at present little alice plunkett in wonderland and very very busy hunt a way back to junction where i get off 
meanwhile go to be as obstreperous as i can 
simpson come in and begin clear away the table 
lumley watch -PRON- with interest and impatience 
in fact -PRON- be so wrap up in the prospect of that delay breakfast that -PRON- could not feel properly aggrieve at the stand take ly jefferson plunkett 
jernyngham have -PRON- in mind to be very severethere be no doubt at all about thatbut before -PRON- could vent -PRON- indignation upon plunkett something else happen 
a door open and close 
footstep be hear approach hurriedly 
there be another flurry of excitement in the chartroom and kinch fling -PRON- ihto the office 
ah lumley 
kinch exclaim 
glad to see -PRON- jernyngham 
excuse brevity but in the big kind of a rush 
get an airship on the roof and just drop in for a moment to have a word with lumley try to corral all of -PRON- crowd at the office of the chief dictator 
mortimer ripley and be there and lumley be to join -PRON- at once off to get dr kelpie 
how do -PRON- know i be here inquire lumley 
the news come by transmit from kennedy have -PRON- find dr kelpie hear from -PRON- 
the information be bring by one of the guard who be bribe by the doctor 
kelpie be recapture but while -PRON- be free -PRON- manage to hide the timeball now -PRON- s back in the old quarter in amsterdam avenue with the guard double and -PRON- be go to use the thinkograph on -PRON- and discover where -PRON- secrete the main part of the timemachine get to prevent that 
dick be march a strong force of muglug at the doublequick to the kelpie house and need there to direct proceeding 
a sound of quick movement draw all eye toward the office door 
jefferson plunkett be just make a hasty exit 
come back here shout kinch 
be hang to -PRON- flung back plunkett look around and flourish -PRON- revolver 
try to stop -PRON- and shoot not get the want -PRON- -PRON- 
-PRON- slam the door leave those in the office stare at each other in apprehension and dismay 
confound the fellow grunt jernyngham 
not that this timeball count for much so far as the dictator be concern but -PRON- count for more than -PRON- know cry the exasperate detective 
i wish bring that electric gun 
as -PRON- happen i havenot a weapon of any sort but not let that stand in the way 
with that -PRON- fling open the door of the chartroom 
the operator be huddle in one corner like a lot of frightened sheep 
through the open door of the tuberoom jefferson plunkett could be see puff and flounder on the flight of iron stair that lead to the roof 
follow by lumley and jernyngham kinch plunge on in fierce pursuit 
by the time the three reach the foot of the stair plunkett be out of the roofdoor and by the time the pursuer reach the roof the machine that have bring the detective be on the wing plunkett balance amidship and cover the pilot with -PRON- revolver 
as -PRON- slip swiftly away into space the hardware drummer give vent to a wheezy taunt laugh 
if -PRON- get that timeball cry the panicstricken lumley hell destroy -PRON- 
-PRON- doesnot know -PRON- doesnot understand get to overhaul -PRON- exclaim kinch another flyingmachine 
i say there jernyngham get to have another machine 
jernyngham be haul a red flag to the top of a short staff signal for a municipal flier say -PRON- 
ah ha there s one now head this way 
the municipal machine which pay a license to the air ship department and be for hire round gracefully to a pause above the roof and then settle down into the stay 
kinch and lumley run up the step and clamber aboard 
follow that craft shout kinch point south toward the other airship 
the pilot start -PRON- helicopter and then when -PRON- be swinge well over the roof turn on the propeller doublecross this little game of declare the detective with grim determination 
by what process of reasoning have -PRON- convince -PRON- that -PRON- can get that timeball anyhow why -PRON- s plain crazy there be no doubt of that plain troublesome jasper return lumley and -PRON- seem to have a way of do the wrong thing with a good deal of success 
plunkett the avenger be surely an appropriate name for -PRON- 
i have awful foreboding that -PRON- be on the point of do something rash something that will result in a tremendous catastrophe 
-PRON- forget frowned kinch that plunkett be match wit with -PRON- 
thereupon -PRON- break off the conversation give attention to the chase and urge the driver to crowd on more power 
two thing be evident to those in the municipal flier 
one be that the driver be do everything possible to get the good speed out of the machine and the other be that -PRON- be barely hold -PRON- own in the chase overload say the driver a man of the period cry kinch fiercely and on peril of -PRON- life tell -PRON- the truth be -PRON- for or against the dictator 
be there any reason for -PRON- to keep this airship back the driver shiver under the deadly menace of the detective voice and look no quarrel with the dictator -PRON- whimper 
if i have why should i hold this machine back 
the man be chase be one of -PRON- crowd 
i tell -PRON- sir be overload 
kinch appear convinced of the driver sincerity 
never slow in make up -PRON- mind -PRON- have plan the next step before the pilot have do speak 
hover over that roof ahead there -PRON- order point 
stop but donot land 
come to a standstill two or three foot above the landingstage 
very well sir 
sorry lumley say kinch but the craft be overload and -PRON- will have to drop out on that roof and wait until i finish the chase and come back and pick -PRON- up 
but be sure and wait 
all of -PRON- crowd must be get together and keep together bag plunkett and well halt -PRON- troublesome career by keep -PRON- bind and under lock and key 
by lighten ship -PRON- shall be able to overhaul the craft ahead 
lumley be disappointed but -PRON- have the utmost confidence in kinch and promptly fall in with -PRON- plan 
the helicopter be hold the municipal machine a few foot above the landingstage of the strange rooftop 
lumley climb over the side lower -PRON- to arm length and drop 
-PRON- land lightly easily and then watch while the airship resume the chase 
i hope nothing go wrong -PRON- say to -PRON- turn to the edge of the platform and descend a short flight of step to the roof 
if the timeball fall into the hand of -PRON- enemy there s no tell where -PRON- trouble will end 
-PRON- worry on the score of dr kelpie and the timeball have cause -PRON- to forget for the time be that -PRON- have be deprive of the morning meal of which -PRON- stand very much in need 
now that -PRON- have be eliminate from the chase and -PRON- attendant excitement -PRON- mind return wistfully to the subject of -PRON- lose breakfast 
a sort of pergola hard by the landing stage and offer a shelter of flower vine invite -PRON- 
-PRON- enter -PRON- cool shadow and sit down on a cushioned bench 
by a supreme effort of the will -PRON- seek to banish vision of ham and egg fry potato toast and coffee 
as a means to the end -PRON- steer -PRON- thought in other channel 
-PRON- be clear that the member of the rescue society be go to have a hard time pry the dictator loose from -PRON- power and prerogative and carry -PRON- back into the past 
yet -PRON- must be do in some way 
-PRON- have no moral right to tyrannize over the folk of the twentyfirst century 
people of different age be differently constitute 
how would the people of the year have feel if some usurper have come on from the year banish the telegraph for the post rider and retire incandescent bulb in favor of tallowdip 
no no 
surely a man have no right to any other era than that in which -PRON- be bear 
the castaway perhaps not maliciously be perpetrate a great wrong and lumley be grieve to note that a sordid spirit have enter into -PRON- operation and that -PRON- be manipulate the weather the culinary operation and no doubt everything else for -PRON- own financial benefit 
this reflection be cut short 
what be that -PRON- hear 
a groan 
-PRON- start to -PRON- foot and listen intently 
yes there be no mistake 
here be something that demand investigation 
midway of the pergolas length be the builtup hood that shelter the roofdoor 
lumley observe that the door be ajar and -PRON- be not long in determine that the gruesome sound -PRON- have hear be waft through the opening 
cautiously -PRON- advance to the door push -PRON- wide and step through 
descend the broad stairway a short distance -PRON- look over the balustrade and an odd scene reveal -PRON- to -PRON- 
the room into which -PRON- have partly descend be the triclinium or diningroom of the household 
-PRON- be a very rich apartment with wall fresco by the hand of some master artist and with chair and couch upholstered in the costly fabric 
the grating through which the food vapor be will not to ascend be of yellow gold work out in an intricate and graceful design 
on one side of this grating stand a tablea breakfasttable as -PRON- werebrought from some peasant hut and put down in those luxurious surrounding 
-PRON- be cover with a paper cloth and the dish be of tin evidently design for other use and press into service by sudden necessity 
there be a bowlshape dish half full of a dark liquid 
at half a dozen place around the board be plate heap with food a sort of food lumley could not remember ever have see before 
six chair be push back from the table 
those who have be eat be lie on couch or be writhe in chair fill with a misery that find vent in heartwrenche groan 
lumley grasp the situation in a moment 
this be the result of decree these people of the period be try to carry out the term of the new law 
for year -PRON- have sit at -PRON- golden grating converse pleasantly and absorb -PRON- nutrition 
now -PRON- be try to eat the solid nonvaporize nondeodorized food and the result could not be otherwise than painful heart go out to the sufferer even as -PRON- indignation wax strong against the dictator 
-PRON- be a brutal decree 
famish as -PRON- be however the sight of that breakfast tempt -PRON- 
not one of the six member of the household pay -PRON- the slight attention and -PRON- descend quietly draw up one of the chair and sit down at the table 
-PRON- pick up a fragment of something try to determine what -PRON- be by sight and then by taste 
-PRON- be hard and soggy and burn 
-PRON- drop -PRON- 
yes -PRON- be hungry than -PRON- have ever be in -PRON- life but -PRON- couldnot go that 
eat -PRON- command a hollow voice 
-PRON- be call bread in the cookbook 
-PRON- be from those distant time and -PRON- ask a demonstration 
prove to -PRON- that the stuff be edible 
lumley look up 
the man of the house evidently be stand before -PRON- 
-PRON- absurd costume in nowise diminish the touching spectacle -PRON- present 
the pinch face and feverish eye be mute evidence of starvation 
-PRON- dear friend return lumley with feeling i would put up with a good deal of personal inconvenience to eat this bread if -PRON- be possible 
but -PRON- isnot 
-PRON- cook have make a botch of the baking 
try one of those chop beg the man there beside the bread 
chop echo lumley 
these be not chop -PRON- be clinker burn to a cinder 
no one could eat those thing 
have some of the coffee 
lumley try -PRON- and strangle 
i canot -PRON- sputter like to oblige -PRON- if i could but there s a limit to what i can stand even when ravenous 
so come from the other bitterly 
-PRON- be order by these usurper to eat food that even -PRON- can not endure and -PRON- have always be eater while -PRON- have become absorber 
-PRON- nature be delicately attune to the beautiful and the progressive in life and the coarseness of the act of mastication revolt -PRON- even as the odor of the solid food be offensive 
mark -PRON- word decree will prove the undoing of these usurper 
where do -PRON- come from query another voice 
lumley look around 
all the male member of the household four of themwere on -PRON- foot 
the mother and daughter have lift -PRON- on -PRON- couch and be stare at lumley with reproachful eye 
lumley explain that -PRON- have be set down on the roof by a friend and be to be pick up later 
-PRON- be one of the recent arrival 
while on the roof -PRON- have hear groan and out of a desire to relieve a fellow creature distress -PRON- have intrude into the triclinium 
-PRON- hope -PRON- would pardon -PRON- 
-PRON- feel for -PRON- deeply and be sorry -PRON- be powerless to be of any help 
if thy would excuse -PRON- -PRON- would go back to the roof again and wait for -PRON- friend airship 
one of the son spring to the wall and pull a switch 
the roofdoor could be hear to close 
i open that door say the young man so that -PRON- could get the air 
now -PRON- be closed and fasten 
well do exclaim the head of the house 
send a transmit to the headquarters of the opposition one of -PRON- 
-PRON- will turn this man over to -PRON- 
then and for the first time lumley realize that -PRON- generous desire to aid the distressed have plunge -PRON- into trouble 
to get to the roof be impossible 
the elevator opening be in the wall behind -PRON- and -PRON- start up and retreat toward -PRON- 
all the time -PRON- be execute -PRON- retreat toward the elevator -PRON- be plead with -PRON- enraged foe for -PRON- kindly consideration 
one of the son be take down an electric rifle from the wall 
mother and daughter clasped in each other arm be on the verge of hysteria 
but the father torture into fury by decree be eager for hostility 
just as the young man turn with the electric rifle lumley fall backward into the elevator cage 
-PRON- fall body touch the spring that release the car and -PRON- shoot downward at the foot of the shaft -PRON- regain -PRON- foot and plunge through an open door 
-PRON- be on the ground floor of the house and above -PRON- -PRON- could hear sound of wildest commotiontransmit shout to the opposition scream of woman wild shout of the man a patter of foot on broad staircase 
lumley gain a massive street door only to find -PRON- lock 
what be there to do 
-PRON- fight with the door and as -PRON- struggle -PRON- call wildly for help 
-PRON- call -PRON- frantically reason be as useless as -PRON- attempt to open the door 
yet -PRON- must do something and instinctively -PRON- continue to shout and wrench at the barrier with all -PRON- strength 
suddenly there be a crash a ring impact as of a ton of steel hurl against the door on -PRON- outer side 
the stout wood shiver and all but yield 
again come the thunderous attack and this time the door be burst inward 
lumley be fling backward to the floor 
as -PRON- lie there -PRON- have a glimpse of a warrior muglug charge through the breach 
the steel giant bent over lumley lift -PRON- as easily as though -PRON- have be an infant fling -PRON- across one shoulder and make off with -PRON- 
outside the house another muglug of the warrior class join the first and shoulder to shoulder the two rattle and clang -PRON- way down the street 
the relief lumley may otherwise have feel be cloud with uncertainty 
-PRON- be hold to the muglug shoulder by a viselike grip of the iron hand and every attempt -PRON- make to free -PRON- be meet with firm resistance 
the two muglug be at large 
be -PRON- dependable or have -PRON- rebel against the authority of jerry dick and go on a bit of a rampage 
lumley could only wait and worry and hope for the good 
five minute after lumley have be rescue from the house where edict have cause so much distress -PRON- be bear into a great building that fairly roar with activity 
on every hand steel be smite steel and the din be terrific 
muglug be at work build other muglug 
the steel mechanic be divide into group and each group have -PRON- own particular piecework 
here be a dozen or so shape fit and rivet the metal head just beyond these be the torsoworker farther along be the toiler who hinge and joint the wonderful arm and hand over on the right be those whose business -PRON- be to fashion the leg and foot and make perfect the clever joint at thigh knee and ankle and then last of all be the assemble frame where each part be bring together and the complete muglug stamp with a number and lay aside for test and final approval 
lumley over the iron shoulder of the muglug who be carry -PRON- survey the establishment with wonder and admiration 
-PRON- have lose -PRON- fear for the arrival at the factory have convince -PRON- that although the steel warrior be at large -PRON- be by no mean proceed at random 
reassure as to -PRON- own personal safety -PRON- survey the plant with interest as -PRON- be carry through -PRON- 
pass out of the huge workshop the two muglug cross a glassy plot and enter a small building 
lumley be place in a chair and the metal giant who have bring -PRON- range -PRON- side by side along the wall and lift -PRON- hand to -PRON- forehead 
a towheaded usurper of perhaps twentyfive sit at a table in front of a number of blueprint and receive the salute

as two toiler from the workshop be carry away the defective muglug a glitter airship hover suddenly over the grassy sward between the office and the factory then drop lightly and swiftly into the factory hangar 
through the open door of the office lumley could see a determinedlooking man step out of the craft and come down the hangar step 
on either side of -PRON- march a warrior muglug overlay with gold and silver filigreework and arm with an electric rifle 
now what s up remark grant in a puzzled tone the chief dictator and -PRON- isnot due to inspect the plant for a week yet wrong that s a cinch

the castaway have get a stranglehold on the time old chap and be out for reform with a big a job wait for -PRON- and as soon as i get the transmit from the muglug factory give news of -PRON- whereabout i climb into the meteor and fly over this way 
say lumley -PRON- will never want to leave want to cast in -PRON- lot with -PRON- and become one of the dictator 
all the other who come with -PRON- have accept place of power and -PRON- couldnot think of leave -PRON- out that ask lumley thinking -PRON- have not hear aright

ah dr kelpie dr kelpie who could have believe -PRON- of -PRON- 
but stay 
lumley have one think like a forlorn hope 
tod say -PRON- what office have -PRON- give -PRON- brother jefferson 
i havenot see jefferson as yet be the reply but i shall certainly have a good dictatorship for jeff 
as for -PRON- lumley what more fitting than that -PRON- should be supervisor general of the subconscious ray 
-PRON- can have a blue and gold office in the head center building and make sure that the ray be at all time efficient and properly direct no chance for graft but what s the odd all -PRON- picking be throw into a common fund and when -PRON- have have enough of the game well split even 
what do -PRON- say lumley have not the slight intention of ally -PRON- with the freebooter 
-PRON- be consecrate to the one purpose of rescue all of -PRON- from -PRON- reprehensible career and restore -PRON- to sphere of respectable activity in -PRON- own time 
but if -PRON- gain -PRON- end against such overwhelming odd -PRON- must proceed warily have to think about -PRON- tod -PRON- say 
i canot give -PRON- an answer offhand

hustle the work here archibald say -PRON- 
every capable muglug -PRON- turn out be another rivet in the fabric of -PRON- power 
the strong -PRON- be the farther -PRON- can go and the farther -PRON- go the more successful -PRON- information 
by work night and day tod reply grant -PRON- can turn out on an average twentyfive mug test and every twentyfour hour 
only about one in ten be defective 
good work 
keep -PRON- up be around for regular weekly inspection on saturday next 
all ready lumley 
the two product de luxe of the muglug factory especially construct for the chief dictator bodyguard march back to the gleam airship as -PRON- have march away from itflanke -PRON- august master

adrift in the unknown queer adventure in a queer realm by author of the special game in the web -PRON- friend the enemy etc seventh avenue new york splendid interesting big story for the present the adventure library will be devote to the publication of story by william wallace cook 
the fact that one man write all of these story in no way detract from -PRON- interest as -PRON- be all very different in plot and locality 
for example the action in one story take place in the land of little rain another deal with adventure on the high sea another be a good railroad story other be splendid western story and some be mystery story 
all of -PRON- however be story of vigorous adventure draw true to life which give -PRON- the thrill that all really good fiction should have 
copyright by frank munsey co adrift in the unknown print in the united state of america lose stray or steal 
an uninvited guest professor feat the plutocrat reconcile travel sunward a landing effect face a mercurial storm the mercurial learn the wordbox how -PRON- be catalogue the dilemma of mr meig condemn to death a threatening calamity plan to steal a building survey -PRON- own planet how illluck overtake -PRON- a change of heart how -PRON- outwit the king back to earth there could be no more fitting introduction to this most amazing narrative from the pen of jame peter munn than that article in the morning mercury 
munn -PRON- be no breach of confidence to inform the reader be a reformed burglar although the author of two book which achieve large sale and be most favorably receive by the way of crack safe and the manualmr 
munn develop small skill with the pen so that the breathless interest arouse by -PRON- revelation hang more upon the matter than the style 
the mercury article should do -PRON- mite toward prepare the reader for what be to come 
in the first place the story be what newspaper man call a scoop 
the article in the first edition run as follow a a what happen to professor quinn last night 
and what happen to the strange steel structure know locally among harlem resident as castle 
for quinn and -PRON- castle be snuff out like a candlegleam some time between the hour of eleven oclock and midnight 
patrolman casey who travel a beat in that part of harlem aver that -PRON- pass the castle at eleven oclock and that -PRON- be there -PRON- pass -PRON- site again at twelve and -PRON- be not there 
considerably exercise patrolman casey make search for the castle and although -PRON- beat up the country for a dozen block in all direction -PRON- fail to find -PRON- 
and what be more patrolman casey declare that -PRON- take the pledge when -PRON- go on the force and have be a total abstainer ever since 
corroboration of the officer report be not lack 
certain resident of the vicinity state that -PRON- see the professor weird dwell yesterday evening -PRON- window be aglow and -PRON- appear evident that the professor be entertaining friend 
the first gray dawn this morning show a bare lot with the steel house miss 
be -PRON- another case of palace dissolving into thin air at the presto of some wonder worker 
or be -PRON- a plain case of larceny undertake on a gigantic scale 
a golden opportunity offer -PRON- to a sleuth of the sherlock holme school and for such a person the mercury present the follow fact first the socalled castle be projectileshape of boilerplate construction and measure some twenty foot in diameter tapering to a point thirty foot above ground 
-PRON- be cover with a sort of paint that give -PRON- the appearance of frost silver 
second there be much low shrubbery surround the site of the castle and if the castle have be blow down and roll from the ridge -PRON- stand on into the river there would have be leave evidence in plenty of such disaster 
note the castle certainly weigh five ton possibly five time that 
nothing short of a cyclone could have budge -PRON- and there be hardly a breath of air stir the whole night long 
third professor quinn ever since -PRON- erect -PRON- steel house and move into -PRON- have be regard as mildly insane 
like -PRON- desire to be enter on the angelic scroll as one who love -PRON- fellowman 
last summer -PRON- read before the astronomical society a paper entitle the mutability of newtonian law and be laugh out of that honorable body for -PRON- inconsistency 
although advert to as the harlem sage professor quinn be no merlin nor do -PRON- possess the ring of gyge that render -PRON- wearer invisible 
yet where be -PRON- 
and where be -PRON- castle 
until some vidocq appear and solve the mystery echo can only answer where 
so much for the article in the first printing of the paper 
the bright young man who stand sponsor for the scoop have meanwhile be very busy with fresh detail and the second edition contain the follow addenda -PRON- have just be learn that mr emmet gilhooly the multimillionaire and president of the railroad combine be a guest of professor quinn last night and must have be in the castle at the very moment -PRON- fade into oblivion 
mr gilhooly do not return to -PRON- home and have not since be hear from 
-PRON- relative be distracted and lead railroad man of the country be in a panic 
-PRON- absence from affair at the present moment jeopardize the traction interest of the entire country and may prove a deathblow to the success of the gigantic pool -PRON- be form 
this be startling news indeed and speed hither and yon throughout the city the country and the civilized world 
appal as the information be nevertheless -PRON- prove merely a fractional part of the truth 
the bright reporter on the mercury make further discovery which be print in the third edition rush from the press of -PRON- paper 
not only be mr emmet gilhooly a guest of professor quinn in the steel castle last night but so also be hon 
augustus popham the coal baron archibald meig of wall street late manipulator of the corner in wheat and now engineer a corner in cotton and hannibal markham well know as the instigator of a plot to control the food supply of the united state 
what have become of these four millionaire and napoleon of finance 
-PRON- have go with quinn and -PRON- castle disappearing as utterly as though the earth have open and swallow -PRON- 
fabulous reward be offer by the relative of the miss millionaire for any information relative to the fate that have overtake -PRON- 
foul play be suspect and the financial world stand aghast and dumbly wonder what be to happen to the business of the country if -PRON- really develop beyond all peradventure that gilhooly popham meig and markham have be eliminate from commercial affair 
the influence of these four be vast and farreaching and -PRON- be scheme to make -PRON- grip on the republic resource even more secure and relentless 
if -PRON- plan carry no man could eat or clothe -PRON- or warm -PRON- body and drive -PRON- manufacturing engine or travel from place to place and ship the product of -PRON- mill without pay tribute to gilhooly popham meig and markham 
should those scheme titanic in conception be work out to -PRON- manifest conclusion four man would hold the destiny of industrial america in the hollow of -PRON- hand 
prosperity would wait upon -PRON- pleasure or at a mere nod would be paralyze and leave the country strand on the reef of disaster 
-PRON- seem an odd fatality that at the very time these of industry be plot to make -PRON- power complete -PRON- should have vanish as utterly as though -PRON- have be engulf by a tidal wave and sweep into the broad region of the atlantic 
a few fact be bring to light through the probing of skilled detective mind but these fact be in nowise clue to the fate that have overtake the millionaire confidential aide reluctantly admit that -PRON- chief have accept an invitation from quinn and have go to -PRON- castle for an interview 
quinn profess to have make some discovery or other which -PRON- declare would make coal a useless commodity so far as human need be concern 
popham while laugh at pretension be nevertheless secretly worried 
anything that threaten the success of the coup which be be engineer by -PRON- and -PRON- three confrere be to be deal with decisively and without loss of time 
in the case of meigs markham and gilhooly there be no confidential aide to offer testimony for these bright particular star of high finance have place a limit on the confidence repose in -PRON- secretary 
nevertheless the probe mind at work on the case develop the extraordinary fact that these man no less than popham have visit quinn at the latter request 
a spirit of scoff investigation animate -PRON- but -PRON- be prepared to see with -PRON- own eye and hear with -PRON- own ear whatever quinn have to show and to say 
if anything that militate against -PRON- project coup be bring before -PRON- -PRON- would proceed to lay the spectre forthwith 
strangely enough the shrewd of the detective fail to connect the disappearance of the millionaire with the comprehensive plan -PRON- be form and which could not be carry out except by the plotter in person 
other rich man of the country who be will not to trim -PRON- sail in accordance with whatever wind blow from the office of the four in wall street be already shift affair to lay a course that would give -PRON- the good headway against the project new order 
this sudden disappearance of the power to which the less rich look for guidance leave -PRON- becalm in an uncharted sea 
the middle class long accustom to be mulct right and leave accept the astonishing situation with equanimity 
so far as -PRON- be concern gilhooly popham meig and markham be abstract generalitiesmerely name to conjure with 
for year the middle class have pay for the conjuring and have be teach to look calmly into the eye of what -PRON- have come to believe be the inevitable 
if -PRON- annual outing to the seashore or the mountain cost too much -PRON- could stay at home if the butcher the baker and the grocer run price too high some of the luxury could be cut out if anthracite go to a ton -PRON- would heat few room and if clothing become too expensive there would be few suit and gown to wear 
by a little selfdenial the middle class also could trim -PRON- sail to any gale that blow 
-PRON- be use to -PRON- 
with the poor -PRON- be different 
-PRON- be already down to bedrock in the way of selfdenial 
no sooner have -PRON- drift through -PRON- brain that the influence of gilhooly popham meig and markham have be blot out than -PRON- lift -PRON- voice in praise of the blessed event 
-PRON- situation have be bad enough and any change among the vaguely understand cause preside over -PRON- affair could hardly be for the bad 
the detective feel that -PRON- be at work on a particularly complex case hamper -PRON- by look for complex cause 
at first -PRON- believe -PRON- be a matter of sequestration and that presently a ransom in seven or eight figure would be call for 
however a delving into past fail to reveal any lawless action that would point to a ransom in -PRON- present line of endeavor 
the detective grow more complex as the ambiguity close -PRON- in overlook entirely the simplicity of character 
anyhow one analytical mind would demand of another what have intention to do with the disappearance 
that be a positive reality 
and although -PRON- be surmise -PRON- be not definitely know that quinn -PRON- have have anything to do with -PRON- 
such be the situation confront the country and with which the police department of new york city be call upon to deal 
but the keen reason inductive or deductive be powerless to find even a clue 
the tremendous mystery may have remain a mystery until this day have -PRON- not be for the narrative of jame peter munn now for the first time give to the world 
i use to be one of those who claim that the world owe -PRON- a living and i go out with a drill and a jimmy to collect -PRON- 
where be the difference i argue between the man who crack -PRON- strong box and remove a few paltry bill or coin and the nabob who skulk behind a trust and take -PRON- tax on the necessity of life 
this be pure sophistry of course but i become wed to -PRON- in early life and that i escape a suit of stripe and measurement on the bertillon system be due entirely to -PRON- experience with professor quinn 
twa a blessed night that send -PRON- to -PRON- castle with the view of mulct -PRON- of treasure i feel to be there 
quinn be a queer one 
i do not mean to say that -PRON- be unhinge as some thought but -PRON- be queer in -PRON- outlook upon life and in resource which fall under the head of way and mean 
-PRON- castle claim -PRON- professional attention 
for why should a man build a big steel vault and live in -PRON- unless -PRON- have portable property worth a burglar while 
i reconnoiter the place for a week before i consider -PRON- possess of sufficient knowledge for -PRON- undertaking 
in view of what transpire at the time of -PRON- visit a brief description of the castle take from -PRON- memorandum book will prove of interest 
the structure be cigarshape twentynine foot from base to apex and twenty foot in diameter through -PRON- large part 
-PRON- be divide into two story by mean of a steel floor leave headroom of ten foot in the low story 
four window pierce the circular wall of the neth room and two give light to the room above these six opening be guard on the outer side with latticework of steel 
the door be an oblong piece of boiler platethe entire building be a shell compose of plate rivet togetherhinge heavily and provide with a strong lock 
as i have yet to find a lock which i could not pick if give time enough -PRON- design naturally centre about the door 
i have hit upon the somewhat early hour of ten in the evening for -PRON- call at the professor 
unless business keep -PRON- abroad i know that -PRON- be usually in bed long before that time 
if -PRON- chance to be out so much the well for the success of -PRON- foray 
after the patrolman have pass i creep through the bush and be soon busy with the lock on the steel door 
-PRON- yield with much less resistance than i have anticipate and i be quickly within flash -PRON- lantern about -PRON- 
a circular seat upholstered in leather run around the wall and a table bear an unlighted oil lamp stand in the centre of the floor 
i have barely complete a hasty survey when a crunch of footstep on the gravel walk without smote on -PRON- ear 
without loss of a moment i snap the lantern shut and dart up the iron stairway to the room above 
-PRON- be needless to say that i be very much put out because of the interruption 
i be a hard man in those day and such an occurrence be apt to anger -PRON- and make -PRON- say thing 
lie flat on the floor with -PRON- face to the stair opening i have a fairly good view of the circular chamber below 
the professor have be abroad and not in bed for -PRON- appear now usher in caller 
four gentleman all of distinguished mien and important bearing follow the owner of the castle and begin glance about with illconceale amusement 
gad but this be an odd place exclaim one 
this gentleman wear a frock coat and silk hat but what catch -PRON- eye be a fourcarat spark in -PRON- scarf a massive seal on -PRON- fob and a scintillating gem on the third finger of -PRON- left hand 
odd perhaps return the professor but most suitable to -PRON- purpose mr gilhooly as i hope to show -PRON- before many minute have pass 
be seat sir 
and the rest of -PRON- gentleman -PRON- will find the divan most comfortable 
gilhooly 
i go hot and cold at that name 
nearly everybody in new york be just then talk about the man who be scheme to make railroad travel too expensive for ordinary mortal 
-PRON- be a millionaire several time over and in the breast of -PRON- frock coat i know there must be a bulky wallet 
at once and while i watch and listen to those in the room below -PRON- mind busy -PRON- with detail of a more comprehensive operation than i have at first contemplate 
the professor four guest have seat -PRON- on the circular divan 
after -PRON- eye have finish with gilhooly -PRON- turn on the other three and -PRON- first impression be more than confirm 
each of the quartet be a croesus and dressed and strut the part 
fine bird indeed and i hug -PRON- to think how opportunity have come knock at -PRON- door in hand i could descend upon this covey compel a readjustment of value between -PRON- and -PRON- then back through the steel door lock -PRON- behind -PRON- and make off 
the professor intent on other thing no doubt have turn -PRON- key in the lock and have fail to discover that the bolt be already throw therefore -PRON- presence in the castle be entirely unsuspectedmanifestly an advantage 
-PRON- have ask -PRON- to come here professor quinn speak up one as the professor turn higher the wick of the lamp -PRON- have just light and here -PRON- be 
-PRON- say -PRON- have discover something whose value to science and the industrial world be beyond compute and that -PRON- wish to interest capital the speaker survey -PRON- three companion with a large be the capital shall come at -PRON- discovery in due course mr popham say the professor who be a wiry little man with a bald head and beadlike black eye thank -PRON- for come here 
emmet gilhooly augustus popham archibald meig and hannibal markham be star of the first magnitude in the sky of speculation and i esteem -PRON- fortunate in arouse -PRON- interest 
a faintness seize -PRON- as these name each an open sesame to the world of finance fall glibly from the professor tongue 
i be all but cheek by jowl with representative of billion 
augustus popham turn -PRON- head to give emmet gilhooly a plebeian wink 
gilhooly smile behind -PRON- smooth white hand 
archibald meig lean over to whisper something to hannibal markham who be affix a pair of gold eyeglass to -PRON- roman nose whereupon both gentleman suppress a titter 
a doubt of the sincerity of all four break over -PRON- 
-PRON- be there to have sport with this bald little man with the beady eye and the bee in -PRON- bonnet 
i chuckle grimly as i think of how the table would presently be turn 
i do not know whether the professor be as keen as i to detect these evidence of insincerity 
if -PRON- be -PRON- give no sign be sixtyfive say -PRON- and -PRON- life work have be the discovery which i be about to bring to -PRON- august attention 
perhaps some of -PRON- gentleman have read -PRON- paper on the mutability of newtonian law 
the gentleman acknowledge that -PRON- have not 
professor quinn seem disappointed 
if -PRON- have read that -PRON- continue -PRON- would have prepare yourself for an understanding of -PRON- theory and the demonstration of -PRON- which i be about to give 
let -PRON- ask -PRON- this when an apple leave -PRON- parent branch why be -PRON- that -PRON- fall downward instead of upward 
the napoleon of finance stare at one another 
archibald meig go so far as to tap a suggestive finger against -PRON- forehead 
gravity say the professor 
-PRON- be that which draw every atom on the surface of the earth directly toward the earth centre -PRON- be that which chain -PRON- foot to this planet and keep -PRON- from fall through interstellar space -PRON- be even that which keep -PRON- little world from fly apart and dissipate -PRON- in dust throughout the great void 
-PRON- be a simple proposition simply state and i trust -PRON- follow -PRON- 
-PRON- do follow -PRON- and so signified 
in the paper i read before the astronomical society pursue the professor make bold to declare that -PRON- be possible to insulate a body against the force of gravitation 
in other word to make -PRON- so immune from newtonian law that -PRON- would spurn the earth and fall from -PRON- at a speed even great than the draw power of gravity 
can -PRON- not comprehend what this mean cry quinn waxing eloquent 
-PRON- mean a new force in the industrial worlda power that feed on nothing save a law that transcend that of gravitation 
in point of fact -PRON- fall little short of perpetual motion 
without the expenditure of even a pound of coal this new force can turn the wheel of every railroad train on the globe 
with -PRON- own inherent energy -PRON- can give life to the machinery of flour mill cotton mill iron foundry -PRON- can augustus popham get up hurriedly and put on -PRON- hat rattlebrained idea sir -PRON- exclaim have no mind to remain here and listen to such talk coal mine ravage the earth crust in a thousand and one place 
the idea that human industry could get along without -PRON- coal be too much for -PRON- 
before -PRON- could reach the door professor quinn be in front of -PRON- bar -PRON- way 
remember mr popham say the professor if i be to take away -PRON- mine i should yet give -PRON- something in -PRON- place worth incalculably more 
hear -PRON- out sir 
i beg of -PRON- 
theory be cheap thing mutter popham as -PRON- again seat -PRON- 
an ounce of proof be worth a pound of theory 
exactly cry quinn and the ounce of proof shall be forthcome 
with that -PRON- pull the table from the centre of the room reveal an iron chain some three foot in length attach at -PRON- low end to a staple in the floor by mean of a clevi and pin 
the chain be not lie loosely but be rigidly upright -PRON- upper end wind about a white blocka sixinch cube as i judge 
climb to the table top the professor step thence to the cube poise -PRON- for a moment on one foot 
then -PRON- spring to the floor again 
this cube -PRON- explain lay one hand on the block with an affectionate gesture be of steel and have be treat with -PRON- insulating compound 
to all appearance -PRON- be fall upward with a force sufficient to draw the chain rigidly to -PRON- full extent and to support -PRON- weight 
poppycock mutter the coal baron trick exclaim meig 
the other two remain silent 
-PRON- be bewilder perhaps impress 
let -PRON- see whether -PRON- be a trick or no go on quinn 
pray come forward gentleman and lay hold of the chain 
there be no danger in the little experiment with which i be go to amuse -PRON- and i think -PRON- will dispel -PRON- doubt 
the gentleman hesitate but finally come forward get down with some difficulty and grasp the chain as direct 
hold tight exclaim the professor and draw the pin from the clevi 
thus release the cube rise to the ceiling lift the four gentleman with -PRON- 
-PRON- hang in midair until quinn draw the table under -PRON- and -PRON- drop to -PRON- top each in turn and so reach the floor 
bewilderment be write large in the face of the quartet -PRON- credulity struggle against the evidence of -PRON- sense 
-PRON- be a good magician sir aver popham brush the damp from -PRON- forehead with a handkerchief 
-PRON- could make -PRON- fortune as an entertainer declare gilhooly 
archibald meig chew briskly on an unlighted cigar while hannibal markham keep -PRON- eye on the cube and dangle chain like one fascinate 
-PRON- be the fate of a man who make startling discovery to be class among disciple in black art observe quinn calmly 
what be the hour mr gilhooly -PRON- ask 
the head of the railway pool consult -PRON- repeater -PRON- reply 
and high time i be go add popham 
just a few moment more say the professor 
turn to the wall behind -PRON- -PRON- catch a small lever and turn -PRON- over as far as -PRON- would go 
the castle vibrate slightly communicate a perceptible swaying motion to the pendent chain this cry markham jump up 
do not be alarm -PRON- friend cry quinn whirl around 
-PRON- face be pallid as death and -PRON- beady eye gleam like coal 
then wonder of wonder the white cube settle to the floor 
ha shouted popham 
-PRON- antigravity compound be not very long live -PRON- seem to -PRON- 
-PRON- will find differently to -PRON- cost return the professor through -PRON- tooth 
augustus popham kenward quinn arraign -PRON- and emmet gilhooly and archibald meig and hannibal markham as foe of the human race 
-PRON- be leech who would suck the lifeblood from the vein of the poor with steady forefinger quinn have transfix each of the plutocrat as -PRON- call -PRON- name 
markham be already on -PRON- foot and the other three be not slow in follow -PRON- this what s this gasp gilhooly 
an insult mutter popham 
the old addlepate be not accountable for what -PRON- say or do remark archibald meig 
-PRON- have best leave this steel trap of -PRON- while there be yet time counsel markham 
while there be yet time repeat quinn with a wild laugh pretty set of conspirator -PRON- be on -PRON- soul 
markham there would raise the price of food until the poor would go hungry -PRON- meig would so manipulate the cost of clothing that -PRON- would not have the wherewithal to cover -PRON- nakedness popham would make fuel a luxury of the rich and gilhooly would so boost passenger and freight rate as to quadruple to the consumer the tremendous cost of the necessity of life 
deny -PRON- if -PRON- can if -PRON- dare 
quinn look like a nemesis as -PRON- confront the four man and lash -PRON- with -PRON- scorpion whip of word 
fiddlededee exclaimed popham 
-PRON- deserve -PRON- say meig for -PRON- be the height of folly for -PRON- to come here in the first place 
be this why -PRON- bring -PRON- here ask markham to air -PRON- own particular idea on sociology and to make -PRON- the victim of -PRON- abuse 
the professor throw back -PRON- head and straighten -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- be the real thing in dignity that -PRON- show those plutocrat and -PRON- nerve tingle with admiration 
i be sorry i have come to the castle with design oh portable property and doubly glad that i could force tribute from these four who be badger -PRON- be not unjust aver the professor and such a thing as abuse be farth from -PRON- mind but i love the plain people the bone and sinew of this glorious republic and -PRON- arouse -PRON- indignation when the right to live and let live be trample upon by any one man or set of man 
platitude sneer popham 
to call a truth a platitude be witless argument answer quinn serenely 
be that as -PRON- may say meig -PRON- be not invite here for a debate but to witness a demonstration of what -PRON- be pleased to term a revolutionize discovery 
-PRON- have see -PRON- overcome the force of gravity go on the professor and to astute mind like yours further explanation seem uncalled for 
in destroy gravity i produce a power equal by no other force in the world 
the pull of an insulate block the size of that here -PRON- wave -PRON- hand toward the equal to the strength of a hundred horse 
develop that pull horizontally instead of vertically and -PRON- have a locomotive that run continuously without the consumption of a pound of coal 
that cry the professor -PRON- voice ring with triumph be the apotheosis of power 
gilhooly judge from -PRON- manner be the victim of uncomfortable thought meig wear a startled look and markham seem half convinced 
popham alone be brusque and uncompromising think -PRON- have well get out of here again suggest markham 
-PRON- half conviction appear to arouse some small amount of apprehension of the same opinion speak up meigs 
wait a little suggested popham and i see a gleam in -PRON- eye that mean a stroke of some kind 
once more -PRON- face quinn have no patience with -PRON- harebrained theory -PRON- go on and i have see charlatan work great wonder than what -PRON- be pleased to call -PRON- demonstration 
but -PRON- be a business principle of -PRON- to buy up these promising theory if -PRON- happen to run counter to any pet scheme i be try to put through 
sir rather than be annoy further with this chimerical idea of your i will pay five thousand dollar spot cash just to have -PRON- give over -PRON- notion and quit experiment 
professor quinn laugh 
five thousand dollar -PRON- exclaim then add as though to -PRON- -PRON- would have -PRON- sell the welfare and happiness of the people for five thousand dollar will add another five thousand to offer put in gilhooly not because i be afraid -PRON- discovery will upset the transportation interest of the country but simply to clear the commercial atmosphere and keep -PRON- visionary idea from affect the price of stock 
let -PRON- add another five thousand say meigs donot see how -PRON- invention even if -PRON- be all -PRON- claim for -PRON- could affect -PRON- or -PRON- interest one way or the other but i will add -PRON- contribution simply because popham have take the initiative 
count -PRON- in for the same amount supplement markham on the condition that professor quinn sign over to the four of -PRON- all -PRON- right title and interest in -PRON- nongravity invention and covenant to leave that field entirely alone in future 
quinn seem to enjoy these proposition and -PRON- be apparent at a glance that -PRON- have no intention of accept twenty thousand dollar and renounce -PRON- discovery 
gentleman say -PRON- -PRON- be already half convinced that i be no dreamer for -PRON- be financier and while twenty thousand dollar be no more to -PRON- than twenty cent be to -PRON- -PRON- be not -PRON- habit to give -PRON- money away 
i repeat that -PRON- be inclined to have faith in -PRON- and before many minute i shall have make -PRON- belief in -PRON- ability complete 
be i to understand that -PRON- decline -PRON- offer demand popham 
most decidedly 
then there be nothing more to be say 
come on gentleman and popham start toward the door moment more if -PRON- please request the professor 
not another second cried popham 
-PRON- offer be withdraw and if -PRON- socalled discovery amount to anything -PRON- shall find other mean for make -PRON- ineffective 
i have be interested in proceeding to an extent that have all but cause -PRON- to forget -PRON- purpose 
the plutocrat be about to leave the castle in a temper and if i wrest tribute from -PRON- -PRON- must be now or never 
start up i draw -PRON- revolver and run hastily down the iron stair 
-PRON- unexpected advent upon the scene prove as startling as i have anticipate 
even the professor be dash 
step in front of the steel door i toy menacingly with the revolver and survey the plutocrat with a grim humor i make no attempt to conceal 
at that period of -PRON- life inspire by the sophistry to which i have already advert i be a cool and dangerous man 
pardon -PRON- for enter unannounce say i blindly 
-PRON- have listen to professor theory and witness -PRON- demonstration 
i be but an humble philosopher yet i have a theory of -PRON- own which i should also like to expound and to demonstrate 
who be -PRON- sir demand quinn be a bird of like feather with these -PRON- guest say i facetiously albeit -PRON- method be more direct if less extensive 
-PRON- name be jam peter munn -PRON- specialty be robbery of the variety for i have the courage of -PRON- conviction and do not hide behind a technicality do not wish to intrude -PRON- presence here longer than necessary to accomplish -PRON- design and if these amiable gentleman will aid indicate the amiable gentleman with -PRON- revolver will take -PRON- departure quietly from the castle here i scowl trust or other will be minus -PRON- guide power in case any resistance be attempt 
the threat be sufficient and the usual sunny smile return to -PRON- face as i add mr gilhooly will advance to the table spread -PRON- handkerchief upon -PRON- and lie thereon -PRON- watch and fob the ring on -PRON- finger the kohinoor in -PRON- tie and the wallet in the breast of -PRON- coat 
-PRON- be -PRON- theory that one thief have the right to take from another property that do not belong to either of -PRON- 
-PRON- be mr privilege to give the first demonstration 
fidelity to truth force -PRON- to chronicle the above speech 
the clat with which i make -PRON- be far from -PRON- now as i pen -PRON- verbatim 
there be speech in life which -PRON- could wish unsaid and this one of mine i would give much to consign to the limbo of thing unspoken 
reformation have work wonder in -PRON- since that evil time 
i will say for mr gilhooly that -PRON- be alacrity -PRON- in carry out -PRON- command 
-PRON- hand tremble a little as -PRON- place -PRON- belonging on the handkerchief and knot the four corner over the plunder as i request 
the professor smile strangely sink down on the divan and watch proceeding with twinkling eye 
-PRON- manner fill -PRON- with a foreboding i try not to manifest 
evidently this amuse -PRON- cry gilhooly in anger -PRON- snap eye on the professor 
-PRON- inference be correct mr gilhooly answer quinn be profoundly amused 
-PRON- be all so unexpected so dramatic and souseless 
by gad sir cry popham see more in this than a desire on -PRON- part to interest capital in a fake discovery 
there be a plot here gentleman and -PRON- turn to the other three 
-PRON- folly in allow -PRON- to be lure to this place be stupendous 
i make no doubt but that there be a plot here between this man quinn and this thief 
quinn get -PRON- in the thiefs power and the thief do the rest pretty scheme snap meigs 
clever very clever put in markham 
and successful too growled gilhooly with a regretful look at the plunder on the table 
but there will be a reckon 
when -PRON- be once clear of this place -PRON- can set the police at work 
i be surprised at the way quinn take this talk 
-PRON- continue to smile and be in no way ruffle wrong there cry hot and indignant 
professor quinn have nothing to do with -PRON- being here have -PRON- eye on this castle for a long while and i let -PRON- in just before -PRON- come hope to make a haul and get clear 
-PRON- interrupt -PRON- and i stow -PRON- away upstairs 
from what i see and hear i must say that -PRON- be a pleasure for -PRON- to turn -PRON- back on professor property and to give -PRON- entire attention to -PRON- four 
mr munn say quinn how long have -PRON- be engage in this business 
for some year now sir i answer 
-PRON- be honestonce 
every man be bear honest if -PRON- come to that 
i use to work in an iron foundry but the work be take over by a combination and a lot of -PRON- be throw out of employment 
there be nothing for -PRON- to do but begand above that 
this come handiest and i go into -PRON- 
i like the business 
match one wit against the law keep one constantly in the midst of alarm so to speak and i like excitement 
and i have ability for never yet have i wear the stripe or learn the lockstep 
i have write some on the subject of -PRON- vocation in the hope of beguile other into the work dangerous man mutter gilhooly 
what be -PRON- come to clamored popham 
here be a thief who be actually proud of -PRON- profession and who actually write book about -PRON- 
merciful heaven gasp meig in horror feel sorry for -PRON- country when -PRON- produce such man be totter on the verge of chaos add markham in a stage whisper 
i laugh at all this for i enjoy -PRON- hugely 
spare yourself any needless worry about -PRON- gentleman say look to home and -PRON- will probably find enough there to fret -PRON- conscience 
professor quinn continue to take pleasure out of the queer situation can honor a man like munn say -PRON- where i be tempt to despise man like -PRON- gilhooly meig markham and popham 
as munn say -PRON- have the courage of -PRON- conviction 
-PRON- do not take from the poor for in the very nature of thing -PRON- can not 
-PRON- loot come from those who be able to lose -PRON- while -PRON- be vampire and sap the very lifeblood of the nation 
-PRON- be all criminally delude although perhaps do what -PRON- conscientiously believe to be exactly right 
would to heaven and here the professor grow suddenly sincere and intensely earnest that something would conspire to open -PRON- eye to the exact truth 
but i have despair of that and i be try in -PRON- own feeble way to meet the present emergency 
-PRON- be either a fool or a madman cry popham rattlebraine zealot chime in meigs 
-PRON- be the one who should see thing differently say markham 
-PRON- preach a doctrine which -PRON- fail to apply personally 
enough of this talk gentleman i interpose 
-PRON- situation be precarious and i must ask -PRON- to hurry a little 
sir shout popham level a forefinger at -PRON- shall see -PRON- properly jail for this 
why -PRON- miserable footpad i can save -PRON- breath i interrupt tartly meet -PRON- forefinger with the muzzle of the pepper box 
lead be no respecter of person 
one of -PRON- have call -PRON- a dangerous man 
i be all of that and desperate 
mr popham -PRON- see how mr gilhooly carry out -PRON- order 
-PRON- will proceed in the same manner and without further loss of time 
in five minute i must be out of here 
-PRON- start to argue the point with -PRON- and i allow -PRON- forefinger to flex ever so slightly upon the trigger 
that be enough 
a man value -PRON- life in a direct ratio with what -PRON- consider -PRON- importance therefore the esteem in which these four millionaire hold -PRON- must have be overwhelm 
the honorable augustus popham finally yield up -PRON- personal property with the same readiness that have characterize -PRON- friend 
hannibal markham follow -PRON- and after markham come archibald meig 
i have a pleasant word for each as i marshal the four bundle string -PRON- on the finger of -PRON- left hand and back toward the door which be a few pace behind -PRON- 
when a good general beat a retreat say prepare to pull open the door and let -PRON- out -PRON- place as many obstacle in the path of the pursue force as possible 
when i leave therefore i shall lock this door on the outside 
i be watch by the plutocrat in philosophical silence by the professor with a geniality that nothing seem able to shake 
i have spare quinn because -PRON- be a friend of the poor as i have discover 
and i have be poor -PRON- some fifteen minute back say i airily 
au revoir answer the professor 
look well where -PRON- step 
i throw open the door with a laugh 
the laugh fade into a shout of terror 
i throw out -PRON- hand revolver and packet of loot fall through the door and i only barely save -PRON- with one foot over the threshold 
the horror that grip -PRON- then be such a horror as come to a man but once in a lifetime 
-PRON- brain sicken and chill -PRON- heart all but stop -PRON- beating and -PRON- limb grow rigid 
in the black of the fearsome nightnot the atmospheric blueblack i have be accustom to but the ebony dark of erebusi see a wild greenish star below a huge disk whose gleam nimbus dance on -PRON- sight in quiver line 
half craze i fling back into the room and fall grovel to the floor -PRON- ear echo with the professor merriment and the startled exclamation of the four man i have robbedall to no purpose 
presently i sit up rub forehead and eye 
the professor stand in the open door gloat over the vista below 
come -PRON- call beckon to the huddled quartet at the other side of the room 
come gilhooly meigs popham and look down upon the scene of -PRON- feverish activity 
-PRON- be plutocrat there more powerful than king 
here -PRON- be no more than shoulder high with -PRON- and yon muddle thief on the floor 
-PRON- have be snatch from the scene of -PRON- pernicious laborsexile into planetary space where -PRON- will be powerless to work further evil 
i have not live in vain for this this be the triumph of -PRON- career 
slowly meig disentangle -PRON- from the mute group by the opposite wall and creep on all four to the threshold that overlook the void and the greenish star 
-PRON- recoil with a yell then madden by what -PRON- have see -PRON- leap erect and try to hurl -PRON- out into space 
fool cry the professor lay hold of -PRON- and struggle to keep -PRON- back 
would -PRON- become a satellite of this planet 
-PRON- be beyond the atmosphere of the earthlook 
see the four packet of loot and the thief revolver 
-PRON- point through the door and the bulge handkerchief and -PRON- sixshooter be abreast of -PRON- hang in space turn slowly weirdlya sight to upset the strong mind 
gilhooly jump forward give vent to a maniacal laugh then crumple down on the floor 
bid up for the -PRON- mumble bid to the limit 
i must have that will have -PRON- 
brace up meig say the professor sharply pull the key from the outer side of the lock slam the door fasten -PRON- and put the key in -PRON- pocket 
take care of gilhooly man 
-PRON- mind falter 
heaven be -PRON- all mad 
be -PRON- keen mind unshaken in the contemplation of vast deal for the enslavement of the poor so quick to break 
i have think well of -PRON- than this 
meig white as the spotless linen that cover -PRON- breast advance upon the professor 
-PRON- try to speak but without success 
at last with a supreme effort the word come madman what have -PRON- do 
that be better return the professor smile as -PRON- look at meig and note how markham and popham range -PRON- at -PRON- side much well 
-PRON- be engage in plot back there on the earth and the success of those plot would have prove a great calamity 
i have save the world from the calamity castle have rise from the earth ask meigs 
-PRON- have fall off the earth 
as -PRON- and i and the other happen to be inside -PRON- fall with -PRON- 
sudden rage convulse meig 
-PRON- crouch downward -PRON- eye ablaze and -PRON- finger work convulsively 
scoundrel -PRON- scream and launch -PRON- at the professor throat like a tiger 
look back now at that dreadful hour when the realization of -PRON- awful predicament burst upon -PRON- i wonder that i preserve -PRON- own equilibrium 
the first shock come near to throw -PRON- off -PRON- poise but after that i gain the whip hand of -PRON- wit by swift and sure degree 
i verily believe the professor would have be strangle by meig aid and abet by popham and markham have i not rush to -PRON- rescue 
i have muscle of iron and after i have catch meig by the nape of the neck and throw -PRON- backward i plant -PRON- between quinn and -PRON- foe 
leave the professor alone say -PRON- man show mighty poor judgment -PRON- strike -PRON- in try to lay violent hand on -PRON- 
-PRON- deserve death babble meig 
-PRON- have no business shoot -PRON- into space in this summary manner 
fear and anger have make meigs childish 
-PRON- measure -PRON- dilemma in term so common a smile come to -PRON- lip 
judgment poor judgment sniffed popham 
look at gilhooly and then talk about poor judgment if -PRON- can 
in truth the railway magnate present a sorry spectacle 
-PRON- clothing be in wild disorder -PRON- hair be rumple about -PRON- head and -PRON- be hop back and forth with two finger in the air 
-PRON- be under the impression that -PRON- be deal in railroad stock complete the huge transaction that have make -PRON- the talk of two continent 
this professor ought to be flay alive declare markham 
where be -PRON- go and when will -PRON- get there 
now say -PRON- be strike the keynote 
who know where -PRON- be go if the professor doesnot 
and who know when -PRON- shall arrive there if -PRON- be out of -PRON- power to tell 
-PRON- need the professor for if -PRON- be to be save -PRON- will be -PRON- knowledge that do -PRON- 
but what will -PRON- family think whimper meig 
and -PRON- business interest 
-PRON- throw up -PRON- hand and fall back in -PRON- seat with a groan 
then abruptly -PRON- straighten up again 
this be a dream 
by gad -PRON- must be 
the whole affair be too outrageously unreal for any sane man to believe 
gilhooly give a maudlin chuckle be dead sure get that last block of stock 
that road be the last span in -PRON- network of tie and rail 
ha 
now well see 
now meig shiver maundering strike sharply at -PRON- desire to coddle -PRON- with a myth awful to have gilhooly like that speak up augustus popham 
if -PRON- have not be throw out of balance -PRON- wide knowledge of matter relate to transportation may have prove of inestimable service to -PRON- now 
professor quinn laugh 
-PRON- be an eerie laugh and -PRON- shake -PRON- to hear -PRON- 
oh -PRON- cry markham reproachfully whirl on quinn 
after cause this disaster and overthrow as brilliant a mind as there ever be in wall street -PRON- have the heart to indulge in levity 
look here how far be -PRON- from the earth at the present moment 
that be a difficult matter to estimate even approximately answer quinn calmly 
ordinarily gravity exert a force that can be measure definitely on the earth surface 
a body fall freely from rest acquire a velocity which be equal to the product of thirtytwo and onefifth foot and the number of second during which the motion have last 
what be the time now 
three gentleman reach for -PRON- watch fail to find -PRON- and turn hard look on -PRON- 
i appreciate -PRON- dilemma and draw from -PRON- vest an openface timepiece that be personal property and honestly come by 
-PRON- be twelvefifteen say quinn take a pencil and notebook from -PRON- pocket and do some figuring 
-PRON- may be a little more than two mile from -PRON- native planet say -PRON- but only two mile cry the three exile in chorus 
-PRON- can take -PRON- back sir say popham who have be pace the floor nervously 
shut off the power of this infernal machine and let -PRON- drop back to where -PRON- belong 
two mile be no great matter 
-PRON- castle be a slow freight compare with some of express train can not take -PRON- back sir return the professor and i would not if i could 
-PRON- do not hear -PRON- out 
the law of velocity recite for -PRON- benefit a moment ago do not measure the speed of this car 
no murmured markham 
decidedly not 
the earth sweep along in -PRON- orbit at the rate of eighteen mile to the second while some aerolite and meteoroid attain a speed of twenty and thirty mile to the second 
in build this car i equip -PRON- with an antigravity block gear up to fifty mile to the second 
the lever on the here quinn turn and point to throw so as to give -PRON- the maximum 
in other word say popham feebly -PRON- be sail skyward at a rate ofof three thousand mile perper minute 
presumably 
as -PRON- leave -PRON- city lot in new york at about elevenfifteen -PRON- follow that -PRON- have be one hour on the way 
and should be one hundred and eighty thousand mile from home falter meigs 
about that answer the professor calmly do not know just how much -PRON- progress be impede by the atmospheric envelope of the earth but i think -PRON- may call -PRON- distance from the mother orb some one hundred and eighty thousand mile in round number 
these startling figure come near to unsettle the three gentleman again 
in that flight through space -PRON- be confront immensity wellnigh beyond -PRON- puny comprehension 
and the professor be not yet do 
in the storeroom overhead -PRON- continue have a supply of cube and insulating compound which i can combine and give tremendous add velocity to the car be sure -PRON- be travel fast enough say meig lean back on the divan hopelessly deject 
if -PRON- be now ready to listen to reason proceed quinn will tell -PRON- how mr munn here save -PRON- life by rescue -PRON- from -PRON- mad attack 
-PRON- life forsooth exclaim markham bitterly 
of what value be life to -PRON- situate as -PRON- be 
that be one way to look at -PRON- of course rejoin quinn caustically 
but i do not exile -PRON- into planetary space for the purpose of wipe -PRON- out of existence 
-PRON- may as well have do so say popham severely 
that be what this harumscarum plot of yours amount to in the long run 
-PRON- may not care to learn how i be preserve -PRON- at the present moment continue quinn nor how i shall do so in the future yet i will tell -PRON- so that -PRON- may understand how much -PRON- owe to mr foresight and courage 
i be begin to entertain a high regard for quinn in spite of what -PRON- have do 
-PRON- may have be labor under terrible delusion but -PRON- resource certainly command respect 
to -PRON- forethought -PRON- continue be due the fact that -PRON- be breathe oxygen at this moment and have i not invent a liquid which fortifie animate or inanimate body against heat and cold -PRON- rush through the atmosphere of the earth would have incinerate this car and -PRON- contentsnay would have cause -PRON- to explode and settle back on -PRON- native planet in impalpable powder 
these be thing that none of -PRON- aside from the professor have so much as take thought of 
-PRON- respect for -PRON- be grow into something like awe and i fancy i detect trace of the same sentiment in the other three 
there be rove body in space quinn go on note with apparent satisfaction the interest -PRON- have arouse with which -PRON- may come into collision 
i have a good telescope at the observatory window upstairs and while i can not guide this car i can at least increase or slacken -PRON- speed so as to dodge any other derelict that may come into dangerous proximity with -PRON- -PRON- better be up there on the lookout query markham in some trepidation 
-PRON- be manifest an interest in -PRON- personal safety that please the professor 
there be not much danger at present return quinn 
when -PRON- have plunge farther into the interstellar void -PRON- will be well to stand watch and watch about at the telescope 
will -PRON- not be possible to land on some other planet mar for instance query popham with sudden hope should prefer mar add meig reflect the hope show in -PRON- friend face 
-PRON- have be signal from mar and perhaps -PRON- can find out what -PRON- want over there 
quinn shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- be in the hand of fate gentleman say -PRON- 
-PRON- may drop into some port but what that port will be be beyond -PRON- power even to surmise 
the moon isnot so far off suggest markham 
only two hundred and forty thousand mile say quinn 
-PRON- should be there in less than two hour from the time of start remark meig after a mental bout with the figure 
if i wish say quinn could increase -PRON- speed travel at the rate -PRON- be however something will have to be deduct for the resistance of the earth atmosphere 
if -PRON- drop on a planet -PRON- must be a planet with an atmosphere 
the moon have none and consequently be a dead world 
besides fate may not throw -PRON- into -PRON- vicinity or just a minute sir interpose markham for i be a man who like to understand thoroughly every situation with which -PRON- be call upon to deal 
-PRON- invite -PRON- to -PRON- castle not i be constrain to believe to have -PRON- victimize by munn here nor to have -PRON- invest in any of -PRON- discovery but to snatch -PRON- away from the scene of -PRON- labor 
be that correct professor quinn 
entirely so mr markham reply quinn 
evidently proceed markham -PRON- plot have cost -PRON- some time and labor 
-PRON- have first to find -PRON- gravityresisting compound the plot follow as a result of -PRON- discovery smile the professor do not first evolve the plot and then go search for mean to get -PRON- off the earth 
when i have make the discovery -PRON- remain for -PRON- to give -PRON- to the worldor to better the world by take -PRON- four gentleman away from -PRON- 
have i give the public the benefit -PRON- shrewd man of affair may have devise mean for set -PRON- aside or for control -PRON- 
not be a business man -PRON- i fear to take chance 
for that reason the present enterprise appeal to -PRON- 
-PRON- have plan so well in the small detail that i wonder -PRON- overlook the main point 
and that be what -PRON- be go to do with -PRON- now that -PRON- plan have succeed 
the professor toss -PRON- hand deprecatingly as though that be really the most insignificant part of -PRON- startling scheme 
-PRON- canot go bob around through interstellar space grumble popham donot relish the idea of be cribbed cabin and confine in a steel room indefinitely 
i should go mad from the very thought awful to contemplate say meig cast a melancholy glance through the iron latticework at one of the window 
the bag of loot be in that vicinity at the moment and -PRON- glance swerve reproachfully to -PRON- 
-PRON- shall make a landing i have no doubt say the professor soothingly somehow and somewhere 
by gad sir cry popham bring -PRON- fist emphatically down on the table donot like such a way of do thing 
whenever i set out to accomplish anything the goal be always clear in -PRON- mind yet here i be through no desire of -PRON- own afloat in the great void without a single aim or a remote prospect 
if -PRON- be go to land anywhereand -PRON- remain firm in -PRON- decision not to take -PRON- back to -PRON- native demand that -PRON- make landfall on some orb that be worth while 
very good popham approve meigs 
unless i be greatly mistaken that be the very idea markham have in mind when -PRON- begin question the professor 
eh markham 
-PRON- be reply markham full knowledge of where -PRON- be go be necessary to a thorough understanding of remarkable situation 
now there be world large than the one -PRON- have recently leave 
personally i be predispose in favor of a large planetone on which there be traction interest fuel supply and product of the soil similar to those -PRON- have be accustom to 
under the spell of word popham begin to glow and expand 
meig all attention press a little close 
the big the planet the big -PRON- field of operation cry popham the matter with jupiter 
or saturn echo meigs 
or neptune put in markham the matter with the whole solar system inquire quinn with gentle irony 
-PRON- turn to -PRON- 
observe mr munn how extravagant be the idea inspire by monopoly 
these gentleman be hardly start on -PRON- journey into space before -PRON- forget the business interest the friend and the environment -PRON- be leave behind and begin plan the commercial conquest of the star 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head forebodingly 
-PRON- regeneration -PRON- add to the millionaire call for a landing on some barren world some outcast of the solar system where -PRON- will have nothing to do but think over the evil of -PRON- past and learn something of the duty -PRON- owe -PRON- fellowmen 
popham markham and meig be visibly annoy by the professor remark 
withdraw as far as the limit of the steel structure would allow -PRON- put -PRON- head together and hold a brief but animate conversation in tone so low that the professor and i could not overhear 
think of that professor 
i mutter 
and yet there be people who find fault with a respectable burglar 
softly mr munn return quinn 
before -PRON- be do with this journey i be fain to believe that all of -PRON- will have a different outlook upon life and a high regard for -PRON- duty of citizenship 
just then popham turn from -PRON- friend and step toward the professor 
-PRON- manner be truculentprobably just such a manner as -PRON- be accustomed to use in face a board of obstinate director 
if -PRON- will not return -PRON- to -PRON- native planet professor quinn say -PRON- sharply then -PRON- shall stand upon -PRON- right 
-PRON- be unalterably oppose to land upon any orb whose diameter measure less than at that instant a most astounding thing happen 
the car duck sideways throw the whole structure out of plumb 
loose article begin to drop from shelf and other place and to slide across the floor to the low point 
by a quick movement i save the lamp and brace -PRON- in an upright position 
cry of terror go up from markham meig and popham 
gilhooly shout the professor 
-PRON- be answer by a wild yell from overhead in the storeroom cry quinn 
follow -PRON- with that lamp the professor rush for the stairway and i make after -PRON- with what speed i could 
there never live a man i suppose who do not at some time or other in -PRON- career submit -PRON- veracity to question 
a reformed burglar therefore although animate by the most disinterested motive can scarcely hope to escape the shaft of the incredulous 
although wellgrounde in the science of cracksmanship and with some store of legal learning as to alibis and so forth -PRON- mind be as empty of astronomical lore as a drained bottle 
the professor saying be jot down in a sort of commonplace book at a later day when leisure offer 
memory may have play -PRON- false in some few minor point but in all of major importance this narrative be to be take with the same sincerity in which -PRON- be write 
i ask no more of the reader than that and if -PRON- be not averse to stroll through unfrequented way touch elbow with a man who have a past -PRON- shall get along famously 
to return then to the steel car and the obliquity -PRON- suddenly present to the direction of -PRON- course 
startling disclosure have somewhat obscure gilhooly and -PRON- have vanish from the low room without be miss 
for a man of sixtyfive the professor be very agile and -PRON- take the winding iron stairway two step at a time 
i gain the storeroom close behind -PRON- and there -PRON- find gilhooly croon to -PRON- and work like mad 
-PRON- be not work in the dark but have possess -PRON- of -PRON- lantern which i have leave on descend from the loft some time before 
mount on a pile of pack case -PRON- be engage in paint a large steel cube take -PRON- pigment from an open cask with a whitewash brush 
-PRON- antigravity compound exclaim the professor in an irritated tone 
there be several block on the floor as -PRON- can see gilhooly begin paint that one and -PRON- rise as insulation proceed lodge to the left of the dome and tilt the car 
this be the shabby lot of coach i ever see in -PRON- life say gilhooly dab away with the brush wonot own a road with such rolling stock 
the three man downstair have follow quinn and -PRON- 
after some coax meig get gilhooly to descend from -PRON- perch and give up the whitewash brush 
thereupon the cube be pry over until -PRON- rest directly under another block in the point of the dome and the professor finish the insulation begin by the railway magnate 
gilhooly will have to be watch say quinn or -PRON- will play havoc with the material i have store up here 
-PRON- have waste at least a quart of that antigravity mixture and -PRON- be worth -PRON- weight in gold 
nay -PRON- be worth more than that for after this supply be exhaust there will be none to be have for love or money 
-PRON- rate of speed have be multiply by two and -PRON- be rush through space with frightful rapidity 
there be -PRON- the professor point to the instrument which stand beneath a window in the slope roof of the car 
suppose gilhooly have demolish that 
or what if -PRON- have wreck the oxygen vat or the antitemperature reservoir 
gentleman i shudder to think of what may have happen 
the professor sink down on a copper tank and brush -PRON- perspiring brow with a bandanna handkerchief 
i place the lamp on a box beside the lantern and recline on a bale of something or other that lie conveniently near 
meig and popham drop down on a packing case with gilhooly moor between -PRON- and markham take up -PRON- station on an overturn cask 
the loft of the car store as -PRON- be with odd and end of science together with a supply of provision make ready for -PRON- by the farsighted and wonderful man who be conduct this select party into the unknown be an object of deep solicitude and interest 
out of a desire to tag the various material understandingly i lift the lid of -PRON- curiosity and let out a few question 
if i mistake not say -PRON- mention this antitemperature material once before 
what be -PRON- professor liquid -PRON- answer amiably 
as a discovery -PRON- be outrank only by -PRON- antigravity compound 
an ounce of the fluid in a bath render the bather impervious to heat or cold keeping in the animal caloric and keep out all other extreme of temperature 
some of the mixture be incorporate into the paint with which this car be coat 
yonder be the water receptacle and the professor nod toward a large tank opposite -PRON- 
with economy the supply in that reservoir will last -PRON- several month 
the food i have provide be of the readyprepare kind mostly in tin with an alcohol lamp for the brewing of tea coffee and chocolate 
during this hegira into infinity i have omit nothing gentleman which will minister to -PRON- comfort 
-PRON- be a very able man professor acknowledge popham 
how long have -PRON- be plan this little excursion 
ever since i begin erect what the harlemite be pleased to call -PRON- castle smile quinn 
the plan be conceive at the time the success of the manipulation of -PRON- and -PRON- friend seem assured 
-PRON- be -PRON- purpose to foil the speculative gentleman i strike in and so come to the aid of a longsuffere public 
-PRON- hit off the matter finely mr munn reply the professor 
that be -PRON- purpose 
could not -PRON- antitemperature mixture have be donate to the poor with beneficial result 
-PRON- be altogether too expensive for general use 
i will not conceal from -PRON- gentleman the fact that -PRON- be fall sunward 
if -PRON- make landfall on a planet where the heat be several hundred degree beyond -PRON- earthly power of endurance the mixture in question will preserve -PRON- 
fall sunward exclaim markham 
-PRON- be hard upon midnight when -PRON- leave the earth 
if -PRON- schoolday learning be not at fault the sun at the hour of -PRON- departure be on the opposite side of -PRON- planet 
how then do -PRON- happen that -PRON- be fall toward the great luminary 
bravo cry the professor vastly pleased be glad to see mr markham that -PRON- intellect have not suffer a total eclipse by the demand of commercial supremacy 
night be the result of one of the hemisphere be turn from the sun and other thing be equal -PRON- should now be fall toward the outer limit of -PRON- solar system but if i may use the term the castle be not aim for a direct fall from the earth crust 
-PRON- drop at a very sharp angle and the influence of the sun have attract -PRON- still farther out of a straight course 
i trust -PRON- follow -PRON- 
the three millionaire understand the situation but judge from the expression of -PRON- face the knowledge bring keen disappointment 
there be only two planet between the earth and the sun observe markham mercury and venus if i remember rightly 
both insignificant grumbled popham 
venus be about the size of -PRON- own planet gentleman say the professor 
however -PRON- have long be suppose that there be another group of planet between mercury and the sun among -PRON- a little world call vulcan which that do not interest -PRON- cut in meigs 
sunward the planet be small but -PRON- get large as -PRON- go the other way 
larger expound the professor but less dense 
as i be about to tell -PRON- a moment ago pursued popham meig markham and i have decide that either saturn or mar would about fill the bill so far as -PRON- be concerned 
there be light on mar which as -PRON- figure -PRON- presuppose electricity and electricity mean civilization to a degree that afford -PRON- a promising prospect 
then again there be canal on mar and if canal certainly water transportation 
transportation problem of any sort will interest gilhooly indeed -PRON- be prone to think -PRON- would bring -PRON- back to -PRON- normal poise 
saturn on the other hand have ring and such a condition may afford opportunity to wideawake man such as be unknown anywhere else in the solar system 
take -PRON- either to mar or to saturn professor quinn as -PRON- may find -PRON- most convenient 
-PRON- demand -PRON- 
-PRON- be impossible to do anything of that kind mr popham return the professor decidedly 
the influence of the sun upon -PRON- course be too powerful 
be -PRON- to understand then cry markham that -PRON- be compel to put up with either mercury or venus 
even there gentleman -PRON- have no choice 
-PRON- be in the grip of circumstance and must perforce accept whatever fate throw -PRON- way 
possibly -PRON- shall become a satellite of the sun revolve around and around planet the small of any in the great system 
although i feel drowsy i arouse -PRON- with an effort and keep sharp eye on the professor face 
i do not think -PRON- be in earnest but merely talk to see what effect -PRON- remark would have on the three millionaire 
corner corner corner babble gilhooly make a corner corner everything 
markham drop -PRON- face in -PRON- hand meig bow -PRON- head and i see a shiver run through popham 
egad mutter popham this castle of yours quinn be little short of a steel tomb 
inasmuch as -PRON- be safely inter what s the use of living 
gilhooly be the only fortunate one among -PRON- for -PRON- reason be shatter and -PRON- can not realize what -PRON- be face 
-PRON- be talk less like a man now popham reprove quinn than like a drivel idiot 
while there s life there s hope 
how many brilliant mind have be overthrow as a result of -PRON- manipulation of stock in wall street 
how many bright future have be wreck by an adverse trend of the speculative market 
be those unfortunate any better off because thrust into madhouse and unable to realize the fate that have overtake -PRON- 
for shame sir 
-PRON- be perfectly sure be -PRON- professor i strike in attempt to give a more pleasant twist to the conversation that -PRON- shall come out all right in the end have -PRON- plan mr munn -PRON- answer not unkindly and the success or failure of -PRON- will depend largely upon the mental attitude of these gentleman 
this be too deep for -PRON- and i cast about for some equally important question which would bring a less indefinite response 
anyhow say -PRON- have plenty of food for a long journey 
-PRON- would be a fearful thing to have a famine soso many mile from a base of supply 
the food supply mr munn answer the professor be adequate 
there will be no famine 
and the water the oxygen the have look after everything necessary to -PRON- safety and comfort 
i have confidence in quinn 
-PRON- have show that -PRON- be an able man and that -PRON- promise be to be take at face value 
with a sigh of relief i settle back in tolerable comfort 
meig take the role of questioner out of -PRON- hand at this point and although i be eager to hear all that be say tired nature sweet restorer get the well of -PRON- curiosity and i fall asleep on the bale 
-PRON- be not -PRON- purpose to cumber this narrative with the small detail of -PRON- journey novel and thrill though some of -PRON- prove to be 
-PRON- be with -PRON- experience on the planet which finally claim -PRON- that this account have mostly to do so i shall glide over intermediate incident in a somewhat cursory manner 
-PRON- faculty key to an understanding of earthly condition only find -PRON- continually at bay and at nothing do -PRON- stand more aghast than at the lightninglike speed with which -PRON- shoot through space 
the energy develop by the two insulate cube give to -PRON- steel car the stupendous velocity of one hundred mile per second six thousand mile per minute three hundred and sixty thousand mile per hour 
human reason may well falter at the threshold of such immensity 
yet while i sleep peacefully on that bale in the storeroom these figure be verify by the professor and archibald meig who happen to be the only two who be wide awake 
-PRON- have be -PRON- lasting regret that -PRON- do not rouse -PRON- so that i may also have have a view of the noble spectacle for the first time unroll to earthly eye 
-PRON- pass the moon a dreary burnedout world and the professor be able to check off two hundred and forty thousand mile of -PRON- sunward plunge 
-PRON- have travel a little more than half an hour at -PRON- ultimate velocity take this into consideration and note the exact minute when -PRON- cross the centre of the satellite orbit the professor be able to do some figuring and so test -PRON- theory as to speed 
the car skim through ether less than five hundred mile above the lunar crust 
quinn be doubly pleased for -PRON- not only prove that -PRON- velocity be substantially as -PRON- have suppose but also discover that the moon attraction so powerful on the tide of -PRON- mother sphere could not swerve the car by a hair breadth from -PRON- direct course or overcome the influence of the sun 
meig tell -PRON- later that the marvelous beauty of the satellite gleam against the black void with ghostly radiance be probably worth the trip and -PRON- attendant inconvenience 
-PRON- and quinn have look -PRON- fill on the hemisphere which be never see from the earth 
after this the hour literally fly past the novelty of -PRON- journey preclude any such thing as monotony 
in fact -PRON- hardly allow -PRON- a sufficient amount of time for rest and refreshment 
a lookout be keep continually at the eyepiece of the telescope to signal the approach of any asteroid with which -PRON- may possibly come into collision 
only once do this danger threaten -PRON- and then as may be suppose -PRON- be the professor who prove -PRON- salvation 
the lever in the wall of the lower or living room of the car communicate with screen ingeniously arrange for shut off the power of the antigravity cube 
by lessen -PRON- speed the professor suffer the asteroid to cross -PRON- course -PRON- car duck through the luminous trail that sweep out behind -PRON- 
night reign around -PRON- constantly 
-PRON- car catch the ray of the sun -PRON- be true but the lack of an atmosphere cause the light to be throw back into space and lose 
the castle be nothing less than a small planet attend by five satellite which hold to -PRON- vicinity by the car attraction circle around -PRON- continually 
these satellite be the four knot handkerchief contain the tribute i have levy upon the plutocrat and also the revolver which have assist -PRON- in the work 
these object go through varied phase exactly as more pretentious satellite would have do 
-PRON- would be difficult to describe -PRON- feeling as i watch -PRON- from the car window 
i be prone to think at the present writing that this lose booty wax and wane under -PRON- eye plant in -PRON- nature those first seed of regret which finally grow into a reformation 
i recall a conversation that i have with markham while i sit with -PRON- eye at the low end of the telescope watch for stray asteroid 
the millionaire have give -PRON- to understand that i be not in -PRON- set circumstance over which -PRON- have no control have bring -PRON- together within the narrow confine of the car but no social barrier have be level 
occasionally the novelty of -PRON- situation and the consequent excitement would cause one or other of the wealthy gentleman to forget the gulf that yawn between -PRON- 
this attitude of the magnate afford -PRON- a good deal of innocent enjoyment 
-PRON- have leave social prestige no less than -PRON- bank account behind -PRON- and what little collateral -PRON- have have upon -PRON- person be now satellite about the car 
the line -PRON- draw between -PRON- and -PRON- in -PRON- thoughtful moment be a distinction without much of a difference 
markham i remember be munch a sandwich contrive out of two cracker and a slice of tin beef 
do -PRON- never reflect mr munn say -PRON- upon the evil of -PRON- past 
when a man write book which be mainly draw from -PRON- own experience mr markham say -PRON- have to go into -PRON- past pretty exhaustively 
ah yes i be forget about the book 
be -PRON- not horrified with the result of -PRON- retrospection 
horrified 
well yes here and there 
i lose a big haul once through the breaking of a jimmy and i be horrified to think how any dealer in burglar kit could have foist such an unreliable instrument upon a wellmeane cracksman 
markham stare at -PRON- dazedly have set down the experience in chapter one of forty way for crack safe i proceed and one of the first of -PRON- ten rule for success in any safecracking job be this be sure that -PRON- kit be reliable and without flaw 
mr munn mr munn whisper markham hoarsely 
think of the people from whom -PRON- have take property dishonestly never think of -PRON- but to wish that i have be able to relieve -PRON- of more 
this be awful mutter markham 
-PRON- really exult over what -PRON- have do 
-PRON- would have start down the iron stair have i not restrain -PRON- with a word 
let -PRON- ask -PRON- something mr markham say last fall bread go to ten cent a loaf because the wheat market be corneredand a man by the name of markham do the cornering 
the people who have to put up that extra five cent miss -PRON- more than do those from whom i take five hundred dollar 
markham cough 
any asteroid in sight -PRON- inquire absently wonder if -PRON- ever do any reflect 
i ask tartly 
what do -PRON- think of quinn and markham look away as i take -PRON- eye from the telescope and give -PRON- an expressive wink donot think i continue that -PRON- ever write a book call forty way to starve the poor 
-PRON- have material enough for a pretty effective volume on the subject but -PRON- havenot -PRON- nerve 
no -PRON- return slowly havenot -PRON- nerve 
-PRON- require unalloyed impudence and a mind incapable of clear thinking to liken the result of high finance with those of -PRON- own petty and highly criminal proceeding 
-PRON- be too bright a man mr munn to allow -PRON- to be lead afield by sophistry of that kind 
mr markham mr markham 
i breathe in horrified protest 
-PRON- have bolster up -PRON- nefarious business with false ideal -PRON- go on and -PRON- be unregenerate and lose 
this be awful 
i murmur 
when -PRON- get to where -PRON- be go pursue markham either fail to note -PRON- sarcasm or else hope to ride -PRON- down trust -PRON- will hold -PRON- criminal instinct in check 
if there be any people there donot give -PRON- any false ideal or implant the notion that -PRON- standard belong to the rest of -PRON- would not so belittle -PRON- ideal i return bluntly 
sir -PRON- cry sharply be i to understand that -PRON- set -PRON- up as be any well than mr popham mr gilhooly mr meig or -PRON- 
what -PRON- understand doesnot concern -PRON- in the least i answer airily 
what -PRON- donot understand -PRON- strike -PRON- be the matter that ought to claim -PRON- attention 
confound -PRON- sir 
-PRON- overwhelming ignorance be equal only by -PRON- colossal egotism 
i be sorry that i allow -PRON- to be beguile into any talk with -PRON- 
-PRON- regret be mutual say for -PRON- conversation be demoralize 
-PRON- be a past master in successful trickerytrickery of the sort that ought to be stamp out 
if the law be as quick to deal with -PRON- as with -PRON- hold fume markham plunging for the stair have hear enough 
i have say that i be a hard man in those time 
i could call a spade a spade with never a thought that -PRON- angle of vision be distort 
i have regret express -PRON- view in this frank fashion to markham yet i believe that there be injustice in -PRON- remark no less than in mine 
be the only person in the car who possess a watch the professor appoint -PRON- official timekeeper 
-PRON- be -PRON- duty to bulletin the hour with -PRON- equivalent in day such as -PRON- be accustom to upon a blackboard in the low room i have also to enter this information upon a book which the professor call the logbook 
every ten hour -PRON- have a class in astronomy with the professor as instructor and with every man save gilhooly and the lookout as student 
the railway magnate aberration continue all -PRON- could do be to watch -PRON- solicitously and prevent -PRON- from do any injury to -PRON- or to -PRON- paraphernalia 
the class learn that the near planet with an atmosphere and supposedly habitable be venus which at inferior conjunction be distant some twentyfive million mile from terra as quinn call -PRON- own planet 
count out the delay at start and in maneuvre to escape the asteroid -PRON- instructor assert that -PRON- should reach venus in something like seventyfive hour 
markham meig and popham on consult the bulletin board and find that seventy hour have pass begin to brush -PRON- clothe and tidy -PRON- against the hour of landing 
but -PRON- be destine to disappointment 
unable to locate venus at the point where -PRON- have hope to find -PRON- the professor decide that -PRON- be near superior conjunction and be somewhere on the other side of the sun 
meig make a deplorable display of temper 
quinn be a mighty poor astronomer -PRON- say sneeringly if -PRON- could find -PRON- so far wide of the mark on such a simple matter 
meig further addedwith a good deal of childishness as i thoughtthat the role of a derelict be distasteful to -PRON- a derelict -PRON- argue be nothing more than a tramp and -PRON- object to be a tramp even a celestial tramp 
i be out of patience with the man 
admiration for the professor have take fast hold of -PRON- and i would not have -PRON- sneer at or malign 
a war of hot word be on between -PRON- and the wall street broker when quinn interfere 
true say -PRON- -PRON- have miss venus by a few million of mile but -PRON- be aim directly at the orbit of another world and i can so manipulate the lever as to wait for -PRON- if necessary and drop upon -PRON- surface when -PRON- overtake -PRON- 
what world be that say popham prick tip -PRON- ear 
mercury answer the professor 
-PRON- be the small orb in -PRON- solar system and measure some three thousand mile in diameter think venus be rather contract for man with such large scheme as -PRON- remark meig shake -PRON- head but this other planet seem to be small still wonder if -PRON- have coal mine there murmur popham meditatively 
and if -PRON- grow wheat and cotton add meig 
if mercury be inhabit speak up markham eagerly food will certainly be as necessary there as on the earth 
i donot know gentleman but -PRON- strike -PRON- -PRON- may fall into bad place 
poor gilhooly sigh meigs 
what a pity -PRON- will be if the mercurial prove to have traction interest 
how long before -PRON- shall reach this planet -PRON- speak of professor inquire popham 
well answer quinn thoughtfully mercury be rather slow 
-PRON- travel along -PRON- orbit at the rate of thirty mile per second while -PRON- be move at one hundred mile 
at a rough estimate i should say -PRON- can effect a juncture with the planet in ten hour although an extra hour may be require for maneuvre to secure a landing 
the ten hour that follow be hour of great anxiety and feverish labor 
believe that -PRON- nerve be the steady the professor place -PRON- at the telescope to act as pilot while -PRON- serve as engineer and manipulate the lever 
the responsibility of -PRON- position so work upon -PRON- that i have no time for the glory of the planet -PRON- be endeavor to intercept 
through the telescope i see huge mountain and broad plain but -PRON- be blur over with a reddish light and the less detail of topography be lose 
when five hour be go the professor leave the lever and come upstairs to have a look through the telescope for -PRON- 
-PRON- have do very well indeed mr munn -PRON- be pleased to say but i think that i have well take this post from now on while -PRON- go below and station -PRON- at the switch board 
the slight mismanagement when the critical moment arrive may hurl -PRON- against mercury with a force that would result in annihilation 
the lever turn in a half circle as -PRON- may know 
the arc be divide into space number from zero to ninety 
i will call down to -PRON- the number to which -PRON- must throw the lever -PRON- will repeat the number back to -PRON- and instantly obey -PRON- order 
trust -PRON- sir say but the professor be loath to let -PRON- go without still further impress upon -PRON- the importance of the work before -PRON- 
in order to alight safely mr munn -PRON- continue -PRON- must graduate the power of the antigravity cube to the mercurial atmosphere 
by proceed intelligently in the matter -PRON- shall make the car weigh slightly more than the atmosphere -PRON- encounter then when -PRON- be about to land -PRON- will let the car just counterbalance the pull of the planet and there will not be the slight jar understand professor i answer and go downstairs 
markham meig and popham ascend to the upper chamber this position bring -PRON- a few foot nearer the goal of -PRON- desire as well as give -PRON- a point of vantage from which to watch event 
gilhooly be the only one besides -PRON- in the low room -PRON- be kneel on the divan write imaginary stock quotation on the steel wall with the point of -PRON- finger 
for four hour or more the professor call out for slight variation in the speed of the car but in the main the lever be hold on the number which give a maximum velocity 
the tension of the minute usher in the last hour of the ten be beyond -PRON- power to describe 
once in -PRON- evil day i manipulate the tumbler of a combination and pull open a vault door 
behind the door stand two man with revolver 
for two second i stare agape at the trap which i have spring upon -PRON- and when i get away i have a bullet in -PRON- shoulder 
intensify -PRON- feeling fourfold as i stand look into the level revolver of those two man then spread out the two second to cover a half hour 
in this way only can i describe -PRON- state of mind while -PRON- fight for a safe landing on the planet mercury 
cry of wonder and apprehension echo to -PRON- from overhead 
above -PRON- i hear the shrill voice of the professor zero 
zero i repeat throw the lever clear over 
there follow a jolt as the screen cover the cube and shut off -PRON- energy 
instantly there come the sicken sensation of a fall accompany by a rush of displace air that roar and bellow all about the car shriek quinn 
i yell throw the lever half over 
then -PRON- catch -PRON- with a suddenness that throw -PRON- to -PRON- knee 
-PRON- be move upward could feel the steel floor rise under -PRON- 
twenty come down from above 
twenty i answer hoarsely struggle erect and shift the lever 
i feel that -PRON- be still rise but slowly 
the professor be juggle with an unknown atmosphere and on the success of -PRON- judgment depend -PRON- life 
fifteen 
fifteen and over go the lever for five degree 
-PRON- be swinge stationary in midair 
from the window by the switch board i look outward and downward with bulge eye 
a dazzling glow cover peak and plain and i turn away that -PRON- sight may not be blind to the lever number 
ten cry the professor 
ten -PRON- be and i throw the switch to the number give 
then again -PRON- drop but slowly very slowly 
five 
i repeat the order and again the air rush against the blunt base of the car yet not so fiercely as before 
then all of a sudden i feel a grip of finger about -PRON- throat and i be haul from the lever and throw back on the floor 
gilhooly have a knee on -PRON- breast and be strangle -PRON- with finger of steel 
the fire of an insane purpose gleam in -PRON- eye and -PRON- seem possess of the strength of a dozen demon 
i struggle but i may as well have try to rise under the thousandton pressure of a hydraulic press 
ten cry quinn 
i do not could not for -PRON- tongue be loll between -PRON- lip 
ten scream quinn be lose a groan hardly audible escape -PRON- gasping throat 
i hear a frantic clamor above and then there be such a jar and crash as i hope i shall never experience again 
all tangible life slip away from -PRON- and i collapse into an unconsciousness that i feel may be death -PRON- 
a that -PRON- life be preserve and the car save from destruction be due to two circumstance one of -PRON- most peculiar and of farreache importance 
the less of the two circumstance be this the car have not drop to the plain but have have -PRON- downward rush intercept by an elevation so that the force of -PRON- fall be just about half what may have be expect 
as to the other and more vital circumstance the fall -PRON- be not what -PRON- would have be on -PRON- own sphere 
the pull of gravity on mercury as -PRON- afterward discover have only onethird the power -PRON- have on terra 
to this phenomenon be due many wonderful thing as the reader will discover before -PRON- have go very far 
i be not the first of -PRON- party to open -PRON- eye after the landing for when i sit up and stare about -PRON- i see the professor move around the steel chamber and minister to the other 
gilhooly be creep toward the divan on all four mutter something about a great slump in the market and chuckle over the way in which -PRON- have get out from under 
archibald meig be groan and try to lift -PRON- on -PRON- elbow augustus popham be on -PRON- knee wobble erratically and apparently undecided whether to say -PRON- prayer or to try and get up hannibal markham be flatten out along the floor the professor kneel over -PRON- and chafe -PRON- temple 
what sort of a navigator be -PRON- quinn ask meig crossly 
by gad -PRON- be more dangerous to make port with -PRON- than -PRON- be to sail through space blame the professor for a fault of mine meig i speak up warmly 
the broker look at -PRON- with something like contempt blame -PRON- for place an incompetent and irresponsible person at such an important post as the switch board say meigs 
-PRON- should have know that a man who hold -PRON- distorted view on the subject of personal property be not to be trust right add popham lift -PRON- to the divan 
gilhooly make an attack on -PRON- say -PRON- bear -PRON- down and come within one of strangle -PRON- 
quinn be the cause of abnormal condition persist meig who be bind to have quinn at fault for every evil that overtake -PRON- 
i get up rather more wrathful than the situation demand 
the fall have jar -PRON- temper no less than -PRON- body and i be in a mood to have the business out with meig at close quarter 
softly mr munn caution the professor 
-PRON- be well to have a deaf ear for these gentleman at time 
help -PRON- lift mr markham to the divan 
the professor word dispel -PRON- anger 
without another word to meig i go over and assist in get the food trust magnate into a more comfortable position 
markham be not long in recover and when -PRON- take stock of -PRON- -PRON- find that -PRON- be not much the bad for -PRON- shake up 
quinn call to -PRON- to go upstairs with -PRON- and see if any havoc have be work there 
-PRON- find that no particular damage have be do to the instrument or other material 
when -PRON- descend to the low chamber after an absence of fifteen or twenty minute meig have the key in the steel door and be stand at the entrance with popham and markham on either side of -PRON- 
where do -PRON- get that key demand the professor one hand grope in -PRON- pocket 
heretofore -PRON- have be careful to keep the key upon -PRON- person 
small wonder that -PRON- be now surprised to find -PRON- in the possession of meig find -PRON- on the floor reply the broker with a good deal of dignity 
probably -PRON- lose -PRON- out of -PRON- pocket when -PRON- fall from the stair a few minute ago what be -PRON- intend to do ask the professor quietly 
professor quinn sir return meig with elaborate condescension -PRON- have reach the parting of the way 
while -PRON- be travel through space i and -PRON- friend could do nothing less than bear with -PRON- company and with that of the rogue at -PRON- side but now that -PRON- be safely moor on mercury and can debark -PRON- see fit to withdraw -PRON- and renounce further intercourse with -PRON- 
ah murmur quinn a slow smile hover about -PRON- thin lip 
the smile cause some acerbity to manifest -PRON- in the three gentleman at the door 
-PRON- draw -PRON- up haughtily 
quinn go on the broker sharply -PRON- lure -PRON- into -PRON- castle and abduct -PRON- from -PRON- native orb with small regard for the feeling of -PRON- relative or friend and no consideration whatever for the business interest with which -PRON- be engage so -PRON- business interest have -PRON- every consideration interrupt the professor 
meig take no notice of the remark 
so -PRON- continue remember these wrong -PRON- feel that -PRON- can no longer associate with -PRON- 
as for -PRON- turn a fastidious eye in -PRON- be utterly impossible to man of -PRON- social standing 
this planet -PRON- tell -PRON- be three thousand mile in diameter 
may -PRON- request that -PRON- and munn take one end of the diameter and leave the other end to -PRON- 
the professor laugh softly and seat -PRON- 
sit down mr munn say -PRON- 
-PRON- have be ostracize by -PRON- fellowexile 
let -PRON- see how well -PRON- get along without -PRON- 
-PRON- bid -PRON- farewell finished meig loftily 
thereupon -PRON- turn the key throw open the doorand drop on the threshold as though -PRON- have be shoot 
markham and popham cry aloud throw -PRON- arm across -PRON- face and reel back 
a blast as from a furnace drive in at the opening fill the chamber like a draft from hade 
i could scarcely breathe in the stifle atmosphere 
hurry munn cry quinn 
drag meig away from the door or hell be burn to a crisp 
the broker be already smoke when i catch -PRON- ankle and jerk -PRON- inside 
the professor slam the door 
presently the air within the car readjust -PRON- to normal condition 
meig red as a beet and breathing heavily be little the bad for -PRON- warm experience fancy mr meig coo the professor that -PRON- will wish to avail -PRON- of one of -PRON- antitemperature bath before cut loose from -PRON- and mr munn 
there be plenty of water leave for all of -PRON- and i will go aloft set up the collapsible tub and make the bath ready 
-PRON- have alight in the tropic evidently and at the period of midsummer 
the temperature be about five hundred degree fahrenheit 
with that the professor take the key from the door to keep gilhooly from make a dash outside and start for the storeroom 
i follow -PRON- the three disgruntle gentleman gaze after -PRON- mutely 
the professor and i be the first to fortify -PRON- with the antitemperature bath 
after dip -PRON- body -PRON- rinse -PRON- clothing in the liquid 
aside from a pleasant cool sensation the bath give no evidence of -PRON- potent quality 
there be no hardening of the skin as i fancy there may be no change in -PRON- ruddy color no inconvenience 
when -PRON- go down again -PRON- send the other three gentleman aloft the professor instruct -PRON- as to the necessity of make -PRON- clothing as well as -PRON- body proof against the climate 
in due course popham meig and markham once more show -PRON- 
gilhooly of course have also to be make immune and -PRON- struggle against -PRON- so fiercely that -PRON- be oblige to hold -PRON- in the tub while the professor pour three bucket of the mixture over -PRON- 
-PRON- be not disrobe and when sufficiently drench -PRON- leap from the tub and flee rave to the low chamber 
now say the professor -PRON- be prepared to fare forth 
-PRON- address -PRON- to markham meig and go with mr munn and -PRON- or keep by yourself as -PRON- may elect 
but -PRON- will be well to make this car -PRON- headquarters 
here -PRON- have food and drink also a stronghold in case of attack by the there happen to be any 
how can there be any life in such an overheat atmosphere inquire markham 
nature be a great leveler of barrier reply quinn 
-PRON- be able to adjust life to -PRON- environment -PRON- may be sure just as easily as -PRON- can bridge the social chasm that separate a thief from a trust magnate 
-PRON- eye twinkle 
such a bridge -PRON- add would not prove much of a tax on -PRON- resource 
for -PRON- own part i do not think the chasm either so wide or so deep as -PRON- gentleman appear to imagine 
i chuckle at that and meig and -PRON- two companion grow duly resentful 
as for mr gilhooly continue quinn -PRON- can not take -PRON- with -PRON- on -PRON- tour of observation 
-PRON- will be good to leave -PRON- lock in the car 
i will close the trap lead into the storeroom and i do not think -PRON- will be possible for -PRON- to work much damage in the room below donot know what good -PRON- will do -PRON- to go out with -PRON- explore expedition say popham dejectedly in a country as hot as this there can be no earthly use for coal 
or wear apparel add meig listlessly 
cotton couldnot grow in such a temperature 
and as for wheat 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head wearily 
cotton and wheat be the abc of -PRON- wall street experience 
beyond those commodity -PRON- grope in the dark 
what sort of food can be grow on such a sunbaked planet grumble markham 
the railway man be shout something about water stock and -PRON- babbling be waft up to -PRON- 
gilhooly add markham be the only fortunate man in the party 
realization will blast the hope and mayhap prove the death of the rest of -PRON- while hehe can not realize 
-PRON- gentleman lose courage too quickly say the professor 
in -PRON- lecture on venus i tell -PRON- how that planet be incline to the plane of -PRON- orbit 
the axis of mercury have a still great inclination in fact the orb lean on -PRON- as though about to fall 
-PRON- day be of about the same length as the day of three minute longerbut -PRON- year owe to -PRON- contract orbit be much short 
in eightyeight day mercury make -PRON- round so that each season be only twentytwo day in length 
at the pole of mercury in what answer to the polar region of -PRON- own earth there must be a more tempered climate then let -PRON- get there by all mean cut in popham 
in whatever -PRON- do answer quinn -PRON- must make haste slowly get out and look around anyhow cry meig 
-PRON- may happen after all that -PRON- have a world to conquer here and i have not the patience to remain longer in this steel cell of yours 
very good return the professor 
-PRON- will make -PRON- preparation and go forth 
-PRON- shut off the flow of oxygen from the tank and then follow the rest of -PRON- to the under apartment close a steel door over the trap at the head of the stair and lock -PRON- 
gilhooly imagine -PRON- a conductor be walk around the edge of the circular divan collect ticket from imaginary passenger 
sing sing -PRON- call out as the professor unlock the door at the entrance and pull -PRON- open where -PRON- get off munn say meig maliciously where -PRON- all get off return the professor smile 
thereupon -PRON- pass hastily into the blind glare of the mercurial day 
for several minute -PRON- eye rebel at the brightness when finally -PRON- become inured to -PRON- -PRON- look around -PRON- upon a desolation that strike dismay to -PRON- heart 
-PRON- see then that -PRON- car have alight upon an elevation which be nothing less than the rim of an extinct volcano of vast proportion 
from ridge to ridge across the abysmal crater at least half a mile could be measure 
-PRON- be beyond the power of -PRON- eye to penetrate to the black depth of the great pit 
listen cry the professor -PRON- voice resound so thunderously as almost to deafen ussome trick of the atmosphere 
-PRON- stand silently -PRON- ear alert and hear a confused babel of sound proceeding apparently out of the very core of the volcano fire may be at work down there whisper the professor nodding toward the crater 
even the whisper sound unpleasantly loud to -PRON- 
what a world come from augustus popham in bellow tone 
with fire within and without what chance be there for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
some of meigs peevishness have get into the coal man and -PRON- rent the air with -PRON- 
-PRON- remain mule after this outburst i with -PRON- gaze hopefully on the professor and the professor blink at the sun 
in a little time i allow -PRON- own eye to falter zenithward and the glory of the sun in midheaven have ever since be one of the treasured memory of -PRON- life 
-PRON- disk be six time -PRON- diameter as view from earth and the grandeur of -PRON- flaming surface be beyond the power of -PRON- feeble pen to make known 
i be oppress and hold captive by a feeling of awe and wonder 
there be a red tinge to the atmosphere cause by a reflection from the red of the planet bricklike crust through this warm color pulse the golden streamersyellow and scarlet overhead fade to faint orange on the horizon 
think -PRON- mr popham murmur the professor -PRON- voice awaken -PRON- as from a trance that all yon splendor which have be in these sky for age upon age be create for the enjoyment of no live thing 
if so -PRON- be wrong 
there be now as there have always be being with an intelligence capable of appreciate all this magnificent profusion of light and color 
but enough 
-PRON- have look down into the crater and up into the heaven suppose -PRON- turn -PRON- eye another way and see what there be to offer 
-PRON- face about as -PRON- speak and gaze down the bare rocky slope of the volcano and off across an equally bare and forbid plain 
no tree no water no life of any kind mutter meig querulously 
there be a bright spot over there say quinn shade -PRON- eye and point 
-PRON- eye follow -PRON- finger and encounter a glittering object on a slight elevation 
as -PRON- gaze the object whatever -PRON- be slowly vanish 
-PRON- may investigate that suggest popham excitedly 
perhaps -PRON- be a mercurial wear a sort of armor to protect -PRON- from the heat 
-PRON- may be that there be people here and that -PRON- live underground 
-PRON- would have start forthwith but the professor stretch out a hand and detain -PRON- 
just a moment say quinn 
before -PRON- get too far from the car let -PRON- make sure that all of -PRON- be sufficiently immune from the heat 
do -PRON- feel that -PRON- be fully protect in that respect gentleman 
so far as i be personally concerned i have not feel the slight inconvenience from the sun ray 
i declare as much and the other likewise so express -PRON- another one of the thing speak up meig point in another direction 
-PRON- be just able to detect a glow on another low elevation when -PRON- also flash into thin air 
then -PRON- begin look for the little hill and count no less than a dozen within -PRON- range of vision 
some of the hill be cap with the mysterious gleam which dazzle for a time and then twinkle out 
the professor be perplex as i could see plainly examine one of those hill say meig and find out what this mean 
the top of the volcano where -PRON- be stand be perhaps five hundred foot from the plain 
as meig speak -PRON- leap for a rock a yard or so below -PRON- 
to the astonishment of all of -PRON- -PRON- rise in the air like a human balloon soar over the rock by a score of foot and alight several rod down the slope 
-PRON- be a titanic jump but meig have regain a foothold with the lightness of a piece of down 
-PRON- be a large man be meigs -PRON- ponderosity exceed two hundred pound fairbank 
-PRON- be as much surprised at -PRON- agility as -PRON- be and begin to essay various feat 
-PRON- leap straight upward gain a maximum height of a dozen yard and return lightly and easily to -PRON- original position 
next -PRON- couple -PRON- leap with an aerial somersault and carry on with an abandon much beneath the dignity of a wall street broker as -PRON- strike -PRON- 
in fact -PRON- act like a schoolboy out for a holiday and so full of animal spirit -PRON- hardly know what to do with -PRON- think -PRON- belong to a circus observe the disgusted popham go down there and put a stop to the performance 
and go along and help add markham visibly distract because of the broker folly 
-PRON- start down the steep with rodlong step and presently one would have think -PRON- wear sevenleague boot from the amount of speed -PRON- develop 
instead of put a stop to the broker performance -PRON- join in 
by and by -PRON- be play leapfrog every bound take -PRON- forward half a hundred foot 
gravity here be far from have the force -PRON- have on terra remark the professor 
exertion come easy and give most astonishing result 
those man mr munn be not use to such activity yet -PRON- marvelous gymnastic do not seem to tire -PRON- in the least 
suppose that -PRON- -PRON- make a test of the mercurial gravity 
i need no second bidding and quinn and i take the descent as buoyantly as thistledown before the wind 
somehow the lightness of -PRON- heel get into -PRON- head and the staid professor and -PRON- begin cavort like a pair of tenyearold 
the delightful freedom of movement be as novel as -PRON- be exhilarate 
liberty of muscle breed license of mind have -PRON- be smoke opium -PRON- could not have act more outrageously 
nor be there any fatigue apparent 
i feel that i could have run a hundred mile in as many minute and never pause for breath 
carry away by the wonderful effect of diminished gravity -PRON- forget all about -PRON- project investigation of the little hill 
in the midst of a game of tag -PRON- be suddenly bring to -PRON- sense with a round turn 
a pall have fall over the landscape 
the sun be blot out by inky cloud and a tremendous wind begin to blow 
-PRON- must get back to the car cry quinn 
-PRON- voice great in volume though -PRON- be be all but drown in the shriek and roar of the blast 
the lightness that have afford -PRON- so much enjoyment in still air now become a source of grave danger for -PRON- could not keep -PRON- foot in the fury of the temp 
merciful power roar popham as -PRON- and meig be drive against each other with a terrific impact 
although sorely put to -PRON- to keep -PRON- from be blow away i manage to cling to a rock and watch the weird gyration of the two millionaire 
-PRON- collision have cause -PRON- to lose -PRON- footing and cling desperately to each other -PRON- be hurl back and forth touch the ground now and then only to rebound from -PRON- like rubber ball 
and all the time this tumbling be go on both man be whoop frantically for some one to come to -PRON- aid 
i be too hard beset to think of leave -PRON- place of temporary refuge and -PRON- be only when i see the professor and markham -PRON- right hand clasp stagger toward the two man that i make up -PRON- mind to join -PRON- 
three of -PRON- in a chain may be able to do something toward rescue popham and meig 
breathe deep like a swimmer about to plunge through a whirlpool i cast -PRON- adrift and allow the wind to drive -PRON- in the direction of the professor and markham 
no matter how strongly i brace backward against the blast every time i lift a foot i be hurl onward and almost overturn 
finally more by good luck than anything else i come close enough to catch the professor hand 
popham and meig will be kill if -PRON- canot get to -PRON- shout markham 
there be eddy in the wind like those in the swift current of a stream and popham and meig have become entangle in -PRON- 
have -PRON- be blow off on a straightaway course -PRON- would long since have be too far away for -PRON- to do anything toward lay hand on -PRON- and get -PRON- upright 
the professor have take note of the gyratory movement of -PRON- hapless companion and -PRON- call upon markham and -PRON- to plant -PRON- as firmly as possible and remain in -PRON- present position 
this be easy say than do yet by call upon every ounce of -PRON- reserve strength -PRON- contrive after a fashion to keep -PRON- place 
popham and meig be bound and leap through the arc of a great circle 
all -PRON- have to do be to remain where -PRON- be and wait for -PRON- 
-PRON- come to -PRON- in midair and -PRON- have literally to reach up and pull -PRON- down 
for a space the five of -PRON- be tangle in an indiscriminate heap -PRON- united weight offer great resistance to the wind and give -PRON- an opportunity to rest and collect -PRON- scatter wit 
join hand cry the professor and well get under the lee of that rock 
careful now 
-PRON- must not get separate again 
by desperate work -PRON- succeed in get to -PRON- foot and clasp hand then hurl and buffet -PRON- gain the rock and fall breathless under the leeward side of -PRON- 
what a place what a place groan popham wish venus hadnot be out of -PRON- course wail meig 
certainly -PRON- couldnot have be any bad off there than here 
no wonder nothing can grow on this sunscorched world growl markham 
even if plant could stand the heat such a wind would pull -PRON- up by the root 
what be -PRON- to do now demand popham 
-PRON- get -PRON- into this quinn and -PRON- have get to get -PRON- out of -PRON- a good time for -PRON- three to go off to the other side of the planet i remark 
whenever there s danger -PRON- suddenly realize that -PRON- canot get along without the professor 
oh -PRON- be a fine lot of nabob -PRON- be 
peace mr munn call the professor 
-PRON- have enough to occupy -PRON- mind without waste time in useless bickering 
i be at fault for i know what terrible gale visit this planet and that -PRON- come suddenly 
-PRON- be a mistake to venture so far from the car mistake breathe meig with some heat that come near have tragic consequence 
popham and i be knock about like a couple of football to be do what s to be do cry popham impatiently 
the gale be increase and who know but this rock may be pluck up bodily and roll over -PRON- 
-PRON- canot stay here 
that be true say the professor 
-PRON- must get back to the car no tell what will become of -PRON- if -PRON- try that call markham 
and there s no tell what will become of -PRON- if -PRON- remain here answer the professor 
if -PRON- form a chain -PRON- be quite possible that -PRON- may succeed in get back to -PRON- refuge 
even the car may not be able to stand up against this wind clamor meig 
-PRON- shall have to take -PRON- chance with -PRON- nevertheless go on quinn 
if -PRON- should get separate each of -PRON- must make the good preparation -PRON- can to weather the gale and then when -PRON- have blow -PRON- out hunt for the car 
that must be -PRON- rendezvous during the time -PRON- be here 
the professor get up slowly brace -PRON- against the fierce swirl that come around the side of the rock 
come -PRON- call -PRON- be now or never 
i could see that the gale have increase alarmingly 
-PRON- force seem irresistible and yet i know that -PRON- could not remain where -PRON- be 
-PRON- clasp hand again but be unable to cling together be lift high and throw helterskelter in all direction 
lightning flashedsuch lightning as i have never see before or since 
-PRON- snap and crackle overhead and run like trail serpent over the rock 
-PRON- be in a sea of flame 
and the thunder 
-PRON- seem to split the heaven and crack open the lavalike hill 
rain come yet not rain for -PRON- turn to damp vapor in the redhot atmosphere 
the mercurial element be at warwind steam thunder and lightning all marshal -PRON- host and charge to conflict 
to regain the steel car be impossible 
-PRON- be lose in the fearsome fury of darkness and storm drive helplessly and with smash force across the vast plain 
i be hurl against something which i grip with convulsive energy 
the something grip -PRON- in return 
help 
i cry bereft of -PRON- wit and eager only for rescue 
munn shout a voice 
be this -PRON- 
quinn 
i exclaim 
-PRON- must hang together say quinn 
and then tightly lock in each other arm -PRON- be lift high on a billow of fog and drive relentlessly i know not how far 
when the blast release -PRON- -PRON- fall to the rock and roll over and over then the surface beneath -PRON- give way and -PRON- drop 
the distance -PRON- fall could be only a matter of guesswork and even guesswork be out of the question in the disordered state of -PRON- mind at that moment 
suffice to say the fall do not render -PRON- unconscious and -PRON- strike on something that vibrate under the impact of -PRON- body 
-PRON- be still in blank darkness and the turmoil of the temp no longer beat about -PRON- but could be hear crash somewhere overhead 
thank heaven murmur the professor withdraw -PRON- from -PRON- 
be -PRON- alive mr munn believe so i answer 
what have happen to -PRON- professor 
-PRON- have be fling into some sort of a shelter -PRON- seem to -PRON- -PRON- reply 
but -PRON- be not on stable ground -PRON- add 
-PRON- be sit on an object that be descend with -PRON- descend rapidly andah wonder of wonder 
abruptly -PRON- fall into broad day surround by such sight and sound that i think -PRON- deal with the mystery of a disordered dream 
professor quinn and i be sit on a large box construct of metal that be polish to dazzle brilliancy 
so far as -PRON- purpose be concern this box be nothing less than an elevator -PRON- have fall upon -PRON- and -PRON- have carry -PRON- down into the wonderful interior of the planet 
now truly -PRON- be in another worlda world that teem with lifea smile and pleasant region underlie a most barren and inhospitable shell 
the scoriate exterior of the planet be the husk here be the kernel 
-PRON- be a white world extend league on league in every direction and roof with a lofty vault that sparkle as with star 
from every hand come a beelike hum proving that -PRON- be in a hive of industry and life 
house spread out before -PRON- in row queerly shaped structure that look as though -PRON- may have be build of alabaster and so diminutive that the tall scarcely come more than head high 
back of the house be field thickly cover with nodding blossom that look like snow through the field run waterway divide each into small square 
so intent be -PRON- on the background of this strange picture that -PRON- fail to take account of what be go on in -PRON- immediate vicinity 
suddenly a weird creature hop to the top of the box and stand between -PRON- companion and -PRON- regard -PRON- fixedly 
this i suppose be one of the mercurial 
if -PRON- consider the professor and -PRON- object of curiosity and surmise -PRON- be no less keen in so regard -PRON- 
-PRON- stand twentythree or twentyfour inch high -PRON- head be an ivory billiard ball and -PRON- trunk a large spheroid from -PRON- middle downward hang a red kirtle 
-PRON- have one eye at the front of the head and an ear at the back the olfactory organ be miss but there be a mouth opening perpendicularly under the eye 
the upper spheroid rest directly on the low and at each side of the low one correspond to the shoulder be two tentaclelike arm sinuous as whip and end in hand that be make up of a palm and seven digit 
queerest of all there be two more arm set in the breast and back 
from the creature shoulder be suspend a round object like a canteen 
for all of five minute quinn and i eye this surprising figure and be eye in return 
can -PRON- talk english ask the professor at last 
-PRON- be a foolish question such as i be far from expect from the professor but something have to be say and i suppose that be as good as anything else 
as the professor begin speak the head whirl squarely around present the ear 
after -PRON- companion be do the head spin back again and the breast arm catch the canteen while the finger of a shoulder arm begin manipulate a set of key 
the result be language with all the variation of tone and accent 
but -PRON- be an unknown tongue if an expression of that kind may be allow in such a case 
since the wordbox be as ineffective as -PRON- own speech -PRON- fall back with more success on the language of sign 
at this the mercurial have the well of -PRON- for -PRON- could make sign with four hand 
the professor signify that -PRON- be hungry and the mercurial signify that -PRON- be to descend from the box 
this -PRON- do and find -PRON- in the centre of a group of mercurial whose wordboxe be chatter like so many magpie 
the mercurial with whom -PRON- be already on gesticulate term play off some order on -PRON- own canteen and two of the other advance upon the box from which -PRON- have just descend 
pull out a slide in the side of the receptacle -PRON- expose two ewer of steam food and -PRON- be motion to fall to 
-PRON- stand not upon the order but obey instantly use a pair of small paddle which be thrust into -PRON- hand 
i have no idea what the food may be but -PRON- be tender and of good flavor bright little people observe the professor as -PRON- eat 
seemingly i respond 
nature have deny -PRON- the power of speech yet see how -PRON- have surmount the difficulty 
i must give that talk machine of -PRON- a close inspection 
-PRON- be in a most wonderful country mr munn 
the little i have see of -PRON- already quite daze -PRON- say what a pickpocket a man could make of -PRON- with all those hand 
quinn give -PRON- a reproachful look and i hastily apologize for even mention a branch of -PRON- profession 
do -PRON- understand now say -PRON- turn the subject very pleasantly what those bright object be which -PRON- see on the top of the low hill 
no say -PRON- be oven -PRON- answer 
food be put in -PRON- and send up to the hot surface of the planet 
when properly cook -PRON- be lower again 
association with this learned man be a liberal education in -PRON- 
i can never be sufficiently thankful to fate for cause -PRON- path to cross 
-PRON- think then say that -PRON- be blow to the top of one of the hill and fall into a shaft use by the travel oven 
nothing else could have happen 
the professor give a start and look worried 
dear dear -PRON- exclaim be quite forget -PRON- friend 
while -PRON- be here feast and take -PRON- ease -PRON- be battle with the storm and be no doubt in peril of -PRON- life 
how very very thoughtless -PRON- be mr munn 
i be not greatly exercise over the matter 
the trust magnate believe that there be a figurative gulf between -PRON- and -PRON- and i be more than willing that this gulf should grow from the symbol to the reality doubt if -PRON- can return to the outside of the planet at present professor say and even if -PRON- be able to do so what could -PRON- accomplish in the face of that tremendous storm 
true very true say -PRON- 
that oven say by way of take -PRON- mind from the plutocrat must have be very warm when -PRON- land on -PRON- and descend to these region 
-PRON- should have be grill sir return the professor but for the fact that -PRON- be coat and -PRON- clothing impregnate with -PRON- antitemperature fluid 
these mercurial appear to stand the heat pretty well i remark 
cover as -PRON- be with the antitemperature compound -PRON- return -PRON- be impossible for -PRON- to judge even approximately of the degree of heat that obtain in these region 
naturally -PRON- must be very much less than prevail on the surface of the planet and yet even at that if leave unprotected -PRON- should probably be shrivel to cinder 
hardly professor i venture to protest 
those i wave -PRON- paddle toward the open growing rank with a white herb which be evidently cook in these oven and serve for food 
quite likely -PRON- be eat of -PRON- now and very good eating i find -PRON- 
however the point i wish to make be this if the heat be so intense as -PRON- surmise those field would be wilt and dry up 
nature mr munn answer the professor adapt -PRON- to every condition 
on -PRON- own planet -PRON- see how life and comfort be render possible in every zone from the farth north to the tropic and this same adaptability of intelligent creature to -PRON- environment -PRON- may be sure proceed throughout the universe 
these oneeare oneeye diminutive creature be form in the manner best calculate to afford -PRON- comfort and happiness amid these surrounding 
and as with -PRON- so with the product of -PRON- husbandry 
-PRON- could argue a squirrel out of a tree professor say with wholesouled admiration be sorry i do not take a course of scientific training for -PRON- would have help -PRON- immensely in -PRON- business 
a burglar should be an allaround man 
if i ever return to terra so long as -PRON- feel as -PRON- do regard -PRON- odious profession mr munn break in the professor compress -PRON- lip -PRON- will never return to terra return be possible 
i ask hide the wonder -PRON- word arouse 
anything be possible 
how about the millionaire 
be -PRON- to return provide the mean be at hand 
provide -PRON- experience a change of heart 
in -PRON- present state of delusion -PRON- be mere firebrand of destruction 
before -PRON- ever again take part in mundane affair -PRON- must be teach to see thing differently 
i wonder what have become of -PRON- 
the professor brow cloud with anxiety fret about -PRON- professor say -PRON- be not overeager for -PRON- society 
let -PRON- have a taste of shift for -PRON- without -PRON- knowledge and resourcefulness to shield -PRON- from everything that go wrong 
-PRON- will do -PRON- a world of good 
perhaps -PRON- be right mr munn -PRON- companion answer musingly 
if i could know -PRON- have survive the storm i should feel tolerably easy in -PRON- mind 
these little mercurial appear to be a friendly people and if -PRON- comrade escape that frightful tempest -PRON- must sooner or later fall into the hand of these dweller of the underworld suppose i venture seek to draw -PRON- companion mind from the plutocrat that this mercurial underworld be another illustration of the way nature take care of -PRON- protgs 
after bake the outside shell of the planet to a degree that make all life impossible -PRON- thoughtfully scoop out the interior so that these small creature will have a place to go 
-PRON- have state the case correctly mr munn and the professor face light up as -PRON- sweep -PRON- gaze over the country immediately adjacent 
these oven -PRON- proceed be a remarkable example of adapt mean to an end 
the fierce heat of the surface do the cooking 
popham will find little pleasure in that i laugh 
like the rest of -PRON- answer the professor grimly -PRON- will have to accustom -PRON- to new condition 
everything must be different here from the surrounding with which -PRON- have be familiar all -PRON- life 
i wonder what form of property be consider most valuable to these mercurial 
the professor frown 
-PRON- mind be run in -PRON- old groove despite -PRON- novel environment 
that query be inspire by an unworthy motive mr munn say quinn severely 
i bow humbly 
every man -PRON- own way say can not help try to adjust -PRON- along the line of the principle i know good 
nevertheless i be of an intensely curious disposition and those talkboxe fill -PRON- with wonder 
the mercurial be dumb -PRON- seem answer the professor and -PRON- have to resort to purely mechanical mean for an exchange of idea 
language appear to flow readily enough from the little box 
if any one of -PRON- ever lose -PRON- four hand i observe -PRON- would not only find -PRON- impossible to help -PRON- but would be unable to tell other what to do to help -PRON- 
nature have be prodigal with -PRON- in the matter of hand and in this no doubt show -PRON- usual wisdom be glad to see -PRON- thought take a philosophical trend mr munn say the professor 
-PRON- argue well for -PRON- future 
by that time -PRON- have empty the receptacle of food and as -PRON- drop -PRON- paddle and draw back the wordboxe of a hundred mercurial shriek despairingly 
the pygmy cluster about the empty basin glare into -PRON- and then turn -PRON- menacing eye on the professor and -PRON- 
goodness -PRON- mr munn exclaim the professor 
-PRON- have probably eat the food supply of the entire district 
if -PRON- do not have a care -PRON- voracious appetite be like to prove -PRON- undoing 
look there come more of the mercurial after -PRON- supper warrant and -PRON- be go to be disappoint 
i look in the direction indicate by the professor and see a long line of billiard ball roll -PRON- way 
-PRON- be a procession head by a pompous little mercurial whose trunk and arm be gorgeously gild 
with two of -PRON- hand -PRON- carry a metal plate and spoon and with the other two -PRON- wield a silver baton about the size of a match 
plate and paddle be also carry by the rest of the advance mercurial -PRON- wordboxe chant a sort of quickstep 
the sight of the professor and -PRON- tower mountainlike over the throng about -PRON- bring the procession to an abrupt halt with a squeak of dismay 
the gentleman in the red kirtle go forward and hold converse with the gentleman of the gilt torso 
before -PRON- get through -PRON- wordboxe be fairly roar and stricken groan go up from every talkmachine in the line 
the advent of two leviathan like -PRON- companion and -PRON- must have have a demoralizing effect but that seem as nothing in comparison with the harrowing result of -PRON- voracity 
the leader raise -PRON- baton 
silence fall 
the leader then advance to where -PRON- be stand and circle around -PRON- examine -PRON- critically with -PRON- solitary eye 
the survey finish -PRON- try -PRON- wordbox on -PRON- the professor answer in all the language of -PRON- home planet living and dead of which -PRON- be master 
but in vain -PRON- could not come to an understanding 
the begild gentleman finally give over and whirl on the underling in the red kirtle 
-PRON- finger fly over the key of -PRON- canteen and speech of a swift and commanding kind be pour out 
a skurrying about of the oven tender result 
from somewhere a fresh supply of uncooked food be bring and place in the huge metal box 
while this be go forward quinn suddenly seize -PRON- arm a troubled look cross -PRON- face 
what be the matter professor 
i ask 
matter enough mr munn -PRON- answer 
the lever be leave on number five 
-PRON- thought be up with the steel car 
i be surprised at this for -PRON- appear to -PRON- that there be more than enough to claim -PRON- full attention right in -PRON- immediate vicinity 
and what of that sir 
i ask 
the antigravity cube lighten the car by five degree -PRON- answer excitedly 
thus buoy and in -PRON- elevated position i doubt if the car should hold -PRON- own against the fury of the storm 
-PRON- think -PRON- have be blow aye 
blow to the uttermost part of mercury and perhaps wreck and lostlost with all -PRON- scientific apparatus and other paraphernalia 
but and that be not all go on the professor 
the lever should have be throw to zero and then remove to prevent gilhooly from tamper with -PRON- 
who know what that mad railway magnate may take -PRON- into -PRON- head to do 
suppose -PRON- be to grasp the lever and give the cube -PRON- full power 
-PRON- would be launch into the void sir and -PRON- should be maroon on this sunbake planet compel to live out -PRON- life with these oneeye quadrumana devastate the country of -PRON- food supplyour presence a curse instead of a blessing 
i have already imagine a possible return to terra and from this -PRON- seem that the professor have not lose sight of that contingency 
what be to be do 
i ask catch some of -PRON- excitement 
-PRON- must return to the outer shellwe must find the carwe must go back on the oven when -PRON- send -PRON- up 
as -PRON- finish speak quinn run frantically to the metal box and leap to -PRON- top 
i follow clumsily upset a half dozen mercurial who chance to gel in -PRON- way 
the oven be load by that time and ready for -PRON- return to the intense heat nay more the chef in the red kirtle already have -PRON- hand on a wheel which presumably release the lifting power 
-PRON- movement however have act as a check on proceeding get to go back cry the professor forgetting in -PRON- stress of feeling that -PRON- word be lose on the throng around -PRON- attempt to stop -PRON- donot return the mercurial begin leap to the box from all side in a veritable swarm 
carry away by the excitement of the moment i sink to -PRON- knee and sweep -PRON- arm about -PRON- throw -PRON- back pellmell 
the professor also resort to violence 
in the midst of -PRON- all i catch a glimpse of the gilded gentleman aim -PRON- baton 
a moment more and there be a lurid flash which envelop -PRON- companion and -PRON- in a billow of violet fire 
every atom of strength be draw from -PRON- limb and i fall limply to the ground with the professor on top of -PRON- 
-PRON- be not the violet fire that do the work for the professor and -PRON- 
rather -PRON- be some chemical know to the mercurial and which manifest -PRON- presence by an overpower odor 
long after -PRON- have regain consciousness the druglike smell clung to -PRON- clothe and sap -PRON- strength 
shackle of iron could not have be more effective in make -PRON- prisoner 
cord be make fast to -PRON- foot and -PRON- be drag by a small army of mercurial down the principal street of -PRON- city and out into one of the white irrigated field 
have a dwelling be find large enough i presume -PRON- should have be comfortably house but -PRON- be of such stupendous proportion that there be no wall capable of contain -PRON- 
when -PRON- reach the field a ring a foot high be rear about -PRON- 
as the odor lessen and -PRON- strength increase i try to roll over this low barrier but receive such a shock that i be only too glad to roll back to the professor side again 
-PRON- be of no use mr munn say the professor who have be watch -PRON- attempt 
these mercurial be possess of way and mean beyond -PRON- earthly power to combat 
-PRON- must accept the situation with all the philosophy -PRON- can muster 
this great man who could remain unshaken under any fate that befall -PRON- be a constant source of strength and inspiration to -PRON- 
while -PRON- lay forsake by -PRON- captor and couch on the strange white herbage of that underground field -PRON- discourse drift along many channel 
i remember that i ask -PRON- a question concern a matter that have long be weigh upon -PRON- mind 
how be -PRON- professor say that -PRON- antigravity compound remain in a liquid state in an open cask 
i should think -PRON- inherent energy would cause -PRON- to fly upward en masse can demonstrate that by mean of an algebraic formula say -PRON- 
be -PRON- acquaint with algebra 
no i answer humbly 
then -PRON- go on disappointedly fear -PRON- will have to remain in ignorance 
-PRON- must rest content with the evidence of -PRON- sense since an explanation in term -PRON- can understand be impossible 
and thus the matter rest 
when -PRON- be so far recover as to be able to rise -PRON- make an attempt to step over the ring that hem -PRON- in but be shock by the same unseen power i have already encounter and drive back 
see with what weapon nature have provide these people murmur the professor 
throughout the universe everywhere -PRON- will find mr munn that nature take care of -PRON- own 
ah here come captain goldman 
retainer follow and -PRON- be bringingnow what be -PRON- bring 
why as i live -PRON- have manufacture a couple of large wordboxe 
evidently -PRON- be to be teach the use of -PRON- 
the professor be right 
ever since -PRON- disastrous attempt to regain the surface -PRON- have be taboo by the inhabitant of the country 
captain goldman as -PRON- companion refer to the little man who have use -PRON- mysterious baton with such tell effect be cross the field toward -PRON- follow by six of -PRON- countryman bear the talk machine 
as a precautionary measure the captain carry -PRON- weapon 
arrive at the ring captain goldman reverse the baton and with the black tip of -PRON- cut an imaginary doorway for -PRON- in the air 
-PRON- then step through and join -PRON- without shock or resistance 
thus by mean to -PRON- inexplicable -PRON- break the power of the circle at a give point 
the other follow -PRON- through the entrance -PRON- have clear 
wield the baton with two of -PRON- hand captain goldman begin manipulate -PRON- wordbox with the other two 
-PRON- be not address -PRON- however but those who have come with -PRON- 
three of -PRON- follower advance to -PRON- with one of the machine while the remain three convey a machine to the professor 
at once -PRON- instruction in the art of mechanical speech begin 
-PRON- be not -PRON- intention to burden the reader with the detail of -PRON- lesson although a few remark under this head may not be out of place 
as to the wordbox -PRON- -PRON- have seven key 
this make -PRON- somewhat difficult for a fivefingere creature to operate with any great degree of fluency although the professor do get so -PRON- could peg out -PRON- idea at a remarkable rate 
there be but six syllable in the mercurial language each syllable be represent by a corresponding key 
the way these syllable be finger give the word 
as -PRON- could be combine and repeat and combine again the vocabulary of the box be practically unlimited 
the syllable note be of resonant quality and of such divergent timber as to be quickly and easily recognize 
the syllable for key be synonymous with -PRON- personal pronoun and be the most assertive and determined note in the whole gamut of the box 
the seventh key emit a sound so utterly unlike the other sound as to be in a class by -PRON- 
-PRON- be use for space between word for exclamatory purpose and for the audible expression of laughter and grief 
-PRON- be likewise the expletive or swearkey for these small egotist have all the passion of other mortal and key act as a sort of safety valve 
the manner in which the key be use give -PRON- -PRON- versatility 
day by day -PRON- lesson proceed the professor learn with a rapidity that be marvelous 
-PRON- be well along in the polysyllable while i be struggle with the basic tone and acquire some facility in spacing and in the expression of the feeling 
-PRON- ear keep pace with -PRON- finger and in a fortnight the professor be so eloquent with -PRON- wordbox that -PRON- could now and then play off a metaphor or some other frill to the great delight of -PRON- and -PRON- auditor 
next to a wonderful jimmy invent by a cracksman name cricket doniphan whom i know well and who at that period be do time in stillwater i take off -PRON- hat to that mercurial wordbox as the most marvelous contrivance ever evolve by a think mind 
i have a very good memory and when sufficiently proficient with the key i practice by repeat passage from forty way of crack safe which as distinguish from the manual i consider -PRON- chef doeuvre 
i could not discover that -PRON- terse english faulty enough though -PRON- be lose anything in force from translation into the mercurial tongue 
the word tongue be use with reservation for of course tongue that language be not 
difficulty be experience in get a suitable mercurial equivalent for the good english word cracksman 
finally however i hit upon three quick touch of the swearkey which make the word intelligible in -PRON- own ear if not to any one else 
soon i begin to observe a little throng gathering across -PRON- side of the prison ring listen intently as i practice 
from day to day the throng increased 
over on the other side of the ring professor quinn be absorb in cut all manner of scientific caper with -PRON- wordbox 
the mutability of newtonian law form -PRON- staple theme and -PRON- be able to put -PRON- through the key with amazing variation 
but no crowd gather to listen to the professor 
the mercurial be all on -PRON- side of the compound 
thus -PRON- be clear to -PRON- that -PRON- brand of science be more attractive to the little people than the professor 
while the mutability of newtonian law languish for an audience the manual be fast acquire one that tax the capacity of the wordbox 
the professor for a long time have be so wrap up in -PRON- attempt to master the mercurial language that -PRON- have pay little heed to -PRON- and -PRON- effort 
the attention -PRON- work be secure however finally cause -PRON- to sit up and take notice 
halt -PRON- weighty remark -PRON- lay aside -PRON- talk machine come over to -PRON- side of the circle and stand behind -PRON- listen 
the first i know of -PRON- presence be the reaching of two angry hand over -PRON- head and the snatch away of the instrument on which i be at that moment recite the ten rule for a cracksman success 
-PRON- audience be as greatly put out as i be -PRON- 
while i be leap to -PRON- foot and whirl around -PRON- listener be clamor on -PRON- wordboxe for -PRON- to proceed 
professor quinn whiteface and in a great temper than i have ever before see -PRON- hold -PRON- talk apparatus over -PRON- head and seem of a mind to clash -PRON- down on the earth at -PRON- foot say professor i call restrainingly do anything rash 
mr munn -PRON- gasp -PRON- voice thick with suppress emotion be -PRON- confidence in -PRON- to be destroy utterly 
i single -PRON- out as one of the worthy of all those bring from terra and yet i find -PRON- busily inculcate false idea of personal property into the keen mind of these mercurial 
for shame sir 
would -PRON- demoralize this planet 
would -PRON- turn these lawabide people into thief 
professor i answer -PRON- idea and mine do not harmonize on this matter of property right 
while i admit mr munn -PRON- answer that condition on -PRON- own planet in a measure condone -PRON- action yet i maintain that -PRON- have no right to air -PRON- idea in njambai 
here the condition be of an altogether different sort 
so far as i have be able to learn this orb have not fall under the noxious spell of the monopolist 
-PRON- have no excuse for instruct the mercurial in the alpha and omega of -PRON- contemptible profession 
contemptible 
i repeat 
that be a hard term professor 
besides -PRON- seem to be fond of the instruction 
everybody listen to -PRON- while -PRON- havenot have so much as a corporal guard to enjoy that astronomical stuff -PRON- have be play off on -PRON- concertina 
-PRON- line perhaps be more attractive than -PRON- and the shadow of a smile curl about -PRON- thin lip for the notion of get something for nothing have a direct appeal to every thinking being 
on the other hand -PRON- thesis on the mutability of newtonian law require profound thought before -PRON- can be assimilate 
yet be that as -PRON- may i shall not allow -PRON- to degrade these people with the unworthy idea that have be come from -PRON- wordbox 
i can destroy this machine sir and i shall do so unless -PRON- promise never again to let an ignoble thought come out of -PRON- 
what do -PRON- say 
-PRON- mere command be enough professor i reply 
-PRON- be not necessary to couple -PRON- with a threat 
-PRON- face soften and -PRON- at once return to -PRON- -PRON- talkproducer beg -PRON- pardon mr munn say -PRON- have confidence in -PRON- word and know that i can trust -PRON- 
thereupon -PRON- go back to -PRON- own side of the ring and i apply -PRON- assiduously to undo any evil -PRON- illconsidered practicing may have work 
i tell the mercurial that -PRON- utterance have be in the nature of a fairy story and i give the lie to -PRON- conviction by declare that the reasoning as in all fairy tale be unsound 
from that hour -PRON- audience vanish 
the professor although -PRON- talk be profound and somewhat wearying seem to the mercurial as more worth while and -PRON- flock to hear -PRON- 
-PRON- begin acquire a knowledge of the country and of -PRON- people and institution with -PRON- very first lesson 
in two week -PRON- have gather most of the information that follow -PRON- planet -PRON- call njambai -PRON- country be baigol 
baigol be one of four kingdom comprise the underworld of njambai 
the other three kingdom be baijinkz baigossh and derive from the root word bai signify planet 
there be only two place on njambai where water be able to collect and defy the absorb power of the sun 
these place be at the two end of the planet axis correspond to the polar region of earth 
here there be sea feed river that run through the underworld and irrigate the field 
the kingdom of baijinkz and baigossh lie on the shore of these sea the former at the north and the latter at the south 
-PRON- be the only kingdom on the outer shell of njambai and levied tribute from the interior kingdom of baigol and baigadd for water right 
the distribution of light and heat throughout the neth kingdom be by a system of gigantic reflector locate at either end of a radius draw through the equator 
there be one stupendous reflector on either side of the planet measure no less than twenty spatli acrossa spatl be the equivalent of a geographical mile 
these reflector -PRON- be tell follow the sun as -PRON- move through the heaven and reflect heat and light to countless other reflector ingeniously place to acquire and radiate the solar energy 
the heat thus secure be further intensify by the planet shell which form the vault of the neth kingdom constantly diffuse warmth 
the king be golbai the nine hundred and twentyfifth of -PRON- line 
the name of the pompous gentleman whom the professor have christen captain goldman be ocou 
name of people place and thing as here give be simply a rude equivalent as nearly as can be render into english 
from -PRON- wording the astute reader will probably discover more than the six basic syllable of the baigol language 
the flexibility of the wordbox will account for this and the inconsistency be only seem and not real 
baigol have one half the inner sphere and baigadd the other half 
these two kingdom be not on the good of term owe to a wretched piece of business carry out by gaddbai king of the other country which will be advert to later 
the four kingdom be connect by a railway if such the mode of transportation could be call 
the roadbed be a groove and the wheel of the car be solid sphere with axle pierce through -PRON- diameter 
on these axle the carriage be support 
for a people so wonderfully progressive the baigol be strangely backward in -PRON- motive power -PRON- train be drag by handrelay of the small creature take -PRON- in charge 
owe to the diminished force of gravity large weight be easily handle and a fair rate of speed be develop by the train hauler 
but -PRON- be a very primitive method of transportation 
the trunk line connect the neth kingdom be know as the baigadd and baigol interplanetary system 
when two week of -PRON- enforce stay in baigol have pass a startling rumor be waft from the wordboxe of the other kingdom to the effect that the management of the line have secure a wonderful new traction power of tremendous speed and unlimited endurance 
the kingdom of baigol be agog with excitement for the president vicepresident and board of director of the interplanetary be to take a trial spin over the road in a special equip with -PRON- new motive power 
-PRON- have not yet be allow to leave the mysterious circle which imprison -PRON- but -PRON- could stand erect and so overtop the field and house that -PRON- be able to see the railway station 
billiard ball come roll in from every direction cluster about the right of way and clamber to roof top and other elevation that would afford an unobstructed view of the centre of excitement 
at last far off the professor and i hear a thunderous shout toot toot 
no wordbox could have be the source of that echo cry 
the professor give a gasp and clutch -PRON- arm convulsively 
do -PRON- recognize that voice -PRON- ask hoarsely 
merciful power mr munn how could such a thing happen 
look 
look 
over the field beyond the city leap along at fiftyfoot bound and drag behind -PRON- a train of queerlooke car crowd with official of the system come no less a person than emmet gilhooly 
the professor throw -PRON- at the barrier that hedge -PRON- round 
-PRON- could not pass although -PRON- struggle frantically 
take -PRON- coolly professor i urge grasp and hold -PRON- upright 
but this be outrageous mr munn -PRON- cry 
poor gilhooly 
be -PRON- the new traction power the other kingdom have be talk about 
how do -PRON- happen to be here 
and why be -PRON- treat -PRON- like that 
this must be stop -PRON- wordbox 
-PRON- eye sweep the ground 
glimpse -PRON- talk machine -PRON- dive for -PRON- and begin work the key like mad 
no one pay any attention to the furious language that go up under -PRON- frenzied finger however 
leviathan in harness absorb the entire attention of all the baigol and with another toot toot the railway magnate gallop out of sight 
-PRON- be a sad spectacle indeed 
i be almost as completely unmanned by -PRON- as be professor quinn 
let -PRON- not be suppose that -PRON- have give no thought to -PRON- companion in exile during -PRON- two week probation in baigol 
the professor and i have talk of -PRON- frequently wonder whether -PRON- be alive or dead and if alive where -PRON- be and what -PRON- be do 
-PRON- story have be punch out of -PRON- wordboxe for the benefit of the baigol but have not seem to make much of an impression on ocou or on other who come to see -PRON- 
now the sight of gilhooly would add corroborative detail and -PRON- harp on that key until ocou promise to communicate directly with king golbai and find out what -PRON- wish be in the matter 
as for the professor -PRON- want to go roam the four kingdom look for the other exile first visit baigadd and appropriate the motive power of the system 
the most -PRON- could get from ocou be a promise to learn -PRON- majestys pleasure in -PRON- affair and while -PRON- be abide the king decision other event take place which be of prime importance to -PRON- 
ocou have a queerlooke machine bear to -PRON- home circle which be the humorous fashion in which the professor refer to -PRON- prison ring 
the machine be an upright shaft measure some three foot in height 
to -PRON- base be attach a golden cord several yard long and terminate in a small silver disk 
professor quinn and i be consume with curiosity while this contrivance be be set up and make ready 
-PRON- put a question through -PRON- wordboxe but be only smile at mysteriously 
presently i be make to sit down turk fashion while one of attendant come to -PRON- and pass the silver disk over -PRON- head 
one end of baton have a black tip the other a white 
as the disk pass over -PRON- head ocou rest the white tip of the baton on the pedestal 
instantly a slide fly out of the shaft top bear a paint ideograph 
the professor and i be not up in the baigol ideograph and be very much surprised at the action of ocou and -PRON- companion when -PRON- look at the slide 
-PRON- recoil stare at -PRON- suspiciously and move about -PRON- with caution 
i grab -PRON- wordbox the matter anyhow 
i ask 
-PRON- have just discover that -PRON- be a robber say ocou be no robber here i answer no matter what i be in the place i come from 
once a robber always a robber retort ocou unless -PRON- touch the bolla 
well well murmur the professor rub -PRON- hand delightedly over the pedestal and give little heed to remark 
what do -PRON- call this machine mr ocou 
that sir ocou reply be a character indexograph 
-PRON- find -PRON- very useful in catalogue the natural tendency of subject of the realm 
-PRON- sigh 
the number of indexograph in the kingdom be limited and -PRON- have all be work overtime of late 
this be the first opportunity -PRON- have have to use one on -PRON- and -PRON- friend 
now professor if -PRON- will oblige -PRON- 
the professor drop down the disk glide over -PRON- bald head and another ideograph shoot into sight 
ah murmur ocou read the sign philanthropist scientist a man to counsel with do sir but -PRON- -PRON- shake -PRON- head sadly as -PRON- drop -PRON- talk machine suppose say watch ocou and -PRON- attendant make off with the indexograph that i shall be keep within this circle indefinitely 
let -PRON- hope not mr munn rejoin the professor lay a kindly hand on -PRON- arm 
rather let -PRON- hope that -PRON- will experience a moral rejuvenation so that when the indexograph be try on -PRON- at another time -PRON- will show a different result wish -PRON- would try that thing on archibald meig 
i exclaim 
the baigol would find i think that i have no monopoly on that particular ideograph 
the professor laugh quietly 
let -PRON- see what come to -PRON- now after -PRON- have be catalogue say -PRON- think -PRON- have simply be wait to make trial of -PRON- tendency before allow -PRON- to pass out of this enchant circle 
ocou come back in a couple of hour carry a roll of parchment in addition to -PRON- baton 
-PRON- come alone 
gentleman say -PRON- in -PRON- mechanical way -PRON- name have be enter and tag 
in accordance with the information secure through the indexograph a task have be set for -PRON- 
perform that task faithfully and -PRON- be to have the freedom of the realm 
what be the task mr ocou inquire the professor 
-PRON- be to restore the sacred bolla to -PRON- majesty the king of baigol 
and what be the bolla 
-PRON- be the stone of happiness and peace 
merely to touch -PRON- restore a mortal to health physical and moral 
crime be a contagious disease and since the bolla have be lose to -PRON- and untouched of any in the kingdom lawlessness have become widespread 
where be the bolla 
-PRON- be loan some season ago to the king of baigadd who now refuse to return -PRON- 
as baigadd be a more powerful country than ours -PRON- would be an act of destruction for -PRON- to make war for the stone 
so -PRON- king have graciously decree that mr munn shall proceed to the neighboring kingdom and steal the bolla take -PRON- along with -PRON- professor as adviser and general aide 
nothing could have please -PRON- more 
as i have state elsewhere in this narrative steal property from some one to whom that property do not rightfully belong can hardly be account a crime and when property thus purloin be restore to -PRON- rightful owner the theft be transform into a high and noble act 
such a task fill -PRON- with enthusiasm and i be ready to go forth among the fourhande enemy of baigol and demonstrate -PRON- ability 
the professor thinking of gilhooly would have welcome any undertaking which carry -PRON- into the neighboring realm 
ocou tell -PRON- that the king of baigadd be a very grasping individual although -PRON- be very careful to abstain from touch the bolla 
have -PRON- touch the wonderful stone so great be -PRON- power that -PRON- would have experience a change of heart immediately and could not have shirk return the property to -PRON- rightful owner 
king gaddbai be very wealthy accord to ocou draw -PRON- revenue principally from the kaka industry of which -PRON- have a monopoly 
ka be a fibrous plant from which kaka the only cloth know in the four kingdom be make 
this plant would grow nowhere else than in baigadd so that the people of the other three kingdom have to go to baigadd for -PRON- kirtle 
every time the king of baigadd suffer a pecuniary backset or donate a large sum to charity -PRON- recoup -PRON- exchequer by boost the price of kirtle 
there be a time ocou declare when all the inhabitant of njambai go clothe from neck to heel but wardrobe dwindle as the price of cloth rise 
very few people could now afford the luxury of a full suit and since the upper half of the body could not be cover with a garment -PRON- be cover with paintthe paint be usually of a color to match or harmonize with the kirtle 
a variety of black kaka be the only serviceable material to be have for write purpose ideograph be trace on -PRON- surface with white ink 
-PRON- be tell how gentleman once wealthy but who have fall upon evil day have draw upon -PRON- library for wear apparel 
book of poetry essay travel fiction all yield -PRON- leave to the making of various garment thereby clothe the body as comfortably as -PRON- have already clothe the mind 
what could be more apropos than a morning gown inscribe with choice ideographic sonnet 
or a student robe begemme with the brilliant wit of an essayist 
or a travel costume bear an account of some voyage of discovery 
the only fault to be find with this arrangement be that such clothing advertise the wearer poverty and in njambai as in terra the pride of wealth be most pronounce 
king gaddbai -PRON- appear have so enhance the cost of black kaka that literature lie languish 
writer have not the requisite material on which to inscribe -PRON- thought and the four kingdom be threaten with a blight of ignorance 
from what -PRON- hear of king gaddbai the professor and i be not dispose to regard -PRON- very favorably 
-PRON- seem a greedy and unscrupulous person more than ready to swell -PRON- coffer by trample on the right and the welfare of other 
the parchment roll bring by ocou be a map show -PRON- how to direct -PRON- step in order to reach baigadd 
ocou also deliver to -PRON- a royal banner direct from the hand of king golbai which be to procure -PRON- favor en route and entitle -PRON- to be receive and care for as ambassador when -PRON- reach the other kingdom 
the professor ask for a baton but this be deny -PRON- 
the baigol fear i suppose to trust such a terrible weapon in the hand of alien 
the professor pleasure over the prospect of be allow to leave -PRON- prison ring and journey in search of -PRON- friend while seek the bolla be mar somewhat by revelation 
-PRON- have hope to find njambai free of monopoly and greed and yet here be king gaddbai boost the price of kaka whenever the whim strike -PRON- and -PRON- have hope to find a people where poverty be unknown and yet -PRON- discover how the educate be oblige to raid -PRON- library in order to cover -PRON- nakedness 
human nature professor i expound be the same all over the universe 
if a man find -PRON- in a position to gouge -PRON- neighbor -PRON- be as apt to do -PRON- on jupiter or mercury as -PRON- be on terra be grievously discourage -PRON- sigh 
furthermore say -PRON- practicing on the wordbox could not have cause the havoc -PRON- imagine -PRON- may 
ocou tell -PRON- that since the bolla have be take from baigol lawlessness have be widespread and increase 
-PRON- rehearsal of the false sentiment contain in -PRON- book may have help on the lawlessness 
i be more sorry than i know how to express in find among this gifted people some of the bad element of -PRON- own civilization 
and -PRON- regret be the more pronounced on the score of popham meigs gilhooly and markham 
how do -PRON- figure in -PRON- disappointment 
i query -PRON- understand -PRON- cry have the same hope of -PRON- that i have of -PRON- 
suppose -PRON- find on this planet not a trace of monopoly or greed suppose -PRON- have find here a peaceloving justiceserve people with plenty to eat and wear need no law to govern -PRON- and all happy and contented 
the moral effect upon -PRON- and the rest of -PRON- friend would have be uplift 
-PRON- would have see admire and covet the same condition for -PRON- own orb 
a change would have be work in -PRON- and for the well 
that -PRON- go on passionately be the full measure of -PRON- disappointment 
so far from find such condition mr munn -PRON- be immediately catalogue as a thief and give a task commensurate with -PRON- suppose abilitiesa task or robbery 
but a righteous robbery i aver 
recover steal property and return -PRON- to the rightful owner be a meritorious act 
-PRON- must call -PRON- so -PRON- answer bitterly since so much hang upon -PRON- joint attempt 
but what a lesson for these poor benighted people 
the ability to get the stone be beyond -PRON- and -PRON- call upon -PRON- i pursue 
-PRON- action be flatter rather than otherwise 
if -PRON- succeed -PRON- mean that -PRON- shall stand even higher in -PRON- estimation 
-PRON- who ought to know better be make -PRON- live example of successful thievery 
the end justify the mean professor 
-PRON- must strive to think so suppose gilhooly have be catalogue the same as -PRON- and and that -PRON- be find to stand so high in traction affair that -PRON- let -PRON- not dwell upon poor gilhooly 
-PRON- be just where -PRON- ought to be i declare only wish -PRON- have a glimmering of sense still leave -PRON- in order that -PRON- may realize -PRON- position 
the effect would be salutary 
this frank expression of -PRON- view rather startled professor quinn 
-PRON- walk back and forth -PRON- hand clasp behind -PRON- and -PRON- head bow in deep thought 
the indexograph be a most remarkable invention -PRON- finally observe and would be of inestimable value on -PRON- native planet 
the detection of crime would be an easy matter and on the testimony of the indexograph alone justice could be mete out without the intermediate application of the court 
furthermore justice would never miscarry hope i exclaim in a panic that i shall never live to see the day when the police official of terra be equip with indexographs 
-PRON- would prove a knockout blow for -PRON- profession 
every citizen would be test and -PRON- proclivity jot down in black and white 
that would mean expand the professor that crime would be relegate to the limbo of lose art 
before a lawless act could be commit the artist in crime would be place where the deed would be impossible the way i figure -PRON- out professor 
but that be not the least of the indexographs merit 
child could be duly catalogued and if -PRON- show criminal tendency could be send to institution for proper moral training 
the inclination of the young toward certain trade could be learn and -PRON- could be give instruction along the line which would best serve -PRON- future career 
there would not be so many failure in life mr munn 
perhaps not i answer stubbornly but i still maintain that the overturning of -PRON- customary standard would land -PRON- in chaos 
tut -PRON- exclaim half angrily 
some day i trust -PRON- angle of vision will change materially 
until that time mr munn -PRON- would be well for -PRON- to repress -PRON- peculiar view for -PRON- be go to be sorry for -PRON- 
just three week to a day from the time -PRON- reach baigol -PRON- fare forth from the royal city bend upon the performance of -PRON- mission 
-PRON- be armed only with -PRON- wordboxe the king standard and a firm determination to achieve -PRON- liberty by secure the bolla no matter what the cost 
-PRON- journey lead -PRON- through a pleasant country level for the most part and cover with irrigated field grow the white blossom which the baigol gather and cook for food 
the king will as make know by the banner secure -PRON- rest by the way 
i have not consider -PRON- necessary to refer to the fact that there be light and darkness throughout the kingdom of baigol and baigadd during each period of twentyfour hour and three minute 
light and heat be send through the underworld by mean of the two huge reflector already mention and when the sun pass from the heaven of course night fall 
but the climate be at all time delightful 
-PRON- be armor against the temperature and could not -PRON- experience the equable air yet -PRON- eye and ear assure -PRON- of -PRON- presence and this prove another surprise for the professor 
by day -PRON- travel and by night -PRON- rest often cover as many as five hundred spatli in a single day 
four day at that rate be to carry -PRON- to the capital of the other kingdom 
i gather much wisdom from the professor as -PRON- journey and there be two of -PRON- conversation which make a deep impression on -PRON- 
the first have to do with the reflector that turn the sun ray into the bowel of the planet 
without the sun mr munn remark quinn indicate the white field beside -PRON- with a gesture of the hand there could be no vegetable life in baigol 
those field must be quicken to life by the solar ray or -PRON- would be as barren as the outer shell of the planet 
finite ingenuity may always be trust to accommodate -PRON- to -PRON- environment 
i can set the astronomer of terra right on one mystery at least 
what mystery do -PRON- refer to professor 
i ask 
why -PRON- answer a luminous point have be detect by earthly telescope on the disk of mercury 
the phenomenon have be explain as a huge mountain whose top reflect the sun yet -PRON- be only one of the great reflector fabricate by these ingenious people 
then at another time professor say have -PRON- make any discovery relative to that powerful little weapon which the baigol know so well how to use few -PRON- answer 
the baton be call a zetbai and -PRON- ammunition be draw from a peculiar ingredient of the atmosphere 
the white tip of the zetbai furnish the destructive force while the black tip combat and nullifie -PRON- 
the inhabitant of this orb mr munn have a weapon of such awful power in the zetbai that a dozen of -PRON- number arm with the baton could descend upon -PRON- own globe and devastate -PRON- 
well be -PRON- for terra that mean be lack for interplanetary communication otherwise the baigol and -PRON- fellowcreature may prove the napoleon of the universe 
such a contingency be terrible to contemplate 
have the zetbai anything to do with that invisible power that stay -PRON- from cross the circular wall 
-PRON- have everything to do with that 
an unseen barrier be place around usa barrier of zet draw from the atmosphere by these baigol and make to serve -PRON- end 
unlike powder and ball which destroy -PRON- in create destruction zet be indestructible -PRON- can be regathere into the zetbai and use over and over again 
the resist medium control by the black tip of the baton be alone powerful to annul the energy of the white tip 
these be the point that impress -PRON- 
another which -PRON- discuss but which do not appeal to -PRON- as logical or accurate have to do with the object of -PRON- questthe bolla 
with all due respect to mr ocou say -PRON- be certainly talk moonshine when -PRON- describe the bolla would not go so far as to say -PRON- be talk moonshine mr munn the professor answer 
there be strange thing in heaven earth and mercury than be dream of in -PRON- philosophy 
take -PRON- for instance 
-PRON- be a sick man never sick in -PRON- life i declare mean morally go on quinn 
if crime be a disease -PRON- will admit i think that -PRON- be sick 
no i aver be healthy in mind and body 
i take no stock in mr assertionswhich ought to prove that i be mentally sound i take -PRON- 
but well get this palladium just the same for -PRON- liberty depend on -PRON- 
toward noon of the fourth day as -PRON- draw near the boundary of baigadd -PRON- enter a rocky and uneven country the welldefine road -PRON- have be follow cut and circle through the low hill 
when -PRON- be well in among the bowlder a frantic shout reach -PRON- from around a bend in the road a few spatli ahead 
that be a cry in -PRON- own tongue mr munn exclaim the professor come to a halt 
do -PRON- not hear -PRON- 
-PRON- be certainly a call for help 
-PRON- be right sir i answer 
that be a lusty english yell if i ever hear one 
-PRON- be give by one of -PRON- friend of course 
no doubt -PRON- be not hard to distinguish a human voice from the bleat of one of these baigol wordboxe 
possibly the new motive power of the interplanetary have rebel and be flee this way 
no answer the professor excitedly do not think that shout come from gilhooly 
-PRON- be ah mr meigs 
at that instant archibald meig come bound into sight around the bend 
but -PRON- be not the wellgroome richly apparel mr meig of earth and the steel car 
-PRON- only garment be a kirtle 
-PRON- must have be surprise at see -PRON- but so great be -PRON- fear that -PRON- do not show -PRON- 
panic leave no room for any other emotion 
quinn 
munn 
save mesave -PRON- from the soldier 
a few dozen prodigious leap bring -PRON- tremble to -PRON- vicinity and -PRON- fall exhausted to -PRON- knee 
-PRON- -PRON- cry the professor 
what have happen mr meigs 
how be -PRON- that -PRON- find -PRON- in condition a wretched man wail meig grab the professor knee in the stress of -PRON- emotion 
-PRON- have get to save -PRON- professor quinn 
-PRON- be -PRON- who bring -PRON- to this awful planet and if i be slay -PRON- blood will be upon -PRON- head 
that be meig for -PRON- 
even in -PRON- dire extremity -PRON- do not forget to heap censure upon the head of -PRON- great savant 
-PRON- be not go to be slay say the professor confidently 
but these creature be as venomous as centipede murmur meig suffer -PRON- to be lift erect by the professor 
horror 
there -PRON- come now 
oh this be too much too much 
meig get behind the professor 
turn -PRON- eye toward the bend -PRON- see a detachment of the baigadd army just hurl -PRON- into sight 
-PRON- have make some acquaintance with military affair in baigol 
soldier as may be surmise be armed with zetbais but wordboxe be keep out of the rank 
only officer carry talk machine matter be order on the principle that private be to hear and obey 
each soldier wield two zetbaisone with each pair of handsthereby enormously increase -PRON- capacity for destruction 
the fighting force of baigol -PRON- have be inform although organize on a small scale be equip and maneuvre exactly as be the military arm of baigadd 
the detachment approach at a doublequick in pursuit of meig be as -PRON- afterward find a company of gaddbaizet or royal guard 
-PRON- number fifty wear yellow kirtle have the torso gild and be command by a single officer carry nothing but a wordbox 
the sight of the professor and -PRON- cause the gaddbaizet to come to an abrupt halt 
-PRON- have undoubtedly hear of -PRON- but -PRON- be far from expect to encounter -PRON- there at that time 
the officer be the first to recover -PRON- wit and approach the place where -PRON- be stand hold -PRON- talk machine over -PRON- head and punch -PRON- key vigorously 
-PRON- first word be a command to the soldier hold -PRON- zetbais and make no move against these fierce colossi until -PRON- get further order from -PRON- 
then to -PRON- behemoth 
whence come -PRON- and why be -PRON- protect the monster in the red kirtle 
meig -PRON- could easily be see be not on familiar term with the wordboxe 
so far as -PRON- be concern the captain word fall on deaf ear 
-PRON- be from baigol say the professor give an amiable twist to -PRON- word by a deft use of key and come on an errand from the king of that country 
this gentleman be a friend of ours friend screech the captain machine 
-PRON- be a thief and have steal a hundred djin of kaka from -PRON- sovereign storehouse 
i thrill an amused laugh on the seventh key of -PRON- own machine 
how do -PRON- know -PRON- be a thief 
i ask 
do -PRON- try the indexograph on -PRON- do the talk mr munn say the professor in -PRON- own tongue then add to the officer there must be some mistake captain 
this gentleman have a very good reputation and would not commit a theft such as -PRON- describe 
-PRON- bear the proof of -PRON- upon -PRON- person answer the captain 
-PRON- be the kirtle 
now a djin be a unit of measurement and correspond to the inch of -PRON- system from which -PRON- follow that meigs stand convict of steal about eight foot of red kakaenough to make kirtle for a score of the baigadd 
what be -PRON- harp about ask meig 
-PRON- say -PRON- be a thief mr meig say thief -PRON- bluster glare at the captain over the professor shoulder deny -PRON- sir i deny -PRON- 
-PRON- say -PRON- steal that kirtle -PRON- have on i continue man have a right to clothe -PRON- as well as -PRON- may answer meig aggrieve do not count that theft 
the country should see that a man be provide with a respectable covering 
this be too good an opportunity for the professor to let slip 
suffer -PRON- mind to drift back to -PRON- own planet sir say -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- opinion that -PRON- government owe every poor man a suit of clothe 
archibald meig cringe under the blow 
-PRON- be a thrust at -PRON- clothing trust and -PRON- find the weak point in -PRON- armor 
circumstance be different here -PRON- mumble 
in some way yes in other way no 
king gaddbai be the monopolist of this planet 
-PRON- control the kaka output and charge for -PRON- accordingly 
the captain of the royal guard be grow impatient 
if -PRON- be here on an errand from the king of baigol say -PRON- -PRON- shall be glad to escort -PRON- to the capitalbut not until -PRON- have surrender the giant who steal the king property 
take -PRON- to -PRON- majesty return the professor and -PRON- will explain everything in a satisfactory manner 
but this the captain would not do and -PRON- become so threatening that -PRON- retreat behind a barrier of bowlder 
display the banner mr munn say the professor and i hold up the royal standard so that the captain could not help but see -PRON- 
-PRON- one eye gleam insolently and -PRON- come as near swear as the seventh key of -PRON- wordbox would allow 
deliver up the thief -PRON- order or i will command -PRON- man to annihilate -PRON- with -PRON- zetbais 
-PRON- be certainly a critical situation 
i have already have a slight experience with the overpower property of zet and didnot care for further acquaintance with -PRON- 
meig be nothing to -PRON- 
-PRON- would have strip the coat from a poor man back if -PRON- could have have -PRON- way on earth and -PRON- afford -PRON- secret pleasure to see -PRON- hoist by -PRON- own petard 
the trust magnate do not fail to take note of the warlike movement of the soldier -PRON- do anything to save -PRON- professor -PRON- plead 
-PRON- shall not give -PRON- up answer quinn firmly 
can -PRON- think of any way mr munn whereby -PRON- can extricate -PRON- from this difficulty 
i have a quick mind if i do say -PRON- and a happy thought present -PRON- on the spur of the instant 
stooping i pick up a stone then raise -PRON- i let the missile fly straight at the captain 
-PRON- shoulderarm still hold the wordbox above -PRON- head and the stone smash against -PRON- and carry -PRON- away 
-PRON- be rather neatly do for the captain -PRON- be leave untouched 
bravo cry the professor 
-PRON- draw the fang of the enemy by that trick mr munn 
-PRON- have render the captain mute and -PRON- man can not act without order 
i have already figure this out in -PRON- mind and -PRON- be presently prove that i have not go far from the mark 
the captain recover the wordbox and attempt to use -PRON- but -PRON- mechanism be so disarranged that the order to attack become a confused jumble that seem to sound a retreat 
the whole company whirl and flee -PRON- leader follow and gesticulate wildly and helplessly with -PRON- arm 
meig be save for the present and -PRON- should have thank -PRON- for itbut -PRON- do not 
seat -PRON- on a bowlder -PRON- gaze pensively down at the red kirtle 
this be what i call the irony of fate say -PRON- in a morose tone 
and then on top of -PRON- all to be call a thief 
-PRON- lean -PRON- bare elbow on -PRON- knee and drop -PRON- face in -PRON- hand 
how do this happen mr meig ask the professor gently 
happen cry meig lift -PRON- head with a jerk and glare at quinn 
-PRON- would never have happen but for -PRON- 
have -PRON- see gilhooly go on the professor ignore the reproach 
poor gilhooly sigh meigs 
-PRON- have become a power in the traction interest of the country 
the last i see of -PRON- -PRON- be haul train throughout the kingdom 
-PRON- know that much already 
how about popham and markham 
alas groan meigs 
popham be work like a galleyslave in a coal mine and these little fiend be slowly starve -PRON- to death 
all markham do be to wander about the kingdom with a plate and a paddle beg food enough to keep body and soul together 
think of -PRON- 
and the great augustus popham owner of a control interest in all the great anthracite and bituminous field of earth delve in the mine of this planetno better than a miner 
coal field 
i exclaim 
what do -PRON- need of coal in these underground kingdom 
-PRON- use the coal in the kingdom of baijinkz and baigossh which be situate at the pole explain the professor 
during the long night in those country a certain degree of cold must prevail here quinn turn again to -PRON- what happen to -PRON- and the other two gentleman during the storm which separate -PRON- 
-PRON- manage to regain the car reply meig 
-PRON- could not get in of course because -PRON- have the key but -PRON- hang to the latticework at the window 
i be a little hazy as to what happen after that but i think the car must have be pick up by a terrific gust and throw to the bottom of that crater in the volcano 
ah murmur the professor look at -PRON- 
-PRON- remember mr munn i tell -PRON- i fear something of the kind would happen 
i nod 
proceed mr meig add the professor 
this be all intensely interesting 
be the car seriously damage havenot see the car resume meigs hiatus follow the blow away of the castle and when i open -PRON- eye again i be a prisoner in the hand of a legion of those oneeye creature 
for two week i be keep confinedan object of curiosity for the whole kingdom if i could judge from the way the little imp flock to stare at -PRON- 
after a time i be lead off to a place where i join popham and markham 
need i tell -PRON- how affect that meeting be 
popham shed tear and both markham and -PRON- be nearly unmanned 
-PRON- captor have some sort of a contrivance consist of a small shaft and cord 
one end of the cord be put to head and a slide fly up on the end of the shaft 
then markham be lead off give a plate and paddle and cast adrift 
popham be the next one to have the queer machine try on -PRON- 
when -PRON- be remove -PRON- turn come 
meig wring -PRON- hand despairingly 
after the storm -PRON- continue with an effort -PRON- costume be not as complete as i would have have -PRON- but those impudent creature denude -PRON- still further 
in selfdefense i be force to steal this red cloth and run for -PRON- life 
oh -PRON- be terrible 
woe be -PRON- that i should ever have live to see this day 
some good may come out of this unfortunate experience mr meig say the professor 
good almost shout meigs 
sir -PRON- express -PRON- strangely 
be -PRON- good to have a man use to such luxury as i have be flee through these rocky underground hill merely because -PRON- commit theft in order to retain -PRON- selfrespect 
have a care sir 
do not think for a moment that i be under any misapprehension as to the real cause of -PRON- sorry situation 
the king of this country be evidently a man of a humorous and practical turn observe professor quinn after a little thought 
the indexograph make -PRON- familiar with the natural bent of -PRON- three gentleman and -PRON- be seek to show -PRON- the error of -PRON- way 
on earth -PRON- be at one end of a trust here -PRON- be place at the other end 
really i think the experience will prove most wholesome 
archibald meig stare at the speaker with distend eye 
be -PRON- possible say -PRON- that -PRON- brain have be turn like nonsense 
i strike in 
the professor head be as clear as a bell get the right of this thing meigs 
the king of baigadd be make -PRON- take a little of the medicine -PRON- measure out in such large dose on the other planet 
-PRON- be both crazy snarl meig never strip a man to -PRON- hide and throw -PRON- out in the cold worlda the king of this country have do to -PRON- in a figurative sense 
-PRON- donot know how much evil -PRON- have do say quinn an expression on -PRON- face similar to the one i have see when -PRON- jerk the lever and shoot -PRON- into the unknown 
-PRON- have take -PRON- pound of flesh mr meig but be now under the heel of a monopoly -PRON- 
stuff cry meig 
-PRON- will talk no longer about a matter in which -PRON- display such poor judgment 
although i have tell -PRON- -PRON- story i have hear little of yours 
be i to conclude that -PRON- and munn purposely cut loose from -PRON- and -PRON- friend 
after bring -PRON- to this miserable planet do -PRON- have the heart willfully to abandon -PRON- 
not at all meig say the professor hastily 
i wonder if meig have forget all about the attempt -PRON- and -PRON- friend have make to abandon the professor and -PRON- 
-PRON- be one of the most inconsistent man i have ever encounter 
like -PRON- and the other mr meig continue the professor mr munn and i be take prisoner but -PRON- be not treat with the same barbarity as the rest of -PRON- burst out meig -PRON- small mind find even that a cause for temper 
-PRON- who engineer the plot and plunge -PRON- all into these terrific difficulty escape the consequence 
what be that banner 
-PRON- be under the protection of the ruler of the neighboring kingdom of baigol 
that be the royal standard 
ah say meig bitterly -PRON- be even receive at courtyou and a professed thiefwhile markham popham gilhooly and i be no more than outcast 
be there no such thing as justice even on this disgusting planet 
look at -PRON- 
look at -PRON- -PRON- final request for -PRON- to look at -PRON- be a frantic wail 
-PRON- yank savagely at -PRON- kirtle and twist -PRON- bare foot around in fearsome dejection 
-PRON- be look at -PRON- mr meig observe the professor quietly 
do -PRON- find any pleasure in the spectacle 
do not -PRON- situation arouse even a spark of pity 
i do not ask munn for -PRON- sympathy but -PRON- professor quinn although criminally careless in evolve plan and carry -PRON- out be a scientist and -PRON- must have a heart 
-PRON- heart be wring with -PRON- misfortune reply the professor gently but i realize that desperate disease require desperate remedy 
what disease be -PRON- refer to snapped meig suddenly change -PRON- tack and what remedy 
the disease that afflict -PRON- common country and which -PRON- would deny and ridicule be i even to name -PRON- 
the remedy too -PRON- would consider no remedy at all but a useless infliction of discomfort and mental anguish 
what -PRON- be undergo mr meig be not accidental but providential 
the working of fate be as marvelous as -PRON- be effective 
patience a little and -PRON- shall see what -PRON- shall see 
this be no time for oracular remark scowl meig 
these fourhande oneeyed demon be force gilhooly markham popham and -PRON- steadily toward destruction 
gilhooly daft as -PRON- be be pull -PRON- heart out on -PRON- ugly little transportation system markham be gallop from place to place pound -PRON- paddle against -PRON- dish and beg a few morsel of food popham be work like a galleyslave and -PRON- wage already insufficient to give -PRON- the necessary food -PRON- require for -PRON- heartbreake labor be be systematically cut down as for -PRON- the army of baigadd be at -PRON- heel 
baigadd and in -PRON- extreme discouragement meig give vent to a wild mirthless laugh 
baigadd and baigol 
-PRON- sound like expletive from -PRON- own good planet but altogether too mild to express the state of -PRON- feeling 
be calm adjure the professor with an apprehensive look at -PRON- 
calm echo meig brokenly shall be as mad as gilhooly if this keep up much long 
-PRON- start forward with a truculent air 
what be -PRON- go to do for -PRON- quinn -PRON- cry 
how be -PRON- go to get -PRON- out of this fix 
those infernal little soldier go away but -PRON- will come back again 
then what 
-PRON- be here in the role of ambassador answer the professor and munn an ambassador sneer meig draw away from -PRON- 
and as such -PRON- be entitle to some courtesy at the hand of king baigadd 
i feel quite sure that when the high authority understand -PRON- be -PRON- friend -PRON- will be lenient in -PRON- treatment of -PRON- 
that be rather a vague supposition on which to ground a man hope of life or death mutter meigs 
-PRON- be all -PRON- can fall back on mr meigs 
there be but six of -PRON- on this small planet and -PRON- must make the inhabitant -PRON- friend 
if -PRON- do not annihilation will overtake the lot of -PRON- 
-PRON- be fool ever to land on mercury in the first place pursue meig still wild and unreasoning 
-PRON- stamp with -PRON- bare foot to emphasize -PRON- anger and a sharp stone unexpectedly give point to -PRON- 
with a howl of pain -PRON- catch -PRON- foot in -PRON- hand 
i have never be call particularly hardhearte but somehow i take a measure of enjoyment out of all this 
however i have the grace to turn -PRON- head and conceal the smile 
-PRON- must be careful mr meig warn the professor 
sit down and rest -PRON- 
rest fume meig just as though such a thing be possible 
i be one of the miserable victim of -PRON- duplicity and if i could have recourse to the law of -PRON- planet for about an hour i would soon put -PRON- where -PRON- belong 
be sensible i strike in perhaps illadvisedly 
-PRON- act like a whip schoolboy meig hear nothing from -PRON- -PRON- cry glare at -PRON- 
as i be say mr meig proceed the professor mr munn and although -PRON- appear to be free be nevertheless virtual prisoner of the king of baigol 
-PRON- be be send to baigadd upon an important mission and on -PRON- success or failure depend very largely that will do interrupt the broker irritably donot care to hear an account of -PRON- experience quinn 
-PRON- be evident i think that -PRON- and munn have not be cross by the same adversity which have overtake -PRON- and the other 
i have a demand to make 
meig arise from the bowlder and strike an attitude which -PRON- intend to be both dignified and compelling 
with -PRON- unshaven face and red kirtle -PRON- succeed only in make -PRON- ludicrous 
what be the demand inquire quinn 
-PRON- and munn be fairly wellclothe reply meig and i demand that -PRON- share -PRON- distress to the extent of donate enough of -PRON- own clothing to make -PRON- presentable 
on the impulse of the moment the professor begin remove -PRON- coat 
when the garment be half off -PRON- change -PRON- mind and slip back into -PRON- again 
no -PRON- return 
-PRON- have make -PRON- own bed mr meig and i think -PRON- should lie in -PRON- until -PRON- experience a change of heart 
when -PRON- can truly say to mr munn and -PRON- that -PRON- realize how sadly mistaken -PRON- be on the other planet -PRON- will share -PRON- distressbut not till then 
out on -PRON- for a pair of heartless wretch exclaim the broker angrily 
-PRON- reasoning be false and i will never yield assent to -PRON- 
i wash -PRON- hand of both of -PRON- go through the if -PRON- path should cross in the future -PRON- be -PRON- desire that -PRON- pass as stranger 
-PRON- glare at -PRON- turn on -PRON- bare heel and make -PRON- way to the road 
then -PRON- stride off in the direction of the bend 
-PRON- watch -PRON- silently the professor with apprehension and i with unrestrained enjoyment 
as -PRON- be about to vanish from -PRON- sight -PRON- see -PRON- come to a startled halt gaze off along the road that lie beyond the bend then throw up -PRON- arm whirl and race back to -PRON- come -PRON- shout frantically the whole army be come 
be there no way -PRON- can save -PRON- gentleman 
think for mercys sake think 
meig be continually build barrier between -PRON- and the professor and -PRON- only to knock -PRON- down again whenever the slight danger threaten -PRON- 
have i be the one to decide -PRON- should then and there have be leave to shift for -PRON- 
have courage mr meig say professor quinn 
-PRON- be -PRON- hope that some high personage may be with the approach army in which event the royal banner give -PRON- by the king of baigol will be respect and prove the salvation of all three of -PRON- 
this great and good man be utterly incapable of harbor resentment against any one 
-PRON- beguile the plutocrat into -PRON- castle i grant -PRON- and shuffle -PRON- from the scene of -PRON- grievous labor yet this be not because -PRON- love the rich man less but the poor man more 
as i write these word piece -PRON- narrative together out of -PRON- commonplace book a wave of affection and reverence roll over -PRON- 
and often i steal forth o night when sky be propitious gaze at mercury through -PRON- telescope and can almost fancy -PRON- in communion with the gentle soul forever lose to -PRON- native planet 
but i anticipate 
the retreat gaddbaizet have reach headquarter and acquaint the high chief in command with the fact that two more colossi have appear so the major part of the king force have be order out 
by tactful maneuvre -PRON- be approach from all side 
a cordon be draw around usa cordon of soldier with -PRON- flash zetbais present 
one hostile move would have place the seal on -PRON- death warrant 
the high chief perhaps fear -PRON- wordbox may be wreck as -PRON- captain have be have evidently lay plan and give all order in advance of -PRON- attack on -PRON- position 
the assault be noiseless swift and sure 
when completely surround by the troop a number of the soldier disengage -PRON- from various point of the circle 
these soldier carry lance at least ten foot long 
the lance be hold high and to the point of each the upper edge of a net be make fast the low edge of the net trailing along the ground 
as the lanceman advance the net take the form of a rapidly contract circle the professor meig and -PRON- in the centre 
in less than five minute -PRON- three colossi be stoutly encompass by the net hurl together and throw in a helpless jumble 
the web be finely weave and of a material that defy -PRON- effort to break through -PRON- 
professor quinn make a fierce attempt to use -PRON- wordbox but -PRON- be hold so rigidly that -PRON- could not do so 
one by one -PRON- be disentangle the upper part of -PRON- body be wrap about in section of the net so that only -PRON- leg be free and -PRON- be force to proceed with -PRON- captor the army march on every side of -PRON- 
meig be loudly bewail -PRON- evil fortune 
take heart man cry quinn 
if i can see the king or get word to -PRON- i be sure that all will yet be well all day with -PRON- return meig with a groan and -PRON- can not make -PRON- believe otherwise 
there be no twilight in the neth kingdom 
day leap into night as swiftly as a curtain fall on a stage play 
long before -PRON- reach -PRON- destination -PRON- be in stygian blackness 
there be no artificial illuminant know to the creature of the underworld and -PRON- have no need of -PRON- 
-PRON- single eye be gift with power to see at night almost as keenly as in the daytime 
when -PRON- have travel several hour -PRON- be make to halt and a circle of zet similar to the one that have imprison quinn and -PRON- in baigol be rear around -PRON- 
thereupon -PRON- be free of the net and leave to -PRON- 
the instant -PRON- be able to make use of -PRON- hand the professor grab -PRON- wordbox and begin shoot question into the opaque gloom that hem -PRON- in 
why have -PRON- take -PRON- prisoner 
what harm have -PRON- ever do -PRON- 
-PRON- be under the protection of king golbai 
do not the captain of the other detachment so inform -PRON- 
answer come back -PRON- have be take prisoner because -PRON- resist the royal authority and try to protect a man who steal good from -PRON- regal master 
theft of good from -PRON- majestys storehouse be punishable with death 
even ambassador from king golbai be not above the law of -PRON- realm 
what be to be -PRON- fate 
zet be the laconic answer 
-PRON- will all three be slay by the executionergeneral as soon as may be after the great reflector send -PRON- first gleam of day through the kingdom 
that end the professor talk with -PRON- unseen enemy who presumably be the high chief of the force 
-PRON- be sufficiently discourage although i be reckless enough to ease -PRON- feeling with a few expletive on key 7the most insolent and defiant that i have learn in baigol 
mr munn mr munn cry quinn in rebuke 
this be no time to express -PRON- in that key be not endow with -PRON- magnificent forbearance professor say and i have to say something -PRON- all about anyway ask meig 
-PRON- be to die at sunrise meig i answer roughly or as soon after sunrise as the executionergeneral may find -PRON- convenient would have spare mr meig that information say the professor 
-PRON- ought to have time to prepare -PRON- i return 
as the night be far spend i be go to turn in and snatch forty wink against the time the reflector begin to work 
good night professor i add as i stretch out on the ground donot amount to much more than meig and will never be miss but i be sorry for -PRON- 
quinn grope for -PRON- hand 
life in -PRON- be a small thing say -PRON- no matter whether -PRON- be long or short 
-PRON- be what -PRON- do with life that count mr munn have no regret for what i have do with -PRON- i declare 
and i have not 
conscience do not accuse -PRON- in the least 
never have i take a penny from those who could not afford to lose -PRON- 
think again mr munn implore the professor would not have -PRON- face -PRON- doom in that mental attitude 
surely -PRON- sense be not blunt to the evil of -PRON- past life 
sir i answer imbue to the core with the sophistry that have make -PRON- what i be have be a financier in a small way 
not have the requisite capital for large operation i be compel to work in a small way 
-PRON- business however while -PRON- may not have be as legitimate be every whit as honest as that of meig and -PRON- associate 
if -PRON- man would stop that useless palaver call meig from somewhere in the dark and try to think of some way for make -PRON- escape -PRON- would be put in -PRON- time to well advantage 
never mind -PRON- professor say this be probably the last opportunity -PRON- shall ever have for an extended talk 
at such a time a man speak from the heart and i want -PRON- to know just where i stand 
just a moment mr munn 
the professor turn -PRON- head to answer meigs 
-PRON- be impossible for -PRON- to escape say -PRON- 
even if -PRON- could get away from here -PRON- should find the entire country in arm against -PRON- 
possibly -PRON- could get back to that other benighted kingdom from which -PRON- and the thief come accredit as ambassador return meig 
-PRON- be a hard journey from here mr meig and -PRON- should be overtaken and recapture before -PRON- could cross the border into a friendly country 
before -PRON- could take to flight however -PRON- should have to beat down the barrier of zet that hem -PRON- in 
that as i know from experience be out of the question 
meig begin to complain and to find fault and the professor turn from -PRON- and go on talk with -PRON- have bring these trouble upon -PRON- mr munn -PRON- continue a sad note in -PRON- voice and upon the other 
-PRON- seem impossible to accomplish any great good without cause some small amount of misery let -PRON- situation worry -PRON- i remark 
while constantly exercise -PRON- wit to secure the good fortune for -PRON- i have always make -PRON- a point to be prepare for the bad 
i shall face the zetbais in the morning without the quiver of an eyelid misunderstand -PRON- mr munn say the professor earnestly 
while i grieve that matter should have fall out in this fashion yet i would not undo the one thing which bring -PRON- into these troubled water 
in other word i would rather be here in njambai with death stare -PRON- in the face than back there on terra with meigs markham popham and gilhooly free to work out -PRON- nefarious plan the spirit 
i cry warmly the spirit that have put many a man in the penitentiary call meig who appear to be follow -PRON- conversation even if -PRON- be not take any part in -PRON- 
i turn with a stinging reply on -PRON- lip but the professor drop a hand on -PRON- arm and i hold -PRON- peace 
-PRON- be share together -PRON- last few hour say -PRON- and let -PRON- have no quarrelsome talk 
personally i have a good deal of charity for meigs 
-PRON- be a man who until very recently have be accustom to have score of people wait upon -PRON- slight nod 
here -PRON- have be subject to much indignity and at the hand of a people whom -PRON- believe to be -PRON- inferior 
naturally that render -PRON- disagreeable 
-PRON- may at least have the grace to leave -PRON- alone i answer 
not so mr munn 
-PRON- be perfectly right in badger -PRON- 
i be at fault so far as -PRON- and -PRON- associate be concerned and -PRON- know -PRON- 
i do not expect approbation at -PRON- hand but at the hand of those in faraway terra whom -PRON- drastic action have help 
-PRON- calm acceptance of -PRON- fate be so different from the attitude of meig that -PRON- touch -PRON- deeply 
-PRON- have the same cause to blame and abuse -PRON- and yet -PRON- let the opportunity pass 
-PRON- have be worth something professor i respond to stand at -PRON- side and to pass through these remarkable adventure shoulder to shoulder with -PRON- 
thank -PRON- for that -PRON- friend have no doubt i continue that if -PRON- and i be to be spare -PRON- may in time lead -PRON- to see what -PRON- be dispose to call the error of -PRON- way for -PRON- be a master hand at argue but as i be at present i feel that -PRON- chance in the next world be as good as any one 
the rich have take from the poor in a way that the law sanction and i have take from the rich in a way the law do not sanction and in a few rare instance have give to the poor nothing in that to oppress -PRON- conscience 
the only thing i be sorry for be that i enter -PRON- castle with -PRON- felonious intention centre upon -PRON- property 
now that i know -PRON- so well -PRON- plan to steal from -PRON- look more like a crime than anything else i have do 
munn -PRON- reply -PRON- grieve -PRON- to think that -PRON- career be to be cut short before -PRON- have have an opportunity to reform -PRON- sigh be no escape fate on -PRON- own planet or on this 
good night to -PRON- 
i be dogtire and go off into slumber the moment i close -PRON- eye 
about the last thing i hear be the peevish voice of meig resist what little comfort the professor try to offer -PRON- 
i be arouse by the professor 
the first gleam of day mr munn say -PRON- bend over -PRON- with a quiet smile 
i rub -PRON- eye and get the cobwebs out of -PRON- brain 
yes -PRON- be the first gleam of dayour last day 
-PRON- be in an open square in the heart of a diminutive city 
from every side radiate trim little street border thickly with white dwelling 
in front of -PRON- be a palace rise dome upon dome until -PRON- stand full thirty foot high 
inhabitant of the royal city be already abroad walk rapidly or gather in group and use -PRON- wordboxe excitedly 
toot toot 
the familiar sound come from a distance and i spring erect and with the professor gaze in the direction from which -PRON- reach -PRON- 
presently gilhooly come along with a loaded train 
-PRON- halt in front of the palace the passenger disembark and gilhooly bent over the car pick -PRON- up carefully and turn -PRON- the other way along the groove 
all aboard -PRON- cry and a minute later -PRON- be off and away 
poor gilhooly murmur quinn 
-PRON- be bring excursionist to witness -PRON- execution 
i be glad that -PRON- do not know what -PRON- be do and that meigs be asleep 
quinn lay -PRON- hand on -PRON- shoulder deeply regret mr munn -PRON- go on that i be the indirect cause of lunacy 
-PRON- be a great surprise to -PRON- to find that -PRON- intellect be not strong enough to withstand the ordeal to which i subject -PRON- 
-PRON- couldnot be help professor i return 
-PRON- be a grand idea of yoursthat of abduct these trust magnate and place -PRON- where -PRON- could do no harm to the poor of -PRON- planet 
what though one mind have be wreck 
well that than the misery and enslavement of hundred of thousand 
mr munn say the professor with feel thank -PRON- 
such word from a companion who be about to suffer jointly with -PRON- the extreme penalty prove that -PRON- be a man of part and fit for a nobler walk in life than the one -PRON- have heretofore take 
i be very very sorry that -PRON- be to be cut off so soon 
quinn be fortitude -PRON- -PRON- courage bear of a knowledge of duty well do 
i be prone to believe also that i -PRON- be not less firm although a less laudable cause lie back of -PRON- 
the square i should judge measure about two hundred foot on each side 
while the professor and i be engage in talk sightseer have be gather in the street keep carefully to the sidewalk boundary of the open space 
every eye be turn upon the professor and -PRON- and the sleep meigs 
the broker be snore dismally the sound rumble above the babble of the wordboxe and echo through the adjacent thoroughfare 
what have happen to the executionergeneral 
i say to the professor 
-PRON- isnot very punctual in keep -PRON- engagement with -PRON- -PRON- seem to -PRON- 
-PRON- have have daylight for an hour 
something have go wrong mr munn quinn answer take note of a ripple of excitement that run through the crowd around -PRON- 
ah 
here come the high chief of the military force 
-PRON- have -PRON- wordbox ready so i suppose -PRON- be go to explain 
the high chief be push through the throng into the square two of -PRON- hand hold a wordbox and the other two a zetbai 
advance upon -PRON- -PRON- halt just without the ring 
be patient gentleman -PRON- say through -PRON- talk machine 
-PRON- will not be keep wait much long 
-PRON- be not so wildly impatient as -PRON- seem to think i send back at -PRON- whereupon -PRON- titter a little with key seeing that i be get ready to use the same key for a few expletive the professor make haste to break in 
what have happen -PRON- ask 
-PRON- have just be discover that there be no white paint in the king storehouse reply the high chief 
what be the white paint to be use for come curiously from the professor 
the executionergeneral be oblige by law to give -PRON- a fresh coat of white paint at every execution 
-PRON- would be impossible for -PRON- to perform -PRON- function without first comply with the statute 
could not some one else who have be freshly decorate do the work in -PRON- stead 
i inquire somewhat flippantly 
no answer the high chief 
-PRON- be the only one in the kingdom who be duly empower to execute criminal 
-PRON- executioner be a proud person and jealous of the prerogative of -PRON- office 
-PRON- receive no less than two kano for every happy dispatch that -PRON- perform 
in this case -PRON- will be the rich by six kano so -PRON- will understand how anxious -PRON- be to have everything do as -PRON- should be 
a kano be the equivalent of a half cent of -PRON- own money so that -PRON- onetime millionaire mr archibald meig be to yield up -PRON- valuable life and help swell the income to the extent of a single copper 
have -PRON- be awake i should have explain the matter to -PRON- so that -PRON- may have still further expatiate upon the irony of fate 
this kingdom of baigadd differ from the other kingdom with which -PRON- have already make acquaintance in one material respect the surface of the country have shrink much farther from the outer crust of the planet 
in baigol for instance -PRON- be always able to see the vault that cover -PRON- but in baigadd the sight reach into nothing but empty space 
shortly after the high chief have finish speak there come a flourish of wordboxe from the direction of the palace 
turn -PRON- eye toward that point -PRON- behold two resplendent soldier in turret to right and leave of the richly hang balcony 
hail to -PRON- munificent sovereign gaddbai ruler of the realm and mighty monarch of njambai 
thus the pan of the soldier

then proceed with -PRON- preparation 
i would have this matter over with as quick as possible 
of course quinn and i understand all this 
i know that the professor be meditate a final appeal to the king and -PRON- shoot a strange look at -PRON- as -PRON- tremble hand lift -PRON- wordbox 
before the executionergeneral proceed -PRON- majesty remark the professor -PRON- finger none too steady will -PRON- allow -PRON- a word 
-PRON- majesty give an exclamation of surprise 
where have -PRON- learn -PRON- language -PRON- inquire

-PRON- come from that country on a visit to -PRON- under the protection of the royal banner of golbai 
the professor nod to -PRON- and i shake out the banner and hold -PRON- aloft 
-PRON- royal friend say gaddbai should have be more particular in choose the subject -PRON- send to visit -PRON- realm

for that lawless act death have be decree to all three of -PRON- and the sentence must be carry out 
but -PRON- be ignorant of the law plead the professor 
ignorance of the law be no excuse 
the gentleman in the red kirtle be a friend of -PRON- if -PRON- know a person by the company -PRON- keep that speak ill for -PRON- interrupt the sovereign 
-PRON- be determined to have -PRON- slay -PRON- majesty 
-PRON- be -PRON- royal will 
then i shall have to set force at work to combat the royal will say the professor calmly 
cry of consternation and anger go up on every hand 
the king rise wrathfully from -PRON- seat 
-PRON- dare to dispute -PRON- authority -PRON- demand dare to dispute -PRON- ability to slay -PRON- return quinn 
-PRON- executioner will disappear from before -PRON- eye if -PRON- attempt -PRON- 
the king laugh ironically 
-PRON- shall see -PRON- say sink placidly back on -PRON- seat 
let the executionergeneral proceed with -PRON- preparation 
i be greatly pleased with the drift of affair 
circumstance have conspire to favor -PRON- and the professor be make the most of -PRON- opportunity 
the executionergeneral motion to one of -PRON- attendant and then raise -PRON- four hand above -PRON- head 
a moment later the attendant have seize the whitewash brush dab -PRON- into the antigravity compound and with two quick stroke have cover the executioner chest and back 
have a third stroke be need -PRON- could not have be give 
in a flash the official have be snatch away vanish like a streak of white in the void above 
the king rise gasping clutch at the balcony rail 
the throng around -PRON- be paralyze for a space and not a wordbox be hear 
as for quinn -PRON- have strike an attitude -PRON- left hand raise aloft and -PRON- glittering beadlike eye transfix the king 
and through all this archibald meig sleep placidly on 
presently a perfect roar of awe and dismay break from thousand of wordboxe 
in the midst of the hubbub the king could be see wave -PRON- hand to command silence and attention 
the glitter soldier in the turret sound a clarion warning and silence fall once more 
marvelous be the power of these colossi cry the king with trembling voice

the professor reply that -PRON- do mean -PRON- and go on to tell how the unexpected result have be accomplish 
before -PRON- have fairly finish the king clothe in -PRON- robe of state and accompany by a dozen member of -PRON- household could be see approach across the square 
attendant follow the royal party bearing basin of food a chair on which -PRON- majesty could repose -PRON- and a canopy to shield -PRON- august person from the reflect ray of the sun 
the first thing -PRON- do quinn say meig while the royal party be make -PRON- comfortable tell the king get to have -PRON- clothe

see that -PRON- be give -PRON- 
this command be very satisfactory to -PRON- for i be little short of famish 
presently -PRON- paddle be fly over the basin and -PRON- be break -PRON- fast in a way that make the king open -PRON- eye 
the lord of the exchequera most important officer of statedrew near -PRON- majesty and say that if the kingdom be go to board -PRON- for any length of time -PRON- would behoove -PRON- to till all the crown land and get every available acre into produce 
the king make answer that the little man with the beady eye be a wonderworker -PRON- have take care of the executionergeneral with a mere wave of the hand and no doubt -PRON- could with a stamp of the foot materialize as much food as -PRON- want and whenever -PRON- want 
the lord of the exchequer thereupon retire in much confusion 
in the midst of -PRON- repast -PRON- be startle by a voice behind -PRON-

-PRON- cheek be sink and pale while -PRON- eye be round and abnormally bright 
in -PRON- left hand be a metal plate and in -PRON- right a small paddle 
both meig and quinn start toward markham with the food that still remain in -PRON- basin 
the zetring however rear -PRON- intangible barrier between so that markham could not so much as touch the receptacle extend toward -PRON- 
-PRON- be pathetic to watch this onetime master of million struggle to get the coveted food 
-PRON- would throw -PRON- at -PRON- and recoil tremble from the mysterious force that have shock and baffle -PRON- -PRON- would sink to -PRON- knee or leap in the air try to reach above or below the invisible barrier and then -PRON- would dissemble slink toward the basin and make a sudden dash as though the strong chemical be an enemy whom -PRON- think -PRON- could take off -PRON- guard 
at last -PRON- give over and turn away with a despair moan 
meig face the king and begin an angry outburst which the professor make haste to interrupt 
-PRON- majesty say quinn this needy gentleman be also a friend of our 
will -PRON- not supply -PRON- want or enable -PRON- to do so 
the indexograph inform -PRON- as to -PRON- character answer the king and -PRON- be a law of the realm that punishment must fit the crime 
when -PRON- friend will truly acknowledge -PRON- in the wrong -PRON- need will be plentifully supply 
until that time -PRON- must beg -PRON- food from house to house morsel by morsel 
and this other gentleman in the kirtle proceed the professor will -PRON- not exercise a little clemency in -PRON- case have already exercise a good deal of clemency the king answer nor can i go any further until -PRON- also announce a change of heart 
markham be as deaf to the wordboxe as be meig and -PRON- majestys will be interpret to -PRON- be not in the wrong declare markham 
the principle involve be of vital importance and i will die for -PRON- if need be 
so will aver meigs 
-PRON- will eliminate -PRON- friend from -PRON- calculation for the present say the king 
just now i would like to know what have become of -PRON- executionergeneral 
-PRON- be pin to the roof of the underworld say the professor 
can -PRON- bring -PRON- back ask the king turn -PRON- eye aloft 
really i donot see how -PRON- be to get along without -PRON- 
possibly i can return -PRON- to -PRON- answer the professor will try at least provide -PRON- will grant a request i have to make 
this dallying with the royal prerogative be not well receive by -PRON- majesty nor by those around -PRON- 
what request would -PRON- make in case i be incline to receive -PRON- ask the king would have -PRON- bring out the bolla and allow these two gentleman to take -PRON- in -PRON- hand 
the king give a start and a look of consternation overspread the face of those in -PRON- retinue 
where do -PRON- hear of the bolla the king ask sharply 
in the other kingdom -PRON- majesty the professor reply 
the king be silent a few moment 
-PRON- will take that matter up later say -PRON- finally 
from whence come -PRON- and -PRON- friend 
that point have be bother -PRON- for some little time 
-PRON- come from another planet which be call the earth say quinn 
do the planet -PRON- speak of circle around -PRON- sun 
yes -PRON- majesty 
be -PRON- as large as njambai 
much large -PRON- majesty 
and be all the creature on earth twohande as large as -PRON- and able to communicate thought without a wordbox 
the inhabitant of earth be just as -PRON- see -PRON- 
but -PRON- do not live beneath the crust of the planet 
the sun ray be so temper by the time -PRON- reach the earth that being be able to live in comfort on the outer shell 
the king clap two of -PRON- hand at this and give other evidence of -PRON- pleasure on the wordbox 
most wonderful -PRON- exclaim and launch into a series of question concern the physical attribute of -PRON- mother planet and the character and institution of -PRON- people 
quinn answer -PRON- fully expatiate on the progress in art and science already make by the earth dweller 
the king wonder grow into awe and admiration 
rise from -PRON- chair -PRON- pace back and forth in front of -PRON- think deeply 
what sort of weapon have -PRON- people -PRON- inquire at last 
the professor describe -PRON- machine to the good of -PRON- ability 
the king be puzzle -PRON- know anything about zet on -PRON- native orb -PRON- inquire 
no answer the professor 
there be no zet in -PRON- atmosphere 
suppose a company of -PRON- soldier be to land on earth fully equip with zetbais 
could -PRON- be resist 
quinn shudder 
no -PRON- majesty -PRON- could not be resist 
with -PRON- wonderful zetbais -PRON- could conquer and lay waste the entire planet 
candor compel -PRON- to tell -PRON- this know full well that such a result would not be possible to -PRON- 
why impossible cry the king with wild enthusiasm 
-PRON- and -PRON- friend must have come hither in that strange house which fall into the crater 
why could i not load a company of -PRON- soldier into the house and go back with -PRON- 
then and only then do -PRON- see what this crackbrained monarch be drive at 
quinn be in trepidation over the outcome 
such a thing be not to be think of -PRON- cry 
-PRON- majesty let -PRON- beg -PRON- not to give -PRON- attention to such a quixotic project be fully resolve exclaim the king stride up and down with clinch hand 
-PRON- be a very alluring picture -PRON- give -PRON- of this planet call earth conquer -PRON- annex -PRON- and own -PRON- 
-PRON- halt and raise -PRON- wordbox 
ho there olox -PRON- cry 
the high chief step forward and make the royal salaam of four hand 
-PRON- be go forth to conquer the solar system olox pay the king in a brisk way 
yes -PRON- majesty answer olox as readily as though the capturing of a planet or two be an everyday occurrence 
-PRON- have overhear what this strange twohande creature have be tell -PRON- go on the king 
yes -PRON- majesty 
train that burn the black block and nee not be haul by hand 
green vegetation laugh river and babble brook all on the outer shell 
rich city store of art and heap of yellow gold 
these and myriad other marvelous thing be on the earth olox and guard only by twohande fivefingere colossi who have to load a tube of iron with black powder and round missile before -PRON- can attack -PRON- foe 
the king throw back -PRON- head and laugh on the wordbox 
take a cue from the king olox also laugh and so do the other 
and these earth dweller canot even see in the dark ripple the king with contemptuous finger 
but -PRON- be large -PRON- majesty venture the high chief 
large and therefore awkward not quick like -PRON- people olox 
the zetbai be the key to the situation 
-PRON- could girdle the green star of these colossi devastate -PRON- and destroy all who seek to oppose -PRON- 
that be what -PRON- shall do 
-PRON- will be a noble campaign -PRON- majesty 
noble 
that be not the word olox 
-PRON- will be stupendous monopolize everything when -PRON- get there -PRON- dear sireverything -PRON- can get -PRON- hand on 
and i guess -PRON- can get -PRON- hand on whatever there iszet will clear every obstacle out of -PRON- way 
the king look at the theoretical side 
olox naturally have an eye to the practical 
what be -PRON- order for the campaign -PRON- majesty -PRON- ask shall leave a regent to look after baigadd say the king and -PRON- accompany the expedition 
-PRON- will be the military head olox 
yes -PRON- majesty 
-PRON- be to go in the metal house 
-PRON- be the only thing -PRON- have to go in 
the metal house be unhurt by -PRON- fall into the crater 
that appear to be the case -PRON- majesty strange as -PRON- may seem 
-PRON- fall into the kingdom right side up and the interior be in good condition 
very good -PRON- majesty 
-PRON- order to the effect that nothing should be remove from -PRON- have be carry out 
the executionergeneral would have that tub of white pigment 
nothing else have be take from the house 
very good 
how many of -PRON- people will the house contain comfortably should say that fifty or more could dwell in -PRON- without much inconvenience 
then select fifty soldier the flower of the gaddbaizet 
among -PRON- store be sure -PRON- have a good supply of black kaka 
i want some one who be away up in ideograph to accompany the expedition as historian 
-PRON- will be attend to -PRON- highness 
the king turn and aim -PRON- wordbox at the professor 
be that tub of white pigment essential to the proper equipment of the metal house -PRON- ask 
very essential reply quinn 
three week and more in the neth kingdom have whiten -PRON- considerably but the professor face be now a sickly grayish color 
then i will have -PRON- take back to the house say the king 
-PRON- give order to that end at once and the cart be lay hold of and draw out of the square and down the street olox accompany -PRON- have no idea the king drum on -PRON- wordbox that there be any people in the solar system with so much wealth and so little power with which to guard -PRON- get the other three kingdom of njambai pretty well under -PRON- thumb and the regent i leave behind to boss thing will have an easy time of -PRON- 
quite possibly i may conclude not to come back to njambai 
this other star have natural advantage which -PRON- do not seem to have here and may prove a more comfortable place in which to live 
professor quinn be shiver like a man with an ague 
-PRON- proceed to use -PRON- talkmachine and the word shake under -PRON- unsteady finger 
what -PRON- be think of -PRON- majesty run the professor word be only the wild of dream have have dream before and wild one the king wordbox rattle off complacently and i have make -PRON- come true 
-PRON- shall be the same with this 
i be a conqueror and i come of a line of conqueror 
there be million upon million of people on -PRON- planet persist the professor despairingly 
-PRON- could hurl these countless number against -PRON- faster than -PRON- could slay -PRON- with -PRON- zetbais 
key of the royal wordbox give a screech of contempt 
suppose -PRON- draw a line of zet the box add when the derision have die out imprison group of those countless number and then wipe -PRON- out by detachment 
how would that work 
the atmosphere of earth be different from that of mercury continue the professor 
-PRON- can not draw zet from the air of -PRON- planet 
thank for the hint reply the king 
-PRON- will take an ample supply with -PRON- and charge the atmosphere with -PRON- 
then -PRON- shall have a store at hand whenever the need develop 
while the king be use -PRON- wordbox with two of -PRON- hand -PRON- be rub the other two together with illconceale delight 
condition there be absolutely unknown to -PRON- -PRON- majesty persist the professor in a frantic endeavor to turn the king from -PRON- design 
-PRON- will be bring face to face at every turn with situation that will puzzle -PRON- and be fraught with danger 
all the nation of the earth will combine against -PRON- 
let -PRON- combine be the monarchs answer hope -PRON- will display sufficient strength to make the campaign exciting 
i will capture this earth of -PRON- and rule over -PRON- 
from one end of -PRON- to the other i will make -PRON- -PRON- 
i have long feel that njambai be too small for the proper exercise of -PRON- wide ability 
this be -PRON- world the professor thump angrily on -PRON- wordbox and -PRON- have no right to meddle with any other planet 
that cause the king to turn -PRON- keen eye on the professor and to keep -PRON- there for a full minute have the right to do whatever i see fit snap -PRON- talk machine 
there be no will in this kingdom but mine and no other will in the four kingdom if i choose to have -PRON- so 
but why be -PRON- say such thing on -PRON- wordbox 
after fire -PRON- with a kingly ambition to capture and annex a distant planet why do -PRON- proceed to throw discouragement in -PRON- way 
ha 
i wonder if -PRON- have be tell -PRON- the truth 
-PRON- majesty hum the professor talk machine with dignity be not in the habit of make misstatement find out whether -PRON- be or not come from the king 
this be an important matter and i shall take no man word for anything 
ho there and the wordbox be level at some of the retainer bring an indexograph varlet 
-PRON- will settle this question of veracity here and now 
some of the retainer scurry away and vanish inside the palace 
presently -PRON- reappear with the indexograph 
the professor be backward in face the teststrangely backward as i think for a man so clearminded and conscientious 
the test be not necessary -PRON- demur 
-PRON- action be far from be open and aboveboard remark the king 
-PRON- must submit 
the royal eye be on the machine as the professor be try out 
the ideograph tell of a truthful mind sadly perturb 
the royal wordbox chatter mirthfully 
-PRON- be afraid i can accomplish -PRON- purpose laugh -PRON- majesty 
-PRON- be worried about -PRON- planet 
such a state of mind merely enhance -PRON- determination for -PRON- if i mistake not be a clever man 
-PRON- would not feel worried if -PRON- do not believe i could accomplish what i have in mind 
but be at peace -PRON- dear sir 
-PRON- shall in nowise suffer 
i will make -PRON- ruler of one of the capture kingdom 
this be no lure for the professor 
-PRON- maintain an attitude of dignified silence watch the king with steady eye wise general go on -PRON- majesty always look over -PRON- ground as well as -PRON- may before go out to battle 
that will be advisable in the case of -PRON- present campaign 
what do -PRON- mean by that -PRON- majesty query the professor explain the king again -PRON- shall mount to the upper crust and make a reconnoissance of this orb i be to subjugate 
have -PRON- any astronomical instrument ask quinn 
none whatever reply the king 
have -PRON- 
there be an instrument in the steel car which will bring the planet terra much nearer to -PRON- than the naked eye could do 
what be -PRON- 
describe the instrument to -PRON- and i will have -PRON- bring out for -PRON- night work 
the professor describe the telescope and the king dispatch a messenger after olox in hot haste with supplementary order 
thereupon the king bid -PRON- farewell and leave the square follow by -PRON- suite 
as i stand watch the royal party out of sight i hear a gurgle groan behind -PRON- 
face about i see the professor reel unsteadily the next moment i have catch -PRON- in -PRON- arm and save -PRON- a fall 
a professor quinn do not become unconscious 
the frightful catastrophe that threaten terra have prey upon -PRON- at the expense of -PRON- strength 
ease -PRON- to the ground i drop beside -PRON- and hold -PRON- head on -PRON- knee 
cheer up professor say -PRON- surprise -PRON- to see -PRON- give way like this 
mr munn -PRON- return brokenly if this rattlebrained monarch go out into the universe with a pick company of fifty man and a hundred zetbais -PRON- will mean that the whole solar system will get a setback to a period correspond with -PRON- middle age 
these creature of njambai be far beneath those of terra in civilization and fate have place in -PRON- hand the terrible zetbai a weapon whose destructive power be beyond compute 
oh mr munn think of -PRON- government be overwhelm by these fourhande oneeyed creature 
think of the wordbox screech through the lofty corridor of the capitol at washington where the soulstirre eloquence of senator and representative have be thunder amain 
think of the the professor could give no add touch to the harrowing picture 
throw -PRON- hand to -PRON- face -PRON- groan aloud 
this hasnot happen yet say no but -PRON- will happen unless -PRON- can do something to circumvent the mad scheme 
anarchy will reign in -PRON- beloved landover the whole earthand i will be hold responsible 
ah -PRON- 
in remove the trust magnate i have but pave the way for a mightier monopolist 
i have but follow the sad example of frankenstein for out of -PRON- plan have spring a monstrous project that will check progress and hurl civilization back five hundred year give up hope say but not very cheerfully for i be greatly cast down 
let -PRON- pretend to help -PRON- 
-PRON- will lend -PRON- aid in make the car ready and then at the final moment perhaps -PRON- can dart away and leave -PRON- behind or fail in that -PRON- may be able to throw the zetbais from the car while in space 
that will pull the fang of the baigadd i think and -PRON- will land on earth as harmless as a lot of kitten 
the professor take heart at this 
-PRON- would have rally any way for -PRON- resourceful nature could not struggle long in the slough of despond 
archibald meig have be circle around the edge of -PRON- barrier seek for another glimpse of markham and even call -PRON- name with all -PRON- lung power 
but the foodtrust magnate neither answer nor show -PRON- be engage in a canvass for the pittance of provender that would keep -PRON- alive 
meig finally turn to -PRON- and demand the cause of the professor downcast air 
quinn reveal the king plot and meig tear off into an outburst of recrimination just as i expect -PRON- would do 
the professor bow -PRON- head meekly to the temp and even restrain -PRON- when i would have put a stop to the broker intemperate language 
by and by -PRON- have -PRON- noon meal and with the attendant who bring -PRON- come olox seat -PRON- on the ground and watch -PRON- as -PRON- eat 
the high chief be quite amiable and i begin ask -PRON- question relative to -PRON- surrounding 
-PRON- indicate the king private apartment in the palace and point out -PRON- own residence as well as the dwelling occupy by the late executionergeneral besides vouchsafe other information of interest 
what be that small square building under the wing of the palace 
i ask 
that be the imperial exchequer say -PRON- 
within that build the king keep the most priceless of all -PRON- treasure 
and what be that inquire the professor 
the bolla be the startling answer 
quinn and i exchange expressive glance 
here through a chance remark by olox -PRON- be suddenly remind of -PRON- duty to the king of baigol 
-PRON- be necessary that olox should not see the startled look which the professor and i be exchange and mercurial eye be preternaturally sharp 
bolla 
i allow to come limpingly from the talk instrument 
what may that be stone answer olox and there be suspicion in -PRON- manner in spite of -PRON- attempt to avert -PRON- 
-PRON- already know of the bolla 
-PRON- friend request -PRON- majesty to have -PRON- bring out and at that time -PRON- say that -PRON- have hear of -PRON- in the other kingdom 
so -PRON- do i reply trim -PRON- sail to another breeze but what be -PRON- 
-PRON- information be rather vague stone as i just say go on olox 
-PRON- have a beneficial moral and physical effect on whoever touch -PRON- 
where do -PRON- come from 
-PRON- have be in njambai for age be the indefinite answer 
how do king gaddbai get hold of -PRON- 
-PRON- borrow -PRON- from the king of baigol 
and yet -PRON- call -PRON- one of -PRON- treasure 
if -PRON- be borrow olox how could -PRON- possibly belong here 
king gaddbai have take -PRON- be the calm response 
what -PRON- want -PRON- make -PRON- own 
if king golbai have not loan the stone there would have be a war 
be that the right thing for -PRON- king to do inquire the professor 
whatever -PRON- sovereign do be right 
there be no get around a flat statement of that sort 
evidently the ruler of the country have drill -PRON- subject thoroughly 
what do -PRON- do at the car olox say the professor 
at the iron house 
the professor nod 
nod and gesture be well understand by the people of njambai for with four hand -PRON- be well equipped for finger and whole arm movement 
the king order be carry out at the iron house finish olox 
the paint be return to -PRON- proper place 
even so 
and the telescope that matter be attend to trust -PRON- handle the telescope with care 
-PRON- be exceedingly fragile and could be easily injure 
after the king speak as -PRON- do death by zet would be mete out to the one who injure the instrument 
there be several thing i want to ask olox and the principal one have to do with gilhooly and the way -PRON- have be take from the car and make to serve the traction interest of the kingdom 
however the professor be keep olox so busy with -PRON- wordbox that -PRON- own question be crowd out 
the family of the executionergeneral be anxious to have -PRON- return remark olox while the professor be look for the proper key on which to formulate -PRON- next question 
could that be accomplish 
-PRON- may reply the professor guardedly 
what have become of -PRON- 
-PRON- disappear as -PRON- be about to commit a deed of base injustice say the professor grimly 
-PRON- be aware of that and olox look uneasily around as -PRON- punch the word but -PRON- be ignorant of the cause of -PRON- disappearance 
-PRON- be a distant relative of mine and i promise -PRON- next of kin to put these question to -PRON- 
be -PRON- alive 
undoubtedly 
olox press closer and muffle -PRON- wordbox so that the sound could not carry to dangerous limit 
if -PRON- would tell -PRON- how to proceed in the matter of get the executionergeneral back -PRON- whisper can promise -PRON- and -PRON- friend help in get out of the country 
look out for the indexograph olox say if -PRON- should happen to give -PRON- a try out with -PRON- the ideograph wouldnot look well to the king 
olox be greatly shakenso shake in fact that -PRON- could not pursue the subject further will talk with -PRON- later about the executionergeneral -PRON- finish note the empty dish before the professor and meig and -PRON- and the curious manner of those who have come with -PRON- 
until then pray consider that nothing have be say on the subject 
with that -PRON- arise and beckon to -PRON- companion 
after olox have lead the attendant away with the empty food receptacle the professor and i get -PRON- head together on the mission that have bring -PRON- to baigadd 
-PRON- do not think -PRON- necessary or advisable to let meig know of -PRON- purpose in regain control of the bolla 
-PRON- be pledge to secure the mysterious stone if -PRON- can mr munn say quinn 
undoubtedly the work will put -PRON- in bad odor here and may interfere with -PRON- attempt to balk the king in -PRON- comprehensive scheme of conquest but that do not release -PRON- from the task in question 
a tingle of gratification shoot along -PRON- nerve 
the feeling of oppression that have burden -PRON- be lift for i ever love to crack a professional nut and here be one that would certainly try -PRON- to the utmost 
i survey the small building with critical eye 
here be where -PRON- inch get the well of -PRON- professor say for one of -PRON- size to get into that house be out of the question 
and i wouldnot know where to lay hand on the bolla if -PRON- be physically possible for -PRON- to effect an entrance can make a suggestion mr munn say quinn which would get -PRON- safely around that difficulty 
what be that 
whisper 
i incline -PRON- ear to -PRON- lip 
why not run away with the imperial exchequer 
eh 
i gasp 
steal -PRON- bodily i mean 
when -PRON- get to baigol with -PRON- let the king effect entrance secure -PRON- bolla and then -PRON- return the exchequer to -PRON- original location 
of course -PRON- would be very wrong to steal the king treasury and i would not counsel that under any consideration 
-PRON- merely borrow -PRON- to obtain the bolla the stone return to -PRON- rightful owner -PRON- return the exchequer 
and get zetbaie for -PRON- pain 
i exclaim 
let -PRON- hope say the professor that before -PRON- can get zetbaie -PRON- shall be in a position to use the car and escape from the planet 
i give much thought to the matter 
-PRON- be a long chance i return frankly but i have be take long chance ever since i become a cracksman 
i will put the plan in operation professor at the very first opportunity that present -PRON- 
thus -PRON- leave the matter the professor warmly congratulate -PRON- on -PRON- courage and express the hope that i would prove equally courageous in more worthy pursuit if the chance ever offer 
day slip along to -PRON- close and shortly after the reflector wink out the king come accompany by olox a guard of gaddbaizet and six attendant bear the telescope 
to -PRON- surprise and gratification both markham and popham be in the midst of the royal guard 
-PRON- strike -PRON- say the king graciously that -PRON- friend may also wish to view the orb from which -PRON- come 
-PRON- be a little thing and can be do without inconvenience so i be pleased to favor -PRON- 
the high chief trace an opening in the zet ring with the black tip of -PRON- weapon and meig be first to rush through and hurl -PRON- into the arm of popham 
the unfortunate gentleman be long in each other embrace 
when -PRON- finally draw apart meig grope through the black gloom by markham while the professor feel for the coal baron hand and give -PRON- a gentle and reassuring pressure 
professor quinn say popham be be badly treat 
the king have put -PRON- on the night shift in one of the royal coal mine and the soldier make -PRON- work like a galley slave 
this be the first night i have have off since -PRON- set -PRON- to work 
popham be loud in -PRON- complaining but be cut short by the king 
-PRON- must proceed gentleman 
i have word from above that the night be fine and everything propitious for an excellent view of -PRON- planet but storm come suddenly and -PRON- can never be sure of the weather on the outer crust 
-PRON- be well to make haste 
-PRON- start stumblingly each of -PRON- lead by a soldier to whom the way be plain 
-PRON- be jostle here and there through the gloom and finally be make to mount some object which give a metallic ring beneath -PRON- foot 
this be the royal lift explain the king 
when the heat of the day be suspend i often go above 
-PRON- then address -PRON- to olox 
give the signal at once 
the signal be give and -PRON- shoot aloft 
the transformation from the fury of a storm to the light and tranquillity of the underworld have be great and astounding but this second transformation be none the less impressive 
-PRON- emerge into a wonderful night set with star that be perfectly familiar to -PRON- 
the dipper and polaris be in the north and occupy relatively the same position that -PRON- do when view from little effect have the immensity of distance upon -PRON- post in the vault 
but -PRON- own globe 
-PRON- hang huge and tremulous in the blue of the evening sky so plain that -PRON- could almost note the continent that gem -PRON- surface 
meig give a whimper cry and -PRON- and markham and popham rush together fall upon each other neck and weep aloud 
oh i wish i be back i wish i be back moan the broker lonesome enough to die sobbed markham 
exile exile exile be all the coal baron could murmur in husky tone 
i will not say that i be proof against the sentiment that have unman the onetime magnate but i will declare that both quinn and -PRON- have -PRON- feeling under well control 
in silence i assist the professor to plant the telescope and -PRON- each gaze longingly at the greenish star magnify to many time -PRON- diameter the united state cry popham 
can -PRON- see new york whisper meig hoarsely 
look for new york man 
of course a view of new york be out of the question but the frantic explutocrat imagine -PRON- could see -PRON- and even look down into wall street for aught i know 
again be -PRON- emotion too much for -PRON- and -PRON- give way as -PRON- have do before 
mr munn say the professor this be harrow 
-PRON- be pretty hard on those gentleman i return to be bring face to face with something -PRON- think -PRON- own and yet not be able to possess -PRON- 
that remark be unlike -PRON- answer the professor and turn to the king think occur to -PRON- while -PRON- be come up on the lift -PRON- go on and i should like -PRON- to explain 
if -PRON- be in -PRON- power answer the king -PRON- eye to the telescope 
when -PRON- drop into the kingdom of baigol there be a storm on the surface of this planet 
that storm must have hide the sun and yet the reflector below be send day throughout the realm 
the reflection come from other and small reflector arrange to take care of just such an emergency explain the king 
storm be only local -PRON- know and when one gather over the giant reflector the small one at the other point be bring into use 
but let not talk of this planet but of that other one up here 
and along that line the king conversation run for a full hour 
at last when -PRON- be ready to descend so far from be dismay by the enormity of the task before -PRON- the royal zealot be fortify in -PRON- resolution to carry -PRON- out 
-PRON- majesty be in great good humor and when -PRON- have leave the lift and march back to the square -PRON- very graciously tender -PRON- the freedom of the town 
-PRON- could not understand why the professor and i should have any desire to escape from -PRON- country and inasmuch as -PRON- have make -PRON- -PRON- honor guest to return -PRON- to the circle of zet would be to besmirch -PRON- hospitality 
the zet have be regathere into the high chief zetbai and -PRON- be not again release 
-PRON- be not necessary for popham to return to the royal mine until the following night so -PRON- remain with -PRON- along with markham and -PRON- all bunk down in the centre of the plaza 
be there no way professor quinn quaver popham whereby -PRON- can escape from the inhuman monster who people this planet 
the treatment i have suffer be monstrous 
i feel as though i shall die if i have to go back to those royal coal mine again 
be a large man -PRON- expect -PRON- to do the work of a dozen mercurial 
there be blister on -PRON- hand and -PRON- foot be so sore i can hardly walk 
this wail from the brusque and tyrannical popham be in -PRON- a highly edifying comment on -PRON- sad experience 
-PRON- position be grace -PRON- compare with mine mourn markham 
these people seem determined to starve -PRON- to death 
i be expect to travel from house to house beg food and -PRON- hardly give -PRON- enough at one house to take -PRON- to the next 
-PRON- be on the surface return popham and -PRON- be not delve continually in the hot unhealthy region where i must do -PRON- work 
i have to toil like a galley slave for a cent a day and a cent worth of this vegetable food which seem to be all -PRON- have here do not furnish -PRON- with enough strength for -PRON- labor 
-PRON- have -PRON- clothe at least whimper meigs 
quinn ought to help -PRON- -PRON- must help -PRON- shall do what i can gentleman say the professor wearily have not succeed in show -PRON- the error of -PRON- way but i must let that pass 
a great calamity menace -PRON- planet than any -PRON- could possibly let loose upon -PRON- devoted country 
meig be say something about that speak up popham 
what be -PRON- this mad king think of do 
why with fifty warrior arm with zetbais -PRON- intend make an attack upon terra 
-PRON- hope to conquer -PRON- mother orb 
popham give a faint cry of derision 
why if that rascal ever land on -PRON- planet say -PRON- -PRON- and -PRON- warrior would be capture out of hand and turn over to some museum for exhibition purpose 
if happen to be around at the time of -PRON- capture -PRON- finish angrily would send every last one of -PRON- into mine that be mine make -PRON- toil with -PRON- four hand until -PRON- wear -PRON- off at the wrist 
gad but that would be a revenge worth have 
this be not a time to think of revenge mr popham speak up the professor more in sorrow than rebuke 
-PRON- have -PRON- planet to consider and next to the planet -PRON- 
-PRON- planet be big enough to take care of -PRON- aver markham 
leave that out of the question professor and confine -PRON- attention to some way in which -PRON- can better -PRON- condition 
the danger that threaten earth be great than -PRON- appear to imagine go on quinn 
for whatever happen to -PRON- homestar because of king gaddbai and -PRON- astounding plan of conquest i should be responsible 
the thought weigh upon -PRON- and will give -PRON- no rest 
the king must be foiled 
how do -PRON- intend to reach the earth ask markham 
by mean of -PRON- car 
be that in usable condition come joyously from popham 
so far as i can discover -PRON- lie intact at the bottom of the crater on whose rim -PRON- land 
there be no reason why the car can not be employ for a return to terra but and here the professor word become emphatic -PRON- shall not be so employ by king gaddbai and -PRON- army of conquest 
i shall prevent that at all hazard 
how come hoarsely from the three exmillionaire 
by destroy the car as a last resort and when other mean fail be the calm rejoinder 
-PRON- would not dare breathed popham 
-PRON- would not have the heart to take from -PRON- -PRON- sole mean of escape add markham 
madman grind out meigs 
if i really think that -PRON- would destroy -PRON- only mean of salvation -PRON- wouldnot do a thing meig i chime in 
whatever the professor think best to do be go to be do and no two way about -PRON- donot want to destroy the car continue the professor unmove by this storm -PRON- have arouse if other mean can be make to serve 
and i may say that -PRON- shall exhaust every effort to make other mean serve 
i feel that -PRON- be -PRON- duty to return -PRON- gentleman to the place from whence -PRON- be take 
i have not accomplish what i have hope to do but -PRON- be well to be disappoint in that rather than to let king gaddbai get away in the car with -PRON- fifty warrior 
certainly -PRON- be -PRON- duty to send -PRON- back say meig and -PRON- should consider that duty before anything and everything else 
exactly second popham and -PRON- must take gilhooly with -PRON- 
if one go all must go 
leave the matter to -PRON- gentleman counsel the professor quietly shall do everything possible 
the coal baron and the foodtrust magnate continue to dwell upon -PRON- harrowing experience with various degree of intensity until a command for silence come from a wordbox somewhere around -PRON- 
-PRON- raucous tone be keep the people awake all over the city the talk machine aver and unless -PRON- become instantly quiet the authority would take the matter in hand 
this threat have the desire result 
-PRON- give over -PRON- conversation and settle -PRON- for the night 
i do not know how long i sleep but -PRON- must have be some hour 
i be arouse to find -PRON- still dark and to behold the professor with a light match in one hand and -PRON- other hand over -PRON- lip 
the burn match throw a fitful glare around the open space and even reach to the roof top beyond 
both the palace and the imperial exchequer be bring shadowily forth out of the gloom 
now be the time mr munn whisper the professor 
the time 
i return sotto voce 
time for what 
without a word -PRON- point to the square building under the wing of the palace 
i understand 
-PRON- be now or never if i intend to make -PRON- raid and secure the bolla 
i start erect 
-PRON- have match mr munn the professor ask in the very faint of audible tone 
i nod 
-PRON- must be very careful to keep to the street until -PRON- reach the country the professor go on 
if -PRON- should make a misstep and wreck a block of house the disaster would be irretrievable will strike match and light -PRON- way until i get well into the hill say just what i should have suggest say -PRON- 
mr munn 
fail not to return with the exchequer as soon as the king of baigol have secure the bolla 
meantime i shall hope to get the car in readiness to speed -PRON- departure 
-PRON- strike hand as man will when confront by an issue of life and death 
then i step into the street bend over the imperial exchequer and wrench -PRON- from -PRON- foundation 
-PRON- be a wellconstructed building and although -PRON- content jingle like a rattle box when i take -PRON- under -PRON- arm -PRON- do not give way in any part 
strike a match on the roof of the exchequer i light -PRON- way down the street pick -PRON- step with care and caution 
good fortune fare forth with -PRON- from the royal city and remain steadfastly at -PRON- right hand as long as the match last but when the last one have flicker out and leave -PRON- in impenetrable gloom -PRON- trouble begin 
i be well into the rough country when the light fail thread a road border by hill that in some place be should high 
about the first thing i do be to blunder off the trail in try to regain -PRON- i stumble over a fivefoot mountain and go down all of a heap 
have i fall on the exchequer i should have smash -PRON- into a cocked hata result only narrowly avert 
regain -PRON- foot and smother some good strong language that rise instinctively to -PRON- lip i essay once more to find the baigol road 
i have -PRON- trouble for -PRON- pain and after an hour spend in fruitless blundering i sit down on a cliff prop up the exchequer on the side of a caon and nurse -PRON- barked shin until day begin flash from the reflector 
as i sit there wait for the light -PRON- brain be fill with evil thought which i recall with contrition and chronicle with regret 
i know the exchequer must contain the king wealthgolden piece of eight of a rare fineness unknown to the mint of terra 
i be not of a mind to return the gold after allow the king of baigol to take -PRON- bolla 
why not stow the treasure away about -PRON- clothe and rely upon -PRON- native tact and discretion to get -PRON- to the steel car in spite of the grasp monarch of baigadd 
i be much work up over the way i have lose the loot take from the plutocrat 
in -PRON- mind eye i could see those four bulge handkerchief wax and wane about the castle and i have hope -PRON- would fall to the surface of mercury along with the car so that i may still be able to secure -PRON- 
in this i be disappoint 
once the mercurial atmosphere be strike the loot and the revolver have fall away from the castle like so many piece of lead 
the wallet undoubtedly have be incinerate by the sun ray together with the banknote that be in -PRON- 
i imagine that the intense heat have explode the cartridge in the sixshooter and have warp and twist the firearm until -PRON- be no longer serviceable 
the other plunder also even if find could not by any possibility be utilize by -PRON- or any one else 
all this have make -PRON- savagely eager to recoup -PRON- finance 
and as i sit brood on the cliff i ask -PRON- why i should not do this at the expense of the baigadd exchequer 
i do not arouse -PRON- at the first reflect flash of day 
although i have decide to appropriate the content of coffer i be cast about for a suitable method that would gain -PRON- end with the least inconvenience 
a maudlin chuckle from near at hand bring -PRON- abruptly out of -PRON- reflection 
i turn and there on a neighboring elevation stand gilhooly balance the exchequer on the broad of -PRON- hand 
i be bring up staring 
what could the motive power of the interplanetary be do there at that time 
-PRON- absence must have interfere sadly with the train schedule 
certainly the officer of the system would not have countenance this neglect of duty have -PRON- know of -PRON- 
then -PRON- flash over -PRON- that gilhooly have run away 
-PRON- have tired of race up and down the groove with a string of toy car and have take french leave of the system 
the fire of insanity be still in -PRON- eye and -PRON- retreat step by step as i advance upon -PRON- 
look here gilhooly say i in -PRON- most persuasive tone that build -PRON- have in -PRON- hand be the imperial exchequer 
put -PRON- down there s a good fellow juggle with -PRON- in that way 
suppose -PRON- be to drop -PRON- 
gilhooly have begin shake -PRON- up and down as though -PRON- be one of those castiron bank in which child sometimes deposit -PRON- copper the jingle of the exchequer content appear to please -PRON- 
if -PRON- want this road -PRON- have get to bid up for -PRON- say -PRON- not so young that i donot know a good thing when get -PRON- in -PRON- grip 
that road have go into the hand of a receiver i return humor -PRON- fancy and the receiver 
give -PRON- here gilhooly be not consult when the receiver be appoint -PRON- answer have right in the matter and those right must be protect a deal frame up to beat the pool 
-PRON- how -PRON- rattle and -PRON- shake the exchequer again 
i be at -PRON- wit end 
i know that tact be far and away more effective than violence when deal with a craze person 
put -PRON- down for a moment gilhooly i wheedle and come over to the director meet 
who be the director -PRON- ask suspiciously 
well there be only two one -PRON- know and -PRON- be the other 
-PRON- explode a laugh toss the exchequer in the air like a strong man play with a cannon ball and then catch -PRON- deftly as -PRON- come down the boy to juggle with railroad -PRON- boast 
ask any one in the street and -PRON- will tell -PRON- 
look out 
i gasp or -PRON- will drop -PRON- 
not -PRON- mumble never yet wreck a railroad 
where do -PRON- come from gilhooly 
i ask seek to get -PRON- into conversation while i edge closer to -PRON- by degree 
from distant part -PRON- reply be the whole thing for a big transcontinental line that add to the gilhooly system 
-PRON- chuckle craftily 
-PRON- think -PRON- have -PRON- but i get out from under with the rolling stock hide the car in a gully and -PRON- next move will be to steal the right of way the big railroad man of the country 
just ask anybody who know what s what in transportation circle and -PRON- will tell -PRON- the same thing 
i have arrive within a few foot of -PRON- and suddenly i leap forward 
but -PRON- be wary and spring aside the exchequer jingle sharply 
no -PRON- donot say -PRON- try to serve a subpoena on -PRON- and too foxy for -PRON- 
get out of here or have -PRON- throw downstairs 
come over to the director meeting gilhooly i urge turn and walk away from -PRON- get to look after -PRON- interest -PRON- know 
but the vagary of a shatter mind be hard to deal with 
gilhooly laugh at -PRON- sit down on a rock and take the exchequer on -PRON- knee 
-PRON- be wary and never for an instant permit -PRON- to lose -PRON- eye 
-PRON- canot fool -PRON- -PRON- cry so -PRON- would better take the next train for home 
i hold a majority of the stock and after water -PRON- a little have enough to buy another line easy be a railroad magnate when -PRON- know how 
clear out -PRON- annoy -PRON- 
gilhooly say with a gentleness i be far from feel -PRON- want to know something about popham know -PRON- snarl gilhooly but if -PRON- s try to break into this railroad game just tell -PRON- that i control the whole bag of trick and that -PRON- not worth -PRON- while 
hug the exchequer in -PRON- arm -PRON- rock back and forth and begin to sing 
well say start away again if -PRON- donot want to attend this director meeting have to look after -PRON- -PRON- 
-PRON- make no reply but keep on hug the exchequer rock back and forth and time -PRON- monotonous croon to the rattle of treasure in the king strong room 
warily as i could i circle about creep on all four and screen -PRON- by the little hill and ridge 
-PRON- design be to come up on gilhooly from behind and snatch the exchequer away from -PRON- 
but -PRON- hear -PRON- 
before i have come within a dozen foot of -PRON- -PRON- stop -PRON- singing leap to -PRON- foot and whirl around 
the next moment -PRON- have place -PRON- at a safe distance too many for -PRON- -PRON- shout 
go away or call the police 
i be in a sweat for fear some of king soldier would locate -PRON- and develop -PRON- zetbais 
one flash of that violet fire would do the business for both gilhooly and -PRON- and the professor cherish plan would go by the board 
besides i have plan of -PRON- own and -PRON- seem as though gilhooly be destine to make a mess of everything 
oh come now i cry in a bit of a temper 
that wonot do -PRON- any good gilhooly 
-PRON- doesnot belong to -PRON- and -PRON- havenot any right to keep -PRON- -PRON- ever keep anything that donot belong to -PRON- -PRON- ask sarcastically not that sort of a fellow for i keep everything in the railroad line that i can get -PRON- hand on 
logic and reason be utterly dead in -PRON- mind 
whim -PRON- have but -PRON- be but fancy of the moment 
as i stand there look at -PRON- i wonder how the people of baigadd have ever manage to keep -PRON- haul -PRON- train as long as -PRON- have -PRON- call suddenly take the exchequer under -PRON- arm think go to the office and just then i make a dash at -PRON- 
with a mocking laugh -PRON- whirl about and race off across the hill -PRON- in hot pursuit course intersect the baigol highway and -PRON- turn into -PRON- roar defiantly as -PRON- speed along 
suddenly -PRON- stumble and fall and a cry of dismay escape -PRON- 
-PRON- have fall squarely on the exchequer and wreck -PRON- completely coin the size of a gold dollar and worth five time as muchrolle everywhere about the road diverge from a heap that lie reveal by the collapse wall of the building 
fling forward i go to -PRON- knee and begin plunge -PRON- hand into the pile 
i believe that just then i be as daft as gilhooly -PRON- 
in those day the glimmer of gold always have a demoralizing effect on -PRON- 
as i rake -PRON- outspread finger through the yellow pile i bring up a round jetblack stone the size of -PRON- fist 
i regard -PRON- as a bit of chaff in the bin of wealth and hurl -PRON- from -PRON- down the road 
with a loud yell gilhooly leap after -PRON- 
then i become aware of a weird and inexplicable feeling that lay -PRON- like an axe at the root of -PRON- professional instinct 
what right have i to all this treasure 
-PRON- belong to the king of baigall -PRON- be an unworthy creature perhaps but still -PRON- belong to -PRON- 
what have i be about to do 
-PRON- heart sicken and i spring up spurn the kyzick with -PRON- heel and turn -PRON- back 
that be -PRON- awakening 
in one instant the iron of repentance have pierce -PRON- soul 
the past roll -PRON- turgid water in front of -PRON- 
i shiver and draw back from that wave of evil cover -PRON- eye to blot -PRON- from -PRON- sight 
how should i atone for the day that have be 
could i do -PRON- by an unflinching rectitude in the day there be to be 
conscience be belabor -PRON- with tell blow 
i have not be on intimate term with -PRON- conscience for many year and to have -PRON- thus suddenly overmaster -PRON- and drive -PRON- into reformation be a mystery beyond -PRON- power to explain 
while i stand there consume with regret and hope against hope for the future a voice hail -PRON- from down the road 
do -PRON- say -PRON- name be munn 
could that calm contain voice have come from emmet gilhooly 
i look in -PRON- direction and find -PRON- lean against a jut spur of rock -PRON- right hand clutch convulsively the black stone i have fling from -PRON- 
the craze light have vanish from -PRON- eye 
an expression of wonder be on -PRON- face but -PRON- be a rational wonder develop by an awakening as abrupt and complete as -PRON- have be 
-PRON- have -PRON- right mr gilhooly i answer the extreme mildness of -PRON- voice surprise -PRON- 
-PRON- full name be jam peter munn and -PRON- be the thief who just come into the castle and relieve -PRON- and -PRON- friend of -PRON- valuable normal condition have come back to -PRON- at the point where -PRON- have be drop 
i be not slow in reason how this may be be a thief in the letter and spirit less than ten minute back i humbly answer but now sir i have turn a leaf 
i promise -PRON- that the rest of the book shall read better than what have go before 
gilhooly pass -PRON- left hand across -PRON- forehead be -PRON- falter 
in the kingdom of baigadd i return some distance out of the royal city 
baigadd 
royal city 
-PRON- talk strangely mr munn 
where be the castle 
where be meig markham and popham 
and professor quinn 
be start forward and look wildly in the castle 
but no that canot be 
-PRON- just say -PRON- be somewhere else 
i beg -PRON- pardon mr munn 
i be confused and hardly know what i be say 
i begin an explanation go patiently into every detail and when i finally finish gilhooly know as much about -PRON- situation as i do 
for some time gilhooly walk up and down the road pass and repasse the heap of gold 
at last -PRON- pause beside -PRON- 
-PRON- should return this treasure to -PRON- owner mr munn say -PRON- and -PRON- drop the black stone on the yellow pile 
from what -PRON- tell -PRON- this be a strange planet and strangely people 
yet there be superstition here as well as in -PRON- native orbas these wonder tale about the bolla will bear evidence think with -PRON- sir say the bolla be simply a fetish and -PRON- miraculous power be purely imaginary 
that be the sensible way to look at -PRON- 
suppose -PRON- load -PRON- pocket with the gold and start back with -PRON- to the city from whence -PRON- be take 
i assent and suggest use -PRON- coat as improvise bag for the easy transportation of the king wealth and -PRON- strip to -PRON- shirt sleeve and set about -PRON- work 
in half an hour -PRON- have collect all the scatter treasure have bind -PRON- up in -PRON- coat and have start back 
gilhooly preserve a pensive silence 
-PRON- thought be far away and -PRON- seem entirely oblivious of the fact that i be trudge along at -PRON- side 
-PRON- be only when -PRON- turn an angle in the road and come face to face with quinn meig markham and popham that gilhooly show any interest in -PRON- present situation 
the meeting between gilhooly and -PRON- brother exile be most affect 
in the general joy at find the exrailway magnate restore to reason the matter of the imperial exchequer be temporarily lose sight of 
and i think the man who rejoice most over return sanity be quinn 
the professor beady little eye be fairly glow as -PRON- catch and clung to hand after the other have express -PRON- pleasure and tender congratulation 
this be a glad day for -PRON- mr gilhooly exclaim the professor have take -PRON- very much to task on account of -PRON- clouded mind 
-PRON- reproach of -PRON- be well merit speak up meig who always have a venomous shaft in -PRON- quiver for quinn 
small thank to -PRON- that -PRON- friend be -PRON- again 
gently mr meigs gently come from gilhooly do not find professor quinn in the wrong in any particular 
popham meig and markham regard gilhooly with openmouthed amaze 
i think the professor also be startle i know at least that i be 
do -PRON- mean to say mr gilhooly cry meig that -PRON- can overlook criminal folly in cast -PRON- adrift in the unknown can not only overlook -PRON- be the quiet response but i can forgive -PRON- 
almost i be of the opinion that -PRON- be justifiable 
faugh rasp meigs 
-PRON- have not recover -PRON- reason after all or -PRON- would not talk that way 
let -PRON- not engage in useless dispute gentleman put in the professor 
there be another affair to engage -PRON- 
-PRON- be think quinn go on with an expressive look at -PRON- that mr gilhooly have flee the realm and take the imperial exchequer with -PRON- 
-PRON- be i who take the exchequer say and -PRON- be i who hope to return -PRON- to the king 
what about the bolla query quinn give -PRON- a sharp look 
-PRON- be here say touch the makeshift bundle i be carry under -PRON- arm 
at least i add there be a strange look black stone among the gold coin and i suppose -PRON- must be king palladium 
-PRON- be send forth to look for mr gilhooly and the steal treasure remark the professor 
olox and -PRON- gaddbaizet be likewise on the road but -PRON- have be able to leave -PRON- pretty well in the rear 
what be think of -PRON- absence 
i ask 
very little mr munn 
every officer of the state seem united in fix the blame upon mr gilhooly 
since -PRON- be know to be mentally unsound no crime could be attach to -PRON- act shall tell the truth of -PRON- i declare 
and be condemn to death by zet say the professor gaze at -PRON- fixedly 
let the king believe what -PRON- will say gilhooly should rather have -PRON- so since -PRON- mean so much to mr munn 
why do -PRON- not keep on to the other kingdom with the bolla inquire quinn of -PRON- 
because i didnot think i should be do the right thing i reply 
ah 
and why this sudden change in -PRON- sentiment mr munn canot explain -PRON- professor believe -PRON- be a theory of your that one thief have the right to take from another what do not belong to either of -PRON- 
two wrong do not make a right 
indeed 
the change in -PRON- sentiment be most suddenand remarkable 
will -PRON- please untie the sleeve of -PRON- coat and allow -PRON- to have a look at that black stone 
i lower -PRON- bundle and open -PRON- 
there say but poorly conceal the contempt i feel for the black stone as i point to -PRON- 
-PRON- may take stock in the superstition if -PRON- will professor but i will have none of -PRON- 
the professor give -PRON- a queer smile then pick up the bolla and survey -PRON- curiously 
would -PRON- like to look at -PRON- mr meig -PRON- ask fetish like this be a sure sign of barbarism observed meig take the stone 
the creature who inhabit this planet be not of a very high order mentally 
-PRON- pass the bolla to popham and popham hand -PRON- to markham 
-PRON- be presently return to -PRON- and i pack -PRON- away as before 
the professor then ask -PRON- for an account of what have happen during -PRON- flight toward baigol with the exchequer 
gilhooly be not able to help -PRON- much in the recital as the most important part of -PRON- adventure be a perfect blank to -PRON- 
i do not try to conceal anything from quinn 
i paint -PRON- design on the king money as black as -PRON- really be and -PRON- smile as -PRON- listen 
when do mr gilhooly lay hand on the bolla 
quinn ask 
how do -PRON- know that -PRON- do 
i return be very sure that -PRON- do be the quiet reply 
thereupon i tell the professor how i have throw the stone from the heap of gold and gilhooly have pick -PRON- up -PRON- reason return shortly afterward 
quinn wag -PRON- head sagely and mumble something i could not understand but which have to do with the ridiculous pretension of the bolla 
i fear then for the mind of this great and good man 
be -PRON- break under the tremendous responsibility incur by remove the plutocrat from earth 
a chill of apprehension shoot to -PRON- heart 
i be about to say something of a soothe nature to -PRON- patronfor i certainly look upon -PRON- as suchwhen olox and -PRON- gaddbaizet appear 
key seven of the high chief wordbox titillate with relief the instant the officer get -PRON- eye on gilhooly 
the exuberance fade into a note of foreboding and the foreboding into the word where be the king treasure house 
if that have not be recover calamity threaten -PRON- expedition to the planet terra 
the treasure house have be break and wreck reply the professor but -PRON- friend mr gilhooly and mr munn be return the gold to -PRON- majesty in -PRON- coat 
why should mr gilhooly steal the gold and then help to return -PRON- come incredulously from olox 
be -PRON- simply a vagary of -PRON- unbalanced mind be pleased to say chief olox that -PRON- mind be no longer unbalanced return the professor warn -PRON- to silence with a look as i be about to operate -PRON- talk machine 
mr gilhooly be now as sane as -PRON- or olox look worried declare say -PRON- donot know how the president and board of director of the interplanetary will regard this unexpected occurrence 
-PRON- should feel overjoyed at the unclouding of so bright a mind as mr but what if -PRON- interfere with the traffic of the road 
-PRON- have be run limited train on a schedule heretofore beyond -PRON- wild dream 
-PRON- majesty farm out the concession to the management of the road for ninetynine year on a cash basis 
if the traction power prove unavailable a demand will be make on the king for a return of the moneyand just now any depletion of the imperial coffer may prove fatal to the project expedition 
-PRON- be just as well that the exmagnate could not comprehend what be go on between the wordboxe 
the utilitarian view of the king as exemplify in case would have jar somewhat on -PRON- conceit and selfesteem 
i notice that a gleam of hope cross face when olox speak of a possible failure of the king plan of conquest through lack of the sinew of war 
but the hope die away almost instantly when quinn reflect as i do that the monarch be as unscrupulous as -PRON- be resourceful 
no further conversation be indulge in 
the royal troop execute an about face and return to the capital convoy -PRON- reunite party of alien 
as -PRON- draw up in the square the two glitter soldier appear in the turret and sound a call that draw the king to the balcony 
-PRON- majesty listen to the report of olox with a beam face but -PRON- smile flee when -PRON- learn how the traction interest of the realm be threaten by return sanity 
while this momentous question be still up for debate meig pluck at the professor sleeve 
tell the king professor say -PRON- -PRON- eye downcast that i see the error of -PRON- way and frankly acknowledge -PRON- 
if i be ever so fortunate as to get back to earth i shall be a reformer 
please ask the king when i can have -PRON- clothe 
and this be meigs 
have the heavens fall i could not have be more astounded 
tell -PRON- the same for -PRON- speak hannibal markham 
make -PRON- even strong if -PRON- will 
i have not be starve into should have withstand such a siege to the deathbut the change have be work here 
-PRON- strike a hand against -PRON- heart 
and ask -PRON- professor add markham plaintively to have -PRON- want supply immediately from the palace kitchen 
allow -PRON- to join -PRON- honorable friend in this free announcement of a change of heart chime in augustus popham 
look at -PRON- hand 
-PRON- hold -PRON- hand out to -PRON- and -PRON- find -PRON- calloused and scar canot go back to those mole burrow -PRON- supplement 
professor quinn show no sign of amazement 
after grasp the palm of each exmagnate -PRON- fairly electrify -PRON- wordbox with the supplication of the exile 
be these acknowledgment freely make and do -PRON- come from contrite heart say the king or do -PRON- merely cloak a desire to escape further privation at the expense of truth 
the professor indignantly repel the insinuation 
when -PRON- have finish -PRON- vigorous remark i step to the front and make a complete confession of -PRON- design on the bolla and the imperial exchequer 
quinn try to stop -PRON- but i would suffer no interference 
be -PRON- aware say the king gravely that lse maj felony and half a dozen other capital crime be mix up in -PRON- confession 
be i less courageous than an extrust magnate cry i warmly 
-PRON- confession free -PRON- from servitude and the inconvenience of hunger and lack of raiment respond the king yours condemn -PRON- to a blast of zet that will consume and dissipate -PRON- body as though -PRON- have never be 
professor quinn groan and turn away with one hand over -PRON- eye 
-PRON- affection reach out for the good man then as -PRON- have never do before 
bring on the indexograph olox command the king 
-PRON- will see how much of truth or falsehood -PRON- register in the case of these gentleman 
the indexograph be bring and test be make of all of -PRON- except the professor 
the ideograph must have register mightily in -PRON- favor for the king seem more than convince of -PRON- sincerity 
restore to the clothing trust man the apparel that be rightfully -PRON- order -PRON- majesty allow the gentleman who would monopolize food to partake of a sufficient supply to satisfy -PRON- hunger free the person who have be delve for -PRON- black block from further dutyand incidentally confiscate the fund pay into the royal treasury for -PRON- service as well as for the service of the traction powerfor mr sanity preclude -PRON- further use on the interplanetary 
be happy gentleman 
i feel that i must do some worthy deed to commemorate this the day that witness -PRON- departure for the subjugation of terra 
quinn be rent with conflicting emotion as be plainly apparent 
-PRON- be glad the explutocrat have fall into royal favor -PRON- be sorry to have -PRON- yet under that ban and -PRON- be greatly work up to learn that the king meditate such an early start on -PRON- interstellar campaign 
what of mr munn -PRON- highness -PRON- inquire 
oh yes return the king be forget -PRON- 
olox let -PRON- be decorate with the order of the open hand and see that -PRON- be induct on the morrow into the office of executionergeneral 
-PRON- need an executioner to fill the place of the late incumbent and i should have to look far before i find so conscientious a person as mr munn 
leave order with a subordinate olox 
neither -PRON- nor i will be here to attend the ceremony 
-PRON- royal will shall be convey to the regent 
and now add the king as -PRON- rise from -PRON- seat while the treasurer count the kyick and take care of the bolla olox -PRON- and i will proceed to the metal house guard by the gaddbaizet and accompany by -PRON- alien friend 
some preparation be necessary before a start for the car could be make and while these be go forward meig and markham be lead away to receive the attention -PRON- condition demand 
in an hour -PRON- be on the road 
meig and markham be in jubilant mood popham be optimistic but subdued gilhooly be silent and thoughtful and i be incline to look at the future with reckless indifference 
but professor quinn be bow under a grievous load 
if this madcap monarch carry out -PRON- scheme of conquest quinn feel that on -PRON- alone would rest the responsibility be make -PRON- plan mr munn -PRON- whisper hoarsely to -PRON- as -PRON- proceed on -PRON- journey to the car 
if the king expedition get away i shall have to accompany -PRON- and i shall take care that neither -PRON- nor -PRON- gaddbaizet ever reach -PRON- native planet 
but suppose -PRON- can outwit the king in some way i return and escape in the car leave -PRON- and -PRON- subject behind 
-PRON- and -PRON- other friend may go if -PRON- can possibly manage -PRON- say quinn but i have make up -PRON- mind to stay here 
i stop short and stare at -PRON- 
surely -PRON- canot mean that 
i exclaim do mean -PRON- -PRON- say firmly 
for the good of terra these creature of njambai must be watch 
-PRON- have only a surface knowledge of -PRON- and -PRON- resource 
what if -PRON- should bring forward other mean of span space besides -PRON- car -PRON- see the professor go on passionately that -PRON- misguided enthusiasm paint the wonder of earth in such glow color that king gaddbai will strain every effort to gratify -PRON- cupidity and lust for conquest 
i must remain here to combat -PRON- and hold -PRON- in check 
sir say i in trepidation think -PRON- take fright too easily 
once -PRON- leave njambai in the car -PRON- will be impossible for any of the baigadd to follow -PRON- 
-PRON- overestimate -PRON- possible resource 
whatever be possible can not be overestimate 
-PRON- may chance that i alone shall stand between this resolute monarch and the welfare and happiness of terra 
to desert -PRON- post would be cowardice 
do not seek to argue with -PRON- for i make up -PRON- mind to this last night 
the reckless indifference with which i have fare forth from the city give place to deep sorrow 
professor quinn observe this and continue do not exercise -PRON- over -PRON- fate mr munn 
i remove four rabid enemy of the people from -PRON- planet and i give back to -PRON- four eminent reformer 
-PRON- end have be accomplish beyond -PRON- fond dream if this be bring to pass 
and then too there be a work that i can do here even if -PRON- dire imagining prove unfounded 
i can after i know these mercurial better lead -PRON- perhaps to a high round in the ladder of civilization 
with the pattern of -PRON- earthly institution before -PRON- eye i can choose the good eliminate the evil and build a fabric here that will be a glory to whatever resource the orb may possess 
be -PRON- not a fair destiny for one who be laugh out of the astronomical society because -PRON- dare to have conviction as i do 
-PRON- be a destiny professor say which i intend to share with -PRON- 
-PRON- remain here and so do possibly -PRON- may become prime minister i will be executionergeneral 
between -PRON- -PRON- will have control of the situation 
that be not to be think of answer the professor hastily 
if -PRON- be possible for the exile to escape in the car -PRON- must accompany -PRON- as the one coolheade resourceful man capable of guide the car to -PRON- destination 
i shall instruct -PRON- carefully and fully 
and besides -PRON- add as i be about to demur -PRON- be a changed man mr munn 
there be work for -PRON- on the home planet for -PRON- native worth be to retrieve -PRON- on the very scene of -PRON- unworthy exploit 
i trust -PRON- follow -PRON- 
pardon -PRON- if i hurt -PRON- feeling by be too frank 
-PRON- have wittingly or unwittingly touch the vital chord which make -PRON- eager to regain the world i know and love 
to stand fair in the sight of man who have know -PRON- at -PRON- bad be now -PRON- one consume desire 
be this -PRON- wish professor quinn 
i ask huskily 
-PRON- be mr munn 
then i shall follow -PRON- instruction to the letter 
do so -PRON- say with one of -PRON- rare smile 
and if -PRON- dear desire compass fulfillment open this packet when -PRON- have leave njambai and be in the great void 
-PRON- will be -PRON- last word to -PRON- and -PRON- fellow voyager in space 
-PRON- hand a seal packet to -PRON- and i place -PRON- carefully in -PRON- breast pocket 
then a handclasp follow in which heart go out to heart as -PRON- rarely do between man and man 
look mr munn exclaim the professor release -PRON- palm 
-PRON- have reach the car 
-PRON- have come to a point in the underworld which the reflect ray of the sun reach but dimly 
there would have be semigloom but for an unreflected glow that fall upon -PRON- from above 
the car as have be bring out in the course of this narrative have be blow into the crater of a dead volcano 
this crater may be liken to a deep basin pierce with a huge hole at the bottom 
through the hole fall daylight from the outer shell bathe the car in a soft radiance 
the projectileshape house be stand upright and appear to have suffer no injury by -PRON- fall 
professor quinn have already explain to -PRON- how this may be possible 
the screen of the antigravity cube have be leave open by five decree 
the energy of the cube lighten the house to an extent that make -PRON- offer less than normal resistance to the temp and -PRON- also buoy -PRON- to withstand the shock of a tumble from the upper crust of the sphere 
how like an old friend that car look 
-PRON- heart labor at the mere sight of -PRON- 
-PRON- be to be -PRON- bridge through space if so -PRON- could contrive although -PRON- may easily fall out to prove a bridge for the king and the gaddbaizet to the earth undo 
after -PRON- have halt at the base of the car the king approach the professor 
-PRON- metal house be intact and uninjured say -PRON- majesty save for the door that give admittance to -PRON- 
-PRON- be necessary to burn out the lock with a draft of zet before the door could be open 
the telescope and the tub of white pigment have both be replace and -PRON- will i think find all -PRON- good and chattel intact 
how long before -PRON- can start 
let -PRON- first understand -PRON- arrangement -PRON- majesty the professor answer 
be -PRON- or olox to guide the car through space to -PRON- intend destination 
-PRON- be to do that 
neither i nor olox could manage the car i fear 
then i be to accompany -PRON- have so decide 
what of -PRON- friend 
-PRON- be to be leave here 
-PRON- need not worry about -PRON- however as -PRON- will be well care for 
i have already give proof of -PRON- interest in -PRON- 
before i can give -PRON- an answer as to when -PRON- will be well to start quinn remark after a little thought shall have to go into the car and make some calculation 
-PRON- will go in with -PRON- return the king should prefer to take only mr munn with -PRON- sir 
the king become suspicious and olox get the royal ear and say something in an undertone on -PRON- wordbox 
-PRON- and munn may go in the king say when olox have finish but -PRON- shall keep the rest of -PRON- friend with -PRON- while -PRON- be make -PRON- calculation 
very well 
the professor and i thereupon enter the car watch with some apprehension by meig and the rest 
possibly -PRON- fear that -PRON- be about to desert -PRON- if so the look the professor give -PRON- must have set -PRON- fear at rest 
a survey of the interior of the car show everything to be exactly as -PRON- have leave -PRON- 
the door at the top of the iron stairway have be force precisely as the other at the outside entrance have be but this be a matter of small importance 
the oxygen tank be intact and the professor show -PRON- how to manipulate the lever that regulate the supply necessary for the car there be still plenty of water of good quality in the reservoir and of food such as -PRON- be accustomed to there be an abundance 
everything appear to be in proper order and just as -PRON- should be 
-PRON- be very fortunate mr munn say quinn seat -PRON- on a box bring -PRON- in here with -PRON- less to have -PRON- help in examine the interior of the car than to seize an opportunity for give -PRON- a few direction which -PRON- will find of use 
when -PRON- leave earth -PRON- start at an hour which give -PRON- a course that angle sunward when -PRON- leave njambai however -PRON- must do so at an hour when this part of the planet be turn away from the sun and as far away as possible 
that will cause the car to be hurl toward the outer edge of the solar system and in the direction of the earth orbit wish i could inform -PRON- as to the exact position the earth will be in when -PRON- cross -PRON- orbit but the king mad project be spring so suddenly and -PRON- have act upon -PRON- plan so quickly that i have have no time for calculation in that respect 
-PRON- business however will be to overhaul the earth 
the telescope will inform -PRON- of the planet position and by properly regulate the screen of the cube -PRON- can hang in the orbit of terra until -PRON- reach -PRON- then once within -PRON- influence shut off the energy of the cube and suffer the car to fall to -PRON- surface 
do i make -PRON- plain 
entirely so professor i reply 
-PRON- understand the danger of landing 
all -PRON- can do be to experiment with the atmosphere while -PRON- be fall exactly as -PRON- do when land here 
on -PRON- quickness and discretion will depend the life of -PRON- and the other who will be with -PRON- 
-PRON- be a great responsibility sir say but -PRON- can depend upon -PRON- to do -PRON- utmost to avoid a disaster 
-PRON- press -PRON- hand to assure -PRON- of -PRON- confidence 
midnight tonight will be the hour to start 
the crater of the volcano will then be at -PRON- farth from the sun 
i shall so inform the king when -PRON- leave the car 
have -PRON- think of any plan whereby -PRON- may outwit -PRON- majesty 
i inquire have think of -PRON- 
prior to the moment of embarking i shall request -PRON- majesty to allow -PRON- and the rest of -PRON- friend to come aboard while i detain -PRON- and -PRON- follower outside for a few final instruction 
the king will suspect nothing for -PRON- will not imagine that i would allow -PRON- to escape and leave -PRON- behind shudder to think of that part of -PRON- i murmur 
will -PRON- not reconsider -PRON- determination professor 
no mr munn 
on that point i be adamant 
the instant -PRON- enter the car hurry aloft and set loose the oxygen 
i will drop this bit of rope near the door when -PRON- leave and -PRON- will have to make use of -PRON- to tie the door securely shut on the inside 
mind what i tell youdo not pull the lever until the door be securely closed will remember 
the car be exactly under the crater opening and -PRON- will have a clear path aloft 
therefore i would advise that -PRON- throw the lever to ninety the instant the door be fasten 
i nod think that be all 
-PRON- work be simple enough for in order to reach terra -PRON- have only to reduce or expand the energy of the antigravity cube 
-PRON- will now go below and rejoin the king 
just a few minute more professor i beg 
this may be -PRON- last opportunity for a private talk and there be something i wish to tell -PRON- 
-PRON- turn back from the top of the iron stairway 
go ahead mr munn say -PRON- 
all of -PRON- whom -PRON- bring to njambai i proceed be change man 
to -PRON- alone -PRON- owe this and i wish to go on record here and now for give -PRON- credit 
i see -PRON- past as i think i never should see -PRON- and i realize how i have waste a large part of -PRON- life 
i shall prove a worthy citizen if -PRON- succeed in get back to earth and -PRON- be -PRON- who have bring about -PRON- reformation 
a glow come to the professor face 
-PRON- hold up one hand protestingly 
-PRON- be the truth i insist 
-PRON- have argue with -PRON- constantly ever since -PRON- be throw together and -PRON- be while on the road to baigol that the truth of -PRON- argument suddenly come home to -PRON- 
i stretch out -PRON- hand but -PRON- hold back 
-PRON- be too shrewd a man mr munn say -PRON- kindly to be so deceived 
there have be time when -PRON- artlessness make -PRON- wonder but -PRON- have never arouse -PRON- wonder quite so much as -PRON- have now 
why be that 
i ask puzzle 
answer -PRON- this mr munn -PRON- go on 
how do -PRON- chance that mr gilhooly so suddenly recover -PRON- reason 
-PRON- lose -PRON- wit suddenly and craze people have be know to regain -PRON- sanity as quickly as -PRON- lose -PRON- 
-PRON- must have be so in case 
indeed -PRON- say smile 
and be -PRON- merely a coincidence that -PRON- find -PRON- conscience and gilhooly -PRON- reason at the same time 
merely a coincidence i reply 
-PRON- laugh and -PRON- be -PRON- first happy laugh since king gaddbai have announce -PRON- come campaign in the direction of terra 
let -PRON- go further -PRON- go on 
what cause markham popham and meig to change -PRON- point of view so miraculously 
be -PRON- the coal mine the lack of food and the need of decent clothing 
all that merely pave the way i aver 
-PRON- argument do the rest 
-PRON- be blind mr munn 
-PRON- be not the suffering -PRON- friend endure nor -PRON- argument 
then what be -PRON- 
i demand 
the bolla 
i recoil stare blankly at the kindly face before -PRON- let -PRON- part from -PRON- professor quinn i whisper hoarsely feel that i have leave behind a man of unsound mind 
if i think that i believe i should remain here with -PRON- at any cost 
unsound mind -PRON- return 
-PRON- dear munn 
-PRON- brain be never clear nor -PRON- reason more sound than at the present moment 
-PRON- find the bolla 
the moment -PRON- pick -PRON- up every unworthy thought vanish from -PRON- mind and -PRON- become morally the man -PRON- ought to be 
-PRON- do not understand the cause of -PRON- salvation and -PRON- hurl the stone from -PRON- 
gilhooly pick -PRON- up 
what happen then 
do -PRON- not recover -PRON- sense and a true outlook upon life at one and the same time 
yet as if this be not enough to prove a clear case for the bolla note the change in popham markham and meig when i ask -PRON- to examine the stone 
all this sir should prove -PRON- contention beyond all peradventure 
i be fill with wonder because -PRON- have go so far afield in try to explain what have occur 
the notion amazed and in a measure disappoint -PRON- 
a black stone have turn -PRON- from -PRON- evil coursea mere bit of insensate matter about which cluster the tradition and superstitious veneration of all njambian 
-PRON- regeneration have come from without and not from within and if there be no credit for the professor in -PRON- awakening then there be still less for -PRON- 
not the operation of -PRON- own mind urge and guide by the friendly counsel of the professor but a stone which i have pick up to cast away have work -PRON- transformation 
the fact still remain and would always remain but -PRON- be in no way flatter to -PRON- 
what be go on in -PRON- mind must have be divine by the professor for -PRON- step close and take the hand which -PRON- have a moment before refuse 
the method of fate be inexplicable to -PRON- mortal mr munn say -PRON- but what matter -PRON- how a thing be bring to pass so long as -PRON- really happen 
and why should -PRON- concern -PRON- with a failure to understand the underlying cause 
great be the bolla -PRON- friend even though -PRON- power pass -PRON- comprehension 
i shall make -PRON- a point to see that -PRON- be return to king golbai during -PRON- probation here 
to accomplish that and at the same time keep watchful eye on king gaddbai will not let time hang heavy on -PRON- hand 
and -PRON- will not reconsider -PRON- know what i be about to say press -PRON- hand restrainingly and get up from -PRON- seat 
presently -PRON- remove a few foot of rope from a bale and take a last long look around -PRON- 
what -PRON- thought be i will not even hazard a guess 
cut loose from every tie that hold -PRON- to earth i know very well what -PRON- feeling would have be under the circumstance 
but i have already state that the professor be queer in -PRON- outlook upon life and in -PRON- grasp of way and mean so -PRON- pen hesitate to attempt a description of -PRON- emotion at this critical moment 
when -PRON- emerge from the steel shell the king and -PRON- retainer crowd close to hear what -PRON- companion have to say 
-PRON- majesty be greatly disappointed on learn that the start be not to be make until some hour have pass but -PRON- smother -PRON- impatience and busy -PRON- with a communication to the regent give the exact hour the expedition intend to take -PRON- departure 
the historian choose to accompany the monarch and put into imperishable ideograph the history -PRON- be to make transcribe the king message and -PRON- be dispatch by courier to the capital 
follow this business -PRON- majesty entertain -PRON- with a review of the gaddbaizet select by olox for the expedition 
the diminutive soldier be welldrille wellequippe and present a dazzling spectacle in -PRON- gilt war paint and yellow kirtle 
-PRON- be truly the flower of the country 
each carry a pair of zetbais fill to the white tip with a special supply of zet 
quinn now that -PRON- mind be make up to defeat the king and to remain on njambia display much interest in the maneuvre even go so far as to applaud -PRON- 
store of prepared food have be collect in bale which be pile in a heap beside the car ready for loading 
one bale be open toward the close of day and -PRON- use -PRON- content for -PRON- supper ration 
night fall and the professor ask -PRON- to enter the car and light the lamp on the table 
i do so and in the glow that come through the car window -PRON- who be not gift with the owlsight of the njambaian be able to see a little of what go on around -PRON- 
as the night advance and king gaddbai evince -PRON- impatience and excitement by walk back and forth in front of -PRON- pick guard strain of the national anthem be bear to -PRON- from a distance 
louder and louder swell the tone of the wordboxe and at last the regent arrive accompany by a host from the town 
-PRON- be there to give -PRON- monarch a rousing sendoff and i smile a little as i think of the disappointment that be likely to overtake -PRON- 
while felicitation be be exchange between the king and -PRON- people professor quinn ask -PRON- to consult -PRON- watch 
i find that -PRON- be within fifteen minute of midnight 
-PRON- timepiece be not strictly accurate inasmuch as in the exciting event of the morning i have neglect -PRON- usual custom of set the hand three minute back 
however the indicate time be close enough for all practical purpose 
into the car with -PRON- mr munn say the professor as calmly as though -PRON- command be not go to separate -PRON- from -PRON- kind for all eternity 
i would have take -PRON- hand have -PRON- not observe the movement and say quickly 
be careful 
-PRON- must not let these people suspect by a word or gesture the sort of coup -PRON- be plan 
take the other with will speak to the king and cover -PRON- movement as i have already outline 
those be professor last word to -PRON- 
-PRON- final glimpse of -PRON- show -PRON- -PRON- resolute face and slender form drift away into the gloom in the direction of king gaddbai 
i feel as though i must run after -PRON- and drag -PRON- into the car whether -PRON- would or no 
how i succeed in fight down the mad impulse have ever since be a mystery to -PRON- but i do and a word to popham meigs markham and gilhooly who have already be inform that -PRON- be to expect a startling dnouement bring -PRON- after -PRON- into the steel structure 
i hear olox give a loud command for -PRON- to turn back but -PRON- wordbox be suddenly quiet and i presume that the professor have already go far enough with -PRON- part of the ruse to lull any suspicion that have arise 
rope that steel door on the inside gilhooly 
i cry as i bound up the iron stair 
gilhooly do not know what have be plan but leap instantly to the task 
with a quick pull of the lever i open the oxygen tank and dash below once more 
something have go wrong do not know what and do not know to this day 
the mysterious violet fire which accompany a discharge of the zetbais be roll all around the steel wall that hem -PRON- in and a perfect tumult of shriek and cry come frantically to -PRON- car 
violent hand be lay on the door push -PRON- inward against the rope make fast by gilhooly 
gilhooly and the other hurl -PRON- at the portal and fling -PRON- back hold -PRON- so by main strength be kill shout meig 
no i yell and jump to the switch board 
the next instant the switch be throw and the billow of fire fade from the car window as if by magic 
-PRON- be save 
again have -PRON- plunge into space and behind uslive or dead i know notwe have leave professor quinn 
sink down on -PRON- knee i bury -PRON- face in -PRON- hand 
i have hear some one say that life be only a dream and that when -PRON- awaken in the other country -PRON- shall find -PRON- so 
far be -PRON- from -PRON- to dispute this or affirm -PRON- yet i know of -PRON- own experience that -PRON- wake moment furnish event that seem as illusory as the stuff that dream be make of 
of all -PRON- strange adventure the flight from njambai have be the one that i recall with most vividness and at the same time as seem the most unreal 
the tension of -PRON- nerve at the moment may account for this 
as i state somewhere close to the beginning of this narrative what i set out to write be a description of the planet mercury in so far as -PRON- limited ability for observation enable -PRON- to gather knowledge 
in look back over -PRON- manuscript i find i have make -PRON- more of an adventurous tale than i intend 
now when near the close i can hold more closely to -PRON- text and deal only generally with -PRON- return trip to terra 
-PRON- be needless to dwell upon the way -PRON- miss and mourn the professor 
at every turn some want develop which -PRON- could easily have satisfy have -PRON- be with -PRON- 
however -PRON- wisdom have start -PRON- correctly and -PRON- have perforce to make shift and get along without -PRON- as best -PRON- could 
as captain of the car the weight of a great responsibility rest on -PRON- 
i be almost constantly at the telescope and i keep whom i have the most confidenceabout as constantly at the switch board 
-PRON- be menace by frequent danger during the trip -PRON- course be literally strew with meteoroid which -PRON- require much deft maneuvring to evade but -PRON- come safely out of these peril and as if to compensate -PRON- for -PRON- -PRON- form a most happy juncture with the orbit at a time when that planet be approach and nearly upon -PRON- 
with gilhooly at the lever and -PRON- at the telescope -PRON- accomplish a very successful landing 
so evenly balance do the car hang between the cube and the draw power of gravity that the last thousand foot of -PRON- descent be merely a float earthward and -PRON- alight with so slight a shock that none of -PRON- experience a particle of inconvenience 
the land that claim -PRON- be a deserted island in where -PRON- remain for two week live off -PRON- food supply and keep a sharp lookout for a sail 
-PRON- have not be more than a day on the island before i remember the document professor quinn have give -PRON- 
i have be direct to open -PRON- while on -PRON- way through the great void but i have be so burden with responsibility during that time that i have not once think of the packet 
with -PRON- four companion as auditor i read aloud one of the paper inclose in the packet which be address to all of -PRON- jointly 
when -PRON- read this i trust that the plan of -PRON- and mr munn will have prove so far successful that an impassable gulf will stretch between -PRON- and the undersignedand i write this out of a desire to have -PRON- speed on -PRON- return to -PRON- native planet not because i would willingly separate -PRON- from -PRON- be circumstance here different from what -PRON- have find -PRON- 
as long as i live i shall stand between king gaddbai and any monstrous plan -PRON- may form and attempt to carry out look to the subjugating of the world -PRON- know and love so well 
i be convince that the king have resource of which -PRON- know nothing and -PRON- shall be -PRON- aim to fathom the resource of njambai and assist in -PRON- development along other and more peaceable line 
this be to be -PRON- work and i enter upon -PRON- with a tranquil soul 
no doubt i take what -PRON- gentleman may think be an unwarranted liberty in lure four of -PRON- number to -PRON- castle and cast -PRON- adrift in the unknown 
as for -PRON- i believe i have ample warrant for do what i do i will not dwell on that motive as -PRON- be already familiar to -PRON- 
the experience each of -PRON- have have on njambai have be most salutary 
-PRON- have undergo a change of heart and reform have work -PRON- great work 
have i not be assure of this none of -PRON- would ever have leave this sphere for that other one which have be the cradle of -PRON- pet scheme in speculation 
-PRON- be not the same man -PRON- be 
as reformer -PRON- will do -PRON- share to preserve -PRON- noble country from dire calamity that threaten -PRON- 
that be -PRON- mission and see to -PRON- that -PRON- fail not in -PRON- performance 
-PRON- be -PRON- prayerful hope that -PRON- will reach -PRON- destination in safety and with mr munn at the helm i be prone to think that this result will be achieve 
if a civilized country claim -PRON- immediately upon land -PRON- be -PRON- wish that -PRON- give full power to the antigravity cube and send the car into space -PRON- be -PRON- wish that none of -PRON- give a record of -PRON- experience to the paper either wholly or in part until five year have pass and then that this duty devolve upon mr munn and -PRON- be -PRON- final wish that mr munn accept the enclose deed to -PRON- harlem lot and the enclose check make payable to -PRON- all the fund i have in bank 
i would have -PRON- return to the other four of -PRON- an equivalent for the fund and valuable steal the night -PRON- leave earth in the car 
-PRON- second wish as to the revelation -PRON- gentleman could make be bear of a desire to save the earth dweller any unnecessary fear on the score of king gaddbai and -PRON- undertakings 
if -PRON- have not invade terra with -PRON- terrifying zetbais by the time five year have elapse -PRON- be -PRON- conviction that the danger will be do away with forever 
gentleman adieu 
as -PRON- read this i give -PRON- hail from njambai 
a fortnight after the reading of the above document -PRON- sight a sail on the horizon and by mean of a rope reach from the switch board through a window the lever be pull and professor castle shoot into the cloud and vanish for all time 
three hour later -PRON- be pick up by a whale boat convey to the tramp steamer mollie and in a month sail through the golden gate into san francisco harbor 
the five year have pass and i have set -PRON- hand to the foregoing 
gilhooly and meig have cross to the great majority but the strenuous work -PRON- do in the interest of the people be an imperishable monument to -PRON- memory 
popham and markham be still labor for the good of the cause 
the return to home and friend of these four long give up for dead cause a sensation throughout the country 
true to the express wish of professor quinn none of -PRON- have breathe a whisper of the marvelous thing -PRON- see or of the weird experience that fall to -PRON- lot while journey to and from njambai and while sojourn upon that planet 
so far as i be concern -PRON- life since -PRON- return to earth have be as spotless as a thorough reformation could make -PRON- 
as far as i could i have reimburse those from whom i take what be not rightfully -PRON- i have plead the cause of the poor man and help -PRON- liberally out of the generous fortune bestow upon -PRON- by professor quinn and i intend to pursue this line of action until the last day of -PRON- life 
could a reform burglar have a more suitable occupation

-PRON- be one thing to prevent -PRON- fortune from be wreck by reconnoiter the enemy but -PRON- be quite another thing to sit at table with the general of the hostile camp and carry the espial into -PRON- very household

guy be consume with a desire to laugh but suppress -PRON- strenuously 
-PRON- be not a laugh matter for the citizen in the hall and not one detect a trace of humor in the situation 
a 4o -PRON- friend the enemy murmur of rage sweep through the assemblage and col dingle spring to -PRON- foot with a fierce cry 
-PRON- be all hoodlum and rowdy on the other side of the county -PRON- shout toss -PRON- arm and the archfiend who lead the rab ble be that schemer that political trickster that preminent rascal archibald keever

there be not and guy be participate in the general feeling of relief when barney cry out hunchback squire 
that doesnot say any thing about a hunchback think -PRON- couldnot read barney re turn vlandingham accompany the word with a severe look

this note doesnot describe such a person but i know who the man be 
if mr turn to guy and hand -PRON- the assist -PRON- -PRON- will be able to capture -PRON- without trouble or violence 
please read that mr herbert and inform -PRON- whether a friend in need -PRON- be acquaint with the individual de scribe 
guy glance at the writing hurriedly 
yes sir -PRON- reply know -PRON- 
will -PRON- go with barney here apprehend the fellow and see that -PRON- stay at -PRON- house until i come 
guy see how vlandingham be try to save -PRON- 
-PRON- note also the perplexed face of the citizen in front and of those on the platform especially be -PRON- aware of blank amaze 
the latter eye be start from -PRON- head and -PRON- be evident that -PRON- brain be violently dis turbed 
guy give vlandingham a square and manly look 
on -PRON- honor mr vlandingham say -PRON- the man will be at -PRON- house when -PRON- get there 
why gasp barney level -PRON- finger that there silence roar vlandingham knock the extended arm downward 
-PRON- be to go with mr herbert and apprehend this man and take -PRON- to -PRON- house 
not a word from -PRON-

-PRON- horse throw -PRON- eh 
a likely story -PRON- look very much as will have meet -PRON- that -PRON- though -PRON- be late purposely 
-PRON- something to explain barney when i at -PRON- house 
for the present show know how to obey order 
go with mr herbert 
-PRON- friend the enemy barney face about automatically and start for the door 
guy follow at -PRON- heel 
aside from -PRON- echoing footstep there be not a sound in the room 
the captain and mr boomer part and allow -PRON- to pass mr boomer finger -PRON- revolver nervously 
the guard in the passageway eye -PRON- keenly and the man with the rifle at the foot of the stair suffer -PRON- to depart without a word 
when -PRON- be well on -PRON- way to willowview barney find -PRON- tongue 
well dinge -PRON- mutter the spy ainot -PRON- the man describe in the note answer guy who do not relish the harsh term 
at that precise moment -PRON- be wish col keever at the antipode 
-PRON- own folly in allow e the colonel to influence -PRON- come in for a large share of -PRON- condemnation 
well a hun dre time that -PRON- lose every cent -PRON- have in the world and preserve -PRON- selfrespect

-PRON- do that to save -PRON- from the hand of the harmony people answer guy with a dash of irritation so work up over this countyseat matter that -PRON- would have act first and think about -PRON- action afterwards 
-PRON- bet -PRON- would

barney whistle 
if the people at the meetin have know who -PRON- be i guess -PRON- would have be carry back to concord foot foremost 
guy make no answer to this and -PRON- shortly arrive at squire house 
-PRON- ring be answer by miss betty -PRON- 
mr herbert -PRON- exclaim smilingly know very well that father wouldnot allow -PRON- to be hurt 
but -PRON- take frightful chance 
why be -PRON- here barney 
the squire send -PRON- along to see that -PRON- didnot get away respond barney valiantly 
well -PRON- neednot remain see that -PRON- doesnot get away 
good night 
the door be close in the astounded face 
come into the parlor mr herbert say miss betty 
guy couldnot understand the situation at all 
-PRON- friend the enemy miss betty do not seem to abate one jot or tittle of -PRON- friendliness consummate actress guy think the storm will come before long 
miss betty motion towards a chair 
after guy have obediently seat -PRON- -PRON- take a rocker visavis 
-PRON- think for a moment and then laugh softly 
to think -PRON- remark that neither father nor on hear -PRON- name ever think of connect -PRON- with mr montfort herbert of the concord townsite company and -PRON- board that freight train at concord too why donot -PRON- denounce -PRON- for be a spy ask guy impatiently 
why should i denounce -PRON- 
concord be -PRON- town mr herbert and -PRON- be right for -PRON- to do what -PRON- can to hold the countyseat 
harmony be -PRON- town and -PRON- shall do what -PRON- can to take the countyseat away from -PRON- sorry for -PRON- for your be a lose fight 
yet there be mean -PRON- would not counte nance even in a struggle of this kind will have no violence 
that be why i add a line to the note which barney bring from concord 
that line have escape guy 
-PRON- take the note from -PRON- pocket and see pencil dimly at the bottom the word see that no harm come to mr herbertbetty -PRON- draw a deep breath 
then i have -PRON- to thank for -PRON- present safety say -PRON- replace the note in -PRON- pocket 
a friend in need please donot misunderstand -PRON- mr herbert return miss betty 
-PRON- father rule passion be real estate 
-PRON- want to sell -PRON- some lot in harmony and for fear -PRON- wouldnot be where -PRON- could watch -PRON- -PRON- insist on have -PRON- come here 
that be also -PRON- reason for take -PRON- to the meeting and -PRON- have not the slight notion -PRON- be harbor an enemy 
miss betty laugh again 
at heart -PRON- resume -PRON- father be one of the noble man in the world but i can not remember that -PRON- ever champion a losing cause 
whenever -PRON- enter a fight -PRON- go in to win 
with -PRON- aid -PRON- be go to be victorious in this countyseat affair 
-PRON- speak decisively donot know -PRON- real motive for come here but i presume -PRON- want to look over the rival town and find out what chance there be for concord retain -PRON- prestige 
that be partly -PRON- admit guy 
but i also wish to attend the meeting and find out if i could what move -PRON- side intend to make 
col keever suggest that do -PRON- not 
-PRON- be suggest to -PRON- 
and -PRON- endeavor to follow out this counsel against -PRON- well judgment be very sorry now that i act on the sug gestion at all 
-PRON- be too much of a gentleman for this sort of work mr herbert 
a countyseat contest of this kind be a very disagreeable affair 
why should there ever have be a contest 
-PRON- friend the enemy that be because concord steal the county seat away from harmony in the first place 
the vote be close and the canvass board buy by col keever throw out a sufficient number of harmony vote to give the countyseat to con cord 
the blue eye snap and the thin nos tril dilate 
for this reason the question have be reopen mr herbert and -PRON- be for this reason also that i be heart and soul in the conflict 
i will have no violence but col keever may have to be meet with -PRON- own weapon in order that right and justice may prevail 
-PRON- can be good enemy and good friend as well and after the will try to forget the disagreeable incident of the campaign 
with all -PRON- heart declare guy 
-PRON- offer -PRON- -PRON- hand and -PRON- press the little palm cordially 
at that moment -PRON- hear run foot along the road by the gate angry shout and now and then the report of a revolver 
betty spring up and hurry to a window a mob in front -PRON- say quietly but -PRON- need have no fear mr herbert 
-PRON- be just as safe under this roof as -PRON- would be in concord 
guy greatly admire -PRON- calmness but -PRON- un derestimate -PRON- courage if -PRON- think for a moment that -PRON- be frightened 
before -PRON- could reply squire vlandingham hurry into the room come from the rear of the house 
a friend in need get a horse at the barn herbert all saddle bridle and wait say -PRON- quickly donot want to alarm -PRON- but some of those rascal out there be drunk and barney have tell -PRON- everything better go i may be powerless to protect -PRON- 
some one jangle the bell furiously 
a scuffling of foot and muttering of hoarse voice come from the porch 
there -PRON- be say betty 
-PRON- talk with -PRON- at the door father while i show mr -PRON- bert where -PRON- can find the horse 
vlandingham start for the hall but pause to reach out -PRON- hand to guy donot believe -PRON- know what kind of a hor net nest -PRON- be go to get into over here herbert get betty on -PRON- side i can see that and i donot lie up any hard feeling advise -PRON- though to give this burg a wide berth in future 
-PRON- see i hold the win card in this fight and can afford to be magnani mous 
guy wrung hand and follow betty outside to a post where a horse be hitch 
untie the halter -PRON- vault into the saddle 
betty direct -PRON- how to go hope i shall see -PRON- again miss vlande ham -PRON- observe 
-PRON- may see -PRON- when -PRON- least expect -PRON- -PRON- answer will send the horse back tomorrow 
5o -PRON- friend the enemy any time that -PRON- find -PRON- convenient will be soon enough 
remember -PRON- be enemy on countyseat matter 
and friend on all other 
if -PRON- wish -PRON- do wish -PRON- 
good bye 
-PRON- wave -PRON- hand and -PRON- speed away into the night 
guy have a lonely ride back to concord over the broad flat starlit land 
-PRON- could see the road dimly a lightish streak cut the dark turf of the plain 
a moist lush smell arise from the dewy grass and the croaking of frog the chirping of cricket and the resonant boom of the bittern float from the sedge serve only to intensify the stillness 
there be far more to this countyseat business than guy have imagine 
miss betty feel that harmony have be cheat out of -PRON- right and that be the cause of -PRON- inexorable stand in the present contest of the voter in the county have sign the petition for a special elec tion and -PRON- be a foregone conclusion that these twothird would vote for harmony 
without doubt this be the premise on which squire vlan dingham and -PRON- daughter be build -PRON- hope 
-PRON- ground be well take but guy have information relative to col import voter 
-PRON- do not know what the voting strength of the county be but -PRON- be sure the colonel have be sharp enough to bring in suffi -PRON- friend the enemy cient ballot to overcome the twothird majority 
the young man do not fancy this phase of the question although the entire contest be gradu ally present -PRON- to -PRON- as a case of diamond cut diamond 
-PRON- have be bring up in abhor rence of way that be dark and trick that be vain but now that -PRON- be in rome why should -PRON- not emulate the roman 
to take any other stand be equivalent to bankrupt -PRON- for what chance would concord have if -PRON- order the import voter out of the town or per mitte -PRON- to exercise the right of franchise un influence 
if order away -PRON- may flock to harmony in a body and if permit to vote as -PRON- please -PRON- may be subsidize by agent of vlandingham 
the matter be a delicate one and to be handle with extreme caution 
the temptation to look out for -PRON- at all cost be a powerful one and have not miss betty -PRON- self say that -PRON- be right for -PRON- to do all -PRON- could to keep the countyseat at concord 
tak e everything into consideration guy think -PRON- would be well to lay back on -PRON- oar watch the opposition and see what happen 
-PRON- have a number of thought concern miss betty entirely apart from the political question and in the fair field where -PRON- be to esteem each other as friend 
these be headstrong fancy and so vividly tint with the hue of youth that -PRON- be more properly dream and not to be chronicle 
concord invade arrive in concord guy leave the horse at the livery barn and make -PRON- way along the dark and deserted street to the lisbon house 
this hotel be under the proprietorship of a portuguese 
be unable to pronounce -PRON- name the people of concord rise up and bestow upon -PRON- the patronymic of smith 
retain -PRON- multitude of christian name -PRON- full title thus become pedro fernandez jos manuel smith 
this be of course altogether too long for a pioneer community and when pedro fernandez be not plain smith -PRON- be pedro or cinch which be practically the same 
almost any day pedro may be see sit in front of -PRON- establishment wear -PRON- white apron and square white cap -PRON- leg cross elbow on -PRON- knee complacently swinge -PRON- suspend foot and puff at a corncob pipe 
-PRON- be thus that guy find the proprietor when -PRON- come out from breakfast on the morning after -PRON- ride from harmony 
the early train from the west have just stop at the station as guy take a chair on the porch and light a cigar 
quite an excitement when the train come in observed pedro 
so -PRON- seem return guy look at the little throng which have gather on the platform and part of which be visible around the end of the station building 
-PRON- see mr glimmer and lemuel bilkin among other and give especial -PRON- friend the enemy attention to a slender youth whose fiery hair curl fringingly about the edge of -PRON- old cap 
this latter individual be throw a canvas bag into the open door of the mail car 
sampson venture pedro note the direction of gaze 
work for the colonel and be just throw on the eastbound bundle of this week blizzard a copy of -PRON- if -PRON- would like to run -PRON- over a mighty warm number countyseat war be gettin interestin 
pedro pull the paper out from under -PRON- apron and guy examine -PRON- lazily 
there be a redhot leader in the scorch style pick the county commissioner to tatter and then hold e these remnant up to public contumely 
the intrinsic value of the article do not interest guy quite so much as something else 
-PRON- bring out the note which squire vlandingham have hand -PRON- at the town meeting the night beforea scrap which -PRON- be treasure simply and solely because of miss pencil message to -PRON- father at the bottom of -PRON- 
turn the note over -PRON- peruse the writing on the back as -PRON- have do once before that morning 
the chirography be a blot scrawl and the ink be purple in color 
guy remember that the ink which the colonel have jar out of -PRON- stand on the precede afternoon be of that identical hue 
yet this be not all 
the writing on the back of that note be the counterpart of a frac tion of the leader word for word comma for concord invade comma and exclamation point for exclamation point 
have guy a piece of the copy in -PRON- hand 
be this a clue to the identity of the broom man mention by barney break from pedro smith as -PRON- get up from -PRON- chair 
here come three passen ger from the west 
-PRON- donot get many from that direction 
guy thrust the note back into -PRON- pocket and look towards the station 
the train have go and the curious citizen be head back towards the business section of the town

when all the other be on the office floor a debate as to the punishment which should be mete out to col dingle be at once begin 
a few suggest hang in no equivocal term a large number be of the opinion that tar and feather be as far as -PRON- should go while a conservative element believe that col dingle would suffer sufficient punishment if -PRON- be set astride a pole and ridden out of town

instead of contend among -PRON- suppose -PRON- inquire into the method of col escape 
and be forget about -PRON- 
-PRON- may be severely hurt 
this be sufficient to turn the attention of the crowd into another channel and guy lead the back ward movement along the hall to the spot where the unfortunate printer be lie 
sampson have not move a hair breadth 
-PRON- be flat on -PRON- back -PRON- arm and leg sprawl out and -PRON- eye close

remember that i be here in the interest of harmony and that -PRON- be -PRON- duty to look out for concord 
with that -PRON- turn away and guy follow sampson out of the room 
col keever be tremendously work up 
-PRON- be pace the restrict limit of -PRON- office and toss -PRON- arm and talk to -PRON- so wrath fully oblivious of -PRON- surrounding that -PRON- do not notice the entrance of guy and sampson for several moment 
occasionally the colonel would halt glower at a copy hook fasten to the wall shake -PRON- fist at -PRON- and address -PRON- by such term as infernal scoundrel contemptible cur and so on 
fi nally -PRON- jerk the hook from the wall cast -PRON- on the floor and set -PRON- heel on the sheet that be string upon -PRON-

gad what would -PRON- do if a man strike -PRON- twice across the face with -PRON- hat 
knock -PRON- down say guy promptly and that s what any man with an ordinary temper would do 
but that would only be a halfway measure with -PRON- 
i presume -PRON- notice that i do not knock dingle down do be the dry response restrain -PRON- hold -PRON- in check in col flash in the pan order that i may take a more terrible vengeance 
herbert i be go to have life l -PRON- certainly be not there there try to argue with -PRON- for -PRON- be useless utterly useless 
i have make up -PRON- mind 
let -PRON- assure -PRON- that i be no stranger to the field of honor 
at one time sir the code duello be -PRON- vade mecum 
i count that day lose herbert which pass without -PRON- call some one out 
the colonel pull the brim of -PRON- white top hat firmly down over -PRON- brow 
in -PRON- estimation a stiff white hat be the acme of gentility the crown and symbol of a gentleman 
a stiff white hat moreover throw about -PRON- wearer a political glamour which be something not to be ignore by the editor of that justly celebrate sheet the concord blizzard 
the colonel not only pull down the brim of -PRON- hat but -PRON- button the two low button of -PRON- frock coat across -PRON- capacious stomach rest one elbow on the top of -PRON- desk and swing -PRON- caneswung -PRON- slowly and relentlessly

the vehicle be a covered sur rey and barney have a shotgun lie beside -PRON- on the front seat mine 
-PRON- face be set and deter loyal to vlandingham be man tal comment glad of that for i can count on -PRON- to do -PRON- utmost lady

-PRON- come out of a store down the street and bolt past shout all sort of direful threat against old daughter 
i be al most sorry i help -PRON- out of -PRON- dilemma last night mr herbert 
but for -PRON- meddling -PRON- would not have be here to betray -PRON- identity 
-PRON- close the notebook with a curt little snap lay the pencil on -PRON- cover and wrap the tape line around and around do not care for -PRON- self particularly as i know -PRON- fellowcitizen would not dare to do anything very desperate 
a narrow escape but miss pinkney be not make of such stern stuff as i be 
-PRON- be very unkind and ungrateful of -PRON- mr herbert face have become almost as white as miss do -PRON- think for a moment -PRON- gasp that i would do such a dastardly thing 
who else could have do -PRON- 
-PRON- look at -PRON- hopefully ask with -PRON- eye as plainly as eye could ask anything that -PRON- lift -PRON- from the depth to which -PRON- have fall in -PRON- estimation 
-PRON- seem to have no regard for the peril of -PRON- position appear to desire only an explana tion and half fear -PRON- could not give -PRON- 
-PRON- be do by some one else say guy in desperate earnest 
take -PRON- word for -PRON- 
an explanation would consume too much time and endanger -PRON- chance of escape 
i have have that carriage make ready for -PRON- 
please get into -PRON- at once without a moment delay 
as soon as those man find -PRON- be not at the hotel -PRON- will go elsewhere to look for -PRON- 
who be the driver of the carriage ask miss betty able to see only one side of the vehicle through the narrow door 
barney say guy a man whom -PRON- can trust implicitly 
lois say miss betty get into the carriage 
i think -PRON- be mistaken about mr herbert 
anyway i shall stay here long enough to make sure 
-PRON- friend the enemy miss pinkney leave hurriedly and miss betty again turn to guy 
-PRON- be too bad that the high opinion -PRON- some time form of people on first acquaintance should be overthrow say -PRON- and i be very much disappointed when force to the conclusion that -PRON- have tell of -PRON- presence here 
now tell -PRON- truly mr herbert be not this a little plan of -PRON- to get -PRON- to leave concord without ac complishe the work that bring -PRON- here 
great heaven no cried guy 
-PRON- would have be a very clever plan -PRON- go on demurely 
have a carriage ready -PRON- know tell the populace send -PRON- rush away on a wrong scent and thus make -PRON- glad of the opportunity to avail -PRON- of the carriage which -PRON- refuse this morning 
as a ruse -PRON- would have be wait any longer implored guy fancy i can hear -PRON- pursuer come 
-PRON- bend -PRON- head listeningly 
no not yet -PRON- answer lightly 
who be -PRON- tell of -PRON- man who will never again go back to har mony 
-PRON- name be hepburn and -PRON- work on the railroad in -PRON- town but be discharge yesterday 
i refuse to purchase -PRON- information but col keever pay for -PRON- and i hear what -PRON- have to say 
i have do what i could for -PRON- miss vlandingham know -PRON- mr herbert and in order that -PRON- a narrow escape work may not have be do in vain i be go e 
i have perform the mission that bring -PRON- here so look out for a master stroke on the part of harmony 
-PRON- flash a bright smile at -PRON- and be out of the building and into the carriage before -PRON- could reach -PRON- side and give -PRON- any assistance 
barney use -PRON- whip and just as -PRON- team start along the street towards the railroad track col keever and -PRON- follower break from the hotel and race back in the direction of the blizzard office 
guy halt stock still and hold -PRON- breath 
the carriage be upon the man and almost past -PRON- before any attention be pay to -PRON- 
-PRON- be the fortune to catch first sight of the lady who be lean back on the rear seat in the shelter of the side curtain 
there -PRON- be cry keever team stop that catch the horse head but barney ply the lash vigorously and before the companion be able to act on -PRON- warning the carriage be beyond -PRON- all and whirl -PRON- passenger rapidly away 
the road to harmony lead past the depot across the railroad track and then bear off to the left 
with a fresh team and a good start there be no doubt that barney would have distance -PRON- pur suer have not the road be unexpectedly block 
the noon train suddenly draw up to the depot platform 
-PRON- be a long train and so completely 9o -PRON- friend the enemy obstruct the way that there be no get around -PRON- without turn squarely about and retrace the street for a full block 
such a move would have be disastrous for the pursuer be not more than a hundred yard behind 
a yell of triumph go up from the throat of col keever and -PRON- man 
guy start at a run for the scene 
before -PRON- come anywhere near the carriage however -PRON- see miss vlandingham and miss pinkney descend from -PRON- and hurry to the train 
a brakeman help -PRON- up the step of the near car signal go ahead to the conductor and the latter give the word to the engineer 
but already col keever pant like a por poise have clutch the iron handrail 
close be hind -PRON- be dick pettibone the sheriff 
hold this train l bellow the colonel 
get off there shout barney press the line between -PRON- knee and fling the shotgun to -PRON- shoulder 
drop off that train col keever or the train have begin to move 
pettibone have not be able to get aboard but the colonel have and be stand on the low step 
-PRON- look around at command and the sight of the gun stagger -PRON- shoot donot shoot -PRON- cry frantically and spring to the ground lose -PRON- footing fall flat and roll over and over in the dust of the road sho will or keever col train that off drop guy have come up with the baffled crowd just in time to witness the discomfiture 
-PRON- experience a sense of great relief at the escape of miss betty and -PRON- friend and keep -PRON- as much in the background as possible when the irate citizen rush forward and assist petti bone to set -PRON- leader upright and dust -PRON- off have the law on -PRON- sir rage the colonel break through the crowd that sur round -PRON- and shake -PRON- fist at barney 
threaten -PRON- hey 
egad -PRON- make -PRON- blood l get excited colonel shout barney from the carriage 
excite -PRON- impudent puppy 
excited pet tibone arrest that man surprised that -PRON- stand there without raise a finger against the young scalawag 
the town have only one fault to find with dick pettibone and that be that -PRON- be too easy go too good natured 
there be spartan fibre run through -PRON- makeup but -PRON- be in evidence only on extreme occasion 
oh i wouldnot make -PRON- any trouble col -PRON- friend the enemy onel return pettibone soothingly young -PRON- know and all young man be more or less headstrong a traitor fume the colonel 
if -PRON- hadnot be for -PRON- daughter wouldnot have slip through -PRON- finger think -PRON- would colonel 
no sir rave the colonel 
arrest that young rapscallion or chastise -PRON- here and now 
the colonel begin to roll up -PRON- coat sleeve and barney coolly eye -PRON- make a wry grim ace 
lay the shotgun down on the seat barney attempt to turn the carriage and drive off 
by this time however the word have have an effect on -PRON- follower and two of -PRON- catch the horse head 
pettibone see that there be nothing for -PRON- to do but to act in -PRON- official capacity order barney to get down 
barney obey without any show of resistance and pettibone march off with -PRON- while mr glimmer take the team and carriage back to the livery stable 
during all this time guy have be overlook 
-PRON- remain in the vicinity long enough to note the outcome of the exciting little drama and then slip quietly away to the hotel 
-PRON- be there an hour later deeply engage in a st paul paper when a nervous little gentleman wear a pair of nose glass be lead up to -PRON- by pedro smith 
the key to the situation mr herbert say pedro mr pinchbeck 
mr pinchbeck have recently interest -PRON- in -PRON- little city and -PRON- wish to talk with -PRON- concern the outlook 
guy shake hand with mr pinchbeck and the latter seat -PRON- at the young man side while pedro drift away towards the kitchen understand that -PRON- own nearly all the vacant lot in this town mr herbert observe mr pinchbeck catch -PRON- glass as -PRON- drop from -PRON- nose 
guy nod 
have -PRON- buy here recently -PRON- ask 
quite recently 
very much blockconditionally 
mr pinchbeck catch -PRON- glass again fit -PRON- carefully to the bridge of -PRON- nose and wrinkle -PRON- brow a time or two to satisfy -PRON- that -PRON- would hold be to pay for the block provid e this town win the countyseat fight 
ah i see 
-PRON- money be to be pay back if -PRON- lose hasnot really be pay over as yet 
i have merely a contract for a deed this way mr herbert 
when the ballot be count if -PRON- show a good safe majority for concord i be to pay to the workman who have be bring here to build road bridge etc and i be also to pay for that wooden shell which be ultimately to be the courthouse 
-PRON- friend the enemy this be a revelation to guy 
here be the tenderfoot about whom the colonel have tell -PRON- 
the colonel however have say nothing of a conditional bargain 
in case -PRON- lose the countyseat mr pinch beck say guy what would happen 
mr pinchbeck smile 
the mirthful wrinkle disconnect -PRON- glass and -PRON- evade -PRON- hand and drop into -PRON- lap 
the smile fade into a look of vexation as -PRON- pick up the glass and jam -PRON- back on the bridge of -PRON- nose all right mr herbert 
i have a con tract with vlandingham for a block at the same figure in case -PRON- town win 
guy be startle 
have mr vlandingham also import some voter -PRON- ask donot know as i ought to say so but -PRON- have run in a lot of fellow from bismarck the same number that keever have bring in from jimtown work somewhere around harmony and will be in evidence on elec tion day 
in se harmony win -PRON- be go to pay workman 
be that -PRON- -PRON- 
col keever say -PRON- be a tenderfoot mr pinchbeck but -PRON- certainly do not act like one 
no matter from which direction the breeze come -PRON- have an anchor to windward just plain business that s all return the key to the situation mr pinchbeck dash -PRON- hand to -PRON- face barely in time to keep -PRON- glass there 
be squire vlandingham also build a court house 
i drive over from harmony this morning and see vlandingham before i start get something up -PRON- sleeve 
i hardly know what though 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that fool build court house and wise man occupy -PRON- 
i donot know as i ought to tell -PRON- this be a noncom batant as -PRON- may say but i guess -PRON- wonot do any harm 
vlandingham be a deep one but -PRON- daughter be deep still 
what do -PRON- know about miss vlandingham ask guy with sudden interest 
mr pinchbeck start to answer but have to pause to grab -PRON- glass again 
why donot -PRON- get a cord add guy somewhat testily 
eh 9y tie -PRON- on continued guy point to the glass 
if -PRON- be mine -PRON- would give -PRON- ner vous prostration 
i donot know but -PRON- will anyhow get so mad sometimes admit mr pinch beck that i feel as though i could swear 
-PRON- put the glass in -PRON- pocket 
nearsighte -PRON- know and canot tell a dog from a wildcat across the street be ask what -PRON- know about miss vlandingham say guy 
so -PRON- be 
miss vlandingham mr herbert -PRON- friend the enemy be one of the clever young woman i have ever see 
-PRON- mind be by far the bright of any in the rival town give -PRON- the fight of -PRON- life and incline to think that -PRON- town will win a girl of infinite resource and that episode of this morning clearly illustrate the spectacular way -PRON- have of do thing 
gra cious think of a woman don a disguise and come deliberately into a hotbed of partisanship like this mr pinchbeck seem so overcome by the thought that -PRON- find -PRON- impossible to con tinue for several moment 
-PRON- be a young man without much experience mr herbert -PRON- say finally and like to give -PRON- a word of advice 
will -PRON- accept -PRON- in a kindly spirit 
certainly mr pinchbeck 
what have -PRON- to offer 
amityville be the key to this countyseat situa tion 
one lot of import voter will offset the other and as amityville go so go the election 
do -PRON- catch on think i do 
personally i have little choice between con cord and harmony 
still -PRON- profit if this town be victorious will be slightly great as the block be four lot large 
hence this tip mr herbert 
get a county map and study -PRON- 
mr pinchbeck get up walk over to the cigar case and take out a cigar lay a nickel in the box for such purpose make and provide 
the principle of gain be too firmly work the key to the situation into mr nature for guy to estimate -PRON- very highly as a man but -PRON- have furnish the youth with a good deal of mental pabulum 
every makeshift and design in the rival town appear to cluster about the personality of miss bettymiss betty with -PRON- titian hair and melt e eyesas dauntless as -PRON- be charming as brave as -PRON- be resourceful 
-PRON- have meet col most diplomatic move bring in voter from bismarck to offset those from jamestown 
the contest be assume proportion which make guy extremely doubtful of the result 
miss betty be likely to win the countyseat away from -PRON- and -PRON- heart along with -PRON- 
after an hour of fruitless reflection guy borrow a county map of pedro fortify -PRON- with a good cigar and go up to -PRON- room to consider the question of amityville 
this village be the only other town in goodwill county 
a marginal note on the map inform guy that -PRON- population be only about thirty five 
these thirtyfive be undoubtedly favorable to harmony for amityville lie to the west of that town and consequently nearer to -PRON- than to concord 
in order for harmony to present a peti tion contain the name of twothird of the qualified voter in the county amityville must have sign -PRON- to a man 
here be a good field for effort guy think 
why could -PRON- not go over there and talk to the people 
-PRON- come to a conclusion just as the supper bell rang 
-PRON- be -PRON- friend the enemy thoroughly determine to go to amityville in the course of a few day and try -PRON- hand at elec tioneering 
when -PRON- come out of -PRON- room -PRON- see pettibone sit in the hall beside -PRON- door 
the young man be surprised at the sheriff presence but make no comment 
what do -PRON- do with barney mr petti bone ask guy confine in a room over that -PRON- use as a jail to be do with -PRON- 
judge waffle will have to decide that 
pettibone be most companionable 
-PRON- not only accompany guy downstairs but sit at table with -PRON- during supper follow -PRON- out on the porch for an evening smoke chat with -PRON- until bedtime and then accompany -PRON- up stair again to -PRON- room 
a cot be stand in the hall beside door in place of the chair 
see here pettibone say guy a nice fellow and all that but donot -PRON- think -PRON- be crowd -PRON- pretty close 
well no answer pettibone after a brief period of thought 
what do this mean any way 
the colonel and a lot more didnot like the way -PRON- carry on this morning and -PRON- want -PRON- to lock -PRON- up along with barney 
but i tell -PRON- no 
then -PRON- insist that i should have to watch -PRON- and be responsible for -PRON- if the key to the situation i didnot put -PRON- under lock and key 
i say all right and that s why here a good feller as -PRON- have just be kind enough to say and dead sure -PRON- be another so be go to get along without any friction ainot -PRON- try to laugh guy 
and in the morning continue pettibone go to the circus 
circus echo guy 
what circus petti bone 
well the case of keever vs liscomb be go to be try before judge waffle and if -PRON- donot have a show with all but the ring and the canvas miss -PRON- guess 
guy bid the sheriff goodnight and go into the room and close the door 
the people of -PRON- own town have turn against -PRON- the matter be become interesting and the interest be likely to increase instead diminish of on the following morning shortly before the judicial hour of ten guy and pettibone proceed to the building contain the drug store and ascend to the second story 
here be the court room and likewise the small apartment utilize as a jail 
unlock the door of the latter chamber pettibone request barney to come forth 
the prisoner obey and when -PRON- see guy -PRON- press close to -PRON- and ask in a low tone while the sheriff busy -PRON- relocke the door do -PRON- give -PRON- away 
no replied guy and i will not 
if -PRON- can get clear barney go back to harmony and stay there 
that will be the safe and good thing -PRON- can do 
barney nod as the sheriff join -PRON- and -PRON- start for the courtroom 
as have be state christopher waffle own a threshing outfit 
-PRON- profession be that of an itinerant thresher of grain incidentally as will be remember -PRON- be also justice of the peace 
there be in christopher waffle a certain warmth of originality and sharpness of purpose i -PRON- friend the enemy that have earn -PRON- the sobriquet of hot waffle 
but christopher waffle care not for public opinion good or ill 
-PRON- make -PRON- -PRON- ex clusive aim to please waffle and thus be always sure of be on good term with -PRON- whatever may be the state of -PRON- feeling toward the rest of mankind 
when guy barney and pettibone enter the room the judge have not yet arrive 
col keever be there however -PRON- white hat severely set upon -PRON- ample browsmute testimony of -PRON- mental condition 
there also be lem bilkin twist about a chair in close proximity to the colonel and watch -PRON- every movement with an admiration that be almost soulful 
glimmer be glimmer have agree to look after the emporium during -PRON- absenceand pinney the druggist and leffingwell proprietor of the livery stable and sampson and mr barberry who be suppose to be a lawyer and who pos sesse a painfully meagre form a hatchet face have an impediment in -PRON- speech and have be retain by the defense 
other be present but none especially noteworthy 
the buzz of conver sation cease abruptly upon the coming of the sheriff with -PRON- prisonersfor -PRON- be plain that guy be consider in the light of a malefactor spare the odium of imprisonment merely because of pettibone and upon the latter responsibility 
frigid look be direct at guy by every one exceptstrange as -PRON- may appearthe redoubt keever versus liscomb io3 able colonel 
the manager of the townsite com pany have sleep upon the incident of the precede afternoon and have come to the conclusion that -PRON- have be somewhat hasty with guy 
solely by grace of the young man -PRON- be direct the affair of the town 
the office be no sinecure but if concord win in the contest -PRON- paper would boom and -PRON- nest would be feather in other way 
for these reason the glance -PRON- shoot in direction be of the sorrowful and injure butforgiving kind 
a chair a table a glass and a broken water pitcher be await the judge who finally ar rive 
-PRON- be clothe in overall carelessly tuck into -PRON- boottop be in -PRON- shirt sleeve and carry an oil can in one hand and a bunch of waste in the other 
bill comfort bear a large book be close at -PRON- employer heel 
-PRON- look as though -PRON- people never would get through lawin growl the judge

at this point -PRON- honor exchange -PRON- oil can and bunch of waste for the book 
sit down bill -PRON- command and the engi neer tip lem bilkin out of -PRON- chair and seat -PRON- 
now continue the judge lay the book down on the table and throw -PRON- into -PRON- seat be busy yesterday afternoon and donot -PRON- friend the enemy know what this be all about body

-PRON- can have -PRON- choice between be lock up while i be go or go with -PRON- go with -PRON- pettibone sensible 
-PRON- may have a little fun inci dentally 
read that 
the sheriff fish a fold paper out of -PRON- pocket and guy open the sheet and read as follow concord june mr richard pettibone sheriff of goodwill county concord dear sir one who cherish the law as the dear of -PRON- country institution and who have become aware of a terrible crime about to be commit come to -PRON- with these present assert that challenge and acceptance to fight a duel have pass between two of the most worthy people of goodwill county 
challenge be issue from the editorial office of the norther and ac cepte in the sanctum of the be -PRON- state in direct violation of paragraph chapter penal code of this territory 
this affair of honor unless thwart by exercise of -PRON- authority will take place at oclock in dilemma the afternoon of wednesday june on the north shore of lake elizabeth 
if -PRON- have a decent regard for the peace and wellbeing of this community let -PRON- supplicate -PRON- forthwith to take such step as may seem advisable for avert an impending catastrophe 
proceed to the scene of this intend crime and resort to force if necessary in overturn the sanguinary plan of the duellist 
this state plainly enough that the two col onel be the principal in the affair say guy 
the fact of this propose duel be no news to -PRON- however as i already have knowledge of -PRON- from col keever -PRON- 
who be this pro bono publico i wonder 
-PRON- wonder eh return pettibone with another of -PRON- wink -PRON- know that there be only one man in this town who could or would write a letter of that kind 
who be that 
hold that letter close to -PRON- nose and get a good whiff of -PRON- ink say guy 
right -PRON- be the kind of printer ink -PRON- use on the blizzard 
-PRON- donot mean to say that col keever write this letter -PRON- 
yes i do 
why -PRON- s simply furious and vow that hell have life 
by this time -PRON- be at the lisbon house and i -PRON- friend the enemy pettibone with one hand on the veranda railing throw back -PRON- head and laugh boisterously 
keever be play to the gallery say -PRON- the slick hand at makebelieve that i ever know and know a good many 
-PRON- hasnot any more thought of fight a duel than i have but hell act as bloodthirsty as a savage -PRON- see that if i go out to lake elizabeth and interfere by force to prevent the duel hell come out of the scrape in high feather 
the rank and file of this town have never drop a plum meet to the bottom of the nature but chris waffle have and so have that s sure go out there to stop -PRON- be -PRON- go out there but not to stop -PRON- an swered pettibone fold the letter which guy have hand back to -PRON- and replace -PRON- in -PRON- pocket go out there to hide in the brush and look on 
-PRON- word for -PRON- mr herbert -PRON- will stop -PRON- seethe north shore of lake eliza beth at oclock wednesday afternoon 
if -PRON- will promise not to take french leave run over to the house and tell -PRON- boy alec to hitch up and drive around here about oclock worry about -PRON- pettibone answer guy shanot leave this town until the county seat contest be decide one way or the other 
i have too much at stake 
all right then 
i wonot be go more than half an hour 
thereupon the sheriff stride off down the street dilemma i i and guy go up on the veranda and seat -PRON- self 
at that hour pedro smith be in the kitchen oversee the preparation for dinner 
guy be alone in that quarter and -PRON- remove the pink envelope very gently from -PRON- pocket and open -PRON- and draw forth the perfumed sheet 
-PRON- be really from miss betty and -PRON- heart beat faster than usual as -PRON- read the dainty writing 
dear friend there be a matter of grave -PRON- be portance which i wish to discuss with -PRON- 
as i can not come to concord and -PRON- can not come to harmony may i ask -PRON- to meet -PRON- at some neutral point tomorrow wednesday afternoon at oclock 
there be a pretty little lake which be name after -PRON- and which lie equally distant be tween the two elizabeth 
please meet -PRON- there 
-PRON- very truly pinkney will accompany -PRON- but i shall expect -PRON- to come alone 
the joy which guy feel over this propose meet e with miss betty be lose in the consternation which suddenly seize upon -PRON- 
by what strange coincidence have -PRON- appoint for -PRON- meeting the very place day and hour fix upon by the duellist for -PRON- affair of honor 
and how be -PRON- to go alone when -PRON- have already agree to go with the sheriff 
anyhow how could -PRON- go alone any place 
guy be in despair 
-PRON- do not see how -PRON- could possibly engineer affair so as to prevent i -PRON- friend the enemy miss betty from get the idea that -PRON- be twoface and have betray to the sheriff the con tent of -PRON- letter 
here be a dilemma of gigantic proportion and how be -PRON- to get around -PRON- 
guy have an idea that -PRON- may telegraph miss vlandingham -PRON- would be at lake elizabeth at oclock but that through circumstance over which -PRON- have no control the sheriff would ac company -PRON- 
a little reflection convince -PRON- that -PRON- would not be well to send a message of this kind so instead of that -PRON- send the follow ing please appoint another day same place 
this be tantamount to say that -PRON- would not be able to meet miss betty at the rendezvous and guy highly pleased with the way -PRON- have get around the difficulty return from the telegraph office to the hotel 
unfortunately -PRON- do not observe that col keever be in the freight department of the depot where -PRON- have come to find out whether the patent outside for the next issue of the blizzard have yet arrive 
un see the colonel overheard the young man colloquy with the operator 
what the great man do after that will soon appear 
pettibone join guy at dinner 
after the meal -PRON- smoke -PRON- cigar and chat in friendly i -PRON- friend the enemy fashion until oclock when young alec drive a highstepper and a cover buggy up to the hotel veranda 
guy and the sheriff immediately get into the vehicle and drive off leave young alec stare wistfully after -PRON- 
very soon the traveller be out of town and roll rapidly along the level road which wear deeply into the turf be almost as hard and smooth as asphalt 
the sun have half descend the western sky a few vaporous cloud float overhead and a balmy wind blow from the north west and languidly ripple the grass and the flower 
the whistle of a robin and the plaintive note of a meadow lark thrill through the scene give a touch of melody to a day already per fect 
this be something like living remark guy again and again fill -PRON- lung to -PRON- full capacity with the warm sweet air what assent pettibone 
if a man be only out in these part for -PRON- health what a time -PRON- could have god make the country -PRON- say and man make the town lovely until civilized people come along tickle the soil with a plow and make -PRON- laugh wheat and oats and then the trouble begin 
seem like the more nature smile and show -PRON- good feeling the more unsociable people become 
now look there the sheriff wave -PRON- hand towards the stretch of prairie dot with square of grow grain each square push the shack of -PRON- owner as far an affair of honor i towards -PRON- limit as -PRON- ever see anything purti 
but there s a heart in every one of those shack mr herbert that s bitter as gall over this countyseat question 
and if -PRON- wasnot that -PRON- would be something else 
i tell -PRON- a human bein have get to have a grievance to nurse or fondle or tuck away or put up on a pole and howl about or -PRON- wonot be content right 
why be the farmer so deeply interested in the countyseat fight 
most of -PRON- have a lot or two in town so -PRON- a pocketbook affair with -PRON- 
those that havenot any lot just take side in order to have some thing to quarrel about 
the farmer that live nearest to concord be a concord man and the one close to harmony be for that town tooth and nail 
sile -PRON- house way over yender -PRON- can see -PRON- just over the lash of -PRON- whip nowwell when -PRON- first build -PRON- claim shanty -PRON- be right square between the two town not a foot farther from concord than -PRON- be from harmony 
for a long time sile didnot know what to do for a grievance and -PRON- worry -PRON- so that -PRON- hitch -PRON- team to -PRON- shack one night and pull -PRON- over onto the northeast corner of -PRON- hundred and sixty 
that bring -PRON- near concord see 
when the countyseat be locate in concord and thing get fairly quiet there -PRON- be blue as a whetstone till -PRON- haul -PRON- shack across to the southw corner of the quarter and i -PRON- friend the enemy that make a harmony man out of -PRON- 
just now -PRON- donot make any difference which side of -PRON- farm -PRON- s on 
sile can be in hot water all the time so -PRON- s just about as comfortable in the spirit as any man can be and live 
and that s the way -PRON- go 
dick pettibone be full of anecdote and reminis cence and sage reflection on life and the half hour which -PRON- require for the highstepper to trot -PRON- to -PRON- destination be while away most agreeably 
lake elizabeth be a small but beautiful ex panse of water shimmer like a diamond against the green of the plain 
on all side the bank have a gentle slope and there be wide reach of white sand skirt the water edge 
to the north be two small grove of cotton wood stand kneedeep in a dense undergrowth half an hour ahead of time say petti bone and consequently be first on the ground 
suppose -PRON- make -PRON- comfortable among those cottonwood where -PRON- canot be see and await development 
thus speak -PRON- head -PRON- horse toward the more southerly of the two grove 
in a little time the horse and buggy have be hide in the brushy tangle and the sheriff and guy have hit upon a point of vantage from which entirely un observe -PRON- could see the north shore of the lake in -PRON- full extent 
-PRON- have no more than settle -PRON- com an affair of honor fortably when a fall of hoof reach -PRON- ear and -PRON- see near the crest of the slope shore two horseman descend at a gallop toward the other grove 
by cracky mutter pettibone 
if there ainot old man glimmer and lem bilkin a feejee now what the dicken be -PRON- here for 
tell -PRON- that somebody and be oblige 
look at that go into hiding in the other grove 
well be dinge bilkin and glimmer disappear in the brush and among the tree to the north and all be outwardly as calm and serene as before 
the next arrival be col dingle and capt blue who drive a redwheele gig over the rise and down to a sentinel cottonwood that stand apart 
the captain and the colonel be joke and laugh and one would have imagine that a duel be as ordinary a matter with -PRON- as col keever have inform guy -PRON- have once be with -PRON- 
capt blue hitch the horse to a tree and as -PRON- finish and turn away col keever and samp son drive merrily upon the scene 
the editor of the blizzard be smoke a cigar and -PRON- extreme nonchalance be the most noticeable thing about -PRON- 
good afternoon gentleman -PRON- call courte ously to those already on the field 
col dingle and capt blue nod distantly and col keever shrug -PRON- fat shoulder i -PRON- friend the enemy chuckle cynically and get down from the buggy 
grope around under the seat -PRON- succeed in fiinde and in draw into sight a large revolver 
face about -PRON- press a spring pull down the barrel and give a businesslike glance at the cartridge in the cylinder 
this do -PRON- snap the revolver together knock the ashe from -PRON- cigar with the muzzle and swagger over in the direction of -PRON- opponent 
well say dingle sharply if -PRON- be ready pace off the distance and let -PRON- get this affair over with first flip a quarter for choice of posi tion return keever give a side glance at the sun 
the last time i figure in an affair of this kindwa -PRON- the last now or the next to the lastwell anyway i fight with the sun in -PRON- eye and only pink -PRON- man 
still -PRON- reminiscence be very interesting but i think -PRON- can dispense with -PRON- cut in capt blue take a quarter out of -PRON- pocket 
once for all col keever 
what be -PRON- 
the coin twirl in the air 
head cry keever and win the toss 
take up -PRON- position with -PRON- back to the west -PRON- motion to sampson 
the printer come at once leave the horse un hitch 
although the horse be know to be gentle -PRON- be a foolish thing for sampson to leave -PRON- in this way 
sampson pace off twenty step with capt an affair of honor i blue command keever 
if -PRON- would rather make -PRON- ten dingle agreeable 
five l cry the little colonel 
would -PRON- like to have -PRON- tie a handkerchief over one of -PRON- eye ask col keever with exasperate condescension dislike to take any advantage of -PRON- -PRON- be disturb flare dingle hotly 
when -PRON- come to pistol practice -PRON- one eye be as good as -PRON- two eye any day 
calm -PRON- dingle or -PRON- aim will be bad 
sampson see that i get five pacesor less 
five very short pace be stump off by the captain who punctuate the distance by drive -PRON- wooden leg into the sand at both posi tion 
all right colonel sing out sampson and the principal be soon back to back weapon in hand await the fall of capt cap which be to be the signal to turn and fire 
from -PRON- place of concealment in the brush guy and pettibone be listen to the conversa tion and watch the sanguinary preparation with intense interest 
be -PRON- to be a tragedy after all instead of a farce 
guy be begin to grow nervous better go out and stop this before -PRON- too late -PRON- say excitedly kill each other to pettibone -PRON- believe -PRON- return the sheriff con fidently 
hear that i this be where bilkin and -PRON- friend the enemy glimmer take a hand and warrant keever put -PRON- up to -PRON- 
bilkin and glimmer have suddenly leap from the other patch of timber and guy and the sheriff see -PRON- bind over the intervene space and hurl -PRON- upon col keever 
sampson have also seize -PRON- employer and the three be strug gle with -PRON- in great desperation 
capt blue take a pipe from one pocket a handful of tobacco from another and fill the pipebowl calmly and methodically while watch apparently desperate attempt to free -PRON- 
stand off shout dingle 
break away from that scoundrel or open fire on -PRON- all no attention be pay to -PRON- 
go for the whole lot dingle advise the captain apply a match to -PRON- pipe and puff out little cloud of white vapor 
crack l come a shot from the little revolver 
the bullet plump into the ground at the foot of the struggle quartet throw a spurt of sand into the air 
at this ominous sound the four concordian separate and begin to run 
the report also frighten the horse attach to the buggy and the animal take to a wild gallop and vanish over the swell in a twink ling 
crack crack crack volley the little revolver and faster and faster flee the an affair of honor concordian the gallant keever despite -PRON- avoirdupois keeping well in the lead 
dingle give chase and continue to follow until -PRON- weapon be empty and -PRON- foe out of sight then -PRON- return shake hand with capt blue and -PRON- unhitch -PRON- horse climb into the redwheele gig and drive unconcernedly away 
pettibone be roll on the ground kick -PRON- heel and choke with tumultuous mirth 
guy share the sheriff enjoyment with the same ap preciation if not the same abandon but the laughter die suddenly upon -PRON- lip 
-PRON- have chance to look out over the sandy shore of the lake and the vision that meet -PRON- gaze have hush -PRON- merriment 
after -PRON- have turn away to rub -PRON- eye -PRON- look again

as for guy -PRON- be stricken dumb in -PRON- track 
-PRON- could say nothing do stand where -PRON- be and watch the carriage disappear on one hand and the shouting and angry trio advance on the other 
what untimely fate have bring bilkin and glimmer to the sheriff rescue and make possible this awful finale 
guy be soon to know 
as -PRON- draw close to guy bilkin glimmer and pettibone separate surround -PRON- and press cautiously in from three point of the compass 
when within a dozen foot of the young man the sheriff throw up -PRON- right hand 
this be a pre arranged signal for the attack force to halt for a parley 
if -PRON- try to resist -PRON- herbert say petti bone menacingly be mighty sorry for -PRON- before -PRON- get through a good feller as i say but even a good feller be generally able to tell when -PRON- s get enough 
where do bilkin and glimmer come from inquired guy 
-PRON- circle around back to get -PRON- horse speak up glimmer 
-PRON- didnot know but those two harmony chap may still be here admit bilkin artlessly so -PRON- do -PRON- circlin toth side the swell and out of sight

the runnin yet 
i 4o -PRON- friend the enemy if i didnot know the colonel so well say glimmer should think -PRON- be a coward 
but a man who see so much slaughter in -PRON- late war couldnot be that 
i wasnot afraid glare through -PRON- ironrimmed glassesand i just run after the colonel to see if i couldnot persuade -PRON- to come back 
-PRON- shake -PRON- fist in the direction of harmony 
if i ever meet that blue alone but word prove powerless and -PRON- finish with an ominous frown and shake of the head 
oh yes commented pettibone sarcastically if -PRON- ever get at blue i suppose there wonot be anything leave but splinter 
will -PRON- surrender herbert or have -PRON- get to close in on -PRON- have a half notion to close in on -PRON- re turn guy irritably make a pretty mess of this those lady be positive now that i have the three of -PRON- lie in ambush donot care what -PRON- think answer the sheriff probably be lie over there yet if bilkin and glimmer hadnot pass near enough to hear -PRON- call to -PRON- have to be lock up after this

because i have submit peaceably to -PRON- surveillance that be no sign i do not know -PRON- right break no law and if -PRON- try any highhanded measure make this county too hot to hold -PRON- fellow 
if the indictment i necessary have a company of soldier here to protect -PRON- 
the harmony invincible i suppose sneer pettibone

pettibone rub the back of -PRON- head as -PRON- say this and assume such an injured air that guy have to laugh in spite of -PRON- vexation 
lem bilkin once more glimmer unbent -PRON- so far as to smile and pettibone who always have a laugh lurk somewhere close to the surface be catch in the general hilar ity 
anyway qualify the sheriff there ainot go to be much fun in this for -PRON- herbert

what say that that brand new courthouse be go slick and clean 
as the colonel be inside of -PRON- the indictment guard the record and be nowhere in evidence this morning the surmise be that -PRON- be steal along with the courthouse and the paper 
gee whittaker do -PRON- ever hear anything to beat -PRON- -PRON- joke waffle ask guy whose credulity be sorely tax by the state ment 
this be altogether too serious a matter to joke about 
concord can spare keever just as well as not but -PRON- a big loss to have the record and the courthouse steal 
i guess well have to tally one for harmony this innings 
this explain what vlandingham say to pinchbeck say guy reflectively 
what be that 
why that fool build courthouse and wise man occupy -PRON- about what -PRON- amount to 
harmony have the laugh on -PRON- now and if -PRON- run this thing to earth bet -PRON- find daughter at the other end of -PRON- the only one in harmony who d be able to hatch up such a scheme 
guy remember how -PRON- have see miss betty in the courthouse a tape line in -PRON- hand jot down something in a notebook 
-PRON- flash over -PRON- at that moment that -PRON- have be take i i -PRON- friend the enemy measurement with the view of consummate this coup 
how be -PRON- do judge query guy 
easy enough 
the harmony folk manufac ture a pair of long axle and swing each one between a couple of low broadtire wheel 
there be a storm last night if -PRON- remember and that be exactly what the other side want 
the noise of the thunder and the wind and the rain drown out the commotion -PRON- make so that no one in this town hear themunless -PRON- be keever and -PRON- very soon take care of -PRON- guarantee 
after -PRON- have lift the court house with jackscrew -PRON- slide the wheel under -PRON- front and rear and then hitch several team of horse to -PRON- and haul -PRON- away 
-PRON- can see the track of the wheel where -PRON- sink into the wet ground 
pettibone and several more armed to the tooth have start along the south trail at a gallop 
but -PRON- will have -PRON- trouble for -PRON- pain mark -PRON- a notice that be leave stick on a post near the courthouse site and -PRON- what i call add insult to injury with a vengeance 
the judge take from -PRON- pocket very carefully a wet and bedraggle scrap of paper on which be write the following to the people of concord greeting -PRON- need a courthouse to go with the weathervane so -PRON- think -PRON- would take yours 
now if -PRON- will please i the first victim build -PRON- a coal shed to go with the courthouse -PRON- will greatly oblige the people of harmony that for a blow between the rib ask waffle as -PRON- return the paper to -PRON- pocket a terrible setback say guy 
notwith stand the financial peril with which this success of the opposition threaten -PRON- the humor of the situation appeal to the young man and -PRON- sit down on the cot and laugh till -PRON- choke 
if -PRON- donot look out for those fellow waffle -PRON- observe finally come over here and steal the town 
i wish some one would go -PRON- bail so i could get out and do a little look around come to let -PRON- out on -PRON- own recog nizance herbert that do -PRON- on -PRON- own responsibility 
-PRON- see i tell the indignation committee that if -PRON- keep -PRON- a prisoner -PRON- would have to bring -PRON- up for trial 
after the way i throw the law into lis comb -PRON- be afraid to have -PRON- try -PRON- case and so -PRON- say -PRON- would keep -PRON- a prisoner until after the election 
that isnot the law the way i read -PRON- and as pettibone be chase after the courthouse and as get a key to this room i think this would be a good time to let -PRON- scamper 
the people have get -PRON- head so full of other thing -PRON- wonot be able to think of -PRON- -PRON- friend the enemy for a while and advise -PRON- to go some place jimtown or bismarck or anywhere else -PRON- want toand stay for a few day until the suspicion and hard feeling against -PRON- have a chance to blow over do -PRON- say guy and shake hand gratefully

thank remember the name 
guy follow the judge from the room down the stair and out into the street 
the wild clangor of the bell have cease and the excited shouting the grind of carriage and wagon wheel and the fierce tattoo of hoof have give place to a church yard quiet 
there be many people on the street but -PRON- hat be pull moodily down over -PRON- brow and -PRON- converse with one another in hush tone 
the stunning effect of the calamity have set in

leffingwell have immediately hire -PRON- and put -PRON- to work

i donot think -PRON- can have that horse cry the hostler who be familiar with name if not with -PRON- face 
but guy be well away by this time and give no heed to summon 
there be two road lead to amityville 
the short road parallel the railroad track and lead directly through harmony 
in order to follow this route -PRON- would have be necessary for guy to traverse the main street of concord and bear west from the depot 
-PRON- do not care to do this or to run the risk of be halt in har mony so -PRON- debouch southward along the other road and amble toward amityville by way of lake elizabeth 
this latter course have be the one take by the man who have spirit away the courthouse and guy see stretch out before -PRON- the broad deep wheelmark of the gigantic truck which have be improvise by the harmonyite 
when near lake elizabeth -PRON- suddenly glimpse half a dozen horseman gallop rapidly towards -PRON- 
-PRON- be too late to beat a retreat or to gain unnoticed the friendly shelter of the tree on the bank of the lake 
-PRON- have be so deep in -PRON- thought that the horseman be within a short the first victim i quarter of a mile of -PRON- before -PRON- discover -PRON- approach 
-PRON- be soon able to distinguish pettibone and pinney and leffingwell but the remain three be unknown to -PRON- 
drawing rein -PRON- quietly wait 
thunder shout the sheriff herbert 
the next moment guy be surround by six angry and baffled man 
well gentleman say guy -PRON- eye twinkling do -PRON- find the courthouse 
-PRON- be blame return pettibone sourly 
how do -PRON- get out 
that doesnot matter pettibone out and that s enough 
as -PRON- gentleman appear to be in anything but an agreeable frame of mind kindly ride out of -PRON- way and let -PRON- pass on 
not much cry pinney escape and -PRON- have get to go back with -PRON- the ticket say leffingwell glance sharply at the horse guy be ride 
the three other whom guy do not know be equally as positive that -PRON- should go back to concord 
pettibone knot -PRON- brow over the problem but say nothing 
-PRON- horse stand di rectly in front of and as -PRON- reflect -PRON- snap -PRON- quirt absently against -PRON- bootleg 
hear -PRON- a minute gentleman say guy donot want to have a clash and sure every thing will be pleasant between -PRON- if -PRON- will only be reasonable 
yesterday i be give -PRON- choice 16o -PRON- friend the enemy either of leave town or be lock up 
i didnot care to leave town then but willing to do so now 
why do -PRON- want to stop -PRON- 
yesterday -PRON- have the courthouse blurt out leffingwell and today the other people have get -PRON- 
that make all the difference in the world assist the other people and i suppose -PRON- want to go over there and help -PRON- cele brate for one am in favor of take -PRON- back to concord and treat -PRON- as -PRON- deserve 
so be seconded pinney 
the rest be of the same mind even the sheriff join in with -PRON- 
as pettibone voice -PRON- agreement with -PRON- com panion -PRON- flash guy a meaning glance and the quirt fly awkwardly from -PRON- hand 
dismount e the sheriff lead -PRON- horse aside and bent to pick up the whip 
this make a breach in the cordon that sur round the young man and leave the road for the moment clear before -PRON- 
in a trice -PRON- inter prete look and dig -PRON- heel into -PRON- horse side 
the animal spring away like a shaft from a bow 
stop roar pinney but -PRON- may as well have order the wind to cease blow 
stop or shoot shout leffingwell draw e a revolver from -PRON- pocket and sight -PRON- quickly 
still guy do not halt and pettibone knock the liveryman arm downward before -PRON- could fire 
the first victim i none of that leffingwell cry the sheriff 
chase after -PRON- that s the thing to do 
thereupon the six of -PRON- have recourse to -PRON- spur and quirt 
the horse of the pursuer have see hard ser vice that morning and be at a disadvantage mount on the contrary be comparatively fresh and -PRON- could see by the hasty glance which -PRON- occasionally throw over -PRON- shoulder that -PRON- be slowly increase the distance that separate -PRON- from those behind 
there be a point where the road fork one branch lead on to amityville and the other turn sharply in the direction of harmony 
pursue and pursuer be draw close to this point attention be take up by those behind and pettibone and -PRON- companion have eye for no one but the young man in front 
thus -PRON- happen that a large contingent of mount man spur swiftly along the harmony road fail to capture the notice of those on the other trail 
realization be bring suddenly home to the concordian by a terrific yell from the har monyite 
pettibone and -PRON- friend draw rein panicstricken and whirl to flee 
capt blue be come at the head of -PRON- in vincible a score at least and the sun shimmer upon the polished gun barrel that lie across -PRON- saddle 
guy be between two fire 
as -PRON- make little -PRON- friend the enemy difference to -PRON- which way -PRON- go -PRON- keep straight on 
-PRON- see several of the invincible raise -PRON- gun to -PRON- shoulder 
instantly -PRON- throw up -PRON- hand shoot -PRON- cry think the weapon be aim at -PRON- unarmed at that precise juncture a report come from be hind -PRON- and a bullet sing past -PRON- ear 
-PRON- turn in -PRON- saddle to launch a threat and a warning at pettibone and -PRON- man and just as -PRON- do so a spiteful volley leap from the muzzle of the level gun ahead 
guy feel a sharp sting in -PRON- side as though a knifepoint have prick -PRON- 
stop shoot -PRON- cry again and the quiv ere impotence of -PRON- voice amaze -PRON- 
stop shoot or -PRON- will kill somebody -PRON- have in tend to make the shout a lusty one but -PRON- be scarcely more than a whisper 
everything in -PRON- line of vision begin to reel 
the horseman in front become tangle in a maze 
-PRON- raise -PRON- in -PRON- stirrup press both hand over the burn spot in -PRON- side and then pitch head foremost from -PRON- saddle 
on the night col keever guard the county record -PRON- take with -PRON- into the courthouse a winchester rifle and a pint flask 
kentucky bear and breed -PRON- be to be presume that -PRON- be as familiar with one of these weapon as -PRON- be with the other 
be that as -PRON- may however -PRON- be cer tain that -PRON- fortify -PRON- courage to such an ex tent that -PRON- sleep soundly throughout all the operation connect with the moving of the building 
so level be the road lead from the court house site in concord to the vacant square in harmony and so skilfully do the enemy work that col keever if -PRON- realize anything at all could only think that the storm be most furious and that this halffinishe structure be sadly in need of underpin 
a picture -PRON- present to capt blue and -PRON- invincible who do the work connect with the moving 
in the light of an occasional lightning flash the colonel could be view at leisure by any one who wish to walk along beside the solitary window and peer into the -PRON- friend the enemy single unfinished room which the building con taine 
the great man be lie upon a cot in such a way as to reveal the noble proportion of -PRON- platonic brow 
under the cot be the tin box contain the precious record and close beside the cot lie the empty flask

the melancholy gaze -PRON- vouchsafe the empty flask change to a look of pride as -PRON- eye take in the box of record all intact 
-PRON- would have take an army corps to separate -PRON- from those document 
suddenly a startling thought dart through -PRON- brain and -PRON- jerk spasmodically and blink in -PRON- bewilderment 
then -PRON- lie quite still think 
what business have the morning sun shine through a western window 
the court house at the present stage have only one glaze opening and nothing but a blank wall on -PRON- eastern side

be this a hideous dream or be -PRON- reality 
dingle remain at the window but speak no word 
all -PRON- do be to grin in a sarcastic way and draw the lid partly down over -PRON- glass eye 
that halfwink break the spell 
with a roar the colonel rush to the cot and catch up the winchester

keever spring to the door 
the key have be remove from the inside of the lock and the door do not respond to -PRON- furious pull 
-PRON- hurl -PRON- upon -PRON- and struggle like a demon 
so furious be the onslaught that the knob come away and the great man be precipitate to the floor 
a laugh float in from the window

guy thought of this gloomily for naturally -PRON- could not know how absorbed miss betty have become in the plan -PRON- have suddenly evolve and which -PRON- be go to talk over with -PRON- father 
this plan have to do with the policy of reconciliation and with the re lease of col keever 
the latter as miss betty be plan the matter should be release and present with an olive branch for delivery to the people of concord 
guy hear the hoofbeat of the horse die sod denly away in the distance and -PRON- imagine that even so be miss betty pass out of -PRON- life

why say -PRON- get about twelve hundred lot in concord mr landy 
so tell respond the unruffled landy 
but the hull twelve hundred wonot be worth three harmony lot after the election donot think i can accept -PRON- offer even if i -PRON- friend the enemy that be a fair statement of the case 
just then guy have a bright thought 
there be thirty five voter in amityville landy -PRON- ask arenot there mr fifteen correct landy and i carry every vote in -PRON- pocket

guy lean back in -PRON- chair and look at landy sympathetically 
vlandingham have pull the wool over -PRON- eye abe chuckle whittaker make due note of -PRON- cousin long face 
-PRON- doesnot look as though -PRON- have treat -PRON- just right do -PRON- now mumble landy

when vlan dingham get ready to have -PRON- petition to the county commissioner sign -PRON- hand -PRON- a due bill for six lot together with fourteen other due bill for two lot each for the rest of the voter in amityville 
all -PRON- do be to slap -PRON- on the back and call -PRON- abe and say how much -PRON- think of -PRON- 
gosh 
and to think that -PRON- be make game of -PRON- all the time 
-PRON- be too bad mr landy rejoin guy 
for some time -PRON- have be furtively take mr measure and -PRON- be now ready to lay on the finish stroke of a hastily evolve plan 
if amityville vote for concord -PRON- go on almost a certainty that concord will win 
when -PRON- be once settle that concord have the countyseat hard and fast the town will boom -PRON- friend the enemy i 9o and lot will sell like hot cake 
as i tell -PRON- i have over twelve hundred good lot and i wouldnot object to give thirtyfour due bill for two lot each to every man woman and child in amityville except abraham landy 
as for mr landy i would ask -PRON- to distribute the thirtyfour due bill and then if -PRON- would promise to return a solid vote for concord i would give -PRON- a thirtyfifth due bill for fifty lot two full block do that would -PRON- explode landy leap from -PRON- chair would answer guy and i would con sider that mr landy have do -PRON- a favor 
mr landy clasp -PRON- hand behind -PRON- and walk around the house -PRON- eye turn ground ward hook -PRON- mutter the delighted whittaker

while -PRON- be engage in give away lot guy do not forget to present whittaker with half a dozen thereupon that gentleman solemnly covenant that -PRON- house should remain forever upon the concord side of -PRON- farm 
this deal consummate guy go in and lay mr landy of amityville i down 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- have do a good stroke of work for concord 
-PRON- conscience trouble -PRON- somewhat for there be a hint of sharp practice in -PRON- deal with landy that be directly oppose to the young man inclination and general character 
still if vlandingham have buy ami tyville signature to -PRON- petition why should not guy buy amityville vote 
the ballot of the two set of import voter each just a score in number would nullify each other 
now that ami tyville be to go for concord the success of concord seem certain 
the first flush of assure victory over guy be gan to feel sorry for miss betty 
-PRON- be bend every effort towards win a victory for har mony and be so confident of the result that hewell -PRON- almost regret that -PRON- have allow -PRON- self to purchase mr influence

after grin ne slyly -PRON- vanish as quickly as -PRON- have ap peare lady murmur guy in trepidation

as -PRON- arise -PRON- glance through a win dow and see miss pinkney seat in a gorgeous trap and hold a horse 
the next moment -PRON- see whittaker approach the trap stand beside -PRON- and engage miss pinkney in conversation 
the young man heart flutter

-PRON- raise the gloved hand to -PRON- lip 
again the scarlet fly to -PRON- cheek and -PRON- turn and flee from the house 
the election be to be hold on tuesday and the monday precede have be fraught with matter of grave concern for col keever 
the most mo mentous of these matter be the strike of samp son for back pay and high wage the most momentous because like the newly start snow ball the incident grow amazingly in importance until -PRON- end in the disgrace -PRON- ban ishment from the town and the wrecking of the blizzard 
to begin with the blizzard have never be much of a financial success 
-PRON- be a paper of johnsonian excellence that be to say so ponder ous in -PRON- utterance that -PRON- have to be read with a one elbow 
the little fish talk like whale on every line and through every column 
in a community necessarily defi cient in -PRON- supply of webster the blizzard be venerate and fear because of -PRON- evident learn e 
for the same reason but few subscribed for -PRON- and so small be the subscription list at the time the unfeele sampson go on strike and -PRON- friend the enemy so meagre be the advertising patronage that the colonel have barely two dollar that -PRON- could call -PRON- own 
in -PRON- extremity -PRON- bewail the reckless impulse which have lead -PRON- to pay hepburn the discharge section hand from harmony twenty dollar for information which have prove of no value 
the great man dream of that twentydollar bill in -PRON- sleep and would clutch at -PRON- so fiercely that -PRON- would awakeawake to realize that -PRON- be go forever 
-PRON- printing plant have cost -PRON- five hundred dollar and -PRON- have pay all but four hundred and fifty dollar of that debt 
-PRON- have no lot in concord and if guy have demand a settlement -PRON- would have be find that there be fifty or more which could not be account for 
that very monday pedro smith have press the col onel for a board bill long past due the news company have send -PRON- patent outside by ex press cover certain arrearagesand the bundle be still in the express office while the form wait in vain on the army press 
what be the colonel to do 
rack with all these worry -PRON- have enter -PRON- office only to be confront by sampson who demand money and declare -PRON- would stop work if -PRON- didnot get -PRON- 
this be the last straw 
the patience give way and hot word be pass between -PRON- and -PRON- printer 
and thenwell -PRON- strike samp four gentleman from harmony son with -PRON- cane and sampson hit -PRON- with a chair and throw -PRON- into one corner and shake a fist in -PRON- face and vow revenge rrrevenge 
after that sampson go away in high dudgeon and the colonel pick -PRON- up limp to -PRON- office chair and sit there for a long long time bitterly reflect 
the sun go down the shad ows of evening fall and still the acute mind have find no loophole for escape from -PRON- present difficulty 
-PRON- be at this juncture that four gentleman from harmony all of serious aspect and wear black slouch hat ascend the unsteady stair that lead to the office of the blizzard 
and one be very tall and one have a glass eye and the third stump through life on a wooden pin and the fourth carry an empty sleeve 
business call -PRON- to concord and illfortune have prepare the colonel to greet -PRON- in receptive mood 
the committee of way and way and questionable meanscame at night as befit doer of ignoble deed 
-PRON- twoseate carriage and team be leave at the edge of town and -PRON- be unseen by any save sampson 
-PRON- still car rie a key to the workroom and as -PRON- enter by the front -PRON- enter at the rear 
col keever cherish no illfeeling and wel come -PRON- caller cordially and humorously 
should -PRON- put -PRON- name down for a year sub scription to -PRON- invaluable paper twofifty a year in advance 
-PRON- friend the enemy no the four gentleman from harmony have not call for any such purpose 
indeed 
while -PRON- four caller be unfortunate in so far as -PRON- reside in a town with such a poor outlook as harmony yet lack of taste be not a crime and col keever be glad to extend the right hand of fellowship to col dingle maj 
harp capt blue and mr boomer 
col dingle maj 
harp capt blue and mr boomer gratefully acknowledge col amicable sentiment and beg to assure -PRON- of -PRON- own couple with a slight offering in the way of liquid refreshment 
this preliminary matter arrange to the voluble satisfaction of all party col dingle ask to know if -PRON- be alone 
col keever tell -PRON- that -PRON- could not be more utterly alone if -PRON- be set down on the broad bosom of the nothing to drink 
then -PRON- all laugh and clap the great man on the back and seem to think -PRON- an excel lend joke and col keever become bland and facetious and inform -PRON- again of -PRON- ever lasting regard 
follow this mr boomer go to the door and look out on the landing and down the stair and come back seemingly satisfied 
all clear colonel -PRON- say and col dingle hitch -PRON- chair into confidential proximity to col four gentleman from harmony colonel -PRON- observe carefully concord be the countyseat of goodwill county 
col keever reply that -PRON- have no reason to dispute -PRON- honorable friend statement

when -PRON- rain col dingle know where to go to keep out of the wet 
dingle laugh -PRON- natural eye glow and -PRON- nudge keever with -PRON- elbow 
the other three gentleman join in the merriment liquid refresh ment be again bountifully administer and the good feeling prevail to an extent that be al most morbid 
dingle hang languishingly on shoulder while the three other huddle about anxious to laugh at any joke however old and silently -PRON- be plore an opportunity to express -PRON- unbounded affection for everybody special election have be call for the pur pose of shift the countyseat from concord to harmony dingle resume and a twothird vote be necessary to the consummation of such a change 
now -PRON- be impossible to deny that har mony be a favorite with twothird of the county -PRON- friend the enemy but designate -PRON- and -PRON- three understand how ut terly vain -PRON- would be for harmony to attempt to secure the countyseat without the good will and assistance of one whose ability be undoubted whose virtue be the envy of -PRON- fellow man and whose congenial nature be a theme of general re mark 
in short col archibald keever of con cord 
col keever smile -PRON- gratification and desire to state that -PRON- have never be -PRON- extreme good fortune to run across so truthful a man as col dingle nor such a wholesoule appreciative set of companion as have accompany -PRON- and -PRON- hope that know -PRON- as -PRON- all do -PRON- would take this little apostrophe for what -PRON- be worth 
in the meantime as the national debt be oppressive why not give -PRON- another lift 
the four gentleman from harmony readily un derstood this hint and four flask be stretch out simultaneously towards col keever 
the latter bow and to the end that none may feel aggrieve pay due and lengthen attention to each flask supplement each draught with a peculiarly happy remark relative to the generosity of the donor and the excellence of -PRON- gift 
this small formality over col dingle once more resume -PRON- topic in a voice that be grow husky by very apparent degree

now everybody be aware that the road be all right the bridge in good condition and that -PRON- have more house than -PRON- can use 
well then why have -PRON- bring all these man here 
oh -PRON- know that fertile brain that intellect that labor and bring forth the blizzard have hide -PRON- purpose well but -PRON- have discover -PRON- -PRON- boy 
-PRON- have come a chorus of thick voice 
col keever wear a perpetual smile very child like very bland and -PRON- would wink -PRON- right eye now and then and shake -PRON- head with a great deal of feel the purpose -PRON- inquire evince a tendency to run -PRON- word together this

and this bring -PRON- back to where -PRON- start say col dingle 
harmony would like the county seat and -PRON- would like -PRON- just two thou sand dollar worth

col keever relapse into silence and do -PRON- good to think calmly while the four gentleman from harmony await -PRON- reply in soulful expecta tion 
two thousand ask keever huskily 
two thousand come an equally husky reply 
cash down

the ubiquitous miss pinkney be not along and the silverplate harness jingle rare music as miss betty draw to a halt 
mr whittaker have go off to attend to some farm work and guy be alone at the house

but to morrow -PRON- know be election day 
the return will reach -PRON- more quickly in harmony than -PRON- will here shall not stay here 
-PRON- post of duty be concord and mr whittaker be go to take -PRON- there in the morning 
from the way the concord people treat -PRON- -PRON- say -PRON- eye glow resentfully shouldnot think -PRON- would ever want to set foot in the place again 
irrespective of the feeling of the concordian -PRON- smile there be -PRON- financial interest 
i can not abandon those twelve hundred lot 
what be twelve hundred or twelve thousand lot to the son of mr montfort herbert -PRON- return mere bagatelle i know perfectly well that -PRON- isnot the money at stake in -PRON- case nor be -PRON- in mine test 
-PRON- be the excitement of the con -PRON- throw back -PRON- shoulder and toss the rigor of the game -PRON- fair head stout heart a fair fight and the rigor of the game the end of -PRON- plot and -PRON- counterplot be now at hand 
either success or defeat will prove equally glorious and -PRON- can learn the bad or the good at willowview just as well as -PRON- can in concord 
please donot keep -PRON- wait mr herbert 
evidently -PRON- think the son of mr montfort herbert have a competence in -PRON- own right 
-PRON- have not be inform of the real condition of fortune and -PRON- be not the one to lay bare the truth 
guy reflect 
-PRON- may do more harmthan good in concord if -PRON- go there during the crisis 
-PRON- have no vote anyway as two week in the territory would not give -PRON- the right of franchise 
be side have -PRON- not in a quiet way gain a strate gic advantage which would keep the countyseat at concord 
very well miss vlandingham -PRON- say 
-PRON- be kind of -PRON- to come for -PRON- and if -PRON- really care for -PRON- company at willowview i shall be most happy to return with -PRON- 
-PRON- go into the house for -PRON- satchel and -PRON- start for harmony with a snap of the whip and a jingle of chain 
very shortly -PRON- pass mr whittaker at work by the road and there be a brief halt while guy explain matter 
mr whit taker say little but smile in a know way and -PRON- could see -PRON- lean on the handle of -PRON- shovel and watch until -PRON- be out of sight 
-PRON- friend the enemy only the pen of a poet could fittingly describe that wondrous ride 
a sentimental journey -PRON- be every step of the way from to the a delicious fare across the sunny plain through a drowsy odor of wild flower and under such sky as smile over the fortunate isle 
touch by the spell neither of the young people waste much time in conversation and the long lapse of silence into which -PRON- fall be rhythmic interval wherein -PRON- heart echo back the melody of a song as old as the day of man 
arrive at -PRON- destination guy heave a sigh of regret 
the calend of -PRON- love have lift a white stone to mark a pass hour and -PRON- be more securely a captive if that could be 
the young man sojourn at willowview be very brief 
both miss betty and -PRON- father ex erte -PRON- to the utmost to make -PRON- stay enjoyable but -PRON- be ill at ease 
-PRON- negotiation with mr landy have certainly win the county seat for concord and -PRON- seem to -PRON- as though -PRON- be act a double part 
when the return come in and when the genial squire and the adorable miss betty discover how wily and tactful -PRON- have be -PRON- fear that there would be an upheaval and that -PRON- would deny -PRON- -PRON- hospitality and send -PRON- forth in scorn 
-PRON- be all very well for miss betty to talk of the rigor of the game 
the prime incentive in every game be success and when the ballot be count and -PRON- be find that amityville have cast the rigor of the game a decide vote for concord -PRON- would see then whether miss betty would take defeat as glor iously as -PRON- would have take a well fortune 
-PRON- would be a bitter triumph for -PRON- if -PRON- cost -PRON- -PRON- favor 
yet if -PRON- have not speak those word in a spirit of railleryin short if -PRON- really mean themhow incomparable -PRON- would become in -PRON- eye 
as pettibone have say -PRON- could go to -PRON- and offer -PRON- a dower interest in -PRON- town then if -PRON- would accept 
and -PRON- heart leap at the thought and -PRON- mind wing skyward in sweeping dream

if -PRON- shrewdness and courage have please -PRON- in the political field how much more be -PRON- attract by -PRON- domestic accomplish ment 
guy be watch miss white finger flit over the key and now and then exchange a soft word in which -PRON- passion throb danger -PRON- friend the enemy ously near the surface when there come a sudden interruption

for -PRON- part i hope that illfate courthouse will be burn to the last stick enough 
-PRON- have cause trouble together -PRON- sit on the porch watch the the rigor of the game yellow flame leap high and toss -PRON- sparkle starlike cinder 
then gradually the fiery tongue sink down and down the glare fade out of the sky and -PRON- know that the courthouse have cease to be a factor in the contest 
the squire return by and by and with -PRON- walk a youth who be wheel a bicycle 
let -PRON- go in for a moment -PRON- hear the squire say gate

some two mile out of town the angry citizen drop -PRON- victim roughly and give -PRON- warn e in term more forcible than polite never more to show -PRON- face within the corporate limit of concord 
sampson be the last of the indignant people to make -PRON- way back to town 
as -PRON- be about to pass from sight -PRON- turn for one final glimpse of -PRON- former employer 
and there the colonel sit -PRON- the great man who have raise out of nothing that monument of tireless energy and intellectual grandeur the concord blizzard 
the monument be gonehad pass away in a breathand there -PRON- sit soli tary and alone ponder the depth of -PRON- fall

-PRON- have carry -PRON- vengeance to a point which would have satisfy an ordinary mortal but there the voice of the people i be nothing ordinary about sampson 
-PRON- ire have mount high not only against the colonel but against everything that have form a part and parcel of the equipment 
the newspaper have gasp -PRON- last under the stran gle finger of the mob so that nothing remain save the building that have house the plant and even that be hateful to the printer 
while plod homeward -PRON- thought be more than busy and -PRON- evolve an idea that cause -PRON- to slap -PRON- skinny hand together and laugh impishly be the last act -PRON- mutter and the townll have something that will help to keep -PRON- memory green do ityes sir do -PRON- if -PRON- take a leg in pursuance of -PRON- plan sampson reentere the town by stealth 
screen by the watertank -PRON- cautiously reconnoiter the situation and dis cover that the weary and perspire citizen be gather about the door of the hotel 
nothing could have be more favorable and sampson give vent to an unholy chuckle 
mebby -PRON- wonot be surprised -PRON- whisper to -PRON- oh mebby -PRON- wonot 
warily -PRON- cross the railroad track crawl on hand and knee the full length of several pile of railroad tie and then by skilful manoeuvering gain the rear of the hotel unseen 
from this point the course be clear and -PRON- do not halt until -PRON- reach the cannon 
-PRON- friend the enemy except sampson there be not a soul any where in the vicinity of the twelvepounder 
mrs glimmer now that the colonel have be remove from the town have retire into the emporium with -PRON- knitting and -PRON- husband be still lin gere among those who hover about the hotel 
herkimer be on duty in the livery barn but the trouble of the town be nothing to -PRON- and -PRON- be clean harness in the harness room nefarious work may have be wit nesse by any one who chance to stand in front of the emporium or the livery barn and hence -PRON- will be see how fortune continue to favor -PRON- salute the blizzard mutter sampson with a laugh of the demoniacal kind give the blizzard a boom then -PRON- tug and push with tremendous energy until -PRON- have bring the muzzle of the cannon in line with the blizzard building 
when this be accomplish -PRON- fish a match out of -PRON- pocket and strike -PRON- against the side of the gun 
from the fact that this particular piece of ar tillery have be purchase of a junk dealer -PRON- have never have the full and unqualified confidence of those who be designate to fire -PRON- off 
as a precaution therefore -PRON- be usually discharge by mean of a two minute grace be utilize by the man who light the fuse in place -PRON- at a safe distance 
this precautionary measure be well known to samp the voice of the people son and after -PRON- have apply the match -PRON- take to -PRON- heel 
-PRON- do not get too far away how ever for -PRON- want to witness the devastation 
while -PRON- stand watch and wait -PRON- sud denly remember that some dynamite leave over from the operation of the import roadbuilder be store in the first story of the structure on which -PRON- have train the cannon and besides the dynamite there be also an assortment of fire work buy with a fund raise by popular subscription to be use in celebrate the come fourth of july 
great scott murmur sampson huskily 
by a wild impulse -PRON- start towards the can non then -PRON- turn abruptly give a despairing groan and make in the opposite direction pallid fearful and bent only on get away from the scene of -PRON- rash deed before the direful conse quence could overtake -PRON- 
a pettibone have remain discreetly in the back ground during the spilling of those vial of wrath 
guy have also keep clear of the mob but -PRON- reason for do so be different from petti bone 
if an investigation have follow that morning work -PRON- may reasonably have be ask why if the sheriff be present -PRON- have not perform -PRON- swear duty and prevent a destruction of prop erty and the subsequent violence which have be visit upon a citizen of the town culpable though -PRON- undoubtedly be 
pettibone forestall the question by take -PRON- out of the way 
as for guy -PRON- have suffer by the misdoing far more than any one else in concord and may have be excuse the desire to see punishment fall where -PRON- be so justly deserve 
but the desire be lack 
-PRON- do not care to glory in the downfall much less to wit ness -PRON- 
so after the citizen have disappear with the hate offender -PRON- seat -PRON- on the hotel veranda and be presently join by the sheriff 
-PRON- friend the enemy the activity of -PRON- friend the colonel will now be transfer to other quarter observe pettibone bring a chair from the office and drop into -PRON- with a deep breath of satisfac tion 
heaven help the other quarter -PRON- add soulfully 
herbert if -PRON- hadnot be for that redheade printer i hate to think what may have happen to -PRON- 
truth crush to earth will rise again smile the young man 
and the way of the transgressor be mighty harda the colonel have probably discover by this time 
pettibone take an old pipe from one pocket a handful of tobacco from another and be soon shroud in a cloud of smoke 
lone some will use to be load to the waterline with all these here proverb old sayin wise saw and so on

-PRON- have -PRON- in mind to name sampson as one of the four but refrained 
some of the farmer who come in here to ex ercise the right of franchise must have be buy up by the other side proceed pettibone 
amityville go solid for -PRON- be the big kind of a surprise and when -PRON- explain how -PRON- happen over there by cannon -PRON- make -PRON- first tally not particularly proud of that say the young man suppose though that the only way to fight the devil be with fire all in -PRON- point of view chuckle the sheriff 
politics be a muddy country and -PRON- canot go through -PRON- and keep -PRON- shoe clean 
but to come back to the election -PRON- be the great big vote roll up by harmony that settle the case people present -PRON- -PRON- friend the enemy with eightyone ballot think of that

the rest of the party straggle along after -PRON- by two and three drop on the ground the moment -PRON- reach the shady side of the hotel building 
-PRON- be all dusty tired and perspiring but a calm 25o -PRON- friend the enemy sense of duty well do bring a glow of satis faction to every face 
nothing be say for some time then mr glim mer seat on the edge of the veranda fan -PRON- with -PRON- hat lift -PRON- voice sic semper tyrannis say -PRON- glare about -PRON- through -PRON- spectacle 
in those quarter where -PRON- be understand the remark be duly approve 
gentleman remark pinney rise to -PRON- foot the people have speak in no uncertain tone 
the torrent popular wrath anderrighteous indignation have overflow -PRON- bank and engulf the common enemy 
-PRON- cease 
there be general surprise for no one have imagine that the druggist could plume -PRON- speech with such rhetoric 
embolden by a ripple of applause the speaker continue like lightning from a clear sky the depth of this man perfidy be suddenly make known to -PRON- 
-PRON- do not pause -PRON- do not hesi tate 
-PRON- leap forward as one man and then artillery boom out zigzag flash bespangle the firmament the earth trem bleed open and keever from the sight of man 
the voice of the people have be hear the hand of the people have be feel l this magnificent period be receive by the gathering in silent awe thunder have defy nature by precede the lightning but that a fortunate disaster i be a minor point 
as -PRON- stand before -PRON- erect and glow with -PRON- impromptu effort -PRON- seem to the citizen as though the mantle of the editor have fall upon the shoulder of the drug gist 
as if to emphasize and illustrate the figurative term of the orator a hoarse from the low end of the main street tag closely upon the heel of -PRON- peroration 
-PRON- be the cannon pinney and the other recognize the sound but have barely time to exchange apprehensive glance when a terrific detonation shake the earth set every building in town aquiver crash into fragment all the glass in all the window and hurl glimmer from the veranda and levelled pinney in -PRON- track 
a lurid glare ghastly in the white light of day hover sullenly over concord 
swiftly -PRON- fade dbris begin to rain down and rocket and roman candle open a furious bombardment with -PRON- flaming ball 
strange serpentine thing leave fiery trail in the street and open space or wriggle in glow line over the rooftop or streak luminously through the air explode as -PRON- vanish pinwheel sputter above and below and flash into nothing with a shower of spark firecracker pop merrily here there and everywhere a bass note be frequently sound by one of the cannon variety and in front of the hotel a wonderful contrivance come plump down and forthwith unbosom -PRON- of -PRON- friend the enemy a veritable whirlwind of blaze vagary close with a beacon that change from red to white and then to blue 
then there ensue a lull in the wild confusion of fire and noise and glimmer raise -PRON- from the ground point across the street towards the roof of the townsite com panys build 
look -PRON- cry huskily 
the eye of the bewilder people follow the point finger and behold a setpiece whose in tricate wire have become entangle with the cop ing of the roof 
thus hold the device be sputter ing and hissing and trace in bloodre letter the ironical word what have happen 
eye seek eye and put the silent question 
the citizen begin to move mechanically as though awaken from some horrible nightmare 
woman and small child could be see rush from -PRON- dwelling and could be hear scream and lament 
a runa way team with a lumber wagon bounding behind plunge across the railroad track and disappear beyond the depot 
stray cow gallop from point to point with frenzied bellow and dog crouch shiver and whine in any chance corner that may afford protection 
the blizzard building cry pettibone dash e one hand across -PRON- eye 
there be dyna mite there and the firework for the fourth blow up -PRON- spring from the veranda and start south at a run the people follow 
a fortunate disaster never mind the blizzard building shout guy keenly alive to the danger of the moment 
fire may result from all this go to -PRON- home and store quiet -PRON- family and guard against fire this warning strike home and the frightened crowd disintegrate in every direction 
guy as soon as -PRON- make sure -PRON- advice would be act upon hurry down the street in the direction take by pettibone 
as -PRON- run -PRON- notice the broken window on either side and observe that the litter of splintered board increase as -PRON- ad vance 
at last -PRON- reach the spot where the blizzard building have stand only to find that -PRON- have disappear a deep hole in the earth mark -PRON- site 
more dbris be bank up about the brink of the hole and on the high part of the heap stand the sheriff this the bad -PRON- ever hear herbert 
pettibone call to guy argue against hav e that dynamite store here but keever have -PRON- say as usual under -PRON- not -PRON- -PRON- say and that settle -PRON-

who be -PRON- what like to know 
if there have be as much of that dyna mite in the storeroom as there be a month ago tell -PRON- concord would have be wipe off the map 
-PRON- friend the enemy guy climb up beside pettibone and survey the ruin from that position 
the building flimsily construct at best have be literally riven asun der the wall blow to fragment and crush back and the roof scatter piecemeal over the whole townsite 
for fully ten foot downward the earth have be displace heave up at the side and hurl over the broken board and timber 
the sheriff talk under -PRON- breath and shake -PRON- head gloomily move off towards the cannon and guy lower -PRON- carefully down the ragged side of the pit 
-PRON- see something that startle -PRON- 
-PRON- be an object irregular in shape and little large than a man fist 
pick up the fragment with tremble hand -PRON- pinch -PRON- in -PRON- finger examine -PRON- on every side and then drop -PRON- into -PRON- pocket 
-PRON- be pale with excitement and look up ward in the hope of see some one to whom -PRON- could announce -PRON- find 
but the sheriff have not return and there be no one else to hear -PRON- news 
suddenly a doubt sweep through -PRON- brain 
that fragment may have be in the storeroom at the time of the explosion press one hand to -PRON- forehead and stand for a second immovable the next moment -PRON- have hurry stumblingly to the deep part of the pit have sink to -PRON- knee and have begin scrape away the earth with -PRON- hand

but -PRON- be not empty in the strict meaning of the word for sampson be inside far go with terror because of the havoc -PRON- have work and scarcely dare to breathe until concord have be leave safely behind -PRON- 
no fire no fatality no one even seriously injure this be the remarkable record of the morning of that redlett day when col keever be banish the town and when sampson fire into the blizzard building and blow -PRON- to the four wind 
there be a property loss to be sure for apart from the destruction of the print estab lishment and the roof that have shelter itthe colonel own a small equity in eachnot a whole pane of glass have be leave in any building in concord

later that evening guy have a very serious dis cussion with pettibone in one corner of the hotel office

herbert say pettibone shake hand with guy when ready to go a brick one chance in ten that -PRON- be wrong or that the business wonot pan out but the other nine chance be good enough for -PRON- 
keep -PRON- quiet for a while 
the man who own the land around here ought to know about -PRON- for -PRON- own protection 
trust -PRON- tell every one that s interested 
pettibone stride off with a beam face and an unwonted look in -PRON- eye 
-PRON- be alive to the possibility of great discovery and -PRON- awakening have bring with -PRON- no small amount of excitement 
the young man sleep but little that night for develop the great discovery -PRON- brain continue to busy -PRON- with stray thought and halfformed plan

by noon herbert be able to tell -PRON- whether -PRON- theory be straight good or only moonshine

guy return to the hotel and compose -PRON- to await report of the development work 
while -PRON- be sit on the veranda the train from the west draw up at the depot platform and -PRON- be very much surprised to see no less a per sonage than mr pinchbeck alight and turn -PRON- step in the direction of the hotel

guy -PRON- deplore the lawlessness and be anxious to turn to another side of the subject 
the capitalist laugh softly 
the colonel limp into harmony about noon yesterday say -PRON- a melancholy spectacle if there ever be one 
-PRON- could barely drag -PRON- to the edge of the depot platform and there -PRON- sit -PRON- hand on the head of -PRON- cane and -PRON- chin on -PRON- hand 
really -PRON- look as though a hadnot a friend in the world 
dingle harp blue and boomer hear -PRON- be in town and -PRON- walk to the depot and pay -PRON- something like nineteen hundred dollar the price of -PRON- treachery interject guy

the lecture -PRON- read to keever be so hot -PRON- make -PRON- fairly shrivel 
and -PRON- didnot confine -PRON- to the colonel either but turn -PRON- fire on dingle harp blue and boomer and keep -PRON- go until -PRON- have give -PRON- a thorough understand e of what -PRON- think of -PRON- doing 
when -PRON- friend the enemy -PRON- be through -PRON- order keever out of town on the first train east or west and drive off 
gracious that be a talk to remember -PRON- bert 
-PRON- be difficult to understand miss vlanding ham at time say guy wonder why -PRON- should applaud -PRON- for secure the amityville vote and then turn squarely about and condemn dingle and -PRON- associate for secure the jame town contingent through the colonel 
difficult echo mr pinchbeck impossible sir impossible but -PRON- always have the courage of -PRON- conviction 
always add guy and speak in such a tone that the other shoot a swift glance at -PRON- 
guy meet the glance calmly and ask do -PRON- want that block of concord lot mr pinchbeck 
hardly be the reply with an expansive smile 
suppose i could convince -PRON- that -PRON- would be a good investment 
-PRON- would be impossible for -PRON- to do that would like to try at any rate 
will -PRON- come upstairs with -PRON- to -PRON- room

pettibone reply affirmatively and indicate the various point where development work be in progress go to these place herbert say pinch beck 
the round be make and when the young man and the capitalist return to concord -PRON- be of one mind regard the bright future that lie before the town

yes 
may i still have an option on that block at the original figure 
until saturday mr pinchbeck

where else in the county have anything recently occur that be worth mention 
mr pinchbeck be tell -PRON- this morning how col keever pay harmony a fly visit and collect the money due -PRON- from the committee of way and mean 
deep color flash into miss face 
mr pinchbeck be very observing say -PRON- presume -PRON- also tell -PRON- how miss vlande ham storm at the colonel and hurl -PRON- scath e denunciation at the committee 
-PRON- do not wait for guy to answer but continue hastily with a touch of bitterness in -PRON- voice oh if i have only know of that call the committee make on col keever monday night what would -PRON- have do ask guy quietly 
do -PRON- repeat with sparkling eye would not have countenance the proceeding that infamous bargain would not have be make 
if that bargain have not be make harmony would not have secure the countyseat 
develop the great discovery l -PRON- echo in fine scorn 
be that all -PRON- have to think about or live for 
the whole town of harmony be as nothing weigh in the balance with that despicable piece of work l guy quite lose -PRON- breath 
why -PRON- murmur when i make -PRON- an ob ject for those amityville man to vote for har mony -PRON- find no fault with -PRON- for do -PRON- 
therefore -PRON- think -PRON- inconsistent -PRON- exclaim 
but that be far from be a parallel case 
-PRON- take -PRON- father weapon out of -PRON- hand and win the amityville people by -PRON- own method 
i be proud of -PRON- for that 
suppose however -PRON- have come to harmony like a thief in the night suppose -PRON- have ply col dingle with liquor until -PRON- be intoxicate and suppose -PRON- have there and then hire -PRON- to make those man from work for -PRON- father mind and draw -PRON- pay from -PRON- suppose -PRON- have hire col dingle to make those man vote for concord 
if -PRON- have do that guy herbert -PRON- would have be beneath contempt -PRON- eye gleam -PRON- bosom heave under -PRON- stress of passion and -PRON- word come clear and keen 
guy gaze at -PRON- mutely 
as -PRON- state the case -PRON- look altogether different to -PRON- 
but -PRON- would not have do such a thing -PRON- go on -PRON- could not have do -PRON- 
nor would -PRON- wrong -PRON- by think i have the slight -PRON- friend the enemy e knowledge of what be go forward or by -PRON- silence give even a tacit consent to -PRON- 
-PRON- do not think that do -PRON- 
tell -PRON- please tell -PRON- -PRON- do not 
there be a pleading tone in -PRON- voice and a suggestion of tear in -PRON- eye be sure -PRON- know nothing about that say guy 
why be -PRON- sure of -PRON- -PRON- ask look at -PRON- steadily 
have i not tell -PRON- that -PRON- be all a case of diamond cut diamond 
do -PRON- not see -PRON- actively engage in the stealing of -PRON- courthouse 
those be not parallel case -PRON- answer in -PRON- own word 
but for -PRON- miss vlandingham this contest would have be a sanguinary one 
i have no influence -PRON- throw the weight of -PRON- into the scale and by a diplomacy as rare as -PRON- be skilful ward off the violence that seem bind to come 
the loss of one life would not have pay for a dozen countyseat 
there be a strange something in the blue eye as -PRON- bend upon -PRON- and why could -PRON- not read -PRON- mystery 
if i could undo the wrong say -PRON- after a brief pause if the election may be recall and hold over again believe -PRON- concord would hold -PRON- own 
why do -PRON- not tell -PRON- mr herbert that success or failure mean so much to -PRON- 
mr whittaker tell -PRON- alleverythe that -PRON- be so careful to hide from -PRON- 
be -PRON- afraid develop the great discovery of -PRON- generosity afraid -PRON- should think less of -PRON- oror -PRON- voice choke tear start from -PRON- eye and -PRON- abruptly turn from -PRON- and dart away along the road that lead to harmony 
betty -PRON- call after -PRON- betty l -PRON- answer be a quick use of the whip and never a backward glance do -PRON- deign -PRON- 
-PRON- strike into a gallop with the intention of over take -PRON- but by that time -PRON- horse be at a run and pursuit on a livery hack be simply a useless effort 
as -PRON- draw to a slow pace -PRON- look around and flourish -PRON- whip 
-PRON- shall expect -PRON- this evening -PRON- cry and continue on -PRON- way at a more leisurely pace

nevertheless the bargain have be make and the labor such as -PRON- be complete 
the man be expect the sum of one hundred and twenty dollar each and if -PRON- be not forthcome -PRON- evil passion would assuredly obtain the upper hand

two hundred and fifty dollar be send to -PRON- 
-PRON- fee be fifty dollar and -PRON- cost fifty dollar to have a private detective hunt -PRON- up at that twelfth street boardinghouse 
i be tell merely that -PRON- be in chicago and smile rather a large place in which to locate a stranger 
the re mainder of the amount send to -PRON- be now in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- fold the receipt and lay -PRON- with the other document 
that money be to be use for a purpose mr lorry -PRON- add 
what purpose

-PRON- be to proceed to san francisco time -PRON- to arrive in that city on the twentyfifth of april 
when there go to the palace hotel

a a to four am to make -PRON- known to -PRON- 
yes 
i be properly at sea with all this -PRON- may be sure

take a pencil and notebook from -PRON- pocket i ask for the name of those i to meet do not know the name of the three per son be the lawyer astounding answer 
-PRON- will be at the palace hotel san fran cisco on the twentyfifth and will be expect -PRON- take -PRON- then that -PRON- know -PRON- name and will make -PRON- know to -PRON-

-PRON- may do the questioning or the other may do -PRON- 
the question be this what time be -PRON- 
the answer a quarter to four 
-PRON- may give the challenge or receive -PRON- and the response must be the one state 
this look like a lot of claptrap possibly lead e nowhere 
i exclaim 
a a to -PRON- possibly return mr benson 
be -PRON- a hoax 
rather an expensive one if -PRON- be donot -PRON- think 
-PRON- will take draw a small seal envelope from the large one and hand -PRON- to san francisco with -PRON- 
there be no address on the envelope no in formation of any kind 
unless instruct to the contrary say mr benson -PRON- will open that envelope at a private conference of the four after all of -PRON- have be identify 
this look to -PRON- like a lot of cumbrous ma chinery for evolve an infinitesimal result 
i say as much in a tone of pronounced depreca tion 
the lawyer mismatch eye survey -PRON- with weary impatience have do -PRON- part mr lorry -PRON- an nounced and -PRON- will either do -PRON- or leave -PRON- undo as -PRON- see fit 
good morning 
thereupon i leave the room the money in -PRON- pocket the seal envelope in the breast of -PRON- coat and -PRON- mind in a chaos of speculation as fruitless as -PRON- be exasperate 
zooke backward 
have -PRON- ever observe how hard luck when -PRON- once deal -PRON- a tell blow follow -PRON- up with another and another 
-PRON- be fortunate indeed if this observation be not bear of personal experi 11ce 
misfortune get past -PRON- guard with a blow that daze and bewilder proceed forth with to take advantage of -PRON- sorry condition and to smite -PRON- hip and thigh 
thus have the world go with -PRON- up to the very hour i have receive that letter summon -PRON- to the office of benson grime 
just before the letter come into -PRON- hand so grievously have i be worst by the blow of circumstance that i have begin to wonder if i be not down and out 
adversity be a rough road 
where -PRON- branch from the smooth and sunny thoroughfare of suc cess one can usually look back and see a sign board that be wrongly interpret 
for -PRON- uncle rufu stand at the parting of a a to four the way 
if -PRON- have be a little less inflexible if -PRON- have concern -PRON- a little more with -PRON- natural bent and have not seek to drive -PRON- into a vocation for which i be manifestly unfit perhaps i should not have awaken that bright spring morning in a humble hall bedroom with certain arrearage of board to meet and with only ten cent in -PRON- pocket 
-PRON- estatewhich with -PRON- have be leave to the care of uncle small amount e to about five thousand dollar 
yet if the world give atlas as much trouble as that money give uncle rufu then i be sorry for atlas 
uncle rufu want -PRON- to become a minister 
as i have absolutely no inclination that way -PRON- defer to the wanderlust that have take hold of -PRON- from -PRON- infancy and trim -PRON- desire to the more modest specification of a missionary 
-PRON- think that by wander in heathen part i could please -PRON- and that by evangel ise the heathen i could please -PRON- 
but still -PRON- pattern be too large for -PRON- cloth 
the crusoe spirit fasten upon -PRON- by virtue of a onesyllable edition which i sequester about the time i discard pinafore for short a a to four trouser 
from mariner -PRON- be an easy stage to gil bla and only a couple of step farther to the count of monte cristo and two year before the mast 
-PRON- readingroom while i live with uncle rufu be a corner of the haymow 
in the house -PRON- puritanical straightlaced guardian have lay out a noble library with book of martyr at the head for -PRON- especial benefit 
one day uncle rufu commend the zeal i display in imbibe the martyr only to look over -PRON- shoulder a little later and find jack harkaway snuggle among the leave 
from that moment -PRON- estrangement begin grow through the year to an ultimate separation 
i graduate from the high school at eighteen with an imagination that have win -PRON- the honor of class prophet 
-PRON- be a gallant effort i re member carve out fame and fortune for nine young man and woman and inasmuch as i leave every one of -PRON- in power and prominence -PRON- be heartily applaud 
i go home that night to find uncle rufu dally with a bonfire 
as i draw near i a a to four see -PRON- poke the last vestige of -PRON- haymow collection of literature into the flame 
-PRON- have word 
at midnight i steal away from the house leave great barrington and the dear old berkshire on the truck of a passenger train and in three day have ship as cabinboy on a tramp steamer bind for cape town 
how be a soldier of fortune launch upon -PRON- career 
in some such way as this i imagine provide the inclination to roam be strong enough to endure the hardship 
on the way to africa i have sailore curse and hammer into -PRON- 
no sooner be the tramp under the shadow of table mountain than i go overboard in the night and in due course reach bultfontein and the diamondfield 
look for bit of carbon in blue ground do not satisfy -PRON- and -PRON- be not long before i join a party that raid the boer get old england in no end of trouble and incidentally put -PRON- in hospital for a month 
when well enough i ship on a yankee trader for the south sea from the portuguese settlement 
-PRON- be needless to detail the eight year of knock e about 
soldier of fortune usually find cen a a to four tral america in -PRON- itinerary so quite naturally -PRON- drop into mine 
have i be on the right side of the con troversy the man who would have make -PRON- dictator of one of the state would have remember -PRON- substantially 
what a wealth of possibility be wrap up in those word would have and should have 
as -PRON- chance i be on the wrong side of that central american argument 
a handful of ragged fugitive get -PRON- into mexico in a ham mock swing between horse for i have be badly wound 
the fugitive leave -PRON- to die in the hut of a peon and with the peon -PRON- leave a big bag of silver dollar to pay for decent interment and to reward the peon for -PRON- trouble 
all -PRON- life long i have be disappoint peo ple so i disappoint the peon and begin to re cover 
when -PRON- see the bag of dollar slip away from -PRON- -PRON- gracious host try to finish the bullet work with a dirk 
-PRON- find -PRON- with more fight at -PRON- disposal than -PRON- have imagine and i escape with -PRON- dollar and -PRON- host burro ultimately reach a a to four the city of mexico 
still far from well a desire to get back into country take hold of -PRON- and i strike for the heart of -PRON- make the long railroad journey to chicago 
i would settle down i fondly persuade -PRON- self 
i be twentysix and -PRON- be high time 
eight year as a roll stone have leave -PRON- with moss enough to pay two week board in a humble south side boardinghouse 
i awake from -PRON- monte cristo dream and even the hum bler fortune of the irish con cregan fail to interest -PRON- 
i would look for a place to work 
i look for a month walk to save car fare during the last two week of the time 
-PRON- search be unsuccessful 
i could not keep book i could not write short hand i be not scholarly enough for a private tutor and have no reference for a position of trust 
no one in chicago want a man of such shine ability as i have develop 
as a last resort i try shovelwork in a sewer gang 
-PRON- spirit chafe because of -PRON- but -PRON- landlady mrs pynchon be become garrulous on the subject of a fortnight bill due and un pay 
a a ter to four the discovery that the wound in -PRON- side make shovelwork an impossibility be not particularly distress 
i draw -PRON- time at the end of an hour and with fifteen cent in -PRON- pocket walk from diversey street on the north side to twelfth street on the south 
-PRON- interview with mrs pynchon when i get back to the boardinghouse be of a nature that i hesitate to describe 
during -PRON- absence -PRON- have take possession of -PRON- grip have examine -PRON- at -PRON- leisure and have find -PRON- to contain a shortbladed machete a brace of revolver and a pair of puttee 
mrs pynchon be wroth indeed and in the morning i must pay or go 
-PRON- would keep the relic of -PRON- central american experience and sell -PRON- for what -PRON- could get 
i be think of all this as i lie in -PRON- bed that bright spring morning look out through the dusty windowpane 
should or should i not write to uncle rufu for an accounting 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- that five thousand dollar properly invest for eight year should amount to quite a tidy sum 
many a time before i have think with longing of that money but senti a a to four mentfoolish if -PRON- willhad keep -PRON- from claim -PRON- 
-PRON- dream tenderly nurse for those eight year have be to return to great barrington possess of untold thousand thus prove com placently that i have open the oyster with -PRON- own good sword 
to demand an accounting of uncle rufu be tacitly to acknowledge defeatto admit -PRON- be right when -PRON- say during -PRON- last bitter interview that i would go -PRON- un bridle course and come to want 
for a man whose strong spirit pant for suc cess the acknowledgment of failure be gall 
even at a time when -PRON- fortune be at -PRON- low ebb i could not bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
yet i be beat 
lie there in that bed for whose hire mrs pynchon still stand on the credit side of -PRON- ledger i ponder the momentous question as to whether be down i be to be count out 
in the throe of -PRON- quandary a knock fall on the door 
mrs pynchon i think come to eject -PRON- 
but -PRON- be not mr pynchon 
-PRON- be betty a a ter to the maid and betty wonder of wonder have a letter for -PRON- 
that letter prove to be the brief document that carry -PRON- to the office of benson grime attorney the astonishing result of which call have already be chronicle 
i have never be very long in reach a de cision or in map out a policy for future en deavor 
with money for immediate need and travel expense -PRON- be not five minute after i leave the lawyer office before i have make up -PRON- mind to see the matter through 
thereupon i replenish -PRON- modest wardrobe with a new suit of clothe visit the barber and go back to mrs with the air of a prodigal who have come into -PRON- own 
nothing succeed like success unless now and then -PRON- be something that have the appearance of success 
mrs attitude veer with the favor wind and -PRON- hostility melt away in smile 
the roll of bill which i draw from -PRON- pocket in cancel -PRON- obligation appear to contain vastly more than -PRON- really do 
while -PRON- eye widen -PRON- morbid amiability increase 
a a to -PRON- be curious of course 
what woman would not have be in the circumstance 
-PRON- require all -PRON- tact to parry -PRON- indirect que tion without offend 
there be an embarrassing moment when -PRON- return -PRON- satchel but when i leave -PRON- give -PRON- a hearty handclasp and beg that i would not forget -PRON- house whenever i chance to be in the city 
forget -PRON- house 
not whether in the city or out of -PRON- 
the most discouraging period of -PRON- life have be pass in that thirdclass board ingplace on twelfth street 
that evening i start westward in a tourist sleeper equip with a seal envelope and a horological countersign more than halfcon vinced that i be want for some filibustering expedition 
the time o day 
the morning of april twentyfifth find -PRON- in the palace hotel in the city of the golden gate 
to particularize further the beginning of that eventful day find -PRON- in the great ro tunda with a weathereye out for swashbuckler of the filibustering type 
reflection during that long crosscountry jour ney have still further convince -PRON- as to the de sign back of -PRON- interview with mr benson 
the law have a heavy hand for filibuster outfit from a peaceable port hence the mystery that point -PRON- course and shroud -PRON- movement 
one detail alone mar the theory i have evolve 
sailor lodginghouse on the front should have be the scene of -PRON- questionable come together and not that magnificent hos telry 
big broadshouldered swag gerer with a thwartshiproll in -PRON- gait would surely be out of place in that splendid rotunda 
a a ter to through the curl wreath of -PRON- cigar i look for such person in vain 
may i trouble -PRON- for the correct time sir 
the word come like a thunderclap come from the depth of a sleepyhollow chair on -PRON- right 
i hoist up on one elbow for a sidewise stare 
a stout gentleman with smooth face and iron gray hair silkhatte and prosperously dressed have launch the question 
a morning paper lie across -PRON- knee and -PRON- be study the open face of -PRON- watch quarter to four say search the que tioner with a keen look 
the gentleman give a startled gasp counter e -PRON- glance with one of perplexity and alarm 
still hold -PRON- watch in -PRON- hand -PRON- struggle to -PRON- foot and make -PRON- way to the desk 
there -PRON- have some talk with the clerk both shoot covert look in -PRON- direction 
no doubt -PRON- consider -PRON- a fool or an idiot 
-PRON- be late in the forenoon and could not by any possibility have be a quarter to four 
-PRON- disgust be intense 
the shallow absurd ity of -PRON- position exasperate and mortify -PRON- 
red and perspiring i get out of -PRON- chair and a a to four go into the writingroom 
seat -PRON- in font of a desk i lean on -PRON- elbow and begin canvass the difficulty that have so suddenly pre sente -PRON- 
i have word for -PRON- that there be three person in that hotel who be as anxious to find -PRON- as i be to find -PRON- 
but there be many guest and if i go from one to another inquire the time of day -PRON- would not be long until -PRON- sanity be question and an officer call in 
-PRON- be console to know that there be three other place in a similar situation 
the ridicu lous aspect of the affair catch -PRON- finally and i laugh to -PRON- 
instead of wait for a challenge i would give one 
a yard away sit a middleage individual in a black silk skullcap -PRON- be write in dustriously 
pardon -PRON- say but could -PRON- tell -PRON- the time 
the man in the skullcap pause look toward -PRON- with a frown then jerk -PRON- head in the di rection of a clock that stare -PRON- in the face from a a to four an opposite wall 
there be no need of word and none be speak 
there be three other in the writingroom 
all have hear -PRON- query and if one of -PRON- have be in the plot certainly -PRON- would have signi fie -PRON- in some way and presently have come close enough to give -PRON- privately the correct answer 
after a brief wait during which nothing hap pen i get up and go away 
-PRON- disgust -PRON- be needless to say mount as failure multiply 
if a quartet of filibuster be to come together in that hotel why have not the guide mind speci fie green ribbon in coatlapel brickre neck tie or some other identification that would ap peal to the eye 
for get a man into trouble commend -PRON- a dozen time over to what -PRON- say rather than to what -PRON- see 
simple and inoffensive expedient -PRON- ap peare have be lay by 
a silly question and a brainless answer i must abide by these if i be to follow the matter to -PRON- legitimate con clusion 
lean against a marble column in the ro tunda i watch the people come and go across the mosaic floor linger at the desl or a a to four file away toward the elevator under convoy of the agile moneyseeker know as front 
idler in the sleepyhollow chair again undergo -PRON- scrutiny 
there be nothing at all promise in this ma terial 
no one trod the mosaic floor with knee bent as though to meet the heave of a deck no one bear the earmark of a filibuster idle in the big chair 
nevertheless that be the palace hotel and the day be the twentyfifth of april 
if i have be steer on a proper course there be three within sound of -PRON- voice who be as anxious to find -PRON- as i be to find -PRON- 
if from -PRON- post at that marble column i have dare shout -PRON- query as to the time o day no doubt the three miss one would have hear 
but i lack the hardihood for such initiative especially as a big clock with a dial like a full moon and hand and figure that could have be see a mile hang in plain view from every part of the rotunda 
from berate the extravagant machinery that be to lay -PRON- alongside the trio i have come to meet i fall to chafe at -PRON- helplessness 
leav a arter to four e the rotunda i go out to the sidewalk in front of the hotel 
the fresh air i think would clear -PRON- brain and settle -PRON- nerve 
market street be crowd with people 
a fruitgrower convention be in progress and the walk in front of the palace seem to be the rendezvous for a visit delegation 
i elbow -PRON- way into the throng decide that -PRON- be no place for any one not a fruitgrower and start to elbow -PRON- way out of -PRON- again 
a man collide with -PRON- and the next moment i prick up -PRON- ear at the query what time be -PRON- neighbor 
the voice be husky the man be bleareye and -PRON- ensemble be little well than that of a hoodlum 
by then i have learn to be cautious 
brace -PRON- against the ebb and flow of the human current i draw -PRON- watch from -PRON- vest 
while ostensibly study the face of -PRON- time piece i would scrutinize the face of -PRON- inter locutor 
if wariness could help -PRON- i would not place -PRON- in a false position again 
while i be debate whether i should give -PRON- inquirer the right time or the countersign -PRON- solve the que a art to ur tion by seize -PRON- watch and vanish into the crowd 
stop thief 
i shout and attempt pursuit 
on account of the jam however a successful pursuit be impossible 
after i have overturn half a dozen pedestrian and have be toss back and forth like a waterlogge hulk in the current i give up attempt to recover the watch and draw out of the press into the lady entrance of the hotel 
while i stand there pant and bewail -PRON- loss a cab push up to the curb and a lady alight 
-PRON- be a stout lady beyond middle age and with a motherly face 
-PRON- be neatly gown in black and -PRON- bonnet prove -PRON- a widow in mourning 
the cabby dismount from -PRON- box and hand -PRON- passenger an oldfashione carpetbag 
the hotel attach who look after the lady en trance be nowhere to be see and the stout lady survey the current of humanity between -PRON- and the hotel door with dismay 
that be a busy day with the cabby and -PRON- hurriedly mount -PRON- box and drive away leav e -PRON- fare on the curb 
i cease deplore the a a to loss of -PRON- watch descend the pair of step that lead to the lady entrance and push -PRON- way through the stream of fruitgrower 
do -PRON- wish to get into the hotel madam say halt at the stout ladys side 
-PRON- lift -PRON- motherly face to -PRON- forlornly hopeful 
if -PRON- please mister -PRON- answer a breath less catch in -PRON- voice 
sake alive what an awful crowd 
i take -PRON- carpetbag and request -PRON- to take -PRON- arm 
presently -PRON- gain the pair of marble step and mount to the hotel door all right now maam i observe in a cheery tone return the carpetbag much oblige to -PRON- say -PRON- grate fully be a long time since i be in a big town like this and that fluster with the noise and bustle i hardly know whether afoot or horseback 
could -PRON- -PRON- falter and a scared look cross -PRON- face 
if i can do anything more for -PRON- i say command -PRON- 
what time be -PRON- 
a a to four -PRON- gaze fixedly at -PRON- 
about eleven oclock i return wonder at -PRON- stare and -PRON- odd manner 
disappointment run through the line of -PRON- face 
thank -PRON- -PRON- say and turn away 
then i have a most amazing thought 
-PRON- may be a quarter to four i call after -PRON- 
by then -PRON- back be toward -PRON- and -PRON- be halfthrough the door 
the carpetbag drop and -PRON- clutch at the ornate doorknob to sup port -PRON- 
another moment and i be beside -PRON- again -PRON- find the other -PRON- ask 
not yet i answer 
in an hour be in one of the parlor on the second floor 
will -PRON- meet -PRON- there 
certainly say be mrs sarah brackett -PRON- add hesi tatingly offer -PRON- hand 
and i be robert lorry i answer take the hand encouragingly 
i pick up the carpetbag for -PRON- and -PRON- van a a ter to ishe into the marble corridor 
so here be one of -PRON- filibuster 
i want to laugh at find -PRON- so far afield but be too deeply mystified to treat the matter lightly 
what could i possibly have in common with that elderly lady 
there be no use bombard -PRON- with mental question 
the more i speculate the farther i find -PRON- at sea 
pass through the lady entrance i trav erse the corridor cross the receptionroom and ultimately gain the rotunda 
there i hunt out an unoccupied chair throw -PRON- in to -PRON- and continue -PRON- reflection 
this initial success be follow quickly by another 
while busy with -PRON- thought -PRON- eye absently follow the people who be come and go around -PRON- 
a young man fix -PRON- passive attention 
-PRON- be slight of form with carroty hair buttermilk eye and a wisp of down on -PRON- upper lip 
-PRON- forehead and chin be of the retreat variety give -PRON- face a birdlike contour in fact as -PRON- flutter about the rotunda -PRON- remind -PRON- of a nervous tomtit 
a arter to -PRON- -PRON- narrow chest and thin leg be incase in garment of an ultrafashionable sort 
-PRON- wear lightyellow glove lightyellow spat and carry a rattan cane 
the young man belong to a class that have never appeal to -PRON- 
yet curiosity pull -PRON- out of -PRON- reflection as i watch -PRON- 
begin at one end of a row of lounger -PRON- would flutter to the other end of the row halt e at every third man to bend over and say some thing 
when -PRON- pass on the lounger would exchange look and significant grin and a fore head would be tap suggestively 
the young man work -PRON- way nearer to where i sit 
presently -PRON- come close enough so i could hear what -PRON- be say 
-PRON- be ask the time of day go about the work with systematic thoroughness and with utter disregard for appearance 
i get up step over to -PRON- and take -PRON- by the arm 
-PRON- friend say have -PRON- find any one yet who tell -PRON- that -PRON- be a quarter to four 
find -PRON- gasp 
by jove 
-PRON- shift the rattan from -PRON- right to -PRON- left hand and drop the right hand on -PRON- arm 
a a ter to four fancy -PRON- go on with a vacuous grin think -PRON- may be a joke 
as i gaze at -PRON- and think of the elderly lady upstairs in the parlor i be not altogether certain that -PRON- be not still a joke 
have -PRON- find the other two -PRON- whis pere explosively have find one of -PRON- i answer have work -PRON- way through the rotunda this far -PRON- proceed and suppose -PRON- keep on 
-PRON- go to the right and go to the left so no i return firmly before -PRON- be half do an officer would be call in and -PRON- would be car rie off to some institution for the feebleminded 
what be -PRON- name -PRON- friend 
chauncey vandeleur 
and your 
robert lorry say lorry what s -PRON- all about 
i havenot the least idea donot -PRON- know 
neither have i respond dryly 
come upstairs with -PRON- and introduce -PRON- to the third person of -PRON- distinguished quartet 
but i say -PRON- demur get to find the fourth 
a a to four the three of -PRON- will discuss that point i go on 
if this be really a joke i want to make sure of -PRON- and wash -PRON- hand of the entire matter 
chauncey vandeleur follow -PRON- to the ele vator 
when -PRON- reach the secondfloor parlor -PRON- find mrs sarah brackett in animate con versation with a young ladya slend hand some girl of twentytwo or twentythree 
as vandeleur and i come close mrs brackett start up with a look of undisguised pleasure 
mr lorry -PRON- exclaim 
let -PRON- make -PRON- acquaint with miss zelda anstruther 
i just ask -PRON- what time -PRON- be and -PRON- tell -PRON- here the elderly ladys voice sink to an awe some -PRON- be a quarter to four 
the color mount to miss cheek as i gaze at -PRON- 
by jove chirrup vandeleur 
this be what i call luck donot -PRON- know 
instantly i revise -PRON- opinion as to the whole affair be a joke 
the beautiful miss an struther -PRON- may be be responsible for the re vision 
an odd enterprise 
this mysterious business have nothing to do with filibustering that be sure 
a motherly old lady a fair slip of a girl a youth with a simian facial anglethese three be out of any picture that have a background of lawlessness on the high sea or in the southern americas 
the thought come to -PRON- that -PRON- be a set of pinktea conspirator bring together perhaps to plan a missionary campaign on the mosquito coast 
yet even so miss hazel eye reconcile -PRON- to whatever the fate hold in i present vandeleur 
mrs brackett eye -PRON- indulgently and sympathetically miss an struther with curiosity and some small amount of tolerance 
vandeleur and i seat -PRON- 
find that -PRON- be alone in the parlor -PRON- at once go into executive session 
-PRON- have be strangely bring together page a a to four say in pursuance of some design of whose nature i have not the slight knowledge 
can any of -PRON- enlighten -PRON- 
silence follow the query 
four pair of eye fence anxiously and fall in disappointment havenot the least notion what -PRON- all about mr lorry speak up mrs sarah brackett from emmetsburg ioway -PRON- and come on here because a lawyer by the name of cart wright advise -PRON- to 
mr cartwright couldnot tell -PRON- much 
-PRON- just hand -PRON- two hundred dollar say i be to be at the palace hotel in san francisco on the twentyfifth and go around ask what time -PRON- be until i have find three who say -PRON- be a quarter to four 
i havenot trav ele a great deal and i hate anything that s not free and aboveboard so i think long and hard before i conclude to take the trip 
mr cart wright say better come 
-PRON- know -PRON- hus band ezry and -PRON- boy tom and -PRON- s always be a good friend to -PRON- mr cartwright have 
the wrinkle lip quiver and the faded blue eye grow frankly tearful 
miss anstruther draw -PRON- chair closer to mrs and take one of -PRON- hand in both -PRON- own 
a a to four havenot get ezry no more and i havenot get tom continue mrs brackett lean toward the girl just a poor old woman with neither chick nor child i can call -PRON- own and i havenot enough money to hardly keep -PRON- out of the coun ty house 
that two hundred dollar look like a small fortune to -PRON- and i hate to spend -PRON- on what may turn out a wildgoose chase to san francisco 
but mr cartwright say come and keep say -PRON- and i didnot make up -PRON- mind till the last minute here now and thank ful to know i didnot have much trouble ask that foolish question and get the foolish an swer 
i wonder if -PRON- all feel about -PRON- like i do miss anstruther press the wrinkled hand -PRON- be hold be sure i do mrs brackett say -PRON- have wait in this parlor all morning without courage to put the question 
when -PRON- come and ask -PRON- the time i feel as though i be go to faint 
-PRON- smile a little and barely glance in -PRON- direction 
yet -PRON- go on see how easily -PRON- meeting have come about 
-PRON- find -PRON- and mr lorry find mr vandeleur and a a ter to bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
-PRON- have come from iowa mrs brackett but i have come all the way from new york and i hadand still have for that matteras little confidence in the outcome as -PRON- have -PRON- 
-PRON- experience be similar to -PRON- too lawyer write and request -PRON- to call upon -PRON- 
-PRON- give -PRON- two hundred dollar tell -PRON- substantially what -PRON- lawyer tell -PRON- and i be several day consider the matter 
i be stenographer for a law firm in liberty hay 
i lay the matter before mr and -PRON- advise -PRON- to follow the tip as -PRON- call -PRON- and see what -PRON- amount to 
if the business come to nothing i be to return to new york and have -PRON- old place back 
thereupon i give -PRON- experience which paral lele those of mrs brackett and miss an struther 
then -PRON- three direct -PRON- glance at vandeleur 
deucedly odd exclaim the young man with a smirk at miss anstruther which cause that young lady to avert -PRON- eye live right here in frisco donot -PRON- know and get a letter from a lawyer chap just like miss anstruther a arter to four and mr lorry 
i call on -PRON- and be jolly well surprised when -PRON- hand -PRON- a wad of greenback and tell -PRON- to call at the palace on the twentyfifth and go around ask different people what time -PRON- be 
here -PRON- all be though and what s to be do 
the buttermilk eye fix -PRON- on -PRON- shrewdly 
do any of -PRON- receive a seal envelope 
i inquire 
all of -PRON- have be wary -PRON- seem and have hold the matter of the seal envelope back wait e for a cue to mention -PRON- 
straightway four envelope identically alike be bring into view 
no doubt i proceed these envelope have an important bearing upon the case 
-PRON- lawyer instruct -PRON- that the envelope be to be open when -PRON- four come together 
mr cartwright say the same thing an nounced mrs brackett 
and so do the lawyer i visit in new york aver miss anstruther 
-PRON- instruction be different say vande leur 
as soon as -PRON- find each other the law a a to four yer here say -PRON- be to call on -PRON- and -PRON- would tell -PRON- what to do with -PRON- envelope 
i reflect upon this point 
-PRON- be the only de tail in which -PRON- legal adviser have differ 
who be -PRON- lawyer mr vandeleur 
i in terrogate 
mr price of price green garnett 
be -PRON- office far from here 
not more than two block 
would -PRON- be likely to find -PRON- in -PRON- office now call -PRON- up on the phone mr lorry and see if -PRON- be there 
-PRON- soon find that mr price be in -PRON- of fice and would receive -PRON- so -PRON- leave the hotel -PRON- be mediately and call on -PRON- 
the lawyer be a big florid man and meet -PRON- with a grim smile 
vandeleur introduce -PRON- and mr price offer -PRON- chair and close the door of -PRON- private room 
-PRON- all have -PRON- envelope -PRON- ask 
-PRON- produce the envelope 
very good -PRON- go on keep -PRON- carefully and do not let -PRON- get out of -PRON- possession for a minute 
if one be lose this whole proceeding would result in a fiasco 
i can not tell -PRON- what the business be a a to four because i do not know 
naturally however i be conversant with a few detail and i know that a matter of prime importance be for -PRON- to hold fast to -PRON- envelope 
i have -PRON- on the good authority that this will mean much to -PRON- perhaps a fortune fortune murmur mrs brackett start e upright in -PRON- chair fortune echo miss anstruther staring 
by jove exclaim vandeleur 
i smile skeptically 
rather an odd way to distribute a fortune donot -PRON- think mr price say oh yes -PRON- answer but indirect method may be necessary 
-PRON- four be to charter a sea go vessel man and provision for a long voyage 
when -PRON- be three day out on a west erly course -PRON- will hold a private conference on the boat and open -PRON- envelope 
-PRON- content will give -PRON- -PRON- destination and other needful instruction 
charter a vessel 
i cry startle 
embark for a long voyage with only the content of four unopened envelope to warrant the undertaking 
mr price wave -PRON- hand admit -PRON- be ask a a to four e a good deal of four people bring together in the strange way that -PRON- have be -PRON- vouch safed 
however -PRON- may be in -PRON- power to give -PRON- more confidence in the undertaking 
-PRON- take a paper from a pigeonhole in -PRON- desk and slowly open -PRON- 
do any of -PRON- know a person name arthur mayhew -PRON- ask 
-PRON- be -PRON- cousin i speak up 
archibald anstruther pursue the lawyer 
-PRON- brother falter miss anstruther 
-PRON- be in the army andand disappear 
thomas brackett intone the lawyer son murmur mrs brackett fumble for -PRON- blackbordered handkerchief 
-PRON- be a soldier too and kill in chiny 
leastways -PRON- hasnot be hear of for moren a year andand give -PRON- up 
eugene trent continue the lawyer 
by jove cry vandeleur mine 
an uncle of a fat lot i ever care for -PRON- 
if -PRON- charter a boat and put to sea say mr price the four i have mention will be -PRON- authority for so do 
-PRON- will know bet a a to four ter than i whether -PRON- would have any intent to deceive -PRON- or to cause -PRON- needless expense 
mrs brackett and miss anstruther have -PRON- handkerchief to -PRON- eye 
vandeleur be ab sently roll a cigarette 
i sit in -PRON- chair with a bewilder brain 
where be the money to come from for char tere the boat mr price 
i inquire 
-PRON- four will have to settle that question among -PRON- -PRON- respond 
no fund have be deposit for that purpose havenot a penny come tremulously from mrs brackett but if i be to go somewhere and find -PRON- boy tom i will find a way 
so will declare miss anstruther with fine determination if -PRON- brother be call for -PRON- to come to -PRON- 
uncle gene can go to ballyhack for all of -PRON- grumble vandeleur havenot a cent to pay for a seavoyage anyhow 
-PRON- say some thing about a fortune mr price 
by jove that s a different proposition from go -PRON- blind to find uncle gene 
there be a big reward in the business for all a a to four of -PRON- reassure the lawyer provide -PRON- follow -PRON- up 
what be -PRON- to do 
miss anstruther put the question and all eye appear to focus on -PRON- 
-PRON- shall find a way say -PRON- will go back to the hotel for luncheon and discuss way and mean immediately afterward 
-PRON- have nothing more to tell -PRON- mr price 
not a thing except to say that i wish -PRON- all the good luck imaginable 
i start out with the other but the lawyer call -PRON- back 
when -PRON- and i be alone and with the door close -PRON- take -PRON- by a button con fidentially 
-PRON- original instruction contemplate the opening of the envelope in the hotel here do -PRON- not mr lorry -PRON- query 
yes i answer take -PRON- upon -PRON- to change that 
van deleur i find have not a very good character 
all this complicated machinery which -PRON- think so odd and uncalled for be ingeniously devise to keep one of -PRON- four from obtain an advan tage over the other and use -PRON- unfairly 
if the a a to four envelope be open at sea vandeleur if so dis pose can do nothing to backcap -PRON- plan 
do -PRON- rise to that think so say there be two estimable lady in -PRON- party if i be any judge of character and -PRON- will fall upon -PRON- mr lorry as the most able and re sourceful to safeguard the lady interest 
keep an eye on vandeleur that s all 
-PRON- have nothing more to tell mepri vately 
no 
i wish on -PRON- soul that i know more but i donot 
do -PRON- know of any one who would care to advance money for charter a ship receive back twice over the amount invest 
once more -PRON- smile grimly do not -PRON- return 
-PRON- would be a pre carious investment this put up expense for a quartet of rainbowchaser 
but -PRON- say never mind what i say 
i read off to -PRON- certain name and those name impress the four of -PRON- 
-PRON- and -PRON- three companion know the person name and that should give a a to four -PRON- confidence but -PRON- would hardly impress an outsider 
with that -PRON- bid -PRON- a good day and i leave -PRON- office 
i have be sadly tangle on leave the chamber of commerce building after -PRON- inter view with mr benson but that state of mind wasnot a circumstance to the one i carry with -PRON- on leave mr price 
an unexpected assault 
this then be the condition of affair to go forward in the strange business that have bring -PRON- to san francisco -PRON- must have moneyenough to charter a boat for a long cruise 
-PRON- starchamber session in the parlor of the palace hotel immediately after luncheon de velope the very important fact that vandeleur have no fund and no credit 
from what mrs brackett have say indirectly i know that -PRON- could be of no financial help and miss anstruther assure -PRON- tearfully that -PRON- be in like circum that place the brunt of -PRON- at -PRON- door and send -PRON- thought eastward to uncle rufu and to -PRON- patrimony that have be gather bulk through the year 
should i hazard -PRON- all on a lawyer word that -PRON- cousin arthur mayhew vouch for the enterprise 
i have never see arthur mayhew more than a art to once in -PRON- life 
-PRON- have live in the middle west whither -PRON- relative on the spindle side have emigrate and a wellearned reputation for be wild have restrain uncle rufu from invite -PRON- to great barrington 
when i be seventeen however arthur drop in on -PRON- without an invitation 
-PRON- be two year -PRON- senior have beat -PRON- way over a good part of the world and i like -PRON- -PRON- be mensely 
but -PRON- be a good deal of a rake and uncle rufu pack -PRON- off before -PRON- have be with -PRON- a fortnight 
the instinct of a soldier of fortune push -PRON- toward the risk 
what be a few thousand compare with an adventure that promise ex citement and much gain 
that would draw miss anstruther and -PRON- into close companionship for several month 
this latter consideration have a good deal of weight with -PRON- 
from what little i have see of the girl i like -PRON- immensely 
-PRON- be of course take the word of mr price for everything 
and mr price be not only as ignorant as -PRON- of the object of the a a to four undertaking but -PRON- optimism would not carry -PRON- the length of take stock in -PRON- 
by some psychological turn mrs brackett and miss anstruther have form the conviction that the former son and the latter brother be to be find at the end of this weird coil 
hence -PRON- be feverishly eager to embark and put to accord to vandeleur eugene trent be skipper of the brigantine ga aelle 
-PRON- be a shady mariner and although san francisco be -PRON- home port the gazelle have not be see in the bay for three year 
vandeleur would have tramp barefoot around the world to get any money uncle gene have leave but -PRON- would not have walk around the block to discover whether uncle gene be alive or dead 
before -PRON- afternoon conference come to an end i offer to charter and provision a small seagoing boat if one could be have on reasonable term 
i add however that -PRON- would possibly be a fortnight before i could get at -PRON- money and suggest that -PRON- remove to some respect able but less pretentious hotel where the charge a a ter to four would be more in keep with -PRON- circum miss anstruther look -PRON- gratitude and mrs brackett catch -PRON- hand and thank -PRON- tremulously 
there be a fortune to be gain say miss anstruther and -PRON- three companion would see that i be well repay for the pre liminary outlay 
miss anstruther also suggest that inasmuch as i be to finance the enterprise the entire man agement should be leave in -PRON- hand 
i should be -PRON- leader and -PRON- would trust every detail to -PRON- implicitly 
mrs brackett heartily agree to this but van deleur balk 
i have an idea that -PRON- want to captain -PRON- undertaking -PRON- 
in proof of -PRON- confidence mrs brackett and miss anstruther offer -PRON- -PRON- envelope for safekeepe 
i demur but -PRON- insist 
finally i yield ask only that each write -PRON- name across the flap of the envelope before giv e -PRON- to -PRON- 
vandeleur watch this proceeding with frank disapproval 
then of a sudden -PRON- attitude change and -PRON- aver fulsomely that the lady a a to four have do exactly the right thing 
a man -PRON- as serte be better able to safeguard the important document than a woman and if i could take care of three of the envelope certainly -PRON- could take care of one of -PRON- 
vandeleur state further that -PRON- have some ac quaintance with seafarer of the barbary coast and could introduce -PRON- to just the skip per -PRON- want for -PRON- requirement 
i be like vandeleur less and less the more i see of -PRON- 
i thank -PRON- a bit curtly for -PRON- offer aver that i have some acquaintance on the coast -PRON- and would begin that very evening look for a man to help -PRON- 
that afternoon -PRON- begin lop off expense by remove to a modest but entirely respectable hotel in kearney street and by eight in the eve ning i have start for the waterfront with one logy bill in -PRON- mind eye 
logy bill i suppose stand for about all that be bad in one of the bad quarter of that metropolis 
but i have pull logy bill clear of a stout sailorman arm with a dirk some year before and bill have swear undying friendship on the strength of -PRON- 
a a ter to i know logy bill could help -PRON- find a proper skipper and a proper boat 
-PRON- positive power for evil be as great as -PRON- negative power for good and i be go to approach -PRON- on -PRON- negative side 
bill would tell -PRON- which skipper be to be rely on and which be not and from the former class i would pick the man i want 
-PRON- be an early hour for the waterfront yet darkness have settle down and i be sufficiently wary to keep the middle of the road 
hull and mast rise starkly from the mirk that edge the wharf as i reach the front and turn along the coast 
dull light shine through the window of sailorrobbe den but for the most part the den be steep in prophetic silence 
-PRON- would waken into raucous life later on and by that time i hope to have accomplish -PRON- mis sion and to be back to kearney street 
presently i come to the squat little house where i have once sit out a reminiscent evening and smoke half a dozen pipe with logy bill 
mount the gloomy veranda i rap on the door 
the summon be answer by a frowsy look chinaman 
a arter to mr william at home 
i inquire 
lamplight from somewhere back of the china man cast a glow over the veranda 
the slant eye give -PRON- a catlike sizing 
what manner fashion -PRON- come hey in quire the domestic with elaborate care 
why -PRON- wantee logy bill 
-PRON- all same friend savvy 
be bill in the house

no can tell 
will -PRON- be back soon can tell makee onepiecee papertalk -PRON- givee bill 
savvy 
can do 
with that i scribble a line on the blank leaf of a notebook request logy bill to call on -PRON- at -PRON- kearney street headquarters the fol lowing morning 
the chinaman take the note and close the door and i stumble from the ve randa halfblinde by the sudden shutting off of the lamplight 
a a to four twenty foot bring -PRON- opposite the mouth of an alley 
-PRON- eyesight clear suddenly and i be come aware that a man have leap out of the blackness of the alley and be stand in front of -PRON- 
the fellow stand stiffly erect bar -PRON- path 
without a word i attempt to go around -PRON- but -PRON- shift -PRON- position 
what do -PRON- want 
i demand 
for answer -PRON- right fist dart toward -PRON- 
expect a hostile move i jump back and evade the fist 
thereupon two arm go around -PRON- from be hind pin -PRON- hand to -PRON- body 
the en circle arm be like steel and the pressure -PRON- exert drive the breath from -PRON- lung 
on leave kearney street i have have the fore thought to slip a revolver into -PRON- pocket but the attack from behind have come before i could get at the weapon 
instantly i begin a fierce strug gle kick at -PRON- captor shin and wriggle like an eel to free -PRON- 
git the letter come a husky and impatient voice from behind three of -PRON- 
be thus apprise of the object of the at a a to four tack -PRON- desperate struggle become more fierce and determined 
i yell as i fight 
the man behind curse -PRON- roundly 
put a stopper on be jawtackle -PRON- pant 
look alive now a cleancut smashing blow on the side of -PRON- face daze -PRON- 
-PRON- limb go limp for a few moment and i lie like a sack of meal in the arm that hold -PRON- 
the man in front bent over fumble at the breast of -PRON- coat 
strength rush back to -PRON- then and i lift -PRON- foot and plant -PRON- in the pit of the fellow stomach 
the rogue fall away staggering and catch -PRON- breath 
the other man fling -PRON- to the ground with an oath and i see -PRON- jerk a knife from -PRON- pocket 
before the knife could fall a third form lurch out of the darkness and i hear the sodden impact of a fist follow by the clatter of a blade on the stone 
a timely arrival 
i be on -PRON- knee when the two who have at tack -PRON- pull -PRON- together and take to -PRON- heel 
the man whose timely appearance have turn the tide come close and lift -PRON- to -PRON- foot tight squeak mate -PRON- volunteer but thing like that be happenin here continual 
well if -PRON- isnot logy bill -PRON- 
i ex claim recognize the hairy thickset dump ling of a man who be range alongside of -PRON- think be square now bill i add gro pe for -PRON- breast pocket and make sure the three envelope be safe 
dash if -PRON- ainot bob lorry 
william thrust out -PRON- hand 
whenever do -PRON- blow into frisco lorry 
and whatever be ye do around here go back to -PRON- house bill and tell -PRON- a little business on hand and want -PRON- a a to -PRON- help 
in fact i be just leave -PRON- place when those two swab run afoul of -PRON- 
do -PRON- lift any plunder belong to -PRON- 
no -PRON- arrive in time to prevent that 
lucky thing for -PRON- that -PRON- stow -PRON- glad i happen around 
-PRON- be that yell o yourn that fetch -PRON- 
william be usually a man of slow and de liberate movement as befit one of -PRON- build but -PRON- have be quick enough that night 
-PRON- get back in the house and the chinaman bring a wet towel for -PRON- bruised face and serve -PRON- with cigar -PRON- also gravely present -PRON- mas ter with the note i have leave 
william spell the write word through carefully 
by come when i do -PRON- remark reckon i save -PRON- a trip to kearney street 
-PRON- do more than that bill i aver -PRON- keep -PRON- out of the morgue as maybe lorry 
ye know the rope hereabout so -PRON- sort o humorous seeing ye catch like that 
-PRON- idea of humor doesnot exactly jibe with -PRON- own bill i laugh 
a arter to four for half an hour -PRON- chat on various gen eral topic and then as -PRON- light fresh cigar i broach the business i have in mind 
what i want bill say be to charter a good seaworthy little boat 
the skipper must be straight and a man i can depend on 
the sort o skipper i deal with be genrally a bit offcolor -PRON- grin although the good of -PRON- donot object to a shanghaied man or two in the focsle 
where be this craft ye want to go wonot be able to tell that until be two or three day at sea 
-PRON- look at -PRON- with -PRON- bulletlike eye atwinkle 
and still yere after a good clean skipper

how long a vyage -PRON- ask speculatively

two be lady and i want good accommodation for -PRON- 
-PRON- raise -PRON- bushy eyebrow and give -PRON- a queer look 
when i say lady i go on mean ex actly that reckon -PRON- know -PRON- business lorry and i ainot no hand to pry into thing as donot con cern -PRON- but petticoat be pretty much in the way on everything but liner and yacht 
small boat like what -PRON- want not have no passenger li cense these here ladiesll sign on as stewardess i take -PRON- and -PRON- and toth man will go as fourth and fifth mate 
something like that i suppose easy fix 
the lady be along that ought to satisfy any skipper -PRON- ainot up to anything unlawful 
still -PRON- a handicap leav a a to four e port without know where -PRON- be bind the paper read 
-PRON- can read honolulu 
-PRON- head westerly on leave the gate send -PRON- some one in a day or two 
-PRON- can take the skipper measure hire -PRON- if -PRON- want to and if -PRON- donot want to turn -PRON- down and have another try 
in this way that part of the business be set tled 
i stay with william an hour longer and when i leave -PRON- friend accompany -PRON- as far as market street 
late as -PRON- be when i get back to the hotel i write and post a letter to uncle rufu re quest an immediate draft for the fund of mine which -PRON- have in -PRON- keeping 
then when i turn in i give serious thought to the principal event of the evening 
two man have waylay -PRON- and make an attempt to get the three envelope i be carry in -PRON- pocket 
how do those two man know i have the enve lope and why be the attack make 
there be but a single answer embrace in the one word vandeleur 
beyond all doubt a arter to four chauncey vandeleur be prove true to mr estimate of -PRON- 
i recall sudden change of front after mrs brackett and miss anstruther have pass -PRON- -PRON- envelope 
then and there be bear -PRON- design to secure the three document at one stroke add the three to the fourth which -PRON- -PRON- carry and thus have the entire matter in -PRON- own hand 
vandeleur have be quick to act 
i would not have believe that -PRON- retreat forehead hide so much resourcefulness 
courage in the deed there be none merely a snakelike craftiness in persuade other to -PRON- lawless will 
yes vandeleur be a man to be reckon with 
whatever the seabusiness that be to claim -PRON- attention clearly -PRON- would take the content of the four envelope to make -PRON- understandable 
one envelope would not do nor two envelope nor three 
the mystery be divide in quarter quarter make the whole and the whole would give the solution 
in that hour i give mental deference to the one who have devise the scheme for give each a a ter to four of -PRON- four what may be -PRON- just due 
to suc ceed -PRON- must all work together 
-PRON- would be impossible for -PRON- to call vande leur to account for the night work 
if -PRON- need -PRON- envelope -PRON- be none the less true that -PRON- need -PRON- envelope 
no the fellow must be bear with somehow until the four envelope have work out the theoretical part of -PRON- prob lem 
during the practical demonstration of -PRON- i could handle -PRON- without glove 
perhaps -PRON- be three oclock when i go to sleep 
if i be not mistaken that be the hour chime by a distant bell before i doze off 
when i awake -PRON- be a bluff knock on the door that bring -PRON- upright in -PRON- bed 
the sun flood the room and in a moment that far away clock begin toll the hour 
-PRON- last wake memory be of that bell 
i count the stroke one two three and so on up to eleven 
evidently i have secure -PRON- proper allotment of sleep 
the last echo of the bell be take up by re peated clamor at the door there 
i demand get -PRON- foot on the floor 
boy from the office sir come the response 
a arter to gentleman to see wait down stair 
who be -PRON- 
captain golden sir 
-PRON- say mr william send -PRON- 
tell captain golden that be down in a few minute say logy bill have be active enough in find a skipper for -PRON- 
captain golden eh 
i say to -PRON- as i get into -PRON- clothe 
that name be a good oman for a quartet of fortunehunter i must say 
a search for a ship 
when i reach the office the boy lead -PRON- to an corner where captain gold en be wait 
-PRON- be puff at one of those long crudely roll weed which pass by the name of stogie 
as i approach -PRON- pull the stogy from between -PRON- tooth and get slowly to -PRON- foot 
i find -PRON- some six foot of a man in a dingy cap wear blue pilotcloth coat with brass but ton dungaree trouser and seaboot 
judge from -PRON- rig -PRON- last voyage have not be pro perous 
the captain and i survey each other as the distance lessen between -PRON- 
follow a first comprehensive look -PRON- eye seek -PRON- face and dwelt there 
-PRON- be a lean strong face brown and weather beat as become a man of the sea 
a green patch cover the left eye 
the other eye be steelblue and glisteningkeen enough appar a a ter to four ently to do service for -PRON- and -PRON- defunct mate 
in the forehead above the green patch there be a dent not at all pretty to look at 
a red torpedo beard bristle from the low jaw 
the hair overlong and fringe the bottom of the cap be of even a more pronounced red than the beard 
red hair for fighter be -PRON- mental com ment not difficult to account for that miss e eye or the concavity above -PRON- 
then aloud captain golden 
i query 
the same -PRON- return extend a hand that carry but three finger and a thumb 
mr robert lorry i take -PRON- 
exactly 
i look around 
the boy have disappear and -PRON- could be quite by -PRON- in the corner 
i draw up a chair as the skipper seat -PRON- 
-PRON- come from mr william i understand the idea as the man say 
-PRON- say -PRON- want to hire a boat do 
what sort of a boat have -PRON- 
the lady may finest twosticker that ever sail out o frisco 
jam er on the wind an 7o a a to four shell show -PRON- heel to anything under canvas as the man say -PRON- size 
hunnerd an fifty ton 
where be -PRON- 
alongside pier twelve on the front -PRON- condition 
j be clean paint an overhauled 
everything spick an span from truck to keelson 
-PRON- be sealin last trip but shell never go agin 
i be two month gettin the smell out o -PRON- as sweet as a rose now an i ainot afeare to show er to nobody pay -PRON- a visit at one oclock captain 
if the boat suit -PRON- well go into matter a little and perhaps -PRON- can do business answer captain golden 
pi twelve be the place and -PRON- will find -PRON- aboard when -PRON- get there 
-PRON- touch a match to the end of -PRON- stogy get under weigh and roll the length of the office and out at the door 
-PRON- talk fair enough and have the look of a skipper who know how to do thing 
have miss breakfast i be among the a a ter to four first to go in to dinner when the diningroom door be throw open 
style and a scale of price to match make all the difference between a light repast at noon and a square meal and what be luncheon at the palace be a regular dinner there in kearney street 
i have finish and leave the hotel before mrs brackett and miss anstruther come into the di ningroom 
-PRON- be just as well 
when i next see the lady perhaps i could report that a skip per and a boat have be secure 
i have no difficulty in pick up the lady may even before i have see the gilt letter across the stern 
-PRON- lie at -PRON- mooring softly rub -PRON- fender against the plank 
approach from the south and before turn e upon the pier i be able to take in the craft length and height along the starboard side 
-PRON- be dazzlingly fresh in a coat of new paint -PRON- deck be scrub to snowy whiteness -PRON- stay whip and tarred mast and boom new slush brasswork glittering and all run gear coil down trimly 
from stem to taffrail i should judge that -PRON- measure full ninety foot 
-PRON- have a bow like a a a ter to four knifes edge and a run that seem incapable of draw a bucketful of dead water after -PRON- in a day sail 
-PRON- mast be rake and so high that i think the schooner must be crank 
a glance at the beam however dispel the impression 
i stroll along and gain the pier -PRON- gaze still travel over the boat 
i be already in love with -PRON- and hope in -PRON- soul that captain golden and i may come to term 
-PRON- good girl mr lorry call a voice 
what do -PRON- think o -PRON- 
i look around and see the skipper stand at the top of a gangplank aft as pretty as a belle in -PRON- good bib and tucker i answer heartily 
-PRON- be a gentleman yacht once before -PRON- fall into -PRON- hand an took to trading 
come aboard sir be over -PRON- with a tooth brush an shell stand close inspection 
i cross the plank and captain golden lead -PRON- to the focsle where the inspection begin 
the be a commodious place with twelve bunkssix on a side in two tier -PRON- complement captain 
i inquire 
a a ter to ur master mate six hand cook an cabinboy 
on -PRON- way aft from the -PRON- have a look in at the galley and then descend the after companion to the cabin 
this latter room be a marvel of maple gilt and mahogany 
the captain room and mate room open off the port side of the cabin while two door to starboard lead to stateroom 
the stateroom naturally be small yet each be neatly fur nishe and have double berth 
such an undue proportion of cabin space for ward and aft bespoke the yacht 
as the captain and i seat -PRON- for a business talk i no tice a rack against the cabin bulkhead with half a dozen wincester rifle well armed captain golden i ob serve -PRON- gaze drop from the rack to the skipper glitter blue eye 
as the man say -PRON- answer with a slight grin always well for the afterguard to be prepare for emergency 
i never go hunt for trouble but -PRON- can bet always prepare an donot dodge any 
do logy bill tell -PRON- anything about the sort of cruise be go to start on 
a a to four nary a whisper 
where be -PRON- go and how long do -PRON- expect to be go donot know where i be blue eye flicker and halfclosedand consequently i canot tell how long well be go 
most remarkable be dry response 
do -PRON- happen to know mr lorry whether -PRON- business be straight or crooked 
i straighten stiffly 
beggin -PRON- pardon an no offense mean go on golden 
mayhap -PRON- know logy reputation 
-PRON- send -PRON- to forget that honest work captain golden say i sharply 
boat have sail under seal order before i take -PRON- and havenot do anything pi ratical either 
seal order -PRON- exclaim suck in -PRON- breath and -PRON- eye glimmering 
so that s the lay of -PRON- hey 
when do -PRON- open -PRON- order 
three day westward of the gate different 
i draw the line at pearlin among jap island or smuggling chink or pop pyjuice into the state or arm an ammunition out of -PRON- 
if -PRON- straight good and only a mat a a to four ter o learn -PRON- destination three day out why as the man say -PRON- huckleberry 
long vyage 
several month possibly 
that suit -PRON- uncommon 
the long the time the big the lay 
any passenger besides -PRON- 
three two of -PRON- ladie 
-PRON- jump at that and begin to look dubious 
mebby -PRON- know how -PRON- be at sea mr lorry -PRON- observe 
now an agin -PRON- have to use lan guage which the hand understand 
think the ladiesll object to that 
give -PRON- personally all the consideration -PRON- can say and i think -PRON- will be satisfied 
this point cover -PRON- fall to debate term 
at the end of half an hour -PRON- have reach an agreement 
i be to give captain golden one hundred and fifty dollar a month for the use of the boat pay the wage of master mate and crew pay for tow pilotage harbordue and other inciden tal provision the craft for six month and hand over one thousand dollar advancemoney inside of two week 
nothing further be to be do a a ter to four by captain golden until the preliminary payment be in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- look askance at the delay until i ex plain that the money be to come from the east 
-PRON- drain a glass to the success of -PRON- cruise and part good friend 
i be mightily pleased and try to find will iams and learn something about past history but william be abroad and i turn -PRON- step toward kearney street 
when i get back to the hotel i find vande leur wait for -PRON- in the office 
-PRON- come for ward handle -PRON- cane nervously and with something like anxiety in -PRON- shifty eye 
dis semble -PRON- real feeling i greet -PRON- amiably have a suggestion to make mr lorry say -PRON- seemingly relieve by -PRON- show of friendli what be -PRON- 
suppose -PRON- give -PRON- those three envelope and let -PRON- take all four over to mr office and have -PRON- put -PRON- in -PRON- safe 
-PRON- be artlessly say 
the fellow simplicity may have deceive -PRON- have -PRON- not be for the event of the night before 
a art to four those envelope be as safe in -PRON- pocket as -PRON- be in mr safe mr vandeleur i assure -PRON- shall always go armed -PRON- know i finish drop -PRON- voice while i have -PRON- about -PRON- 
i know how to shoot too if any one try foul play 
-PRON- face pale a little and the rattan quiver in -PRON- yellowgloved hand 
-PRON- next move be a puzzle 
reach into the breast of -PRON- coat -PRON- take out -PRON- envelope 
for a moment -PRON- hold -PRON- and look at -PRON- then present -PRON- to -PRON- 
if get the right of this thing mr lorry -PRON- say one envelope be of no earthly use with out the other three 
-PRON- may just as well keep the lot 
if the lady can trust -PRON- i ought to be able to 
all right mr vandeleur i acquiesce if -PRON- want -PRON- that way 
-PRON- will open -PRON- -PRON- hesitate per hap wonder whether i would take -PRON- upon -PRON- to get at the content of the envelope at once 
when -PRON- have be three day at sea say again -PRON- appear relieved 
a a to four have -PRON- do anything toward get a boat -PRON- inquire have charter the lady may a hundred schooner captain nathan golden 
-PRON- head be bent and -PRON- be rap -PRON- cane aimlessly against one of -PRON- shoe 
do -PRON- know anything about captain gold en -PRON- go on 
-PRON- come to -PRON- well recommend and cer tainly -PRON- schooner be all that -PRON- could desire 
relief again 
vandeleur have not the knack of hide -PRON- feeling 
how long do -PRON- think -PRON- will be before -PRON- get to sea 
some time within two week 
with that i excuse -PRON- and go up to -PRON- room 
vandeleur be a riddle and i want to get away by -PRON- while i give some thought to -PRON- particular case 
once inside -PRON- room i lock the door throw off coat and vest fill and light a pipe and lay the four mysterious envelope on a table 
vandeleur i know as well as i know that i be alive be back of that attempt to get the three envelope away from -PRON- 
fail in that -PRON- have a art to just come at -PRON- schoolboy fashion with the re quest that i give -PRON- the envelope to take to mr price for safekeeping 
and when -PRON- have fail in that -PRON- have give -PRON- -PRON- own document to keep with the other 
bend over the envelope i compare -PRON- 
-PRON- be all of a size identical in color and ap parently make out of the same kind of paper 
yet there be a differencehard to detect but -PRON- do not escape -PRON- 
the three envelope be long to mrs brackett miss anstruther and -PRON- all bear the same watermark vande leur envelope bear another 
now i may have be well within -PRON- right be honorably dispose and with the inter est of -PRON- companion at heartif i have open the envelope and learn -PRON- destination 
such a proceeding however would have a tendency to discredit -PRON- with mrs brackett and miss an struther besides i hate to trust -PRON- with the knowledge contain in the envelope before -PRON- get to sea 
i go the length however of open van deleur envelope 
-PRON- contain simply a piece of blank paper 
by hold the other envelope be a a to -PRON- tween -PRON- eye and the window i could see that -PRON- hold write enclosure 
vandeleur still have -PRON- original envelope and have try to fool -PRON- by give -PRON- a dummy 
why 
for nothing less i imagine than to parry any suspicion i may cherish against -PRON- on account of that futile night attack 
there be a lack of will show in -PRON- retreat chin and mental de ficiencie may be argue from -PRON- retreat forehead 
nevertheless -PRON- be play a cool game and -PRON- be play -PRON- craftily deliberately and well 
-PRON- cue be to let -PRON- think -PRON- have pull the wool entirely over -PRON- eye 
after the third day out -PRON- would find that i have be keep a rod in pickle for -PRON- 
-PRON- worry concentrate about this one point that vandeleur may in some way let the en velope give -PRON- by mr price get out of -PRON- possession 
if -PRON- hold onto that i be sure i could handle the rest of -PRON- 
seal order 
eight day of uneasiness follow 
mrs and miss serenity be ruffle by the mystery that hedge about -PRON- un dertaking and by a suspense of hope and fear that have mainly to do with -PRON- relative but -PRON- own doubt reach farther and i keep -PRON- in ignorance of the cause 
there be always vandeleur of course to fret -PRON- and as the day passedwithout a letter i be gan to have foreboding about uncle rufu and the fund 
uncle rufu have labor hard to keep -PRON- patrimony intact and conservatively invest yet what if in spite of -PRON- vigilance the money have be invest and lose 
every day i have several hour conversation with mrs brackett and miss anstruther 
to cheer and distract -PRON- thought i take -PRON- for little excursion about the cityto the park to chinatown to the theater to inspect the lady may 
a arter to four i will not deny that i take rare comfort in miss society that i come to look forward to these brief excursion and to enjoy -PRON- in spite of the many matter i have to harass -PRON- 
i have be draw toward miss anstruther from the first and the realization that -PRON- heart be trend inevitably in -PRON- direction come to -PRON- suddenly 
vandeleur likewise pay miss anstruther -PRON- attention 
-PRON- be this fact i think that bring -PRON- to an abrupt understanding of -PRON- own feel ing 
miss anstruther seldom discriminate between vandeleur and -PRON- 
sometimes i be -PRON- escort and vandeleur pilot mrs brackett and some time -PRON- be the other way around 
yet gradu ally and in spite of -PRON- attempt to keep -PRON- hide the breach widen between vandeleur and -PRON- self 
on the evening of the eighth day of -PRON- proba tion in kearney street i receive a letter from uncle rufu and have the satisfaction of find a draft for seven thousand dollar enclose 
the great part of -PRON- worry at once take wing al a a to ur though uncle rufus letter be something to make a man think 
the old gentleman implore -PRON- to leave -PRON- wander life interlard -PRON- supplication with passage from scripture -PRON- admonish -PRON- not to waste -PRON- substance in risk and adventure but to settle down engage in some christian business and make -PRON- a credit to the community which should finally claim -PRON- 
-PRON- deplore the fact that -PRON- cousin career have be such as to appeal to -PRON- roam nature and lead to emu lation and -PRON- offer a dire prophecy of priva tion and bad should i fail to heed -PRON- final word 
uncle rufu be in poor health and do not believe that -PRON- be long for this world 
-PRON- brother jeremiah have be kill in the boxer uprising in china and while the missionary have be a martyr to the christian faith and uncle rufu glory in -PRON- yet the blow have be a hard shall i admit -PRON- 
there be tear in -PRON- eye as i put aside the good man letter 
i have lay a course directly contrary to -PRON- ad vice and i be risk every dollar i have in the a a ter to world on a single throw 
more than that -PRON- cousin arthur be at the root of the venture 
that be an unpleasant night i pass but i arise with determination unshaken 
-PRON- first move be to acquaint -PRON- companion with the fact that -PRON- venture be ready for launch 
then i hurry to find captain golden and for two day -PRON- be more than busy 
store be purchase and hustle off to the lady may by the drayload 
the crew be get aboard and the blood sing in -PRON- vein as i watch sailor and stevedore trample the schooner white deck and stow -PRON- cargo 
on the second day after that draft have work -PRON- magic mrs brackett and miss anstruther come aboard with -PRON- luggage vandeleur follow later 
the tide turn at eight in the evening and -PRON- be to go out with -PRON- 
a little after six oclock logy bill hove alongside and beckon -PRON- to the pier 
ready for the start be ye -PRON- ask lead e -PRON- a little apart and drop -PRON- voice 
all ready i answer complacently 
what dye think of golden 
a arter to four -PRON- look to -PRON- like a man i can depend on 
-PRON- look that way to -PRON- lorry or never have send -PRON- to ye 
reckon -PRON- know that dude who s takin the trip with ye 
why say with a start and a quick look at -PRON- companion golden hasnot say anything about -PRON- and neither have vandeleur 
well i just get -PRON- pretty straight that -PRON- two have be thick as sardine in a box for the past couple o day 
-PRON- know -PRON- own busi ness lorry and if what i tell ye be any news -PRON- can turn -PRON- over in -PRON- block 
as i say at the startoff any skipper who d deal with -PRON- would have a yaller streak in -PRON- somer 
-PRON- donot know anything to dis credit 
not a thing and not a thing to -PRON- credit either if -PRON- come to that 
but the mate a whole sailor and a man 
stubb -PRON- name be and -PRON- can count on -PRON- to do what s white in all weather 
just remember that 
captain golden be lean over the rail star e at -PRON- 
william see -PRON- mention the cir cumstance sotto voce wring -PRON- hand wish -PRON- luck and go away 
a a to four later when the wharfhouse begin to fade in the dusk and the city light twinkle out on the hill i lean over the afterrail while the tug race -PRON- down the harbor 
there be with -PRON- all wrap up in a risky venture with two woman under convoy with un know business and an unknown port ahead with one know enemy in -PRON- party and with a final doubt inspire as to the schooner captain 
when be i to see san francisco again 
and be i to return victor or vanquish 
the mate be bawl order within a few yard of -PRON- and the hand be scramble about alow and aloft sweat out the canvas 
i give no attention to the orderly disorder of sea manship but continue to lean over the rail and watch the passing light 
a hand touch -PRON- arm 
mr lorry murmur a voice 
miss anstruther 
i exclaim 
-PRON- lean on the rail beside -PRON- 
of what be -PRON- think -PRON- ask softly 
i be silent 
perhaps i know -PRON- go on -PRON- voice aquiver with feeling 
-PRON- be think of -PRON- a a to four responsibility wonder whether -PRON- be do e right in take mrs brackett and -PRON- away -PRON- know not where and expose -PRON- to unforeseen danger 
-PRON- have risk a good deal of money too andpardon -PRON- for say do not think -PRON- be money -PRON- could afford to lose 
as for mrs brackett and -PRON- mr lorry -PRON- accompany -PRON- of -PRON- own free will 
-PRON- have nothing but gratitude for -PRON- generosity and kindness 
more than that -PRON- will not find that -PRON- be a drag upon -PRON- 
-PRON- be prepared to face bravely whatever come 
as for -PRON- may i ask -PRON- to be entirely frank with -PRON- con cerne -PRON- difficulty 
will -PRON- let -PRON- share the anxiety that be bind to come 
oh i know what -PRON- think 
-PRON- think i be a woman and ought to be spare the mental wor rie and the hardship but mr lorry i be capable of bear -PRON- full part and i insist that -PRON- let -PRON- do -PRON- 
will -PRON- 
while i doubt the policy of the step -PRON- sug geste yet there be no gainsaying -PRON- 
after -PRON- have be three day at sea miss anstruther say and the business of -PRON- ex a a to -PRON- pedition unfold -PRON- more tangibly i shall be happy to take -PRON- into -PRON- full confidence and to look to -PRON- for advice 
two head be wise than one -PRON- know i smile and really -PRON- be the only one of -PRON- party with whom i should care to counsel 
if -PRON- feel surprise because -PRON- word give vandeleur the cold shoulder -PRON- give no evi dence of -PRON- 
-PRON- small hand flutter whitely toward -PRON- in the dusk as i gently clasp -PRON- in -PRON- big palm -PRON- say softly thank -PRON- thank -PRON- ever so much 
now please do not worry about mrs brackett and -PRON- 
i have pass several sleepless night because -PRON- be -PRON- money that finance this queer under taking and because i fear -PRON- may lose -PRON- but i be quite easy in -PRON- mind now mr lorry 
somehow the conviction have creep over -PRON- that -PRON- expedition be to prove a grand success and that -PRON- have merely cast -PRON- bread upon the water 
-PRON- hand linger in mine until -PRON- have fin ishe speak then -PRON- withdraw -PRON- bade -PRON- a hasty good night and flutter like a wraith down the aftercompanion 
a protest voice 
midnight see -PRON- well up on the farallone the lady may dancing prettily through the open sea 
not until then do i go below and turn in 
vandeleur and i have one of the stateroom 
-PRON- have appropriate the low berth and be snore loudly 
although the quarter be cramp and the staggering of the ship throw -PRON- around some what while i be disrobe yet i manage to get into -PRON- blanket without wake -PRON- room mate 
the three envelope i take to bed with -PRON- merely to be on the safe side 
that first night must have be one of horror for mrs brackett 
the poor old lady have never be on a boat before and -PRON- discomfort be gan early be all right when -PRON- get use to -PRON- mum grinned captain golden addressing miss anstruther and refer to mrs brackett who be not able to leave -PRON- stateroom 
a a to four -PRON- be at breakfast in the cabin the four of anstruther vandeleur the skipper and -PRON- 
vandeleur sit at right and i at -PRON- left miss anstruther be at side of the board and the vacant chair beside -PRON- be reserve for mrs brackett 
opposite the captain end of the table be the mate place 
stubb would eat by -PRON- when the rest of -PRON- have finish 
by jove miss anstruther observe vande leur with an admiring sidewise glance -PRON- seem to be quite a sailor have cross the ocean twice return miss anstruther with a glance at -PRON- and -PRON- be a rough passage both time but i be not a bit uncomfortable 
the lady may ainot a liner by no mean pursue the skipper but -PRON- s as stanch as one even if -PRON- do tumble about more do mum as the man say bank on -PRON- even when -PRON- run into a gale an begin turn hand spring 
-PRON- seem to be perfectly at home on a boat mr lorry say miss anstruther 
ever since -PRON- have take -PRON- chair -PRON- have a a to four be try to draw -PRON- into the conversation but i prefer to keep silence and watch van deleur and the skipper for some sign of an under standing between -PRON- 
like -PRON- miss anstruther i laugh have be to sea before have about make up -PRON- mind mr lorry cut in the skipper that -PRON- could tell a top lift from a reefpoint 
about day after tomor row i suppose well know where be go hope so captain 
the crew of course be a bit curious the trouble on vyage like this when -PRON- donot know where -PRON- be go when -PRON- start out nor what -PRON- be go to do when -PRON- get there 
the fairly bil with wrong idee an all the hand be upsot an onsettle 
but curry -PRON- down as the man say if the need come 
as soon as the man find out what port be bind for i return probably become easy in -PRON- mind 
the port be bind for ainot the whole of -PRON- mr lorry 
golden drop -PRON- hand on the tableedge and fix the blue eye on -PRON-

i remain in the cabin long enough to pass the time of day with -PRON- and to take -PRON- sizing then climb to the poop 
-PRON- be good to sniff salt air again to watch the belly canvas to hear the wind sing in the rig ge the wave splash alongside the mellow note of the ship bell and to feel the heave of the deck underfoot 
difficulty loom vaguely ahead but i face -PRON- complacently 
as a passenger i be privileged to go and come as i see fit and take advantage of this to mingle somewhat with the man 
look in at the focsle spend an hour with the watch below a a to four and later i spend another hour with all hand during the first dogwatch

the swede be sturdy taci turn good seaman and thriftyand thrift of course be an evidence of character 
for three day -PRON- have shift wind and clear sky and make a fair westing 
on the morning of the third day mrs brackett look a bit pale and distressed join -PRON- at table for the morning meal 
up to the time mrs brackett present -PRON- a a to four i have catch only fleeting glimpse of miss an struther 
nearly the whole of that third day however both lady be on deck and appear to enjoy the experience 
at eight bell of the second dogwatch cap tain golden come to -PRON- where i stand lean against the cabin near the break of the poop and touch -PRON- arm the time for -PRON- to open -PRON- seal order mr lorry say the skipper

but i want to know where be go when -PRON- be do with -PRON- chinning that s all 
i turn away and descend the companion stair close the door after -PRON- 
vandeleur sit under a ship lamp in the cabin read a book and smoke a cigarette 
-PRON- make as though -PRON- would leave when i come down 
wait mr vandeleur say -PRON- be three day out and -PRON- be time to hold -PRON- conference and open the envelope 
a a ter to -PRON- be nervous and ill at ease 
-PRON- have -PRON- envelope and -PRON- isnot necessary for -PRON- to remain -PRON- observe shiftily 
i understand very well what ail -PRON- 
-PRON- do not care to be present when i open that dummy envelope which -PRON- have give -PRON- 
-PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to remain i answer sternly 
sit down 
-PRON- show of authority dismay -PRON- and send -PRON- back into -PRON- chair 
-PRON- watch apprehen sively while i knock at the stateroom door to summon mrs brackett and miss anstruther 
the lady appear immediately miss an struther support mrs brackett and help -PRON- across the rock floor to a chair 
deary -PRON- sigh mrs brackett wasnot never mean to be a sailor i guess 
what be -PRON- mr lorry 
-PRON- be go to open the envelope mrs brackett say oh 
there be a flutter of excitement on the part of both lady 
take one of the pivotal chair i swing to the table and lay three envelope in front of -PRON- thank -PRON- for -PRON- envelope mr vande a arter to four leur say i sharply give the young man a steady glance 
what do -PRON- mean -PRON- demand weakly 
just what i say 
i want -PRON- envelope 
look here lorry -PRON- cry pull -PRON- together be this a joke 
not so far as i be concern 
why i give -PRON- -PRON- envelope before -PRON- leave san francisco 
that be where the joke come in vandeleur 
the envelope -PRON- give -PRON- contain nothing but a piece of blank paper 
then the joke be on all of -PRON- vandeleur remark with a feeble attempt at levity 
more than likely all the envelope contain piece of blank paper 
mrs brackett wring -PRON- hand and miss an struther look startled 
what i want from -PRON- vandeleur i go on be the envelope mr price give younot the one -PRON- hand -PRON- in san francisco 
-PRON- fall back in -PRON- chair make a pitiable attempt to dissemble 
by jove -PRON- stutter do -PRON- mean to in sinuate tha py a a to four come i cut in briskly keep -PRON- wait e 
vandeleur recover -PRON- a little get out of -PRON- chair and swagger toward -PRON- bind to force -PRON- hand be -PRON- -PRON- cry come to a halt brace -PRON- and glower at -PRON- with -PRON- buttermilk eye be i return calmly just that 
please mr vandeleur plead miss an struther in an agitated voice 
-PRON- must all work together -PRON- know or -PRON- can not hope for success be troublesome admonished mrs brackett in a tone of paternal tolerance now of all time 
vandeleur turn and bow to miss an struther 
-PRON- action miss anstruther go on van deleur melodramatically spring from a due re gard for -PRON- interest and mine 
-PRON- lady donot know anything about this fellow lorry but i have be at some pain to look -PRON- up 
from what i have learn about -PRON- i assure -PRON- that -PRON- be not a man to be trust 
-PRON- draw up to a arter to four -PRON- full height 
personally -PRON- finish with a flourish decline to trust -PRON- 
mrs brackett and miss anstruther stare first at vandeleur and then at -PRON- 
another man than vandeleur make such a speech would have hear from -PRON- promptly but there be a ludicrous side to this affair and -PRON- completely dwarf the youth insolence 
perhaps i speak up dryly -PRON- have better tell the lady what -PRON- know know -PRON- cry turn fiercely and level e at -PRON- a finger yellow with cigarette that -PRON- be an adventurer and that -PRON- will stoop to anything to feather -PRON- own nest 
be that all vandeleur enough i think 
i lift -PRON- clench right hand and bring -PRON- down in the open palm of -PRON- demand that -PRON- turn those three envelope over to -PRON- and make -PRON- the leader of this expedition 
silence follow silence break only by the slap of wave alongside the straining of timber a tramp of foot overhead shall be glad say i finally to yield to the a arter will of the majority 
if the lady want -PRON- for a leader vandeleur let -PRON- say so 
good gracious exclaimed mrs brackett with a long breath 
whoever hear of such a thing 
here mr lorry furnish the money to take -PRON- goodness know where and make -PRON- pos sible for -PRON- to find out whether there s anything or nothing back of this trip and mr vandeleur thank -PRON- by go into a tantrum like that 
young man -PRON- add severely give van deleur a withering look wouldnot have stir a step if -PRON- hadnot be for mr lorry and i wonot go a mile farther into this big ocean unless -PRON- have entire charge of the party feel the same way mr vandeleur say miss anstruther 
do be reasonable 
for an instant the wind seem take out of sail 
then -PRON- get -PRON- in hand again be go to look after -PRON- interest in spite of -PRON- say -PRON- puff out -PRON- chest like an angry robin 
before long both of -PRON- lady will thank -PRON- for -PRON- 
-PRON- start for the companion stair 
before -PRON- have take three step i have -PRON- by the collar a a to four and have lay -PRON- squirm back down on the table 
-PRON- claw kick shout threat and bawl for help 
in spite of -PRON- puny struggle i push a hand into the breast of -PRON- coat and draw out the envelope which i know to be there 
then i fling -PRON- aside 
-PRON- topple to the floor but spring up fume and rush for the deck be sorry lady i remark that i find -PRON- necessary to use force 
vandeleur however have queer idea and -PRON- can not allow -PRON- to man ace the success of -PRON- enterprise 
-PRON- do exactly right mr lorry approve miss anstruther 
now let -PRON- open the en velope before there be any more interference 
why who else be there to interfere flutter mrs bracktt 
no one i hope answer miss anstruther but mr vandeleur will appeal to captain gold en andand i must confess that i do not like captain look 
i be tear open the envelope while miss anstruther be speak 
a dissect clue 
the problem of the four envelope have so com pletely win -PRON- that i give little attention to the clash with vandeleur 
at least one of the veil that shroud -PRON- mission be about to lift 
a few moment after vandeleur have leave the lady forget -PRON- as utterly as i have do 
lean e forward over the table -PRON- watch breath lessly the swinging lamp overhead throw -PRON- shadow weirdly across the tabletop 
each envelope contain a piece of cardboard some three inch square 
on the back of each piece be the name of the person who have re ceive -PRON- with the word in parenthesis -PRON- be carefully 
on the reverse side of -PRON- piece and vande leur be figure with degree minute and sec ondmark and the letter and on the reverse side of mrs and miss an struther piece be word painstakingly print in a bold hand 
a a to four -PRON- look like a dissected puzzle say miss anstruther 
hardly a puzzle say for the piece go together without difficulty 
-PRON- be -PRON- instruc tion miss anstruther cut into quarter and each piece send to one of the four who be en title to a knowledge of the whole 
i juggle the piece about until -PRON- lie as fol low fortunel island 14940io io1230 mouth of sea calve on east side ten teakwlood case there -PRON- be 
i exclaim exultantly 
mrs brackett tremblingly adjust a pair of spectacle and bow -PRON- head close to the four rejoin quarter canot make out one thing -PRON- murmur 
what do -PRON- all mean anyway 
why mrs brackett return miss an struther with repress excitement -PRON- a a ter to four see that by fit those card together in that way -PRON- find out where -PRON- be to go donot suppose very bright zelda say mrs brackett shake -PRON- head helplessly but then i ainot so young as i use to be and there be a lot of thing past -PRON- understanding 
what be those figure with the funny mark after -PRON- 
those figure give -PRON- the latitude and longi tude of fortune island explain the girl pa tiently 
with those figure to guide -PRON- cap tain golden can lay -PRON- course for the island 
so -PRON- an island be go to 
yes 
not one of these cannibal island query mrs brackett in sudden alarm 
there be no cannibal island in this day and age of the world mrs brackett i hasten to reassure -PRON- 
thank goodness for that brackett 
when i be a girl i about godless people that eat one hate to land on an island where sighed mrs use to read another and -PRON- do such thing 
but if -PRON- boy tom be on that island and here -PRON- face harden resolutely find a a to ur -PRON- if the place be crowd with cannibal 
but what do the rest of that printing mean 
that i explain be something for -PRON- to investigate when -PRON- get there 
some one i go on donot know who have take a great deal of pain to set -PRON- on the right track 
all this -PRON- see be print on a large card the card be then cut into four piece and a quarter send to each of -PRON- 
that be where the quarter to four come in i suppose 
so cleverly be the instruction print on the large card that when quarter all four piece be necessary before the instruction could be read 
this of course be to keep any one of -PRON- from obtain an advantage over the other 
to learn this clue to -PRON- destination -PRON- be all oblige to bring -PRON- quarter and lie -PRON- together 
a very simple plan but entirely effect -PRON- have 
take -PRON- notebook from -PRON- pocket i write out the name of the island and the latitude and longitude twice each description on a separate leaf 
one of the leave i tear out to give to captain golden 
a a ter to -PRON- lady understand i think i proceed lay the detached leaf on the table and return e the notebook to -PRON- pocket that mr van deleur be not to be trust 
-PRON- be entitle to a quarterly share in -PRON- enterprise and -PRON- will deal with -PRON- justly no matter how -PRON- elect to deal with -PRON- but i think the information -PRON- have just develop should be keep from -PRON- 
vandeleur have mistake idea 
-PRON- must not for get that -PRON- know little of captain golden and even less of -PRON- crew 
if -PRON- tell vandeleur everything and -PRON- make a confidant of captain golden -PRON- donot say that -PRON- would but that -PRON- mightmake trouble for -PRON- 
-PRON- be well to be on the safe side 
dear dear falter mrs brackett becom e nervous do hope -PRON- wonot have any trouble with anybody 
mr vandeleur know enough already to whet captain curiosity put in miss an struther 
if the captain cupidity be arouse and as i say before i donot like the man lookswe may find the whole ship against -PRON- 
-PRON- couldnot be so bad as that miss anstruther i be sure say i hastily for certainly there be a a ter to four some honest hand aboard the schooner 
please donot be alarm by what i say 
i speak as i do merely to emphasize the need of caution with regard to vandeleur 
have -PRON- fix in -PRON- mind the print word on -PRON- card and mrs 
the girl lean over the card for a moment then look up with a nod 
take a match from -PRON- pocket i burn the card one by one pow dere the little heap of black ashe and drop -PRON- on the floor 
let -PRON- warn both of -PRON- say to say nothing not a word 
i will give that leaf on the table to captain golden and -PRON- will tell -PRON- all that -PRON- need to know 
if vandeleur try to talk with either of -PRON- please refer -PRON- to -PRON- afraid mourn mrs brackett that this work of our wonot be clear sailing after all a pretty old woman to be mix up in any trouble mr lorry 
-PRON- be only the thought of find -PRON- boy that bring -PRON- into this and while -PRON- mighty fine to think of secure a for tune toofor goodness know poverty poor at this very minutestill a woman of -PRON- year hasnot any business philanderin around the ocean a a ter to four look for a pot o gold hunting for tom that s all and now that -PRON- have make a good start -PRON- can count on -PRON- to keep -PRON- good foot for ward shall do all i can to avoid trouble mrs brackett say i earnestly both on -PRON- ac count and on miss i may add on -PRON- own as well 
if trouble come -PRON- will not be of -PRON- seek -PRON- may be sure nor because i do not do everything possible to keep away from -PRON- 
why do mr vandeleur deceive -PRON- in san francisco by give -PRON- an envelope contain e a piece of blank paper mr lorry query miss anstruther 
-PRON- do not tell -PRON- about that -PRON- add reproachfully do not want to bother -PRON- i return when -PRON- have so many other thing to think about 
i feel sure that vandeleur be try to trick -PRON- and -PRON- be not an hour after -PRON- give -PRON- the envelope before i investigate and discover that -PRON- contain nothing 
why do -PRON- want to trick -PRON- persist the girl 
-PRON- must have know that -PRON- would find -PRON- out sooner or later 
io9 a a to four i hesitate about tell of the night attack on -PRON- on the waterfront 
there be no way to avoid -PRON- however so i give -PRON- the story briefly 
mrs brackett be horrified and miss an struther eye flash 
only vandeleur could have inspire that at tack i go on imagine therefore that -PRON- give -PRON- the envelope to quiet any suspicion of -PRON- that i may have form 
-PRON- be treacherous breathe miss anstruther indignantly 
-PRON- be perfectly right not to trust -PRON- with any information 
of course -PRON- shall have -PRON- share of whatever -PRON- find but -PRON- be plain that -PRON- must do all the work -PRON- and perhaps -PRON- shall have to do -PRON- in the face of -PRON- open hostility 
-PRON- conference have proceed thus far when -PRON- be interrupt by the opening of the compan ion door 
captain golden and vandeleur come down the stair 
vandeleur be fume 
the skipper single eye hold a baleful gleam and i see that -PRON- car rie a revolver in -PRON- hand 
miss anstruther i request in a low tone i a a to will -PRON- and mrs brackett please retire to -PRON- stateroom will take mrs brackett to the stateroom the girl whisper rise from -PRON- chair pale but resolute and then i shall return and take -PRON- place at -PRON- side beg of -PRON- -PRON- mind be make up mr lorry -PRON- break in decisively 
while -PRON- support mrs brackett across the rock floor i get up brace -PRON- against the chairback and face the skipper and vandeleur 
who the trouble here demand captain golden planting -PRON- in front of -PRON- leg wide apart -PRON- ominous eye rake -PRON- up and down 
no trouble captain i answer easily 
mr vandeleur here say there be 
by jove stutter vandeleur the scoun drel lay hand on -PRON- throw -PRON- down on that table and take a document out of -PRON- pocket 
-PRON- use violence captain golden that s what -PRON- do get that document yet and i demand -PRON- back -PRON- indictment mr lorry as the man say come sternly from the skipper the only man that have a right to use violence on this foreanafter an i wonot have -PRON- passen ger robbin an sluggin each other 
do -PRON- rise to that 
i nod 
miss anstruther at that moment glide forward and take -PRON- station at -PRON- side 
i a a to four a lady present captain golden say and -PRON- revolver be out of place 
before i put up this gun go on the skip per doggedly want to know whether or not -PRON- be go to give dockyment back to -PRON- be not 
that document and three other have be destroy 
destroy cry vandeleur in a voice that throb and choke with wrath 
if -PRON- s de troye those paper captain golden then by gad 
i call on -PRON- to put -PRON- in iron 
i have as much right to those paper as any one and if -PRON- destroy -PRON- -PRON- do -PRON- because -PRON- want to rob -PRON- that will do vandeleur say i sharply step pe toward -PRON- 
-PRON- jump back and behind golden as though fear i be about to lay hand on -PRON- again 
avast there warn the skipper put out -PRON- arm 
what business -PRON- get destroyin property belong to vandeleur 
whatever business -PRON- be captain golden at least -PRON- be no business of yours 
-PRON- gorge be rise 
something touch -PRON- a a to sleeve as though to arouse in -PRON- a realize sense of what i be do 
i drop -PRON- eye and see miss small white hand 
i give -PRON- a reassuring glance out of the clew of -PRON- eye then pick from the table the leaf with the longitude and latitude of -PRON- destina tion 
this be a fitting time for -PRON- to come to an understanding captain i announce 
-PRON- duck -PRON- head fix -PRON- to say something ironical but i cut in ahead hold here a slip of paper give the bearing of -PRON- destination but before i turn -PRON- over to -PRON- i must know whether -PRON- intend to live up to -PRON- contract swith -PRON- 
-PRON- vouchsafe no response 
who own the lady may i pursue 
-PRON- know as well as i do -PRON- snarl 
and who s -PRON- skipper 
what sort of a fool question be that 
who charter the schoon 
-PRON- do 
who sign the contract and put up the ad vancemoney 
yoti do 
i a a ter to so -PRON- follow that the lady may -PRON- skipper and crew be under -PRON- order for a period not exceed six month 
providin -PRON- business be honest -PRON- quali fie insinuatingly not so bloomin sure of that yet 
-PRON- be honest and i own -PRON- and -PRON- boat for the period of -PRON- contract 
there be three per son aboard who be -PRON- brackett miss anstruther and a vandeleur 
if i choose to have -PRON- put in at honolulu and leave vandeleur -PRON- will do -PRON- 
that catch the skipper 
-PRON- also make a salu tary impression upon vandeleur change quick glance 
-PRON- ainot treatin the two ex vandeleur much like a guest mumble captain golden ease off a bit on -PRON- temper 
that be an affair between vandeleur and -PRON- 
-PRON- have nothing whatever to do with -PRON- 
now then once for all be -PRON- go to continue this voyage or be -PRON- go to put back to san francisco 
if -PRON- will tell -PRON- where be go -PRON- an swered sulkily continue the voyage 
a a ter to very good say hand -PRON- the paper the latitude and longitude of -PRON- first landfall here i turn grimly on young man doesnot make -PRON- necessary for -PRON- to put -PRON- ashore at honolulu 
-PRON- havenot any right to go through with this business without -PRON- babble vandeleur -PRON- face turn a sickly gray 
-PRON- be thoroughly cow and not a little frightened have a moral right to do anything i see fit that will make for the good of this expedition i declare 
if -PRON- be foolish enough to try to meddle with -PRON- and so increase -PRON- difficulty -PRON- shall certainly drop -PRON- off somewhere until the work be do 
i have a share -PRON- ask -PRON- appeal e gaze travel from -PRON- to miss anstruther 
certainly mr vandeleur speak up miss an struther 
mr lorry intend to protect -PRON- in terest 
if -PRON- will be advise by -PRON- -PRON- will do exactly as -PRON- say get -PRON- in a corner be sullen response so i suppose have to jump whenever -PRON- crack the whip 
what do -PRON- a a to -PRON- want -PRON- to do -PRON- jerk out turn in -PRON- di rection 
sheer away and keep to -PRON- until this boat put into san francisco again say i promptly 
and keep a still tongue in -PRON- head i add with a significant glance at the skipper who have -PRON- back to -PRON- overhaul some chart do that by jove growl vandeleur with a black look 
and if -PRON- play -PRON- false lorry donot forget that have an accounting 
if i find i continue ignore -PRON- last re mark that -PRON- be not act strictly in accord ance with -PRON- instruction after -PRON- lay -PRON- south erly course i shall have -PRON- transfer to the first ship -PRON- fall in with 
-PRON- bend -PRON- brow at -PRON- but make no answer 
captain golden -PRON- call 
well interrogate the skipper look up from a chart which -PRON- have lay over the table decline to occupy the same stateroom with this man any longer 
have i -PRON- permission to bunk in the focsle 
-PRON- can bunk in the crosstree for all -PRON- snap the skipper but -PRON- better ask mr 
a a to four lorry 
-PRON- seem to be cock o the walk on this hooker at the present speakin 
bunk wherever -PRON- please say vandeleur carry a deeply injure air across the cabin and into -PRON- stateroom and -PRON- carry -PRON- out again together with a couple of suitcase and a hatbox 
-PRON- never deign a look in miss direction or mine until -PRON- reach the foot of the companion stair 
then -PRON- whirl about match -PRON- wit against -PRON- any day lorry -PRON- scowl 
as for miss anstruther and mrs brackett just let -PRON- remember that a man who will steal for -PRON- will steal from -PRON- 
with that vandeleur lurch up the stair and out onto the deck 
miss anstruther give -PRON- a faint smile 
evidently -PRON- appreciation of van deleur performance be equal to -PRON- own 
no such place call captain golden a fin ger of -PRON- mutilated hand rest on the chart before -PRON- off sounding with this lati tude an longitude o yours mr lorry 
what do -PRON- mean 
i query step to -PRON- side no such island down on the chart 
i if a a to four -PRON- the fortune island -PRON- be after -PRON- be way off not after the fortune island 
that other fortune island ainot chart 
a glance at the chart show -PRON- that -PRON- be right 
-PRON- be an admiralty chart and a good cine 
the island be there all right say i confi dently even if -PRON- isnot down on the chart 
golden shake -PRON- head 
some one hand -PRON- a gold brick -PRON- aver 
-PRON- four en velope where do -PRON- hear anything about four en velope 
i interrupt sharply 
the skipper look blank for an instant 
why say -PRON- get the whiphand of -PRON- self -PRON- talk about -PRON- envelope when vandeleur an i come down 
not that i know of i return shortly 
then vandeleur tell -PRON- afore -PRON- come down 
anyhow -PRON- an -PRON- friend have be gold bricke as i say not -PRON- affair captain golden i observe deliberately 
take -PRON- to the spot in dicate 
if -PRON- find open water then well bout a a ter to ship and return to san francisco in sure against loss no matter what happen say -PRON- then put away the chart and go on deck to give the man at the wheel oll1 se 
-PRON- do very well indeed mr lorry say miss anstruther can not begin to tell -PRON- how glad i be that -PRON- do not come to any vio lence with captain golden 
that lesson in who s who be come to the captain i answer profit by -PRON- i think 
still -PRON- murmur do not trust -PRON- 
-PRON- almost seem as though there be some understand e between the captain and mr vandeleur 
certainly mr vandeleur have tell captain golden more than be necessary 
no doubt and when vandeleur get into the focsle -PRON- may proceed to enlighten the crew 
but i donot see how -PRON- can help that too bad commiserated miss anstruther that -PRON- should have such a contraryminde per son in -PRON- party 
however as -PRON- say -PRON- can not be help so -PRON- must make the good of -PRON- 
-PRON- be a good stroke to burn the four card and a a to four not trust mr vandeleur with the rest of the in formation 
-PRON- wonot be long i suppose until every one on the ship know that -PRON- be make for an uncharted island 
that will be common gossip before many day 
what will the crew think of -PRON- and -PRON- mis sion 
the first thing a sailor always think of on a voyage like -PRON- be treasure 
-PRON- will -PRON- be agine probably that be go after pearl 
a mysterious voyage be quite apt to whet a mari ner curiosity 
and the idea of pearl be quite apt to whet -PRON- greed be -PRON- not 
in that miss anstruther have strike the key note 
i marvel at -PRON- foresight 
be -PRON- an optimist miss anstruther 
i smile try to be -PRON- answer catch -PRON- spirit and also smile 
then as optimist -PRON- will not cross any bridge until -PRON- come to -PRON- 
yet -PRON- be well donot -PRON- think to imagine i a a ter to what lie before -PRON- and try to be prepare for whatever may happen 
exactly so i agree -PRON- eye wander to the rack that hold the rifle 
-PRON- notice -PRON- glance at the firearm and drop -PRON- head with a little shiver 
-PRON- will not forget what -PRON- promise -PRON- while -PRON- be be tow down the bay -PRON- ask will not forget 
-PRON- will find miss an struther that i shall rely upon -PRON- judgment a great deal 
-PRON- may rely upon -PRON- in other way too 
perhaps mr lorry and -PRON- eye dance as -PRON- rise to -PRON- have more courage than -PRON- be pleased to credit -PRON- with 
at any rate i shall stand at -PRON- side no matter what come 
good night 
good night say and -PRON- separate to go to -PRON- a bonny girl truly run the current of -PRON- thought a girl to fight with and a girl to fight for 
who could not succeed in any undertaking with zelda anstruther at -PRON- side 
the i have always plenty of food for thoughtthe obscure detail of -PRON- enterprise offer -PRON- that and the progress of event be continually warp -PRON- mental process to a different angle 
for instance -PRON- speculation deal often with the mysterious unknown who have write out -PRON- direction quarter -PRON- and distribute -PRON- so oddly 
who be this person 
and why be -PRON- hide -PRON- hand and forego a part in the expedition 
nay more if there be a fortune to be have why do -PRON- not go after -PRON- -PRON- in stead of turn -PRON- over to other 
then too what sort of a fortune be -PRON- 
of what do -PRON- consist 
inasmuch as i have stake -PRON- all on the ven ture -PRON- may be that i give the outcome more thought than do any of the other 
-PRON- be deeply interested of course but hardly to the ex tent that i be 
a fresh viewpoint be mine when i learn a arter to four that the ostensible fortune lie somewhere over sea 
the angle change with the treacherous maneuver of vandeleur with the information that -PRON- landfall lie well down in the tropic that -PRON- be not chart and consequently shroud in doubt 
all these and many other develop ment keep the vague perspective constantly shift 
-PRON- one firm support be miss anstruther 
come fair weather or foul success or failure i feel that -PRON- would not fail -PRON- 
mrs brackett also in -PRON- way be thoroughly dependable 
circumstance narrow -PRON- life to the little world of emmetsburg have not give -PRON- the broad outlook most available for -PRON- pre ent need 
of the experience that count in the large affair of existence miss anstruther have acquire infinitely more in less than half mrs year 
-PRON- seem almost a sacrilege to do or say any thing that would disturb mrs serenity or hopefulness 
-PRON- artlessness and simplicity no less than -PRON- advanced year counsel -PRON- to smooth the path before -PRON- 
miss anstruther on the other hand would not a a to four have content -PRON- one moment unless -PRON- know -PRON- to be in touch with every detail of -PRON- enterprise 
during that first night of -PRON- lone occupancy of the stateroom -PRON- run into some heavy weather 
the lady may wrestle and tumble with the long pacific swell and i hear much tramp about on the deck and much shouting of order 
mrs brackett be again indispose and do not join -PRON- at breakfast 
neither do vandeleur but from indisposition of another sort 
-PRON- be sulky and the skipper tell miss anstruther and -PRON- that -PRON- choose to eat at the second table with mr stubb 
follow breakfast i take a turn on deck 
the sun have appear for only a brief space and then have withdraw behind ominouslooke cloud 
the sea be a dull leaden gray and whitecaps rear above the schooner rail and now and then tumble aboard 
a peep into the binnacle show -PRON- the compasscard bear southwest 
the glass be down sir and be in for a sou easter say the man at the wheel 
this man be one of the swede anderson by a a to name 
-PRON- easy command of english surprised i should have like to talk with -PRON- but the skipper be pace the lee alley and may have resent a conversation with the helmsman 
with a nod to anderson i go over and sit down on the cabin 
the wind be steadily increase 
captain golden tramp up and down and sidestep with the roll of the ship appear to be com mune with -PRON- 
all -PRON- canvas be set and draw 
every once in a while -PRON- lee rail go under and a wave sweep -PRON- amidship with the windward roll and run hiss through the scupper 
-PRON- be high time i think that the skipper begin take in sail 
however if -PRON- be bad form to talk with the man at the wheel -PRON- be even bad form to advise a skipper what to do in handle -PRON- ship 
all hand have be turn out 
i presume stubb have do that before -PRON- go below 
hud dle forward i could see the man alternately stare to windward and up at the poop where a a ter to four the preoccupied skipper be mechanically pace -PRON- round 
be -PRON- anything of a seaman mr lorry shout captain golden bracing -PRON- near i donot know whatever put the question into -PRON- head nor what possible bear -PRON- could have on -PRON- thought 
-PRON- be certainly odd that -PRON- should address -PRON- in such a way at such a time enough of a seaman to know that -PRON- will have -PRON- on -PRON- beamend if -PRON- donot begin to snug down i call back to -PRON- sharply 
-PRON- blue eye glint 
what reply be on -PRON- lip i never know for at that moment a fierce gust hit -PRON- and over -PRON- go with -PRON- lee rail under 
a look forward show -PRON- vandeleur hang e for life to a pinrail and with -PRON- heel buoy up in the deluge that sweep -PRON- 
the pull on -PRON- arm be too much for -PRON- 
hurl from -PRON- support -PRON- be slam against the weather bulwark and a moment later haul out of the scupper by the mexican 
then personally con ducte to the hatch -PRON- be drop be low 
a a to four a scud of rain drive down on -PRON- and as i start for the companionway stubb bound out of -PRON- to the deck 
captain golden be arouse at last and as i go below i hear -PRON- bawl to jibs 
i would know what -PRON- come up the hand to get in the topsail and have give something handsome to the skipper have have in -PRON- mind when to -PRON- and ask if i be anything of a seaman 
miss anstruther be in the cabin when i get below 
this be -PRON- first storm isnot -PRON- mr lorry -PRON- ask bit of a blow miss anstruther i reply cheeringly help -PRON- on into the trade and the quicker -PRON- strike the trade the quicker -PRON- get to fortune island 
-PRON- refer to the tradewind 
yes 
the captain have put the ship on -PRON- new course 
-PRON- be now head southwest i assure -PRON- 
-PRON- didnot think -PRON- would refuse to take -PRON- to fortune island after -PRON- promise to -PRON- last evening do -PRON- 
a a ter to four hardly know what i think -PRON- answer musingly the more i see of captain golden the more -PRON- distrust of -PRON- increase shall watch -PRON- closely -PRON- may be sure of that say a wail come from the stateroom 
poor mrs brackett be almost worry out of -PRON- sense say miss anstruther start for the stateroom -PRON- think -PRON- may go to the bot tom any moment and insist that i should find -PRON- and ask if there be any danger 
tell -PRON- -PRON- may be a little uncomfortable for a while i smile but that -PRON- be perfectly safe 
-PRON- eat -PRON- dinner with the roughweather tray in place and i do not think miss an struther find -PRON- a very enjoyable meal 
-PRON- eat but little and soon leave the table with some bread and tea for mrs brackett 
during the brief period -PRON- sit with the skip per and -PRON- -PRON- grow dislike of captain gold en be plainly manifest 
-PRON- avoid -PRON- glance even when -PRON- ask -PRON- a question -PRON- keep -PRON- eye away from -PRON- when -PRON- answer 
a a to four that be the woman of -PRON- i suppose 
as i do not want the skipper to feel that -PRON- distrust -PRON- i resolve to speak to miss anstruther and give -PRON- a little good counsel at the first oppor tunity 
vandeleur do not come to the cabin for -PRON- dinner 
mr stubb tell -PRON- with a humorous grin that -PRON- hadnot the nerve to make the pas sage from the aft with the big sea run ning 
the rest of that day be dreary enough 
miss anstruth clung to -PRON- stateroom in constant attendance upon mrs brackett and i miss -PRON- sadly 
i have another brief glimpse of -PRON- at supper when -PRON- resume -PRON- same air of frigid reserve toward captain golden 
the skipper be not a dense man and i know that miss attitude do not escape -PRON- 
be -PRON- sufficiently dense to misconstrue -PRON- 
that be the point that bother -PRON- 
as i lie in -PRON- bunk that night with the lady may wallow and plunge toward the heart of the great pacific i fall back on the usual pas time of -PRON- solitary wake hour 
-PRON- mental carpentry have to do with dovetail together cer i a a to four tain speculation in such a way as to make a tangible fabric of three dimension 
of course i give -PRON- up 
the material with which i have to work be too vague for a lucid product 
some agility be necessary to keep -PRON- in -PRON- berth 
nevertheless i sleptby spell 
the groan timber the stamp of foot overhead the shriek of the wind and the splash of the rain and the wave all united in a lullaby 
several hour must have pass when a rough hand drum on -PRON- door 
i start up with a suddenness that bring -PRON- head in sharp con tact with the bottom of the upper berth 
flounder to the door i pull -PRON- open and find petie the cabinboy hang to a chair in the cabin 
what do -PRON- want 
i demand 
mr vandeleur send -PRON- sir answer petie 
-PRON- want to see -PRON- in the focsle 
if -PRON- want to see -PRON- i answer why doesnot -PRON- come here 
-PRON- ainot able sir 
-PRON- get stove in a little by a wave that board -PRON- this mornin 
what time be -PRON- petie 
a a to four four bell of the midwatch sir 
i have not hear that vandeleur have be hurt by -PRON- morning experience 
yet i give -PRON- the benefit of the doubt get into -PRON- clothe hur riedly take the skipper oilskin coat and sou wester from the cabin table where -PRON- have throw -PRON- and climb out into the howl gale 
the rain have abate somewhat but the fierce wind drive the schooner at a racehorse clip through the inky sea 
just from the light cabin as i be i could hardly see -PRON- hand before -PRON- face 
where ye go mr lorry call the mate from somewhere behind -PRON- 
vandeleur want to see -PRON- in the focsle 
purty time this to turn out a man 
mind yer eye as ye go forard sir a nasty sea run 
i lurch down the lee step from the poop sense the windward roll by the feel of the deck and hustle forward along the lee rail 
the roll from windward catch -PRON- close to the main rig ging 
by then i could see a little and i jump into the shroud just as a huge wave foam athwart i a a to ship with the slant of the deck 
watch -PRON- chance i drop to the dripping plank and start on again 
forward of the galley with the hatch but a few yard away a stunning blow catch -PRON- from behind 
i try to cry out but every muscle go lax under the impact of the heavy hand that -PRON- 
a sickening feeling of abject helplessness rush through every nerve 
for an instant the raging of wind and sea die away in blank si lence 
then with a desperate drag upon -PRON- re serve power i regain -PRON- sense and feel that i be be propel toward the side of the ship 
who -PRON- be that have lay hold of -PRON- i could not see but i realize that -PRON- life be at stake and that if i save -PRON- i must fight 
lift -PRON- voice in a wild yell i strike out furiously with -PRON- clenched fist grapple with -PRON- unknown antagonist and -PRON- go to the deck and roll over and over into the scupper 
there -PRON- head bring up with tremendous force against the bulwark and once more everything tangible slip from -PRON- 
i cool villainy 
when i regain -PRON- wit the mate have -PRON- up on the poop in the lee alley 
there be keen pain at the back of -PRON- head and in -PRON- ear a dull roaring not of the wind or the sea 
what do ye yell for mr lorry inquire stubb help -PRON- to -PRON- foot and support -PRON- as i lean against the cabin man donot usually yell like that when a bit of a comber come aboard and slam -PRON- head first into the bulwark should say not 
i agree -PRON- see any one else when -PRON- pick -PRON- up mr stubb 
only the watch 
i grapple with any one 
because of the dark i feel rather than see the mate amazement 
a moment more and -PRON- word leave no doubt of -PRON- 
now keelhaul -PRON- -PRON- exclaim think i a a to four ye be too much of a sailor to git knock off -PRON- pin 
be ye set on be and from behind just forward of the galley 
i leave -PRON- mark on the man who do -PRON- that swear to 
come forward with -PRON- mr stubb until i can have a look at the watch well crawl into -PRON- bunk for now mr lorry counsel the mate halfafter two in the mornin an -PRON- investigation can wait go to settle this now i declare want to have a look at vandeleur as well as at the watch 
-PRON- head in spite of -PRON- throbbing ache be as clear as a bell and i be as steady on -PRON- foot as ever 
-PRON- gain the hatch without much difficulty and i descend leave stubb to send the watch down a man at a time 
a chorus of snore reverberate in the focsle battle with the outer noise and with a thump of boot against the bulkhead as the vessel roll and the slap and swish of oilskin 
one of the swede be the first to come down 
-PRON- face bear no evidence of rough treatment 
-PRON- have hear -PRON- yell -PRON- state but -PRON- have see a a ter to four no one forward aside from -PRON- watchmate 
-PRON- have be doze on the deckhouse under the lee of one of the boat 
the mexican follow the swede tell a similar story and bear no mark of a struggle 
next come one of the american a lowbrowe bull necked ruffian who i be sure would be capable of anything in a pinch 
but -PRON- pass muster as easily as the other two 
so much for the watch 
take the sealamp from -PRON- swinging frame i go from bunk to bunk examine the face of the sleeper 
these offer no evidence whatever 
vandeleur be sleep apparently as soundly as the rest 
-PRON- do not seem in very bad case from -PRON- experi ence with the boarding wave 
with one hand i shake -PRON- into wakefulness 
well say i grimly as -PRON- lie stare up at -PRON- what do -PRON- want 
jove -PRON- stutter 
what be -PRON- do here 
what do -PRON- want 
-PRON- send for -PRON- -PRON- mumble and i see fear in -PRON- weak face 
a a ter to four well 
i say between -PRON- tooth lean down over -PRON- 
out with -PRON- 
mrs brackett have a bottle of arnica in -PRON- carpetbag with a futile readiness that bring a halfsmile to -PRON- lip and i want -PRON- to get -PRON- for -PRON- 
why didnot -PRON- tell petie that when -PRON- send -PRON- aft think i do but i be in a good deal of pain and may have neglect to do so arnica in the medicinech 
why didnot -PRON- have petie go to captain golden didnot think of that -PRON- gulp 
there be several thing vandeleur that -PRON- didnot think about something however that -PRON- have best keep in mind from this on hereafter i shall carry a loaded revolver and if any one try to slip -PRON- overboard there will be shoot 
look sharp -PRON- lad 
if -PRON- want to stay aboard the schooner -PRON- will have to do dif ferently 
then i put the lamp back in the bracket climb to the deck and go to the galley 
sli ding the door i step into the narrow room 
the cook sleep in a cubbyhole off -PRON- kitchen and a a ter to a scratch match give -PRON- a good view of -PRON- ebony face 
no -PRON- wasnot the cook 
when i regain the poop the mate inquire anxiously for the result of -PRON- investigation 
i tell -PRON- of -PRON- failure to find the man i be look e for 
-PRON- be strangely quiet for a minute -PRON- fin ger run up under -PRON- souwester and scra ping through -PRON- scant hair 
if i be -PRON- mr lorry -PRON- remark wouldnot give that vandeleur any more rope than necessary be stringin the crew with a lot o talk about treasure an the lord know what 
mebby -PRON- know how sailor be an meb by -PRON- donot but -PRON- ainot policy an be like to breed trouble betwixt -PRON- an the main mast -PRON- add hastily 
thank -PRON- mr stubb say i grimly 
from this on have two eye for vandeleur 
thereupon i lurch down the companionway and crawl back into bed 
by the follow morning the storm have blow -PRON- out the wind have die down to a skipper breeze and the heavy sea be slowly subside 
there be a lump at the back of -PRON- head and a a to four a bruise at the crown 
the skin have be fray from the knuckle of -PRON- right hand too and i be more certain than ever that i have leave some mark on the man who have attack -PRON- 
every doubt vanish at breakfast 
when captain golden appear and take -PRON- seat there be a patch of courtplaster as large as a half dollar paste over -PRON- left temple 
-PRON- angle of vision have again change 
so deeply impressed be i by -PRON- discovery that i be more than taciturn to the other at table even to mrs brackett who have put in an appear ance with clearing weather 
snap by a ropesend explain the skip per rest the finger of -PRON- mutilated hand on the patch of courtplaster 
that be an un common wind -PRON- have -PRON- add and everythin loose be snap for a while 
there be a brief respite of silence 
mr stubb tell -PRON- -PRON- have a rough experi ence last night mr lorry continue the skip per -PRON- voice easy and noncommittal 
nothing to speak of i answer with a quieting glance into miss apprehen sive face 
a a to ur excuse -PRON- i go on deck 
so captain golden be the man who have lay for -PRON- forward of the galley 
-PRON- seem incredible that the skipper should descend to such cool villainy 
and the cunning of -PRON- 
for -PRON- have leave -PRON- oilskin on the cabin table for tacit evidence that -PRON- be in -PRON- state why should -PRON- want to get rid of -PRON- 
be i not the one from whom -PRON- be to receive -PRON- hire 
there could be but one answer to the question that burn in -PRON- brain 
golden and vandeleur have exchange confidence and if appearance speak rightly have go into a conspiracy 
with -PRON- out of the way the two rogue could have intimidate the two woman and force a confessionfrom mrs brackett at leastof the detail of -PRON- mission which -PRON- be hold back 
suppose i have be throw over the rail in the soueaster 
not a soul aboard save the two most nearly concerned in the plot would have know that -PRON- be not the result of accident 
receive a doubt of golden from logy bill a a to four at the last moment i be a fool for not break -PRON- contract lose the advancemoney and hir e another ship 
the forenoon watch be the captain 
dur e the afternoon watch which be the mate anstruther come on deck and join -PRON- at a place where -PRON- could talk out of hearing of the man at the wheel 
what be that rough experience -PRON- have last night mr lorry 
miss anstruther ask 
vandeleur send for -PRON- at two oclock in the morning yy and -PRON- go 
the cabinboy say -PRON- have be hurt and want to see -PRON- i continue with a trace of a smile wasnot expect foul play -PRON- know but some one make an attack upon -PRON- from be hind and try to throw -PRON- overboard 
i see the quick pallor rise in -PRON- face and -PRON- small hand grip the rail 
miss anstruther i mur mure believe -PRON- i should not have tell -PRON- this have captain golden not arouse -PRON- curi osity 
-PRON- say mr lorry -PRON- return level i a a to four -PRON- steady eye at -PRON- that -PRON- would tell -PRON- everything 
but such rough wor be one of the contingency of this expedi tion -PRON- finish 
do -PRON- find out who at tack -PRON- -PRON- go on push straight for the nub of the difficulty leave -PRON- mark on the fellow i answer show -PRON- skinned knuckle 
-PRON- roll against the side of the ship and before i have a chance to find out who -PRON- be the blow from the bulwark cause -PRON- to lose consciousness 
but -PRON- could find the villainby -PRON- mark 
-PRON- touch -PRON- hand against mine as -PRON- lie on the rail 
do -PRON- look for -PRON- mr lorry do say scan the watch with the mate help and i go into the and look into the sleeping face of the watch below 
i also go to the galley and take the doctor measure 
the man wasnot in the forecastle or the gal ley 
-PRON- voice be intense and earnest 
no 
do -PRON- observe mr vandeleur particularly 
a a ter to ur why -PRON- wouldnot have the strength or the courage for such an attempt miss anstruther 
nevertheless i do observe -PRON- 
do -PRON- send for -PRON- 
and if so what be -PRON- excuse 
i tell -PRON- 
then as -PRON- mind travel swiftly along the various circumstantial link in the chain -PRON- pallor return and a look of horror fill -PRON- face 
captain golden -PRON- gasp and look around fearfully as though halfexpecte to see the treacherous skipper 
-PRON- reasoning miss anstruther say bring -PRON- to the same point which i reach this morning 
-PRON- will worry more than ever now and that be why i do not want -PRON- to know 
-PRON- be right that i should know -PRON- aver -PRON- lithe form straighten 
-PRON- be the main stay of -PRON- venture mr lorry 
vandeleur un derstand that and so do captain golden 
this be -PRON- -PRON- and then take whatever part in -PRON- plan -PRON- choose 
the mys tery the fact that -PRON- be go after a possible fortune have arouse cupidity and a a to four -PRON- have invoke the aid of the skipper 
ah -PRON- be plain plain 
and itit be fiendish 
-PRON- eye range forward to where vandeleur be sit on the main hatch blaze angrily 
hereafter -PRON- continue a resolute note in -PRON- voice -PRON- must go armed every minute 
i tap the sag pocket of -PRON- coat 
that suggest -PRON- to -PRON- miss an struther 
furthermore -PRON- pursue -PRON- must be wary and watchful 
everything mr lorry everything depend upon -PRON- 
i remain silent 
event seem to prove con clusively that i stand between mrs brackett and miss anstruther and trickery on the part of vandeleur and captain golden 
do -PRON- think say miss anstruther as though by afterthought that captain golden notice -PRON- dislike 
would -PRON- infer from that that -PRON- and i suspect -PRON- of underhand deal ing with -PRON- 
and if -PRON- do draw such an in ference could -PRON- have have anything to do with -PRON- experience last night 
-PRON- be a wondrously clearheade girl 
the a a to four more i talk with -PRON- the more -PRON- admiration be arouse by -PRON- perspicacity be go to speak with -PRON- about that miss anstruther i reply 
really i think captain golden notice how -PRON- avoid -PRON- 
cer tainly -PRON- could draw no inference from that to lead to the act of last night still if -PRON- could be a little more amiable -PRON- may be well 
be i to act a lie mr lorry 
the color creep into -PRON- face as -PRON- speak would not call -PRON- that say i hastily 
there be such a thing -PRON- know as be diplo matic 
in a way mrs brackett and -PRON- and i be in captain power 
this be -PRON- ship and the sailor recognize -PRON- authority 
when afloat a master authority be a fearsome thing for -PRON- be often a law unto -PRON- 
if captain golden think -PRON- distrust -PRON- -PRON- will do one of two thing 
either -PRON- will try to demean -PRON- self in such a way as to set -PRON- fear at rest or -PRON- will go -PRON- way and let -PRON- know that -PRON- do not care how -PRON- regard -PRON- 
whichever thing -PRON- do i add slowly the knowledge that -PRON- suspect -PRON- will render -PRON- more cautious 
-PRON- will be more careful to a a to hide -PRON- hand and hence will be all the more dan gerous 
for several minute miss anstruther be in a brown study 
at last a smile not untinged with selfreproach wreathe about -PRON- sensitive lip have be very foolish -PRON- observe but i be a girl of pronounced opinion 
when i dis like any one -PRON- be hard for -PRON- to dissemble 
be -PRON- equally generous with those whom -PRON- like 
what be that inscrutable light that flash in -PRON- eye 
what would i not have give could i have interpret -PRON- 
the word have no sooner leave -PRON- lip than i be angry at -PRON- presumption must go now -PRON- say ignore -PRON- que tion save for that one swift look see very clearly mr lorry that -PRON- wellbeing depend in a measure upon -PRON- 
please observe in the morning how good an actress i can beupon occasion 
-PRON- would act a lie as -PRON- call -PRON- for the sole purpose of disarm the skipper in -PRON- be half 
-PRON- emotion be conflict as i watch -PRON- flit from sight through the companion 
the uncharted isle 
for a voyage begin under such exciting cir cumstance the day follow -PRON- rough ex perience in the soueaster pass in an unex pecte dearth of incident 
i be at a loss to ac count for this except on the supposition that van deleur and captain golden be hold -PRON- ulterior design in abeyance 
miss anstruther be indeed an actress of no mean ability 
whether at meal in the cabin or with captain golden on deck -PRON- so favor -PRON- with -PRON- wit and -PRON- conversational charm that the crafty seadog appear fairly capti vate 
the skipper begin a stealthy and in some re spect ludicrous personal overhauling 
for in stance -PRON- notice one morning that the dingy green cotton shield which have cover -PRON- useless eye have be replace with a diamond of yellow silk on another morning that -PRON- have polish the brasswork of -PRON- coat and sponge from the cloth a a to four certain trace of pea soup which have long be in evidence and again that -PRON- torpedo beard have be freshly though bunglingly trim 
heaven know what captain golden mean by this 
the obvious conclusion be too annoying for -PRON- to consider 
nor do miss anstruther pause here in the sacrifice -PRON- be make for vandeleur also be much in -PRON- company and to all appearance rather high in -PRON- good grace 
i rebel in wardly at this and perhaps something of jealousy be mix up in -PRON- 
nevertheless -PRON- be as good as a show to watch the antic of the skipper and vandeleur whenever miss anstruther appear on deck and -PRON- be within hailing distance 
both man would hasten toward -PRON- strive to see which should be first at -PRON- side and the smarting vexa tion of the one that lose the race always fly to the surface 
at such time i have notice the dancing mis chief in the girl hazel eye and read the soft raillery in the demure line of -PRON- face 
natur ally there fall a grow coolness between gold en and vandeleur 
a a to four between two such monopolist as these miss hour on deck be so completely take up that mrs brackett and i have perforce to fall back on each other society for diversion 
i will not say that i fail to enjoy the elderly ladys homely view on life in general and on -PRON- expedition in particular but nevertheless i be conscious of the wax discontent deep down in -PRON- soul 
nearly every day there be period usually brief when miss anstruther and i meet by -PRON- self 
sometimes these come to -PRON- in the cabin sometimes on deck and i begin to observe a change in -PRON- manner as well as in -PRON- talk 
there be a faraway look in -PRON- eye an ex pression halfsad halfdetermine on -PRON- facewhen -PRON- be alone 
for -PRON- too -PRON- conversa tion deal in generality and be burden with constraint 
after a while this line of conduct touch -PRON- pride 
have -PRON- heart not be so intimately con cerne doubtless i should not have begin to avoid -PRON- as i do 
vandeleur continue to sleep in the focsle but resume -PRON- place at the first table in the cabin a a to four soon after miss anstruther begin to notice -PRON- again 
-PRON- have ever a cold eye for -PRON- and if -PRON- notice -PRON- at all -PRON- be by a curt perfunctory nod 
i wonder along toward the end of the out ward voyage if the rivalry and grow coolness between captain golden and vandeleur have any thing to do with the eventless day that troop after the soueaster 
be miss anstruther play a woman part to draw the sting of -PRON- conspiracy 
-PRON- pick up the steady trade about twenty five degree north of the equator and go foam e southeasterly night and day wing and wing -PRON- headsail blanket by the spread of canvas aft 
the ship wellnigh sail -PRON- and after -PRON- morning toiletalway punctilious and thor oughly attend tothe hand idle about in every available scrap of shade 
the skipper get -PRON- timesight in the morning and at noon take the meridian altitude work out longitude and latitude together 
i try to be around while -PRON- prick out course and dis tance on the chart 
-PRON- daily average run in the trade be two a a to four hundred and fifty mile but -PRON- have lose a good deal of time in the light and variable air off the coast 
captain golden have mark a cross on the spot where -PRON- uncharted isle be suppose to lie and i note with quicken pulse each day forward leap toward -PRON- destination 
whenever i mention fortune island the captain vouchsafe -PRON- a sarcastic look out of -PRON- expressive eye sail over this island of -PRON- -PRON- once tell -PRON- an just to convince ye -PRON- isnot there heave the lead an get no bottom 
this be merely talk 
if -PRON- really think there be no such island why have -PRON- and vande leur work together at the beginning of the cruise 
if the island be a myth conspiracy between the two would have be a waste of effort 
the weather grow warm and warm as -PRON- bear southward drop aboard and anderson get dolphin for -PRON- from the knighthead 
this give -PRON- a pleasant variation of -PRON- bill of fare 
for some day i make -PRON- a practise to mingle with the crew during the dogwatch 
-PRON- pre a a to four vious impression that the swede anderson and larsen be the only trustworthy man forward be confirm 
eph the doctor be a morose individual and incline to be quarrelsome 
-PRON- talk but little and -PRON- have a way of avoid a straightforward look that convince -PRON- -PRON- be tricky petie the cabinboy be no well than a wharfrat with all a shortcoming 
allison and minturn the american sailor have the face and hangdog air of a pair of beachcomber 
the kanaka be of a gentle but more crafty type of deepsea criminal and garcia the mexican be no whit well 
all hand regard -PRON- as the walking personi fication of a profitable mystery 
curiosity envy and hostility could be read in the covert glance cast in -PRON- direction 
in all except the swede this mixture of emotion be frankly brutal 
-PRON- investigation forward be make at the time i be seek to avoid miss anstruther 
several time i have see -PRON- alone on the poop look a mute invitation for -PRON- to come aft 
later i reproach -PRON- for -PRON- churlishnesslater when i have discover the cost to -PRON- 
a arter to four on an evening when -PRON- be nearly four week out of san francisco i stand look over the rail watch a phosphorescent glow turn the schooner wake into a pathway of gold 
-PRON- be the mate watch but i do not know where -PRON- be 
the man at the wheel be nod ding and the watch probably asleep on the focslehead 
the strong breeze which have not fail -PRON- for day have drop to a light wind but still come directly over -PRON- taffrail 
i be think as usual of -PRON- strange voyage and speculate upon the mystery to be reveal at the end of -PRON- 
suddenly i become aware that some one be stand near -PRON- likewise peer over the rail into the goldentipped wave 
miss anstruther 
i exclaim 
yes mr lorry -PRON- answer rest -PRON- chin on -PRON- hand and gaze at -PRON- through the semigloom have be want to talk with -PRON- for some time but -PRON- be so preoccupiedshall i say day that -PRON- have be difficult to find the opportunity 
-PRON- own time have be pretty well take up miss anstruther i counter and for a long a a to four time mrs brackett see so much of -PRON- that i be afraid -PRON- have begin to tire of -PRON- company 
and so -PRON- go forward to make a study of the crew 
do the man bear close inspection 
-PRON- be far enough from the wheel to be out of earshot of the helmsman and i could see no one else in -PRON- near vicinity 
two of -PRON- anderson and larsen will bear close inspection say but the rest be rather too much like captain golden 
with -PRON- chin in -PRON- hand -PRON- look off over the heaving sea fancy -PRON- murmur that -PRON- be vex with -PRON- 
perhaps and there be a trace of levity in -PRON- voice -PRON- find -PRON- too good an actress 
i do not reply 
a moment of silence and then -PRON- continue nothing have happenedto -PRON- i mean since -PRON- rough experience during the south easter would rather have face treachery every day from captain golden and vandeleur i burst out -PRON- surge discontent find -PRON- way to -PRON- lip rather thanthan a a to four i pause lamely realize that -PRON- heart be carry -PRON- too far 
-PRON- withdraw -PRON- eye from seaward and for a few moment peer into -PRON- face intently 
when -PRON- finally speak -PRON- be with a throb undernote that set every nerve in -PRON- body to tingle 
do not misconstrue what i have do mr lorry 
-PRON- can not know what -PRON- have cost -PRON- to follow -PRON- advice or how i have reproach -PRON- for -PRON- conduct even while i acknowl edge the sordid wisdom of -PRON- 
yet if -PRON- have safe guard -PRON- in any way -PRON- sacrifice of a life long principle have not be entirely in vain 
there be a sad little quiver in the final word 
one of -PRON- hand have drop to the rail and lie there whitely 
by a quick impulse i drop -PRON- roughened palm over the hand and the next instant -PRON- love for the girl would have be de clare 
quickly however -PRON- withdraw -PRON- hand with a rigid straightening of -PRON- body 
captain golden -PRON- whisper 
the odor of the skipper everlaste stogy be blow back to -PRON- 
-PRON- lounge toward -PRON- a a to carelessly with some remark concern the fail e wind and miss anstruther bid -PRON- a quick good night and go below 
an hour or two later i follow -PRON- light of heart than i have be at any time since the be gin of the voyage 
miss anstruther have virtually admit that all -PRON- have do have be for -PRON- 
from -PRON- dream that night i be awaken in the small hour by a pounding on -PRON- state room door 
recall another time when i have receive a similar summon i answer the call warily 
this time -PRON- be the skipper who stand outside and not the cabinboy 
what be the matter captain golden 
i ask 
matter enough -PRON- cry 
-PRON- con found island be right under -PRON- forefoot and -PRON- shall be on a lee shore in less than a brace of shake unless a miracle happen 
a mess of rock that s what -PRON- island be -PRON- hear the surf 
i do hear -PRON- and -PRON- be boom dangerously near 
-PRON- must have make a phenomenal run since a a to four noon i comment 
-PRON- be impossible that -PRON- should be near the place 
-PRON- must have be off a little in -PRON- reckon -PRON- island that s off -PRON- reckoning -PRON- fume 
but the lookout -PRON- swear roundly 
the lookout be asleep and here -PRON- be drift in there room enough to wear 
room but not wind enough a dead set toward the island and -PRON- impossible to claw off 
tell the woman to get ready for whatever happen an then come on deck 
-PRON- whirl and rush away while i begin scramble into -PRON- clothe 
a close call 
as i hurry from -PRON- stateroom i meet miss anstruther in the cabin 
-PRON- have dress even more quickly than i have do 
i begin to tell -PRON- what have happen hear everything that captain golden say -PRON- interrupt calmly 
if -PRON- want mrs brackett and -PRON- for anything mr lorry -PRON- will find -PRON- ready and wait 
i stare fill with admiration for -PRON- cool ness and courage a brave girl i say as i fling on ward up the companion stair 
when i see the vast shadowy bulk of the island in the dim distance the inexcusable na ture of the skipper blunder be bear in upon -PRON- 
-PRON- have have the deck when -PRON- come to such dangerous quarter with the uncharted coast and even though the lookout be asleep the skip per -PRON- should have be on the alert 
-PRON- have make a mistake in -PRON- reckoningof a a to ur that i be tolerably sure 
perhaps too at the critical moment -PRON- have be steep in one of those reverie of -PRON- and have not awaken to the peril of the ship until too late 
the schooner have be bring by the wind on the good tack to haul offshore and captain golden be anxiously watch the effect of -PRON- change of course 
but the move would not serve 
the current be drag -PRON- three foot toward the reef for every foot that the light wind help -PRON- away from -PRON- 
all hand be on deck silently wait for order 
the mate be in the chain watch the cast of the lead 
no bottom be -PRON- con tinual call 
-PRON- only hope just then seem to lie in find holdingground for -PRON- anchor 
off sounding be the despairing comment of the skipper 
may as well try to run out a line to chiny as to anchor here 
but if the boat be in the water -PRON- whirl on -PRON- with an oath remind -PRON- that i be a passenger that -PRON- devilish cruise be like to cost -PRON- enough and would i put a stopper on -PRON- jawtackle before -PRON- knock -PRON- overboard 
-PRON- have ask -PRON- to come on deck a arter to four and in any other circumstance -PRON- would probably have win a retort in kind 
as -PRON- be i hold -PRON- peace and stare at the smother of foam white in the moonlight toward which -PRON- be rapidly drift 
yet -PRON- be right about the boat 
the current be uncontrollable and -PRON- would have be useless 
reef of the pacific particularly coral reef be usually steepto on -PRON- seaward side so that only a jump take a ship from off sounding right into the breaker 
at that moment i wouldnot have give a copper cent for the lady chance 
quite naturally -PRON- thought of probable dis aster bring mrs brackett and miss anstruther vividly before -PRON- mind 
the skipper would have none of -PRON- advice as to the management of -PRON- ship and so far as the ship be concern -PRON- be welcome to the exercise of -PRON- own judgment good bad or indifferent but in the present in stance bind up with the fate of the schooner be -PRON- life and the life of the two lady 
i have a suggestion to make as helpless ness become more and more apparent 
16o a a to four with -PRON- permission captain say and the help of a couple of hand take the dory from the stern davit pull to leeward and try the sounding a slim chance i know but if -PRON- donot find holdingground somewhere be tween here and the reef well be stove in in less than half an hour 
i could see -PRON- one eye glimmer balefully in the dusk consequently -PRON- answer be a surprise 
go ahead -PRON- growl if -PRON- will be any sat isfaction to -PRON- 
give -PRON- anderson and larsen say -PRON- call the two man aft give -PRON- -PRON- order and the dory be get into the water 
in less than five minute -PRON- be foam to lee ward the swede bend to -PRON- oar while i stand in the sternsheet and make frequent cast with the handlead 
i have already make up -PRON- mind that the island be not of coral formationit bulk too large against the moonlit sky for that 
more likely -PRON- be of volcanic origin and i have hope of get te bottom at some point nearer the outlying reef 
i be presently able to see as well as to hear a a to four the long formidable groundswell as -PRON- break over the rock and churn the space beyond into seethe white 
as i survey the creaming ridge and the cur rent suck -PRON- steadily toward -PRON- i notice what look like a belt of smooth water pierce the line of breaker 
-PRON- be perhaps forty fathom away and i swerve the dory to a course that would lay -PRON- well into the smooth belt hope in -PRON- soul that -PRON- may prove a swashway lead to safe anchorage beyond 
-PRON- surmise be correct 
i get bottom at ten fathom in the swashway and beyond in com paratively quiet water at eight fathom 
this be infinitely more than i have dare to hope for 
the dory be put about and -PRON- fight -PRON- way back through the passage 
the ship be still steer by the wind and still set in toward the reef at frightful speed 
ahoy the schoon 
i call 
well come hoarse response 
have -PRON- steerageway captain golden 
just about 
then follow the dory if -PRON- can and have everything in readiness to anchor 
a a to four do -PRON- know what -PRON- be do lorry shout the skipper 
mind ye donot make a bad matter bad 
a tart reply be on -PRON- tongue but i smoth ere -PRON- back 
for a short space i be in doubt whether golden would adopt -PRON- suggestion then with a feeling of relief i hear -PRON- order the helm up 
slowly the schooner bow fall off then -PRON- begin forge ahead with speed increase by degree 
i keep the dory far enough to wind ward to give the schoon plenty of room then at the right moment -PRON- dart into the passage 
thread that swashway be ticklish business for the lady may but i keep the dory in the lead of -PRON- sounding as -PRON- go 
a few minute take -PRON- beyond the reef and a few minute later the schooner follow 
stand in the sternsheet i watch until the lady may have gain the proper position when i shout for golden to anchor 
the roar of the breaker prevent -PRON- from hear much of what take place on the schooner but i see -PRON- wear smartly with -PRON- headsail and foresail come down 
the main boom be a a to haul amidship as -PRON- come into the wind and then the welcome splash of the anchor shiver through the boom of the surf 
the schooner take -PRON- scope of cable freely and be finally bring up 
i draw a deep breath and tell the man to lay the dory alongside think the old man can thank -PRON- for save the ship sir say anderson 
larsen agree with -PRON- mate and the tone of both -PRON- strike -PRON- carry more respect than an able seaman ever feel for a landsman 
the schooner have a safe enough berth for the present -PRON- lad i answer but -PRON- will be well to hunt a safe one in the morning 
-PRON- should have trouble in plenty if -PRON- cable be to chafe off on sharp rock at the bottom 
as i come over the schooner side the skip per greet be characteristic 
damn lucky i think o have ye go off in the boat an try for sounding say -PRON- the only thing under heaven that save the old hooker 
i let -PRON- go at that and go below 
mrs brack ett sit in one of the cabin chair wring -PRON- a a to four hand 
miss anstruther stand beside -PRON- try e to be of comfort the ship be wreck mr lor ry ask mrs brackett lift -PRON- distressed face to mine 
be -PRON- all go to the bottom 
no indeed mrs brackett i answer cheerily the schooner be safe at anchor and be a good eight fathom from the bottom 
thank goodness 
mrs brackett straight ene up and -PRON- face clear have zelda lookin all around for a corkbelt or whatever -PRON- be -PRON- use when there s a shipwreck 
this be the island -PRON- have come to find be -PRON- 
undoubtedly declare glad of that even if -PRON- do come near bein the end of -PRON- 
-PRON- and miss anstruther have well go back to bed now i advise and get all the rest -PRON- can be work for -PRON- ashore tomor row 
mrs brackett get up and totter toward -PRON- stateroom 
miss anstruther linger to say and -PRON- be -PRON- who save -PRON- mr lorry petie tell -PRON- that much then give -PRON- a daz a a ter to four zling smile before -PRON- turn to follow mrs brackett 
next morning i hear excited voice on deck and hurry up to investigate 
-PRON- cable hadnot partedthat much be evidentand i be at a loss to account for the commotion 
golden stubb and vandeleur be gather in a group by the starboard rail surveying some object through a glass 
this object i could see with -PRON- naked eye be the hull of a wrecked and dismasted boat break across the reef and with -PRON- stern just awash 
some other fellow blunder in here in the dark i reckon observed captain golden care fully study the wreck through the glass be the first letter an the next be now wait till -PRON- roll again 
ah ah 
there -PRON- hand fall to -PRON- side and -PRON- one eye range amazedly from the mate to -PRON- and from -PRON- to vandeleur 
holy mackerel 
why that s the old gazelle o frisco 
vandeleur give a jump and utter an astounded exclamation 
the next moment -PRON- turn slowly around and stare at -PRON- 
an enemy unmask wouldnot give the fagend nothing as the man say pursued captain golden again size up the wreck for chance when -PRON- brigantine hit that bunch o rock 
gene never cross -PRON- hawse but once but that be enough 
i never see such a misbemannered sou mixture o bear bufflo bandi coot an crockydile 
now that jone have pull -PRON- under though i reckon well not think of anythin but the good -PRON- have in -PRON- even if -PRON- do take a mikerscope to find -PRON- 
that wreck get anythin to do with -PRON- business here lorry 
perhaps -PRON- have and perhaps -PRON- hasnot i an swered 
as a matter of fact i do not know -PRON- self although the skipper consider -PRON- reply evasive not of a pryin disposition lorry go on the skipper with a snap of the jaw but -PRON- expectation be go to be knock flat aback if ye donot make up -PRON- mind to be a little more a a ter to four confidin 
i reckon that s all 
while -PRON- take a pasear below mr stubb an hit up the chow -PRON- would better get out one of the boat an look for a well anchorage 
before follow the skipper to the cabin i give the island a critical survey 
-PRON- look bleak enough from seawarda sandy beach border with a broken jumble of rock and back of the rock a steep cliff fifty foot in the sheer 
as far as i could see there be not a patch of green anywhere 
yet certainly this be fortune island 
the wreck of the gazelle bore vague but substantial testimony to that 
mrs brackett and miss anstruther be vastly interested when inform of the wreck 
the former come near to say something that trench directly on -PRON- mission but miss an struther give -PRON- a look that bring -PRON- to -PRON- golden notice the elderly ladys halfslip and the glance that have correct -PRON- 
-PRON- eye glim mere vindictively although -PRON- say nothing 
there be a change in the skipper treatment of miss anstruther for -PRON- be now brusk to the a arter to four verge of insolence 
have -PRON- be skulk about the deck the evening before i ponder and overhear some of the talk between miss an struther and -PRON- 
whether or no this be the case yet the skip per attitude toward the girl start -PRON- temper 
a short step farther and -PRON- should fall afoul of each other 
the mate exploration in the boat be highly successful 
-PRON- report a shelter cove with good holdingground a beach of sand and gravel easy for land andbest of alla safe passage to leeward when -PRON- be ready for sea fortune island lie under the northeast trade and to work out of the swashway against wind and current would have be a difficult proposi tion 
an accessible cove with a passage to lee ward however tide -PRON- over this difficulty 
mrs brackett and miss anstruther be for be row ashore at once 
if the doctor will put -PRON- up a lunch say i to captain golden land and spend the day on the island shouldnot like anything better answer a a to four the skipper than to stretch -PRON- leg on the beach 
an i donot suppose vandeleur will object to a day ashore either 
the lady and i will spend the day on the island alone i observe bluntly and bring golden up with a round turn 
for the work -PRON- be go to do -PRON- wish to have the island to -PRON- and even vandeleur be bar 
well sink -PRON- 
the skipper draw back and take -PRON- sizing ironically 
-PRON- donot have any idea now -PRON- drawl that -PRON- own every un charted turtleback in the two ocean have a very clear idea i frown that i be pay -PRON- good money to obey order 
-PRON- will set mrs brackett miss anstruther and -PRON- ashore this morning and call for -PRON- late in the afternoon 
with that i whirl on -PRON- heel and go to collect some trap which -PRON- be to take with -PRON- 
the impedimenta consist of a hundred foot of stout rope some candle and match tightly wrap in a waterproof cover -PRON- two re volver with a good supply of cartridge and the shortbladed machete 
the doctor have the hamper of food ready a a to four when i come on deck and the lady be wait e 
the dory be alongside man by alli son and minturn with captain golden in the sternsheet 
vandeleur have draw miss an struther apart and be protest wrathfully against be leave behind can do nothing mr vandeleur i hear the girl say 
mr lorry have entire charge and -PRON- and the rest of -PRON- must do exactly as -PRON- think good 
-PRON- interest will not suffer in any way i can promise -PRON- that 
the sailor watch curiously while i throw -PRON- trap into the boat and while i be help the lady over the side and golden be assist -PRON- below 
vandeleur rush up to -PRON- and shake a puny fist in -PRON- face 
by jove -PRON- cry if -PRON- donot act square with -PRON- -PRON- will wish -PRON- have make a show of -PRON- before the man i counsel in a low tone 
and -PRON- may rest assured vandeleur that -PRON- will deal squarely with youin spite of -PRON- trickery and crookedness 
thereupon i gain the boat and -PRON- push off vandeleur look over the side and glare a a ter to four at -PRON- until -PRON- vanish into a narrow high walled passage that lead to the cove 
the mate at the time be make ready to warp the schooner to -PRON- safe anchorage 
the passage between the rock be about ten fathom wide and thirty long 
traverse this -PRON- come out into a little lagoon shelter on all side by high bluff with the leeward channel mention by the mate opening off at the farther end 
in this small but perfect haven the roar of the surf be so deadened that -PRON- could hear the whisper of wave on the shingle 
an ancient volcanic upheaval have split away the northern segment of the island form the lagoon and leave the two channel to east and west 
on -PRON- right be a clifflike wall and on -PRON- left be a smooth slope beach lead up ward to a barren rift in the rock 
the kelpfringe shore give off a salty re freshe odor and i notice a rill of water flow e into the lagoon by a devious course appar ently come out of the cleft above the beach 
but there be no tree no verdure nothing but scoriate rock as far as the eye could reach 
yet the smooth still water the lap of wave on the a a to four gravel the grateful smell of the seaweed the heattempere touch of the tradewind and the prospect of an easy landing with a thrill mys tery near solution bring happiness to miss hazel eye and a look of compla cency to mrs face 
the one jar note be the skipper 
-PRON- be taciturn wear a black scowl and -PRON- single eye flash with ominous portent 
i imagine that -PRON- have not yet recover from -PRON- show of au thority 
-PRON- get the boat to the beach and i assist the lady to land 
i have thrust the revolver through -PRON- belt and after allison have throw out the coil of rope the parcel wrap in oil skin and the machete captain golden spring out on the sand and face -PRON- squarely word with -PRON- say -PRON- savagely 
as the man say one or the other o -PRON- have get to toe the mark an -PRON- high time -PRON- settle which 
mrs brackett and miss anstruther draw closer together the latter set down the ham per which -PRON- have bring from the boat and both regard the skipper with distrust and fore bode 
a a to four suppose say i easily that -PRON- have set tle that point when -PRON- sign -PRON- contract 
what happen afloat an what happen ashore barked golden be two different thing 
-PRON- money pay for the lady may an when yere aboard -PRON- yere cock o the walk 
on solid ground however yere no more to -PRON- than a castaway an -PRON- representative on the schooner be vandeleur 
-PRON- grin fiendishly over the quip 
vandeleur be -PRON- guest i parry sharply and not -PRON- representative 
in which case as captain to do as i see fit 
-PRON- be to anchor the schooner in this cove subject to -PRON- order say i sternly 
anythin ye tell -PRON- on shore go into one ear an out the other -PRON- snarl 
lord -PRON- as ye please on deck but flourish a double fist in -PRON- face probably take -PRON- pat tern from -PRON- any o -PRON- lip an stave in -PRON- headlight 
i turn to the lady 
miss anstruther i request please take mrs brackett and go up to that arroyo yonder 
two the page a a to four as i speak i point to the cleft in the hill above the beach 
no -PRON- object firmly -PRON- will stay right here 
captain and here -PRON- turn appealingly toward golden surely -PRON- understand that -PRON- be as much under mr authority while -PRON- be on the island as -PRON- be while -PRON- be on the ship none o -PRON- putin -PRON- growl duck -PRON- head toward the girl -PRON- any way like to know 
helpin lorry hey 
playin off -PRON- an vandeleur against each other with that glibgabbed tongue o -PRON- i suffer -PRON- to get that far but flesh and blood could stand no more 
i let -PRON- have the weight of -PRON- fist on the point of -PRON- heavy low jaw and -PRON- sprawl backward flat on the sand with heel in the air 
allison and minturn start toward -PRON- but i whip out one of the revolver and -PRON- drop back 
avast -PRON- two 
i cry sharply 
help the skipper into the boat and pull back to the schoon the word -PRON- lad 
captain golden lay heave on the beach like a a a to four gudgeon that have be overlong out of the water 
-PRON- be stunned and bewilder almost uncon scious 
the sailor lift -PRON- into the boat push off tumble aboard -PRON- and fall to with the oar 
i put the coil of rope over -PRON- shoulder pick up the oilskin parcel the machete and the hamper and start up the slope of the beach 
come miss anstruther say bring mrs brackett and let -PRON- go about -PRON- work shouldnot have do that mr lor ry murmur the girl a mist of tear in -PRON- eye as -PRON- look after the retreat boat 
-PRON- push -PRON- beyond endurance i answer shortly know but -PRON- wasnot policy 
there be time miss anstruther when -PRON- be a man part to throw policy to the wind 
that be one of the time 
then i march on up the slope -PRON- compan ion follow slowly and talk excitedly as -PRON- come 
a gruesome fend 
miss anstruther be right 
lay violent hand on the skipper at that stage of -PRON- under take be far from be good policy 
yet give the same excuse i should have repeat the lesson and defy the consequence 
i couldnot understand what have come over the man 
i know -PRON- be fond of -PRON- bottle and i have be tell that -PRON- go to excess with -PRON- when in port or when lay up elsewhere so the schooner could spare -PRON- and i could only imagine that -PRON- have take a drop too much that morning 
-PRON- be a bad beginning for -PRON- work on the island and i feel sure -PRON- companion would be depress by -PRON- 
at the opening of the cleft through the hill i pause and wait for the lady to come up with -PRON- 
as -PRON- be come slowly i have time to lay down the stuff i be carry and climb to the high bank 
from that elevated point i obtain a good view of the entire island 
-PRON- be small and light a a to tle more than the top of a submarine mountain push above the surface of the sea 
in shape the island be an irregular circle higher toward the west and diminish in a series of step toward the east 
-PRON- whole ex tent be cross and recrosse with rocky and dismally barren ridge 
follow the angling cleave with -PRON- eye i observe farther eastward a thin strip of green grass border the brook 
this be all the herbage i could see 
there be a bend in the cleft however just beyond the grass and what lie farther on could only be ascertain by investigation 
slip down the sterile hillside i rejoin -PRON- compan ion 
do -PRON- see -PRON- promised land from up there mr lorry ask miss anstruther seek bravely to hide the perturbation arouse by the affair on the beach 
-PRON- be a very barren land i smile so far as tropical island go 
still -PRON- do not come here hunt breadfruit and coconut so -PRON- have no cause to feel discouraged 
the most promising a a to four thing on the island be this valley and -PRON- will fol low the brook 
before pick up -PRON- burden i knelt and take a drink of the water 
-PRON- be deliciously cool and sweet 
open the hamper i take out a tin cup and fill -PRON- for mrs brackett 
mrs brackett be not so successful at hide -PRON- feeling as be miss anstruther and -PRON- continue to be very nervous and excited 
never theless between -PRON- miss anstruther and i suc ceede in calm -PRON- fear 
a hundred yard bring -PRON- to the narrow carpet of grass and another hundred yard take -PRON- around the turn in the valley 
here -PRON- make a discovery indeed for -PRON- come upon a small hut evidently build of material from the wreck of the gazelle house cry mrs brackett then impel by a wild but pathetic impulse -PRON- hurry for ward call tom 
tom 
miss anstruther and linger behind for a moment exchange sad glance isnot possible there be any one here be -PRON- mr lorry the girl ask think no doubt of the possibility of find -PRON- brother 
a a to four i shake -PRON- head 
if -PRON- find any one here -PRON- would probably be some one from the wreck of the gazelle say and -PRON- may be sure that if there be any castaway on the island -PRON- would long since have make -PRON- known to -PRON- 
i note the hut wonderingly as -PRON- approach 
-PRON- be side with sandalwood strip and roof with a couple of hatchcover rotten tarpaulin fill out the space between the wall 
a section of cabin skylight serve for a window and the door have evidently once close the entrance to a stateroom 
a stovepipe project from the roof 
the hut contain but a single room and there be four berth arrange against the wall in two tier 
the floor be of sand and a table stand in the center of -PRON- with four chair place one at each side in orderly fashion 
at one end of the room be a galley stove 
not far from the stove be a boxcupboard swing against the wall 
neatly pile in the cup board be four tin plate four tin cup four spoon four knife and fork 
in a corner close to the cupboard be a pile of tin meat and vegetable also a bag of a a to four moldy ship bread overturn and spill out on the floor 
there be blanket in the bunk and a smoky smell about the interior of the hut that suggest human habitation 
miss anstruther and i stand just within the door while -PRON- make -PRON- survey 
mrs brackett -PRON- wild hope disappoint lean dispiritedly against the table 
tom ainot here -PRON- say dully there ainot any one here 
-PRON- didnot really expect to find -PRON- son do -PRON- mrs brackett 
i ask gently 
why not -PRON- burst out 
why shouldnot i expect to find tom i want to know -PRON- think -PRON- have anything to do with send -PRON- here mr lorry 
who send -PRON- here be still a mystery as well as why -PRON- be send here 
the teakwood case begin miss an struther and pause 
the ten teakwood case i finish -PRON- shall doubtless find in the seacavern 
what -PRON- contain will probably be -PRON- sole reward for com e here 
apart from thatand even that be suppositionwe know nothing 
a a to ur all the furnishing of the hut suggest miss anstruther seem to be make up of group of four 
plainly -PRON- deduce with a specula tive air there be four survivor of the wreck of the gazelle 
and i would hazard the opinion i add that those four be captain eugene trent archibald anstruther thomas brackett and ar thur mayhew 
if -PRON- boy be here demand mrs brack ett -PRON- reason obscure by hope and anxiety then why ainot -PRON- here now 
perhaps -PRON- be all take away by a ship say miss anstruther 
if -PRON- be take away by a ship -PRON- would have come home to -PRON- persist mrs brackett 
no -PRON- go on after a moment -PRON- voice quiver with conviction if tom be here then -PRON- s here nowand go to find -PRON- 
the poor woman for whose grief and despair miss anstruther and i have nothing but deep compassion leave the hut and start along a faint path that lead onward down the slope of the bleak valley 
miss anstruther and i follow -PRON- 
a pile of broken and splintered wreckage lie a a to four back of the hut and seemingly have furnish the castaway with firewood 
not far from the wreckage the ground be litter with empty meat and vegetable tin 
the castaway whoever -PRON- be i ven ture must have remain on the island for some time 
this pathway be well worn and be still easily follow although month must have pass since -PRON- be last use 
miss anstruther do not answer 
-PRON- head be bow in pensive thought 
mrs brackett be not the only one to be grievously disap pointed 
the girl i know have entertain hope of find -PRON- brother somewhere along that trail of mystery 
the path end at a spring which bubble out of the rock drop into a pool and then trick lead away down the valley 
mrs brackett have keep on and vanish from sight around another turn that lie ahead of -PRON- 
miss anstruther and i follow suddenly ac celerate -PRON- pace when a plaintive griefstrick en cry smote upon -PRON- ear from the distance 
wonder and fearful -PRON- hasten around a a a to four project spur of rock and find mrs brackett upon -PRON- knee beside an oblong mound 
there be four of the mound for the sig nificant grouping of four be carry out even here 
at each mound be a headboard neatly square and neatly letter 
each character in the several inscription have be painstakingly carve in the wood 
the legend on the headboard of the first grave where mrs brackett be kneel read thus sacred to the memory of thomas brackett who die of injury receive during the wreck of the gazelle 
miss anstruther and i read the inscription and pass slowly on to the next grave 
here the inscription be identically the same except that the board bear the name of archibald an struther 
the girl lean against the head board and bury -PRON- face in -PRON- hand 
i go on to the next mound 
under that lay captain eugene trent who have likewise meet -PRON- end through the wrecking of -PRON- illfate brigantine 
there be no one to mourn for captain trent 
even have vandeleur be there there would have a a to be no sorrowing over the grave of the dead skipper 
the next mound i feel sure would hide one of -PRON- own kin 
but in this i be mistake 
the headboard mark the final restingplace of three sailor whose body have be wash ashore 
i stand beside that last grave and ponder 
what have become of -PRON- cousin arthur may hew -PRON- must have be -PRON- who have lay away the other and have erect the headboard with -PRON- inscription 
naturally there would have be mo one leave to perform the last sad rite when -PRON- turn come 
why have -PRON- not find -PRON- remain in the hut 
surely there if anywhere -PRON- end would have overtake -PRON- 
then come another thought have not the same hand that have lay away these man and so carefully commemorate -PRON- last restingplace be the one to send those four card -PRON- sev eral way 
if such be the case then arthur mayhew a a to must still be among the living 
yet if so why be -PRON- not there in person 
why have -PRON- quar tere that card of instruction 
above all why be -PRON- not claim -PRON- share of the content suppose to be in the ten teakwood case 
the word be sometimes inadequate to express -PRON- true feeling 
i find -PRON- so in try to do full justice to zelda courage and helpfulness at this dark period of -PRON- fortune 
-PRON- gruesome discovery shock -PRON- into reali zation of the vanity of earthly aim and ambi tion 
i need the lesson and profit by -PRON- 
of late -PRON- mind have be grow more and more sordid in deal with the outcome of -PRON- expedition 
there be fortune to be have at the rainbow end and the thought of mere gain be always brutalize 
the sight of those two woman in tear touch and soften -PRON- 
if -PRON- enterprise accomplish nothing more than a knowledge of the fate of a son and a brother even yet -PRON- be worth the price -PRON- have pay in money and hardship 
in a little while miss anstruther come to -PRON- side 
-PRON- be -PRON- calm brave self again and suggest that -PRON- get mrs brackett back to the a a to four hut 
miss anstruther think that -PRON- could minister to the poor woman and stem the torrent of -PRON- grief with more success if -PRON- be re move from that heartbreake spot 
i silently acquiesce and -PRON- support mrs brackett to the spring and back along the path to the cabin 
an hour later when the distraught woman begin to gain some control over -PRON- -PRON- have luncheon 
after luncheon i pick up -PRON- coil of rope -PRON- oilskin parcel and -PRON- machete excuse -PRON- for a time and start for the door 
where be -PRON- go mr lorry ask miss anstruther 
to investigate the seacavern 
-PRON- look worried 
must -PRON- do that today 
i hate to have -PRON- go alone and yet i feel as though -PRON- finish with a significant glance at the bowed head of -PRON- companion 
-PRON- be in such a state of uncertainty with regard to captain golden i answer that i feel as though -PRON- should be no longer about -PRON- work than be absolutely necessary 
what i be a art to four go to do now i can do good alone 
will -PRON- remain here until i come back 
-PRON- look at -PRON- steadily for a moment 
yes -PRON- reply 
i hesitate for a space then draw one of -PRON- revolver from -PRON- belt and lay -PRON- on the table 
so far as i can see i go on there be not the least reason in the world why -PRON- should need that but nevertheless i be go to leave -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- will feel safe 
-PRON- thank -PRON- with a glance and i go on out of the cabin and start eastward along the valley 
at the spur beyond the spring i look back 
miss anstruther stand in the doorway watch e -PRON- 
-PRON- start suddenly to withdraw as i turn but pause and wave -PRON- hand encour agingly 
i lift -PRON- hat to -PRON- then face about and strode onward 
pass the headboard which stand as so many mute detail of the great mystery i ha stene -PRON- step and come finally to a place where the valley angle sharply to the south and to the sea 
climb the eastern slope of the angle i to a flat crest whose wall drop sheer a a to four downward to the breaker 
somewhere in that wall should be the entrance to the seacavern 
this the easternmost scrap of the island measure no more than five hundred foot across 
the average drop to sealevel from the brow of the cliff i judge to be about fifty foot 
to locate the mouth of the cavern properly a boat should have be use with two stout oar man like the swede 
for -PRON- a boat be mani festly out of the question inasmuch as the use of one would have give every man in the schoon an inkling of -PRON- business 
later -PRON- may be a boat would have to be use but not until i have investigate the cavern and map out a suitable course of procedure 
just now -PRON- business be to find the opening into the wall 
look downward the wall -PRON- give no suggestion of a breach 
but what the wall fail to tell the break wave make manifest 
there be one spot directly below a point mid way across the top of the cliff where the wave do not break against the rock 
there be no spray supposably because the wave find no obstruction to break against 
in other word the ioo a a ter to ur sea rush unimpeded into the mouth of the cav lie flat down on the top of the cliff i let -PRON- eye rove searchingly across the face of the wall 
a shelflike ledge jut out from the rock above the turmoil of the wave although well within reach of the spindrift 
the shelf could not be more than two foot across at the wide and scarcely more than six foot in length 
-PRON- offer foothold however and a point of vantage for further discovery 
rise to -PRON- foot i look around -PRON- and to the westward where the schooner be anchor 
the rise rock in that direction hide the ship entirely 
i be alone and unwatched and could proceed with -PRON- work 
-PRON- first move be to make the end of the rope fast to a boulder which lie on the brink and al most over the shelf 
in order to keep the rope from chafe against the sharp edge of the boul der i pad -PRON- with -PRON- coat on the side that be to receive the brunt of the pull 
also i cush ione the angle over which the rope turn down ward with -PRON- hat 
then i strip off -PRON- shoe and shirt tie a a to the oilskin packet to the back of -PRON- belt with -PRON- cotton handkerchief slip the machete into the front of the belt near the revolver and lower -PRON- over the brink 
use to ropework as i be the downward climb be not difficult 
i be pleased to note too that -PRON- old wound do not bother -PRON- 
a few minute bring -PRON- to the shelf and to -PRON- intense satisfaction i find that the shelf hang directly alongside the mouth of the cavern 
so far everything have go swimmingly and i be not long in discover that the rest of -PRON- work would have to go swimmingly if i want to get inside the cavern 
from -PRON- limited base of operation i gath ere that the opening into the cliff be perhaps forty foot across with -PRON- top a dozen foot above the smooth water 
pull off -PRON- stocking and weight -PRON- down on the ledge with the ma chete and the revolver i tie a bowline knot in the end of the rope push the rope through the loop and draw the bight taut around -PRON- body under the arm 
possibly i have thirty foot of leeway before i should take up all the slack of -PRON- lifeline 
this a a to four i hope would be enough to land -PRON- on the sub terranean beach of the cavern 
with a final look upward to make sure that all be right i slip from the ledge and be -PRON- be mediately suck into the black maw of the cav ern with dizzy swiftness 
so fierce be the inset of the wave that the current -PRON- upbore -PRON- with very little swimming 
when i bring up at the end of the rope -PRON- be with a jar that almost dislocate -PRON- neck 
for a few moment i bob up and down like a hooked fish the spray from the break current nearly smother -PRON- 
then i begin swim in good earnest de scribe an arc about the bend of the rope at the cavernmouth 
i be thirty foot from daylight and the darkness be so intense that i could not see -PRON- hand before -PRON- eye 
i swam into a wall to -PRON- left but -PRON- be an overhang wall with the bottom of -PRON- wear away by action of the water 
i sound ho ping to touch bottom but fail in -PRON- expecta tion and propel -PRON- to the surface again 
presently i strike out for the opposite side of the cavern and there -PRON- foot ground in sand a a to four and i grope -PRON- dripping way up a slope through thick darkness 
as soon as i find -PRON- clear of the water i sink down to rest and recover breath before continue farther 
in five minute i have take -PRON- match and candle from -PRON- waterproof covering and have strike a light 
the candle gleam fight ifeebly with the opaque gloom 
nothing short of a powerful arclight could have give -PRON- an in stantaneous and comprehensive view of -PRON- situa tion 
stygian wave roll out of a wall of shadow break over the sand at -PRON- foot 
an impenetrable curtain seem to surround and shut -PRON- in over head and on all side 
the hollow roar of the surf echo and rever berate thunderously between the rocky wall 
walk up the gloomy beach i gain the wall at ten pace 
keep close to the perpendicular rock i traverse an irregular halfcircle before i again find -PRON- way bar by the break surf 
i have skirt the confine of the underground beach and have reach the overhang wall i page a a ter to four which have defy -PRON- just within the cavern mouth 
turn back i retrace -PRON- course at a dis tance of some two yard from the wall 
not more than fifty pace from the turningpoint i stumble against something 
i stoop and sweep the candlelight over the object 
a box 
one of the teakwood case 
as though under violent compression the breath rush from -PRON- lung and seem to carry every ounce of -PRON- strength with -PRON- 
i sink down on the box and the candle shiver in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- have find the island the uncharted island lie where -PRON- mysterious instruction have place -PRON- 
i have find the cavern situate at the island eastern extremity and here in the cav ern i have come upon the teakwood case 
as step by step -PRON- have follow -PRON- strange clue i could look back and see that -PRON- confidence in the final result have wax strong and strong as -PRON- proceed 
i have expect to find the teakwood case so i be at a loss to account for that sudden rush of weakness when i do find -PRON- 
there be fortune in those ten box 
what a a ter to four the treasure consist of i do not know yet i could have stake -PRON- life that an equal division of -PRON- mean fortune for four of -PRON- 
but be there ten box 
-PRON- conviction in this regard be as firm as in every other never theless i spring up on the instant and investi gate 
yes there be ten case in five pile of two each 
i try to push one of the upper box with -PRON- free hand 
-PRON- resist the push like so much solid iron 
set down the candle i take both hand to the box 
i lift -PRON- barely 
the weight i place roughly at one hundred and fifty pound 
spur by feverish curiosity i hunt for a stone intent on break open one of the box to see what -PRON- contain 
i find the stone but the strong black wood resist -PRON- effort 
each box be strongly make and cross four time with band of strapiron 
only a cold chisel and hammer could have force one of the -PRON- be useless for -PRON- to remain in the cavern any longer 
i have find out all that i could and have make assurance doubly sure 
the next step a a to -PRON- be to consult with miss anstruther and devise way and mean for get the treasure aboard the lady may and safeguard -PRON- against a venomous skipper a treacherous companion and a piratical crew 
this be a task to call for all -PRON- tact shrewdness and courage 
with a final look at the black case shimmer e like ebony under the candle light i go back to the place where i have leave the end of -PRON- lifeline anchor to a stone 
the line be there 
whether -PRON- be high tide in the cavern or not i do not know but i care fully stow -PRON- reserve supply of candle and match high up in a niche of the rocky wall 
the halfconsume candle i plant upright in the sand and leave burn 
i could watch -PRON- as a beacon while -PRON- way along the rope and against the current 
place the loop over -PRON- head i drop -PRON- to -PRON- armpit and pull -PRON- tight then i throw -PRON- self into the water and begin draw at the rope 
-PRON- yield so readily to the pull that i mar vele at the amount of slack lie between -PRON- and the mouth of the cavern 
from marvel -PRON- mind leap to doubt from a a ter to doubt to fear and from fear to the horror of a supreme conviction 
the other end of the rope have be cast from -PRON- fastening at the brink of the cliff 
stagger ashore with the limp rope in -PRON- hand i sprawl backward at full length on the sand -PRON- stony eye on the mocking flicker of the candle 
the jaw of death 
all that the loosening of the rope signify do not appear at once 
as -PRON- power to reason re turn the vista of probability open with a plausible deadliness that take -PRON- breath 
i have protect the cliff end of the rope so well that i know -PRON- have not chafe apart 
neverthe less i haul -PRON- in foot by foot until i have the end in -PRON- hand and could examine -PRON- 
the wide loop be just as i have tie -PRON- 
-PRON- have be lift bodily over the top of the boulder and cast from the cliff 
with this to start from -PRON- line of probabili tie develop 
i have be watch when i make the descent to the cavern and some oneit may have be captain golden or -PRON- may have be hope to make an end of -PRON- by displace the rope 
-PRON- be back again to the situation as -PRON- stand on the lady may at the time of the noreast 
by eliminate -PRON- golden and vandeleur could a a to four work -PRON- will with the treasure and mrs brackett and miss anstruther would be power less to interfere 
but there be more to the present situation than that 
i have be see go into the cavern and this would point -PRON- enemy indubitably to the heart of -PRON- mission 
captain golden and vandeleur would come to that seacubicle by boat 
should i remain there unarmed as i be and allow -PRON- to kill -PRON- out of hand 
there be too much for -PRON- to live for 
i think of zelda anstruther and then again of the teakwood box 
if i live i may yet be able to protect mrs and miss interest no less than -PRON- own 
but in order to live i must not be catch in that cavern like a rat in a trap 
some thought of secrete the case occur to -PRON- but -PRON- be too large too heavy and the cavern offer no opportunity for secret stowing 
i may have roll -PRON- into the water but not know what -PRON- content be fear to take the risk 
no i would leave the case where -PRON- be a a to four and struggle to get away from the cavern 
and just here the enormity of the task unfold -PRON- 
i should have to battle with the current if i breast -PRON- successfully there be the pounding of the wave against the outer wall to be en dure resist that i have still the shelf to gain and finally there be fifty foot of sheer cliff between the shelf and safety 
as for the current i be a strong swimmer and -PRON- strength may even withstand the buf fete against the outside rock 
so far as re gain the shelf be concern i observe that the tide be rise and that -PRON- be creep high and higher up on the dark sand this would bring the surface of the sea nearer the shelf perhaps near enough for -PRON- to gain -PRON- without the rope 
once on the shelf i should have a revolver to -PRON- hand and if golden and vandeleur come in a boat i would be able to give a good account of -PRON- 
have hit upon a plan of action i set -PRON- immediately to carry -PRON- out 
traverse the beach until i have get as close as possible to the cavern mouth i take to the water and begin swim 
a a to four the current be not so strong from which i imagine that the tide be near the flood yet -PRON- be strong enough to make -PRON- work diffi cult in the extreme 
however i forge slowly ahead gain on the current inch by inch 
when i be well within the narrow wall of the entrance the heave of a wave throw -PRON- sharply against the rock 
grasp the rough projection of the wall i support -PRON- for a brief rest 
the wall give -PRON- an idea and when i resume -PRON- progress toward the light -PRON- be by reach from one projection to another and draw -PRON- self forward 
this call for the expenditure of a good deal of strength yet not so much as though i be swim in the middle of the channel 
-PRON- be probably half an hour before i reach the mouth of the cavern and find -PRON- clutch e a slippery point of rock in the outer wall 
above -PRON- be the shelf but -PRON- be not within reach 
again and again i lift -PRON- and try to catch at the flat edge 
the incoming wave hove -PRON- with sicken force against the jagging a a to granite and always i miss the top of the shelf by two or three inch and fall back 
with muscular power go fast and spirit flag i begin debate the advisability of re turn to the cavern to rest until the tide should be at the flood when -PRON- may be i could make a second attempt with well success 
in that dis couraging moment a nameless horror come zig zagge from seaward glide toward -PRON- by a series of tack 
what i see with terrordistended eye be a tall triangular fin the dorsal fin of a shark 
for a brief instant -PRON- whole body go lax then i give a frenzied yell and seek to dig -PRON- way up the slippery rock 
-PRON- hand be tear with the desperate effort and the slapping wave roll back from the cliff tinge with the blood of -PRON- wound 
the mon ster scent the blood rip toward -PRON- through the water the fin part -PRON- like a black streak 
i fall away from -PRON- insecure handhold 
use less useless be -PRON- agonize think a min ute half a minute and i should be pluck from the cliff face 
a a to four i know how pearldiver fight the shark drop ping below -PRON- as -PRON- rush and disembowel -PRON- with the thrust of a keen blade 
but a brown or a black man be safe from a shark a white man never 
still if i have have the machete lie on the shelf above -PRON- heaven know that no ex pedient would have be too desperate for -PRON- to attempt 
without the machete i be as good as lose 
i close -PRON- eye 
i do not think of the treacherous skipper or vandeleur or the treasure in that supreme moment i think only of zelda an struther 
robert 
the rope 
quick 
be i dream 
have thought of the girl bring the fancy of -PRON- voice in -PRON- ear 
something strike on the rock beside -PRON- 
open -PRON- eye i find the object to be the end of a rope 
i do not look have no time 
grip the stout hempen strand i lift -PRON- frantic ally toward the shelf 
for one horrid instant the awful fascination of death in -PRON- most grue some form hold -PRON- supine at the end of the rope halfin and halfout of the water 
a a to four hurry shriek the voice above 
i throw off the lethargy that have enchain -PRON- limb 
with one quick heave i lay -PRON- across the shelf 
a clash come from behind -PRON- 
turn -PRON- head i notice two bow of serrated tooth inter lock catch a glimpse of an ugly gray head and see two stare baffled eye drop back under the water 
a groan be wrench from -PRON- lip and i straighten out on the narrow shelf 
treachery 
i may have lie five minute on that shelf with the spray beat over -PRON- or -PRON- may have be half an hour 
spend and horrorshaken as i be time pass unheeded 
finally i become aware that miss anstruther be call down to -PRON- -PRON- voice quiver with fear and dread 
robert robert 
why donot -PRON- speak 
why donot -PRON- answer -PRON- 
be -PRON- hurt 
i rise to -PRON- knee and look up all right zelda i call back to -PRON- 
-PRON- save -PRON- life 
but for that rope i should have be a dead man by this time 
oh i do not want -PRON- to come here alone 
i tell -PRON- that i do not 
somehow i have a feel e that all would not go well with -PRON- 
how will -PRON- get up here 
climb the rope 
can -PRON- 
do -PRON- feel strong enough 
a a to -PRON- -PRON- be pleasant to have -PRON- so concerned about -PRON- welfare 
in -PRON- voice in -PRON- manner i read plainly that -PRON- care for -PRON- 
-PRON- strength return with a bound and i be ready to laugh at the danger that lie behind no less than at those to come strong enough to dare anything zelda i shout cheerfully 
just see that the upper end of the rope be secure and be at -PRON- side in a jiffy 
i see -PRON- fall to at the upper end of the rope take one halfhitch after another and belay over all 
while -PRON- be engage in this i be draw on -PRON- stocking and slip revolver and machete into -PRON- belt be sure -PRON- will hold now -PRON- call down 
be sure and hang tightthe shark be swim around off the ledge 
the triangular fin as i see be weave back ward and forward just awash 
that shark have have -PRON- last chance at -PRON- i laugh grip the rope 
here i come zelda 
up i go hand over fist come too a arter to four close to the edge i pant as the girl bend down to catch -PRON- arm and help -PRON- over the brink 
when i have gain the flat surface of the cliff top and while i be halfrecline against the boulder to catch -PRON- breath zelda fall at -PRON- side bury -PRON- face in -PRON- hand and begin sob 
there there little girl say i soothingly -PRON- bare arm go about -PRON- waist all over now all over now -PRON- answer brokenly think of what may have happen miss be as good as a mile i jest gaily 
just keep -PRON- face in -PRON- hand please till i get into -PRON- shirt and coat and then -PRON- will go back to the hut 
i have something to tell -PRON- and i know -PRON- have a good deal to tell -PRON- 
the walk up the valley will be just the thing for a little exchange of information 
i be not long get into -PRON- clothe and shoe 
-PRON- hat fortunately have not drop into the sea but lie on the cliff edge 
now say as i coil in the rope -PRON- have use please tell -PRON- where -PRON- get this line 
-PRON- be hang in the hut mr lorry a a ter to four that wonot do i object with a smile and a shake of the head 
-PRON- give -PRON- a puzzled glance 
what wonot do -PRON- query 
the rope be that part of -PRON- be well enough -PRON- the mr lorry part 
-PRON- just establish a prece dent by call -PRON- robert 
please keep -PRON- up 
the color mount -PRON- cheek be so excited -PRON- murmur avert -PRON- eye that i hardly know what i say or do be excite too but i distinctly remember the robert part of what -PRON- say 
i sling the rope over -PRON- shoulder 
now as -PRON- go back i add -PRON- may begin the talk have a foreboding when -PRON- leave the hut -PRON- begin drop in at -PRON- side as -PRON- de scend the slope toward the valley and i be that why -PRON- watch from the door way zelda 
i rally 
so that -PRON- may see the last of -PRON- 
-PRON- blush again prettily 
as -PRON- be the sole protector of two lone woman -PRON- reason demurely -PRON- be very a arter to four natural that -PRON- safety should be a prime con sideration 
oh 
i mutter 
-PRON- have be go only a few moment -PRON- proceed when captain golden and mr van deleur look in at the door of the hut 
mrs brackett and i be startle of course but -PRON- say nothing not here the skipper growl with a fierce look 
ask the girl say vandeleur shell know where -PRON- be 
captain golden do ask -PRON- and i tell -PRON- the truth that i do not know where -PRON- be 
oh well well find -PRON- 
captain golden de clare and -PRON- and vandeleur go on down the valley be alarm for i feel sure the skipper in tend do -PRON- some injury on account of what happen on the beach this morning 
so -PRON- follow the skipper and vandeleur out of -PRON- sight so -PRON- would not know i be watch -PRON- 
i take this with -PRON- 
-PRON- smile and for the first time i see that -PRON- have the revolver i have leave with -PRON- 
whether i should have use -PRON- or not if there have be nee i donot know 
possibly when -PRON- ad a a to four come to the pinch i should have exercise a woman prerogative andfainte 
not -PRON- i demur admiringly 
well i follow the skipper and vandeleur -PRON- go on and see -PRON- reach the top of the cliff look downward and apparently study what lie below 
-PRON- talk earnestly together and i hear captain golden give a fierce laugh as -PRON- lift the rope and throw -PRON- from the boulder 
directly afterward the two leave the cliff and hurry back up the valley 
as soon as -PRON- be go i go to the ledge and look over to see for -PRON- 
-PRON- revolver and machete be plainly to be see on the narrow ledge and -PRON- knowledge of -PRON- instruction make -PRON- positive that -PRON- have go into the cavern 
i call to -PRON- but of course -PRON- could not hear -PRON- 
then i reflect that -PRON- would need a rope when -PRON- come out so i run back to the hut to get one that i have see hang there get back just in time -PRON- finish after a brief silence and -PRON- know the rest 
now what do -PRON- find in the cavern 
ten teakwood box i reply and each of -PRON- will weigh a hundred and fifty pound 
i a a ter to -PRON- clap -PRON- hand and -PRON- hazel eye glow with excitement and delight 
then -PRON- be really there 
what be in -PRON- mr lorry shall not answer that question until -PRON- re vise -PRON- term i aver with mock displeasure 
now donot be provoke robert 
that will do i smile donot know what be in the box zelda 
-PRON- face fall in disap pointment 
-PRON- see i explain have to swim into the cavern so i couldnot burden -PRON- with anything that would help pry up the cover 
i do use a stone but the box be bind with strapiron and strongly nail 
-PRON- must be treasure 
undoubtedly 
-PRON- sigh softly be so glad -PRON- whis pere 
do the treasure mean so much to -PRON- 
i ask 
more than -PRON- can know 
i have a young brother to support and -PRON- have be a hard strug gle for -PRON- to take care of -PRON- sincesince ar chie cease to share the burden 
a a to four i echo -PRON- sigh for i know that the treasure be recede farther and farther from -PRON- 
mrs brackett too go on zelda be in sore need of money 
-PRON- have nothing and there be a mortgage on the home -PRON- husband leave -PRON- 
the treasure and here -PRON- wave -PRON- hand to ward the stark headboard which -PRON- be pass 1ng be a heritage from those who lie there 
who know but that -PRON- may have go down to death in seek to save the treasure for -PRON- 
zelda say i soberly -PRON- have ask -PRON- to keep nothing from -PRON- 
shall i do that now even though -PRON- may dash -PRON- hope 
-PRON- halt with a start and gaze steadily into -PRON- face 
yes -PRON- answer slowly have earn the right to know all have i not 
-PRON- have and i be sure -PRON- will appreciate the situation and make the good of -PRON- as soon as i call -PRON- attention to one fact after cast the rope from the boulder captain golden and vandeleur hurry off toward the schooner 
yes 
can -PRON- not imagine why -PRON- do that 
-PRON- have study the face of the cliff -PRON- have a a ter to four detect the presence of the cavern -PRON- be sure that i be inside the cavern and and -PRON- want to get boat come back and deal with -PRON- below there as -PRON- see fit 
the girl shiver 
who would believe there could be such scoundrel 
that be partly -PRON- object i admit to find -PRON- in the cavern unarmed and at -PRON- mercy 
-PRON- have another object too for -PRON- certainly infer that the cavern contain some thing that have bring -PRON- to the island 
if -PRON- explore the place as -PRON- undoubtedly will -PRON- can not help find the box 
when -PRON- do find -PRON- -PRON- will mean that -PRON- will consider nothing but -PRON- own gain 
in other word i firmly believe that the treasure be lose to -PRON- 
-PRON- would not dare -PRON- breathe with flame eye 
man like captain golden will dare anything 
-PRON- be make a dupe and a tool of vandeleur and i be certain that vandeleur will never get -PRON- share of the treasure either 
-PRON- will know too much for captain welfare and to push -PRON- overboard in the night will be easy 
the official log would show that -PRON- be lose a arter to through -PRON- own carelessness or sweep away in a gale 
but if -PRON- be on board -PRON- will not be on board zelda 
unless something like a miracle happen -PRON- and i and mrs brackett will never step foot on the lady may again 
then a miracle will happen robert 
heaven never yet prosper such rascal as captain gold en and vandeleur 
somehow some way -PRON- shall all of -PRON- receive -PRON- due hope so at least shall not yield with out a fight 
what will -PRON- do will leave -PRON- to explain matter and go down to the cove in order to find out if possible what be go on aboard the schooner 
please donot -PRON- beg 
robert 
every thing depend on -PRON- now even more than ever 
if -PRON- go down to the cove and captain golden should deal treacherously with -PRON- as -PRON- have al ready do and will continue to do think what would become of mrs brackett and -PRON- 
-PRON- be near the hut by that time 
-PRON- foot have be lag on the way ever since -PRON- have a a to -PRON- pass the bend in the valley and strike into the path that lead from the spring be think of -PRON- always zelda i whis pere 
if i have not meet -PRON- in that san fran cisco hotel i firmly believe that i should not have follow up this hazy and extravagant venture 
in go to the cove i be think of -PRON- inter est even more than i be of -PRON- own 
a warm light break over -PRON- beautiful face -PRON- eye dim with gather tear and -PRON- sensitive lip tremble ever so slightly 
then robert -PRON- say softly since -PRON- know how much -PRON- welfare mean to -PRON- i feel that i can trust -PRON- to go 
-PRON- hand be red with the wound inflict on -PRON- by the rock -PRON- hair be dripping and tangle about -PRON- eye and take altogether i be not very presentable even for an adventurer 
but i fling -PRON- arm about -PRON- draw -PRON- close and press -PRON- lip to her 
-PRON- flutter away from -PRON- and off to the cabin door and as i lose -PRON- around the next turn of the valley -PRON- be there watch and wave -PRON- hand -PRON- face flush and -PRON- eye like star 
a a to there be other treasure apart from those to be find in teakwood box treasure beside which the pure gold and the rare pearl be not to be consider 
for -PRON- i would not have barter that one moment joy for the con tent of all the teakwood box under heaven 
maroon 
the schooner lie snugly at anchor in the cove 
no sign of life appear about -PRON- deck and i hail lustily 
mr stubb rise lazily from behind the bul wark 
evening be draw on and while -PRON- be plain to -PRON- i be somewhat in the shadow and -PRON- appear in doubt as to -PRON- identity 
alloy the shore -PRON- call lean over the rail 
what do -PRON- want 
this be lorry mr stubb i shout wish -PRON- would send off a boat and take -PRON- aboard 
there ainot any boat mr lorry 
no boat become of -PRON- all 
i know that the schooner have three boat one at the stern davit and two on the deck house 
golden an vandeleur have go off ter circumnavigate the island 
why do -PRON- take the three boat 
bl if i know 
a art to four -PRON- have take the three boat and go after cargo 
there could be no other explanation aboard be -PRON- next question 
an anchorwatch consistin -PRON- an the doctor an petie 
when do the boat leave 
nigh onto three hour ago i guess be snoozin full an by most ever since an havenot keep much track o the time believe come aboard and have a chat with -PRON- mr stubb i volunteer ye come

what be -PRON- order mr stubbs 
to keep the schoon a cable length away from ye 
i like ye fust chop -PRON- mr lorry but there s be rum doin on this hooker ever since ye swat the skipper over the head 
-PRON- suit -PRON- uncommon ter pull out to ye if i have a boat or ter let ye come aboard purvidin order aginst -PRON- 
a a ter to four believe -PRON- mr stubb i call gratefully 
what be the skipper intend to do get -PRON- over -PRON- head now 
well -PRON- s no well than a pirate and have the law on -PRON- one of these day between -PRON- an -PRON- an i donot want ter take side 
i guess -PRON- understand how fix 
i do understand 
at that moment the head of eph and petie appear over the rail forward 
whatever the mate say and do would be re peate to captain golden so -PRON- have to bridle -PRON- tongue and act judiciously 
if -PRON- could have pose openly as -PRON- friend without incur the captain displeasure i feel that stubb would have do so 
even now i be positive that -PRON- be secretly friendly toward -PRON- 
while i stand there consider what should be -PRON- next move a dip of oar and a hoarse mumble of voice echo from the coveinlet 
presently three boat push out of the deepen e shadow in the passage 
ahoy the schooner roar the voice of cap tain golden 
eph and petie turn away from the rail to a a ter to four face in the direction of the approach boat 
as stubb answer the hail -PRON- motion with -PRON- hand for -PRON- to retire 
-PRON- get some salvage from the wreck o the gagelle go on the skipper an well hoist -PRON- aboard by the davittackle 
stand by mr stubb to lend a hand 
there be exultation in captain tone 
-PRON- manner of refer to the plunder as salvage be decidedly humorous 
ten box pipe vandeleur jubilantly from another of the boat 
those box be steal i shout -PRON- be long to three of -PRON- who be still ashore and to vandeleur 
i hear captain startled oath as -PRON- come rip across the water 
-PRON- be round to under the stern of the schoon 
then i hear -PRON- call of way enough and see -PRON- rise in the sternsheet and face the beach there be -PRON- -PRON- fling at -PRON- with a torrent of profanity think -PRON- have hove to alongside the bottom 
-PRON- tricky work with vandeleur didnot pan out do -PRON- be i a a to cause -PRON- have a decent skipper along that stand for fair play 
avast with that 
i shout angrily 
cap tain golden -PRON- be a piratical scoundrel make off with property that doesnot be long to -PRON- and live to have -PRON- up for rob bery on the high sea a rifle crack sharply 
golden have stoop pick the weapon up and fire from -PRON- hip be fore i could get an inkling of what -PRON- be about 
screen by the grow dusk i be not an easy target and the skipper haste to get in the shot have mar -PRON- aim 
the bullet sing harm lessly through the air 
lift the butt of the gun to -PRON- shoulder -PRON- sight carefully for another shot 
just as -PRON- pull trigger i see the stern of the boat veer swiftly to starboard 
the second bullet also go wild 
golden face the bow with savage fury 
that be -PRON- -PRON- damned swede -PRON- yell 
-PRON- lean forward and i hear the impact of a blow a notion to make o ye but look to yerself when i git ye aboard 
i believe that i understand what have hap a a to four pened 
one of the swede have pull -PRON- oar at the right moment thus disconcert the skip per aim 
i be grateful to the sailor but -PRON- be a rash thing for -PRON- to do 
i should have fire with -PRON- revolver imme diately after the skipper first shoot but for the fear of injure some one else in the boat 
as i be powerless to prevent the skipper and vande leur from carry out -PRON- design and know e that further threat be bad than useless i turn and hurry toward the cleft 
at the top of the beach i meet zelda 
-PRON- have be hurry and be quite breathless 
what be that fire robert -PRON- de mande 
captain golden try a couple of shot at -PRON- zelda 
what will that scoundrel do next 
i hear the firing and -PRON- first thought be that -PRON- have forget -PRON- promise 
any promise i make -PRON- i consider sacred 
please donot put -PRON- like that 
do -PRON- learn anything about captain intention 
all that be necessary 
-PRON- intend to kill -PRON- a a to four if -PRON- can and think -PRON- have already accom plishe -PRON- at the cavern 
-PRON- be equal to anything breathe zelda 
when i reach the schooner i proceed the skipper vandeleur and most of the crew have go and take all the boat 
stubb be in charge and -PRON- say the skipper have leave order not to let -PRON- come aboard suppose so exclaimed zelda angrily 
cap tain golden will not let -PRON- step foot on the ship again glad of -PRON- robert 
after what have happen i shouldnot feel easy a minute if -PRON- be there 
nevertheless zelda -PRON- shall have to go aboard the schooner and take -PRON- chance 
-PRON- would be plain starvation for -PRON- to stay on this island -PRON- know better that than that -PRON- should be shoot or throw overboard -PRON- cry recklessly 
then -PRON- stamp -PRON- foot and stare toward the schooner 
oh i wish i wish i be a man 
then i could help -PRON- as -PRON- ought to be help 
-PRON- have already help -PRON- more than any man could have do and what be -PRON- do down there 
-PRON- a a to four point toward the shadowy boat near the schooner stern 
-PRON- be hoist aboard the teakwood case i answer 
-PRON- receive the announcement calmly 
well let -PRON- let -PRON- have -PRON- teakwood case and sail away with -PRON- 
after all -PRON- be a small price to pay for -PRON- safety 
i be satis fie robert 
-PRON- turn to -PRON- and stretch out -PRON- hand 
let -PRON- go back to the hut -PRON- add smilingly 
-PRON- have a surprise for -PRON- there be not satisfied little girl i return ear nestly take -PRON- hand and before -PRON- return to the hut i want to tell -PRON- of a plan 
-PRON- isnot good to excite mrs brackett by talk the mat ter over before -PRON- 
what be the plan 
zelda ask suspiciously 
unless something be do -PRON- shall be leave on the island i continue be use to hard ship but that would not do for -PRON- and mrs brackett 
no -PRON- flash 
well then sir what do -PRON- want to do with mrs brackett and -PRON- 
-PRON- must all leave fortune island on the a arter to four schooner i insist 
that be good for lady and for -PRON- too -PRON- when -PRON- be on the schooner -PRON- be in the same ship with the trea ure and there be always the chance that some thing will turn matter -PRON- way 
well -PRON- ask impatiently 
if i can get aboard the schoon tonight and have a quiet talk with the mate i be sure -PRON- can reach some sort of an understanding 
what good will an understanding with the mate do -PRON- robert 
mr stubb will obey cap tain golden 
besides how would -PRON- get aboard 
swim shouldnot think after what -PRON- go through today -PRON- would ever want to get into salt water again 
there probably isnot a single shark in the whole lagoon 
-PRON- donot want to go aboard the schooner merely totalk with mr stubb assert zelda after a short period of reflection 
what be -PRON- real reason robert 
well i admit charily if i could make a a a to four prisoner of the skipper and bring -PRON- ashore -PRON- would have everything in -PRON- own hand 
-PRON- turn squarely about and stare at -PRON- 
-PRON- be mad to think of -PRON- 
the very idea of -PRON- swimming out to the schoon climb aboard then make a prisoner of captain gold en and bring -PRON- ashorewith every one on board against -PRON- 
-PRON- shall not attempt any such foolhardy plan as that -PRON- add deci sively 
but -PRON- must do something i protest 
will -PRON- take -PRON- advice robert -PRON- ask 
-PRON- be a girl of good judgment zelda and i should be glad of -PRON- counsel 
then do nothing tonight 
give captain golden until tomorrow morning to think this matter over 
-PRON- be do wronghe be do something that will make -PRON- amenable to the law 
-PRON- know all this and sober second thought will lead -PRON- to see -PRON- error 
in the morning -PRON- will all three go down to the beach and have a talk with -PRON- 
but where will -PRON- and mrs brackett stay tonight 
i ask in dismay 
-PRON- laugh 
a a to four why in the hut -PRON- goose -PRON- answer 
-PRON- be quite comfortable 
i shall be far more contented there than i would be aboard the schooner 
and there be the matter of food i go on remember what a terrific inroad i have make on the content of the hamper at noon 
-PRON- and mrs brackett must not go hungry 
-PRON- do not intend to go hungry robert nor to let -PRON- go hungry either 
i tell -PRON- -PRON- have a surprise at the hut 
will -PRON- promise to put aside that crazy plan of -PRON- and let further action lie over until tomorrow morning 
of course i answer but against -PRON- well judgment if -PRON- want -PRON- that way do want -PRON- that way -PRON- return with finality and so -PRON- will consider the matter set tle 
now for the surprise 
the surprise consist of a hot supper 
zelda and mrs brackett have find match break up piece of the wreckage for firewood and have build a fire in the stove 
somewhere about the hut -PRON- have find cof fee sugar and condense milk 
a tin of can meat and another of tomato have be open a a to four and there be enough bread leave in the hamper to supply the evening meal 
consider -PRON- sad discovery of the day -PRON- be far from be a jolly party but after so many week on shipboard i be sure -PRON- all en joy the land 
mrs brackett be pensive but i could see that -PRON- be slowly recover from the bitter blow of the morning 
-PRON- candle be all in the cavern so -PRON- have nothing with which to make a light 
evening be well advanced before -PRON- finish -PRON- sup per and -PRON- be something of a feat to find -PRON- own dish and keep from help -PRON- out of -PRON- neighbor 
mrs brackett and zelda make -PRON- as comfortable as -PRON- could in the hut and i take some blanket and go out of door to pass the night 
truth to tell i fear a visit from cap tain golden and -PRON- man for i choose to think that instead of pass a night in repentance -PRON- would be concoct fresh deviltry 
so i take both revolver and lay -PRON- down at a point where i should be arouse by intruder before -PRON- have a chance to reach the hut 
noth ing untoward happen to -PRON- however and i a a to four sleep soundly and awake in excellent spirit and mightily refresh 
-PRON- breakfast off the remain of -PRON- supper and then the three of -PRON- set off toward the cove for -PRON- intend colloquy with the supposedly repentant captain golden 
as -PRON- advance along the valley toward the top of the beach -PRON- fail to descry the tall mast of the lady may and when -PRON- reach the beach -PRON- stare eye sweep the lagoon only to return and rest upon each other in blank dismay 
the schooner have flee from the island some time during the night 
maroon 
i gasp 
dear dear murmured mrs brackett toss e -PRON- hand that 
i explain and the poor lady fall to sob and bewail 
as usual zelda make -PRON- -PRON- duty to soothe and console -PRON- and i imagine that zelda be not so grievously cast down by -PRON- misfortune as -PRON- may have be 
only the mate 
zelda and i have be keep as many of the serious detail of -PRON- situation from mrs brack ett as -PRON- could 
the good woman be naturally pessimistic and -PRON- aim to show -PRON- the bright side of the picture 
now in order to reconcile -PRON- with -PRON- lot -PRON- tell of captain treachery in the mat ter of the teakwood case and how -PRON- have lead to the further treachery of -PRON- marooning 
zelda show -PRON- how much safe and better off -PRON- be on the island than -PRON- could possibly have be on the schooner and so well do -PRON- talk that mrs brackett come almost to regard that barren isle as a haven of refuge and -PRON- ma roone a providence 
i hold the private opinion that zelda have feel all along that something of this sort would hap penindeed that -PRON- desire -PRON- to happenand that -PRON- be throw -PRON- full heart into the per suasion of mrs brackett 
a a ter to four -PRON- elderly companion seem to have but one regret the mortgage on -PRON- emmetsburg home may be foreclose before a ship take -PRON- off and carry -PRON- away to frisco in time to pay the in ter 
while the two lady be talk i climb the arroyobank and gaze to seaward in all di rection 
there be no sign of the lady may so -PRON- must have hove up the anchor and get clear of the island very soon after -PRON- teakwood case have be put aboard 
well -PRON- be console to know that i have save the well part of -PRON- patrimony even though the treasure have be lose 
i should have about four thousand dollar with which to make a beginning when -PRON- regain -PRON- own coun try 
from the blank sea i bring -PRON- gaze to the valley and look at the lithe graceful form of zelda as -PRON- move about mrs brackett like a minister angel 
after all what do i care for the treasure 
-PRON- be the treasure that have bring zelda and -PRON- together 
now that -PRON- have accomplish -PRON- a a to four purpose -PRON- may take wing and welcome 
i feel in -PRON- heart that a rich prize be to be mine 
-PRON- may talk -PRON- situation over i observe descend the hill and rejoin -PRON- compan ion 
-PRON- chance of be take off this island at an early day be not flatter 
what of that robert demand zelda 
-PRON- be a novel experience and i be sure -PRON- will en joy -PRON- 
besides -PRON- be sure to be take off some time -PRON- know the homely question of food i sug geste simple enough yet all important 
find some coconut brighten mrs brack ett 
there isnot a coconuttree on the island mrs brackett i answer gravely 
just as well sighed mrs brackett fold -PRON- hand with quiet determination to endure any thing donot think i should be overly fond of coconut for a steady diet 
i imagine -PRON- wouldnot be healthful 
but i think ship go every which way across the ocean mr lorry 
-PRON- have certain track -PRON- follow between different point i explain little farther to the west would put -PRON- in the way of boat ply a a to four ing between san francisco and the samoa island and if -PRON- be farther east -PRON- would be in the way of traffic between san francisco and new zealand ner of the pacific 
but this be an obscure cor the fact that fortune island be not on the chart be proof that -PRON- be seldom vis ited 
but well surely be rescue after a while wonot -PRON- 
mrs brackett inquire 
oh of course i reply indefinitely will plant a flagstaff at each end of the island so that whenever a ship pass those aboard will know there be people here who be anxious to be take off be pretty sure say mrs brackett that mr cartwright will take care of -PRON- interest for -PRON- when -PRON- come due know where i be an -PRON- s be a real good friend to -PRON- since death save enough out of that two hundred dollar mr cartwright give -PRON- to pay the interest wouldnot worry about that mrs brackett i advise leave a curstanthem in the parlorwindow at home -PRON- sigh regretfully donot know a a to how i ever come to forget -PRON- when i take all -PRON- other plant over to mrs henry i know as much as anythin in the world that be away so long that curstanthemll just dry up like a bone wouldnot fret about anything mrs brack ett i go on but try y 
goodness -PRON- burst out clean forgot about -PRON- carpetbag 
that ornery captain gold en have sail away with that too 
-PRON- never rain but -PRON- pour do -PRON- deary 
and -PRON- look pathetically into face 
i give over try to be of any comfort to mrs brackett and go down toward the beach 
there i make a find 
a number of object lie in a promiscuous heap a suitcase of the recently lament carpetbag of mrs and -PRON- own bat tere satchel 
over under and around these be half a dozen side of bacon two ham a cheese a couple of bag of bread tin of coffee tea and condense milk and three pair of neatly roll blanket 
surmount the pile be a large piece of brown paper weight with a stone 
i take the a a to four paper from the pile and read the follow writ ten in a cramped and almost illegible hand mr lorry didun hav no han in -PRON- an swoar wold not leeve ilan without this truck be putt ashoar for -PRON- dam sory but be only the mate respeckfuly stubb 
that be stubb for -PRON- 
wave the paper above -PRON- head i call to the lady and -PRON- at once hurry down to the beach 
-PRON- have one friend aboard the lady may at all event say see what mr stubb put ashore for -PRON- always think mr stubb be too good a man to sail with captain golden declare zel da -PRON- eye glow at sight of -PRON- suitcase 
mrs brackett pounce upon the carpetbag and -PRON- go through the heterogeneous heap parcel by parcel 
-PRON- begin to look as though the food que tion be irrevocably settle say zelda 
mr stubb have do a great deal for -PRON- i go on but -PRON- will do even more 
unless i misread -PRON- -PRON- will have some ship head for fortune island to take -PRON- off before very long 
here be a note -PRON- leave with the good 
a a to four zelda take the note and study -PRON- for a few there be a heart of gold back of that -PRON- comment 
-PRON- return to the hut carry as much of the plunder as -PRON- could 
after that i make half a dozen trip and soon have -PRON- all at headquarters 
inasmuch as -PRON- money pay for this i re mark laughingly as i put down the last load think -PRON- be fairly entitled to -PRON- 
the glint come into hazel eye as -PRON- always do when -PRON- be deeply stir 
-PRON- be minus a good deal of money rob ert say -PRON- through captain dis honesty and treacherous conduct 
the only pos sible way -PRON- could have be repay be out of the content of those steal box 
really -PRON- know and the eyeflash be follow by a wan little smile still have the feeling that those box will yet come to -PRON- 
i shake -PRON- head 
the box perhaps i qualify but not what be in -PRON- 
captain golden be too old a hand to let any treasure slip through -PRON- finger 
at luncheon that day mrs brackett be a a to four greatly depressed 
now and again some stirring event would lure -PRON- mind from those mound and melancholy headboard only to let -PRON- swing back once more and plunge -PRON- into deep sad ness 
and in a measure -PRON- be so with zelda 
but zelda be young and of firm fiber 
realize the necessity of bear up under -PRON- misfortune so that -PRON- may be of help to -PRON- and a source of consolation to mrs brackett -PRON- thrust -PRON- own grief resolutely aside 
-PRON- enforce stay on the island be -PRON- long or short would pass most quickly and comfortably if -PRON- could contrive to keep -PRON- busy 
i have already plan a few task but -PRON- chief concern be to lay out enough work so that none of -PRON- should be force into idleness 
grief i un derstood very well take firm hold of those mind which have nothing to do but dwell on -PRON- sorrow 
the first piece of work i have set for -PRON- i feel sure would not be regard with favor by zelda so -PRON- be with some misgiving that i push back from the table and prepare to broach the subject to -PRON- companion 
back to the zelda say there be one point in recent affair which -PRON- must not overlook 
-PRON- turn -PRON- wide hazel eye upon -PRON- with a questioning lift of the brow 
what point be that robert -PRON- ask 
perhaps i go on all the teakwood box be not remove from the cave 
golden and vandeleur must have have to work hurriedly and -PRON- may be that -PRON- miss some of -PRON- 
i be angle for an excuse to pay the cavern another visit and in -PRON- own mind i have small doubt that golden and vandeleur have make a clean sweep of all the box 
indeed i have hear vandeleur call out something to the effect that -PRON- have ten box with -PRON- in the boat short ly after -PRON- colloquy with stubb from the beach 
however i think -PRON- well to make sure and be bend -PRON- energy toward secure zel das consent to -PRON- plan 
no robert and zelda shake -PRON- head de a arter to four cidedly -PRON- both know what sort of man cap tain golden be and -PRON- know -PRON- would not leave that cave until -PRON- have secure every box 
at any rate say believe i will go down there again and see for -PRON- 
a shudder run through the girl and a look of horror cross -PRON- face 
-PRON- wouldnot think of such a thing -PRON- cry 
there be no danger i return reassur ingly now that -PRON- enemy have leave the island 
but the shark 
-PRON- be more to be fear than human enemy robert not one chance in a hundred zelda that there will be any shark around the cave during the short time i shall be there 
but if one should come say -PRON- -PRON- voice tense and -PRON- face full of forebode if anything should happen to -PRON- what would be come of -PRON- 
-PRON- must take no unnecessary risk would not do that i answer gravely and if i think i be take any long chance i would not mention the matter 
but i do not a a to four give the cavern a very thorough examination when i be there as the finding of the box take up most of -PRON- attention 
now i be go back again and go over the place more carefully 
mrs brackett lift -PRON- griefstricken face 
-PRON- may find something there that tom have leave mr lorry say -PRON- 
if tom and brother and -PRON- cousin and this trent have anything to do with put those box in the cave like as not -PRON- may have leave something else there toosomethe -PRON- may be well for -PRON- to find 
mrs brackett be prove an unexpected ally 
i could see that zelda be waver and that mrs brackett have mention something which have not before occur to -PRON- 
nevertheless -PRON- have an objection 
depend on -PRON- say -PRON- that whatever be leave in the cave be find and carry away by captain golden and vandeleur leave some match and candle there i go on and i donot believe that golden and -PRON- land ingparty could find -PRON- 
-PRON- could use -PRON- very handily now i reply with a smile 
then i get up and take down the coil of rope a a ter to ur which have serve -PRON- so well on the occasion of -PRON- first visit to the cave 
-PRON- and mrs brackett may come with -PRON- zelda i add and watch for shark from the top of the cliff while i be below 
of course -PRON- shall go with -PRON- declare zelda and -PRON- leave the hut forthwith 
when -PRON- pass the headboard in make -PRON- way along the valley mrs grief open afresh 
zelda slip an arm around -PRON- and speak such word of comfort as -PRON- own grieving mind could suggest 
as soon as -PRON- reach the turn of the valley and have begin climb the bank i be pleased to see that the prospect of -PRON- adventure be claim more and more of mrs attention 
as -PRON- cross the flat crest of the hill and draw close to the brink of the cliff mrs brackett pause fear fully 
mercy -PRON- gasp 
be the cave down there -PRON- ever get to -PRON- mr lorry 
and how be those box ever take down there in the first place 
cling to zelda -PRON- edge cautiously toward a arter to four the brink and stand look down at the lashing get down easily enough i answer throw off -PRON- coat and drop down to take off -PRON- shoe 
when the box go into the cave mrs brackett -PRON- be take in by mean of a boat 
if -PRON- have a boat at hand now -PRON- could all visit the cave and do -PRON- safely and easily 
the way i be go be safe enoughonly a light tle more difficult that s all 
be -PRON- look for shark fin zelda 
i finish laughingly 
-PRON- be stand close to the edge of the cliff and -PRON- eye be wander sharply over the smooth water to seaward 
yes -PRON- answer shift -PRON- gaze to -PRON- and i be easy a minute until -PRON- be with -PRON- again robert 
the look in -PRON- eye disturb -PRON- 
-PRON- be pleasant to know that -PRON- welfare mean so much to -PRON- but -PRON- seem brutal to play with -PRON- fear by go on 
i feel that -PRON- be due to all of -PRON- however that a second and final examination should be make of the cave 
-PRON- must know be yond all peradventure that all the box have be remove by golden and vandeleur 
a a to ur i be not long in knot a noose in the end of the rope and in throw -PRON- over the boulder with -PRON- folded coat as a cushion then i drop the free end of the rope to the shelf 
at that point i discover that this rope be short than the one i have use before but a mental calcu lation convince -PRON- that -PRON- would reach far enough inside the cave to answer -PRON- purpose 
both revolver i leave with zelda be certain -PRON- will not see any shark zelda say but if -PRON- do shoot at -PRON- 
that will give -PRON- warning 
-PRON- voice wouldnot reach -PRON- in the cave but i could hear a revolvershot 
-PRON- wonot be long 
zelda ask with an -PRON- be plore note in -PRON- voice as i seat -PRON- on the brink preparatory to descend 
not a moment longer than necessary i re ply 
meanwhile please donot worry 
with that i grip the rope and start down 
when i reach the shelf i look up and see two white face peer down at -PRON- 
that be easy enough i cry wave -PRON- hand and the rest will be just as easy 
remove -PRON- shirt and stocking i leave -PRON- a a ter to four on the shelf then tie the rope to -PRON- belt i plunge into the churn surf and race through the cavern entrance 
have go over the course once i take -PRON- bearing and proceed to make a landing with out any preliminary investigation 
as on the other time i be halt in a smother of foam when i take up the slack in the rope but i at once begin swim to the right and quickly find bottom 
untie the rope from -PRON- belt i weight -PRON- with a stone as i have do before then after a moment rest i fall to hunt for the niche where i have leave the candle and match 
luck be with -PRON- and before many minute have pass i be move up and down the subter ranean strand look for whatever i may find 
i discover many footprint in the damp sand and come upon the spot where the boat have nose into the beach but as for teakwood box there be not one to be see 
i be not sur prise on the contrary i should have be sur prise if i have find that even one have be leave 
have thus settle the matter of the treasure to -PRON- complete satisfaction i begin a thorough a a to four investigation of the cave 
i go at this sys tematically zigzag back and forth between the wall and the water edge and cover every foot of ground 
the sum of -PRON- discovery be a claspknife 
-PRON- be bright and new which be proof positive that -PRON- have not lie for any length of time in the damp air of the cave 
quite likely -PRON- have be drop by one of the landingparty from the lady may with a sense of keen disappointment because of -PRON- failure to discover anything worth while i make -PRON- way to the spot where i have see the box 
there by merest chance a flash of can dlelight on the wall reveal something that draw -PRON- instant attention 
a flat surface of the wall have be scratch deeply with some hard pointed instrument 
-PRON- surprise be great when i find that the indentation take the form of letter and that the letter group -PRON- into word 
not a little excited i push the candle closer to the wall 
the printing be in two line roughly do but all perfectly legible capt eugene trent brigantine gazelle arthur mayhew 9th a a to four that be all but brief and unsatisfactory though -PRON- be the word come like a message from the tomb 
trent and mayhew 
be -PRON- the one who have bring the teakwood box to the cavern 
if so why have -PRON- not chisel in the rock some thing about anstruther and brackett 
think i may discover something by search the wall further i begin examine the stone carefully and work -PRON- way foot by foot around the cavern 
perhaps i have be at this work for a quarter of an hour when i hear a sound that force -PRON- from the wall with a frantic leap 
the candle shake in -PRON- hand and i stagger unsteadily hope against hope that -PRON- ear have play -PRON- a trick 
but i be not mistaken 
once more the sound float in through the cavern entrance muffled but distinct 
-PRON- be the report of a revolver 
escape from the cave 
in -PRON- time i have hear -PRON- say of some man that -PRON- do not know what fear be 
per sonally i doubt if such a man ever live 
there would be no merit in courage if there be no such thing as fear 
but a test for any man would be to place -PRON- as i be place then immure in a cave whose only exit be by an arm of the seablockade by a maneate shark 
-PRON- life as a soldier of fortune have bring -PRON- face to face with many peril but never have danger play such havoc with -PRON- nerve as -PRON- do then 
and the fact that i have go into -PRON- recklessly and openeye in no wise minister to -PRON- peace of mind 
zelda have counsel -PRON- against take the risk and i have laugh at -PRON- fear 
drop nervelessly on the wet sand i peer with wild eye toward the entrance of the cave and upbraid -PRON- for be a headstrong fool 
there have be nothing to gain by the ven a a to four ture and everything to lose in case luck happen to go against -PRON- 
even if i have find a box of treasure how would -PRON- have help -PRON- in -PRON- sorry situation 
now when i find -PRON- trap i could conjure up a thousand and one reason why i should never have pay that second visit to the but if i have one think for -PRON- i have two for zelda and mrs brackett 
i picture -PRON- crouch on the brink of the cliff staring with terrorstricken eye at the triangular fin dart e through the water 
unable to aid -PRON- what must have be -PRON- hopelessness and despair 
this thought bring back -PRON- courage 
i have the claspknife 
with that in -PRON- belt and with the rope to aid -PRON- i would swim and fight -PRON- way back to the shelf 
before i set out on -PRON- return i watch the sunlit stretch of water that lead into the cave 
nothing strike athwart the channel to arouse -PRON- fear 
if i work quickly and make the good use of the rope there be a chance that i could gain the shelf unmolested 
pass hurriedly around the beach to the place where i have leave the end of the rope i plant a arter to four what remain of -PRON- candle in the sand wrap the rest of the candle and the match in -PRON- waterproof covering tie the packet to -PRON- belt and then plunge resolutely into the water 
the current buffet -PRON- roughly but the pull of the rope and the resistance -PRON- body offer to the current serve to buoy -PRON- up 
i have little swim to do and -PRON- way along the lifeline 
from time to time i lift -PRON- head and shoulder above the wave shake the water from -PRON- eye and stare about -PRON- 
the thing i dread i fail to see and presently i be back on the shelf overcome with a sense of relief almost as much as i be by the fatigue of -PRON- fierce struggle with the current 
robert a voice call down to -PRON- 
rise to -PRON- knee i look upward 
zelda and mrs brackett be stare over the cliff edge the shark zelda 
i cry 
-PRON- be a mistake robert -PRON- answer be sorry if -PRON- alarm -PRON- but -PRON- nerve be none too steady 
look 
-PRON- point as -PRON- speak 
follow -PRON- fin ger with -PRON- eye i see a bit of wreckage twist a arter to four and whirl in the wave 
i could afford to laugh now 
be that what -PRON- see 
i ask get into -PRON- shirt 
and -PRON- think -PRON- be a shark 
i make a mental reservation then and there that neither of -PRON- companion should ever know what a bad halfhour -PRON- have give -PRON- in the cave 
after a brief rest i start up the face of the fiftyfoot cliff finally get over the top with the aid of zelda and mrs brackett the last time i pant as i lie sprawl out in the sun that i shall ever visit the cave 
do -PRON- discover anything robert that make the risk worth while ask zelda find this i answer take the knife from -PRON- belt 
mrs brackett give the blade a quick look then turn away -PRON- eye disappointedly box be all go mr lorry -PRON- ask 
golden and vandeleur make a clean sweep 
i see where -PRON- boat have ground on the beach and where -PRON- have tramp back and forth load a a to four e the box but this knife be all -PRON- have leave behind 
but -PRON- get the candle and match say zelda quietly watch as i untie the packet from -PRON- belt 
all the candle and match in the world robert wouldnot pay for what what -PRON- go through up here on the cliff while wait for -PRON- to come 
i be properly rebuke and hope in -PRON- soul that never again should i see such a look of re proach as be then in hazel eye 
well say -PRON- know exactly where -PRON- stand now 
if i hadnot investigate the cave -PRON- may always have have the feeling that some of the treasure have be leave there 
now -PRON- know that all of -PRON- be take from the island in the lady may 
on the wall i bite the word off short wonder how -PRON- companion would take -PRON- when i tell -PRON- that trent and mayhew have leave sign of -PRON- pre ence in the cave while brother and mrs son have not 
on the wall flutter mrs brackett -PRON- face light with sudden hope 
do -PRON- find something on the wall of that cave mr lorry 
a a to four -PRON- be nothing of any importance mrs brackett say i gently just the name of cap tain trent and -PRON- cousin arthur scratch on the stone 
after name follow the two word brigantine gazelle and after 9th regiment why mrs brackett murmur that be regiment 
and add zelda 
then say -PRON- cousin -PRON- brother zel da and mrs son all belong to the same regimentperhap to the same company 
this show how the three may have be throw together but -PRON- doesnot help -PRON- much otherwise 
where do captain trent and the gazelle come in 
mrs brackett shake -PRON- head in pathetic be wilderment 
zelda give a deep sigh 
some time say zelda all this may be make clear to -PRON- but -PRON- be very dark and mysterious now 
-PRON- relative be in the brigantine with captain trent and -PRON- have those teakwood box with -PRON- 
the brigantine be wreck and four of those on board get safely ashore and take the box to the cave 
that be all -PRON- really a a to four know 
let -PRON- not plague -PRON- with surmise but accept the situation as -PRON- find itand go back to the hut 
-PRON- can do nothing more rob ert but wait and hope for the good 
i put on -PRON- shoe and coat coil up the rope and swing -PRON- over -PRON- shoulder then -PRON- retrace -PRON- way across the crest of the hill through the valley and back to the rude little shanty which have now become -PRON- home 
in the end i think -PRON- be all well for that afternoon experience 
-PRON- bring home to -PRON- as nothing else could have do -PRON- mutual need of each other in -PRON- forlorn situation and teach -PRON- to grieve less over what -PRON- have lose and to do more toward cultivate an optimistic spirit for the general good 
mrs brackett sigh as -PRON- pass the row of headboard in the valley but there be resigna tion in -PRON- face and a calm determination to make the good of -PRON- lot 
island day 
the pall of misfortune rest upon -PRON- but lightly 
the shadow cast by that gloomy row of carved board beyond the spring do not often reach the place which -PRON- call home 
never in -PRON- wildest dream do i think i could be so happy and content as i be during those day -PRON- spend on that barren little island 
-PRON- be the most satisfying kind of happiness too for -PRON- have -PRON- undernote of resignation which hal low -PRON- and give -PRON- the ring of true worth 
the tradewind blow almost constantly from the northeast temper the heat of the shadeless valley 
so far from induce languor the air be like wine and inspire to effort 
zelda work by -PRON- side in the several out door task -PRON- set for -PRON- help to plan as well as to execute 
mrs brackett assume charge of the house and the culinary operation 
from the wreckage near the hut zelda and i dig out one of the brigantine upper yard 
a art to four this i hack in two at the middle with the ma chete and -PRON- carry one half to the eastern end of the island and the other half to the western end 
-PRON- set -PRON- up on the high elevation plant -PRON- firmly in a nest of stone 
then -PRON- make two streamer out of a white blanket which -PRON- have find in the hut use needle and coarse thread donate by mrs brackett out of the content of -PRON- carpetbag 
these stream ers -PRON- fly from the top of -PRON- flagpole ho ping -PRON- would attract the notice of any wander e ship that chance to pass in -PRON- vicinity 
while -PRON- still have faith that stubb would send a vessel to pick -PRON- up yet -PRON- feel that -PRON- should do everything possible to hasten -PRON- rescue 
when the pole be set and the streamer in place zelda and i have other work come to -PRON- hand in the sand opposite the point where the gazelle have meet -PRON- fate -PRON- discov ere a whaleboat 
the boat have be badly stove in aft but -PRON- be sound forward as zelda and i find when -PRON- have dig -PRON- out of the beach 
repair -PRON- robert say zelda 
what for 
i query mentally weigh the task and -PRON- mean for accomplish -PRON- 
a a to four so -PRON- can take -PRON- to see the cavern and so -PRON- can pay a visit to the gazelle 
i have long want to visit the wreck of the brigantine -PRON- just to see if anything could be find that would throw light upon the situa tion -PRON- have encounter on the island suggestion be a good one and -PRON- start to carry -PRON- out 
-PRON- work on the beach transport -PRON- slen der supply of material from the hut 
the re pair on the whaleboat be never finish for the reason that -PRON- be interrupt in -PRON- long task by a rescue but i look back on that era of planning and work as one of the most delight ful period of -PRON- life 
-PRON- have the machete and -PRON- have a butcher knife 
of the latter -PRON- make a saw serrate -PRON- straight edge with piece of flint 
one entire day be consume in the manufac ture of the saw and i remember the joy with which zelda see -PRON- haggle -PRON- through a piece of board 
i be half an hour get through six inch of pine and -PRON- applaud heartily when i straighten erect with the two piece of board in -PRON- hand 
a a ter to four -PRON- prospective operation be all detailed in advance 
-PRON- be to get nail from the wreck age unlay rope to get material for calking and -PRON- be to try to make a cement from powdered shell as a substitute for pitch 
the first step be to saw the whaleboat in two just forward of the wreck stern 
this -PRON- ac complishe in three day 
an oak sternpost be work out with the machete and a knife make fast to the shortened keel of the whaleboat and strengthen with a sternpostknee 
then -PRON- begin cut out the lumber to fill in the gap at the square stern 
while i gouge away with the butcherknife see and pound with a stone hammer zelda sit on the beach beside -PRON- unlaye rope for calk 
where do -PRON- suppose those ten teakwood box come from robert -PRON- once ask -PRON- 
-PRON- talk a great deal while -PRON- work and -PRON- illfated expedition be a neverfaile topic get -PRON- guess as the man say and i give -PRON- a quizzical glance from the clew of one eye somehow suggest china to -PRON- i add a moment later 
a arter to four have -PRON- ever try to guess how those teak wood case come to be in the gazelle 
no zelda 
i have never even try to guess how thomas brackett -PRON- cousin arthur or -PRON- brother archie come to be in the gazelle 
-PRON- be soldier and supposedly off some where in the philippine or in china 
what be -PRON- do on captain brigantine with ten teakwood case a condition of affair that defy analysis 
some one of the four send -PRON- those card with instruction to meet at the palace hotel on april twentyfifth 
presumably that be -PRON- cousin arthur 
-PRON- must have be 
presumably also -PRON- be take off this island for -PRON- could never have send the card from here 
why do -PRON- deal through lawyer instead of send the card directly to -PRON- 
in -PRON- case zelda -PRON- be impossible for -PRON- to deal directly with -PRON- as -PRON- do not know -PRON- address 
i have be a rolling stone -PRON- know and roll stone be proverbially hard to find 
-PRON- cousin i think deal with only one law a arter to four yer robert and that be mr price 
if so -PRON- cousin must have be in san francisco 
if arthur be in san francisco say i in credulously why do -PRON- not come to see -PRON- 
why do -PRON- not help -PRON- with advice give ex planation or even join the expedition 
-PRON- may have be unable to do so or perhaps -PRON- have some good reason for hang back 
i shake -PRON- head hopelessly bootless to do any surmising now zelda treasure have vanish and the mystery will probably remain unsolved 
the treasure will return and the mystery will be solve -PRON- assert with quiet convic tion 
day after day -PRON- labor on 
-PRON- come to be completely wrap up in the rejuvenation of that whaleboat rush to the hut for -PRON- meal and then rush off again with hardly half a dozen word for mrs brackett 
two week slip away 
most unexpectedly the lapse of the fortnight bring -PRON- to the end of -PRON- island probation 
-PRON- be afternoon and i be just finish off a a to four the stern of the whaleboat preparatory to calk ing 
very quietly zelda announce a ship robert 
i turn quickly around 
the girl be look seaward shade -PRON- eye with -PRON- hand 
there be no trace in -PRON- of the joy a cast away would be expect to feel in the circum stance 
-PRON- have say a ship robert just as -PRON- may have remark here come aunt sarah to call -PRON- to supper 
the ship be a foreandafter and be stand e in quite close schooner say -PRON- arenot in much of a transport zelda -PRON- glad be go to be take off suppose i be -PRON- answer dubiously with a regretful look at -PRON- unfinished work but i wish the rescue could have be delay until -PRON- have get the whaleboat into the water 
throw down the stone hammer i step to -PRON- side 
-PRON- have be happy here i ask in spite of the fact that -PRON- be maroon and that -PRON- have lose the treasure 
happy yes -PRON- murmur happy than i ever think i could be 
a arter to four have be happy too i say take -PRON- hand 
even a barren rock in the pacific be come a paradise when there be work to be do and love to robert -PRON- cry out show some excite ment at last 
that ship be the lady may i have not be watch the schooner but try e to catch the hazel eye which be evade mine and gaze seaward word star tle -PRON- and i turn and stare across the sunlit zelda be right 
the schooner be none other than -PRON- old friend the lady may 
the main question be this why be -PRON- re turn 
do the fact bode well or ill for the three on the island 
a new master 
zelda and i hasten to carry the news to mrs brackett 
there be not the least doubt as to that good ladys feeling for -PRON- be fairly be side -PRON- with joy 
with zelda and -PRON- i believe mrs brackett have achieve a certain amount of contentment there on the island 
but the root of -PRON- con tentment have not strike so deep that -PRON- feel constrain to regret the end of -PRON- probation 
together -PRON- proceed to the westernmost ele vation 
the schoon bear down on the island smartly from the northeast would cer tainly hunt for -PRON- old anchorage in the cove 
for two hour -PRON- watch -PRON- 
come around the end of the island -PRON- beat in through the leeward passage and splash -PRON- anchor into the lagoon 
lie directly under -PRON- what i see on -PRON- deck surprise -PRON- 
the skipper with the fiery hair be not in evi dence 
neither be vandeleur 
a arter to stubb be on the poop and -PRON- raucous voice roll up to -PRON- as -PRON- give -PRON- peremptory order 
i observe that -PRON- be armed with a rifle 
anderson also armed be forward among the crew 
larsen a revolver thrust through -PRON- belt stand aft alongside of stubb 
the hand forward move nimbly enough yet -PRON- be clear that armed authority alone hold -PRON- respect 
stubb look up at -PRON- and motion toward the beach 
when -PRON- gain the sand anderson be on -PRON- way to -PRON- in the dory 
the boat ground and -PRON- step ashore with a grim smile 
all well mr lorry -PRON- ask 
all well anderson i reply hap pen aboard the schooner prefer to let captain stubb tell -PRON- that sir 
-PRON- be to go aboard in the dory and i be to help the lady get -PRON- trap down to the beach 
i look at zelda questioningly 
-PRON- will help mr anderson robert say -PRON- 
besides -PRON- shall want to go over by the spring before -PRON- go aboard 
a arter to four -PRON- and mrs brackett want to pay a last visit to the grave and -PRON- want to be alone 
-PRON- can go there tomorrow zelda i ad vise 
beg -PRON- pardon sir put in anderson but captain stubb want to get away tonight 
-PRON- will understand why when -PRON- get on board the reason too -PRON- send -PRON- ashore in stead of come -PRON-

sarve -PRON- bloody right if put -PRON- ashore an leave -PRON- growl stubb would too if i didnot need -PRON- ter work ship 
leave larsen to guard the hatch stubb and i go below 
petie be look after the captain face be haggard -PRON- red hair strag gle about -PRON- brow and through the tangle the unshielded cavity of -PRON- defunct eye show hor ribly 
under the hair and hide the depression in the temple be a white bandage 
the skip per eye be closed and -PRON- seem asleep 
-PRON- manacle hand lie across -PRON- breast 
-PRON- foot be not secure 
a a to four have ankleiron on -PRON- fer a spell say stubb an keep -PRON- lash ter the bunk be side 
that be when -PRON- be vilent easy now 
petie stay right with -PRON- be all the time 
be there any one on board that know any thing about surgery or medicine 
i ask 
anderson do 
-PRON- examine the skipper arter -PRON- quiet down sost -PRON- could sheer along side without a fracas 
but -PRON- too much of a problem fer anderson 
anderson think the only thing -PRON- kin do be ter leave the skipper like -PRON- be till -PRON- git back -PRON- move on to the stateroom unlock the door and call to vandeleur 
-PRON- come out crawl over the box that fill the space be tween the low bunk and the bulkhead 
-PRON- be an exceedingly dishearten youth if appear ance count for anything the use of keep -PRON- lock up -PRON- whimper 
this isnot -PRON- do mr lorry 
golden be to blame admit i tell -PRON- moren i ought to but after that -PRON- take every thing in -PRON- own hand donot -PRON- know 
i a a ter to four havenot do right but willing to let bygone be bygone if -PRON- be 
-PRON- thrust out -PRON- hand toward -PRON- 
i turn away in disgust 
-PRON- wonot be necessary to keep -PRON- lock up there any longer mr stubb say -PRON- power for evil be go and there be man enough aboard now to look after the four in the and vandeleur too if -PRON- need -PRON- 
j as -PRON- say mr lorry return stubb but i never do hev any use fer that towheade lubber 
two hour later the schooner be hail from the shore and i row over in the dory and bring back zelda mrs brackett anderson and the little heap of good -PRON- have carry to the beach 
mrs brackett be cry softly and eye be red 
about nine oclock that evening -PRON- catch the wind in -PRON- topsail and work through the leeward channel into the open sea then -PRON- put about give the island a wide berth and lay course for home 
the only event worthy of record during that a arter to four homeward voyage happen on the first night out 
some blame be afterward attach to stubb and indirectly to the rest of -PRON- because of -PRON- yet stubb be asleep in -PRON- berth at the time and the rest of -PRON- on deck or below be as powerless to prevent the tragedy as though -PRON- have be a thousand mile away 
mrs brackett and zelda be in -PRON- state room 
i be stand the first watch with an derson help to keep an eye on allison and the kanaka who have be bring up from the fore castle for duty 
stubb as have be state be get a little need rest in the stateroom occu pie by vandeleur 
the kanaka have the wheel 
suddenly an earsplitte yell echo from be low deck aft 
an instant later i see a form bind through the companion jump to the rail and go over the side head first 
-PRON- all happen so quickly that no one could get close enough to interfere before the splash alongside tell that the man have strike the water 
man overboard come the yell 
anderson shoot -PRON- order rapidly at the ka naka and i leap to help allison with the sail 
the schooner come around and when i go aft a a to four i find that larsen have come up and be help e anderson clear away the dory 
-PRON- be captain golden say anderson 
larsen say -PRON- jump out of -PRON- bunk bowl petie over with a doublehanded blow of the steel cuff and rush for the deck 
larsen and i man the dory while anderson climb the main rig to watch and direct -PRON- 
frisco again 
-PRON- effort be useless 
manacle as the skipper be -PRON- must have go down like a piece of lead 
larsen and i cruise about for two hour and be then call back to the schooner by stubb 
no use wastin any more time say stubb the skipper get -PRON- whatfor though ruther -PRON- have come in any other way git -PRON- an anderson ter sign the log as witness mr lor ry when i write -PRON- up in the mornin 
the schooner be once more put on -PRON- course and -PRON- bear away leave the illfated skipper somewhere in the broad reach of water behind 
-PRON- be a depressing event 
captain golden have be no friend of mine and -PRON- have try at least twice to take -PRON- life yet the suddenness with which -PRON- have meet -PRON- end inspire a gruesome feeling which i do not get over for day 
zelda receive the news of the skipper death a a to four calmly and without comment 
mrs humanity bring from -PRON- a few word of re gret but nothing could mar the good woman complacency over the prospect of an early arrival home with a quarterly share of the treasure 
the effect of the tragedy on the four mutinous man forward be most marked 
-PRON- sullen ness vanish by degree 
-PRON- have come to realize that there be nothing in the ten box for -PRON- and i soothe -PRON- regret by an offer of double pay all around 
a few day after captain death i call a conference in the cabin a second confer ence of the four 
one of the teakwood box have be open by the skipper and vandeleur and a little mound of -PRON- content be heap on the cabin table 
the mound consist of metallic fragment roughly hack from some parent mass and show ax and pickmark 
there be little in a casual survey of the fragment to suggest value 
every piece be stain and discolor and in some of -PRON- be embed particle of broken stone 
a a to four be that all -PRON- get for -PRON- trouble mutter mrs brackett survey the heap dejectedly 
i take up one of the fragment and cut into -PRON- with a knife 
-PRON- cut easily and the passing of the knifeblade leave a glitter surface streak with yellow and gray 
unless i be greatly mistaken mrs brack ett i remark each of these fragment con sist of silver and gold in a marvelously pure state 
by some mean perhaps by the action of volcanic fire the metal have be melt and run together 
there be ten box of this rich con glomerate remember and each box weigh a hundred and fifty pound 
in other word -PRON- have some fifteen hundred pound of gold and silver in nearly a pure state 
as a mere guess i should say that each box contain treasure to the amount of thirty thousand dollar gasp mrs brackett simply a guess 
-PRON- donot know the proportion of silver to gold nor how much must be take from the weight for foreign matter -PRON- bed in the molten metal 
but i be of opin ion that the figure state be most conservative 
a a to four mrs brackett struggle for a while to com prehend the enormity of -PRON- good luck 
vande leur sit at one side of the table keep -PRON- head down and -PRON- eye avert 
zelda sit at -PRON- right be calmness -PRON- 
mr lorry where do -PRON- all come from i win der 
mrs brackett -PRON- mind flounder help lessly in a mire of undreamedof rich reach after -PRON- origin as a measure of relief 
that be something aunt sarah say zelda that -PRON- shall probably never know 
well anyway -PRON- have get a good right to the treasure bristle mrs brackett as though by -PRON- vehemence to quiet the still small voice of conscience 
when i think of -PRON- poor boy lyin back there on that rocky island i donot feel that there be enough money in this world to make up -PRON- loss to -PRON- get a right to -PRON- i know -PRON- have 
certainly -PRON- have affirm zelda 
-PRON- should not have be send for the treasure if -PRON- hadnot a right to -PRON- 
by jove chime in the thin voice of vande leur ours no matter where -PRON- come from have an idea i theorize that the treasure a a to be find somewhere on the island 
the very name of the island no doubt give to -PRON- by -PRON- relative would seem to point to that fact 
then again fortune island be of volcanic origin 
somewhere about -PRON- this molten metal may have be find 
i be not enough of a metallurgist to know whether a mine of silver and gold could exist in such a condition as -PRON- see these frag ment yet that be the only explanation i can offer 
in the absence of anything more definite rob ert say zelda -PRON- be the explanation -PRON- shall accept 
i be make custodian of the box by mrs brackett and zelda even vandeleur assent to the arrangement 
upon reach san fran cisco i be to turn the treasure into money and parcel -PRON- out in quarterly share 
a day or two later i have a talk with vande leur force -PRON- to a full and complete confes sion of -PRON- doubledealing 
-PRON- have hire the two beachcomber to lay for -PRON- the night i go to logy just as i have suppose 
when -PRON- report -PRON- failure to -PRON- on the same night the attack be make -PRON- like a a ter to four wise bring the news that i have go to logy bill to secure -PRON- help in put -PRON- on the track of a reliable skipper 
vandeleur know of captain golden through captain trent 
arm with the information bring by the hire footpad vandeleur call on captain golden tell -PRON- some of the fact in the case and suggest that -PRON- approach logy bill in a cautious way and see if bill would not refer -PRON- to -PRON- 
that be exactly what happen 
all -PRON- subse quent trouble be due to logy failure to make sure of -PRON- man 
as soon as -PRON- become certain that captain gold en be to take -PRON- expedition seaward -PRON- and vandeleur begin to plan 
-PRON- finally decide that -PRON- would be good to wait until -PRON- destina tion be know then put -PRON- out of the way as a troublesome menace to the success of -PRON- scheme 
after the failure of the attempt to get -PRON- over board in the southeaster the ludicrous rivalry between the skipper and vandeleur for favor cause a coolness between the conspirator and i be let alone 
captain golden overheard a a to four zelda tell -PRON- that -PRON- object in make -PRON- self agreeable to the skipper and vandeleur be solely to insure -PRON- safety and the rival imme diately become reconcile and agree to continue -PRON- nefarious work 
the blow i have give the skipper on the beach of the lagoon inspire -PRON- to go ashore with vandeleur for the purpose of seek vengeance 
-PRON- discovery at the eastern end of the island follow and -PRON- believe -PRON- have do -PRON- bad when the rope be toss from the cliff 
return to the schooner golden order away the three boat and go to the cavern 
if i have be there vandeleur assure -PRON- i would never have leave the cavern alive 
golden and vandeleur positive that the cav ern have something to do with -PRON- secret mission to the island search -PRON- carefully and of course find the ten box 
when -PRON- weigh anchor and leave the island captain golden intend to make port somewhere in south america dispose of the schooner turn the treasure into negotiable fund divide with vandeleur and then -PRON- and vandeleur would lose -PRON- in distant part to enjoy -PRON- illgotten gain 
a a ter to four in make -PRON- confession vandeleur be very careful to shield -PRON- at the expense of the dead skipper 
vandeleur to take -PRON- word for -PRON- be always the one who be lead always the one who deprecate violent measure 
yet i know the part -PRON- have play as well as though -PRON- have tell -PRON- and -PRON- desire to shirk responsibili tie serve merely to increase -PRON- contempt for -PRON- 
-PRON- be more than a month get back to san francisco 
as soon as -PRON- have effect a landing a cab be call and mrs brackett and zelda proceed at once to -PRON- old lodging in kearney street 
i remain overnight in the schooner with stubb and on the follow morning hire a dray and accompany the ten case personally to the morgan smelting and refining company 
here the bullion be weigh and a receipt give -PRON- in the name of brackett anstruther vande leur and lorry 
two day afterward i call for -PRON- statement and check 
there be a ripple of excitement in the office of the smelting company when i pre a arter to four sente -PRON- and i be request to step into mr office for a private interview 
a spasm of doubt seize -PRON- and i begin to have vague fear for the outcome 
mr morgan be a stout man with sharp commercial eye 
-PRON- appearance i believe be respectable enough but i be very sure that i do not look like the honest custodian of the treasure deposit two day before 
mr morgan have a memoran dum of the bullion and a certify check before -PRON- 
-PRON- will pardon -PRON- for make some in quirie i trust say -PRON- but the large amount of gold and silver which -PRON- leave with -PRON- and the peculiar condition in which -PRON- find -PRON- impel -PRON- to ask -PRON- a few question mr lorry shall be glad to give -PRON- any information -PRON- may desire i answer 
could -PRON- send for the other party who be interested with -PRON- in this matter 
certainly if -PRON- wish -PRON- 
a boy be send out to secure a cab and pro ceed to the house in kearney street with a note for zelda 
in half an hour the cab have return a a ter to and mrs brackett zelda and vandeleur be with -PRON- in mr office 
during -PRON- wait for -PRON- three companion i have ample time to observe the suspicion with which mr morgan regard -PRON- and when zelda and mrs brackett enter i see the suspicion slowly leave -PRON- face 
have -PRON- any objection to tell -PRON- where this large amount of gold and silver come from inquire mr morgan 
i nod to zelda 
will -PRON- satisfy -PRON- curiosity miss an struther 
i ask 
tell -PRON- everything 
i have an idea that mr morgan look upon -PRON- as freebooter and for one should like to have -PRON- entirely satisfied 
zelda launch into the story forthwith be gin with the quartered card of instruction mention -PRON- interview with mr price and follow the narrative through to -PRON- landing in san francisco 
of course -PRON- mention only those matter that have to do with the treasure leave out all incidental matter 
mr morgan excuse -PRON- go into an other room and -PRON- could hear -PRON- call up mr 
a a ter to four price 
presently mr morgan return smile and perfectly satisfied 
-PRON- narrative miss anstruther say -PRON- resume -PRON- chair sound like a tale from the thousand and one night 
i wish to congratu late all of -PRON- and here -PRON- sweep the four of -PRON- with a comprehensive glance on -PRON- cour age in follow a very strange affair through to a successful and highly profitable conclusion find -PRON- continue consult the memo randum before -PRON- that mr lorry deposit with -PRON- for -PRON- joint account ounce of precious metal 
of this amount ounce be gold and ounce silver both of an exceed ingly high degree of fineness 
the gold amount to and the silver to make a total of for which i now hand mr lorry -PRON- certify check 
allow -PRON- to congratulate -PRON- again on -PRON- good fortune and to bid -PRON- a good morning 
-PRON- require zelda on one side and -PRON- on the other to support mrs brackett back to the wait cab 
-PRON- will have more than seventy thousand dollar for -PRON- share aunt sarah zelda have a a ter to four whisper and mrs brackett be continually mumble the amount over to -PRON- 
from the office of the smelting company -PRON- drive to the bank on which the certify check be draw 
there -PRON- write -PRON- name on the back of the check exchange -PRON- for four draft each for the sum of seventytwo thousand two hundred and five dollar and thirty cent 
-PRON- have still to reimburse mr lorry say zelda if each of -PRON- give -PRON- twelve hundred dollar sy send -PRON- -PRON- check say vandeleur airily 
this happen more than a year ago and van deleur check be still on the way 
dight break 
settlement for the use of the schooner be make with job golden a shipchandler and a brother of captain nathan 
no complaint be lodge against the hand 
-PRON- receive -PRON- wage from job golden together with a similar amount from -PRON- for i have promise -PRON- double pay shortly after leave fortune island 
with the consent of mrs brackett and zelda a bonus of one thousand dollar be give the mate and five hundred dollar each be give anderson and larsen as a gratuity 
have these three not serve -PRON- so well the entire treasure would probably have escape -PRON- 
the extra money come at a particularly oppor tune time for mr stubb inasmuch as job gold en be harass -PRON- with threat on the score of the dead skipper 
i suggest to mr stubb that -PRON- spend a little of -PRON- bonus for a lawyer service and send -PRON- to mr price 
mr price send the shipchandler a call to come a a ter to to -PRON- office 
when mr golden come -PRON- face a counterthreat for damage if -PRON- persist in malign mr stubb 
thereupon mr golden drop the matter 
mrs brackett do not remain long in san francisco after obtain -PRON- share of the trea ure 
at -PRON- urgent request zelda accompany -PRON- to emmetsburg for a visit of several week 
before zelda and mrs brackett leave i ask zelda the most momentous question of -PRON- life preface -PRON- with a brief account of -PRON- career as a soldier of fortune 
during -PRON- clash with van deleur in the cabin of the lady may at the time the envelope be open -PRON- have make a slur ring attack upon -PRON- character 
i want zelda to know everything before -PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- an -PRON- smile as i offer -PRON- reason for go into the recital of -PRON- past 
that be entirely unnecessary robert say -PRON- 
when two person have be together so long and have face so many danger side by side as -PRON- have -PRON- come to know each other pretty well i think 
-PRON- answer dear 
i ask eagerly 
a a ter to four thought i give -PRON- to -PRON- week ago when -PRON- take that walk up the valley from the cliff to the cabin 
so -PRON- have but loverlike i feel that the sweet est story ever tell could not be tell too often even if -PRON- depth and intensity prove the despair of word 
so -PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- answer again and while i be seal the compact with a kiss mrs brack ett come into the hotel parlorand stand aghast 
rosy and brighteyed zelda fly to -PRON- put -PRON- arm about -PRON- neck and tell -PRON- the secret -PRON- secret 
and poor mrs brackett avow that -PRON- have never dream of such a thing 
nothing would do then but that i should come to emmetsburg in the course of a month so that zelda and i may honor -PRON- home with -PRON- nup tial 
-PRON- will be clear of that mortgage by then -PRON- dear asserted mrs brackett and if there be anything in omen -PRON- and mr lorry will be bless with a good one 
san francisco seem dreary indeed after zel da have leave but i try to keep busy 
after nearly nine year of profitless roam i at last have a a to four money to invest and with mr help i be able to invest -PRON- safely and well 
i see nothing of vandeleur but i hear that -PRON- be to use a slang term fly high and burn the candle at both end in the attempt to get rid of -PRON- money 
after three week of san francisco i begin make preparation to leave for emmetsburg 
and then on the very morning of the day i have plan to start a hasty summon reach -PRON- from mr price 
i be to call at -PRON- office imme diately 
wonder what could be in the wind i hur rie to answer -PRON- request 
mr lorry say -PRON- after -PRON- be both com fortably seat in -PRON- private office be now at liberty to tell -PRON- more regard -PRON- recent highly successful expedition to fortune island 
at liberty 
i repeat bewilder 
exactly that 
i be bind by a promise up till this very morning 
not that i know anything worth while -PRON- put in hastily or anything which if tell would have help -PRON- materially in -PRON- work 
what i have to say be merely by way of explanation 
a a to ur several month ago i be send for by a pa tient in st hospital 
i find this pa tient to be a man who have be badly hurt and be slowly die from the effect of -PRON- injury 
-PRON- may live a week the doctor say or -PRON- may drag out a miserable existence for a year but -PRON- end be sure to come 
this man give -PRON- four seal unaddressed envelope together with eleven hundred dollar in cash 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that one hundred and fifty dollar of the money be to be -PRON- fee for do certain thing which -PRON- would stipulate 
the four envelope be to be give or for ward to four different people who live in various part of the country 
the address of two of those people be know and the ad dress of the other two be to be find 
the name the man give -PRON- be yours mrs miss and mr vande leur 
where mrs brackett and miss an struther be to be find -PRON- know 
-PRON- also know that vandeleur live somewhere in san francisco but of -PRON- whereabout -PRON- be en tirely ignorant 
vandeleur be easily discover and a letter a a ter to -PRON- to -PRON- uncle rufu in great barrington massachusett develop the fact that -PRON- be in chicago 
there be certain question to be answer by all of -PRON- in order that identity may be prove beyond all peradventure 
the man in the hospital have these question write out on separate sheet of paper together with the correct answer 
-PRON- impress -PRON- with the fact that fortune be wait somewhere in the pacific for the four whose name -PRON- have give -PRON- and that to find the whereabout of the fortune the content of all the envelope would be need 
-PRON- task be to see that the envelope reach the proper party 
-PRON- client suggest that i work through lawyer in various part of the country and i be to forward with each en velope the sum of two hundred and fifty dollar in cash 
out of this amount the several lawyer be to keep fee of fifty dollar each the re mainder be turn over to the person the law yer be to communicate with 
the fact that -PRON- client be in san francisco be to be keep a secret as well as be everything else except the detail that have to do with the a a to come together of the four and the beginning of -PRON- enterprise 
-PRON- client -PRON- be who offer the suggestion that the four make -PRON- know to each other by the mystical formula that concern the time of day 
this say -PRON- client will not only prick -PRON- curiosity when a bare statement of what -PRON- be to do may fail but -PRON- will also give -PRON- a fitting idea of the caution necessary to the success of -PRON- undertaking 
personally i think that -PRON- client be logical and entirely human nature be a queer thing mr lorry 
this client of mine be a good judge of human na ture and -PRON- have work out every detail of -PRON- plan while lie on -PRON- back in the hospital ward 
but this client of yours mr price i break in if -PRON- know of this treasure why do -PRON- allow -PRON- to go out of -PRON- hand 
as i have already say -PRON- have be bedridden for month and slowly die 
fate deny -PRON- an active part in seek the treasure and what good could the treasure do -PRON- when -PRON- doom be seal and merely a matter of week or month 
besides -PRON- assure -PRON- that -PRON- be a a ter to bind by a solemn promise a promise give to the dying 
what -PRON- hope to accomplish be the recovery of the treasure by those entitle to -PRON- and to so plan that not one of the four if so dis pose could take unfair advantage of the other 
mr price get up from -PRON- chair 
-PRON- now understand the preliminary detail mr lorry say -PRON- and if -PRON- will accompany -PRON- to the hospital -PRON- will learn whatever else be necessary to make the whole matter clear 
i be now at the end of the mystery and i have discover that the end of -PRON- do not lie in faraway fortune island but right there in san francisco 
mr price have a carriage wait at the curb 
-PRON- enter -PRON- and be soon at st hospital 
an attendant who have seemingly be ap prise of -PRON- intend visit meet -PRON- in the office lead -PRON- to an elevator and to a private ward on the third floor 
-PRON- tap on the door and a whitecappe nurse answer the summon 
mr lorry i hear the attendant whisper to the nurse 
in a moment the latter answer and go back into the room 
a a ter to four presently the nurse return 
-PRON- wish to see mr lorry alone say -PRON- 
just go right in sir -PRON- add to -PRON- 
thrill with all this mystery supposedly sur round the clearing of the great puzzle 
i pass into the white highwalled room 
the door close behind -PRON- 
on a white iron bed in the center of the room lie a man whose thin face be like chalk and whose black burn eye seem abnormally large 
a slight smile cross the cadaverous face and give a ghastly twist to the bloodless lip 
a clawlike hand be lift and hold toward -PRON- 
bob exclaim a weak voice 
i stare step forward and grasp the cold hand and stare again 
arthur 
i exclaim 
arthur mayhew 
a lift veil didnot think -PRON- would know -PRON- old chap say a bit changed since -PRON- see -PRON- last 
draw up a chair by the bed 
-PRON- voice isnot any too strong and get a lot to say 
vividly impress by the difference between the roister harumscarum lad i have know year ago and the wreck that now lie before -PRON- i pull a chair close and sit down 
for a few moment arthur lay quiet staring at -PRON- intently 
-PRON- mother and mine be sister bob -PRON- murmur and if -PRON- have not die so soon per hap -PRON- and i would have be different 
who know 
i never be so bad as -PRON- uncle rufu choose to think -PRON- -PRON- add with another of -PRON- ghastly smile so when i couple -PRON- lot in life with -PRON- own -PRON- be not in an evil way 
soldier of fortune 
-PRON- smile become a husky laugh be die early donot -PRON- think 
perhaps -PRON- isnot so bad as all that be halfdead alreadyfrom -PRON- waist down 
a arter to four in a few day the doctor say -PRON- heart will be involve 
unknown 
i shall pass into the undiscovered country with a well con science now that i know a solemn promise have be fulfil and that i have be the mean of bring wealth to four who deserve and be en title to -PRON- 
-PRON- pause 
hand -PRON- a glass of water bob -PRON- say abruptly 
-PRON- throat be as dry as a bone 
i give -PRON- the water and -PRON- rest for a min ute 
-PRON- do the business all right -PRON- smile 
price tell -PRON- 
how much do -PRON- weigh out 
i tell -PRON- 
good -PRON- exclaim be able to bring a little with -PRON- when i leave the islandenough to see -PRON- through this hospital experience and to hand around something for lawyer fee and to give -PRON- four a limited amount for travel ex pense 
and i say bob 
what be -PRON- arthur 
-PRON- flame eye dance with a suggestion of -PRON- merry boyish twinkle 
what time be -PRON- -PRON- ask 
a a to four i look around for a clock and again -PRON- laugh huskily think -PRON- would tell -PRON- a quarter to four -PRON- go on 
have -PRON- so soon forget ten or didnot -PRON- make the impression on -PRON- i think -PRON- would 
certainly -PRON- impress -PRON- strongly enough 
but why didnot -PRON- have -PRON- come right here and tell -PRON- the whole business 
that would have be the sensible way to get at the thing ar thur 
-PRON- donot understand bob -PRON- answer ear nestly be bind by a promise 
i could not even seem to give -PRON- an advantage over the other four 
but -PRON- know i be hone tush boy 
of course i know -PRON- be honest 
to tell the truth i didnot want to talk with -PRON- before -PRON- cross the water for that treasure 
i be afraid -PRON- would find out too much about -PRON- -PRON- have such a keen way with -PRON- and would not go after -PRON- 
i start as though sting the treasure honestly come by 
i de mande 
a a to four -PRON- three dead comrade be lie in fortune island say -PRON- give -PRON- a steady look 
be fore i close -PRON- eye i promise each one of -PRON- that the person -PRON- name should have a rightful share in the treasure 
when man die -PRON- try to go with clear conscience even as i be try 
be -PRON- likely bob that -PRON- and i would want -PRON- to go after treasure that be not honestly come by 
the point hinge on -PRON- personal interpreta tion of right and wrong 
i know that i be right and -PRON- must acknowledge that -PRON- feel in the same way before -PRON- leave this room or i shall die plague with the thought that i have be a curse instead of a benefit to -PRON- 
go on arthur i urge strangely thrilled think -PRON- get that silver and gold from somewhere about the island 
-PRON- didnot -PRON- burst out vehemently 
-PRON- come from the mint at tientsin 
from the mint at tientsin 
i gasp 
by fortune of war arthur resume still ve hemently 
be -PRON- a soldier of fortune that -PRON- should balk at what come to -PRON- by fortune of war

well -PRON- fill -PRON- 
-PRON- have to work like turk to do -PRON- but -PRON- finish the job and do -PRON- well 
then -PRON- make that deal with gene trent 
-PRON- have a brigantine off port arthur and -PRON- agree to get the stuff away for an even share 
-PRON- be take a big risk for -PRON- didnot know a thing about trent and what report -PRON- get of -PRON- werenot any too favorable 
but -PRON- be trent or no one and so -PRON- chance -PRON- 
-PRON- be to get the stuff down the river in a sampan transfer -PRON- to a junk and get -PRON- aboard the gazelle at port arthur 
then the gazelle a a to four be to sail for nagasaki and wait there until -PRON- three join himand -PRON- be to wait a year if -PRON- have to 
-PRON- time have nearly expire and so have an struther 
tommy have a couple of year before -PRON- and -PRON- be wonder how -PRON- could slip -PRON- hawse without do anything underhand or unsoldierlike 
-PRON- three forget about trent and the box in the hot time -PRON- have during the march to pekin 
archie and i be there when -PRON- get -PRON- discharge 
tommy be there too flat on -PRON- back in a heathen temple that have be con verte into a hospital 
-PRON- have a bullet in -PRON- somewhere and have be mention for bravery 
when archie and i have draw -PRON- travel pay and get -PRON- paper -PRON- take a wagontrain and go down to tientsin with a squad of dis charge man 
the last thing tommy say to -PRON- when -PRON- leave be forget to hang around old nagasaki till i catch up with -PRON- 
well archie and i get across to nagasaki on a transport bet with each other all the way as to whether trent be there or have slant away with -PRON- plunder 
-PRON- be a couple of a a to four surprised and delighted traveler i can tell -PRON- when -PRON- see the brigantine in the bay and read off the name across -PRON- stern 
captain trent have have a time of -PRON- too for -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have to put up a singlehanded fight with the sampanman in order to get the stuff to the junk and while -PRON- be in the junk -PRON- have to sleep on the box with -PRON- gun handy in order to keep the piratical crew from throw -PRON- overboard and appropriate the treasure 
-PRON- idle away two month at nagasaki wait e for tommy to come 
-PRON- have about make up -PRON- mind that -PRON- wound have get the good of -PRON- and that -PRON- have be plant somewhere in side the walled city when lo and behold along -PRON- comesa little peaked and pale but spry as a cricket desert do -PRON- tommy 
anstruther ask 
desert say tommy with fine scorn not -PRON- for all the gold in i tell -PRON- there s a power of -PRON- 
invalid home that s mhat i be 
now let sail in a hurry to get back to emmetsburg lift the mortgage on the old homestead like the hero in the play and then a a to four be a dutiful son to one o the good mother that ever live arthur have rush on with -PRON- account -PRON- word fairly trip over -PRON- 
-PRON- pause suddenly ask for another drink and stare hard at -PRON- over the top of the glass 
what do -PRON- think of -PRON- bob -PRON- ask hand the glass back donot know what to think arthur say i gloomily look for a surprise but not for anything like this havenot a hairtrigger conscience as -PRON- call -PRON- arthur proceed but i donot think any one can complain that i never try to do what s right give month of study to this thing study -PRON- from the point of right and wrong between man and between man and -PRON- maker and i decide long ago that the treasure be rightfully ours 
if -PRON- hadnot take -PRON- some one else would 
and where s the wrong of take a thing that s bind to be take anyway and from a people that didnot deserve to have -PRON- in the first place 
i remain silent 
well say arthur go on 
the gazelle a a to four sail for san francisco 
for week everything go well and then one night -PRON- try to sail across a reef and into an island that wasnot on the chart 
-PRON- be blow hard at the time and the brigantine go headon with a smash that break -PRON- down clear to the foremast 
the sailor in the be drown like rat in a trap and those on deck be wash overboard 
trent brackett anstruther and i be be low in the after cabin and -PRON- crawl up on deck as quick as -PRON- could and try to get a whaleboat into the water 
a wave stove -PRON- in against the side of the wreck and every one of -PRON- get hurt what s do the trick for -PRON- now bob 
i be hurt internally somehow and the trouble never take form until after i be pick off the island by a tramp sealer and have start for home 
-PRON- be a quartet of cripple after that and -PRON- be the hard kind of work get to land 
i be throw into the water and get ashore by swim trent and the other two follow in the dory 
-PRON- ere on the island two monthsthat be i a a to four be for -PRON- comrade begin to drop off the sec ond week after -PRON- land 
the first week though -PRON- all manage to do a fair amount of work 
anstruther have a broken arm wound have open up again so those two buckle in on shore while trent and i ferry back and orth between the beach and the wreck 
-PRON- bring away canned stuff and other pro vision and brackett and anstruther pick up wreckage on the beach and carry -PRON- to the val ley where -PRON- build -PRON- cabin 
-PRON- take the gal ley stove and the table from the cabin and but -PRON- have see the layout i guess so -PRON- will have a pretty fair idea of what four crippled man ac complished 
-PRON- hard job be get out those ten box 
man man but trent and i sweat blood when -PRON- do that 
trent have change the stuff from the ammunitioncase to the teakwood box at nagasaki 
somehow trent couldnot bear the look of those united state army am munitioncase 
-PRON- have find that cave while snoop around the island in the dory and trent think -PRON- would be safe to dump the box on the beach a a to four inside the cave then if any boat happen along and pick -PRON- up there wouldnot be any disagree able question ask 
if the rescuer look like a pretty decent white man -PRON- would trust -PRON- to help -PRON- get the box if -PRON- didnot -PRON- would leave the box where -PRON- be and come back after -PRON- 
so -PRON- labor like galleyslave get the treasure out of the wreck and into the dory and out of the dory and into the cave 
after that first week -PRON- all get together in the cabin -PRON- would build and the gloom have settle over -PRON- thick 
-PRON- hadnot a notion that any of -PRON- would ever live to get away but -PRON- each give information about -PRON- next of kin along with other needful detail and -PRON- be write down and solemn promise be make to do the right thing 
brackett poor chap be the first be alive today but for that bullet the boxer throw into -PRON- 
-PRON- hardship at the time the brigan tine be wreck open up the wound and -PRON- couldnot do anything 
-PRON- flicker out during the night and -PRON- find -PRON- cold and stiff next morning with -PRON- mother picture grip in -PRON- finger 
-PRON- bury -PRON- picture and all alongside the a a to four grave of some of the sailor -PRON- would pick up on the sand 
then i begin get out headboard and put in -PRON- spare time carve -PRON- 
gruesome work 
-PRON- be bad than that bob 
here -PRON- would be soldierin in the philip pine and china count the hour until -PRON- be to get back to country only to wind up on that miserable rock in the pacific and begin end e -PRON- day 
anstruther follow brackett 
nostalgiai think the doctor call itgot in -PRON- work and help -PRON- injury along 
-PRON- die during the third week 
trent be tough and -PRON- hang on longer than i have suppose be possible for any human be e hurt as -PRON- be 
-PRON- leave -PRON- in the sixth week and there i be all alone on the island manufacturing headboard 
trent before -PRON- die have take the island bearing and i have -PRON- down on a piece of paper along with the other information the rest of the lad have give -PRON- 
also i have some of the treasure in a dunnagebag i have take -PRON- out as a sort of sample and the survivor be to have a arter to four -PRON- for expense in start an expedition back to the island for the teakwood box 
-PRON- be a godsend for -PRON- that that tramp sealer put in at the island two week after trent die 
if -PRON- hadnot surely have go mad with the loneliness 
the captain of the sealer wasnot the sort of man i want to trust with the ten box so i didnot say anything to -PRON- about -PRON- 
later though when this paralysis begin creep over -PRON- i wish i have 
i may have take a chance on -PRON- i think just as -PRON- have take one on captain trent 
when the sealer reach frisco -PRON- have to send for an ambulance to get -PRON- to the hospital 
i consider -PRON- lucky to get back to the united state alive 
but month have slip away since then and here i be yet at that moment the door open and the nurse come in 
-PRON- be talk too long mr may hew say -PRON- decisively 
but i want to hear what bob do and mr lorry will have to put that off until to morrow 
a arter to four cometomorrow tell -PRON- what -PRON- think 
arthur be very weak and -PRON- be difficult for -PRON- to speak 
study -PRON- over tonight bob -PRON- add and tell -PRON- what -PRON- thinkwhen -PRON- cometomorrow 
conclusion 
loot 
loot from the pillaged city of tien tsin 
how that think rang in -PRON- brain as i walk away from the hospital 
and again and again -PRON- conscience ask what shall i do 
what be -PRON- right to do 
i think of what that treasure mean to mrs brackett widow and childless of what -PRON- mean to zelda and what to -PRON- 
i turn the problem over in -PRON- mind a thousand time and i could come to no decision 
if i halfdecide that -PRON- be right to keep the treasure then arise and grin mockingly in -PRON- face if i halfdecide that -PRON- be not right to keep -PRON- then face haunt -PRON- and fancy fly across league of heave pacific to a lonely island with four stark headboard and beside one of the mound mrs brackett be kneel and over another bent zelda anstruther 
a a to four i go to the hospital undecided 
i go away awe impressed sorrowful 
arthur be dead 
i have see the screen pull around -PRON- cot and the nurse have lead -PRON- behind -PRON- and i have stand hat in hand look down on -PRON- cousin calm untrouble face 
-PRON- last word be for -PRON- mr lorry say the nurse 
what be -PRON- 
i ask 
-PRON- be do not understand -PRON- but i presume -PRON- will be clear to -PRON- tell -PRON- cousin bob to keep what -PRON- have and say noth ing if not for -PRON- own sake then for the sake of the other 
-PRON- know what -PRON- mean mr lorry 
yes i answer huskily and turn away 
arthur have die fearless in the conviction that -PRON- be right for -PRON- to keep the treasure 
after i have lay arthur away i call upon mr price 
behind the closed door of -PRON- private room i repeat story as faithfully as memory would allow 
then i ask for -PRON- ad vice 
the lawyer light a cigar 
anstruther and -PRON- cousin arthur may a a ter to -PRON- hew say -PRON- as i think irrelevantly must have see some hard fighting in china suppose so say if there be any hard fighting and arthur could get in -PRON- there d be no hold -PRON- back 
but what have that to do with the question mr price 
-PRON- do not seem to hear -PRON- question 
and tom brackett -PRON- go on be badly wound and mention for bravery 
yes i answer grow more and more perplexed 
and -PRON- have an uncle kill in the uprising 
why yes but mr price wait a minute lorry -PRON- interrupt 
as near as i can figure -PRON- out china owe -PRON- and miss anstruther and mrs brackett something on account 
vandeleur -PRON- strike -PRON- be about the only one who s get something -PRON- s not en title tobut then -PRON- havenot any mean of know what captain trent do for or against the chinaman 
i can see by -PRON- face that -PRON- think this a specious argument lorry 
but i donot know 
-PRON- cousin last word to -PRON- seem to strike a tell note 
the lawyer puff at -PRON- cigar in silence for a a a to four few moment and then once more pick up the thread of -PRON- remark 
do -PRON- want to talk about this thing lorry and get mrs brackett so harrow up that shell return every stiver of -PRON- share to the boxer 
do -PRON- want some country skinflint to foreclose on that mortgage and turn the old lady out of house and home 
or on the other hand be -PRON- willing to tuck -PRON- sentiment in -PRON- pocket and let tom mother keep a roof over -PRON- head and live in peace and plenty all the rest of -PRON- day 
i be silent 
and miss anstruther continue mr price 
-PRON- have a young brother to look after hasnot -PRON- 
tell -PRON- what -PRON- know and i imagine archibald anstruther out there on that un charted island in the pacific would turn in -PRON- grave 
as for vandeleur how much talking do -PRON- think -PRON- would take to make -PRON- give up what -PRON- s get 
there be nothing i could say and i continue to sit quietly and wait for more light 
lean back in -PRON- chair mr price reflect deeply until -PRON- have smoke the cigar to -PRON- lip 
a arter to four then -PRON- toss aside the remain of -PRON- get up and stand before -PRON- appreciate -PRON- feeling in the matter mr lorry say -PRON- and -PRON- be infinitely to -PRON- credit 
i be sixty year old -PRON- boy and i con sider -PRON- a good american and i have try to be a just man always in spite of the fact that lawyer be popularly suppose sometimes to be pay for -PRON- principle 
-PRON- judgment be this the matter have pass from national to one of mere individual importance 
possession be nine point of the law and -PRON- have possession 
fol low the line of least resistance and peace go with -PRON- 
so i pocket -PRON- conscience and follow the line of least resistance but real substantial peace be never wholly mine until a few day ago 
a year pass and during all that time i have not breathe a word of story to any one except mr price and i have begin to feel that -PRON- be about time i make a confidante of mrs lorry 
so i tell -PRON- 
during that year -PRON- affair have prosper amazingly 
the oro group of mine in colo a a to four rado have develop into a second comstock lode 
by advice of mr price i have purchase half the stock of the oro company invest most of -PRON- own fund and the company have recently dispose of -PRON- hold ing to an english syndicate and -PRON- profit and be such as to make that entire fortune island treasure look very small indeed by com parison 
mrs lorry receive -PRON- account of the source of the island treasure with an equanimity that surprise -PRON- be glad that -PRON- tell -PRON- dear be all -PRON- say 
a week later -PRON- come to -PRON- and smilingly proffer a request for a check forewarn -PRON- at the same time that -PRON- be to be quite a large one and state that i be not to know the dis bursement of the fund 
how much be -PRON- for dear 
i ask whirl -PRON- chair around to -PRON- studytable open -PRON- checkbook and pick up a pen 
-PRON- lay a slip of paper on the table before -PRON- 
the amount pencil on the slip be 4io60 i drop the pen and fall back in -PRON- chair with a gasp 
a a to -PRON- -PRON- spare -PRON- dear 
zelda ask 
why of course butbut -PRON- put one arm about -PRON- neck and lay -PRON- soft cheek against mine 
then why donot -PRON- write -PRON- -PRON- ask 
i write -PRON- 
next day a thought come to -PRON- and i do a little figuring 
that island treasure have yield each of the four the sum of twice this amount give for a product the face of the check i have write for zelda 
what -PRON- do with the money i donot know but -PRON- conscience have be easy ever since 

cook be there anything crooked about the way get hold of that property sila inquire bremerton quietly 
not on -PRON- life and expression become exceedingly virtuous 
i get the property at a bargain of course intend to turn -PRON- over to a syndicate make handsomely if i can let go for half a million but in order to do that the bullion have get to come as -PRON- do a year ago when i take over the proposition 
-PRON- go down there lee and straighten thing out 
i wonot stand for anything offcolor deane 
confound -PRON- that s why i want -PRON- 
-PRON- can forget more in a minute about mining and milling than any expert know in a year make -PRON- worth -PRON- while old man 
-PRON- ought to get thing come -PRON- way inside of a month 
after that keep up the good showing for six month and unload 
what be i to get out of itexcept a chance to go to the hospital if lucky oh bosh 
when -PRON- grab hold the gang will have the first real man to deal with that send down there hunt -PRON- hole and -PRON- wonot have a mite of trouble 
i know -PRON- or i wouldnot give -PRON- this chance 
of course bremerton -PRON- ainot so darn old but i guess -PRON- sabe -PRON- get pretty near time -PRON- take a start 
eh 
sure 
now look here go to give -PRON- five hundred dollar a mdnth and allow -PRON- six month to make that -PRON- a winner 
how do that hit -PRON- that will amount to three thousand dollar observe bremerton provide i last for six month last all right 
thunder 
if -PRON- have get any white feather conceal on -PRON- person then -PRON- all happen in the last five year 
time be when -PRON- call -PRON- lee reckless and neither hell nor highwater throw a crimp into -PRON- 
bremerton stir uneasily 
reckless -PRON- have be call but not justly 
occasionally -PRON- have make the most of a desperate situation but not without carenever recklessly 
if -PRON- want a reckless man deane -PRON- say -PRON- donot want -PRON- 
come now insist the other i guess i know who i want 
this be a man job and -PRON- be the man for -PRON- never far wide of -PRON- trail when i size up a bunch of circumstance and pick a chap to handle -PRON- 
but if -PRON- donot want this chanceif -PRON- be not in need of money -PRON- know in need of money be the sharp response and -PRON- know only wait to grab at something in the way of a chance 
and that bremerton add a trifle grimly be why afraid of i hope for old friendship sake -PRON- be not try to take advantage of -PRON- necessity 
when -PRON- twang the sentimental string old partner -PRON- sure get -PRON- go crowd a stranger to the -PRON- lookout whether or not -PRON- eyeteeth be cutbut the need of an old friend will always hit -PRON- close to the heart 
lee wonot -PRON- see canot -PRON- see that try to do something for -PRON- why -PRON- and -PRON- drink out of the same coffeecan year ago and once when i be nigh petere in the desert -PRON- wring the last drop from the canteen and give -PRON- to -PRON- 
say do -PRON- imagine that all the money in the world could make -PRON- forget a few of those thing 
dash -PRON- not so walled in with dollar that i canot break through to help a chap i think more of than i would of a bloodbrother 
bremerton listen thoughtfully 
by turn a lose proposition into a winner -PRON- would help deane to half a million 
balance against that be the three thousand dollar -PRON- be to receive for the risk and the trouble 
as though -PRON- have read -PRON- old friend thought deane lean forward and drop a confiding hand on -PRON- knee 
but five hundred a month -PRON- go on isnot all willing to do for -PRON- a bonus in the work 
make a show help -PRON- to unload and there s a stake for -PRON- to tuck away in -PRON- jean 
maybe that wouldnot be a boost eh 
bremerton -PRON- would start -PRON- on the way to easy street 
tell -PRON- more about the mine deane 
hang if i do down there and -PRON- can see -PRON- for -PRON- 
make a personal acquaintance with -PRON- give -PRON- a letter and a power of attorney -PRON- can handle the proposition just as though -PRON- own -PRON- 
what be the name of the man who be now in the hospital laceygordon lacey 
i donot want to butt in and take -PRON- job away from -PRON- 
deane fall back in -PRON- chair with a choppy laugh 
from under a paperweight on -PRON- desk -PRON- take a yellow slip 
read that say -PRON- a telegram i get from lacey the same day i wire -PRON- 
oh i guess -PRON- be not take anybodys job away from -PRON- 
the telegram be brief and to the point accept resignation 
i be do and probably do for 
gordon lacey advance -PRON- first month pay bremerton say deane as the telegram be quietly return to -PRON- 
all right return bremerton take the job 
hooray 
when will -PRON- start morning 
now then tell -PRON- the name of the mine just where find -PRON- and give -PRON- any other particular that will help -PRON- 
for fifteen minute the two be in close and earnest conversation but in the talk deane be strangely reticent about some thing and full of detail regard other 
when bremerton leave the office -PRON- have a check for five hundred dollar the confident good wish of deane and a vague idea that -PRON- be take rather a desperate leap in the dark 
after all -PRON- be that tenthousanddollar stake that settle the question so far as lee bremerton be concern 
on -PRON- foot and in health gordon lacey must have be a fine figure of a man 
with an eye keen for the architecture of bone and sinew frame that mystery of the spirit which make a human being worth while bremerton read the late superintendent of the mariquita mine for what -PRON- be 
day in hospital with strength ebb and flow about the misty borderland have pinch and whiten the face of the sick man 
yet close though -PRON- be to physical wreck lacey be superb 
-PRON- be nine in the evening when bremerton come to -PRON- 
the young interne at the office desk be doubtful whether the patient could be see 
with lacey the dangerpoint be past and -PRON- be mend but up to that hour -PRON- have be deny to visitor 
besides -PRON- be too late for visitor anyway 
five minute be all i ask with -PRON- plead bremerton 
a nurse be call and send to the ward 
-PRON- return with the announcement that lacey insist on a brief interview with the man who be step into -PRON- shoe at the mariquita 
so bremerton go up and the man in the white bed and -PRON- visitor exchange look and be straightway on friendly footing 
-PRON- may have just five minute mr lacey say the nurse glance at the openface watch on -PRON- breast 
five minute will do and the patient peer at bremerton with a haggard smile 
what can -PRON- tell -PRON- that will be of help lacey 
bremerton ask 
i donot want to tax -PRON- strength and i should not have come at this hour if another would have serve 
-PRON- be after seven when i reach phoenix and by sunrise tomorrow i shall be on -PRON- way into the hill 
in a few word give -PRON- the gist of the situation 
what do deane tell -PRON- 
a good deal but nothing bear on the real trouble 
with two superintendent deal with as -PRON- and the other have be in a mining district suppose to be peaceable and lawabide there s a deep grievance somewhere 
what be -PRON- deane leave unsaid -PRON- be all a mystery to -PRON- bremerton 
lacey pick thoughtfully at the bedclothe with -PRON- gaunt trembling finger 
-PRON- take the job on plain sayso that everything be square yes 
so do i have have hard place before and get the whiphand of -PRON- but this work at the mariquita come near be -PRON- finish 
when i first come i try to fill out the gap deaneleft in -PRON- story 
-PRON- secure the mine from carruther who at one time live here 
i try to locate carruther but -PRON- have decamp rather suddenly and no one know where -PRON- could be find 
after i have be on the job a few day mallory come and tell -PRON- -PRON- side and use threat 
i always look with suspicion upon a cause that be bolster up with threat 
i be short enough with mallory and then i be down with a cowardly shoot from the brush 
who be mallory deane do not mention -PRON- 
mallory bond the mine from carruther and fail to come across with the cash when the time limit expire 
ah murmur bremerton 
and what do mallory tell -PRON- lacey no use go into that 
the old scoundrel will see -PRON- soon and tell -PRON- the same thing 
what i want -PRON- to know what i want -PRON- to understand be this if ever -PRON- look on the bright face of danger and feel the ground opening beneath -PRON- and -PRON- foot slip toward bottomless deep remember -PRON- peril when girl confront -PRON- as -PRON- surely will 
a woman a faint smile cross the strong sunbrowne face of bremerton 
how be girl mix up in this sometimes i have think -PRON- be the very soul of all the plot and counterplot which bring poor old griggsby to -PRON- end and come so near get -PRON- 
bewilder line pucker around the sink gleam eye 
but i donot know i donot know 
angel or shedemon i do not last long enough at the mariquita to discover 
when -PRON- sfhile i find -PRON- danger great 
-PRON- send for -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- want to give -PRON- information of value and in ride to meet -PRON- i be snare like a helpless rabbit voice quiver with earnestness as -PRON- add as -PRON- value -PRON- life bremerton beware of mariquita mallory 
bremerton would have laugh but out of respect for this strong spirit that have try and fail -PRON- keep the laugh in -PRON- throat 
a few woman -PRON- have know and all of the good and -PRON- have yet to find one who could make a fool of -PRON- 
-PRON- one love be the silent great outdoors where mountain and plain be rib with gold -PRON- for the finding 
a woman could have no part in that 
i can see -PRON- think i be babble like an idiot go on lacey still gravely and earnestly but if i could tell -PRON- nothing else that one thing i want -PRON- to know beware of mariquita mallory 
mallory -PRON- -PRON- can take in -PRON- two hand and deal with -PRON- as an honest man deal with a scoundrel but a woman a beautiful that be different 
the nurse come toward the bed -PRON- eye on the watch 
i be afraid -PRON- must stop now say -PRON- 
only five minute dr preston say mr lacey 
just one thing more bremerton the sick man continue 
i have to leave king the cyanid expert in charge 
-PRON- be a capital cyanid expert but a poor hand with man 
the quicker -PRON- reach the mine the well 
-PRON- lift and hold out -PRON- hand 
remember what i have tell -PRON- about mariquita mallory and good luck 
bremerton clasp the hand cordially and gratefully and leave the ward 
once clear of the hospital building -PRON- look up at the round moon in the blue velvet sky hesitate a second then lay a course that carry -PRON- directly away from the hotel 
-PRON- be not a stranger in that town 
two year before -PRON- have outfit there for a prospecting trip into the harqua hala 
now -PRON- want to get away by -PRON- and think 
-PRON- word have be give to deane and -PRON- have take money 
for well or for bad -PRON- have plunge into this undertaking at the mariquita mine 
the keynote of -PRON- character be loyalty and nothing could shake -PRON- determination to give to interest the good that be in -PRON- word however have plunge -PRON- into a train of reflection none too pleasant 
-PRON- aimless foot bring -PRON- presently to the town ditch where the water ripple musically and the moonlight silver the cottonwood and where from the soft recess of the night come the note of a whippoorwill 
out of the dim past -PRON- memory construct a similar scene 
-PRON- have go into camp ata waterhole there be cottonwood like those whose white trunk now rise around -PRON- and then as now a whippoorwill sing in the distance 
but on that night as -PRON- recall -PRON- jhad be awaken by the cracking of a twig and have fight in the moonlight with a roving mexican who have try to steal -PRON- burro and -PRON- grubpack 
suddenly -PRON- pause straighten erect and listen 
as by the waterhole so long ago here by the phoenix town ditch -PRON- hear a stealthy footfall behind -PRON- 
instinctively -PRON- hand clench and -PRON- brace -PRON- for an encounter 
another moment and the mood pass 
with a low laugh -PRON- lean against the trunk of a tree 
well friend -PRON- call be -PRON- follow -PRON- or do -PRON- just happen that -PRON- be on -PRON- trail 
the dark figure which -PRON- eye have glimpse come out of the shadow and into a splotch of moonlight 
a large man in a broadbrimmed hat stand out against the dusky background clear as a silver print 
the head be shaggy with hair and beard and in the dark of the hatbrim two eye glow like point of flame 
-PRON- name mallory say a husky voice and be follow -PRON- ever since -PRON- strike town 
mr bremerton ainot -PRON- so this be mallory appear as lacey have foretell only somewhat before the time bremerton have expect -PRON-

pick out a comfortable place there against the time -PRON- be ready for -PRON- do griggsby pick out a place if -PRON- do what good do -PRON- do -PRON- 
-PRON- never live to get to the hospital do -PRON- i donot know about griggsby and i donot know who put lacey where -PRON- be 
all i do know be that deane will never get any good out of the mariquita mine and those who try to help -PRON- will never get no good out of -PRON- either 
deane be a cutthroat a pirate a blackhearte swine who -PRON- be talk of a friend of mine mallory bremerton interrupt sharply 
friend a husky jeering laugh come with the word 
a fine riend of -PRON- when -PRON- send -PRON- into such a trap as that at the mariquita wonderin why so interested in -PRON- movement bremerton 
i get a reason no sooner sign on with deane than i know of -PRON- 
a telegram from denver be relay to -PRON- in the hill 
i come to town and have be waitin for -PRON- 
since -PRON- get here i have trail around after -PRON- look for a chance to give -PRON- a bit of advice 
just out of kindness of heart that s all 
recall remark about mallory bremerton observe in a tone of chill finality when i want -PRON- advice mallory ask for -PRON- 
no -PRON- wonot the other return drop into the little pit deane have dig for -PRON- and -PRON- donot even sabe that -PRON- s ntuy malo 
i allow -PRON- think the villain in these here tragedy at the mariquita but -PRON- be wrong 
mallory step still close 
-PRON- put out a hand as though to lay -PRON- on arm but bremerton step back 
now that mallory be within arm reach of -PRON- bremerton could see that -PRON- beard and hair be iron gray and that -PRON- face be oldold in way of the world perhaps as well as in year 
-PRON- act as if i be a rattler go on mallory and soundin a warning before i strike 
man -PRON- be way wide of -PRON- trail 
the warning give -PRON- be for -PRON- own good 
there be other who will strike if -PRON- do not listen young lee bremerton 
five hundred dollar a month for six month and ten thousand as a bonus if -PRON- make goodwhat be -PRON- 
just a bait to lure -PRON- into the same fate that overtake griggsbyl leave the mariquita mine alone 
-PRON- can make nothing of -PRON- and in the end -PRON- will wring -PRON- dry and toss -PRON- bone on the scrapheap 
clear out order bremerton have none of the threat -PRON- call advice and warning 
the old man draw a deep sigh and without a word turn away 
-PRON- pass like a specter through the pool of moonlight and melt into the shadow beyond 
scarcely have -PRON- vanish when footfall reach ear 
swift and catlike -PRON- come from either side and from behind 
bremerton be a man who always stand -PRON- ground 
-PRON- square -PRON- now to meet what be to come 
vague shadowy shape be close in glide toward -PRON- swiftly from three different direction 
if that be there be no challenge no parley 
out from among the whitetrunke cottonwood hurry fantom shape and in grim silence fall upon bremerton 
one moment -PRON- see -PRON- come and the next moment -PRON- be among -PRON- and fighting 
-PRON- have only -PRON- bare hand 
-PRON- assailant be arm with club and one of -PRON- have a quirt for -PRON- thong fall stingingly over face and throat 
the hot blood leap in the prospector vein 
these coward four or five or half a dozen of -PRON- be upon -PRON- in a crowd with -PRON- whip and -PRON- bludgeon 
-PRON- be like a pack of wolf 
outrage every principle of fair play -PRON- would smother -PRON- under a weight of number and give -PRON- no chance for -PRON- 
circumstance like these be more than enough to arouse all the savage resentment rn nature 
in a flash -PRON- become the lee reckless of those old day with cornered wildcata cave man with -PRON- back to the walla fury with all the seethe elemental passion uppermost 
-PRON- foe be many and -PRON- must take -PRON- one by one 
while -PRON- charge a single vague shape -PRON- be force to run a gantlet of blow that stagger and daze -PRON- 
yet one man crumple under the weight of -PRON- fist and as the ruffian groan and pitch forward the prospector whirl and charge again 
foot crunch and slip in the gravelly soil sharp labored breathing rent the air in staccatolike note and over all rise the sodden thump of the club 
again and again the prospector wrench -PRON- clear of the press 
perhaps not one blow in half a dozen reach -PRON- for the gloom and the excitement send many of -PRON- wild but the bludgeon that find -PRON- mark have a cruelly crush strength behind -PRON- 
while -PRON- drive before -PRON- another of -PRON- foe the rest hang upon -PRON- back and belabor -PRON- viciously 
nothing keep -PRON- from -PRON- quarry 
at the edge of the town canal the retreat enemy be force to make a stand 
bremerton glimpse the man swarthy scowl face in the moonlight 
the fellow have raise a club for a tell blow 
before the club could fall bremerton grasp -PRON- and wrench -PRON- away 
almost simultaneously -PRON- hard fist dart at the shadowy face and the man go over the brink of the canal and into the water with a splash 
bremerton whirl smash right and leave with the club 
another man be strike and beat to -PRON- knee 
the prospector trample -PRON- roughly to get at -PRON- companion 
a stick aim at head glance and strike -PRON- right arm 
the arm fall limp and useless as though a bone have be snap 
a sicken pain convulse the prospector whole body but -PRON- rally magnificently 
-PRON- have lose -PRON- weapon and fqr offense and defense -PRON- have now only -PRON- left hand 
slowly -PRON- physical power be fail but -PRON- resolution grow as -PRON- strength diminish 
-PRON- spring at another of -PRON- assailant and just at the moment a pair of arm encircle -PRON- knee and -PRON- be throw from -PRON- foot 
then the pack close in 
on -PRON- head -PRON- shoulder -PRON- back rain the blow 
-PRON- left arm protect -PRON- face but finally that arm too drop away 
with a choking gasp -PRON- measure -PRON- length on the ground lie there helplessly while -PRON- fight to hold -PRON- fading sense 
the attack cease 
some one knelt beside -PRON- and whisper hoarsely in -PRON- ear this be all for now but go out to the mariquita mine and bad will follow 
remember what the voice die out in ear 
a pall suddenly encompass -PRON- faculty and -PRON- neither hear nor realize anything more 
-PRON- drift back to reason presently and find -PRON- alone 
-PRON- head throb and -PRON- whole body rebel when -PRON- attempt to move 
-PRON- grind -PRON- tooth to stifle a groan 
by degree -PRON- brain clear 
mallory have threaten and man have be handily by to make clear to -PRON- that the threat be to be take seriously have -PRON- chance at -PRON- muttered bremerton hoarsely and some day get -PRON- chance at -PRON- 
-PRON- try to lift -PRON- to -PRON- knee but the white stem of the cottonwood dance mistily around -PRON- and again -PRON- flatten out on the earth 
water would revive -PRON- 
if -PRON- could get to the crawl in the direction of the ditch dig into the ground with -PRON- finger and pull and push -PRON- on 
pain like dagger stab -PRON- in a dozen place 
for all that -PRON- find -PRON- could use -PRON- arm and leg so -PRON- could not be that any bone be break 
-PRON- be come out of that oneside battle much better than -PRON- have any reason to hope 
although bruised and sore -PRON- be not seriously injure 
for several minute -PRON- lie at the edge of the canal scoop up the water and splash -PRON- over -PRON- face 
little by little -PRON- strength return 
the night wind whisper soothingly among the cottonwood leave and the song of the whippoorwill echo from the peaceful shadow 
but what be this 
the bird out yonderwhat be -PRON- singe 
with a painful effort -PRON- lift -PRON- bruised and batter body on one elbow and stare in the direction of the misty alfalfafield trickle from a fleshwound on -PRON- forehead overflow and blind -PRON- eye 
remove a handkerchief from -PRON- pocket -PRON- hold -PRON- in the water and then pass -PRON- over -PRON- feverish face a crazy fool -PRON- mumble 
what the whippoorwill say to the star have long ago be establish 
only -PRON- disordered fancy could make anything else out of -PRON- 
-PRON- wit surely have go far afield to imagine the burden of those flutelike note 
what under heaven have possess -PRON- sick and suffer as -PRON- be to think of mariquita in connection with that scrap of melody 
mariquita 
angel or do not know which 
why in that hour be -PRON- in -PRON- thought 
lacey have be ride to meet the girl when -PRON- be shoot from the brush 
very possibly there by the town canal -PRON- have inspire that club of the man who be to take place 
bremerton sop the blood from -PRON- face with the wet handkerchief curse the name and -PRON- who bear -PRON- 
at last -PRON- arise to a sit posture wring the linen dry and bind up -PRON- temple with -PRON- 
-PRON- be a rifleshot from the main street of the town and -PRON- must get back to -PRON- hotel 
a glow of electric light hang in the sky well beyond the shadow of the cottonwood 
-PRON- eye measure the distance between the canal and the farflung maze of the arc and the incandescent 
for a man with two good leg under -PRON- the way be not far but for bremerton in -PRON- present condition -PRON- be very far indeed and perhaps impossible 
-PRON- try to lift -PRON- erect but only half succeed when -PRON- sink to the earth again 
as yet -PRON- have not master -PRON- ache nerve and muscle 
-PRON- could crawl at least if -PRON- could not walk 
on hand and knee sway uncertainly as -PRON- go -PRON- make -PRON- slow passage toward the edge of the cottonwood 
on the scene of -PRON- struggle with bravos -PRON- grope finger encounter something which puzzle -PRON- 
the object be round about the size of -PRON- fist and tie up in a cloth 
at first -PRON- think -PRON- a slungshot drop by one of the miscreant who have work -PRON- will with -PRON- 
-PRON- be curious enough however to grope in -PRON- pocket for a match and then by -PRON- light to make a more thorough examination 
yes at a time when another would have think only of -PRON- physical torment bremerton could give time and strength to trifle 
in prospect for gold a thousand trifle carefully weigh may lead to a strike 
year of prospect have teach -PRON- the value of the little thing and -PRON- do not neglect -PRON- 
the cloth enclose the round object prove to be a red cotton handkerchief carefully tie 
-PRON- remove the cord the fold of the handkerchief fall away and a small globe of frost silver lie reveal 
an exclamation of wonder escape lip 
the silver ball be a sphere of amalgamgold coat with quicksilver just as take from the plate of a mill and squeeze in a chamois skin 
the squeezing have drive off some of the quick and give the mass -PRON- spherical form 
of course the ball have be drop by one of assailant 
-PRON- prove that at least one of the rascal be a mill man or indirectly have something to do with a stampmill 
this in -PRON- be no identification as there be hundred of such man in that part of the country 
with the aid of another match bremerton examine the ball more closely 
-PRON- upper surface be a curious formation of small ridge where the fold of the chamois have be gather together and strong pressure apply with the hand 
the low half of the sphere be smooth save for an indentation that resemble the letter or be -PRON- an bremerton scowl 
by some chance the mallory father and daughter be so vividly in -PRON- mind that -PRON- instinctively look for -PRON- everywhere 
-PRON- growl over -PRON- folly replace the ball in the handkerchief and stow -PRON- away in a coat pocket 
then -PRON- would have crawl on again have a sound not reach -PRON- ear and suggest caution 
-PRON- be a sound of horse hoof approach slowly from the direction of the road 
-PRON- could see the rider indistinctly come through the heavy shadow cast by the tree 
the horse move to right and leave in a zigzag course as though -PRON- rider be seek something 
bremerton wonder grimly whether -PRON- or the ball of amalgam be the object of the stranger quest 
suddenly while -PRON- kneel there watch and wait the approach rider pass a spot upon which the moonbeam have full play 
a gasp of amazement come from bremerton 
the silvery light touch as with a caress the bare head of a woman 
the hair shine and luxuriant be brush smoothly back from the temple 
in -PRON- strand the stem of a fullblown rose be entangle 
the woman face be dim yet bremerton could see enough of -PRON- to know that -PRON- must have be wondrously fair 
-PRON- form be erect and graceful and -PRON- be mount in a man saddle and ride as a man would ride 
if -PRON- happen to be look for -PRON- call bremerton grimly this way 
the girl start peer in the direction from which the voice have come and quicken the pace of -PRON- horse 
if -PRON- happen to be lee bremerton say -PRON- in a voice at once soft and musical then i be look for -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh huskily and jeeringly be very much alive -PRON- return which be probably a great disappointment to mariquita mallory 
the illnature remark seem to make no impression upon -PRON- 
draw -PRON- horse to a stop -PRON- dismount calmly and step in front of bremerton 
bremerton know this girl be mariquita mallory 
in -PRON- mind that conviction be as fix as fate 
first have come -PRON- father then -PRON- father man and now why not the girl -PRON- 
-PRON- seem peculiarly fitting 
not too close -PRON- order sharply 
about where -PRON- arewill be near enough 
fear be a mental poison which -PRON- strong soul have never know 
some day when -PRON- brain be sick and -PRON- be physically break -PRON- may know -PRON- but -PRON- would not be a woman who cause -PRON- heart to fail and -PRON- courage to wane 
-PRON- command the girl to keep -PRON- distance because -PRON- whole nature be in hot revolt against -PRON- and -PRON- father and -PRON- scheme of violence 
-PRON- give -PRON- word no attention 
serenely -PRON- glide to a spot from which -PRON- could have reach forth and touch -PRON- have -PRON- wish to do so 
be -PRON- badly hurt mr bremerton -PRON- ask softly 
no -PRON- answer shortly 
-PRON- be cowardly to set a pack of hoodlum upon an unarmed man like that 
i agree with -PRON- and as soon as i hear of -PRON- i come here 
i want to help -PRON- to be -PRON- friend 
may i have the chance 
there be a wistfulness in -PRON- voice which do not escape -PRON- warn still rang in -PRON- ear however and -PRON- think -PRON- be play a part for purpose of -PRON- own 
clear out -PRON- call roughly and leave -PRON- to -PRON- all i ask of -PRON- 
be -PRON- able to get back to -PRON- hotel -PRON- persist 
yes 
-PRON- stagger to -PRON- foot 
sway drunkenly -PRON- be compel to lay hold of a tree and support -PRON- 
madre mia the girl breathe how -PRON- must have be beat 
oh the fiend the coward 
-PRON- clasp -PRON- hand convulsively 
and -PRON- thinkyou think that i have a hand in this contemptible night work 
-PRON- could not see -PRON- face there in the shadow but -PRON- voice go through the phase of sympathy and indignation and reproach 
-PRON- acting be superb no guesswork say -PRON- sternly all a matter of fact a woman and i donot want to forget that in -PRON- talking with -PRON- 
will -PRON- go 
in a little while 
i canot leave -PRON- like this 
be -PRON- still intend to go out to the mariquita mine mr bremerton if -PRON- and -PRON- father have any idea -PRON- can scare -PRON- -PRON- will have to guess again go to the mine and get the good on those who settle for griggsby and send lacey to the hospital 
tell -PRON- father that 
i suppose i have any more sand than griggsby or lacey but tough and go to last long enough to do the work that bring -PRON- here 
a breath like a sigh come from the dark slender figure confront bremerton 
if -PRON- be not suffer say the girl if i do not know -PRON- be in physical pain i could tell -PRON- thing which would make a change in -PRON- plan 
i think -PRON- be a man of courage and the brave be usually just 
i can imagine that what -PRON- have hear about -PRON- father and -PRON- have not cause -PRON- to feel very friendly toward -PRON- but donot be hasty 
reserve judgment mr bremerton 
a man who will trap another with a crowd of hoodlum as -PRON- father trap -PRON- want anything but justice 
if -PRON- have -PRON- desert -PRON- would probably be in the phoenix jail this minute and for all i know -PRON- would be there with -PRON- 
-PRON- canot handle -PRON- as -PRON- do lacey or stop 
the word flash at -PRON- daggerlike 
a temper the girl have carefully conceal up to that moment dart keen and sharp to the surface of -PRON- nature 
for an instant bremerton be surprised and then -PRON- reflect that -PRON- rough speaking have tear away the mask and give -PRON- a glimpse of the real mariquita mallory 
there be a throb of sorrow and undernote of grief shudder through that blaze of anger but -PRON- pass -PRON- say something the girl go on in a stifle voice that -PRON- may one day be sorry for 
i be here to help youlet -PRON- repeat that again 
and let -PRON- repeat that i want none of -PRON- help 
while i be at the mariquita the less i see of -PRON- father and -PRON- the well 
after a brief space mariquita step to -PRON- horse and lay a hand on the bit 
then -PRON- lead the animal close to bremerton 
get into the saddle -PRON- say crisply and ride to -PRON- hotel 
leave the horse at the post in front and i will either come after -PRON- -PRON- or send for -PRON- 
-PRON- persistence irritated bremerton 
-PRON- and -PRON- father be enemy of and so of mine -PRON- answer 
i donot intend to begin -PRON- work by place -PRON- under even a slight obligation to -PRON- 
take -PRON- horse and go away 
i can shift for -PRON- 
-PRON- step back into the moonlight 
-PRON- right hand lift to the level of -PRON- eye and a small revolver glimmer in -PRON- finger 
mount -PRON- order 
this will settle the obligation business 
if necessary i can force -PRON- to be sensible 
mount and ride to -PRON- hotel and leave the horse as i tell -PRON- 
the gleam in -PRON- eye match the silvery sheen of the level weapon 
-PRON- erect graceful figure the moonbeam shimmer on -PRON- hair and on the rose in -PRON- thick coil the beautiful face frame strongly in light and shadow and over all -PRON- dominant and resolute bearing conspire to form a picture that stir bremerton strangely 
what a woman 
one moment soft and gentle and pleading and the next moment fiery with determination and enforce -PRON- command at the muzzle of a revolver 
the novelty the inconsistency of -PRON- all break over -PRON- presently and -PRON- laugh 
nevertheless -PRON- lift a foot to the stirrup and climb weakly into the saddle 
-PRON- ride away leave mariquita there in the moonlight 
the last -PRON- see of -PRON- the revolver and the hand that hold -PRON- swing at -PRON- side and -PRON- fancy a smile wreathe -PRON- shadowy lip 
-PRON- be midnight when bremerton dismount in front of -PRON- hotel and walk unsteadily into the office 
the night clerk gasp and stare at -PRON- wonderingly 
-PRON- clothing be tear and earthstaine and in disorder and -PRON- face be puff and bruise and a redden bandage be swathe about -PRON- forehead 
the key to seventeen say bremerton brace -PRON- at the counter 
great gun murmur the clerk 
what have happen to -PRON- -PRON- have not be on duty when bremerton arrive and -PRON- hastily run -PRON- eye down the page of the open register 
i should think mr bremerton that -PRON- need a doctor 
let -PRON- help -PRON- upstairs and then i will call a i can get upstairs alone cut in bremerton and donot bother about a doctor not in such bad shape as -PRON- seem to think 
-PRON- take -PRON- key and start for the stair 
in about five minute -PRON- add halt a moment send up a boy with a pitcher of icewater and some telegraphblank 
if -PRON- have be beat up and rob by thug -PRON- ought to get the police busy 
i havenot be rob 
just have a little hard luck that s all and i donot want the matter to go any further a case of least say soon mend 
understand certainly mr bremerton but bremerton wait for no more but slowly ascend the stair to -PRON- room 
-PRON- be weak and dizzy and after -PRON- have snap on the electric light -PRON- fall sprawl on the bed 
-PRON- ache and pain seem to have be lose in a paralyzing nausea that fill -PRON- body 
have -PRON- not be in the pink of physical condition hardy and robust from year of wander through the untracked wilderness that beating must surely have be the death of -PRON- 
breathe hard and with every muscle relax -PRON- lie on -PRON- back starirtg up at the ceiling 
the mallory have take this method to frighten -PRON- away from the mariquita mine 
-PRON- little know the temper of the man -PRON- be deal with 
so far from intimidate -PRON- -PRON- resolution to help deane be merely strengthen 
for year -PRON- have breast the blow of circumstance 
the more difficulty -PRON- encounter and conquer the great -PRON- pride in any success -PRON- may achieve 
fear and discouragement be for weakling 
and lee bremerton have never be a weakling 
strangely enough the event of the night bring -PRON- a certain measure of relief and satisfaction 
-PRON- have vaguely imagine from reticence in certain matter that some sharp practise lie back of the murderous enmity for man at the mine 
that deane be none too scrupulous in forward -PRON- owh interest bremerton understand thoroughly 
those who resort to cudgel and a night attack be never the one with a just cause behind -PRON- 
so by implication right to the mariquita property have be prove 
this be what afford the prospector -PRON- relief and satisfaction daughter be a good deal of a puzzle 
certainly -PRON- be a splendid actress 
at first -PRON- have assume a friendly attitude hope no doubt to deceive -PRON- to win -PRON- confidence and then to work upon -PRON- sympathy 
but -PRON- have anger -PRON- by a few word that emphasize -PRON- knowledge of -PRON- true character arid -PRON- have burst into sudden flame like a powder magazine touch by a light match 
sick as -PRON- be -PRON- rather pride -PRON- on have force aside the mask for a glimpse of the real mariquita mallory 
yet in spite of -PRON- positive conviction there be something about the girl that defy a complete understanding of -PRON- 
when i get over the effect of this club -PRON- assure -PRON- be able to think to well purpose 
lacey be undecided in -PRON- estimate of the girl but tell -PRON- to beware of -PRON- 
-PRON- appear to be a clearheaded sort of fellow and i canot see why -PRON- be undecided 
-PRON- little experience with mariquita mallory have leave -PRON- with no doubt at all 
still if i know more a sensation hard to define overshadow -PRON- conclusion 
-PRON- be a sensation that baffle analysis 
the mine be call the mariquita 
the name could scarcely be a coincidence 
of course the girl have inspire -PRON- 
yet how and why if this person carruther have originally locate the property have carruther know mariquita mallory 
have -PRON- be so greatly impressed with -PRON- that -PRON- have give -PRON- name to -PRON- mine 
these be trifle thought 
as question -PRON- merely harass a mind which be unequal to any sort of struggle with -PRON- 
a light quick step sound in the hall accompany by a musical tinkling of ice in a pitcher 
a knock fall on the door and a boy enter the room with water telegraphblank and write material 
wait say bremerton 
-PRON- brain whirl as -PRON- rise from the bed and seat -PRON- at a small table 
a drink of icewater refresh -PRON- somewhat and -PRON- slowly write out the following message silas deane 
denver 
arrive phoenix this evening 
work promise to be interesting 
off for mine tomorrow 
bremerton 
-PRON- give telegram arid money to the boy and send -PRON- away 
then as well as -PRON- be able -PRON- look after -PRON- injury and go to bed 
a not always in real life do name fit the character of those who bear -PRON- 
as a case in point mortimer king cyanid expert at the mariquita mine be anything but regal anything but manful and twohande in -PRON- sway over man and affair 
from a to -PRON- know -PRON- cyanid work 
there be keenness and penetration in -PRON- mild washedout blue eye 
from a glass of solution hold up to the light -PRON- could almost determine by sight alone how many pound of potassium cyanid should be throw into the big vat to bring -PRON- content up to standard 
and there be those who say that by merely glance at a handful of tailing -PRON- would figure -PRON- -PRON- worth in ton lot to a cent 
but -PRON- be not even primerwise in a knowledge of human nature and -PRON- be a child in tact and diplomacy and a mere babe in arm when -PRON- come to meet a hard situation with judgment and energy 
lacey have know this when leave king in charge 
rack with pain and half delirious when bear away from the mariquita -PRON- have be in no condition to pick and choose a successor pro tern 
even so -PRON- have yet have no second choice whatever -PRON- other shortcoming king be the only man at the mine who in the absence of the superintendent would be loyal to deane 
two week lacey have be go 
-PRON- be week of mental distress for king who realize fully -PRON- own incompetence 
if affair have go badly under lacey -PRON- nearly go to smash under king 
about all the cyathid expert hope for be to hold the mine organization together until the new man arrive to fill the place vacate by lacey 
trouble begin almost before lacey have be carry over the hill in the mine buckboard 
the miner strike for high pay although -PRON- be re ceive well wage than be be pay at any other mine in that district 
-PRON- strike apparently just to be contrary and worry mortimer king 
with no mining go on the orehauler have to be lay off with no drill to point the blacksmith and -PRON- helper be out of a job and with nothing to mill the millman be force into idleness 
then the spirit of unrest lay hold of the cyanid worker and one by one -PRON- drift away to loaf with the other 
king be at -PRON- wit end and telegraph wildly to deane go to pot the new man 
and to this deane answer in characteristic vein keep -PRON- shirt on 
new man on the job thursday morning 
king begin count the day until thursday 
on wednesday some unknown person smuggle a supply of red liquor into camp

bremerton stare at -PRON- a moment in silent contempt 
turn to king -PRON- ask be this the fellow who chase the chinaman out of camp

big steve have be on a tear ever since wednesday

i wouldnot have be in -PRON- shoe for all the gold in arizona 
who be -PRON- amalgamator in the millone of the good amalgamator in the business 
-PRON- have -PRON- peculiarity though no room here for a man of -PRON- stripe 
when -PRON- sleep off that jag send -PRON- to -PRON- for -PRON- time 
here -PRON- 
bremerton beckon to the man near the dry wash 
i need some of -PRON- 
-PRON- come forward with alacrity 
what -PRON- have just see have inspire a certain amount of respect for the new superintendent 
carry this man away order bremerton 
one of -PRON- put out -PRON- horse and bring the ride gear to the affice 
one minute first 
-PRON- whirl and run the man over with a sharp appraising eye 
what be -PRON- do over there while that big ruffian be try to massacre the little fellow the man shift about uneasily 
one of -PRON- finally speak pilgrim when big in likker weall make -PRON- a pint to hide out and watch keerful 
meddlin with steve at -PRON- time be uncommon risky 
mean to say -PRON- be all scared 
wall now i donot reckon say skeere a mighty sight of diffence between be skeere and exercisin plain caution with a madman like steve when -PRON- s on the rampage 
i allow -PRON- plumb hypnotize -PRON- be drink too say bremerton quick to read the sign 
hereafter when any of -PRON- want to get drunk -PRON- will do -PRON- in phoenix and not at the mariquita mine take place understand 
while in charge there will be no whisky in camp 
remove that man and look after -PRON- horse 
on the jump 
bremerton pull the saddle bag from behind the cantle and pass to the officedoor 
king anticipate a demand for the office key have hurry to get -PRON- from the laboratory 
when thing begin to go wrong here mr bremerton -PRON- explain i think well lock up the office 
-PRON- be mortimer king yes 
the new superintendent step through the doorway into the square little room where the clerical work be carry on 
king have pause to watch three of the man pick up big steve 
two or three article drop from the amalgamator coat while -PRON- be be lift 
one be a bag of tobacco another a flask and still another ivas a square of dingy chamois skin 
well gather up that stuff and take -PRON- along say king 
hold on a minute interpose bremerton 
-PRON- hurry out of the office and set -PRON- heek on the flask 
for a moment -PRON- eye rest on the chamois skin 
an exclamation escape -PRON- and -PRON- stoop and pick -PRON- up 
-PRON- stuff the chamois skin into -PRON- pocket as -PRON- go back into the office 
now mr king say -PRON- justr what be the situation here 
i find the chinaman camp out at a waterhole between here and town 
-PRON- tell -PRON- a little but only enough to make -PRON- anxious for more 
bremerton sit down in front of the rolltop desk take pipe and tobacco from -PRON- pocket and prepare for a smoke 
king draw up a chair sink into -PRON- and compose -PRON- agitate nerve 
there be something about the new superintendent that inspire confidence 
courage and determination be quality which never fail to command the wholesome respect of enemy and the trust of friend 
as the weak vessel king defer humbly to bremerton glad that deane have secure such a man to captain the dubious fortune of the mine 
a strong face shine lividly in the light of the match bremerton trail over the pipebowl 
bruise discolored and with here and there a black patch along with -PRON- grimness the face contrive to reflect an amiable as well as a dauntless spirit 
little mortimer king warm to the man and do not hesitate to confess -PRON- own failing 
i be a pretty poor stick for lacey to leave in charge bremerton say -PRON- 
i have no sense or sand in deal with the neardesperadoe on this mine payroll 
the man know -PRON- and lacey be hardly carry over the hill before -PRON- begin to take advantage bear down on -PRON- king return bremerton 
sometimes the difficulty that be one man meat be another man poison 
a few in this world be equip for one thing and a few for some other thing 
the master potter fashion the clay from design and pattern of -PRON- own 
-PRON- be not -PRON- business to go behind the return and try to puzzle out the reason 
go on and tell -PRON- about the situation here 
king be surprised to find bremerton as forceful in thought as well as in action 
-PRON- do not know of the lonely year bremerton have spend in the wild commune with -PRON- as -PRON- trod the unblazed trail or guess at the heart of thing as -PRON- lie on a blanket look up at the star 
the cyanid expert begin at the beginning 
-PRON- tell of the strike among the miner and how the failure of the ore supply have paralyze all the other activity of the camp 
as an idle man be always ripe for trouble report lead up logically to the whiskydrinking and the cut loose of big steve 
bremerton listen quietly and when king pause remark a wonder -PRON- didnot cut and run 
but i be leave in charge exclaim the expert 
-PRON- be -PRON- business to stay here no matter what happen 
a quizzical light fill gray eye yet -PRON- nod soberly 
i see 
when a man do -PRON- good there be nothing more to be say 
when do -PRON- have -PRON- last clean up at the mill just after the miner quit work 
the millman hang on for a while and i keep -PRON- busy scrape the plate 
how do the cleanup pan out slim always slim and not what -PRON- ought to be what bother lacey andand poor old griggsby 
-PRON- mill ten ton of rock work both shift 
the orefeeder throw out every tenth shovelful as the ore go into the hopper 
i quarter the sample down and get a value of twelve dollar and some odd cent to the ton no bonanza rock about that cut in bremerton be no bonanza rock mill since deane take over the property 
if -PRON- here -PRON- havenot be able to find -PRON- 
the tailing come from the plate assay something over two dollar to the ton 
the difference of about ten dollar a ton or a hundred dollar for a twentyfour hour millrun should be leave on the plate 
but -PRON- isnot there 
the good -PRON- can show the good -PRON- have ever be able to show since deane secure this property be seven hundred to a thousand dollar for every two week cleanup 
fifty dollar a day muse bremerton not enough to pay expense be rob 
griggsby think so and lacey be of the same opinion 
but -PRON- couldnot prove anything 
the leak wherever -PRON- be have be too well covered 
-PRON- be right in say -PRON- donot pay expense with the mill 
the cyanid plant be just able to cover the shortage 
that of course doesnot leave anything for -PRON- s not run a mine for the love of -PRON- 
no king -PRON- doesnot do much of anything for the mere love of -PRON- bremerton remark dryly go into all this later 
i havenot be -PRON- for a couple of day and the ride from town rather fag -PRON- 
i think rest until after dinner 
where do i bunk king get up and open a door off the side of the room 
here be where griggsby and lacey have -PRON- sleep quarter say -PRON- 
if -PRON- would rather not sleep here though there s a more comfortable place down at the laboratory 
this will do 
tell the miner to see -PRON- after the noon meal have -PRON- hereif -PRON- will come 
the man that doesnot come hunt another job 
impress that on -PRON- 
king leave the office 
as soon as -PRON- be go bremerton get up go to the table and remove a handkerchiefwrapped package from one of the saddlebag 
-PRON- unlock the desk and push back the rolltop 
a litter of paper lie under -PRON- eye just as leave by lacey 
-PRON- brush the paper aside untie the handkerchief seat -PRON- and lean forward to examine the ball of amalgam a clue all right -PRON- mutter a bit f luck right at the startoff see how that match the mark on the mend chamois 
the chamois skin drop from the pocket of the unconscious big steve be an old one 
almost in -PRON- very center a jagged tear have be mend with needle and thread 
the sewing have be do by whip the thread over and over along the edge of the tear leave an upraised surface 
this surface mark match the indentation in the bottom of the amalgam ball perfectly 
-PRON- be evidence indisputable evidence that the mend chamois have be use in squeeze some of the quicksilver out of that particular lump of amalgam 
circumstance point a damn finger at big steve 
-PRON- lead also to interesting speculation regard the finding of that steal silver ball among the cottonwood by the phoenix town canal 
while bremerton bent thoughtfully over the desk a sheet of paper meet -PRON- eye on top of the heap -PRON- have push aside 
pick -PRON- out of the litter -PRON- read the follow write in fine feminine chirography mr lacey if -PRON- will come to -PRON- at the arroyo at nine this evening i will tell -PRON- something of great importance to -PRON- 
trust -PRON- this once and -PRON- will not regret -PRON- 
mariquita maleory 
bremerton drop back in -PRON- chair a savage exclamation on -PRON- lip the note that lure lacey into a trap -PRON- murmur and drop -PRON- on the desk and strike -PRON- with -PRON- clenched fist 
a long hard ride from phoenix have almost wear -PRON- out 
-PRON- have spend the whole of the precede day in bed and every movement of -PRON- bruised limb have bring -PRON- pain 
in the small hour of that friday morning -PRON- have dress bargain at the near corral for a horse and before sunrise have put mile behind -PRON- on the way to the mariquita mine 
at first -PRON- stubborn will have to goad -PRON- batter body into action 
as -PRON- ride progress however -PRON- stiffen limb and flag muscle yield with grow grace to the grim purpose that drive -PRON- 
-PRON- iron physique dormant for a space recuperate swiftly 
-PRON- be like a machine which slow to start at first presently yield to the spell of motion and run with increase ease and power 
not until -PRON- enter the headquarters adobe have -PRON- be conscious of any feeling of fatigue 
-PRON- have dismiss king and plan to lie down for a brief rest 
but -PRON- could not leave the desk until -PRON- have test the clue of the amalgam ball and the chamois skin and now that brief note from the mallory girl arouse feeling that make rest impossible 
-PRON- get to -PRON- foot lean against the top of the desk and sweep -PRON- eye around the office 
there in premise just take over by -PRON- griggsby and lacey have live and and lacey the unfortunate man who have precede -PRON- in the service of deane 
the letterfile on the shelf the map on the wall the cabinet of ore specimen the letterpress the table in the center of the room the picture of the martyr garfield hang near the doorall these trifle detail of the room appeal to -PRON- strongly 
-PRON- constitute surrounding which griggsby and lacey have know to -PRON- sorrow 
a black memory be over everything and the mallory be the cause 
bremerton frowning darkly swear to -PRON- that -PRON- would bring home to the girl and -PRON- father the consequence of -PRON- deed 
make a win proposition of the mariquita mine be but a part of -PRON- work the other part be to make sure that justice have -PRON- due 
for the killing of griggsby the wounding of lacey and the work of that cowardly gang by the phoenix town ditch some one should pay 
bremerton pass to the open door and lean there look out upon the camp 
the mine lie in a shallow valley border with bleak hill cover with cactus clump 
the ramshackle structure housing the tenstamp mill stand at the left perch on the top of an incline of the valley floor 
flank the mill on one side be the cyanid tank and hard by the tank be the shakeroofed shakesided laboratory building 
in the middle distance be the bunkhouse with -PRON- shatter window 
to the right of the bunkhouse stand the chuckshanty 
beyond wun headquarters be a cleft in the valley wall in which be huddle the jacal of the mexican 
between mill and bunkhouse be post the derrick with -PRON- whip and the shafthouse with -PRON- hoisting engine 
the whole valley be gouge and gophere and sprinkle with heap of country rock 
the road from the shaft to the head of the mill have be powder white by hoof and wheel and gleam in the sun like a trail of whitewash 
there be nothing allure in the scene nothing even picturesque 
the valley wear a forbidding threatening look 
like a long black serpent the pipeline trail past the mexican quarter coil around the chuckshanty and rear an ugly spouting head midway between the bunkhouse and the headquarters adobe 
a branch of -PRON- crawl on to the cyanid tank and the mill 
silence brood over the place 
the man from the dry wash be loaf about the bunkhouse and there be activity manifest among the mexican 
big steve have cease to rule the camp and the laborer be take heart 
a new superintendent have come and while -PRON- may not last long yet -PRON- protect arm be over the property for a time at least 
and price for this junkheap mutter bremerton be half a million 
i be the connect link between deane and that money -PRON- last chance -PRON- only hope for a big cleanup 
well -PRON- shall see 
if there s anything well than tendollar rock here go to find -PRON- 
-PRON- leave the door take an automatic revolver from one of the saddlebag and carry -PRON- with -PRON- into the sleepingroom 
there be a musty smell in the cramped quarter and -PRON- raise a window 
before lie down on the cot -PRON- place the weapon handy by on a chair 
with a sigh of relief -PRON- stretch -PRON- out on the blanket of -PRON- creak bed 
-PRON- relax every tired muscle but -PRON- do not want to sleep and -PRON- mind keep busy 
mentally -PRON- catalogue the successive step of the work before -PRON- 
first the mine must be put in run order 
next the leak in the mill must be investigate 
follow that -PRON- would learn why the property have be call a bonanza with only tendollar rock find -PRON- way to the stamp 
a duty which may come first or last or distribute -PRON- over the entire process of rehabilitate the mine be search out the stealthy force engage in a deathgrapple with deane 
to reorganize the worker and keep in motion the wheel of mining milling and cyaniding be the small part of problem 
judgment and determination would take care of that 
probe the thievery in the mill would not be so difficult now that bremerton have a reliable clue big steve be not a man to be discharge the superintendent now decide but to be retain keep at work and watch 
-PRON- be the key to the miss amalgam 
with only a tenstamp mill to grind out rock whose gross assay value be but little well than ten dollar to the ton the mariquita mine could never approach the splendid proportion of a bonanza property 
here there be something wrong 
deane be altogether too smart a speculator to be hook by a job of salt 
when -PRON- secure the mine -PRON- have certainly know what -PRON- be do 
nor would the mallory fight so savagely to keep deane out of -PRON- right if the object of that fight be such a poorpaying proposition as show on -PRON- face 
-PRON- must know something that old plotter and -PRON- girl 
yet what be -PRON- -PRON- know one answer to this question be a fabulously rich lead a lead know to the mallory but lose to griggsby and lacey 
while mallory have work the mine under bond -PRON- have pay huge return 
those return have capture the grasp fancy of deane man however have fail to make the mine pay anything more than run expense 
the only explanation of such a state of affair be a rich vein on the property which have defy the effort of griggsby and lacey to find -PRON- 
-PRON- be possible that suqh a vein may have be work out and exhausted 
dispute this theory be the fact that the mallory would not fight for a mine whose ore be hardly worth the trouble of dig and milling 
no the mallory have an object in keep up that struggle with deane 
there be a reef of gold which uncover once must be bring to light again 
as big steve be the key to the miss amalgam so the mallory be a key to that lose lead thought cover these various topic slowly and methodically 
-PRON- want to be sure of -PRON- ground as -PRON- mentally pace -PRON- off 
two or three hour pass and -PRON- finally become aware that -PRON- eye be absently regard a frame photograph on the adobe wall 
absorb in -PRON- reflection -PRON- have look at that picture without see -PRON- 
now abruptly -PRON- recognize the original of the photograph and sit up suddenly on the cot 
another picture frame among the cottonwood and light with the moon beam flash out before -PRON- 
this picture on the wall be the same even to the lustrous tress with the fullblown rise tangle among -PRON- 
get to -PRON- foot -PRON- walk around the foot of the cot and snatch the picture from the wall 
-PRON- be frame in cactuswood and -PRON- stare at -PRON- with hard eye 
have griggsby place -PRON- there 
or lacey 
-PRON- could not bring -PRON- to think that either of -PRON- predecessor have be so foolish 
very likely -PRON- be a souvenir of the day when mallory be work the mine 
griggsby and lacey have merely leave -PRON- hang on the wall 
bremerton mutter a fierce imprecation and drive -PRON- fist through the frame 
twist the cactuswood apart -PRON- fling the fragment out of the window 
then -PRON- pick up the picture tear -PRON- in piece and fling the scrap after the wreck of the frame no room here for even a picture of shedemon say bremerton with a scowl 
a fine souvenir for -PRON- to look at 
the eye of a wildcat 
every glance of -PRON- would remind -PRON- of the note that lure lacey into a trap 
some one enter the outer room 
a shuffle footstep cross the floor halt and a thin voice call missa blemton 
-PRON- step out of the sleep apartment and find wun sing hold a cover tray and smile blandly 
what do -PRON- want sing -PRON- ask 
-PRON- blingee chuck 
missa king tellee -PRON- -PRON- sick 
plap -PRON- likee eatee chuck in office huh get -PRON- wrong not sick eat with the man sing 
take the food back to the chuckshanty 
wun face show chagrin and disappointment 
-PRON- waver a moment then turn and shuffle toward the door 
awri -PRON- remark 
ten minute later bremerton sit at the head of a long table in the chuckshanty 
at -PRON- right sit king 
some twenty face not one of the sort to inspire confidence ring the table from king around to left 
boy observe king a little doubtfully this be mr bremerton the new superintendent 
one or two duck -PRON- head 
a few more grufited 
the majority merely stare and say nothing at all say anything if -PRON- hurt say bremerton with a quiet smile 
-PRON- may not be glad to see -PRON- but donot do any guessing until be better acquaint 
-PRON- must be rather pleasant for -PRON- to have a hot meal after a day or two of live on scrap in the dry wash 
if -PRON- have help king keep order in camp wun sing may have remain on the job 
these word seem to startle some of the man 
a few exchange glance but other bend sullenly over -PRON- plate 
be these miner and millman king inquire bremerton casually as -PRON- begin eat 
both be the reply along with the blacksmith and a couple of orehauler 
the rest of the man be keep house in the mexican quarter 
the man eat like famished animal but -PRON- clean -PRON- plate in a hurry and pass out of the shanty wait outside for -PRON- bremerton confide king in a shiver whisper miner and all 
i tell -PRON- -PRON- want to see -PRON- 
if -PRON- donot raise -PRON- pay -PRON- will start a riot not raise -PRON- pay and -PRON- wonot start any riot 
bremerton pick up -PRON- hat from the floor beside -PRON- chair get to -PRON- foot and proceed calmly through the door 
fill with dire foreboding the little cyanid expert arise and follow 
bremerton realize very well that -PRON- first real fight be just ahead of -PRON- 
every man at table have pass under -PRON- keen scrutiny and be mentally tag 
so artfully be -PRON- do that the man -PRON- do not know -PRON- nor even king 
here be a tool there a sneak fomenter of discontent yonder a weak character who run with the big pack 
two have the courage to be openly defiant and but one of this pair be mark for a leader 
so bremerton register that tableful of worker 
on the swiftness and sureness of -PRON- judgment -PRON- base -PRON- plan for deal with the striker 
the man have form -PRON- into a compact group a few yard from the door of the chuckshanty 
-PRON- number have be increase by the arrival of mexican miner from the jacal and quite a formidablegathering await the new superintendent 
-PRON- have be the privilege of all these miner to see late recruit in action 
-PRON- have be afford a test of -PRON- mettle and a wholesome regard for -PRON- power have be engender in -PRON- mind 
but there be a difference between big steve bryden charge with deviltry and aimlessly demoralize the camp and a crowd of underground worker who present a solid front of opposition and be sway by a common cause 
there be courage in number and the miner be eager to see how bremerton would meet this second test 
if -PRON- weaken -PRON- would walk roughshod over -PRON- feeble authority 
bremerton have halt just outside the chuckshanty door to fill and light -PRON- pipe 
-PRON- look like an attempt at bravado a bluff at hide an attack of nerve and some of the striker laugh jeeringly 
king say bremerton who be the man with the ring in -PRON- ear that be chombo gonzale be the murmured response half american and half mexican a foreman among the digger bremerton and a bad man to get stir up 
and who s the one with the scar on -PRON- right cheek 
collin red collin another foreman 
red be on the day shift and chombo look after the night man 
bremerton be positive that chombo and red be the two key to that little difficulty 
if the two foreman be properly take care of the trouble in the underground working would quickly adjust -PRON- 
the superinterident move out toward the man the reason -PRON- man be not get put the ore collin -PRON- ask 
the red head foreman feel flatter at be single out in this way by bremerton 
-PRON- give -PRON- an importance which chombo resent with an ugly flash of the eye 
the boy think -PRON- ainot pay enough say collin 
three dollar a day for ten hour be what -PRON- get and -PRON- demand four 
why 
because -PRON- want -PRON- that s why put in chombo jump clear of the rank and make -PRON- plain that -PRON- be to be consider in the discussion 
bremerton turn on the halfblood and eye -PRON- calmly talk with collin -PRON- remark 
when ready to talk with -PRON- -PRON- will have a chance to relieve -PRON- mind 
-PRON- canot muzzle -PRON- cry chombo say what i please and when i please 
bremerton peer at -PRON- ominously for a moment then swerve -PRON- gaze back to collin 
how much be other mine in this district pay -PRON- miner -PRON- inquire 
two and a half and three be the reply 
then three dollar for ten hour be about the top price in other mine yes but -PRON- worth more to work at the mariquita 
i understand the mariquita be the safe mine in the district no shore necessary and quarter fairly comfortable 
why -PRON- be worth more to work here because say collin the camp have a black name 
for one thing too much shootin now and then that s liable to go wild for another thing deane get -PRON- on a plain steal and -PRON- ought to give up as much as can be gouge out o -PRON- 
as for the shooting collin return bremerton here to look out for that no concern of -PRON- nor of any of the other 
as for the way deane get hold of the property that be none of -PRON- business 
the miner be pay a good price for work here and that s enough 
-PRON- canot crowd -PRON- with no such talk shout chombo excitedly have -PRON- right or well have nothing 
-PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- right gonzale cut in bremerton 
come to the office in ten minute and get -PRON- time 
chombo stare -PRON- lean body crouching and -PRON- ugly little eye blink 
por dio -PRON- grit 
-PRON- canot fire -PRON- 
but i have assert bremerton do -PRON- last stroke of work at the mariquita mine and as soon as -PRON- be pay off -PRON- will take -PRON- out of camp not have a cur of -PRON- stripe hang around here 
chombo have be finger at the breast of -PRON- flannel shirt 
king suddenly utter a cry of warning 
quick as think the right hand have execute a movement backward and forward and from -PRON- tawny finger have shoot a bright gleam of steel 
bremerton fall sidewise 
the gleam graze -PRON- shoulder fly on to the side of the chuck shanty and strike and hang with a steady glitter 
-PRON- be a knife blazing in the sun and the point be embed in the board wall 
the tragic silence that follow the knifethrowing last for a brief moment 
bremerton right -PRON- lift a hand and the stillness be break by the sharp report of a revolver 
the sound fade into a cry of pain and chombo stand reel on -PRON- foot -PRON- left hand clasp -PRON- right arm and a trickle of red ooze from between -PRON- finger 
try that again snap bremerton and be more particular about -PRON- shooting 
king -PRON- add take -PRON- to the office and pay -PRON- off then watch while -PRON- get a good start along the trail 
collin step over this way 
chombo be cow and have nothing to say 
the rest of the miner watch while king trembling and distraught move toward the office with the halfblood stagger behind -PRON- 
the cyanid expert be expect a clash in which bremerton would get far and away the bad of -PRON- 
bremerton however remember how those man have keep to the dry wash and the mexican quarter while big steve be on parade and -PRON- know -PRON- dare not resent -PRON- treatment of chombo 
the redhajre collin move in direction but -PRON- come humbly and obediently as one who have just endure a shock and be slowly recover -PRON- wit 
the superintendent lead -PRON- aside 
how much be -PRON- get as foreman collin inquire bremerton 
three and a half 
the miner be get every cent -PRON- be entitle to 
i guess -PRON- know this mine be barely pay expense and if the pay be raise all around i shall have to call on deane to cover a shortage lookout not our -PRON- lookout not make no mistake on that score 
-PRON- be a man of influence collin 
i can see that 
if -PRON- tell these miner -PRON- be get the limit -PRON- will believe -PRON- 
in -PRON- case willing to make an exception 
if -PRON- can get -PRON- back to work and keep -PRON- at work from now on -PRON- wage will be five dollar a day 
-PRON- need not say anything about that if -PRON- donot want to 
this be the only concession i will make 
if those man donot begin get out ore this afternoon -PRON- can come for -PRON- time this evening 
greed show in narrow eye to have five a day be -PRON- demand 
yes so long as -PRON- keep the gang at work on bremerton but keep -PRON- quiet see that -PRON- go to work 
without pay any further attention to the striker the superintendent walk on to the office 
chombo be move off along the road tie up -PRON- arm with a red cotton handkerchief as -PRON- go 
king -PRON- face pale under -PRON- tan stand in the office door 
let chombo go say -PRON- will raise the deuce among the mexican a clannish lot bremerton 
i wish explain that to -PRON- before 
bremerton laugh softly as -PRON- push past the little cyanid man and drop into the chair in front of the rolltop desk 
would -PRON- put up with chombo after what happen if -PRON- have be in -PRON- place -PRON- ask 
whatever have do would probably have be the wrong thing be the answer 
but -PRON- the devil own job here at the mariquita to know what s good to do in the pinche 
-PRON- strike -PRON- that the first step be to get rid of the troublemaker fire one and bribe another all in the interest of peace 
the ore will begin to come king 
the man be go back to work yes 
well by gracious 
king be look out of the door 
collin seem to be argue with the man and -PRON- be move toward the shafthouse 
how do -PRON- do -PRON- bremerton i make -PRON- worth while for collin to line up on -PRON- side 
the work must go on here 
after get better acquaint with the situation -PRON- may not be necessary to handle collin with glove see about that later 
start the cyanid gang at once 
if -PRON- have any further trouble with -PRON- call -PRON- 
king take fresh heart leave the headquarters adobe and start toward the tank 
-PRON- find -PRON- own worker in a most receptive frame of mind 
not one of -PRON- have any faultto find over the treatment of chombo 
later in the afternoon the teamster be haul ore to the platform at the head of the mill 
the stamp be pound and a batteryman be temporarily look after big part of the work 
only a few hour have pass since the new superintendent have arrive at the demoralized camp and already the work of mining and milling have be resume and the big vat be be load with tailing for another run 
if bremerton can only last king be say to -PRON- well do something here yet 
the night shift take hold of the work in mine and mill when the day crew leave off and bremerton sleep that night with the roar of the stamp fill the valleyten 850pound hammer each fall at the rate of ninetyeight time to the minute beat out gold for ultimate success with the eastern syndicate 
big steve be sleep off -PRON- spree in the bunkhouse the vengeful chombo may be plot somewhere in the hill and the gang under leadership of the mallory be probably make ready for the next move 
none of these thing bother bremerton 
-PRON- be -PRON- part to take -PRON- difficulty as -PRON- come and deal with -PRON- as -PRON- judgment counsel at the moment 
-PRON- have make a good start and for the present that suffice 
a saturday and sunday pass without bring any fresh difficulty for the new superintendent 
the camp which clung to that seared and blight valley like a barnacle to the hulk of some weatherbeaten ship resound with the peaceful activity of mining and milling 
the distant hill be blue and serene and give not the slight hint of harbor enemy who be eager to stalk and slay 
bremerton settle comfortably into the routine of -PRON- work 
-PRON- come and go about the mining property with the perfect nonchalance of one to whom fear and worry be unknown 
bart case otherwise know as smear one of the orehauler remark upon the super calmness and apparent ease of mind 
-PRON- address -PRON- to dutch fre the other teamster 
the fool ainot get sense enough to know -PRON- s a marked man dutch 
vat i care be the passiveresponse a goner in two week i bet -PRON- -PRON- bet i donot care nuther but -PRON- will be plumb interestin to bet and then watch for what happen 
lie -PRON- a dozen bag o smokin -PRON- s still on the job come two week saturday 
i donot get smoke much easy as dot smear a go 
in this manner tenure of life become a gamble among the man 
but smear be unjust 
the superintendent be not a fool 
-PRON- understand thoroughly that -PRON- be gamble with fate 
the stake be large however and -PRON- be cheerfully take a gambler chance 
monday morning two event come to pass 
one bremerton be expect 
the other be a surprise 
directly after breakfast big steve holloweye -PRON- cheek flabby and of a sickly yellow tinge tramp heavily into the office and range -PRON- alongside the desk 
-PRON- emit a rasp cough by way of claim the superintendent attention 
bremerton be study a pencil map of the mariquita property 
-PRON- do not look up until big steve have bring a hamlike fist smase down on the desk top 
think go to wait here all day demand the amalgamator after -PRON- time 
bermerton sit back and regard the huge form fixedly 
oh -PRON- -PRON- be -PRON- -PRON- ask 
yes -PRON- -PRON- and here for -PRON- money 
go to quit the flabby jaw fall open and the sink eye stare that what -PRON- say demand big steve -PRON- tell the boy to break -PRON- to -PRON- that i be fire 
i believe i do but change -PRON- mind 
bryden -PRON- heed an amalgamator merely assess -PRON- for the bunkhouse window and keep -PRON- on if -PRON- have a mind to stay 
big steve drdw -PRON- thick finger across -PRON- head in a puzzled way then think bremerton be afraid to discharge -PRON- -PRON- laugh craftily 
oh stay but i donot pay for no bunkhouse window only fair that -PRON- pay for -PRON- but not insist 
go up to the mill 
the amalgamator tramp out a little more heavily than -PRON- have tramp in 
the new boss be afraid to give -PRON- -PRON- walk paper 
-PRON- look back at the door and chuckle in -PRON- hairy throat 
some time -PRON- would have another chance at bremerton and -PRON- would see which of -PRON- could run that camp 
-PRON- be paw the bruise on -PRON- temple and still chuckle as -PRON- walk to the head of the mill 
king little as -PRON- know about the management of man think that bremerton have make a grave mistake 
at any cost bryden should have be make to go 
among -PRON- the man wonder 
most of -PRON- come to the same conclusion as big steve and think that bremerton be afraid to get rid of the amalgamator 
other who remember chombo and the way bryden have be manhandle at the climax of -PRON- lawlessness could not accept the easy conclusion and be at a loss to understand the queer move 
the superintendent be well content to let the matter rest as -PRON- be so long as -PRON- real reason for keep bryden in the mill be not know 
-PRON- be also chuckle over the incident when a beat of approach hoof draw -PRON- eye to a nearby window 
from the rim of the valley a rider be advance along the trail 
the rider be a woman 
-PRON- sit -PRON- horse manwise and -PRON- graceful figure sway rhythmically as -PRON- gallop face harden 
talk about nerve -PRON- mutter 
i tell -PRON- to keep away from -PRON- yet here -PRON- come 
well -PRON- add grimly when -PRON- s do with this visit shell never make another 
-PRON- start to rise preparatory to leave the office and meet the girl outside 
something hold -PRON- to -PRON- chair however and glue -PRON- eye to the window 
mariquita mallory present a picture beautiful by contrast with that seared and blast valley 
-PRON- be not that -PRON- ride with skill and grace 
-PRON- be the girl -PRON- that add a touch to the ugly environmenta soften exquisite touch which catch and hold eye in spite of -PRON- 
there be a place in the mogollon where the sun set as nowhere else in the whole world 
-PRON- have camp on the spot for a week just to see the flame ball go down watch the crimson and gold fade and then feast -PRON- eye on the purple afterglow 
-PRON- be a far cry from the mogollon to the bitter root range in montana and yet bremerton know of a height in the bitter root where the sun never rise as -PRON- rise there 
in the southwest the brazen shield pop upward from the desert rim as though fling abruptly from a mighty hand 
one moment -PRON- be dawn and the next day 
but over that height in the bitter root -PRON- come slowly fling out streamer that grow and grow until the whole east be fill with orange and yellow and the faint western star be blot out one by one 
bremerton have a soul for the finer thing of life 
-PRON- see beauty where other would pass -PRON- by 
with the eye of an artist -PRON- watch that free galloping figure 
the girl wear a broadbrimmed hat 
-PRON- costume be mannish in other way and yet oddly enough there be that about -PRON- which make -PRON- feminine to the last degree 
bremerton be still stare as -PRON- draw close 
-PRON- eye meet through the dusty window 
-PRON- smile and wave a gauntlete hand 
-PRON- face grow stony with the dark thought that suddenly surge within -PRON- 
-PRON- do not get up and leave the headquarters adobe to meet -PRON- 
whirl the chair to face the door -PRON- watch while -PRON- drop the rein dismount lightly and step across -PRON- threshold 
good morning mr bremerton -PRON- say still smile 
-PRON- note the clear soft brown face the comely roundness of the cheek the arch of the throat the castilian languor of the big dark eye 
moonlight have a magic of -PRON- own but -PRON- could not add to the charm of mariquita mallory 
there in broad day -PRON- be infinitely more attractive than when bremerton have see -PRON- among the cottonwood 
why donot -PRON- say something query the silvery voice 
be i welcome or be i not 
like dagger thrust the word of lacey pierce brain 
when -PRON- smile i find -PRON- danger great 
and mariquita mallory be smile 
i tell -PRON- say bremerton to keep away from -PRON- 
-PRON- couldnot have mean -PRON- though -PRON- laugh not really 
-PRON- drop -PRON- head on one side and look at -PRON- critically in much well shape than when i say -PRON- last -PRON- glad i make -PRON- take silverheel and ride to the hotel 
and -PRON- have never say gracia 
perhaps come to give -PRON- the chance to say that 
then i thank -PRON- for something which i do not look upon as an obligation -PRON- return 
that be gratitude with a string tie to -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh 
but no matter 
when be better acquaint mr bremerton i think -PRON- be go to like -PRON- 
i donot mind say that rather predispose ia -PRON- favor already 
i know what -PRON- hare do herehow -PRON- clip the spur of big steve and wing chombo make a very good beginning mr bremerton 
be -PRON- willing to listen to -PRON- 
if -PRON- be go to say anything against deane the black eye kindle the smile fade and leave the lip stern 
i amjust that -PRON- cut in 
then i be not go to listen to -PRON- 
-PRON- get slowly out of -PRON- chair and approach -PRON- 
miss mallory -PRON- go on -PRON- be a woman a very beautiful woman and -PRON- be not go to make -PRON- forget that i be a man and fight a man fight 
-PRON- be a fight that i shall win 
-PRON- and -PRON- father be enemy 
i have reason to believe that -PRON- fight friend from cover with a reckless disregard of life and consequence 
but -PRON- and -PRON- father be not go to stand in -PRON- way 
take -PRON- advice and leave this part of the country before i bring home to -PRON- something which will call for a penalty 
save yourself while there be time 
there be interest in -PRON- eye and -PRON- do net seem displeased 
-PRON- be take the wrong trail -PRON- return earnestly 
i can explain that to -PRON- if -PRON- will let -PRON- 
-PRON- can not afford to make a mistake mr mistake so hideous and farreaching as this of -PRON- be bind to be 
let -PRON- tell -PRON- not a word 
miss mallory -PRON- must know i could not believe -PRON- 
-PRON- have be talk with mr lacey 
naturally i see -PRON- as soon as i could after reach phoenix 
that be no secret to -PRON- or -PRON- father 
i be spy upon from the moment i leave the train 
otherwise that gang of hoodlum would not have be ready for -PRON- 
-PRON- voice be tinge with bitterness 
-PRON- step back and -PRON- eye begin to glow again 
i have tell -PRON- -PRON- have nothing to do with that villainous attack upon -PRON- -PRON- cry 
-PRON- wave -PRON- hand i have a fair amount of raso and judgment -PRON- reply and -PRON- have best give -PRON- credit for that right from the beginning 
deane will never be able to accomplish anything here -PRON- declare sharply no matter who take up the work for -PRON- 
i should hate to see -PRON- go the way griggsby go or suffer as lacey have suffer 
i want to help -PRON- 
then keep hand off 
call away -PRON- gang 
by do that -PRON- will not only help -PRON- but help -PRON- a good deal more 
-PRON- want peace but not at that price 
if -PRON- be to be war between -PRON- and -PRON- father and -PRON- -PRON- be war of -PRON- own bringing 
call -PRON- what -PRON- will i be here to serve deane 
then -PRON- be serve a scoundrel -PRON- flame 
with a superb dramatic gesture -PRON- pull the gauntlet from -PRON- left hand and fling -PRON- down in front of -PRON- 
-PRON- will bring that back to -PRON- on -PRON- knee before -PRON- be do with the mallory -PRON- cry and whirl and run from the office 
-PRON- pick up the glove curiously wonderingly while the beat of -PRON- horse hoof die swiftly away along the trail that lead out of the valley 
actress mutter bremerton actress to the core 
-PRON- throw the small glove upon the table with an angry gesture 
so i be to take that back to -PRON- on -PRON- knee be i -PRON- picture -PRON- crawl at the foot of mariquita mallory and humbly lift that gage of battle which -PRON- have fling at -PRON- 
a grim smile curl -PRON- lip 
i wonder if -PRON- take -PRON- for a coward or a sentimental fool -PRON- feel as though -PRON- have just come off the stage after take part in a scene from a melodrama 
-PRON- annoyance be keen and -PRON- be surprise a moment later to find -PRON- beside the table and again hold the glove in -PRON- hand 
the girl be twoface in -PRON- own mind there could be no doubt about that 
and yet there be something undeniably attractive about -PRON- something winsome appeal 
-PRON- would have give a month pay to hear the truth in the matter of deal for the mariquita mine 
but from what unprejudiced source be the truth to come 
certainly not from the girl 
lacey have find -PRON- mosli dangerous when -PRON- smile 
bremer ton grind out an exclamation and crush the glove in -PRON- strong finger unlock a drawer of the desk -PRON- drop miss property into -PRON- along with the ball of amalgam and the mend chamois skin and turn the key on the collection 
the gleam ball remind -PRON- that -PRON- have work to do and -PRON- leave the office and mount the low incline that lead to the mill 
a man on the ore platform be shovel rock into the crusher 
the superintendent pick up a piece at random and examine -PRON- 
-PRON- be fairly good ore but not the kind that would make the mariquita worth half a million dollar 
-PRON- toss the sample into the hopper and climb through an opening in the rough board wall and descend three or four step to the ore loft 
the stampstem of the two battery be lift and fall with a force that shake the old mill in every part 
the uproar be deafen so close at hand 
the crusherman be also the orefeeder and while -PRON- be busy on the platform outside bremerton have the oreloft to -PRON- 
make -PRON- way between the battery of dancing stampstem -PRON- halt at the edge of the loft and look down into the body of the mill 
directly beneath -PRON- be the millplate cover with a thin sheet of flow water 
the water be stain with the powdered ore wash away from the stamp and carry through the battery screen to the plate 
the quicksilver on the plate capture the gold from the muddy tide and hold -PRON- fast 
for one reason or another a small quantity of the yellow metal would not catch and the water carry -PRON- out of the mill and away to the tailing pile 
gile the batteryman sit in the aisle between the plate keep a vigilant eye upon the box and smoking as -PRON- watch 
at the rear of the mill big steve lean against a bench tie a fresh cloth over the wide mouth of a bottle of quick 
through the door lead into the engine room bremerton could see the engineer who be -PRON- own fireman heave crooked length of mesquit and paloverde into the firebox 
-PRON- be a scene of peaceful activity and offer not the slight hint of dishonest motive on the part of any of the worker 
and yet if there be a leak and if through -PRON- amalgam be dribble away from deane then more than one man in that mill have a hand in the plot 
bremerton become suddenly aware that big steve have finish tinker with the bottle of quicksilver and be look upward at the edge of the oreloft 
a complacent slightly contemptuous grin crease the flabby face of the amalgamator 
bremerton meet the uplifted glance quietly and big steve drop -PRON- eye and shout something to gile 
the batteryman bound up the step to the loft and begin hang up the stamp 
one by one with a piece of board -PRON- lift each stamp in one of the battery and leave -PRON- hang and idle 
there be a knack in the work and gile prove -PRON- efficiency by do -PRON- deftly and quickly 
the roar of the mill be now decrease by half and bremerton be able to compliment gile without shout at the top of -PRON- voice 
gile be minus an eye but the eye that be leave gleamed with pride as -PRON- listen to the approval of the new superintendent 
if big steve have a confederate bremerton be sure -PRON- could not be gile 
-PRON- have not the air of a man with a guilty conscience 
if there be any fault to be find with gile -PRON- be because -PRON- could not see as much crookedness with one eye as -PRON- may have see with -PRON- normal equipment 
bremerton descend a flight of narrow stair to the body of the mill 
big steve be just come out from under the oreloft where -PRON- have be turn the water off from the battery 
-PRON- pull a stubby whiskbroom from -PRON- pocket and step to the side of the plate 
look over the mill -PRON- ask of bremerton casually 
bremerton nod 
big steve begin pass the broom over the plate in wide vigorous circle 
the amalgam ridge and loosen under the sweeping splint 
big steve lay aside the broom and take a square of rubber from -PRON- coat 
clean up a little ask the new superintendent pleasantly 
get to be the reply stick 
liable to shuff off and ride out with the tailing in chunk 
bremerton know well 
the amalgam be safe enough and there be no need of remove any from the plate 
big steve be lie 
this be part of -PRON- method in lift gold 
-PRON- push the rubber across and across the plate mold two ball of amalgam in -PRON- hand and lay -PRON- aside oh a piece of chamois skin 
after that -PRON- scatter quicksilver from the bottle upon the plate dress the plate down with the broom call to gile to start the stamp again and go into the little amalgamator room off the side of the mill 
bremerton follow and watch 
big steve by manner rather than word seem to consider -PRON- presence an intrusion 
how many time a day do -PRON- make this partial cleanup bryden the superintendent ask 
four 
the amalgamator be gather a ball up in the chamois 
-PRON- big fist clamp down on -PRON- tight and the quick ooze through the skin and drop into a bowl 
two ball each time 
big steve remove the first ball lay -PRON- on a shelf behind -PRON- and then begin squeeze the second ball 
work at the amalgamator back bremerton draw a knife from -PRON- pocket open the blade and with -PRON- point make a cross on the low surface of the first ball of amalgam 
the maneuver be entirely lose on big steve 
i donot reckon well get two ball every partial cleanup this run say the amalgamator suddenly as though -PRON- heavy wit have be struggle with question and -PRON- own answer purty lowgrade compare with what -PRON- be usually 
bremerton stroll out of the little room across the body of the mill through the engineer quarter and around to where king be work at the cyanid tank 
what do bryden do with the amalgam -PRON- take from the plate during the day king 
bremerton inquire 
turn itover to -PRON- when -PRON- knock off work in the afternoon be the reply 
night amalgamator do the same thing in the morning 
why 
oh nothing just get the run of the detail 
after supper this evening bring amalgam to the office 
the little expert eye widen 
-PRON- donot think for a minute that big steve -PRON- begin but the superintendent cut -PRON- short bother about what i think king 
whatever -PRON- be be sure -PRON- be nothing to -PRON- discredit 
just bring up the amalgam this eveningand keep the matter quiet 
bremerton go back to the office and resume -PRON- study of the mariquita property as outline on the map holding comprise several claim all know by the one general name and completely fill the little valley and lap over upon the hill that border -PRON- 
where be the bonanza ledge the golden reef which have dazzle deane while the mine be in the hand of mallory or carruther 
bremerton could have swear that -PRON- be somewhere under that scoriate valley and just as surely as -PRON- be there so surely would -PRON- one day discover -PRON- 
for the rest of the morning and all the afternoon -PRON- smoke and reflect the map under -PRON- eye 
-PRON- next step be to go over the property foot by foot and endeavor to locate the lose vein 
next day -PRON- would begin 
follow supper and after the day man have retire to -PRON- quarter and the night man have go into mine and mill for -PRON- work king come with a canvas bag and roll four ball of amalgam out upon the office table 
be that all big steve turn in bremerton inquire 
certainly reply king with a pained look 
i hope bremerton -PRON- donot think hold out anything on -PRON- 
bosh not -PRON- trail on 
how do the ore now run through the mill compare in value with the ore of the last run -PRON- be almost identically the same so far as value be concern 
and the amount mill be the same yes 
bryden say -PRON- be -PRON- practise to have a partial cleanup four time during -PRON- shift and that generally -PRON- get two ball of amalgam from each plate every time -PRON- take the stuff off 
accord to that there should be sixteen ball of amalgam in this lot 
where be the other twelve king appear astounded 
-PRON- never turn in any more than this bremerton 
probably big steve be a bit hazy yet and didnot realize what -PRON- be say 
or -PRON- may have misunderstood -PRON- 
-PRON- be sober enough and i didnot misunderstand -PRON- 
bremerton look at the ball 
the one -PRON- have mark be not among -PRON- 
well -PRON- add presently of all the brazen steal i ever hear of this be the limit 
-PRON- lean back in -PRON- chair peer into startled face and laugh 
what be the matter with griggsby and lacey that -PRON- do not find the leak in the mill -PRON- go on 
-PRON- be so confoundedly simple that a blind man could locate -PRON- not blind parried king 
-PRON- get past -PRON- bremerton 
and griggsby and lacey worry -PRON- head off about the failure of the cleanup to tally with -PRON- assay figure 
take the amalgam back and put -PRON- in the laboratory safe king say the superintendent quietly explain matter to -PRON- later on 
i know why the bullion doesnot tally with -PRON- assay of the millrun but there be a few other thing i donot know and which i must find out as quickly as possible 
keep -PRON- own counsel get to the bottom of this and something will drop and drop hard before many day a wonder by glory that this mine be do as well as -PRON- be everything consider 
king toqk -PRON- bag of amalgam and go back to the laboratory 
-PRON- be sorely puzzle and halfincline to doubt statement regard the discovery of the leak 
of griggsby bremerton know little but for lacey bremerton cherish the respect which one man of resolution and ability will always feel for another of -PRON- kind 
a square look be all bremerton have need to get measure 
and how have -PRON- be possible for big steve so clumsy and bareface in -PRON- thieving to pull the wool over eye 
the deep of human nature be a tangle of mystery 
why or wherein lacey have fail or what -PRON- may ultimately have accomplish have -PRON- be leave to go on with -PRON- work bremerton could not pretend to guess 
but this matter of big steve and the miss amalgam have yield so readily to investigation that the blindness of predecessor especially of a thing for wonder 
bremerton reflect that -PRON- very first day at the mine have give -PRON- a clue 
that clue have infallibly involve bryden 
this advantage however do not tell the whole story of and carelessness or incompetence 
-PRON- may be think bremerton that big steve work differently when lacey be in charge 
the truth may come out sometime 
i canot believe that lacey be so gullible as the development seem to indicate 
-PRON- nee not bother about lacey 
-PRON- be -PRON- own battle and not -PRON- be fight 
there be work to be do that night 
close and lock the desk -PRON- get up and walk into -PRON- sleeping room 
when -PRON- come out into the main office -PRON- have the automatic pistol in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- examine the weapon for a moment under the light then drop -PRON- into -PRON- pocket 
with a whiff down the lamp chimney -PRON- fill the room with darkness 
a moment later -PRON- pass through the door and turn the key in the lock behind -PRON- 
move on the bunkhouse through the gloom -PRON- take up a position behind a heap of stonesa position from which -PRON- could watch the quarter of the sleep dayshift 
-PRON- want to be at the mill so that -PRON- may test the night amalgamator as -PRON- have test big steve 
that part of -PRON- plan would have to wait for the present 
-PRON- be big trail -PRON- be follow and -PRON- must run -PRON- out 
there be no one abroad in the camp -PRON- that hour 
the night man in the mill and in the underground working have no cause to leave -PRON- post 
the blacksmith have point a supply of drill for those in the level and stope and the teamster have heap the ore platform with plenty of rock for the stamp 
those of the camp who be not on duty sleep while the mill roar and the ore gather at the bottom of the shaft 
bremerton run no risk of discovery 
such risk as there be would come later if the superintendent vague hope be realize 
big steve sure of -PRON- and careless in -PRON- villainy be still the peg upon which bremerton hang -PRON- plan 
where have bryden put those twelve ball of amalgam 
even -PRON- would realize the danger of secrete -PRON- in the bunk house 
-PRON- would not let the night passso the superintendent reason without clear away the evidence of -PRON- crookedness 
the time drag slowly 
a lessened clamor from the mill suggest the hanging up of a battery and the removal of amalgam from the plate 
the night amalgamator be cut -PRON- cloth accord to big pattern and all to the financial loss of deane 
the mariquita mine -PRON- seem be be assail from without and within 
the mallory and -PRON- gang be not sole enemy 
there be traitor in camp with whom there must be a reckoning before a searchlight could be turn on the method of the mallory 
all in good time mutter bremerton grimly and meanwhile one thing at a time 
the old mill crashing and clang gleam yellow through every crack in the rough wall and pour -PRON- smoke straight toward the star be a weird and fascinating object 
-PRON- crouch on the crest of -PRON- little hill like some sulky misshapen devil growl as -PRON- gnash at the ore and wheeze as -PRON- spew the thick fog out of the tall black stack 
bremerton be oddly attract by that ramshackle structure flame and howl in the night 
-PRON- eye shift from the mill to the bunkhouse and back again almost continually 
perhaps -PRON- have be at the rock heap two hour perhaps three when a move blot emerge from the bunkhouse shadow and glide toward the trail that lead out of the valley 
bremerton chuckle 
-PRON- vague hope be be realize 
as the shadowy blur lose -PRON- behind the headquarters adobe and reappear in the starlight beyond -PRON- leave -PRON- hiding place and cautiously follow 
once clear of the ruck of the camp the form from the bunk house be throw into clear prominence 
-PRON- be the form of a large steve without a doubtbeare a sack over -PRON- shoulder 
the amalgamator follow the trail 
bremerton more circumspect dodge from one clump of greasewood to another at the trailside 
at the top of the rise to the south big steve turn directly out of the road and move westward along the ridge 
bremerton keep below the crest of the uplift 
at a distance -PRON- may have be of a quarter of a mile fte man with the bag descend the opposite slope and pass from sight 
the millclamor be hush so that the shrill cry of the coyote could be hear 
creep thing to which bremerton give no heed scuttle out of -PRON- way 
-PRON- look down from the ridgetop upon a narrow level of desert at the farther side of which be more hill and the mouth of an arroyo 
big steve be lay a straight course for the arroyo 
-PRON- pause once to emit a whistle 
the signal be answer 
against the arroyo black as a pocket a point of light flare flutter and die out 
bremerton crawl over the top of the ridge and with redouble caution let -PRON- down the slope 
here and there on the level be bit of chaparral 
from screen to screen of bush -PRON- move and finally be as close to the mouth of the arroyo as -PRON- could go without invite discovery 
-PRON- hear a mumble of word 
big steve be talk with some one whom -PRON- have meet 
a match be light and the speck of fire hang over a pipe between the amalgamator lip 
hardly a breath of air be stirring and that faint glow do not waver 
big steve sit on a boulder 
the figure beside -PRON- bent to pick up the bag -PRON- have carry from the bunkhouse 
the face of the stooping form come within the dim circle of light from the match 
-PRON- be face and the light glitter on the ring in -PRON- ear 
there be a sling of white cloth suspend from the neck and in the fold of -PRON- -PRON- right hand rest 
there could not be the least doubt regard the identity of chombo 
here be positive evidence of conspiracy 
chombo have assist big steve in -PRON- stealing while employ at the mine and -PRON- be still active now that -PRON- have be discharge 
how many of those rough worker at the mine be honest and loyal to deane 
the scene at the mouth of the arroyo suggest the question to bremerton and -PRON- be in a mood to distrust every man in the camp except king 
where doubledealing be possible owe to laxity of those in control nearly every one would be find with a hand in -PRON- 
-PRON- be up to bremerton to make the thieve impossible 
the first step to that end would be accomplish by make objectlesson of big steve and chombo 
when the two in the mouth of the arroyo separate the amalgamator return toward the mill by the way -PRON- have come and the halfblood fade into the dark of the narrow valley 
bremerton allow big steve to go -PRON- way and press forward into the arroyo 
-PRON- object be to discover if -PRON- could where the steal amalgam be take by chombo 
in this -PRON- fail 
chombo have vanish completely and to prowl aimlessly around in an attempt to locate -PRON- may have result in disaster to the superintendent 
an examination of the arroyo could wait until the follow day 
the heavy gloom make a night search bad than useless 
bremerton start back towards the ridge 
as -PRON- be climb the slope a rider gallop along the ridgetop come suddenly from nowhere and fling along in the direction of the trail 
-PRON- jaw clamp hard and -PRON- brow wrinkle as -PRON- stand and gaze 
the rider be cut sharply in silhouette against the light background of the night sky 
that swinge graceful figure the broadbrimmed hat the fluttering hair -PRON- could not be mistake 
-PRON- be mariquita mallory 
the girl be swallow up in the shadow as suddenly as -PRON- have appear 
bremerton mutter angrily 
why be -PRON- there 
have -PRON- a part in that scoundrelly work at the mill 
be there really but one set of enemy fight deane 
be the foe within the camp link in deviltry with those outside 
be -PRON- all work together to drive deane out of that mining district somewhere deep down in soul lurk a sense of disappointment 
-PRON- realize that -PRON- have be hope against hope that mariquita mallory in the face of all that have happen may be as inoncent of actual wrongdoing as -PRON- have profess to be 
but evidence be pile upon evidence to prove the contrary 
big steve the thief have meet chombo another thief in the hill 
the girl be there not present at the meeting but handily by to take from chombo the bag of steal amalgam 
quite likely the bag lie across the saddle in front of -PRON- as -PRON- gallop away not make a fool of -PRON- as -PRON- do of lacey bremerton growl 
-PRON- have say that before 
why be -PRON- harp on -PRON- do -PRON- feel -PRON- slip and be -PRON- unwittingly make a stand against an event altogether possible -PRON- spirit be up in arm against -PRON- 
while climb the slope and stride along the ridge -PRON- thought circle around way and mean for gather both mallory in the same snare -PRON- be prepare for big steve and chombo 
if -PRON- s in this -PRON- vow shell pay for -PRON- 
i warn -PRON- 
whatever the cost these foe of be to be put out of business 
-PRON- canot wipe -PRON- out before have -PRON- way with -PRON- 
when -PRON- have get back to the headquarters adobe and have lock -PRON- in the stuffy room -PRON- lpoke at -PRON- watch and find that -PRON- be two oclock 
-PRON- work for the next day and for many day to follow be cut out for -PRON- 
-PRON- be time -PRON- be in bed 
-PRON- thought however give -PRON- no rest 
-PRON- fumble for -PRON- key and start to open the drawer contain the ball of amalgam and the other thing and angrily catch -PRON- up short 
what do i want to look at that stuff for -PRON- mentally ask -PRON- 
and -PRON- have no logical answer for the question 
the mallory be with the amalgam thief 
otherwise how -PRON- be that -PRON- find that first ball of amalgam on the scene of -PRON- struggle by the phoenix town ditch as guilty as the rst of -PRON- -PRON- mutter savagely 
with that conclusion firmly in mind -PRON- dismiss the whole subject of -PRON- night work and go to bed 
the entrance of michael ohara upon the gloomy scene of this chronicle be excellently time for bremerton 
a sordid struggle inspire by the greed of man blacken by treachery and tragedy and with a plaintive note of injustice to some one somewhere ring through -PRON- all need the touch of an ohara to renew faith in the fitness of thing as -PRON- be 
-PRON- should have be play on with a rollick quickstep but not too wild not too clash 
a nocturne perhaps in twofour time dreamy in place but with here and there a laugh at the world for -PRON- folly 
mostly the string if -PRON- please with a lilting of the woodwind and once or twice but no more the drum and the brass 
that be the spirit of the ohara the soul of -PRON- 
but there be trouble in set -PRON- to music 
for this reason may bp -PRON- choose personally to express -PRON- through -PRON- own flute 
-PRON- come suddenly 
-PRON- be a habit -PRON- have 
and gently and unobtrusively 
that be another habit 
bremerton have first discover -PRON- in the desert 
-PRON- burro be dead -PRON- food and water be go 
with -PRON- back to a sahuara cactus -PRON- be wait for the and try to breathe out -PRON- soul through the flute with the harp that once thro hall 
for two year after that -PRON- and bremerton be inseparable 
-PRON- find gold those two but -PRON- be the gold in each other heart 
-PRON- struggle -PRON- starve -PRON- break rock and rip hole in the flinty earth and -PRON- sfettle down at last to sink a shaft on the light of hope -PRON- only find 
but the light go out and hope die and -PRON- have a hole in the ground for -PRON- pain 
between two day ohara decamp leave a note and sixteen silver dollar for bremerton 
the note say briefly fight for -PRON- die for -PRON- but all hell canot make -PRON- saddle -PRON- longer with the curse luck of the ohara 
the sixteen dollar be all -PRON- have in the world 
and when -PRON- go -PRON- be afoot leave the burro and all the meager grubpack for bremerton 
high and low bremerton search for -PRON- but whenever ohara efface -PRON- -PRON- do -PRON- thoroughly 
no trace of the irishman could bremerton find 
for many a month after that heart be sore 
ohara have come into -PRON- life shortly after deane have go out of -PRON- and the loss be a blow 
the friendship of the right man for another who be right be one of the great gift of god 
and -PRON- never end here or hereafter 
on the morning after -PRON- night work in the hill bremerton be waken by soft music outside -PRON- door 
thrill -PRON- sit up on the cot and greedily drink in the melody 
-PRON- be happy but -PRON- be not precipitate 
the way of the man outside be know to -PRON- and -PRON- defer to -PRON- 
to the strain of mollie -PRON- get up deliberately and put on -PRON- clothe 
when -PRON- be quite ready -PRON- go into the outer office and unlocked and open the door 
a hatless man with red hair sit on -PRON- doorstep play a flute 
not by the wild flight of fancy could the man be call handsome 
-PRON- nose be short and -PRON- upper lip be long 
-PRON- eye be a washedout blue and while one of -PRON- look straight at -PRON- the other survey the landscape 
-PRON- be lean and long double up as -PRON- be -PRON- knee all but touch -PRON- chin -PRON- length be painfully in evidence 
but -PRON- be comfortably clothe 
in fact -PRON- whole appearance radiate prosperity 
-PRON- be not an effusive prosperity but an ample amount for creature comfort 
with one eye fix on bremerton and the other look around the corner of the adobe -PRON- continue -PRON- playing 
bremerton take a chair and sit down 
after mollie have be play up and down and across with trill and variation and the chorus three time repeat the player take the flute from -PRON- lip and push -PRON- into a new green cloth bag 
come in ohara say bremerton calmly 
i owe -PRON- sixteen dollar 
divil a cent do -PRON- owe -PRON- and the wide mouth of ohara open in a roar of laughter owe -PRON- a thousand this minute bremerton and no one have be able to see -PRON- for dust in the rush make look for -PRON- change a little a very little for ohara or never have venture to run onto -PRON- trail 
the debt -PRON- mind could have be cancel by post 
-PRON- pull -PRON- up from the step shake -PRON- angular frame and come into the little room 
twist a package of banknote out of an inside pocket -PRON- fling -PRON- to bremerton 
well by glory 
bremerton stare at the money as though hypnotize 
a thousand plunk say ohara grinning 
count -PRON- 
where have -PRON- make a raise mike 
and why in blaze be i entitle to a share in -PRON- so -PRON- will be lookin a gift horse in the mouth will -PRON- 
shame on -PRON- for tryin to dodge good money at the hand of a friend no safe be crackin no strongarm work in -PRON- at all at all 
och -PRON- boy -PRON- could never guess 
-PRON- think -PRON- a limestone stringer with not much under the grassroot but heartache and disappointment 
sure -PRON- never make a big mistake 
lee the old light have make good to the chune of a couple of thousand 
by the same token -PRON- half be there in that wad 
now will -PRON- behave bremerton look incredulous 
ohara hasten to explain 
this be the way of -PRON- and on -PRON- soul -PRON- canot be more surprised than i be when the miraculous truth hit -PRON- in the face 
tis six month go since i be near that spot where -PRON- live and labor and lose faith 
i go to see that beautiful hole over which -PRON- would crack -PRON- back and will -PRON- believe -PRON- -PRON- be deep than when -PRON- leave -PRON- and a bit of a crosscut have be run and six man be takin out ore that would have make -PRON- eye bulge 
the claim have be jump so help -PRON- 
and why not with no assessment work do for a year 
oh the fool -PRON- be not to be thinkin of that crosscut 
bremerton be dumfounde 
and yet -PRON- nee not have be 
occasionally such thing be happen in the mining country and as long as man dig for gold -PRON- will continue to happen 
but the two thousand say bremerton 
if the claim be jump i donot see why the newcomer have to buy -PRON- 
tis there the laugh come in proceed ohara crinkle -PRON- cross eye 
-PRON- be in -PRON- name do -PRON- mind and -PRON- have a quitclaim to half 
-PRON- location be file but -PRON- hadnot take the trouble to file -PRON- quitclaim 
-PRON- know of -PRON- those claimjumper and -PRON- imagine trouble where none could be make and give -PRON- the two thousand to sheer off 
i get -PRON- without passin -PRON- hat and -PRON- wrap -PRON- long leg around the chair and nearly choke with mirth 
never before for bremerton have fortune go to such length to give -PRON- a bit of a smile 
-PRON- appreciate the humor of -PRON- yet if -PRON- have not the wild joy of ohara would have force a laugh out of sheer sympathy 
the good part of -PRON- mike say bremerton be that luck have turn for -PRON- 
faith be the response the long lane be bind to have a turn 
not be able to turn for the bad -PRON- have to be for the well 
as soon as i have the money in -PRON- jean i set off look for -PRON- 
the divil own chase -PRON- lead -PRON- 
here -PRON- be grubstakin for a month in the hill and there -PRON- would come in with -PRON- chuck go and the burro no more than skin and bone 
maybe -PRON- be carpenter work -PRON- do or clerkin in a store or drivin stage until -PRON- would amass enough capital for another pasear in the wild 
och lad but -PRON- be a hard one to come up with when the gold fever in -PRON- and the heart of -PRON- cryin for the lonesome trail 
but i keep along until i find the place where -PRON- skin -PRON- of -PRON- property to buy a ticket to denver 
then i know and the smile face go long and the fade mismatched eye grow dull 
i know by -PRON- soul that -PRON- would knuckle under to deane 
ohara have no use for deane 
an honest irishman no matter if -PRON- be out at elbow will think of -PRON- codscience twice for every once -PRON- mention a pirate 
only continue ohara i wish to high heaven get to -PRON- with the thousand in time 
for what have -PRON- sell -PRON- lee 
a paragraph in the paper let -PRON- know -PRON- be here and that deane have hire -PRON- to lay out this property butterside up 
what be the price 
a grim smile flicker across the other lean face 
if -PRON- think sell -PRON- birthright for a mess of pottage mike say hd -PRON- will have to guess again 
now listen go to tell -PRON- something confide to no other live soul and i want -PRON- to get -PRON- straight 
-PRON- go into -PRON- arrangement with deane exhaustively 
not only that but -PRON- follow -PRON- own trail down from denver to the hospital with lacey to the cottonwood by the phoenix town canal to the mine and at last to the mouth of the arroyo 
bremerton could speak to ohara as to no one else 
-PRON- belief -PRON- hope -PRON- intention be all lay naked before the eye of -PRON- friend 
-PRON- have no need to tell of -PRON- confidence in deane for that tingle in every word of -PRON- talk 
but -PRON- do declare -PRON- black suspicion of mariquita mallory and there be a false note strike again and again as -PRON- emphasize -PRON- conviction 
ohara love to drink in the music but -PRON- hate the discord 
man dear but -PRON- be out of chune and -PRON- wabble -PRON- red head gruesomely 
the girl be a fiend of course 
lacey say so 
-PRON- have judgment and penetration although to be sure -PRON- couldnot find the hole in the mill where the amalgam run out but that be simple and eye be all for complication human nature and bitter true that -PRON- would rather take a week hunt for something than travel cross lot for an hour and pick -PRON- up 
but if there be any doubt o the girl duplicity -PRON- settle -PRON- 
beyond a shadow of surmise in the twice -PRON- talk with -PRON- and the once -PRON- see -PRON- gallopin through the night -PRON- smoke out -PRON- true character 
oh the black trick -PRON- play on -PRON- there by the town ditch 
force -PRON- horse on -PRON- at the muzzle of a gunmade -PRON- ride when -PRON- could not walkbullied -PRON- into a comfortable trip back to -PRON- hotel 
troth in hope to be spare till i can get even with -PRON- for that 
-PRON- be bad though when -PRON- come here and want to be friend 
-PRON- be right in not let -PRON- speak of the mine or give -PRON- the why s and wherefore of the sorrywork that have be go on here 
-PRON- may have explode some dynamite under that trust -PRON- have in deane 
then what 
no matter the glove 
begorry and a wry smile come into the homely face like to take -PRON- back to -PRON- -PRON- and tell -PRON- a few thing 
bremerton a mind to camp down on -PRON- for a while 
-PRON- need -PRON- 
but be no deadhead work 
but -PRON- donot understand i understand more than -PRON- think 
before long there will be more broken head in these diggin than there ever be at a donnybrook fair 
for one of -PRON- disposition the outlook be distinctly allurin go to work here 
where be -PRON- go to work laugh bremerton 
in the mill 
about tomorrow -PRON- will be need a new amalgamator and the man for the job 
then that s settle and i could ask nothing well 
there go the gong at the chuckshanty mike 
come on to breakfast 
bremerton plan a surprise for big steve and chombo 
the law be to be invoke against -PRON- and the case relentlessly press 
such a move would constitute an object lesson for all the enemy of deane 
king be send to phoenix directly after breakfast tocommunicate plan to the sheriff 
as a cover to the real nature of -PRON- errand -PRON- be give out in camp that -PRON- have go to town for a couple of carboy of sulphuric acid 
in look over the odd and end of equipment in the office the superintendent have find an old darklantern 
-PRON- have the lantern clean and fill by wun sing and make ready against the night operation 
at ten oclock in the evening bremerton and ohara quietly slip out of camp and make -PRON- way along the trail to the top of the ridge 
three man be wait for -PRON- on the the sheriff and two deputy mighty glad say ransom after a few minute talk that something be go to be do out here 
thug and pluguglie have be do about as -PRON- please at the mariquita and the law have have blame little to work on 
sneak coyote have cover theft track well and even when griggsby go i couldnot lie hold of the first thing in the shape of a clue 
the coroner verdict that -PRON- meet -PRON- death at the hand of some person or person unknown still stand a blot on the good name of this county and this mining district but now with -PRON- help in hope to accomplish something be a cleanup ransom declare bremerton shortly and -PRON- can gamble on that 
where do -PRON- leave -PRON- horse get a buckboard back a way on the trail 
-PRON- understand the scheme 
captain bryden and the halfbreed be only part of -PRON- in addition to that -PRON- have get to recover the steal amalgam 
i get -PRON- 
maybe -PRON- idea will work and maybe -PRON- wonot but well try -PRON- out 
all five of -PRON- push into the chaparral at the trailside 
the night wind rustle the and as -PRON- rise and fall the muttering of the mill rise and fall with -PRON- 
the clearcut star gleam in the sky like scatter diamond and only beneath -PRON- the trail be a lone whitish blur and the ridgetop a shadowy stretch of brushclump and mass boulder 
an hour drag and that whisper ransom in ear a horse and come from the wrong direction make a move 
the galloping come close and a horse and rider pause within a dozen foot of those in the chaparral 
rise in the stirrup the rider look over into the valley for a moment peer and listen then with a sharp turn to the right be off and out of sight along the ridge 
a woman by thunder murmur the amazed sheriff 
-PRON- swear under -PRON- breath 
be there a woman mix up in this bremerton -PRON- demand 
how do i know who s mix up in -PRON- return the superintendent fretfully 
there be other besides big steve and chombo i suppose and maybe tonight will give -PRON- a line on -PRON- 
with one hand -PRON- touch ohara 
the latter be sit comfortably -PRON- long knee hunch to -PRON- chin and -PRON- hand clasp around -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh softly but say not a word 
the tide of sentiment have set in toward mariquita mallory 
this weakness of the girl for nightriding and at time when the night be bedevil with treachery have in timely fashion be bring home to ohara 
bremerton expect surprise and consternation 
-PRON- expectation have be meet with a laugh that express unreasoning unshaken faith 
another hour drag and then through the deep rolling diapason of the mill a slide foot whisper in the sand 
a dark figure be climb out of the valley a sack over the shoulder 
get ready say bremerton to the sheriff 
a tense moment follow 
ransom take something from -PRON- pocket and rise crouch to -PRON- foot 
bremerton bring the lantern around in front of -PRON- and make ready to open the shutter 
the figure win to the top of the trail and turn toward the length of the ridge 
in that moment the shutter click and an eye of light stream from the bush 
big steve whirl with a gasp in -PRON- throat 
the bag drop and -PRON- stand blink in the glare 
then a hand sweep under -PRON- coat toward -PRON- hip 
none of that 
the bush crash and ransom land heavily in the trail get -PRON- number bryden and here where -PRON- lose 
bring that hand back in front of -PRON- 
the hand come back but with steel glitter in the lanternlight 
the amalgamator at bay would have make a fight of -PRON- even against such odd long body shoot clear of the chaparral as though propel by spring and with the swiftness of lightning -PRON- catch the steel and tear -PRON- away 
that pull -PRON- fang for -PRON- remark ohara step back 
-PRON- have no sense at all or -PRON- would know when -PRON- s trap this puff big steve stoppin -PRON- 
the sheriff reply that official briskly 
andy 
both deputy be out of the bush by then and andy hurry to the prisoner with a pair of handcuff 
big steve show -PRON- mettle and -PRON- desperation and begin a wild fight against the inevitable 
leave -PRON- to -PRON- say the fluteplayer and catch the thick hairy wrist 
with a strength no one but bremerton know -PRON- possess ohara slowly but surely bring the hand of the prisoner together in front of -PRON- be in a rush with those comealong andy caution bremerton want -PRON- coat do -PRON- mind another one to be deal with 
the word cause big steve to remember chombo and -PRON- lift a roar of warning 
the other deputy come up behind and slap a hand over the prisoner mouth 
off with the coat say bremerton bring the light closer 
i donot think the yell cause any harm 
with the sheriff help the coat be strip from the amalgamator shoulder and the handcuff snap in place 
bremerton put on the coat over -PRON- flannel shirt and pick up a black slouch hat that lie in the trail

follow the route the amalgamator have take the previous night bremerton descend the slope cross the little plateau and pause only to give the whistle signal 
the signal be answer and -PRON- advance swiftly to the arroyos mouth 
a figure disentangle -PRON- from the gloom as the superintendent drop the bag and seat -PRON- on a boulder a stealthy figure that crouch forward only to halt warily and at a safe distance 
steve question a voice 
yes answer bremerton 
the word be lose in a report and fire flash in the mouth of the arroyo 
bremerton gasp sway and slowly sink downward at the side of the boulder 
a wild laugh burst from chombo 
-PRON- form straighten and -PRON- plunge forward 
ransom and ohara could be hear stumble across the flat coming uncertainly but at speed each with -PRON- own foreboding about bremerton 
chombo bent and grab for the bag of amalgam 
in the same instant arm go around -PRON-

chombo know something be wrong -PRON- answer and some one be handily by to pick -PRON- off 
but the shot go wide 
och -PRON- schemer chuckle ohara mightily relieve 
-PRON- drop and the breed rush for the sack 
then -PRON- nail -PRON- 
-PRON- be well do for i think in -PRON- soul -PRON- have follow griggsby

-PRON- may help -PRON- though if -PRON- make a clean breast of this 
there be a brief silence during which chombo seem to be think

-PRON- hurt -PRON- arm 
ransom grope through clothe for weapon confiscate a knife and finally get to -PRON- foot 
the lantern ohara say -PRON- 
the yellow gleam fix -PRON- upon the form of chombo and undef the threaten muzzle of the sheriff gun -PRON- struggle to -PRON- foot 
-PRON- do this say chombo between -PRON- tooth 
-PRON- black eye gleam with hate turn on bremerton 
some day i be go to kill -PRON- do -PRON- come sharply from ransom 
well think of -PRON- chombo be some year before -PRON- be footloose and able to camp on anybodys trail 
what about that loot the halfblood swore softly and shift -PRON- arm to a more comfortable position in the sling 
what can i do -PRON- complain fiercely

-PRON- spawn of the pit cry ohara 
i throw -PRON- back in -PRON- tooth too ready to tell when -PRON- swear -PRON- wouldnot 
the truth be not in -PRON- 
if -PRON- would lie about one thing ransom -PRON- would lie about two and i would not go a step with -PRON- to find this amalgam give -PRON- a chance to make good answer the sheriff 
if -PRON- s get any black scheme in -PRON- mind hell pay for -PRON- 
come with -PRON- that s all say chombo surlily 
if -PRON- find lyin -PRON- can make -PRON- pay play fair observed bremerton be go 
with ohara on one side of -PRON- and ransom on the other chombo lead the searcher into the arroyo 
for several minute -PRON- stumble through the darkness then climb a steep slope traverse the length of a hogback plunge downward into blackness again and come finally into a small canon 
the wall be not high and from somewhere ahead could be hear a drip drip of water fall into a pool 
a turn in the gulch bring -PRON- out on a flat cover with a sparse growth of oak 
-PRON- be now close to the dripping water and a small house could be see under the shadow of the tree 
oak flat remark ransom i know the place 
the only water this side the mariquita 
which way chombo the adobe barn back of the house say the prisoner 
the small house be dark and still 
twenty yard away back up against the rugged gulch wall stand the barn 
a corral fence with okatea stake braid with wire be close to the barn 
as -PRON- pass the corral a horse whinny 
must be some one at home comment bremerton 
if so return ohara -PRON- be in bed like honest folk 
-PRON- word for -PRON- this halfbreed be muy nialo not be trust -PRON- under oath 
wait snarl the prisoner 
-PRON- conduct -PRON- around the side of the adobe barn then kick -PRON- foot against the base of the wall 
-PRON- foot strike wood and there be a hollow resonant sound 
take away that board and look hissed chombo 
then tell -PRON- a liar 
bremerton drop to -PRON- knee and while the beam of light play over the base of the adobe wall -PRON- remove a square section of board 
a cavity be reveal 
-PRON- reach into -PRON- and fish up a ball of amalgam the size of -PRON- fist 
tally one for the breed mutter ransom right bremerton -PRON- s play fair 
how much of the stuff be in the cache 
with both hand bremerton begin scoop out the amalgam 
the heap grow into a small mountain of frost silver before -PRON- bring out the last ball and rise to -PRON- foot 
as i figure -PRON- say -PRON- the mariquita mill have be systematically rob since the day of griggsby not a tenth of the stealing in that pile 
figure some more come the sneering voice of the halfblood 
would all the amalgam be leave in that hole under the wall or would -PRON- be take away when there be enough to make -PRON- worth while retort run into bar and sell quick light footfall be hear at that moment and the man turn 
ohara shift the gleam of the lantern and the slender erect figure of mariquita mallory be etch clearly against the somber background of the oak 
-PRON- come steadily bravely on -PRON- widebrimmed hat push back and the rebellious tress twist about -PRON- forehead and throat 
-PRON- face be set in resolute line 
a quirt swing from -PRON- slender wrist and -PRON- horse could be see dimly in the distance 
this be hardly a time for visitor say -PRON- 
may i ask what -PRON- be do 
ohara step forward 
with a courtly gesture -PRON- remove -PRON- hat 
miss mariquita mallory -PRON- inquire in a voice as soft as any note of -PRON- flute

the girl stand like a statue 
-PRON- gaze pass from ohara encounter bremerton then fall on the sheriff and finally rest on the pile of amalgam 
ohara throw the light from point to point as the wide wonder eye travel over the oddly assorted group 
that amalgam be find there under the wall the word be quick and breathless and -PRON- end in what be almost a sob 
a gloved hand arise to the white throat and the finger close 
be sure miss mallory say ohara hastily -PRON- have nothing to fear at all 
why why should i have anything to fear -PRON- know -PRON- i think miss mallory speak up ransom with a touch of sternness the sheriff

the excitement the frenzy go out of the girl in an instant 
-PRON- arm fall at -PRON- side and -PRON- body seemingly spentjjy that gust of passion droop limply forward 
mr bremerton -PRON- murmur sadly some day -PRON- will be sorry for all -PRON- suspicion some day if i can bear this long enough to make -PRON- clear to -PRON- 
if that amalgam be steal from the mariquita mill and bring here -PRON- be do for a purpose 
that purpose be to bring nearer the jail with which -PRON- so gallantly threaten -PRON- that night by the town canal 
this home -PRON- wave -PRON- hand about -PRON- be -PRON- home and -PRON- mud hovelthe only place -PRON- can call -PRON- own 
-PRON- should have bettersome day -PRON- will have well if -PRON- get justice and can live and fight till -PRON- come 
do what -PRON- can mr bremerton -PRON- say scornfully to cheat -PRON- out of -PRON- right but never again take the word of a halfbreed thief against mariquita mallory 
a dead silence ensue when the girl have finish 
ransom be dumfounde bremerton amazed and ohara humble and apologetic 
-PRON- be the irishman who first venture to speak 
miss mallory what -PRON- say go to the heart of all of -PRON- 
but believe -PRON- -PRON- have not the right of -PRON- 
when the halfbreed say what -PRON- do i give -PRON- the lie 
and -PRON- donot know the heart of -PRON- yet 
some day as -PRON- say -PRON- will come into -PRON- right and on that day -PRON- will know lee bremerton as i know -PRON- 
a smile play about the girl full lip 
-PRON- be irish -PRON- ask 
all but the brogue -PRON- laugh 
-PRON- father be irish and -PRON- mother be mexican and -PRON- think i didnot guess faith -PRON- name be enough to tell -PRON- that 
-PRON- be a friend of mr friend that doesnot tell the half of -PRON- 
-PRON- save -PRON- in the desert and for two year -PRON- thirst and starve together 
such a life do not make for friend do -PRON- mind but for brother 
then show mr bremerton how wrong -PRON- be in -PRON- dealing with the mallory 
that be the great kindness -PRON- can ever do himand -PRON- 
-PRON- pull away -PRON- glove and reach out -PRON- right hand 
ohara accept -PRON- with a knightly courtesy 
trust -PRON- for that -PRON- answer 
mariquita once more face the sheriff 
take that amalgam away with -PRON- say -PRON- 
-PRON- will find oresack in the barn 
with that -PRON- leave -PRON- return to -PRON- horse and lead the animal toward the corral 
-PRON- watch -PRON- until -PRON- have pass from sight 
so that s old girl murmur ransom in a bewilder tone 
hang if i ever know -PRON- have such a temper 
temper counter ohara 
not a bit of -PRON- spirit fine and high and nothing else 
-PRON- ought to be on the stage growl bremerton shed make a hit as an emotional actress 
but let sidetrack the heroic and get away 
give -PRON- the lantern ohara 
ohara give -PRON- the light without a word and -PRON- go into the adobe barn to get the oresack 
in due course dutch fre buy bring out from town and duly deliver to smear case one dozen bag of smoking tobacco 
i make no holler say fre but i donot get a fair shake 
whyever didnot -PRON- inquire case 
dot irish feller mit der crooked eye come around since der bet 
-PRON- be a masgot for bremerton 
i bet nod against masgot 
-PRON- be vat beat -PRON- oudt of dot smokin yah so 
case chuckle and as -PRON- walk away load with tribute -PRON- add insult to injury with this gem of song -PRON- take the irish to beat the dutch 
what the irish canot accomplish -PRON- donot amount to much 
with -PRON- scientific trick -PRON- can never fool the can bet -PRON- life the irish beat the dutch 
for the first time since deane have acquire the mariquita mine the property be more than pay expense 
this be a matter for congratulation although -PRON- be not go far enough 
-PRON- be no showing on which to effect a sale of the mine for half a million dollar task be to bring the output of bullion up to the bonanza point set by mallory 
-PRON- have unearth a file of bullion certificate and these -PRON- have compare with assay of rock from the lead on which the miner be now at work 
the ore be different 
mallory have not work out a rich pocket on the present vein 
-PRON- have dig in virgin and bonanza ground 
but where be -PRON- 
while the camp be be reorganize and shake down to a commercially profitable basis big steve and chombo have come to trial for the larceny of the bullion and have be sentence to the penitentiary 
between arrest and conviction a remarkably short time have intervene 
and the sentence impose be strangely inadequate sinister influence have be at work in behalf of big steve and chombo 
a lawyer of prominence have manage -PRON- case but -PRON- have hasten rather than check the law course 
as soon as -PRON- client be finally behind the bar -PRON- be know that -PRON- have begin disburse small sum as pension to the immediate family of the two man 
bremerton have hope that one or both of the thief would make a confession involve more of enemy 
in this -PRON- be disappoint 
-PRON- hold -PRON- peace and take -PRON- medicine and bremerton feel sure that somebody have make -PRON- worth -PRON- while 
indirectly -PRON- seem certain that the convict man be part of the strong and desperate organization that be fight deane 
with this murderous and persistent gang bremerton could not but connect the mallory 
absolute proof however be lack 
while bremerton gophere and hunt for clue of the lose vein and pester -PRON- mind with doubt and theory in other direction ohara cheerfully tinker with the millplate and in offhour play -PRON- flute 
apparently the irishman have not a care in the world 
now and then -PRON- would drop in on the night amalgamator in the small hour of the morning exchange small talk with -PRON- and covertly watch for dishonest work 
but if the amalgamator on the night shift have be crook the fate of big steve have induce -PRON- to reform 
this which come nearer be a care for ohara than anything else settle -PRON- comfortably and leave nothing on -PRON- mind 
in second month at the mine at the close of a monday afternoon a mexican boy ride up to the office and ask for the superintendent 
bremerton be just come in from a day fruitless quest for the lose vein and the boy hand -PRON- a note offer no explanation one way or the other and immediately gallop away 
bremerton read the note and smile queerly 
after supper that evening while ohara be get out -PRON- flute the superintendent halt the music for a talk 
what be -PRON- do to carry out -PRON- part of the agreement mike 
bremerton inquire suddenly 
the other look up blankly a rolling stone i be and utterly irresponsible say -PRON- a contract to such a man 
but -PRON- have -PRON- curious lee 
what agreement be in -PRON- mind the one -PRON- make with mariquita mallory 
-PRON- be to show -PRON- how wrong i be in -PRON- estimate of -PRON- and -PRON- father 
week have go and -PRON- have not make a move ohara trill a few note then lay the flute on -PRON- knee 
sure -PRON- be an easy job and i see -PRON- from the start makin no wrong estimate 
what -PRON- say bremerton be one thing and what -PRON- believe in that case be another entirely not give -PRON- credit for be honest give -PRON- credit for try hard to be loyal to deane 
-PRON- may as well thrash this out mike 
-PRON- attitude toward mariquita mallory be so different from -PRON- that -PRON- bother -PRON- 
tis not different at all and the flute go to -PRON- lip while -PRON- run the scale no use argue with an irishman 
then why be -PRON- bother quizzing wrinkle show around the twinkling cross eye 
bremerton frown and reach for a pigeonhole of -PRON- desk 
remove a fold paper -PRON- hand -PRON- to ohara and ask -PRON- to read -PRON- say ohara give something handsome if such an invite could come to -PRON- 
do lacey accept the note from mariquita mallory explain bremerton sharply that lure lacey into a trap 
on the way to make -PRON- call -PRON- be shoot from cover 
only yesterday -PRON- leave the phoenix hospital almost a wreck of a man to go east and get back -PRON- strength 
now wasnot that the divil own luck -PRON- couldnot be shoot cornin back could -PRON- not at all 
-PRON- have to get -PRON- go and that rob -PRON- of a few blessed moment with the only woman ever see who s distinctly worth a man time 
for -PRON- now count -PRON- a pleasure to run the gantlet of a dozen ambush just for a smile from the girl 
at that moment bremerton be near to be out of patience with -PRON- friend than at any time since -PRON- have know -PRON- 
jump to -PRON- foot -PRON- stride up and down the office 
calmly the irishman blow into the flute and out of -PRON- come softly the air of mollie -PRON- be always a favorite in -PRON- more serious moment 
bremerton sit down again and wait until -PRON- have finish 
ohara take -PRON- time and a smile come to -PRON- lip as -PRON- again favor -PRON- friend with -PRON- attention 
-PRON- fur be stand lee -PRON- remark and i think -PRON- would calm -PRON- 
-PRON- canot stay mad at -PRON- and -PRON- know -PRON- 
let matter drift 
before long -PRON- will be come around in this mallory business something else for -PRON- to read say bremerton hand -PRON- another note 
ohara take the paper and read mr bremerton -PRON- must listen to -PRON- now 
-PRON- be in danger and i can help -PRON- 
come to -PRON- house in the morning at eight 
-PRON- will not be sorry if -PRON- do for this time trust mariquita mallory 
och the luck -PRON- have when -PRON- donot deserve -PRON- comment ohara -PRON- faded eye glow 
the poor taste -PRON- have send for -PRON- when -PRON- may have send for -PRON- 
-PRON- sigh heavily 
but a redheade freak who canot look at a girl with both eye at once mustnot expect too much in this world 
bremerton i congratulate -PRON- 
the superintendent lean forward and stay the hand that be reach for the flute 
cut that out for now say -PRON- sharply 
do -PRON- understand this perfectly go and the girl will be get -PRON- out of one danger only to draw -PRON- into another 
for the peace of -PRON- soul rather face a battery of mask gun than come company front with those big black eye the danger for -PRON- and know -PRON- all along talk like an idiot growl bremerton impatiently 
this be a lure just as the note to lacey be a lure -PRON- see -PRON- -PRON- say that murmur ohara and call -PRON- an idiot 
-PRON- poor man -PRON- add -PRON- be not -PRON- one thing i can see 
of course go of course -PRON- be 
if for nothing more than to convince -PRON- that -PRON- be waste a lot of sentiment on a scheming treacherous woman continue bremerton hotly 
-PRON- canot take that back say ohara dryly but not say -PRON- again 
with -PRON- -PRON- will go no further put the girl to the test -PRON- that will be put to the test not mariquita mallory 
if an attack be make on -PRON- while ride to oak flat -PRON- will be convince that the girl be not what -PRON- would have -PRON- think 
nothing of the kind be convince that enemy have watch -PRON- chance to catch -PRON- away from home 
even two coincidence wouldnot spell the truth 
be reasonable implore bremerton let -PRON- heart run away with -PRON- head 
and donot -PRON- lee bremerton let the cursed plot of deane run away with -PRON- sense of right and justice 
make -PRON- call 
if -PRON- be shoot out of -PRON- saddle and bring back here with the breath go out of -PRON- body -PRON- will not be the girl go hunting 
mark that 
whom would -PRON- hunt query the superintendent curiously 
why the fiend who would cause that girl to bear the brunt of -PRON- own black deed 
lee -PRON- begin -PRON- work here with a mistaken idea 
-PRON- can make have see -PRON- do -PRON- before 
-PRON- go out of -PRON- way to think wrong of a woman 
-PRON- come hard for -PRON- to think -PRON- and deep down in -PRON- heart -PRON- be not convince but money have work -PRON- spell and -PRON- have get to do something to earn -PRON- 
deane 
deane the man who have build -PRON- up by knife -PRON- friend 
-PRON- have pile high -PRON- dollar by blast the hope of other by backstabbe by scheme that wonot bear the light by no more of that mike talk fair to -PRON- face and hit -PRON- with a club from behind 
a robber so black that big steve and chombo be white as the saint by comparison 
and -PRON- have hook youbecause i be slow in get around with thatthousand 
can i ever forgive -PRON- for that 
the washedout blue eye snap the red hair seem to stand on head and the blood rush into the thin cheek 
the irishman half rise and shake a clenched fist at the ceiling 
-PRON- save -PRON- life once say bremerton -PRON- bronze face almost white and -PRON- wouldnot play anything but square with -PRON- 
square sneer ohara 
-PRON- have forget how to be square 
when -PRON- take the wrong turn of the trail -PRON- go moneymad 
play square with -PRON- 
lee -PRON- be a tool 
on6 of these day -PRON- will find -PRON- out and then blackguard that -PRON- be i tremble for silas deane 
without speak a word bremerton turn on -PRON- heel and strode from the office 
the note of the flute follow -PRON- through the door 
ohara be right attitude toward mariquita mallory be one of distrust not of absolute conviction 
at the first -PRON- be sure that the note to lacey be a part of the tragic plot against -PRON- 
now -PRON- be uncertain 
this second note revive -PRON- suspicion of the girl motive 
-PRON- offer a chance to test -PRON- character and as such -PRON- welcome -PRON- 
if -PRON- be set upon while proceed to the mallory then -PRON- would know the girl for what -PRON- be 
in -PRON- own mind there would be no coincidence about -PRON- 
for -PRON- perhaps there be grave risk in the undertaking 
-PRON- think little of that 
on an open trail in broad day -PRON- could use -PRON- eye and -PRON- wit and lurk foe would not easily get the well of -PRON- 
the mill be sound the sixoclock whistle as -PRON- ride out of camp 
the stamp clatter to a standstill and from rise ground bremerton look back and see the night shift emerge from mine and mill and the day shift straggle from bunkhouse and mexican quarter 
boom 
boom come muffled explosion out of the distance 
-PRON- be the blast fire by the miner so that level and shaft may be clear of fume before the other gang go underground 
from six to seven at the beginning and the end of each day the work close down for breakfast and supper and the changing of shift 
bremerton spur over the top of the trail 
for a quarter of a mile -PRON- would follow the main road to town then turn into a branch that lead to the canon and oak flat 
the rough country contiguous to the valley have be pile with monument file on and now belong to deane as part of the mariquita property 
bremerton have comb those adjacent upland in -PRON- search for the lose vein and have find no blowout or other promising indication 
-PRON- believe the outlying claim comprise merely a barrier against those who would poach on the mariquita preserve 
-PRON- be think less of that morning errand than of the mysterious bonanza ledge when -PRON- reach the point where -PRON- be to leave the main trail 
an swale cross the road and -PRON- course lie through the swale and toward the west 
a road runner dart out of the bush on the right 
the horse give a startled snort and rear backward 
at the same moment a sharp report rang out on the left and bremerton feel the wind of a bullet against -PRON- face 
on so small a thing may a man life hang 
the roadrunner have startle the horse and the horse have rear and at just that moment the shot have be launch from the brush 
have head be incline a foot forward deane would have be look for another superintendent 
this flash through brain 
but -PRON- have not much time for thought 
the lurch of -PRON- mount have loosen the cinch and the saddle turn 
-PRON- make a wild effort to keep on the horse back 
find this to -PRON- impossible as the shot have still further alarmed tfie horse and set -PRON- to plunge -PRON- try to kick free of the stirrup and strike the ground on -PRON- foot 
one foot be free but the other become entangled 
-PRON- fall heavily in the trail on -PRON- shoulder kick desperately to get clear of the cling stirrup 
the horse frenzy by the unusual turn of event continue to rear and fle -PRON- heel 
the outlook be dark indeed for bremerton then for -PRON- be in imminent danger of be trample to death 
a hoarse shout come from the chap arral 
a crushing of brush be hear at hajf a dozen widely separate point 
this of course be all lose upon bremerton for the more immi nent danger claim -PRON- attention 
suddenly the horse whirl to the right and run into the swale drag -PRON- rider over the rough ground and through the greasewood 
bremerton be bump against stone lash with brushbranche and threaten at every leap with the pound ironshod heel 
-PRON- feel -PRON- sense go and surround object slide past -PRON- in a confused blur 
dimly -PRON- be aware of beating hoof close at handnot those of -PRON- own runaway horse but other 
one thought rise paramount in -PRON- befog mind 
-PRON- have -PRON- 
at last those mysterious force -PRON- have defy be close in on theirquarry the horse stop 
some one dismount 
the next moment -PRON- release foot fall and -PRON- body lie prone upon the ground 
there follow a preliminary trampling of the earth end in a tattoo of hoof that fade into silence along the swale 
mr bremerton 
-PRON- realize that -PRON- horse be gope that another horse stand quietly a few yard from where -PRON- lie and that on -PRON- knee beside -PRON- be mariquita mallory 
-PRON- sit up bewilder 
bring on the rest of the gang -PRON- say presently 
-PRON- feel for -PRON- automatic revolver but -PRON- have be lose out of -PRON- pocket 
there be nothing leave with which to defend -PRON- and -PRON- must take whatever be to come 
can -PRON- get up 
the girl put out -PRON- hand 
with -PRON- assistance -PRON- gain -PRON- foot 
where be the rest of -PRON- -PRON- demand glare in the direction of the trail 
-PRON- be behind -PRON- answer and crowd -PRON- close 
come -PRON- must hurry 
crowd ns close -PRON- return 
-PRON- may not believe -PRON- -PRON- say with a trace of bitterness but -PRON- would not spare -PRON- any more than -PRON- would -PRON- have to trust -PRON- now mr bremerton and -PRON- must pull -PRON- together and do -PRON- good 
-PRON- straighten and peer anxiously up and down the swale then -PRON- bend -PRON- head to listen 
what -PRON- see or hear be beyond bremerton but a look of wild alarm cross -PRON- pallid face 
quick -PRON- whisper and seize -PRON- arm convulsively 
-PRON- yield -PRON- passively into -PRON- hand 
whether -PRON- be a friend or foe make little difference just then 
-PRON- know -PRON- danger could not be more acute either way 
leave -PRON- horse mariquita pull -PRON- toward the bank of the swale 
there -PRON- drop to -PRON- knee and begin climb through the thick brush 
the quirt trail from -PRON- wrist by a leather loop get in -PRON- way 
-PRON- jerk -PRON- from -PRON- arm and fling -PRON- aside 
-PRON- follow -PRON- on all four up and up through the mask of the chaparral 
-PRON- brain be clear andhe wonder why -PRON- have abandon -PRON- horsewhy -PRON- have not both mount the animal and gallop away 
if -PRON- be really try to befriend -PRON- that would have seem like the safe course 
-PRON- could not hear a sound in the depth of the scrub behind -PRON- 
what have become of the man who have fire at -PRON- at the fork of the trail perhaps the murderous scoundrel have be frighten away by the failure of -PRON- plan perhaps the girl be be carry away by -PRON- fearsshe be a woman and -PRON- have not much faith in a woman resourcefulness at such a time 
in spite of -PRON- doubt however -PRON- make no protest 
on hand and knee -PRON- crawl after the girl to the top of the bank 
-PRON- would have speak then but -PRON- look at -PRON- wildly and place a finger on -PRON- lip 
-PRON- start to rise but -PRON- pull -PRON- down 
crack 
from somewhere in the swale come the bark of a firearm 
a bullet snap through the bush 
the golden echo have hardly die into silence before -PRON- be take up by another report 
this come from farther up the swale but the snarl lead strike at the same point that have draw the first shot 
then again and again from widely vary location below bullet be hurl at that one spot on the top of the bank 
the girl face be white and yet -PRON- seem to have -PRON- well in hand nothing else for -PRON- -PRON- whisper through tense lip more to -PRON- than to bremerton -PRON- must take to the blind -PRON- only chance 
-PRON- turn and once more begin worm -PRON- way onward 
at a distance of fifty foot the ground break abruptly into a sheer descent ahead of -PRON- 
-PRON- look into a narrow steepwalle gully 
bremerton have see that gully before 
on the opposite side outlying holding embrace the upanddown wall and the last monument of the mariquita property be heap at the wall base get to get down there mr bremerton declare the girl 
i can do -PRON- -PRON- answer but -PRON- i can go wherever -PRON- can let that worry -PRON- have -PRON- bottle up once be in the gully 
i know the place and -PRON- a veritable cul de sac 
-PRON- can get into -PRON- here but -PRON- canot get out once be down there -PRON- can take -PRON- time pick -PRON- off 
no and -PRON- speak with an effort i know something about this that -PRON- donot 
-PRON- begin let -PRON- over the rim 
wait -PRON- interpose go first and help -PRON- 
after be drag by -PRON- horse as -PRON- be -PRON- may have all -PRON- can do to help -PRON- all over that -PRON- answer and lower -PRON- to a protrude stone in the cliff face 
come after -PRON- closely -PRON- add use to this rockclimbing 
foot by foot -PRON- descend a project rock here or a weatherworn seam in the wall there afford -PRON- treacherous round in the cliff ladder 
the girl be clearheade and steady and at this bremerton marvel 
surely -PRON- have know very little about -PRON- up to that moment 
time after time -PRON- reach upward to place the small foot in a place of comparative safety and occasionally -PRON- lift -PRON- voice in warning where the handhold be weak or the foothold crumble 
when -PRON- near the foot of the wall lead once more begin to fly 
the marksman keep -PRON- in hiding dropshoote from an angle that make -PRON- work more unnerving than dangerous 
bullet strike against granite and glanced singing into space 
a few ranged upward and inward and one spend ball pass through sleeve 
now where ask bremerton as -PRON- and the girl stand side by side at the foot of the wall 
-PRON- voice be even almost colorless strain glance rest on -PRON- face curiously 
-PRON- be a good deal of a man mr some thing say -PRON- 
this be no time for foolish talk -PRON- answer sharply 
nor for foolish action perhaps such as the one i be about to do 
this way and be quick 
-PRON- run across the boulderstrewn bed of the gully and gain a screen of chaparral on the other side 
-PRON- follow 
the fire strangely enough have slacken and the dash be entirely successful 
come in here call the girl from a granite overhang 
-PRON- step under the rock 
in the half gloom a hand reach -PRON- and lead -PRON- on and on into blank darkness 
as -PRON- stumble forward -PRON- reach out with -PRON- free hand and run -PRON- gropingly over a ragged wall 
wonder grip -PRON- 
-PRON- be in a tunnel 
hard on the heel of wonder come a flash of hope and exultation 
a woman sacrifice 
who run this tunnel into the gully wall miss mallory 
bremerton in -PRON- excitement over this new discovery forget the danger that have drive -PRON- into that subterranean refuge 
-PRON- voice ring joyfully between the narrow wall and the girl must have realize the trend of -PRON- thought 
-PRON- father and -PRON- answer quietly dig and blast -PRON- way into the heart of the hill ground 
this be the lose vein the bonanza ledge be hunt for 
i have an idea all the time that -PRON- and -PRON- father know where -PRON- wasthat -PRON- must know where -PRON- be 
what do -PRON- do with the waste -PRON- take out of the bore 
no one could look into the gully and even suspect that mining operation have be go on 
why do -PRON- mask the work 
why have -PRON- make a secret of -PRON- 
-PRON- have drop -PRON- hand 
almost fiercely -PRON- voice leap at -PRON- i have to bring -PRON- here in order to save -PRON- life 
be -PRON- go to take advantage of the sacrifice and wreck the mallory completely carruther know nothing about this vein 
i find -PRON- 
-PRON- only weapon against deane all -PRON- could use in defend -PRON- right have be this secret of the hill 
be -PRON- go to turn that weapon against ns 
under the torrent of those hot word something like shame rise in -PRON- breast 
-PRON- have save -PRON- life at the expense of a golden secret carefully guard 
be -PRON- more indebted to -PRON- who have rescue -PRON- than to deane -PRON- employer 
mariquita interpret -PRON- silence as favor -PRON- interest and -PRON- father 
-PRON- voice lose some of -PRON- sharpness as -PRON- go on 
-PRON- be safe here 
the wretch in the gully will not show themselvesthey never do 
-PRON- plot and kill from cover 
once see -PRON- could be run to earth identify and make to suffer from what -PRON- have do and be do 
eager as -PRON- be to destroy -PRON- mr bremerton -PRON- be more eager to keep -PRON- out of any entanglement with the law 
-PRON- know how hard the law would deal with -PRON- on account 
just a moment 
there be candle and match here and i want -PRON- to see everything and to know everything 
i think -PRON- will listen to -PRON- now 
-PRON- could hear -PRON- move around near the opposite wall 
presently -PRON- come back to -PRON- 
a light may be see from the overhang say -PRON- so -PRON- will not make one until -PRON- round the angle of the wall a little way ahead 
come 
-PRON- take -PRON- hand as before and lead -PRON- forward and around a sharp turn 
half a dozen step farther and -PRON- halt again 
first mariquita observe let -PRON- tell -PRON- how i happen to be in the swale 
i donot have to tell -PRON- what happen to latey in answer a similar note of mine 
-PRON- think evil of -PRON- in that matter 
-PRON- be in -PRON- mind this morning know -PRON- be threaten and that a blow may fall while -PRON- be on the way to the canon 
but i have to ask -PRON- to come to -PRON- for -PRON- have make -PRON- impossible for -PRON- to come to the mine 
i be anxious to learn whether -PRON- have faith enough in -PRON- whether -PRON- friend could persuade youto answer that note in person 
i didnot need persuasion -PRON- break in grimly for i should have come anyway 
i want to test youto find out whether a move would be make against -PRON- as -PRON- have be make against lacey in the same situation 
so when that shot be fire at the fork in the trail -PRON- consider the case against -PRON- prove 
i have no time to consider anything 
the saddle turn and i drop in the road 
but never mind that miss mallory 
go on 
i have be watch the gang as well as i could and i know -PRON- be watch -PRON- and only wait for a chance to catch -PRON- off -PRON- guard 
since -PRON- send big steve and chombo to prison -PRON- skulking foe have be hot for reprisal 
-PRON- realize that i be try to help -PRON- and -PRON- would have blacken -PRON- motive in -PRON- eye if -PRON- could 
chombo try -PRON- that night -PRON- find the amalgam 
the stuff be hide in that place so that if discover -PRON- could not but think ill of the mallory 
-PRON- voice catch in -PRON- throat and -PRON- quick breathing there in the underground quiet smote on -PRON- ear 
i be anxious about -PRON- mr bremerton -PRON- resume steady -PRON- for i realize only too well what -PRON- would think if anything go wrong on -PRON- way to the canon 
i ride to the swale by a roundabout bourse and be wait for -PRON- to bear 
i see what happen 
as -PRON- horse charge past -PRON- drag -PRON- by a stirrup i turn -PRON- own horse and follow 
the thing i do not expect but fear in -PRON- heart have come to pass 
if -PRON- have be kill -PRON- friend ohara would have blame -PRON- but if i could do something to save -PRON- then -PRON- and ohara would be compel to believe in -PRON- 
that be why i stop -PRON- horse and that be why i make the sacrifice in bring -PRON- here 
-PRON- wrong ohara 
nothing could make -PRON- suspect -PRON- of treachery 
-PRON- hasnot the same responsibility at the mine that i have bremerton add dryly 
-PRON- wasnot -PRON- life particularly but -PRON- own good name that concern -PRON- think that 
deane have rob -PRON- and all -PRON- hope be to effect some settlement withhim on the score of -PRON- lose vein 
but -PRON- have no heart no conscience 
the more -PRON- be harrassed and the hard the work at the mine be make for -PRON- the nearer -PRON- may be force to a compromise with -PRON- 
but the slay the shooting the robbingoh in the name of justice do not connect -PRON- father and -PRON- with that 
who have do -PRON- all other 
i donot know who -PRON- be and i donot know the motive back of -PRON- for -PRON- work in the dark 
if -PRON- could discover who be pay the relative of big steve and chombo a pension -PRON- would get a clue that may help unravel the mystery not go into that now 
-PRON- father and i be not to be identify with those wretch 
-PRON- be to make sure of that once and for all 
-PRON- father know -PRON- be come to phoenix 
-PRON- go to town as soon as -PRON- hear and -PRON- follow -PRON- about and take the first opportunity to warn -PRON- 
no work be go on at the mariquita mine and i think i can not be positivethat there be some from there concern in that attack on -PRON- by the town canal 
remember the ball of amalgam and how -PRON- have ultimately lead to the unmasking of big steve bremerton make no doubt that the girl be right 
the conclusion be interesting but lead to no substantial result 
-PRON- father after -PRON- leave -PRON- that night in phoenix the girl pursue hear the rush of man among the cottonwood 
oh the pity that the attack should have happen then of all time so that blame could be lay at -PRON- father door 
-PRON- come at once and tell -PRON- and i ride to the canal to see how matter have fare with -PRON- 
for -PRON- trouble i have only hard word and cruel suspicion 
that be what hurt a womansome woman hurt -PRON- 
i want -PRON- to understand the situation mr bremerton and i smother -PRON- pride and ride to the mine for a talk with -PRON- 
-PRON- would have be well if i have stay away 
under the strain of all this wrong and injustice -PRON- father health be break 
-PRON- have fight for year with misfortune and just at the moment when success be within -PRON- grasp -PRON- be snatch away by deane treacherously deliberately cruelly 
if -PRON- have do what -PRON- should that night in phoenix father would have send the police to the town canal 
but -PRON- be not -PRON- and when -PRON- have bring word to -PRON- -PRON- be too late soon as -PRON- come back home from town i begin try to learn something about these other who be fight deane 
night after night i have hover about the mine 
i see big steve go to thtf arroyo and meet chombo but i could not follow chombo and find what -PRON- do with the amalgam 
the night of the capture i be close to chombo when the shot be fire at -PRON- 
i could not see the man who fire but i hear -PRON- scramble away 
i take after -PRON- but -PRON- evade -PRON- in the pitchy darkness of the arroyo 
when i get back to oak flat i find -PRON- there and ohara and the sheriff 
can -PRON- put -PRON- in -PRON- place and realize how i feel to hear from the sheriff that chombo accuse -PRON- of shoot at -PRON- 
i have just wear -PRON- out try to run down that skulking cowardly scoundrel 
a feeling of sympathy for the girl have grow in breast as -PRON- talk 
-PRON- be glad of the dark and that -PRON- could not see -PRON- face 
have there be anything more to impress -PRON- in -PRON- favor -PRON- sense of duty toward deane would surely have suffer 
no doubt i have be mistake say bremerton slowly 
after -PRON- interview with lacey though the mistake be natural 
i be willing to set aside -PRON- past difference miss mallory and -PRON- can make common cause against these prowling devil who shoot from ambush and rob and work under cover 
do -PRON- want -PRON- that way what will be the end of -PRON- work -PRON- ask doubtfully 
-PRON- will drive -PRON- out -PRON- answer resolutely and bring to punishment those who murder griggsby and send lacey to the hospital 
but apart from that -PRON- persist 
why with the bonanza vein to draw on for ore i will equal the show -PRON- and -PRON- father make at the mariquita 
deane will unload the property for half a million and and -PRON- cut in icily -PRON- will receive five hundred dollar a month for -PRON- work and a bonus of ten thousand dollar 
the half million belong by right to -PRON- father and -PRON- 
-PRON- go to deane and -PRON- getwhat bremerton have no answer for that 
-PRON- knowledge stop short of the mallory and -PRON- socalle right 
deane be -PRON- friend -PRON- employer 
when bremerton give -PRON- word about anything -PRON- as as good as -PRON- bond 
-PRON- have nothing to say murmured mariquita 
now that -PRON- have listen so far mr bremerton -PRON- must hear the rest of -PRON- 
first though -PRON- will be well to go to the overhang and reconnoiter 
i do not imagine that the man in the gully have the slight idea what have become of -PRON- but -PRON- be just as well to be on the safe side 
if -PRON- will wait here for a few minute do the reconnoitering -PRON- cut in and grope -PRON- way back around the turn and to the mouth of the tunnel 
at the lip of the overhang -PRON- could hear the distant growling of the stampmill 
-PRON- be faint however and if there have be any stirring about in the gully -PRON- would have be aware of -PRON- 
-PRON- be impossible for -PRON- either to see or to hear anything of -PRON- mysterious enemy 
when -PRON- return -PRON- find that the girl have light a candle 
the light fall over -PRON- face bring out and accentuate each softly mold line 
-PRON- large eye meet -PRON- wistfully appealingly as -PRON- put the candle in -PRON- hand and point to the breast of the level 
there -PRON- whisper 
look at the veinthe one i foundthe one -PRON- father and i developedthe ledge that make the mariquita mine worth half a million 
examine -PRON- mr bremerton 
-PRON- walk to the breast brush -PRON- hand over the surface of the rock hold the candle close and bend forward 
another moment and -PRON- stagger back astound scarcely breathe 
-PRON- knewnone betterthe full worth of what -PRON- see 
prospecting be -PRON- trade and often -PRON- have hornspoone sample of crush ore and find value that would have turn many a man head 
but never have -PRON- see anything to compare with the indication of that bonanza lead 
a rich say mariquita passively 
rich -PRON- gasp 
well -PRON- the rich thing this side of the comstock lode 
and the vein a foot wide and a true fissure 
such vein increase in value as -PRON- go down on -PRON- 
what will the assay be a hundred foot or a thousand foot below aa word fail -PRON- 
-PRON- voice trail off into wonder silence not much outcrop on top of the hill -PRON- say -PRON- even tone contrast queerly with -PRON- hoarse vehement word 
i pick up just one insignificant piece of float and trail the clue until i have uncover a mere stringer 
but that stringer be so rich that father and i cover up the opening and obliterate every sign of mineral 
every man at the mine be discharge and not one suspect a strike 
i guess -PRON- be wrong in do that 
the theory be correct but -PRON- do not work out well 
i work side by side with father dig that tunnel 
-PRON- be month at -PRON- and -PRON- guard every move -PRON- make 
the waste from the tunnel -PRON- pitch into a hole beside the overhang and cover -PRON- with brush 
when -PRON- begin to take out ore -PRON- haul -PRON- in sack up the side of the gully 
father fire and run the engine at the mill and i stand over the plate dose -PRON- with quick run a day then have a cleanup and spend a week get out more ore hardly believe mr bremerton the way the amalgam ridge -PRON- up on those plate 
the gold tumble out of the sieve and bank up so high in front of the batteryboxe that wehad to scrape -PRON- away every halfhour 
father be like a boy 
twenty year drop from -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- skip back and forth between the engineroom and the battery and every once in a while -PRON- would stop to pat -PRON- on the shoulder and laugh girl be make 
a palace and all the big thing in life for -PRON- way out there in the east 
at last so help -PRON- the 
mallory be come into -PRON- own 
but -PRON- be too quick with -PRON- hurrah 
-PRON- have spend so much time ion the tunnel that -PRON- couldnot -PRON- and mill enough ore to pay for the property 
into the mild depth of -PRON- eye come a swift change 
-PRON- clutch -PRON- hand and wring -PRON- convulsively 
ah the sorry way luck turn for -PRON- -PRON- whisper 
with more than enough gold in sight to pay carruther a thousand time over -PRON- have to go to deane for a paltry twenty thousand dollar 
-PRON- put -PRON- off play fast and loose with -PRON- until finally -PRON- have the mine and -PRON- be bad off than nothing 
-PRON- eye snap fire and -PRON- hand fall at -PRON- side and clench fiercely 
a blackerhearte scoundrel never live than silas deane 
bremerton have be give time to calm -PRON- 
-PRON- study the flame of the candle for a moment then fix the candle on a ledge in dripping of -PRON- own grease 
-PRON- be to tell -PRON- all about that now say -PRON- 
why not sit down and be comfortable not a comfortable subjectfor -PRON- -PRON- answer stand in front of -PRON- as -PRON- drop on a boulder by the hang wall get ahead of -PRON- 6tory too and start at the middle where i should have go back to the beginning 
-PRON- be not always the mariquita mine mr bremerton 
when carruther find -PRON- and consolidate the several claim -PRON- be know as the apache 
carruther build the mill and lay the pipeline and open up the vein -PRON- be now work on 
-PRON- have already discover that the vein be very ordinary and leave no more than a small margin of profit 
-PRON- look pretty good to father and -PRON- though 
an uncle in the east have die and leave -PRON- two thousand dollar 
one christmas day father take over the property at twentyfive thousand dollar 
carruther be to have -PRON- two thousand dollar down and three thousand dollar more the first year 
then on the next christmas be at noon the time expiredif the remain twenty thousand dollar be not pay the mine be to revert at once to carruther a mining man and -PRON- know how such deal go 
-PRON- pay expense and by careful planning get out of the old vein enough more to give carruther -PRON- five thousand and complete the first payment 
then in midsummer i discover the new lead tell -PRON- about that 
father and i be afraid that -PRON- know what -PRON- have find would discover some way to void -PRON- contract 
if -PRON- have be less suspicious and have keep some of the man to help run in the tunnel -PRON- could have take out and mill ten time more than -PRON- need to pay carruther 
but -PRON- be afraid of -PRON- 
for that reason -PRON- do the work -PRON- and keep -PRON- golden secret lock up in -PRON- own heart 
early december come and -PRON- have nothing for carruther 
then in an unlucky moment father think of deane 
mariquita pause fight down -PRON- rise emotion and presently continue 
father have a passing acquaintance with thisthis mining king as -PRON- call -PRON- 
-PRON- believe that -PRON- could go to denver show deane -PRON- bullion certificate and get from -PRON- as much money as -PRON- need in exchange for a tenth interest in the property 
so -PRON- go to denver be more than friendlythat be always -PRON- way tell when -PRON- s plan deviltry 
-PRON- listen to father take -PRON- bullion certificate verify -PRON- in course of a week and then ask how -PRON- could make such a good showing with a tenstamp mill on tendollar rock 
father do not let -PRON- into -PRON- secret but tell -PRON- pointblank that after the get the claim hard and fast and -PRON- be in for a tenth interest -PRON- would be give further light take care of -PRON- mallory say deane 
those be -PRON- very word mr bremerton take care of -PRON- mallory and donot -PRON- lose any sleep 
day after day -PRON- put -PRON- off reassure -PRON- lure -PRON- on with false hope until the 25th of december come 
carruther be in denver at the time 
-PRON- surprise -PRON- once with deane on one of -PRON- many trip to office 
oh -PRON- be blind blind not to have suspect trickery 
but father have faith in deane up till ten oclock that last day 
jthe girl voice quiver in -PRON- throat -PRON- be then that deane throw off -PRON- mask and curtly tell father -PRON- have ho money for -PRON- and that -PRON- would have to look elsewhere for -PRON- 
look elsewhere 
where could -PRON- look 
-PRON- know no one in denver but deane and carruther 
i think father would go crazy 
-PRON- grab deane by the throat and i believe -PRON- would have kill -PRON- if i hadnot interfere 
some clerk come and throw father out of that gild den of crookedness and -PRON- spend hour try to get the money for carruther 
the girl choke and walk up and down the level for a few moment to get control of -PRON- 
meanwhile -PRON- finish carruther have transfer the mariquita mine to deane for fifty thousand dollar 
do -PRON- know what this friend of your do 
-PRON- eye flame and -PRON- lean toward bremerton with -PRON- face set and strained and -PRON- breath come in short labor gasp 
this friend of -PRON- this man who hire -PRON- to come down here and make a showing with the mine that would enable -PRON- to sell -PRON- for half a million this mean falsehearted scoundrel have be browbeat carruther all the while -PRON- have be feed -PRON- father with hope and promise 
-PRON- tell carruther that the mariquita mine be enormously rich and -PRON- declare that if carruther would not give -PRON- an option on -PRON- for fifty thousand dollar -PRON- would give -PRON- father the money to get -PRON- for half that sum 
carruther could take -PRON- choice 
so far as carruther be concern i do not think -PRON- be much well than deane 
-PRON- be the case of two rogue pluck an honest old man 
carruther must have squirm 
for -PRON- -PRON- be either let the -PRON- go to father or to deane a mine worth half a million and for which the good -PRON- could get be a paltry fifty thousand 
there be high word in that fine office but deane have to give in 
father and i come back to phoenix and all -PRON- have in the world be a few tool a few head of horsesand the secret of that rich vein 
so long as that new vein could not be discover the mariquita mine be worth little 
already -PRON- work in the gully have be well hide but -PRON- go by night and make the hiding more secure 
poor griggsby hunt until -PRON- be wear out and lacey too search high and low 
but neither of -PRON- suspect the wall of that of contain mineral 
and -PRON- have no well luck mr bremerton 
there be absolutely no mineral indication in or around the gully 
the original claim there be only an outpost for the mariquita property anyway 
sadness almost despair creep into -PRON- voice as -PRON- proceed father and i go back to -PRON- little ranch in the canon 
-PRON- watch the development over in the valley

after a time -PRON- discover that other and secret enemy be fight deane hamper -PRON- operation in every conceivable way and seek to drive -PRON- out of the district 
night after night while griggsby be here the pipeline be cut thieving must have be go on in the mill too for the bullion output be barely enough for expense the mill be set on fire and barely save there be discontent among the man then on top of all this griggsby worry about the lose vein and -PRON- inability to make good

i send lacey a note and ask -PRON- to come to -PRON- ranch and hear some important news 
-PRON- have distrust -PRON- all along 
for all that though -PRON- start to come to -PRON- and and those other seize that as -PRON- chance to strike 
afterward -PRON- appear 
some one in denver a man in officeinforme -PRON- about that 
-PRON- know what -PRON- have do and try to do since -PRON- reach the mine mr bremerton 
this lose lead have be -PRON- only weapon in a hard hopeless oneside fight against a powerful and influential man 
now sob rush to lip as -PRON- say -PRON- -PRON- know -PRON- secret

be wemy father and to any consideration at -PRON- hand 
i have tell -PRON- the truth 
be -PRON- for -PRON- or against -PRON- 
there in the dimly light level -PRON- face and manner grow all appealing 
with tear run down -PRON- cheek -PRON- reach out -PRON- hand in mute supplication eye wander to the breast of the level to that footwide streak of bonanza ore which the girl and -PRON- father by the hard kind of labor have lay bare 
the superintendent gaze return to the slender beseeching form and tearstained face in front of -PRON- 
-PRON- get slowly to -PRON- foot 
i shall prove what -PRON- say miss mallory -PRON- answer then in a husky unnatural voice and if -PRON- be true as god hear -PRON- i will see that -PRON- get -PRON- right 
but -PRON- must waityou must be patientyou must have confidence in -PRON- and no no not that 
before -PRON- could draw back -PRON- have fling -PRON- on -PRON- knee at -PRON- foot catch one of -PRON- hand and press -PRON- to -PRON- lip ohara go gun bremerton have not be go an hour from the mine when king wildly excited come run to ohara 
the irishman have just climb to the ore platform on -PRON- way into the mill and the sharp cry of king bring -PRON- to a quick aboutface to pay demand ohara startle by the look and manner of the cyanid expert horse have come back ohara and with an empty saddle 
when be this just now just this minute 
i run from the corral to find -PRON- get -PRON- ohara 
by george -PRON- have get -PRON- 
ohara take the pipe from -PRON- tooth and knock out the ashe against the side of the mill 
-PRON- thick eyebrow lower over the crisscross eye and -PRON- big thinlipped mouth twist but with no attempt at speech 
with one hand -PRON- grope in -PRON- pocket for -PRON- tobaccosack 
with deliberation -PRON- fill the bowl put away the sack and scratch a match 
do -PRON- hear pipe king fail to understand why -PRON- have not create a sensation horse have come back and never -PRON- mind cut in ohara in -PRON- soft tone -PRON- -PRON- business and not yours and be see to -PRON- 
go to the bunkhouse and get winchester 
fetch -PRON- to the corral after makin sure there be load in -PRON- 
why shillyshally 
this be no time for why s 
on the jump now 
ohara thrust -PRON- head through the opening that lead to the oreloft and shout for gile 
the battery man come bound up the step 
gile call away say ohara and until i come back -PRON- will be do the amalgamating along with the rest of -PRON- 
sure a cracked shoe in no battery 
keep -PRON- eye on -PRON- 
i will strike another match trail -PRON- over -PRON- pipebowl and jump from the ore platform 
the pipe be go under force draft as -PRON- hurry in the direction of the corral horse still restive stand with the loop rein throw over a corralpost 
the saddle swing underneath the stirrup rest on the ground 
not so bad maybe muttered ohara 
the saddle turn with -PRON- and -PRON- possible -PRON- s have no more than a spill 
whoa basham -PRON- add step to the horse and beginning to readjust the ridinggear 
by the time king reach the corral ohara have the rein off the post and be mount and wait load the little expert flutter hand the gun to ohara 
good enough not go alone to look for bremerton 
not 
watch -PRON- 
keep a still tongue between -PRON- tooth king and look after the work be back when i get here 
-PRON- dig in with -PRON- heel 
the excited horse snort and rear and then be off like an arrow along the trail 
king watch the long body hump over the saddle horn until horse and rider have vanish over the rise 
the mill begin to pound and the pounding gradually merge into a long continuous roar 
the expert toss -PRON- hand helplessly and apprehensively and turn back toward the office the beginning of the end -PRON- mutter but hang if i stay here while some one else come to take place have enough of this goodness know thought be busy 
-PRON- be clear bremerton have not go far before the saddle turn with himthe riderless horse have be too quick in get back to the mine 
no doubt -PRON- be this side of the canon that bremerton have take -PRON- fall 
as soon as -PRON- be over the side of the hill ohara pull the horse down to a slow pace 
-PRON- eye focus on the trail and keenly watch -PRON- as -PRON- proceed 
the dust be fetlock deep and -PRON- know -PRON- would show sign 
-PRON- find what -PRON- be look for near the place where the trail fork 
the mark be as clear as word in an open book 
first there be a clutter of hoofprint 
run through -PRON- be a broad streak as though a heavy bag have be drag at the end of a rope 
then too the horse prick up -PRON- ear and seem to have fear in that particular place face harden 
begorrv -PRON- murmur -PRON- bad than i think 
lee be throw and drag straight into the swale if the mark donot lie ajid this mount on be the one that snake -PRON- along 
how do -PRON- get loose 
and if -PRON- get loose and be all right why donot i meet -PRON- 
i wonder if go to see something in that swale that i donot want to see 
the horse tremble and do not want to go into the swale 
ohara force the animal and as -PRON- move along the bush give mute evidence of progress through -PRON- 
near the spot where the torn and disordered chaparral cease to show further sign ohara find a horse patiently stand with the rein droop from the bitring 
unless the irishman be greatly mistaken that wait horse belong to mariquita mallory 
at once -PRON- mind be flood with puzzle question 
guess as hard as -PRON- would however -PRON- could make nothing of that odd situation there in the swale 
drop the rein of -PRON- own mount -PRON- slide to the ground and begin beat up the brush 
-PRON- find nothing at all and this be a sort of negative satisfaction 
just as -PRON- have about finish -PRON- search a dull report clash on -PRON- ear a bit of lead whisper and the brim of -PRON- hat twitched 
so that s the way of -PRON- -PRON- exclaim and let go with the winchester from the hip 
-PRON- ear be keen even if -PRON- eyesight could not serve and a heavy slug whistle toward the point from which the shot have be fire at -PRON- 
a cry break from the depth of the brush 
ohara locate the point on the swale bank and hasten toward -PRON- 
when as near as -PRON- could judge -PRON- come to the spot -PRON- see no one 
save for the murmuring of the stampmill the swale be steep in deathly silence 
faith this be a brain twister mutter ohara rear head and shoulder above the bush and peer about -PRON- 
show yourself -PRON- imp of the old nick -PRON- cry 
or come again with a shot so i may be after locatin -PRON- 
-PRON- invitation be not accept 
no form materialize out of the depth of the chaparral and there be no more firing 
now what would -PRON- think of that soliloquize the irishman remove -PRON- hat and survey the hole through the brim 
sure i touch up the omadhoun that give -PRON- the souvenir but where in the name of the saint be -PRON- whisht -PRON- add abruptly listen 
-PRON- hear something 
whatever -PRON- be -PRON- be feeble and the faint murmuring of the mill almost drown -PRON- 
clap the hat on -PRON- head -PRON- proceed on over the swalebank pause and strain -PRON- ear at every other step 
-PRON- course bring -PRON- to the brink of the gully 
-PRON- gaze run along the abrupt break in the earth rest wonderingly on the end of a rope 
the rope be tie to a scraggy ironwood grow near the brink and be hang over the cliff face 
ohara lay aside the gun drop to -PRON- knee and look downward 
then -PRON- give an exclamation 
near the bottom of the swinging rope a yard from the base of the wall lie the motionless form of a man 
but -PRON- be not bremerton no not bremerton 
ohara breathe again 
be -PRON- the blackguard who shoot at -PRON- think the irishman 
do -PRON- bullet drop -PRON- over the edge or be -PRON- go down the rope and do -PRON- fall 
-PRON- be a matter for immediate investigation 
ohara go to the ironwood sit down with -PRON- heel over space twist -PRON- long leg in the rope take the winchester under -PRON- arm and begin to slide 
hamper with the gun -PRON- make awkward work of -PRON- but reach the foot of the wall safely 
the prostrate form lie limply and with arm throw wide from the shoulder prove to be a man whom ohara have never see before 
-PRON- hat lie at a little distance and -PRON- hair be dark and streak with gray 
a stubble of beard cover -PRON- cheek and chin 
-PRON- eye be closed 
-PRON- be plainly unconscious although a groan be now and then wrench from -PRON- tense lip 
no shot of mine touch -PRON- mutter ohara after an examination 
-PRON- fall from the wall and that s the whole of -PRON- 
be -PRON- or be -PRON- not the fellow who cut loose at -PRON- with that bullet 
and how in the fiend name be -PRON- mix up with bremerton and mariquita mallory 
sure stagger with what i know and donot know 
the clothing of the injured man be rather well than that usually wear by miner 
a mexican carvedleather band be around -PRON- hat and at -PRON- waist be a belt with a holster and a heavy navy revolver 
-PRON- hand although brown from exposure give no evidence of hard labor 
here be a mystery and ohara hate mystery 
yet -PRON- be compel to grapple with this one for -PRON- seem to bear directly upon what have happen to bremerton 
-PRON- try to arouse the stranger for a few word from -PRON- would go far toward clear up the situation 
-PRON- effort fail and -PRON- rise to -PRON- foot in perplexity 
while -PRON- stand there cudgel -PRON- brain -PRON- be electrify by a shout from across the gully 
whirl on the instant -PRON- be amazed and overjoyed to see bremerton come toward -PRON- 
and behind bremerton be miss mallory 
-PRON- advance to meet -PRON- hat be go and -PRON- clothe be dusty and tom and in much disorder 
all the indication point to a desperate experience of some sort on -PRON- part 
the sight o -PRON- do -PRON- eye good bremerton cry ohara 
i be not expect to find -PRON- with -PRON- foot under -PRON- but down and out somewhere in the scrub 
-PRON- horse come back to the mine without -PRON- and the saddle in such shape that i know -PRON- have have a spill 
troth man but glad thing be no bad 
miss mallory and -PRON- smile and doff -PRON- hat see -PRON- be a surprise and a pleasure 
i find -PRON- horse in the swale though so i ought not to be surprised 
miss mallory save -PRON- life begin bremerton and och the luck -PRON- have smile the irishman not that -PRON- life be save do -PRON- mind but that miss mallory save -PRON- for -PRON- 
but if there s save to do -PRON- be the kind to be depend upon 
now can -PRON- tell -PRON- who be the man at the foot of the wall ohara turn and point toward the crumple heap of humanity 
the girl stare smother an exclamation of horror then run forward 
when bremerton and ohara come to -PRON- side -PRON- turn a white face to -PRON- 
strange to -PRON- comment bremerton 
be -PRON- to -PRON- 
miss mallory no -PRON- answer in a strained voice 
i have see the man several time mr bremerton 
-PRON- eye wander to the rope follow -PRON- down and rest again on the sprawledout form 
-PRON- be dave carruther -PRON- add 
a carruther 
to ohara that name mean little 
to bremerton and the girl time and place consider -PRON- be deeply significant glance seek face and -PRON- read there areflection of -PRON- own thought 
here be wily and implacable foe 
here be the man who bully into sell the mine for a tithe of -PRON- value have strive to regain by lawless method what -PRON- have lose by legal sharp practise 
-PRON- have fall from the rope while lower -PRON- into the gully 
there seem no doubt of that 
a hard fate have finally unmask -PRON- 
bremerton knelt and make a hasty examination 
-PRON- get up shake -PRON- head ominously 
if i be any judge -PRON- be close to the end of -PRON- trail say -PRON- 
miss mallory and i hear shoot ohara -PRON- go on 
be -PRON- concerned in -PRON- ohara explain 
-PRON- fall from the rope hazard bremerton and those with -PRON- be frighten away 
i think the way be clear for -PRON- now 
-PRON- must get carruther to the mine 
if possible -PRON- must be revive so -PRON- can talk 
miss mallory -PRON- can climb out of here by mean of the rope yes -PRON- answer and start toward the wall 
wait please interpose bremerton 
ohara should go first with the rifle 
that will guard against possible surprise 
if the horse afe still there ohara when i be ready here -PRON- can hitch the upper end of the rope to a saddle 
the irishman nod and climb the rope readily enough 
bremerton tie the gun to the dangling end and -PRON- be draw rapidly upward 
when the rope be throw down again mariquita make the ascent watch anxiously by bremerton 
there be no call for anxiety 
with strength and skill the girl draw -PRON- from crevice to project stone the full length of the wall and be help over the brink by ohara 
bremerton then drag carruther closer to the wall tie the rope snugly under -PRON- arm and call to ohara to hoist away 
the limp twisting body rise gruesomely in the air and mariquita catch -PRON- at the top of the wall and by main strength draw -PRON- over the ledge 
finally the rope be throw back to bremerton and -PRON- win to the crest with little difficulty 
both horse be in the swale 
get into the saddle mike say bremerton lift carruther up to -PRON- and -PRON- can support -PRON- in front of -PRON- for the little distance -PRON- have to go walk 
-PRON- turn to the girl while ohara be mount 
miss mallory -PRON- go on will -PRON- ride to phoenix and send out a doctor and the sheriff 
i want to do anythingeverythe can -PRON- answer 
this be all -PRON- can do now 
remember what i tell -PRON- -PRON- finish earnestly and whatever happen do not doubt -PRON- 
there be a pathetic curve to -PRON- lip as -PRON- look at -PRON- trustingly and smile 
i could not leave the fortune of the mallory in well hand mr bremerton say -PRON- and hurry away to -PRON- horse 
-PRON- be away at speed while bremerton and ohara be attend to carruther 
-PRON- be a slow journey -PRON- have back to the mine but -PRON- reach -PRON- destination and have the injured man in bed long before the noon whistle sound from the mill 
neither bremerton nor ohara have do any talking on the return journey 
king who hurry to the office do enough talk for half a dozen 
carruther 
what in goodness name be the matter with -PRON- 
what have happen to bremerton 
be -PRON- rescue by ohara 
the superintendent wearily parry the expert question 
all in due time king say -PRON- -PRON- will know everything send for a doctor 
just now though -PRON- may help ohara try to bring carruther around get to fix up a little 
bremerton attend to -PRON- bruise and scratch and go through with -PRON- fix up 
when -PRON- have finish carruther be no near consciousness than -PRON- have be before obstinate about get back to earth ohara report 
faith -PRON- a doctor job or the undertaker and well have to wait 
why do -PRON- send for the sheriff lee important for -PRON- to be here in case carruther revive and have anything to say get -PRON- guess 
why the importance 
king have go -PRON- wonder way 
bremerton and ohara sit by the bed watch the injured man closely 
-PRON- be high time ohara understand the drift of affair and bremerton give -PRON- -PRON- full confidence 
the struggle mariquita and -PRON- father have go through with deane treachery to -PRON- and -PRON- covert bullying of carruther be bluntly state 
an angry red rush into the face and hieye gleam as -PRON- listen 
-PRON- get all that from lip that couldnot lie -PRON- exclaim when -PRON- friend finish 
what have -PRON- to say to -PRON- 
i want more proof that deane be the unscrupulous devil the girl have paint -PRON- 
oh but -PRON- can strain at a point 
where be -PRON- to get this proof bremerton nod toward carruther furnish -PRON- 
if -PRON- s ever able to talk -PRON- may nothing certain 
then get the proof from deane 
how in -PRON- own way say bremerton gaze out of the window 
ohara hoist around in -PRON- chair and peer at -PRON- friend through narrow eye 
and if -PRON- get this proof -PRON- query what will -PRON- do throw a thousand dollar of dirty money in -PRON- face snap bremerton 
that much -PRON- have pay -PRON- and -PRON- have make -PRON- possible to give -PRON- back 
then go further by heaven and see that the mallory get what -PRON- be entitle to 
fine exclaimed ohara 
glory be tis the fine thing in life to see a good man get right with -PRON- 
i know -PRON- would come 
-PRON- can throw the money in face if -PRON- will although i doubt the sense of that but -PRON- will never get the mallory -PRON- right 
deane have go to school for -PRON- bunco game and -PRON- donot know -PRON- a abs about the dirty work 
lock horn with -PRON- on that point bremerton and both -PRON- and the mallory will get the bad of -PRON- 
the mill whistle blow 
the clamor of the stamp die to silence and a general movement set in toward the chuckshanty 
bremerton remain with carruther while ohara go for -PRON- meal then ohara relieve bremerton 
when the latter return to the office -PRON- be surprised to find the irishman with the content of pocket on a table in front of -PRON- 
when -PRON- be look for evidence explain ohara personal belonging be common property 
now here this solidframed fortyfivecaliber colt 
three empty shell in the cylinder 
one load just miss -PRON- at the fork of the trail thank to the roadrunner another rake the bush while -PRON- and mariquita be get out of the swale the other maybe put that hole in -PRON- hat guesswork mike return bremerton 
close to the mark though 
if -PRON- ask for a motive isnot there a good one to tack onto carruther 
when rogue fall out the divil get -PRON- due a watch with a nugget fob 
the hand quit tell the time at seven twentyfive when -PRON- drop 
and here a notebook with interesting readin lee 
ohara pick up a small memorandumbook and turn the leave 
listen to this will -PRON- 
to pennyworth on account of bryden and the halfbreed pennyworth bremerton prick up -PRON- ear 
pennyworth be the lawyer who have charge of big and fight in court say -PRON- 
be there anything more not a scrap and this must have get in by mistake 
now -PRON- know who finance the defense for those blackguard and who s pay pension for hushmoney 
i guess this be proof enough even if carruther be never able to speak a word 
bremerton go out into the other room and for a whole hour tramp the floor 
ohara know that -PRON- loyalty for deane be die hard 
at the end of the hour an automobile dash up to the headquarters adobe and the doctor and the sheriff spring out

-PRON- fall to rave again 
ohara get up and pass into the other room 
return softly with the flute -PRON- sit down by the head of the bed and begin to play 
-PRON- be the intermezzo from cavalleria rusticana 
never have bremerton hear ohara play as -PRON- play then 
the tender melody float about the room and there go with -PRON- a rustling as of unseen wing 
ransom stand like a man entrance 
morton pull down -PRON- sleeve and walk to the window 
bremerton bow over -PRON- pencil and paper weirdly thrill by the pathos and the pleading of those whisper note 
the twisted line straighten in face 
-PRON- fall silent 
presently -PRON- eye close and -PRON- lie still 
ohara make an end of the music and lay the flute on -PRON- knee 
god breathe carruther open -PRON- eye hear that before somewhere 
what piece be that 
only a bit of an air to make -PRON- see thing differently say ohara 
-PRON- do that for -PRON- and by the same token i think -PRON- may for -PRON-

i try to follow -PRON- into the gully and find out where -PRON- go butbut i slip from the rope as some one fire at -PRON- man in the swale voice die in -PRON- throat 
-PRON- look at ohara and -PRON- lip frame a silent word 
ransom nod to ohara then go to bremerton take the hastily scrawl transcript and read -PRON- over while the flute music once more throb through the room 
over and over while the tide ebb ohara breathe the intermezzo into the dead wood and warm -PRON- into life 
the doctor watch carruther finally go to the bedside and bend down to touch -PRON- wrist 
that will be all say the doctor to ohara -PRON- s past hear -PRON- 
the sheriff have crack the shell of a troublesome mystery 
-PRON- professional satisfaction be jar a bit in congruously by a sentiment perfectly human and somewhat awkward the way like to go out -PRON- when i have to -PRON- murmur get a melodeon to home 
give -PRON- the name of that piece ohara so i can have -PRON- daughter learn -PRON- 
ohara with pity in -PRON- pale eye stand look down at carruther 
faith say -PRON- there s good in the bad of -PRON- and bad in the good of -PRON- and there s some hope for the man who go beyond with the love o music in -PRON- soul 
-PRON- lay the hand on the breast and gently draw the blanket over the face but cog in the wheel anyway -PRON- add and the machine keep run even if a cog here and there be not what -PRON- ought to be 
come out in the other room all of -PRON- request the sheriff while i read what bremerton take down fresh in -PRON- mind -PRON- know and i want -PRON- to sign as witness 
-PRON- group about ransom in the office and listen while -PRON- read 
after that each set -PRON- hand to the document a black spot clear up go on ransom 
beat all i never think of carruther in this matter of griggsby 
but that s the way 
the plain truth be so plain sometimes be apt to dodge -PRON- 
-PRON- turn to bremerton 
thank to -PRON- bremerton from this on deane will have clear sailing 
do -PRON- know blame glad of one thing that inquire bremerton 
why that the mallory have no hand in the lawlessness out here 
there be a spell when -PRON- look dark for -PRON- 
no objection to havingthat nod toward the bedroom here until i can get the undertaker out 
certainly not 
then suppose -PRON- hike morton be ready in a minute ransom say the doctor 
-PRON- go to the end of the pipeline and wash -PRON- hand 
when -PRON- have return to thq office and slip into -PRON- coat the sheriff have the machine ready 
bremerton meanwhile have pick up a pad of telegraph blank and write the follow silas deane denver 
have clean up on the other crowd and locate bonanza vein on mariquita property 
important -PRON- come on at once 
notify and will meet -PRON- -PRON- go out of the office and hand the message to the sheriff 
send that for -PRON- will -PRON- ransom -PRON- ask 
let -PRON- go collect 
glad to oblige say the sheriff 
will get -PRON- on the wire as sooma i hit town 
bremerton and ohara watch the car vanish over the rise in the trail jand then the irishman after a long look at -PRON- friend turn on -PRON- heel and move off toward the mill 
the news spread through the camp that carruther the man who have locate the mine and add to -PRON- holding until -PRON- embrace the whole valley and the neighboring hill have go -PRON- way and be lie in the headquarters adobe 
when the day man come off duty and the night man go on all eye seek the little office building awe and curious 
the same eye presently shift to bremerton and pay -PRON- a tribute of respect and high consideration 
carruther represent the evil power that have skulk in the hill fight man savagely and murderously 
with carruther those power have be lay low and all the credit be give to bremerton 
a well spirit manifest -PRON- among the worker 
in the evening bremerton and ohara carry -PRON- chair out of the office and sit by the door 
the irishman flute the air dear to -PRON- heart and the other smoke reflectively 
by and by the flute be lay aside and ohara -PRON- fill a pipe and blow fragrant wreath into the still air wire for deane announce the superintendent 
there be no demonstration from ohara 
lean back against the adobe wall -PRON- puff serenely at -PRON- pipe 
i say i have send for deaneaske -PRON- to come on immediately repeat bremerton 
i know -PRON- would do that or go to denver one or the other say ohara 
what will -PRON- do lee 
what would -PRON- do mike divil know expect though that -PRON- will keep -PRON- head and be sensible 
none of the lee reckless in -PRON- accounting with deane man 
-PRON- be to blame along at the first by get into this so easy forget that 
carruther muse bremerton get only what be come to -PRON- 
-PRON- fight with deane be a case of diamond cut diamond and right or wrong wouldnot have be strain whichever way the card fall 
but between the two of -PRON- the mallory be crush and beat and fling to the scrapheap 
the right most to be consider be not consider at all the point that involve and concern -PRON- 
i take word and help -PRON- rob the mallory of what be justly -PRON- weigh heavily in the word 
the wrath of a man who have all -PRON- life try to be square only to have a friend besmirch -PRON- ideal and sully -PRON- honor swirl in the tone of voice 
after all lee say ohara soothingly tis no crime -PRON- have do 
-PRON- step aside in take sayso when -PRON- should have go under the surface indication 
-PRON- all do that same more or less 
when be in wrong the part of a wise man be to retire gracefully and in order 
which be the same as say with as little trouble as possible 
in -PRON- opinion the mallory be beyond help so far as this mine be concern see about that and face hardened and -PRON- tooth click on -PRON- pipestem not take -PRON- advice i know in -PRON- present temper but so help -PRON- be around and have a hand in what happen if -PRON- go too far 
mind that 
at that juncture a long black wagon roll along the trail turn and come to a halt in front of the office 
two man get down from the seat and one approach bremerton 
mr bremerton 
yes 
the sheriff send -PRON- out 
come with -PRON- say bremerton and lead the way into the office be next day that i man ride out from town with an answer to message 
shake 
know -PRON- would turn the trick 
meet -PRON- phoenix friday morning 
the superintendent smile grimly 
deane be come and -PRON- be destine to receive a few surprisesnot all of -PRON- pleasant 
on thursday afternoon bremerton send to the bunkhouse for gorman the night amalgamator 
this millman be the key to some thing which the superintendent want to know 
gorman usually sleep in the forenoon and loaf in the afternoon messenger find -PRON- and -PRON- come straight to the office 
-PRON- be a rateye weaselfaced little man whose main object in life seem to be to keep out of sight 
the most devious way between two point be the short for gorman 
-PRON- enter the office so silently that bremerton do not know -PRON- be there until -PRON- be see beside the desk 
on deck mr bremerton say gorman nervously 
sit down say the superintendent 
the millman cuddle into a chair and look about -PRON- shiftily 
-PRON- have the air of one who be expect something disagreeable to happen 
if -PRON- be under the impression gorman that i donot know -PRON- be a thief -PRON- be mistaken 
the quiet conversational tone be weirdly out of harmony with the sentiment express manner disarm gorman for a moment and then when the burden of the word have sink in -PRON- bristle angrily 
nobody can talk to -PRON- like that by gorry 
insult like -PRON- i never stand for and never will -PRON- time be a fool return bremerton 
-PRON- know that if -PRON- have -PRON- desert -PRON- would have be catch in the same net that snare big steve and chombo 
while steve be here -PRON- turn in no more amalgam than -PRON- do since -PRON- s be go -PRON- have be turn in three time as much as -PRON- do before 
i be pretty sure -PRON- be steal but i have no time to bother with -PRON- 
now that -PRON- be evidently play fair i have no inclination to make -PRON- trouble 
all i want -PRON- to do be to talk 
some man with a guilty conscience can bluff successfully 
gorman be not one of that kind 
for long -PRON- have be afraid -PRON- be suspect 
i ainot admit a thing say gorman but what do -PRON- want -PRON- to talk about where be -PRON- on the night i reach phoenix king be in charge here and somebody have bring a supply of whisky into camp 
not much work be go on 
i guess -PRON- remember 
the millman wriggle uncomfortably 
i donot get -PRON- at all -PRON- answer 
i be at the mariquita right along hem and haw and sidestep return bremerton not intend to take any action against -PRON- be more kindly disposed however if -PRON- come out squaretoed and tell -PRON- what -PRON- know 
be -PRON- and big steve directly connect with carruther gorman take a red cotton handkerchief from -PRON- pocket and draw -PRON- across -PRON- face 
-PRON- be undergo an ordeal and show -PRON- straight now mr bremerton -PRON- whimper tryin to do what s right 
-PRON- ainot go to put -PRON- through if i tell the truth 
no 
do i get fire not so long as -PRON- keep straight 
well then chombo work with carruther and big steve work with chombo and i work with steve the gospel of -PRON- and kiss the book 
i didnot want to go in on -PRON- 
back away from the propersition for quite a spell 
steve allow though that -PRON- be go to get -PRON- toll of amalgam from the night shift and if i didnot come over then some night turn up missin and there d be an amalgamator in -PRON- place -PRON- could depend on 
i be scare into -PRON- mr bremerton that s all 
who dispose of the amalgam chombo get -PRON- to carruther and -PRON- turn -PRON- into cash 
-PRON- all get -PRON- whack and -PRON- be purty profitable 
when chombo have the pin pull on -PRON- steve sneak the stuff out of camp 
but i reckon -PRON- know about that 
have -PRON- any idea why the stuff jvas cache at oak flat 
-PRON- wasnot always cache there chombo pick out that place 
why 
i donot know only what i hear from big steve 
what do -PRON- hear why that if -PRON- find out anythin carruther want to make -PRON- look bad for the mallory murmur bremerton and sit back in -PRON- chair 
follow a moment reflection -PRON- go on who leave the mariquita mine that night the crowd beat -PRON- up at the phoenix townditch 
not -PRON- say gorman hastily i wasnot among -PRON- 
be steve bryden in the gang 
no 
steve be j gittin busy yvith the likker 
i hear that chombo be with that outfit purty sure no one else from the camp have a hand in the doing ball of amalgam be drop by one of the crowd 
then -PRON- be chombo drop -PRON- 
-PRON- be holdin out a little on carruther right along 
thus one dark point be clear up 
bremerton believe that the fellow -PRON- have knock into the canal be chombo 
what man do carruther have with -PRON- out in the hill 
do -PRON- know that gorman 
-PRON- be man who have be bounce from the mine 
griggsby let one or two go and lacey ditch the other 
carruther gather -PRON- in and -PRON- be more than willin to help -PRON- 
-PRON- make -PRON- worth -PRON- while 
where be those man now 
why when carruther go out -PRON- feller begin to runand i allow -PRON- be still a runnin 
-PRON- can gamble a blue stack -PRON- wonot show up around here no more mr bremerton 
i canot think of anything else gorman say the superintendent in luck to come out of that amalgam deal as well as -PRON- have 
keep that in mind 
that will be all 
the millman arise and pass softly toward the door 
-PRON- halt there for a final word to stay on and have no trouble 
so long as -PRON- do the right thing gorman -PRON- neednot worry 
i know in luck and standin pat on an honest deal 
much oblige to -PRON- mr bremerton 
-PRON- fade out of the office and the superintendent be positive that the fang of last enemy have be draw 
from that time on there would be only clear sailing for those in charge of the mariquita mine 
everything be propitious for that final accounting with deane 
thursday afternoon bremerton have dutch fre put a pair of cayuse to the pole of the mine buckboard 
when the rig be ready and the superintendent be about to climb into -PRON- for the ride to phoenix ohara come down from the mill off after deane bremerton ask the irishman 
yes be the answer reach phoenix in the morning and i intend to bring the rest of this business to a close in short order 
a worried look cross face not -PRON- plan be -PRON- to do anything in phoenix or on the way out -PRON- continue 
there have be something that bremerton have want to say to -PRON- friend for several day 
here be a good time for -PRON- 
mike -PRON- be not -PRON- guardian 
no man could ask for a well friend but there be a dead line which even a friend can not cross without make trouble 
-PRON- business with deane be -PRON- own affair and go to handle -PRON- in -PRON- own way without let or hindrance from -PRON- meddle 
keep hand off not let that hot head of your take -PRON- to the divil entirely flare ohara 
so help -PRON- not have -PRON- do time for rough -PRON- with a yellow dog like deane 
smoke that in -PRON- pipe 
ohara turn back to the mill 
bremerton stare after -PRON- speculatively then climb into the buckboard and drive away 
at the fork in the trail -PRON- be surprised to find mariquita mount on -PRON- horse and evidently wait for -PRON- 
-PRON- ride out into the road ahead of -PRON- team 
-PRON- have ask deane to come here -PRON- exclaim 
-PRON- be necessary -PRON- return 
-PRON- get -PRON- information direct from denver i suppose 
-PRON- already know mr bremerton that -PRON- have a friend in denver office 
why why have -PRON- do this -PRON- speak vehemently passionately and clearly be doubtful of motive 
i tell -PRON- miss mallory that -PRON- would have to trust -PRON- -PRON- say calmly 
-PRON- be not do -PRON- 
-PRON- have send for deane to show -PRON- thatthat lose lead yes 
i want -PRON- to understand that the work -PRON- give -PRON- to do have be accomplish 
how will that help -PRON- -PRON- cry 
by show -PRON- how valuable the mine be how be -PRON- go to benefit -PRON- father and -PRON- i have -PRON- plan 
-PRON- know deane pretty well and i guess -PRON- realize that what i have ahead of -PRON- be anything but child play 
i be go to do what i can 
that miss mallory be all any man can do 
be -PRON- go to lose confidence in -PRON- -PRON- ride alongside the buckboard and lean sidewise to offer -PRON- hand 
no -PRON- say softly and with a wan smile for -PRON- be the only one who can do anything with deane 
help -PRON- and -PRON- will be worth -PRON- while 
if -PRON- win an interest for -PRON- in the property i have come to tell -PRON- that a part of -PRON- will be yours 
-PRON- drop the hand as though a serpent have sting -PRON- 
-PRON- know -PRON- very well -PRON- answer 
i canot be bribe miss mallory and sorry -PRON- think so 
-PRON- pick up the line and drive on 
until -PRON- be out of sight the girl sit motionless in the saddle look after -PRON- 
bremerton have work that evening in phoenix 
-PRON- call on a lawyer and have a certain paper fill out and make ready for sign 
on -PRON- way back to the hotel -PRON- step into a hardware store and buy a small revolver to take the place of the automatic -PRON- have lose 
the dealer want to sell -PRON- a box of cartridge 
bremerton however do not buy 
i want be the revolver -PRON- say 
with the legal paper in the breast of -PRON- coat and the unloaded revolver in -PRON- hippocket -PRON- retrace -PRON- way to the hotel 
the train from the north be due at seven oclock 
-PRON- roll up to the station promptly on time and deane be the last passenger to get out of the pullman 
the porter obsequiously hand -PRON- a black boston bag receive in exchange for -PRON- a silver dollar 
the mining king be a picturesque figure as -PRON- come down the platform 
-PRON- black stetson longtaile coat and flow tie compel attention 
a wonderful diamond sparkle in the white frill of -PRON- shirt and a massive chain wriggle across the front of -PRON- lowcut vest 
another stone conspicuous for size and brilliancy be very much in evidence on the third finger of -PRON- left hand 
good living and lack of exercise have double -PRON- girth since the prospect day with bremerton 
-PRON- walk be the cautious flatfooted waddle of the fat man although -PRON- carry -PRON- off with a touch of distinction 
all in all -PRON- be a most impressing spectacle 
-PRON- be plain that -PRON- know -PRON- and equally plain that -PRON- like -PRON- 
-PRON- money have bring with -PRON- power and influence and no man be more in the western limelight 
the reporter for three different newspaper have reach -PRON- ahead of bremerton 
-PRON- want interview 
blame if i can travel a dozen mile out of denver without have a bunch of -PRON- cimarron tight at -PRON- heel -PRON- complain goodnaturedly 
now boy i havenot a pesky thing for -PRON- to put in the paper 
maybe have news for -PRON- before i leave 
if i have i promise to herd -PRON- all together treat every one fair and not play favorite 
try one of these will -PRON- and just forget in town till ready to loosen up 
-PRON- draw a silvermounte cigarcase from the breast of -PRON- coat and offer -PRON- around 
then -PRON- catch sight of bremerton 
howdy pard -PRON- cry break away from the newspaperman drop -PRON- satchel and grab the tall gaunt figure in corduroy with both hand 
-PRON- do -PRON- by thunder and way this side of the six month 
lee -PRON- be the clear quill 
look finern silk too 
what do i say huh 
do i know what i be do or didnot i a cab go to the hotel and sit in at the chucktable hungriern a ute squaw on government ration 
bremerton pick up the satchel deane hook arm with -PRON- and -PRON- go on to the wait line of carriage 
a little later -PRON- be be hurry to the good hotel in town deane talk effusively and give -PRON- friend no chance for a word 
there be the plaza same old courthouse plaza where -PRON- and bremerton have sit in the shade year ago wonder where -PRON- would strike for next 
yes and by gorry there be the same identical umhrella tree -PRON- have sit under -PRON- beat all how the old time come back 
below the corner of first avenue be the wall of the town corral where -PRON- have keep -PRON- burro and saywouldnot -PRON- rattle -PRON- there be coffee where -PRON- have spend many a quarter for grub 
good grub too well grub than any deane have ever have since or anyhow -PRON- taste well 
i guess -PRON- a sureenough fact lee philosophized deane that the more money -PRON- get to spend for thing the less -PRON- appreciate -PRON- 
oh -PRON- sure be good day 
the mining king sit back into -PRON- coat and relapse into a mood of flabby and morbid reminiscence 
-PRON- come out of -PRON- shortly and drop a fat friendly hand on knee 
why donot -PRON- tune up old partner -PRON- ask 
i donot reckon -PRON- have peep since -PRON- get together 
the recollection of old time when deane be different and a comrade worth have have wrench hard at the purpose bremerton have in mind 
-PRON- brush the feeling aside and look into -PRON- friend face with a smile be hold -PRON- tongue and listen to -PRON- silas -PRON- answer 
not much chance for -PRON- to put in a word when -PRON- get start right i guess that s right and deane chuckle 
this be a regular picnic for -PRON- 
old scene old friend and a pot of money into the bargain 
enough to make a fellow grow young and feel -PRON- oats eh -PRON- get down at the hotel and deane hand the black bag to a wait boy 
careful with that son -PRON- warn two pint bottle of old scotch in that grip and if anything happen to -PRON- ruin 
deane write -PRON- name on the register 
-PRON- begin place under -PRON- but the latter protest book at another hotel say -PRON- go to be book at this one too go to have breakfast together already have breakfast 
why didnot -PRON- wait dash -PRON- -PRON- be treat -PRON- like a hire man more than a pard eat again that s all name go down and deane insist that -PRON- accompany -PRON- up to -PRON- room 
the black bag be open and deane pull out a flannel shirt a slouch hat a pair of khaki trouser and a pair of laced kneeboot 
-PRON- laugh like a boy as -PRON- show the outfit 
bet -PRON- life old pard i bring -PRON- war clothe along 
after i eat go to get into -PRON- and -PRON- and -PRON- will go potter off into the hill same as -PRON- use to 
great 
-PRON- wonot be hardly the same si say bremerton 
instead of walk and drive -PRON- packburro well ride in a buckboard -PRON- get any automobile in this man town automobile be a cultivate taste and the superintendent at the mariquita canot afford so much style only a counterfeit at this oldtime game deane 
two day of the old life would kill -PRON- 
maybe -PRON- be right 
help -PRON- to thisevery swig be warrant to take ten year off -PRON- shoulder prime 
a man in denver get -PRON- for -PRON- special 
bremerton do not drink 
-PRON- want a clear jiead while -PRON- be with deane 
while -PRON- back be turn -PRON- unscrew the cap and let -PRON- go at that 
deane face around take the flask out of -PRON- hand and help -PRON- generously 
in a few minute -PRON- go down to breakfast together 
deane raid the bill of fare while bremerton content -PRON- with a cup of coffee and griddlecake 
not much be say about the mine 
-PRON- be a subject for private discussion and that diningroom be altogether too public a place 
after the meal bremerton leave deane to get into -PRON- war clothe and go after the team and buckboard 
-PRON- be ten oclock before -PRON- take the trail into the hill 
now remark deane when -PRON- have leave the town well behind -PRON- -PRON- can get down to case lee please -PRON- a heap the way -PRON- have manage thing 
old griggsby be a false alarm and lacey be a weak sister 
-PRON- grab the big difficulty by the scruff of the neck and chuck -PRON- into the discard 
know -PRON- would 
this in few word be estimate of the man who have die try to serve -PRON- and of the other who have go down to physical wreck in -PRON- employ 
-PRON- donot know what griggsby would have do if -PRON- enemy hadnot pick -PRON- off say bremerton sharply and lacey be a whole man see -PRON- and i know 
oh well yes if -PRON- want -PRON- that way return deane impatiently 
success though be the only thing that count 
-PRON- pull the old working through to gloty and there wasnot much fuss about -PRON- either 
reel that off to -PRON- 
bremerton proceed to reel -PRON- off 
-PRON- take a good deal of satisfaction in make the case as bad as -PRON- be 
begin with the assault by the town canal -PRON- follow with the capture of steve and chombo then tell of the shot at the fork of the trail and finish with the fate of carruther 
skilfully -PRON- leave mariquita mallory out of the narrative 
not once be -PRON- name mention 
-PRON- discovery of the lose lead be deal with indefinitelytreate as an accident 
for all this -PRON- have -PRON- reason 
mariquita and -PRON- father would become prominent enough before -PRON- be through with the mining king 
deane be absorb in the recital 
the fire go out of -PRON- cigar again and again 
-PRON- breathe hard in the pinche and by the town canal and at the fork in the trail -PRON- fat hand clench and -PRON- swear under -PRON- breath 
but -PRON- fat face beam while bremerton be describe that footwide vein back of the overhang take -PRON- oath lee -PRON- comment earnestly when the telling be do i never think carruther would rough thing up like that become of the law in these part anyhow -PRON- protect a man in keep -PRON- own 
never mind that though 
a miss be as good as a mile and -PRON- skin the gang 
-PRON- make -PRON- blood sing just to hear -PRON- palaver about -PRON- 
a month run on that bonanza ore and the mine as good as sell 
half a million by thunder and -PRON- cost -PRON- only fifty thousand business bremerton the way to get rich 
there be no regret for that mound over griggsby in the phoenix cemetery and not a word of commiseration for the unlucky lacey eye be single to that half million 
-PRON- completely fill -PRON- perspective 
bremerton know that if -PRON- 5had fall at the fork of the trail -PRON- moneygrubbing friend would have experience few twinge and few regret 
the roar of flood water in arapahoe canon be almost silence 
deane have strangle -PRON- finer sentiment with a rope of gold 
the deane that be and the deane who now sit at side in the buckboard be two different man 
this realization do much to reconcile bremerton to the course -PRON- have map out for -PRON- 
in the interest of right and justice -PRON- could deal with this swagger purseproud trickster as -PRON- could not have deal -PRON- old loyal prospectorfriend 
deane offer bremerton a cigar 
bremerton decline and fill and light -PRON- pipe 
for some time -PRON- travel in silence 
finally deane arouse to observe i consider bremerton that another month of -PRON- at the mine will be enough get out for fifteen hundred less than i calculate on 
eh 
the superintendent eye narrow that -PRON- ask 
deane repeat -PRON- word 
bremerton have hear -PRON- plainly enough the first time but -PRON- want -PRON- repeat 
-PRON- mean say -PRON- that i be hire for six month for three thpusand dollar and that inasmuch as i have make good in half the time i be only entitle to half pay 
be that -PRON- 
something like that reply deane give a canny glance out of the tail of -PRON- eye 
be -PRON- go to split the tenthousanddollar bonus in two as well ask bremerton dryly 
well what do -PRON- think 
i donot know deane 
i shall have to give -PRON- a little reflection 
of course i intend to do the right thing burst out the other in a flurry of virtuous determination not be small with a friend and -PRON- can gamble a blue stack on that 
think -PRON- over old pard leave -PRON- to -PRON- 
whatever -PRON- say be right go with deane 
here be the final straw 
for risk -PRON- life for rob the mallory for make the mine worth half a million deane could haggle with -PRON- old friend over the paltry sum that be to be pay 
yes certainly bremerton would think -PRON- over 
a flurry of excitement pass through the camp with the arrival of deane 
every worker want a look at the big boss 
-PRON- be discuss frankly by a few 
these maintain that -PRON- win -PRON- game by jump man over the business checkerboard sacrifice ruthlessly in -PRON- dash for the kingrow 
-PRON- say that -PRON- employee be catspaw for pull -PRON- golden chestnut out of the fire that -PRON- have not the nerve for execute -PRON- own scheme that -PRON- buy man in open market and play -PRON- selfishly and unscrupulously for -PRON- own lawless gain 
talk of this kind however leave no sentiment of disgust or disapproval in -PRON- train success and -PRON- wealth dazzle the eye and confuse the understanding 
the mining king be a rugged and prominent figure all up and down the pacific slope and man shut -PRON- eye to -PRON- past and give -PRON- a hand for what -PRON- be 
ohara take no part in the buzz gossip in the mill 
-PRON- listen passively while gile and the engineer shout confidence to each other about the mineowner 
the irishman have tact as well as the courage of -PRON- conviction 
in the late afternoon deane and bremerton visit the blind gully and search out a place where the visitor could be lower with least danger and physical effort to -PRON- 
then -PRON- go to the overhang and examine the bonanza lead 
deane be astound overjoyed 
-PRON- talk of run up the price on the syndicate and of profit more largely by -PRON- superintendent work 
-PRON- greed outrun -PRON- delight and -PRON- stuffy voice jingle with prospective dollar 
-PRON- swagger up and down the tunnel 
-PRON- brag about what -PRON- have and what -PRON- be go to have the thing -PRON- have do and the thing -PRON- would do and -PRON- wind up with dam -PRON- bremerton i donot know but take the bit in -PRON- tooth and insist on give -PRON- every sou of that ten thousand
