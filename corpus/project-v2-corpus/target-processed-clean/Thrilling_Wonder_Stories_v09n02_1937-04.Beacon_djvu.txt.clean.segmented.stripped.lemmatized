-PRON- read an interplanetary novelette be fascinate by some of the stimulate idea contain therein then sit back and admire the writer ingenuity 
that a vast percentage of the reader of be vitally concerned regard the origin background and theme of the story -PRON- read have already be demonstrate conclusively by -PRON- numerous letter of approbation since the inception of this department an absorb game go behind the scene look right over the author shoulder at the halfstarted page in -PRON- typewriter 
but here a word of warning anesthetize the effect of the story by consult the follow letter prior to read the work -PRON- tel about 
in several letter the author tip -PRON- hand and what be intend to be a surprise in the story be frankly discuss 
so turn back here only after -PRON- have read the entire issue by be a mighty interesting story from -PRON- dramatic start to the surprising climax how mr binder explain the genesis of -PRON- novelette the idea behind be one of those that strike suddenly 
i have be vacuously cast about for a good plot but want to get away from the usual theme 
how about something really appal in the way of earthly doom but at the same time something close to the ground 
-PRON- may have be -PRON- subconscious grilling that suddenly give life to the idea of the sun fall down on earth there be a menace or a terror that be personal one that each reader would feel menace -PRON- 
from there -PRON- be a natural step to split the story into separate episode to indicate how universal how far reach the doom be 
-PRON- be a human interest theme and as such have to be develop from the angle of human emotion rather than action 
the jungle scene suggest -PRON- immediately for what can shake a man guilt out of -PRON- secret soul quicker than the knowledge of doom and judgment 
and so with the other scene 
each be the choice out of dozen or hundred of similar episode that may -PRON- occur anywhere on earth during those tumultuous hour 
the science of the story be frankly subordinate to the human interest 
-PRON- call for no more stretch of imagination than the usual doom story but have to be plausible for the sake of realism 
for that reason the etherstrain explanation have to be complete but sketchy in order to take up as little space as possible have always be of the opinion right or wrong that science fiction need much more of human interest 
with the influence that the late weinbaum exercise on sciencefiction i be glad to note a definite trend toward the humanizing of -PRON- once so cold and lifeless character 
-PRON- need scientist that be not wooden puppet villain that be humanly yet viciously motivated hero that go more by the heart than by the mind and menace that hit -PRON- between the eye do not mean that -PRON- should stop explore the immeasurable reach of space or halt the progress of superscience or limit the boundless delving of imagination in -PRON- story but i do believe -PRON- at the other side of the editorial desk should not hesitate to have -PRON- character act in accordance with human nature 
too often -PRON- hero follow a psychology path lay out by a framework of science and fail to be fundamentally human 
at any rate the story of attempt to show the probable reaction of humanity to the panic of world end as characterize by a few choose example of ifs collective horde 
if -PRON- create in the reader the slight thrill of personal danger -PRON- have hit -PRON- mark 
otherwise -PRON- have miss -PRON- completely and ingloriously novelette be a plausible account of what may happen in a future war between force depend mainly on scientific weapon for supremacy what mr zagat have to say regard the development of -PRON- story the pattern of life do not change though the environment perhaps even the form of man undergoe a constant mutation 
through the age the fundamental of this thing -PRON- call live remain the same loyaltv and treachery selflessness and greed patriotism and treason selfseeking and selfsacrifice friendship and enmity love and hate adventure and desuetude 
-PRON- be the conflict and inlerplay of these that furnish with the warp of -PRON- tale the early cromagnon storyweaver crouch shaggy and bruteface in the communal cave and dispel with the magic of -PRON- grunt monosyllabic speech the tribe shudder dread of the sabretooth tiger whose roar beat out of the fearful dark against the portal boulder 
-PRON- compose the lay of the silkribbone troubadour strumming -PRON- lyre in the castle highraftered hall while armored sentry pace the battlement

but come -PRON- will 
and -PRON- will be fight with courage 
with devotion and skill and ingenuity set against the might -PRON- deem overwhelming but always and ever with courage 
when the fight be over win or lose some yarnspinner whose primal germ lie unguessed in -PRON- loin or mine or that of the elevator boy who just close the gate in -PRON- anteroom will sing the saga of those new hero 
to anticipate some narrator who lie curl in the womb of thing to be to peer a little behind the veil that screen that which be to happen i write that adventure will not occur to be sure 
but some other adventure whose human fundamental will be just the same be as certain to occur as that in this next instant i will complete this sentence by dr the cover story for this issue carry a surprise end that be certain few reader will anticipate how dr carr plan -PRON- interplanetary short i want to write a story about space piracy and a lone wolf crusader wdio for reason knowm only to -PRON- wage a fierce and singlehanded warfare against these buccaneer of the sky 
this crusader would be a man of mystery of course -PRON- identity unknown on any planet 
-PRON- would be necessary therefore to mask -PRON- for -PRON- must often come in contact with space patrolman and other 
the idea of make -PRON- a metal man govern by an organic brain seem good 
but where be i to get the human intelligence which must inhabit this brain 
then i make use of an idea that i have have in mind for some time that of liberate the human intelligence by subject the body to an electrical wave whose frequency be the same as that of the body upon which -PRON- be direct 
this too seem good i could take the intelligence from someone who have be victimize by pirate and thus provide -PRON- crusader with -PRON- motive 
the story be start and action precipitate by have the child become affected by a harmonic of the wave direct upon -PRON- father 
and so -PRON- be in this manner that come to be write 
a eil fascinating novelette of last stand and of first space migration be write after some considerable attention have be devote to the theme by the author 
jone do a careful job on this as -PRON- will realize from read this explain -PRON- 
-PRON- be the conception of a die world with humanity still persist in spite of adversity 
-PRON- be prove that planet have age that -PRON- become old and uninhabitable 
-PRON- good age of existence fade away 
well the time machine afford -PRON- much food for thought on the subject 
-PRON- be extremely doubtful that mankind will carry on for five million year or a million more year for that matter 
aa a group -PRON- be ilka the jug that be carry to the well too often 
there be too many thing which may happen to -PRON- 
yet there still remain a possibility that -PRON- may struggle onward for five million year 
regard this possibility have present but one viewpoint of what may happen what -PRON- may be like yet there be nothing too definite on which to base this assumption 
too many thing can happen to change history environment and man -PRON- evolution be guide largely by environment and -PRON- own initiative 
-PRON- be scarcely to be take for grant that the course of the world civilization shall be forward 
there will be inevitable retrogression mankind will to all probability and fall change form and shape revert to degenerate savagery return again to a civilized slate 
mankind be menace with all form of destruction include -PRON- for man be often bad enemy 
i have draw a very conservative conception of the change work in man after five million year for -PRON- be to vie expect that -PRON- may assume an even more radical appearance than that suggest in the tale 
man long ago lose -PRON- tail and most of the hair which entirely cover -PRON- body appendix too be due to become passe 
in time with the help of science -PRON- may come to subsist entirely upon radiate energy this after have supplement -PRON- digestive diet with more and more of the radiate energy until finally the digestive organ have become extinct 
when earth grow old 
man if -PRON- be sufficiently intelligent must find a new world peculiarly adapt to -PRON- 
-PRON- be most likely that during the rise and fall of humanity throughout the age space flying will be rediscover and lose many time 
there may even be visitor from beyond -PRON- own solar occasional retrogression to savagery and animalism will probably be swift than -PRON- forward return evolution follow the line of least resistance 
that -PRON- will become the foodless and sleepless creature depict in -PRON- story be but one of myriad possibility for many thing can happen to -PRON- in so long a time 
no one can with any certainty anticipate the farflung destiny of man in the light of reasonable consideration -PRON- may only conjecture ay will always be famous for -PRON- story of atomic exploration how the author of first conceive this theme once i be a very earnest young bunessman 
i take a subway ride 
i sit idly stare at the advertisement over the seat across from -PRON- 
-PRON- attention focusse on an ad of the quaker oats company 
-PRON- show the portly figure of a quaker gentleman in a threecornered hat 
-PRON- hold in -PRON- hand a box of oats on which be a picture of the same gentleman hold a similar package 
and on that package i could distinguish a still small quaker still hold another tiny package 
i stare spellbound 
i begin to wonder if by go closer to the ad i would see a fourth small quaker 
and a fifth 
if i have a microscope and the printing be mathematically perfect how many could i see 
an infinite numberl quaker oat down into the infinity of smallness 
i go home seize pencil and paper 
thus -PRON- first atomic story the girl in the golden atom be bear 
and -PRON- have serve as inspiration for all -PRON- other science fiction 
but i be blissfully ignorant 
in write -PRON- first story i violate every rule of plot construction and handling 
for instance i call -PRON- hero the very young man 
when the story be in proof an irritated proofreader phone -PRON- ask for a name for the damn hero 
i tol -PRON- that i didnot know except that -PRON- be the very young man and would -PRON- please leave -PRON- alone because i didnot want to be bother of new coffee agency opening wilbin the next two week man and woman will be give the opportunity to open up finepaye coffee agency right in -PRON- own home locality

there be no doubt about -PRON- 
-PRON- be to be see with one own eye 
in the western hemisphere the people on the atlantic coast see a swollen sun arise from the sea and distort by uneven refraction -PRON- rear above the horizon like a giant eye of doom 
-PRON- seem to fisherman stare awestruck over the water that this incredible sun that be four time large than usual hang for a moment as though too heavy to rise 
or as though -PRON- be gather strength for a titanic effort to pursue -PRON- ageless course despite increase mass 
there -PRON- hang for an instant 
then like a cosmic bloated leech swell by some nameless feast of celestial vampirism -PRON- shove -PRON- ponderous unbelievable bulk above sea level puff like a strained balloon insanely overgrown like a malignant toadstool this monster sun loom into the sky defile -PRON- pure dainty blue 
the fisherman have see many and in the back of -PRON- mind each many a sun swell by refraction during the dawn but never have -PRON- see such a huge orb spew from the eastern wave 
and when the passage of an hour fail to reduce this awful face destruction and only one person know that the world be come to an end nomenon and make -PRON- certain that -PRON- be to remain the fisherman frantically hoisted sail 
-PRON- only thought be to flee from this ominous thing 
face white beneath the saltspray tan -PRON- turn away and refuse to look again at the hideous enlarge globe of fire 
the leviathan sun flame -PRON- way up into the heaven 
-PRON- seem to man dare to match wit with the cosmos fuse the sky together so that -PRON- run molten in streak of ultramarine and glow yellow 
beneath -PRON- the ocean seem to lose -PRON- deep bluegreen and become crystal clear because of the pierce flood of ray from above 
then this stupendous sun as though lift -PRON- ponderously for all the people of that part of the world to see and a rise volume of fearful gasping cry seem to swell upward from million of throat 
the sun 
the sun be twice as wide as -PRON- should be 
-PRON- face be four time large than normal 
what in the name of all the god be happen 
the answer come to all to some insidiously to other hammeringly to yet other explosively the sun be fall down on earth 
or to the more scientificminded who be correct in little detail earth be fall into the sun 
einstein may have think for an instant if any man could be so detach in nature ah a chance to demonstrate the basic principle of relativity at one stroke to all the world 
for whichever way -PRON- put -PRON- sun onto earth or earth into sun the end result be the same great catastrophe and holocaust of the past pale into utter insignificance beside this one 
the great chicago fire the fouryear carnage of the world war even the legendary sinking of atlantis what be -PRON- compare to this world doom 
staggering million have be wipe out by the black plague of medieval time perhaps onethird of the exist population but here all all must die there would be no young generation to clean up and begin anew 
this be that inconceivable thing death for all 
the human mind no more than -PRON- can think upon -PRON- own personal death without an alarming unrest could not really grasp the thought of universal doom without go blank 
mind that do fully absorb the horrific think those mind go mad 
but in the majority of people a temporary barrier of delusionary amnesia keep -PRON- from realize what -PRON- mean when -PRON- crack lip speak out the doom 
one can imagine people walk around like shellshock victim mutter everyone be go to die everyone on earth and then grin foolishly at the absurdity 
yet in the back of -PRON- mind each person know know in such a horribly positive way that all be go to die the whole world at once and as one 
-PRON- run like a moan through the seared atmosphere everyone be go to die everyone be go to die 
everyone be go to die 
a william bay wisconsin a group of scientist both professional and academic get together at eight oclock in the morning of that day of doom 
some have drive up from chicago other have come by train and bus one have even fly up there to yerke observatory instinctively seek out astronomical authority 
the answer must be here 
yet for all -PRON- hope these man could not fail to notice that the air be tropically warm and the humidity almost insufferable 
even if earth do stop -PRON- mad plunge sunward the increase temperature would drive civilization toward the pole 
at last a murmur rise from the troubled crowd gather at the town small central park 
a huge car roll up and several figure step out almost before -PRON- have come to a stop 
a group of four make -PRON- way to the rostrum where on summer evening the municipal band give -PRON- concert 
the crowd quiet down as whitehaire portly professor hargreave second official of the yerke observatory nervously wipe -PRON- sweat face and confront -PRON- 
gentleman i this be an honor ridiculous word yet the crowd do not laugh or smile politely to -PRON- 
momus -PRON- god of laughter and merriment would have be powerless to wring a single chuckle from this grim daze crowd 
professor hargreave draw a long breath and continue well -PRON- all want to know what the official report on this this phenomenon be 
a murmur o anxious assent come from the audience 
well -PRON- seem that be dammit all gentleman -PRON- have no report 
and i donot know what -PRON- get -PRON- down here for in the first place 
do -PRON- expect that if -PRON- say the earth be not fall into the sun that the thing would promptly change back to normal 
what do -PRON- own eye tell -PRON- 
the crowd gasp and seem to huddle together 
about the only report i could give -PRON- be something -PRON- all know anyway 
that the sun apparent diameter be almost twice normal which mean that -PRON- have approach within fifty million mile 
-PRON- be too early yet to figure the rate at which earth be move -PRON- drev out the next word with an effort sunward but -PRON- must be at least at a speed of one thousand mile per second 
unbelievable as -PRON- seem -PRON- planet be already as close to the sun as mercury at -PRON- furth aphelion 
the lag in rise temperature which should result can be explain by -PRON- dense atmosphere which be act as a protective blanket 
but when the atmosphere become saturate with heat -PRON- break off as though the rest be too horrible and finish lamely that s all i can say -PRON- turn away with a gesture of dismissal 
the crowd stir but do not break up 
-PRON- seem reluctant to go away without some word of hope 
but what word of hope could there be be about to step off the platform half angry at have be cajole here to tell -PRON- that two plus two be four 
hardly anyone notice the calmface tall young man who thread -PRON- way toward the rostrum and finally step on -PRON- 
just a minute 
a hundred pair of eye swing about in surprise stare at -PRON- curiously 
the young man raise -PRON- yoice as -PRON- go on professor hargreave and gentleman i can tell -PRON- something about this phenomenon 
i can tell -PRON- for instance why earth be fall into the sun 
-PRON- can tell -PRON- why 
hargreave echo and all the crovd echo -PRON- word mentally 
yes 
the young man look at -PRON- blandly 
-PRON- seem perfectly at ease 
-PRON- pale a little though as -PRON- sense a sudden murderous mood arise in the group 
how do -PRON- dare to stand there calm and unafraid at a time like this 
-PRON- face become serious suddenly can give -PRON- a reason for this event -PRON- say earnestly 
fate thousand of mile away a drama concern not million of man but only two be be play in lonely isolation 
the steam furnace of the jungle have be around -PRON- for three day three sleepless gruele day 
at last cabel turn like an infuriated animal 
-PRON- gross bearded face sweaty and haggardly line vorke savagely 
damn -PRON- robinson -PRON- be kill -PRON- -PRON- pant suck in the hot miasmal air with strain lung 
no sleep for two night just march march march carry both -PRON- pack and when i want water -PRON- torture -PRON- with a few drop 
and these two bag of dust weigh a ton 
i tel -PRON- i canot i wonot go on 
the grin that come to young burt face be diabolic tell -PRON- -PRON- be kill -PRON- scream cabel make a desperate lunge 
burt sidestep with a short harsh laugh and pull out a pistol 
-PRON- be own gun 
cabel growling slide to one knee 
-PRON- make a futile attempt to hunch the double pack off -PRON- ache torment shoulder but knot hold as -PRON- have for three day 
the young man wipe -PRON- sweaty hand on -PRON- shirt then take from -PRON- pocket a fold piece of paper open -PRON- up 
in -PRON- clear script be the word i confess to the murder of william johnson with a knife own by mayla -PRON- native guide and porter whom i also murder 
sign ready to oblige rasp burt wave the paper 
cabel look up eye like fevered coal between the matted hair hang down over -PRON- forehead 
never damn -PRON- go to last this out robinson see if i donot have twenty year of jungle and -PRON- never beat -PRON- yet 
-PRON- donot come any tough than -PRON- 
come on 
cabel force -PRON- to rock leg and stagger along the fernclogge trail 
burt put avay the paper and follow 
immediately with -PRON- exertion the frightful heat clothe -PRON- in almost unendurable suffocation 
stab ray of the sun like molten bar of steel play a constant tattoo on -PRON- clothing whichalready seem on fire 
burt could not guess the temperature but -PRON- swear to -PRON- -PRON- be the hot day in history 
but this torture of heat do not bother -PRON- as much as the fact that cabel be bear up miraculously load short water ration and all 
burt frown 
before nightfall -PRON- would reach the river 
if cabel do not crack before then -PRON- may very well last -PRON- out 
the row up the river would not be as much of a grind as this jungle trek 
be cabel to win out in this grim game 
at camp three day before while burt have be out haul water from the spring cabel have knifed bill johnson in the back and then have shoot mayla the indian porter whose knife -PRON- have use 
burt robinson have be save by return unexpectedly by way of the rock path surprising cabel and get the drop on -PRON- 
burt have almost kill cabel in rage see agonize face but -PRON- could not kill a man even one like cabel in cold blood 
thereupon -PRON- have decide to wring from -PRON- a confession to insure -PRON- punishment by law up at koniko 
cabel have sneer confidently 
then -PRON- have start on this journey into inferno with burt carry the two gun and promise cabel the bad fiveday hell -PRON- have ever imagine 
burt have no pity for the stumble moan man ahead of -PRON- 
pity for -PRON- 
for three year -PRON- cabel and bill johnson and faithful mayla have work -PRON- bonanza 
have sweat toil laugh side by side 
-PRON- have pan -PRON- dry well hide creek bed for one hundred and fifty thousand dollar in dust and small nugget 
enough for all 
plenty hen cabel greedridden have reveal the cupidity -PRON- have hold in check for those three year 
-PRON- have plan the triple murder know a story of attack by wild indian back by a generous heap of dust would carry at koniko 
what incredible fortitude keep cabel on -PRON- foot after this threeday eternity of hellfire 
even burt unencumbered feel -PRON- on the verge of sunstroke 
and -PRON- be young strong than cabel 
the two man cross an open patch of lushgrown ground and here the sun beat down with hammer of blind flame 
burt could not resist a maddened urge to curse the fiery orb above 
a huge stinging drop of sweat touch one eyeball burn -PRON- so that -PRON- have to rub -PRON- eye clear but -PRON- look again 
and again raise -PRON- hand and peer through the finger 
-PRON- lip make a soundless exclamation of amazement 
cabel be move on doggedly head hang 
when -PRON- have cross the clearing burt call a halt 
cabel throw -PRON- pack and all on the sawgrass beside the trail pant like a spend fox 
-PRON- bloodshot eye peer up mockingly from between the steaming tangle of -PRON- hair as burt stand over -PRON- 
haul out 3our little paper sonny sneer cabel so i can spit at -PRON- -PRON- draw the flap of leather that be -PRON- tongue between -PRON- crack lip burt look down at the murderer 
cabel -PRON- say saw off the word -PRON- wonot live to enjoy the fortune -PRON- make go to face -PRON- maker with blood fresh on -PRON- hand stow -PRON- croak cabel 
-PRON- havenot the spunk to kill -PRON- 
cabel look at the sun 
the murderer peer upward toward the sun 
-PRON- first careless glance change to a wideeye stare 
an exclamation rip from -PRON- heatlacerate lip 
good god the matter with the sun -PRON- gasp the heat get -PRON- -PRON- look too big 
the heat go to get -PRON- -PRON- mean hiss burt steamily 
cabel do -PRON- know what that mean that -PRON- see 
-PRON- mean the earth be fall into the sun 
-PRON- must have be go on for hour maybe day but -PRON- didnot notice 
except that i think -PRON- will agree this have be the hot three day -PRON- have ever have even in this sinkhole haggard face show -PRON- abysmal fear 
-PRON- canot be -PRON- mumble swallow with a throat that have nothing to swallow 
maybe -PRON- a a mirage 
whatever -PRON- be retort burt grimly go on between heaven and earth not go to let up on -PRON- 
get go 
burt drive the murderer along pitilessly see at last a chance to break -PRON- 
let -PRON- torture mind labor under the two burden of secret murder and a burn doom while the ache sweat physical grind tear -PRON- nerve to shred 
when the afternoon sun a huge bloated orb reach -PRON- peak of hellish intensity cabel break 
scream like a madman -PRON- fling -PRON- tremblingly under a tree as if to hide from the pitiless sun grow -PRON- babble see -PRON- with -PRON- own eye never heat like this before come down on -PRON- why do i kill johnson 
blood 
bbod -PRON- confession be sign 
-PRON- go on with burt carry -PRON- own pack 
burt have give cabel -PRON- fill of water 
-PRON- be not till an hour later that burt realize the murderer have crack completely 
-PRON- listen horrified as the broken man in front hiss damn -PRON- sun -PRON- wonot get -PRON- go to hang -PRON- and burt robinson row a grinning vacanteyed cabel up the river feel for the first time in full force the stunning realization of doom 
-PRON- have avenge the murder of -PRON- friend but to what avail if -PRON- can believe -PRON- gentleman earnestly finish the young man in knicker 
the crowd have not stir since -PRON- first have begin to speak 
just who be -PRON- demand professor hargreave 
well nobody confess the young man with a wry grin 
that be -PRON- name isnot know except to -PRON- friend and relative and the minister who baptize -PRON- 
the name be terry blackwell an amateur astronomer use an eightinch refractor homemade mount neither here nor there puffy florid face be grim sweatbeaded 
the thing be what proof have -PRON- for -PRON- ah quite harebrained explanation of this unprecedented phenomenon 
proof 
terry blackwell frown a bit have proof of sort 
that be i have a series of photograph of the etherstrain in the past three month of -PRON- approach toward the sun 
professor hargreave look at -PRON- sternly 
and -PRON- didnot reveal this knowledge or theory at least of -PRON- till this last fatal moment 
a look of angry pain come into the young man eye 
this morning at a m 
i try to get an audience at yerke -PRON- say slowly be refuse admittance 
a month ago i write a letter to yerke offer to show -PRON- photograph but the reply vas a cold refusal sign by -PRON- -PRON- be not easy i can assure -PRON- for an amateur to gain a hearing 
the yerke astronomer flush deeply 
hargreave remember the letter vaguely and recall too that -PRON- have chuckle over -PRON- 
strange how little thing could turn up with the devastating force of a hurricane in the sweep of tumultuous event 
well wel see -PRON- photograph say hargreave at last gruffly 
where be -PRON- 
at -PRON- home geneva hour drive respond terry 
perhaps -PRON- would well hurry 
hurry yes agree the astronomer jerk -PRON- up 
come -PRON- car 
star in -PRON- course before robert phd have say believe -PRON- ten year of research be come to a head 
atomic power lie just ahead 
six month before -PRON- have state the power of the atom can be release by a suitable concentration of cosmic ray 
one month before -PRON- have cry excitedly look vogel -PRON- artificial cosmic ray already have the power to split the nitrogen atom 
a week before -PRON- have speak nervously vogel i dare not try -PRON- 
who know but vhat the release of total energy in even a thimbleful of gas may be the fuse to set the whole world aflame 
but what be -PRON- go to do 
vogel have ask 
forget -PRON- for the time be have mutter 
control atomic energy would be the world great blessing 
but escape -PRON- would be worlddestruction 
since i donot know whether -PRON- be controllable with -PRON- ionize screen have to work out a sure method 
there can be no halfcocked guesswork with this demonforce 
and with assistance have begin what may well be the task of year to find a quencher that would as easily snuff atomic power as water put out flame 
then something have occur to put a new face on the whole thing 
vogel have announce -PRON- with a dazed expressionlessness have listen with a detach curiosity 
come come man scoff at last 
what be -PRON- try to say that the earth be fall into the sun donot know how else vogel say doggedly -PRON- can explain the sun be four time or more -PRON- usual size 
why -PRON- be serious state then -PRON- dash outside -PRON- laboratory home to see for -PRON- 
everything be light by an unnatural brightness this hot morning 
people hurry here and there with fear on -PRON- face put up -PRON- hand and squint at the sun between -PRON- finger 
-PRON- be unmistakably a large sun than have ever shine on earth in the history of man 
what do -PRON- think sir 
vogel ask when -PRON- go back inside 
-PRON- lip tremble 
-PRON- wipe perspiration from -PRON- forehead think -PRON- splendid retort vithout sarcasm 
vogel stare 
but professor -PRON- mean the doom of all earth everyone be go to die 
exactly everyone be go to die 
the old scientist look speculatively at -PRON- young assistant 
vogel do -PRON- think -PRON- would make much difference if everyone die a few hour beforehand 
would -PRON- for instance care much if -PRON- die now or three day later if in both case the deatn be inevitable 
sir i donot understand i fool bark in quick temper 
naturally the quick death be the more desirable 
death -PRON- be not so terrify the suspense of wait for -PRON- be far bad that so 
yes sir 
but -PRON- donot know for sure the earth will plunge all the way to the sun 
-PRON- may stop somewhere and take up a new orbit 
that -PRON- must find out vogel 
i want -PRON- to call up all the newspaper office and radio station and ask for official report if any 
-PRON- eye hold a peculiar light 
in the meantime -PRON- whirl on the motionless dazed vogel 
well -PRON- roar 
the young assistant run like a frightened rabbit 
a half hour later -PRON- seek the scientist and find -PRON- down in the basement workroom try everywhere vogel announce there have be no official report from anywhere 
the newspaper office have plead with yerke for a statement but -PRON- refuse as yet eye still have a peculiar glint in -PRON- 
do -PRON- know what that mean vogel 
-PRON- refusal to report mean -PRON- fear the vorst 
the earth be go to fall into the sun call -PRON- mother too murmur vogel bite -PRON- lip to hold back a scream that press in -PRON- throat 
-PRON- want -PRON- to come home frightened i guess 
may i go sir 
yes of course of course 
the old scientist tone be preoccupy 
-PRON- be busily engage in examine the large electrical apparatus in the center of the room 
professor what do -PRON- mean a while ago when -PRON- ask if i would prefer er death now or later 
nothing 
nothing at all hum the aged scientist 
-PRON- look up fiercely as the assistant stand there 
well 
vogel leave with the echo of that peremptory roar 
as soon as the assistant left run to the door lock -PRON- 
then -PRON- gaze at the apparatus with eagerness 
here be the machine that could rend asunder a mere puff of gas and extract from -PRON- untold power 
but the proof of -PRON- lie in the trying and so far -PRON- have not dare try 
-PRON- have not dare to increase the intensity of -PRON- artificial cosmic ray beam to the point where -PRON- would not merely knock electron loose from gas atom but disrupt the nucfei -PRON- 
in the nucleus lie the inconceivable hammer of atomic power 
-PRON- cosmic ray be the hand that would wield that hammer heart begin to pound madly an hour later when the apparatus have be make quite ready 
one twist of that red dial and a titan would leap from the machine 
but would -PRON- screen of ionize mercury hold the vortex of potential force 
or would -PRON- burst free and hesitate at the last minute 
-PRON- mind revolve again the train of thought that have bring -PRON- this far 
earth be doom by an inexplicable fail toward the sun 
if the vortex escape and accomplish -PRON- progressive disintegration of the earth -PRON- would simply be a quick doom 
but what if earth be not doom by the sun 
sweat feel -PRON- mind whirl 
the drive allconsuming urge of ten year of strive toward this goal gather -PRON- and roll forward like a juggernaut in -PRON- mind mow down all other consideration 
atomic power 
control atomic power or holocaust 
the low powerful hum of the internal transformer seem to beat time to -PRON- throbbing thought dial seem to stare at -PRON- like watch eye 
watch this man who have fate in -PRON- hand 
power or destruction 
which would -PRON- be grasp the red dial with a nervous hand 
the die be cast 
with a savage finality -PRON- twist the rheostat control 
-PRON- stagger back as a tremendous shock rock the floor 
the whine of great power sing through the apparatus close -PRON- eye wait for the microcosmic explosion that would destroy a world 
but the machine hum steadily on -PRON- run to the dial face alight 
-PRON- tell -PRON- story the story of ten billion watt accumulate within the mercury chamber 
and -PRON- have hold 
-PRON- have succeed in produce control atomic power 
the earth have a legacy of endless costless power ground the mercury chamber daze in -PRON- triumph and watch the dial show the slow outpouring of ten billion watt into the capacious bosom of earth suddenly -PRON- face contort horribly 
-PRON- eye swam in a film of bloodtear 
for in this moment of victory a temporarily forget thought sweep over -PRON- with crush fury 
irony of irony 
-PRON- have give this great gift to a world that would have no chance to use -PRON- 
for the earth be plunge into the sun 
terry blackwell shuffle through the pack of print and finally pick out one 
-PRON- hand -PRON- to professor about the good i take terry say 
-PRON- show quite clearly the distortion of the star field especially around -PRON- edge 
hargreave wipe a rivulet of sweat from -PRON- cheek take the print eagerly 
-PRON- show a small portion of the night sky with an appreciable dusting of star 
just below center be noticeable a small patch in which the star run in curve streak to form a circle 
within that circle the star image be superimpose on one another to form a mottled design 
the rest of these print continue terry show the three month progress of the etherstrain among the background of constellation as -PRON- slowly but surely approach the sun 
i do not know how close -PRON- be till one night -PRON- occult jupiter that be -PRON- throw image about three minute of arc out of place 
then i know -PRON- be comparatively close to earth hargreave and the official with -PRON- look over the print carefully 
one of the official say finally this be a fault in the lens of -PRON- camera or in -PRON- telescope 
strangely -PRON- be hargreave who take part then 
no because the distortion take different position in the print which could not be explain that way 
besides besides 
i seem to recall that several print be ruin recently up at the observatory by distortion exactly like these 
-PRON- think -PRON- be in the photographic paper and throw -PRON- away right say one of the official remember that one print be ruin by a fault in scorpio about a month ago june sixth to be exact confirm terry hold up the print for that date 
if the group have have any serious doubt leave -PRON- vanish utterl when this photograph show the tail of scorpio twist out of place 
hargreave look at terry with something of deep respect 
young man -PRON- say excitedly think there isnot any doubt about -PRON- any more 
incredible as -PRON- seem -PRON- etherstrain theory must be right 
-PRON- plunge into the solar system or rather the solar system meet up with -PRON- and as a result -PRON- all knev the result a great menacing sun that have apparently burst -PRON- linear bond and become a threat of doom over a world of creature who be in the last analysis less bind by the law of man than the law of nature 
before a blanket of censorship have muff the blaring of radio commentator an hour before there have be stark report of rioting hundred suicidal thousand hysterical million in europe which have already view the brobdingnagian sun for twelve hour 
what be happen in america the lord only know 
hargreave glance at -PRON- watch 
-PRON- be ten oclock 
wipe off the sweat sprinkle over -PRON- boiledlooking skin with a limp and already saturate handkerchief -PRON- gasp telephone 
quickly 
sunrise jose estaban be calm and proud with -PRON- back against the high stone wall of the prison courtyard 
if there be any mental worm gnaw at -PRON- brain -PRON- do not show on -PRON- saturnine face with -PRON- mocking smile 
-PRON- have be that way the night before during the hasty military trial 
the solemn dark face of the enemy have fill with hate as -PRON- turn to -PRON- 
there have be the forma recital of -PRON- many act of espionage 
then the face have turn to triumphant glee as the headofficer pronounce the sentence in cold harsh tone jose estaban know as el disblo espia -PRON- crime against the nation of bolivia merit death 
fucilado a la solida del sol -PRON- will be shoot at sunrise 
jose estaban look up and see the rosy finger of approach dawn tremble through the gloom 
the ten man of the guard at an order from -PRON- captain make a right turn on -PRON- heel and march toward the farther wall against which lie ten rifle 
jose stare stolidly ahead 
el capitan stalk up 
blindfold senor 
-PRON- tender a black cloth 
jose smile the saturnine smile that have win -PRON- the name of the devil spy 
save -PRON- mi capitan -PRON- murmur softly for mourn when el chaco boreal the land for which -PRON- fight pass into the hand of paraguay 
brave word for a dead man leer the captain 
-PRON- whirl and to a position beside the ten rifleman 
as -PRON- glance impatiently out the east gate for the sun -PRON- lieutenant speak in -PRON- ear would -PRON- not be good mi capitan to have the man fire right now even though the sun have not yet rise lest -PRON- escape in some way 
the puerco will not escape 
five time before be -PRON- capture and five time -PRON- escape remind the underofficer 
-PRON- roll -PRON- eye superstitiously 
-PRON- say the devil -PRON- watch over this man 
caramba 
look how -PRON- grin as -PRON- stand there as though -PRON- expect not to die but to have the laugh over -PRON- 
the man be nervous too and silence perro hiss the bolivian captain 
there be no miracle can save -PRON- 
-PRON- will wait for a punctual sun to give the signal of -PRON- death 
but as the slow minute pass in ominous silence with the flush of nearsunrise grow in strength even the toughsoule captain become nervous 
the man fidget shuffle -PRON- foot 
the lieutenant stand with mouth half open as if prepare at any moment to see the devil -PRON- arrive and whisk -PRON- protege away 
for el diablo espia have be almost a myth for two year one whose activity have be devilishly cunne 
in the gloom the spys eye seem to gleam like small fire 
-PRON- lip be curl in mockery 
suddenly -PRON- eye flick to the eastgate and widen slightly 
for there -PRON- see a girl white arm strain to tear down the solid bar of steel 
at the same time the tip of the sun peep over the horizon and a shaft of brightness spear into the shadowy courtyard 
el capitan await this signal raise an arm 
the rifleman bring up -PRON- gun take aim 
a scream intercept the word fucil the bolivian captain glance toward the gate see the girl and motion for the man to lower -PRON- rifle 
el capitan be of the old school with chivalry deeply imbed in -PRON- nature 
-PRON- stride toward the girl at the eastgate 
senorita i beg of -PRON- to depart for the time 
-PRON- be no pretty sight this 
particularly for so charm a girl eye aflame the girl speak tremulously mi capitan please do not kill this man 
make -PRON- a prisoner instead till the war be over catamba 
be -PRON- mad 
-PRON- be -PRON- nation bad enemy 
then let -PRON- go to -PRON- die with -PRON- plead the girl wildly love -PRON- i shelter -PRON- for many day before -PRON- be capture so i be a traitor to bolivia 
do -PRON- hear 
-PRON- must kill -PRON- with -PRON- because i be a traitor 
diablo 
that be impossible senorita 
i will not believe -PRON- 
more -PRON- be foolishness 
-PRON- can not die with -PRON- 
then let -PRON- be with -PRON- for a tiny moment i will do anything anything if -PRON- will grant -PRON- that 
the stern look on the face dissolve to reflection 
-PRON- love this man si 
-PRON- will do anything to be with -PRON- for a moment si 
-PRON- will perhaps let -PRON- do all in -PRON- power to comfort -PRON- afterward 
comprendo lovely one 
soft black eye tragic the girl nod 
let -PRON- in to -PRON- and -PRON- will not regret -PRON- 
grin in satisfaction the captain call for one of -PRON- man to open the steel gate 
but one minute i will give -PRON- -PRON- admonish the girl 
like a bird seek -PRON- nest the girl run to jose enfold -PRON- in tremble arm 
the doom man lift up -PRON- face kiss -PRON- tenderly 
in some afterlife -PRON- will be reunite nina 
-PRON- love can not die 
-PRON- cling to one another fiercely for a moment then jose push -PRON- away firmly

a flood of ray from the east gate now light up the tableau with supernal brightness 
the girl white clothe seem to expand into a blaze cloak that hide the man behind

but only one bullet be fire that of el capitan and -PRON- fail to stop the fly man even though -PRON- make a trail of spatter blood over the grey cobblestone 
the rest of the man stand stare toward the eastgate watch el diablo espia escape from -PRON- 
-PRON- be not -PRON- -PRON- watch however 
-PRON- be the incredible thing beyond heir widen dazed eye behold the enormous bulk of an enchant sun now hang just over the horizon 
-PRON- be the color of the droplet of blood that mark the escape spys trail 
misshapen by refraction -PRON- float there like the gargantuan heart of some celestial cyclop 
cloud wisps scurrying by make -PRON- seem to pulsate with nameless life 
-PRON- be a wizard trick and the bolivian rifleman as -PRON- reel back in fright have no doubt that -PRON- be the doing of the devil -PRON- to insure the escape of -PRON- ward the devil spy 
professor hargreave slam down the receiver in disgust get washington for love or money -PRON- say explosively suppose every crank and fool in the country be on the wire

in the meantime try to get a call on the phone through so one of the three of -PRON- ought to get -PRON- message across 
get go man 
the tvro man dash out face set in determination 
hargreave turn immediately to the telephone bark into -PRON- viciously 
when long distance have complete -PRON- connection -PRON- rap dr morris birge director of biology hurry over -PRON- shoulder -PRON- say half mumblingly to terry a government man 
agricultural bureau

for a moment -PRON- listen then hang up slowly 
-PRON- eye be pain as -PRON- turn to terry 
suicide -PRON- mutter dazedly 
an hour ago swallow a dose of curare 
-PRON- friend 
one night -PRON- confide in -PRON- that -PRON- wild passionate youth weigh heavily on -PRON- mind 
but for -PRON- to the astronomer eye change suddenly 
-PRON- grab up the phone again hopefully 
a few minute later -PRON- jump to -PRON- foot with a curse 
velter dead too -PRON- groan 
shoot this morning during a jailbreak at joliet prison 
-PRON- be a hot on the trail of somebody down there 
now -PRON- s go too 
i donot know who to try next for a contact at the white house 
but i must have -PRON- 
maybe i can help cry terry 
-PRON- continue at gruff well

just down the street 
if -PRON- s home come on shouted hargreave push -PRON- bulk toward the door at an actual run 
-PRON- go out into the hot afternoon 
since dawn the overgrown sun have increase -PRON- girth by another diameter 
-PRON- be now nine time as large in face area as normally 
the heat teem insufferable the house there point terry and a moment later -PRON- be pant up the step of a broad shaded verandah 
pray god -PRON- s here exclaim hargreave fervently 
cosmic laughter god of irony look down on 
earth that day and laugh 
-PRON- see a world of creature disturb from -PRON- normal pursuit of life and -PRON- be funny to watch -PRON- painful antic

the god of irony laugh louder 
a young man up all night in -PRON- shabby rentdue room bitterly convince that life be not worth live if one could not work and eat withdraw the fatal blade from near -PRON- throat at the sound of outside shouting that come with the dawn and when learn of the sundoom curse the fate that be inevitably go to end -PRON- life while -PRON- be so young 
after three day and night of unselfish sleepless labor -PRON- rescue tunnel reach the cavein and -PRON- bring up the bury miner in the dawn of that fateful day and -PRON- tear of joy and relief change into a rage curse when -PRON- learn that -PRON- have escape one doom only to be in time for another

brush back -PRON- long hair the starve poet again invade the office of the news 
this time the weary editor accept some of -PRON- work think any junk will do for a filler today 
and at the same time that the poet inwardly exult perhaps at long last -PRON- see what i be try to say 
maybe this be a beginning for -PRON- the god of irony be now double up with uncontrollable mirth 
a prima donna throw back -PRON- head and sing to the small musicthirsty audience sing as never before sing in the face of certain doom gloriously triumphantly with magnificent defiance strangely free of the haunting fear that -PRON- voice be fail 
for the first time in month yearsshe be give a performance of real brilliance a performance that be to go down into oblivion 
destine to produce a masterpiece an author scribble away madly all day in -PRON- locked room unaware of the doom that threaten to make -PRON- production worthless 
a the janitor awake with great joy in -PRON- heart for the day before -PRON- have cash in -PRON- sweepstake ticket and today -PRON- would begin spend -PRON- in glorious abandonment but an hour later little light of madness come into -PRON- eye as the overbrilliant sunlight shine on a fistful of green paper with number on -PRON- 
the god of irony cast -PRON- merry eye over the rest of the world to see what other insanely amusing thing there be among these queer being who have mind and imagination 
down in africa two war bloodthirsty tribe spend the day watch the fantastic puff sun with superstitious eye but as night come -PRON- fall to -PRON- fighting with unabated vigor in the light of a full moon

senator jam jordan come to the door in a maroon bathrobe over pajama whose brilliantly stripe pant leg show at the bottom 
-PRON- yawn 
up late last night or this e -PRON- explain with an apologetic grin away 
guess alone in the house 
funny mrs riggs -PRON- housekeeper hasnot show up yet 
damn hot this morning 
well what can i do for -PRON- gentleman -PRON- start as -PRON- look again at -PRON- face 
say what s up 
-PRON- two look like the end of the world be come 
not -PRON- two the world look like that say hargreave dryly 
-PRON- point through the foliage of the tall tree that shade the porch 
look at that sun sleepy look change to startled bewilderment with the speed of a lightning flash 
-PRON- rub -PRON- eye look again then turn dazedly to -PRON- visitor 
the earth be fall into the sun the earth be fall into the sun of course say hargreave impatiently perhaps a little sneeringy at the senator helplessness -PRON- who could harangue election crowd for hour over nothing at all a story benind this that i canot go into now too short 
what here for be a telephone connection with the white house 
in fact with the president -PRON- or secretary of war or somebody in high authority 
senator get to have -PRON- 
what can -PRON- do 
the senator manage to shake off -PRON- bewilderment and to quell the icy panic in -PRON- heart 
-PRON- put through a call on the phone when -PRON- have enter the house 
after forty minute of sweat shout bluster effort while hargreave and terry stand by anxiously jordan announce that -PRON- have the secretary of office on the wire 
hargreave grab the phone eagerly begin speak with the vord come out in a tumble 
in a period of twentyfour hour the incredible overgrown sun have reveal -PRON- to all the people of earth from greenwich to far india from the arctic to the antipode 
and as -PRON- climb the sky -PRON- grow ever large and fiercer and in like degree the people fear grow large and fiercer 
for a while thing go calmly 
century and age of civilizing restraint become a bulvark against rise terror and madness 
authority broadcast soothing but unconvincing statement that the earth would undoubtedly take up a new orbit 
there be little case of violence and madness here and there that grow with the rapidity of an explosion 
a reign of terror start 
the less page the depression over 
again this be the land of opportunity 
every day -PRON- see alert young man be skyrocket to the top -PRON- wonder what the secret be 
well many thing go to make up success 
but one thing be absolutely necessary 
good health 
and constipation be contrary to perfect health 
-PRON- can rob -PRON- of look energy ambition likely to pass up opportunity liable to miss the boat 
so if -PRON- want to step up -PRON- energy f -PRON- want a quick mind and a healthy body remember this one thing ee that -PRON- bowel move regularly 
but the way -PRON- move -PRON- bowel be important 
instead of take a laxative that disturb -PRON- system and upset -PRON- stomach take gentle exlax 
exlax limit -PRON- action entirely to the intestine where the actual constipation exist 
-PRON- give the intestine a gentle nudge empty the bowel thoroughly but easily and comfortably 
exlax in such a simple commonsense way 
and -PRON- be such a pleasure to take 
exlax taste just like delicious chocolate 
at all drug store 10c and 25c 
canada 15c and 35c strain more panicky element of population cast all judgment to the wind and become maddened beast 
bloodshed and violence spread -PRON- gory finger over the world 
a tidal wave of insanity suicide and lawlessness follow the giant sun around the planet 
the puny barrier of law and order sufficient ordinarily be as though nonexistent before this new wave of worldpanic 
everyone be go to die that be the terrible sword that begin to lay civilization low 
if everyone be go to die in a few hour or day what do anything matter what do law and order and morality mean nothing in the face of this cataclysmic doom 
-PRON- be a black page in the history of civilization that day 
as the supersun rise to midday height over any certain longitude the masse underneath launch into reckless career 
each do as -PRON- bury inclination dictate without regard for other 
the most secret of inhibition come to light of day 
murder rapine insanity stalk the land 
fire riots mob violence swell the day mad doing 
feat of heroism and sacrifice occur side by side with unnameable atrocity spring up and grevz to giddy height in the course of a few hour 
unnumbered home be empty whose occupant would never again come back 
thousand of child cry piteously for parent who be dead or miss 
saint be bear that day and devil 
a legion of good samaritan struggle to allay the pain and torture and misfortune that ride the world roughshod 
there be those who preach and those who comfort and those who spread calm like oil on troubled wave 
but there be those many who sadistically set about display -PRON- twist mental complex 
a nd over -PRON- all ride the monster sun symbol of doom 
-PRON- actual effect be more mental than anything for neither the increase heat or light could account for what go on 
-PRON- be just -PRON- constant inexorable insidious presence overhead that press on shocked brain 
an earthquake strike the heart with sharp terror but leave the mind free to think ahead to eventual escape bar bad luck 
but this immense sun this sun of doom grow ever large suck the earth into -PRON- maw of superflame leave no room for hope 
from the pulpit -PRON- be call the judgment sun come down to fulfill the prophecy of the day of doom 
the way thing be go the civilized world would be a shamble by evening of that first day 
what -PRON- would be the next day no one dare speculate 
the final unthinkable picture be that of a planet half of whose population be dead and the other half insane plunge sunward 
and where be the word of hope 
where be an atlas to come to the rescue and hold up the fall heaven 
or be earth inevitably doom 
at about one oclock in the middle of the hemisphere a concerted gasp go up from the land 
a spark have be ignite at yerke and spread from there like wildfire 
a second spark have grow at washington and -PRON- great flood of wave span the atlantic and later the pacific 
the pulse that begin to beat strongly at washington set up resonant pulse in london paris berlin moscow and finally bombay hongkong tokyo sydney capetown 
from these center the bless spark spread from city to city from community to community by radio telegraph telephone and the print page 
a great hush come over earth 
-PRON- furious travail cease 
dazed eye dim with tear 
tear heart cease to bleed 
shriek turn to soft sob 
terror give way to relief 
fear vanish into shame 
people whisper the news to one another earth be not doom the increase size of the sun be an illusion there be nothing to worry about 
end of the doom -PRON- prayer of thank that arise from million of heart must have inundate the elysian shore of heaven above 
but the god of irony laugh most over this for -PRON- have see the grim play in all history enact with a backdrop of illusion 
-PRON- have watch scientist take heat measurement early in the day and find a barely noticeable increase in the average heat 
-PRON- have try to have make triangulation calculation that night with the planet and have find nothing change from normal 
but -PRON- message although faster than the course around earth have make no impression for wasnot -PRON- likely that all the planet as well as earth be fall toward the sun 
numerous other little thing each sufficient in -PRON- to prove the illusion to the reason mind reveal the cosmic hoax gravity and tide observation light pressure test the paradoriical exactness of sunrise 
but -PRON- have go unheede these prophet of the illusion for in one sntermolecular life threaten to subjugate earth a complete novelette of world within world by in the issue spread the word that earth could not be nearer the sun but to no avail 
by a mad coincidence that fateful day have be one of the hot of the year 
the imagination of man mind have swell the temperature to unreasone height 
see be believe never before have that platitude be demonstrate with more irresistible force 
observatory in asia vhich continent have first see the phenonienon detail -PRON- have all fail in -PRON- message to unreasoning multitude 
not one of -PRON- have think to give a reason for the illusion 
terry explanation owe -PRON- sudden universal acceptance to the fact that -PRON- account for the illusion as well as name -PRON- such 
terry blackwell find -PRON- a world figure by midnight 
save from further terror relieve of black heartchille despair the population demand a hero of worship for the soothing message of peace 
-PRON- try to escape -PRON- but at midnight find -PRON- stand before a microphone on a worldwide hookup 
what shall i say gulp terry nervously 
professor hargreave smile indulgently 
-PRON- doesnot matter much what -PRON- say 
-PRON- could say and -PRON- would take -PRON- for pearly wisdom 
but -PRON- may as well give the world a resume of -PRON- whole theory just about as -PRON- give -PRON- up at yerke this morning 
but the theory be wild guesswork plead terry 
-PRON- happen to account for the illusion by luck perhaps not a real scientist at all 
if -PRON- be not a real scientist like to meet one say hargreave 
-PRON- signal to the commentator 
the latter who have be frantically wave for -PRON- to approach the microphone and have be fill the time with the usual playup sigh in relief 
people of earth -PRON- conclude realize the tremendousness of the occasion in that phrase people of earth i give -PRON- now mr terry blackwell the young man who this day prove the great illusion and gentleman -PRON- be about three month ago terry begin that i photograph saturn with -PRON- eightinch refractor telescope 
the print show a small faint distortion in one corner 
the next night i try again and find an identical fault in the photograph 
from then on with more luck than skill i succeed in trail the almost unnoticeable distortion photographically as -PRON- move across the star 
-PRON- be quite invisible by visual observation 
i follow -PRON- with photography for those three month and unmistakably -PRON- grow large and more pronounced one evening -PRON- cama abreast of jupiter magnify -PRON- and throw -PRON- out of line as well as the immediate field of star 
that indicate that this giysterious enigma be close to -PRON- already between earth and jupiter 
not have the necessary mathematical skill to plot -PRON- course i have no idea -PRON- would eventually come between earth and sun 
but -PRON- do and in do so cause the enlargement of the sun -PRON- have observe 
about a week ago i start seriously think of an explanation for -PRON- 
what strange thing at least the size of the sun transparent but highly refractive could be drift through space 
since -PRON- be completely uncatalogue in modern science i have a clear field in which to speculate 
as a result work out a theory for -PRON- which later scientific research may modify but -PRON- be this somewhere and sometime in the cosmos a dense and dark star like the companion of sirius collide with another large star and vas knock out of -PRON- normal orbit in the universe or fuse with -PRON- to become a nova 
this dead star must have be incredibly dense perhaps half compose of neutronium which weigh sixty million ton to the cubic inch 
and -PRON- gravitational field must have be immeasureably strong than any -PRON- know 
so strong in fact terry draw a long breath and continue for -PRON- know that hundred of astronomer and other scientist would be listen so strong in fact that the warp -PRON- produce in space become permanent thus when the dead star -PRON- be knock away the etherstrain -PRON- have make go on in the old orbit 
like the shell of a nut continue to exist long after the kernel which grevy -PRON- have be eat awav by worm 
the collision -PRON- may have happen untold trillion of year ago and perhaps in some other galaxy 
but the etherstrain pursue -PRON- lone course unaffected by the law that govern the rest of the universe and come finally to -PRON- galaxy and -PRON- solar system 
by deduction from -PRON- low velocity -PRON- must have enter the solar system within the orbit of pluto about five year ago but -PRON- would have be impossible to detect -PRON- then for even so bright an object as the sun look merely like a star from distance 
and this etherstrain be absolutely invisible 
-PRON- be not detectable till -PRON- have approach quite near within onehalf billfbn mile and then only as a faint smudge on a sensitive photographic plate 
so -PRON- may be say that the etherstrain sneak up on -PRON- like an invisible snake 
i count -PRON- only as great good luck that i happen to catch -PRON- on -PRON- plate since -PRON- only take up about one millionth of the total sky area 
after enter the solar system and because -PRON- velocity relative to the sun be just a little more than orbital velocity -PRON- contrive to hang in between earth and sun for these many hour 
-PRON- huge area be very gradually draw ahead of the earth and will in a few hour undoubtedly clear away 
there be only one thing leave to mention and explain the way -PRON- magnify the sun image 
the effect of such a magnification will be understand if -PRON- be compare to a telescope lens with a high refractive index but a very long focus 
like a giant handglass this sphere of warped space hang between the direct ray of the sun and earth and bend the light ray to a focus for earthly eye 
the etherstrain have the ability to bend light in accordance with law but in a great degree than ever observe before because -PRON- warp of space be great than -PRON- have ever know 
paradoxically this warp do not have any gravitational influence as -PRON- should have for einstein say the force of gravity be simply a curvature of space 
this can be explain by assume that when space have be abnormally warp -PRON- gravitational effect link into a closed circle no longer able to exert external influence 
and so conclude terry this extremely startling phenomenon in -PRON- sky today have be merely an optical illusion 
hargreave have a moment before -PRON- receive a paper from the announcer 
-PRON- step before the microphone as terry back away 
the kioto observatory in japan -PRON- read report that the sun that have just rise over -PRON- land be once again normal 
the phenomenon last exactly twentyeight hour 
next issue a complete novelette of an dimensional travel into the future by and many other story why gamble when -PRON- buy razor blade -PRON- get la probak jr the product of the world large blade maker at the sensational low price of for buy a package today and enjoy the thrill of perfect shave 
the thrice in the annal of man the human race be face with extinction 
by microscopic giant dive deep etc author or link in the chain of humanity -PRON- sentinel of the tree people crouch in the high branch of -PRON- communal dwelling place and stare fearfully toward the west 
beneath -PRON- the activity of the tree village be still 
man woman and child crouch on quiver haunch each near a tree bole up which quick ascent could be make if necessary 
the string of tough vine crudely fasten from tree to tree make a sort of rough platform thirty foot above the teem ground be empty 
the hairy mightythewe folk crouch and stare as the sentinel in the treetop above do toward the west 
there where the whitehot sun be die be the danger source 
from there death come death on two colossal hind leg tower as high as a tree -PRON- 
when the hairy tree people build -PRON- aerial village thirty foot above the deathinfested ground -PRON- have hope to know a new safety 
for a while -PRON- have 
the sabertoothed tiger the monstrous serpent the great bear be baffle by that height 
-PRON- could be beat off by stone ax and club before -PRON- reach -PRON- 
but this new menace which threaten the very race make a mockery of -PRON- sanctuary 
in the high branch of the conifer tree in the center of the aerial village crouch taljuck the quick 
near -PRON- be the gorillalike form of ank strong man of the tribe thick lip move and guttural chattering sound be articulate through -PRON- heavy protrude jaw 
-PRON- be not language -PRON- be a series of symbolic sound paint simple picture of the mind 
-PRON- think the great one will come on this sundeath 
taljuck grunt 
-PRON- jaw be not quite so bestial as those of the other hairy folk 
-PRON- forehead be a little high -PRON- eye a little clear 
-PRON- enormous hairy hand tighten on the odd contrivance -PRON- have make during the last four day 
who can say 
sometimes the great one come sometimes -PRON- do not 
but when -PRON- do come -PRON- be always at this hour muddy brutish eye go to the queer invention in hand 
-PRON- be go to try that on the great one 
yes 
if -PRON- come look at the new weapon bear of -PRON- brain 
fierce pride be in -PRON- eye 
-PRON- be a tough curved length of wood nearly four inch through 
from end to end of this be a tiger tendon scrape as thick as -PRON- little finger 
a long straight stick with a sharp stone be tie to one end 
taljuck place the blunt end of the stick on the tendon stretch the heavy stick in a great arc then relax -PRON- 
the bow and arrow have be bear of brain though -PRON- birth be not to be credit for thousand of century and through -PRON- tribe be to reign supreme for the life of ten thousand succeed generation 
this can not kill so great a beast at once 
but -PRON- can pass through the throat and later the thing will die 
-PRON- can send that stick through the great throat echo ank 
taljuck finger the pointed stone at the end of the crude arrow 
eon later man be to find that and think -PRON- a peculiarly shape axhead not realize the enormous muscle of the man that could use -PRON- as an arrowhead 
-PRON- will pierce the fhroat 
i know what -PRON- can do a scream arise from below 
-PRON- come from the downy lip of a young girl sor the farseeing 
-PRON- come 
-PRON- come 
i see the great head 
the tree people rush here and there chatter like great ape 
one child fall the hairy mother swing monkeylike to the ground catch up -PRON- offspring clamber to the height again 
to the height that do not protect against so huge a thing as the great one 
the sentinel big and strong man of the tree folk grunt excitedly to one another 
all but taljuck 
taljuck be silent brace -PRON- in the treefork with hairy leg while -PRON- great hand flexed and loose the bow and arrow first of great invention 
in the semicircle make by the white sun sink over the horizon a head appear 
-PRON- be a reptilian head colossal -PRON- gape jaw stud with huge tooth 
a short vast throat appear then the rest of the body 
the body be a mountain of lizardflesh and bone carry on two inconceivably enormous leg with a great tail to help -PRON- blundering balance 
-PRON- hitch over the ground crush young tree make the steamy earth tremble 
and as -PRON- near the tree village -PRON- rear higher so that -PRON- incredible head be above the level of the hairy people sanctuary 
the great one -PRON- call -PRON- 
long long later -PRON- be to be name from -PRON- remain 
tyrannosaurus rex the most ferocious animal ever know 
this be an anachronism perhaps the last of -PRON- kind on earth a freak vivor o a species suppose to have die out miliion of year before the appearance of the hairy folk 
but the tree people do not know that 
all -PRON- know be that suddenly moon ago this enormous thing have appear over the skyline at sunset stalk to -PRON- village and take five of -PRON- number as a tall man may pluck five green gourd in a high tree and gulp -PRON- down 
since then the great one have come at irregular interval and always four to seven of -PRON- number go down that tremendous maw 
bow to the great one and worship -PRON- give -PRON- sacrifice voluntarily have not placate -PRON- 
the tribe be in danger of extinction unless two stick could somehow save -PRON- 
to the high branch scuttle the tree folk there to cling like furred fruit 
but the high branch be not high enough 
the tree mighty of girth be not lofty 
a roaring whoosh of air be expel from the great throat and -PRON- basilisk eye fasten on sor the farseeing after scream rip from -PRON- lip 
-PRON- face just become downy with the fine hair of adolescence be the color of a lizard belly 
the other tree folk chatter and moan 
taljuck bend the great bow 
the great jaw gape as -PRON- lumber toward the tree in which sor clung paralyzed 
vine catwalk be sweep away like thread by the monster bulk 
there be a last shriek a dry clashing of tooth taljuck 
strike ank grunt in anguish 
in the hand of taljuck the quick the big bow quiver at -PRON- full arc 
but the great one be yard from -PRON- perch 
-PRON- do not yet send the long stick with the sharp stone on -PRON- singe forth as -PRON- have learn to do in the day before 
the tyrannosaurus as though draw ay appal but steady eye turn toward -PRON- tree 
-PRON- lumber there 
ank chatter and shriese in ihe tree beside -PRON- 
strike 
taljuck 
strike but still with steady eye taljuck hold the arrow taut on the tiger tendon 
the great one crash within ten yard 
shrill despair cry ank loose -PRON- hold and fall plummetlike to earth risk death by the fall rather than face the monster longer 
-PRON- moan and grunt on the ground with both leg break so tne bone protrude through the hairy flesh which mean linger instead of quick death 
and taljuck with a grunt release -PRON- stonetipped stick 
with a thin shriek the arrow cleave the air 
the sharp stone hit the leatherarmore throat of the great one and go on in 
the arrow drive by a force such as be unknown to any muscular framework of man today bury -PRON- almost to -PRON- blunt end in the lizard flesh 
the monster stop -PRON- rush 
-PRON- short front leg go up and -PRON- claw rake at the thing that stick out like a splinter from -PRON- stream neck 
then with an earsplitte scream of air from -PRON- cavernous body -PRON- come on toward taljuck 
taljuck clung to -PRON- treefork as paralyzed as sor have be 
the great one be not at all harm by the arrow -PRON- seem 
dimly -PRON- lowordere nervous system inform -PRON- tiny brain that -PRON- have be hurt but -PRON- vast strength be unimpaire 
-PRON- get to tree lunge against -PRON- reach for the hairy human midge with gape jaw 
taijuck the quick stare at the gape maw which be stream gout of red from the transfixing arrow 
the great bow drop from -PRON- nerveless hand 
from other high point the tree folk scream and chatter and moan 
the branch on which taljuck have be be empty 
-PRON- quiver still with the force of clutch hand that have be tear from -PRON- and that be all 
taljuck the quick first inventor be pulp in the toothstudde mouth 
but what be this 
the great one though only two odi es have go into -PRON- mouth be not crash after more 
-PRON- stand motionless beside the tree in which taljuck have clung 
-PRON- expressionless eye look toward the west not toward extra victim 
a thundering bubble airrush come from -PRON- transfixed throat 
blood and hairy fragment that -PRON- could not swallow geyser from -PRON- maw 
-PRON- lurch slowly away from the aerial village 
for a long moment the hairy people watch -PRON- go unable to understand 
then the first timid shout of deliverance keen out to grow to a chatter grunt chorus 
the great one be be drive away stonetipped stick have beat -PRON- 
three day later the tribe feast on the mound of flesh that lie off toward the west 
ordinarily no death of a man be remember for three day individually in the dim mind of these folk 
but -PRON- remember because -PRON- have save the tribe 
-PRON- feast in name and the man of the village fashion long stick to bend like -PRON- and send stonetipped lance into the flesh of other animal 
taljuck the quick be dead but the tribe live on save by the live fruit of -PRON- brain rom -PRON- mountain observatory all over the world the astronomer peer up the magnify channel of -PRON- threehundre and telescope 
in the teem city around -PRON- activity be still 
man woman and child stand hush in the street and -PRON- stare as the astronomer do up into the sky 
for every man fearful eye and every man appal thought in the year be on the same object 
the moon 
from that heavenly ball hang balloonlike now in the cloudless sky -PRON- seem that the death of the human race be come 
for the moon be die and in -PRON- extinction -PRON- promise to upheave earth so that no tiny human mite perhaps no life at all would be leave on -PRON- surface 
the human race have think -PRON- in a position to live a tranquil and untrouble existence on earth forever 
-PRON- have outlaw the horrible war that have nearly decimate civilization several century ago 
-PRON- have solve the food problem produce sustenance for earth billion with only a few hour of work a day for each individual 
-PRON- have prolong the span of life to an average of a hundred and ten year 
man be firmly enthrone -PRON- have think 
and for a time this have be true 
but now this cataclysmic menace from the heaven threaten the entire human race 
in the mount ever observatory 
professor talmadge turn from the eyepiece of the telescope which be so powerful that -PRON- would have reveal a man walk on the moon surface have there be one there to walk 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- assistant tohiki the end -PRON- say 
the moon be fall toward earth at a rapidly accelerate rate tohiki nod dark slanting eye shine with sad intelligence even if -PRON- fall no further -PRON- say -PRON- would be the eventual end both be silent thinking of the catastrophe that have begin at once with the moon inexplicable subsidence back toward the planet from which -PRON- have be tear a million million year ago 
all over the world earthquake of unbelievable violence have destroy city drain great lake create new one change map at the incidental cost of million of life 
all over the world volcanic eruption have burst forth on a terrifying scale 
active volcano have belch more molten rock in a year than in all -PRON- record history before 
old volcano become alive again 
new one form in the most unlikely place one ten mile across -PRON- jagged new crater spout through ancient rock in the alleghanie obliterate all human life as far north as new york and as far south as washington 
but the bad of the disaster be the flood ever increase in height and severity 
at each high tide the water of the seven sea roll to new height pull by the increase drag of the moon 
daily tidal wave mount with -PRON- roar crest lofty than -PRON- have be the day before coastal city of any nation be in existence any longer a few twisted metal stub show where tall building have be 
a few weedwracked line of broken stone indicate street when -PRON- could be see at all under lowtide depth 
all human being save those million who have be engulf by the encroaching sea have long since flee to the inland mountain 
and still the moon come closer murmur the japanese 
still -PRON- come closer nodded talmadge 
and -PRON- will continue to approach 
-PRON- will reach the point where the ocean tide rage over the whole face of the earth daily 
-PRON- will submerge all land even this great crest 
nothing but marine life will endure 
in fact even that may perish for at this point the moon will probably burst and surround earth with a belt of a million tiny moon that will blanket -PRON- from the sun so that -PRON- planet freeze intelligent eye go to a small drawing hang on the observatory wall 
that may save -PRON- -PRON- say 
talmadge shrug 
there be perhaps one chance in ten that a choice few of people may survive the come disaster in the talmadge retreat 
if anything can save -PRON- that can 
the astronomer who be that rare scholar a man of general accomplishment in varied field of science walk to the drawing and study -PRON- with proud yet faultfinde eye 
read in scale the drawing show a cavern ten mile across with a rounded roof a quarter of a mile high which be support by row of enormous metal pillar 
the cavern be in the base of a mountain indicate by dot line the outline of the dotted line be that of ever -PRON- show that the depict cavern must be under the foot of the two man 
shall -PRON- call the elect few tonight say tohiki 
talmadge bite -PRON- lip 
-PRON- eye farseee and keen narrow 
then -PRON- nod 
yes 
tonight 
-PRON- know what be to happen so shortly 
there be no reason for delay 
and tohiki only two thousand people the good of every walk of life understand say tohiki 
death be in -PRON- eye as -PRON- be in the eye of talmadge 
but the come cataclysm be too great for anything but utter desperate calmness 
particularly -PRON- want engineer that can handle the atomdisrupter 
yes 
that by all means reply talmadge 
tohiki leave the observation chamber 
talmadge go over in -PRON- mind for the thousandth time the one thing that make oarely possible the preservation of human life on earth 
the talmadge retreat 
no -PRON- vas not that 
anyone can excavate a great cave at a mountain base 
-PRON- be another matter to feed and clothe two thousand people in -PRON- and give -PRON- air to breathe over century of time 
this talmadge hope to do with -PRON- atomdisrupter 
-PRON- be the last great invention of mankind one which by -PRON- very simplicity have baffle science for century 
all matter be similar in that -PRON- be make from the same building block 
one substance be make different from another only in that -PRON- atom have vary number of proton and electron 
-PRON- have be know for a long time that if atom could be disintegrate to -PRON- component part and the part rearrange any desire element could be produce from the elemental debris 
furthermore any substance could be contrive synthetically by control molecular arrangement 
starkly ferociously simple this fact 
and with stark ferocious simplicity talmadge have solve the equation 
-PRON- disrupt atom with heat 
but such heat 
three million degree centigrade produce for a few millionth of a second by electrical discharge through high tension vacuum tube 
-PRON- could not be keep up longer for fear of burn out the apparatus but those few millionth of a second be enough to strip atom readdition of electron to produce any give element 
ah that have be more difficult 
but talmadge have solve -PRON- in experiment no less sublime for be empirical -PRON- have discover that different degree of heat produce different element and have the difference tabulate 
thus by a variation of a few hundred thousand degree -PRON- could take strip atom and give -PRON- what -PRON- like from hydrogen to uranium 
from then on -PRON- be a mere matter of synthesis to produce anything from the air -PRON- breathe to the food -PRON- eat out of rock metallic ore or anything else at hand 
there be slight variation between the synthetic and the real product oxygen for example have an atomic weight of instead of but these difference have no practical result 
thus with the socalled atomdisrupter talmadge propose to keep two thousand human being exist for indefinite century in a cave under the base of ever until such time as the planet return to something like normality after the moon disruption once more allow life on -PRON- surface 
talmadge sigh 
-PRON- think -PRON- mighty invention be perfect 
if -PRON- be the human race have a slight chance of survival 
if -PRON- be not soberly -PRON- look around the observatory for the last time absently pat the magnesium rim of the tremendous telescope reflector plate 
then -PRON- go out into the sparkle cold air of crest and step onto the slowspeed strip of the endless escalator which in -PRON- highspeed outer edge take -PRON- toward the mountain base at forty mile an hour 
within ten hour all be assemble in the great cavern in the bowel of the mountain 
there be man and woman of the high standing in all branch of science 
there be man and woman pick because of eugenic physical factor to keep up the body stamina of the race 
there be a few old man choose for -PRON- extensive learning but in the main -PRON- be a young crowd 
talmadge know well how necessary for blind race survival be a sound physique 
the cave in which these people be to live and -PRON- descendant after -PRON- for unimaginable century be ready 
in the center a domed building rise that be the heart of the place from that go a shaft halfway to the core of the earth 
up this shaft come internal and eternal beat to be transmute into plentiful power 
around the shafthead be the bank row of atomdisrupter where all necessity of life be to be manufacture 
tin food enough for thirty year be in stock before the two thousand would have to begin exist on synthetic food pellet 
the entrance into the cavern be a milelong tunnel from outer air at the base of ever 
this have be block up against the future mighty tide by a solid seal of liquescent rock which harden into a substance like gneiss 
through the center of the milelong seal however have be leave a oneinch hole this be lense in sequence terminating in a fisheye lens that spread vision 
a simple peephole arrange because the atmospheric disturbance cause by the moon approach make television impossible 
talmadge address the shivering throng in the cavern 
comrade earth as -PRON- know be about to pass into an epoch more violent than any -PRON- have suffer since -PRON- cool enough for life to begin 
during this violence -PRON- and -PRON- descendant hope to exist in here through flood and fire through the moon burst and blanketing of earth through the ensue glacial period nucleus may struggle up to a reborn world from this cave a thousand year from now a million perhaps never 
but meanwhile -PRON- shall keep the spark of the race alive i hope 
that be all and even that be superfluous 
all know why -PRON- be here and what face -PRON- 
the calm of catastrophe beyond mortal imagination to visualize hold -PRON- 
talmadge turn to the peephole 
-PRON- be all very bewildering and incredible 
there be no explanation for the suddenness with which -PRON- happen 
all scientist have agree that the mount tide would rise gradually a little high each day until at last all earth would be daily deluge 
and all scientist be wrong 
talmadge inventor of the atomdisrupter turn to that peephole to see for one thunderous instant a thing which be impossible but which be nevertheless occur 
instead of increase in height gradually the moondragge tide have leap within a few hour to within a half mile of what should be -PRON- eventual maximum 
-PRON- have think to see a dry vista from the mountain base have think -PRON- would be week before the high plateau would feel -PRON- first ripple from the distant ocean 
instead talmadge look through the rock seal to see something that at first -PRON- think be a great mountain chain newly form about a quarter of a mile from the fisheye lens 
then -PRON- see that the mountain chain be compose of water be the first really great tidal wave 
a sort of moan leave -PRON- lip 
mile high in spite of the altitude to which -PRON- have already climb to reach here the wall of water rush toward ever stunned eye see great crest topple from -PRON- high ridge to be absorb by the wall before -PRON- could cascade downward so great be that wall speed 
-PRON- see something like a tiny slug for an instant near the crest and realize -PRON- be a whale 
-PRON- see white speck on the ground microscopic in comparison with the tidal wave swallow in a half second and realize that the lofty building of the new city of ebberhow on base have be destroy as all thing pertain to humanity must have be destroy along the tidal wave path 
a wave a mile high 
come with incalculable speed and force 
talmadge see the solid wall rush seemingly upon -PRON- own defenseless person as -PRON- rush for the far lens then see nothing at all as the water strike the mountain base 
comrade -PRON- cry turn from the peephole 
the cataclysm be upon -PRON- 
the first great wave have strike -PRON- voice be lose in the trembling and rumbling of the mountain as all of mighty ever quiver to the shock of that tremendous wall of water 
but the people hear and tohiki with a despairing scream spring to side 
-PRON- be not quick enough almadge ordinarily would have see -PRON- danger as quickly as the agilewitte tohiki 
and god know -PRON- know enough of hydraulic to realize the incompressibility of water 
but the magnitude of what -PRON- have see stun -PRON- brain and tohiki be not quick enough 
at one instant talmadge stand with the back of -PRON- head next to the peephole and at the next instant head have disappear 
-PRON- body sink to the floor while over -PRON- from the peephole roar a oneinch stream of steam and water as straight and solid as a metal bar 
the lense push before the water column like glass bullet crash to atom against the opposite cavern wall ten mile away 
the water column endure for five hundred yard before -PRON- feather to nothingness 
-PRON- grow in diameter to an inch and a half two inch three before the wave outside pass on and leave a glisten drench world to rear bared rock to the air again 
then the two thousand in retreat with -PRON- horrible panic allay go to the body of -PRON- leader head have be shear off almost as though with a knife as the lense shriek from the peephole 
the flesh of -PRON- throat at the stubend be pulp almost to the consistency of whip cream by the high velocity of the projectile 
a concerted moan come from the throng in the cave then shoulder be straighten with grim resolve and face be turn resolutely toward one another 
outside be a drowned and lifeless world one that would be so batter and drown daily for thousand of year 
inside -PRON- leader talmadge lie dead 
but the protect seal of -PRON- liquescent rock and the benificent product of -PRON- atomdisrupter live on after -PRON- 
the human race have a chance at salvation because of the work of -PRON- clear mind 
i the late afternoon talgor the tall huddled into the protection of -PRON- vacuum suit and stare through the transparency of -PRON- oxygen helmet at the familiar landscape spread from the vacuumwalled tower beneath -PRON- 
-PRON- look absently at a world as round and smooth as a gigantic billiard ball a world cover by thin topsoil on which grow patiently nothing but lichenous moss a world light dimly by a darkre sun 
time be accord to the ancient fable when the sun have be virile and warm and bright 
man do not have to walk abroad in vacuum suit to keep from freeze in the everlasting cold 
many form of vegetation and of animal life flourish 
there have be mountain and valley lake and river and ocean 
then accord to the dim legend a great satellite whose name be lose in antiquity have fall on earth 
-PRON- have raise tide that rage for un counted century 
the tide have smooth down mountain and fill up depression 
the satellite have break up shield earth from the sun and water have freeze into a solid and uniform shell over the world smooth face 
the countless fragment whirl around earth have gradually be pound to dust by meteor be have vanish leave the world again in the sun ray 
but -PRON- be a die sun now with little of -PRON- original heat 
but before the great change legend have -PRON- that a handful of man and woman have hide from chaos in the bowel of earth under a lofty mountain 
-PRON- have literally eat rock tear down the atom of whatever material be around -PRON- and remake -PRON- into lifes necessity 
the handful have grow to hundred of thousand and the small cave into which -PRON- have originally go have become a vast underground kingdom 
then -PRON- have emerge to the world as -PRON- now be to find that -PRON- be not the sole form of life still exist 
another form have evolve across tne world from -PRON- mountain a form so alien and foreign so horrible talgor look guiltily around and then hastily press the little switch which shield -PRON- thought from the master 
almost since the memory of present man there have be in the transparent oxygen helmet -PRON- be force to wear in thin atmosphere the familiar transmitter send think vibration to the headpiece receiver of the master 
-PRON- be only a year ago that talgor have devise the sensitizor screen which shield -PRON- thought from the transmitter 
now -PRON- could keep -PRON- thought secret when -PRON- dwelt on -PRON- though -PRON- be aware that death would be -PRON- lot if -PRON- find -PRON- out 
-PRON- go on with -PRON- bleak thought 
during the chaos cause by the fall of nowforgotten satellite man have survive in -PRON- cave 
across the world coldbloode life which man have call fish have also survive 
most submarine life have be kill by the battering tidal wave just as air40 breathing creature have be kill 
but a few have find refuge in an underground ocean one could guess how many million year ago that have be 
no one could theorize about the evolutionary course that gradually follow 
all that could be say be that when man come forth from -PRON- underground empire the descendant of these coldbloode marine being similarly emerge 
-PRON- be still coldbloode able to freeze and thaw out again without harm 
-PRON- still breathe oxygen from water -PRON- transparent helrrit contain water instead of air 
but -PRON- walk on four paddlelike leg clothe -PRON- glistening and hairless body in vacuum suit and in -PRON- neverblinke lidless eye shone intelligence 
much intelligence 
-PRON- be big than man in brain as well as bulk 
man have stagnate underground 
-PRON- have keep alive the atomic knovledge compile by the nameless hero whose inventive genius have keep the race alive but have add no new knowledge 
the coldbloode waterbreathing creature have keep expand in brain power 
-PRON- become the master with human being as -PRON- slave 
talgor smile bitterly 
little enough use man be to the master -PRON- be far ahead of man in think capacity -PRON- hardy physical point make -PRON- better fit to survive in present bleakness 
talgor have often think that the master allow mankind to exist only because of hand 
marvelous thing hand 
with -PRON- man and woman the slave could build machine more easily than could the master with -PRON- annoying flipper 
-PRON- could more easily manufacture the water the master need for -PRON- breathing for long ago all water lie normally on surface have evaporate 
but regardless of the purpose the master keep the race of mankind in a bondage none the less horrible for the fact that the great majority of human being be not verse in the ancient legend and do not know the comparative servitude -PRON- be in 
but talgor know 
-PRON- know that man have once rule earth 
-PRON- know that man should be superior to these cold and emotionless being call -PRON- master 
and -PRON- plot for the return of day 
-PRON- stir in -PRON- vacuum suit and stare over the tower rim 
below -PRON- see several dozen small figure move 
-PRON- be friend secretly appoint to meet -PRON- here 
-PRON- go down the tower core to meet -PRON- 
a score of figure move to join -PRON- as -PRON- emerge at the tower base 
-PRON- be white colorless in a way inconceivable to mankind of a far early day 
-PRON- hair be white -PRON- skin be white -PRON- eye be white save for pale smudge of pupil 
absolutely without color 
talgor the tall towered among -PRON- 
-PRON- be nearly four foot in height almost as big as the average master have -PRON- thought screen switch on -PRON- say swiftly and without preamble 
all nod soberly 
-PRON- be move on the edge of death meeting here conspire against the master and all know -PRON- poignantly 
-PRON- be ready to risk -PRON- life to the end that the world be clear of the master and that human being be supreme again 
-PRON- white head incline a second time 
-PRON- know to the full the bondage in which -PRON- be hold know say one voice sound break and hoarse through the diaphragm in -PRON- helmet 
-PRON- woman be take last year for think against the master 
-PRON- take -PRON- helmet and vacuum suit from -PRON- and watch while -PRON- strangle and froze know say another short time ago the master take -PRON- first child 
i have allow the third bank of atomrearranger under -PRON- care to slow for a need repair and -PRON- seek to punish -PRON- 
-PRON- throw -PRON- a little girl into the rearranger 
i see -PRON- disappear before -PRON- eye 
then -PRON- turn the heatcontrol to degree and a ragged blob of codium appear where -PRON- first child have be -PRON- other somberly add -PRON- tale of horror and oppression 
the last conclude on a desperate note one which talgor however have sense before 
the master be about to get rid of -PRON- i believe this man say 
time and again one or more of -PRON- have go mad and revolt 
some of the master have be kill 
some of -PRON- machinery have be smash 
-PRON- have have several council in which man be call unstable and a possible menace 
-PRON- be hold one now 
i believe that be -PRON- last council 
talgor the tall nod vith desperate calm 
i believe -PRON- speak the truth 
i believe the race of man be lose unless a weapon i have be work on for nearly a year can save -PRON- 
that be inquire the old among the rest 
-PRON- shall see 
talgor lead the way into the entrance through the thick vacuum wail of the tower 
-PRON- be an ordinary supply tower one of the small and more remote of the hundred tower which be the scatter heart of all life in which be the late and fine atomic machine 
-PRON- be substantially the same as the one which have go with the handful of human being into the cavern far in the dim past when the satellite fall and break 
the unknown hero of that time have come close to the ultimate with -PRON- atomdisrupter -PRON- be possible to make few improvement 
power be still obtain by boring toward core boring that pierce to the very center now 
the nearest available substance be throw into the disrupter to emerge after varied heat treatment as the various substance of life just as have be do in the cavern 
talgor the tall lead the vay to the boring in this particular tower 
beside the nozzle of pure ardrium hard of all know alloy be a squat bell of transparent substance within which could be see numberless tube top by a circular grid of some metal none of the man have ever see before 
this be the weapon with which i hope to save mankind say talgor -PRON- eye sternly proud as -PRON- stare at the bell 
within this bell heat from the boring be convert to electrical energy which be in turn transform back to radiant heat and step up in wave length almost to infinity by the tube 
the radiant heat be capable of pass through atmosphere and other transparent substance to expend -PRON- energy on whatever opaque body stop -PRON- up to a range of about ten mile 
there -PRON- force be dissipate diminish by the square of the distance travel 
but i think the range will be sufficient 
the other stare at -PRON- awe frighten hopeful but the master vacuum suit object one at last 
-PRON- may be capable of insulate -PRON- body against even -PRON- radiant heat 
talgor smile bleakly -PRON- body may be shield to some extent but not -PRON- head 
for -PRON- wear the transparent helmet just as -PRON- do and -PRON- radiant heat will pass through transparency as -PRON- do through atmosphere diminish only by the square of the distance 
-PRON- be sure begin one of the rest timidly be sure of nothing say talgor have have no time to experiment properly 
the master move too quickly for that 
-PRON- weapon may kill -PRON- -PRON- may not 
that be the chance -PRON- take 
now -PRON- must go quickly 
the master will be here soon 
the master 
here 
yes 
for the past few minute i have have -PRON- thought screen switch off so that -PRON- could read -PRON- mind and learn of the plot against -PRON- here 
i conceal only the manner of the weapon -PRON- 
within a few moment the master will be here all of -PRON- save the very young and the infirm dart to crush -PRON- before i can menace -PRON- race -PRON- other man mill around the tower with frightened cry 
for generation fear of the master have be inbreed in -PRON- 
the knowledge that in a body -PRON- be come here now madden -PRON- with fear 
leave the tower at once calm voice crack out 
prepare to kill all survivor of the master race as soon as i have strike 
prepare to lead mankind back to freedom 
the man stream all too willingly toward the entrance 
but one say -PRON- talgor 
what happen to -PRON- leave the tower instantly before -PRON- be too late 
talgor interrupt with a break in -PRON- voice 
what would happen to -PRON- 
-PRON- knev only too well what would be -PRON- fate what must be the fate of any man within these wall when -PRON- radiant heat transmitter begin to function 
the other run from the tower 
from the sol of -PRON- metal boot appear -PRON- gravity plate shield mass from gravitational pull 
-PRON- shoot heavenward soar on stub wing slither from the arm of -PRON- vacuum suit shoot skyward again when altitude be lose in distance repeat the process skyhoppe rapidly off to the east 
and from the west the face of talgor the tall pale under -PRON- helmet 
the sky to the west seem to be darken with a great cloud 
only there have be no such thing as a cloud in the sky for a million year 
this blackening be cause by the massed body of the master every one capable of movement be rush to tower because of the fragmentary thoughtthreat -PRON- have permit -PRON- to receive 
a menace to -PRON- race 
this one mad human midge must be crush then more leisurely the rest of the slave race that have lately grow annoying 
talgor watch from the entrance 
the up and down advance of the master like wave of a great black sea rush upon -PRON- 
-PRON- tower up in a last ascent before swoop 
-PRON- could see individual body now monstrous cylindrical body witft four stubby limbs head with tar lidless eye glare out through waterfille helmet 
-PRON- leap to the control of -PRON- heat transmitter 
-PRON- thin white finger clutch -PRON- 
one touch of that ardrium lever and if -PRON- calculation be correct the human race be save 
-PRON- be as tremendously sublimely simple as that 
but -PRON- -PRON- the thin air outside the tower whistle and shriek with the cleaving of thousand of stubby wing 
talgor the tall pull at the control for week along the equatorial belt where life be concentrate human being under the leadership of the score who have be last to talk with talgor destroy remain vestige of the monstrous race that have enslave man for thousand of year 
the old and the very young those who have be too distant to get to tower with the main body all the master talgor have not annihilate 
then with mankind once more enthroned on earth -PRON- erect a great statue to talgor where the tower have once be 
have once be there be scant trace of the structure now 
when talgor have pull at the control the vacuum wall have blaze and melt allow the radiant heat to smite full against the wheeling tower horde of master 
the heat have char -PRON- head then explode -PRON- helmet as the water within be turn to steam 
only blacken fragment strew the burned earth for mile around all that be leave of the last grave threat against humanitys existence 
talgor 
well there be no tower leave no trace of -PRON- bank machine 
there be nothing leave where the tower have stand save a distorted transparent bell within which be fuse metal 
talgor have give -PRON- life horribly when -PRON- pull that control 
talgor be dead 
but the human race live on 
out of the gale come cry of man fisherman blow to sea in sink boat save as mate check strange light day and two night -PRON- be out there drift helpless in the gale and all the while -PRON- pump to keep afloat write william neher of new york and warren brown of beverly mass and again -PRON- would sight a ship during the day but couldnot make -PRON- see -PRON- go on by leave -PRON- to pump again and put off drown a little long 
but the second night -PRON- figure -PRON- pumping be about over -PRON- hand be so svollen -PRON- can hardly grip the pump handle -PRON- back ache like toothache and be begin not to care much when way off come the pin point of steamer light 
for hour as those light come nearer -PRON- signal with -PRON- flashlight and when there be a chance of hear -PRON- through the gale -PRON- yell like wild indian

a white blur in the air be suddenly a silver teardrop shape catch in the highreaching finger of the landing trap gaunt girder a thousand foot above -PRON- 
the gigantic beam surge down pivot on -PRON- huge hinge perilously fast at first then more and more slowly as be unieasiied when two power clash 4i -PRON- hydraulic shockabsorber sap the stratocar incredible momentum 
atkin dash for the spot where the duraluminumskinned mancarrying projectile would ground to end thomas halfhour flight from frisco skyport 
a knot of browngarbed mechanic clot around the tiny car 
-PRON- wrench clang against the bolthead that have clamp tight the hatch cover against the airlessness of upper space 
twirl metal rasp against metal 
the shine oval door swing back 
with eager impatience atkin shove past the mechanic thrust head and shoulder into the aperture 
happy land old sock -PRON- shout 
welcome to the greeting froze on -PRON- up 
the tiny cubicle be unoccupied be starkly staringly vacant 
in the heatless light of the ceiling tube the teleview screen mirror the skyport tarmac glimmer from the glossy leather of the cushion on which thomas should have lie outstretche 
but thomas wasnot there atkin skin be a tight prickling sheath for -PRON- body 
the thing be grotesquely weirdly impossible 
impossible for -PRON- chum to have get out of the stratocar unless someone have unbolt the hatch from outside 
impossible for -PRON- to have land somewhere so that that may have be do 
to have arrive on the dot of -PRON- schedule the stratocar must never have relent from the uttermost limit of -PRON- speed 
time lose in any halt could not have be make up 
impossible for there to have be any halt the device be propel by the blast of an electrostatic catapult at -PRON- starting point and have no power of -PRON- own 
once stop -PRON- could not have take up -PRON- flight again 
and -PRON- have come straight as an arrow to the hook at which frisco have aim -PRON- 
a fleck of white on the cushion catch atkin eye 
-PRON- reach in snatch -PRON- up 
-PRON- be a bit of paper and on -PRON- mr atkin a peremptory voice batter at -PRON- giddy brain conceal that and bring -PRON- to -PRON- at once 
the airman thrust the scrap into -PRON- pocket whirl 
the groundman be crowd in around -PRON- -PRON- swart countenance curious but -PRON- be evident that none of -PRON- have speak 
then -PRON- recall the tiny receiver clamp against the bone behind -PRON- ear and -PRON- know whence the summon have come 
this device hasnot be perfect yet the grey man in the hidden room have say but within tne limit of the field i can speak to -PRON- through -PRON- secretly and at will 
there have be a viewscreen before -PRON- too whose cosmicray eye could scan anything within fifty mile 
close -PRON- up don atkin snap and say nothing to anybody 
then -PRON- be run across the long level tarmac be dash up the broad step of flight headquarters building be hurry through the interminable maze of corridor within 
the chaos within -PRON- skull take on a pattern as the amazing revelation of -PRON- initiation come back to -PRON- 
the nation dream -PRON- at peace with all the world 
the asafrican alliance american fatuously think have drive out the white race from the continent -PRON- have so long dominate want nothing but to be leave alone hey reckon without the drive ambition of hungchen the new genghis khan who have forge an irresistible war machine behind the inscrutable mask of the east and await the auspicious moment to launch -PRON- against the occident and the americas 
if -PRON- could not be stop war rapine slaughter must inevitably destroy the golden age to which civilization have at last attain 
but here be the wallpanel in a guarded corridor whose curious quality -PRON- have be teach less than an hour before 
atkin halt glance cautiously leave and right 
-PRON- be unobserved 
-PRON- bend to get -PRON- lip close against a certain whorl in the blue tracing with which the marble be figure whisper a password 
a whirring sound seem to come from the very stone -PRON- tell -PRON- that the impact of -PRON- voice have set in motion the soundlock within 
the apparently solid marble slide open and the airman go through 
the wall thud shut behind -PRON- 
in the windowless room -PRON- enter a short graveface man mouselike in grey silk look up from -PRON- desk 
let -PRON- see what -PRON- find -PRON- say without preamble 
atkin fumble in -PRON- pocket with shake finger push the paper across the desk to the chief of the silver eagle 
the red line on -PRON- leer at -PRON- again the ominous design that have pronge -PRON- with knowledge of the catastrophe that have overtaken thomas 
a deftly draw dragon be coil around the orb of earth one talone claw sprawl triumphantly to obliterate the double triangle of the americas 
the chief grey face be almost expressionless as -PRON- touch the thing with a fingertip but under -PRON- pale inscrutable eye little muscle twitch uncontrollably 
the token of hungchen -PRON- say 
like -PRON- to let -PRON- know that -PRON- s defeat -PRON- last device against -PRON- spy 
what do -PRON- mean 
atkin groan mental agony make -PRON- forget rank for the moment 
what do -PRON- mean 
the other tone be very calm only the vague flat betray the despair that must be close in on -PRON- like a pall 
-PRON- mean that the key to the gap in the west coast electrobarrage be in -PRON- hand the only thing -PRON- need to enable -PRON- to strike 
thomas be bring the plan to army headquarters and -PRON- s get thomas 
but but -PRON- say that the silver eagle memorize all -PRON- message 
-PRON- say that spy have tap every mean of secret communication -PRON- have have and that s why the sliver eagle be organize correct 
-PRON- think that a band of glorify courier shoot across the continent at a speed great than any yet know would circumvent -PRON- 
but -PRON- have fail 
this let -PRON- know that -PRON- have fail 
-PRON- will get -PRON- out of thomas no 
atkin fist pound down on the desk 
bart will never tell die before -PRON- tell 
-PRON- wonot die until -PRON- know strip -PRON- brain the chief break off 
but that may take time 
if -PRON- can find -PRON- before -PRON- rip a long tape from a machine on -PRON- desk 
a straignt purple line trace on -PRON- waver at a single point 
look here 
this deflection in the flightgraph show that an extra amount of power be be absorb between three minute twelve second out of frisco and seven minute fortysix second after the start 
i notice -PRON- and think that the projectile have svierve slightly from -PRON- course be take additional energy to straighten -PRON- out 
but -PRON- occur to -PRON- what sir 
atkin demand excitedly 
what that something may have come into the field there betveen three hundred and twenty and seven hundred and seventy mile from the pacific on the great circle course 
-PRON- may look that region over go sir 
grey eye stab keenly at the tremble airman new atkin 
i donot know bart thomas be -PRON- friend 
chief 
more than a brother very well the grey man make -PRON- decision 
-PRON- may go 
and god help -PRON- if -PRON- be catch 
listen the kapparay a light from traffic trol flash the all clear signal and atkin thrust -PRON- throttle home 
-PRON- gyrocopter leap straight up from the field shoot up through the night past the successive glow of the level marker 
the red of the lumber freighterlane the yellow of the localflight zone the cerulean blue of the level in which the great transoceanic liner ply cometlike -PRON- surge past in -PRON- viewscreen drop below 
sunburst come to -PRON- from over the bulge of the rounding terrain as -PRON- ceptor stagger logily 
-PRON- roar vane could no longer find any support in the near vacuum of the stratosphere 
atkin twist the control 
the liftingvane collapse into -PRON- slotted groove 
the flyer be a sleek silver fish from whose tail the crimson flame of rocket gas fan out 
-PRON- dart westward silent and swift as a bat out of hell 
atkin throttle down reluctant but obedient to the chief instruction 
-PRON- must not overtake the sun darkness would be -PRON- good aid 
two red spot burn bright on -PRON- cheek and secret fire flicker in -PRON- glowing eye come old man -PRON- mutter between -PRON- tooth come bart 
stick to -PRON- give in tell -PRON- endlessly blur earth streak underneath -PRON- endlessly the red position dot drift with nerveshredde slowness across the map frame at the flyer elbow 
-PRON- shut off the feed unfold once more the gyrovane 
-PRON- drift down through the darkness silent as a cloud in a foggy night as invisible 
a rugged mountainside forestcloake swam up into dim view 
atkin check the descent hover 
a twist of -PRON- wrist and the beam of -PRON- kapparay projector be search the serried carpet of the tree 
to the unaided eye that beam be utterly imperceptible but on the specially treat screen at wnich the airman peer avidly a flicker disc cut through imaged foliage through dark underbrush 
to the kapparay all organic matter be transparent only earth stone or metal can reflect -PRON- and become visible 
minute drag 
bare ground only bare ground net by branch streamlet 
then what be that 
atkin hold the ray steady quiver with bowstre tenseness 
an irregular cube of stone show mistily 
a house 
a human habitation in the wilderness 
-PRON- heart bump crazily against -PRON- rib 
but wait a minute -PRON- may be a ranger station a depot of the man who patrol this primeval forest that be preserve as a national park 
beyond the house a metal something huge curiously form bulk vaguely 
atkin pulse leap 
-PRON- have find that which -PRON- seek 
thomas captor think -PRON- well hide beneath the leafy screen 
evidently the kapparay be one secret that have be successfully keep from -PRON- still don atkin drop until -PRON- be a bare hundred foot above the treetop 
too bad -PRON- search beam could not reveal human form 
-PRON- dare not send the map coordinate of this place by radio 
-PRON- would be overhear the gang would be warn and escape 
but at full power -PRON- would take -PRON- seven minute to reach frisco skyport 
then a hundred pursuit rocket would leap into the air 
in minute the mountain could be surround by wellarmed man 
-PRON- reach for the throttle 
the sea of foliage almost black in the long evening shadow glow suddenly into green flame 
just above the strange building an orange pinpoint leap into existence 
an invert cone of radiance soar lightningswift from that focal point 
instantly the copter be bathe in the flare 
intolerable heat strike at atkin 
the steel wall about -PRON- flame cherryre 
-PRON- be fry in the torrid blast 
already -PRON- sense be leave -PRON- with despair instinct -PRON- thrust at the release lever of the emergency hatch beneath -PRON- seat no time to snatch at the parachute cone 
-PRON- be fall fall lift slowly back to consciousness 
-PRON- body be sear with pain 
an iron band constrict -PRON- chest and -PRON- blood be salty warm on -PRON- lip 
a black silence envelop -PRON- break by vague rustling and the sound of trickle water 
-PRON- dazed eye adjust -PRON- to the dimness and -PRON- see twist tree branch moonlight sift through leave all about -PRON- 
-PRON- be lie across a sturdy gnarl bough 
above -PRON- -PRON- could make out broken branch a funnel path tear through thick interlace foliage 
slowly -PRON- dawn on -PRON- what occur 
plunge down -PRON- have strike the lofty crown of some forest giant 
the small branch the massed verdure at the top of the tree have absorb the force of -PRON- fall 
this large branch have catch and hold -PRON- have keep -PRON- from crash through to the ground 
-PRON- have fail miserably 
the realization wrench a groan from -PRON- 
suddenly -PRON- tense cling tightly to -PRON- bough listen acutely 
a voice sound 
heavy body thresh through the underbrush 
a yellow glow flicker among the tree below and be go 
-PRON- come again hold steady as -PRON- grow bright 
two bulking shadow appear force through the thick growth 
the dim backthrow of a lantern beat against the dull green of a uniform familiar to atkin from hunting and fishing expedition in these very wood 
this be luck 
-PRON- post could not be far off with -PRON- radiophone chance a code message to the chief 
-PRON- throat tighten to a cautious call the lanternbearer stumble rip out an oath 
-PRON- be not in english 
-PRON- light find -PRON- face 
high cheekbone thick lip narrow slant eye 
-PRON- be oriental 
-PRON- be search for something 
of course -PRON- be -PRON- for whom -PRON- be look -PRON- body 
-PRON- want to make sure of -PRON- death make sure that -PRON- crumple form lie perhaps near a trail would not betray -PRON- hiding place 
the lantern glow flash dartingly along the ground into the treetop 
atkin try to make -PRON- a part of the limb 
rough bark rasp a deep wound in -PRON- palm 
-PRON- flinch uncontrollably lose -PRON- grip 
-PRON- be slip be fall a desperate tightening of -PRON- grip knee a flexing of -PRON- ache arm muscle stop the disastrous fall 
but the leave still rustle with -PRON- movement 
a sharp challenge rip the forest silence 
a tube in the yellow hand of one of the searcher spurt blue flame 
-PRON- shoot through the leave and -PRON- heat the acrid smoke of seared greenery stung atkin nostril 
a second bolt come still nearer 
even if -PRON- miss -PRON- the light of those raytube flash must reveal -PRON- to the hunter 
cut -PRON- out mingai the other voice rasp in english nothing but a wildcat or some othei animal do not think so 
i do not like that -PRON- have not find the body of the flyer 
forget -PRON- 
-PRON- be burn up in the ray 
the orange ray do not slay 
-PRON- merely accelerate the electronic vibration of metallic atom until the melting point be reach 
but i forget -PRON- would not understand 
-PRON- be as stupid about scientific matter as the american among whom -PRON- have be raise 
-PRON- even speak -PRON- barbarous tongue better than the language of -PRON- ancestor 
-PRON- give -PRON- a pain 
come on let get back tell fukong to do -PRON- own dirty work brave -PRON- be when -PRON- can not hear -PRON- mingai sneer 
but in -PRON- presence -PRON- cringe and be meek like the rest of -PRON- 
no friend lisan -PRON- do not return as yet 
all right if -PRON- be go to be that way look further 
not till i discover what there be in this tree 
hope die in atkin brain 
go to keep on raying till be spot by some snooping ranger 
no there be a well way 
mingai turn back to the tree 
-PRON- cylinder again jet -PRON- blue flame 
-PRON- be continuous now be bore across the trunk 
back and forth the steady yellow hand draw the disintegrate beam 
the great bole quiv50 ere start to sway 
atkin get -PRON- foot beneath -PRON- on the perch leap down 
-PRON- aim be true 
-PRON- heavy boot strike square on shoulder 
-PRON- feel bone crack beneath the impact of -PRON- weight 
even as the man drop the american jump sideward catlike -PRON- lithe form twisting in midair so that -PRON- face the other oriental 
-PRON- catch a fleeting glimpse of a startled countenance then the saffron face be obliterate by the crash thud of -PRON- fist 
-PRON- whirl away hurtle into the shadow brush 
thorne tendril catch and tear at atkin 
a root trip -PRON- and -PRON- crash headlong into a tree trunk 
-PRON- thud to the ground lie there -PRON- torture lung labor -PRON- outstretche hand pluck at the earthy loam 
from behind atkin hear a thin whistle shrill almost above the range of human hearing 
from far to -PRON- right another responding 
evidently the man from whom -PRON- have escape be signal for aid 
-PRON- struggle erect 
-PRON- be unarmed alone bruise and batter terribly fatigue 
but -PRON- know now that -PRON- could escape by work down the hill to -PRON- left 
in the other direction be desperate man weapon at -PRON- ruthless command that could whiff -PRON- into eternity at will 
-PRON- turn to the right 
pursuit squadron crouch in the shelter of a bush 
before -PRON- the stone structure -PRON- have see from the air loom blackly 
over the clearing a rope network carry a camouflage of tree branch that -PRON- kapparay have pierce 
-PRON- could hear a murmur of voice but the sound come from beyond or within the squat building 
on the side toward -PRON- there be silence and nothing move 
the darkness of the wall -PRON- face be relieve by a horizontal line a thread of light almost imperceptible 
the eye clung to -PRON- 
then -PRON- be crawl across the bare ground that lie between 
twenty foot of shelterless surface fleck with the revealing light of the moon 
could -PRON- make -PRON- unobserved 
inch by crawl inch every muscle every nerve taut with expectation of a sudden hail of a blue flash that would sear -PRON- into nothingness atkin slide toward the beckon line of light 
after an eternity -PRON- be in the solid shadow of the wall 
-PRON- raise -PRON- cautiously and find the place where the light shine through 
-PRON- be the low edge of a steelshuttered window just at the level of -PRON- eye 
-PRON- could not see much of the room within the aperture be a mere slit 
but what -PRON- see be enough 
just within range of -PRON- vision be a tabletop black and glisten like glass 
fasten to -PRON- surface leather strap cut deep into the flesh of -PRON- arm and leg be thomas 
-PRON- friend stocky body be stark naked 
in a cold lurid light that beat down atkin could see -PRON- knot muscle writhe snakelike the sweat of agony gleam on -PRON- skin 
thomas face be deathly white -PRON- clenched tooth be reveal by lip that curve away -PRON- eye be close and -PRON- cheek muscle be quiver 
-PRON- forehead -PRON- hair be cover by a metal helmet from which wire curl away out of sight 
a low mechanical hum rise steadily in pitch 
bart thomas form arch slowly up from the table strain against -PRON- creak bond 
suddenly the hum stop and the twisted body slump flaccidly inertly down 
a yellow hand slim -PRON- long finger end in pointed nail come into view hold a small sponge to thomas nostril 
the prisoner quiver -PRON- eye open and atkin fist clench as -PRON- read the despair that stare from -PRON- 
-PRON- hear a voice suavely cruel 
-PRON- be very painful this searching of -PRON- brain 
if -PRON- choose to talk -PRON- would save -PRON- much anguish 
atkin scalp be a tight cap for -PRON- skull as the bind man eyelid drop and lift again 
even speech seem too great an effort for -PRON- but -PRON- lip move 
a hand be clamp over atkin mouth a powerful arm wound around -PRON- from behind pin -PRON- own arm to -PRON- side 
-PRON- be lift from the ground 
-PRON- drive a desperate heel backward into a hard shin 
something crash against the back of -PRON- head and -PRON- hang daze and barely conscious in huge arm that carry -PRON- hundred and fifty pound as though -PRON- be a child 
the room whirl dizzily about don atkin 
-PRON- see man a television screen a black tube that rise through the ceiling from some unknown device 
-PRON- be carry through another door and a saffronhued face lengthen by a wisp of grey beard and droop mustachio under a hawk nose drift hazily before -PRON- 
only the eye be clear black eye pierce behind -PRON- slant lid 
atkin be set down in a chair 
hand fumble at -PRON- pass a rope around -PRON- bind -PRON- to -PRON- seat 
-PRON- scarcely note -PRON- spellbind by those glitter eye 
-PRON- fog brain clear a bit and -PRON- see a tall oriental imperturbable 
there be bank tube glow behind -PRON- and bright copper coil 
to one side a table -PRON- black top glisten like glass 
thomas strap down be look at -PRON- with eye in which incredulity and horror flare 
the tall oriental spoke 
who be this nagarri rom behind don a huge black come in view 
dress like the other of the gang in the olivegreen of the ranger -PRON- be still redolent of the jungle 
-PRON- skin be a deep dull black that swallow light 
-PRON- bullet head sit queerly on wide shoulder from which arm thick as sapling hang loosely almost to -PRON- knee -PRON- voice be a throaty rumble donot know 
lord fukong 
but the electriceye alarm -PRON- flash and i find this one peek in 
so i bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
maybe -PRON- the one who -PRON- bring down from the plane the one who jump on mingai and lisan 
the other nod 
probably 
-PRON- seem very persistent to atkin -PRON- display a great deal of interest in -PRON- proceeding 
i hope -PRON- be satisfied with -PRON- present opportunity to observe -PRON- 
-PRON- reach out a clawlike hand and rip away the front of the airman shirt 
-PRON- snatch at the token hang there 
the fine gold chain snap and -PRON- have -PRON- in -PRON- hand 
a faint smile cross the jaundiced mask of -PRON- face and -PRON- hold the tiny bird out to the black 
not a half inch long -PRON- be but exquisitely wrought 
an eagle poise as if in flight -PRON- seem almost alive 
see nagarri this be another of the brood 
-PRON- wear talisman about -PRON- neck like -PRON- own tribesman to bring -PRON- good luck 
but i fear the dragon of hungchen be too strong for -PRON- puny godlet 
-PRON- turn back to the american shall deal with -PRON- in a moment when i have finish vith -PRON- comrade 
watch closely american and i wish -PRON- joy of what -PRON- see 
now -PRON- be talk to thomas and -PRON- voice be a crawl threat 
have -PRON- decide to answer -PRON- question 
no 
thomas voice be a tortured whisper but -PRON- lip close tight and firm 
fear and despair draw haggard line across -PRON- face 
fukong shrug step to the wall where a tall slate panel glitter with switchpoint gage gleam ebony wheel 
still stubborn 
-PRON- will not believe -PRON- then that this searcher will delve deep and deep into the core of -PRON- brain till -PRON- wrench the uttermost secret of -PRON- ego from -PRON- 
yet -PRON- be an american who first prove that thought be an electric process who first measure the tiny current that flow along the nerve 
well if -PRON- must have -PRON- -PRON- finger close on a lever just above bind post to which the wire trail from the helmet on thomas head trail 
now fukong 
fukong a shrill cry from the outer rooiti stop -PRON- 
another plane have appear above 
atkin force -PRON- head around 
mingai be in the doorway -PRON- shoulder bandage -PRON- right arm in a sling 
well why burst in on -PRON- like this 
fukong be imperturbable 
send someone to dispose of the remain 
the other face be a sickly green 
but -PRON- get away -PRON- gasp 
-PRON- get away 
the phrase be like the purr of an enraged cat 
yes 
-PRON- broken arm i have to use -PRON- left i miss with the orange ray and before i could aim again -PRON- be out of range voice trail away in an apologetic murmur 
-PRON- the other begin fury break through the stony mask of -PRON- face 
but again there be an interruption 
a sallow hindu appear 
master the plane that escape be signal to frisco skyport and -PRON- rocket squadron be take off 
the chief have not fail -PRON- 
-PRON- have send a follow plane that by great good luck have escape the asiatic lethal ray 
atkin calculate hastily 
in ten minute now this nest would be surround the spy capture thomas freed and -PRON- secret safe 
fnkong be snap peremptory order 
mingai and the hindu have disappear nagarri be unstrapping thomas be carry -PRON- out 
the oriental leader -PRON- raytube in hand be unfasten the rope that bind atkin 
get up and precede -PRON- 
the spy gesture with -PRON- weapon 
the american obey stagger on limb that be needle with return blood 
-PRON- be through the outer room -PRON- captor close behind -PRON- be in the open 
straight ahead loom a monstrous metal shape 
eggshape -PRON- be save for one end that be slice off sharply and there be an opening manhigh in -PRON- side be just vanish within with -PRON- burden 
atkin follow clang shut the slide behind -PRON- 
a steel ladder mount through a dim green light curve over an inner shell 
atkin head come through a trapdoor above and -PRON- be in a low long chamber 
then -PRON- be once more tightly bind 
a rough shove from the black send -PRON- slide across the floor to thud against thomas truss and naked form 
lisan be just close the trapdoor 
mingai fear in -PRON- eye be thrust up on a valvehandle that project from a large vertical pipe in the wall 
at the far end before a large viewscreen the hindu be seat black discs of phone receiver clamp to -PRON- ear 
beside -PRON- bend over a serried row of gage and lever atop a metal console 
a large viewscreen before -PRON- show the forestbordered clearing and the stone building that have be vacate in such haste 
fukong push at a lever and the viewscreen be a flare of flame 
-PRON- clear 
where the house have be be a gape hole in the ground hand move again 
the screen be a downrushe blur 
-PRON- clear once more starstrewn the night sky be about -PRON- and the farbelow forest be a dark mysterious sea 
don old man the whispering voice in -PRON- ear be thomas how on earth do -PRON- ever get into this mess come to find -PRON- atkin say grimly 
and i do 
how be -PRON- 
pretty rocky 
but keep until fukong get a chance to work on -PRON- again canot understand how -PRON- ever get hold of -PRON- 
-PRON- carrier come in right to the dot 
what happen be zip along watch the shoot past in the screen when suddenly something flash over -PRON- and drop down in front 
shoot over -PRON- 
i think the rocketstratocar be the fast thing ever produce 
so do until i see this craft bet -PRON- can make three hundred mile a minute 
-PRON- pass -PRON- as if i be stand still 
at any rate there -PRON- be right ahead of -PRON- and slow 
the blunt end be toward -PRON- and i think sure i be go to crash into -PRON- 
no way to swerve those carrier -PRON- know 
but just as i reach -PRON- a hole open and i sail right inside 
good lord 
then -PRON- a sort of fly trap 
damn ingenious eh 
i can figure out the rest of -PRON- now 
-PRON- say the stratocar reach new york on time 
that mean -PRON- close the stern and speed up again till -PRON- be make just the rate i be 
afterward -PRON- go faster once more get clear of -PRON- boat and drop away 
-PRON- have just pick -PRON- out of -PRON- on the fly 
i know at the time be that -PRON- hatch open and the big black be point a raygun at -PRON- 
-PRON- tell -PRON- to get out and i get be in an airlock and there be a rope ladder hang down 
i climb -PRON- and find -PRON- in this room be here and the hindu 
then in a little while -PRON- be down in the clearing where the other be wait 
after that -PRON- trouble really begin look at the screen be say sharply 
atkin twist -PRON- back to -PRON- original position 
in the distance a score of scarlet light make a dancing crescent on the viewscreen 
-PRON- rise and fall but come on steadily 
-PRON- thrill at the sight 
these be the army flyer from frisco skyport 
no mistake that formation 
those farspreade wing would sweep around as the center check and the asafrican craft would be catch in an enfilading fire 
fukong and -PRON- gang be doom 
peculiar how calmly -PRON- be take -PRON- 
eastern fatalism -PRON- suppose 
eastern fatalism hell 
memory fange -PRON- 
thomas have just tell of the incredible speed at command 
the spy master be not trap far from -PRON- 
-PRON- could get away at will 
why be -PRON- hang here motionless watch those oncome flyer a sardonic smile tinge -PRON- yellow face 
nearer and nearer the light come 
the dim shape of the army rocketplane show phantomlike 
the central ship dip minutely and the long line begin to expand 
the motley crew of the spy ship cluster behind -PRON- leader in the bow 
near enough voice rang like a sentence of doom 
a long pencil of orange light shoot out from -PRON- vessel waver impinge on the near plane 
the flyer flare red then dazzle white at the tip of the beam 
then there be nothing there 
the death ray move on to the next in line 
all along that farflung line a coruscation of green sweep as the indomitable fighter shoot out -PRON- futile answer 
lethal enough those ray but -PRON- range be far short 
another plane be catch in the orange beam and vanish another 
but the squadron come on -PRON- milelong firetail lash -PRON- through the night 
if one only one could get near enough to spear the asafrican craft with -PRON- beam 
take that one desperate chance the birdmen rush into the face of destruction never falter never waver as ship by ship the orange scythe reap -PRON- deadl3 harvest 
only ten ship be leave of the score that have first appear only nine and still the green ray be mile short of -PRON- mark 
minute pass that be long as eternity 
eight of the intrepid attacker remain then seven 
but now the stab dart of emerald death be almost reach -PRON- mark 
a little more only a little more 
suddenly the floor vibrate and atkin hear the muted thunder of the crafts rocket blast 
the spy ship be move at last 
fukong would escape that vas unavoidable 
the terrific speed of -PRON- strange vessel could never be match by the combination of the american 
but at least the pitiful handful remain would escape the holocaust 
see the futility of -PRON- courageous attempt -PRON- would return to -PRON- base perhaps eifectuate plan for a countrywide encircle movement that may in the long run bring the yellow ship dovn 
no atkin mouth twist in a boundless oath the oriental have no intention of permit that 
the distance between the spycraft and the near attacker do not increase 
the asiatic be keep just beyond the range of the green ray be take toll on the american aviator with false hope while the merciless orange beam flare out mow the velvet night with destruction 
the dragon of hungcben of the twenty flyer who have soar to the attack a bare still charge on 
-PRON- be insane 
-PRON- win but couldnot -PRON- 
atkin stifle a gasp be taut with sudden hope 
five of the squadron remnant have startlingly change -PRON- tactic 
-PRON- be zigzag be dart left and right up and down in what seem a last panicky attempt to evade the ray 
senseless -PRON- seem but there be one ship that have leave the group 
-PRON- green ray be douse only the pinpoint red of -PRON- tailflame betray -PRON- course to atkin 
-PRON- fling out -PRON- soul in a wordless prayer that neither fukong nor -PRON- aide would notice that stealthy climb 
steadily the squadron leader mount till the scarlet dot that mark -PRON- out be touch the upper margin of the viewscreen 
ten thousand foot below -PRON- comrade flit about in -PRON- macabre dance cheat the orange death again and again by breathless inch 
the attention of the enemy crew be concentrate on those dart shape on -PRON- dart ineffective ray 
atkin eye flick back to the lone flyer 
-PRON- see the sudden crimson burst see the dovmward curve of -PRON- flaring wake as a terrific swoop begin see the green ray dart out ahead spearhead of the diving hawk 
down and down and down add the pull of earth to -PRON- own driving blast the avenger plunge in one last magnificent effort to catch the destroyer unaware zipping faster and faster until even in that tenuous air the steel planebody glow dull red with the friction of -PRON- unleashed speed 
a minute grace sixty unobserved second of that lightning slant and -PRON- would snip the yellow menace from the sky 
look fukong look 
-PRON- be mingai who yelp the alarm 
the orange ray sweep up 
jam by luck by the luck with which the god award the greatly dare the downdarte american have find the one vulnerable angle of the spy ship 
green flame lick out hungrily but hand be lightquick in -PRON- flash to the throttle lever 
-PRON- ship lurch jerk aside in the last possible moment of safety 
the american be under now right under the spycraft 
but the dragon ship be drive ahead 
in an eyeblink fukong would be able to bring -PRON- death ray to bear on the dare flyer don atkin fling heavily across the floor by the sudden jerk see not quite three foot above -PRON- a gleam copper handle the valve at which mingai have twist just before the takeoff 
leg lash arm bind sweat pour from -PRON- line brow eye bulge from -PRON- socket by sheer power of stomach and trunk muscle alone -PRON- swing -PRON- torso from the floor 
-PRON- head come level with that handle 
-PRON- tooth clamp around -PRON- 
corded sinew stand out on -PRON- neck as -PRON- drive the valve lever down 
suddenly -PRON- be snatch loose by a lurch of the craft and -PRON- preposterously twisted body crash down 
but that very lurch tell -PRON- of success 
-PRON- be the main fuelvalve 
-PRON- have cut off the supply 
in an instant now the vessel would be catch in the raybeam of the pilot below 
atkin tense to meet the green flash that would mean oblivion for fukong and -PRON- myrmidon and for bart thomas and -PRON- 
-PRON- never come 
a shrill highpitched oath footstep run toward -PRON- pull open -PRON- eye be bend over -PRON- face livid with wrath raygun rise for the eoup de grace 
behind -PRON- lisan come up a strange glow between -PRON- slant lid 
atkin eye flick past the couple 
in this final moment o life -PRON- must know what have happen why -PRON- intend sacrifice have fail 
a electric veil shimmer and spark in a cerulean network of tiny lightning curve ail across the viewscreen 
beyond -PRON- the misty shape of the attack aircraft spit -PRON- green beam 
the emerald death ray spatter harmlessly on the ionic curtain and be quench 
from within the orange ray thrust futilely against the hollow defensive sphere of force 
this atkin see in a single flashing glance 
then -PRON- be stare up at the enrage oriental be wait in a timeless void for the blue spurt that would sear thought and consciousness and life -PRON- from -PRON- despair brain 
wait master lisan snatch at hand swerve -PRON- aside from -PRON- aim 
wait 
that way be too easy for the paleskinne dog 
let -PRON- and mingai take care of -PRON- have a debt to pay for vhat -PRON- do to -PRON- in the wood in the other slitte eye a glint of satisfaction show have -PRON- doubt of -PRON- lisan 
twice -PRON- have show deplorable softness in -PRON- task 
this i like much well 
-PRON- may have -PRON- wish 
but take -PRON- below i have much to do and do not wish to be disturb atkin skin crawl 
death -PRON- could face calmly but that which the fanatic gleam in saffron mask promise make -PRON- a coward 
fukong -PRON- croak barely able to force the word through -PRON- constrict throat give -PRON- to -PRON- 
kill -PRON- -PRON- 
that would be clean and honest 
but the oriental be walk away 
-PRON- take -PRON- down through the trapdoor carry -PRON- down fling -PRON- heavily on the plate in the narrow space between the entrance hatch and the curve inner shell 
untie -PRON- mingai 
there be an undercurrent of eager excitement in tone 
even in the face of what be to come atkin wonder at the gratuitous cruelty of the oriental mind 
mingai stoop to -PRON- fumble at -PRON- lashing 
as -PRON- fall away the american leap up to make a fight of -PRON- 
hopeless of course have -PRON- raygun poise for action 
well to go out that way than to suffer the planned revenge of the sadistic duo 
now hand up mingai 
quick 
the virulent threat in voice make the low command seem a crash shout 
mingai straighten 
-PRON- arm fly above a saffron face from which amazement and horror have strip -PRON- habitual mask 
lisan be brace on spread foot -PRON- raygun thrust before -PRON- 
-PRON- countenance be alight with a strange flame and -PRON- eye snap menace 
one whimper from -PRON- and i flash 
there be an instant of stunned silence 
then lisan speak again 
here -PRON- grab those rope 
tie -PRON- up and gag -PRON- 
quick man 
daze by the sudden turn atkin obey lie behind this sudden act on the part 
have -PRON- suffer a sudden change of heart -PRON- recall in the wood lisan try to argue mingai out of -PRON- determination to search the tree in which -PRON- be hide 
-PRON- recall inter56 vention with fukong a moment ago that have certainly save -PRON- life -PRON- task be finish mingai tightly bind and a strip from -PRON- own tunic jam none too gently into -PRON- mouth 
before atkin could -PRON- question there be a sudden dull roar which shake the vessel get under way again bark no time to lose 
-PRON- pluck raygun from -PRON- belt thrust -PRON- into the hand 
come on 
-PRON- be flit silently up the ladder atkin perforce after -PRON- hey be just beneath the rivetstudded trap 
lisan lift the lid slowly till a narrow crack of bright light show along -PRON- edge 
atkin manage to crush in alongside of -PRON- on the narrow step and together -PRON- peer through the slit 
the blue defensive sphere be go and the attack ship have vanish 
but something else show in the sky a long slim torpedolike object that speed straight for the spy ship 
from -PRON- nose a white light flicker in a rapid series of dot and dash 
atkin feel an electric quiver of tenseness run through the yellow man against whose body -PRON- own be crush 
a strange pattern form -PRON- in the mind as -PRON- crouch there wait for -PRON- know not what 
that oncome shape have the very form of the rocketstratocar use by the silver eagle 
yet this be no messenger waylay as thomas have be 
-PRON- have signal to fukong 
why have the spycraft wait here chance the fight with the american plane when -PRON- may have be away and go with only the slight effort 
what be -PRON- that glow from eye that shake -PRON- with an ague of eagerness 
nearer come the speeding rocket and nearer still until -PRON- pass out of sight at the low edge of the viewscreen 
the large craft lurch and lurch again 
fukong thrust at -PRON- lever there be a hiss of rush air 
then a buzzer shrill pick up the stratocar whisper 
get ready 
all right nagarri fukong call 
the air in the entrance lock be at normal pressure 
open up 
the black bent to a ring in the center of the floor and pull on -PRON- 
a round manhole lid come away 
a head appear and a squat broad body follow -PRON- 
straight black hair tiny black eye almost hide by high cheekbone broad flat nose over thick red lip this be a tatar face a throwback to the mongol horde that in the thirteenth century rule half the thenknown world by force of arm 
from that stocky figure emanate an aura of power of dominance 
unbounded ambition lust for power savage cruelty be stamp on the round flaccid countenance 
lisan clutch atkin arm -PRON- finger sink into the flesh 
hungchen 
come -PRON- to receive report 
tomorrow the attack 
atkin understand why the spymaster have be unable to flee 
-PRON- have have to wait here for -PRON- chief no way to change the course of the stratocar once -PRON- have start 
the huge black bow low 
the hindu join -PRON- in humble obeisance 
the haughty fukong come away from -PRON- control abject servility in every line of -PRON- tall body 
the mongol speak sharply and there be a rapid exchange in a shrill highpipe tongue 
now 
the snapped word from galvanized atkin into action 
-PRON- thrust upon the hatch leap clang 
the yellow man swing to the sound of the fall trapdoor see tvo apparition spring into view raygun at the ready 
throw up -PRON- hand 
up viith -PRON- 
atkin shout drive through the chamber 
up or -PRON- wipe -PRON- out eye be blaze pit of wrath simian arm go ceilingward the fukong rip out a virulent traitor at lisan and snatch at the cylinder in -PRON- belt 
blue lightning hiss from atkin weapon 
a blacken corpse crumple slowly to the floor any more 
-PRON- voice be thick with fury 
but the remain three stand statuelike 
-PRON- surrender come the voice of the capture overlord flash heir captive tightly bind the two don atkin the american and lisan the chinese turn to one another 
atkin hand go out to the other then hesitate draw back 
lisan straighten 
no -PRON- answer the question in the eye be not a traitor to -PRON- own people 
here -PRON- hand tap -PRON- own breast there be two loyalty one to the race among whom i be bear among whom i have live -PRON- life and have -PRON- friend the other to the race of -PRON- ancestor 
war between -PRON- vas unthinkable to -PRON- 
-PRON- glance down at bound and glowering look up again a wdstful smile hover on -PRON- saffron face 
now there will be no war sorry i couldnot save the squadron of plane 
i have to wait until -PRON- arrive -PRON- see 
and -PRON- be too dangerous before to attempt to capture the ship 
-PRON- join -PRON- rotten gang risk death and bad to defeat -PRON- plan to save -PRON- own people and mine from the horror of var 
atkin exclaim 
by god lisan -PRON- be a man 
yellow hand and white meet and clasped 
hey -PRON- fellow come bart thomas weak voice from the floor 
when -PRON- get time -PRON- may take three or four of these rope off -PRON- and get -PRON- something to wear get all the handshaking -PRON- want when -PRON- get back to new york 
test -PRON- by this questionnaire be sirius companion a dark star 
who say that the force of gravity be simply a curvature of space 
what be an etherstrain 
what be harmonic wave 
what be a tyrannosaurus rax 
what be the atomic weight of oxygen 
would there be much barometric pressure upon a planet which have a thin atmosphere 
name a science in which triangulation method of calculating be use 
guide to the answer will be find on page to solve the mystery of good shave get jon the trail of star blade 
make since by the inventor of the original safety razor 
star blade be keen longlasting uniform 
star blade brooklyn a by here be five people in the world by accord to scientific estimate recently compile if the present rate of increase keep up 
this be in spite of war disaster and epidemic 
there be only thirteen billion acre of soil on the surface of this planet that will grow food 
one person consume the produce of about two and onehalf acre so five billion be about the limit 
will -PRON- have to go to another planet in order to eat 
or will science learn how to cultivate the waste north arctic space or produce synthetic food ight travel approximately mile a second and here how professor michelson first prove -PRON- 
a beam of light be reflect from one of the side of a revolve twelveside block each side of which be a mirror -PRON- 
this make successive flash of light 
these ray be send a long distance about a mile and be reflect back again from a mirror 
the distance the twelvesided or faceted mirror move in the time -PRON- take the flash to go to the other mirror and return be the basis for figure the speed of light here be proof of the possibility of life upon other planet 
professor charle lipman of the university of california claim to have recently discover live microscopic organism in meteorite which have flash across the ether to earth from other planet 
the interior of the meteorite the professor explain remain cool while the outside burst into flame fragment yes that be grey brown or black be so colored because the iris contain a pigment of that tint 
in the case of blue eye however the outer layer of the iris be colorless and transparent 
the inner layer be expose 
this be white and reflect and scatter the light which strike -PRON- 
the blue ray of light be the short be scatter most readily 
in consequence the iris which be really white appear blue 
the blueness of eye be similar to that of the sky the latter also be cause by the scattering of blue light by the upper atmosphere 
a stronomer stiii can not furnish a positive reason for the existence of the crater of the moon 
cyclopean bubble burst on the moon once viscid surface later solidify into crater ring 
bombardment by colossal meteoric missy from the sky aeon ago when earth be rock by volcanic tumult of -PRON- early geologic birth 
a violent internal explosion like -PRON- own volcanic eruption 
these be the three most popular theory 
the real cause man will never know 
a a group of eminent scientist and engineer once make an error in mathematic which alter the whole science of electricity 
in a congress of engineer and physicist from all over the world convene for the purpose of establish definitely and permanently the size of the various electrical unit ohm farad etc for there be much confusion in this matter 
-PRON- be finally decide to make the abampere the absolute or physicist unit of current exactly equivalent to the ampere the practical or engineer unit of current 
on this basis the relative magnitude of the other electrical unit in each of the two system absolute and practical be to be determine some undetected error in arithmetic the abampere be make equal to onetenth of an ampere and not equal to a whole ampere asthe congress have decide 
as a result of this error the relative value of all the electrical system in the two system be different from vhat the congress set out to make -PRON- 
whereas the scientist wish to make an abcoulomb equal a coulomb the latter be instead ten time the former 
and so on and on 
this error which be never correct thus alter the entire science of electricity 
a -PRON- number seem to have some special significance in -PRON- solar system 
the diameter of the sun be time that of the earth 
the distance from -PRON- planet to the sun be time the latter diameter 
and the distance from earth to the moon be time the diameter of luna cience can now bend light 
previously except for the great spacecurvature vhich relativist say surround star and sun no conceivable agency or material could actually cause light to travel in a curve 
this feat be accompishe by dr harry robert dittmar of the du pont research laboratory with the aid of pontalite a new plastic know chemically as methyl methacrylate polymer 
du pont scientist recently demonstrate that a pretzelshaped length of pontalite could conduct light carry -PRON- around bend as a cable carry electricity 
a flashlight be hold close to one end of the twisted plastic tube 
the other end of the tube shine brightly 
the reason why pontalite bend light be because of the crystalline structure of the material which refract the light in a series of very straight line join at slight angle like bar link in a watch chain so that the light stay inside the conductor until -PRON- reach the end on the in the hygienic age of the future harold faddley age commit a crime supreme 
by -PRON- hard irregular shape of the selfadjuste nibbler move over the grassland like a gigantic mechanical cow only -PRON- have caterpill traction band instead of leg 
-PRON- thirtytwo jaw work alternately in echelon of eight open shut nip tear rhythmically 
professor obinson have well remember the importance of achieve condition as identical as possible with those produce by the tooth and jaw action of herbivorous animal before the fodder go into the metaboliser 
farmer geary watch the nibbler at work 
-PRON- see beyond -PRON- the vast threestorie acreage of -PRON- multiplecrop flat incongruously tilt on the side of durdleberry slope in the distance 
the bizarre shadow of the combined windsuncatcher like a spray of tulip mount fanwise on a rotate mast slant across the meadow 
this be good say geary rub -PRON- hand 
this be fine 
-PRON- have be read through -PRON- accountant estimate of balance and see every prospect of be nearly ten per cent up on the previous half year 
-PRON- soya byproduct -PRON- fibrous residue and -PRON- metaboliser -PRON- look like a gigantic mechanical cow fodder all show a most healthy increase 
indeed the only slight setback have be in the thirdti chlorophyl crop from the flat and this have be due solely to a mechanic unaccountable error in set the thermostat 
well -PRON- would settle this mechanic 
mason -PRON- be 
-PRON- have already appeal to the commission claim for the loss to be make good 
this would probably reduce superannuation prospect to those of the third class unless -PRON- make good in the next year or two by earn maxima efficiency bonus 
so farmer geary have every reason to feel pleased with -PRON- as -PRON- return to the gleam farmhouse 
-PRON- find the portral there and old faddley and -PRON- wife and young tim on vacation from the university of agriculture 
-PRON- have be talk about old time and new as people will in all age 
the great blessing of all mrs portral be say as farmer geary step in from the lawn well -PRON- hard to say 
i remember when i be a girl -PRON- mother use to tell -PRON- about how -PRON- use to mix food together and put -PRON- into pot and oven instead of just heat the carton 
-PRON- say that -PRON- be a full day work do all that unnecessary mixing and cooking and clean plate and dish afterward 
fancy have to use plate and dish over and over again have be really hygienic agree tim 
but then the twentyfirst century be never much in advance of the tenth in the business of feeding think that the great blessing have be the abolition of edible animal say farmer geary adjust a recliner and settle -PRON- at the most comfortable angle 
imagine the horrible animal smell and the dirt the sweat skin and be coarse elbert mrs vate mouth the fly 
geary say 
well be to outlandish country where -PRON- still have such awful habit havenot -PRON- nearly make -PRON- sick to see the way -PRON- depend on vegetation be transmute through the filthy stomach of animal for meat and milk 
blessing give -PRON- unhesitating vote to synthetic metabolising plant every time 
harold here remember cow and sheep in this country say mrs faddley -PRON- harold and geary shudder 
sure 
when i be a boy near a hundred and thirty year ago i work on one of the last of the old farm agree old faddley 
but i be use to -PRON- -PRON- see and i love the smell of the farmyard and the lowing of the cow and the simple nature in -PRON- all why in the egglayer side of the business today 
to handle live bird an to take interest in -PRON- remind -PRON- of old time -PRON- see 
-PRON- even use to eat chicken as meat in those day didnot -PRON- mr faddley 
this be from tim course -PRON- do tim 
but -PRON- wasnot the featherless bird -PRON- use today -PRON- see 
-PRON- have plump flesh and lot of feather fair bunche of -PRON- like -PRON- can see at the zoo 
and -PRON- use to run about the yard an scratch in the ground an peck an cluck an squat in the dust like anything 
twas music to -PRON- kill -PRON- mrs portral interrupt hastily 
then -PRON- pluck all the nasty insanitary feather off and then -PRON- actually burn -PRON- in oven lubricate -PRON- with animal fat and pig meat while -PRON- burn 
i remember -PRON- mother tell -PRON- 
talk about cannibalism say portral 
the chief business of life today say geary 
the whole business i say consist of and should consist of nothing but the efficient production and distribution of foodstuff and manufacture and the vigilant observance of hygiene and sanitation 
control of course sir education tim suggest bashfully 
-PRON- can leave that to those responsible 
tim quail before truculent eye say the chief busi62 ness of life -PRON- boy 
old faddley in the arc of the wall near the humidor switch wish that some other topic of conversation have be choose 
the very mention of oldstyle farm bring with -PRON- a strange nostalgia 
while -PRON- have be speak of the smell and sound of -PRON- boyhood day on the land -PRON- come back to -PRON- with such vividness that -PRON- thereafter drift into a day dream 
-PRON- fancy -PRON- stand by a gate watch the cow come through from the churnedup pathway 
there be no sound of mechanism or whirr of wheel not even the distant chugchug of windsuncatcher 
the air be calm warm with peacefulness as the cow come sedately through whisk -PRON- tail one after the other pause for an instant to swing -PRON- head sideward and favor faddley with meaningless stare 
and the field in which -PRON- graze the surface be delightfully uneven there be tuft and tussock of grass not the soulless smoothness of modern meadow ready for great lumbering clatter nibbler to work on 
how well -PRON- remember 
in the far corner near vhere the cabbage start be the hay rick and vhat a pleasing aroma come from -PRON- especially when the sun come smile after a shower 
pig and fowl and big farm horse and duck 
-PRON- never tire of watch the family of duck waddle comically after the mother to the dear dirty pond behind the stable 
dear oh dear 
twa well over a century ago no smell like the farmyard mixture -PRON- think and there s no animal like a cow 
nevertheless on emerge from -PRON- reverie -PRON- feel that -PRON- have be betray by -PRON- unguarded enthusiasm into a social indiscretion 
-PRON- notice a difference in manner at once 
mrs portral also have look at -PRON- with an expression of distaste 
there be that sort of aloofness evident in the room which may have follow the utterance of a blasphemy 
from that moment faddley cease to visit the gearys 
-PRON- shrink into -PRON- shell 
beyond an occasional business trip by air to canada or to bermuda -PRON- seldom stir from -PRON- egg farm 
-PRON- even refuse -PRON- usual attendance as a delegate at the egg union weekend meeting in rio de janeiro 
sad about the old man be the general verdict 
get into the sere and yellow at last 
never be truly with the time -PRON- know 
of course -PRON- have to be with production method because of the law but at heart -PRON- s a reactionary 
people shake -PRON- head and go about -PRON- business leave old faddley to -PRON- egg hatchery 
such a progressive age with so many diversion to occupy what use to be know as leisure could easily forget a man who properly belong to the past 
but faddley be destine to emerge from obscurity at last and to dart across the suy of the world news like a meteor of sensational dimension 
there be scarcely a civilized home in the five continent in which the faddley case be not a topic of conversation from the moment of -PRON- first flashing on -PRON- visiscreen one of the big newsscoop in the history of the transmission have authentic firsthand information of the event 
-PRON- retail -PRON- intelligence with gusto to the visitor who have drop like locust on -PRON- tarmac oi hearing that -PRON- have something to say thus geary share in the sensation to -PRON- great satisfaction 
in -PRON- favorite attitude on the recliner -PRON- thus hold forth can tell -PRON- all about -PRON- the most amazing thing that s happen in america for many a long year 
-PRON- have a great opinion of -PRON- as a raconteur and mean to make the most of -PRON- opportunity now 
this fellow faddley be perhaps the old man in the egg business today old in point of year too 
well most of -PRON- know -PRON- i believe be an instance where the crookedness of age warp a man mind and send -PRON- into a groove of madness 
i suppose -PRON- have feel -PRON- gradually be leave behind by the young generation -PRON- know snub would be the word and -PRON- prey on -PRON- 
anyhow -PRON- turn out that for some month before the tragedy -PRON- have indulge in a sort of ritualistic retirement meditation and so on in one of -PRON- big egg flat that -PRON- keep for emergency 
imagine a man of -PRON- age lock -PRON- in that enormous building surround by tier upon tier of empty incubator lay box and all the paraphernalia of -PRON- trade 
a solitary little figure in that great loneliness tired of the world or disgust with -PRON- i donot know which stay there all day so mrs faddley say and most of the night only go indoor to -PRON- home toward dawn 
nothing -PRON- could say would shake the old fool 
if -PRON- want -PRON- to meet company -PRON- would growl out that -PRON- have no time for -PRON- 
the man must have be for -PRON- have know the whole place inside out for year and that the reserve flat have always be empty and have never hear so much as a single cluck from a layer 
anyhow as the inner door swing open there come to the ear of the inspector a dreadful sound like a soul in torment echo in the back recess of the flat and then old faddley come run out with a face as white as death 
what time yesterday do the arrest take place ask a young airman be up at the time and have no visiscreen on the dash 
seven oclock on tuesday evening reply geary 
about four hour after -PRON- be interrupt by the flashing of the visiscreen that occupy the great part of the wall to -PRON- left 
by jove -PRON- say the end of the tale 
for the visiscreen flash faddley case trial result 
harold jam faddley age of upman egg farm wilt sentence to suspension from all public production work with loss of privilege for life 
-PRON- admit -PRON- guilt on all count to smuggle from province of china by air egg liner to harbor in federal domain and on schedule premise to lead on schedule grassland under concealment of night contrary to hygienic act and public law a prohibit animal to wit a cow a thoughtprovoke novelette of and scientifically control destiny by i roam the universe a lone avenger of the spaceway and no man in the entire solar system guess -PRON- secret 
lanoth start walk toward the wanderer -PRON- cohort behind -PRON- of the by author of the discus man of ekta warrior of eternity etc 
a of intense sadness lie like a blanket upon the ground and the dullgleame mansion of walter brundage owner of the small dark star merthel 
for janice garth beloved young granddaughter have for many hour lain ill with some strange malady 
miriam garth mother of the stricken child stand before the screen in the visigraph room impatiently wait for the operator to adjust -PRON- apparatus to the broadcast beam 
then at a signal from the technician -PRON- sweep up the portable speech transmitter 
brundage city on merthel call e the wanderer 
call the wanderer 
emergency call 
brundage city call the wanderer 
the young woman speak into the microphone until -PRON- throat become dry -PRON- voice husky 
but there be no answer to -PRON- call 
the visigraph screen be blank 
have -PRON- be too late 
if only daniel -PRON- husband be here with -PRON- now how much easy -PRON- would be to bear 
-PRON- long for the comfort of -PRON- arm -PRON- soft word of encouragement -PRON- love 
daniel garth who have be enmesh in a web of circumstantial evidence build up by lawless conspirator daniel who have be convict and sentence for life in the plutonian penal institution for a crime which -PRON- have never commit 
suddenly the glitter surface of the visigraph screen redden 
word in a flat metallic voice crackle from the reproducer 
the wanderer stand by for visual connection with brundage city merthel 
the visigraph clear and there appear before miriam garth the image of the universal man of mystery the wanderer 
a weird picture there on the screen the picture of a man clothe in a grotesque black steel space suit of a type not generally accept by rocketman 
no person knowingly have ever gaze upon the feature of the wanderer 
there be no transparent window in -PRON- helmet and -PRON- have never remove -PRON- space shell in the presence of other 
neither have -PRON- natural voice ever be know to register upon human ear 
two retinascopic photoelectric cell set in the face of -PRON- helmet surmount the slitte orifice of a speech reproducer 
on either side of the iron head be a sensitive cylindric microphone 
a small oxygenerator of peculiar design be affix to the armor of -PRON- shoulder 
thus the wanderer vas able to breathe see hear and speak without -PRON- identity become know 
miriam garth daughter of brundage call the wanderer miriam speak nervously into the transmitter 
-PRON- daughter have be bring down by a strange form of lethargic encephalitis which -PRON- merthelian physician do not understand 
daniel garth the child father who be a prisoner on pluto be affect similarly 
but dr vacor the prison surgeon have be able to keep -PRON- alive for three year 
i feel that if dr vacor could see -PRON- child there may be a chance to save -PRON- life 
breathless miriam pause then go on but -PRON- have no space ship in which to carry -PRON- to pluto 
bor lanoth the pirate attack -PRON- city and destroy the only ship on the planet 
if -PRON- be near merthel will wonot -PRON- take -PRON- 
the electromechanical countenance show no sign of human emotion as -PRON- reply prepare the child for the flight 
i shall land upon merthel shortly 
the distant sun pale and anemic plunge beneath the jag western horizon as the trim little ship with brake rocket bellow a mighty challenge to the bleak merthelian landscape drop gently upon the ground near the brundage mansion 
a side port in the ship hiss spin open and the wanderer stand there on the ground wait -PRON- electric eye cast twin shaft of dull smokyre light into the shadow 
miriam garth and -PRON- father both clothe in heavy electrically heated fur garment approach the ship 
walter brundage bear the unconscious form of -PRON- granddaughter in -PRON- arm 
the wanderer motion -PRON- toward the open port 
-PRON- wave aside -PRON- thank board the ship behind -PRON- passenger close and seal the port 
-PRON- make -PRON- comfortable and place the child on a springsuspende litter fasten -PRON- securely to guard against the strain of acceleration 
then -PRON- go to the control of -PRON- oneman ship 
-PRON- turn to miriam and -PRON- father say ascension 
ready reply brundage 
the wanderer glance at the indicator before -PRON- move a lever 
the ship rise rapidly on an even keel -PRON- underjet roar in crescendo 
acceleration 
again brundage speak -PRON- readiness 
with a blast of stern rocket the ship shoot outward in a long arc toward the disc of pluto the wanderer -PRON- body brace against the support rail gradually adjust the gravitation plate as pull lessen 
after the fierce thrust of acceleration have subside miriam let -PRON- eye ling upon the motionless figure of the pilot 
who be this strange man in black steel armor this weird avenger of crime who be ever ready to assist someone in acute distress 
layman on every planet have advance the theory that the wanderer be a senseless cosmic ray automaton remotely control by some human intelligence 
but scientist contend otherwise 
the wanderer have display certain reflex to unforeseen contingency -PRON- claim that denote perfect coordination of mind and body 
this could not have occur the man of science stoutly declare in the case of a mechanical robot 
the wanderer have first come into interplanetary prominence by swoop to the aid of a group of embattle space patrolman on the inner satellite of mar and assist -PRON- in the extermination of a band of pirate 
thereafter wander ceaselessly through the black night of space the wanderer have wage an almost singlehanded warfare against piracy until but one outlaw leader now remain alive bor lanoth 
the deed have make of -PRON- a legendary figure of romance and mystery have earn -PRON- the title wanderer of the void 
and the fact that -PRON- be a mask unknown lend glamour to -PRON- exploit 
-PRON- have agree to reveal -PRON- identity only when bor lanoth last of the space pirate no longer roam the sky 
thus miriam sit in meditation fo many long minute -PRON- mind review the colorful history -PRON- thought return at last to -PRON- personal trouble 
there be daniel -PRON- husband a convict felon who for three year have lie in a deathlike sleep in the plutonian prison 
and now janice be affect in a like manner 
what be the nature of this unknown physical condition tnat have seize -PRON- 
tear start afresh to eye 
-PRON- turn toward the observation port beside -PRON- gaze out in an abstracted manner 
then -PRON- sit upright in -PRON- chair 
many mile out across the blackness of space -PRON- see the unmistakable orangered flame from the stern jet of a space ship the yellow dot that be porthole in the side of the vessel 
-PRON- announce -PRON- discovery to the wanderer 
yes -PRON- say know 
that ship have be pace -PRON- for more than an hour 
-PRON- be bor flagship man by -PRON- follower from the reptile planet 
i knov -PRON- by the set of -PRON- rocket 
for a long time i have seek an encounter with lanoth a fight to the finish 
-PRON- would never give -PRON- that opportunity 
but now while i be on a mission of this sort -PRON- bring the fight to -PRON- ear tear at heart with icy finger 
the young woman nerve burn like redhot wire be at the breaking point under the severe mental burden that have be impose upon -PRON- 
-PRON- slump listlessly back into -PRON- seat suddenly decide to place -PRON- faith blindly in the ironclad creature at the pilot control before -PRON- 
deceleration the wanderer announce 
brundage hastily affix elasti barnesse about miriam and himael the child require no attention -PRON- be suspend on all side 
vibration of the stern cease 
then abruptly ilranr -PRON- frail body surge fcrwiri aran the support strap as -PRON- brake rocket flame nt ie 
miriam stare out at ship which have now range much close 
the craft have cut propulsion rocket and be brake fiercely nose downward for a landing on pluto 
wind shriek about the hull of the vessel as -PRON- hurtle into frigid atmosphere 
the wanderer regulate the gravitation reactor accordingly 
-PRON- soon drop to a jarless landing upon an iceincruste plain near the penal institute 
the wanderer bring out space helmet and oxygenerator from a locker in the ship nose 
as -PRON- know atmosphere at night be but slightly above absolute zero -PRON- say 
-PRON- will need these to protect -PRON- lung against the extreme cold 
there be a small one to accommodate the child 
all be fit with shortdistance cosmic ray transmit and receive apparatus 
the wanderer place a helmet about the head of each of -PRON- passenger start the oxygenerator see that the communicating device be function properly 
the voice boom in ear require no space gear for -PRON- -PRON- say as if in answer to the question -PRON- have be about to voice 
-PRON- helmet be sufficient 
the girl look at -PRON- and wonder 
there will be fight perhaps and -PRON- will need a weapon 
the wanderer look at brundage and indicate a rack of gun on the far wall 
brundage select a side arm and a long gun provide -PRON- with ammunition 
the wanderer inspect the brace of wauxum highpressure pistol that hang in clip holster at -PRON- own waist 
miriam and brundage don -PRON- fur garment and the young woman take the child in -PRON- arm 
-PRON- then follow the iron man into the airlock and pause at the quartz window in the exit port ship be just settle down some hundred or more yard away the flame from ier under jet blast out a wide berth in the ice plain 
-PRON- would be good for -PRON- to remain on the ship the wanderer tell miriam 
-PRON- open the lock and -PRON- and brundage step down upon the ice 
miriam close the port behind -PRON- press -PRON- face close to the windov -PRON- heart thump madly against -PRON- rib 
the dark plutonian night be bitterly cold hazy with drift flake of congeal and frozen atmosphere 
overhead star glitter with a sort of frigid jewellike splendor add a touch of eeriness to the frozen world below 
miriam jerk nervously at the burst of white illumination that suddenly come from the pirate ship 
-PRON- could now see plainly -PRON- father and the wanderer stride purposefully across the ice crystal 
a port in the great ship open and a spaceclad man whom miriam instantly know to be lanoth leap out 
the young woman shudder almost overwhelmed with nausea at sight of the reptilian horde that pour out of the lock behind the pirate leader man half crocodile -PRON- appear to be walk upright upon -PRON- short stubby hindleg -PRON- long horny tail slide upon the ice 
a single large eye set in the center of -PRON- forehead glow with a baleful luminosity 
-PRON- leap and cavort about lanoth brandishing weapon grasp in -PRON- web hand 
-PRON- wear no space suit for -PRON- be inhabitant of a planet far more frigid than pluto 
lanoth wave -PRON- back and start walk toward the wanderer 
the two man halt face each other at a distance of thirty foot 
brundage be to the left and slightly back of the wanderer bis long gun hold in readiness 
the communicating device in helmet bring -PRON- conversation to -PRON- 
ho wanderer 
-PRON- meet at last 
yes lanoth -PRON- meet 
but not at a time to -PRON- liking 
i have on board -PRON- ship a child vho be at the very threshold of death 
-PRON- life be measure in minute unless dr vacor the prison surgeon take -PRON- in charge immediately 
let -PRON- pass with -PRON- and -PRON- mother and i give -PRON- -PRON- word i shall return what care i if the child die 
lanoth snarl 
-PRON- be indeed dull of wit 
wanderer if -PRON- do not realize that this situation be little short of perfect for the fulfillment of -PRON- plan 
i shall cancel the old charge against brundage as well as the one against -PRON- 
miriam see -PRON- father surge forward hear -PRON- rasp damn -PRON- black soul lanoth 
a gun flash in the hand of a reptile man 
brundage spin slump to the ice lay still 
the wanderer fall into a crouch come up with mechanical precision a flame gun grasp in each of -PRON- metal hand 
lanoth give ground before the terrible fusillade 
-PRON- have not be able to match the lightning double draw 
but now -PRON- gun be out and up blast forth the hatred of -PRON- owner 
the wanderer -PRON- own gun jerk viciously march steadily forward into the blaze death that hurtle at -PRON- from the hand of -PRON- adversary 
behind lanoth the reptile man hold -PRON- fire fearful of strike -PRON- leader 
crouch beside the window in the little space ship miriam garth hear the clang of bullet against the helmet and armor of the man on the snow plain before -PRON- feel the vibration as missile strike the hull of the vessel 
brundage be move now be get on -PRON- foot 
-PRON- have only be stun by the bullet 
the helmet have save -PRON- 
-PRON- bring up -PRON- rapidfire long gun bring -PRON- to bear upon follower press the trigger 
but the pirate close in upon -PRON- slowly inexorably despite the menace of -PRON- gun 
lanoth and the wanderer be close together now still blaze away at each other 
miriam marvel that either of -PRON- have survive the wither fire from the other gun 
lanoth begin to weave about from side to side 
and then the wanderer drop to one knee 
up 
miriam shriek into the little microphone in -PRON- helmet 
get up 
wanderer 
the wanderer shake -PRON- head as if to clear -PRON- brain get slowly and wearily back to -PRON- foot 
-PRON- take deliberate aim and -PRON- left gun spat once at the pirate leader 
lanoth stagger the weight of -PRON- gun swing -PRON- limp arm to -PRON- side and -PRON- crash to the ice in a crumple heap 
the reptile man come forward in a rush 
miriam be about to turn from the window when suddenly from out of the darkness in the direction of the penal institute there charge more than a hundred spaceclad giant some swinge huge sword above -PRON- head other fire wauxum gun rapidly as -PRON- plough through the frosty ice dash straight toward the band of half man 
some of the pirate crew seek to escape by flee into -PRON- ship 
but -PRON- line be quickly break hack to piece by flicker doubleedge sword blast out of existence by gun in capable hand 
soon -PRON- be all over 
out there on the ice lie the member of inhuman crew 
none live save those who have seal -PRON- in the pirate ship ope blossom anew in heart 
guard from the prison have come to the aid have defeat the pirate and make -PRON- possible for janice to be take on to dr vacor 
perhaps -PRON- be not yet too late suddenly ship shoot upward at an angle stern first with half -PRON- underjet work 
the big vessel roll and pitch -PRON- bank of keel rocket fire intermittently 
the survive reptile man be make a desperate effort to take off from pluto 
evidently unskilled hand be at the pilot control 
the roar of cross talk in phone cease abruptly 
an tative voice speak crisply in the plutonian tongue 
then as the pirate craft nose skyward under power of -PRON- propulsion rocket a thin line of green flame lance up from the roof of the prison 
two glononite shell explode with a fierce white glare against the forward hull of the laboring space ship 
a third tear away -PRON- jet 
-PRON- roll over slowly fold nose upon stern and plunge downward a seared and twist mass of wreck metal to a final resting place in the bleak mountain range that fange the eastern sk 
space piracy in the universe have end miriam know with the destruction of that mighty ship 
the crusade be finish and the iron man could now unmask reveal -PRON- identity and retire to a life of peace and quiet 
who be the wanderer 
and what be the grudge that lanoth have harbor against walter brundage 
brundage the wanderer and two of the guardsman approach the little ship 
-PRON- be come to take janice on to the prison hospital to dr vacor 
what would janice find there life 
yes possibly 
life in the form of an encephalitic lethargy that would drift ultimately into death taut nerve give way 
the young woman faint slide slowly to the floor still tightly clasp -PRON- unconscious child to -PRON- bosom 
later miriam garth open -PRON- eye in the prison hospital 
-PRON- be on a long examine table and dr yedell vacor be bend over -PRON- 
the huge physician offer a small vial fill with a thick yellow liquid 
-PRON- swallow the drug and immediately feel new life surge through -PRON- vein 
vacor smile say -PRON- roof lookout observe -PRON- encounter with the pirate and -PRON- send guardsman to -PRON- assistance 
-PRON- bring -PRON- here 
-PRON- daughter be safe in the room with -PRON- father 
-PRON- have -PRON- regain consciousness face cloud 
-PRON- have not mistress garth 
-PRON- be a case that baffle -PRON- 
-PRON- condition be the same as -PRON- father and i have be able to do nothing for -PRON- other than to keep -PRON- alive with intravenous injection of concentrated food and to take precaution against the collapse of -PRON- digestive system through disuse 
what be the nature of -PRON- illness 
miriam ask 
three year ago earth time say vacor when -PRON- husband come to serve -PRON- sentence in this prison ha make a most unusual request 
-PRON- ask to be place in a chamber that have be specially insulate with a certain combination of metal 
daniel garth be a scientist of prominence not a man with a criminal record so as superintendent of the institution consent 
i know -PRON- have sufficient reason 
shortly after -PRON- entrance here -PRON- fall into a stupor and physical degeneration set in rapidly 
the latter cease immediately however when -PRON- be place in the insulated room 
i have keep life in -PRON- but i have fail to restore -PRON- to consciousness for one small instant 
-PRON- be not disease -PRON- have fall before the influence of some strange electrical emanation the nature of which i can not understand 
neither can i discover -PRON- source 
-PRON- daughter be in the room with -PRON- father 
perhaps some day -PRON- will recover completely 
i do not know iriam tug at the physician sleeve 
-PRON- have not tell -PRON- everything doctor -PRON- exclaim -PRON- voice edge with hysteria thing like this could not just happen 
i know that this wave of electrical energy have be intentionally direct against daniel and janice by some intelligent be some person who wish to destroy -PRON- both 
and if -PRON- be securely shield from the wave why do -PRON- not regain consciousness 
-PRON- have form some theory doctor 
-PRON- must tell -PRON- 
-PRON- be correct 
mistress garth in -PRON- assumption that a deliberate attempt have be make upon the life of -PRON- husband and daughter 
i have definitely establish that fact 
the prison cosmic ray engineer have register the emanation on -PRON- detector but the wave be of such an infinitely high frequency that -PRON- instrument be not sufficiently sensitive to indicate the direction from whence -PRON- come but -PRON- have not explain why -PRON- do not regain consciousness 
vacor speak slovly 
indeed i have not 
and i find -PRON- the most difficult of all explanation 
i be a medical man not a scientist well verse in electrodynamic or cosmic ray radiation so i shall make the situation as clear to -PRON- as i possibly can 
the human body as well as any give amount of matter vibrate at a certain frequency peculiar to -PRON- own size weight and chemical composition 
to subject a human body to a wave whose frequency be the same as -PRON- own would bring about a number of physical change 
the brain would be most disastrously affected since -PRON- be the seat of the sense 
the fierce upheaval of the identical frequency beat together would almost instantly obliterate the mind drive out the ego the intelligence 
next there would follow a general break down of the vital organ there be a deathlike pallor upon face and -PRON- voice sound hollow in the great room 
then the mind of daniel and janice have be utterly destroy 
not destroy vacor say but release from -PRON- body 
-PRON- motion toward the darkness beyond the window 
-PRON- be out there perhaps or in this very room with -PRON- 
-PRON- do not know can not know unless -PRON- return to -PRON- body 
let -PRON- hope -PRON- do so 
miriam ponder the immensity of the thought 
-PRON- be beyond credence 
human intelligence tear from -PRON- fleshy garment to be hurl naked out into eternity 
where else 
drifter in time and space 
would -PRON- ever return to -PRON- body or be there some unknown and immutable physical law that would prevent at this point walter brundage come to the table 
lanoth have regain consciousness and wish to make a statement before -PRON- die -PRON- say 
the wanderer want -PRON- as a witness doctor 
-PRON- cross the large room and enter a small operating cell in the surgery department on the left 
the wanderer and a prison physician stand at either end of a metal table on which there lie a broadshouldered young earthman 
the die man turn -PRON- head slightly so that -PRON- fail eye may bear upon the newcomer 
miriam garth gasp 
why -PRON- falter why -PRON- jean 
jean gossard 
i canot believe -PRON- 
yes miriam the whitefaced man on the table murmur jean gossard -PRON- childhood playmate be bor lanoth the pirate 
i make this statement so that i may find some measure of peace in death lanoth or gossard cough blood bubbling on -PRON- lip 
dr vacor administer a stimulant 
the pirate rest a moment then go on as -PRON- know miriam daniel garth and i both love -PRON- when -PRON- be youngster on earth 
-PRON- care only for daniel 
this cause -PRON- to hate -PRON- to hate -PRON- to hate even -PRON- father 
neither of -PRON- ever suspect -PRON- for i guard -PRON- secret closely 
-PRON- hatred flame higher when daniel finish -PRON- science course at the university with high honor while i fail miserably 
something happen to -PRON- mind i do not know what and i swear to make each of -PRON- pay dearly for what i then consider a great wrong a space ship to venus and there join a band of pirate 
use the name bor lanoth i eventually become -PRON- leader and build up a powerful organization 
-PRON- be not necessary to recount -PRON- deed now 
-PRON- be well known to -PRON- 
when denexium be discover on merthel and -PRON- father go there miriam to supervise personally the mining i feel that -PRON- revenge be close at hand 
and when -PRON- and daniel join -PRON- -PRON- be i who take the cargo of denexium which daniel garth be accuse of steal 
i work out the false evidence that convict -PRON- 
-PRON- be innocent 
a pained expression twist the feature of walter brundage 
-PRON- bow -PRON- head should have know -PRON- -PRON- mutter be sorry miriam 
miriam place -PRON- cheek against -PRON- father shoulder take -PRON- big hand in -PRON- small one word come again in a whisper and -PRON- be i who subject daniel to the ray that force -PRON- intelligence from -PRON- body 
but i do not direct a wave against -PRON- daughter 
-PRON- after attain a certain age and size and be the child of daniel garth and consequently of similar chemical construction become affect by a harmonic of the fundamental wave from -PRON- transmitter 
-PRON- become attuned in much the manner as -PRON- in order to escape etheric noise and distortion adjust -PRON- visigraph receiver to a harmonic of the transmitting station 
why do -PRON- not transmit this wave against garth early in -PRON- year of bond freedom 
vacor ask wish to greatly lanoth reply feebly because i fear -PRON- would trace the steal denexium to -PRON- buyer on mar 
but i do not perfect -PRON- transmitter until the latter part of the year 
then mmch experimentation be necessary in order to determine the natural wave length of -PRON- body 
where be this transmitter 
brundage demand 
-PRON- be destroy with -PRON- ship 
there be no longer an emanation 
lanoth turn -PRON- head slightly 
now wanderer -PRON- have vanquish -PRON- 
the the universe be wait to learn -PRON- identity 
tell -PRON- as -PRON- promise 
and and jean gossard alias bor lanoth the pirate be dead 
but the wanderer say nothing 
-PRON- be lean against the wall for support -PRON- arm hang motionless at -PRON- side the red glow in -PRON- electric eye dim rapidly 
miriam suddenly remember that -PRON- have see -PRON- shoot down in -PRON- battle with the pirate 
the wanderer be wound -PRON- cry 
lanoth shoot -PRON- will attend -PRON- vacor exclaim 
as vacor start toward the wanderer a young physician dash into the room 
dr vacor -PRON- say breathlessly 
daniel garth and the child be regain consciousness 
come quickly 
with a glad cry miriam run past the young doctor and out of the room 
brundage and vacor support the wanderer between -PRON- follow 
a weak and slightly emaciate daniel garth sit on the side of -PRON- cot smiling 
miriam fling -PRON- into -PRON- husband arm tear of gladness stream dovn -PRON- cheek 
daniel -PRON- choke 
garth speak soft word of greeting 
little janice who sit on the cot beside -PRON- father say that be a bad old dream i have daddy 
brundage and vacor come in with the limp heavy body of the wanderer sag between -PRON- 
both speak heartily to garth 
daniel garth laugh 
do not concern yourself further with that heap of metal -PRON- say 
toss -PRON- into a corner 
i have finish with -PRON- 
the two man stare 
what do -PRON- mean 
vacor ask quickly suspiciously mean say garth that -PRON- be burden yourself with an inanimate object 
brundage turn to vacor 
perhaps -PRON- brain be not yet clear -PRON- say laugh again 
-PRON- mind be perfectly clear i assure -PRON- 
i will explain 
i build that robot in -PRON- laboratory on merthel some year ago synthesize a brain which i place in -PRON- skull 
the auditory nerve be connect with the microphone that serve as ear the optical nerve with the retinascopic photoelectric cell and the nerve of speech with the reproducer 
the motor nerve doctor be connect with the mechanism that activate the robot body delicate relay make and break the different circuit in the course of motivation 
power come from a small almost inexhaustible battery of -PRON- own design 
the brain be nourish by a certain fluid a pump circulate through -PRON- and brundage place the robot in a chair 
-PRON- be marvelous vacor murmur do not fully understand how the synthetic brain be come to that garth go on 
year ago on earth jean gossard bor lanoth and i experiment with a high frequency wave which -PRON- hope would release the human intelligence from the body 
-PRON- obtain little success and give up 
on merthel i experiment further wish to liberate -PRON- own intelligence so that i may project -PRON- into the brain of the robot 
then i be convict of steal a cargo of denexium and be force to give up -PRON- laboratory work 
toward the latter part of -PRON- year of bond freedom i trace the denexium to a certain buyer in dotho mar 
i secrete -PRON- in this buyer warehouse several time and gain much information 
i learn that -PRON- be lanoth who have steal the stuff and make -PRON- appear that i be the thief further learn that lanoth be about to loose a secret wave against -PRON- 
the pirate be aware of -PRON- effort to trace the metal and -PRON- do not want -PRON- to prove -PRON- innocence 
peculiar physical symptom which i experience later indicate that lanoth have start transmit -PRON- wave 
the symptom disappear before i have suffer to any great extent only to return at regular intefval for several day 
then -PRON- cease 
the realiaation suddenly come to -PRON- that this be the sanie ray with which gossard and i have experiment on earth 
lanoth then must be jean gossard 
and -PRON- be seek to find the natural wave length of -PRON- body 
soon -PRON- would be successful 
with only a few day of liberty remain to -PRON- i hasten to merthel change the appearance of -PRON- space ship place the robot on board and hide the ship in a mountain range near brundage city 
then i come here to start serve -PRON- sentence and request the insulated room 
i want ray to release -PRON- intelligence but i wish -PRON- body shield against physical deterioration 
when the ray force out -PRON- intelligence i i shall call -PRON- intelligence enter the brain of the robot and start a warfare against lanoth and piracy in general too perfect a ray transmitter and incorporate -PRON- in the body of the robot in order that i may project -PRON- ego out of the synthetic brain when necessary release -PRON- intelligence tonight just after lanoth die and i -PRON- intelligence go out to assist drift ego back into -PRON- little body 
-PRON- have hear statement now with -PRON- -PRON- have a clear picture of the whole affair 
walter brundage step forward 
-PRON- boy -PRON- say huskily do not know what to say about the part i take in prosecute -PRON- 
what can i do 
erase -PRON- from -PRON- memory garth tell -PRON- 
the thunder of voice fill the room 
by garth 
then -PRON- be daniel garth clasp -PRON- wife and daughter to -PRON- be or be -PRON- say the wanderer of the void 
come soon a new penton and blake interplanetary exploration story by 295b a this i a to former slorie a power have be so comma ffls power by twe to i etarre have not speak to -PRON- -PRON- be -PRON- be -PRON- tvyo e that the supreme -PRON- out so reij mold -PRON- i land i notice for several moor -PRON- stroocle dissolve -PRON- will be mere ghost master novelette of world conquest the i a die world stand alone upon the balcony 
at -PRON- back tower the observatory with -PRON- mammoth telescope 
below the balcony rough rocky clifs fall away to meet the restless sea which roll and toss fretfully 
-PRON- sweep the vast panorama before -PRON- with lidless eye 
from this prominence the country be visible for mile 
off to one side in the distance loom jagged peak 
on one of these stand a power plant an energy radiator one of the countless broadcaster which dot earth in the portion still inhabit by man 
the man if such -PRON- could be call gaze into the darken heaven 
behind the observatory the sun hang low in the sky 
-PRON- have be that way for several hour -PRON- slow movement barely perceptible rotation be many time slow after five million year 
mernoq -PRON- represent an amazing spectacle 
-PRON- be a man whom -PRON- ancestor of five million year before would have disown as an incredible monster 
give a latitude of fifty thousand century evolution have work strange prank on mankind 
the biped which have hold reign over dominion for the great share of -PRON- long varied existence be much unlike -PRON- predecessor of the remotely distant mechanical age 
be -PRON- fate coincidence or a dominating undying spark which have see mankind speed beyond the star to flee by author of little hercule the jameson satellite etc mankind triumphant over all obstacle which have beset -PRON- path 
since the mechanical age man have alternately scale the height of utopia and have taste the dreg of chaos and degeneration stark shadow have fall often across the portal of civilization yet the human race have prove -PRON- undye 
year of worldly strife have come and go insect scourge have threaten and nearly win pestilence have wave -PRON- grimy scepter throughout the solar system and there have be interplanetary warfare 
bad of all there have come invasion by space wanderer creature from the faroff star nearly invincible and equally as threaten 
mankind on -PRON- planet and moon of the solar system have suffer enslavement 
only by the the weird cavalcade bleed inside the illuminate chamber destruction of venus entire atmosphere have mankind destroy the inthe lifeless solar system of the fyfyre i vader 
this have happen long ago yet the earthman remember 
mernoq be a typical earthman 
-PRON- stand between four and five foot in height 
stand upright on two leg which be joint to move in either of two direction -PRON- have four arm two on each side each member terminate in eight finger 
the leg be much long than the body 
during the last hundred thousand year or more the body have grow small due to the increase diminution and final disappearance of the digestive tract and organ of respiration 
to keep alive humanity no longer find -PRON- necessary to eat and breathe 
science have supplant the comparatively short existence of the gastric organ with a more practical mean of austenance radioactive blood be keep charge with energy from the huge broadcasting unit 
oxygen be superfluous 
in this manner the life span have be materially increase until a life of ten thousand year have become common 
the head of mernoq have neither mouth nor nostril 
like the appendix of man the unused mouth have finally disappear 
food no longer exist and articulate speech have long since yield to mental telepathy 
on either side of the head be slightly elongate ear curve to catch the slight of sound 
two black lidless eye peer intently from the face intelligence radiate from -PRON- depth 
humanity have do away vith sleep 
like food and oxygen -PRON- vas no longer necessary 
the energy broadcaster recharge the body constantly 
hair that telltale mark of barbarism have become unknown among earthman 
instead of hair there arise from the head fully two dozen antennae 
these serve a double purpose 
-PRON- pick up the think wave of -PRON- fellowman and also receive the broadcasted energy which supply -PRON- body 
mernoq stand look at the distant broadcaster which throw pink wave of light in every direction 
from this station -PRON- and the member of the observatory staff receive the energy -PRON- body require 
reception except in the case of the more powerful broadcaster be limit to a thousand mile or less number of broadcaster in one vicinity vary in accordance with the amount of population 
there be few spot on surface one stand in danger of starvation 
turn mernoq enter the observatory climb a few short step to where several of -PRON- companion be group about a table 
upon -PRON- stand intricate machine 
several of the earthman be gaze at a large screen upon which the great telescope project what -PRON- see 
a large pair of fiery star occupy the center of the field 
mernoq speak mentally 
the antenna of -PRON- comrade quiver slightly in attentiveness 
the long night will soon be upon -PRON- with -PRON- terrible coldness 
then -PRON- must retreat into the seal chamber 
sirius be nov near the zenith 
eloow indicate the bright double star with a wave of -PRON- arm 
-PRON- be time that uljoph return say one of the other 
-PRON- have be go over thirtyfive year on -PRON- expedition to the twin sun of sirius rumor have come to -PRON- say mernoq 
do not yet fear that the expedition have become lose in space 
perhaps tonight -PRON- telescope may pick up the return space ship rumor wnat have -PRON- hear 
manipulate a set of control at -PRON- side eloow look up inquiringly into the face of mernoq 
the rest watch the screen eagerly 
sirius dim away into the distance as the telescopic field be bring closer to earth 
vacuum yawn blackly at -PRON- 
black and empty 
reod exclaim 
mernoq remain silent in spite of this gloomy remark 
-PRON- be think deeply 
earth be a die planet 
a space expedition have be send to alpha centauri in an effort to find a planet outside the dead solar system to which mankind may migrate 
alpha centauri be find to possess sixteen planet none of -PRON- however suitable for habitation 
the expedition to sirius have immediately follow 
-PRON- shall wait five year more say mernoq and then another expedition will start out for still another star 
but where 
-PRON- have not be definitely decide 
many of the nearer star have be suggest 
but -PRON- shall give this expedition time to prove -PRON- 
both uljoph and aamon be among the good commander of the earthman 
why didnot -PRON- go -PRON- instead of aamon 
-PRON- have always seem bitter against -PRON- for -PRON- unparalleled success especially because the earthman have place -PRON- faith and reliance in -PRON- to lead -PRON- know mernoq reply 
that be the very reason i send -PRON- 
i give -PRON- the chance to distinguish -PRON- along with uljoph 
aamon be a mental genius and should be encourage what of tonight 
eloow want to know 
-PRON- say -PRON- have have word 
-PRON- have observe nothing with -PRON- telescope reply mernoq 
the observatory at yigni however have send -PRON- strange report 
as -PRON- be probably aware -PRON- not only have the most powerful telescope in the world but the most erratic one 
-PRON- have sacrifice clarity for great magnification 
i receive a report from bralel who be station there 
-PRON- report see a flash of the expedition space ship return from sirius 
the vision blot and fade 
-PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- telescopic figure 
if those at yigni really see the space ship come home i calculate that -PRON- would show up on -PRON- screen either today or else tonight -PRON- information act as balm for the impatience of the earthman 
but fully two month be to elapse before the space ship actually arrive 
radio communication at that distance be impossible 
civilization wait expectantly and anxiously 
failure have crown a previous effort 
optimism however rule to such a marked extent that partial preparation have be make for a departure from earth 
the laboratory and workshop be keep busy 
one question be uppermost in the mind of all 
have uljoph and aamon find a perfect world in the system of sirius or have failure fall upon the earthman once more 
and then one day the ship arrive plumbing wane atmosphere at a greatly reduce speed 
out of -PRON- pour the force of uljoph and aamon 
-PRON- be unusually jubilant and seem glad to be among -PRON- own kind once more after a departure of three and a half decade 
-PRON- immediately join mernoq 
why do -PRON- not radio -PRON- ask -PRON- 
-PRON- proximity with sirius destroy many vital part of -PRON- send apparatus but -PRON- hear -PRON- message before enter the solar system uljoph reply 
-PRON- will be necessary to construct -PRON- send apparatus on different principle when -PRON- return once more within the influence of sirius state aamon 
return echo mernoq 
then -PRON- have be successful 
-PRON- have be the enthusiastic reply -PRON- be a colorful story which uljoph related 
after fifteen year of space flight -PRON- have reach sirius discover that -PRON- possess twentyseven planet 
the planet vary in size present vary condition 
many of -PRON- have moon 
commence from the innermost planet the earthman have explore -PRON- all even to the outermost world distantly remove from the dazzle orb of sirius 
two world have be find to be ideal 
-PRON- be the sixth and eighth planet 
the seventh world be habitable but be overrun with rank vegetation and loathsome form of life 
zyse the sixth planet be much to be prefer 
bexn the eighth world teem with animal life boast a strange race of intelligent creature 
zyse be by far the most beautiful world of the entire system 
-PRON- must desert this wornout world say mernoq 
the vanguard of -PRON- people will soon start for zyse 
but there must be more preparation make aamon argue 
-PRON- can not start at once 
mernoq see with disappointment that attitude be antagonistic 
-PRON- see enmity in -PRON- glance the enmity which mernoq hope -PRON- would have lose on the trip to sirius 
the great leader reply however be conciliatory 
yes preparation be indeed necessary before the great share of -PRON- leave for the new world -PRON- admit 
yet during -PRON- absence -PRON- optimism lead -PRON- to construct many space ship 
a vast fleet of -PRON- be equip and ready now on mar 
no 
i do not intend leave for the new system until the last contingent go 
that will be a long time yet 
i shall go with the last ship which be to carry the valuable kletin metal now store on venus 
month later the wait space ship on the planet mar head for zyse 
-PRON- be the forerunner of the exodus the first ship to leave the old system 
from that time on ship continually leave for the new home planet until several year later there be but a few left 
strangely enough aamon show no desire to head contingent to zyse 
mernoq be glad for aamon be valuable and seem to have get over -PRON- old envy 
beneath the monolith have become nearly abandon as mernoq and two hundred of -PRON- man stand on the desolate planet venus 
the sun huge globe hang just at the edge of the horizon 
venus have cease rotate 
one side forever face the sun a red hot hemisphere 
the other side freeze cold by the temperature of space lie dark and as equally desert 
the atmosphere be go a terrific war with the invader from a distant star have destroy the envelope of air rip open fissure in the planet release the inner element and have blow the cruel invader into eternity 
venus be as dead and desert as moon or mar 
star shine crystal clear all about the sun gleam and twinkling 
in space suit the force of mernoq walk over the cold surface of the planet 
mernoq have bring the space ship to rest upon the narrow thousand mile strip of shadowland between the cold and flame hemisphere of the dead world 
mernoq now give instruction to aamon 
stay with the ship while -PRON- descend into the underground chamber after the kletin metal 
be sure that the energy broadcaster continue to function properly 
-PRON- shall be back shortly 
enclose in the bulky space suit with -PRON- multitude of exterior apparatus the earthman head for a tall monolith rise from a clump of rock which strew -PRON- base 
reod shine a peculiar ray of green intensity from -PRON- space suit upon the broad base of the tover 
almost immediately a doorway open 
in a long line the weird cavalcade file inside and down a broad flight of step into a large chamber 
the wall glow radiate an ethereal light of -PRON- own 
in the center of the chamber stand a massive machine -PRON- various part form of intricate apparatus 
this be the auxiliary energy broadcaster to be use in case the one on the space ship fail or in the event that the space ship be move away from the vicinity 
the side of the vast chamber be pierce with small doorway lead to the storeroom of the kletin 
when charge with a peculiar force of light produce by the earthman this metal furnish gravity for the floor of space ship 
-PRON- be to be find in large quantity upon the planet uranus and the earthman have mine considerable of -PRON- on this far planet and move -PRON- to venus for storage 
in group the earthman enter the storeroom and start the removal of the kletin 
mernoq see one of the earthman walk toward -PRON- with a load in -PRON- four arm 
-PRON- be ibaeg and -PRON- action seem a strange one 
other be also emerge from the storeroom with the metal but with the exception of ibaeg -PRON- be all head for the broad stairway lead to the surface 
ibaeg where be -PRON- take that 
the man make no reply but hurry -PRON- pace 
-PRON- run straight for the energy broadcaster 
mernoq and -PRON- subordinate be stand at the opposite end of the machine 
ibaeg be approach from the other side 
sense trouble of some sort uljoph hurry toward ibaeg seek to intercept -PRON- 
but -PRON- be not quick enough 
stride up to the dormant energy plant ibaeg throw with all four arm -PRON- load of metal into the mechanism 
there come a crash note of twisted part ernoq stare aghast at this strange action uncomprehende 
the miscreant legge -PRON- for the flight of stair those near -PRON- too surprised to think of pursuit 
besides aamon and more of the earthman be in the space ship outside 
ibaeg could not escape 
-PRON- action have be that of a madman 
-PRON- be seemingly pointless 
at the foot of the stair uljoph stop and stare upward 
be -PRON- mad -PRON- demand 
ibaeg make no reply 
-PRON- be nearly to the doorvay vhich lead from the monolith base when a terrific roar shake the subterranean chamber 
then come a mighty concussion as if a gigantic body have thud against the ground far above 
with a frightful crash and billow accompaniment of dust a great white boulder svept ibaeg off -PRON- foot and beneath -PRON- roll dovm the stone step grind -PRON- to powder and smash into the rocky wall 
uljoph leap out of the way just in time 
the curtain of rock dust spread like a veil as large piece fall from the fractured wall block the upward passage completely 
the monolith have fall exclaim reod 
-PRON- stare at the ruin in dismay 
there be an explosion 
all become quiet 
the rock dust settle slowly 
for a moment the earthman survey the clogged passage in mental silence 
not a square foot of opening be leave 
-PRON- be seal as if in a tomb 
-PRON- must signal aamon 
-PRON- can dig -PRON- out with disintegrator 
a call be send out to aamon 
the reply which come back jar the sensibility of the earthman bad than have the strange action of ibaeg or the succeed explosion of the monolith 
mernoq -PRON- reign be at an end come -PRON- vindictive thought wave 
ibaeg do -PRON- work well the broadcaster be break and -PRON- be entomb 
when i leave for earth -PRON- will all die 
i shall be free to build -PRON- own empire in the new system of planet but -PRON- man i have loyal man aboard ship exclaim mernoq more out of surprise and consternation than contradiction 
dead mernoq all dead just as -PRON- shall soon be gloat aamon 
-PRON- supporter be many i now return to earth where i shall set a time explosion to detonate the atmosphere in the same manner employ by the earthman who destroy the atmosphere of venus age ago -PRON- be mad aamon shall be safe far beyond the solar system when the cataclysm take place 
when i reach zyse i shall conquer the martian vanguard of ship and all other ship which have leave since then alone shall be all powerful 
now die mernoq -PRON- and all -PRON- puppet mernoq look around at -PRON- companion who be stricken dumb by the rapid succession of event all plan so well by the evil genius of aamon 
in each other eye -PRON- read the agreement of the certain doom to befall -PRON- 
the space ship contain the source of -PRON- sustenance be go 
the auxiliary plant in the chamber where -PRON- stand be wreck 
-PRON- situation be truly desperate have two hour in which to live be quiet yet deadly ultimatum 
-PRON- may be able to repair the damage which ibaeg do but unless -PRON- hurry such repair several of the earthman who be skilled mechanic set to work on the damage broadcaster 
-PRON- work steadily remove the damage part and repair -PRON- 
time move by 
an insidious sensation of weakness commence creep over the earthman 
suddenly one workman sway dizzily 
another workman spring to the task take the place of -PRON- fall comrade 
mernoq experience a strong urge to sit down 
-PRON- leg seem no longer capable of hold -PRON- body upright 
-PRON- fight desperately against this urge 
when -PRON- knee sag -PRON- be promptly catch in the arm of a companion who ease -PRON- gently to the floor 
the time -PRON- inquire 
how long have -PRON- 
less than half an hour for most of -PRON- be the grim reply few of -PRON- may last even longer than that 
mernoq feel -PRON- lapse into unconsciousness 
fully threequarter of the earthman have weaken and fall 
some retain -PRON- sense yet be too feeble to move 
the lack of energy be make -PRON- feel 
the the lever come the weak mental communication from one of the earthman who stagger to the machine with the two remain part 
two of -PRON- companion weave in the direction of the starting lever while the other stand at -PRON- side to assist -PRON- 
behind -PRON- mernoq rise weakly upon -PRON- four hand 
a strong subconscious prompting have return -PRON- to consciousness 
-PRON- seem unable to rise 
-PRON- watch cyponom reach for the lever with one hand -PRON- remain three arm cling to various nearby portion of the machine to support -PRON- sag body 
yxlese reel helplessly against -PRON- fellow mechanic drop the remain bit of apparatus in -PRON- place 
the piece have only to be fasten 
yxlese reach out weakly to give the necessary twist 
-PRON- arm stiffen and never reach the mechanism for -PRON- support comrade fall yxlese slump across -PRON- inert body 
through a haze of semiconsciousness cyponom watch mernoq crawl forward through an effort of tremendous will power reach the machine and pull -PRON- slowly upward 
a dizzy mist obscure the vision of cyponom 
when -PRON- clear -PRON- see mernoq sag backward and hit the floor heart sink 
at the last vital moment failure have mock -PRON- 
-PRON- be the only one leave with -PRON- sense part of -PRON- and -PRON- be rapidly leave -PRON- 
-PRON- cling tight but seem too weak to hang on any long 
-PRON- feel -PRON- grip weakening 
-PRON- eye wander to the part which mernoq have make one final effort to reach and turn 
-PRON- heart skip a beat 
-PRON- be fasten 
mernoq have reach -PRON- 
a darkness overwhelmed cyponom 
the final order from -PRON- brain command three reluctant arm to drop -PRON- hold and seize the lever which the other arm hold with -PRON- eight finger 
as cyponom fall the weight of -PRON- body pull the lever 
a grind noise issue from the machine 
pink vibration of light dance from the apparatus form a shimmer of color around -PRON- 
strew about the vast chamber lie nearly two hundred unconscious earthman many of -PRON- close to death 
entomb -PRON- broadcaster roar into action 
soon the revive earthman -PRON- antenna pick up the energy from the wave which penetrate -PRON- space suit commence to rise how much well off be -PRON- now lamented reod 
-PRON- be entomb -PRON- be alive return mernoq spiritedly and while life still exist within -PRON- body -PRON- may yet dare to hope 
the philosophy of mernoq be sound 
upon this philosophy mankind have clung tenaciously to life throughout the age in the face of adversity 
how be -PRON- to reach earth without space ship even if -PRON- do escape this place query uljoph 
reach earth be but half as important as send out a warning of treachery and -PRON- plan to explode the atmosphhere 
but -PRON- have no way of get to earth nor any way of signal in time to forestall plan say uljoph have a plan mernoq tell -PRON- a desperate plan one depend upon close calculation and long chance but first -PRON- must get free of this place 
mernoq would not divulge -PRON- hope 
first -PRON- say -PRON- must win through to the surface of venus 
the outlook be discourage 
on three side solid rock surround -PRON- 
the bowel of the planet lie beneath -PRON- foot while overhead lie heavy strata of mantle rock 
the avenue before -PRON- be block with massive fragment of the great monolith intersperse with rock debris from the crack wall of the passage once hear of a secret exit from this place say nenerm 
where be -PRON- do not know be the uncertain reply 
these chamber be old 
no one alive can remember when -PRON- be build 
there be a legend telling of an attempt escape of the space invader long ago 
a group of -PRON- burrow deep inside venus 
-PRON- be all destroy by the earthquake which follow the destruction of the atmosphere 
a passage from these cavern be suppose to lead through -PRON- secret exit 
then why be these cavern not destroy by the quake ask mernoq 
that be what throw doubt on the truth of the legend reply nanerm yet the legend exist 
mernoq at once order -PRON- man to tap the rock wall in search of hollow beyond 
the earthman spread out into small group search carefully the adjoin storeroom as well as the central chamber 
both wall and floor space be nearly cover before an excited telepathic communication burn -PRON- upon -PRON- brain 
-PRON- have find -PRON- 
mernoq and -PRON- subordinate officer hurry to the spot 
several of the earthman hold back a section of rock which balance nicely on a convex axis 
a dark passageway lie beyond 
uljoph advanced into -PRON- but mernoq motion -PRON- back 
let the stone swing into place -PRON- say 
-PRON- must be sure that -PRON- be dependable and will open at the right time in case -PRON- must return this way -PRON- stone swing back 
as mernoq have fear the opening of the secret door have be gropingly accidental 
after much experiment the concealed exit be reopen 
a combination of pressure movement on the nearby wall be necessary 
mernoq and -PRON- man take careful note of these 
-PRON- be then satisfied to enter 
-PRON- detail twenty of the earthman to stay with the energy broadcaster and keep -PRON- work properly 
watch -PRON- carefully 
-PRON- life and your depend upon -PRON- 
-PRON- shall follow this passage to the end 
if -PRON- fail to reach the surface -PRON- shall return 
if -PRON- win through -PRON- shall communicate with -PRON- when -PRON- arrive back at the spot where the monolith stand 
with these part instruction mernoq and the remainder of the earthman snap on the glowing light of -PRON- space suit and file into the cavity out of sight around a bend in the tunnel 
the opening be close softly behind -PRON- 
-PRON- tramp for mile through the interior of venus the tunnel slope gradually downward 
mernoq commence to despair of ever reach e the surface yet -PRON- be determined to follov the tunnel to -PRON- termination 
-PRON- become warm excessively so 
although the surface of venus be dead and cold the interior be not 
the earthman become aware of this more than ever as the passage continue -PRON- downward slant 
then through the gloom ahead of -PRON- -PRON- see the end of the subterranean passage 
-PRON- end blankly yet as -PRON- approach nearer and -PRON- light dispel the shadow -PRON- see faint square outline of a huge door 
a vague murmur beyond make -PRON- pause and grow apprehensive 
mernoq break the suspense by order -PRON- open 
several of the earthman seize the huge metal pull shake loose from -PRON- the dust of age 
no lock be in evidence 
construct of stone and metal the door be massively build tower far above the height of the earthman who tug at -PRON- 
contrary to the expectation of mernoq however the door open easily partly of -PRON- own volition so -PRON- seem as if -PRON- have wait patiently through the long century 
have the earthman only know -PRON- the door have remain closed for more than a quarter million year 
a black dust vomit forth from the doorway whirl and fall among the earthman 
there follow a rumble like a thunderclap 
beyond the doorway lie a vast cavern whose high wall throw back the red and green glow of lurid flame 
to -PRON- startled eye be reveal long tongue of fire shoot up to lick the ceiling 
-PRON- be no such flame as the burning of oxygen may produce 
the flame be red and terminate in oval tip edge with a bluegreen luminosity 
come 
mernoq strode fearlessly in direction of the rage inferno 
-PRON- man follow 
in warm palpable dust which rise nearly to -PRON- knee -PRON- walk slowly toward the brilliant fire which as -PRON- approach nearer -PRON- find issue from a broad deep crevice in the cavern floor 
the internal fire of venus never believe -PRON- come so close to the surface 
-PRON- stop at the edge of the fife pit and look across to where the cavern stretch away into the gloom 
dimly visible be several rocky corridor 
mernoq linger for a moment undecided as to direction but -PRON- see that one end of the crevice may be skirt and order the corridor to be explore 
-PRON- circle the flame cauldron to see what lie beyond 
uljoph draw attention to the cavern ceiling 
i be perfectly circular 
the cavern be not artificial 
an intelligence have construct -PRON- 
be the legend true 
have the invader fashion this place as a tomb or hideaway or have mankind make -PRON- way to the internal fire long ago in the forget past 
mernoq wonder 
-PRON- walk close to the ragged edge of the crevice and peer downward 
the fiery hell be fully a hundred yard across lurid flame obscure the bottom 
hide by the flame a boil inferno of molten rock gush in and out of the planet interior 
a mental cry of terror issue from across the darting flame 
the antennae on head tell -PRON- the direction from which the cry have come 
rapidly -PRON- and -PRON- companion circle the fire pit and race into the corridor from which the cry have issue 
other earthman be excitedly mill about inside 
in the center of the throng -PRON- come upon a ghastly scene 
seven earthman lie dead mutilate -PRON- space suit crush and rip 
the body have be tear to shred 
for a moment in the horror of the situation no one see the large box whose end flank the passage 
-PRON- lie on shelf 
uljoph be first to discover -PRON- 
-PRON- climb over the side of one and look down into the metal container 
-PRON- mind ejaculate one thought 
empty 
meanwhile other be examine more of the strange box warning come too late for a long tentacle slide up over the side of a container sharp metal claw e an inquisitive and unsuspecting earthman 
zougmre wriggle to free -PRON- 
a monstrous body surmount by a hideous head lift up and more tentacle wave wildly menacingly as the creature glare balefully at the surround earthman 
six snaky arm writhe from the black repulsive body protect by an artificial shell of metal 
the tentacle end be tip with metal sharpen to razoredge cut power 
a head with an eye in front and an eye in back of the oval cranium turn from side to side 
the eye stare intently exude a cold crafty expression of intelligence 
a blunt snout sniff inquisitively 
several of the near earthman spring to the aid of -PRON- stricken comrade but -PRON- be too late 
three more tentacle curl -PRON- around the doomed man cut -PRON- body to piece 
get out of here quick urge mernoq 
-PRON- be powerless to combat -PRON- 
down the corridor amble five of the insidious creature 
more of -PRON- be emerge from the metal container 
the earthman race to the comparative safety of the fire cavern 
what be -PRON- 
the invader exclaim mernoq 
the thing that conquer the solar system age ago -PRON- think -PRON- all dead 
impossible deplore reod 
how could -PRON- have live 
suspend animation reply mernoq whose astute mind have conceive the truth of the situation 
when -PRON- open that door -PRON- release force automatically which be necessary to bring -PRON- out of -PRON- sleep 
air machine be set to work too 
see 
there be air down here now point to the leap flame which seethe outward from the pit the bluegreen luminosity change in color as -PRON- yield to red and white heat 
a tremendous wave of hot air send -PRON- scurry backward make -PRON- aware of -PRON- warmth even throughtheir space suit 
-PRON- be weaponless against -PRON- cry uljoph 
mernoq realize this fact keenly 
the space invader be not only armor but doubtlessly possess weapon too 
mernoq hurriedly lead the way around the fire pit and into that black section of the cavern which lie ahead 
-PRON- be hope against hope 
-PRON- must go that way and hope for a continuance of the tunnel 
to return the way -PRON- have come would ultimately mean find -PRON- trap 
these thought fly swiftly among -PRON- 
what of the twenty man -PRON- leave with the energy broadcaster 
uljoph suggest 
suppose -PRON- attack in that direction 
the tunnel rise that way 
the air will die out in the upper level 
but if -PRON- air machine generate more air 
the ominous question remain as the earthman set out on a run past the fire pit the increase heat of the flame drive -PRON- far to one side near the vall apprehension grow less as -PRON- see ahead of -PRON- the continuation of the tunnel 
-PRON- have begin to fear that the cavern mark the tunnel end 
the earthman become weary after a mile or more of rapid running 
-PRON- be the desire of mernoq to put a goodly amount of distance between -PRON- and the hateful creature of the fire cavern 
the latter have suspend -PRON- in a live death to bridge the age with -PRON- menace 
subterranean battle the satisfaction of the earthman the tunnel strike a steep incline much steep than the one -PRON- have recently descend on leave the kletin storeroom 
in some place step have be cut because of the tendency toward perpendicular ascent 
the climb be a long one 
soon -PRON- find that the air manufacture below -PRON- be die out 
-PRON- be once more in the usual vacuum 
the low level have be leave behind 
-PRON- come to a long flight of step up which -PRON- climb to find -PRON- in another large cavern 
all around -PRON- lay water 
-PRON- be on an island in a subterranean lake 
-PRON- bright light reveal shore little more than a hundred yard away 
the island lie in nearly the exact center of the lake several hundred foot from shore 
-PRON- bear evidence of have be purposely construct 
the water or fluid of the lake which be closely akin to water take on a peculiar appearance to the eye of the earthman 
-PRON- appear dull and without lustre 
this be due largely to a lack of atmosphere 
how can -PRON- cross query uljoph 
-PRON- can hardly swim with -PRON- space suit 
if the water be not too deep cr the bottom be not full of hole -PRON- can walk across 
if -PRON- could but drain the lake down through the passage why original idea vas lose in a brilliant burst of inspiration 
-PRON- sudden enthusiasm be share by the rest 
drain the lake into the internal fire 
kill the monster 
for a moment mernoq feel -PRON- overwhelm by the possibility of the dare plan 
in -PRON- mind eye -PRON- see the water of the lake rush down the long tunnel fill the low level and cascade into the molten pit of fire 
there would be boil chaos cloud of steam the long dormant invader scald to death 
-PRON- indecision be short 
cut a channel 
the earthman set to work a will rapidly cut a ditch from the lake to the orifice of the tunnel in the island center 
luckily -PRON- possess the rock pick which make up an essential part of -PRON- space suit equipment 
rapid headway be make for the rock be a soft type peculiar to venus 
a large group start work from the tunnel entrance while other work up to -PRON- head in water at the lake edge -PRON- globe helmet rise out of the water only to disappear again 
mernoq send one of -PRON- man to gauge the depth of the lake 
the man walk out of sight the water swirl above -PRON- head 
from time to time -PRON- radiate report to -PRON- comrade above 
-PRON- space helmet finally break the surface of the water near the farther shore where -PRON- light have reveal a continuance of the tunnel 
the lake be comparatively shallow 
-PRON- can all walk across say mernoq 
when this water start drain into the low level -PRON- must hurry warn reod 
steam will be force back this way 
what of those -PRON- leave in the chamber of the broadcaster 
uljoph inquire 
if the steam rise -PRON- will die too 
the steam will seek the near and easy exit say mernoq 
besides remember the heavy stone block the entrance to the secret tunnel 
-PRON- will resist tremendous steam pressure of the earthman make a starfling discovery 
air be blow up the shaft 
-PRON- be rise into this cavern 
-PRON- be true 
a strong current of air blow up the tunnel bring a thin veil of dust with -PRON- 
mernoq fear the coming of the interstellar invader 
more atmosphere be be generate from the corridor lead off from the fire cavern 
-PRON- must hurry 
only a thin slice of rock separate the two channel which be nearly converge 
the earthman chop madly with -PRON- pick 
-PRON- have work frantically in shift only a fraction of -PRON- number be able to work unhampered in the ditch 
a scout mernoq have send down the tunnel now return 
-PRON- be come 
-PRON- have weapon 
a trickle of water burst over the lip of the tunnel lead from the island to the low level 
the alarm spur the laboring earthman to desperate measure in a superhuman effort to send the lake rush down the tunnel before -PRON- ancient mie could emerge 
upon the rise current of air come a deathly cry which the radiophone ear of the space helmet readily pick up 
-PRON- be eerie and chilling like no sound the earthman have ever before hear 
one of the terrible thing -PRON- have unwittingly revive strode into view below -PRON- on short squat leg 
in several of -PRON- long tentacle -PRON- carry gleam discs 
the earthman stand at the top of the shaft with upraised pick the only weapon -PRON- possess 
these be crude indeed compare to the destructive weapon which aamon have carry away on the space ship 
two of the pale disc beam fall on the nearer of the earthman focus for but a brief moment 
a round portion of each space suit glow red then disappear 
underneath the flesh of the earthman shine a ruddy hue iridescent spark shed -PRON- rapidlly 
the unfortunate man fall dead while the discs of fire continue to burn completely through -PRON- body 
the disc beam flick upon other of the band 
one of -PRON- stagger toward the water 
another sink to -PRON- knee beside the tunnel 
back -PRON- cry 
with all four arm -PRON- brush and strike madly at the glowing spot which eat through -PRON- space suit let -PRON- -PRON- rise suddenly and jump down upon the advance monster in a despairing leap as -PRON- feel the death ray eat swiftly into -PRON- vital 
-PRON- impetuous leap hurl back the interstellar invader upon four or five more who come crowd up from behind 
for a moment all be confusion in the tunnel tentacle hasten the death of the martyr man who have use -PRON- rapidly expire body to the great advantage 
extricate -PRON- from the tangle of body and tentacle the terrible creature of the fire pit scuffle up the shaft -PRON- disc ray wave wildly 
a deluge of rush water meet -PRON- hurl -PRON- backward 
one survivor clung with -PRON- tentacle to the lip of the tunnel opening 
with mighty strength -PRON- pull -PRON- out of the strong current 
fully a hundred pick hack -PRON- tentacle as all four arm of the near earthman rise and fall 
the dismember body devoid of anything with which to cling yield to the strong pull of the current 
the shriek head with -PRON- hateful venomous eye disappear beneath the cascading water the horrid screech muffle to a frantic gurgle or a moment the earthman seem root to the spot 
several of -PRON- number lie dead victim of the disc beam 
yet the earthman have triumph 
reod shake -PRON- head ruefully fear for those -PRON- leave in the chamber of the energy broadcaster 
-PRON- must get back to where the space ship land say mernoq 
then -PRON- shall learn if -PRON- be safe 
direction be quickly find and -PRON- head for the distant monolith which lie break and wreck because of the treacherous attempt aamon have make to send -PRON- all into eternity 
even now unsuspecting humanity upon the earth prepare for further contingent of the exodus while aamon be lay -PRON- plan 
the thought urge mernoq to great haste 
-PRON- have a plan in mind 
-PRON- be not long before the jagged remnant of the great monolith become visible upon the horizon 
the earthman hurry to the spot 
where the entrance to the subterranean chamber have be locate be now but a tumbled mass of rock 
mernoq send out a call to those -PRON- have leave imprison in the kletin chamber with the energy broadcaster 
-PRON- be answer 
-PRON- comrade be alive and the mechanism be function perfectly 
how be -PRON- to communicate with earth and warn -PRON- of treachery query reod 
-PRON- have no equipment 
do -PRON- realize what type of explosive aamon employ in destroy the monolith 
why yes 
the explosive be annite 
i recognize -PRON- when i hear the blast 
the mind of mernoq still remain reservedly inscrutable 
annite -PRON- continue be a queer explosive 
what do -PRON- mean 
-PRON- destructive force be tremendous yet -PRON- have a peculiar fault when explode in space or upon a planet which have no atmosphere 
why yes fragment of -PRON- be generally blow off -PRON- and fail to explode 
exactly 
mostly through a lack of barometric pressure 
and what good will that do -PRON- ask uljoph 
in one of these large rock -PRON- be go to hollow out a crude form of rocket gun mernoq explain 
-PRON- shall charge -PRON- with the fragment of unexploded annite which be strew about here on the ground 
in a brief flash -PRON- recognize purpose 
-PRON- be go to rocket a warning to the earth hope -PRON- would reach there in time to prevent the cataclysm which aamon have plan 
rocket message be hastily make 
with -PRON- pick the earthman commence fashion a rocket gun in the side of a huge slab which face away at the desire angle mernoq want 
for the construction of the rocket -PRON- mernoq search among the ruin at the monolith base for metal stanchion which have previously be build into the entranceway 
-PRON- be here that -PRON- make a discovery which -PRON- consider fortunate 
there be sufficient metal to build three rocket for dispatch to earth if -PRON- can gather annite to power all three 
can -PRON- send a message without -PRON- destruction when the rocket crash against earth 
arrange parachute to be release when the rocket hit atmosphere suggest uljoph 
or -PRON- may be able to fix reverse annite charge in various position so that the increase friction with atmosphere will explode -PRON- and slow up the rocket speed 
by search a large part of the vicinity where the explosion of annite have occur the earthman gather enough fragment to send off and equip with reverse charge all three of the rocket 
mernoq and -PRON- subordinate officer figure the mathematical position of the two planet and -PRON- movement quite carefully also estimate the force of the annite 
the rocket would hit -PRON- target 
-PRON- be a long chance these rocket uljoph say grimly 
what if none of -PRON- be find or suppose -PRON- land in an ocean where tjfiey can not be recover 
in that case say mernoq -PRON- will mean the destruction of atmosphere and all human being now on the planet 
-PRON- think that aamon have do -PRON- work and depart for zyse 
-PRON- have have time for -PRON- 
-PRON- only chance be to get word to -PRON- in time to charge the atmosphere with a counteracting gas 
one of telescope may discover -PRON- plight here suggest reod 
space ship may be send have be think the same say mernoq yet -PRON- be probable that aamon have a ready story to tell especially in regard to the demolish monolith 
each of the earthman measure the possibility and hope the gage at the observatory on the earth pick up the proximity and composition of all foreign object enter atmosphere 
some of the rocket would be trace and find 
the question of timely arrival however vas uppermost in -PRON- mind 
in spite of the terrific power and accelerate impetus afford by annite -PRON- would be a long time before the projectile reach earth 
a order the earthman set off the first rocket 
at long interval the other two be send into space 
off -PRON- hurtle in the direction of the greenglowing planet which glow steadily in the sky 
earth and venus be nearly in line and the sun position favor the sight of the rocket 
time must pass time which battle with the time aamon have set for the destruction of civilization 
the rocket not only contain message relate to perfidy but -PRON- also give specific direction for charge the atmosphere 
-PRON- be at suggestion that another chance of salvation be make possible 
mernoq employ this at once 
on a slope wall face the nlanet earth message be write in gigantic character on the chance that earth telescope may be train that way 
time drag for the wait earthman 
a close watch be keep upon the green star for the earthman be fearful of the telltale flash surround the planet which would tell of success 
the earthman know that -PRON- would be a long time before the stellar message reach earth a great number of time longer than passage by space ship 
only a few day have pass when one of the earthman issue a mental cry of excitement which bring the general focus of attention immediately upon the green glow planet vhich swing far off in space heart chill with fear 
have the gigantic cataclysm be unloose at last 
-PRON- keen eye search for the telltale glare of destruction 
instead -PRON- see several bright speck grow large in the sky 
-PRON- expand to view as -PRON- come and -PRON- see that -PRON- be space ship 
five in number -PRON- cruise about the vicinity of the wreck monolith finally settle to rest 
the strand earthman watch in undecided anticipation 
be this help arrive or have aamon return to finish the sinister work which have narrowly fail -PRON- the first time 
several figure step from the near ship and approach -PRON- 
mernoq with gladness in -PRON- heart recognize one of -PRON- as eloow atmosphere cry mernoq voice the apprehension uppermost in -PRON- mind 
be -PRON- save -PRON- do not yet know for certain but -PRON- hope for the good how do -PRON- get here so soon 
-PRON- send rocket but that be but a few day ago -PRON- read -PRON- cliff message from -PRON- space ship say eloow 
-PRON- be already on -PRON- way here 
but aamon where be -PRON- 
on -PRON- way to zyse but -PRON- be a small start -PRON- have 
-PRON- leave for venus secretly almost at the start moment of ship in the direction of sirius 
-PRON- course of flight have diverge only at a slight angle from -PRON- own 
i be suspicious of -PRON- when -PRON- tell how the monolith have be destroy in blast a necessary passage into the kletin chamber 
-PRON- report that -PRON- and the other not return with -PRON- have decide to stay and move the kletin out upon the surface of venus before more ship be send for -PRON- be these ship to come for -PRON- 
mernoq ask 
sixteen earthly day hence 
when destruction of ai be consummate and -PRON- be safely on -PRON- way out of the solar system observe mernoq 
and -PRON- be find entomb and dead add eloow 
when -PRON- tele scope pick up the inscription -PRON- make on the cliff i dispatch one of -PRON- ship back to earth to take pre90 yentative measure against reachery 
the formula for charge the air 
mernoq interrogate eagerly 
the formula so long preserve and which be entrust to but a ievf of -PRON- -PRON- aamon and -PRON- include 
the same formula which -PRON- ancient ancestor use in keep the explode emanation from venus atmosphere harmless when -PRON- strike the atmosphere of earth 
then -PRON- fear be at rest for aamon would not have time the explosion to occur before -PRON- have leave the solar system and -PRON- say that -PRON- have but a short start 
that be so 
aamon must never reach zyse mernoq avovie 
-PRON- be unlikely that -PRON- shall reply eloow have suspect -PRON- ior a long time 
i never place the trust and confidence in -PRON- that -PRON- do 
on one reason or another i hold up most of the ship which be to leave with aamon but i could not manage to delay aamon -PRON- 
i do the next good thing 
i place a man aboard with order to hamper the speed of -PRON- ship in case -PRON- wish to catch up 
let -PRON- give chase at once 
mernoq hurried with eloow to -PRON- ship 
four ship rise from the cold dead surface of airless venus and race off into space 
the remain ship stay while -PRON- occupant set to work release the score of imprison earthman attend the energy radiator 
the course of ship have lead sunvard design on a straight course to sirius which would cut close to the orbit of mercury 
earthman eagerly scan the proximity detector as high speed be attain 
the four ship spread out so that -PRON- cruise several thousand mile apart 
-PRON- be near orbit when the sunward ship of the group first pick up the location of slowermove space ship 
the four pursue ship gradually converge 
a message be radiate for aamon to stop 
-PRON- answer be a vicious blast of power which narrowly miss the near ship of fleet 
aamon put on a sudden spurt of speed 
-PRON- be evident that minion who have be responsible for the slowing up of ship have be detect 
that -PRON- end have be a swift one neither eloow nor mernoq doubted 
the four ship keep abreast of at a safe distance 
another blaze of power go wide of -PRON- mark 
still another and much close charge cause one of the pursue ship to tumble crazily in space until -PRON- once more right -PRON- 
shall -PRON- fire ask eloow turn to mernoq 
mernoq nodded grimly 
the order be communicate to all four ship 
simultaneously blast leap out at the flee craft 
two of -PRON- strike 
-PRON- wait to see the extent of the damage ship demolish at one end roll awkwardly off -PRON- course still hurtle at meteoric speed 
mernoq and eloow watch the proximity detector 
a series of blast from the spacewrecke craft lash savagely and spitefully at -PRON- avenger 
-PRON- be ineffectual yet reveal dangerous potential which be still another barrage will finish -PRON- 
mernoq halt in the act of issue instruction as eloow grip -PRON- arm and point significantly at the proximity detector 
aamon have lose -PRON- propulsion power 
-PRON- be fall into the sun 
what end could be more fitting 
-PRON- have only to stand by at a safe distance and watch -PRON- go to a wellmerited death 
mernoq revise -PRON- order to fire 
instead -PRON- ship form a funeral consort about the doomed and helpless ship of -PRON- archenemy whom once -PRON- have trust and encourage 
-PRON- cruise too far distant for aamon to vent any further spite upon -PRON- although -PRON- make several vain attempt 
nearer and nearer the great flaming globe of the sun -PRON- race the initial momentum of ship at the time -PRON- have be strike swervingly divert tovvard the sun incandescent mass 
-PRON- have no power to change the course 
the end be inexorable 
so fast be the five ship move through space that soon the ship of the fleet commence to feel the tremendous drag of the sun immense attraction fall be accelerate 
-PRON- and -PRON- faithless crew be consign to a flame hell which would consume -PRON- long before -PRON- ever reach -PRON- 
-PRON- be to die a horrible linger death of suffocate heat watch torment ly the sunward side of -PRON- space ship grow red then vhitehot before -PRON- perish miserably 
something of this inevitable doom must have impress -PRON- on aamon for in the middle of the funeral cortege the cosmic coffin with -PRON- living and doom cargo burst suddenly into a bright flash of light 
where a slowmove dot have rest on the proximity detector there be now but a few tiny speck slowly radiate from a central point 
aamon have choose the easy way 
no longer do -PRON- stand as a menace to mankind peace and security in the exodus to the new world 
fim tit invasion of earth the theme of a powerful novelette of world within world complete in the next issue of the story present a brandnew conception of intermolecular life and -PRON- write by one of the lead science fiction author of the day tie amazing drama of control destiny be unreel by in -PRON- late novelette a thoughtprovoke story of supertelepathy and the mysterious force behind -PRON- 
a story -PRON- wonot soon forget author of the popular lanson screen return to -PRON- page next month with a timetravele novelette the exciting story of an earthman who suddenly find -PRON- hundred of year in the future with no possible way of return to -PRON- own time 
-PRON- be the world great astronomer and -PRON- give -PRON- the world large telescope 
yet when -PRON- warn humanity of the giant meteor calculate to collide with earth -PRON- laugh at -PRON- the initial situation of an absorb story of astronomical doom by also in -PRON- next issue 
all these and story by arthur barne frank long jr and other favorite writer be schedule for the next number 
in addition all -PRON- regular informative department and feature 
a ross superman of future eon know but one master evolution 
by author of the comet doom the accursed galaxy etc -PRON- little ratfaced man look fearfully at the mechanism in the corner of the lamplit laboratory 
-PRON- be like a tall cylindrical cage of metal bar connect electrically to the generator huge vacuum tube and other apparatus in the room 
-PRON- turn jerkily toward the other two people in the room 
one be a serious lanky young man the other a girl whose soft face be pale and whose dark eye hold hooded apprehension 
these two be ross sherill brilliant young biologist and -PRON- wife gail 
the ratlike little man ask fearfully be that the machine 
the thing -PRON- be go to use to to change -PRON- -PRON- fraham say ross sherill steadily 
the projector that be go to throw -PRON- a million year ahead of the rest of the human race in evolutionary development 
-PRON- serious eye kindle with scientific enthusiasm as -PRON- address the wizened little fraham evolution be ordinarily a very slow process -PRON- go on a physical and mental change which i recently -PRON- think i want to be a halfape a severed be cause by certain kind of cosmic radiation that effect slight change in -PRON- body force -PRON- race ever higher on the road of progress find out how to produce those force artificially many time strong 
so when i turn those vastly intensify force on -PRON- body -PRON- will in a few minute pass through evolutionary change that will take a million year for the rest of the race to pass through naturally 
yes but what will i change into cry fraham 
suppose i change into something awful what then 
once throw -PRON- ahead in development and observe what the human race will evolve into i can bring -PRON- back to -PRON- present status sherill tell -PRON- calmly find a certain cosmic radiation that reverse evolutionary change and use that on -PRON- 
the lanky young scientist take a packet of bill from -PRON- pocket the thousand dollar i agree to give -PRON- for submit to the experiment get -PRON- when be do raham stiffen at sight of the money and an ugly gleam come into -PRON- slitte eye may add that -PRON- will get the money only by undergo the experiment sherill add pleasantly have a pistol in -PRON- pocket and if -PRON- try shoot 
well what about -PRON- be -PRON- willing to undergo the experiment face be bead with perspiration and -PRON- eye roll from the money to the bulky enigmatic mechanism 
-PRON- finally speak hoarsely get to do -PRON- and -PRON- know -PRON- -PRON- know the police be hot after -PRON- and that i need that grand to get out of the country 
but remember -PRON- add desperately -PRON- promise to bring -PRON- back so be just like i be now will -PRON- will be out of here in an hour ross sherill tell -PRON- eagerly 
step inside the projector 
as fraham slowly obey enter the cylindrical cage with step weight by dread gail sherill lay a trembling hand on -PRON- husband arm 
-PRON- dark eye hold fear 
ross -PRON- say afraid of this experiment 
i wish -PRON- would give -PRON- up bother -PRON- now dear please the tense young scientist beg 
-PRON- be turn switch shift control 
the generator around the room break into hum life the great tube silently light to a violet glow transformer spray a crackle brush 
sherill -PRON- hand on the final switch regard the terrified little man inside the projector 
just stand steady fraham -PRON- say 
-PRON- will take only fifteen minute of exposure to the force 
-PRON- fling the svitch 
brilliant white light break from the vertical bar of the projector a blind cascade of radiation that hide from sight the trembling man inside 
the evolution accelerate force be play upon that man body million of time more powerful than such force have ever play upon a human being before 
ross sherill watch tensely -PRON- hand on the switch 
behind -PRON- gail watch too -PRON- slim figure rigid with fear of the unknown 
what be go on inside that glowdng halo 
what tremendous change be take place in fraham as the awful cosmic force fling -PRON- through thousand of year of future development each minute 
-PRON- be ghastly unholy the fearridden girl tell -PRON- this artificial shortcut on the road of slow evolution -PRON- husband be violate the basic law of the universe -PRON- in thus hurl a human be a million year past -PRON- fellow in development 
why have -PRON- ever let -PRON- do -PRON- 
sherill count the minute beneath -PRON- breath 
fourteen fifteen 
-PRON- throw the switch open 
the blind glow of radiation die and -PRON- stare petrify at the man inside the cylindrical cage 
the wizene ratface little criminal have vanish and in -PRON- place stand a man of superhuman terrible aspect 
-PRON- huge form be burst from clothe 
for this man be almost seven foot tall with colossal shoulder taper down into a lean perfect body of tremendous strength 
a body that be as much superior to the ordinary human form as man be to the ape 
but the face 
-PRON- be godlike in terrible beauty the feature perfectly regular the mouth a straight merciless line the eye enormous glowing one through which look a cold vast mind whose shock be feel tangibly 
the head be quite hairless 
-PRON- god cry ross sherill stare in amazement at this superhuman figure 
fraham change ross change -PRON- back cried gail clutch -PRON- husband arm in terror afraid 
too late for that 
fraham or the godlike man who have be fraham be step out of the projector 
-PRON- glowing eye fasten on sherill and the dazed young scientist feel those eye read the depth of -PRON- mind like an open book 
that inhuman gaze swing to pale face and -PRON- flinch in horror from -PRON- hen the transform coldly beautiful face turn back to sherill 
-PRON- speak in an icy level voice 
to think -PRON- be -PRON- a savage semianimal who develop -PRON- 
fraham say ross sherill hoarsely 
-PRON- do change into the kind of man all man will be in a million year 
-PRON- go on with desperate hope 
all right now that see what the course of future evolution will bring forth bring -PRON- back to -PRON- former state 
step back into the projector 
the creature before -PRON- laugh 
a cold terrifying and mirthless laughter 
-PRON- amuse -PRON- -PRON- tell sherill 
do -PRON- think that i would let -PRON- change -PRON- back now into what i be into a dimminde shrivel halfape like -PRON- 
no i stay as i be and with -PRON- brain i can bring all -PRON- witless race under -PRON- rule easily 
ross gail cry desperately to -PRON- husband do -PRON- if -PRON- let -PRON- stay like this 
-PRON- must change back 
ross sherill suddenly produce the pistol in -PRON- pocket and level -PRON- at the godlike heart 
back into the projector fraham or shoot -PRON- cry donot intend to let -PRON- experiment release a superminde monster on the world 
the superman before -PRON- laugh again 
-PRON- think to match will with -PRON- 
throw that weapon out of tha window 
-PRON- glowing eye be rivet on ross as -PRON- utter the command 
as those supernal eye bore into -PRON- soul the young biologist feel -PRON- lose control of -PRON- own body 
-PRON- try to pull the trigger and couldnot 
-PRON- muscle be obey not -PRON- own mind but the hypnotic command of the creature before -PRON- 
resistless -PRON- hand go up and fling the pistol out of the open window 
fraham go on contemptuously in that eerie cold voice 
-PRON- begin to see how helpless -PRON- be to resist -PRON- 
just as helpless will all man be when i appear in -PRON- city and order -PRON- to submit to ray rule 
-PRON- glowing eye flash may have to destroy many of -PRON- before -PRON- learn -PRON- power 
but -PRON- will be easy 
-PRON- mind can devise weapon against which -PRON- race will be powerless to resist 
i will build the first of those weapon now 
as sherill and -PRON- wife watch the superman move swiftly about the laboratory pick up some ebonite rod two copper discs a small piece of bismuth and other odd object 
-PRON- see the transform fraham deftly quickly join these thing together into a tripodlike instrument crown by the two discs 
ross sherill realize in horror that -PRON- be some awful weapon of the future design to be use upon present day humanity 
the lanky young scientist crouch leap for throat 
fraham whirl and the hypnotic a command of those terrible eye freeze sherill halfway across the room 
-PRON- will remain in this room -PRON- two command the superman while i test -PRON- new weapon outside 
i can use -PRON- as subject to test other weapon upon 
without another look at -PRON- -PRON- stride out of the room with -PRON- curious weapon 
look numbly out through tha window into the moonlight -PRON- could see -PRON- huge figure stride up the slope of the hill behind the old country house 
-PRON- see -PRON- stop up there on the crest where -PRON- seem to be set up and adjust the tripodlike thing 
ross sherill throw -PRON- toward the door get the pistol i throw outside -PRON- cry to -PRON- wife 
that monster get to be kill at once or hell destroy the world 
-PRON- reach the door and stop 
-PRON- could go no further -PRON- muscle be obey the hypnotic command of the superhuman fraham and not -PRON- own will 
sherill concentrate strongly but could not get through that door 
neither could gail when -PRON- try 
ross -PRON- canot get out -PRON- sob 
-PRON- get to cry the young scientist wildly 
if -PRON- donot be responsible for the havoc that creature will wreak on earth 
then -PRON- point through the window and cry look -PRON- s try that devilish weapon now 
up there on the crest of the moonlit hill -PRON- could see the huge figure of the superhuman fraham bend over -PRON- tripod instrument 
-PRON- glimpse a swift terrific flash of white fire or force that drive out into the moonlight from the thing 
-PRON- see the monstrous superman straighten and peer into the silver night as though to see the effect of that tremendous bolt as -PRON- strike somewhere far away canot stop -PRON- 
gail be exclaim -PRON- eye wide with daze horror like child against a brain like that unable to oppose -PRON- mind for a minute against -PRON- 
like a bomb explode in -PRON- brain an idea burst blindingly upon ross sherill 
-PRON- canot oppose -PRON- mind now no -PRON- cry but what if i throw -PRON- forward a million year in development with the projector also 
then have a mind as vast and powerful as -PRON- i could fight -PRON- 
-PRON- leap instantly toward the cylindrical cage go to do -PRON- gail 
-PRON- will only take fifteen minute for the force to throw -PRON- ahead and i donot think hell return before then 
gail clung to -PRON- arm crying 
no ross donot -PRON- plead become a monster like -PRON- wonot 
sherill tell -PRON- desperately 
fraham be of a predatory criminal cast of mind and that be why even after -PRON- have develop so tremendously -PRON- still have in mind only the desire to dominate and prey on the world 
but i want only to destroy the nienace of fraham and when do so reenter the projector and -PRON- can use the reverse force to bring -PRON- back 
before the terrified girl could protest further -PRON- have enter the mechanism 
throw the switch gail -PRON- command urgently little time 
the girl hand numbly close the switch 
inside the cage of bar ross sherill be almost blind by the terrific burst of glow force from about -PRON- 
as that awful flood of tingle force saturate every atom in -PRON- -PRON- feel hurl through abyss incredible fathomless and staggering 
-PRON- feel -PRON- mind and body change expand unfold with each pass minute 
vast new vista of thought open out in -PRON- mind thing that have before seem complex and obscure become crystal clear to -PRON- 
-PRON- feel a superhuman enhancement of -PRON- power of reason 
-PRON- know -PRON- could solve problem in a moment that wculd take an ordinary man month or year 
and as -PRON- body change and grow -PRON- feel a boundless physical vigor -PRON- have never feel before 
-PRON- emotion be wither and dwindling and a cold logic be now dominant in -PRON- mind 
-PRON- be become -PRON- know the kind of man all man would become in a million year 
and -PRON- seem to -PRON- now that in change from -PRON- former cramped body and mind -PRON- be step from an animal state into one of full humanity 
the glow of force die about -PRON- as the switch be open and -PRON- could look out now into the laboratory 
before -PRON- stare wildly at -PRON- be a girl 
-PRON- feel a repulsion at sight of -PRON- 
this savage semiape female thing so undeveloped of mind and body have -PRON- really love this 
-PRON- new mind sicken at the thought 
-PRON- be run toward -PRON- cry ross then -PRON- stop and -PRON- see horror and fear deepen in -PRON- eye as -PRON- meet -PRON- own gaze not ross at all -PRON- whisper change like fraham afraid of -PRON- 
-PRON- be shrink back from -PRON- in dread 
but -PRON- pay no attention to -PRON- as -PRON- stride out of the cage 
fraham the other 
the enemy whom -PRON- must destroy 
-PRON- supersensitive ear could already hear fraham come down the hill return to the house 
but -PRON- do not fear the other now -PRON- knev with cold confidence that -PRON- be -PRON- match 
the haggard wildeye girl also hear now and cry a warning 
ross -PRON- s come 
go out and get the pistol if -PRON- can be silent -PRON- order -PRON- 
as -PRON- eye meet -PRON- command gaze -PRON- be mute and stricken 
in -PRON- new mind sherill feel only contempt for -PRON- ignorant babbling 
as though -PRON- need a primitive toy like that pistol fraham step into the door a huge figure as tall and superhuman as -PRON- 
and glove eye see -PRON- and realize in an instant what have happen 
-PRON- -PRON- have change too -PRON- cry 
well well see who s master -PRON- swing up the deadly tripodal weapon -PRON- carry 
the woman scream 
drop that weapon ross order calmly eye be meet glow gaze beat against glow gaze a contest of two supermind more deadly than the clash of sword 
fraham be still raise -PRON- weapon but more slowly now 
slow and slow -PRON- hand move as upon -PRON- brain beat the superhypnotic command to desist 
then hand stop stiffly hold the tripod 
-PRON- be put every bit of -PRON- own brain colossal power into the hypnotic gaze with which -PRON- be battle the commanding eye of the transformed ross sherill 
the two superman stand silent in the room that be utterly still except for the spasmodic sob of the crouch girl 
-PRON- be engage in a terrific battle of mind such as earth have never hold before 
then almost imperceptibly the terrible eye of fraham waver the mere trifle 
-PRON- mind before -PRON- have be project a million year ahead in development have be inferior to the scientist 
and now that development also have be jump forward ten thousand century -PRON- mind be still inferior be slowly break down before the scientist will 
slowly the hand of fraham lower 
in -PRON- eye be an awful agony of sear hate and fury 
yet -PRON- could not keep -PRON- mental defense from crumble before the other assault 
drop the weapon repeat ross sherill coldly -PRON- godlike face unchanged in calm finger relax and the diabolical tripodweapon rattle to the floor 
step into the projector order the transformed scientist -PRON- gaze never flicker 
as -PRON- understand the meaning of that command eye become terrible 
hellfire of furious revolt a flamed in -PRON- a surge of terrific mental resistance 
but command gaze hold steady beat the other down again with hypnotic command 
a hoarse strangle sound bursting from -PRON- lip the huge figure of fraham move stiffly across the laboratory and into the tall cage of the projector 
sherill still hold the other with -PRON- eye follow 
-PRON- hand find the switch of the evolution reverse force and snap -PRON- shut 
blue radiation burgeon from the bar wrap great form in a shroud of azure light 
ross sherill watch immobile as the projector hum for minute after minute 
the crouch girl be stare stunned at the cold awesome beauty of -PRON- inhuman face 
then sherill fling open the switch 
the blue force cease 
and there in the projector stand fraham not the transformed mighty superman but the wizened ratface little criminal 
-PRON- stagger out dazedly wildly 
i -PRON- falter and sink into a dead faint on the floor 
sherill feel a touch on -PRON- sleeve 
-PRON- be the girl that savage atavistic female thing look up into -PRON- face 
ross -PRON- conquer -PRON- -PRON- bring -PRON- back and keep -PRON- from destroy the world -PRON- cry 
now enter the projector -PRON- 
let -PRON- bring -PRON- back to the man -PRON- be -PRON- husband 
bring -PRON- back 
drag -PRON- back across a million year of development to become a semiape like -PRON- to become again cramp of mind and body an unclean primitive animal 
no every thought in brain revolt at the idea 
-PRON- wouldnot give up this tremendous power of brain and body this supermanhood -PRON- would attain 
-PRON- couldnot 
the girl seem to read -PRON- thought 
-PRON- promise ross -PRON- plead 
-PRON- shake -PRON- off coldly 
what have -PRON- to do with this savage creature 
outside lie a world that only -PRON- great brain could put in order a world wait for -PRON- to be -PRON- master here be much for -PRON- to do in that world a race to be force into new clean way of live war and greed and trickery to be stamp out 
-PRON- could do all that ross 
somehow that cry of heartbreak make -PRON- stop at the door 
something in -PRON- inmost fiber something still strangely bind to this savage creature be stop and hold by -PRON- 
ross -PRON- gail gail -PRON- be cry to -PRON- 
-PRON- must enter the projector for -PRON- 
-PRON- relentlessly clear mind tell -PRON- that this woman be seek to drag -PRON- back into a state of savagery like -PRON- own to take away forever -PRON- wonderful mind and body 
yet something deep within -PRON- something not to be control even by all -PRON- tremendous mental power make -PRON- move slow step by step toward the cylindrical cage 
at -PRON- very edge -PRON- hesitate feel strong than ever that sick repulsion at the thought of return to a halfanimal state 
please ross 
-PRON- step very slowly inside the cage of bar 
with a choke sob the girl throw shut the switch 
when the blue reversing force stop -PRON- be ross sherill not the transformed godlike figure of before but again the lanky young scientist who step out of the projector 
-PRON- look bewilderedly from the unconscious figure of fraham on the floor to the girl who be run madly toward -PRON- 
ross -PRON- have come back -PRON- cry face be aghast 
why i remember now i didnot want to come back to -PRON- gail -PRON- say 
-PRON- look like an animal to -PRON- look repulsive apelike -PRON- hold -PRON- tight 
god what an awful thing that projector almost release on the world -PRON- whisper go to destroy -PRON- and never build another 
whatever power have decree the slow rate of human evolution know better than -PRON- man know that if -PRON- try to go too fast upon that evolutionary road -PRON- would only destroy -PRON- of an exciting sensational drama of the little world that no man can see 
a complete novelette by author of around the universe trap in eternity etc i the flower box i the fourth sector of the north atlantic airway the westbound night plane with mail and fifty passenger be in trouble 
a fuel leak have be discover drop down on pontoon four the chief pilot say delay -PRON- much 
queer the radio man say canot get a word out of somer and alden 
pontoon lie glisten in the moonlight 
a little emergency landing field fifty by a hundred and fifty foot 
a metal raft raise on -PRON- pontoon alone here in the atlantic 
the moonlight gleam on -PRON- flat metal expanse 
at one end be a small metal shed the supply house 
at the other close against the lowrailed side of the raft stand the little cottage where the pontoonkeeper live 
there be two of -PRON- two young american roy somer and george alden 
the cottage be a singlestory structure entirely of metal silverglistene alumite 
this night of june 20th be calm 
the sea be placid 
the officer and passenger of the distressed airliner gaze down at the somnolent empty pontoon 
-PRON- beacon light be burn 
the window of the little cottage glow with yellow illumination from within 
but where be roy somer and george alden 
-PRON- should have answer the radio call 
very queer the radio man say 
there ought to be more than somer and alden here 
only an hour ago i have a message from the eastbound inside a tiny flower box somer and plane 
-PRON- stop here 
put off two passenger relative of alden 
an hour ago nothing have be wrong here 
the flyer have bring old professor alden and -PRON- daughter anne from new york 
-PRON- be george father and sister who be to spend a few day on the pontoon visit -PRON- 
and the chief pilot of that other plane have report something else 
be -PRON- a reptile from the prehistoric age a serpent hundred of foot long 
shortly after leave the pontoon a passenger be find to be miss one jose toro who have come aboard at new york 
-PRON- be book through to london but evidently -PRON- have leave the ship at the pontoon 
very strange 
five people unaccounted for 
the pilot search the pontoon 
-PRON- get -PRON- fuel from the storehouse 
there be no sign of disorder 
nothing wrong 
-PRON- search the little metal cottage 
-PRON- door have a smash lock 
nothing else be wrong 
the few small interior room show no sign of violence 
the luggage of professor alden and -PRON- daughter stand as mute evidence that the guest have arrive 
the officer of the mail plane report the condition of pontoon by radio to new york and to london and in ten minute -PRON- depart 
perilous manhunt 
when -PRON- be go pontoon still lay silent and deserted 
drama have be here tragedy doubtless but -PRON- be over now 
but be -PRON- 
on the floor of the kitchen under the low southern window stand a little flower box 
-PRON- be a box only a foot wide two foot long and hardly six inch deep 
soil be in -PRON- 
a geranium flower at -PRON- center 
-PRON- seem to have be neglect 
be only recently water 
nothing of tragedy and drama go on here now 
no sign of life here on this deserted metal raft 
here in the flower box a little sign of life show an ant in one corner wander disconsolately over the dirt look for food 
but what of that 
anyone here now stare at the little flower box would have conclude that there be nothing to see 
fatuous reasoning 
who ever think of the amazing realm of smallness always under -PRON- eye teem always with drama and tragedy 
this little flower box for instance hour and a half before the distressed westbound flyer land at pontoon and find -PRON- desert roy somer sit with george alden in the kitchen of -PRON- metal house 
alden have just come from -PRON- radio instrument in the adjoin room 
the eastbound plane be land here alden say 
roy what do -PRON- think father and anne come to spend a day or two 
-PRON- face be flush -PRON- dark eye sparkle 
the big blondhaired somer be excite 
good lord what news

anne begin cook supper 
the professor and -PRON- son cross the raft to inspect the supply house 
somer join -PRON- 
but after a minute or two -PRON- want to be back with anne 
-PRON- leave -PRON- unceremoniously recrosse the metal field in the moonlight and approach the little metal cottage 
the door be closed 
strange 
-PRON- have leave -PRON- open just a few moment before 
then -PRON- be stricken by the sound of a voice 
not voice 
and i be here 
i want to be with -PRON- 
the voice of jose toro 
somer recognize -PRON- suave spanish accent 
-PRON- have meet this toro 
a young latin american chemist who in new york be professor assistait

the voice be muffle by the closed metal door but still -PRON- be plainly audible 
jose the girl obviously be startle 
jose let -PRON- go 
anne be almost scream with terror 
the house have several window all of which be open 
somer leap for one of -PRON- 
the heavy metal hurricane blind come snap down in -PRON- face 
and all the other slide close simultaneously all of -PRON- electrically operate from a switch inside the house 
and there be muffle voice stop fight -PRON- little fool 
dio 
i do not want to hurt -PRON- back at the door somer frantically pound lunge against -PRON- but -PRON- resist all -PRON- effort 
and the metal window blind vere the same 
the little house be impregnable 
mingle with scream of protest again come voice adventure for -PRON- and -PRON- eh ninta 
no one can catch -PRON- now to the rage somer the voice seem to have a new quality 
soft 
dimmer 
behind somer young alden and the professor come dash up breathless 
that fellow toro somer gasp 
here inside here with anne the voice inside be steadily grow fainter 
get a crowbar george break the door -PRON- seem an eternity while -PRON- wait and somer rage and plunge at the resist door 
then within a minute young alden come rush back with the heavy iron bar 
the voice inside be very much dimmer now queerly far away in sound 
but -PRON- could not escape from the seal metal house 
somer think that triumphantly as -PRON- seize the crowbar and bash in the door lock with a single blow 
-PRON- rush inside 
-PRON- seem to somer that just then -PRON- hear faint terrify cry 
but the place be empty 
somer dash through the room 
anne -PRON- call where be -PRON- 
-PRON- dash from one little room to the other 
search frantically the seal house be empty 
i the kitchen the trembling professor alden straighten from the floor

-PRON- be open 
somer see row of tiny metal vial some red some white 
-PRON- have steal some of -PRON- drug -PRON- great discovery the professor say somer and alden stand gasping listening 
amazing diabolical plot of this jose toro 
amazing thing of science this which now the professor be so vehemently tell 
as the professor assistant toro have help for the past two year in the old man chemical research 
revolutionary research successfully end with an amazing discovery 
a drug to shrink every tiny atom of the human body cell 
to reduce in size every atom of any live organism 
uniform dwindling so that the shape the identity of the complex cell agglomeration remain unchangedand only the bulk be alter 
the professor gasp out -PRON- astounding secret as with trembling finger -PRON- search -PRON- satchel of vial 
a drug for reduce the mass of a live organism 
and a drug which be -PRON- opposite to increase the mass increase the bulk 
incredible thing 
somer stand confused 
incredible 
yet -PRON- explain this disappearance of anne and toro 
incredible fantasy 
yet here -PRON- be 
somer mind try to encompass -PRON- 
anne and the villainous toro have be here but now -PRON- be go 
but -PRON- be not go 
professor alden be say right here of course 
go from -PRON- in size but right here somewhere have to take the drug 
make -PRON- small find -PRON- somewhere here the professor hand shake as -PRON- grip -PRON- little vial roy george that s what anne and i come to tell -PRON- 
i think -PRON- may make an experiment here never yet try this with a human 
only with insect -PRON- hold one of the red and one of the white vial 
the red for dwindle 
-PRON- must hurry be go so far into smallness -PRON- suddenly check -PRON- 
somer see an expression of horror sweep -PRON- face 
on the floor there be a sound of scratching 
the rasp and scuttling of insect foot unnaturally loud 
for an instant the three man stand chill with horror 
-PRON- see the thing now an oblong black thing down on the floor of the room over by the window 
the bright light from the overhead electric bulb illumine -PRON- clearly 
an ant six inch ong 
-PRON- stand belligerent on -PRON- bent leg 
the professor voice break the tense silence 
-PRON- toro must have drop a pellet of the enlarge drug 
this ant licking at -PRON- donot -PRON- realize 
-PRON- seem to somer that -PRON- heart stop beat 
the ant be visibly enlarge swifter always as though every moment -PRON- rate of growth be accelerate 
-PRON- multiple eye glare 
-PRON- rear erect 
roy 
kill -PRON- 
the old professor be terrify into a panic of confusion 
the thing elude -PRON- 
long glisten black shape pinch in the middle like an hourglass 
-PRON- disappear through the break outer door out to the moonlit expanse of the pontoon 
roy -PRON- god roy george 
somer and young alden leap past the whiteface old man 
at the outer doorway all three paused 
the professor gasp get to kill -PRON- let -PRON- swim away escape -PRON- will devastate the vorld 
out in the moonlight near the center of the glisten metal landing field the hideous thing stand poise 
only an ant somer stand with cold horror clutch at -PRON- heart 
the damnable thing be grow large 
what would -PRON- size in an hour be 
swim the ocean reach shore 
a monster with no limit to -PRON- growth perhaps 
again the ant rear -PRON- erect 
-PRON- eye glow phosphorescent in the moonlight 
and then -PRON- drop horizontally 
belligerent with the realization of -PRON- size -PRON- come scuttle forward 
the fight with the ant somer the brief terrify combat be a fantasy of horror 
-PRON- be aware of the hideous thing advance 
enormous insect now 
-PRON- advance lust to seize these upright enemy who stand regard -PRON- 
somer hear the professor give a terrified cry and dart sideward 
but young alden jump forward 
the ant rear to meet -PRON- 
-PRON- grapple and alden topple backward fall with the ant down upon -PRON- 
somer reach for the heavy iron crowbar wdth which -PRON- have bash in the cottage door 
-PRON- seize -PRON- leap forward just as young alden fall 
and somer swing the iron bar 
-PRON- strike the huge blackshelled body 
there vas a sickening mashing crack a noisome stench of sticky white ooze 
the back of the giant ant be break -PRON- pinched middle sag -PRON- whole mangled length writhe 
with -PRON- sense reel somer stoop and jerk the fall young alden away 
the insect lie writhe as tnough in a death agony 
young alden have roll away and be climb to -PRON- foot 
somer have drop the iron bar 
-PRON- turn and pick -PRON- up to strike again 
too late 
amazing strength of this ant strong living thing of -PRON- size in all the vorld 
-PRON- rear -PRON- mash and mangle body 
-PRON- seem gigantically to leap with -PRON- broken leg 
somer head reel -PRON- be barely aware of what be happen 
-PRON- see professor alden stand nearby the huge mangle insect leap upon the old man seize -PRON- bear -PRON- away 
somer and young alden all at once find -PRON- futilely despairingly in pursuit 
the giant ant hold the old man bodys aloft and with -PRON- scuttle and lurch across the moonlit metal surface 
the professor scream a brief scream of agony 
somer fling the bar 
-PRON- strike the ant mash -PRON- again 
doubtless now the thing be die or dead 
but the momentum of -PRON- huge body and the blow of the bar slide -PRON- forward 
the low guard rail of the pontoon be near at hand 
the noisome gigantic mass of shell five hundred foot above somer heave the boulder down full at head and puip still grip -PRON- victim slid and crash through the guard rail vanish over the edge 
there be a drop of thirty foot to the placid moonlit sea 
a silent interval of horror then one final splash 
tough george 
somer murmur do for forget anne get to do something 
-PRON- turn and run 
to somer come the irrational thought that now in the kitchen -PRON- would seize this damnable jose toro 
but sight of the empty room bring somer to -PRON- sense 
how could -PRON- seize toro and rescue anne 
yet -PRON- be here somewhere frantically -PRON- and alden poked about the little room 
but there be nothing to see and only silence respond to -PRON- frantic call 
silence and the tramp of -PRON- own footstep the grind as -PRON- shift chair and table and the faint lap of the calm ocean against the wall of the pontoon 
a sudden thought strike somer which turn -PRON- cold with horror 
-PRON- grip -PRON- companion 
-PRON- god george -PRON- canot do this trample -PRON- if -PRON- be here small under -PRON- foot -PRON- stand transfix almost afraid to move 
somer try to reason what must have happen 
this jose toro with -PRON- unwelcome attention to anne toro have know professor secret of the drug 
toro have leave the plane hide -PRON- on the pontoon 
watch -PRON- chance -PRON- have get into the house steal the drug and the girl take -PRON- into the realm of smallness 
but where be -PRON- now 
what part of the room 
alden be tremblingly open the satchel of drug 
two vial miss -PRON- look like that -PRON- say 
these other red and vhite father say the red one for smallness didnot -PRON- 
somer remember -PRON- 
each seize two of the vial 
alden lock the satchel again 
somer open -PRON- small red bottle 
a score of tiny red pellet be inside 
but how many be -PRON- to take hey could only guess 
one perhaps for normal shrinkage 
-PRON- decide to take only one each at first 
and add other later 
but as -PRON- become small in which part of the kitchen would -PRON- search 
somer mind try to envisage the come experience and -PRON- set -PRON- gasping 
why to a human tiny in size this kitchen would be expand into a gigantic realm 
one may run across the floor and be minute reach the opposite wall 
minute if one be small enough -PRON- may be a day journey 
a vast realm of smallness here with toro and anne wander in -PRON- 
then somer think of something else 
toro must have drop a pellet of the enlarge drug 
that ant have eat some of -PRON- 
the ant what be an ant do in this metal kitchen on the metal pontoon in the middle of the atlantic 
the little flower box 
somer cry know where -PRON- may have go alden knelt with -PRON- on the floor beside the flower box the overhead light shine strong upon -PRON- 
look roy 
look 
alden murmur 
amazing sight 
down there on the caked dirt half hide by the tiny fuzz of growth two little figure be plainly visible 
toro and anne 
-PRON- be carry -PRON- inert body in -PRON- arm 
tiny human figure 
a quarter of an inch high no more 
toro carry anne 
struggle laboriously through the growth of grass blade 
dwindle figure 
already -PRON- be small than a moment before 
the grass far tall than head almost hide -PRON- 
a vague instinct make somer reach down 
but -PRON- check -PRON- powerless 
how could -PRON- seize that tiny human form no big than an ant 
-PRON- descend hand suddenly seem monstrous -PRON- thumb and forefinger be incapable of grasp the minute figure 
breathlessly -PRON- and alden crouch stare down thread advance have move the grass blade but now -PRON- be too small for that 
-PRON- stagger with body move between the blade without touch -PRON- 
be anne dead 
somer could not think so for the fleeing toro then would have abandon -PRON- 
-PRON- have faint probably 
then -PRON- know that anne be not dead 
the drug be effective on live organism only and body now be dwindle equally with -PRON- captor 
toro come out of the grass 
so small a eighth of an inch high 
certainly no more than that 
and -PRON- seem that as somer bend lower to look toro be gaze up with a wave arm in gesture of defiance 
almost invisible now 
somer blink 
-PRON- hear alden mutter go 
no 
still there 
somer be almost sure -PRON- see the tiny moving speck which be toro and the pinpoint dot of bluewhite dress 
there be a tiny ridged crack in the caked dirt small than one would make with the scratch of a fingernail 
-PRON- seem that the move speck have drop into -PRON- vanish 
somer breathe again 
and then -PRON- tense 
george -PRON- murmur give -PRON- a match donot dare look away 
i donot dare 
somer continue to stare at the spot 
-PRON- grope hand take the match from alden 
then -PRON- bend low and very carefully stick the match upright into the dirt a half or threequarter of an inch from where anne have disappear 
carefully -PRON- memorize the direction 
two pellet 
would that dwindle -PRON- quickly enough 
-PRON- stand with alden both of -PRON- pale and tense 
-PRON- hold the pellet ready 
somer nod to alden and simultaneously -PRON- swallow the drug 
somer instinctively close -PRON- eye 
-PRON- be conscious of an instant sweetish queerly aromatic taste in -PRON- mouth 
-PRON- sense reel with a dizzying swoop 
descent into smallness omer open -PRON- eye 
the sense of swoop dizziness persist for a moment and then clarify into a semblance of normality 
-PRON- find alden cling to -PRON- 
-PRON- all right roy 
yes 
only i feel a queer tingle sensation 
-PRON- be seat together on the kitchen floor with upraised knee and foot draw close to -PRON- body 
the little flower box be in front of -PRON- 
to one side be the leg of the kitchen table with -PRON- level top above -PRON- head 
suddenly -PRON- be conscious that the whole scene be in motion 
the wall the ceiling everything in the kitchen seem to be slowly shift 
a queer steady crawling change 
slow at first like the hand of a clock whose movement be barely perceptible 
but the change be obvious 
ever5tthe be expand 
and the movement be not only visual 
-PRON- could feel -PRON- now 
the floor be crawl outward under -PRON- 
-PRON- draw -PRON- foot out so that -PRON- knee shift down with tiny jerk 
-PRON- have to hitch -PRON- into new position to maintain balance 
amazing but after a moment -PRON- find the physical strangeness pass 
-PRON- stand up cling together with the floor shift under -PRON- foot pull -PRON- foot apart so that every moment -PRON- have to take a step inward 
and the movement be accelerate 
a weird change be take place 
the table leg be huge 
the table top be high than -PRON- head 
the flower box seem to have double -PRON- size and -PRON- be no longer near -PRON- 
six foot away now and shift crawling steadily further into the expand distance 
somer laugh grimly 
get to keep -PRON- wit not get rattle 
yes 
i think -PRON- would better go over there 
-PRON- start walk 
the sensation be strange but in a moment -PRON- get use to -PRON- 
six foot to the flower box 
-PRON- take a few step 
but the box be draw away 
-PRON- run 
the wall of the box be at -PRON- shoulder when -PRON- reach -PRON- 
a shoulderhigh green fence 
-PRON- scramble up over -PRON- tumble in a heap onto the dirt 
somer see some six foot away a round white pole stick up waisthigh 
the match another few foot beyond -PRON- would be the place where anne have go go there yet 
somer warn too big 
may trample -PRON- 
for a moment -PRON- stand with the waisthigh grass blade expand around -PRON- 
from the edge of the box there be a drop of thirty or forty foot 
the kitchen tabletop be a monstrous plateau a quarter of a mile away and high in the sky 
sky 
no the wide expanse of ceiling be still visible as a blur above -PRON- an expand fade blur 
the electric light bulb up there be a distant spot of white glare 
how long -PRON- stand engrossed somer do not realize 
then -PRON- swing about -PRON- heart pound with alarm 
the white matchstick be a great pole eighteen or twenty foot high 
and -PRON- be thirty or forty foot away 
beyond -PRON- very distant over the huge grass frond a great tower shape be visible 
somer move to where between the twentyfoot leave of the grass -PRON- would see that tower shape clearly 
a crooked pillar of browngreen tower up hundred of foot to a blur mass of red 
the geranium 
a lake of muddy water be at -PRON- bottom 
alden too be stare in amazement 
and suddenly -PRON- be grip somer 
thing move 
-PRON- god -PRON- see -PRON- 
the world of the flower box 
steadily with a constant acceleration -PRON- be open up 
and there be thing alive here of course 
with a tremble hand alden be point at the expand tower of the geraniumstem 
thing alive on -PRON- 
-PRON- be too far away now to be distinguish clearly 
but undoubtedly there be move live being 
a new world here 
and in -PRON- time be lose size be lose 
size and distance always change 
everything grow swiftly gigantic and move away into newly create realm of distance 
then suddenly somer become aware of the matchstick again 
-PRON- be a gleam white column now 
-PRON- tower two hundred foot into the bluewhite blur of sky 
and -PRON- be at least four hundred foot away over the tumbled expanse of dirt and rock somer go cold 
the column be recede so fast 
could -PRON- reach -PRON- 
somer run with -PRON- companion flounder after -PRON- 
four hundred foot 
-PRON- know -PRON- have run that far but still the gigantic white column loom ahead 
then pant almost wind -PRON- reach -PRON- run around -PRON- huge curve side 
this way somer pant 
toward the geranium 
the geranium plant be only a blur in the distance with a gleam radiance shine upon the watery expanse at -PRON- base 
somer head toward -PRON- 
another desperate run 
amazing realm of smallness mile of rocky cragstrewn waste ridge and pit little gully opening 
-PRON- leap over -PRON- 
-PRON- stumble fall pick -PRON- up and run on 
roy wait i canot all out of breath 
somer stop 
despair be in -PRON- heart 
-PRON- have wait too long 
-PRON- could never reach that crack 
alden come pant up 
take -PRON- easy get to keep together get to reach that crack 
alden smile grimly 
if be too small -PRON- can get large -PRON- know 
no need of all this run -PRON- add 
both realize that the tumbled area of rocky distance have lose -PRON- movement 
the drug action have wear off 
-PRON- peer into the half light 
rock be strew here now 
gigantic green stalk rise into the sky behind -PRON- the grass blade 
memory come to somer 
this be the place where toro have stand carry anne roy look off there 
somer follow the gesture 
a mile or two away the rocky ground suddenly burst upward 
an earthquake a monstrous cataclysm 
-PRON- shake -PRON- with the rock shudder under -PRON- foot 
a distant upheaval 
the ground rise as though by a vast explosion 
yet -PRON- be a slow upheaval 
a push upward 
a mountain of earth rise a hundred or two hundred foot into the air and fall back into a huge tumble litter of broken rock 
the roar of -PRON- come echo from the distance a queer crashing roar blur and muffled 
-PRON- stand gaze transfix 
the earth have be push upward by a monster come up from underground 
a mile or two away but still -PRON- could see the gigantic shape 
be -PRON- a reptile from the prehistoric age a monstrous serpent hundred of foot long 
-PRON- could see -PRON- slither twist coil -PRON- then lengthen out move away until in a moment -PRON- have vanish 
somer turn to -PRON- companion 
-PRON- try to laugh 
the tension of -PRON- taut nerve make -PRON- feel suddenly hysterical 
george do -PRON- know what that vas 
-PRON- god no worm wriggle up through the loose dirt 
a worm in the flover box 
astonishing aspect of size 
size to govern one viewpoint of everything that monster only a miserable little worm 
why here in the vial of drug in -PRON- pocket be -PRON- ability to get large again to change that distant fearsome monster back into a harmless wriggling little worm 
somer feel into -PRON- pocket to make sure that the vial be safe 
-PRON- recall the professor brief word concern -PRON- drug an aura which -PRON- fling about the living organism -PRON- be alter an aura like a magnetic field so that -PRON- clothing and the small article in -PRON- pocket be within -PRON- influence 
yes the vial be sate 
-PRON- laugh grimly sure get to keep -PRON- wit george 
this can be handle better than be do -PRON- 
-PRON- be plan to take some of the enlarge drug and then -PRON- see what be obviously the crack into vhich anne and toro have vanish 
-PRON- show now as a yawning shadow across the landscape about a quarter of a mile away 
come on somer say 
easy to walk there than to take any more of the drug 
-PRON- start 
somer be ponder what procedure toro may have follow 
one dose of the drug would have wear off now 
have toro take more hey come to the crack 
stand awed 
-PRON- be a long break gully 
a great ridge of upflung earth be here on the plateau of -PRON- upper brink 
-PRON- stand on the tumble summit gaze down 
if -PRON- go down there somer say dubiously suppose -PRON- ought to climb down 
the descent do not take -PRON- long 
-PRON- stand presently on the guliy floor with the broken wall tower above -PRON- 
the twilight be deep here 
the sky be a ribbon of greyblue haze 
silent rocky desolation 
-PRON- low voice echo with a queer muffled quality 
but where have -PRON- go 
alden be say 
roy how can -PRON- ever find -PRON- 
there be plenty of rocky recess here where toro may be hide 
somer take a step then check -PRON- shudder 
anne may be here at -PRON- foot tiny as an ant 
-PRON- gaze sweep the stonelittere gully floor 
george what s that over there -PRON- say abruptly 
a little crumpled white thing ten or fifteen foot away 
-PRON- go and pick -PRON- up 
-PRON- be a small square of white linen smell faintly of perfume 
in -PRON- corner be a small embroidered handkerchief 
have -PRON- drop -PRON- here by accident or be -PRON- a trail which -PRON- purposely have leave for -PRON- to follow 
-PRON- be here somer say evident 
i believe anne drop -PRON- purposely 
-PRON- may have mark this spot here for -PRON- to show that this be where -PRON- take the second dose of the drug 
-PRON- consult 
then each take a second red pellet 
the sensation be not so confusing this time 
crawl shifting of the enlarge landscape 
the handkerchief grow monstrous 
a great billow mass of white fabric 
presently -PRON- be high than -PRON- head 
the strand be like plait rope 
the billow fold be ten foot high 
then twenty foot 
george 
look here 
alden be stoop 
on the shifting ground which every moment be grow rougher more broken there lie a bent black wire 
-PRON- be several foot long and rapidly enlarge 
one of hairpin 
no mistake -PRON- 
the trail into smallness 
brave little anne -PRON- have recover from unconsciousness 
-PRON- be alert now leave a trail for -PRON- to follow 
and the deduction of another fact be easy 
this monstrous hairpin in another moment -PRON- be long than somer body still be far small than normal compare to the gigantic crumple mass of the handkerchief 
anne and toro have dwindle here 
-PRON- have take the second dose of the drug 
and -PRON- be not move very far in space only in size 
-PRON- must keep -PRON- here somer say until this dose be wear off 
i doubt if -PRON- would take a third one 
again -PRON- envision the enormity of smallness 
this be only two pellet 
with other one may go down and down into infinity 
every tiny widening crack here at -PRON- foot hold new gigantic realm if one be small enough to penetrate -PRON- 
every tiny grain of rock in this vast valley hold a new universe of smallness 
at last the drug again wear off 
somer and alden stand regard a great tumbled white hill 
a thing indescribable 
billow fold of shaggy white ropestrand weave into a titanic fabric 
-PRON- stand pile into a huge mass fifty foot or so in height with a spread of an acre or more 
a score of entrance to the dark recess under -PRON- be near at hand 
cavemouth opening and in one place a yawn oval ten foot high 
somer and alden stand peer into the inner darkness 
be the trail lose 
there have be no other sign from anne 
be -PRON- and toro motionless now 
hide somewhere here wonder somer say just wonder that cavern in there from the yawn opening ahead there come a muffled scream 
a cry of protest 
terror 
defiance voice 
with alden after -PRON- somer dash forward plunge into the blackness of the cavern 
combat of size i have seem dark under the vast billowy fold of the handkerchief 
but when -PRON- get inside somer be at once aware of light 
a reflect sheen from the fabric -PRON- and a dim effulgence from the rock 
-PRON- have notice -PRON- outside in the gully a while ago a glowing dim phosphorescence 
swiftly -PRON- and alden dash forward -PRON- eye rapidly become accustomed to the soft light 
the scream be not repeat 
quiet 
somer murmur 
get to locate -PRON- 
-PRON- have stop and stand clutch alden 
-PRON- listen peer 
a glowing labyrinth here 
round shelflike recess in a dozen place of the cavern wall 
and all of -PRON- plait rope strand so coarse a fabric that -PRON- could have climb -PRON- rounded slope 
no sound 
eerie phosphorescent darkness 
dio 
give -PRON- that voice 
the sound of a scuffle 
and then -PRON- see toro and anne 
two figure seemingly of normal height 
-PRON- be stand about fifty foot away on a shelflike recess of the fabric wall some fifteen foot above the rock 
toro in white shirt and dark trouser anne in -PRON- paleblue dress 
both mudstaine with clothe tear by the journey 
-PRON- stand on the ledge struggle the man grip -PRON- cuff -PRON- 
dio 
give -PRON- that wonot kill -PRON- if -PRON- like i wonot go any further -PRON- have not yet see -PRON- pursuer 
anne quite evidently have seize a vial of the drug 
-PRON- be try to snatch -PRON- from -PRON- 
the realization come to somer as -PRON- and alden dash forward 
-PRON- be aware that up there on the ledge anne have jerk loose -PRON- arm and fling something away 
the vial of diminish drug 
-PRON- hurtle through the air and fall to the rocky floor 
toro shout an oath 
and then -PRON- see -PRON- oncoming enemy 
somer already have reach the slope which lead to the ledge 
-PRON- leap upon the rough fabric climb -PRON- 
toro seem stricken with astonishment 
-PRON- stand defiant thin dark face livid with rage 
-PRON- hand dart into -PRON- trouser pocket 
the vial of the enlarge drug 
fiendish triumph distort -PRON- face as -PRON- swallow a pellet 
and abruptly somer see that -PRON- be grove 
a slim latin american 
but already -PRON- be six foot tall 
alden be shout after -PRON- 
kill -PRON- come with -PRON- let -PRON- escape with that drug in that second reason come to the stricken somer 
-PRON- fumble in -PRON- pocket 
the vial of enlarge drug 
take -PRON- quickly 
match this fellow in -PRON- growth 
and -PRON- swing and shout at alden -PRON- stay here take care of anne no both of -PRON- get large not so dangerous but keep away from -PRON- fight -PRON- 
somer cram two pellet into bis mouth 
a sevenfoot toro leer with the triumph of -PRON- grow bulk stand up there now 
then -PRON- turn jump backward down another slope and vanish 
somer head have reel from the drug but almost at once the feeling pass 
-PRON- be aware that the eerie phosphorescent scene be shrink 
the fabric of ceiling be come down the wall close in 
these close wall -PRON- startle somer into a panic of confusion 
-PRON- stand tense cling to the slope of the fabric 
but -PRON- surface be smooth the space between the ropestrand be close on -PRON- finger 
-PRON- could feel the surface bend under -PRON- weight 
and suddenly -PRON- slip save -PRON- from fall by a backward leap 
-PRON- have think -PRON- be a drop of nearly ten foot but -PRON- seem only two or three 
-PRON- get -PRON- balance stand waver 
on the dwindling rockground across the cavern lie anne with -PRON- brother hold -PRON- 
dwindle figure already -PRON- be no longer than somer arm be a blur of movement as toro make a rush through a narrowing sidepassage 
somer scramble after -PRON- 
the shrink fabric wail scrape -PRON- as -PRON- wedge through 
pant -PRON- get outside turn and behold the small tunnelway through which -PRON- have emerge 
-PRON- be hardly big enough for -PRON- hand 
dio 
get -PRON- now 
-PRON- swing around as the figure of toro leap upon -PRON- 
-PRON- grapple 
somer mind be alert 
above everything -PRON- know -PRON- must keep -PRON- wit 
the shock of weight make -PRON- stagger backvard purposely -PRON- go limp sagged and fall pull -PRON- adversary down upon -PRON- 
and then with a sudden lunge twist and bring -PRON- uppermost 
-PRON- find toro perhaps a foot large than -PRON- 
strong undoubtedly 
but both quite evidently have take two of the pellet 
-PRON- seem that there be no relative change in size 
-PRON- and somer be enlarge with equal rapidity 
somer find -PRON- straddle chest 
the fellow be lunge squirm flailing with -PRON- fist 
around -PRON- somer be aware of the dizzying swoop scene 
all shrink 
rocky wall of the valley lower and closing 
and almost at -PRON- side be a crumple white handkerchief 
-PRON- be grip throat and toro with -PRON- breath shut off be choke -PRON- eye bulge 
but tire sight of the shrink handkerchief set somer shudder 
-PRON- seem with that instant glance that -PRON- see the tiny figure of alden carry anne try to run 
realization sweep somer 
at any instant -PRON- leg or the flailing leg of the prostrate toro may mangle those tiny running figure 
-PRON- cast toro off 
-PRON- leap erect 
stoop -PRON- snatch toro sideward 
barely in time 
-PRON- seem that the handkerchief be almost under somer foot 
the double dosage of the drug have confuse somer so that -PRON- scarcely think of combat with -PRON- human enemy 
but toro have lunge to -PRON- foot 
-PRON- stand pant and then -PRON- jump again upon somer 
-PRON- wrestle fight with wild scrambling blow 
somer feel the thud of fist upon -PRON- head face be close as -PRON- pant can conquer the world with these drug 
i drop some of -PRON- but i have plenty leave -PRON- have to do for -PRON- first somer retort 
but -PRON- adversary be strong 
-PRON- be bend somer backward now -PRON- weight press -PRON- dark saturnine face leer with triumph 
somer feel -PRON- back against a rocky wall 
incredible for beyond shoulder there be another wall advance 
and toro see the danger 
-PRON- mumble with startled horror 
-PRON- grip loosen -PRON- jerk away 
somer free recover -PRON- balance 
god 
these close wall 
this be no valley in whicn -PRON- be fight 
no more than a narrow rocky trench a few foot wide and shoulderhigh 
horrified realization sweep somer 
in another moment -PRON- gigantic bulk would be mangle here between these rocky side 
-PRON- see toro make a leap and scramble upward 
the ditchwall vere press but the upper surface have come down to somer waist 
-PRON- jump draw -PRON- up and roll out 
-PRON- seem that the slit of rock be close like a reptile mouth try to seize -PRON- emerge leg 
the upper surface familiar undulate dirt and rocky terrain lie spread in the distance 
as somer stagger erect dizzy with the dwindle scene again the murderous toro come at -PRON- under the giant fold of the handkerchief anne and -PRON- brother see the enlarge form of toro rush away and the gigantic somer after -PRON- 
alden be aware of the danger 
-PRON- lift anne 
can -PRON- walk 
i guess so well now 
get to get outside get away be too large might trample -PRON- 
an amazing scene encounter -PRON- as -PRON- run outside 
a combat of giant -PRON- see the fallen toro somer astride -PRON- chest choke -PRON- 
man twenty foot tall 
now thirty foot 
in another moment alden realize these giant would trample the handkerchief 
the sweep of one of -PRON- leg would presently encompass a hundred foot of this rocky ground 
anne be limp with a twist ankle 
alden pick -PRON- up carry -PRON- run to escape can take the drug now anne murmur 
foolish of -PRON- to be afraid of -PRON- 
put -PRON- dovn better take -PRON- george 
-PRON- think so too 
the gigantic trouser leg of somer and toro great svaye pillar rise into the air lunge back and forth 
dizzy mammoth blur in the gloom 
the enormous body be blot out the sky 
suddenly the titan shape lift upward and be go 
alden and anne each take a pellet of the drug 
the valley close in on -PRON- 
-PRON- scramble out to the surface 
the giant be still fight 
there be more light out here and -PRON- be plainly visible 
-PRON- seem that now -PRON- be fully a mile away 
-PRON- sway lock together 
five hundred foot tall 
-PRON- seem so 
then -PRON- go down roll lunging 
then up again stagger with mammoth stride 
and then anne cry oh look 
dear god look at roy somer have be beat to -PRON- knee fist be rain blow upon -PRON- 
then suddenly as though with supreme effort somer be erect 
one of -PRON- arm dangle behind -PRON- 
the watcher see that the dangle hand hold a boulder 
and somer heave -PRON- aloft and crash -PRON- down full on head 
there be a breathless moment while toro stand waver 
the boulder drop with a great roar to the ground and somer stagger back pant 
a breathless instant 
then the body of toro fall forward come topple crash down 
for a moment -PRON- thousandfoot length writhe and twist 
then -PRON- lie still with the mammoth figure of somer bend over -PRON- 
tiny arena omer bend down pant over the fallen body of -PRON- antagonist 
toro be dead 
no doubt of that the smash weltering head be mute gruesome evidence 
and there vas other evidence in that moment somer be aware that the motionless dead thing be dwindle 
death have check the effect of the drug 
-PRON- stand now sway over toro 
the body have seem perhaps seven foot long 
-PRON- see -PRON- shrink now 
the whole rocky terrain be shrink 
vague distant blur of monstrous shape be dwindle come closer take familiar form 
why these tremendous green stalk -PRON- be blade of grass 
that giant yellowwhite pole that be the matchstick somer hastily retreat 
-PRON- must keep away from that matchstick 
alden and anne may so easily be trample 
minute more of the shrink landscape 
and every moment -PRON- be more familiar 
that great red blur in the sky that be the geranium blossom 
somer turn the other way 
the great green stalk be thicken around -PRON- 
hardly high than -PRON- head now and -PRON- push -PRON- way through -PRON- 
presently -PRON- be wade in -PRON- with -PRON- top lower than -PRON- waist 
-PRON- come to a kneehigh parapet with an abyss beyond -PRON- and a great blur vista of open distance 
but the blur off there be take form 
the monstrous blur spread of surface off there so high and far away come down and shrink and show -PRON- to be the kitchen table 
somer stand peer over the brink of the flower the vastness of the kitchen floor seem a hundred foot below -PRON- 
but soon -PRON- be fifty twenty 
-PRON- swing over the edge 
for a moment -PRON- clung dangle by -PRON- hand 
a drop of ten foot 
-PRON- let go 
land on -PRON- foot 
the wall of the flower box dwindle to -PRON- shoulder 
the action of the drug be wear off 
somer sit on the open kitchen floor until the movement of the scene have cease the little flower box be here 
two foot long a foot wide six inch deep 
-PRON- bend anxiously over the small spread of dirt peer wait for anne and -PRON- brother 
-PRON- come at last 
tiny figure enlarge 
shove through the grass climb as -PRON- have climb over the side and out of the box 
carefully -PRON- lift the tiny sixinch figure of anne and set -PRON- on the floor but the dizzying swoop of -PRON- carry hand leave -PRON- gasping 
at last -PRON- be together again and all thing assume -PRON- normal proportion 
moonlight stream in through the open window of the darken kitchen 
the placid summer ocean ripple with silver 
somer sit with anne beside -PRON- 
alden be in the adjoining room at the radio sender think somer say out of a silence that the drug should be destroy 
too dangerous 
and the flower box the drug be in -PRON- 
destroy this flower box the girl shudder 
yes 
poor father 
conclude on page science question and answer -PRON- department be conduct for the benefit of reader who have pertinent query on modern scientific fact 
as space be limit -PRON- can not undertake to answer more than three question for each letter 
the hood of correspondence receive make -PRON- impractical also to promise an immediate answer in every case 
however question of general interest will receive careful attention 
editor science question and answer i be surprise the other day to find that the chemical formulae of cane sugar and milk sugar be the same this seem a little odd since -PRON- be different in sweeten power 
from what little chemistry have i always understand that different substance must have different formulae 
gloucester virginia 
the study of sugar and related compound belong in the realm of organic chemistry the compound of carbon 
the incredibly numerous compound contain carbon be all due to the latter remarkable ability to hook up with almost anything in chain ring and other formation 
all sugar be basically of the foimula give above but each be put together in a different way with result difference in taste appearance and chemical activity 
if the atom in a general sugar molecule be arrange merely by chance there could be different combination 
only a few dozen be know however 
in organic chemistry the formula above mean nothing 
-PRON- simply indicate the proportion by weight of carbon hydrogen and oxygen 
for a true indication of composition the organic chemist use structural formulae which show exactly how the molecule be put together 
-PRON- can show by the change in position of atom why this sugar and that be quite different 
as a typical example common alcohol have the same formula as methyl ether which be poisonous 
when -PRON- look at the chemist structural formulae ve see how -PRON- be different 
alcohol be methyl ether be this difference in hooking up make all the difference between a liquid which can be drunk and one which can not besides many other differnce 
ed 
editor science question and 
answer how be sleep explain 
when -PRON- brain sleep why do not the heart or lung do the same 
brooklyn the phenomenon of sleep have lately be much clarify 
intensive biochemical research have reveal that there be a rhythm to life 
-PRON- pulsate much like a wave 
the pulsation be period of activity and rest 
activity drive all the bodys chemical process in one direction toward fatigue 
this state be characterize by the presence of excess phosphate in the blood 
to complete the cycle the organic organism must have rest 
this allow the chemical process to reverse and prepare for another stretch of activity 
fortunately however nature have provide that -PRON- heart and lung have a different system of rest period than -PRON- brain muscle and bodj cell in general 
this be necessary because the animal organism can not survive any extended period of rest for the heart lung and stomach 
these organ work and rest pulsate very rapidly 
after each heartbeat the heart rest for a fraction of a second 
after each breath the lung take a short nap 
the total amount of rest in a day time for the heart be about the same as that -PRON- give -PRON- body when -PRON- lie down and sleep

editor science question and answer what be all the discussion on the canal of mar about -PRON- definitely know whether -PRON- be there or not 
one would think such an easily observed phenomenon would have be settle long ago madison wisconsin 
strange to say the authenticity of the martian canal have not be prove 
in shiaparelli vho be admittedly sharpeye announce that -PRON- see fine line marking on mar which -PRON- call canali 
unfortunately that italian word be far too suggestive when transpose to english 
shiaparelli mean channel not manmade canal 
since bis time the discussion have wax furious 
famous astronomer corroborate -PRON- discovery 
equally famous one deny -PRON- existence 
lately -PRON- be become generally credit that no such regular and numerous marking occur as shiaparelli and and lowell claim to see 
experiment conduct in the laboratory indicate that the human eye and mind have a tendency to connect faint spot and marking by wholly imaginary straight line 
in the case of view mar in a telescope the image be very hazy at good 
-PRON- literally take a conscious straining of the eye to distinguish even the large marking 
the socalle canal be at the limit of visibility may be subjective imagine rather than objective see 
photography have fail to reveal the mythical canal 
but the claim be make justifiably that under the good of condition the eye be more sensitive than the photographic plate so there be still no positive evidence on either side 
perhaps the only sure check on this engross question will be when man find a way to traverse space and explore mar -PRON-

editor science question and answer notice that the filterable virus be be call living liquid as in the farley story recently 
science fiction aside be -PRON- truly alive 
san francisco calif 
strictly speak the answer be probably no 
filterable virus seem to be more of the quality of subtle poison than of live matter 
-PRON- seem that some disease like the mosaic disease of the tobacco plant and silkworm jaundice produce a lethal substance which be able to interfere with the metabolism of healthy tissue 
unlike culture of germ the virus be filterable through the fine of porcelain filter indicate that -PRON- must have a colloidal composition 
whatever the substance be which can reinfect tissue with the disease that produce -PRON- -PRON- be not compose of the germ and microorganism -PRON- know at present 
either -PRON- potency be due to incredibly tiny living organism match in size by some of the large molecule or to superpowerful poison which in undetectable quantity can poison a mass of protoplasm unthinkably great in mass

new providence new jersey 
by john baltadonis story brain of venus take the cake for february as far as concerned 
the way -PRON- start out i think for sure that the ending be obvious there i be wait for the introduction of the heroine to marry captain brant when bango -PRON- get kill 
that in -PRON- stun -PRON- but vhen the second hero of the story get kill get to hand -PRON- to fearn for have enough nerve to write a story have two hero and both get kill 
protoplasmic station by paul ernst wasnot as good as i have expect -PRON- to be 
however -PRON- do provide good reading matter 
invader from the outer sun by frank long jr have a novel twist 
ice entity be something new 
black fog look like just another death cloud story at first 
only this time instead of a hero and heroine emerge victorious at the end mankind really be doom 
quite a surprise twist 
i agree with ronald armitage on the subject of cartoon 
why not pick a well subject 
frankfort ave philadelphia penna

wandrei come second with black fog 
these two author be about the only one who really know how to end a story with a wallop 
instead of the routine procedure in which the fairhaire hero save earth and live to win the heroine etc etc fearn discard the hackneye ballyhoo and reverse the situation so that the hero sacrifice -PRON- to save the entire universe

this story be good once but long ago well write though take sixth place 
echol story be formula stuff

now for some general criticism 
-PRON- should try to print a serial 
a novelette should be at least sixteen page long

i believe that -PRON- should be publish monthly or oftener 
and here be bouquet have bring back many famous old author to science fiction 
cumming merritt farley kline burk -PRON- be all good 
the general run of -PRON- story tend to be write in the principle of story first then science 
this be a vise plan a story may be dominant in science and have an entirely new conception but -PRON- will fail to hold the reader attention because -PRON- be poorly write and then again a story may be well write and fail to click because the plot be too old 
consequently -PRON- story cover a large scope because -PRON- requirement as to science content be more tolerant

editor science question and answer albinos be explain as lack pigmentation 
how do this occur 
can there be albino of any animal 
hartford conn 
although no complete survey have be make -PRON- be undoubtedly possible that there can be and have be albino in every specie of animal 
white blackbird white crow white swift white rabbit white rat and such be well known where the original stock be heavily pigment 
in albinos the factor for pigmentation have be lose in the intricate nuclear combination which occur in the ripen germcell 
in the case of an animal with one of the dark pigment melanin -PRON- be necessary for a ferment tyrosinase to act on a pigmentproducing substance call tyrosin 
if either factor drop out of inheritance the fertilize eggcell develop into an albino 
the phenomenon be comparatively rare because the pigment cell be hardy in the biological sense be closely relate to skin cell which be tough of all 
there be also a form of albinism which be acquire rather than prenatal 
case have be observe of animal such as chicken change from black to white or move rarely of human hair whiten overnight 
in such case of false albinism the pigment matter can be find to have move to a new locale as for instance the liver 
-PRON- be depigmentation rather than nonpigmentation

editor science question and answer be there a direct connection between the motion of the moon around earth and earth around the sun 
if so why doesnot -PRON- calendar indicate that the true month be onethirteenth of a vear 
superstition salt lake city utah 
there be no mechanical connection between the separate orbital motion of earth and moon 
if the moon be miraculously to increase -PRON- speed of revolution by twice -PRON- would move outward from earth but earth would not change -PRON- period of rotation and revolution noticeably 
by coincidence the moon period of revolution divide almost exactly thirteen time into a year 
the ancient try -PRON- good to work the moonperiod into the year with indifferent success

julius caesar with the aid of a competent astronomer establish in the calendar bear -PRON- name which be in use today except for the modification make by pope gregory in julius success in make a calendar that lose no more than three day in year be due to -PRON- disregarding the period of the moon entirely which be incommensurable with the year

editor science question and answer i donot believe personally that a cat have nine life but hear some wild story of how cat survive all sort of death and lot of people believe in -PRON- 
now let see what a scienceeditor would have to say about -PRON- besides plain bah 
long branch a cat have fundamentally one life and one only 
one bullet in -PRON- brain will kill -PRON- as suiely as -PRON- would any other creature 
but the cat do seem to have a special tenacity for that one life 
for one thing -PRON- have by long evolutionary process develop to perfection the art of always land on -PRON- foot 
this faculty measurably increase -PRON- chance for longevity 
then -PRON- have those richly innervate long hair or whisker in -PRON- cheek which apprise -PRON- of danger in the dark upon contact 
add to this be an ability to see in depth of gloom in vhich most other creature except owl and bat be totally blind 
-PRON- also have the homing instinct strongly develop which enable -PRON- often to reach safety and shelter when strand 
physically -PRON- have a highly develop efficient body well protect from tooth to claws 
-PRON- sense of smell and hearing be very acute 
and lastly -PRON- have far more intelligence than be generally suspect 
-PRON- seeming dumbness be a camouflage for a firstclass thinking organ 
all these point in -PRON- favor take together give the cat a distinct advantage in the grim game of elude death 
-PRON- be questionable whether even the anthropoid with -PRON- semihuman intelligence have great survival value than the feline 
only man with -PRON- gun and snare have the power to rob the cat family of prestige in the iunele
