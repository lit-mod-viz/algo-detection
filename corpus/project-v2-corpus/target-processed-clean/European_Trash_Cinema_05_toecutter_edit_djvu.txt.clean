The current issue of has an interview with Franco that Lucas conducted back in Fifteen Year Old Capitain) Spain/France Cast: Karc cassot, Jose Manuel Marcos, Edmund Arnand Mestral, Doris Thomas, Howard Vernon, William Alberto Dalbes, Luis Barboo. Pushed By curiosity, I this tape (released on the video label in France) to complete a "hole" in my Jesus Franco collection rather than by real interest. based on a Jules Vemes novel and I never could finish one, they always bored me to death, the plot always depended on scientific or educational mumbo iuabo. Being the screen's master of eroticism, sadism and horror, what would Franco do with this obviously kiddie matinee material? Well, it's a real horror... but not the one you might expect. Here, the horror cones from the way the film was edited: wrongly connected shots and abruptly chopped scenes which makes it look like a giant "bout-a-bout‘ (term used to define the un- edited film put together in chronological order). For example, I the Admiral, Edmund Purdon, who probably didn't spend more than a day or two on location (made up of two different harbors), goes from his house in the middle of the village and waves good-bye to his brat (the year old capitain to be) down in the ship some two miles away. The overall budget is so low that Franco was forced to create some of the funniest "action" highlights I have ever seen: such as a storm imitated by n<imerous buckets of water thrown at the boat's passengers with a vague rocking of the probably the only thing of value in the entire film), a hunting party consisting of the same repeated stolen taken from another film, and the final "liouquet", a pursuit on Mtnuti raft which its passengers are unable to navigate thus taking ten minutes to move a distance of one meter: a riot! I will avoid listing the anachronisms and the typical seventies look of the costumes, but believe me, they are countless. William Berger, who in real life is/was the guru of a hippie community certainly looks like one here, with his Indian scarf banded around his long curly blonde hair. Howard Vernon (curiously not listed on Spanish publicity materials) has a delicious time as a vicious slave merchant; his main direction seems to have been shave and wear the dirtiest brown suit you have." Purdom (who will appear the following year in gives one of his most wooden performances. said that he went to Europe only so he could follow his beloved Linda Cristian, however it seems here like he really regretted It! The principal character, Jose Manuel Marcos looks years old yet he has the voice of a year old, and Uiat spoils any hope of his beint^ convincint? in this part. Also, Contrary t« the adapted novel, he dies at the end (typical of franco to make his own wacky interpretation...). So, for a kiddie film, it has plenty of action and is close in its look to Vernes’ style, if you ignore details and flagrant repeated use of anachronisms. personally, I would think that even a very naive kid would, after viewing this film laugh and say. "Cmon Jess, give the kids a break.... For those who have asked, to my left is an autographed photograph of Diana Conca who was profiled in European Cinema number one.

All in all, though, you could do a lot worse; a well-told story with some facile plot twists and a satisfying little inale. it 'll do in a pinch. I doubt the accuracy of the release year on the box; looks like to me. Any Info would be appreciated, as usual The plot— or near as I can detemine fro* this french language tapeconcerns a young nan •ho finds that his father) a shady businessman. is involved with experiments designed to create a race of vampires German friend described them as "lesbian space vampires"). These attempts prove all too successful, as the vampires quickly assert their autonomy and turn or the father and his cohorts. Before this culminates, however, the son and his friend go on a series of adventures involving people in animal masks, suicide rituals, dancing servants and more funky lighting effects than an acid lashback. The film’s conclusion takes place on the same beach as other Rollin epics and is unusually upbeat. Ah. the spring of One could forget the era's global turmoil and settle back with the latest installment of Jean psychedelic French lesbian vampire series. In this particular instance it's number the director’s first color feature. Compared to his relatively impoverished debut Rollin had more financial free dom this time and he clearly decided to go nuts and throw out the conventions of narrative cohesion in favor of outrageous disjointed imagery. Even diehard European Trash Cinewa enthusiasts are likely to consider an extremely dated curio. For fans of the more outrageous indulgences of the late 60s, however, the film is a maior dlscoverv. Whi le visual ly simi lar to next effort is strikingly different in its more stylized treatment of Its plot. The erotic dance sequences do nothing to advance the story, but they along with the outlandish costumes and the anarchic score(remlnescent of all serve to make this a unique movie. Rollin fans will find an indispensible addition to their collections. The all-star cast alone is enough to assure some knowing chuckles; a veo' young Paul Bisciglia plays the suicide cult's leader, both hippie vampires from are present, and two of the Castel sisters, Pony and Cathy make their first Rollin appearances under the surname "Tricot". The pair figure into one of the film's nost enioyable scenes, which involves the antagonist talking on the phone while idly using one of the young woman's funky breast covers as a makeshift abacus! Also, Rollin takes care to exploit their nearly identical looks hy having thum walk in unison as much as possible, like macabre Double Mint Twins. If this doesn't sound like fun to you, or if you prefer Rarnstein films to and then stay the Kell away! The next reviewer to debut in is Max Della Mora, the editor of the Italian fanzine with a review of Max is currently serving a mandatory year's service in the Italian Army yet he still found the time to submit a review. Thanks to Max able to use the Italian movie ad for this film the first three films using the title were and A girl Is stalked by a group of dark figures armed with axes and pitch forks. She finds refuge in abandoned house in the middle of nowhere, but not for long as they track her down. Chased down a long corridor, the young woman finding no escape, jumps out the window into black emptiness. Jane (Linda Blair) wakes up and real izeii she was having a nightmare. Jane is pregnant and her parenls (a mother who worse than a and a peeping tom father who looks like a cross between Christopher Lee and Edmund Purdom) want to buy her a villa on an island where an exclusive Club is located. With an architect (Catherine Hlckland of soap-opera fame) and a real estate agent aboard the Foxy Lady (a tribute to Teresa Horlosky?) they all head off to the isious "lody in black' (a grotescpje an omen of bad luck to land. They all see a mystes Hiidegard Knef) and feel she the villa there are already an occult science student, Jul a Hasselhoff). Julie is a virgin and David tries evry way he can to change that situation but she would rather uncover the secret around the "light of the witch" who appears in the verv sasie window that the girl in dreaa Juaped froa. As soon as the group arrives at the villa the lady in black has murdered a sailor troii the Foxy Lady and then begins snuffing neabers of the group as well.

The father is killed when all of his veins explode, the architect has one hand aaputated, garrotted and is finally pierced by the sharp end of a swordfish's snout. The real estate agent is crucified and burned on the beach. Julie gets raped by a demon (who also has his aouth sewn shut) in a scene reainscent of the sexual violence found in I The reason for all this is practically non-existant (a black nan who had previously possessed Blair, but the requsite surprise endin occurs when Julie escapes but appears to be the new receptacle of The Evil One. was produced by Joe Filnirage so perhaps Karlin New) in is yet another pseudonyn of the man with a thousand monikers.

Three prisoners are escorted there at soldiers' gunpoint and thrown together in the saae cell. Lahaie and Pascal are sexually accosted by their guards each night, while Loaay (who incidentally, is Lina Koaav) couples with Gambler, the voluptuous Coaaander of Tago Hago (also faithless mistress), who struts around the sunny premises in a wardrobe seemingly culled from leather sex shops. Ganbier indulges on the side in a secret affair with Falk, the prison's sadistic chief guard.

Till then, things remain exactly as they were under different rule Sleekly filmed in modest but pictviresque settings, is fairly minor Franco, but not without humor or points of interest. It is useless as erotica at least in its abbreviated American version thanks to its overly mechanical sex scenes, which suggests the popularity of European women in Central America has something to do with their not requring any foreplay! The film’s prison exteriors were shot in an abandoned, peeling bullring (Hat Island, we're told, is so isolated even the rats have abandoned it!) and the gentle, uncredited flamenco score diiniinating the travelogue footage of the island amusingly seques during many "nightly visitation" sex scenes to bullfight fanfares. While the surge of pomposity seems comic on first viewing, it seems to respond on additional viewings to a disturbing tension that exists between its male and female characters that is sporting at best, mercenary at worst, but always using, humiliating, enslaving to both parties. Of the three men portrayed in we see the arrogant Falk paintully defeated in a nude arena battle with Lomay, under unfazed expression; a Falk/Gambier tryst is cleverly filmed in a high-angle shot, looking through the "castrating" blades of a ceiling fan, as the camera tracks slowly toward a hung photograph of the betrayed El Presidente; when Paolo assumes charge at the end of the picture, he is obviously caught in historical cogs that will crush this new Presidente as they have all the others. Whereas the male characters make us experience the bitter taste of defeat (to an admittedly sketchy but nevertheless felt degree), the women are creatures of ambition. Franco often contrasts their stewing expressions with shots of the sun riding the ocean’s horizon; it becomes his presentation of the light at the end of their respective Luiuiels. Again, the information is barely sketched, but present. The film is too embittered by its theme to treat its men as less than bullying barriers or its women as anything more than shapely scenery. ting scrapbook of "perfect specinens". Considering her outrageous wardrobe, Gambier should have stolen the picture but her perforwance seems listlessly disengaged, a far cry from her alert work in Even hrigitte Laliale, so effective as the scythe-wielding vampire in Jean is less assertive than usual. Asirte from hearty boorishness (which reminded me of Oliver performance in of all things), the film’s Best Character Award goes to the prison doctor, a Sid Vicious look-alike whose hobby is cutting the heads off clipped pom magazine photos, which he preserves in a Private Screenings release features no cast or credits information, either on the video box or the tape itself (which features a burned-on video title only).
