september i have never beat petherby not that -PRON- be a billiard expert but merely that i be a rabbit 
a masterly series of two nursery cannon vary sometimes by and very occasionally couple with a hazard be all i aspire to 
petherby on the other hand can generally manage to score something every time and not infrequently run into some of the humbler double figure 
the truth be that i do not possess the discriminate eye of a digglb for the nicety of angle 
but i have one facility of which i be proud and to which i shall allude later 
a few week ago at house i find -PRON- in one of -PRON- rare off mood 
these off mood of -PRON- generally signify that -PRON- beat -PRON- by a mere or so in up instead of by the more customary margin of or more 
but on the night in question petherby be play so shockingly and i so brilliantly on two successive visit to the table i have play for safety and score a clear board each time that at length i be to -PRON- -PRON- be -PRON- turn to play 
-PRON- first stroke though not exactly yield the result i have in mind be nevertheless a most satisfactory and comprehensive one 
i make a cannon off the red and then -PRON- ball and mysteriously disappear down different pocket 
petherby applaud with the butt of -PRON- cue upon the floor 
good shot sir -PRON- remark sarcastically 
what a pity -PRON- didnot all come off all come off i say with hauteur 
why -PRON- do all come off much well than i could have hope for even in -PRON- most sanguine moment 
what do -PRON- mean the red to have do something go down a pocket for instance then -PRON- would have win the game 
as -PRON- be petherby i say sternly remember please that there be three ball six pocket and certain law of coincidence which must operate at time 
in that stroke i distinctly see the finger of providence 
-PRON- be not intend to win this game 
just look at the position of the red 
the red be up the table close to the left cushion 
to pot -PRON- be an impossibility as far as -PRON- limited technique be concern but i feel that by careful aiming so as to hit the paint without disturb the ivory as i expressively put -PRON- when narrate the incident to pilkington i could manage to run in 
so i take a deliberate aim and press -PRON- cue gently forward 
slowly slowly -PRON- ball trickle up the table straight as a die all the way 
-PRON- be only a few inch from the red and still run true when the electric light go out 
at the same instant a loud report be hear follow immediately by a second and third 
zepp cry petherby 
where s -PRON- umbrella 
there s other game afoot i cry as i fumble for -PRON- cigarettelighter 
the wick flame up 
i hurry to the top of the table

get -PRON- back 
-PRON- wait till yon chap campin oh the ill get out there if -PRON- canot get -PRON- back no other way -PRON- will pinor -PRON- the pocket 
hurrah 
i shout joyfully 
game to -PRON- on the contrary say petherby crane -PRON- neck over -PRON- shoulder -PRON- s -PRON- game 
-PRON- ve give three away that red s never budge a hairsbreadth i swear 
bot i retort 
i couldnot possibly have miss 
i be dead on the edge of the red when the light go out 
can -PRON- solemnly affirm -PRON- hear the ball click 
of course not -PRON- ass i reply 
how could i through that beastly fire 
on the other hand do -PRON- see -PRON- miss how could i in the dark -PRON- answer testily 
exactly i say 
i couldnot hear -PRON- couldnot see 
as -PRON- maintain that the red hasnot move the fair thing will be for -PRON- to play the shot again 
bo -PRON- happen to have a candle on -PRON- there be a knock at the door and the servant enter 
if -PRON- please sir -PRON- say the police sergeant have just be and say -PRON- be want at once at the station 
i must go immediately say petherby struggle into -PRON- jacket 
what a nuisance these zepp raid be interfere with one amusement in this way eeally i half a jiffy i cry as petherby move to the door 
wait while i play that shoot again 
anybody would think there be a panic from -PRON- positively indecent haste 
sorry say petherby edge off but duty be duty 
where would -PRON- crest of five oyster rampant gule on a plat du jour argent be if -PRON- knightly ancestor have prefer billiard to duty 
so long 
there s a precedent for -PRON- i retort 
how about game of bowl but petherby be halfway down the staircase 
shirker 
i yell after -PRON- as i realise that the issue must remain undecided 
but i say would -PRON- take this light and hold -PRON- close to the red ball so now i want -PRON- to watch the red ball carefully and tell -PRON- if this white one which i be go to play touch -PRON- 
i place -PRON- own ball back in baulk take a long and careful aim and then somehow i manage to miscue 
no sir -PRON- didnot hit the red one say mary as -PRON- ball stop a few inghe from the baulkline 
i pretend to heave a sigh of relief 
thank goodness i exclaim 
properly to explain the objoct and effect of that stroke mary would necessitate -PRON- use technicality which -PRON- would probably not understand 
i think under the circumstance -PRON- have well not mention to mr petherby that i require -PRON- assistance 
-PRON- may consider -PRON- an abuse of -PRON- hospitality

-PRON- be famous for -PRON- english joint and be just now much visit by officer on leave who wish to eat together just as a certain subterranean grillroom be the favourite resort of officer on leave when as not infrequently happen -PRON- entertain the other sex 
to one of the table thoughtfully provide with so many chair that secret have ever be out cf the question here come two lieutenant very obviously oil duty for a brief season and rejoice in -PRON- liberty and -PRON- who be act as host and bad long since settle all doubt as to what -PRON- meal be to consist of flung out the order for roast beef almost before -PRON- be seat fling ib out too as though expect as instant a response from the stall as -PRON- get from -PRON- man all unmindful that this restaurant have leisurely process of -PRON- own carefully acquire and perfect during many many year 
meanwhile the saddle of mutton be wheel to -PRON- side and some unusuallyattractive slice be separate from -PRON- by a knife like a razor and lay before -PRON- 
i see the lieutenant eye -PRON- plate with illconceale enw but beef be in -PRON- mind 
beef have be in -PRON- mind for toilsome week and -PRON- do not betray -PRON- friend 
at least not wholly but i fancy the host waver wonder -PRON- begin and say no more for the beef arrive on -PRON- little wagon and -PRON- plate be soon cover with -PRON- 
-PRON- be not one of the most successful of the house joint and again i catch -PRON- eye direct towards -PRON- saddle 
be -PRON- too late -PRON- expression silently ask 
yes -PRON- be 
besides -PRON- have come there to eat beef 
nothing like beef the lieutenant attack with vigour but -PRON- still glance muttonward now and then meditatively between bite 
then the host speak 
-PRON- be in an undertone hut i hear because at this restaurant as i have say there be no secret wonder if -PRON- oughtnot to have bad saddle -PRON- murmur 
-PRON- look jolly good say the other 
-PRON- eat on 
do -PRON- think the beef be absolutely tophole today the host ask 
i ve know -PRON- better reply the other 
-PRON- eat on rather wish -PRON- would have mutton say the host 
after all saddle -PRON- know 
-PRON- s not too common 
beef -PRON- can always get in some form or other not like this of course but beef whereas saddle saddle rare 
i wish -PRON- d remind -PRON- of the saddle here settle on beef long ago say the other perform prodigy of valour with -PRON- knife and fork know but -PRON- as foolish not to look at the bill of fare 
i should have think of -PRON- then 
-PRON- still eat heartily 
no chance of get here again for goodness know bow long say the host 
the other dismally agree 
could -PRON- manage a slice of saddle after this the host ask after a busy interval 
sorry i couldnot reply the other through a mouthful which a lion would not disdain 
i donot believe i could either say the host 
what a bore 
i shall always regret not have have mutton 
so shall say the other 
at this moment the empty seat next to -PRON- be fill and to the enquiry of the head waiter whose duty -PRON- be to ask these question and then disappear the customer reply saddle of course 
that s all one come here for 
both the lieutenant groan audibly 
full though -PRON- be -PRON- lunch already ruin by -PRON- be ruin once more 
the typhoon at shanghai 
most of the german own yacht be lose 
overland china mail 
doubtless the german ambassador at peke have demand compensation for the nonneutral behaviour of the typhoon

matilda rather mislead -PRON- on the question of buy meat 
-PRON- say that there be no particular trick about -PRON- that all -PRON- have to do be to go to a place where -PRON- sell meat and buy -PRON- take care that -PRON- get the right weight and that the man do not throw too much bone and bit of sheep head and cow foot on the scale 
-PRON- say that a purveyor of meat be easily identify because -PRON- wear a peculiar blue costume and that the only other person -PRON- can possibly mistake for -PRON- be a wounded soldier 
i get into the right kind of place first time and say i should like to see some meat 
the man didnot take any notice of -PRON- until -PRON- have finish cut off and wrap up in newspaper a lump of meat for a readymoney customer 
then -PRON- say what kind of meat beef and mutton and such like thing 
the butcher affectionately slap the piece of meat which -PRON- have be carve and say a nice piece of steak 
how much meat have -PRON- get there 
i ask 
about five pound i weigh -PRON- for -PRON- think i shall want rather more than that 
-PRON- fetch down quite a largo piece of meat off a hook weigh -PRON- and say -PRON- be twentytwo pound 
i be think of buy a large piece than that i say 
how much be -PRON- want the piece i have in mind should weigh between three and four thousand pound 
the eager look which come into -PRON- eye be quickly succeed by something akin to fear as -PRON- go to the door to make sure the policeman be take -PRON- usual afternoon nap in the neighbourhood 
if -PRON- be want to buy meat i can sell -PRON- -PRON- but if -PRON- be look for a flock of sheep or a herd of oxen i admit i havenot get -PRON- in stock donot necessarily ant to take -PRON- all with -PRON- i say 
what with -PRON- boy leave -PRON- and -PRON- assistant join the army i havenot get time to waste joking 
perhaps -PRON- be think of give a party no i wasnot i just want some meat but i see -PRON- arenot accustom to serve large family and i d well try elsewhere 
i suppose -PRON- s possible to buy meat for a battalion somewhere in this town 
if -PRON- want to buy meat for the army -PRON- have to go to the meat market 
the meat market be a dull place the mention of thousand of pound of meat doesnot excite the inhabitant in the least and -PRON- be rather bored with -PRON- little order however -PRON- condescend to deliver the stuff for -PRON- after tot -PRON- up in sheep and oxen 
in spite of the fact that i have the vinegar and more than one kind of meat both matilda and the quartermastersergeant think that the man would expect a still great variety and under protest i add a few thing like bread jam and cheese 
i avoid small tradesman in make these purchase as -PRON- be so suspicious and only deal with people who have the capital to carry a decentsize stock 
when the war office hear about the thing that matilda and the quartermastersergeant have persuade -PRON- to buy -PRON- naturally get jealous and start send out circular to say that -PRON- werenot go to put up with any competition with -PRON- camp and that all camp without -PRON- name on be spurious and contrary to law 
of course i didnot worry about the war office because i know that -PRON- print circular donot mean anything and be only send out to do the printer and the postoffice a turn but the adjutant and -PRON- commandant who be in the regular army and doesnot understand war office humour seem to think that -PRON- ought to scratch the camp 
-PRON- get the idea that i have let -PRON- into some kind of a mess by what -PRON- be pleased to term -PRON- premature purchase of good and the idea seem to amuse -PRON- until i explain that i have buy all the good in -PRON- name and that when the corps fund be exhaust -PRON- would be personally responsible for the balance 
so -PRON- go to talk to the war office about -PRON- and meet all the other volunteer commandant and adjutant up there on the same errand 
when the war office find how unpopular -PRON- circular have make -PRON- and how -PRON- couldnot move about without fall over volunteer commandant and adjutant -PRON- say -PRON- didnot object to camp be hold if the of the various district didnot object 
some people who take the war office literally write to the of the respective district where -PRON- propose to camp and get leave which be then cancel by the war office 
for -PRON- i take no such risk and as neither the war office nor the of any district find out about -PRON- camp -PRON- didnot do any harm to anyone but -PRON- and -PRON- only catch little thing like rheumatism and indigestion 
if anyone do find out about -PRON- i shall apologise for -PRON- mistake and trust to -PRON- be too busy to do anything further in the matter 
the camp be rather a success -PRON- get most of the tent to stand up and some of -PRON- keep the rain out include those that matter mean of course -PRON- and and the by mark all the thing good for troop i persuade the railway company to deliver most of -PRON- provender in the belief that -PRON- be help the government who be among -PRON- good customer in these day 
i show the government mark on the tent to the railway people and -PRON- werenot to know any more than i be when i buy -PRON- that -PRON- be the condemn mark 
the vinegar didnot go so well as i have expect and i have a good deal leave on -PRON- hand in spite of the fact that i get quite a lot off in the shape of claretcup which i retail in the canteen 
some of the meat round on -PRON- and be accord a military funeral but not enough to make a fuss about 
i have to pledge locally whatwa leave of the and the credit to make up for the unused vinegar and defective meat but there have be no trouble on that score up to now as -PRON- wonot know about -PRON- until the bill come in and by that time i shall either be on permanent leave or else have enlist

marshal a multitude of figure from the extra halfpenny in the pound in the price of sugar up to the million pound represent estimate expenditure of the year -PRON- mastery of fact be so complete -PRON- explanation so lucid that the story be as easy to follow as an ordinary nursery tale 
time be during the prime of gladstone at the treasury and with -PRON- successor in later year when exposition of a budget be regard as opportunity for a great oratorical feat 
mr think nothing of occupy five hour finish up with a peroration almost worth an additional penny in the pound on the income tax

this habit lead to first step in downfall of bob lowe

in the end as everyone know -PRON- have to remodel -PRON- budget leave out the obnoxious tax label and all speech begin without exordium finish without peroration and no single sentence rise above the spartan simplicity of the multiplication table 
only approach to departure from this level be when -PRON- mention the dizzy height at which expenditure now fly 
-PRON- thereupon declare -PRON- confidence that house and country be prepared to support the government in bear whatever measure of taxation be deem necessary now and -PRON- ominously add in the future for the successful prosecution of the war 
a hearty cheer confirm this assurance 
cheerfulness be indeed the prevail note of historic occasion 
fresh burden of taxation impose enormous 
affect every class from the consumer of halfounce of tea and quartersof a pound of sugar to the hapless millionaire who out of -PRON- modest income of a hundred thousand pound a year will be call upon to contribute to the state the sum of more than onethird of the whole 
this of course in addition to -PRON- share of indirect taxation 
as the member for sark say lloyd george chastise the taxpayer with whip lay on with scorpion 
and yet no murmur be hear 
in november last lloyd george impose fresh taxation estimate to bring in a revenue of million 
on the top of that levy new taxis which in a full effective year will increase the revenue by little short of million 
a big bill but -PRON- will be meet uncomplainingly with any further charge that may presently be necessary for carry on the war to -PRON- inevitable end 
business do

frankly i be knock 
-PRON- ought to have see that garden 
everything have grow furiously everything be much big 
nothing have stop 
but here i must strike a note of sorrow 
with one brave to try -PRON- before read any further try -PRON- yes isnot -PRON- well -PRON- get the seed in 
-PRON- only cost two shilling monster gift parcel but i have to pay one shilling for postage as the potato make the parcel heavy 
still i didnot grudge that as there seem to be an astonishing number of seed 
in fact when -PRON- have fill -PRON- garden there be a packet of early to come pea another of dwarf kidney bean and yet a third of champion leek leave over 
i mention this in case anyone would like to buy the surplus 
-PRON- re still all right except the pea which have be play with by alastair medhurst and the bean bag which be fray along one edge 
no bean have escape mind but the bag have unquestionably depreciate will allow for this 
after the seed be all in i use to look at -PRON- a good deal that be to say i look at the soil which cover -PRON- may be that anyway -PRON- be a new variety and i have arrange to prick off that day if not interrupt by caller

-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be only try to be friendly and that i d never get an onion if i couldnot take a tip 
and then -PRON- go indoor noble exception nothing be eatable 
the greenstuff be overrun with caterpillar and slug the root be rot the bean be tough and coarse the pea be hard pea and the radish be huge and woolly 
what remain -PRON- potato -PRON- brave plucky persevering potato -PRON- prove -PRON- only standby

i take -PRON- that mr maurice hewlett design -PRON- new dovel the little iliad heinemann frankly as a grotesque an opinion in which four exceedingly quaint illustration by sir philip burnejone distinctly confirm -PRON-

i can promise -PRON- good entertainment and though as i have hint the thing be plan in a freakish mood the author have not let -PRON- off the honest labour of construction and polish 
-PRON- sympathy be throughout with -PRON- wicked baron who be a very new version of the strong silent hero and may fairly be consider a sport 
what i refuse to believe about -PRON- be that even though -PRON- shoot from a pony cart -PRON- get -PRON- gun up like lightning and fire at the instant consider the painful struggle -PRON- bad to get -PRON- wineglass or cigar accurately to -PRON- mouth pathological detail that mr hewlett have be at pain to rub well in

bichard furlong be a painter and etcher and the object of mr thurston be to trace -PRON- progress from obscurity to fame but though -PRON- be represent as do a lot of artistic work in bis spare time -PRON- would be more fair to say that the real success of bichard be gain in the domain of what i may call wish to put the matter as delicately as possible unceremonious polygamy

what -PRON- do not yet know but should take the early opportunity of learning be with what masterful skill with what touch of pathos the dull man miller and general dealer -PRON- dross purify in the fire of adversity be slowly step by step transform into a hero of sublime unselfishness 
nearly every page of the story certainly every chapter reveal the inventive resource of the author 
these never fail and the reader be with grow interest hurry on to the unexpected denouement
