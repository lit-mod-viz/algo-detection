Bi issues and should be Big Spring Cicle, Cookeville, Ever since George Living Dead •films hit the screen, -filmmakers -from all over the world have been trying to their success. Very -few have come close, so it should come as no surprise that misses by a country mile. Yet the -formula of the dead returning to life to attack the living is such a good one that even a failure like this contains enough bright spots to prevent you from engaging the fast forward button too often. At times it is very reminscent of which is both a plus and a minus. Three hunters and their female companions head out to a secluded part of the country to enjoy the pleasures of blowing away furry little creatures. One of the hunters, named Mel, has a few skeletons in his closet a kleptomaniac) which causes the group quite a bit of trouble. As they make their way to the happy hunting grounds Mel discovers a diary that dates back to the days of the Civil War. Seems a Confederate general and his men were tortured and they vowed to return one day to exact their revenge. Well it doesn't take the brains God gave a box of rocks to see what's going to happen next. The theft of the diary is the catalyst for the General and the boys to return and spend the balance of the flick attacking everyone. After forty minutes of this, one of the brain damaged cases (the hunter named Wyatt) gets the bright idea of returning the diary. Instantly the Confederate dead guys head back to their graves. The quality of this video is about as substandard as ever seen without wondering if I rented a bootleg. I don't blame Mogul because it appears like the film itself is the is so poor at times that entire scenes are remedied useless because you can't understand a word anyone is saying. The film was shot on location in Maryland which aids the mood, but poorly composited day and night shooting (one of the actors asks a question in daylight and the other answers in darkness) keeps it from being sustained. The gore scenes are of the usual type- pull out the cow entrails and munch down on them in extreme closeup. The one risible detail here is the hilarious dubbing used for the zombies eating; it sounds like William Buckley having an orgasm. At one point a local cop enters the fray and trys to convince everyone that the living dead are only corpses reactivated on puppet strings! eaten for his trouble. Finally the score by Charlie Barnett consists of a couple of themes played endlessly throughout the film. have you climbing the wal Is. I not a big fan of films in the I mode. Too many times the director and/or screenwriter uses this genre to vent their frustrations toward women (especially those whom are either independent or nubile or both). recreates the situations found in films like or even a film from the such as where a house of innocent victims is invaded by the sleaziest of villains. The film opens with a robbery which demonstrates the gang’s brutality, as several innocent people are murdered. The three gang members’ auto develops problems so they are forced to seek refuge at a villa in the country. At the villa they come across Sister Christina (Florinda Balkan) and her students. Of the three gang members, Aldo (Ray Lovelock) professes to the women that he’s basically a good guy and he’ll try and control the other two (Walter and Lino). Walter -and Lino are portrayed as just above level. The sight of a naked woman causes them to become slobbering sex fiends with Walter (Flavio Andreini) having strong tendecies that for dime store analysis?). For the next hour the women are abused and degraded until Sister Christina can stomach no more. She poisons Lino (who was ncompaci tated during an earlier rape attempt) and blows away Walter with his own gun. Aldo (who in flashback sequences detailing the robbery, it is discovered killed the innocent people) is cornered and beaten to death by all the other girls. Director Franco Prosperi directs with a surehand (there are a minimum number of closeups so the dubbing isn’t as distracting), hot flinching when it comes to violence and degradation. Unfortunately, he’s recently been forced to direct endless ripoffs and to name a few) but based on this film one can hope he’ll return to the horror fold soon. Ray performance as Aldo convinces us of his sincerity only to reveal the low-life he really is. Florinda Balkan has appeared in numerous films over the past twenty years and her versatility really shows here. Forced to appear nude early on only proves he’s not afraid to take on difficult roles. This film is considered by some to be a sequel (in story similarity only) to Aldo That film took the plot of 'and transferred it to a train. A difficult film to recommend but at least Prosperi doesn’t give in to his baser instincts. The women triumph in the end, but at too great a cost. It leaves a bitter taste. Please note the still to your right. Some of you will recall my comments last issue on Gary thesping ability. Well Gary requested a copy of so I sent him one highlighting in yellow my mention of his performance. Gary obviously has a sense of humor the autographed still proves. By now you also realize that this issue is late and a bit thin with reviews. Excuses range from a hectic work schedule (budget, oil reserves cal cul at ions, etc) to the Holiday season (a three year old who demands she trim the Christmas tree) to the fact that in a few months be moving agai (groan It will only be across town (living out here in the boonies is boring) so no change in address. Bo expect the next tew issues to be late also. try and make it up with some pagers next year. I hope everyone has a good time this season. Let me get this off my chest. Empire Pictures is legendary for producing mostly junk that is quickly relegated to the video screen. Now they’ve gone and formed a Video label expressly for crap that they know is so bad they’ve given up the thought of any serious exhibition know they released their first two "films" on a double-bill but trust me, it ain’t gonna last). Here is a list of titles supposedly set up for release over the next months: I A (obvi ousl designed for people who rent only Empire or Troma product (how did somethinq like that get in here) and I know supposed to be objective but I airlt wasting time with that stuff. Lucio is set ^or release in December by Media. Prism has and while Vestron has All three are based on children’s toys (not really but merchandising is really getting out of hand). New label Virgin Vision has an old title for a new film called Not the Vincent Price nor the Italian made version but one that stars Trish Everly as identical twins (one of which has an evil dog-ooh, scary) The synopsis to reads like a remake of Now there’s a film just begging right. know zip about and 'like to keep it that way. Academy tries to ripoff renters by rereleasing as Imperial Entertainment has which from the previ ews, ooks like a cross between and
