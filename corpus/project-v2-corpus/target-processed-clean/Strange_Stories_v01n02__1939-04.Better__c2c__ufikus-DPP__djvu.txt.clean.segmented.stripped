such men do not scoff they run for they sense the ungodliness of zombie eyes the atmosphere of hell that permeates the presence of these things beyond the grave who neither talk nor eat nor bleed when torn apart
corpses of corruption haiti inner china eyewitness accounts by those who do not want to talk afraid of the demonic power which might reach out to fasten uncanny fangs on those who tell too much
even starving rats and wolves of china shrink from these corpses of corruption nor will the snakes of haiti strike at these walking things which defy poison
haiti a united states marine lost in the swamp given up for dead by his comrades forced to seek refuge with natives preparing for black magic
he would have become a human sacrifice to the zombie god had he not at one time saved the life of a wounded native
and now this native pleads for the white marine and he is allowed to see but never tell under penalty of what he knows would be worse than torture
but he has now spoken to one he can trust
the zombie god will understand because this one in whom he has confided does not scoff nor seek to punish by manmade laws
unholy discord the night is dark the wet mist of an eerie fog rises like the breath of hell from the stinking swamp where reptiles crawl and wait to devour insects which venture into the night
tom toms accompany a weird incantation of unholy discord as tiny lights appear on surrounding hillocks
then a stronger light looms up in the depths of the swamp a fire before a crude altar ready for the kill
the smaller lights of single torches begin to move like fireflies slowly converging on the altar fire until they are dimmed by the greater light and then go out
the assembly is ready
the master a giant native clothed in filthy shroud steps forward and stands before the altar
the black skin of his fiendish face smeared with rancid oil and blood shines in the firelight and his eyes gleam like pools of phosphorus
the incantations grow louder broken only by mumblings of a demonic ritual
the sacrifice a scream
the sacrifice
a young virgin her body writhing like a captured python as it is carried to the altar by two naked blacks each holding a leg and an arm of the victim
the sight of the altar and the fire is too much for the terrified girl
she swoons
voices stop but the torn toms pound with increased fury
the great moment has arrived
gently the quivering body is laid upon the bloodstained altar
the master steps forward a knife flashes and the body is still
the torn toms stop as though in silent respect for the departing soul of this child of sacrifice
no sounds save the crackling of the fire and the noise of insects
the master withdraws his knife and raises his hands above his head
instantly voices mumble and the torn toms once more begin their dirge of death
sinister operation down again comes the knife this time slowly
the incantations continue
then with the precision of a surgeon the master cuts into the breast of the girl
slowly carefully he removes the heart
he drops the knife and takes the bleeding heart in the hollow of both his hands and holds it before him
all but the master drop upon their faces in supplication
none sees what the master does with the heart for when the natives come to their feet again the heart has disappeared
somewhere in the folds of that filthy shroud rests the cherished organ of a girl who might have found love
but the ceremony is not over although the swamp is now quiet
the body of the girl is quickly removed
authorities must never find it

a marked grave another zombie for the master
for days prior to this festival of evil a grave has been marked a grave where rests the body of a strong man who died in the prime of life
he must live again and this time work for the master
the unholy procession soon arrives at the designated grave
by this time the moon has risen
the master halts
no words are spoken only queer movements of fingers and lips
the master steps back
the men come forward
crude shovels appear
and soon the wooden box which houses the corpse pronounced dead by a white mans doctor is opened
death looks up into the moonlight
it matters not if rigor mortis has stiffened the body or if putrefaction has brought a stench beyond white mans endurance the corpse is lifted by strong arms and stood up on its feet in front of the master
the master then grasps the hand of the corpse and holds the body upright before him
then the followers fall prostrate and watch no more
only the master speaks but his words are a whisper
his other hand passes over the head and face of the man perhaps buried for weeks
there is a sickening gurgle stronger than the rattle of death
and this sound comes not from the master but from the thing before him
a zombie is born the master still holds the hand of the corpse but not for long
the dead man is standing alone
his eyes open but in those eyes are no longer a look of human intelligence but a vacant stare of a soulless creature without consciousness or the breath of god
another zombie is born
a compact with hell bargain for the virgin sacrificed to the devil
who knows donot believe it says the skeptic
it might have looked true but the man wasnot dead
he had been drugged by the socalled master perhaps some strange drug known only to the witchdoctors of haiti
this drug might have the power to suspend animation stop the heart and lungs sufficient to fool any doctor
maybe the drug would soften the brain
and then when the master dug him up days later another drug was administered and the man came back to life his mind a blank
an imbecile not a zombie

continued from page john who was employed by a french planter
says the frenchman saw john die of pneumonia
he was pronounced dead by the doctor and before we could bury him rigor mortis had set in and his body turned green
i saw him buried
three weeks later my son said he saw john working in a field back in the hills but john seemed deaf and dumb
in order to quiet my son i investigated
the man looked like john even to the scar on his cheek and the pock mark on his nose
but john didnot know me
he seemed to look right through me with the expression of an imbecile
no it couldnot be john
john was in his grave
of course it was possible for two men to look alike even to similar scars but this man didnot have expression dismissed the thought but my son was not convinced
he had heard too much about zombies
so i secured permission to open grave
we dug
the grave was empty
but someone must have learned about my secret investigation for when we went to claim body he was missing
the native owner knew nothing about him
he said we must have been dreaming or seeing a ghost
and the skeptic replies of course they were dreaming
perhaps the grave was robbed by body snatchers who sold it to medical students for dissecting purposes
a strange experience but how about the japanese corporal who confidentially revealed his strange experience in northern china to an english friend within the past year
here is the story for many miles northwest of peiping a japanese regiment had advanced finally nearing the objective not far from mongolia
but before they could reach this point they had to pass through a small mountain village situated in a tiny valley
the road was narrow bounded by two hills which commanded the road
on the clifflike sides of these two hills were huge rocks ideal for machinegun nests which could mow down any soldiers entering the village
there were several of these nests and many japanese soldiers had been killed
finally the japanese commander brought up his artillery and gave orders to blow those machinegun nests to bits
they were demobilized
any chinese gunners in them were buried under a pile of rocks and debris
all but one
heavy shells could not stop this gun which kept firing whenever any japanese soldiers came into view
something had to be done to silence that gun
finally a japanese corporal with one man was ordered to climb the rear of the hill and try to sneak down on the chinese gunner and destroy him
the whole regiment waited
an hour passed
then the corporal and his man were seen crawling on their bellies down from the top of the hill
they had to be careful
the slope was steep
it was an intense moment
if the chinese gunner saw them he would be able to swing his gun around and exterminate them with ease
but the gun kept shooting at the road below whenever a japanese soldier appeared in the open
the japanese purposely coaxed the fire so the gunner would not notice the men creeping down behind him
tense moments it was not until the corporal was fifty feet away that he could barely see the chinese gunner protected under a heavy arch of rocks sitting at his gun which pointed through a small opening
the corporal was afraid to hurl a hand grenade for fear that the explosion might loosen the dirt beneath his own body and he and his man would slide to death
and it would be difficult to throw a grenade in the small archway
furthermore the gunner was so protected that even a pistol shot would have to be too accurate
there wasnot enough of the body exposed to view
no the only way was to knife him or shoot him at close range
suddenly as the corporal crawled closer a small rock under him gave way
it rolled down the slope and bounced on the archway
the japanese corporals heart almost stopped from fear
if the gunner heard it and looked around it would be sure death for the japanese
but the gunner didnot budge
he seemed to be glued to the spot his eyes on the opening in front of him
forty feet thirty feet twenty ten
they were upon him
now to rush him
the corporal drew his gun and the private grabbed his trench knife in readiness
both men jumped at the same time and inches away the corporal shot the chinese in the back while the private plunged a knife into the filthy neck
the gunner seemed to slump over his gun from the force of impact and the two japanese satisfied they had killed him jumped to the top of the archway and shouted to their comrades
a cry of victory went up from the troops below as they ran into the road in answer to the brave corporal
but something was wrong
the gun supposed to be silenced began firing again and several japanese soldiers dropped in the road below
the corporal infuriated dropped behind the archway and this time hurled a hand grenade tearing head and arms from the chinese gunner

by author of the curse of the house feast in the abbey etc real horror lay in the fact that harry clinton was just an ordinary college boy
he sported a disreputable suede jacket the left underarm wellworn from the rubbing of the textbooks he carried
he was given to whistling popular song hits and he owned most of the latest swing phonograph recordings
he drove a nondescript car and worried about the price of gasoline
he played basketball on the second team he liked ketchup on his hamburgers he oh well he was an ordinary college boy just one of thousands
and yet he knew grinning fear
harry clinton had gone to western tech for two years when professor bairn began his experiments
like the other students in psychology clinton participated in the initial trials
it was just a routine matter nothing more
professor bairn was interested in the rhine experiments the duke university studies in extrasensory perception
he summarized his intentions to the psych class briefly at the outset
the rhine experiments were an effort to determine the laws of chance and their relation to human guesses heard of hunches and intuition and telepathy bairn told his class the first day
well heres your chance to find out what its all about
i have here a pack of twentyfive playingcards
they are special cards five suits of five each
there are five stars five circles five squares five sets of wavy lines and five crosses
they are single black line figures on a white background and these five were more or less chosen for their simplicity and their symbolic association with ordinary conscious and subconscious images
is that clear enough
five sets of cards square circle cross star wavy lines pass these sets out and allow you to examine them
he did so and harry clinton looked at the little cards with the rest
professor bairn continued the basic idea in using these cards is simple
the operator holds one of them up to the subject with only the back visible
the subject closes his eyes allows his mind to become a blank
then he calls out the name of the first of the five symbols to cross his consciousness
he may actually seem to see a square or a circle or a star as the case may be
perhaps the operator and the subject are seated back to back so that there is no possibility of facial expression or eye reflection on the part of the operator informing the subject or giving him a hint class exhibited tepid interest clinton included
according to the experiments the score of correct guesses in most cases is five
this seems natural enough because if you were to go through the deck of twentyfive and call out star each time youd have to be right five times since there are five cards in each of the five suits
but and this is a very large but in the course of these experiments it was discovered that some students were able to guess perhaps ten or twelve cards correctly
upon repeating the tests over a period of days many achieved scores of fifteen or even twenty
certain people seemed peculiarly apt guessers
while the scores of others varied from high to low there were some who persistently turned in the same or nearly the same high score
this has led to the setting upof a theory of extrasensory perception an unknown quantity which may or may not account for certain people having the knacks in making hunches or foreseeing the future or even for receiving telepathic communications
harry clinton was thinking about betting on football games
certain students submitted to months of testing
it was discovered then that odd effects on their scoring ability could be brought about by getting them drunk or by testing them when they were fatigued or excited or stimulated
some of them scored higher when told they were making progress others dropped woefully
it was ascertained that guessing ability has nothing to do apparently with the actual intelligence of a person
but and this is important the variance of reaction under differentiated forms of stimuli implied that there was a definite power affected rhine has chosen to call this power the power of extrasensory perception
i believe that professor rhine has shown the way to opening up new frontiers of the human mind
and with your permission i should like to call upon a few volunteers today clinton was one of the five chosen
he watched three others sit blindfolded in a chair while professor bairn held up the cards one by one and waited for them to call out a symbol
he sorted the cards into piles of correct and incorrect guesses
clinton noticed that the first subject a girl guessed very swiftly
the second hesitated often
the third went quite fast for a space slowed down and regained speed toward the end
clinton sat in the chair placed the warm blindfold over his eyes and began guessing
square circle circle star square curly line star cross cross curly line cross no thats a square now a cross circle he felt queer
it was hardly his own voice droning
it was hardly his brain that saw in the darkness the rapid flickering images of circles and squares and stars and curly lines and crosses
something directed him made him speak
he completed the test in fortytwo seconds said nothing
he discoursed on individual peculiarities mentioned how some guessers were fast others slow others erratic
he also intimated that memory that is the knowledge that one had already called star five times and consequently would not call it again during the same testing might subconsciously influence the guessing real definitive score he said can be obtained only after seven consecutive tests
ah mr clinton would you care to go through the pack again six times for the benefit of the class
clinton agreed sat down in the chair again
the images came swiftly
the period bell rang as the tests were concluded and the students trooped out bulky figure leaned close as clinton rcse and removed his bandages
mr clinton like to have a word with you
yes professor
mr clinton i should very much appreciate your working with me this semester on these tests
your initial scores i might say are ah remarkably high
this might be a fluke an accident but any extraordinary ability should be cultivated
of course this will be credited to your regular work you know
why sure
why not
say what is my average anyway
mr clinton
an amazing twentythree
clinton worked with professor bairn for months
the experiments broadened in their technique
new methods were employed
one night baim called clinton on the phone and requested him to guess the cards over the wire
they worked in separate rooms for several days worked with screens between them worked in total darkness conducted the tests with telegraph keys and called the guesses in french and german
it made no difference clinton showed his remarkable aptitude throughout
at first for clinton it was a lark
then it became a problem to wonder over
after a time it reached the stage of a competition a battle of wits against the unknown
and finally during the third month it was drudgery
baim was writing a monograph on his work with clinton
although the professor endeavored to repress his enthusiasm clinton knew that he was highly pleased with the venture
the extraclassroom nature of the studies kept clinton very busy demands on his time and his insistence on undertaking tests at odd hours and under odder circumstances began after a while to annoy him
there were days when clinton went through the deck thirty times running
he grew sick of the symbols exasperated
even the surprisingly high percentage of totally correct scores no longer seemed a worthy goal to him
despite all the work he understood no more of his unusual power or ability than he had at the beginning
he merely closed his eyes and the pictures came the five symbols loomed up almost automatically
he tried guessing ordinary playing cards and failed miserably
he lost two dollars on the home team in a football game
he had no luck in guessing examination questions
undoubtedly this peculiar sixth sense was uncontrollable
by the conclusion of the third month it was worse than that
he left his daily tests with headaches
he began to experience periods of moody irritability
moreover he had a tendency to forget trifles and details
a sort of mild amnesia seemed to steal over him at times so that he was unable to account for his actions for halfhours at a time
usually after his testing periods he would have difficulty in concen18 trating on anything else for quite a while
the symbols stuck with him and closing his eyes he would involuntarily conjure up images of crosses and stars and curly lines and squares and circles
they floated in his head and when he opened his eyes again an hour had passed somehow
this got worse
clinton told no one for he himself did not quite know what was the matter
but in the middle of may he suddenly experienced an attack of amnesia which lasted for three days so hard to think
harry clinton that was his name had gone into a room and now his hands were around something soft
he had done many things in the past three days and somehow he couldnot think just what they were
or rather a part of him didnot want to remember what they were
they had been bad things
was he at home in the roominghouse in his own bed
was this all a nightmare
no it was real
he was standing with his hands around something soft and three days had passed
three days of school of study of work
why couldnot he remember them
it was even hard to see
he felt as though his eyes were closed as though he was taking the tests guessing at the brightlycolored mental pictures of crosses stars curly lines squares and circles
that was why he couldnot remember
it had something to do with the tests and the way they had affected him lately
he must think back now
for a week or so he had been taking forty turns through the deck a day
professor baim had asked him to as a final experiment to be written up for his almost completed monograph
each days testing had left him with a terrific headache
more than that he had been unable lately to shake off the recurring visions of the five symbols
he would leave the college and one or more of the symbols would come and stay in his brain
he would fall asleep thinking of the cross and awake with the same thought static in his mind
that had caused his memory lapse
but where was he now
he stared down again at his hands and gasped as mists cleared
he harry clinton remembered
he remembered that first evening when he had thought he was going to be sick and had stepped into the alley
he had leaned over the refusebox as consciousness dissolved into a swirling mist
but now he could recall what happened
he had leaned over the refusebox had gazed into it and seen what lay at the bottom
two broken sticks lay there probably torn from some packingcrate
they lay there one atop the other and they had formed a cross
a cross
clinton had picked them up that is his hands had done so
clinton himself did not exist
there were only hands and something guiding them which was not clinton or brain some alien force that felt drawn to the symbol of the cross
the hands picked up the sticks fumbled about in the trashbox for a length of wire bound the sticks into a permanent crucifixshape
then body had walked down the narrow alley and eyes had kept looking at the base of the cross where the stick was broken and ended in a jagged point eyes had gloated
but clinton himself had hated what he was doing because he did not understand and hated the other part of consciousness which drove him to fashion a symbol he wished to forget so that as he walked he grew very angry
every time he closed his eyes the cross was there in his forehead
it was burning up there just the way it did when clinton guessed the cards at school
only there were no cards this time and still the cross remained
the memory was haunting him making him do absurd things like fashioning this wooden crucifix with the pointed end
if only clinton could forget the cross
he closed his eyes quite tightly lurching down the alley wishing that the two crossed iron bars against his brain would go away
he must not see the cross clinton opened his eyes and saw the man coming down the alley from the opposite direction
it was dark but the moon was up and he saw that the man wore black skirts
for a moment he feared he was delirious and then he realized the truth
it was a priest
coming near he saw the moonlight pick out a glittering pattern on the priests chest
a glittering pattern of a cross
the golden cross dangled it swayed from side to side as the priest walked
the moon was cruelly bright so that its rays made of the crucifix a blinding blur
clinton looked and could not tear his eyes away
but he wanted to he wanted to with all his soul
he did not want to do what he and then clinton stepped over to the priest just as he passed and from behind his back he drew the wooden crucifix with the pointed end and drove the point straight into the priests chest
he walked away his empty hands clutching at the air with a sort of joy born of the fact that they were empty they no longer held the cross
there was joy in his mind too for it was empty of the symbol which when normal he so deeply respected but which in his dreamlike state of abnormality obsessed him
no cross now only that tingling emptiness his whole brain was empty and free
harry clinton went home and slept slept gratefully without dreams
for he was empty and when he awoke he had forgotten the night before with the cross and the priest
in the class the next day when the cards were called clinton scored only seven
two squares had come two circles one curly line and two stars
but no cross
never during the entire test had he called out a cross or thought of one
there were times when his eyes closed he had almost consciously tried to conjure up the vision of the cross in his mind
he had failed
he knew that there were five crossmarks in the pack of twentyfive and yet in honesty he could not call aloud an image that he did not see
this clinton now remembered remembered the following day the day he guessed the five stars correctly
it was the day of the astronomy lecture too
had that affected him
he wondered
he had called the five stars correctly
after leaving class the headache had come

10c and 25c at all druggists he walked through the cool streets of dusk his feet moving automatically along unbidden paths
thoughts refused to come
he stopped in at a drug store and bought some aspirin then meandered along the streets again
he had not wanted to go to his room
he caught himself straining to hear the sound of cars passing the conversation of others in the street
for some reason he was particularly anxious to be amidst noise and lights and people anything that might arrest his attention and ease the ache in his temples the ache that was all dull nothingness in which a bright star blazed
erratic footsteps followed his gregarious urge until he was moving along downtown
the welcome clangor of streetcars began to fade and only constant blinking enabled him to keep his eyes open
abnormal nictation seemed the sole salvation at the moment when now even sounds failed to hold his attention he had entered the vaudeville theater sunk into a loge seat and willed himself to watch the final reels of the motion picture flashing across the screen
at the conclusion he experienced a nasty shock when the trademark of the producing company flickered into view with its crest of five stars
the theater was nearly deserted at supperhour and in the darkness harry clinton fought a losing battle with the fivepointed image that thrust itself again and again between his inner eyes and his outer vision of the screen
the brassy orchestra heralded the stage show and for a few minutes clinton again knew peace
but the star act clinton had winced when the master of ceremonies announced the turn as such was the personal appearance of a movie queen
the whole thing was madness
movie star she swept onto the stage against a background of a glittering silverfoil star
garishly lighted the five silver points gleamed painfully and clinton could not move his eyes away
the image mocked him and the blonde girl before it undulating about the stage in sequins seemed a part of the star itself
clinton bit his hand to keep from screaming
his mind groped for a thought any thought to hold his attention to swerve it from the thought which engulfed him
and in the darkness he lost
he rose to his feet and started down the aisle before the act was over
no longer was he conscious aware of thought or action
he passed the boxes and entered the passageway which led backstage
some part of him was moving slowly cautiously
all he saw was a great glittering star a star which was emblazoned on his mind and which obtruded between any other image and reality
he must get rid of the star in his mind
cautiously he moved along the deserted backstage corridor
the act was over the hallway momentarily deserted
he walked slowly down toward the door under the light paused before it
there was a gold star on the door of the dressingroom
its five points were sawteeth biting into his brain
he stared at it then pushed the door open
the blond girl was sitting at her dressingtable eating
clinton did not see her
he saw a star
there was a heavy bluntended mirror on the table
there was a large sturdy walkingstick in the corner
clinton did not see them
he saw a stageproperty artificial mace in a wallstand
its head was studded with fivepoints
a star
clinton ignored the other weapons
walking slowly he seized the mace as the door closed behind him
the girl turned around
clinton saw the star burn brighter
she rose said something
clinton saw the star move closer
it was close enough to reach now
some part of him held the mace
and then dream fused with reality as he brought the mace down
one two three four five times each time a point fell away from the core of torment in his brain
then there was only a blur that became red red as the pool on the floor where something lay
clinton turned opened the door walked out back through the passage and resumed his seat in the theater
he must have fallen asleep for when he awoke the last show was over and the houselights were going up
he did not remember how he had come to this place or what he had done here
and he did not think about stars
the next day in class he had refused to take the test telling professor bairn that he was indisposed
at the time he did not know any reason for doing so except that he felt vaguely tired and incapable of effort
he asked to be excused early and went home
he did not even read the papers had he done so he might have seen the accounts of the mysterious death of father pornelski who had been murdered by an unknown religious fanatic two days before
he could have read of a second murder which was already making national headlines the strange death of a wellknown motion picture actress was oblivious to all he only knew that he felt tired and quite unaccountably he did not wish to continue with the extrasensory perception experiments
they had given him these recent headaches and peculiar lapses of memory he felt sure
today he was glad that his mind was free
once in his room he lay back in the windowless gray and almost revelled in the blankness of his brain
funny since taking up these psych experiments hed thought a hell of a lot about his own mind
before that he had never even known he had one
oh well
it was pleasant and soothing here
closing his eyes he watched the two dancing lines of parallel curlicues two gray curly lines wriggling before his naked brain
two curly lines
what did they remind him of
sally
of course sally curly hair
he sure was forgetful these days why he hadnot seen sally for over a week
mrs johnson the landlady had left a note under his door three days ago saying that sally had called the night he was out somewhere walking off his headache
the poor kid she was worrying about him
why had he neglected her that way that he thought of it thought of gray lines he could not stop
this psych stuff was sure developing his concentration all right
it seemed as though he just had to go and see sally
she would be home now thursday afternoon
her biology lab period was over at eleven on thursdays
he must drop in and surprise her
he had to surprise sally
sally with the curly yellow hair
two curls in back
long golden curls girl
curls
he was already walking down the street turning up
a light misty rain was falling and glancing into the street clinton noticed the treadmarkings caused by the tires of a skidding car
they left two curly lines
he was going to see sally
one block more
the curly lines
they got mixed up with his thoughts of sally
two golden caterpillars on her neck
on her white neck
two curly lines
ring the bell
no one in
open the door her room is in front
curly fringes on the carpet beneath his feet
curly fingers knocking on the door
curly lines of two red lips to kiss
oh harry where have you been worried so curls
on her neck
think about sally not the curls
what are you staring at
you look funny
must feel the curls want to but must think until they are felt think at all
it was only after touching the curls that harry clinton did begin to think
it was then that he remembered everything the death of the priest and the star and the obsessive mingling of sally and the curly lines
clinton thought of all these things because he had been shocked into doing so shocked by gazing down at his own hands clutching curls curls which his hands had wound about her neck and tightly pressed to strangle her to death
clinton knew then
even as he ran through the streets he knew
he could think only too clearly now
he was in the grip of some obsession concerning the five symbols on the extrasensory perception cards
the strain of guessing those symbols with closed eyes day after day for months in a variety of experiments his facility in conjuring up the proper mental images these things had induced some abnormal condition whereby one or more of the symbols now came to his mind without conscious effort to recall any
it was sheer habit to think of a star a cross a curly line a square or a circle
telepathy what was it
what peculiar force in the brain aided him in his guessing
was it a psychic power or an alien intelligence prompting him
whatever the cause the matter had passed all controllable bounds
he was helpless to fend off the power of the symbols for symbols they had become
when preyed upon by the recurring image of the cross he had encountered the priest and some part of his brain had identified the holy man with the cause of his torment
he had killed the priest to erase from his mind the cross symbol
and had not instinct guided him to choose a symbolic weapon
in the vaudeville theater he had seen the star
out of several weapons in her dressingroom he was prompted by the symbolism of the macehead
was he actually guilty of such crimes
or was he a dual personality
some subconscious murdering impulse had guided him very cunningly in the execution of his killings
was he insane
he must have been to kill sally
good god he had killed her
that was why he was running
no one had seen him
her curly hair two curly lines on her neck writhing through his brain he was forced to erase the crawling curly lines from memorj
symbolically he did so with her death
that was another thing
he had not taken the test
merely thinking of sally this last time had caused identification
and there was still the circle and the square to go
would he murder two images of transference because of them
he panted with exhaustion lying on the bed in his room
would he murder two more
what could he do to prevent it to drop psych
that was certain
and keep from anything which might even vaguely be associated with the last two symbols
he could not he fancied play poker any more with the three boys down the hall
they sat at a square table and there were four of them
it might suggest the square
or the chips might suggest the circle
a fat man could evoke the circle image
or even the phrase a squareshooter applied to some man was liable to set him off
yet he needed a squareshooter
he had to tell someone about this
that was the way they did it in psychiatry wasnot it
the old idea of the confessional
whom could he trust
whom could he tell
he would state the case hypothetically of course and get the dope straight
but whom
professor bairn
yes bairn was the logical man
he knew about all this
clinton would have to see him to drop the class anyway
and perhaps bairn knew of a way out
there had to be a way out at once
murders could not continue
he was going crazy
it was all insane and at any minute the torturing images might recur to blot out all thought and sanity
why not go now
clinton rose and walked swiftly out of the room out of the house down the street to the campus square
it was four oclock
he had murdered sally at twothirty
it was an absurd thought
an hour and a half ago he had murdered a woman
now he was going to what was he going to do
oh yes see bairn
good old bairn
he would know a way to help
his classes were over hed be working in his office
the wide office door loomed before him
it was very wide
almost square
clinton walked in
bairn was sitting at the desk his square shoulders hunched over oh no think of squares
hello professor think about the square jaw wanted to talk to you
think of something else quick he doing
oh yes he has the cards out on the desk
why the cards are square
your cards are square professor was he saying
the cards are square
professor cards are square
professor bairn taught me to think of squares
professor bairn will play square with me
professor bairn is a square the matter be afraid professor
professor square no bairn hes afraid backing away
what do i look like
what am i doing backing up to the window
the window think of the window for sake think of anything but professor bairn is a square
think of the window
the window is square
bairn is backed against the open square window
square against square
square accounts
professor i falling
twisting around
twisting why he isnot square any more all crumpled
well
that was easy gone
simple
now to get rid of that damned circle
clinton was almost happy as he slipped out the side entrance
he walked slowly back to the roominghouse even listened to the newsboy on the corner of hale and jefferson shouting about the extra
reedalla bouta moider
collichgoilfoundead
extraaah
he didnot buy a paper
he knew all about the murder
he knew all about lots of murders
but what worried him was that he didnot know about the next murder
there had to be one
there simply had to be one
he must get rid of the circle
then hed be all right again
somehow he realized that these things were not right but it was all necessary
a man couldnot live when his brain was on fire with incomprehensible images
this peculiar power of his this psychic power of guessing correctly it was somehow alien and evil
poor old bairn had he actually realized the full extent of the forces he had tampered with
there was certainly a lot to it he hadnot suspected
must have had his suspicions though when he went out the window
perhaps he knew now
this stuff was all from across the border
clinton didnot know and couldnot control it
funny idea
suppose this was really some extrasensory perception of his this guessing faculty hed developed
suppose it were and that it was not meant for men
something or some one might guard it
or perhaps this faculty merely opened up a new part of the mind in such a way that the old mind was unable to govern or control the actions of its augmented self
there was dark stuff here and clinton didnot want to tamper with it
do the murder get rid of the last image forget about it all erase the circle and be free
whom to the moonfaced husband of mrs johnson the landlady
rogers the kid with the shaved head and the round skull
the circle is the symbol of infinity eternity
all life is a circle
curved space
curved existence
round
round and black
up the stairs around to the room
think deliberately of the circle so that it may provide a key to the way out
release the brain
this would be a planned deliberate murder
why not
there was a gun in the drawer
a gun
clinton took out the gun filled it with round cartridges gazed down the round hole in the muzzle
he was trying hard to think of the person he meant to kill and strangely no thought came although by this time he could see the circle quite plainly in his mind and for the first time he actually rejoiced in the pain
the blazing circle coruscated swirling round and round and round as he looked down the dark round muzzle of the gun
it was then that he heard the sounds from below and the tramp of footsteps on the stairs
sluggishly he realized the truth
they were coming for him
after all four murders he was in a daze must have left many clues
they were coming for him now
but they couldnot come
they couldnot lock him up now
not now when the circle was squeezing tightly around his brain
he must get rid of the circle first find peace
because they would shut him away for the rest of his life in a madhouse and he couldnot stand it there with nothing but the thought of the circle
they were coming up the stairs
who
what
clinton rose and stepped forward wildly gun in hand
the circle of his room
something bright arrested his attention
something bright and round like the circle in his head
he tried to see it
yes
yes
he could see it
it was the mirror the silver circle of the mirror over his bureau
he stared into it
in the silver circle he saw himself his own round head
the knocking on the door came
but clinton stared into the silver circle at his own round head
clinton stared into the dark circle of the gunmuzzle
he put the round muzzle to his round head and looked into the round mirror as though for confirmation
yes it was right
open in the name of the law
he had found the fifth symbol
it was the circle of life back to himself
he was the last symbol
once he erased that he could find peace
harry clinton sent a circular bullet into his circular brain
whatever the source of his extrasensory perception he had guessed right at the end
a novelet of tribal wraiths by the dead are dumb but in the jungle their tongues author of eyes of the serpent etc
all right here we are said major crosby halting
he glanced briefly at the four men who formed his bodyguard and then turned to young henley
now henley he said donot want any interruption from you going to handle this thing myself understand
you know how much influence these native witchdoctors have and its no go angering them needlessly
and a bad one he and his filthy heads
henley flushed beneath his bronze
one of those heads may be all thats left of my brother he said shortly
logoda knows too much to bother an englishman returned the major
my brotjier knew his magic
he knew too much of his magic said henley staring through the bushes toward the squat hut of the witchdoctor logoda
well for sake donot start anything
the major started forward but henley caught his arm
wait major he said
what is it
crosby snapped
talk to him in his own language said henley havenot mastered the native tongue yet returned the major crossly didnot mean that said henley significantly
oh said the major startled for a moment
then he shook his head moodily and strode on across the clearing with henley at his heels
a few natives scattered warily as they came on leaving the door to hut clear
there was a collection of trophies about the entrance some of them were not pleasant to look at
major crosby reflected briefly upon inability to stamp out certain practises
then he turned and curtly ordered his men to stay outside
major crosby lifted the matted doorway and went inside followed by henley
it took them a minute to get used to the darkness
then they saw logoda and the ugly stained heads dried and strung along on poles above the head
major crosby had been in the hut once before not so very long ago there were ten heads then now there were eleven
the additional one in the light of bob disappearance made him uneasy an ungainly hulking man sat on his haunches in a corner
he wore an odd headdress apparently hastily put on at the intimation of visitors but apart from this and a few streaks of none too fresh paint he looked very little different from his fellow natives
yet the man was a very tangible and irritating power to the english stationed at the nearby post
logoda a white man is missing said the major coming directly to the point of his visit
he was known to have come in your direction
a week ago seven days
seven times the sun he came this way
where is he
no white man said logoda serenely
he moved the upper half of his body slightly forward so that his outflung arms came to rest on palms pressed flat against the ground
no white man he said again
logoda crosby replied sternly many men will come to search
they will burn your village they will put you in a room with many bars
surprisingly henley interrupted wasting our time major
i told you to talk to him in his own language
will you let me talk to him
no snapped the major angrily convinced youre needlessly worried no actual proof that your brothers dead and theres once again henley interrupted him going to look at those heads he said and before crosby could stop him he stepped forward
instantly logoda pointed furiously at henley and shouted you go way but henley paid no attention
he stood under the dried heads gazing at them imperturbably mid furious mouthings and major nervous scrutiny
suddenly henley caught his breath and expelled it again with a sharp hissing sound
bob he muttered
major crosby expostulated
now look here henley not had time to dry a head
only a week hardly that
henley looked at him
you are too new here major crosby he said know how quickly they can dry them
there was something about cold stare that stayed angry words on his lips
abruptly logoda crossed his hands before his face bowed his head quickly to the ground and turned toward the dried heads flinging out his arms as if in entreaty to them his palms turned upward toward them
from his mouth issued a stream of weird gibberings
he is talking to the heads said henley softly
do not be surprised if they answer
you donot actually believe in this torn foolery henley demanded the major incredulously
yes said henley simply do
bob and i have studied it a long time
there is more in it than you think gibbering quickly ceased
for a moment there was complete silence
the major was about to stalk out disgusted then there sounded as if from far away a shrill strange tittering it grew it mounted until it sounded all about them and then it subsided it subsided into a subdued whispering which was lost gradually lost in silence again
above them heads were the majors skepticism was shaken and he was trying not to show it
will you do me this favor major
i will not bother you again on my honor
i want to talk to heads and i do not want him to hear what i say to them
the simplicity with which this request was uttered was in strange contrast to the wierdness of its content
the major swallowed with some difficulty and asked in a thick voice will you go after that
yes go then replied henley
coming in the a complete novelet of supernatural powers by swaying back and forth though no one had touched them
good god whispered the major
major said henley in a strong voice will you take logoda out of the hut for a minute or two
i want to be alone here sat smiling to himself his eyes hslfclosed rocking back and forth a little like a drowsy joss
but i thought you promised stammered the major
nothing will be disturbed i promise you
logoda will have no cause for complaint
but then why must he go out
very well
the major stepped to the doorway and signalled to two of his men knowing they would be needed to move logoda who would certainly not go of his own volition
despite his furious protests logoda was dragged to the doorway where he rose and walked so that his natives might not see this indignity being visited on him
henley was left alone in the hut and his whispering voice drifted eerily to major crosby and his men who looked questioningly at each other
henley was speaking in a native tongue
only a few minutes elapsed
then henley stepped from the hut his eyes glittering strangely and logoda after glaring at him in murderous fury entered his home again ready now major said henleyvery well said the major in a low voice
the five men made their long way back to the english post where they arrived just in time for suppsr
for a long time henley and the major did not speak to each other but over coffee at last henley spoke
how much would you people give to be rid of logoda he asked softly
major crosby was startled but resolved not to show it good deal i think
but if youre planning to go back there to get him stop now
we could have potted him a long time ago but for an englishman to be seen anywhere around when a witchdoctor dies suspiciously is certain to cause an insurrection and a nasty one
will you guarantee me passage to the coast pursed henley told you it was impossible henley
i need all my men here anyway didnot mean protection i meant money
i have money waiting for me in cairo but thats a hellish long way off
i want to get there and i havenot enough money
oh said the major softening had no idea
well you donot have to earn it he went on smiling now glad to be able to help you out
and get rid of me murmured henley smiling too
but theres one more favor i want to ask of you before i leave
and that asked the major apprehensively want you to tie me to my cot tonight and set a guard over me said henley grimly
what an extraordinary request exclaimed major crosby
nevertheless an earnestly meant one
will you major
well if you insist
and will you go then in the morning
yes feel very odd about this said the major some hours later as he sat beside the cot to which henley had been tied
you neednot said henley shortly just protecting myself afraid of me
he isnot afraid of you if youll forgive my saying it
he knows i know too much
bob did too and a dried head now
i have decided i donot want to die and there are so many ways of bringing about my death for a man like logoda
he could call me and i would have to follow
or he could come himself maybe a little white dog or a snake almost anything the why of all this you see
really henley said the major somewhat stiffly talking like the most impossible madman
i find it difficult to believe that youre the same man who has been so sane in my company the previous weeks
yes i understand that said henley know how you feel
i am sorry to disturb the waters like that
most of us like them smooth
but there are things like this and they do happen
bob and i have studied them too long to deny them
you donot have to believe them youd probably be better off without knowing anything about them made that laughter this ww afternoon and who made those heads sway like that asked the major curiously and obviously against his will told you logoda spoke to them and they answered not telling me a thing replied the major
perhaps not the only answer though
now forgive me got a long journey ahead of me and got to get some sleep
in the morning henley awoke to find the major bending over him untying the ropes that bound him
good morning henley said
hope you slept well
thanks said the major smiling didnot
did anyone call for me in the night asked henley his voice grim
no one
i watched for dogs and snakes and things and even considered potting a couple of birds that got lost in the clearing
good old major
thanks
i think it was too late for logoda to send for me suppose youll be leaving directly after breakfast asked the major then am expecting a message and as soon as it comes be on my way
from whom asked major crosby bluntly
that i canot say
but you have scouts out havenot you
of course said crosby shortly
henley smiled were at breakfast when one of the majors scouts came dodging out into the clearing
he was excited and breathless from the exertion of running my message i think said henley calmly
how about my passage money major
the scout came up to them dead he said jerkily been killed killed echoed the major
good god
i hope there werenot any englishmen around it happen
the natives say his magic killed him a queer business sir
his guards didnot see anyone enter the hut or anyone come out
they heard logoda talking to his heads and they heard the heads answer
then they heard him cough once or twice and finally he slept
that was all
this morning he was found in his hut with his throat torn out terribly mutilated cut and torn as if by thousands of rats
go back and find out whatever else you can ordered major crosby
the scout disappeared at once into the jungle
crosby turned to henley
you were on the bed all night henley
i know
and you guessed logoda would be killed
who did it the question came angrily did said henley simply
major crosby flushed
nonsense he snapped
henley stood up smiling
yet his voice was grim told you it wasnot good to know about forbidden things
but tell you
you heard logoda and those heads and you will recall my insistence on being left alone with them
logoda knew how to make them talk and sway back and forth knew how to make them rend and tear

his sunken eyes beneath their snowy penthouse brows dwelt on the far distance where a forest swept up into the mountain slopes and faded into blue haze
his voice came thin piercing
wo wo unto sardopolis fallen is jewel of gobi fallen and lost forever and all its glory gone
desecration shall come to the altars and the streets shall run red with blood
i see death for the king and shame for his people
for a time the soldiers beneath the wall had been silent but now spears lifted they interrupted with a torrent of halfamused mockery
a bearded giant roared come down to us old goat welcome you indeed prophets eyes dropped and the shouting of the soldiers faded into stillness
very softly the ancient spoke yet each word was clear and distinct as a swordblade
ye shall ride through the streets of the city in triumph
and your king shall mount the silver throne
yet from the forest shall come your doom an old doom shall come down upon you and none shall escape
he shall return he the mighty one who dwelt here once
the prophet lifted his arms staring straight into the red eye of the rising sun
evoke
evohe
then he stepped forward
two steps and plunged
straight down his beard and robe streaming up till the upthrust spears caught him and he died
and that day the gates of sardopolis were burst in by giant batteringrams and like an unleashed flood the men of cyaxares poured into the city wolves who slew and plundered and tortured mercilessly
terror walked that day and a haze of battle hung upon the roofs
the defenders were hunted down and slaughtered in the streets without mercy
women were outraged their children impaled and the glory of sardopolis faded in a smoke of shame and horror
the last glow of the setting sun touched the scarlet wyvern of cyaxares floating from the tallest tower of the kings palace
flambeaux were lighted in their sockets till the great hall blazed with a red fire reflected from the silver throne where the invader sat
his black beard was all bespattered with blood and grime and slaves groomed him as he sat among his men gnawing on a muttonbone
yet despite the mans gashed and broken armor and the filth that besmeared him there was something unmistakably regal about his bearing
a kings son was cyaxares the last of a line that had sprung from the dawn ages of gobi when the feudal barons had reigned
but his face was a tragic ruin
strength and power and nobility had once dwelt there and traces of them still could be seen as though in muddy water through the mask of cruelty and vice that lay heavy upon cyaxares
his gray eyes held a cold and passionless stare that vanished only in the crimson blaze of battle and now those deadly eyes dwelt on the bound form of the conquered king of sardopolis chalem
in contrast with the huge figure of cyaxares chalem seemed slight yet despite his wounds he stood stiffly upright no trace of expression on his pale face
a strange contrast
the marbled tapestried throneroom of the palace was more suitable to gay pageantry than this grim scene
the only man who did not seem incongruously out of place stood beside the throne a slim dark youth clad in silks and velvets that had apparently not been marred by the battle
this was necho the kings confidant and some said his familiar demon
whence he had come no one knew but of his evil power over cyaxares there was no doubt a little smile grew on the youths handsome face
smoothing his curled dark hair he leaned close and whispered to the king
the latter nodded waved away a maiden who was oiling his beard and said shortly your power is broken chalem yet are we merciful
render homage and you may have your life
for answer chalem spat upon the marble flags at his feet
a curious gleam came into cyaxares eyes
half inaudibly he murmured brave man
too brave to die
some impulse seemed to pull his head around until he met gaze
a message passed in that si lent staring
for cyaxares took from his side a long bloodstained sword he rose stepped down from his dais and swung the brand made no move to evade the blow
the steel cut through bone and brain
as the dead man fell cyaxares stood looking down without a trace of expression
he wrenched his sword free
fling this carrion to the vultures he commanded
from the group of prisoners near by came an angry oath
the king turned to face the man who had dared to speak
he gestured
a pair of guards pushed forward a tall wellmuscled figure yellowhaired with a face strong despite its youth now darkened with rage
the man wore no armor and his torso was crisscrossed with wounds
who are you
cyaxares asked with ominous restraint the sword bare in his hand
king son prince raynor
you seek death
raynor shrugged
death has come close to me today
slay me if you will butchered about a dozen of your wolves anyway and thats some satisfaction
behind cyaxares came a rustle of silks as necho moved slightly
the kings lips twitched beneath the shaggy beard
his face was suddenly hard and cruel again
so
well you will crawl to my feet before the next sun sets
he gestured
no doubt there are torture vaults beneath the palace
sudrach a brawny leather clad man stepped forward and saluted
you have heard my will
see to it
if i crawl to your feet raynor said quietly be to hamstring you bloated toad
the king drew in his breath with an angry sound
without another word he nodded to sudrach and the torturer followed raynor as he was conducted out
then cyaxares went back to his throne and mused for a time till a slave brought him wine in a gilded chalice
but the liquor had no power to break his dark mood
at last he rose and went to the dead kings apartments which the invaders had not dared to plunder for fear of cyaxares wrath
above the silken couch a gleaming image hung from its standard the scarlet wyvern wings spread barbed tail stiffly upright
cyaxares stood silently staring at it for a space
he did not turn when he heard soft voice
the youth said the wyvern has conquered once again
aye cyaxares said dully
once again through vileness and black shame
it was an evil day when we met necho
low laughter came
yet you summoned me as i remember
i was content enough in my own place till you sent your summons
involuntarily the king shuddered would ishtar had sent down her lightnings upon me that night
ishtar
you worship another god now
cyaxares swung about snarling
necho do not push me too far i have still some power you have all power the low voice said
as you wished
for a dozen heartbeats the king made no answer
then he whispered am the first to bring shame upon our royal blood
when i was crowned i swore many a vow on the tombs of my fathers and for a time i kept those vows
i ruled with truth and chivalry and you sought wisdom
aye
i was not content
i sought to make my name great and to that end i talked with sorcerers with bleys of the dark pool
bleys necho murmured
he was learned in his way
yet he died
the kings breathing was unsteady know
i slew him at your command
and you showed me what happened thereafter
bleys is not happy now necho said softly
he served the same master as you
wherefore the quiet voice grew imperious
wherefore live
for by our bargain i shall give you all power on earth fair women and treasure beyond imagination
but when you die you shall serve me
the other stood silent while veins swelled on his swarthy forehead
suddenly with a bellowing inarticulate oath he snatched up his sword
bright steel flamed through the air and rebounded clashing
up the kings arm and through all his body raced a tingling shock and simultaneously the regal apartment seemed to darken around him
the fires of the flambeaux darkened
the air was chill and it whispered
steadily the room grew blacker
now all was midnight black save for a shining figure that stood immobile blazing with weird and unearthly radiance
little murmurs rustled through the deadly stillness
the body of necho shone brighter blindingly
and he stood without moving or speaking till the king shrank with a shuddering cry his blade clattering on the marble
no he half sobbed
for his mercy no
he has no mercy the low voice came bleak and chill
therefore worship me dog whom men call king
worship me
and cyaxares worshiped
blood in the city was acutely uncomfortable
he was stretched upon a rack staring up at the dripping stones of the vaults roof and sudrach the torturer was heating iron bars on the hearth
a great cup of wine stood nearby and occasionally sudrach humming under his breath would reach for it and gulp noisily thousand pieces of gold if you help me escape raynor repeated without much hope
what good is gord to a flayed man
sudrach asked
that would be my fate if you escaped
also where would you get a thousand golden pieces
in my apartment raynor said
safely hidden
you may be lying
at any rate youll tell me where this hiding place is when i burn out your eyes
thus have the gold if it exists without danger to myself
raynor made no answer but instead tugged at the cords that bound him
they did not give
yet raynor strained until blood throbbed in his temples and was no closer to freedom when he relaxed at last but wear yourself out sudrach said over his shoulder
best save your strength need it for screaming
he took an iron bar from the fire
its end glowed redly and raynor watched the implement with fascinated horror
an unpleasant way to die
but as the glowing bar approached chest there came an interruption
the iron door was flung open and a tall hugemuscled black entered
sudrach turned involuntarily lifting the bar as a weapon
then he relaxed his eyes questioning
who the devil are you he grunted
eblik the nubian said the black bowing bear a message from the king
i lost my way in this damned palace and just now blundered to my goal
the king has two more prisoners for your hands
good
sudrach rubbed his hands
where are they
in the the other stepped closer
he fumbled in his belt
then abruptly a bloodreddened dagger flashed up and sheathed itself in flesh
sudraoh bellowed thrust out clawing hands
he doubled up slowly while his attacker leaped free and then he collapsed upon the dank stones and lay silent twitching a little
the gods be praised
raynor grunted
eblik faithful servant you come in time dark gargoylish face was worried
let me he slashed the cords that bound the prisoner
it wasnot easy
when we were separated in the battle master i knew sardopolis would fall
i changed clothes with one of cyaxares men whom i slew and waited my chance to escape
it was by the merest luck that i heard you had offended the king and were to be tortured
so he shrugged
raynor free at last sprang up from the rack stretching his stiffened muscles
will it be easy to escape perhaps
many are drunk or asleep
at any rate we canot stay here
the two slipped cautiously out into the corridor
a guard lay dead weltering in his blood not far away
they hurried past him and silently threaded their way through the palace more than once dodging into passages to evade detection
if i knew where cyaxares slept take my chances on slitting his throat raynor said
wait
this way at the end of a narrow hall was a door which pushed open showed a moonlit expanse of garden
eblik said remember i entered this way
here he dived into a bush and presently emerged with a sword and a heavy battleax the latter he thrust in his girdle
what now
over the wall raynor said and led the way
the high rampart was not easy to scale but a spreading tree grew close to it and eventually the two had surmounted the barrier
as raynor dropped lightly to the ground he heard a sudden cry and glancing around saw a group of men armor gleaming in the moonlight racing toward him
he cursed softly
eblik was already fleeing his long legs covering the yards with amazing speed
raynor followed though his first impulse was to wait and give battle
but in the stronghold of cyaxares such an action would have been suicidal
behind the pair the pursuers bayed menace
swords came out flashing
raynor clutched his comrades arm dragged him into a side alley and the two sped on frantically searching for a hidingplace
it was eblik who found sanctuary five minutes later
passing the bloodsmeared corpselittered courtyard of a temple he gasped a hasty word and in a moment both raynor and eblik were across the moonlit stretch and fleeing into the interior of the temple
from a high roof hung a golden ball dim in the gloom
this was the sacred house of the sun the dwelling place of the primal god ahmon
eblik had been here before and knew the way
he guided raynor past torn tapestries and overthrown censers and then halting before a golden curtain he listened
there was no sound of pursuit
good the nubian warrior said heard of a secret way out of here though where it is i donot know
maybe we can find it drew the curtain aside and the two entered the sanctuary of the god
involuntarily raynor whispered a curse and his brown fingers tightened on his rapier hilt
a small chamber faced them with walls and floor and ceiling blue as the summer sky
it was empty save for a single huge sphere of gold in the center
broken upon the gleaming ball was a man
from the wall a single flambeau cast a flickering radiance on the twisted bloodstained body on the white beard that was dappled with blood
the man lay stretched across the globe his hands and feet impaled with iron spikes that had been driven deeply into the gold
froth bubbled on his lips
his hoary head rolled eyes stared unseeingly
he gasped water
for the love of ahmon a drop of water lips were a hard white line as he sprang forward
eblik helped him as he pried the spikes free
the tortured priest moaned and bit at his mangled lips but made no outcry
presently he lay prostrate on the blue floor
with a muttered word eblik disappeared and came back bearing a cup which he held to the dying mans mouth
the priest drank deeply
he whispered prince raynor
is the king safe
swiftly raynor answered
the others white head rolled
lift me up swiftly
raynor obeyed
the priest ran his hands over the golden sphere and suddenly beneath his probing fingers it split in half like a cloven fruit and in its center a gap widened
a steep staircase led down into hidden depths
the altar is open
i cannot see take me down there
they cannot find us in the hidden chamber
raynor swung the priest to his shoulders and without hesitation started down the steps eblik behind him
there was a low grating as the altar swung back a gleaming sphere that would halt and baffle pursuit
they were in utter darkness
the prince moved cautiously testing each step before he shifted his weight
at last he felt the floor level beneath his feet a dim light began to grow like the first glow of dawn
it revealedi a bare stone vault roughly constructed of mortised stones strangely at variance with the palatial city above
in one wall a dark hole showed
on the floor was a circular disk of metal its center hollowed out into a cup
within this cup lay a broken shard of some rock that resembled goldshot marble half as large as hand
on the shard were carved certain symbols the prince did not recognize and one that he did the ancient looped cross sacred to the sungod
he put the priest down gently but nevertheless the man moaned in agony
the maimed hands clutched at air
ahmon
great ahmon give me more water
eblik obeyed
strengthened the priest fumbled for and gripped arm
you are strong
good
strength is needed for the mission you must undertake
mission
the priests fingers tightened
aye ahmon guided your steps hither
you must be the messenger of vengeance
not i have not long to live
my strength ebbs
he was silent for a time and then resumed have a tale to tell you
do you know the legend of the founding of sardopolis
how long ago a very terrible god had his altar in this spot and was served by all the forest dwellers till those who served ahmon came
they fought and prisoned the forest god drove him hence to the valley of silence and he lies bound there by strong magic and the seal of ahmon
yet there was a prophecy that one day ahmon would be overthrown and the bound god would break his fetters and return to his first dwelling place to the ruin of sardopolis
the day of the prophecy is at hand
the priest pointed
all is dark
yet the seal should be there is it not
raynor said bit of marble aye the talisman
lift it up
the voice was now peremptory
raynor obeyed have it
good
guard it well
lift the disk now
almost apprehensively the prince tugged the disk up finding it curiously light
beneath was nothing but a jagged stone crudely carved with archaic figures and symbols
a stone yet raynor knew somehow that the thing was horribly old that it had existed from the dawn ages of gobi
the altar of the forest god said the priest
he will return to this spot when he is freed
you must go to the reaver of the rock and give him the talisman
he will know its meaning
so shall ahmon be avenged upon the tyrant
suddenly the priest surged upright his arms lifted tears streaming from the blind eyes
he cried ohe ohi
fallen forever is the house of ahmon
fallen to the dust
he fell as a tree falls crashing down upon the stones his arms still extended as though in worship
so died the last priest of ahmon in gobi
raynor did not move for a while
then he bent over the lax body
a hasty examination showed him that the man was dead and shrugging he thrust the marble shard into his belt suppose thats the way out he said pointing to the gap in the wall though i donot like the look of it
well come on
he squeezed himself into the narrow hole cursing softly and eblik followed
the reaver of the rock slow steps cyaxares paced his apartment his shaggy brows drawn together in a frown
once or twice his hand closed convulsively on his swordhilt and again the secret agony within him made him groan aloud
but not once did he glance at the scarlet symbol of the wyvern that hung above his couch
going to a window he looked down over the city and then his gaze went out to the plain and the distant forested mountains
he sighed heavily
a voice said you may well look there cyaxares
for there is your doom unless you act swiftly
is it you necho the king asked heavily
what new shamefulness must i work now
two men go south to the valley of silence
they must be slain ere they reach it
why
what aid can they get there
nccho did not answer at first
his voice was hesitant when he said the gods have their own secrets
there is something in the valley of silence that can send all your glory and power crashing down about your head
nor can i aid you then
i can only advise you now and if you follow my advice well
but act i cannot and must not for a reason which you need not know
send out your men therefore with orders to overtake those two and slay them swiftly as you will the king said and turned to summon a servitor follow us eblik said shading his eyes with a calloused hand
he was astride a rangy dun mare and beside him raynor rede on a great gray charger red of nostril and fiery of eye
the latter turned in the saddle and looked back
by the gods he observed
cyaxares has sent half an army after us lucky we managed to steal these mounts
the two had reined their horses at the summit of a low rise in the forest
back of them the ground sloped to the great plain and the gutted city of 
sardopolis before them jagged mountains rose covered with oak and pine and fir
the nubian licked dry lips said thirstily the fires of all hells are in my belly get out of this wilderness where theres nothing to drink but water
the reaver may feed you wine or blood raynor said nevertheless our best chance is to find this reaver and seek his aid
a mercenary once told me of the road
he clapped his heels against the chargers flanks and the steed bounded forward
in a moment the ridge had hidden them from the men of cyaxares
so the two penetrated deeper and deeper into the craggy desolate wilderness a place haunted by wolves and great bears and men whispered monstrous snakelike cockadrills
they went by snowpeaked mountains that lifted white cones to the blue sky and they fled along the brink of deep gorges from which the low thunder of cataracts rose tumultuously
and always behind them rode the pursuers a grim and warlike company following slowly but relentlessly
but raynor used more than one stratagem
thrice he guided his charger up streams along which the wise animal picked its way carefully again he dislodged an avalanche to block the trail
so it came about that when the two rode down into a great grassy basin the men of cyaxares were far behind
on all sides the mountains rose
ahead was a broad meadowlike valley strewn with thickets and green groves
far ahead the precipice rose in a tall rampart split in one place into a narrow canyon
to the right of the gorge lifted a great gray rock mountainhuge bare save for a winding trail that twisted up its surface to a castle upon the summit
dwarfed by distance the size of the huge structure could yet be appreciated a castle of stone incongruously bedecked with fluttering bright banners and pennons
raynor pointed
he dwells there
the reaver of the rock
and here comes danger eblik said whipping out his battleax
look
from a grove of nearby trees burst a company of horsemen glittering in the afternoon sunlight spears lifted casques and helms agleam
shouting they rode down upon the waiting pair
raynor fingered his swordhilt hesitating
put up your blade he directed eblik
we come in friendship here
the nubian was doubtful
but do they know that
nevertheless he sheathed his sword and waited till the dozen riders reined in a few paces away
one spurred forward a tall man astride a wiry black
are you tired of life that you seek the stronghold he demanded
or do you mean to enter in his service
we bear a message raynor countered message from a priest of ahmon
we know no gods here the other grunted
well you know warfare or misread the dents in your armor raynor snapped
sardopolis is fallen
cyaxares has taken the city and slain the king my father chalem of sardopolis his amazement a bellow of laughter burst from the troop
the spokesman said what has that to do with us
we own no king but the reaver
yet you shall come safely before him if that is your will
it were shameful to battle a dozen to two and the rags you wear arenot worth the taking
eblik started like a ruffled peacock
by the gods you have little courtesy here
for a coin slit your weasand
the other rubbed his throat reflectively grinning
you may have a trial at that later if you wish my ragged gargoyle
but come now for the reaver is in hall and tonight he rides forth on a raid
with a nod raynor spurred his horse forward the nubian at his side and surrounded by the men of the reaver they fled across the valley to the castle
thence they mounted the steep dangerous path up the craggy ramp till at last they crossed a drawbridge and dismounted in a courtyard
so they took raynor before the reaver of the rock
a great shining redcheeked man he was with grizzled gray beard and a crown set rakishly askew on tangled locks
he sat before a blazing fire in a highroofed stone hall an iron chest open at his feet
from this he was taking jewels and golden chains and ornaments that might have graced a kings treasury examining them carefully and making notes with a quill pen upon a parchment on his lap
he looked up merry eyes dwelt on flushed face and touseled yellow hair
well samar what is it now
two strangers
they have a message for you or so they say
suddenly the face changed
he leaned forward spilling treasure from his lap message
now there is only one message that can ever come to me speak you
who sent you stepped forward confidently
from his belt he drew the broken shard of marble and extended it priest of ahmon bade me give you this he said
sardopolis is fallen
for a heartbeat there was silence
then the reaver took the shard examining it carefully
he murmured aye
so my rule passes
for long and long my fathers held the rock waiting for the summons that never came
and now it has come
he looked up
go all of you save you two
and you samar wait for you should know of this
the others departed
the reaver shouted after them summon delphia
he turned to stare into the fire
so kialeh must fulfill the ancient pledge of my ancestors
and invaders are on my marches
well there came an interruption
a girl strode in dark head proudly erect slim figure corseted in dinted armor
she went to the reaver flung a blazing jewel in his lap
is this my guerdon she snarled faith o the gods i took castle almost singlehanded
and my share is less than the share of samar here
you are my daughter the reaver said quietly
shall i give you more honor then in our free brotherhood
be silent
listen
raynor was examining the girls face with approval
there was beauty there wild dark lawless beauty and strength that showed in the firm set of the jaw and the latent fire of the jet eyes
ebony hair unbound fell in ringlets about steelcorseleted shoulders
the girl said well
have you had your fill of staring
let be the reaver grunted have a tale for all of you listen
his deep voice grew stronger
ages on ages ago this was a barbarous land
the people worshipped a forestgod called his hand moved in a queer quick sign called pan
then from the north came two kings brothers bringing with them the power of the sungod ahmon
there was battle in the land then and blood and reddened steel
yet ahmon conquered
the forestgod was bound within the valley of silence which lies beyond my castle
the two kings made an agreement
one was to rule sardopolis and the other the younger was to rear a great castle at the gateway of the valley of silence and guard the fettered god
until a certain word should come
the reaver weighed a glittering stone in his hand
for there was a prophecy that one day the rule of ahmon should be broken
then it was foretold that the forestgod should be freed and should bring vengeance upon the destroyers of sardopolis
for long and long my ancestors have guarded the rock and kialeh am the last
ah he sighed
the great days are over indeed
never again will the reaver ride to rob and plunder and mock at gods
never whats this
a had burst into the hall eyes alight face fierce as a wolfs
kialeh
an army is in the valley by shaitan
raynor cursed
cyaxares men
they pursued us the girl delphia swung about
gather the men take command suddenly the reaver let out a roaring shout
no
by all the gods flouted no
would you grudge me my last battle girl
gather your men samar but i command
samar sprang to obey
delphia gripped her fathers arm fight with you then have another task for you
guide these two through the valley of silence to the place you know
here he thrust the marble shard at the prince
take this
i know how to use it when the time comes
then he was gone and curtains of black samite swayed into place behind him
raynor was curiously eying the girl
her face was pale beneath its tan and her eyes betrayed fear
red battle she could face unflinchingly but the thought of entering the valley of silence meant to her something far more terrible
yet she said come
we have little time
eblik followed raynor and delphia from the hall
they went through the harsh splendor of the castle till at last the girl halted before a blank stone wall
she pressed a hidden spring
a section of the rock swung away revealing the dimlit depths of a passage
delphia paused on the threshold
her dark eyes flickered over the two
hold fast to your courage she whispered and her hps were trembling
for now we go down into the valley of silence at first there seemed nothing terrible about the valley
they entered it from a cavern that opened on a thick forest and glancing around raynor saw tall mountainous ramparts that made the place a prison indeed
it was past sunset yet already a full moon was rising over the eastern cliffs outlining the castle in black silhouette
they entered the forest
moss underfoot deadened their footsteps
they walked in dim gloom broken by moonlit traceries filtered through the leaves
and now raynor noted the curious stillness that hung over all
there was no sound
the noise of birds and beasts did not exist here nor did the breath of wind rustle the silent trees
but queerly the prince thought there was a sound whispering through the forest a sound below the threshold of hearing which nevertheless played on his taut nerves donot like this eblik said his ugly face set and strained
his voice seemed to die away with uncanny swiftness
pan is fettered here delphia whispered
yet is his power manifest
soundlessly they went through the soundless forest
and now raynor realized that slowly and imperceptibly the shadowy whisper he had sensed was growing louder or else his ears were becoming more attuned to it
a very dim murmur faint and far away which yet seemed to have within it a multitude of voices
the voices of the winds the murmur of forests the goblin laughter of shadowed brooks
it was louder now and raynor found himself thinking of all the innumerable sounds of the primeval wilderness and the call of beasts
and under all a dim powerful motif beat a wordless shrilling a faint piping that set the princes skin to crawling as he heard it
it is the tide of life delphia said softly
the heartbeat of the first god
the pulse of earth
for the first time raynor felt something of the primal secrets of the world
often he had walked alone in the forest but never yet had the hidden heart of the wilderness reached fingers into his soul
he sensed a mighty and very terrible power stirring latent in the soil beneath him a thing bound inextricably to the brain of man by the cords of the flesh which came up by slow degrees from the seething oceans which once rolled unchecked over a young planet
unimaginable eons ago man had come from the earth and the brand of his motherworld was burned deep within his soul
afraid yet strangely happy as men are sometimes happy in their dreams the prince motioned for his companions to increase their pace
the forest gave place to a wide clearing with shattered white stones rearing to the sky
broken plinths and peristyles gleamed in the moonlight
a temple had once existed here
now all was overgrown with moss and the slowcreeping lichen
here the girl said in a low whisper
here
in the center of a ring of fallen pillars they halted
delphia pointed to a block of marble on which a metal disk was inset
in a cuplike depression in the metal lay a broken bit of marble
the talisman delphia said
touch it to the other
silence and the unearthly tide of hidden life swelling and ebbing all about them
raynor took the amulet from his belt stepped forward fighting down his fear
he bent above the disk touched marble shard to marble as iron to lodes tone the two fragments drew together
they coalesced into one
the jagged line of breakage faded and vanished
raynor held the talisman complete unbroken
now quite suddenly the vague murmurings mounted into a roar gay jubilant triumphant
the metal disk shattered into fragments
beneath it the prince glimpsed a small carved stone the twin of the one beneath the temple of ahmon
above the unceasing roar sounded a penetrating shrill piping
delphia clutched at raynor arm pulled him back
her face was chalkwhite
the pipes she gasped
back quickly
to see pan is to die
louder the roar mounted and louder
in its bellow was a deep shout of alien laughter a thunder of goblin merriment
the chuckle of the shadowed brooks was the crash of cataracts and waterfalls
the forest stirred to a breath of gusty wind
back the girl said urgently
back
we have freed pan without conscious thought raynor thrust the talisman into his belt turned and with delphia and eblik beside him fled into the moonlit shadows
above him branches tossed in a mounting wind
the wild shrieking of the pipes grew louder
tide of earth life rising to a mad paean of triumph
the wind exulted free free
and the unseen rivers shouted great pan is free of hoofs came from the distance
bleating calls sounded from afar
the girl stumbled almost fell
raynor gripped at her arm pulling her upright fighting the unreasoning terror mounting within him
the grim face was glistening with sweat
pan pan is free
evohe
the black mouth of a cavern loomed before them
at its threshold raynor cast a glance behind him saw all the great forest swaying and tossing
his breath coming unevenly he turned following his companions into the cave
shaitan he whispered
what demon have i loosed on the land
then it was race sprint pound up the winding passage up an unending flight of stone steps through a wall that lifted at touch and into a castle shaking with battle
raynor stopped short whipping out his sword staring at shadows flickering in the distance
cyaxares men he said entered
in the face of antagonists the prince was suddenly himself again
delphia was already running down the corridor blade out
raynor and the nubian followed
they burst into the great hall
a ring of armed men surrounded a little group who were making their last stand before the hearth
towering above the others raynor saw the tangled locks and bristling beard of kialeh the reaver and beside him his lieutenant samar
corpses littered the floor
ho roared the reaver as he caught sight of the newcomers
you come in time
in time to die with us
cursed be the city laughter touched lips
he drove in sheathing his sword in a brawny throat whipped it out steel singing
nor were eblik and delphi a far behind
her blade and the ax wreaked deadly havoc among cyaxares soldiers who not expecting attack from the rear were confused
the hall became filled with a milling yelling throng from which one soldier a burly giant emerged shouting down the others
cut them down but three
then all semblance of sanity was lost in a blaze of crimson battle swinging brands and huge maces that crashed down splitting skulls and spattering gray brainstuff
delphia kept shoulder to shoulder with raynor seemingly heedless of danger her blade flicking wasplike through the air
and the prince guarded her as best he could the sword weaving a bright maze of deadly lightnings as it whirled
the reaver swung and his sword crushed a helm and bit deep into bone
he strained to tug it free and a soldier thrust up at his throat
samar deflected the blade with his own weapon and that cost him his life
in that moment of inattention a driven spear smashed through corselet and jerkin and drank deep of the mans lifeblood
silent he fell
the reaver went beserk
yelling he sprang over his lieutenants corpse and swung
for a few moments he held back his enemies and then someone flung a shield
instinctively kialeh lifted his blade to parry
the wolves leaped in to the kill
roaring the reaver went down blood gushing through his shaggy beard staining its irongray with red
when raynor had time to look again kialeh lay a corpse on his own hearth his head amid bright jewels that had spilled from the overturned treasurechest
the three stood together now the last of the defenders raynor and eblik and delphia
the soldiers ringed them panting for their death yet hesitating before the menace of cold steel
none wished to be the first to die
and as they waited a little silence fell
the prince heard a sound he remembered
dim and far away a low roaring drifted to his ears
and the eerie shrilling of pipes
it grew louder
the soldiers heard it now
they glanced at one another askance
there was something about that sound that chilled the blood
it swelled to a gleeful shouting filling all the castle
a breeze blew through the hall tugging with elfin fingers at sweatmoist skin
it rose to a gusty blast
in its murmur voices whispered
evohe
evohe they grew louder mad and unchecked
they exulted
pan pan is free
gods a soldier cursed
what devils work is this
he swung about sword ready
the curtains of samite were ripped away by the shrieking wind
deafeningly the voices exulted pan is free
the piping shrilled out
there came the clatter of ringing little hoofs
the castle rocked and shuddered
some vague indefinable impulse made raynor snatch at his belt gripping the talisman in bronzed fingers
from it a grateful warmth seemed to flow into his flesh and the roaring faded
he dragged delphia and the nubian behind him
close to me stay close
the room was darkening
no it seemed as though a cloudy veil of mist dropped before the three guarding them
raynor lifted the seal of ahmon
the fogveils swirled
dimly through them raynor could see the soldiers moving swiftly frantically like rats caught in a trap
he tightened one arm about steelarmored waist
suddenly the hall was icecold
the castle shook as though gripped by titan hands
the floor swayed beneath the princes feet
the mists darkened
through rifts he saw halfguessed figures that leaped and bounded heard elfin hoofs clicking
horned and shaggyfurred beings that cried jubilantly as they danced to the pipes of pan
faun and dryad and satyr swung in a mad saraband beyond the shrouding mists
faintly there came the screaming of men half drowned in the loud shrilling
evohe the demoniac rout thundered
evohe
all hail pan
with a queer certainty raynor knew that it was time to leave the castle and swiftly
already the great stone structure was shaking like a tree in a hurricane
with a word to his companions he stepped forward hesitantly the talisman held high
the walls of mist moved with him
outside the fogwalls the monstrous figures gamboled
but the soldiers of cyaxares screamed no more
through a castle toppling into ruin the three sped into the courtyard across the drawbridge and down the face of the rock
nor did they pause till they were safely in the broad plain of the valley
the castle
eblik barked pointing
see
it falls
and it was true
down it came thundering while clouds of ruin spurted up
then there was only a shattered wreck on the summit of the rock
delphia caught her breath in a little sob
she murmured the end of the reavers for all time
i i lived in the castle for more than twenty years
and now its gone like a puff of dust before the wind
the walls of fog had vanished
raynor returned the talisman to his belt
eblik staring up at the rock swallowed uneasily
well what now he asked
back along the way we came the prince said the only way out of this wilderness that i know of
the girl nodded
yes
beyond the mountains lie deserts save toward sardopolis
but we have no mounts
then well walk eblik observed but raynor caught his arm and pointed
there horses probably stampeded from the castle
and shaitan my gray charger
good so presently the three rode toward sardopolis conscious of a wierd dim throbbing that seemed to pulse in the air all about them dawn they topped a ridge and saw before them the plain
all three reined in their mounts staring
beneath them lay the city but changed it was a ruin
doom had come to sardopolis in the night
the mighty towers and battlements had fallen and huge gaps were opened in the walls
of the kings palace nothing was left but a single tower from which ironically the wyvern banner flew
as they watched that pinnacle too swayed and tottered and fell and the scarlet wyvern drifted down into the dust of sardopolis
on fallen towers and peristyles distant figures moved with odd ungainly boundings
quickly raynor turned his eyes away
but he could not shut his ears to the distant crying of pipes gay and pagan yet with a faintly mournful undertone
pan has returned to his first altar delphia said quietly
we had best not loiter here
by all hell i agree the nubian grunted digging his heels into his steeds flanks
where now raynor
westward i think to the sea of shadows
there are cities on its shore and galleys to take us to a haven
unless he turned questioning eyes on delphia
she laughed a little bitterly cannot stay here
the land is sunk back into the pit
pan rules
i go with you
the three rode to the west
they skirted but did not enter a small grove where a man lay in agony
it was cyaxares a figure so dreadfully mangled that only sheer will kept him alive
his face was a bloody mask
the oncerich garments were tattered and filthy
he saw the three riders and raised his voice in a weak cry which the wind drowned
beside the king a slim youthful figure lounged leaning idly against an oaktrunk
it was necho
call louder cyaxares he said
with a horse under you you can reach the sea of shadows
and if you succeed in doing that you will yet live for many years
again the king cried out
the wind took his voice and shredded it to impotent fragments
necho laughed softly
too late now
they are gone let his battered head drop his beard trailing in the dirt
through shredded lips he muttered if i reach the sea of shadows i live
true
but if you do not you die
and then low laughter shook the other
groaning the king dragged himself forward
necho followed good horse can reach the sea of shadows in three days
if you walk swiftly you may reach it in six
but you must hurry
why do you not rise my cyaxares
the king spat out bitter oaths
in agony he pulled himself forward leaving a trail of blood on the grass blood that dripped unceasingly from the twin raw stumps just above his ankles
the stone that fell upon you was sharp
cyaxares was it not
necho mocked
but hurry
you have little time
there are mountains to climb and rivers to cross
so in the trail of raynor and eblik and delphia crept the dying king hearing fainter and ever fainter the triumphant pipes of pan from sardopolis
and presently patient as the silent necho a vulture dipped against the blue and took up the pursuit the beat of its wings distinctly audible in the heavy stagnant silence
and raynor and delphia and eblik rode onward toward the sea
a story of whispering coffins by in the next issue of collejc humor moncati be positive until he developed the fatal negative
by author oi the lost wraith house o darkness etc gave him the packet without question and moncati stood politely listening to him his head cocked a little to one side
his bright dark eyes were smiling coldly but his thin lips remained devoid of any movement confess have been afraid of your stepfather myself said wemyss
there were some very strange stories about him and the man himself always impressed me as something evil
wemyss coughed nervously and cast a glance over his shoulder to where his law partner was at work on a brief
belatedly lowering his voice he added admire your fearlessness moncati
thank you said moncati and left him
outside his lips smiled and he said within his mind wemyss you had the secret
his hand tightened a little about the packet and the photograph in it
this kind of blackmail would never have occurred to wemyss
the second print was authentic but the framed photograph had changed again in the night
as he walked through piccadilly in the sunlight so unusual for london moncati held his smile and his thoughts dwelt upon the photograph and the occasion upon which he had taken it
about his stepfather wemyss had put it mildly indeed
moncati himself had heard the old man boast am the lord of evil
proudly
sure of himself
moncati remembered it well and had reason to believe it on natural grounds
wemyss had not been wrong when he had warned him that the old man had an eye on the legacy coming to moncati at twentyfive dabbling in photography had saved his life just as teddifer his stepfather was preparing to leap upon him fingers already curved for his throat the flashlight bulb had gone off
moncati had risen from his simulated sleep thrust teddifer away and gone with the camera and film
he remembered yet the fury and chagrin on the old mans face when he had learned about elaborate precautions but he remembered too that already then he had known that some day he would have to take other steps paused to tear into little pieces the letter that had been with the packet for wemyss which began in case of my death please forward immediately to inspector winslow at new scotland yard and went on chuckling to himself now lighthearted and gay with eyes for every pretty girl he met
deep in his mind he was well satisfied with himself as proud as old teddifer had ever been of his magic and necromancy and not a little scornful of the evil old man who had come to such a prosaic and untimely end
moncati felt not a qualm at remembering how carefully he had tied the cord which had tripped teddifer at the head of the stairs and left him at the bottom with his scrawny neck broken
after all moncati had had every provocation he had known that by some design or other teddifer had meant to accomplish his death and take his legacy and the thought had irritated and at last had worried him into action
if a fly bothers me i kill it he had told himself then
why hot teddifer
when moncati reached home he unpacked the enlarged photograph found a frame and hung the picture on the wall squarely over his desk so that he might remind himself from time to time of his own cleverness in circumventing the evil old man who had been his stepfather
he had already burnt up most of books and papers and had begun to rearrange the house to suit his own convenience
he went whistling up the stairs and left the picture there in the patch of sunlight on the wall the evilfaced old man with head half turned toward the hidden camera and the flare that had surprised him moncati himself in bed the glare of light that made strikingly clear the huge cruel old hands and the designing mind behind
the sunlight was additionally merciless and there the picture hung moncati in bed and hercules teddifer about to reach for his neck
for some days the picture comforted moncati it gave him a deepseated feeling of contentment of satisfaction with himself and the world and he glanced at it smiling once or twice a day
then he went down to sussex for a weekend and when he came back he felt for the first time a disquieting note about the picture
it was something intangible something upon which he could not put a finger but it was there
the photograph gave him the old pleasure and satisfaction but there was something more something malevolent about it and he was irritated to think he did not know what it was
for a brief moment he thought that the old mans expression had subtly altered become more calculating but being careful about his imagination he dismissed the thought
two evenings later as he sat at his desk writing a difficult letter he glanced absently up at the graph and saw a movement there
because the indirect light threw a diffused glow over the picture he thought at first that the movement he had seen was a normal hallucination springing from the slight refocusing of his gaze from paper to photograph but almost instantly his eyes fixed unconsciously upon the spot where he had thought the movement to have been hercules hands
with a faint tremor he knew that he had seen the old mans large bony hands flex open and close and he involuntarily waited fascinated for the hands to move again
but only for a second
he recollected himself and turned the light full upon the photograph a faint feeling of panic guiding his hand
he looked at it closely but nothing happened there was nothing changed about it and he suffered a brief moment of distaste before he felt the old pleasure creep over him again the sense of proud security he had made for himself by so fortunately ridding himself of his menacing stepfather
he sat down again presently and resumed the letter but every little while he caught himself looking expectantly up at the photograph watching nervously and uncertainly so that in the end he was obliged to give up the letter somehow his mind would not return to it would not concentrate properly on the task before it
with a faintly derisive smile half for himself half for the photograph he left the desk
he had no doubt that his eyes had played a trick on him and he slept well that night without dreams
he rose in the morning got at his letter again and finished it without any trouble
on his way out of the house to the victoria and albert museum he gave the photograph a fleeting glance with his customary good humor and went whistling into the mornings fog
not until he was seated comfortably in the underground did it occur to him that hercules face as he had seen it in the photograph that morning was no longer turned toward the hidden camera
he had not actually realized it at first but his eyes had seen the image had been transmitted and now suddenly he remembered it with a certain definiteness which he found difficult to escape
the possibility of any physical change in the photograph was too absurd to entertain seriously he began to think very clearly around what his eyes had seen in an attempt to find some explanation of it
but the more he thought the greater his confusion grew until he knew that he must return to the house and assure himself that such a change had not actually taken place
he made a mental note at the same time to see about his eyes glasses certainly were indicated let himself in the house with trepidation and went directly to the picture
he looked and looked again stepped back a little and stared his mind in outraged tumult
there was a change
the old mans face no longer peered out at him instead it had turned ever so slightly and taken new cognizance of the figure in the bed the head bent a little and the eyes lost in contemplation
it was incredible but it was true
moncati took the photograph off its hook and peered closely at it
he rubbed his fingers over it as if be might feel some subtle difference his eyes could not see but there was nothing
baffled he put it back and stood looking at it for a long time until he became conscious of the fact that he was waiting for change to take place there before his eyes
then angry with himself he turned away and went grimly out of the house intending to complete the days itinerary as he had set it for himself
but somehow before he knew it the museum palled on him and he found himself sitting down to tea with old wemyss who eyed him a little askance
investment trouble asked the barrister
moncati shook his head
no dan48 ger of that just developed some curiosity about my late stepfather
wemyss put on his pincenez and looked at him
god bless my soul he exclaimed put you in mind of him now dead and the worlds the better for it you particularly
moncati smiled his most persuasive smile
agreed mr wemyss but i have a reasonable amount of curiosity and rather like to know something of the nature of those strange stories about which you hinted the last time i called on you
wemyss eyes narrowed
what misguided impulse roused your curiosity he asked
moncati shrugged
is it misguided hesitate to talk about things i donot myself understand and yet must put some belief in replied wemyss because i dislike being held up to ridicule even if only in the private opinions of my clients
i donot suppose you believe in such things as magic and sorcery eh
moncati smiled pleasantly and said
only a fool refuses to keep an open mind
well said answered wemyss shortly
teddifer practised that sort of thing squares and circles and spirit rites and such
i donot hold with it myself but i understand that some very unusual occurrences took place in that house of his
wemyss shrugged a little irritated but went on
the best i can say is that some people died very oddly servants
two that i know of
both strangled
but of course your stepfather was out of the city at the time
no question about that
wemyss smiled a little oddly with a kind of menace behind his lips
he had some queer theories about the projection of psychic doubles and astrals and the like for that matter no one ever found any prints of any kind on those two dead servants
of a sudden wemyss gulped his tea and was off saying over his shoulder god bless my soul forgotten my appointment with dotson
moncati waved at his back but he was puzzled the inference behind wemyss words was clear enough and somehow moncati could not get his thoughts away from hercules huge ungainly hands the tough clawlike appendages that had so greedily threatened his own throat
he shook himself presently paid for the tea and wandered somewhat relunctantly homeward looked at the picture but there was no further change
he was conscious of a slight feeling of relief but this was dissipated at once in the memory of that first change
he took the photograph down again and examined it anew but could discover nothing remarkable about it
for the first time he began to be aware of something akin to fear he began to search his memory for some clue to this strange occurrence and at the same time he began to cast around for some manner of escape from the intangible dread he had beun to feel insidiously drawing upon him from the recesses of his mind a malignant dread akin to that same fear he had known when first he had become aware of his stepfathers evil design to kill him
doggedly he put the picture back on the wall and went about his small tasks
by evening he had sufficiently recovered his composure to contemplate coolly some means of combatting the subtle dread that lay in the back of his mind
he could not refrain from looking at the picture again but there was no further change and he felt a renewal of faith in himself
he had thought once fleetingly of burning the picture but this seemed to him somehow a reflection upon the resourcefulness and courage that had brought it into being and he could not contemplate with equanimity the resultant drain upon his selfesteem
throughout the evening he sat in the room reading his desk light thrown upward upon the picture but nothing happened nothing whatever
he had come almost to expect some further development but this absence of anything again set him doubting what he had first seen
had there been any change in the first place
or had his imagination overreached itself
certain as he was that the old man had first been looking out at him from the photograph he was equally certain that he was now no longer doing so but if this change had indeed taken place it was utterly against natural law
this thought gave him but little comfort until he realized that he could settle the question of whether or not his imagination had been remiss by taking the negative and having a separate print made for comparison
at once he was flooded with a strange feeling of freedom from dread he felt that he was about to do the right thing
the possibility that his confidence did not come entirely from within himself did not occur to him
in the morning he took the negative and made a second print enlarged to the same size as the original
he came to his desk with it and stood it up below the framed photograph
what he saw was so far from reassuring that he caught hold of a chair and eased himself into it
not only was the second print as he had originally believed the framed photograph to have been but the latter had again changed in the night hercules teddifer had moved closer to the figure in the bed and his hands were clenched
moncati began to perspire coldly
for a moment he sat there at a loss to know what to do and he thought confusedly of the old mans strange beliefs
somehow it had not before occurred to him that by photographing the old man he had managed however obscurely to himself to perpetuate teddifer and his evil design
but in the height of his misery hope came to him
he came to his feet and in two strides had torn the photograph from the wall
three minutes later all that was left was a small drift of ashes
he was utterly relieved at once
how the old man could have managed recourse to his magic sorcery in this way was beyond moncati but the knowledge that he had circumvented him a second time was not
his opinion of himself soared
he went out to celebrate
he made a night of it hilariously told some acquaintances that he was celebrating his freedom and congratulated himself upon shaking off the dread he had known so briefly again
he came in late after midnight his mind a little sluggish and threw himself partly dressed on to his bed where he fell asleep at once
not quite an hour later he awoke
the clock had struck two and he lay drowsily staring into the darkness for some minutes before he heard the sound like the rattling and rustling of paper
even at that he did not come fully awake he pondered the sound sleepily and was not aware of its approach until it was almost upon his room he listened carefully wondering what it might be
it was like nothing he had ever heard before save for its dry rustling and crackling
he raised himself tiredly on one elbow just as the door of his room opened
this distracted him momentarily from the sound of movement and he thought a draft had drawn it open for at the moment there was nothing but darkness flowing in upon him
not until an uncanny chill pervaded his senses did he realize that the darkness he saw was not the shadows in the hall but that it was something alive something malignant
instantly he was caught in a cloud of dread he saw the darkness resolve itself into a dim human figure one side aglow as if a light were falling upon it and heard a dry chuckling all too familiar
it was hercules grim face that looked down upon him
even as an outcry rose to lips the ungainly hands closed around his neck
the last thing moncati remembered was the thing he had unfortunately forgotten the second print from the a complete novelet of matter over mind i
by author of the undead the mechanical man etc i the empty cube i with chatham when he discovered the box and i can still remember his cry of delight and surprise when he unearthed it
we had been doing a bit of fossil hunting on a piece of land of his in southeastern pennsylvania where a spur of primal rock strata reared its head practically to the surface
so far we had found little more than the usual fossil shells and a few fern impressions so battered by time that they were practically worthless
but this was different
at his shout i left my own digging a little distance away and joined him
he was standing over what looked like a pocket in the solid rock formed by some freak folding of the strata back in preglacial times
look wilder he exclaimed it was hollow but not empty nothing jubilantly was trying to chip off this upper layer when my pick went straight through
what do you make of it
i got down on my hands and knees and peered into the opening he had made
i saw what he was raving about
the pocket extended a foot or two in all directions beyond the opening and about four feet downward
and resting flat upon its bottom was a rectangular shaped object
what the dickens
i exclaimed and began to pry away pieces of the loose rock with my hands
what is it
he got down beside me
looks as though it might be manmade doesnot it
nature doesnot work in such perfect cubes donot know i replied in it but nothing wassomething fully although the same idea had flashed across my own mind
there are certain slate formations but this isnot slate he interrupted
he picked up a shard of the dull colored rock igneous stuff
much older than slate
but later than the surrounding rock apparently i said
i scrambled to my feet enlarge the opening and see what youve found
a few blows of our picks cleared away the top of the pocket giving us an unobstructed view into the cavity beneath
it now measured about four feet in all of its dimensions with the two foot cube resting upon the middle of its floor drop in and pass it out to you chatham said
then we can examine it better
think you can manage it alone
i asked
it looks as though it were made of solid metal try he answered letting himself down into the hole
if i canot well attach ropes
he knelt in the confined space and wrapped his arms about the cube his muscles swelling beneath his khaki shirt in anticipation of the strain
the next instant he had almost gone over backwards taking the cube with him expression of stunned surprise was so comical that i laughed
man you donot know your own strength i told him
here let me take it
he rose holding the cube easily under one arm
believe it or not wilder he said the things hollow nonsense
i scoffed taking it from him while he climbed back beside me
but immediately i realized that he had spoken the truth no solid could have been so weightless
if its hollow it must be a box of some sort i said and there must be a way to open it
but a careful examination first with the naked eye and then with a powerful lens revealed not the slightest trace of latch keyhole or hinge
the six sides were as smooth as though they had been cast in one solid piece
chatham was both excited and disturbed
he shook his head
there was the beginning of awe in his eyes
one things clear at least he muttered manmade
but made by what sort of man too old for the stone age even if they possessed a knowledge of metals in those days which they didnot
why the rock this thing was embedded in must go back to the pleistocene period
and that was just the beginning of the age of mammals i said
we looked at each other and i saw the inward sense of strangeness reflected in his eyes and knew that mine held the same reflection
we felt less elated even a little subdued
here was an object unquestionably made by human hands yet found embedded in rocks that had been formed ages before man himself had come into being
chatham laughed nervously know what going to do he said with sudden determination going to telegraph for old gunthorp at the university be able to explain it if anybody can
i got the odd impression that we were like children a little frightened and therefore appealing to a father for aid and advice
professor timothy gunthorp was like ourselves an amateur archeologist but an exceptionally good one
his real work was in the physics department at one of largest universities where he was working upon an experiment to convert energy into matter thus reversing the usual process
we rode into town in my rattletrap car and sent off our wire at once
before sundown we had received an answer we felt better
we were clearing away our breakfast things the next morning when the familiar bald head and steelrimmed spectacles of professor gunthorp looked in at the open door of our shack fools both of you he announced with his customary abruptness
tearing a man away from important work with a story have a look at this impossible marvel of yours
i went over to our work table and removed the tarpaulin that we had thrown over the box
gunthorp frowned disapprovingly
so you couldnot leave it where it was until i got here he observed
well you must have taken photographs of it in its original position at least
feeling like utter simpletons we had to admit that in our excitement we had overlooked that bit of routine
gunthorp clucked his tongue in annoyance
and you blockheads call yourselves archeologists he snorted
only rank amateurs professor chatham said humbly
gunthorp began to examine the box
first he lifted it to test its weight then he rapped upon it with his knuckles
hollow as your two heads he vouchsafed
he bent closer and studied the metal
looks like tungsten he observed
but it isnot
either of you got any idea what it is
we both confessed that we had not
well neither have he admitted sourly
now take me out and show me where you found it
we conducted him to the spot and stood aside while he examined first the hole itself and then the surrounding rocks
as his inspection progressed there grew upon his long lean face a look of bepuzzlement that afforded both chatham and me secret satisfaction
presently he picked up a spade that we had neglected to take in the night before and with an energy surprising in a man of his years began to clear away the rubble for about six feet on all sides of the hole
of a sudden he threw down the spade and whirled upon us never before suspected either of you of possessing a sense of humor he barked at us but in any case your socalled practical joke is rather thin
practical joke we gasped together
we were both accustomed to peppery outbursts but this did not sound like the usual thing
if theres a practical joke professor its on us too i declared
we found the box in that pocket yesterday precisely as we told you in our wire
if anybody put it there for a little legpulling they did an unusually clever job for the rock stratum was closed above it broke into it accidentally with my pick chatham added in cur words or attitudes must have convinced him for his manner underwent a subtle change
a queer unreadable expression crept into his eyes noticed i suppose that this rock is not the same as the surrounding rocks he queried
we nodded glacial boulder from the riss or wurm i began but he interrupted me
use your eyes wilder use your eyes
this is no glacial boulder from the wurm the riss or any other glacier
look at its pitted surface a fallen meteor
i looked
even with my limited knowledge of meteorology i realized all at once that he spoke the truth
the thought was dizzying
millions of years ago this huge blob of matter had been drawn into the earths gravitational field and had become embedded in the still soft rocks
probably it had originally been buried hundreds of feet deep and the gradual weathering and wearing down of the top strata through countless millenia had only within the past thousand or so years brought it near the surface near enough for our spades to strike
chatham was staring at the gray pitted mass that the professors spade had cleared
but but the box he asked dazedly
exactly gunthorp repeated
the box
without another word the three of us marched back to the shack for a further examination of our mysterious find
but we learned no more than we already knew
acid tests showed that it was composed of an alloy of tungsten and some other metal with which we were unfamiliar a further proof if we had needed any that it was the work of intelligent beings
but that those beings could have been inhabitants of this earth was utterly impossible both because of the tremendous age of the rocks in which the box had been embedded and its unquestionable encasement in a meteor thoughts flashed through my mind imaginings based on remembered legends of a race before the time of adam and of things that had supposedly drifted down from the stars
but i did not mention them to gunthorp
he was striving desperately to keep matters on a rational prosaic plane
besides there was bound to be some less fantastic explanation there had to be
what like to know chatham remarked in the manner of one thinking aloud is what the thing was for
why should it have been made hollow
gunthorp looked up
why not cut it open and find out he asked
the suggestion seemed like a good one and we agreed
chatham brought out the large plate camera and took several pictures of the box from all angles then i set to work upon it with a cold chisel
we got our second shock
my greatest efforts produced not a single dent in the tough metal
chatham and gunthorp tried their hands but with no better success
between us we turned the edges on four tools the box itself remained practically unscratched
chatham ran his fingers through his red hair a lot tougher than ordinary tungsten he he had an idea
going over to the supply cupboard he brought back two phials one containing iron oxide the other powdered aluminum
if this doesnot do the trick well get an oxyacetylene torch he said
not bad gunthorp commented in what was for him extravagant praise
of course theres a chance of its marring the inside when it burns through but well have to run that risk
he took the two vials from chatham and blended their contents in a thin careful line along the four edges of the boxs topmost plane
then he lit it
there was a sharp hiss as the powders ignited then it began to burn with a brilliant greenish white flame
wordlessly we watched that hollow square of fire keeping well back from the tremendous heat that it generated
slowly it began to sink into the metal eating its way like an acid
in another minute or so it would be through and the top of the cube would drop inward
gunthorp was standing by with a pail of water which he meant to dash over it at the crucial moment
he had even taken a step forward when without an instants warning the unexpected happened
with a final sputter the burning powder ate through the last thin bit of metal but instead of falling in the top of the box flew upward
there was a rush of escaping force the word does not describe it properly but it is the nearest i can find and we were hurled backwards into unconsciousness
we all regained our senses at about the same time and stared at one another in bewilderment what was it
i muttered
an infernal machine
but i knew better even as i spoke
had there been any kind of explosion our frail shack would have been in ruins whereas not even the glass of the windows were broken
gunthorp picked himself up and went over to the work table
whatever it was its left no trace behind it he said jerkily
he held up the cube still glowing redly around its seared edges
its interior was as blank and uninformative as its exterior had been
it couldnot have been a gas of any kind chatham supplemented gas powerful enough to knock us all out would have left some aftereffects
it was more like like he groped inadequately for words
like a great mental shock i supplied trying to analyze my own feelings at the time it
gunthorp rasped
the thing that was in that box paralyzed our minds temporarily
but its gone now he added with a rueful shrug dissipated upon the air and thats the end of it
but for once professor timothy gunthorp was wrong
missing men weeks drifted by
gunthorp had returned to his research work at the university where in his spare time he was writing a monograph upon our mysterious discovery and subsequent experience a work which he told us frankly he had little hope that anyone would believe
chatham and i had gone back to our fossil hunting and although we talked about the box often we felt that there was nothing more we could do about it
then one day chatham who had gone into town for supplies brought back a strange story
there was between our camp and the town a fair sized woods that formed a veritable paradise for rabbit hunters during the game season
since the season had just opened the day before a swarm of them had descended upon it
and that was where story came in
it seemed that a party of local men had started out early in the morning and had separated after reaching the woods according to custom
after hunting all day they met again at a lodge that they kept to spend the night and they discovered that one of their number a man named ed stanton was missing
they waited for him until ten oclock then fearing that he might have met with an accident they set out in search of him
they searched with lanterns for half the night but found no trace of the missing man
finally someone suggested that he might have gone home instead of returning to the lodge so they inquired there
but without result
members of his family and neighbors had then joined in the search which had continued throughout the night with the coming of daylight stanton was still missing
looks bad i commented when chatham had finished his recital
that woods is large enough so that if he were badly hurt or killed he could lie there for days before being discovered know it chatham said
he glanced toward the forbidding density of the woods scome half mile away
what do you say we join in the search
i was willing and we set out together
the going was slow
it was nearly noon when we encountered three members of the original hunting party coming from the opposite direction
what luck
i asked
the oldest of the group shook his head
not any he replied found plenty of fresh marks in the bushes but with the gang that was in here yesterday its impossible to tell whether any of them are it seems funny that he could have disappeared this way but of course weve got a good bit of territory still to search
what about his dog
chatham asked he have a dog another funny thing the other answered
the dogs gone too
however we found the dog or rather another party did around three oclock in the afternoon
it was lying under a clump of laurel bushes and it was dead with its tail drawn down between its legs and its eyes bulging
but there was not a single mark of violence upon its body
maybe it got hold of something that poisoned it one fellow suggested as a number of us gathered round
but the county sheriff who had now taken charge of the search shook his head
it wasnot any poison killed that dog he declared
look at his eyes and tail
he was scared to death plumb scared swear it
and damn it scared too
we redoubled our searching efforts
we thrashed literally every foot of the underbrush within a mile radius of the place where we had found the dog
we found no trace of stanton
with the coming of night the sheriff called us all together
no use going on after dark he told us
these woods are too thick and we couldnot do a thorough job
better to wait until daylight and start in again a few searchers tinued on their own and in the morning one of them a farm laborer named jake mills had a somewhat weird story to relate
he and a companion had penetrated with a lantern into the deepest part of the woods when of a sudden they had become aware of a strong sensation of being followed
we didnot hear nothin and we didnot see nothin jake explained
it was just the way you feel when somebodys behind you starin with all his might at the back of your head
we turned around and sent the light of the lantern as far as it would go among the trees but there was nothin there
we even went back apiece but we couldnot find anything
yet every time wed start on wed have that feelin of somethin behind us but not as close as it had been the first time
finally it got on our nerves and so we decided wed better take the sheriffs advice and wait till mornin
it was this story of that gave rise to the belief that an escaped lunatic with homicidal tendencies might be hiding in the woods
but a checkup of all the local and even more distant institutions for the insane revealed that all their inmates were accounted for
a number of the men began to laugh at what they called case of cold feet
others remembered dog and werenot so free with their jibes
nor were the others when four days later a second man disappeared
he was a dr philip morse member of a boston society for physical research
he had arrived at the local hotel shortly after disappearance and advanced the theory that the missing man had fallen victim to some elemental or earth spirit that had been released in the woods
there was considerable amusement at his statement
but when he calmly announced his intention of camping alone in the woods in an attempt to contact the thing the amusement faded not that i hold with your ghost stories dr morse the sheriff told him but theres something in them woods thats snatched ed stanton away bodily and scared the life out of his dog
a man ainot safe there alone
dr morse only smiled
that evening he pitched a small tent near the place where jake mills and his companion had first felt they were being followed
early the next morning the sheriff and two other men went out to check up on him
what gruesome horror they expected to discover they themselves did not know but they found the doctor calmly preparing his breakfast after an uneventful night
the fact that he had spent one night alone in those supposedly sinister woods without anything out of the ordinary befalling him lulled everyone into a false sense of security
hence the discovery that was made the following day was doubly shocking
a party of searchers coming upon the camp around noon of the second day found it literally torn to pieces
as for dr morse himself he had disappeared as completely as stanton had done five days before
chatham and i went to view the wreckage as soon as we heard about it
we found a large crowd there looking about
looks like a cyclone hit the place one man remarked as we stopped beside him
the doc must have put up a fearful fight cyclone or a lunatic another amended
one of them funny farms must be holdin out on us
but the tent was demolished the camp furniture bedding and even articles of clothing were torn to pieces in a way that even the most desperate struggle could not properly account for
the sheriff came over to us
well at least we know where morse was when he was attacked he said sent to philadelphia for bloodhounds when they come going to start out from here and see what they can find
we complimented him upon the plan
he nodded then with a significant glance and quick gesture implied that he had something else to discuss with us in private
he motioned us aside found this notebook under a part of the tent he explained when we had drawn a little away from the others
morse must have been writing in it just before the thing got him
i thought maybe you fellows would take a look at it and tell me whether theres anything in it except just craziness
i took the notebook from him and flipped open the top cover
several pages were covered with a cramped closely written shorthand almost undecipherable
it will take a little while to figure this out i said
may i keep it until tomorrow morning
sure he agreed readily
keep it as long as you like just so you find out what it says
but i was destined not to translate personally more than the opening pages of that manuscript for that evening the bloodhounds arrived
the cave sheriffs invitation we joined him and a party of about a dozen others on the manhunt
darkness had already fallen when we assembled at the scene of dr demolished camp
in the flickering yellow light of lanterns the shadows of trees and bushes danced and writhed in grotesque contortions giving the scene an eeriness that unpleasantly affected all of us
a little to one side a stranger stood with the dogs two powerful black fellows who lolled passively at the ends of their chains as though they had no interest in what was going on
presently the sheriff went over and held a brief lowvoiced conversation with their owner then he addressed the rest of us
mr gonna let the dogs go now he announced
he says we should stand back till theyve picked up the scent then we can follow as close as were able
if they start up any ruckus you fellas that have guns ainot to use them unless you can see plain what youre shootin at liable to hit the dogs or the doc
the man called patton was holding part of a torn coat evidently against the muzzle of first one dog then the other
when they had sniffed their fill he slipped the chains from their collars and with a final indistinguishable command to them stepped back
noses pressed to the ground the two animals began to run around the wreckage of the tent in gradually widening circles
then with a kind of nasal whine one of them suddenly darted off at a tangent followed almost immediately by the other
with a feeling of rising excitement we started after them falling into a rough single file to facilitate travel
we lost sight of the dogs almost from the beginning but we could hear them breaking through the underbrush a short distance ahead of us while they gave voice almost continuously to their deepthroated baying
for nearly a mile we pushed on without anyone uttering a word the silence around us broken only by the crackle of twigs and the baying of the dogs now farther distant
then of a sudden their baying gave place to excited yelping interspersed with highpitched whining noises found him the sheriff exclaimed and broke into a run practically nothing about bloodhounds but i had a premonition the moment their tone changed that everything was not going according to schedule
no dog regardless of his breed ever indulges in that highpitched whine when everything is running entirely to his satisfaction
i glanced at patton and saw the same suspicion reflected on his face
by this time we had come out upon a deep gully whose opposite wall was broken by the yawning blackness of a caves mouth
the dogs had already crossed this gulley and were now yelping and whining in front of the cave
gosh almighty
he must be in there the sheriff exclaimed and started scrambling down the steep side of the ravine have thought equally puzzled the rest of us followed
we all knew about the cave of course but no one had thought to search it because it was known to be the abode of bats and small but very disagreeable snakes
ed stanton would never have gone in there alive and he could not have got there dead
but dr morse now might be another story patton had forged on ahead of the rest of us and was standing over the dogs when we came up got something cornered in there but they wonot go in after it he announced never known them to act like this before
i donot understand it
the sheriff went over and held up his lantern so that its light penetrated some ten or twelve feet into the cave
the dogs came straight here without seemin to lose the trail he commented so morse must be inside
shall we go in
someone in the crowd offered an objection
maybe theres a wild animal in there
if the dogs wonot go in but patton scouted the suggestion no animal in this part of the country that these dogs are afraid of he declared
still admit theres something strange about the way theyre acting
he made a final effort to induce the dogs to lead the way into the cave but without success
they only cowered upon their bellies and whined gazing pleadingly at him with their large intelligent eyes no use he announced
either well have to go in without them or we stay out
the sheriff gave a hitch to his belt and stepped almost casually into the cave entrance
all right he drawled
all them that wants come along
them that donot can wait where they are
there was a momentary hesitancy on the part of a few individuals but eventually everyone followed him into the dark opening
we advanced about fifty or sixty feet without making any sort of discovery
a few bats disturbed by the glare of our lanterns darted blindly about our heads but that was all
then suddenly the sheriff stopped
look he commanded and pointed downward
there in the thin sticky mould that covered the damp rock of the floor was a human footprint
instantly an excited babbling of speculation broke out among us
it was quite obvious that the footprint had been made within the past twentyfour hours since as yet none of the microscopic green algae plants had begun to form within it
therefore it had almost certainly been made by dr morse
further searching revealed more footprints in fact two sets of them the one superimposed upon the other
from the presence of the algae in the earlier set it was plain that it had been made at least several days before the second
it looks as if morse and stanton might both have come this way i whispered to chatham as we began to move forward again
he nodded
in the ruddy glow of the lanterns his face appeared worried what i donot like about it wilder he replied
what could have brought both of those men to this same cave and why did neither of them come out
it almost seems as if a sudden startled shout from one of the men up ahead interrupted me
look he was crying pointing a trembling arm as he spoke
look over there on that ledge
we all looked in the direction he indicated where a ledge of rock except for a narrow crevice some two feet wide opening into unexploited blackness formed the back of the cave
perched facing us upon this ledge and seeming to stare at us with unblinking lusterless eyes were two human figures
the sheriff took a quick step forward then almost dropped his lantern
merciful god he gasped
ed stanton and doctor morse
so it was
the faces of the two men bore no marks of physical change or disfigurement yet in some subtle way they had altered so that at first glance we had been unable to recognize them
a number of the men went over and lifted them down
both bodies were limp and clammy but to our surprise they were not dead
get them out of here and into the open the sheriff ordered
maybe we can bring them around
four men took up the inert burdens and we started back the way we had come
two of the younger fellows however lingered behind the others wonder where that crack leads to i heard one of them mutter to the other like but i was too interested in the condition of morse and stanton to pay any further attention
i was to wish later that i had
the two bodies were placed upon the ground at the entrance to the cave and the local doctor who fortunately was one of the party bent over them canot make it out he reported after a brief examination
it looks like catalepsy except that theres no rigidity better get them to a hospital at once
while crude stretchers were being improvised from coats chatham drew me aside
wilder did you ever see a cretin he asked lowering his voice so that none of the others might overhear
no i answered wondering why he should bring up such a subject at this time canot say that i have
why
well i have he went on and except for the physical deformation that accompanies cretinism the faces have the same blank mindless look that these two have
but what i never finished my question
from the interior of the cave arose a sudden wild shriek of terror followed by a hideous mouthing and gibbering that was distinctly not human
i remembered the two men who had lingered behind a lantern i dashed for the mouth of the cave followed closely by chatham and one or two others
it took me almost no time at all to reach the place where we had found morse and stanton but in those few minutes the sounds that had summoned us had subsided into a low jabbering like the chattering of a monkey
and they were coming from beyond the crevice at the back of the cave
holding the lantern high above my head i started toward the narrow opening
but before i could reach it a man staggered out and all but collapsed in my arms
he was jim lentz one of the two who had remained behind
something in there he muttered thickly
got hellman no use going in too late
then he fainted
i do not lay any claims to bravery for actually pressing on into that dark passageway
it was the sheer excitement of the moment that drove me leaving no room for fear
still holding the lantern in front of me i sidled along the crevice for about six feet
abruptly i found myself in another cave
it was much smaller than the first so that the light of the lantern penetrated into practically all of it at once
as the ruddy rays sent the black shadows scuttling back among the uneven prominences and fissures that marked the walls and ceiling i experienced a curious sensation which i am wholly unable to describe
although i realize how ridiculous the words may sound i can say only that it was as though some overpowering force had collided with my mind
the impression was only momentary and was gone with the retreating shadows
but instantly a second shock this time wholly explicable took its place
for groveling upon the middle of the rock floor and mouthing horribly like some mad animal was the figure of hellman
i heard an exclamation behind me and realized that chatham had followed me through the narrow passage
merciful god he choked gone mad
quick i ground between clenched teeth
we must get him out of here i set the lantern upon a projecting rock and chatham and i flung ourselves upon hellman
he had paid no attention to us until he felt our hands upon him then he began to fight with the strength of a maniac
in the end we were forced to knock him unconscious before we were able to drag him from the cave
when he came to he was still in that savage bestial state he had to be taken to an asylum day we heard story of what had taken place
i set it down here as nearly as i can in his own words we were about to leave the cave with the rest of you he told a group of us when hellman suggested that we stay and see where that little opening at the back led to
i wasnot so keen about it but when he laughed and said i was afraid i gave in
he had the lantern and so he went first while i followed close behind
the passage was so narrow that we had to go sideways and the first thing i knew my coat had caught on a sharp rock so that i had to stop to get it loose
hellman must have thought that i wasnot coming for he made a grab for me
as he did that he somehow dropped the lantern and it went out
he paused and passed a trembling hand over his face
it was plain that what he had to relate filled him with almost unendurable horror hard to explain what happened next he went on after a minute for i donot exactly know myself
all of a sudden he let go of me and staggered backwards
then he let out the most awful yell ever heard
at first i thought hed fallen into a pit or something and i called out to him to ask what was wrong
he didnot answer me with words but he began to make those awful noises like like an animal or something
there were sounds of thrashing about too but they werenot so much like two men or even a man and an animal struggling together as like one man fighting with himself tried to go to help him but all of a sudden i i couldnot move
it was as if everything ever been afraid of without giving a name to it had taken form in there
if any of you fellows were ever scared of the dark when you were kids youll know what i mean
it was like that only a hundred times worse
and all the time hellman kept making those terrible noises not so loud as at first but more and more like an animal
then i heard somebody coming and i i managed to get out to them
i guess thats all i know
that afternoon the sheriff and several others searched both parts of the cave with powerful electric torches
they found absolutely nothing but the sheriff in telling us about it afterwards concluded with a strange statement was the last one to leave the inner cave he said and just as i stepped into that narrow passage that connects the two a funny thing happened
all of a sudden i had the same feeling that jake mills had had in the woods the night after ed stanton disappeared the feeling of something staring at the back of my head
it fairly made the chills go over me for i knew there wasnot a living thing back there a notion to ask the county commissioners either to have that place sealed up or better yet dynamited
the gunthorp theory the finding of stanton and dr morse and the insanity of hellman the newspapers which had hitherto given the disappearances only passing notice now broke out with headlines
naturally this resulted in an army of curiosity seekers who had to be kept away from the cave by an armed guard but it was also indirectly responsible for bringing about the solution to the whole mysterious affair for it brought back prof gunthorp
he presented himself unannounced at our shack sarcastic and snappy as ever
well i see youve done nothing toward clearing this mess up he announced abruptly so i came myself
chatham made some illadvised remark about not seeing how the happenings at the cave could come under the province of archeology
the professor shot him a withering glance
you wouldnot he snapped suppose you and wilder are ready to subscribe to ghost theory
still he added as if on second thought that man may have been nearer to the right track than he realized
a shame he didnot make any sort of notes before the thing got him
but he did
i exclaimed suddenly remembering the notebook that i had promised the sheriff to translate
here they are
he fairly pounced upon the little book
you blithering idiots he cried
if you had examined this that last poor devil hellman might not have been sacrificed
now get out while i see what morse had to say
all the rest of that morning he was occupied with laboriously transcribing dr cramped shorthand
by the middle of the afternoon he had completed the task and was ready to share what he had learned with chatham and me skip over the first few pages he announced since they consist of nothing but idiotic theories
funny how an otherwise sane man will cling to worn out superstitions when he can find a wholly satisfactory explanation of the facts in the laws of higher physics
but let that go you probably wouldnot understand it anyway
he leafed jerkily over one or two more pages
this next is an hourly record of his first nights vigil he continued and consists mainly of the words nothing so far so we can skip that too
but here is his record of the second night up to the point where he was attacked
he cleared his throat and began to read aloud eight p m
it is fairly dark now so i will begin my record for tonight although i really cannot hope for any genuine phenomenon for some hours yet
still for the sake of science it is best to be on the safe side
the woods are very still but no more so than they should be ordinarily
again i shall endeavor to work without light since light of any kind seems to be antagonistic to psychic forces
nine p m
nothing yet
the trees and bushes on all sides are loud with the voices of night insects
it seems almost impossible that such tiny creatures can make so much noise
i am beginning to believe that the true intensity of sound is to be measured only by the intensity of the silence that surrounds it
ten p m
either some of the insects have gone to sleep or i am growing accustomed to their miniature racket
i probably did not notice this last night because i was still too new at this type of vigil
i am making this entry a half hour earlier because i believe that soon i will have some sort of success
the insects are nearly all quiet now a circumstance which i am positive did not occur last night
but it is not merely this cessation of ordinary night noises that leads me to believe i am about to experience some kind of psychic phenomenon
there is a decided feeling of tension in the air such as is noticeable just prior to a severe electrical storm yet the sky wherever it is visible through the trees is entirely cloudless and rny little barometer which i examined a moment ago with my flashlight shows no indication of falling weather fortyfive
i was right
a force of some sort is gathering outside my tent
as the man mills described i can feel eyes upon me but they are not human eyes
i will make ray mind receptive to whatever may be coming
eleven p m
it is here in the tent with me and i must fight it off
my god it is horrible i can neither see it nor hear it and yet it has taken hold of me
if the cold arm of an octopus could reach into my mind it would be like that
it is too strong for me
i gunthorp looked up from the notebook
the writing breaks off here in a meaningless scrawl he said
the power must have overcome him and i had been listening openmouthed
but what power
i asked incredulously
if it was something he could neither see nor hear nor apparently even feel tangibly what was it
gunthorp shot me an enigmatic glance through his thicklensed spectacles it dawned upon you even now he asked
but chatham was leaning forward his red hair bristling with excitement
professor he exclaimed
that day we opened the box the feeling of mental shock
exactly
the professors bald head nodded
the box
he paused to enjoy the little dramatic moment he had created then he went on it was a theory of the early physicists and pseudophysicsts paracelsus in particular that atoms were of two classes the heavier and inert composing matter the lighter and more active composing mind
of course such an idea went into the discard even before the subdivisions of the atom were discovered but it is my belief that paracelsus came nearer to the truth than even he realized
if as millikan suggests all matter is merely a form of energy and my own experiments tend to bear this out then it is quite possible that the thing which we call mind or mental force is a form of this energy
whether the process of thought is its ordered releasing through the material chemistry of the brain or whether it is an independent quantity that acts through the brain need not concern us now
the important point is that such a quantity should be able to exist in the free state the same as any other of the known elements
if i am right then some sort of entity made up of this pure energy was imprisoned in the box which you found embedded in the meteor ask me how or by whom for those are questions beyond our power to answer
but when the box was opened this force was released to go about preying upon other mental forces just as we feed our material bodies with other material bodies
do you follow me
we did after a fashion although the idea behind his words seemed almost too fantastic for credence
chatham was running his fingers through his hair as if to aid in similating the professors startling statement
but it isnot logical he finally burst out
if the thing feeds upon mental power how did it manage to keep alive during all those hundreds of thousands of years that it was imprisoned in the box
perhaps feeds is an illchosen word gunthorp admitted
the entity if we can call it such could exist indefinitely without nourishment because it is composed of pure force and force is indestructible
it may be more accurate to liken it to a large blob of mercury which when liberated will draw smaller globules into itself
we considered this in silence then but if this thing remains at large it will go about attacking others as it attacked stanton and morse and later hellman
i exclaimed in horror
why if it isnot stopped it isnot beyond the bounds of possibility that it will eventually absorb into itself all the mental power of the world
is there no way to stop it or destroy it
destroy it no gunthorp answered gravely
however it is possible that we may be able to transmute it so that it will be rendered harmless and that is what we must try to do
it has long been a tenet of physics that force or energy is produced by the destruction of matter
in other words matter which is made up of minute particles may be changed into energy which is of wave composition
but recent experiment with light for example have shown that it possesses the characteristics of both particles and waves
this leads to the conclusion that the two are but different forms of the same thing and therefore interchangeable
but what has all that to do chatham began but the professor cut him short
think the old mans raving again do you he snapped
well hes not
what getting at if you had the brains to see it is that its as logical to convert energy into matter as it is to convert matter into energy
your energy transformer i exclaimed remembering his work at the university and suddenly seeing the light
exactly he replied
of course i canot guarantee that the thing will work satisfactorily since its still largely in the experimental stage
but at least we can try
if it fails he shrugged
well we will have to think of something else
the reversal of nature evening gunthorp sent off a long wire to his assistant ordering the shipment of several pieces of apparatus from his laboratory
two days later the equipment arrived a whole truckload of it
gunthorp did not unpack it but directed his assistant who had brought it personally to drive it down to the mouth of the cave have to carry it piece by piece into the outer cave and set it up there he announced prefer to have it in the inner cave but it would be impossible to get it through that narrow passage
the best we can do is coax the entity out to us
but how
i asked practically
you leave that to me was his only answer
it took us the better part of a week to set the machinery up to his satisfaction
during all of our operations we kept the cave brightly lighted with a number of kerosene lamps for as gunthorp pointed out the thing we were fighting struck only in darkness indicating that there was some property in light that drove it off
but even with the protection of the lamps it was eerie enough working in that ghostly bathung cavern knowing that just beyond the narrow passage in the inner chamber something lurked in wait something that fed upon mens minds
i will not attempt to describe the energy transformer other than to say that it bore a rough resemblance to those elaborate mechanisms used in experiments to smash the atom but built on a much smaller scale
it worked gunthorp explained by changing the lengthwise undulation of energy waves to sidewise or cross vibration which would bring about the transformation of pure energy into free atoms
when at last everything was in readiness gunthorp gave chatham and me our final instructions want you both to listen carefully and to do exactly as i tell you he began
his usual fussy bumptiousness was gone now and he seemed unnaturally grave
when we go into the cave we will extinguish all the lanterns
otherwise the thing will not come out where we are
then you wilder will start the generator while i go to the entrance of the narrow passage that leads to the inner cave
but professor i broke in do you realize what that means be placing yourself in the position of a human decoy to that monstrosity
yes yes i know he snapped with a momentary return of his old irritability
but the thing must be lured out somehow and thats the only way i can think of
however there will be little danger if chatham does precisely what i tell him
what do you want me to do
chatham asked a little uneasily want you to stand by the projector gunthorp explained
as soon as you hear me utter a sound either an intelligible word or otherwise you will release the transformer beam
leave it on for five minutes
if at the end of that time i have not returned to shut it off you must both get out of the cave as fast as you can
and leave you there
chatham exclaimed
not if be quiet you young idiot gunthorp interrupted testily do as i tell you
i know what about
his tone precluded further argument
we followed him obediently into the cave
one after another the lanterns were extinguished until only one remained
chatham held it until gunthorp had taken up his position at the entrance to the passage then it too was put out for what seemed an eternity we stood there in the darkness waiting
somewhere in that darkness we knew a malignant entity lurked something that fed upon mens minds and cast aside their bodies like discarded husks
to my overexcited imagination it seemed that this invisible horror was creeping up on me from all sides at once and i felt myself shrinking as if from a physical contact
abruptly voice came to us out of the blackness now he hissed
release the ray
with a feeling of relief that the suspense of waiting was over and definite action about to begin i heard chatham throw the switch
the next instant shall i ever describe what followed
there was no flash for the condenser ray was invisible nor was there any sound other than the steady hum of the generator
but suddenly the air around us became charged with the straining tension of a mighty struggle
a force that was intelligent but not tangible had been caught in the grip of a manmade force against which it was now fighting for its life
for nearly four minutes by the radium dial of my wrist watch the battle raged seeming all the more terrible because it was not physical
the air seemed to boil and swell like water churned up by the thrashing of a seaserpent in its death agony
and then at last when it seemed that we ourselves must be crushed by the mighty force of the conflict something snapped
of a sudden the tension was dissipated while the relieved atmosphere appeared to collapse like the sides of a balloon from which the straining gases have been released
the struggle was over
someone was groping toward the projector
it was gunthorp i recognized his voice as he stumbled over some piece of apparatus in the darkness
professor are you all right
i called anxiously
of course all right came his tart reply one of you idiots make a light before i break my neck
here let me chatham offered
he struck a match
there was a burst of flame accompanied by a terrific explosion
the walls of the cave rocked around us and rocks and dirt were rained down upon us
one large sized rock struck me upon the head when i regained consciousness i was lying upon my bunk back in and my shack
gunthorp was bending over me
for the first time since i had known him i surprised an expression almost of tenderness in his eyes
are you all right boy he asked
how do you feel
oh i guess live i grinned trying to ignore the pain in my head
tell me what happened
it was all my fault chatham put in
that match i struck it was my fault for being an old fool gunthorp cut him short should have known better than to have used the converter without testing its strength first
you see he explained the ray was much stronger than i had anticpated
thus instead of converting the energy entity into free electrons it condensed it into hydrogen atoms the lowest step in the atomic scale
then when at my direction chatham struck a match he made an expressive gesture
the highly inflammable nature of hydrogen did the rest chatham finished
it took the roof off the cave just above where you were standing and dropped a piece of it down on your head
with a start i sat up unmindful of the dizzying throbbing in my head
good lord
i cried in alarm
if the thing was converted into hydrogen and the hydrogen exploded then it was turned back into energy again know gunthorp nodded
but this time it was scattered by the force of the explosion and can do no damage
or at least he added grimly so i hope
and so far it seems that he is right
it is more than probable that the entity torn apart by the explosion was rendered utterly powerless
or if it was not it apparently profited by its bitter experiences in the world of men and fled back to the distant stars from which it came originally
but that is something i suppose we shall never know
god keep us from such things
we need more mind in the world not less
in the next issue of eerie and revelations form this shocking kaleidoscope of a mind crying not guilty dead woman by author of the thing in the collar the human termites etc found in the room cure a written confession
perhaps with his wife slightly con the police department felt it was fused a trifle bewildered too plain a case
at least it was but otherwise apparently normal
he handled intelligently and in a most made no effort to conceal his con scientific manner
the man was well duct any more than he did to the knife fed carefully bedded and the next in his hand or the pieces in the morning after being bathed and trunk shaved was taken to see a the inspector was an atrist officer of more than usual intelli the specialist in mental diseases gence and there was no effort made had the man comfortably seated to give the third degree or even se knowing he smoked he offered a cigar which was accepted
then in a quiet pleasant atmosphere he made one statement and one request am sure mr thompson that you had an excellent reason for acting as you did the other day
i wish you would tell me all about it man gazed at the psychiatrist
will you believe me if i tell you will accept every part of your story with the idea that you are convinced that you are telling me the truth
that is all i want whispered thompson
if everyone i talked to in the past had done that if they had even tried to check up on my story perhaps this would not have happened
but they always thought that i was the sick one and there was not one who was willing to accept my statement about the worms suppose that i was happily married
at least as much so as most men are
you know that there is a good deal of conflict between the sexes and there were a few differences of opinion between mrs thompson and myself
but not enough to cause serious difficulty
will you remember that
that we did not quarrel very much
about a year ago my wifes health began to give me considerable cause for worry
she started to fail
if you are a married man doctor you know there is always that anxiety about the wifes health
you become accustomed to living with a woman having her do things for you go to places with you and you think about how life would be if she should sicken and die
perhaps the fact that you are uneasy about the future makes you exaggerate the importance of her symptoms
at any rate she became sick developed a nasty cough and lost weight
i spoke to her about it and even bought a bottle of beef wine and iron at the drug store and made her take it
she did so to please me but she never would admit that she was sick
said it was fashionable to be thin and that the cough was just nervousness
she would not go to see a doctor
when i spoke to her mother about it the old lady just laughed at me said that if i tried to make lizzie a little happier she would soon get fat
in fact none of our family or our friends seemed to feel that there was anything wrong with mrs thompson so i stopped talking about it
of course it was not easy on me the way she coughed at night and her staying awake so much
i work hard in the daytime and it is hard to lose a lot of sleep
at last i was forced to ask her to let me sleep in the spare bedroom
even that did not help much
i could hear her cough and when she did fall asleep i would have to tiptoe into her room and see if she was all right
her coughing bothered me so much that when she did not cough it worried me more because i thought something had happened to her
one night the thing i was afraid of happened
she had a hard spell of coughing and then she stopped
it was quiet in the house
i could hear the clock on the landing tick and a mouse gnawing wood in the attic
i thought i could even hear my own heart beat but there was not a sound of any kind from the other bedroom
when i went in there and turned on the light i just knew it was all over
of course i was not sure
a bookkeeper is not supposed to be an expert in such matters so i went and telephoned for our doctor
on the way to the phone i wondered just what i should say for he had always insisted that my wife was in grand health
so i simply told him that mrs thompson was not looking well and would he come over
just like that i told him and tried to keep my voice steady
it was about an hour before he came
he went into the bedroom but i stopped at the doorway
he spent sometime listening to her heart and feeling her pulse and then he straightened up and said to me she is fine
just fast asleep
i wish i could sleep as soundly as that
what did you think was wrong
that surprised me so much that all i could do was to stammer some68 thing about not hearing her cough any more
he laughed worry too much about her mr thompson
right there my difficulty started
here was a doctor who was supposed to know his business and he said there was nothing wrong with my wife and there i was just a bookkeeper and i just knew what was the matter
what was i to do
tell him that he was wrong
send for another physician
it was growing light by that time so i went down to the kitchen and started the coffee
i often did that
then i shaved and made ready to go to the office
but before i went i sat down a while by the wifes bed
it bothered me but i had to keep telling myself that the doctor knew better than i did leaving the house i phoned to my motherinlaw
just told her that lizzie was not feeling well and would she come over and spend the day and she could get me at the office any time she called
then i left the house
it felt better out in the sunshine and after working a few hours over the books i almost laughed at myself for being so foolish
no telephone calls from the old lady
i arrived home at six and found the house lighted as usual
my wife and were waiting for me in the parlor and told me supper was ready
naturally i was surprised to see my wife out of bed
at the supper table i watched her just as carefully as i could without making the two of them suspicious of me
mrs thompson ate about as she usually did just pieced and minced at her food but i thought when she swallowed that the food went down with a jerk and there was a stiffness when she moved
but her mother did not seem to think there was anything wrong at least she did not make any comment
even when i went with her to the front door to say good night to her and we were alone there she never said a word to show that she thought her daughter was peculiar started to wash the dishes after that
i often washed the dishes at night while the wife sat in the front parlor watching the people go up and down past the house
after the kitchen was tidy i lit a cigar and went into the parlor and started a little conversation but mrs thompson never talked back
in fact i do not believe she ever talked to me after that though i am positive that she talked to the others
when the cigar was smoked i just said good night and went to bed
later i could hear her moving around in her room and then all was quiet so she must have gone to bed
she did not cough any more
i congratulated myself on that one thing because the coughing had kept me awake a good deal
during the night i lit a candle and shading it with my hand tiptoed in to see her
she had her eyes open but they were rolled back so all you could see was the whites and she was not breathing
at least i could not tell that she was breathing and when i held a mirror in front of her mouth there was no vapor on it
my mother had told me the purpose of that when i was a boy
the next day was just the same
my came and spent the day
i came home at night and ate supper with them and washed the dishes
the water was hot and it was a pleasure to make them clean
perhaps i took longer than usual at it because i did not fancy the idea of going into the front parlor where the wife was sitting looking out of the window
but i went in tonight without the usual cigar
i wanted to use my nose
it seemed there was a peculiar odor in the house like flowers that had been put in a vase of water and then forgotten for many days
perhaps you know the odor doctor a heavy one like lilies of the valley in a small closed room
it was specially strong in the parlor where mrs thompson was sitting and it seemed to come from her
i had to light the cigar after a while and by and by i said good night and went to bed
she never spoke to me in fact she did not seem to pay any attention to me
about two that morning i took the candle and went in to look at her
her eyelids were open and her eyeballs were rolled back just like they had been the night before but now her jaw was dropped and her cheeks sunk in
i just could not do anything but telephone for a doctor and this time i picked out a total stranger just picked his name out of the telephone book haphazard
what good did it do
none at all
he came he examined mrs thompson very carefully and he simply said that he did not see anything wrong with her and then down in the front hall he turned on me and asked me just why i had sent for him and what i thought was the matter with her
of course i just could not tell him the truth with his being a doctor and i being just a bookkeeper went to the mountains next day for the summer and that left us alone
breakfast as usual and to the office and not a word all day from the house
when i came back at night the house was lit and supper was on the table and the wife at her end as usual and the food served and on the plates
she ate but her movements were slower and when she swallowed you could see the food go down by jerks and her eyes were sunken into the sockets and seemed shiny and well like the eyes of a fish on the stalls
there were flowers on the table but the smell was something different it was sweeter and when i took a deep breath it was just hard for me to go on eating the pork chops and potatoes
you see it was summer time and warm and in spite of the screens there was a fly or two in the house and when i saw one walking around on her lip and she not making any effort to brush it off i just couldnot keep on eating
had to go and start washing the dishes
perhaps you can understand how i felt doctor
things looked rather odd
the next day i phoned to the office that i would not be there and i sent for a taxi and took mrs thompson to a first class specialist
he must have been good because he charged me twentyfive dollars just for the office call
i went in first and told him just exactly what i was afraid of and i did not mince my words and then we had the wife in
he examined her even her blood and all the satisfaction i got was that she seemed a trifle anaemic but that i had better take a nerve tonic and a vacation or i would be sick
things looked rather twisted after that
either i was right and everybody else wrong or they were right and i was just about as wrong mentally as a man could be
but i had to believe my senses
a man just has to believe what he sees and hears and feels and when i thought over that office visit and the wife smiling and the doctor sticking her finger for the blood to examine it just seemed impossible
anaemic
why that was a simple word to describe her condition
that night the flies were worse than usual
i went to the corner store and bought a fly spray and used it in her bedroom but they kept coming in the big blue ones you know
seemed as though they just had to come in and i could not keep them off her face so at last in desperation i covered her head up with a towel and went to sleep
i had to work the interest on the mortgage was due and the man wanted something on the principal and it was a good house and all i had in the world to show for twenty years of hard work keeping books
the next day was just like all the days had been except that i made more mistakes with the books and my boss spoke to me about it
and when i arrived home supper was not ready though mrs thompson was in the parlor and the lights on
the heavy odor was worse than usual and there were a lot of flies
you could hear them buzz and strike against the electric lights
i got my own supper but i couldnot eat much thinking of her in the parlor and the flies settling on her open mouth
she just sat there that night in the parlor till i went to her and took her arm to lead her up the stairs
she was cold and on each cheek there was a heavy purple blotch forming
once she was in her room she seemed to move around so i left her alone and when i went into her room later on she was in bed
it had been a hard week for me so i sat down by her bed and tried to think but the more i thought the worse things seemed
the night was hot and the flies kept buzzing just thinking of the past and how we used to go to the movies together and laugh and sometimes come near crying and how we used to bluff about the fact that perhaps it was just as well we didnot have a child so long as we had each other knowing all the time that she was eating her heart out for longing to be a mother and blaming me for her loneliness
the thinking was too much for me so i thought i might as well smoke another cigar and go to bed and try to keep better books the next day and hold my job and then i saw the little worm crawl out
right then and there i knew that something had to be done
it didnot make any difference what the doctors or her mother said something had to be done and i was the one who had to do it telephoned for an undertaker
met him downstairs
tt will be a private funeral i told him and no publicity and i think after you are through you will have no trouble obtaining a physicians certificate
he went up stairs
in about five minutes he came down stairs must have gone to the wrong room he said
the second story front bedroom i replied the woman there is not dead he said paid him for his trouble and shut the door in his face
was i helpless
doctor you have to believe me
i was at the end of my rope
i had tried every way i knew and there was not anything left to do
no one believed me
no one agreed with me
it seemed more and more as though they thought i was insane impossible to keep her in the house longer
my health was giving way
woricmg all day at figures that were going wrong all the time and coming back night after night cooking my supper and sleeping in a room next to the thing that had been my wife
what with the smell of lilies of the valley and the buzz of flies and the constant dread in my mind of how things would be the next day and the next week and the mortgage due
i had to do something
and it seemed to me that she wanted me to
it seemed that she recognized that things were not right that she was entitled to a different kind of an ending
i tried to put myself in her place and i knew what i would want done with me if things were reversed
so i brought the trunk up from the cellar
we had used that trunk on our wedding trip and every summer since on our vacations and i thought that she would be more at peace in that trunk than in a new one
but when i had the trunk by her bed i saw at once that it was too small unless i used a knife
that seemed to be the proper thing to do and i was sure that it would not hurt her
for days she had been past hurting
i told her i was sorry but it just had to be done and if people had just believed me things could have been arranged in a nicer way
then i started
things were confused after that seem to remember a scream and blood spurting and the next thing there were a lot of people in the house and they arrested me
and that is the peculiar part of it all doctor
perhaps you do not know it but i am accused of murdering my wife
now i have told you all about it doctor and i just want to ask you one question
if you had been in my place day after day and night after night what would you have done doctor
what would any man have done who loved his wife
the vengeance of ai the ancient goddess of the chaldeans stilt exacts tribute in the valley of the moon
by author of portrait of ladies etc do you see them running running margaret levering left me in london she said there is something that canot wait out there peter
i knew that whatever she implied had to do with her father then four months dead but margaret would tell me nothing more
she went on to cairo alone as she wished
but when six weeks parsed with only the brief and strained notes from her i knew something was wrong and followed her
at the hotel continental in cairo late one afternoon in october i had barely finished bathing when a boy appeared with a sealed note for me although i had informed no one of my arrival
i ripped it open and read dear mr harris i understand you have just come from london and i assume you are led here by your interest in the welfare of margaret levering the now lady warrender who is in cairo at the hotel memphis and who has more than once spoken of you
please be so good as not to refer in any way to her father the late lord warrender nor to his recent excavations and unfortunate death in the valley of the moon
i should be glad to talk this unusual request over with you as between mutual friends of lady warrender if you should so desire
may i respectfully urge you to see me before you see lady warrender
you will find me in room of this hotel
ask for ernest lumsden
ernest lumsden
i had never heard of him be so good as not to refer in any way to her father he had written
why not
margaret was perfectly aware of her fathers excavations and knew almost as much of archeology anthropology and egyptology as he had known himself
why make no mention of something that had been headlined in every newspaper and journal in the english speaking world lord warrender had been crushed to death by a falling statue in the templetomb of ai goddess of the moon
i remembered again in my hotel room how bravely margaret had taken his death
they were adventurers those two and the true adventurer is always ready to meet what providence may have in store for him
i knocked loudly at number the door opened almost immediately and i found myself confronted by an elderly gentleman whose not unkind face was lined with wrinkles
his hair was sparse and white yet he could not have been much over fifty
may i see mr lumsden
i inquired am mr lumsden
come in thank you
i walked past him into the room
when he had closed the door again he turned to me
peter harris he asked
i nodded curtly
it was good of you to come
he turned slightly and indicated a youngish man whom i had not noticed before
allow me to present the sheikh aljubal mr peter harris
the egyptian wore a white drill suit and carried a cane except for the turban binding his swarthy head he might easily have been mistaken for an englishman browned by the hot african sun
the sheikh bowed
i to lumsden again confess that i found your note surprising i said
may i know its meaning
lord warrender was my best friend lumsden began quietly his eyes steadily on me
had i so much as set foot in london in the past twenty years you would no doubt have known of me before this
as a dear friend of her late father i am naturally interested in lady warrender
i nodded
the sheikh aljubal he went on indicating once more the silent egyptian also knew her father well
his intimate acquaintance with the history and present state of the valley of the moon proved invaluable to lord warrender in his work here
during an acquaintance that was at first a matter of convenience these two came to regard each other with deep respect and friendship
he paused hope you can see harris that in us you have two friends interested only in lady welfare
the old mans manner and speech convinced me of his integrity appreciate that i said
good he said nodding abruptly
do you know the history of the tombs in the valley of the moon he asked afraid i donot
my knowledge of egyptology is practically nil and in these more unusual matters i confess i know nothing at all
lumsden turned to the sheikh
tell him aljubal
the sheikh addressed me for the first time since our introduction
i looked at this dark man with the heavy black beard the beetling brows the thin lips
he spoke in a low pleasant voice
ai the moon goddess is not egyptian yet she is the goddess of that accursed valley worshiped and revered by many of our natives even today
he paused as if searching for a point at which to begin and presently went on
long years ago a wealthy chaldean merchant left his native land for egypt
he came personally to barter his finest wares with princes and his stay was climaxed by his fortunate marriage to an egyptian lady of quality
the family founded by that marriage was one of the richest and most influential during that whole period and the wealthy merchant found egypt so to his liking that he made his home here as many others have done since
when he died the question of burial arose
despite his family and his importance he was not egyptian
he desired burial under the protection of his own gods
so a tomb was built in what has since been called the valley of the moon
there his mummy was laid
and though he was the only foreigner in that resting place ai chaldean goddess of the moon continued as the protecting deity of the valley and of the people buried there
in the innermost chamber of that first tomb in the valley there is a colossal statue of ai
around her neck is suspended a giant pectoral of gold an disk symbol of the divine power of ai
these facts were brought to light by lord warrender
his labor had brought him to this inner chamber and it was there that his work was so unfortunately cut short
the egyptian ceased abruptly and settled back
was it that statue that crushed him
i asked
lumsden nodded
yes it was the great statue of ai that toppled from its base and killed lord warrender in its fall
the accident occurred when he attempted to remove the golden amulet from the neck of the colossus it odd that a statue of that size should topple
i asked
no one thought of that until the sheikh and i got to looking into the matter said lumsden
lord warrender had spoken of the statue to us pointing out that it was attached very firmly to its base
so firmly indeed that he made much of the fact that it would be extremely difficult to do anything with it
yet the next day it fell crushing him
could lord warrender have been deceived
perhaps it only seemed firmly attached
i ventured shrugged his shoulders but the look on his face showed his scorn for my suggestion that lord warrender might have been in error
perhaps you will think that we too were deceived when the sheikh and i found the statue of ai restored to its base when we visited the tomb after burial
before i could reply the sheikh aljubal cut in suddenly there were other things
do not forget them lumsden
mr harris perhaps thinks that worshiping natives crept into the templetomb at night and righted the statue
lumsden spread his hands
yes he said perhaps he does
as a matter of fact that was exactly what i had been thinking
but lumsden went on almost forgotten there were other things
the terror of the natives when they saw the statue of ai and the eightrayed moondisk and their subsequent flight
they were afraid of something screamed out something about a curse and went positively frantic when lord warrender suggested removing the amulet from about the neck of the statue
when lord warrender went down into the crypt to take the amulet only two white aides were with him
the natives would not go near the tomb nor can any of them be induced to enter the tomb even now
only the two white men saw the statue topple and fall just as lord warrender was about to remove the golden disk and since then one of those two men has died a mysterious and unaccountable death
what are you implying
i asked
the sheikh aljubal interposed
it is not a time to beat about the bush he said
the matter is clear for those who wish to see
the desecrator of templetomb is cursed nothing can save him from death
i smiled halfheartedly with an insolent superiority which i did not quite feel
am i expected to take this seriously
i asked
aljubal frowned impatiently and lumsden looked irritated
then the sheikh spoke again with a scornful gesture in my direction
perhaps mr harris will consider more seriously the as yet unexplained death of lord successor herbert lanseer
he was found just outside the templetomb of ai
he seemed to have been beaten or crushed to death
there were strange marks tiie marks of the guardians of ai those invisible spirits who have been set to guard the valley of the moon and those sleeping there
i felt uneasy
if it was this sort of nonsense
well what has all this got to do with lady warrender
i demanded
everything in the world said lumsden quietly
lady warrender is somewhat less skeptical than you
i was astounded do you mean to say that margaret scientist that she is actually believes her father to have been killed by the vengeance of ai and that other man lanseer i think you called him
lumsden looked away sighing gently
yes he said she believes that and more
she believes much more
there is another native belief which might interest you
and that i asked finding it somewhat difficult to keep the scorn i felt from my voice
the sheikh spoke again
as ai cursed her fathers life so has ai cursed his death
as she avenged herself on his body so she still avenges herself on his invisible soul
she has condemned his spirit by the power of her curse to run always with the guardians of the valley when they go from tomb to tomb on the night of the full moon
sometimes mr harris they have been seen
have you seen them
i asked sharply
no said lumsden at once but it is not always necessary to see
i came to my feet
i took my hat from the table
thank you i said for your kind intentions
but this sounds like pretty tall stuff to me sorry
i walked toward the door
but before i reached it the door swung open and a native garbed in conventional english clothes burst into the room
something had happened that concerned the two men to whom i had been speaking for both stared at the stranger with apprehensive faces
after a quick glance at me he addressed lumsden and the sheikh
lattal has been found
near the tomb where you thought
his head is beaten in like the others lanseer and weatherbee
lumsden and the sheikh looked at me
i felt my confident superiority crumbling
i turned from the door looking from lumsden to the sheikh
who is lattal
i asked but already a premonition was forming in my mind
lattal said lumsden was the other of the two men who saw the statue crush lord warrender
weatherbee was the first
both of them left their hotel at dead of night without a word to anyone
lattal went as if in a daze as if some power outside himself was drawing him away from the city
is it asking too much of you to believe that death is linked to the other three by the power of curse
or do you think these deaths a series of remarkable coincidences mr harris
it was with a confidence i was far from feeling that i hedged
stranger coincidences have happened
i turned to the door again with an effort
lumsden was there before me
xisten
harris he said not unkindly know how difficult belief must be for you
i understand your attitude
but remember margaret
you donot realize the nervous condition this has brought her to
go to her if you must but do not mention her father
if she chooses to bring him up herself there is nothing to be done about it trying to keep her mind off it urging her to go back to london got to help
i put out my hand and took his nothing like better than to see lady warrender back in london i said
nothing
you may count on me but as for this supernatural business thats out absolutely understand
but margaret will not return until she is convinced that her fathers spirit is not bound to run with the guardians of the templetomb of ai
then you yourself do not believe
i asked quickly
you misunderstand me harris
i do he replied quietly
but the important thing is to convince margaret that the legend is untrue
he bowed slightly and opened the door
the sheikh aljubal raised his hand in a farewell gesture
i heard lumsden sigh as i walked past him into the hall
i went out into the bright streets of cairo heading for the hotel memphis and margaret
i admit that my confidence was severely shaken something i had not cared to show lumsden and the sheikh
yet i could not wholly believe in a mythical curse
nor could i believe that margaret so sure of herself and her science margaret so serene so rational and urbane could credit the existence of such a curse
i brushed the suggestion aside looking forward to seeing her again and thought that by christmas we could be married
i looked for margaret on the green terrace of the hotel memphis
in a moment i saw her sitting alone by a table just under the wall
her face was pressed into her hands and her attitude was strangely dejected
i walked quickly to where she sat and stopped beside her
she was not aware of me until i said hello
then she lifted her head slowly and looked up at me
she smiled and came to her feet
peter you surprised me she cried but her voice was listless
is that your only welcome
i asked gently chiding glad you came peter so glad
i need you for a moment there was intensity in her voice and an unusual emphasis
perhaps lumsden had been right after all come to take you back to london i said watching her closely hopefully
she looked at me her face expressionless donot know when i can go back
i watched her face
under her large hat i saw her heavily shadowed eyes the line of strain across her forehead the frightened expression of her lips something wrong with you my dear i said you tell me what it is a time she said nothing
yes i thought lumsden was right
she is going to tell about it now
i had the uneasy belief that she was going to reiterate everything lumsden and the sheikh aljubal had already told me
you remember asid my fathers servant who stayed here in cairo after his death
i nodded
he was very dear to us
he had always been utterly faithful scrupulously honest
about a week before i left london i had a letter from him
in it he said that there were strange things happening about the tomb o ai in the valley of the moon
there were stories of weird ghostly figures running each night the moon rose full asid had seen them he wrote
and one of them was my father
she trembled a little
at first i didnot believe it
but it worked on me it grew on me
the idea of the spirit of my father haunting the valley of the moon together with the native guardian spirits became so terrible that i had to come and i will not return to london until i have seen with my own eyes that my father is not there
i said you donot believe that margaret
she looked at me donot know she said
there are strange things here in egypt stories of weird unbelievable curses
i brushed this aside impatiently
she broke into speech again
on the night of the last full moor i went out there with asid
he insisted that i come
an old friend of my fathers went along ernest lumsden
i went because i wanted to prove to him that there was nothing could be nothing
mr lumsden did not want me to go
but i went
i donot know what it was i saw
i think it was my father
there was something yes
but perhaps it was because of asid believing in it so strongly
we stood a little way from the tomb of ai
suddenly he clutched my wrist in his hand pressed it hard in his excitement and said there
do you see them lady running running and i thought i did naked natives and my father dressed as he was when he died
peter got to see it through
tomorrow is another full moon going out there again without asid
this time make sure
tomorrow morning early
ernest lumsden and the sheikh aljubal are going too
and i want you to come
i need you with me
and if there is nothing
i said
will you go back to london with me
she nodded
i imagine that our cavalcade starting slowly out of cairo before dawn the next morning would have seemed an ordinary tourists expedition to the casual observer
he would have seen a lady and three men the ladys maid and two guides
our horses took us out of the gray city and into the shadowed desert
lumsden went ahead with a motorlorry carrying a searchlight and tenting equipment
we hoped to reach the valley of the moon before the hottest part of the day though it was a good seventy miles out of cairo
in the desert with cairo already disappearing under the dunes behind us the first glimmerings of dawn breaking in the sky our purpose seemed vague and faraway to me
once at the valley of the moon the guides helped us throw up the tents
water was drawn under the palms that sheltered the tombs and rugs were spread
then with the guides on guard the rest of us retired to the shelter of our tents and there we rested until the sun had set that night
in the shadowy evening we ate a light supper and the guides prepared rugs before the tents for the watch
a camp chair was put in place for margaret to rest on
the sudden night of the desert came down with startling abruptness
our camp was enshrouded in blackness with the dying campfire nickering near the tents
sitting there i heard the sheikh aljubal call to lumsden is the searchlight in order
lumsden called back yes take care of it
i began to wonder suddenly why a searchlight had been brought but my thoughts were diverted by the faint yellow light that came suddenly into being above the edge of the desert and then the rim of the round moon began its slow climb over the horizon
we waited tensely saying little watching for the moment when the moon would be wholly above the sand when the faint reddish glow would strike the entrance to the great tomb of ai
margaret strained forward her eyes fixed on the now hazily lighted row of tombs
there was not a sound in the night
i felt uneasy
are you all right dear
i whispered did not turn but i felt her hand on mine
she nodded quickly not wanting to speak
then suddenly she started forward
listen she murmured tensely
the moon had topped the desert
i looked into her face
at that moment the sheikh shouted
the light lumsden the light and before eyes were focused on the tomb of ai again the great white light was trained there moving slowly across the face of the tomb then away down the line of tombs in the valley of the moon
a sudden wind had come up a rushing sound in the night
slowly the ray moved from tomb to tomb
margaret leaning forward tensely watching its path
but there was nothing living in its light
back came the ray again to the great tomb of ai and once more it descried a circle
there was nothing and the sudden strange wind died as suddenly as it came
margaret fell back in her chair
nothing she murmured
peter there was nothing
of course not i exulted
of course not
it was asid wishing so intensely to believe in his native legends she went on
she turned radiant eyes on me start for england this week tomorrow
we turned in to get what sleep we could before our early trek back
but i could not sleep
i lay for what seemed a long time awake in the stillness
and then abruptly i heard the sound of hushed voices and the peculiar padding of feet in the sand
i rose on my elbow and listened
then i crept stealthily to the opening in the tent and peered out
lumsden and the sheikh were walking rapidly toward the tomb of ai
in a moment i was out of the tent and had joined them readily enough that these two were likewise unable to sleep
i wanted to jibe at them for their belief in the legend which i had seen disproved yet i could not come directly out and speak
tell me i asked after whispered greetings had been exchanged why did you move that searchlight so slowly
it was necessary for me to approximate the speed of running men replied lumsden without a moments hesitation had to keep them in that blinding light so that she wouldnot see
good god lumsden donot tell me you still believe both he and the sheikh smiled gently
together we came to a stop stick was pointing downward and both lumsden and aljubal were looking at the sand
we were standing just outside the great tomb of ai
i looked down
there in the sand i knew unmolested by wind for there had been very little wind all that night were little pits as if many feet had been running there
then a cry escaped me
before me in the center of that running line i saw a single track a deeper track a track that showed clear and distinct on the wettish sand under the overhanging palm trees the track of feet wearing shoes even as i looked the sheikh began methodically to scuff away the traces following the wide circle while lumsden went back along the trail
all my cocksure confidence had left me
i understood that these two were obliterating this definite proof of the curse of ai so that margaret might not see in the morning
lumsden turned to me
the first part of the task i have set for myself is finished harris
margaret will return to london now and you must go with her
before i leave the valley of the moon in the morning i am going to try to break the curse that binds spirit to the tomb of ai
then i will help you i said rashly
a quick glance flashed between the sheikh and lumsden
i detected approval in the eyes and felt strengthened in my resolve
lumsden did not protest and in consequence i witnessed a phenomenon which has immeasurably strengthened my belief in the powers of light and darkness
lumsden and the sheikh had come prepared
a large circle was first drawn in the sand a short distance away from the templetomb of ai and both lumsden and the sheikh stepped within
but when i made as if to follow them they waved me back
you can help best harris by mounting guard over lady tent said lumsden
you will be able to watch quite clearly and should anything approach the tent you will be there
i did not argue but returned at once to the tent
nevertheless i went back with a sharp feeling of disappointment
i took my stand near the opening of tent and watched the strange ceremony that took place within the circle the sheikh had drawn in the sand
it was the sheikh who began the ceremony murmuring a cryptic incantation in his native language
presently the great door of the tomb of ai began to glow a weird reddish fire seeming to spread over it outlining it
then suddenly a group of strange lifeless figures began to drift from the closed door naked natives padding automatically outward toward the circle occupied by lumsden and they moved toward the circle white and ghostly stretching out their arms toward the two who sat there yet unable to break into the circle
they passed around it billowing forward and back like a wave a silent sea of ghastly horror
a feeling of terror crept into me i dared not think what might happen should these figures from the tomb turn toward tent attention was attracted to the tomb for from it emerged a single figure white and still lord warrender
his diaphanous shape was clear and distinct
his rugged face was drawn tight emotionless
he came forward slowly toward the circle
i glanced hastily toward the sheikh and lumsden
they were leaning excitedly forward and lumsden had moved to the very edge of the circle oblivious to the hands stretched out toward him held back only by that invisible wall created in some manner by the strange magic known to the sheikh
the shadowy lord warrender approached the circle and as he arrived at its outer edge the sheikh rose up and thundered forth a sentence that scattered the native spirits reaching toward the two in the circle
at that moment lumsden broke the circle and lord vague form drifted through
at once lumsden closed the circle again
then a strange thing happened
the ghostly shadow of lord warrender began to collapse sinking into the ground
only when it had completely disappeared did the sheikh turn his attention again to the guardian spirits of the tomb of ai
he began now to drive them back into the tomb
they fought silently to reach beyond the circle then gradually their ghastly intent weakened they turned reluctantly and shuffled in weird procession back to the tomb through the door of which they returned as they had come
the glow began to fade away from the tomb and in a few moments the sheikh and lumsden left the circle and came wearily over to me
i went forward to meet them
he will run no more harris said lumsden
then he looked gently at the tent which hid margaret from us shook his head a little and said take care of her and get her away at once in the morning
i donot want her here if anything should happen
it is not always easy to break a curse and sometimes there is a penalty
i disregarded his enigmatic words then
but a month later a letter came from lumsden
it was a letter of farewell
he wrote at some length rambling on for pages but the point of his letter lay in his last pathetic paragraph aljubal was found today near the tomb
he went from the hotel in the night like the others drawn by a power we are unable to combat
soon i must go too
i have been given a short period of grace i feel but the end is in sight
i told you that it is not easy for mere man to break an ancient curse as we did that night on the desert and i foresaw what might happen
that is why i did not let you come into the circle with us so that the vengeance of ai might not pursue you as it has pursued and as it must pursue me soon
we must pay with our lives for breaking the curse of ai
the letter i sent in answer was returned marked cannot be found
inquiries i set on foot brought forward little
ernest lumsden had been seen walking from his hotel one night shortly after twelve
that was the last seen of him
yet i know what happened
i have spared margaret now my wife this knowledge and hope that no hint of the fate of lumsden and the sheikh aljubal ever reaches her
i do not think it will

english dictionary a very old house indeed
dale eliot notebook in hand iceblue eyes intently absorbed moved almost reverently over the duststrewn floor stopping here and there to examine articles of furniture which dated back to the late seventeenth century
some pieces even antedated this
dale eliot was a professional antiquarian
he lived and breathed and had his being in the past
his emotions were so completely out of harmony with the modern world that he frightened people
all men have roots deep the past and when dale eliot talked he brought the past to life
there was something ghostly about him
he seemed to have stepped from the past into the present a frozen swimmer emerging from the river of time near its dim beginnings with the hoary foam of centuries clinging to his garments
but in this old witch house dale eliot was in his element
the witch house had been converted into a museum for the edification of summer tourists
it was the third oldest house in salem and it stood on a high windswept bluff overlooking salem harbor
it did not attract tourists as the house of seven gables did
it was a drab squat little house with a gambrel roof that did not jut out as gambrel roofs should
bleakly it faced the harbor presenting to the town merely a windowless expanse of weathereroded wood which impressed antiquarians but left normal people cold
dale eliot was in all respects the exact opposite of a normal person
he moved about in a kind of trance examining objects which were unique in the annals of salem
a spinning wheel which had once belonged to a notorious witch a dogeared prayer book annotated in the curious cramped calligraphy of the reverend increase mather dour son of a grim and relentless father dour father of a son who had left red thumb prints on the darkest pages of new england history
all of the treasured antiques were roped off but eliot was contemptuous of the do not touch signs scattered about the room
when he saw an object which attracted him he approached it crept under the ropes and examined it with his hands
he liked the feel of old things
now he was examining a cabinet of drawers which stood under a smallpaned window on the north side of the room
examining it all over running his hands over it in critical appraisal and even pulling the drawers in and out as he crouched in the gloom
too bad too bad he murmured
the panels are badly warped
he was tugging at the lowermost drawer and balancing himself precariously on his instep when the little figure emerged
it emerged so unobtrusively that he did not notice it until it was standing almost directly beneath his hand blinking up at him in the dim yellow light which suffused the ancient room weirdly
the figure was scarcely three inches in height a tiny shriveled human baroque with pointed ears and a thin hairy tail
peaked and duncolored it stood very still on the top of the cabinet and stared malignly up at him its tiny face repulsively puckered its shoulders hunched and misshapen flesh congealed
instinctively he retreated a pace his pupils dilating his breath hissing from between his teeth
do not be alarmed dale eliot shrilled the little horror am your familiar
i have waited here for you throughout the years
familiar gasped eliot his face corpse white
yes
your family familiar
your was a member of a covin in good standing
i attached myself to all of your ancestors
you were born in this house you remember dale eliot
eliot passed a trembling hand across his brow knew that i was born in salem he said
but i did not remember the house
my mother died when i was a child
i was brought up by relatives in boston
the little figure nodded grimly
well dale we are together again
i remember you as an infant rosycheeked smiling but with the mark of his satanic majesty already upon you
you mean my ancestors were witches
eliot asked in a small voice figure nodded
yes dale
witches and warlocks
your entire family attached themselves to his satanic majesty far back in the seventeenth century
before eliot could protest or cry out the little figure leaped upon him
tiny clawlike hands fastened on his clothes and clung
with a cry eliot staggered back across the room his fingers clutching at his chest the little horror was burrowing under his shirt when the guard rushed angrily into the room
the guard was a big heavyset man of portuguese extraction dressed in summer linens
look here sir he exclaimed
you canot yell like that in here
this is a private house which is only open for antickarians
eliot did not reply
he was backed up against the wall his fingers clawing at his chest
the little figure was burrowing into his flesh
he could feel it squirming about under his clothes
the guard said drunk eh
a fine thing
and you a grown man
he jerked a thumb toward the doorway of the room
out he said
if you donot get out under your own steam help you out
eliot got out
he staggered blindly out of the room and down a winding flight of stairs to the street
the sunlight was clear and bright over salem when he emerged on the high windswept hill overlooking the harbor
but when he reached his lodgings a halfmile away the sun westering was spilling down like blood splashingly ensanguining the gambrel roofs and red brick chimney pots of the old houses and turning the waters of salem harbor a deep rosy pink room was on the top floor of a threestory frame house on a winding waterfront street where hollyhocks bloomed
he was trembling uncontrollably when he crossed a wellkept lawn and ascended a porch which creaked beneath his tread blue eyes a mixture of stupefaction and terror he fumbled for his keys let himself into the house and mounted three flights of stairs to his attic room
he locked the door of the room before he crossed to the window and sat down on a narrow cotlike bed
he sat down on the edge of the bed and removed his coat
he was wearing a soft linen shirt and black bow tie
he ripped off the tie unbuttoned the shirt and removed it ripped off his undershirt the little baroque was clinging to his chest its tiny hands were buried wristdeep in his flesh
all about it there was a glistening crimson circle a halo of bright blood
for an instant he stared down in silence at the tiny shriveled form
so great were his horror and revulsion that for an instant the room swayed about him
for an instant he thought he was going to faint the tiny shape was staring maliciously up at him in the red sunlight which poured in through the open window crimsoning the sheets of the bed
from its narrow sloping skull two tiny black horns sprouted
in the dim light of the old house eliot had failed to notice the horns
utter horror engulfed him as he stared
the little baroque said it will take three days
when i have firmly attached myself i will never leave you
eliot spoke to it then
he scarcely recognized his own voice
it seemed like a whisper from the grave
you mean your hands will grow into my flesh
yes dale
the wounds will heal and your flesh will become covin flesh and will obey the commands of his satanic majesty
see i have made grooves for my hands
eventually the wounds will heal
the little horror leaped suddenly from his chest to the sunreddened windowsill and stood perilously poised in the crimson glow mocking him
the two deep grooves where its hands had rested were welling redly
the little baroque said night is falling
i must sleep
eliot went perfectly white when the little horror leaped back upon him inserted its hands into the encrimsoned grooves and coiled up in an attitude of repose
sleep dale it murmured as its eyelids flickered shut
you will not resent me so much tomorrow
and in the months and years to come you will not resent me at all
how eliot passed the night he never knew
his thoughts were feverish delirious
he twisted and turned a dark ferment in his brain
twisted and turned until the dawn broke in the east outside the window of his room
when he awoke sunlight was flooding the attic room
a confused and merciful forgetfulness pervaded his faculties
slowly his drowsy eyes took in the familiar contours of the room the sloping rafters of the ceiling that came to a triangular focus high above his head the oaken chest where his clothes lay a dresser with a photograph of his mother and a brush comb and handmirror familiarly arranged upon it
then he glanced down at the sheet which covered him and the horror came rushing back filling him with unutterable terror and loathing
across the white sheet there stretched a long trail of tiny bloody footprints
with a despairing cry he threw the sheets off and glanced down at his naked torso
the little shape was stirring restlessly in his flesh
suddenly it opened its eyes and stared up at him
good morning dale it said
he made no attempt to dislodge it
he could not bring himself to touch it
shaking in every limb he arose from the bed and put on his clothes
he dressed swiftly while the little horror mocked him wounds in flesh were of a deep violaceous hue
the blood had darkened coagulated
slowly the little malign baroque withdrew its hands and leaped to the windowsill
it watched mockingly while eliot struggled into his shirt and drew on his coat
the big clock in the hall outside was ticking slowly when eliot descended the stairs to the street
the little horror was squirming in his flesh again twisting about restlessly under his shirt
eliot usually glanced at the morning paper before he let himself out
but now he simply pulled the paper from beneath the door and stuffed it in his coat pocket going down the steps of the porch and crossing the lawn with the swaying gait of a drunken man
his one thought was to escape from the horror by seeking the companionship of normal people
to escape for an instant from his terror by mingling with normal men and women
perhaps it was all a mad illusion
perhaps he was entirely mad
he must find out
when he arrived at the little restaurant where he usually had breakfast he had reached a momentous decision
he would enter the restaurant sit down and tear the horror from his flesh
he would expose it to the gaze of the people about him
he had to share the horror
it was driving him mad
at the little restaurant where he usually had breakfast he would meet people he knew
kindly sympathetic people
he must find out
the restaurant was less crowded than usual
unsteadily he crossed to a table in a far corner picked up a menu and glanced furtively about him
none of his acquaintances was having breakfast at the restaurant this morning
the people who were sitting there were complete strangers to him
nevertheless he was determined to bring the horror into view
he could imagine what they would say
god what a ghastly thing
what can it be like a little man
he could see the patrons of the restaurant rising in sudden terror upsetting their coffeecups sending plates crashing to the floor
but he had to have human sympathy and understanding
he had to know
he was fumbling with the buttons of his shirt when he heard the man at the adjoining table say no they canot explain it
he was found in his shop with his head bitten off
chewed off
the medical examiner said it looked like a rat had chewed through the flesh of his throat
there were two men at the adjoining table
now the second man was speaking
and they found little red footprints all over the shop
human footprints a tenth of an inch in length
now thats a puzzler for you
ghastly said the first man
he raised a cup of coffee to his lips
eliot saw his apple rise and fall rise and fall
he was drinking all the scalding coffee at a single draught as though the scalding horror in his mind was so unbearable that he had to scald his throat to keep from thinking of it
suppose we talk about something else said the second man
yeah lets all in the papers anyway
we can read about it later on
with trembling fingers eliot ripped the salem morning chronicle from his pocket and spread it out on the table before him
the headlines fairly screamed at him antiquarian found murdered
and in smaller type beneath joseph taylor prominent antiquarian of this city was found gruesomely murdered this morning in his antique shop at elm street
mr taylor who has living quarters at the rear of the shop was found at am by eliot rose from the table
choking his face livid he staggered out of the restaurant into the blinding sunlight
the sunlight smote his eyes dazzling and halfblinding him
indifferent to the glare clutching at his throat he reeled drunkenly down the street
disturbed by his reeling gait the little baroque crept from beneath his shirt and stared coldly up at him
well what is the matter now
what is the matter with you dale eliot
you killed him eliot choked
joseph taylor my friend
yesterday afternoon when i left his shop he was alive and well
the little baroque shrilled yes i know
you were furiously angry with him when you left the shop
he tried to cheat you
he attempted to sell you a spurious antique
you swore to get even with him dale
but i didnot really mean it eliot choked didnot know dale listen to me
i killed him because you hated him
i am your faithful familiar
a familiar is pledged to execute its masters wishes
all wizards magicians and warlocks have evil wishes
eliot screamed you murderous little devil
his fingers went out and raked across his chest
agilely the little horror leaped aside and climbed to shoulder where it leered up into his face in malign derision
of course i am a devil
a demon a little devil
eliot groaned will crush you to death
i will strangle you with my hands
the little shape shrilled you cannot destroy me dale
i would slip from your grasp
i am elastic indestructible
then i will destroy myself no dale
i will grow into your flesh and you will cease to hate me
a child ran so swiftly past him that eliot did not at first realize that he was not alone with the horror on the sundappled pavement
he did not know that a little girl on her way to school had been watching him with wide wondering eyes and had now run swiftly by
the child had seen the little figure perched on his shoulder and was running screaming away from him her school books clutched tightly in her arms her pigtails flying
suddenly she dashed out into the street was so immersed in horror that he saw the child merely as a white blur moving swiftly through the sunlight
the street climbed steeply to a bluff overlooking the bay
the child was running up the street but the automobile was coming down
it was coming down with a screeching of brakes and although the man in the car was trying desperately to avoid running down the child he had seen her too late to swerve aside
the screeching brakes jarred eliot from his daze
his vision cleared
he saw the child clearly saw the careening car
the car was less than twenty feet from the running child when he leaped with a cry from the pavement he leaped toward the child and gave her a violent push sending her sprawling across the street to safety
the car was traveling at thirty miles when it struck him
it smashed into him and hurled him thirty feet through the air
with a grinding scream it jolted to a halt turning completely about on the steep gradient
eliot thudded to the pavement and lay still blood trickling from his face
sobbing with terror the child picked herself up and stared at the little form that was running from sprawling body across the pavement
three feet from the curb the fleeing baroque staggered swayed
its tiny hands went to his throat
it screamed in shrill agony
it whirled about like a top
then it tottered sideways and collapsed in a heap in the dust of the gutter who had nearly run down the child emerged whitelipped and trembling from the car the little shape was as unmoving as big bulk spread out on the pavement
eliot awoke in a world of whiteness
he was lying on a soft mattress between white sheets and the walls of the room were white and so was the ceiling above him
when he moved whitehot shafts of searing pain shot through him
the girl who was bending above him and smiling down at him was dressed entirely in white
she laid a soft white hand on his forehead
you must rest now she said
you must get some sleep been unconscious for hours
who who are you gasped eliot
and where where you are in the salem general hospital said the girl am your night nurse
but what happened
you were struck by an automobile this morning
you saved the life of a little girl
eliot remembered then
he started so violently that the nurse was compelled to admonish him
you must try not to think about that
later if you wish but not now
you must get some sleep
eliot groaned
sleep sleep
how can i rest when that little monster the girl said you mean your good luck piece all been admiring it
you havenot lost it
it is quite safe
they found it in the dust of the roadway a few feet from vhere you were lying
eliot stared at her whitelipped
what do you mean
what did you find
the girl smiled and left him she returned she was holding a small flat object that glittered in the palm of her hand
here it is she said
would you like it near you
tremulously eliot took the little baroque
it was cold and metallic and very flat now a tiny rigid figurine of bronze
the nurse said what an ugly little horror
wherever did you get it
i have seen some unusual good luck charms my uncle collects them but this little bronze is unique never seen a duplicate
she smiled
it is a little too large to wear on a watch chain
you just carry it loose in your pocket i suppose
it certainly brought you luck this morning
eliot remembered then
remembered a passage from an old book which he had read somewhere in the course of his antiquarian browsings and witchcraft studies
even warlocks may be saved
even witches and black sorcerers
by heroism and sacrifice and repentance may warlocks be saved
and each demon that cannot abide goodness will shrivel and become as bronze forsaking its warlock when its warlock forsakes the evil one dying in agony shriveling and dying eyes were shining strangely when he took the nurses hand and deposited the little metallic figure on her palm
you say your uncle collects charms
the girl nodded
then give this to him with my blessings
the nurse gasped
you you donot want it
eliot smiled wanly never want to see it again he said have lived too long among antiques
i shall live henceforth among people talk with them laugh with them work with them yes people are better than antiques people are best
photography and sound recording are bound by a limit and beyond that lies madness
dimensions by author oi tryst in time greater than cods etc got it abe as near in under the doorway that made i to life itself as the movies sharp division between the glare of will ever come done it
california sunlight outside and the blair haunted black eyes lofty shadows of long dim were bright with triumph studio
abe silvers gaunt and dark and hope youre right he said wearyeyed shifted the cigar to the around the cigar waited a long other side of his mouth and stepped time for it
and god knows youve spent more years than you ought and more money than even you could afford
why have you done it blair
a man with your money your background shutting yourself up here in the dark sweating over shadows havenot been shut up away from life been shut in with it smile spread across the pallor of his delicate face life itself been groping after all these years and found it abe got it
got the illusion of it maybe
a little better than metrocosmic has been filming for the last few years
and if its as good as you say well buy it and so what
obyrne turned to him fiercely his dreamhaunted eyes suddenly blazing tell you this is life as near as shadows can come too near perhaps
moving pictures have to find a new name for what got
it isnot pictures its breathing living reality worked over it until nothing else seemed to matter nothing else seemed real got it abe life shifted the cigar back across his mouth and if his eyes were understanding his voice was only patient
he had heard such words before from many fiercely sincere inventors
that he had known obyrne for many years did not alter his accustomed attitude toward such things
all right he murmured
show me the projection room blair
here
obyrne waved a thin unsteady hand toward the center of the big studio where under a battery of highhung lights a bar of dull silver rose from a low platform to the height of a mans waist
beyond it against the wall bulked a big rectangular arrangement of chromium and glass behind whose face bulbs were dimly visible
silvers snorted
there
that thing looks like a radio that doubledover pipe
but the screen man the seats the telling you this is utterly new abe have to clear your mind of all your preconceived ideas of what a moving picture should be
all that is obsolete from this minute on
the moving picture is as dead as the magic lantern
this is the new thing
these batteries of lights that radio as you call it the platform and bar one for each individual spectator but what is it
what happens canot explain it to you now said obyrne impatiently
for one thing you wouldnot believe me until after youve seen it
and it would take weeks to give you enough groundwork to understand the principles
the things too complex for anyone to explain in words
i canot even explain the appearance except in metaphors theres never been anything like it before
roughly though its the projection of the illusion of life on a threedimensional screen composed of fogged light
other men are just beginning to fumble around with the principles of threedimensional movies projected on a flat screen giving the appearance of a stage with depth going at it clumsily approached the problem from a much newer angle
my screen itself is threedimensional the light that bathes you when the batteries of arcs are on in the midst of it the action is projected on the light all around you from double films taken from slightly different angles on the stereoscopic principle show you later
and there is in that bar youre to hold on to sufficient current to stimulate very selectively the nerves which carry tactile impression to the brain feel as well as hear and see even smell
on occasion you may actually taste its close enough to the sensations of smelling to work out
only that doesnot figure so much in this case for you as a spectator will not enter into the action simply witness it from closer quarters than any audience has ever dreamed of doing before
here step up on the platform and take hold of the rod there at the curve it
now hold tight and donot be surprised
remember nothing like this has ever been done before
ready
abruptly the great banks of lights blazed into radiance that closed the dazzled silvers about in soft pouring brightness
there was a quality of mistiness about it that made even his own hands invisible before him on the bar
it was as if the light poured upon innumerable motes in the air so refracting from their infinitesimal surfaces that nothing was visible but that shimmer of bright blindness
silvers gripped the bar and waited
through the bright fog a voice as smooth as cream spoke in vast clear echoes rolling in from all around him at once filling the little artificial world of mist wherein he stood lost
mellowly the deep tones said you are about to enter an enchanted wood outside athens on a midsummer night to share in a dream that shakespeare dreamed over three hundred years ago titania queen of faeryland will be played by anne acton
oberon the king is philip graves abe silvers clutched the bar in amazement as that unctuous voice rolled on
anne acton and philip graves were under contract to his own metrocosmic and every one of the other names were stars of the first magnitude
the greatest actors of the day were playing in this incredible fragment of a midsummer dream
what it had cost obyrne he shuddered to think
the creamy voice died away
the mist began to clear
silvers hands closed hard on the bar and he stared in blankest incredulity about the dim blue glades of forest stretching around him silvery in the light of a highriding moon
a breeze whispered through the leaves blowing cool on his face
save that it did not stir a hair of his head he could have believed it an actual breeze sighing through the moonlit dark
he looked down
he was himself invisible disembodied no longer standing on a bare floor but in the midst of a flowering meadow whose grasses were faintly fragrant at his feet
there was no flicker no visible composition of the projection upon this incredible threedimensional screen that surrounded him
the glade stretched away into actual distances much deeper than the studios walls could possibly contain the illusion of deep starry sky overhead was perfect the flowers in the grass were so real he thought he could have knelt and gathered them in his hands
then under the trees the mists parted like a curtain and the queen of faeryland came splendidly into the moonlit glade
anne acton had never looked so lovely
the long veil of her silverpale hair streamed like gossamer behind her and every curve and shadowy roundness was as real as life itself
yet there hovered about her a hint of unreality so that she blended perfectly the illusion of fantasy and reality as she moved over the unbending grass the bright wings streaming from her shoulders was a blast of silvery challenge from elfin horns and into the moonlight strode oberon his lean features wrathful
the famous deep tones of philip graves resounded angrily through the moonlight
titania answered in silvery defiance
then came full rich human voices ringing through the wood
phoebe templeton in rustling satin came radiantly into the glade brushing so close by the watching silvers that he caught a whiff of her perfume felt the touch of her satin skirts
and he knew almost he knew that he could put out a hand and stop her so warmly real was she at that close range
her lovely throaty voice called to lysander behind her
and then somehow the forest was slipping away past abe silvers face somehow he had the illusion of walking as if in a dream down an enchanted forest aisle the dim air quivering with starlight and helena came running and weeping through the trees stumbling sobbing the name of demetrius
she passed
silvers started involuntarily as from a swaying branch above him pealed the wild halfhuman laughter of puck delicate as the chatter of a squirrel and down through the air over his very shoulder the breeze of his passing fanning silvers face the lithe little goblin sprang
the scene clouded over as if a mist had been drawn across the moon
silvers blinked involuntarily and when he looked again titania lay exquisitely asleep on the dewspangled bank where the wild thyme grew
then through the magichaunted wood suddenly shrilled a bell
insistently metallically it rang
silvers glanced about the glades of the forest trying to locate among the dewshimmering leaves the source of that irritating noise
and suddenly the athenian woods melted like smoke about him
incredulously he stared around a big bare studio
it was like waking in bewilderment from a dream so vivid that reality itself paled beside its memory
the studio wants you on the telephone abe said voice
here wake up you hear the bell shook himself laughed sheepishly still in athens he admitted blinking the damnedest thing i ever studio did you say the phone
thinly over the wire came a worried voice
hate to bother you chief but i think you ought to know
anne been mumbling around in a sort of daze for half an hour
the doctor canot do a thing with her
and philip graves passed out on set and is just kind of whispering to himself poetry it sounds like
silvers blinked let the papers get it be right over
he slammed the telephone back on its cradle and turned blankly to obyrne gone wrong with a couple of our actors you stole he said got to get back right away
but listen blair youve got something how long will it take you to have some more of these bar and platform arrangements rigged up
say a dozen for a starter like to have our board see it as soon as possible
this is going to be the most tremendous thing that ever happened in motion pictures
when can you have things ready to show the board
i donot know abe
somehow a little afraid of it
afraid
good god man what do you mean donot know exactly but did you have a feeling as you watched the action that somehow it came too near to life
blair afraid youve been working too hard on this
let me handle it from now on will you
and stop thinking about it got to get back to the studio now and see whats happened to my actors attack of temperament probably but see you tonight about quantity production
until then you wonot let anyone else in on this will you
you know i wonot abe yours if you want it
all the way back to the studio silvers mind was spinning with the magnitude of what lay before him
he had dared to let the inventor know how enormously impressed he was how anxious to have the new process because he knew obyrne so well
the man was wealthy in his own right indifferent to fame to everything but the deep need to create which had driven him so hard for so many years toward the completion of his miracle
miracle in three dimension
it seemed like a dream what he had just seen but behind it lay the prospect for a fortune vaster than any movie magnate had ever dared to hope for
to control this was to control the whole world
silvers clenched his cigar tighter and dreamed magnificent dreams
anne acton lay on a low couch in her lavish little dressing bungalow staring up with conscious pathos into the doctors face as silvers came into the room
somehow illogically it was a shock to him to see her here when he had so short a time before left that perfect illusion of herself in the enchanted wood outside athens asleep on the bank of wild thyme
how are you anne he demanded anxiously for she represented a fabulous sum to the company and an illness now in the midst of her latest picture would be ruinous
is she all right doc
when did she come out of it
while they were phoning you abe said acton herself in a faint pathetic voice moving her head uneasily so that the great slipping rope of silverpale hair moved across the brocade
it it was all so queer
suddenly i felt too tired to move as if all the strength had drained right out of me
and i must have fainted but i wasnot really out
kept having sort of dreams i donot remember now woods somewhere and music
and suddenly it all ended and i opened my eyes here all right now only i feel as weak as a kitten
look
she held up an exquisite hand to show it quivering
what is it doc demanded silvers anxiously overwork perhaps general exhaustion its impossible to say definitely without further examination
will she be okay now see no reason why with rest and care she shouldnot be send for your car anne said silvers authoritatively going home to bed see you later
philip graves in the braidbedecked finery of a movie caballero was sitting up on his couch and holding a cigarette in unsteady fingers when silvers pushed through the little knot of attendants that surrounded him
feeling better phil he demanded
what was it
nothing nothing said the actor impatiently okay now
just passed out for a few minutes be all right
abe silvers lost no time in calling a meeting of the board
the twelve members of metrocosmic stood about in twos and threes murmuring incredulously in the shadows of the obyrne studio on the night when the first dozen barplatforms were erected
silvers had not dared to describe fully this modern miracle like nothing you ever saw before he warned them as rather sheepishly they allowed themselves to be herded forward to the platforms
when they were all at their stations and silvers signaled obyrne to begin he glanced once around the little company before the lights blazed on doubtfully they returned his stare with a murmur or two of protest rising
feel so damn silly an official said standing here
mean to say there isnot any screen
what are we supposed to look at then like a wall of brilliant blindness the foggy light closed down upon them and every man was cut off from his fellows so that he stood alone and disembodied in the heart of that soft misty blaze
startled exclamations sounded through the mist murmurs that died away as silvers heard for the second time the creamy smoothness of the announcers voice rolling through the dimming brightness
you are now about to enter an enchanted wood outside athens on a midsummer night to share in a dream that shakespeare dreamed somehow as the play went on abe silvers began to wonder a little uneasily at the violence of the quarrel between titania and oberon that flamed almost tangibly through the clear dim air
had they fought before so fiercely
had they a gibber of wild inhuman laughter the long leap of puck over his shoulder broke the queer thought halfformed just as a bell began to shrill through the forest
he knew a moment of unreality
he remembered that in the previous performance the bell had not rung until titania lay down to sleep on the bank where the wild thyme grew
but with shocking completeness the forest vanished
silvers stared blankly around the studios reaches that had so suddenly replaced the glades of faeryland blinking at the circle of dazed men in amazement
telephone for you abe voice called through the fading mists of the dream that had so strongly gripped him
he grinned sheepishly and stepped down from the platform
listen chief babbled a distressed voice over the wire shrill above the rising babble of delight behind silvers out like a light at the grove is she plastered donot think so but try to tell the papers that
she wait oh shes just coming out of it we do
send her home sighed silvers get onto the papers right away a life turned back to obyrne with a shrug passed out again he murmured unhappily wonder if she well if she folds now in the middle of never tomorrow well lose our shirts on it going to get a doctor to abe said obyrne in a voice so quiet that the other man turned to him in surprise abe do you realize that every time we run this picture anne acton faints
i wonder if the other actors feel the same reaction
why what do you mean
why should they
blair are you going crazy
silvers voice was stoutly confident but despite himself an uneasy little flicker woke in his mind
philip graves who played oberon had been dazed and out of his head too that other time
and yes hadnot he noticed an item in a gossip column saying that phoebe templeton had collapsed at a tea in new york
was it the same day
rather terrifyingly he thought it was
but of course all this was the most flagrant nonsense
his job now was to keep acton out of the papers
she had not endeared herself to reporters and he knew they would make the story sound as bad as possible
they the phone rejig again wire from philip graves man has just come in abe his wifes voice told him worriedly been taken terribly sick on shipboard
his man says it will be in all the papers tomorrow and he wants your advice
silvers ran a hand distractedly through his hair
thanks he said a little blankly take care of it
be home later
he turned to the men still grouped around the barplatforms in their babble of amazed delight
they had not heard his lowvoiced conversations at the desk got this fellow under contract havenot we said someone anxiously at his elbow
ought to get going on production right away
this is the most tremendous thing that ever happened
yes hell let us have it silvers told him abstractedly
blair hows the production on the first hundred barplatforms coming got to give a larger showing right away hundred and fifty will be ready in about a week obyrne admitted reluctantly
but abe abe do you think we ought to do it
silvers pulled him aside
look blair he said gently you mustnot let your imagination run away with you
what possible connection can there be between the showing of this picture and the fact that a few overworked nervous people have fainting spells admit its a coincidence but weve got to be sensible
we canot let the biggest thing that ever happened in pictures slip through our fingers just because some dizzy actress passes out once or twice
obyrne shrugged a little wonder he murmured as if thinking aloud how long people have been trying to create life always prevented it no ones been allowed to succeed
this thing of mine isnot life but its too near it to leave me at peace with myself
i think theres a penalty for usurping the powers of godhead for coming too close to success afraid abe
blair will you do me a favor demanded silvers
will you go to bed and forget all about this until morning see you tomorrow
right now up to my neck in trouble
obyrne smiled ghostily
all right he said
that was the headline the newsboys were yelling when silvers stepped out of his car the next day
he looked twice at the headline to be sure for the romance of phoebe templeton not with bill fredericks but with manfield drake had kept screen magazines in ecstasies for the past six months
the wedding was to have been this week but he bought a paper hastily a wild thought flashing through his mind
templeton and fredericks had played the lovers in photoplay
bill and have known one another for about six months phoebe templeton was quoted as saying but we never realized until last night how much we meant to each other
it happened rather miraculously
i was on my way west and bill was in hollywood
and suddenly in denver it came over me that i simply must talk to him
i phoned long distance and well its all pretty hazy to look back on but i chartered a plane and met him in yuma and we were married this morning
of course i feel badly about manfield but really this was too big to fight against known since ten oclock last night that we were meant for each other
silvers tucked the paper under his arm and bit down hard on his cigar
it was at ten last night that they had watched hermia and lysander in the actual breathing presences of templeton and fredericks murmuring passionate love under a highfloating moon
for a moment a fantastic wonder crossed his mind must be going nuts he murmured to himself
a week later an audience of a hundred and fifty people gathered for the real preview of midsummer dream
the barplatforms had been set up in the big studio that had seen the first running of the miraculous illusion
it was crowded now with murmurous and skeptical people officers and directors of metrocosmic a sprinkling of wives
silvers conquered an inexplicable uneasiness as he sought obyrne in a corner near the controls
blair was sitting on a heavy stool before the machine and the face he turned to his friend was full of a queer strained tension
he said his voice a thread of sound abe had the maddest notion that every time i show this the figures come back realer than before into the scenes they play
maybe they donot always hold to the action we photographed maybe the plot carries them on beyond what shakespeare wrote more violently than fingers gripped the other mans shoulders hard
sharply he shook him an absurd uneasiness darkening his memory of that impression of fiercer violence in the quarrel between oberon and titania the last time he saw the play even as he said firmly snap out of it blair been working too hard
maybe someone else could run the picture tonight you need rest
obyrne looked up at him apathetically his alarm gone suddenly flat
no do it
if youre really determined to run the thing maybe better
maybe i can control them better than an assistant could
after all i created them
silvers looked down at him for a moment in frowning silence
then he shrugged and turned toward the last empty barplatform where the audience waited the beginning of the show
obyrne was dangerously overworked he told himself
after this was over he must go to a sanatorium for a long rest
his mind was cracking
misty radiance closed down about him veiling the hundred and fifty from his vision
there was a moment of murmurous wonder punctuated by small halffrightened screams from a few of the women as each spectator was shut off into a little world of silence and solitude
into the silvery mist that familiar rich voice rolled smoothly
for the third time silvers saw the broad gray glades of faeryland hedged with immemorial forest opening magically up about him
for the third time titania trailed her streaming wings into the moonlight
oberon strode with a jingle of mail from among the trees and they met in fury halfway down the glade their feet pressing the bending grass with elfin lightness
but there was no lightness in their anger
that ancient quarrel flared up in violence between them and the breezes shivered with their wrath
again hermia and lysander came half laughing half fearful into the woods
again helena sobbed demetrius name among the unanswering trees
puck flitted in goblin glee about his business of enchantment and titania lay down to sleep on the spangled grass among the wild thyme time no telephone bell broke into the magic of the dream
and again these were living people who moved so tangibly before the audience the wind of their passing brushing them the sound of their breathing in their ears when they stood near going about their magichaunted ways as obliviously as if the spectators were the phantoms not they
their loves and hates and heartbreak were vividly real under that incredibly real moon
once or twice silvers thought vaguely that here and there in the action things happened not exactly as he remembered them
had titania actually slapped dark angry face before she swept out of the glade
had hermia and lysander kissed quite so lingeringly under that deepshadowed oak
but as the play went on silvers lost all thought of times that had gone before and sank fathoms deep in the reality of the scene before him
puck lured the spellbewildered lovers into the fastnesses of the forest
they went stumbling through the fog quarreling blinded by mist and magic and their own troubled hearts
swords flashed in the moonlight
lysander and demetrius were fighting among the veiled trees
puck laughed shrill and high and inhuman and swept his brown arm down
and from lysander came a choked gasp the clatter of a fallen sword
demetrius bent fiercely above him
silvers watched the bright blood bubbling from his side saw the blade drip darkly smelled the acrid sharpness of that spreading stain
the illusion was marvelous death was a miracle of artistry from the first choked gasp of pain to the last bubbling of blood in his throat the last twist of handsome silksheathed limbs death something troubled silvers memory but before he could capture it a womans voice cried hysterically somewhere in the misty forest dead hes dead and suddenly blankly the forest was gone from about them and he was staring into dazed halfdreaming faces where an instant before faeryland had stretched depth upon depth of moonlit dimness where lysander had lain dying on the moss
somewhere in the crowd a woman was sobbing hysterically dead i tell you dead and he doesnot really die in the play killed him
that was real blood i smelled it
oh get me out of this awful place
silvers brushed the fog of dreamland from his eyes and was halfway across the floor to the projection machine before the scream had ended for he remembered now that tug of memory as lysander fell play was romance not tragedy
lysander should not have died
obyrne clung to his high stool his fingers whiteknuckled as he stared into silvers eyes
you see he said in a strained monotone
you see what mass hypnotism will do
they couldnot help it poor things they must be half alive wandering in the fog
blair
silvers voice rang sharply
blair snap out of it
what are you raving about
are you mad
the staring eyes turned to his almost apathetically was afraid said obyrne in that whispering monotone as if he spoke in a dream was afraid to run it before this many people i should have guessed what would happen when acton and graves and are you still harping on that coincidence demanded silvers in a fierce undertone you see how foolish it is blair what earthly african savages tibetan nomads chinese peasants south american indians
even the ancient egyptians highly civilized as they were deliberately made their drawings angular and unlifelike
all of them declared and believed that too good a likeness would draw the soul out into the picture
well yes everybodys heard of such things but youre not suggesting after the templeton elopement after anne a complete booklength novel of a war between worlds by and many other unusual stories and features oming in the may issue of our companion scientifiction magazine 15c connection can there be between pictures on a screen and living people some of them half the world away admit what happened tonight was did you ever hear broke in blair softly as if he were following some private train of thought and had not heeded a word of silvers harangue of savages covering their faces when explorers bring out their cameras
they think a photograph will steal their souls an idea so widespread that it canot have originated in mere local superstition
tribes all over the world have it and philip graves illness yes after what happened tonight how can you deny it abe
no the egyptians the modern savages were closer to the truth than we
only before now no likeness has been perfect enough to absorb sufficient personality so that people could notice it
but these illusions of mine theyre real living breathing
while you watch you canot believe the actual men and women arenot standing in front of you
it had an effect on acton and graves when only you were watching enough of their personality was drained out of them into the illusion by your own temporary conviction that they were there so that they went into vague dreams of woodland and music
i donot know how the other actors were affected i do know that several of them were sick and dizzy that day
i havenot checked maybe been afraid to
when the twelve boardmembers were watching the drain was stronger so that graves was really ill on shipboard and acton couldnot be roused from her faint until the telephone call to you broke the illusion here
it affected templeton and bill fredericks another way hypnotized them into believing what the audience was believing that they were really in love flooded into silvers mind
he remembered what he had felt when he read the headlines of the elopement
he said it happen that way blair
how greatly could a mass mind affect the reactions of the people it concentrates on
i thought of it before if twelve individuals each convinced for a time that he saw two people desperately in love might really work a sort of persuasion on those two no thats crazy it couldnot happen
you saw it happen murmured blair quietly
you saw what happened when a hundred and fifty people joined in that fierce concentration that utter conviction that they saw a mans sword poised aimed descending mass hypnotism it was
for a majority of them that sword really struck their imagination outran the actual fact and they thought they saw lysander spitted on demetrius blade
they thought they saw him die
well he didnot did he
i mean nothing happened this time or theyd have called me
a thin smile twisted up strained mouth
he reached behind him
silvers heard a click and realised that the telephone had been lying out of its cradle on the desk ever since he reached side wanted you to understand before they broke the news to you obyrne was explaining gently
and i knew the telephone would interrupt ime unless i shrill buzzing whirred from the desk
with a little spurt of terror for what he had yet to learn silvers snatched it up
a voice shouted thinly in his ear silvers
is that you chief
my god been trying to get you all evening been in a coma for over an hour doctor canot rouse her
and a call just came in from london that phil graves is out too canot be waked
and whats that
what
chief just come in that passed out too and bill fredericks has dropped dead the matter with this town like the end of the world abe voice behind him twisted silvers around like a hand on his shoulder
the receiver shrilled unnoticed as their eyes met face was almost serene knowledge of what the telephone was crying showed in his eyes
he said do you believe me now
do you understand
do you realize how much of life itself woven into this damnable thing made
yes its like twodimensional pictures that carry a shadow of the third enough dark to give a feeling of depth
in my threedimensional picture somehow got a shadow of the fourth life maybe or something too near it
maybe thats what the fourth dimension is life itself
but it wonot kill men again not again crash of glass shattered into the hysterical buzz of the crowd
silence like death fell over the confusion of the murmurous throng among the barplatforms as they turned white faces toward the corner frail arms swung his heavy stool with desperate strength crunching and smashing and crashing among the delicate intricacies of his projector
silvers clutched the still shrilling telephone and watched him not moving
a question of identity no pang of hunger nor torment of thirst can stifle the questions of who where and what
by author of the jewel etc were lead
my that moved like sluggish quicksilheart was a great coiled ver back and forth in burning waves clock that throbbed rather than ticked ever so slowly
my lungs were metal sponges my head a bronze bowl filled with molted lava back and forth consciousness and unconsciousness interplaying against a background of slow dark pain
i felt just that nothing more
i was in a in a wooden coffin had a heart lungs body head but i felt nothing external that is my body did not impinge on anything
i was not sitting or standing or walking or lying or doing anything that i could feel
i was just heart lungs body head alone in darkness that was filled with the pulsing of a muted agony
this was myself
but who was the thought came the first real thought for before that had been only an awareness of being
now i wondered as to the nature of my being
who was i was a man
the word man aroused certain associations which struggled through the pain through the thumping heart and gasping lung sensation
if i was a man what was i doing
where was in response to the thought awareness increased
i had a body and therefore i possessed hands ears eyes
i must try to feel hear see
but i could not
my arms were lumps of immovable iron
my ears knew only the sound of silence and the throbbing that came from within my tortured body
my eyes were sealed by the leaden weight of enormous eyelids
this i knew and felt panic
what had happened
what was wrong with me
why couldnot i feel and hear and see
i had been in an accident and i was lying on a hospital bed under ether
that was one explanation
perhaps i had been crippled blinded deafened maimed
only my soul existed faintly like a whispering that rustles through the ruins of an old old house
but what accident
where had i been before this
i must have lived
what was my name i resigned myself to the darkness as i strove to grapple with these problems and the darkness was kind
my body and the darkness seemed to be equally detached so that they mingled
it was peaceful too peaceful for the thoughts that throbbed through my brain
the thoughts fought and clamored and finally screamed until i felt myself awaken
it was the sensation i vaguely recalled of finding ones foot asleep
it spread over my body so that a pleasant tingling made me aware bit by bit of having definite arms and hands definite chest and pelvis definite legs and feet
their outlines emerged and were defined by that tingling
a burring droned in my spine as though a dentists drill had bit into it
simultaneously i became aware that my heart was a congo drum within my chest my lungs great gourds swelling and sinking in frantic rhythm
i exulted in the pain for through it i felt myself
that sensation of detachment faded and i knew that i complete intact lay against softness
but where
that was the next question and sudden energy seemed ready to solve it
my eyes opened
they encountered nothing but a continuation of the blackness which lurks behind the curtains of closed lids
if anything the blackness was deeper richer
i could see nothing of myself and yet my eyes were open
was i blind
my ears still heard no sound other than the mysterious inspiration of my own breath
my hands moved ever so slowly at my sides rustling against cloth which told me that my limbs were clothed and yet unblanketed
they moved upward outward
an inch two inches three and then they encountered hard unyielding surfaces on either side
they rose upward prompted by fear
six inches and another unyielding surface of wood
my feet thrust out as i stretched and through shoeleather the tips of my toes encountered wood
my mouth opened and a sound poured forth
it was only a rattle though i had meant to scream
for my thoughts whirled around one name one name that somehow groped through a haze and loomed as the symbol of my unreasoning fear
i knew a name and i wanted to scream
edgar allan poe
and then my rattling voice of pered unprompted that which i so feared in connection with this name
the premature burial i whispered
poe wrote it
i am living it
i was in a coffin in a wooden coffin with the hot stale air of my own corruption reeking in my nostrils burning in my lungs
i was in a coffin locked in earth and yet i was alive
then i found strength
my hands had been frantically scratching and clawing at the surface above my head
now they gripped the sides of my prison and thrust outward with all strength my legs braced at the foot of the box
my legs then kicked
new vigor the vigor of a madman rushed through my boiling blood
in sheer frenzy in an agony born of the fact that i could not scream and give expression to it i lashed out with both feet at the bottom of the coffin felt it splinter and give way
then the sides cracked my bleeding fingers clutched at the earth beyond and i rolled over burrowing and scrabbling at the moist softpacked earth
i dug upwards wheezing in a sort of mindless desperation as i worked
instinct alone combatted the insane horror which gripped my being and transformed it into the activity which alone could save me
they must have buried me in a hurry
the earth above my grave was shallow
choking and half suffocated i clawed my way to the top after endless eons of utter delirium during which the dust of the grave covered me and i wriggled like a worm through the dark ground
my hands reached up to form a cavity then i lunged upward with full strength and burst through to the surface
i crawled out into silvery moonlight flooding down upon a world of marble toadstools which sprouted richly from the mounds of grass all about me
some of the fantastic stone growths were crossshaped others bore heads or great urnlike mouths
they were the headstones of graves naturally but i saw only toadstools fat bloated toadstools of deadwhite pallor reaching unthinkable roots into the ground below to draw forth nourishment
i lay staring at them staring back at the pit through which i had come up out of death into life once again
i did not could not think
the words edgar allan poe and premature burial had come unbidden to my brain and now for some reason i found myself whispering in a hoarse dreadful voice then crooning more loudly lazarus
lazarus
lazarus my panting subsided and i drew fresh strength from the air that sang through my lungs
i stared at the grave again my grave
it bore no headstone
it was a poor grave in a poor section of the cemetery probably a field
nearly on the outskirts of the necropolis it was and weeds writhed over the poor graves
there was no headstones and it made me remember my question
who was i it was a unique problem
i had been someone before i died but who
surely this was a novel case of amnesia to return to a new life in the actual sense of the phrase
who was funny i could think of words like amnesia and yet could not in the least associate them with anything personal in my past
my mind was utterly blank
did death do this to me
was it permanent or would my mind awaken in a few hours just as my body had
if not i was in sore straits
i didnot know my name or my station what i had been
for that matter on reflection i didnot even know where i was
the names of cities flooded foolishly through my brain
chicago milwaukee los angeles washington bombay shanghai cleveland chichen itza pernambuco angkor wat rome omsk carthage
i could not associate a single one with myself or for that matter explain how i knew those names
i thought of streets of mariposa boulevard and michigan avenue and broadway and center street and park lane and the champs elysees
they meant nothing to me
i thought of proper names
felix kennaston ben blue ralph waldo emerson studs lonigan arthur gordon pym james gordon bennett samuel butler igor stravinsky and they represented no image of myself
i could see all those streets visualize all those people picture all those cities but myself i could not associate with any of them
comedy tragedy drama it was a mad scene to play in a cemetery at nightfall
i had crawled out of a grave without a headstone and all i know was that i was a man
and yet who
my eyes roved over my person lying in the grass
beneath mud and dirt i saw a dark suit torn in places and discolored
it covered the body of a tall man a thin body poorly muscled and flatchested
my hands rustling over my person were long and leanly muscular they were not the hands of a labourer
of my face i knew nothing though i passed my hand over each feature in turn
one thing i felt certain oft whatever the cause of my apparent death i was not physically maimed prompted me to rise
i rose to my feet stumbled over the grass
for a few minutes i had that drunken floating sensation but gradually the ground became solid under my feet i knew awareness of the cool night wind on my forehead heard with indescribable joy the chirping of crickets from a swamp afar
i walked around the tombstones gazed at the clouding sky felt dew and dampness fall
but my brain was aloof detached wrestling with invisible demons of doubt
who was what was i to do
i could not wander strange streets in my disheveled condition
if i presented myself to authorities i would be put away as a madman
besides i did not want to see anyone
this fact i realized quite suddenly
i did not wish to see lights or people
i was different
it was the feeling of death
was i still
unable to bear the thought i frantically groped for clues
i tried every means of awakening dormant memories
walking endlessly the night through combatting chaos and confusion fighting the gray clouds that clung to my brain i wandered up and down the deserted corner of the cemetery
exhausted i stared at a lightened sky
and then my thoughts fled away even the confused ones
i knew only one thing the need for rest and peace and forgetfulness
was it the deathurge
had i risen from the grave only to return
i neither knew nor cared
actuated by a compulsion as inexplicable as it was overpowering i stumbled toward the ruins of my grave and crept inside burrowing like a mole into the grateful darkness whilst the earth tumbled in behind me
there was enough air the thought came to enable me to breathe while i lay back in the shattered coffin
my head fell back and i settled in my coffin to sleep
the muttering and rumbling died away from dreams i could not remember
they died away from dreams and grew in reality until i sat up pushing wet earth so that it fell around me
i was in the grave
again terror
somehow the hope had lurked that this was a dream and awakening might bring me to grateful reality
but i was in the grave and a storm howled above
i crawled upward
it was still night or rather instinct prompted me to believe that it was night again
i must have slept the clock around
this storm had kept people from the graveyard kept them from discovering the torn earth and its inmate
i rose to the surface and the rain lashed me from skies wild with anger
and yet i was happy happy for the life i knew
i drank the rain the thunder enraptured me as though it were a symphony i marvelled at the lightnings emerald beauty
i was alive all about me corpses rotted and a sloughed nor could all the fury of the unleashed elements imbue them with one spark of existence or of memory
my own poor thoughts my own poor life were infinitely precious in comparison to the lot of those below
i had cheated worm and maggot let the storm howl
i would howl with it share in the cosmic jest
vitalized in the truest sense of the word i began to walk
the rain washed the earthstains from my garments and body
singularly i felt no cold no especial dampness
i was aware of these things but they did not seem to penetrate
for the first time i realized another odd thing i was not hungry or thirsty
at least i did not seem to be
had appetite died with memory
i wondered
memory the problem of identity still pressed
i walked along impelled by the storm
still pondering my feet carried me past the confines of the cemetery
the gale leading me seemed to guide my footsteps out onto the stone sidewalk of a deserted street
i walked almost without heeding
who was how had i died
how revived i walked through the rain down the dark street alone in the wet velvet of the night
who was how had i died
how revived i crossed a block entered a narrower street still stumbling alone with the wind and the laugh of thunder from clouds mocking my bewilderment
who was i knew
my name the street told me
summit street
who lived on summit street
arthur derwin myself
i was arthur derwin of summit street
i used to be something i couldnot remember
i had lived lived for years and yet all i could recall was my name
how had i died
i had been to the seance and the lights were out and mrs price was calling to someone
she had screamed something about evil influences and then the lights had gone on
they hadnot gone on
but they must have
they had but i wasnot there
i had died
died in the darkness at the seance
what killed me
shock perhaps
and then what happened
mrs price had hushed it up
i was alone in the city i had been buried hurriedly in a paupers grave
heart failure the coroner had probably called it
i was laid away
that was it
and yet i was arthur derwin and surely somebody had cared
bramin street said the sign in the lightning
bramin street someone had cared viola
viola had been my fiancee
she had loved arthur derwin
what was her last name
where had i met her
what did she look like
bramin street
again the sign
unconsciously my feet seemed to have led me down this way
i was walking down bramin street without thinking in the storm
very well
i would let my feet lead the way
i wouldnot think
my feet would take me to home through habit
there i would learn
no thinking now
just walk through the storm my eyes closed to the blackness through which thunder beat
i walked out of death and i was hungry now
i was hungry and thirsty here in the night and i was hungry to see viola and thirsty for her lips
i had come back from death for her or was that too poetic
i came from the grave and went back to sleep in it and rose again and sought the world without memory
it was gruesome and grim and macabre
i died at a seance
my feet plodded slopping through rain
i felt no cold no wet
i was warm inside warm with the memory of viola her lips her hair
she was a blonde i remembered
her hair was coiled sunlight her eyes blue and deep as the sea her skin the milky whiteness of a unicorns flanks
i had told her so i recalled when i had held her in my arms
i knew her mouth as a scarlet gate to ecstasy
she was the hunger within me she the burning beacon of desire that led me back through mists of memory to her door
i was panting and did not know it
within me revolved a wheel that had once been my brain and was now just a grinding round screen flashing kaleidoscopic images of viola of the grave of a seance and evil presences and inexplicable death
viola had been interested in mysticism i had been interested in the occult we went to the seance
mrs price was a famous medium
i died at the seance and woke up in a grave
i came back to see viola
i came back to find out about myself
i knew now what i was how i had died
but how revived
but bow revived
bramin street
feet plodding
and then instinct turned my feet up the pathway to the porch
it was instinct which caused my hand to fumble for the familiar doorknob without knocking instinct which led me across the threshold
i in a hallway a deserted hallway
there was a mirror there and for the first time i could see myself
perhaps that would shock me into complete remembrance and recognition
i looked but the mirror faded before my gaze into a blur
i felt weak dazed
but it was due to the hunger within me the hunger which burned
it was late
viola wouldnot be downstairs
she would be in her bedroom at this hour
i went up the stairs dripping water at every step walking quite silently aside from the little dripping patter of rills running down to the stair below
all at once giddiness left me again and i felt strong
i had the feeling that i was ascending the stairs to destiny as though once i reached the top i would know the truth of my fate
something had brought me from the grave here
something lay behind this mysterious resurrection
the answer lay above
i reached the top turned down the dark familiar hall
the bedroom door opened beneath my hand
a candle burned at the bedside nothing more
and i saw viola lying there
she slept incarnate beauty slept
she was very young and lovely at that moment and i felt pity for her at what she must know upon awakening
i called softly
viola
i called softly and while i did so my brain said the last of the three questions over and over
and how revived said my brain
viola called my voice
she opened her eyes allowed life to flood them
she saw me
arthur she gasped dead it was a scream that last yes i said softly
why did i say yes
i wondered
and my brain whispered and how revived she rose up shuddering dead a ghost
we buried you
mrs price was afraid
you died at the seance
go away arthur youre dead she moaned it over and over
i looked at her beauty and knew hunger
a thousand memories of that last evening came to me
the seance and mrs price warning of evil spirits the coldness which had gripped me in the darkness and my sudden sinking into oblivion
then this wakening and my search for viola to appease my hunger
not for food
not for drink
not for love
a new hunger
a new hunger known only at night a new hunger that made me shun men and forget my former self
a new hunger that hated mirrors
a hunger for viola
i moved toward her very slowly and my wet graveclothes rustled as i reached out my hands reassuringly and took her in my arms
i was sorry for her just for an instant then the hunger came stronger and i bent my head
the last question rang in my brain once again
and how revived
the seance the threat of evil spirits answered that question
i answered it myself
i knew why i had risen from the grave and who and what i was as i took viola in my arms
i took viola in my arms and my teeth met in her throat
that answered the question
i was a vampire
bottom pool what the fisher what the bait
martin aylethorp plumbs the depths
author of liquid life major vision etc be stupid of me to write this with the intention of saving my life
of course i shall be threatened with a murder charge but they shall never be able to produce the body
consequently they must eventually set me free
but there is a possibility that i may be held for a sanity hearing
for that reason i must pen this account and attach it to the other papers
it may serve to convince the officials at the investigation
and those officials must be convinced
they must be convinced because there is a deed which they must do
it is imperative that they heed my plea and board up the bottomless pool in the swamp beyond woods
they must board up the pool and drain the bogland fence it off if they cannot destroy it
otherwise there will be further tragedies this i swear is true
and until that black pool is boarded over i shall never find the solace of sound sleep but will i slid feet foremost into the stygian waters tinue to dream of that thing in the swamp the dark thing that took the life of my friend martin aylethorp
there was a time when i knew peace the mockery
my friend martin had been in a slump period he wrote for a living and i invited him east for the sole reason that i thought wed find a soothing tranquillity at my home
my cottage is near mill brook just outside of concord
martin i reasoned would enjoy tramping in woods and in the fall the new england countryside takes on a mellow beauty most conducive to easing shattered nerves
i recall my preparation for his coming it seems like a grim joke
i was so careful in rigging up his room to insure its quiet i even sent into town for a noiseless portable to replace my regular typewriter
for when martin arrived in late august he was a sick man
his tall normally lean figure was now emaciated his eyes were sunken behind his spectacles and the smile i had remembered as habitual upon his countenance seemed drowned by inward melancholy
he smoked too much and when he held a cigarette the gray spirals rose from the tip unevenly because of the trembling of his hand
i did my best to conceal my concern over his changed appearance
he had been working on a novel and trying to hold down a librarians job during the day
i gathered that he was completely done in and had lately found is impossible to continue with his short story work
it is amazing what creative effort can do to a man of peculiar temperament he was drained dry sucked of all vitality as though his nights had been given over to visits from a vampire or succubus rather than writing
it isnot a bad comparison for martin aylethorp wrote weird fiction
he wrote it intensely and it was his theory not mine that writing fantasy took more out of an author than work in any other field
his own person certainly seemed to be good proof of this contention
i did my best for him
i carefully avoided all topics of conversation which might relate to his work
i did not show him any of my recent stuff
i locked away all my reference books and magazines
and i did not allow him to speak of his book
i coaxed him into resting argued and bullied him with the notion of getting outdoor exercise interspersed with plenty of sleep
after a week or so i gradually augented the menu at meal time and encouraged him to eat
it worked
by the time september had passed he had regained his normal attitude and his health was once more back to par
incidentally i myself had gained six pounds
soon i proposed a series of daily hikes in and about the local woods
martin took to the idea and for the fir6t time i learned that as a boy he had often spent the summer with relatives in concord
he seemed eager as his health improved to revisit familiar landmarks
although i had been at my cottage for over a year i was amazed at the unsuspected secrets of the countryside he uncovered
soon he was acting as my guide and i played the meekly following visitor to local shrines
as his physical wellbeing increased his normal interests were correspondingly rearoused
within several weeks he was talking stories and plots to me again and by the end of the month he was literally champing at the bit eager to get back into harness and do a few tales
although i held out as long as i could he insisted that he be allowed the use of my typewriter and our daily jaunts were now filled with his talk of proposed work and plans for stories
and then our hikes and his interest converged disastrously
one morning after breakfast he came into my room and yanked me out of my chair
come on he urged
the suns high and were going for a little exploring jaunt
where to
i asked we covered all the local showplaces yet
this is no showplace he replied smiling a secret wager theres a spot youve never seen and only a mile away from here too doubt that i said
what kind of place is it
martin assumed a look of melodramatic grimness called the bottomless pool he whispered the gag serious in the swamp south of woods
i remember my gang explored it during one of the summers i stayed here as a kid a strange place george graves warned us to stay away from it when we told him wed been there
he was the only grownup we ever spoke to about it and it was he who called the place the bottomless pool
he mentioned walden pond in concord the place where thoreau wrote his nature studies you know and said that it was bottomless too
it lies in a hollow in the hills has neither inlet nor outlet yet the water is always fresh
springs and a subterranean river cause that no doubt the glacier created some queer freaks hereabouts
but he said that government engineers once came to walden to take soundings and there were spots in that pond that were deeper than their longest soundingwires what he meant by a bottomless pool and he said that the one in woods was similar
well his warning just whetted our interest in the spot you see
kids are like that i guess
we got together all the fishline the gang could lay their hands on and tied it all together with a lead weight on one end
then we lowered it down into that sluggish black pool in the swamp
we never struck bottom
well that sort of scared us its a creepy place and we took the warning more seriously never have gone back
that was my last summer at concord and i gradually lost track of the boys
but i did hear something in a letter once about sam dewey disappearing in the swamp the following year
sam was the lad who suggested we take soundings
of course i donot think his disappearance had anything to do with his interest in the bottomless pool although it might have at that
he was foolhardy and george graves when warning us hinted something about people who had fallen in i listened to all this with a sort of tepid interest
but martin seemed genuinely enthusiastic go take a look at the place he urged really a weird spot and got a hunch theres a story there somewhere
i rose and obediently put on my boots
in my own solitary wanderings i had avoided the mucky wooded depths of the old swamp and it was only to humor my guest that i acceded to his request we struck out to the south and soon reached the swamp edge swamp was awful
the limbs of dead trees interred the sunlight and only the wan ghosts of its beams haunted the murky avenues of the morass
rotten logs and slimy creepers covered a slough of quicksand and bog through which i floundered at heels
the instincts of boyhood guided him aright so that he avoided the gray bubbling patches of deeper ooze
he remarked over this voicing his amazement that after all these years the place seemed to be unchanged
at first it was the physical difficulties we encountered which impressed me
gradually however as we waded deeper into the dark swamp i became more aware of other less tangible things
the place looked like death and smelled of deaths rottenness and decay
moss and fungoid growths clung to the gray treetrunks bloated toadstools reared pulpy deaths heads on fat stemmed necks rising from the ooze
the bubbling of the swampjuices beneath our boots was a silent kind of sound or rather a noise that seemed to intensify the silence and at the same time to be a part of it
there was no wind in the hanging branches and we saw neither bird nor animal in these depths
still there had been life here once for we soon struck a rickety old fence which wound in a seemingly haphazard manner through the lower swamp
martin beckoning to me turned and followed the meandering wooden outlines until he came to the willow tree that bent over the ground before it
and there in the deep dark shade of the ancient boughs lay the bottomless pool
it was small barely six feet across and black
jet black water motionless
the pool was like a large unblinking eye with an odious green scum filming its pupil a highly fantastic comparison but something about the pools appearance inspired such thoughts in me
it was strange and somehow unnatural
it wasnot right for this small pool to be here in the swamp and certainly the thing looked as evil as any natural formation ever seen stood looking into the depths for a few moments
the waters black too he murmured strange how in the presence of silence the human voice is always hushed
the waters black as ink he said
and he dipped one hand into the pool brushing off the scummy froth and cupping ebon drops for me to see
the water was black and the decayed matter in it gave it a veined appearance it was striated with dark green rills
place eery enough for you asked martin
i nodded
scared us when we were kids he observed
and i wouldnot be too sure of my reactions now
but what a setting for a story
perhaps
i had been staring into the silent water and now i wondered what was generating the impulse in me to turn and run away
were my own nerves bad
i hastily averted my gaze
look
martin shouted
he really spoke in a normal tone of voice but in contrast to our previous hushed murmurs it was a shout
look at the lizard he exclaimed
sure enough the surface of the black water had parted with a widening ripple and a small dark lizard of some sort appeared
it floated on its back as though dead
i reached down and grabbed it yanked it out
why theres a wire attached to it
i gasped
the wire led down into the water
just then there came a pull on the line from within the pool
it yanked the little dead reptile right out of my hands but something attached to it caught in my coat cut right through it and dug painfully into my side
a hook caught
i cried as i stepped toward the to ease the pain of the barb in my side
but now the wire line had tightened was drawing me in short jerks toward the brink of the black pool
i grabbed the line with both hands braced my feet at the very edge and leaned backward
but the sod on which i was standing crumbled and i slid feet foremost into the stygian water
help
i cried
martin leaped forward and grabbed me
with a tremendous tug he hurled me back on the bank
water coursed down my body and warm blood scalded the deep wound in my side
i felt faint
martin swore softly as he daubed iodine on the cut beneath my shirt and i swore loudly at the pain
neither of us were ready to comment but suddenly martin turned his head and darted again to the edge of the pool
he pointed speechless
another lizard larger than the first now rose to the surface of the pool
it bobbed and seemed to beckon
martin scowled deeply pointed to my hookgashed side and growled out a single word bait
bait
what bait
the lizard
i snorted disgustedly
but ah the way home we marveled at the incident
we argued as i changed into dry garments debated as i bandaged my side mused during luncheon and speculated wildly all the long afternoon
martin ever the imaginative had a dozen fantastic theories
who fished at the depths of the bottomless pool
and with hooks
something lived in the pool
maybe somethings
the somethings fished for men
as a boy hadnot george graves hinted about disappearances
and hadnot sam dewey vanished near the swamp in the pool set traps for men putting lizards on hooks and using a wire line
the bottomless pool led to inner earth and there was life below
thus martin expressed himself halfseriously
to which i offered the obvious replies
the hook and line had been used by some fisherman
it had fallen into the water
perhaps the lizard had been accidentally impaled upon the hook risen to the surface as it died and brought the line up
i grabbed it got hooked and a snag entangling the lines end under water had pulled me into the pool
but what about the second lizard we saw
martin insinuated gently
i was silent
martin was grave for a moment before continuing remember as a boy fishing for pickerel up assabet
the boat rocked
i was only about nine at the time but i was a smart fisherman
i hooked a big pickerel that day and the pickerel hooked me
i gave him an uncomprehending glance
how
i asked
line got wrapped around my foot and the fish pulled me out of the boat he laughed
then in graver tones he went on if i were a fish and i wanted to catch a fisherman tangle him up in a line
take the bottomless pool for example
if i meant to capture whoever or whatever is fishing for me from below grab that lizard bait and allow it to drag me in toward the pool
then pull up more line and attach the wire to a windlass rope
and then let go of the hook
the sudden release might precipitate the fisherman below overboard into the water and tangle him up
then by quickly winding in the windlass haul the fellow up to the surface
but thats absurd i began no fisherman in the bottomless pool there canot be and besides how does your hooked side feel this evening interjected martin sarcastically
oh lets forget it i grumbled
but i didnot forget
i dreamed that night
and martin did not forget either
he spent the midnight hours at the typewriter taking notes for a story
neither of us however spoke again of the bottomless pool
the next day i awoke with a slight fever
the wound in my side was a little inflamed and i lay abed bathing it with hot cloths to reduce the swelling
martin after assuring himself that i was not utterly helpless announced that he was going for a walk like to interview a few oldtimers around here about that place he told me
there should be myths
i forget what remark i made but i know that i tried to laugh him out of his interest
secretly i was very much disturbed
my dreams had not been pleasant and the bottomless pool had figured rather too prominently in them
for a moment i had the wild notion that martin was going off to try out his fishing theory
he seemed almost unnaturally interested a person of his temperament can be greatly influenced by imaginative concepts
he left on his purported mission of investigation and i spent a long day in dozing and dreaming
it was late afternoon when he returned greeted me brusquely and went in to the other room
in a few moments i heard the vibration of the noiseless typewriter
rising i got supper together
we ate but little fever had banished my own appetite and excitement seemed to grip martin so that food could not interest him
almost as soon as he sat down he launched into a long babble of gossip he had picked up during the day
old bert pickens down near the causeway had known parents he had filled my friend up with old colonial tales and even some indian lore hed heard as a boy back in the seventies
there were stories about the swamp south of the woods specific cases of disappearances dating way back as far as community memory went
visiting granny cottage later in the day martin had persuaded the always garrulous old woman to re106 count her own family history
it was a point of pride with the crone that her pure blood had at one time produced a martyr during the salem witchcraft hysteria and she warned martin most gravely about the old pool
it was from her that he picked up his tale of the indian rites in the swamp where the braves sometimes offered up sacrifices to the pitgod they believed dwelt in the pool casting bodies into the orifice
i could see that martin was more impressed with this lore than even he admitted he was very glib in patching together his yarn so that it formed an almost recognizable story sequence
he quoted from memory the words of cotton mather concerning gateways to hell and openings in earth which lead to the regions of the damned indeed he weaved a fine romance about the pool and did it so deftly that i was forced to the conclusion that he halfbelieved some of it write it all up tonight he told me
then i must have another look at the place
you know theres something fascinating about all this its a real mystery it be remarkable if there is some truth about my theories concerning the fishing
after all those lizards donot manufacture hook and wire
and some of these old wives tales are very definite
i made no comment
i went to bed early leaving martin to type away in the next room as he had planned
my sleep was troubled and it must have been about midnight when i woke in a cold sweat and stumbled into the kitchen for water
the house was dark and still
i passed through room and noticed with a start that his bed was empty
fever left me
i knew with an inexplicable dread that martin had gone
and i knew too where he had gone
my first thought was that i had overestimated his recovery
he might still be mentally ill the pool in the swamp had exercised a morbid fascination on his mind
poor judgment might have led him to see the thing by moonlight for the sake of capturing story atmosphere
i went back to bed but i did not sleep
i kept waiting for him to return
the night was long
i trembled with fever and with secret fear
it was not a good thing to wander alone in the swamp by night
quicksand and fog to say nothing of the possibilities of running into some prowler made the stunt dangerous
but after an hour had passed i found that it was not this spectacle of actual apparent dangers which disturbed me
i began to think only of the pool itself and of the bait upon its black surface
then it was that unreasoning panic gripped me
i rose and bundled up tugged on my boots
i snatched up my belt flashlight and ran out
i i had no sense of time passing on my nocturnal trek in the woods
it seemed only a feverfilled instant before i was already wading into that black jungle fringing the swamp only a mistwrapped moment before i darted from hummock to hummock in the rising fog calling name
only the frogs croaked an answer
then i was following the fencerail and finally grasped the willow trunk as i stared down at the bank of the pool the bank of wet mud in which were implanted the fresh bootprints of human feet
they faced one way only toward the pool
and as they neared the edge they slurred into a sort of sliding scoopedout impression as though the wearer had been dragged
dragged into the black silent water from which the tiny bubbles now arose slowly slowly
i screamed and ran back into the night
fever held me the next day
but i was glad for it kept me from thinking too much thinking about what had happened and also about what i planned to do
i didnot consider the possibility of suicide not when i read the typed notes martin had written the night before
the whole story of his belief lay there and there were incredible hints of what he expected to bring forth from the pool depths
at the last he spoke of the urge to revisit the scene and capture a lizard for examination to see if it were of a recognizable species and also to determine just how it had been killed
he wanted some wire also and one of the hooks
then he would go ahead and try his plan
for he quite definitely had intended to use the windlass trick
i learned that before the morning was over the delivery truck brought the order from the city
i went sick as i signed name for the shipment
i had a sudden vision of him on the night before standing by the pool as he waited for the appearance of the bait then stooping to remove the reptile and being caught dragged
no it was not suicide
it was murder
but by what means
through burning delirium came the answer pictures conjured up from indian legends and witchcraft whisperings
a dweller beneath the waters fishing for humankind and snaring the curious
a fissure in the earths crust leading to some hellish subterranean cavern
and martin going down down into the inky waters on the end of a hook to be seized by what i would find out
the windlass and scheme he would be avenged with his own plan his own instrument
i must have been a little mad
i talked and laughed to myself a great deal as the day sped
i gathered the equipment together at dusk and started for the swamp
an unhealthy nightfog was already rising when i left woods but though fever coursed through my veins i plodded on
i walked through nightmare
the unseen frogs croaked a dismal litany as i stumbled through the bog
tapers of fog rose dimly on all sides and smoky mist hung about my head
i floundered through the gray darkness lugging the windlass
often i sank ankledeep into puddles of bubbling slime
v all about me in the night was rottenness and decay and death and i recall thinking that this putrescent swamp was but a frame a background a setting for the black jewel of the bottomless pit
but the fog and the fever in my temples accounted for such wild fancies
fog and fever conspired toward my feeling of unutterable loathing when first i caught sight of the ebon waters upon the inky chasm in the center of the swamp
fog and fever addled me so that i monotonously cursed as i anchored the windlass to a big log set upon the firm higher ground of the bank
a short rope from the drum of the windlass ran to the edge of the pool and ended in a quicksettling clamp
there was a detached part of me that carried out these operations with methodical precision and yet another part that inspired my cursings as i crouched there in the forest darkness of the heaving breathing swamp my feet the quicksand thrummed and groaned and i recall that a wild picture rose in my mind
i had a fantastic image of myself crouching upon the epidermis of some gigantic monster as though the swamp itself were just the skin of a vast beast and the bottomless black pit a tiny pinprick in the flesh
but that too was fog and fever
the preparations were made
i had not even glanced at the scummy surface of the pool so sure was i of what my eyes must encounter
now with the drum ready for use and the windlass securely placed i gazed into the dark depths and jerked on the flashlight i wore at my belt
its rays disclosed the floating blue body of a tiny lizard bobbing monotonously upon the surface of the cryptic waters
there it lay in death rising and sinking upon water that did not move
and that fact inspired me with the terrible fear of a corroboration for poor story
i stared at the creature fighting the fog and fever that created gray mist upon my brain until the only thought distinguishable was a panic impulse to flee the spot
i rocked on my heels when i wished to run screaming back across the bog to a spot where nature is sane and friendly
and then i felt in my pocket for the wireclipper i had found on desk
for some absurd reason the cold feel of the prosaic factorycut metal reassured me
and with my free hand i reached out and snatched at the blue lizard
i tugged the body from the water in the beam of the flashlight on the bank and the clear yellow beam was cut by a black line
the lizard was wired seizing the clamp next to me i quickly clipped the wire to the windlass rope
then i yanked on the wire with both hands
i tugged
a shudder ran through me for i felt a dreadful unmistakable response from the other end of the line
through the water it tightened jerked below was pulling on the rope
someone was fishing
but who
and from how far below
the tugger was strong
in sudden desperation i felt my heels slide along the bank
powerful jerks were drawing me close to the black brink of that dark still pool
with a gasp i let go
the line whipped back into the water
in my minds eye i formed a silly senseless picture of a fisherman standing on his wharf then falling over backwards as the catch released his line
an idiotic picture it was for there could be no fisherman at the bottom of a bottomless pool
or could there be
i would soon know
the line fell back then reached the spot where i had clamped it to the windlass rope
there it snapped taut
the fisherman had fallen overboard
he had been hooked
i laughed without mirth at the insane thought
and then i gripped the windlass handle and turned the drum and i felt a terrific threshing tauten the line until it stood straight in the flashlights beam again
the wire began to snap back and forth in the black waters of thi pool
i turned and turned a hundred a thousand revolutions were made in augmenting frenzy for now i desperately realized that each crank was bringing me closer and closer to the secret of the bottomless pool
suddenly the winch jammed
i stared in dismay then saw that the drum was full
then i leapt in front of the windlass and grabbed the remaining wire in my hands
it took a second but i experienced a year
through fever and fog came images of what i might expect to find at the end of my line bloated corpse blue and swollen with the line gripped between deathclenched teeth the shapeless body of a child long mired in the slime of the pit seamonster
but no it could not be
there was a fisher down there a fisher that baited cunningly this hook and sent a wire line upwards to entrap children and wanderers and curious men
and the fisher had taken martin and was now entangled in this line
a fisher in a black and bottomless pool i was drawing in a fisher from below
the rays of the flashlight on the bank now gleamed upon the surface of the scummy waters but they were still no longer
in oozing eddies they bubbled and swirled and black slime was tossed upwards as i drew th cutting wire through my hands
a terrific force was pulling against me and fright alone conspired to intensify the strength of my grip
at that moment i would gladly have released my hold but sheer hysteria made my muscles rigid
slowly inexorably i drew the final length of the wire from the water in the yellow light
the fisher emerged
i cannot remember if i screamed aloud but there was the sound made by utter fear ringing and crashing against my brain
for i saw the creature of the pit saw the strangled neck about which the tangling wire had wound and allowed me to pull the fisher upwards
i saw what filled the sixfoot surface of the pool as it emerged
it was a head shaped by horrors dreams alone
not human not reptilian not froglike it was less featured with great staring yellow eyes snouted like a saurian and covered with a greenish batrachoid skin that glistened slickly against the yellow light
the monstrous bulging eyes rolled wildly and dilated in agony as the creature opened its great slitted mouth in a soundless choking gasp
i stared into a red maw that was fanged in a manner unknown to any beast still roaming earth and as i did so a sickening realization swept over me
this was the fisher
an instant only did that gigantic glistening head rise greenly above the waters of the pool then my clippers were out the wire snapped with a shrill twang and the fisher from below sank beneath the bubbling black waves with a thunderous splash of slime
i stared down blankly into the depths as the waters quickly became quiescent once again
i could see nothing but i did not wish to
i did not wish to learn what manner of horrid life flourished unnaturally at the bottom of this opening wherever that bottom might be
i did not care to speculate upon the cunning intelligence of a primal entity which even now fished for men from its lair in the black deep
i did not think i could endure surmises which now clamored for consideration
was this the only creature of its kind or were there more down there
what inversion of sane natural laws allowed existence in nighted depths and what manner of ghastly intelligence prompted prehistoric beasts to set bait for men
were there other such openings in the earths concealing crust through which the madness below had access to humanity
but what i most devoutly tried to keep from thinking about was the scraped sides of the poolbank and the reasons for it
only the head of the monster had emerged and it had filled the pool
the sides were scraped by the shoulders and the sixfoot pool bad not been wide enough to permit the passage of the body
fog and fever were merciful releases
i know that i dumped the windlass in the pool and it sank like a plummet and i dimly remember running back through the swamp ill the next few days and then the police came and i told them what i dared
they have seen the pool but they have said nothing of their opinion to me
i told them more today and will tell them all i know soon not to preserve my freedom but because now i want the spot boarded up
it must be lest others see the bait it must be boarded up for it cannot be filled up
i shall tell them soon or let them read this
they can think me demented if they like but i trust they believe enough to act and act promptly
perhaps if even then they do not believe i may show them the hook i have tre hook from the wire in the pool which i cut off
i hate to reveal it to them for i detest the very memory of the thing myself
it is made of some golden metal harder than pure gold
it is cut and rudely shaped and i dislike to conceive of the creatures who deliberately formed it for its horrid purpose and made the wire to which it was attached
i cannot bear to think of the civilization behind such a creative effort
and worst of all is the memory of those designs in the metal
those designs created by what primal artist
there are three of them cut into the gold surface
they tell all so that i know only too well why the fishers seek men with bait from their bottomless pits
the first design is tiny like the rest but it unmistakably depicts a creature such as the one whose head i saw
i dare not describe the body which is shown here
but the creature is baiting a hook
the second little design is a crude representation of a man falling through water at the end of a line as martin must have fallen
and the third design but i must not speak of that tells of what fate was tells why the fishers fish
that third hellish design on the hookl it shows a feast
the bottomless pool must be boarded up
out of the piledup centuries comes an inexorable summons for the twin of isames
by author of murder in the wax works king of voodoo etc not a dream
despite the fact that she had distinctly remembered going to bed as a last conscious effort after the stormy interview with artemus eusso marjorie westbrook knew as she had known about other weird instances in her life that this was stark and cold reality
there was no state of transition between the pleasant business of retiring and this instinct awareness of an incredible situation
simply she had gone to bed in her lovely chamber at home in forest hills as marjorie westbrook heiress to the westbrook motor millions her mind filled with business details over the present policies of the late george automobile factories
and here she was wide awake and standing before an altar in front of her an altar of ancient egyptian motif with the sacred ibis projecting in relief at the ends like figureheads of ships
she stood in her bare feet upon a cold floor of tesselated marble
moreover the satin nightdress the last item of dress she remembered donning was gone
she stood there in complete nudity but she was conscious of no sense of shame or modesty
without seeing it for she was powerless to turn she was aware of an immensity of space which crystal ball turned inky black tended in all directions behind her a space blocked out with intangible green mist that was almost black and almost of the density of velvet drapes at her right hand was an upright sarcophagus with the lid removed
within the musty and spicily pungent interior was the wrapped figure of a mummy a mummy which queerly enough was headless
it was all like closing her eyes upon a scene in a cinema for an instant to open them upon a sudden change of locale
with this cant difference there was no continuity no relevance no congruity no connection between her life and this grotesque pattern
none
there were of course her previous experiences those strange uncanny interludes in her otherwise prosaic life
but there was no tangible connection unless you considered the sarcophagus which looked exactly like the one she had purchased some months before even to the headless mummy in the musty interior
somehow and marjorie could not explain it that sarcophagus which should have been in her boudoir was here with her in this other world
that egyptian sarcophagus as soon as she had seen it she had been resolved to possess it
its fascination for her had been but the apex of an amazing sequence of bizarre occurrences and it blended as a perfect complement with those experiences
marjorie now became aware that just beyond the altar before which she stood was the figure of a man in a cowled crimson robe his hands busy at a set of dials and buttons before him
and the craziest and most outre part of it all was the monks face
he was art emus russo general manager of westbrook motors
yet there was a strangeness about him that was not russo
before she had time to cry out to question him to demand an explanation marjorie noticed the light
she was outlined in a glow of light like a psychic aura of unbelievable intensity shading from pure white to garish green mantling her in a bath of living light
as she stared down at her lovely form to her horror she saw the flesh become translucent transparent and finally invisible and the skeletal structure of her body from neck to toe became hideously revealed in glowing pink
still bound by invisible chains which kept her motionless but without pain marjorie heard the cowled figure speak and the tones of his voice awakened a thousand memories in her mind memories which were not of the welltailored artemus russo who shouted so irately about proxies and assets and common stock of westbrook motors inc the hour has come princess he said to fulfill your destiny
ankhtares she gasped giving him a name which came easily from her lips
no no i am not ready
her own answer startled her profoundly shook her to the depths of her soul
that was what made these bizarre occurrences in her life so distressing
it implied knowledge on her part of monstrous things from the womb of time about which she as marjorie westbrook should have known nothing
but she did know
even now answering so easily to the title of princess yet aware of herself as marjorie westbrook she remembered similar experiences first had happened when she was a child of ten
without warning she had passed from a safely mundane world to a shadowy temple of vast halls and towering pillars
going to bed all tired out from a day of happy play falling quickly asleep suddenly she was standing before a high altar whose sides were a frieze of jackalheaded dolls of angular lines
or were they dolls
how was a little girl of ten to know
yet they were not strange to her
without knowing how she knew she was as familiar with the symbol of anubis as she was with her own sister the twin who had always walked beside her
sister
with a start she realized that another little girl was standing with her before that forbidding altar with its plume of curling incense
the little companion was an exact duplicate of herself dressed in archaic headdress and queerly draped robe of costly silk with beaten gold design in the hem
on her ankles and arms bracelets glittered one in the form of a coiled serpent with eyes of emerald green
this was isames
without being told marjorie knew that her own name was isira
it had always been isira for ten years of egyptian childhood as a princess of the royal blood
there was no marjorie westbrook in this consciousness and yet she knew she was marjorie westbrook and that sir gerwain was waiting for her out in her fathers kennels
in a way it was terrifying and marjorie isira whimpered
be brave isira whispered isames
it is our heritage
before marjorie could reply there was movement behind the altar and ankhtares high priest of ammon a cold and stern man with the features of artemus russo her fathers secretary swam into view
there was a strange light in his piercing black eyes as he looked out and down upon the two little girls who stood before the altar to the dead tightly clasping each others hands
princess isira and princess isames he spoke in a sonorous voice which echoed hollowly through the great hall of the temple in accordance with the rule of your house blessed under the sign of the ansata and dedicated to the service of ra you are here to choose your destiny
are you prepared
we are prepared ankhtares marjorie heard herself and her sister reply
that the language was not modern english she did not even note
the high priest passed his hand above the curling incense rising from the altar in a cabalistic sign and blue smoke fairly boiled up in writhing convolutions that had sparks of incandescent red
the figure of the high priest was obscured for a moment and both little girls trembled
then he came back into view
in this the third era in the second dynasty of ptolemy his compelling voice rolled out it is written in the seventh book of anubis that of twin princes or princesses of the direct line of pharaoh only one can ascend to the throne
herein lies the parting paths of destiny
for one there is the sceptre of a queen wealth and glory and power and death before her youth has faded
for the other there is a timeless void until her spirit shall find life and happiness in a future existence and then she shall grow old before her time
and in the end the twain shall be reunited by a bond far stronger than that of natal ties
it is so written
choose well ye little princesses
behold the sacred ibis awaits to carry the word to ammon giver of all
both little girls clung together and quivered in wideeyed fright as they saw the blue smoke take the form of the sacred bird
the words of the high priest were incomprehensible to them but they stared at the shadowy bird of ra and spoke bravely want to be a queen said isames want to be happy said isira
with a puff of smoke the nebulous ibis disappeared
so be it said the voice of ankhtares
there was a flash of blinding light and little marjorie westbrook opened her eyes to find the looming sun streaming in at the window and to hear the excited yelping of sir gerwain her wolfhound outside
that had happened when she was ten
now at twentyfive in the very midst of undergoing a similar experience she was able to recall that earlier one stared down in a mounting sort of mental fear as she watched her body entirely disappear from beneath her leaving only the faintly glowing frame of her bony structure
and as she watched even that began to fade away in the bath of terrible light the source of which she could not determine
soon she would be a disembodied head floating above the strange floor
the hour is at hand princess isira said the cowled priest for the fulfillment of your destiny
the sands of time have run their interminable course
beyond human comprehension is the working of the infinite
you behold on your right the sarcophagus of isames queen of the nile taken unto the arms of anubis and thoth in her twentysixth year
alas only her chu preserved body remains
her ka soul bird with human head has departed for the sun temple of amraon her sacred crypt was violated by vandals and desecrators of the dead but you can behold her likeness on the lid of the sarcophagus in beaten gold
marjorie westbrook or the consciousness that was marjorie westbrook stared at the cover of the ornate case and nearly swooned in astonishment she recalled the face on the lid of her own sarcophagus the one in her boudoir and how its haunting familiarity had puzzled arid intrigued her
but always it bad remained vague and dim
now like the sensitized image on a print that has just been withdrawn from developing fluid the golden features bathed in that eerie glow were exact duplicates of her own
it was as though she stared into a burnished mirror of gold
even the wide staring eyes seemed alive with the color and expression of her own eyes
and still this fantastic this outre and bizarre experience was no dream
majorie westbrook was as thoroughly awake as she would ever be
never since that soulshaking and impossible thing which had happened to her at the age of ten had she experienced awake or asleep any further manifestation which included so much as a mention of the lost isames
in her nocturnal materializations and there had been at least one for every year of her life she had never again seen this strange twin sister or heard of her until now
it came to marjorie with a dreadful thrill that she was in her own twentysixth year right now
not once during her entire life had she ever mentioned these weird adventures to anyone not even to her doctor
it was a closed and sealed book from the world from even marjorie herself except in the throes of the fantastic episodes
but it was not a dream life she knew that
it was some horrible destiny an actual and solid fate of terrific force and dim unguessed purpose that stalked her
and it did not feed solely upon the hours of night a mere figment of her imagination
there was that day when she was seventeen and her father had taken her to the county fair
normal happy lighthearted girl of a modern age she had clapped her hands in delight when the old gipsy hag in the gaycolored booth wanted to tell her fortune
but no sooner had marjorie seated herself across the table of sand from the woman than the crystal ball thereon turned inky black
the woman started in utter dismay and quickly flung a cloth over the ball
she blanched almost white as she stared with her sharp black eyes into blue ones
let me see your right hand she said in a tense whisper
obligingly marjorie stretched out her slim and girlish hand palm up
without touching her the gipsy stared with bulging eyes her golden earrings adance with violent agitation
no she whispered
no no i cannot read your destiny child
but that isnot fair pouted marjorie paid you a silver dollar
you must read my fortune
here is your money said the old woman beginning to shake all over wonot have it back declared marjorie defiantly
keep it and read my fortune
gipsy groaned
i cannot she articulated with difficulty dare not
i see only that you have a double existence
you will grow old before your time incredibly old
how old demanded marjorie thinking the gipsy was putting on a very good act
perhaps perhaps six thousand years choked out the other and then with a wild cry the woman fled from the booth
that experience had taken place in broad daylight had occurred to marjorie westbrook without any transition into another entity another sphere of life
so she knew she was not crazy
and she knew she did not dream these yearly episodes which wove that strange irrelevant and inexplicable pattern through her otherwise normal and sane existence
no
no she cried out in horror now against a dread of she knew not what as her skeleton completely disappeared
but her protests were as naught to this high priest of ammon who was the counterpart of artemus russo
and marjorie became aware of a pair of hands cold and clammy as early morning fog off the sound which gripped her head
she rolled her eyes to see a greengray figure that had materialized behind her a disembodied spirit that was human only in outline an elemental even an ectoplasmic projection of ankhtares
she opened her mouth to scream in terror but no sound came
she thought she was in a silent world of chimeras
and the creature carried her bodyless head like a football across the intervening space and set it firmly on the shoulders of the linenwrapped mummy within the sarcophagus thy destiny has been fulfilled came the voice of ankhtares
at last we shall both have peace
there was that blinding flash of light which marjorie westbrook had come to know so well and everything went into the oblivion of nothingness opened her eyes
the maid was letting in the sunshine
she was safe at home in her own bed in forest hills the covers drawn snugly up to her chin
miss westbrook said the maid softly it is eleven oclock
mr russo is waiting to see you in the sitting room
he insisted that i wake you as he has to attend that board meeting
he said he must have your final word
marjorie smiled
her personal relief was so great that she felt in a most melting mood toward the manager of her affairs
very well she said
tell him i am ready to sign those proxies for him and wind things up
wait help me up first
she threw back the silken coverlet preparatory to sitting up
bring over the she broke off in stunned horror
as she moved it sounded like the rattling of parchment and dried bones
as she tossed back the cover instead of a satin night negligee from paris upon the lovely body of a beauty she exposed the graybrown and dried skin of an egyptian mummy
her hands were two shrunken claws the outline of the bones showing plainly from elbow to fingers
one terrible shriek marjorie westbrook gave ere death overtook her
the horrible episodes of her nocturnal life had finally broken through the barrier that had always surrounded and protected her had overtaken her at last
the six thousand years were up
the maid stared petrified at the lovely head perfectly joined to that of the mummy of an egyptian woman
her eyes rolled wildly to a corner of the room where her mistress prized sarcophagus stood and she screamed
the lid was off and the headless mummy that should have reposed in the case was gone
mr russo
mr russo she cried as she fled to the outer room
her voice choked cut off abruptly as she stared at the couch where she had left the general manager sitting
lying fulllength on the couch was artemus russo his body as still as death and his face parchment yellow and amazingly horribly wrinkled with lines that told of the passage of centuries

a deal of curiosity has been aroused by the strange affair of the lost bells of mission san xavier
many have wondered why when the bells were discovered after remaining hidden for over a hundred and fifty years they were almost immediately smashed and the fragments buried secretly
in view of the legends of the remarkable tone and quality of the bells a number of musicians have written angry letters asking why at least they were not rung before their destruction and a permanent record made of their music
as a matter of fact the bells were rung and the cataclysmic thing that happened at that time was the direct reason for their destruction
and when those evil bells were shrieking out their mad summons in the unprecedented blackness that shrouded san xavier it was only the quick action of one man that saved the world yes i do not hesitate to say it from chaos and doom
as secretary of the california historical society i was in a position to witness the entire affair almost from its inception
i was not present of course when the bells were unearthed but arthur todd the president of the society telephoned me at my home in los angeles soon after that illfated discovery
he was almost too excited to speak coherently found them he kept shouting
the bells ross
found them last night back in the pinos range the most remarkable discovery since since the rosetta stone what are you talking about
i asked groping in a fog of drowsiness
the call had brought me from my warm bed
the san xavier bells of course he explained jubilantly seen them myself
just where junipero serra buried them in a hiker found a cave in the pinos and explored it and there was a rotting wooden cross at the end with carving on it
i brought what did the carving say i broke in
eh
oh just a minute i have it here
listen let no man hang the evil bells of the mutsunes which lie buried here lest the terror of the night rise again in nueva california
the mutsunes you know were supposed to have had a hand in casting the bells know i said into the transmitter
their shamans were supposed to have put a magic spell on them wondering about that todd said
there have been some very unusual things happening up here only got two of the bells out of the cave another you know but the mexicans wonot go in the cave any more
they say well theyre afraid of something
but get that bell if i have to dig it up myself
want me to come up there
if you will todd said eagerly phoning from a cabin in coyote canyon
i left denton my assistant in charge
suppose i send a boy down to san xavier to guide you to the cave
all right i assented
send him to the xavier hotel be there in a few hours is perhaps a hundred miles from los angeles
i raced along the coast and within two hours i had reached the little mission town hemmed in by the pinos range drowsing sleepily on the edge of the pacific
i found my guide at the hotel but he was oddly reluctant to return to camp can tell you how to go senor
you will not get lost
the boys dark face was unnaturally pale beneath its heavy tan and there was a lurking disquiet in his brown eyes donot want to go back i jingled some coins not as bad as all that is it
i asked
afraid of the dark
he flinched
si the the dark its very dark in that cave senor
the upshot was that i had to go alone trusting to his directions and mv own ability in the open
dawn was breaking as i started up the canyon trail but it was a strangely dark dawn
the sky was not overcast but it held a curious gloom
i have seen such oppressively dark days during dust storms but the air seemed clear enough
and it was very cold although even from my height i could see no fog on the pacific
i kept on climbing
presently i found myself threading the gloomy chill recesses of coyote canyon
i shivered with cold
the sky was a dull leaden color and i found myself breathing heavily
in good physical condition the climb had tired me unduly
yet i was not physically tired it was rather an aching oppressive lethargy of mind
my eyes were watering and i found myself shutting them occasionally to relieve the strain i wished the sun would come over the top of the mountain
then i sawsomething extraordinary and horrible
it was a toad gray fat ugly
it was squatting beside a rock at the side of the trail rubbing itself against the rough stone
one eye was turned toward me or rather the place where the eye should have been
there was no eye there was only a slimy little hollow
the toad moved its ungainly body back and forth sawing its head against the rock
it kept uttering harsh little croaks of pain and in a moment it had withdrawn from the stone and was dragging itself across the trail at my feet
i stood looking at the stone nauseated
the gray surface of rock was bedaubed with whitish streaks of fetor and the shredded bits of the toads eye
apparently the toad had deliberately ground out its protruding eyes against the rock
it crept out of sight beneath a bush leaving a track of slime in the dust of the trail
i involuntarily shut my eyes and rubbed them and suddenly jerked down my hands startled at the roughness with which my fists had been digging into my eyesockets
lancing pain shot through my temples
remembering the itching burning sensation in my eyes i shuddered a little
had the same sort of torture caused the toad deliberately to blind itself
my god on up the trail
presently i passed a cabin probably the one from which todd had telephoned for i saw wires running from the roof to a tall pine
i knocked at the door
no answer continued my ascent
suddenly there came an agonized scream knifeedged and shrill and the rapid thudding of footsteps
i stopped listening
someone was running down the trail toward me and behind him i could hear others racing shouting as they ran
around a bend in the trail a man came plunging
he was a mexican and his blackstubbled face was set in lines of terror and agony
his mouth was open in a square of agony and insane screams burst horribly from his throat
but it wasnot that that sent me staggering back out of his path cold sweat bursting out on my body
his eyes had been gouged out and twin trickles of blood dripped down his face from black gaping hollows
as it happened there was no need for me to halt the blinded mans frantic rush
at the curve of the trail he smashed into a tree with frightful force and momentarily stood upright against the trunk
then very slowly he sagged down and collapsed in a limp huddle
there was a great splotch of blood on the rough bark
i went over to him quickly
four men came running toward me
i recognized arthur todd and denton his assistant
the other two were obviously laborers
todd jerked to a halt
ross
good god is he dead swiftly he bent over to examine the unconscious man
denton and i stared at each other
denton was a tall stronglybuilt man with a shock of black hair and a broad mouth that was generally expanded in a grin
now his face bore a look of horrified disbelief
god ross he did it right before our eyes denton said through pale lips
he just let out a scream threw up his hands and tore his eyes out of their sockets
he shut his own eyes at the memory
todd got up slowly
unlike denton he was small wiry nervously energetic with a lean brown face and amazingly alert eyes
dead he said happened
i asked trying to keep my voice steady wrong todd
was the man insane
and all the while i had a picture of that fat toad tearing out its eyes against a rock
todd shook his head his brows drawn together in a frown donot know
ross do your eyes feel odd
a shiver ran through me
damned odd
burning and itching been rubbing them continually on the way up
so have the men denton told me
so have we
see
he pointed to his eyes and i saw that they were redrimmed and inflamed
the two laborers mexicans came over to us
one of them said some118 thing in spanish
todd barked a sharp order and they fell back hesitating
then without further parley they took to their heels down the trail
denton started forward with an angry shoot but todd caught his arm
no use he said quickly have to get the bells out ourselves
you found the last one
i asked as he turned back up the trail
we found them all three todd said somberly
denton and i dug up the last one ourselves
and we found this too drew a dirtencrusted greenish metal tube from his pocket and gave it to me
within the cylinder was a sheet of parchment in a remarkably good state of preservation
i puzzled over the archaic spanish script
let me todd said taking it carefully
he translated expertly
on the twentyfirst of june by the favor of god the attack by the pagan mutsunes having been repulsed the three bells cast a month ago were buried in this secret cave and the entrance sealed but a landslide obviously opened it up again recently todd broke off to explain
inasmuch as evil witchcraft was practiced by the indians when we suspended and rang the bells the evil demon whom the mutsunes call was called from his dwelling beneath the mountains and brought the black night and the cold death among us
the large cross was overthrown and many of the people were possessed of the evil demon so that the few of us who retained our senses were hard put to it to overcome their fiendinspired attack and remove the bells
afterward we gave thanks to god for our preservation and gave aid to those who were injured in the fray
the souls of those who perished were commended to god and we prayed that the san antonio would soon arrive to relieve us from this cruel solitude
i charge whomever may find these bells should it not please god to allow me to fulfill this duty to send them to rome in the name of our master the king
may god guard him
todd paused and carefully returned the parchment to its case
junipero serra signed it he said quietly
lord what a find
i exulted
but surely you donot think theres anything who said i did
todd snapped in a voice that betrayed his nervous tension some logical explanation superstition and autosuggestion are a bad combination
i sarto denton asked with a note of apprehension in his voice
we were standing at the edge of a little clearing bare and rocky
sarto
i asked
he has the cabin down the trail todd said
you must have passed it
i left him here with the bells when jose had his seizure we better get body to town
i asked
todd frowned think me brutal he said
but these bells i canot leave them here
the mans dead
we canot help him and itll take all three of us to get the bells to town too bad the poor chap didnot have sense of direction he finished with a grim smile
he wouldnot have run into the tree then
he was right
i believe that denton could have traversed the entire trail blindfolded after having once ascended it
he had a remarkable memory and sense of direction like those indians who could unerringly find their way to their wigwams across hundreds of miles of wilderness
later this trait of was to be of vital importance but no premonition of this came to us at the time
we had climbed the rocky mountain slope above the clearing and had come out in a little glade among the pines
nearby was a gaping hollow in the ground around it evidence of a recent landslide
where the devil todd said staring around
how gone denton said in amazement
and the bells with him then we heard it a faint hollow musical note the sound of a bell hitting wood
it came from above us and glancing up the slope we saw an odd sight
a man gaunt bearded with a blazing thatch of red hair was tugging at a rope he had stretched over the branch af a pine
at the other end of the rope slowly they rose silhouetted against the sky the lost bells of san xavier
gracefully curved they glowed bronze even beneath their stains and verdigris and they were silent for they had no clappers
once or twice they swung against the trunk of the pine and sent out a hollow mournful note
how the man could lift that great weight was inexplicable i could see the muscles cord and knot on his bare arms as he strained
his eyes were bulging and his teeth clenched in a grinning mouth
sarto
denton cried starting to clamber up the slope
what are you doing the man jerked his head around and stared at us
the rope slipped through his fingers and we saw the bells plunge down
with a frightful effort he clutched the rope and halted their descent momentarily but the strain threw him off balance
he tottered overbalanced and came crashing down the slope and behind him overtaking him rolled and bounded the bells throbbing and booming as they clashed against rocks
god i heard todd whisper
the mad fool
there was a maelstrom of dust and flying shale on the slope above
i heard a sickening crunch and denton threw himself desperately aside
through the dust i saw one of the bells smash down on the sliding body of sarto and then i was stumbling away scrubbing furiously at my eyes blinded by the flying particles of dirt
the rattle and roar subsided slowly as i clung to a tree
i blinked glanced around
almost at my feet was one of the bells
there was a great crimson stain upon it
the body of sarto was visible jammed into a bush on the slope above
and a few feet below it propped upright against a jagged rock was battered gory head
thus ended the first act of the drama i was to witness
the bells were to be hung two weeks later

continued from page torical societies to san
xavicr from all over the world were planned
in the cold daylight of logic outside the eerie atmosphere of the pinos mountains the unusual occurrences during the unearthing of the bells were easily explained
a virulent kind of poisoning perhaps similar to poison oak or some fungus hidden in the cave with the relics had been responsible for our optical irritation and the madness of sarto and the mexican
neither denton todd nor i denied this explanation but we discussed the matter at length among ourselves
denton went so far as to drive down to the huntington library to view the forbidden johann negus translation of the book of lod that abhorrent and monstrous volume of ancient esoteric formulae about which curious legends still cling
only a single copy of the original volume written in the prehuman ancient tongue is said to exist
certainly few even know of the expurgated johann negus translation but denton had heard vague rumors about a passage in the book which he declared might be connected with the legends of the san xavier bells
when he returned from los angeles he brought a sheet of foolscap paper covered with his execrable penmanship
the passage he had copied from the book of lod was this the dark silent one dwelleth deep beneath the earth on the shore of the western ocean
not one of those potent old ones from hidden worlds and other stars is he for in earths hidden blackness he hath always dwelt
no name hath he for he is the ultimate doom and the undying emptiness and silence of old night
when earth is dead and lifeless and the stars pass into the blackness he will rise again and spread his dominion over all
for he hath naught to do with life and sunlight but loveth the blackness and the eternal silence of the abyss
yet can he be called to earths surface before his time and the brown ones who dwell on the shore of the western ocean have power to do this by ancient spells and certain deeptoned sounds which reach his dwellingplace far below
but there is great danger in such a summoning lest he spread death and night before his time
for he bringeth darkness within the day and blackness within the light all life all sound all movement passeth away at his coming
he cometh sometimes within the eclipse and althoagh he hath no name the brown ones know him as zushakon
there was a deletion at that point denton said as i glanced up from the excerpt
the books expurgated you know very odd todd said picking up the paper and running his eyes over it
but of course its merely a coincidence
certainly since folklore is based on natural phenomena one can generally find modern parallels
the thunderbolts of jove and arrows are merely lightning and sunstroke
never on them does the shining sun look down with his beams denton quoted softly
but deadly night is spread abroad over these hapless men remember odysseus visit to the land of the dead mouth twisted wryly
well what of it
i donot expect pluto to come up from tartarus when the bells are hung
do you this is the twentieth century such things donot happen in fact never did happen
are you sure
denton asked
surely you donot pretend to believe this cold weather were having is normal
i glanced up quickly
i had been wondering when someone would mention the abnormal chill in the air been cold before todd said with a sort of desperate assurance
and overcast too
just because were having some muggy weather is no reason for you to let your imagination get the upper hand good god we went staggering across the room
earthquake denton gasped and we headed for the door
we didnot race for the stairs but remained just beneath the lintel of the doorway
during an earthquake its the safest place in any building on account of the nature and strength of its construction
but there were no more shocks
denton moved back into the room and hurried to the window
look he said breathlessly beckoning hanging the bells
we followed him to the window
from it we could see the mission san xavier two blocks away and in the arches in the bell tower figures were toiling over the three bells
they say when the bells were cast the indians threw the body of a living girl into the boiling metal denton said apropos of nothing know it todd answered snappishly
and the shamans enchanted the bell with their magic be a fool
why shouldnot some peculiar vibration like the sound of a bell create certain unusual conditions
denton asked hotly and i thought i detected a note of fear in his voice
we donot know all there is to know about life tcdd
it may take strange forms or even the booming ominous note of a bell rang out
it was strangely deep thrilling through my eardrums and sending its eerie vibration along my nerves
denton caught his breath in a gasp
a deeper note throbbing sending a curious pain through my head
somehow urgent summoning clang thundering fantastic music such as might issue from the throat of a god or from the heartstrings of the dark angel israfel
was it growing darker
was a shadow creeping over san xavier
was the pacific darkening from sparkling blue to leaden gray to cold blackness then i felt it a premonitory tremble of the floor beneath my feet
the window rattled in its casing
i felt the room sway sickeningly tilt and drop while the horizon seesawed slowly madly back and forth
i heard a crashing from below and a picture dropped from the wall to smash against the floor
denton todd and i were swaying and tottering drunkenly toward the door
somehow i felt that the building wouldnot stand much more
it seemed to be growing darker
the room was filled with a hazy tenebrous gloom
someone screamed shrilly

continued from page spurt of dust spray out from the wall and a bit of plaster dropped away
and suddenly i went blind
at my side denton cried out abruptly and i felt a hand grip my arm
that you ross
i heard todd ask in his calm voice precise as ever
is it dark it denton said from somewhere in the blackness not blind then
where are you the door a violent lurch of the building broke clutch on my arm and i was flung against the wall
over here i shouted above the crashing and roaring
follow my voice
in a moment i felt someone fumbling against my shoulder
it was denton and soon todd joined him
god happening
i jerked out
those damned bells denton shouted in my ear
the book of iod was right
he bringeth darkness within the day mad
todd cried sharply
but punctuating his words came the furious earsplitting dinning of the bells clanging madly through the blackness
why do they keep ringing them
denton asked and answered his own question the earthquakes doing it the quakes ringing the bells
something struck my cheek and putting up my hand i felt the warm stickiness of blood
plaster smashed somewhere
still the earthquake shocks kept up
denton shouted something which i did not catch
what
todd and i cried simultaneously
bells weve got to stop them causing this darkness perhaps the earthquake too vibration canot you feel it
something in the vibration of those bells is blanketing the suns lightwaves
for lights a vibration you know
if we can stop them it would be a fools errand todd cried talking nonsense then stay here
i can find my way will you come ross
for a second i did not answer
all the monstrous references gleaned from our study of the lost bells were flooding back into my mind the ancient god whom the mutsunes were supposed to have the power of summoning by certain deeptoned sounds he corneth sometimes within the eclipse all life passeth away at his coming yet can he be called to earths surface before his time with you denton i said
then damn it so am todd snapped see the end of this
if there is anything not finish but i felt hands groping for mine lead denton told us
take it easy now
i wondered how denton could find his way in that enveloping shroud of jet blackness
then i remembered his uncanny memory and sense of direction
no homing pigeon could make a straighter way to its destination than he
it was a mad odyssey through a black hell of shrieking ruin
flying objects screamed past us unseen walls and chimneys toppled and smashed nearby
frightened hysterical men and women blundered into us in the dark and went shouting away vainly searching for escape from this stygian deathtrap
and it was cold cold
a frigid and icy chill pervaded the air and ray fingers and ears were already numbed and aching
the icy air sent knifeedged pains slashing through my throat and lungs as i breathed
i heard denton and todd wheezing and gasping curses as they stumbled along beside me
how denton ever found his way through that chaotic maelstrom i shall never understand
here
denton shouted
the mission
somehow we mounted the steps
how the mission managed to stand through the grinding shocks i do not know
what probably saved it was the curious regularity of the temblors the quakes were more of a rhythmic slow swaying of the earth than the usual abrupt wrenching shocks
from nearby came a low chanting incongruous in the madness around us
gloria patri filio spiiitui sancto
the franciscans were praying
but what availed their prayers while in the tower the bells were sending out their blasphemous summons
luckily we had often visited the mission and denton knew his way to the tower
on that incredible climb up the stairs to the bell tower i shall not dwell although every moment we were in danger of being dashed down to instant death
but at last we won to the loft where the bells were shrieking their thunder through the blackness almost in our ears
denton released my hand and shouted something i could not distinguish
there was an agony of pain in my head and my flesh ached with the cold
i felt an overpowering impulse to sink down into black oblivion and leave this hellish chaos
my eyes were hot burning aching
for a moment i thought i had lifted my hands unconsciously to rub my eyes
then i felt two arms constrict about my neck and vicious thumbs dug cruelly into my eyesockets
i shrieked with the blinding agony of it
i battled desperately in the darkness battling not only my unknown assailant but fighting back a mad perverse impulse to allow him to gouge out my eyes
within my brain a voice seemed to whisper why do you need eyes blackness is better light brings pain
blackness is best
but i fought fiercely silently rolling across the swaying floor of the belltower smashing against the walls tearing those grinding thumbs away from my eyes only to feel them come fumbling back
and still within my brain that horrible urgent whisper grew stronger you need no eyes
eternal blackness is best
i was conscious of a different note in the clamor of the bells
what was it
there were only two notes now one of the bells had been silenced
somehowe the cold was not so oppressive
and was a grayish radiance beginning to pervade the blackness
certainly the temblors were less violent and as i strained to break away

continued from page from my shadowy opponent i felt the racking shocks subside grow gentler die away altogether
the harsh clangor of the two bells stopped
my opponent suddenly shuddered and stiffened
i rolled away sprang up in the grayness alert for a renewal of the attack
it did not come
very slowly very gradually the darkness lifted from san xavier
grayness first like a pearly opalescent dawn then yellowish fingers of sunlight and finally the hot blaze of a summer afternoon
from the belltower i could see the street below where men and women stared up unbelievingly at the blue sky
at my feet was the clapper from one of the bells
denton was swaying drunkenly his white face splotched with blood his clothing torn and smeared with dust
that did it he whispered
only one combination of sounds could summon the thing
when i silenced one bell he was silent staring down
at our feet lay todd his clothing dishevelled his face scratched and bleeding
as we watched he got weakly to his feet a look of monstrous horror growing in his eyes
involuntarily i shrank back my hands going up protectingly flinched ross he whispered through white lips
my god oss i i couldnot help it
i couldnot help it i tell you
something kept telling me to put out your eyes and too and then to gouge out my own a voice in my head and abruptly i understood remembering that horrible whisper within my brain while i struggled with poor todd
that malignant horror he whom the book of iod called zushakon and whom the mutsunes knew as had sent his evil potent command into our brains commanding us to blind ourselves
and we had nearly obeyed that voiceless dreadful command but all was well now
or was it
i had hoped to close the doors of my memory forever on the entire horrible affair for it is best not to dwell too closely upon such things
and despite the storm of adverse criticism and curiosity that was aroused by the smashing of the bells the next day with the full permission of father bernard of the mission i had fully determined never to reveal the truth of the matter
it was my hope that only three men denton todd and myself might hold the key to the horror and that it would die with us
yet something has occurred which forces me to break my silence and place before the world the facts of the case
denton agrees with me that perhaps thus mystics and occultists who have knowledge of such things may be enabled to utilize their knowledge more effectually if what we fear ever comes to pass
two months after the affair at san xavier an eclipse of the sun occurred
at that time i was at my home in los angeles denton was at the headquarters of the historical society in san francisco and arthur todd was occupying his apartment in hollywood
the eclipse began at pm and within a few moments of the beginning of the obscuration i felt a strange sensation creeping over me
a dreadfully familiar itching manifested itself in my eyes and i began to rub them fiercely
then remembering i jerked down my hands and thrust them hastily into my pockets
but the burning sensation persisted
the telephone rang
grateful for the distraction i went to it hurriedly
it was todd
he gave me no chance to speak
ross ross its back he cried into the transmitter
ever since the eclipse began been fighting
its power was strongest over me you know
it wants me to help me ross i canot keep then silence
todd
i cried
wait hold on just for a few moments be there no answer
i hesitated then hung up and raced out to my car
it was a normal twentyminute drive to apartment but i covered it in seven with my lights glowing through the gloom of the eclipse and mad thoughts crawling horribly in my brain
a motorcycle officer overtook me at my destination but a few hurried words brought him into the apartment house

concluded from page at my side door was locked
after a few fruitless shouts we burst it open
the electric lights were blazing
what cosmic abominations may be summoned to dreadful life by ageold spells and sounds is a question i dare not contemplate for i have a horrible feeling that when the lost bells of san xavier were rung an unearthly and terrible chain of consequences was set in motion and i believe too that the summoning of those evil bells was more effective than we then realized
ancient evils when roused to life may not easily return to their brooding sleep and i have a curious horror of what may happen at the next eclipse of the sun
somehow the words of the hellish book of lod keep recurring to me yet can he be called to earths surface before his time he bringeth darkness all life all sound all movement passeth away at his coming and worst of all that horribly significant phrase he cometh sometimes within the eclipse
just what had happened in apartment i do not know
the telephone receiver was dangling from the wall and a gun was lying beside my friends prostrate form
but it was not the scarlet stain on the left breast of his dressinggown that riveted my horrorblasted stare it was the hollow empty eyesockets that glared up sightlessly from the contorted face that and the crimsonstained thumbs of arthur todd
stories by and many others in the next issue continued iiom page but there was no blood
the flesh was rancid like the body of a dead man long buried
later the corporal would have been courtmartialed for causing the death of the soldiers who had responded to his false signal were it not for the testimony of the private and also the sworn statements by chinese merchants of the village that zombies had long worked in the grain fields beyond the village
this chinese gunner was a zombie he had been placed at this gun and ordered by the satanic will of his master to pull the trigger whenever soldiers appeared before him
like an automaton he had responded until blown to bits removing what demonic power had been able to control his bloodless corpse
zombies
bodies of dead men housing the magic of the devil
who can tell
at least give the devil his due of the devil and his due we think it only fair to do the same for those disciples of lucifer who have some diabolical or praiseworthy comments to make about we canot possibly include the thousands who responded so nobly to our request for letters but we can dip into the brew at random and ladle out extracts from as many letters as we have room for
to all however who wrote in we are grateful as even devils can be and we invite you to continue your personal dissections of our attempts to present the uncanny and strange
here goes then with our brew
a cupful from madle phila pa i was indeed pleased to note the appearance ol the first issue of the cover picture does not typify the type of stories published
please have a real fantastic cover on the next issue many of your interior artists are quite capable of painting excellent covers
thanks for the variety of artists theyre all good with wesso and paul doing the best work it would be a good idea to have several drawings each issue by virgil finlay he is unsurpassable when it comes to illustrating weird fiction
the stories themselves were either good or fair with by tarleton eiske and by ralph farley the most outstanding
it might be a good idea to print stories of pure fantasy in future issues and please subordinate the dead man rising from his grave to wreak vengeance on his killer etc
for his reason i didnot care for henry kuttner usually writes very excellent fantasy but he fell down this time was a nice little piece of fantasy say read anything similar to it before
on the whole the first issue of was fairly good but there is plenty room for improvement
of course theres room for improvement

continued from page and we welcome the suggestions of reader madle
we dip into the cauldron now and come up with the following from harold feating of quincy mass please keep the standard of up to its present level
commenting on the stories in the first issue was superb although written by an author i have never heard of before another grand storv by a longtime favorite of mine hubert bloeh by two more ot my favorite authors derleth and schorer fairly good but not up to thefr usual high standard excellent although keith hammond is also a new name to me by well man is a perfect example of weirdness by another fine weird yarn and another new author
good illustrators in issue wesso morey paul jwck binder is a grand department written as convincingly as any fiction
keep this department
i hope too you will have some kind of a club similar to the sciencefiction league of of which i am a member
and heres to your coining out more frequently
yes were planning a club and will tell you about it in the next issue
down goes the ladle again and we come up with a couple of short spoonsful
reagan pittsburgh pa says tour first issue of hits the spot
the subject matter is varied to suit any taste
so keep up the pood work
would like to see a vampire story in the next issues
a good outright ghost story will not be overlooked either
and gertrude gordon of new york city congratulates and criticizes us with is splendid and am i devotee of fantastic fiction
if it keeps to its present stature it will be in the lead of the several really good magazines dealing with the uncanny
but please not those kind of pictures on the eov through it one day and found to my delight it wasnot but the picture is so misleading
if yon have something definitely fantastic on the cover sure youve got something there
we hope so
stirring the brew around again up pops weaver wright of hollywood calif am sorry to say i found the first issue ol too interesting to ignore
yoo see i get fantasy mags galore including your compnmon magazines and so i had hoped my interests being primarily scientificfictional and my time all occupied that would be too predominantly weird to warrant my actually reading it onlv filing it away to keep my collection complete
but if youre going to offer nifty featnre stories regular like an absorbinguncanny yarn
farley yarn and i enjoyed next best
as for illustrations and by marchioni and sehomburg story however was a grave for its author or maybe it was a ftosiwrltten one complaint poor cover no individuality
one big compliment the novacious motion of every story illustrated by a different artist
and heres some liquid we bring to the surface tagged ross jobe of jefferson city mo i never thought i would ever be in a position to correct an editor and i wouldnot let this chance pass by for lots of money because taken bo many corrections from them
in department lucifer states that king saul haw the ghost of solomon
tut tot according to the bible he asked for and saw the wraith of samuel
the february edition was beyond doubt a fine one
and beyond doubt reader jobe is correct
chalk up one lapsis mentis for lucifer the devil has his weak moments
now bubbling up from our cauldron comes douglas robinson from garrett hill pa i am interested in a organization
i think the magazine is the hest of its kind
please send me information about ths items of king saul and salem
i would like to get any kino of information and stories of black arts
for king saul we refer you to the first book of samuel chapter verses and for salem witchcraft among others there are the following books narratives of witchcraft cases by george burr sundry documents of witchcraft in mass by geo
chamberlain new england historical society and witchcraft in salem by john fiske houghton mifflin co
our ladle dips up a weighty bowlful from mason of toronto ontario absorbed the criticisms and suggestions as well as the praises and will give proper consideration to them but all we have room for now are a few comments on the stories the stories are for the most part very good and rate as follows and tied for first place
if you produce three such stories as these per issue i wonot be doing much growling little gem would take second place short htt me in somewhat the bame way as well mans nice and pleasing
then come till and followed by very well written but not quite bizarre enough and finally another list by dodson of baltimore md who thinks the first issue shows promise of excellence rates stories in following order by wellman by cornier by hammond hv farlev by derleth and schorer bv fiske hv kline hv kuttner by bloch
bill oconnor of hartford conn expresses his opinion as follows congrats on new magazine and super con grats to keith hammond for his a 5star story
the others stars stars stars stars stars stars
thanks to everybody and keep those swell letters rolling in
