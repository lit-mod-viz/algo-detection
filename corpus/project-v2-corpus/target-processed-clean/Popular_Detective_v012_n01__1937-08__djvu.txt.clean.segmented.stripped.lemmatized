the nose a trifle too thin and mobile suggest the wolf 
the thin almost colorless mouth add to the illusion 
the manner in which -PRON- wear -PRON- hair sleek draw sharply back from -PRON- forehead add to the animal likeness 
the expensive material and tailoring of the lounge suit -PRON- wear do nothing to dispel the illusion 
neither do the gardenia in -PRON- buttonhole

-PRON- tooth be white and small and sharp 
-PRON- voice be still calm still cold but like the slashing of a wolfs fang shall expect -PRON- to straighten this matter out -PRON- say be impatient with failure 
i will not tolerate failure

i didnot like relative 
-PRON- didnot make -PRON- like -PRON- any more to have arthur fitch say why be mr tevin here 
-PRON- have no connection with the family 
a reading of a will be certainly a private thing 
be there any clause in the will forbid -PRON- to bring a friend demand harriet spunkily 
cook look over the top of -PRON- reading glass fussy but not unkindly 
as far as the will be concern -PRON- may bring any one -PRON- please miss warner 
with that settle cook drone over the content of the will guess have be right 
-PRON- get the house and ground and all therein contain 
the dead man brother and nephew share about fortyeight thousand dollar in cash 
such be the essence of -PRON- 
cook start pack paper in -PRON- briefcase 
corey fitch and ralph packer walk to the french window ignore harriet and -PRON- 
arthur fitch go toward the back of the house 
a later -PRON- horrified shout come to -PRON- 
-PRON- god 
strine 
i run through the rear door of the living room through the dining room with the rest at -PRON- heel 
arthur fitch wasnot shout any more but i could hear -PRON- heavy breathing like sob and i run for that 
i find -PRON- in the kitchen 
fitch stand beside a table stare down at something 
something of which i could see only two leg sprawl in grotesque angle on the floor 
i jump to the table and look down ata corpse 
-PRON- be strine 
-PRON- lie on -PRON- face in a red pool 
from -PRON- back stick the wooden handle of a butcher knife 
the blade have pierce heart never know what hit -PRON- 
i turn to keep harriet back but -PRON- have already see 
-PRON- face be the color of death 
-PRON- look at -PRON- with horror in -PRON- eye then stare at the dead man again 
-PRON- do to -PRON- try to doto -PRON- -PRON- whisper through white lip 
i put -PRON- arm around -PRON- shoulder and help -PRON- back to the living room 
then i call the boynton sheriff thinking of one thing 
the old servant urgent whisper to lawyer cook get something i must tell -PRON- have strine be kill to prevent -PRON- speaking to cook 
but what could -PRON- have have to say that lead to murder 
-PRON- hadnot be give anything in the will but a home in this house for the rest of -PRON- life 
nothing there to kill -PRON- for 
the sheriff come from boynton 
-PRON- name be schule and -PRON- have a belly and chinablue eye that stick out 
i didnot think much of -PRON- 
if i didnot like schule i care even less for relative in the red light of murder 
ralph packer be greyface with fear and -PRON- closeset dark eye dart everywhere at once 
corey dark face be bloodcongeste and -PRON- eye glitter in a feverish way 
arthur fitch wander around with -PRON- hand in -PRON- pocket and -PRON- slitlike mouth as hard as granite 
a sadist mouth 
how the hell have a girl like harriet emerge from -PRON- brood 
schule start with -PRON- first alone in the living room 
do -PRON- hear the old man yell or anything when -PRON- be kill in the kitchen 
no i say 
-PRON- wouldnot have be able to yell 
-PRON- be strike from behind and the blow kill -PRON- instantly 
when i want opinion ask for -PRON- snap schule 
-PRON- just answer question 
be -PRON- in the kitchen between the time -PRON- get here and the time strine be find dead 
i shake -PRON- head 
get proof of that 
miss warner can tell -PRON- 
i be in the living room with -PRON- from the minute i set foot in the house -PRON- only proof 
schule look as triumphant as though -PRON- would discover something 
be strine kill before -PRON- gather in here do -PRON- think 
or afterward 
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- didnot want opinion i remind -PRON- a duly authorize officer of the law be bluster get purple 
-PRON- answer -PRON- question 
okay 
-PRON- want -PRON- to say whether strine be kill by the man who find -PRON- body arthur fitch or not donot know 
but i think strine be kill before the will be read while everybody be out in back except miss warner and -PRON- 
the blood have begin to coagulate a little when i get to -PRON- 
yeah but which could have do -PRON- mutter schule for a minute not pompous 
the two fitch brother old cook ralph packer -PRON- jerk -PRON- up 
but donot think lettin -PRON- and miss warner out just because -PRON- s pretty and -PRON- be a private detective 
tell miss warner to come in here bad luck to paste a sheriff on the jaw so i just go out 
the rest be in the dining room 
somehow -PRON- flesh crawl when i see -PRON- silent and whiteface sit around the dining room table like so many ghost 
i look at harriet who sit a little apart next to old cook 
someone in this room -PRON- be almost certain have try twice to kill -PRON- 
the same person with almost equal certainty have murder strine 
but why 
i motion silently for -PRON- to go in to the sheriff 
a hidden treasure the sheriff be grill the rest i move around 
i have swing back to -PRON- first belief 
something valuable be hide around this place that make bequest the rich of the lot 
something know only to the killer who have try to murder harriet to get -PRON- and have succeed in murder strine to keep -PRON- from give lawyer cook a hint of -PRON- 
that be the only theory that fit in with the attack on the girl the killing of the servant and urgent whisper there be something i must tell -PRON- 
something of value hide here mention in the will only to the extent that harriet get the house and ground and all therein contain 
i set out to track -PRON- down 
the ground as have be say be out 
-PRON- canot bury thingsbond jewelry what notin solid rock 
that leave the house and garage 
the garage be rule out soon wall be solid concrete 
-PRON- floor of cement could not have be disturb without leave a trace anyway under -PRON- be the inevitable rock 
-PRON- ceiling be rafter with shingle lay directly on -PRON- and certainly no valuable article would be hide in a can of oil or a box of tool or the dead man sedan 
that leave only the house which seem doubtful to -PRON- 
the wall be out 
i have notice that the partition wall be of paperthin modern construction 
no room in -PRON- for anything in the first place in the second any disturbance of -PRON- would have mean call in outside labor to replaster or repaper which may have give the hiding place away 
the outer wall be of brick two brick thick 
solid 
-PRON- couldnot hide anything there either i decide 
attic be too obvious 
rudolph pack in build the place have go in for antiquity 
ceiling be beam with bare wood of the floor above show between the beam 
no space there to store thing secretly 
and there be no basement the house rest on solid rock 
that leave the furniture considering which be slightly a melodramatic idea or the trick of hide something right under -PRON- eye 
i walk toward the house white as snow in the moonlight with -PRON- immaculate coat of whitewash see harriet come out of the side door 
-PRON- look around and i wave 
-PRON- come toward -PRON- couldnot stay in there any more -PRON- say in a low voice afraid 
i nod 
that be certainly understandable in view of the probability that a murderer be under that roof 
of course the rest be safe now with the sheriff right in the house but nevertheless harriet couldnot be blame for want to get away 
-PRON- walk slowly around the house toward the front driveway 
i keep look around 
if there have be any lawn ornament i would have investigate -PRON- 
but there be none never see a place so bare of possibility for hide thing 
harriet would have to pull the furniture apart i think if this idea of hide valuable persist enough to make the effort worth while 
i have to admit that i be lose -PRON- own conviction again 
how long will -PRON- be here 
jim -PRON- ask -PRON- wistfully donot know i say 
-PRON- should be able to leave pretty soon now 
-PRON- too i think 
the other well -PRON- depend on the sheriff idea 
and i add but only to mysdf if -PRON- be -PRON- hold the two fitch and -PRON- uncle and give -PRON- plenty grilling 
-PRON- stand look at the road fifty yard or so from the drive 
car hum past 
now and then a local driver recognize the sheriff car at the door would pause a little 
but for the most part -PRON- speed past serenely unaware that a murdered man lie in the snowwhite cape cod cottage 
-PRON- give -PRON- a kind of funny feeling 
harriet grip -PRON- arm suddenly 
what be that 
i hadnot hear anything sound from behind -PRON- -PRON- insist 
around the side of the house 
-PRON- walk back to the corner of the house and around 
and the moment -PRON- round the corner -PRON- see the long dark blotch on the ground next to the white wall 
and harriet scream while i grab -PRON- elbow and turn -PRON- around 
into the house 
get the sheriff 
i go to the long blotchand look down into the dead face of arthur fitch 
a face that be untouched though the bony structure of the head behind -PRON- be a shatter mass 
a mechanic heavy hammer redden and gleam in the moonlight lie near the pulped head rest safe now with the sheriff in the house 
i echo -PRON- thought of a moment ago with a cold chill touch -PRON- bone bump up against a lot of violence in -PRON- life 
but never see anything to match the ruthlessness the icy recklessness of this killer now among -PRON- 
i run on blind impulse to the near door and into the house after harriet 
i didnot want -PRON- out of -PRON- sight 
not any more 
two man dead within a space of an hour and a half 
one of -PRON- murder while a law officer be conduct an investigation under the same roof 
but the sheriff wasnot have any of -PRON- guardianship over the girl 
with two deputy hastily call from the village to watch the dining room in which every one sit -PRON- beckon -PRON- out to the second dead man 
i go leave corey fitch look numb by the shock of -PRON- brother death lawyer cook badly unstrung and fuss with one of the deputy who refuse stolidly to let -PRON- get into -PRON- briefcase and ralph packer a palsy mass of fear 
i have never see a man so frightened as packer 
but -PRON- be not the double fear -PRON- would expect 
the fact that -PRON- be logically a murder suspect didnot seem to occur to -PRON- 
-PRON- be fear of death from the as yet undetected murderer that seem to hold -PRON- most abjectly 
look around outside with schule i catalogue the finding 
-PRON- be pretty easy because -PRON- be so few 
arthur fitch have be kill from behind with the hammer take from a tool box in the garage 
a man could have do -PRON- all in three minute by run from house to garage get the weapon and run back to where fitch stand smoke in the moonlight and return swiftly to the house again 
harriet and i have be in front so -PRON- be out of the way 
why have fitch be outside 
well a half smoked cigarette put out by the damp grass near -PRON- tell that 
-PRON- have be out take a cigarette get relief from the tenseness inside the house 
and the killer have see -PRON- and seize the chance to get rid of -PRON- 
why 
well why have strine be kill and harriet attack 
-PRON- all seem to make increasingly less sense as -PRON- get more complicated 
schule have shed -PRON- pomposity by now 
this second killing do while -PRON- would be within ten yard be go to look like the devil for -PRON- 
-PRON- flash -PRON- light feverishly and pointlessly around be talk to mr packer -PRON- say over and over again say to -PRON- to get arthur fitch in again 
i tell -PRON- to hunt fitch up because -PRON- seem to -PRON- before that fitch have something -PRON- want to say and that -PRON- wasnot quite sure enough a about -PRON- to put -PRON- into word 
something on -PRON- mind 
so i want to talk to -PRON- again 
and then the girl come run in say there s a dead man out on the lawn and -PRON- this guy fitch 
damn -PRON- sure -PRON- have something to say only before -PRON- wasnot positive enough 
-PRON- wouldnot talk against a brother or uncle for instance unless -PRON- know what -PRON- be talk about 
-PRON- send ralph packer after -PRON- 
i repeat 
yeah 
and uncle have kill nephew before 
i think arrest packer 
-PRON- look pathetically relieve 
yeah that s the stuff 
-PRON- must have be pack 
-PRON- go after fitch on -PRON- order find -PRON- alone and kill -PRON- 
why 
eh say why 
what reason would -PRON- have for murder -PRON- sister son 
how would i know 
but that s what must have happen 
where be corey fitch 
schule gnaw -PRON- lip again donot know 
-PRON- wasnot in the dining room 
mr cook can testify to that 
so both the uncle and the brother of this guy be on the loose 
either one may have do -PRON- 
or cook or miss warner or -PRON- i say 
-PRON- eye come back to -PRON- with plenty of suspicion in -PRON- not forgettin -PRON- and the girl be out on the lawn 
keep on remember -PRON- and see what -PRON- get -PRON- i tell -PRON- have a lot of reason for kill guy i never even see before 
miss warner would have a reason 
-PRON- split this guy share of money now 
i bite -PRON- tongue over that one 
-PRON- be so evidentand so unexpected 
harriet have a motive for murder in the eye of the law 
i answer a possible law court as well as schule when i say nut 
i be with -PRON- when both man die 
i see -PRON- be attack -PRON- 
if -PRON- donot want to take -PRON- word for -PRON- just remember how much strength -PRON- take to stick a knife into meat 
miss warner wouldnot have the strength to drive a dull kitchen knife into a man heart from behind 
-PRON- would say schule 
and on that friendly note -PRON- go in to the house again and schule again begin chase in circle to get -PRON- man 
meanwhile i stick close and try to nail the killer on -PRON- own hook 
but i get no farther than schule do 
ralph packer sweat so that perspiration stain show clear through -PRON- blue serge suit say -PRON- have be in the bedroom still search for arthur fitch till just before fitch be kill 
corey fitch claim -PRON- have be in the bathroom 
cook have be in the dining room 
amazingly when -PRON- remember a sheriff presence right in the house any one of -PRON- could have make murderous opportunity out of the fact that arthur fitch have nervously decide to smoke a cigarette in the moonlight grill -PRON- all again one by one 
-PRON- ask some good question at that i note with professional interest 
but -PRON- didnot get anywhere so -PRON- start a second time 
-PRON- be again in the dining room cook and packer and corey fitch and harriet and voice come to -PRON- from the living room 
mr cook 
cook get up moisten -PRON- lip avert -PRON- eye from the door lead into the kitchen 
there be two dead man lie in the kitchen now 
one of the deputy open the dining room door for the lawyer and -PRON- walk through the tiny hall into the living room 
and then just before the deputy have the door close again i see cook stop next to the outside living room door and stare into the night 
-PRON- mouth go slack 
-PRON- hand go up to pluck at -PRON- trembling lip 
and -PRON- yell hoarsely 
-PRON- be a high brittle cry almosl like a woman scream 
-PRON- pointec through the screened doorway 
sheriff 
out there 
oh my god 
the deputy wasnot interested in close the dining room door any more 
-PRON- throw -PRON- wide open and leap toward cook 
schule get there first 
-PRON- hand grip shoulder 
what be -PRON- 
what do -PRON- see out there 
cook fight for word 
when -PRON- do come -PRON- be like icy whip figureout therein the moonlight 
i see -PRON- 
-PRON- look like strine 
in the dark gasp be like a sob 
a sort of moan come from ralph lip 
then i be out of the dining room on the heel of the other deputy and corey fitch 
-PRON- start for the ground 
i didnot 
i go for the kitchen where strine lie 
i get the door open have one glimpse of two sprawled body on the floor and then the light go out 
all of -PRON- 
every light in the place 
i hear fearpacke scream sound out again from the front of the house 
and an instant after that a sound that draw a hoarse shout in echo from -PRON- own lip 
harriet shriek which die in horrible fashion into a choking moan which be succeed by complete silence 
i lunge from the kitchen hit the partly open door in the pitch darkness 
i get to the dining room door and -PRON- be lock against -PRON- 
through -PRON- i could hear a terrible scraping of high heel on hardwood floor 
the sound drive -PRON- crazy for a minute 
i bang -PRON- shoulder against the door back off try jt again 
run step sound outside and the kitchen door to the back yard burst open 
i see four dark shape outline against the moonlight hear voice 
-PRON- god happen now 
strine a voice i think be corey cut the sheriff word off here where -PRON- be before 
anyway there s two body 
these thing i hear with half -PRON- mind 
the rest be in that lock dining room with the girl whose heel be rasp so desperately and convulsively on the floor 
i catch up a kitchen chair and smash -PRON- to kindle against the door 
and the door only quiver a little 
i turn thrust a couple of shadowy figure out of -PRON- way run out the back door and around to the dining room window 
i smash the glass and climb in 
as the glass crash i think i hear a sound across the room from the window but wasnot sure 
in the room dimness i see harriet lie near the table 
i jump to -PRON- side bend down 
i couldnot feel a pulse 
-PRON- face be ghastly in -PRON- pallor 
even in the dim light i could see how -PRON- throat be swell and discolor 
i get -PRON- hand say something or other to -PRON- all the time 
thing i hadnot a right to say so soon 
but -PRON- come out anyway 
i begin work -PRON- arm back and forth in artificial respiration 
i hear somebody yell in the living room and then after quite a little while the light go on 
all of which mean little to -PRON- 
the important fact be that harriet be begin to breathe again and in a little while -PRON- open -PRON- eye 
jim -PRON- whisper talk i say chafe -PRON- wrist and make -PRON- head as comfortable as possible on -PRON- knee 
light go out somebody grab -PRON- 
almost get methis i keep on chafe -PRON- wrist 
almost get -PRON- 
hell -PRON- have be a actually and literally dead 
only artificial breathing have snap -PRON- out of -PRON- again 
i carry -PRON- to the bedroom not leave -PRON- again if the house burn down around -PRON- ear 
i tell -PRON- grimly 
-PRON- smile at -PRON- and rub -PRON- throat 
yes -PRON- be -PRON- say word come painfully lock this window so no one can get in without break the glass and lock the door 
and sit up in bed out of line of the window with -PRON- gun in -PRON- hand get to help the sheriff get this killer jim 
well -PRON- be right though i hate to agree with -PRON- 
and finally i go out hear the key scrape in the lock as -PRON- close the door after -PRON- 
i go to the kitchen first 
old strine lie on the floor as -PRON- have before 
there be the knife handle protrude from -PRON- back with the slowly coagulate blood all around -PRON- 
dead as yesterday mackerel 
the knife handle stick up prove that 
i go to the living room 
why the hell have cook say -PRON- would see strine in the moonlight when that be utterly impossible 
in the living room i get the next shock out of a night of crazy surprise 
old cook lie on a divan with schule and a deputy and corey fitch all bend over -PRON- 
the lawyer forehead be lay open and blood run down -PRON- cheek smearing in -PRON- sparse sideburn 
-PRON- find -PRON- in the living room doorway like this schule say to -PRON- 
the sheriff be completely lose now 
what happen 
i ask cook donot know 
-PRON- voice tremble sawthat horrible figure in the moonlight 
then the other run past -PRON- out the door onto the ground 
i didnot see -PRON- any more but i hear a step behind -PRON- 
and then something hit -PRON- on the head and i be through the light go out 
i ask schule -PRON- have an answer for that if -PRON- didnot for anything else 
-PRON- hold up a pin 
-PRON- be discolor and some of the point have melt off 
-PRON- have be thrust into an electric cable cause a short circuit 
-PRON- find this in the dining room schule say 
i blink at that 
in the dining room 
i remember the procession that have crowd out after yell 
the two deputy corey fitch and -PRON- 
leave two people in the dining room 
harriet and ralph packer be in the living room with the rest of -PRON- 
-PRON- sit in a chair not far from the divan 
i stare at -PRON- suddenly and catch -PRON- closeset eye just slide from -PRON- face 
sweat stand out on -PRON- forehead minute ago i say slowly all of -PRON- run out of the dining room except -PRON- and miss warner 
shortly afterward somebody come within a hair of kill -PRON- 
packer say nothing 
-PRON- heavy breathing sound out 
-PRON- must have be in there when -PRON- be attack i say 
no 
no 
-PRON- voice be thick wasnot 
-PRON- look bad for -PRON- but i wasnot 
i go out just after the rest of -PRON- do leave harriet aldne 
-PRON- own niecesurely -PRON- donot think -PRON- could have come back in again i say after -PRON- would blow the light fuse with that pin didnot 
i be in the living room 
then i snap -PRON- up -PRON- must have see the attack on mr cook 
packer shiver 
-PRON- wipe at -PRON- forehead but new drop of perspiration come out at once couldnot see a thingexcept cook 
i see -PRON- stand there in the doorway and then i hear -PRON- scream and see -PRON- fall 
-PRON- be as if -PRON- have be strike by something invisible 
by a ghost 
-PRON- couldnot have be the one that hit -PRON- by any chance 
i say swear i didnot 
schule join in 
-PRON- be the one i send to find arthur fitch just before -PRON- be kill 
-PRON- be out in back at about the time strine be kill 
-PRON- could have knock mr cook out after -PRON- would blow the light and then could have go back into the dining room after miss warner 
no 
no 
i turn from packer to the old lawyer lie on the divan 
what in the world make -PRON- think -PRON- see a dead out on the lawn 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head weakly donot know 
maybe be think of strine 
when i see a move figure out there i may have fit face to -PRON- because -PRON- be in -PRON- mind 
and yet i donot think that s the explanation 
i see the face so clearly 
i even seem to see aa knife handle stick out of the man back 
-PRON- couldnot have be -PRON- -PRON- see packer cut in swiftly be in the dining room with -PRON- at that minute 
-PRON- know that -PRON- wipe -PRON- forehead which be almost as moist as maybe strine wasnot dead after all -PRON- mutter 
-PRON- didnot feel for -PRON- pulse to find out 
-PRON- take -PRON- for grant -PRON- be dead because of the knife 
-PRON- may have have strength enough leave to regain consciousness crawl out to hie lawnand then get back to the kitchen again 
leave no blood spot in -PRON- trail and not try to call out for help i snap 
no that s out impossible 
all right mr cook didnot see strine 
i guess that be kinda impossible 
but -PRON- do see somebody 
that mean an outsider do all this 
somebody hide on the ground kill strine and arthur fitch 
and -PRON- be probably mile away now 
but cook object 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head wince at the pain the move cause donot think so sheriff -PRON- say 
there be something familiar about the figure agree that the notion that -PRON- be strine i see be insane 
but there be still something familiar about -PRON- in -PRON- opinion 
though that s only an opinion 
schule sigh 
only one thing to be do have to take everybody in till morning 
the coroner may have some light to throw then -PRON- stop abruptly 
corey fitch -PRON- snap 
-PRON- all look around 
there be the two deputy schule packer cook and -PRON- in the room 
-PRON- be here a second ago say one of the deputy 
-PRON- be sit near the door -PRON- get out with no one see -PRON- snap schule 
that question answer -PRON- 
-PRON- have all be hang on the word first of packer and then of cook 
by move softly corey fitch could have get from chair to door unnoticed 
the question in -PRON- mind be why have -PRON- move so stealthily 
and on the heel of that question come a lightning burst of fear 
fear for harriet 
i jump to -PRON- foot and tear from the room 
the room in which harriet lay be at the end of the short hall 
i pound on the door almost yelled with relief when i hear -PRON- voice come in alarm who be -PRON- 
mejim i say want to be sure -PRON- be all right 
i hear voice then 
-PRON- fitch 
what the hell be -PRON- do out here 
the voice come from the kitchen 
i go there 
corey fitch whiteface be stare at schule and the deputy 
-PRON- be stand beside body and there be a little blood on -PRON- hand 
what be -PRON- do here 
fitch stare at schule and then at -PRON- 
with all the talk about see strine i come out to see if -PRON- be really dead 
i have a crazy notion that maybe -PRON- be just pretend a to be dead with a fake knife handle glue to -PRON- back and blood from a butcher shop or something spill on the floor to make -PRON- look convincing snort be an indictment 
yeah a swell explanation the truth 
mr cook seem so positive -PRON- see strine why do -PRON- sneak out here without say anything 
the idea be sort of crazy fitch say stubbornly think -PRON- would laugh at -PRON- if i suggest -PRON- 
so i slip out by -PRON- to make sure -PRON- be dead -PRON- get that blood on -PRON- hand take hold of the knife handle to see if -PRON- be really attach to a knife blade face get paler yet 
-PRON- be 
strine be dead all right 
-PRON- take hold of the knife handle 
schule grate 
what a swell excuse for find -PRON- print on that handle 
-PRON- didnot have time to wipe -PRON- off the handle after -PRON- kill strine so -PRON- try an alibi 
damn -PRON- fitch begin 
and then the last act of the swift drama hit -PRON- as -PRON- confront fitch in the kitchen 
oh my god come a shout from the living room 
packer 
help 
dead man dance to get through an all too narrow doorway once more that night -PRON- run from a room on each other heel 
-PRON- get to the living room 
i be first with schule close enough behind to see over -PRON- shoulder as -PRON- reach the living room doorway 
cook and packer be sway in a deadly struggle in the center of the room 
a chair be knock over nearby 
the chair packer have be sit in when -PRON- leave 
cook have -PRON- arm desperately around body 
the arm be strive to pinion arm to -PRON- side while with -PRON- right hand cook hold the wrist of the heavy man in a tense grip 
the brief possible glimpse -PRON- have of the two swaying figure 
then as -PRON- cross the threshold the two man fall 
-PRON- fall with packer on -PRON- back and cook on top arm continue to be bent at a grotesque angle behind -PRON- 
and -PRON- do not move 
cook crawl off look white and sick 
there be blood on -PRON- right hand which -PRON- draw from under body 
my god -PRON- whisper 
-PRON- turn the body over a little 
-PRON- see the handle of a paper knife stick out of back 
cook moan kill -PRON- 
the lawyer pick at loose lip with tremble finger 
-PRON- cower back from -PRON- didnot mean to do -PRON- 
-PRON- come at -PRON- with a knife 
i twist -PRON- arm behind -PRON- 
-PRON- be get the good of -PRON- when i trip -PRON- 
-PRON- fall on the knife -PRON- hold in -PRON- own hand 
-PRON- wasnot -PRON- 
schule touch -PRON- shoulder all right -PRON- say gruffly get plenty of witness that -PRON- be self defense and that -PRON- didnot have the knife in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- be self defense 
yes babbled cook 
self defense 
an accident 
-PRON- see i say nothing 
i look at bruce leave coat sleeve 
on the sleeve there be a faint smear of white 
and the white smear be tell -PRON- all i have want to know 
piece by piece the whole thing be fit into shape now 
schule glare down at ralph packer 
get no more than -PRON- deserve 
kill two people damn lucky -PRON- didnot get -PRON- too mr cook 
anyhow the case be wash up 
the murderer dead whichll save the state the cost of put -PRON- in the chair 
no i say look at the streak on sleeve 
whitewash -PRON- be 
the murderer isnot dead stand here now jittere around about self defense be -PRON- talk about panted cook apparently recover strength slowly from the battle for -PRON- life screwy snap sehule 
-PRON- all see how packer be try to stab cook 
yeah 
i say 
for how long 
for about a fifth of a second 
then cook trip packer and packer fall back on -PRON- own knife 
oblige guy packer 
cook be stare at -PRON- with astonishment and a sort of patient injury in -PRON- eye donot quite understand mr tevin -PRON- say be attack by the man as though -PRON- have suddenly go mad 
i manage to beat -PRON- off and -PRON- fall and -PRON- be kill by the very weapon -PRON- have mean to use on -PRON- 
interesting i say 
but that doesnot explain the streak of whitewash on -PRON- sleeve at -PRON- sleeve with nothing but bewilderment in -PRON- face 
then stare questioningly at -PRON- again 
-PRON- be damn well do 
-PRON- be outside this room while the rest of -PRON- be in the kitchen i charge -PRON- 
-PRON- brush against one of these freshly whitewash wall outside 
-PRON- attitude be insulting and unwarranted sir 
i may have have this streak of white on -PRON- sleeve since i first arrive here 
-PRON- may have i cut -PRON- off but -PRON- didnot 
-PRON- wasnot on there five minute ago which mean -PRON- go out within the last few minute 
be -PRON- before -PRON- kill packer or afterward 
but -PRON- dear sir -PRON- see pack few second ago -PRON- see -PRON- dance around with -PRON- 
but -PRON- didnot see packer kill i shoot out think there be something funny about the way -PRON- knee be buckle 
packer tea dead before -PRON- fall have have to kill -PRON- before -PRON- go out of the house or -PRON- would have ask question or raise an outcry 
-PRON- put on an act with a dead man cook 
cook turn to sehule 
sheriff be this man authorize to attack -PRON- in this absurd way 
no -PRON- ainot sehule growl 
-PRON- switch -PRON- eye to -PRON- 
back out of this 
shut up i tell -PRON- 
i return to cook 
there be something of value hide around this property now belong to harriet warner 
as rudolph lawyer -PRON- know of -PRON- 
-PRON- try to kill miss warner so the house would be untenante and -PRON- could steal -PRON- 
-PRON- be lucky enough to escape -PRON- first attack down in the city 
i stop the second 
-PRON- all come up here tonight 
the first thing -PRON- be greet with be an indication that old strine know the secret too though -PRON- didnot know -PRON- be in on -PRON- 
-PRON- kill strine to shut -PRON- up 
arthur fitch -PRON- discover see something to make -PRON- a little suspicious 
probably -PRON- see -PRON- either enter or leave the kitchen just before the will be read 
sheriff sehule be go to question -PRON- a second time because the first time arthur fitch have act as if -PRON- have something on -PRON- mind 
-PRON- spike that by race to the garage when -PRON- see -PRON- walk out onto the lawn and get a hammer with which -PRON- later kill -PRON- 
cook be shake -PRON- head almost pityingly 
and the pin that cause the short circuit -PRON- murmur 
that be find in the dining room 
at the time -PRON- be drop i be lie in here unconscious what -PRON- say 
actually -PRON- werenot at all 
-PRON- cause the short while -PRON- stand in the living room after the rest have run past -PRON- and out the door 
packer come out then and -PRON- put on an act for -PRON- pretend to be attack and droppedafter carefully gash -PRON- own head 
pack couldnot see -PRON- at the floor level in the dark a and didnot see -PRON- crawl to the dark dining room lock -PRON- from the inside and then attack miss warner once more after drop the fused pin as a plant be stare a little more uncertainly now and a little less angrily at -PRON- 
-PRON- make up the silly yarn about see strine in the yard to distract -PRON- attention so -PRON- could have one more chance to kill the inheritor of this house i tell the lawyer 
at the moment -PRON- seem like a good idea 
later -PRON- begin to realize that -PRON- may draw suspicion to -PRON- 
so -PRON- plan a goat 
-PRON- kill pack while -PRON- back be turn 
-PRON- run out into the night run back in again and put on the cockeyed act -PRON- catch a glimpse of as -PRON- run here in answer to -PRON- yell 
and why would i go outside the house at such a tense moment demand cook with a sneer 
because of the thing of value hide here which have be youi motive from the first i shoot back 
obviously this thing be somehow a part of the outside house wall which explain the immaculate whitewash put on carefully to cover the object 
now -PRON- seem to -PRON- -PRON- anxiety to rush thing which lead -PRON- to the terrific risk of do murder while a law officer be right in the house can only mean that this valuable thing be in danger of become visible 
maybe the whitewash be come off from over -PRON- 
i donot know 
yes that s probably -PRON- 
and -PRON- run out after kill packer to try to cover -PRON- up so -PRON- could have at least a few day more in which to get miss warner out of the way and steal -PRON- 
cook sigh should be very angry young man 
but not because fortunately -PRON- canot harass -PRON- with -PRON- insane theory 
-PRON- all see -PRON- fight for -PRON- life with a man who attack -PRON- for no reason the man who be the real murderer 
schule at least will testify to that extent 
so i think -PRON- be to be disregard mr tevin 
schule look at the lawyer and then at -PRON- 
get any way to prove what -PRON- be spout about -PRON- challenge -PRON- 
i grin a little at that be angle for the question 
the whole case i say rest on the fact that there s something around this place which miss warner have inherit that be worth a lot of money and that cook alone know of -PRON- and have kill to get -PRON- 
right 
yeah or -PRON- be crazy schule grunt 
okay 
now if -PRON- can go outside find the part of the wall where cook pick up that smear of whitewash and discover something of value there -PRON- would hang -PRON- wouldnot -PRON- an idea say schule stride for the door 
wait 
cook crack out 
schule and i turn 
-PRON- have look contemptuous before 
now -PRON- look damn mad 
-PRON- eye be hard glitter in -PRON- face 
the vein in -PRON- forehead stand out demand -PRON- right sheriff 
-PRON- may be remotely possible that thi man have chance to guess an amazing truth that there be something valuable conceal here 
but if that be so -PRON- would prove not one thing 
the hell -PRON- wouldnot say schule 
come on tevin 
-PRON- get to the door 
cook come after -PRON- 
-PRON- move fast for a man who have be hit in the head a little while before tell -PRON- sheriff schule ignore -PRON-

speck didnot come in that night and -PRON- didnot phone 
fanny call -PRON- the next morning and say that speck hadnot come in during the night

i let -PRON- use -PRON- shoulder crazy about fanny swell people 
i tell -PRON- to keep -PRON- chin upthen i get out of there 
i have to or have be blubber too 
i get in -PRON- car and head south be a nice little town with a chamber of commerce and all the trimming

the rest of -PRON- be behind the casement of the doorway down the hall 
but i see what honey have 
-PRON- be a tommygun and -PRON- be point just about where i have recently experience -PRON- funny feeling 
-PRON- find out a long time ago honey crack that federal dick run in pairslike other snake 
all right take -PRON- sailor where honey make -PRON- mistake 
when -PRON- be go to take -PRON- -PRON- ought not to let -PRON- know about -PRON- 
i learn in class baseball how all at the same time to dodge popbottle from the visit fan fight the ump with one hand and member of the visit team with the other often use that technique 
this time i dodge 
the sap that sailor pringle swing down at -PRON- would have knock -PRON- cold as a foot 
-PRON- didnot even do -PRON- shoulder any good when i jerk -PRON- head aside 
sailor be the punk who have open the door 
-PRON- use to be a thirdrate pug before -PRON- get the killer itch momentum of -PRON- blow throw sailor onto -PRON- back i let -PRON- gun slip whip -PRON- hand over the back of -PRON- neck lock -PRON- finger hunch low and heave up like a buck burro 
honey didnot use the tommygun to open up -PRON- hide for two reasonsone be in -PRON- tangle sailor pringle be as likely to become a bloody corpse as -PRON- the other be -PRON- didnot want a fouralarm bedlam in this quiet burg 
-PRON- heave do the work for sailor 
with a cry like a frightened guineahen -PRON- go over -PRON- back and slam down in front of -PRON- 
i didnot let -PRON- go to the floor 
i grab a new hold and hold -PRON- up in front of -PRON- -PRON- back to honey and the artillery 
fire when ready honey i yammer 
see if sailor can take -PRON- 
sailor couldnot 
-PRON- squirm like a worm on a hot rock bawl out for honey not to shoot 
but sailor still have some of the stuff -PRON- have in the fight ring and -PRON- begin to fight back 
and honey savoni be close incautiously because honey like himselfbut close in nevertheless 
and the ruckus bring two more of the rat from the room off the hall 
i know all of -PRON- 
not personally of course 
-PRON- mug be on file in the division 
the last two be skeet filmore a thinfaced little rat with buckteeth and fat googan a beefy one with a tic that make -PRON- mouth twitch 
all four be nick dariant trigger man 
both newcomer have rod and have a muffler on -PRON- 
i figure when -PRON- get ready to kill meand -PRON- look like that time be come on skeet would be delegate to do the job 
i be fight nasty 
-PRON- knee have find groin one fist in -PRON- face and the other in -PRON- stomach below the belt 
which doesnot mean that sailor wasnot do anything about -PRON- 
-PRON- chin have find -PRON- fist three or four lose count and i be as groggy as a gob on shore leave 
but sailor be plenty sick and i make a wild swing that catch -PRON- flush on the button and send -PRON- reel stagger away to flounder blindly into the wall and slump down 
the other be right on -PRON- then and i have to shake -PRON- head hard to keep the hallway -PRON- from jump up and down 
i be think that a girl with nice ankle have let -PRON- in for this 
let -PRON- drop this copper 
skeet fillmore wheeze through -PRON- nose 
-PRON- gun with the awkwardlooke muffler be shove against -PRON- tooth 
-PRON- have be smoke up -PRON- own profit i could smell the weed on -PRON- breath and see the ugly shine of -PRON- eye 
how i do -PRON- i donot know 
again the practice from dodge popbottle i guess 
skeet just didnot pull the trigger fast enough 
-PRON- hand slap up whack against the gun 
-PRON- cough in -PRON- face part -PRON- hair neatly in the middle and powderburne -PRON- forehead 
i have sense enough to know that an automatic with that kind of a muffler have to be cock between shot 
while -PRON- misguided mr fillmore be try to do that i hit -PRON- 
the blow crack like a cappistol and -PRON- head go way back 
skeet go over sink flat on the floor lie still be curse fervently -PRON- hit -PRON- over -PRON- ear with the muzzle of the tommygun 
i slog to -PRON- knee and couldnot get up 
honey draw back for a finishing blow but fat googan catch -PRON- arm 
everything stop in that hallway like a move picture when the film break 
somebody be pound on the door 
open up

fat whisper hoarsely -PRON- mouth jerk hard 
scram 
honey cry 
-PRON- be leave and i couldnot get up 
-PRON- elbow keep fold under -PRON- weight 
sailor pringle be go too yaw behind -PRON- in a zigzag trail 
then a hefty body hit the front door and -PRON- crack heave in a couple of big cop in toonerville uniform 
halt call one of the cop 
-PRON- have a big round face and -PRON- raise a big heavy black gun 
but sailor didnot halt and the other be already through the back door of the hall 
the cop jump over -PRON- and skeet fillmore on the floor and go rush after -PRON- 
door slam and then the big gun start off 
i hear tommy chatter wild and devilish out there 
then a car roar 
i be surprised to see the cop come back in both as good as new 
luck of the irish i guess 
-PRON- get away one say dolefully all this the other demand try to find out i mumble and manage to show -PRON- -PRON- badge 
the watchman tell -PRON- -PRON- ask the way to miss the redfaced one say 
-PRON- didnot like the look of -PRON- this time of night so -PRON- come out glad -PRON- didyou save -PRON- life 
one of the cop have a drink on -PRON- and -PRON- offer -PRON- to -PRON- 
-PRON- bring -PRON- around 
-PRON- find surgical tape in the house and patch the place where have the corner knock off -PRON- skull 
i go over and take a look at skeet fillmore 
-PRON- be dead the trouble with a longtime addict 
life hang by such a slender thread with -PRON- 
a little sock and out go -PRON- heart 
and i be genuinely sorry because a dead man canot talk 
-PRON- take body away with -PRON- and say -PRON- would phone in an alarm to go on the shortwave 
i let -PRON- go at that 
what i want what the division want be the hide of the devil behind all dariant 
honey savoni wouldnot lead -PRON- to -PRON- as long as -PRON- be chase 
in the living room of julia cottage i flop in an armchair and search around 
i start put two and two together and get a hatful of thing i didnot like

perhaps the kid brother have sing to savoni 
then speck have step into the buzzsaw just as i have 
the savoni mob have take -PRON- the girl and the boy jimmy 
where 
-PRON- have come back to sit on the cottage like a hen on a nest of egg 
and smart guy i have walk into -PRON- parlor 
i go over the house with a finetoothed comb 
no soap 
back in the living room i search around some more 
two demon be beat tin pan in -PRON- head 
then i see a book lie open face down on the mantle 
that book mean something mob would not have be read oliver twist 
either julia proctor or speck chandler have leave the volume there 
if -PRON- be speck there d be some message about -PRON- for -PRON-

this wasnot the first pole i have climb nor the first farm i have study through the glass 
there be a bunch of farm eight mile north of milstead and i hadnot pass up a bet 
this one at casual glance look like all other in the vicinity 
but a big section at the rear of -PRON- be border on all side by a thick bois darc hedge and in that section be grow a brand of cotton no cotton farmer would acknowledge 
-PRON- be grow lush thick and broadcast instead of in row 
under -PRON- glass -PRON- have long downslante ladyfinger leave 
mexican hempthe marijuana plant 
here then be nick supply of the weed 
roughly i calculate -PRON- have about half a million dollar worth of -PRON- on the stem enough to ruin the life of the population of a city 
about the time i have that think one of the glass insulator about eighteen inch from -PRON- face explode 
chip of glass cut -PRON- face a bullet scream away like a banshee and across from the big modern twostory farmhouse come the sound of a gun 
i whip -PRON- glass that way and see the figure of a man in one of the upper window 
-PRON- rifle wink again and a long raw splinter rip off the crossarm to which i be hold 
jerk -PRON- spike free wrapping arm about the pole i begin to slide down 
the bullet follow -PRON-

-PRON- be a shocking jar but no bone break 
i get up run 
the car be race along a narrow lane and would be here in second 
there be five man in -PRON- and i see a machinegun poke out the rear window 
i be in timbere pasture land duck among bush and low brush 
and right there i pull a little trick of psychology on -PRON- 
i know -PRON- would expect -PRON- to run away from danger so i run toward -PRON- 
-PRON- car be in the other direction but i have bring up a carryingcase with -PRON- ment in -PRON- and cache -PRON- not far from -PRON- lookout pole

behind a bush i shed the lineman doodad strip for speed bet the rat run the other way 
fat cry out 
i tumble into a shallow depression with some weed along -PRON- side 
i scuttle along on all four go toward the lane until i be just opposite the clump where -PRON- stuff be cache 
but there be open space between -PRON- and -PRON- 
the chance have to be take 
i sprint up and run for -PRON- put on all -PRON- steam 
honey savoni yell 
-PRON- tommy begin -PRON- insane jabber 
a heel be knock from -PRON- shoe 
i see piece of ground eat away in front of -PRON- 
that brush clump be the home plate and i slide into -PRON- like a runner in the last of the ninth with the score tie 
thorn claw at -PRON- but i hardly know -PRON- 
i grab up the carryingcase with -PRON- left hand and plunge out of the bush on the other side 
right across from -PRON- be the gang car park in the lane 
a hood be stand by -PRON- on guard with a big automatic in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- have see -PRON- come have -PRON- gun up 
-PRON- own be up too

the motor of the car be still go and mad crew be still come like a pack of hound 
i push the dead man from the running board and leap in under the wheel 
-PRON- be a big heavy car with thick nonshatterable glassalmost an armored car 
i make a tank out of that car 
i didnot go back down the lane because that way -PRON- would cut -PRON- off literally rip the tire off of -PRON- with -PRON- gun 
i whirl the machine halfway around and head straight into a wire fence 
wire snap like fiddle string and i roar across row of cotton straight for the house 
the machine cut through the plant like a scythe 
while i drive with -PRON- left hand i open the case beside -PRON- with -PRON- right and take out the submachinegun 
gun open up from the house 
spider webs appear on the windshield 
bullet beat like sharp hammer on the body 
and gun noise be drive -PRON- on from behind 
i through another wire fence hurdle a ditch and roar across a gravel lane that border the ground of the house 
then i be face a sturdy white paling fence 
the car hit -PRON- with a crash make a hole in -PRON- slap the fence to the ground for twenty foot on each side 
the ground of the house be nicely landscape with dwarf cedar and fir 
the car take these in -PRON- stride slice down a tall graceful lombardy poplar for extra measure 
i couldnot stop and get outit be rain lead and i have no umbrella 
there be a tiled sun porch on this side of the house just about level with the yard 
i drive straight at -PRON- 
-PRON- have two thick brick column but i gun the machine to the floor i think i could drive between -PRON- 
i do but i leave rear fender behind 
look out on the sun porch be a big wide cathedral window reach to the floor 
again i gun to the bottom hit the window center 
glass metal framework mortar crash around -PRON- like all hell 
there be a twofoot drop beyond the window and the car leap in like some live devil from a dream 
there -PRON- come to a halt astride a studio couch with -PRON- nose hook over a library table 
on the other side of the room be an open archway with double column on each side of -PRON- 
a man be behind the right side column with the nose of a machinegun poke be66 tween -PRON- belch fire and death at -PRON- 
the bedlam be hideous 
i flop down below the dash as the windshield be eat away and fall in stiard on -PRON- back 
i worm to the floor with the gear lever press -PRON- stomach and reach across to the handle of the righthand door 
when -PRON- swing open i go out with -PRON- drag the machinegun 
glass shatter out of the door as the gunner spot -PRON- move 
but i crouch low behind the side of the hood low enough to have the protection of the heavy metal of the motor from which bullet be gong like demon beat a triangle 
more man have come down the stair beyond the archway -PRON- rod join the hellish din 
i raise -PRON- tommy just above the engine hood get a lightning bead between those two column squeeze trigger 
the gun buck and jump in -PRON- hand 
the man with the chopper neigh out like a stricken horseonce then -PRON- and -PRON- gun disappear from the niche 
the artillery on the stair behind -PRON- back up beat a retreat turn to flee the step 
-PRON- couldnot take -PRON- 
see -PRON- man die in a bloody mess like that break -PRON- nerve 
maybe i sense donot know 
i go on because i couldnot go back 
a i hit the bottom step the last of the rat above be quit the landing 
-PRON- try to fire down on -PRON- 
-PRON- wasnot fast enough 
-PRON- spray of bullet carry away half -PRON- side and -PRON- come tumble down the stair a lump of die flesh 
i be a little sick from the carnage but i be a little crazy too 
when i reach the top of the stair i be cock for more of -PRON- 
but i come face to face with three thug who have drop -PRON- weapon and have -PRON- hand high 
-PRON- be pretty brutal 
but i couldnot take a chance on -PRON- treachery and i didnot have time to tie -PRON- up

after i have kick -PRON- weapon through the bannister to clatter down the stair i run on down the corridor

a window be open at the end of the corridor and i look out

that nerve in fat face jerk at the corner of -PRON- mouth gash of a mouth slack in surprise the other blank 
honey make a half gesture to raise -PRON- weapon when fat googan babble a curse and throw down -PRON- gun 
then honey let go of -PRON- and the other follow suit 
kick -PRON- in the fishpond 
i order 
-PRON- obey while i watch 
then i turn away 
-PRON- fang be draw there be no danger in a gangster when -PRON- gun be go 
-PRON- may lam but i know -PRON- could be pick up as soon as i phone in an alarm 
i listen now to speck shout 
dinkey dinkey -PRON- yell 
look out for nick 
nick dariant 
how i would look out for -PRON- 
how i have crave to come face to face with -PRON- 
now good luck or bad luck with -PRON- i wouldand with a gun 
but i trace the sound of voice range down from the corri dor 
i spot -PRON- behind the third door 
the door be lock 
i lunge against the door and break -PRON- open 
but no shot bomb or other form of destruction greet -PRON- 
instead i be look into a very nicely furnished room where speck chandler julia proctor and -PRON- kid brother sit rigidly in chair 
-PRON- be tape to -PRON- like so many mummy 
nick dariant be not in the room 
when free -PRON- speck sheepishly try to say something appropriate the girl be cry from reaction and hug -PRON- brother who be a manly look little chap after all 
then -PRON- be hug -PRON- and -PRON- kiss -PRON- 
i like -PRON- all right but i didnot want to go soft then 
i growl get to get nick 
-PRON- go out of the room into the corridor 
-PRON- keep together 
i didnot tell speck and the other -PRON- gun be empty 
-PRON- try door 
-PRON- be lock and i be tired of crash thing 
then a voice sound from the other end of the long hallway 
all right ruin -PRON- hideout bust -PRON- racket havenot -PRON- 
take this from nick dariant as a little token 
i whirl and see nick 
just a glimpse of -PRON- 
-PRON- matinee idol figure -PRON- greek god face eye crazy now classic feature in a twisted cast of fury 
then -PRON- raise -PRON- right arm and throw with all -PRON- mighta bomb 
i see that bomb come on and on grow big for what seem like hour 
-PRON- be all huddle together at the end of the hallway -PRON- couldnot run -PRON- be hem in by wall and lock door 
-PRON- wasnot a standard bomb but a handmanufactured one round and about the size of a baseball -PRON- make -PRON- sick inside to think what that much highexplosive could do to -PRON- 
-PRON- come on like a groundliner and i realize that -PRON- be go to hit the floor and skim along to -PRON- very foot 
i must have think i wasnot in that hall any more 
i be on the baseball diamond and maybe i could hear the fan yell what go through make -PRON- a little berserk 
that bomb be a baseball a fast groundskinner come at -PRON- redhot from the smash of a bat and i be race to meet -PRON- to pick -PRON- up catch -PRON- as -PRON- hit the floor 
i didnot know until a long time later that a bone in -PRON- hand be crack 
-PRON- hand lash up and i return -PRON- hot as -PRON- have comeputte all the steam i have on that return 
nick dariant see -PRON- come but -PRON- seem paralyzed couldnot move 
then there be an awful growl of sound in -PRON- ear the house shake and nick be blot from sight by a jagged blast of flame 
there be a hole in the wall a hole in the floor and plaster and lath rip out and fall 
and somewhere in that debris be what be leave of nick dariant 
-PRON- be funny that think right then of speck wife wait by the telephone and the two kid who have crawl over -PRON- the night before ask about -PRON- daddy 
-PRON- go phone fanny this minute -PRON- big lug 
i say roughly to speck 
then i go blind as a bat and reel over 
when i come to i be stretch out flat on a couch in one of the room and the girl be bend over -PRON- 
i could see -PRON- ankle and -PRON- be as trim as ever 
i know be right about those ankle 
i try to grin give jimmy a whipping down if i ever catch -PRON- smoking offbrand cigarette again i say 
how about a date tonight lady 
-PRON- bend closer and maybe crazy but i think there be tear in -PRON- eye and -PRON- seem like -PRON- couldnot speak for a moment 
and -PRON- kind of choke up when -PRON- speak 
what time shall i expect -PRON- 
mr davis -PRON- say 
i midfortie of new york city not far from fifth avenue stand the huge building which house the scientific crime club 
the club luxurious quarter be on the roof far remove from the turmoil of busy city street 
there be a little garden of pebble winding path between flower bed and trellis with a splash fountain in -PRON- center 
one of the room have slide wall and roof which in pleasant weather may be open to the sky 
and there be other room of luxurious leather lounge chair a little bar and restaurant with whitecoated attendant 
bridge and chess table be here a billiard room a small bowling alley a shoot gallery a small gymnasium and pool 
outwardly -PRON- be room for wealthy man at play 
but some of -PRON- be very strangely equip 
one be crowd with expensive device of modern science an electrical laboratory a room equip for research chemistry and physics 
and there be a room which would seem to be a theatrical storehousescenery prop of every imaginable kind range in an orderly litter 
-PRON- be the club equipment when -PRON- be at work 
no one visit the club for the first time would think of -PRON- as more than a playground 
but the lighting effect of -PRON- room can be make extraordinary for -PRON- have wiring as intricate as any theatrical stage 
there be ingenious secret panel in some of the wall hide trap in the floor and the roofan amazing equipment which may not be use for a year but be always available by author of the mental giant for the scientific probing of the mind of suspect criminal who may be bring here 
the club member largely be wealthy professional man 
upon a warm summer night a group of -PRON- be gather in one of the lounging room 
some club member be here by chance other have be summon as spectator and participant in a case which just today have come before the club 
the service of the member dr allaire plumb the depth of a i didnot do itl condemn by fate etc the resource of the clubhave for year be at the disposal of the police or any individual who care to demand -PRON- 
the case come at irregular interval generally from the police of new york city and -PRON- outlying district clueless affair usually with definite suspect upon whom by ordinary police method guilt would probably never be fasten 
the case tonight be typical 
the psychologist lounge in -PRON- a tale from the chair with -PRON- fellow member around -PRON- be say a pathetic affair gentleman 
the girlshe be only sixteenkille -PRON- last evening 
and perhaps almost simultaneously -PRON- father be murder 
how do -PRON- know -PRON- kill -PRON- the banker demand 
why not a double murder 
the fact be against -PRON- the psychologist say 
the thing happen in maple about this time last evening 
peter mackenzie and -PRON- daughter alice 
-PRON- live in a small but very respectable lodging house 
-PRON- be a widowera glass blower in the torrence glass work out there 
and the girl keep house for -PRON- take poison i understand the doctor interject 
why ask the very young man eagerly 
be -PRON- a pretty girl dr allaire 
-PRON- say -PRON- be the psychologist answer 
an oldfashioned sort of girl 
-PRON- father bring -PRON- here from scotland just after -PRON- be bear 
the father be a man of fifty 
-PRON- know the typeindustrious thrifty squarely solid both in physical build and in character 
a plain man of doggedly high principle 
and -PRON- bring -PRON- daughter up in just that fashion 
-PRON- say the girl be dutiful gentle sweet and -PRON- kill -PRON- the very young man sigh wish i have know -PRON- 
maybe then at nine oclock last evening the psychologist go on peter mackenzie be know to have go out and leave -PRON- daughter at home 
-PRON- be both agitatedthe landlady hear -PRON- voice but nothing that -PRON- say 
at ten oclock -PRON- go up to see alice 
the girl be mind to secure a halting confession lie on -PRON- bed unconscious from an overdose of sedative 
-PRON- never recover consciousness -PRON- die at dawn today 
and last nightat ninethirty while the girl be end -PRON- lifeless than two mile away -PRON- father be be murder 
and there be a clear connection the lawyer ask 
there be indeed 
the greyhaire distinguishedlooking psychologist sit up in -PRON- chair smooth a crumple bit of paper in -PRON- hand 
here be the note -PRON- leave pathetic simple word 
-PRON- read father darle -PRON- doesnot love -PRON- so why bother 
i hope -PRON- tell -PRON- so 
but even as much as i love -PRON- i can not live without -PRON- 
oh please forgive be a brief silence the man stare at the psychologist put the smudge tearstaine bit of paper back into -PRON- pocket 
then the lawyer say -PRON- se6m obvious that -PRON- father go to meet the man -PRON- love 
exactly the psychologist agree 
that inference be plain 
-PRON- meet 
and the unknown man kill a bridge high over the central railroad track in the outskirt of maple grove 
-PRON- have a witness to -PRON- 
the train for new york have just leave the maple grove station 
-PRON- wasnot go very fast when -PRON- reach the bridge 
the engineer plainly see two man high up there the silhouette of -PRON- 
-PRON- see the murderer shove mackenzieand see mackenzie come hurtle downstriking not the track on which the train be advance but the one adjacent 
the fall kill -PRON- 
the murderer perhaps have intend to throw -PRON- in front of the train if the engineer see the murderer what do -PRON- look like the lawyer demand 
just a bareheaded silhouette 
no detail 
the silhouette of a man peer dpwn then run away 
now gentlemen -PRON- can see easily why marberry of maple grove refer the case to -PRON- 
this man whom the little alice love more than -PRON- father or -PRON- lifeonly -PRON- and -PRON- father know -PRON- identity 
and there -PRON- have the murder motive 
this stern old scotchman meeting this man the murderer feel that -PRON- could control the girl the astronomer suggest 
or perhaps -PRON- would have murder -PRON- later the psychologist say 
-PRON- suicide save -PRON- the trouble 
the case gentleman by inference be extraordinarily simple 
but that indeed be exactly why the police be balk 
there be no tangible clue 
nothing but inferencean assumption of what happen and why -PRON- happen 
which wouldnot get very far before a jury the lawyer interject 
defense counsel would knock that sort of evidence into a cocked hat 
exactly the psychologist agree 
-PRON- have the suspectsand nothing else 
-PRON- wasnothard even in a few short hour today for marberry to locate the possible man for whom alice mackenzie could have have this attachment 
there be only two 
a young fellow name george bolton who work in an office here in new york and a rich widower of thirty an exactor name thomas dale who be fortunate in a mining speculation and now have retire from business 
both be see frequently in the girl companyold mackenzie seem to like -PRON- both 
and where be -PRON- last evening the lawyer demand 
the psychologist smile wryly 
marberry have be grill -PRON- all day 
young bolton be in -PRON- maple grove board house roomon the ground floor so that -PRON- could easily have go in and out the window without attract attention 
thomas dale be alone in -PRON- maple grove apartment with a private entrance to the street so that no one but -PRON- can say whether -PRON- be there all evening or not 
and -PRON- up to -PRON- to make the choice the very young man claim 
but how in the devil send for -PRON- the psychologist say be here any minute 
now gentlemefi there be little for -PRON- to domost of -PRON- negative 
-PRON- may hear for instance a queer grinding clicking noise 
ignore -PRON- 
pretend -PRON- do not exist 
i want the murderer perhaps to think -PRON- be imagine -PRON- the lean sensitive face be grim now as -PRON- add the guilt be in the brain of one of these two man go to drag -PRON- outwithout -PRON- know -PRON- 
a club attendant appear at the door of the room 
george bolton be here to see dr allaire 
send -PRON- in 
the psychologist stand up 
the idea be gentleman -PRON- add hurriedly tell both these suspect that a wealthy eccentric criminologist be interested in the casethat -PRON- be convince -PRON- be both innocenthas hire -PRON- scientifically to demonstrate -PRON- 
whether -PRON- believe that or not be immaterial 
neither dare refuse to come 
so -PRON- gentleman act with the assumption of sympathy 
an experiment in apply psychologyto prove innocence not guilt 
and -PRON- will enter the room and stand stare surprise confuse by the number of man all of whom be gaze at -PRON- intently 
-PRON- be a tall blond broadshouldere very handsome young fellow dress in a neat dark business suit 
drallaire -PRON- say hesitantly be dr allaire the psychologist say 
-PRON- indicate a chair 
sit down please 
thank -PRON- for come mr bolton 
the young man smile do -PRON- do 
i think get into the wrong room 
these gentleman be -PRON- fellow club member the psychologist explain need not introduce -PRON- by name 
gentleman this be mr bolton 
the police seem to think -PRON- may be guilty of the crime be describe to -PRON- 
young bolton smile nervously at the man as -PRON- sit down 
the police have be pretty tough on -PRON- all day 
what be -PRON- -PRON- want of -PRON- dr allaire 
lord know fve already tell again the attendant appear 
mr thomas dale be here dr allaire 
send -PRON- in arthur 
at the name young bolton have leap to -PRON- foot 
dale 
why -PRON- didnot tell mewhat be this some more inquisition 
no the psychologist smile 
quite the reverse 
sit down mr bolton 
the police tell -PRON- that be one of -PRON- too impetuous 
if i can prove -PRON- innocence -PRON- will be free of the police -PRON- understand 
as thing be -PRON- canot prove a thing but -PRON- will hound -PRON- try and hope but the young man wasnot listening 
with flushed face -PRON- stare at the door where now thomas dale stand calmly survey the room 
dr allaire be dr allaire 
come in mr dale 
the psychologist introduce the club member 
the second suspect be an extreme contrast to young man of thirty short but powerfully build 
-PRON- dark hair be thin at the temple 
-PRON- smoothshaven face of rugged feature be somewhat pale 
-PRON- have be an actor and -PRON- show now in the selfpossession with which -PRON- acknowledge the introduction 
and then -PRON- quiet gaze land upon bolton who be stand with clench fist 
how do -PRON- do bolton -PRON- say didnot know -PRON- have be invite here 
where do -PRON- want -PRON- to sit dr allaire 
certainly there be no love lose between the two man 
the psychologist place -PRON- in small chair side by side 
-PRON- be diagonally face the intent group of club member with the psychologist stand before -PRON- owe -PRON- both an explanation -PRON- begin quietly have be commission to try and produce some evidence that will persuade the police to let -PRON- alone 
-PRON- client be aware that there be no evidence against either of -PRON- who be -PRON- client 
bolton ask 
be -PRON- here 
no one be interested in -PRON- be not at liberty to name -PRON- the psychologist say 
perhaps -PRON- be -PRON- 
why not 
i be interestedwell to be frank if not in -PRON- two certainly in apply psychology 
-PRON- smile at the two man who now be stare at -PRON- with an almost breathless intentness 
and -PRON- be obvious that both of -PRON- consider -PRON- word as a preface to some new questioning with the same purpose the police have have all day 
one be guilty 
one innocent 
no choice could be make from -PRON- outward aspect 
wholly different type -PRON- have balk the police young bolton with an impetuous angry flush or grim sullenness and thomas dale with a seemingly quiet desire to give all the information -PRON- could and an imperturbable selfpossession 
-PRON- be not -PRON- purpose to question -PRON- the psychologist go on mana the police have tell youwas see kill peter mackenzie 
unfortunately the witness can not describe that man 
-PRON- could have be either of youor anyone of a thousand other man which be very hard on -PRON- dale say 
-PRON- be indeed 
i quite agree with -PRON- 
to come to the have invite these gentleman here as witness to an experiment in psychology wait a minute mr bolton donot interrupt -PRON- please 
-PRON- be both innocentyou have tell the police so 
and both of -PRON- know by now very well indeed that there be not a particle of evidence against either one of -PRON- -PRON- pause and then -PRON- abruptly add -PRON- donot know do -PRON- anything of what happen between mackenzie and -PRON- murderer on that bridge do not bolton say 
how could dale say 
-PRON- idea be to tell -PRON- what happen the psychologist continue 
-PRON- smile faintly 
not that i know what happen because i donot 
but what i tell -PRON- i want -PRON- to remember 
will -PRON- try donot understand dale begin 
then both -PRON- and bolton nod dubiously 
the watch man could not miss the fact that both be frightened 
but still there could be no choice a guilty man afraid of exposurebut an innocent man would also be afraid that by some mischance -PRON- would be incriminate 
yes -PRON- both say 
and dale add try -PRON- good to do whatever -PRON- suggest 
thank 
an abrupt tenseness seem to come to the room as the psychologist take a fold sheet of paper from -PRON- pocket and adjust -PRON- glass have here some note i make on what probably happen up there on the bridge 
i be go to read -PRON- to want -PRON- to listen carefully 
the theory isinto -PRON- empty mind i be go to put these fact 
-PRON- be quite simple 
i want -PRON- to engrave -PRON- there in -PRON- brain stare at the flushed young bolton and the pale thomas dale 
perhaps one of -PRON- now have a wild desire to withdraw but if so -PRON- do not dare show -PRON- 
be -PRON- ready the psychologist add quietly 
again -PRON- both nod 
very slowly with careful but drab intonation which emphasize no word the psychologist read the murderer lead -PRON- victim onto the bridge 
-PRON- talk in the moonlight about alice 
-PRON- be angry 
the murderer say never make love to -PRON- 
then -PRON- sit on the bench by the rail and the victim say 
but -PRON- be not like -PRON- child 
-PRON- can not make -PRON- believe -PRON- 
the victim be toy with a blue cap in -PRON- hand 
then a ment later the murderer push -PRON- over the rail 
-PRON- fall to the railroad track and lie crumple between the gleam rail with the moonlight bathe -PRON- 
the room be heavily silent as the psychologist pause 
and look up from -PRON- note -PRON- add clear isnot -PRON- 
i want -PRON- to memorize -PRON- not necessarily word for word but the exact sense of -PRON- read -PRON- again 
even more slowly more drably than before -PRON- repeat -PRON- 
and then at once add -PRON- jack bruce from across the room the very young man look startled 
yes sir 
just beyond that door the psychologist gesture put a small table with some article on -PRON- bring -PRON- in will -PRON- please 
carefully jack the very young man hasten to obey and come back at once from the adjoin room drag a small square table with a group of miscellaneous article spread upon -PRON- 
here -PRON- be dr allaire 
thank jack 
the psychologist draw the table before young bolton and thomas dale who stare at -PRON- silently 
without speak the psychologist touch a switch 
the roomlight fade 
shadow envelop all the intent man and from the ceiling a narrow white beam of light come down to illumine the table with the object lie there fully reveal in the white glare 
the psychologist be in the shadow 
close at the edge of the circle of white illumination young bolton and dale sit stare fascinate 
there be perhaps twenty object arrange on the table 
-PRON- be all commonplace seemingly without any relation to each other dr personal card an envelope and letterhead of the scientific crime club a man brown feel hat and glove a silverheade cane an old batter doll a blue knit little cape a few the shadow the psychologist say quietly -PRON- idea be to put into -PRON- mind a knowledge of these thing almost all of which be wholly unrelated to the crime 
that be doll young bolton say abruptly 
yes dale agree see -PRON- 
-PRON- say -PRON- have -PRON- most of -PRON- life -PRON- treasure -PRON- have no purpose of try to find out which of -PRON- -PRON- recognize the psychologist say 
that isquite -PRON- let -PRON- voice trail away and in the silence of the shadowed room now a very faint sound be audible 
a low grinding clinking sound 
-PRON- be muffledindescribably queer 
-PRON- last no more than five second 
in the darkness someone shift -PRON- foot as though startle 
dale and bolton both murmur something but the voice have only stop for those five second and now -PRON- be talk again the thing on that table have no relation to each other -PRON- move forward into the white glare and shove the table away 
forget -PRON- 
i want -PRON- only to remember what happen on the bridge between the victim and the murderer 
i read -PRON- to -PRON- twice -PRON- pocket -PRON- take two pencil and two small pad of write paper and hand -PRON- to young bolton and dale 
-PRON- can scribble in the darkness -PRON- say 
and neither can see what the other be write 
put -PRON- name at the topand then write -PRON- memory of what i read -PRON- 
well dale murmur may get -PRON- wrong bolton say 
do -PRON- good 
neither of -PRON- write hastily 
-PRON- be several minute before -PRON- have finish 
here -PRON- be bolton say 
dale hand -PRON- silently 
the psychologist take the two scrawl paper 
in the silence of the shadowed room several of the man tensely shift -PRON- in -PRON- chair 
thomas dale and young bolton be dim blobs the gloom 
at the circle of white glare beat down on the floor now where the table have be the psychologist stand in shadow a moment -PRON- silently read what the two man have write 
this be very interesting gentleman 
there be just a hint of emotion vibrate in -PRON- voice comparison of these two little essay with -PRON- original will interest -PRON- all very much indeed 
to refresh -PRON- memory read -PRON- again -PRON- exact original word which mr bolton and mr dale attempt to reproduce canot be sure dale murmur out of the darkness interrupt -PRON- now please the psychologist retort sharply 
-PRON- be hold -PRON- original paper into the light 
here be what i ask -PRON- to reproduce the murderer lead -PRON- victim onto the bridge 
-PRON- talk in the moonlight about alice 
-PRON- be angry 
the murderer say never make love to -PRON- 
-PRON- then sit on the bench by the rail and the victim say but -PRON- be not like -PRON- child 
-PRON- can not make -PRON- believe -PRON- 
the victim be toy with a blue cap in -PRON- hand 
then a moment later the murderer push -PRON- over the rail 
-PRON- fall to the railroad track and lie crumple between the gleam rail with the moonlight bathe -PRON- 
there be the original 
now here be what one of -PRON- write 
analyze -PRON- carefully gentlemen 
the murderer take -PRON- victim to the bridge 
-PRON- stand in the starlight and -PRON- talk angrily about alice 
the murderer say do not ever make love to -PRON- 
-PRON- be sit by the rail and mackenzie say 
-PRON- child be not like that 
i donot believe -PRON- 
-PRON- be toy with something blue in -PRON- hand 
then suddenly the murderer shove -PRON- over the rail 
-PRON- fall and lie crumple on the gleam railroad track bathe by the starlight 
from the darkness of the intent room as the psychologist pause come the voice 
-PRON- seem to have make several error dr allaire but i donot exactly see what let -PRON- analyze -PRON- for -PRON- 
please be quiet -PRON- twono apology be necessary for -PRON- error 
this writer say starlight instead of moonlight 
-PRON- say -PRON- be sit by the rail 
i mention that -PRON- sit on the bench by the rail 
-PRON- say mackenzie be toy with something blue in -PRON- hand 
i say -PRON- be a blue cap but -PRON- evidently forget that 
the psychologist be talk swiftly now 
so much for that one gentleman 
now read -PRON- the other 
the murderer and -PRON- victim go out onto the bridge 
-PRON- be moonlight and -PRON- talk about the girl and the murderer say but i do not ever make love to -PRON- 
-PRON- be sit on the box by the rail 
mackenzie be toy with a blue cape in -PRON- hand and the murderer say -PRON- be not -PRON- child -PRON- can not mako -PRON- believe -PRON- 
then the murderer push -PRON- through the rail andhe fall to the track with the gleam headlight bathe -PRON- 
a startled gasp have come from several of the man in the darkness 
gentlemen the psychologist add which be the guilty version 
that one 
several of -PRON- chorus -PRON- question of -PRON- the psychologist say crisply 
light marberry please 
a glare of light spring in the room 
thomas dale be sit pale intent awestruck 
young george bolton be on -PRON- foot flush tremble with a hand fling before -PRON- eye in the glare a lie -PRON- cry didnot do -PRON- 
i didnot mean to write those thing 
i donot know what possess -PRON- the guilt in -PRON- brain possess -PRON- the psychologist say ironically -PRON- man marberry 
from the doorway the bulky uniformed police sergeant spring ward grip the terrify bolton 
so -PRON- get youan i couldnot 
come onout with ityou canot lie out of this mean there isnot anything to lie out of 
-PRON- take -PRON- hand off -PRON- find out more about -PRON- this afternoon the sergeant say be make love to an heiress over in pleasant hill 
i locate herdragge -PRON- out of -PRON- a lie 
bolton stand struggle in the grip 
oh be -PRON- 
marberry say 
well -PRON- will get a chance to tell -PRON- that before the then bolton suddenly break 
all right i do -PRON- 
-PRON- let -PRON- alone i tell -PRON- 
stop torture meall of youlet -PRON- alone be engage to herher father know -PRON- and poor little alice mackenzie with -PRON- come child and -PRON- dog outraged fatherthey be the obstacle the psychologist say murder motive as old as history 
and despicable beyond most murder motive 
take -PRON- away marberry 
a when the room have quiet the psychologist say that be a very simple psychological test gentlemenand one that be almost infallible 
a true and a false memory can not be distinguish by the mind 
bolton undoubtedly know -PRON- have a dangerous problem 
whatever guilty fact i have mention -PRON- also must mention 
to have ignore guilty fact would have be a confession that -PRON- recognize -PRON- as guilty 
dale have no guilty memory at all to confuse -PRON- 
-PRON- have no problem except to try and remember what i have read 
-PRON- say starlight get -PRON- mix with moonlight 
-PRON- generally be mixed on a clear night 
-PRON- forget the blue remember something blue 
-PRON- forget the bench on which -PRON- be sit 
that be reasonable 
a bench be unusual on a bridge 
as a matter of fact there be no bench on that bridge want to make sure of refresh the guilty memory in this murderer mind and confuse those guilty memory with the memory of what i have read 
-PRON- recall that faint mysterious clanking sound a while ago which -PRON- all ignore 
-PRON- mean nothing to the innocent thomas dale 
-PRON- be -PRON- simulationin an adjoin room hereof the sound of the gear shift the railroad semaphore signal which be on the bridge 
-PRON- know the murderer must have hear those gear shift as the train approach 
-PRON- make quite a racket and -PRON- and mackenzie be sit on the gear box 
and the article on that table the psychologist continue most of -PRON- be meaningless 
to the innocent dale that little blue cape lie beside doll probably look like a doll cape 
but to the murderer -PRON- be a little garment for the come baby 
mackenzie have -PRON- in -PRON- handthey find -PRON- still clutch in -PRON- dead finger 
evidently -PRON- have bring -PRON- to appeal to this seducer 
bolton recognize -PRON- on the table 
and when i say blue own no blue capit be almost inevitable that bolton should confuse the memory and think that i say blue cape 
and -PRON- be the only one who know of the come child 
the autopsy show -PRON- but the fact be never mention 
-PRON- garble -PRON- sentence on that pointgot -PRON- word almost all correctbut out come -PRON- guilty knowledge of the child when i have say something wholly different 
and mackenzie be push through the rail not over -PRON- 
and in the deep railroad cut the moonlight do not penetrate down at -PRON- victimhad an inescapable memory of the body bathe not by moonlight but by the headlight of the advance train 
guilty memory gentleman be the murderer great danger almost impossible for -PRON- to hide themif -PRON- dig for -PRON- in scientific fashion

ken boyce feel like that 
-PRON- tell -PRON- anyone would feel like that see -PRON- stroll along this serene country highway 
-PRON- didnot belong on this highway any more than the cop belong on the veldt 
-PRON- didnot fit in with the fencedin pasture the blotch of green wood and cultivate field that roll in gentle swell for mile on either side of the road 
-PRON- didnot fit in with the speck of white that be the distant farmhouse and only sign of civilization in the countryside 
there be nothing rural about ken boyce 
the smart snapbrim the impeccable pinstriped grey flannel suit that cling trimly to -PRON- tall well knit frame suggest park avenue extravagant tip to taxi driver and expensive hotel 
the colt automatic in the holster under -PRON- left shoulder suggest business 
an insurance detective try for a long mone heel who infest the highway s across the open road there be the sound of a car come from behind 
boyce turn eagerly to meet -PRON- start to hoist -PRON- thumb after the inveterate manner of a hitchhiker 
mutter in disgust -PRON- drop -PRON- thumb and let the car go by without hail -PRON- 
-PRON- be a rattletrap model with a corpulent redface farmer sit rigidly behind the wheel 
boyce curse softly 
there wasnot any use bum a ride from that kind of a setup 
-PRON- want the big car that look expensive to operate 
the guy who drive that kind would have dough and if -PRON- would make -PRON- dough anywhere around this hick district -PRON- would just be suck enough and soft enough to pick up a stranger 
especially when the stranger didnot look like a bum 
still swear softly -PRON- stamp -PRON- foot on the macadam of the highway to get the dust off -PRON- shoe 
ken boyce pride -PRON- on -PRON- ability to dress 
-PRON- be -PRON- weakness

when -PRON- would climb out of the bus three or four mile back at some jerkwater little burg -PRON- should have turn around and go back to new york instead of hike down this placid desert highway

the racket have work once before here and -PRON- see no reason why -PRON- wouldnot work again hear the sound of another car behind -PRON-

then -PRON- hear a dim crash 
-PRON- have buy a revolver about a week before have say nothing about -PRON- because -PRON- have no license 
when -PRON- hear the noise -PRON- have seize the revolver rush out into the hall 
-PRON- hear the laboratory door open as though someone be come out someone who hear -PRON- and duck back in again know -PRON- wouldnot be dr randolph -PRON- say rush on think only of a burglar lucky dr feather comment drily not the kind of man to own a revolver more courage than wit the doctor have recklessly plunge to the laboratory doorway 
the room be dark 
at the window -PRON- would see a blob of figure crouching at the sill have impulsively fire dash forward seize the blob 
dr randolph have tumble at -PRON- foot die 
the horrified parker have stand a moment gaze at the bullet wound in -PRON- employer back 
as though -PRON- be a viper -PRON- have fling the revolver far out the window then -PRON- have flee terrify back to -PRON- room 
a murderer 
who would ever believe -PRON- be accidental 
-PRON- even have a motive for murder 
-PRON- be engage to ruth randolph 
-PRON- inheritance would make -PRON- rich now 
and parker -PRON- have sole possession of dr medical discovery which have great commercial possibility 
well dugan say when the daze dr parker finish a grand yarn 
when -PRON- say nobodyd believe -PRON- -PRON- hit the nail square 
but -PRON- happen to be true dr feather say 
-PRON- goodness -PRON- fit the fact 
-PRON- have to be true 
kit stand again in the doorway just about finished father all the data 
dr feather scan the card of -PRON- pencil notation 
thank kit 
not much argument be there 
no father 
dr eye be flash as -PRON- face lee johnson the secretary and green the gardener 
-PRON- have three suspect -PRON- say 
now -PRON- have get two 
-PRON- donot have to say anything 
-PRON- goodness not try to trap -PRON- into a confession 
i can tell -PRON- now pretty exactly what happen 
-PRON- girl kit and -PRON- have see so many murder menthis one dilate pupil -PRON- lock rigid on page on the a complete novelette of criminal espionage by author of merry christmas killer the man in the window etc i peter case be not well 
-PRON- mind be fill with the nervous confusion that be bear of an ache restlessness 
there be nothing -PRON- could do about -PRON- except wait for something to happen 
-PRON- be suspense -PRON- do not like because -PRON- have no way of tell what be go to happen 
the storm be liable to break at any minute 
-PRON- may come from any quarter 
and when -PRON- come the foreboding that be now deep within -PRON- promise -PRON- would be a deluge of the bad sort of trouble 
-PRON- pace the lanai terrace burn up one cigarette after another and look each minute or so out past the shine sand of waikiki beach at the dark water and the light of the ship that crawl along the horizon and disappear past the loom shadow of diamond head 
peter case press -PRON- have two idea concern the possible origin of the trouble to comethe submarine which have leave pearl harbor by nowand the disappearance of gladys benton wife of the skipper 
but that disappearance should not be bother -PRON- 
as the captain have say -PRON- be probably due to an impulsive notion of -PRON- own that ocean depth conceal a fiendish plot the trigger of the automatic prompt -PRON- to go to one of the other island for a vacation 
since benton be not worried there be no real reason for peter case of naval intelligence to be concern 
in the first place even if the bad have happen even if -PRON- have be abduct or murder -PRON- plight would not be bring to -PRON- official attention 
but peter case be think of one angle which would mean that -PRON- disappearance may have a lot to do with the business for which -PRON- have come to honolulu 
foreign spy in the city be as thick as fly and -PRON- be possible that the wife of a naval officer would be valuable tc -PRON- 
particularly if -PRON- happen to be the wife of the skipper in the battery room of a submarine for the spy be all here for the same reasonafter the invention the carry with -PRON- tonight the same invention peter case be commission to buy for the united state the moment -PRON- be try and approve 
-PRON- lift -PRON- binocular and look again out to sea 
isimo -PRON- snap suddenly isimo 
here -PRON- come 
case be a giant and -PRON- straight strapping figure be silhouette by the light from the room that adjoin the terrace 
-PRON- wear a white mess jacket and blue broadcloth trouser 
-PRON- be blond -PRON- high cheekboned face definitely nordic 
-PRON- look both youthful and handsome though in a hardened way for -PRON- face be like fine leather 
hurry isimo -PRON- say still peer through the glass 
the terrace door open and a small filipino garb in navy white come rush out gibber -PRON- goodness 
-PRON- come so queek sir 
case hand -PRON- the glass 
peek for -PRON- general who by -PRON- own statement command troop in the far reach of the philippine island long before the temptation of a steady salary as a mess boy in the american navy intervene in -PRON- questionably brilliant career have be allow to accompany peter case when -PRON- be take from active naval service and put in the intelligence 
isimo be to be mess boy personal valet and servant but -PRON- have serve in that capacity only a few month when -PRON- graduate from all that by blandly announce that -PRON- would be henceforth a ganteelman ganteelman 
-PRON- be look through the binocular now 
brave general isimo be glad -PRON- ee not on sad vessel eye flicker 
why -PRON- demand 
no like number no like idea 
like shore side and palm tree 
-PRON- hand back the glass and return to the room leave case not a little uncomfortaole for the boy have an uncanny ability for predict disaster in a subtle way 
case too have a feeling that all may not go right with the -PRON- look again toward the deathladen little submarine cruising serenely through the spash of moonlight 
suddenly a grim foreboding grip -PRON- 
-PRON- feel as though -PRON- want to shout to -PRON- order -PRON- back to port 
-PRON- keep watch as the shadow swallow the dim little running light and -PRON- be conscious that sweat trickle down -PRON- face 
the be on an experimental cruise 
within -PRON- bulkhead be the first complete model of a perfect sound instrument 
-PRON- be the product of an inventor who lie die in the queen hospital of spinal paralysis and if -PRON- work the united state want -PRON- badly 
but if the trial prove to be a failure -PRON- be quite possible that the would be destroy with all life aboard 
the permanent value of a sound machine have long be a subject for naval discussion 
all be agree that an effective instrument of this kind would be a lead factor in win or lose a war at sea 
in recent year various type of sound machine have be invent 
none of -PRON- have gain complete success 
the type of machine that peter case be commission to inspect and which have be instal in the have the broad sound range of any in the world 
use of this equipment make -PRON- possible for a submarine lie either on the surface or bottom of the sea to pick up the sound of every vessel cruising within a radius of a hundred mile 
use this information as a basis -PRON- would be possible to determine with fair accuracy the approximate size of the cruising vessel and -PRON- course 
in the event of war the value of a machine that could supply such information be obvious 
a submarine so equipped would be able to inform the battle fleet of the exact position and definite approach of the enemy ship would make -PRON- possible to catch such ship by surprise or would permit minelayer to place deep water mine in the path of enemy craft cause -PRON- to be blow to bit when -PRON- cross these uncharted minefield 
vaguely peter case hear the tinkle of the phone from inside but the clapping of palm frond and the strumming of guitar on waikiki beach below -PRON- carry the sound away in the warm breeze 
a moment later however general isimo appear at the door 
come queek -PRON- say missy gladys benton miss wife of captain on the phone 
case move quickly forward hour gladys benton have be wait to be leave alone for a moment and now that moment have come 
-PRON- have struggle with the rope that bind -PRON- until -PRON- be loose 
and now with the man who have be guard -PRON- out of the room for an instant -PRON- have to make use of -PRON- jerk the rope from -PRON- ache body and stand up 
for a moment the blood rush from -PRON- head and -PRON- be so weak that -PRON- think -PRON- would faint 
strand of black hair hang about -PRON- livid white face -PRON- brush -PRON- back and move toward the window 
freedom 
-PRON- would be a brief freedom and -PRON- would end in death 
this -PRON- know and yet -PRON- be unafraid 
if -PRON- have know fear before -PRON- captor have beat -PRON- out of -PRON- so that now but a single flame bright and hot burn in -PRON- soul 
the flame of vengeance 
-PRON- dress rip to the hip as -PRON- climb onto the window sill 
-PRON- stare into the night and then down at the ground below -PRON- 
in a moment -PRON- have let -PRON- fall and now -PRON- as on that ground and get to -PRON- foot 
-PRON- could feel -PRON- heart pound pound 
-PRON- must hurry 
even now the be under way with -PRON- husband bill benton in command 
poor bill 
-PRON- run stumble across the ground a fever beat white hot in -PRON- mind 
god bless -PRON- bill -PRON- keep think god bless -PRON- and damn -PRON- 
-PRON- rotten betrayal -PRON- filthy scheme and intrigue be not big enough to touch -PRON- 
-PRON- be sob now 
the night breeze whine across the cliff that be the pali and the leave of a thousand tree rustle like the laughter of god 
somewhere over the top of this mound and down through the wood there must be a house where there would be a phone 
that be all -PRON- want a phone 
-PRON- must find -PRON- before -PRON- discover -PRON- escape before -PRON- could find -PRON- and kill -PRON- 
to be catch now that -PRON- have get away from -PRON- would mean certain death 
before if -PRON- have remain -PRON- captive there may have be a chance of living 
-PRON- may have be send back to the foreign country in whose employ -PRON- have originally be when -PRON- marry bill benton to spy on -PRON- 
-PRON- be a traitor -PRON- chief agent have charge 
no -PRON- have answer evenly be a woman and in all the war of the world in all the suffering and bloodshed and shame through which man like -PRON- have try to use woman there have never yet be find a way to rob -PRON- of -PRON- soul 
i didnot promise that would be a party to blast into bit a submarine fill with live man 
nor could i possibly know when i marry -PRON- that bill benton would be the man -PRON- be and that i would fall in love with -PRON- 
-PRON- nation be not interested in -PRON- emotion the agent have snap if the invention on the thirteen explode the united state will not exercise the option to purchase -PRON- 
then -PRON- yes i know then weyouyour country could have -PRON- 
but the price -PRON- be ask the price of men life in a time of peace be too great 
-PRON- have go on like that for hour 
-PRON- want to know what -PRON- have tell benton 
-PRON- hadnot tell -PRON- anything and -PRON- wish now that -PRON- have but -PRON- have kidnap -PRON- sensing in some uncanny way that -PRON- be ready to reveal -PRON- whole rotten plot to -PRON- 
so bill benton know nothing 
the light of a house flicker yellow through the night 
suck breath into -PRON- lung -PRON- stumble toward -PRON- 
-PRON- reach -PRON- and pound on the door 
a gaunt hawaiian answer and -PRON- hysterically demand the use of the telephone 
the stupefy native point the instrument out to -PRON- 
and a few moment later -PRON- be talk to peter case 
murder on deck in the conning tower of the somehow do not like the silky smoothness of the night sea nor the moon that be so white too white 
-PRON- have be skipper of the for a long time so that -PRON- sense when something be wrong 
-PRON- feel that something be wrong now something more than the natural apprehension of the experimental dive -PRON- be come out here to make 
bill benton be a stocky man -PRON- have slope shoulder and short firm arm 
-PRON- be young and extremely sincere about everything -PRON- undertake 
-PRON- eye be black wideset and -PRON- lip thin 
-PRON- have full ruddy cheek and -PRON- skin have be bronze by the sun 
-PRON- glance now at stacy stand alongside of -PRON- 
stacy a junior lieutenant be -PRON- executive officer who have be aboard only a few month 
-PRON- look at bradshaw the tall slim quartermaster now at the steering lever 
there be someone aboard who didnot belong though bill benton do not know whether either one of these two know that or not 
this feeling about the sub be not one that have come to -PRON- suddenly -PRON- have be come for day 
during those day -PRON- have be careful to observe almost everything that take place 
at least -PRON- have try and -PRON- be begin to realize that one or more man who be either spy or be be bribe by foreign agent be in the complement of the new volunteer crew 
-PRON- lean back now -PRON- thought come slowly 
the swish of water along the ship side slither above the deep hum of the diesel engine below 
the steady breeze be rattle the driedout canvas of the signal bag 
at last benton say take over stacy go below 
yes sir 
shall i leave the deck hatch open 
may as well benton grunt admit there s not much air to be pull below but at the same time there s no chance of water spill over the deck so long as the sea remain like this 
-PRON- climb down through the con tower hatch reach the bottom in the square center operating control room 
-PRON- rub -PRON- foot on the greasy deck and glance around -PRON- 
the radioman be in -PRON- glassenclosed shack and a sailor be sit on a ditty box on one side of the room jot down some note 
other than that the room be empty and the shiny steel of the wall the cross bar of the periscope and the heavy throbthrobthrob of the diesel engine oppress -PRON- 
-PRON- head toward the door lead into the forward battery and as -PRON- walk -PRON- feel the sub sway gently from side to side and -PRON- hear the swishheavi nowagainst the hull as the boat push through the calm water 
-PRON- stop at the tiny officer wardroom which be separate from the rest of the forward battery by strip of canvas and look inside 
mari mason be sit alone at the oak table a cup of hot coffee in front of -PRON- 
hello -PRON- say -PRON- voice a little thick and the hot oilladen air catch in -PRON- throat mind if i join -PRON- 
as a matter of fact lieutenant -PRON- say be just go to request that -PRON- do 
there be much -PRON- must talk over before the dive 
-PRON- enter and sit down 
there may not be a dive -PRON- say 
-PRON- look at -PRON- incredulously 
mari mason be the daughter and only real assistant that fre mason the inventor of the new type sound machine ever have 
-PRON- hair be rich with golden yellow contrasting with the fine color of -PRON- skin the deep green of -PRON- eye 
-PRON- be slim and although -PRON- look very young -PRON- be the type of a girl who at a glance one would call competent 
what do -PRON- meanthere may not be a dive -PRON- ask black eye have a soft gleam and -PRON- thin lip part in a half grin 
perhaps i donot mean exactly that -PRON- reply ring for a mess boy but i think rather i feel certain that there be someone aboard who doesnot belong here 
and that mean trouble 
do -PRON- know this person identity believe i do 
but there may be more than one 
at least i shall arrest one man presently and then i will feel safe about the dive 
the filipino boy arrive take the order for coffee and disappear 
when -PRON- return with the steaming liquid benton and mari mason sit in silence staring at one another 
at length benton shrug donot mean to alarm -PRON- -PRON- may not be anything at all 
-PRON- lean forward -PRON- lovely face tense -PRON- green eye flicker 
do -PRON- think anyone could have hear what -PRON- say -PRON- whisper 
bill benton shake -PRON- head 
again there be silence for one come to regard the throbbing of the diesel as part of the element 
like time and space -PRON- seem to go on forever 
the sub keep rock gently rock and water swish along the hull didnot speak loud enough for anyone but -PRON- to hear 
i have think of that 
-PRON- nod but do not look as though -PRON- be convince 
-PRON- draw in -PRON- breath and cough -PRON- out 
at last -PRON- get to -PRON- foot 
be -PRON- all right if i go up on deck 
i be suppose to get the pitch and roll an hour prior to the divethough i donot suppose there be much pitch and roll now 
besides i want to get a breath of air and smoke a cigarette donot blame -PRON- 
bill benton grin and rise 
the air seem pretty putrid down here until -PRON- get use to -PRON- go up with -PRON- 
-PRON- leave the wardroom together go forward 
mari mason wear blue slack and a slipover sweater 
a green band hold -PRON- hair close to -PRON- head 
-PRON- duck through the watertight door and into the torpedo room 
bill benton follow -PRON- eye on the grimfaced sailor who sit about play an old batter phonograph 
beyond -PRON- stand the four gleam door of the torpedo tube and the sleek greasy fish -PRON- be lash to the bulkhead 
in this compartment -PRON- could see how the hull of the boat curve like a bloated cigar 
the sailor be sit on bunk on ditty box 
over the incessant pound throb beat of the diesel the music screech from the phonograph st louis woman with a diamond ring 
mari mason grasp the iron rung of the ladder and begin to climb 
some of the sailor watch other pay no attention -PRON- be too tense the mission of the boat too grim to notice much of anything right then 
as the girl climb through the manhole hatch and out onto the deck bill benton -PRON- officer cap cock back on -PRON- head climb the ladder and follow -PRON- 
-PRON- be quiet on deck a quiet away from the diesel with only the bubbling swish of the water and the soft hum of the wind as -PRON- slide past the loom hulk of the grey conning tower 
mari mason light a cigarette a nice night -PRON- say 
bill benton shiver involuntarily 
-PRON- have be about to add a nice night for murder but somehow -PRON- didnot 
-PRON- glance up at the bridge the red and green running light flicker the figure of stacy and bradshaw 
at last -PRON- gaze return to the girl who be face forward now 
as for pitch and roll -PRON- say weakly -PRON- be right 
and as for the fresh air -PRON- reply over -PRON- shoulder delicious 
the night be beautiful and for a moment neither of -PRON- speak 
the keep slide onward through the water and neither bill benton nor mari mason see the slim figure that dart across the after part of the deck to the side of the conning tower 
back to the tower the figure creep quietly around the side of -PRON- 
for a moment that be eternity -PRON- wait 
then noiselessly -PRON- unsheathe a knife and grip -PRON- in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- move forward stealthily raise the knife then -PRON- strike 
the blade slice squarely between bill shoulder blade 
jerk the weapon out the killer hurriedly race back for the engine room hatch 
-PRON- fling the knife over the side and disappear below deck 
mari mason turn to speak to the skipper 
-PRON- look quickly around and then suddenly -PRON- see -PRON- huddled form on the deck 
-PRON- scream 
death on the pali say into the phone but where be -PRON- mrs benton where can i reach -PRON- 
-PRON- doesnot matter about -PRON- -PRON- say kill -PRON- before -PRON- can possibly arrive 
and i deserve no more than that 
what -PRON- must do be get to that submarine 
-PRON- peril be far great than -PRON- own 
yes case say can stop the boat but -PRON- be come now -PRON- say thickly can hear -PRON- 
tell the police -PRON- be on the pali 
-PRON- shall perhaps find -PRON- here 
but as for -PRON- for sake see that the line suddenly go dead 
peter case be up strap an automatic about -PRON- waist putting on a leather jacket 
general isimo follow -PRON- to the door 
case turn

tell -PRON- i have order the immediate return of the to pearl harbor 
under no circumstance be -PRON- to dive 
double check say isimo but where -PRON- go 
for a social call to the pali case clip go to call on some spy 
general isimo be wideeye call police double queek 
maybe need some help in call huh 
but the intelligence ace have leave 
a few minute later -PRON- be roar up the road to the pali 
a cottage loom in the glare of -PRON- headlight 
two figure lie sprawl in front of -PRON- 
case swing in at the side of the road -PRON- brake squealing 
-PRON- leap from the car draw -PRON- but -PRON- have no need for -PRON- 
a tall hawaiian lie halfway down the porch step -PRON- head batter and bloody and -PRON- body already stiff 
on the ground near -PRON- lay gladys benton the front of -PRON- dress crimson and -PRON- black hair dishevel 
-PRON- face be very white -PRON- lip a smear of crimson 
-PRON- eye be still open and case see -PRON- blink 
-PRON- holstere -PRON- gun and bend over -PRON- 
-PRON- be not quite dead and -PRON- stare at -PRON- through glaze eye 
a chill run through -PRON- body as -PRON- look down at -PRON- 
-PRON- feel -PRON- tremble all of a sudden 
-PRON- do not know what to say speech seem so useless in these ebb moment 
-PRON- feel unaccountably embarrassed as though -PRON- should not be here watch a beautiful woman die 
-PRON- take -PRON- into -PRON- arm and -PRON- feel -PRON- blood on -PRON- hand warm and sticky 
-PRON- lip be quiver now and -PRON- lean close to catch -PRON- whisper 
bubble of blood fleck from -PRON- mouth 
the spy areshackhere -PRON- suck in breath and case feel somehow that -PRON- would be -PRON- last 
-PRON- voice become husky so the terrible machine of murder that be war grind on with neither pity nor mercy with a ruthlessness that -PRON- be choke -PRON- voice come like short sob from deep in -PRON- throat face be flush and -PRON- heart be beat very fast 
-PRON- could hear the wind on the pali and the rattle of leave have be such a fool peter case -PRON- go on at last such a selfish shortsighted little but -PRON- voice stop there and case see -PRON- eye close -PRON- be like the eye of a child who be very sleepy 
-PRON- muscle relax and when -PRON- bend down -PRON- could not feel -PRON- breath 
-PRON- take -PRON- wrist and feel -PRON- grow cold in -PRON- own warm grasp 
in a moment -PRON- be able to get to -PRON- foot 
-PRON- be too stunned to think coherently 
over and over -PRON- hear -PRON- voice and the whining of the wind and the rustle of banyan and -PRON- know that -PRON- be walk in the direction of the shack -PRON- have point out 
-PRON- know that -PRON- gun be in -PRON- hand again and that something cold ache in -PRON- chest 
-PRON- see the shack from the top of a hill 
figure move about inside 
one of -PRON- come out carry a bag 
-PRON- seem to weigh -PRON- down 
there be three man altogether 
-PRON- grip the service a little tight 
-PRON- do not know how -PRON- be go to accomplish the capture of these man but strangely enough -PRON- do not seem to matter 
a government agent isnot pay to think of -PRON- own life 
-PRON- start forward 
-PRON- have go scarcely four step when a thompson machinegun loom from an open window of the shack 
brrrrrrrrrt the first spasm of the gun case be no longer a man 
-PRON- be a cold and grim fighting machine of the naval intelligence 
-PRON- be on -PRON- stomach crawling across the ground 
the tommygun bullet scream over -PRON- head 
-PRON- be as though hell have break loose 
-PRON- lift the automatic roll back 
the gun belch with flame and the man with the machinegun drop -PRON- 
there be a bullet in -PRON- head 
case see that as the spy gunner slip down beneath the window sill out of sight 
but the machinegun have be silence less than a second when the other two spy both outside now send shot scream into the darkness where case lie 
the shadow be ally 
in the light of the house -PRON- could see the other two man quite plainly crawl roll across the ground suck breath into -PRON- great lung hold the automatic tight in -PRON- sweaty hand -PRON- move inexorably closer to -PRON- 
-PRON- open fire again 
three solid blast 
the man with the suitcase whirl about wounded 
the impact of the bullet send -PRON- to the ground whare -PRON- at once struggle to regain -PRON- foot 
the other spy look around wildly 
then there be a crashing of twig behind case and the roar of police gun 
case get to -PRON- foot and raft forward 
the spy who have not beer wound be run in a straight line back through the tree 
case stand and trigger the remain shot in -PRON- gun at -PRON- 
then -PRON- whirl in time to kick a weapon out of the hand of the man -PRON- have wound 
-PRON- jerk the spy to -PRON- foot 
dirty pup -PRON- breathe 
-PRON- be the first -PRON- have speak since get out of the car 
the police arrive five huge hawaiian 
case jerk -PRON- head in the direction the last spy have escape 
see if -PRON- can get -PRON- of the hawaiian race off through the tree 
the other two stay to handcuff the man case have wound and to drag the corpse of the machinegunner from the shack 
case be look at the suitcase undoubtedly fill with a lot of photograph and map the government will be interested in -PRON- say keep -PRON- in a safe place for -PRON- 
the detective captain nod 
will do case 
god what a mess -PRON- run into up here eye flicker a little grimly and then -PRON- see general isimo run toward the shack 
meester case 
meester case -PRON- squeal 
so happy to see -PRON- vertical slant not horizontal 
have bad news 
much work 
what be -PRON- 
the little filipino be breathe hard 
call wailupe as -PRON- say 
but -PRON- can get no rise from the radio 
-PRON- have not occur to case that -PRON- may not be able to radio the and order -PRON- return to safety 
now a new and more horrible fear grip -PRON- 
-PRON- and isimo would have to fly out to the sub at once 
come on -PRON- say thickly 
-PRON- return to the car 
case head -PRON- down the pali and toward the air island at pearl harbor minute later the motor of -PRON- boeing sputter catch on and roar 
case ease back the stick gear the trim seaplane forward 
-PRON- skim rapidly across the dark water and as -PRON- leap gracefully into the air general isimo in the navigator seat hold on with both hand 
-PRON- oily black hair wave in the wind -PRON- screech out -PRON- excitement 
suck the cool night air into -PRON- lung case hand on the stick lead the ship nose up toward the star 
-PRON- lift in a slant like a child hurry up a flight of step 
-PRON- reach the mouth of pearl harbor in no time and look over the side case see the beam of the lighthouse 
-PRON- foot work on the tail assembly steerage and -PRON- guide the craft in a heavy bank to the left 
motor pound hard then propeller whirl -PRON- open up 
-PRON- sweep over aloha tower in a minute or two and wing swiftly out over the dark sea 
since the radio be dead on the ship there be naturally no way of be sure of -PRON- exact position 
but peter case know the course -PRON- have plan to take and -PRON- now check -PRON- own gyro and set bearing to follow -PRON- 
accord to -PRON- own calculation the submarine would by now be near road off the picturesque island of maui 
near the position -PRON- have expect -PRON- to be peter case at length bring the boeing on a slant toward the water 
-PRON- lose altitude rapidly and -PRON- could hear the loose flipping of the guy wire the rattle of a piece of canvas somewhere near the undercarriage 
-PRON- adjust the goggle -PRON- have borrow and look down over the side 
the sea be black and empty 
bring the plane down to where -PRON- be no more than a hundred foot above the water -PRON- skim along at ninety mile an hour watch on every side of -PRON- and directly below for the miss submarine 
before -PRON- realize -PRON- -PRON- have completely pass the island of maui 
cold terror or perhaps -PRON- be a foreboding of terror grip -PRON- suddenly 
thick lip tight -PRON- bring the plane about drop even closer to the water and start back 
-PRON- cover the same route -PRON- have fly before in almost no time and by now -PRON- concern have greatly grow 
-PRON- be about to lift the wing of the boeing and turn about again when -PRON- spot red and green running light on the horizon of the sea ahead of -PRON- 
and as -PRON- see -PRON- -PRON- realize why the submarine have not be where -PRON- have think -PRON- would be 
-PRON- have turn about and start back toward pearl harbor 
that may mean there be more wrong on board than a temporarily silence radio 
-PRON- ease the boeing gently to the water skim rapidly over the top of -PRON- once the pontoon have bump down 
taxi up alongside -PRON- signal the bridge by mean of blinker code with a flashlight then cut the motor 
almost at once sailor appear on deck climb up through the torpedo tube and after battery hatch 
hoist the plane aboard peter case call 
-PRON- climb out across the wing and leap to the slope side of the foot plant on the hull -PRON- pull -PRON- to the deck 
general isimo leap immediately afterward 
-PRON- catch with one hand and squeal until two of the sailor help -PRON- aboard 
-PRON- shoe be soak wet 
shoe go on expense bill -PRON- chant unhappily ruin in line of duty 
attempt at escape the sailor rig a small deck crane peter case go to the torpedo room hatch and climb below 
the torpedo room be empty 
the batter phonograph be grind at the end of a record make no sound except a shrill scratching 
general isimo descend the ladder like a monkey 
case go in through the forward battery to the small wardroom 
-PRON- glance inside draw back then stare 
lieutenant bloody corpse lie on one of the low bunk 
while -PRON- look at this stacy come through the -PRON- be captain of the craft now and have climb down from the conning tower 
mari mason follow on -PRON- heel blue slack sweep across the greasy deck 
-PRON- face be very white 
peter case look around and -PRON- nordic face be set who do -PRON- -PRON- ask thickly donot know say stacy 
-PRON- be short have red hair and grey eye look as though -PRON- have just come out of the academy 
although -PRON- must have be nearly thirty -PRON- face be very boyish 
-PRON- happen on deck mari mason say be there when -PRON- happen 
bill benton have be talk of arrest some man whom -PRON- say do not belong on board 
for a moment peter case say nothing then -PRON- declare -PRON- killer probably credit benton with more knowledge concern -PRON- identity than the lieutenant really have 
general isimo shift nervously from one wet foot to the other next word be sharp 
-PRON- address the juniorlieutenant and -PRON- be go in right stacy say 
how be the radio silence 
someone slug the radioman and smash -PRON- 
nothing very subtle about this business i must say youthful face look strained 
with the killer still on board peter case say acidly -PRON- be go in to port where -PRON- would have a chance to get ashore and escape 
stacy shrug 
well i didnot know what else -PRON- should do sir 
case say sharply regulation state that when a crime occur at sea the intelligence should be notv flee at once and when that be impossible every attempt should be make to solve the crime before come to port 
as -PRON- speak case feel the intensity of the atmosphere as though high voltage wire be string taut and to the breaking point 
everywhere in the face of every man there seem to be death expression that be bleak or resign or of fear 
the man have volunteer to take a chance on the sub but none have bargain for murder and all hate -PRON- presence 
the red haired juniorlieutenant look up 
-PRON- go to remain at sea until until the murder be solve case say slowly eye burn curiously 
under the circumstance sir i should say that such a plan be dangerous 
-PRON- have that invention aboard -PRON- know 
there be spy on board case reply 
if -PRON- touch port -PRON- will have the chance of escape in which case -PRON- ring would still exist imperil the entire navy 
but -PRON- may kill more of -PRON- 
-PRON- may -PRON- be quite right 
peter eye flicker grimly 
-PRON- be all in grave danger stacy but as i have tell -PRON- there be more behind this than murder 
-PRON- must risk -PRON- life because these spy must be capture see sir stacy murmur softly 
and for a moment there be only silence punctuate by the heavy of the diesel engine 
then the sailor evidently have finish -PRON- job lash the plane aboard the phonograph in the torpedo room be go 
low toned voice sound everywhere 
the pigboat rock gently back and forth water rush along the side 
mari mason speak softly 
then there will be no dive to test the sound machine donot know case reply canot tell yet 
-PRON- have be promise that if -PRON- do go through with -PRON- the ship will be explode 
yet -PRON- may be the very method -PRON- shall have to employ to catch the killer 
stacy protest good lord man 
in that case case halt -PRON- with a motion 
during a dive -PRON- snap there be absolute silence 
every man be suppose to be at -PRON- station 
an irregular movement by any sailor will throw suspicion upon -PRON- 
after all the ship canot be blow up by someone merely wish -PRON- 
action must be apply and yes but if -PRON- should succeed 
case shrug 
-PRON- be -PRON- business to see that -PRON- donot 
lieutenant stacy be shake 
-PRON- turn and go back into the case turn to the girl 
sorry -PRON- have to be here miss mason 
-PRON- boy can fly -PRON- ashore if must be here for the trial of the invention -PRON- reply blue eye be warm admire -PRON- spirit -PRON- say softly 
at that moment the buzzer of the ship phone sound in the wardroom 
case step inside the small room pick the instrument up 
yes 
someone be try to get away with the plane a tense voice say go to try and stop -PRON- 
better get the man on deck and the voice stop and peter case turn race through the forward battery into the torpedo room and up the ladder 
sailor gape after -PRON- 
-PRON- reach the deck to find that the boeing have be secure aft 
in the dim light of the moon -PRON- could see two figure struggle 
lieutenant stacy in the conning tower be shout down at the fighter leap forward sweep around the blunt hulk of the tower but even as -PRON- do so -PRON- see one of the figure near the plane a tall slim oneslump down in a heap 
the other figure vanish into the nearby after battery hatch 
the rope secure the plane have be slash and the boeing sway precariously toward the sub side 
leap over the figure on deck case careen around the plane and leap into the manhole hatch of the after battery 
-PRON- crash with a deafening thud on the steel plate of the deck below 
a sailor whose bunk be over the galley table stir 
the ship cook in dungaree and an apron have be sit at the table read -PRON- look up 
another sailor be at the door of the a machinist mate stick in -PRON- head from the engine room 
ankle smarting case pull -PRON- to -PRON- foot stare at the group of face about -PRON- 
where do -PRON- go 
who ask the cook 
case groan 
the man who come down just a second before i do 
the sailor look at one another didnot even notice -PRON- say the cook be read 
the fellow go up and down that ladder all the time 
-PRON- go up on topside to smoke be asleep the man in the bunk add 
and i didnot see anybody say the machinist 
peter case look at the chunky unshaven sailor who stand near the door of the nordic countenance be a tight mask of disgust 
what about -PRON- -PRON- demand 
the unshaven man shrug just come in -PRON- say slowly 
-PRON- piggish eye gleam with amusement 
why look for somebody sir 
for a murderer peter case reply 
the heavy pounding of the diesel throb into -PRON- ear drum the hot air from the engine room catch in -PRON- throat and choke -PRON- 
-PRON- heart have start to beat a little faster and -PRON- feel as though -PRON- skin be burn 
the sailor appear to be dumbstruck at what -PRON- have say and no one open -PRON- mouth for a long time 
throb throbthrob pound the diesel 
peter case look the man over carefully for some moment then -PRON- say one or all of -PRON- be lie 
before very long go to find out who -PRON- be 
and when i do -PRON- go to be a long and sad story ft seem rather incredible in spite of the fact that the diesel make so much noise that a man could come down that ladder without be see or hear 
-PRON- turn to the cook who be skinny and have morbid black eye -PRON- name 
page sir the cook answer 
case look at the chunky unshaven sailor 
-PRON- nameand rate 
martin sir a torpedoman first class glance at the bunk 
the sailor there be lean medium sized 
-PRON- have a heavy jaw dark eye and short clip hair 
-PRON- name be lambert sir -PRON- say be also a torpedoman 
second class 
do -PRON- usually sleep in -PRON- dungaree lambert 
case ask 
well go on watch pretty quickly due to go on at twelve and be just get a cat nap see case grunt turn to the machinist mate who be huge 
-PRON- have black hair and -PRON- face and hand be cover with grease 
-PRON- 
-PRON- name be ryan sir 
page martin lambert and ryan peter case say aloud 
-PRON- pause look from one to the other frame lead question by which -PRON- could trap the guilty one so tightly that -PRON- would be impossible to lie out of -PRON- 
but suddenly with -PRON- thought come another idea 
-PRON- hit -PRON- all of a sudden and hit -PRON- hard 
-PRON- seem to write a key to the solution of the identity of the mystery killer 
if -PRON- work -PRON- would have the murderer redhande 
-PRON- mean also that instead of just one spy be aboard there be at least two 
case feel that at least one of these be among the four present torpedoman lambert machinist ryan cook page and torpedoman martin 
the knowledge make -PRON- tingle with excitement 
-PRON- turn and climb the ladder to the deck of the craft 
-PRON- could see part of maui on the horizon the palm tall and straight the dust of star carpet behind -PRON- 
mari mason and some of the sailor be group around the still figure that lie near the plane 
a flashlight be turn down on the face 
bradshaw someone say -PRON- be the quartermaster on watch in the conning tower when -PRON- see the figure cut the plane loose from the temporary stay 
case glance at the small iron boom to which the sailor have raise the boeing and strap -PRON- 
bradshaw be dead say someone else 
-PRON- be a cottonhaire young ensign whom peter have not see before 
secure all hatch speak up 
this be so unfortunate mr case 
so much of this happen -PRON- think -PRON- should go in postpone the trial of the invention until later sure -PRON- father have no idea this experimental cruise would be such a gruesome one sure -PRON- didnot either peter case say softly but as for go in afraid i must be contrary 
what -PRON- be go to do be dive 
dive echo the ensign get to -PRON- foot 
the sailor look up as though someone have lash a whip across -PRON- face 
case nod and then see a flash of white down the deck call isimo 
general isimo 
the little filipino come on the run 
yes sir 
general isimo ganteelman ganteelman await command sir go to put the boeing back over the side case say and -PRON- be go to take -PRON- back to pearl harbor 
-PRON- see disappointment flicker on the brown face and add hurriedly think -PRON- can fly -PRON- all right 
general isimo can fly anything -PRON- answer quickly add sir 
case -PRON- have teach isimo a lot of thing during -PRON- spare time in washington but know the pride in these accomplishment -PRON- have appeal to -PRON- vanity 
in another few minute the sailor be lower the ship over the side and into the water 
the have come to a stop 
the boeing have be raise from the water in the same way that a lifeboat on a large vessel be take up over the side 
the sailor haul the line through the pulley and then when the ship be in place strap -PRON- to the deck with stay 
now -PRON- be lower back down the sailor ease off on the line until the pontoon rest in the gently rolling water 
one man hold the plane off with a boat hook so -PRON- wouldnot scrape against the side of the submarine while general isimo scramble down the slope side of the like a brown monkey 
-PRON- foot slosh into the water 
for a moment -PRON- look as though -PRON- would plunge in and -PRON- screech 
but in the next moment -PRON- have leap catch the wing which dip with -PRON- weight and crawl across -PRON- and into the cockpit 
case wave at -PRON- 
if i donot see -PRON- again -PRON- say grin -PRON- can have -PRON- tuxedo 
without a pause isimo shout back -PRON- would be a feeting theeng for -PRON- to bury -PRON- in 
case smile as -PRON- always do at the boy sentiment about -PRON- 
in the next instant the motor of the plane roar 
isimo wave then taxi smoothly down the water gradually lift the wing into the air 
case walk forward with mari mason 
-PRON- nod toward the con tower ladder 
-PRON- climb up -PRON- into the bridge and -PRON- follow 
stacy look at -PRON- expect to be ready to dive in a few minute case tell -PRON- 
first i want mari to show -PRON- the lay out of the invention below deck 
i will signal -PRON- from the wardroom when -PRON- be ready to go under 
yes sir the reddiaired skipper snap but donot -PRON- think -PRON- inadvisable to the dive case say be a net in which hope to bag two killer 
as for -PRON- advisability take that responsibility on -PRON- own shoulder 
that would be wonderful stacy say acidly if -PRON- all be kill 
what good would didnot ask for an opinion mr stacy here to take order 
mari mason climb through the round hatchway down into the and case follow -PRON- 
color be begin to come back into -PRON- face as though -PRON- have suddenly begin to believe in -PRON- 
-PRON- show -PRON- the invention and briefly explain the main point 
while -PRON- be talk the cottonhaire young ensign walk through the compartment head aft to -PRON- station on the engine -PRON- name 
case ask 
te bronson -PRON- tell -PRON- 
-PRON- go on discuss the invention and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- plan 
-PRON- be very excited about -PRON- though -PRON- think -PRON- could detect a trace of doubt in -PRON- face 
finally -PRON- make a complete tour of the vessel from the torpedo room to the battery room think be ready case say try to smile -PRON- grip -PRON- hand 
-PRON- go into the wardroom 
-PRON- look toward the two corpse as though seal a silent oath 
the sub rock gently in the calm of the sea and the air be hot 
case could hear the faint sound of the phonograph from the torpedo room st louis woman with a diamond ring 
-PRON- look at mari 
well here go -PRON- say 
-PRON- touch -PRON- hand look up into -PRON- eye -PRON- finger tighten over -PRON- 
okay skipper -PRON- assent 
-PRON- talk into the phone to the bridge 
a moment later the word be pass that electrify the crew 
secure all hatch 
man -PRON- station for diving 
quickly and silently the sailor go to -PRON- station in various part of the ship 
mari mason leave the wardroom 
though a woman -PRON- sweater slack and the green band about -PRON- yellow hair somehow make -PRON- look quite equal to the job of look after -PRON- father interest concern the sound instrument 
peter case follow -PRON- into the where already the ten sailor assign to thisthe most vital position on board during a divewere take -PRON- place near the control 
-PRON- be hot below deck hotter in a tropic sea and most of the man in spite of mari presence be garb as -PRON- usually be during a dive dungaree trouser white skivie shirt some of -PRON- wear handkerchief about -PRON- neck to sponge the sweat that roll from -PRON- 
peter case could not help but notice the tenseness in the atmosphere the grim harden look on the white face as -PRON- prepare for thisperhap the last dive 
-PRON- seem resign fatalistically so 
yet one could not help but notice the etch line in -PRON- countenance the trace of fear in the muscle of -PRON- cheek the occasional slight quiver of lip 
lieutenant stacy crawl down through the con tower tube bolt the last hatch after -PRON- 
for a moment -PRON- stand in the middle of the deck -PRON- hat cock back show -PRON- red hair -PRON- grey eye hot 
-PRON- look at the smashed radio through the glassenclose door and at last glance not at case nor mari mason go to the periscope 
-PRON- grasp the cross bar and sit down 
almost at once the huge pounding diesel go off go silent 
-PRON- be almost as though a thundering river have instantly freeze over 
the sudden quiet be ominous portentous 
-PRON- bring reality to half numbed mind 
the battery be on now the battery which operate the ship when -PRON- be under water 
stacy lean forward and as -PRON- speak give the order to the man talk into the voice tube to bronson in the battery room -PRON- voice seem to come from deep in -PRON- throat as though something be clog there and be muffle -PRON- word 
diving plane -PRON- say 
as -PRON- speak and the man respond automatically to the command great iron plane like wing unfold from the side of the pigboat so that as -PRON- go under -PRON- be not unlike a giant fish with straight and sturdy fin that guide -PRON- course under the water 
peter case look around -PRON- 
-PRON- observe the man -PRON- sweat face -PRON- eye in which death seem to dwell 
the sub nose down -PRON- blunt little bow wallow into the wave under -PRON- and gradually the whole black and grey hull slide from sight until only the thin pipeline of the periscope remain above water cut through the surface with the slither hiss of a serpent 
at that moment when the submarine be completely encase in the limpid water a chill seem to freeze the air blow from nowhere through the compartment like the damp breath of death 
peter case shiver involuntarily and begin to sweat 
-PRON- look at the glisten steel bulkhead ooze now with bead of perspiration and steam water dripping drip down the side and roll in rivulet to the deck 
-PRON- be as though the pressure of the sea be close in about -PRON- as though the ocean would crush the side and sweep into the square compartment of the coc mari mason stand near case not move watch with wide green eye 
-PRON- face appear more calm than any of the countenance of the sailor -PRON- eye brighter and less afraid 
-PRON- would not try the invention until -PRON- be on the bottom 
ease -PRON- now stacy say slant thirty degree for the bottom and -PRON- lean forward press -PRON- eye to the rubber about the periscope eye -PRON- arm about the heavy cross bar 
on the bottom still deep the dove rock back and forth as -PRON- make -PRON- way rock like a cradle of death the water lave against the iron bulkhead a loud swishing that tell case what be outside 
the bloated cigar form of the boat sink deeper through the murk of undersea fish swam away from -PRON- around -PRON- eye goggle seaweed sweep aside 
an octopus and a shark hurry away from the path of the great iron monster 
no one speak except stacy give -PRON- order and now peter case keep watch the man and wait 
-PRON- unholstere the automatic and then grip -PRON- in -PRON- hand 
the sailor look at -PRON- look up into -PRON- face 
-PRON- eye be flicker crazily 
so the bad be expect 
-PRON- stare seem to say that and in all the cold the damp heavy air that freeze -PRON- sweat come more profusely 
bottom be reach at last the boat thud gently into the mud and at once stacy put the ship in reverse 
with the aft end high -PRON- bring -PRON- ort of -PRON- and now -PRON- voice grow gradually more quiet stacy straighten the vessel to an even keel 
not even the periscope be above the surface now 
-PRON- be completely under 
stacy lean back wipe sweat from -PRON- face 
well 
mari mason move forward -PRON- lovely face compose -PRON- green eye on stacy will put the sound machine in motion -PRON- say 
the sub keep rock on the bottom water keep ooze down the side of th glisten wall the sailor stand tensely dungaree trouser white skivie shirt wet with sweat 
wait a minute say peter case want an accounting of the man in the torpedo room 
stacy stare then -PRON- speak into the voice tube call out the name one by one 
-PRON- voice echo hollowly from the empty bulkhead 
all right case say when -PRON- be through all right mari 
set the sound machine in motion 
pick up all craft within range and prepare -PRON- report for the board of officer in pearl harbor 
this be -PRON- first real experiment on this machine make -PRON- a good one 
-PRON- grin though there be no humor on -PRON- face 
okay skipper 
stacy look up think -PRON- have be address 
but -PRON- have speak to peter case 
-PRON- move toward a panel in which the operating mechanism for the device have be instal 
case not watch -PRON- now walk to the door of the after battery 
at just that momentthe moment mari mason turn on the sound machinethe overhead light flicker grow dim 
case look about 
the sailor seem rigid hand be to -PRON- mouth and -PRON- have turn pale eye be wide 
then the light plunge out 
the ship be in total darkness 
an hysterical scream break from the lip of one of the young sailor 
oh for the love of god get -PRON- out of here be kill 
get -PRON- out 
although peter case have not expect the light to go out the fact that -PRON- do do not change -PRON- course of action 
-PRON- complicate -PRON- and make -PRON- more dangerous 
stand at the after battery door the automatic grip in -PRON- hand -PRON- snap every man remain at -PRON- station 
-PRON- too mari 
-PRON- too stacy move until -PRON- hear from -PRON- 
yet in spite of -PRON- sharp word there seem to be a minor bedlam 
the sailor be mutter there

continue from page be the shuffle of foot and all of -PRON- all of the sound be intensify by the silence of the boat 
the sub keep rock and the water on the outside of the hull brush against -PRON- 
case do not wait 
turn -PRON- grope into the after battery past the sailor on the huge electrical control panel 
give -PRON- a flashlight somebody 
-PRON- go farther and someone press a flashlight into -PRON- hand 
peter case turn -PRON- on 
-PRON- see the galley stove over in one corner the bleached white table and the bunk that be high above -PRON- directly over the table 
-PRON- see the coffee urn and the white face of the sailor in the battery 
a then -PRON- leave the room go through the door to the engine room compartment 
on both side of -PRON- be the huge silent diesel engine and peter case walk the catrunway the strip of steel that lie between -PRON- 
the beam of -PRON- light penetrate feebly through the darkness down to the end of the engine room where lie the closed watertight door lead to the battery room 
the battery room be the farth compartment aft 
engineman and machinist mate stare at peter case blond giant nordic face set tight flashlight in one hand gun in the other -PRON- sweep forward 
the submarine keep rock rock on the bottom of the sea 
now there be the deep hum of the mason sound machine which in war time would make a submarine almost a hundred percent more effective by give -PRON- the exact position of all vessel within a radius of over a hundred mile 
by this tokenif the invention be a successsubmarine craft would be promote to a far more important place in the defensive and offensive fighting fleet 
case reach the door of the battery room 
-PRON- be dog shut with wrench 
as quietly as possible -PRON- turn -PRON- loose pull the wrench from -PRON- place so that the door would open 
-PRON- have to holster the gun while -PRON- do -PRON- and -PRON- work there for several minute 
then grip the gun again and snap off the flashlight -PRON- shove the door open step inside the battery room and slam the door shut behind -PRON- 
for a moment -PRON- stand lean back against -PRON- the gun tight in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- be so dark that -PRON- could see nothing nor do -PRON- hear anything 
-PRON- be wait for some sound 
at last -PRON- come a deep voice 
who be -PRON- 
peter case do not answer and at that moment a wrench slug into the iron door just over -PRON- head 
-PRON- duck to one side crouch back against the bulkhead keep wait 
the submarine rock back and forth 
at last case flip on the flashlight send -PRON- roll across the deck 
red flash hideously and shot follow -PRON- 
the roar in the small compartment be almost earshattere 
peter case press the trigger of the automatic fire at the figure -PRON- have see shadow behind the red flare of gunfire 
wham 
wham 
-PRON- hear a groan a cursing but the cursing break off in a throaty scream 
a figure hurtle forward land on -PRON- 
peter case rise with the man still cling to -PRON- 
hand grip at -PRON- neck and case use jiu jitsu to break the grip do -PRON- easily by place -PRON- own arm between those that clutch at -PRON- throat 
-PRON- sweep -PRON- arm outward and the finger lose -PRON- grip the cling figure drop to the deck 
peter case slash -PRON- gun down the blow miss and -PRON- feel the man hold -PRON- leg 
word come from the grappler lip 
shoot -PRON- now 
shoot high 
but as the gun of the second man open up peter case have sweep aside land on the deck and be try to crawl back to where the man with the gun be crouch

a wrench lash out 
peter case feel blood trickle down the side of -PRON- head but the blow have be a glance one

the light have be turn on 
the cottonhaire ensign te bronson stand over -PRON- a weapon grip in -PRON- hand wait until i hear -PRON- say enough to know -PRON- werenot lambert -PRON- whisper and to determine -PRON- exact position so that -PRON- shot wouldnot miss this time 
-PRON- be a clever trick case try to make -PRON- think -PRON- be -PRON- partner but -PRON- be perhaps the last trick -PRON- will ever use die now case but not even go to wait for that go to put a bullet through -PRON- rotten head 
the word seem to be a soft patter that fall about -PRON- like rain drop on paper 
-PRON- be not able to hear all bronson say 
-PRON- know only that the ensign be desperate if not hysterical know that -PRON- be capable of murder and more 
-PRON- see torpedoman have be in the upper bunk of the after battery when peter have last see himlye nearby unconscious and splatter like -PRON- with bright blood 
and then though -PRON- do not know how -PRON- do -PRON- -PRON- struggle to get to -PRON- foot 
-PRON- be more the power of a strong mind than physical strength for -PRON- strength be ebb like water run from a puncture cardboard cup 
ensign te bronson see -PRON- feeble effort laugh harshly and lift case 
-PRON- shove -PRON- back up against the bulkhead 
case watch through glaze eye and -PRON- feel sweat bathe -PRON- hard face 
-PRON- see bronson the cotton hair the wild gleam in -PRON- eye 
-PRON- see the gun bronson hold 
and in face -PRON- see death 
killer mind may have tell -PRON- farewell peter case death be here with -PRON- on the bottom of the sea but -PRON- heart tell -PRON- that even in death -PRON- must triumph 
-PRON- must point out to bronson that even if -PRON- a single and unimportant cog in the great crimefighting machinery that be call the naval intelligence be kill victory have be snatch from -PRON- 
-PRON- begin talk in whisper at first -PRON- spy ring number five -PRON- say one be kill and one be capture ashore the wounded lambert there be the third 
-PRON- bronson be the fourth 
only the fifth man remain free for the present 
a poor showing for five man who be commission to see that the united state do not buy the sound machine 
bronson rock back on -PRON- heel and wipe -PRON- mouth 
-PRON- seem fascinate and case could see that the death of one of -PRON- companion ashore and the capture of another be news to -PRON- 
bronson seem to become more nervous 
-PRON- twist the gun up in -PRON- hand 
yes but success or not case -PRON- say think -PRON- will have to tell the rest of -PRON- story in hell 
because -PRON- plan to explode the case go on dramatically -PRON- want to know why -PRON- didnot work tell -PRON- case hurry on and there be a deathless smile on -PRON- painwracked face 
the explosion which be mean to wreck that one compartment could not be effect until the boat dove 
but ahead of -PRON- 
earlier -PRON- become aware that lieutenant bill benton be suspicious of -PRON- and be about to make an arrest 
so -PRON- kill -PRON- 
there be a strange light in eye 
-PRON- hand grip the gun tight 
what if i do 
that doesnot answer the question of why come to that case say and -PRON- manage to straighten up now 
-PRON- want to engineer the explosion from back here so -PRON- would not be harm 
the only victim would be the man in and near the -PRON- and lambert lead a wire from the invention into thisthe battery room 
-PRON- also have lambert lead a wire in from the electrical control so -PRON- could plunge out the light simplify -PRON- problem by work under cover of darkness

when i cross -PRON- up -PRON- may have cover -PRON- by have lambert escape through a torpedo tube or the emergency crash lock 
that would lead naval intelligence to believe that the killer of bill benton have get away leave -PRON- the remain spy aboard free of suspicion and in a position to continue negotiation for the desire plan 
-PRON- could blame the explosion on a deficiency in the invention 
yes but where -PRON- plan begin go wrong case say hoarsely because lambert be unable to release the plane quickly enough

mari mason and -PRON- continue find the line -PRON- have string to the invention and with which -PRON- intend to explode -PRON- from aft here 
as i say -PRON- could blame the invention for the explosion -PRON- and lambert would have be save with the other who remain alive without anyone know -PRON- identity get -PRON- bronson say from deep in -PRON- throat and before the sub dove -PRON- cut the line make explosion impossible 
but -PRON- didnot know -PRON- have a line to the light so -PRON- go out all right 
in that case there have be no case nod grimly 
no 
there have be no explosion 
i know that since lambert be not in the torpedo room -PRON- be here to escape the effect of the explosion 
-PRON- two be able to join this crew with faked service record and transfer paper such as spy have use in the past

these thing -PRON- see in -PRON- mind 
for the moment -PRON- do not consider -PRON- in danger because -PRON- know that the doublehull of the would probably prevent any break in the outer wall of the craft -PRON- 
the delicate mechanism in the control room would be damage but unless bronson plan to die a martyr to the cause -PRON- must have arrange -PRON- own escape 
while -PRON- cudgel -PRON- mind for this explanation -PRON- be inch forward 
bronson look up at -PRON- leer at -PRON- weakness consider -PRON- puny effort as impotent unimportant 
think trap too 
bronson grit

bronson whirl about snarl the gun in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- shriek with a shot that whirl a fraction of an inch from head 
then case be throttle the spy even as -PRON- feel bronson crumple beneath -PRON- even as -PRON- feel -PRON- finger on the ensign throat blackness and pain surge into -PRON- mind so that -PRON- do not know whether -PRON- could go through with -PRON- job whether -PRON- consciousness would remain long enough
