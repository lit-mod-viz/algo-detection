Or were darkest suspicions could it he that she, herself, changed periodically into the thing of horror and death that haunted that stricken countryside he house was full of whispers.
Mooroy, small iu the huge, easy chair, fumbled at her throat.
A sob was trying to rise there, knotting her musdes with a sort of phjracal pain.
The house was ftdl of whispers.
The ancient fannliouse that always had been her home was an abo(^ of brooding dread, a place of dark despair.
The groaning of the old timbers’ drying fibers seemed terribly loud in the oppressive silence.
They came from the very walls about Leila; from the age-darkened rafters overhead: from the ominous gloom of the entrance hallway that somehow repelled tlie livingroom Hffht; from the broad staircase A Daringly Differeni Long f^ovel of Eerie Mystery and Weird, Unholy Passiim twisting upward out of that foyer to appallingly empty obscurity above.
The house was full of whispers, shredding frayed nerves with terrible reminders of her day’s long agony.
Just such a place of muted, ominous sounds had the courtroom been.
Unshed tears, through the anguished hours, had blurred its crowded benches and the only reality had been the gaunt, suffering figure of her grey-faced father in the prisoner’s dock.
But the whispers had been inescapable.
All day they had hissed at her, as they were hissing now: mutterings of horror as witness after witness had damned Justin Monroy with husked tales of brutal, unutterably savage killing; gasps of outrage when Leila herself gave halting testimony that she had been with her father, here in this room, all the fatal hour between the time when Shean Rourke had last been seen alive and the time when Foster Corbett had found his hacked and mangled corpse beneath the poplars dividing the two farms.
Whispers had met the exhausted girl whispers of tight-lipped condemnation when at last she had stumbled down from the witness chair and the Sunday silks had rustled, self-righteously, drawing away from the defiling touch of the girl who, hostile eyes said, had lied desperately to save a blood-guilty slayer.
Whispers, whispers, whispers seething out of the pulsating silence as the stonyfaced jury marched back into their box.
And then the whispers had become a soundless scream searing breast as the dreadful verdict soughed from the foreman’s tight throat.
“Murder!
While insane Insane!
The recollection flung Leila Monroy up out of her chair, held her rigid in distress.
Insane The word hissed within her skull, hissed from the stark vacancy in which she was so utterly alone with terror and despair.
Slithering foliage, stirred by a swiftly rising wind, hissed it at her from the terrible outer night.
Insane Insane I The kindly, tender old man to whose gnarled hand she had clung as the brown clods thudded on the drab wood of her mother’s coffin; the hard-working, weatherbeaten oldster who had been father and mother to her through so many years a madman!
Her father!
From whose veins came the blood surging now so darkly in her veins.
Leila quivered.
Tremors ran through the long, delicate curves of her slim form.
The tiny oval of her small-featured countenance blanched with a new dismay.
His blood in her veins!
What if that blood were tainted with a foul lust to kill, with an stavistic urge to tear with fang and claw, to rend human flesh and taste the warm, salt-sweet tang of human life-fluid on smacking, gory lips?
What if she had not really drowsed that halt-hour whose lapse fatally had invalidated her testimony?
Had she run, instead, ravening by his side while a fearful heritage of homicidal madness blotted memory from her soul as the alienists said it had blotted recollection from Justin A the light within was paled by a blue blaze glaring in through the window on which her unseeing stare was fixed, by lightning that split the sky’s black vault with a jagged and blazing fracture.
Thunder blast became to the shocked girl the devastating roar of an enormous beast that leaped on the house, that battered it, that shook it in huge jaws whose slaver was driving rain.
Storm tumult howled about the old walls, crashed through the empty rooms, drowned out tlw whispers that had tortured Leila, drowned out the whispers in her harried brain.
Almost, after the first terrific onslau^t, she was grateful for the fury li that woid4 «o loiter let her hear those whispei5.
But it could not drown her dreadful thoughts.
“Np," she moaned.
"Merciful Lord, no!" as she had mc^ned when Justin suave attorney had elicited from the bald-pated alienist glib testimony that had saved his client from the death-chair ^and condemned him to a living hell.
“Nol It be true." ootdd have done nothing else," the lawyer lad answered her reproaches afterward.
“It was your father’s ax Foster Corbett found buried in the dead man's chest.
'Ypuf father's footprints were traced ottt of the trampled mess around the corpse surf across the meadow to your back porch.
There was the old boundary line feud between your father and his neighbor, his threats that if Foster Corbett or his oon Stanley or his farm hand, Shean Rourice, stej^ed on Monroy land they would regret it.
Against that we had only your won! that he was seated in the rown with you all evening.
And on crossexamination you admitted that you had fallen asteep.”
The wind pounded against the door as their fists had pounded, coming to accuse Dad of the awful deed.
Foster Corbett, triumphant at last over his ancient adversary.
Stan Corbett pale lips writhed.
Stanl In his arms she had known happmess, against her lips his lips had thrilled.
Defiant of the enmity between their fathers they had loved.
If State Trooper Stanley Corbett had fired his gun into her heart, he could no more cruelly have slain that love than he had by sayir^ to her father, under arrest, Mr. Monroy.”
Rain lashed against the window in a spasm of new fury.
The world was ablaze with a flickering dectric flare that spilled bluely on the tossing poplars marching along the tree-marked boundary between the two farms.
It was ju* there that Shean corpse Somethii^ moved stealthily vague and black among the wind-bent trunks Darkness smashed down again!
Who was it?
Who prowled the storm-drenched night.
The demoniac slayer who had made a ghastly horror of what once had been a man?
The tea! killer, stalking a new prey?
Stalking her?
Icy fingers clutched Leila throat, chill priddes tickled her spine.
Hi$ blood-thirst still unslaked, inflamed by bis terrible crime for which Dad unjustly had been condemned to terrible expiation, the murderer was creeping up on her.
On her An ancient legend of whispered terror trailed a slimy speculation across her fear.
A name breathed with shudders of apprehension by the gaffers clustering around the cberry-bellied stove in the village.
The Monster of West Cliff!
The traditional phantom that was reputed to haunt the stony precipice whose sheer rampart rose behind the fertile plain along which, from north to south, lay the three neighboring farms of the Corbetts, the Monroys and the Stars!
Often of late he had bear seen stalking the dark belt of primeval forest cloaking the base of th^ cliff, the elusive, appalling wraith, it was said, of an Indian chief whose tribe had been massacred by the plain's first settlers.
Stalking the ages, waiting for a chance at gruesome revaige.
Every accident, every unexplained disaster of the countryside was ascribed to him.
Was it he who arched the heavens once more, exploding into momentary existence the tempest-tormented trees, the downpour-beaten pasture between.
They were deserted, vacant as the house itself.
Nothing no one was anywhere in sight.
The prowling shadow had been an illusion, a figment of her anguished Wait!
The iitu^ned sight had recalled something to Leila.
An incident of the fateful night that she had utterly forgotten till now, till it was too late.
The girl groaned, beat her breast in bitter selfcondemnation.
Stepping to this very window, that evening, to pull down its shade, she had seen, or thought she had seen, Foster Corbett dodging behind the tool shed just visible left of the house.
She had said nothing to her father, fearing to excite him, fearing to jeopardize the reconciliation for which she and Stan plotted.
The terrible events following had obliterated the matter from her memory.
Utterly, till now.
How could she have forgotten it, its astounding implication?
The murder-axe, whose blood-smeared helve had shown no fingerprints, had come from that very shed!
Perhaps it was not yet too late.
Perhaps if she told her story Shrill sound sliced across the thought.
It stopped, spurted again.
Rrrring rrrring rrring.
It whirled Leila around to it.
Rrrring rrring rrring.
The telephone Three rings, the Monroy signal Who could be phoning her.
Stan?
Incredible!
Eve Starr, perhaps?
Eve, her neighbor and closest female friend, calling to extend sympathy, consolation.
Like Eve to remain loyal when every one else shunned her.
Rrrring rrring Leila, flinging across the room, into the hallway’s dimness, jerked the receiver from its hook.
“Hello.”
“Lock your doors,” a hoarse, unrecognizable voice grated without preamble.
“Lock your windows.”
A voice choked, coarsened by some inexplicable terror. let any one in.
Not any The telephone was suddenly dead, with the flat, inanimate deadness of a line from which the humming life of its current has gone.
Dead Had the storm blown down a frail wire or had some human hand cut it?
Some human hand, just too late to stop the husked warning?
Some human hand!
Icy terror one* more struck at Leila Monroy.
The hand of some one who even now crept up on the house.
Then she was moving, had flung herself to the great front door, was thrusting into its socket the heavy bolt clamped to its sturdy oak.
The back door was already locked, she remembered.
The windows! shutters creaked out of recesses in their embrasured sides to the frantic pull of her trembling hands, were also bolted.
She rushed in frenzied haste through dining room, through kitchen, clicking on light as she went, light from which sliadows fled that were black, sinister silhouettes waiting around comers, behind doors, to spring upon her.
The lower floor was at last a blaze of light, was a locked and barred fortress against whatever menace threatened.
The lower floor But there was the upstairs yet, the upstairs that was blacker, as dilated pupils stared up into its mystery, because of the luminescence about her.
No longer was it the warm, familiar bedroom floor of the old house but a precinct of stygian gloom haunted by some darkness-shrouded threat.
The girl’s small fingers tightened on the newel post to which she clung, tightened till the blood was driven from them and they were grey, trembling splotches against the lustrous patina of the wood.
It was only the dark, up there, of which she was afraid.
Over and over she told it to herself.
It was only because of the dark that she had that hint of evil lurking just beyond the stairhead, of monstrous evil crouched just beyond the range of her vision, haunched and waiting to pounce upon her.
There was nothing more in the corridor above, Leila assured herself, than shadows like the eerie phantoms that had fled from the lights she had turned on.
Nothing?
A shriek sliced down to her, the h%h, shrill scream of a wom^ in deadly taror.
It checked off, faded into vague thumpings as of a fierce struggle, into the thud of a storm-tossed brandr against the building wall, It came again! muscles twitched in cheeks.
Insensate, humorless laughter sounded in her fluttering throat.
It was the wind that had screamed from up there, tightening her scalp with fear.
It must have been the wind.
No one could possibly be op there.
Bui she was afraid.
Afraid to go «p there and look.
Afraid of the storm and the dark.
A sharp crackle jerked her stared wide-eyed at the entrance door.
Fool That had been only the splintering of a gale-riven brandi It came again.
Unmistakable this time.
The crunch of a heel on the gravel pathway outside A foot thudded on the porch just beyond the door and unseen fingers rattled the door knob.
Through a crashing peal of thunder the terrified girl heard a threatening, hoarse bellow.
Swneone was just the other side of the sturdy portal.
Some one The killer I The mad killer, seeking her!
He bellowed again, pounded wild fists on the wood.
The great panel shuddered under flie berserk attack.
Its hinges creaked.
The furious pounding piled a fr^izied terror on her fear of the storm and the dark.
Realization pierced her that only five feet of air, two indies of wood, sqsarated her from the monstrous creature that had made of Shean Rourke a mangled horror.
It twisted her about, sent her hurtling headlong up the stairs that a moment before dread bad barred to her, sent her dashing dirou^ the lightless corridor in instinctive flight to tlie fancied sanctuary of her own bedroom.
Her hand clutched the knob of its door, swung her to it Franctically she thrust open the panel, slammed it shut behind her, leaned back against it, gasping, quivering.
Rain lashed against the window pane, threshed on the roof above her.
Dulled by distance, the savage pounding on the door below beat about Leila as though tangible blows buffeted her.
Momentarily the lightning had ceased.
The chamber was obliterated by tar-barrd daricness.
A feeling grew on Leila dial she was not alone here.
Leila Monroy whimpered, stabbed blindly at the light-switch she knew jutted from the wall to her right.
The small room sprang into sight A dishevelled apparition stared at her from her dresser mirror, russet wedth of hair tumbling about her now pallid face, mouth twisting and livid, grey eyes dark with the frenzy of her terror.
She pulled her gaze from it, saw the bed Crumpled on its scarlet-flecked counterpane lay the contorted body of a girl. hair veiled her face, but where a pink frock had been cruelly tom away, lurid fingermarks on a white throat showed the manner of her death.
Her death there was no motion, no movement at all in the awful stillness of the pathetic figure.
The exposed, blanched breast stirred with not the slightest breath, “Eve,” Leila whimpered, unable to do no more than stare aiul whimper.
“Eve Forgotten the tumult of the storm, the battering at the entrance door.
Forgotten everything but the horror that burst within her skull.
But she had no memory of arrival.
No m^ory Time must have dropped out of her consciousness.
Time for her to have summoned the girl, to have lured her up here Time enough for her own hands to have clenched on her friend's throat, to have pressed, pressed, until life no longer throbbed beneath her throttling fingers The Phantom in the Treei to Leila Monroy that she could feel, in her icy palms, memory of the soft flesh’s slow crumple beneath their lethal construction.
Once she had hated Eve, when the girl quite openly had tried to win Stan Corbett away from her.
That jealous hatred had passed away with her own triumph and they had been friends again.
Had it passed Had it not rather sprung to sinister existence with the blood madness inherited from the father they had led away to a padded cell Darkness smashed down as the light w’ent out.
The window was momentarily a blue oblong, flickering with the electric radiance of lightning.
“Leila A voice came up to her.
“Open up.
Stan, Leila.
Stan Stan He had come for her as he had come for her father.
He had come to drag her, shrieking, to the same chamber of horrors where Justin Moore had agonized.
He would have to catch her first!
If she were mad she would avail herself of a lunatic’s cunning.
From a window at the end of the passage rain-spout clamps made an easy ladder to the ground.
Tlie storm would hide her, she would bury herself in the woods Leila got the door open behind her, flung out into the hall.
Thunderous crash of the portal below met her, and the tempest’s howl, blasting in through the house.
The sound whirled her startled glance in its direction.
The stairs were in darkness. feet thudded on the steps, coming up.
Lightning glimmer threw climbing shadow against the wall, made visible the face of a crouching figure.
It was the grizzled, distorted face of Foster Corbett Of own father I Waiting for his son with a revolver uplifted in his hand!
“Stan!”
Leila screamed.
“Look out.
A shout drowned her out, a blast of bestial fury.
Somewhere a shot blazed, and then the world crashed in on her.
She fell headloi^ into a limbo of whirling, coruscating sparks.
She felt herself lifted in powerful arms, felt herself thrown over a heaving shoulder.
Shouts, shots, echoed about her, a gibbering chatter of apelike defiance.
Rain drenched her, an icy gale pounded at her.
Oblivion claimed her.
A Leila dared to lift her lids, bit by slow bit.
She blinked.
Darkness was about her, strangely mottled with glancing fragments of silvery light.
Darkness, and glistening, dank rock above her.
The earthy smell of a tomb in her nostrils.
She was, it dawned on her, in a shallow cave.
The luminous flecks dancing about her were splotches of moonlight shifting through the leaves of high trees.
A cave Trees This must be West Cliff, then.
Leila thrust herself up to a sitting posture as terror sliced her.
Was this the cave of the Monster?
But there wasnot any Monster, she thought.
There was only the criized slayer who had hacked Shean Rourke with an ax, who had throttled Eve Starr, who had crouched with lethal gun to shoot down Stan Corbett.
Not any phantom Monster!
Not Justin toy either, nor Leila hwself.
Foster Corbett!
For a moment Leila forgot her pain, her danger, in the jubilance of that revelation.
Dad was no maniac killer, nor was she.
It was Foster Corbett who had schemed with the cunning of the insane to slay and pfece the blame for his crime on the man he hated.
Foster who had dragged a second victim to Leila bed so that the daughter should be doomed t© the same terrible fate to which he had condemned the father.
Foster Corbett who, losing all hold on r^on, had haunched in th© storm-battered corridor, waiting to kill his own son!
Had he?
Had he added filicide to the role of his crimes?
A sliot had blazed across her scream of warning just before the madman had whirled to attack her!

Helpless?
Leila lip snarled up from her tiny teeth.
She was suddenly a creature of the wilds.
The desperate courage of hopelessness entered into her, the feral cunning of wilderness’s small beasts who will fight, must fight, when escape from their persecutors has become no longer possible.
She stooped, snatched handfuls of jagged stones from the cave floor, flitted to its entrance, silent as a cloud. peered out and down, slyly cautious.
There he was I Like a huge, black spider clinging to the splattered, bare precipice.
Working his way up, indomitably, slowly by the necessity of finding handholds, footholds, in the bare, sheer rock face.
Hidden now by a pool of stygian shadow, revealed now by fragments of leaf-splintered moonlight.
Inexorably climbing to add her to the dreadful list of his victims.
Distorted by the eerie light he was somehow unhuman, somehow a monster of primitive evil, spewed out of the past.
And Leila Monroy, the weak thing he hunted, was primitive, too.
Primitive and pitiless.
Her hand flew back, arced forward.
A stone left it and struck fair on the skull of the maniac!
The crunch of its landing came up to her, sickened her, but she flung another stone and another.
A dark splotch apf>eared on his forehead, and then the man let go his holds, plunged down, a black, sprawling figure, crashed terribly in the underbrush below.
A thrill of triumph ran through Leila, a hot thrill of triumph that was a torrid flame boiling in her blood.
Her laugh, bubbled up in the dark silence of the forest.
A shrill, thin cacchination of black laughter, spilling from her gaping throat, rioting out in the rain-washed night.
It was horrifying!
Her throat clamped on it.
She checked it, icy with loathing of the savagery that had inspired it, quivering with revulsion at the thing she had become.
She had killed a man and laughed with joy at the deed.
She, Leila Monroy Qiff and forest, whirled about her in a sudden vertigo.
The hot flush of joy at thumping fall, the jubilant laughter, were these the reactions of sanity Soaring glee at killing only a lunatic could feel it, only a homicidal maniac.
“Murder!
While insane!”
What if the incredible acts she had ascribed to Foster Corbett were fetid illusions of her own darkened mind?
What if she were, indeed, the lunatic slayer and he a good neighbor trying to save her from herself, the victim of her mania?
What if her hand, that had slain him, was gory already with the blood of Eve Starr and of Stan No!
Not Stan!
That, at least, was clear to her even in her bewilderment.
If Stan were slain she could not have slain him.
There was the test.
Only a madman would kill his own son.
Corbett or she.
She or Corbett.
If Stan were alive, she was the maniac.
If he were dead If he were dead the thought slashed at her like a sword.
That she should hope for his death her Stan! upstanding, frank -eyed.
No!
Rather that she be condemned to the eternal perdition of raving madness, rather that she take a knife and slice it across her own throat.
Bullets do not always kill!
Was he lying thqre, wounded, desperately wounded, suffering?
Not dead but bleeding to death while she dallied here, delaying the aid that might save him Leila licked dry lips with a trembling tongue.
She was down on her knees on the narrow ledge that made a sort of porch to the caye.
She swung over it, was scrambling for footing against the sheer wall of the rock, was inching down that perilous descent, while weakness was Kke water in her limbs, while pain was a network of agony meshing her frail form.
“Stan 1”His name was a pra ?er on her lips as she attained the cliff’s foot at last, as she sent one shuddering glance at the still mound, blacker against black, that her missies had flung there.
“Stan She plunged into the thicket.
A root caught foot, pounded her headlong into the mire.
She lay as she fell, heaving in great breaths of the dank air to her tortured lungs, fighting for strength to rise, to go on.
The forest silence closed in on her, a black pall of soundlessness.
Not altogether soundless.
A vague, ominous slither threaded it.
It lifted head with a jerk, despite the darts of agony shooting through her at even that slight effort.
It pulled her burning stare through the tree-boles that were grotesque giants reaching writhing arms down to pluck her from her miry bed.
And then her scalp suddenly tightened.
It drifted almost silently toward her; wraithlike, phantasmal.
A vagrant beam caught it full and a scream formed in breast, tore her constricted throat, died at her lips.
The phantom of Eve Starr was gliding toward her between the ebon trees.
Eve Starr, whose corpse Leila had seen contorted in awful death on the gore-stained counterpane of her own bed A Dreamiand of Dread blood jelled with^ in her veins.
Supernal terror ■queezed her heart as the apparition's ghastly approach held her eyes with the tppalled but helpless stare of a reptileludnated bird.
And a twig snapped beneath Eve Starr’* feet!
The sharp crackle of dried wood breaking beneath the pressure of a careless foot, so little a thing to save one from blithering madness It forced reason into shuddering terror, stung her to sanity with the realization that this was not a disembodied ghost advancing toward her through the obscurity of the fear-filled wood, that it was flesh and blood, that it was “Eve!”
Leila moaned, finding strength somehow to stand up.
“Eve!”
Startled, the dusky-haired girl swung around to her, fright distorting her bloodless countenance. there?” she gasped.
“Who is it Her eyes were bumed-out coals, dark horror pitting the blanched whiteness of her visage.
“Who Leila, hon.
Leila Monroy.”
“Leila Stark terror in that gusted exclamation.
“Leila Her hand went up to her throat ^to the blue bruises that splotched its whiteness, the marks of throttling fingers.
Of whose fingers Leila Monroy knew that she must ask the terrible question, though she was terrified of what the answer might be.
“Eve,” she blurted.
“Eve!
Who did that to you?
Who?
Was it Was it Eve?”
“Leila Eve hadnot heard her. touch me.”
Or had she heard and was this the awful answer to the momentous question?
“Keep away.”
The girl whirled, dashed away.
Started to dash away.
She stumbled, went to her knees, snatched for support at the rattling withes of a low bush, swayed there in pitiful weakness.
She was feeble, so feeble.
The cold and the damp of the woods would kill her before morning if she were left here alone.
“Eve,” Leila said, not moving, not daring to move. wonot hurt you."

Doomed forever— see, these very trees seemed instinct with a baleful life.

One of them aur movii^, was coming toward her with a slow, iidmitely evil deliberatiott.
It couldnot be moving!
She was imagunng it.
How could a tree move It wasnot a tree.
It was a bent, massive %ure of a man huge, browless head set neckires on gargauiriuan shoulders naked torso gleaming eeri^ in the moonlight fes Rowing redty out of an droding countenance.
It was the of the Qiff!
But she had killed the Monster.
No, fliat was Corbett she had killed.
This Monster didnot exist.
It was a figment of Her kns^narion, this bestial thing that crept inexord»ly toward her.
It wasnot there at all and she wouldnot run from it.
If she didnot run from it it would vanish smd she would be sane again.
She must not be afraid of it.
She must not be afraid of the big-muscled arms that seemed to reach out for her, of the stubbed and fearful talons.
That closed on her arms with a sudden, fearful pain diat told her the thing was real.
That told her too late diat it was Ldla screamed, hut tfie shrill cry of lier terror and her ^ony was drowned by the ferocious, overwhelming roar of the 6ter.
Towering over her, he slammed her against the shaggy, unyielding bark of a giant tree behind her, trying to crush her, it seemed, into the very heart of the quivering timber, driving breath from her so that she could scream no longer.
She could not scream, but she could flail desperate fists against the steel-hard thews of his giant arms.
The beast laughed at her puny efforts chatteringly, gibberingly.
His black-lipped mouth opened to display yellow, rotted fangs, a cavity in which the flesh was not red but a hideous black.
Leila writhed, jerked free.
Almost jerked free.
The knee came up, thrust excruciatingly into the softness of her abdomen, pinned her helpless against the rough tree-bark behind that cut through her flimsy dress and stabbed her with countless tiny points.
Pinned her helpless, so that one of his bestial paws released its grip and flew to the neckline of her frock.
It tore downward, as the seamed, hairless countenance mowed with insensate, obscene glee.
“Pretty,” the thing chattered.
“Pretty,” and his leathery palm fumbled at breast, rasped it with a lewd caress.
“Calban likes.” girl’s hand spatted against the indurated cheek, her toes banged at the shins.
He squealed like a stuck pig and his fingers flew to her throat, clutched it, constricted. lungs pumped unavailingly, fighting for air they could not find.
The brutal digits tightened still more, till the girl thought they must cut right through the flesh, must squeeze clear through her neck.
Knives stabbed and twisted within her chest, invisible fingers gouged at her eyes.
The glaring, ferocious visage of her tormentor vanished in a great, roaring blackness.
Through which she seemed to hear a high, piercing whistle.
'The roaring in her skull was drowned in the blast of feral roar.
The whistle came again, and Leila crashed to the ground as the terrible grip on her throat, the pinning thrust of the bestial knee, were released.
Leila wallowed in her distress, while somewhere above her a tumultuous sound crashed momentarily and died away.
She pulled air into the sore agony of her lungs.
“Leila,” Stan cried, somewhere above her.
It wasnot Stan.
It couldnot be Stan.
Stan was nng dead in the old house that had suddenly become an abode of horror.
Stan had bled to death there because she had not been able to get to him in, time to save him.
“Leila, darling Hands were tugging at her, were rolling her over. hands.
His dear face was looking down at her, anxiety clouding his eyes. face “Leila!
Speak to me.
Leila!”
The girl sat up.
He was dishevelled.
His trooper’s uniform was gashed, tom by the tearing brambles of the forest, and there was a livid weal across his tanned cheek that a lashing tendril had mbde.
But he was alive.
It was Stan who had saved her, at the last possible moment, from an awful death.
“Stan!
What how did you get here?
How was knocked out, there in your house, I came to, heard the back door close.
I rushed out there and saw you vanishing into the woods. been hunting for you “Then wasnot talk now,” Stan silenced her. hurt, exhausted.
When I get you home, get you warm, you can tell me all about it.”
He was tender, solicitous.
He loved her •tiil.
Leila nestled in his arms, thrilling to his strengtfi, thrilling to tlie feel of his heart beating ^inst her own.
She would him, she wo«ld keep qniet ior a few If started to talk, if told him that it had been Eve be had seen, not her, she would have to tell him the rest.
She would have to tel! him that the girl hi his arms bad killed his father.
How could she tel! him that?
How could she?
The black trees of the forest slid by, nistling in the night.
Leila whimpered.
“Hush, darling/' Stan murmured. soon be out of this. soon be where it’s warm and light.”
Light.
Would there ever be light again in her dark soul?
Daricer than ever now.
Thought burred through aching brain.
Stan had been attacked in the house, had been Imecked unconscious.
That was evident.
Foster Corbett must have done that, Iyit% in ambush.
Ttien Leila must be san& But Eve actions bad confirmed tlie awftd speculation that it was Leila who had attacked her.
Leila, in whose mind no m^ory remained of the terrible deed.
That proved her insane.
There wasnot any answer.
There be any answer, because she didnot know tow much of her experiences was real, bow much she had forgotten, how modi she tod imagined.
The Monster, for instance. comii^ had saved her fr«n him, but Stan didnot seem to kjiow anything about him.
Had that lecherous attack been only her own madness?
Had her own mamac fingers tom the clothes from her shoulders; clamped, tightening, about her own throat?
Or had call, his ttocshing approach, frightened the brute away before the trooper could see him Over shoulder Leila saw a shadow move, high up on the bough of a tree.
It liaunched, came sprawling down; great aims spread, spatuiate talons clawing for throat I Masur oi dw Moaitn* Leila Monroy shrieked and in his arms, driving her forehead against bis chest.
This instantaneous inspiration of her terror was the only thing that could have saved her lover.
It imbalanced him, sent him reeling backward, and the downdropping monster missed his mark.
The brute crashed down into the underbrush, was m^entarily tangled in the whipping leaves, in that instant Leila slipped from hold as the trooper recovered his footing and reached for his hollered gua.
Calban bdlowed, soared the ground.
His stoggy arm lashed ahead of him with a cotoa’s lightninglike lash, gun-wrist, pounded the weapon from it Its metallic gieain sliced into the underbru^ and the antagonists came t^ether with a thud of fiesh against fie^ that was thunderous to the terrifiai girl. fists pumped, two flashing i«stons, into taut belly.
The monster’s* muscle-bulging arms damped around the trooper in a rib-cracking clinch.
They swayed, black and gigantic in the eerie fore^ light and from the taut straining agony erf that cdinch burst an appalling cacaphony of bestial sounds, of growls and vicious snarls.
A shrill, piercing squeal forced by unendurable pain frem a strong man’s Ups galvanized Leila into action.
She dre^ped to her knees, searching frantically in the meshed, baffling underbrush for gun.
The tumult of that eerie battle increased, behind her, A chattering, mindless scream signalled that Stan had got heme a telling blow.
“Run, Leila,” the man yelled.
“Get iway.
I canot hold him.”
The girl twisted, saw Calban, momentarily driven away from Stan, closing in again.
Her lover met the renewed attack by a ferocious uppercut exploding from a crouch.
His fist landed on the monster’s jaw with the blast of a rifle shot, his other fist crashed against the brute’s chest.
The devastating blows might have been Ricks of a fly’s wings for all the effect they had.
Calban was not even staggered.
His huge paw closed on neck, engulfing it with its vast span.
His swarthy other hand drove for the man’s groin.
Somehow a thick stick was in hand and she was hurling herself, shrilling primitive fury, at the monster.
Her improvised club pounded against forehead.
He roared, with anger rather than pain, and the hand that was reaching for groin flicked sidewise instead.
It struck Leila in midair, catapulted her backward, crashing her into the threshing cushion of a bush.
Jarred and half-stunned, she saw attack focus again on Stan, saw her lover swept from his feet, saw him lifted high above the grisly creature’s head by straining arms shaggy with a beast's black hair.
The terrible tableau etched itself on mind.
The gorilla-like brute; his bestial ferocity the more horrible for the fact that he was no beast but a man degraded, obscenely decadent; poised momentarily motionless as he gathered his forces for the throw that would smash Stan to a pulp.
Above his head Stan was as motionless rigid and helpless in the gigantic grip of leathery hands at armpit and crotch, his face contorted and pallid, his eyes staring in agony. an eternal moment that awful pause persisted.
And then the lurid gleam of beady, savage eyes flared more redly and the muscles in his huge arms writhed snakelike beneath their hairy skin, and Leila knew that in the next instant they would sweep downward.
From somewhere a whistle shrilled, high and piercing, through the quivering terror of the woods.
It came again, the strange high sound that once before Leila had heard through black clouds of death swirling about herself.
It froze Calban to an astounding paralysis, leashed him as though it were a chain writhing about his savage limbs.
Leila could almost see the death-thought seep unwilling from the black and terrible frame. protest was a grisly roar blasting through the black forest aisles.
The huge arms bent, slowly, reluctantly, letting Stan down.
The trooper twisted abruptly, freed himself from loosening grip.
He thudded to the ground, sprang erect, snarling But the monster was gone, had away into the veiling thickets.
For minutes the lovers heard the threshing of his huge, evil body moving away, and then a sinister silence close about them.
A silence sinister because it cloaked not only the ravening man-beast, but another mysterious entity, a lurking, invisible being who was master of the Monster, whose whistling command the brute obeyed even in the height of his frenzy.
Twice Leila had heard the weird whistle, twice it had saved her.
Not her, but Stan!
It had been at approach that the ravening human hound had been called away tliat first time, it had been Stan whose deadly peril had just now been averted.
If it were not for Stan “God!” the youth groaned.
“Who is he?
Where did he come from?”
He pulled a trembling hand across his bruised forehead above his glazed, unseen eyes, swayed with exhaustion.
“Why did he quit, just when he was about to slam me down ssd facreak kme in bo^f' struggted out o£ d»s ^ngtoig bu^ which Caibtfi h»d flung her. dorft know, Stan."

Weakened by the new loss of blood he had fainted once more.
Now he lay here, unconscious, in the black depths of the forest.
He lay bwe, and she with him, and somewhere in the glimmering, caninous shadows Calban roved and tseck pridded abru^y, with tibe sense of eyes upon her, of glaring^ hostile eyes.

Twice that had been proved.
If she cotdd lead the chase away from Stan She leaped from her lover’s recumbent form.
"Come and get me," she cried, and was hurtfing once more through the lashing, tearing brambles of the woods.
Was running headlong and blindly through the shadowed aisles, not knowing where she ran, not caring so Icaig as it was away from Stan, so long as ^e led the destroyer away from the man she loved.
The forest crashed into sudden life behind her.
Some one was following her, was flinging after her a hollow, echoing shout.
Its direat spurred her to renewed efforts.
Despairing, fraaticv g^uping, feargoaded girl catapulted through the tearing brambles, crashed into stunning treetrunks, catomed and ran on.
And then,. suddenly, was of the farest.
She was nmniag down a wet but grass-soft stope, and before lier, across the familiar pastore, was the yellow-windowed bulk of lier own hou^, Uack apiast a sky tinted by the haunting gray of false dawn.
Aknoet at once she was in l^r own back yard, was le^ng the back-porch steps, was tugging at the knob of a friendly kitchen door.
It resisted her efforts.
It would not open.
She gasped, remembering that she bad herself iodtod it from toe ktside.
Unhqjed for safety, tantalizingly offered at the last moment, was snatched away.
Leila whirled to meet the fate from which she had fled.
Silver of the setting moon sluiced an empty field.
No one, nothing, was there.
She had outdistanced her invisible pursuer, had left him behind in the forest.
Or had he fooled her as she had thought to fool him?
Had he left her fleeing blindly through the woods while he turned back to pounce upon and destroy the lover she had planned to save by her rejected sacrifice?
Something moved, there in the ribbon of darkness that was the forest-edge across the fields.
Something moved and came lumbering out into the brooding lunar luminance.
A two-headed, grotesque monster, it came slowly, inexorably out of the shadows.
Gelid fingers clutched throat.
What nightmare thing was this, what awful spawn of the dark forest?
The porch floor heaved beneath her feet, threw her back against the paintpeeled door.
It wasnot there She fell backward through it, fell against a warm, feminine figure. the matter?”
Eve Starr exclaimed.
“Where have you been?”
“Dose the door,” Leila screamed.
"Close it.”
Somehow she was on her feet again, had her hand on the wood of the portal.
She threw a single terrified glance through the opening And checked the closing panel.
Nearer and distinct now in the silvery light, she saw what it was that had come out of the woods.
Saw lolling, pallid face.
Saw that he was leaning heavily on the shoulder of another man.
Of her blood was a black flood in her veins of Foster Corbett!
Of his grizzled father who she thought lay dead at the foot of West high parapet!
She knew now who was master.
She knew now whose high, shrill whistle it was that had twice drivoi the monster from his prey ^to save Stan Into tbe Grifly Night Eve cried.
"Why is your door broken down and the place upset? scared you so?”
Leila Monroy twisted to her, fell back in astonishment.
The girl whom last she had seen with a few shreds of torn clothing fluttering from her lacerated, almost naked form was fully dressed, her hair carefully arranged, no signs of the wild night about her. saw your lights come on, after the storm and I came over to see if anything was the matter.
I found Eve cut off as stumbling feet pounded on the boards outside the door, as Foster Corbett staggered in with his grey-faced, limp burden.
“Stan!
Mr. Corbett!
In the name of all that’s holy what’s been going on here?”
"Never mind now,” the older man grunted.
“Help me.”
Leila jumped to his side.
Eve.
Together the three lifted Stan from his wavering legs, carried him in to the living room where, hours ago, Leila had cringed from the whispered lash of fancied voices and laid the youth on the couch there.
Stan groaned, his lids flickered open.
“Where where Dad His eyes lighted up.
"Leila You both here.
Both all right “Fairly all right, son,” the old man answered.
There was a black bruise on his brow, another on his check.

The girl was listening open-mouthe<^ did. not interrupt to correct misapprehension.
That was queer.
Queer as her evident ignorance of all tlmt had happased to her, or had seemed to have- ham^ened to her.
If she had lain,. dead, on the bed above, if she had run, screatmng in terror of Leila herself, ffiroi^ the woods, how couki she be so nea^ dres^d, so uadtatmibed?
The awful di^bt of her own reason closed in once more on Leita with ks nameless fear.
“Tinaeceuntably ttie brute chipped me, and and I fainted again from loss of Wood,” Stan fitirehed.

Fortw Corbett tamed to her. your end of the story?” eyes bored into her, and in their rheumy depths she saw littie light* of triumph crawl.
If she answered, she must convict herself—of ^eer, incredible madness.
Of madness!
How coidd she tell of filing Eve apparaidy dead, of the strange scene of her terror in the woods, when the girl hersdf was so calm, so tmperturbed, so evidently ignorant of it that?
How could confess to the attack on father?
Her month opened, dosed again.
She swayed, put out a gro|mig hand to the arm of a chair to keep hw-sdf fn»i falling.
And Eve

“But we’ve got to get at the bottom of this thing,” Corbett insisted. damn^ queer goii^ on!”
*‘Seem& to tm you've gat a s^y, tvt*' Eve countered “Why doo’t yeo k?”
Had the same thought occu»ed to her, too, that the man had taken charge of the aituatloa in order to up his own guilt?
"How come you were out there in die woods at this time of the morning?”
‘‘Yes* Dad»."

“But tell what I know.
When the storra feffobe I tho^ght of Leila and looked out of window to try and see she were alone over here.
The lightning struck into that line of poplaas betweoi our farms.
I saw some one among them just at the spot where we found Shean Rourke, a dark, crouching figure watching the Monroy house.
There was som«hing ksdescrihahly in his pose, and it flashed oil me diat perhaps we had been all wroig aboot beiri^ murderer, that perhaps diis was the real kfllcr, and toat new he was after Leila.
“He ^rted moving in the moment I glimpsed him, dodging low the high grass of the pasture.
I lost s^ht of hhn. ran to the phone to warn Leila.
I just had time to tell her to lode her doors and windows when the wire went dead.
I snatched up my gun, ran out to con*e to her aid.
“Her lights were going on, I saw her shadow going from window to window, pulling dw screens across them.
And tten I saw the fellow spotted before.
He had climbed to the little roof ewer the kitchen porch, was sliding into a window up there. knew that because of ray own warning- Letk wonld not open the door to me.
By the time I got her to understand, the prowler woidd catch her, would kill her.
My orfly course was to go after him the way he had entered, try to ca^ him before be did any dems^e.
"The sfl»m redoubled in violeiice and I am an- man. me hours, it seemed,, before I managed to get to tiv:‘ house, before I managed to climb tip to diat snudl, slanting roof.

I whipped around, time to see that same dark, gfrotesque form pounce on Leila and carry her I shouted, did not dare shoot for of hitting her.
“The invader hurtled along the corridor, dived a room at the very end.

“So know now.
That rowi door was jammed, and by the time I opened it the chamber was empty.
But the window was open and torough it I saw the kidnaper vanishing into the wood, Leila on his shoulder.
I saw that he must have climbed down a rainspout that passed the window, but I didnot dare follow that way.
“The head of the back stairs, however, was at this end of the corridor.
I ran down them, out through the back door ^ain, across the fields and into the forest where I had seen the fellow vanish.
“In the storm I couldnot trail him.
I shouted, fired off my gun in the hope Leila woidd respond.
In vaki.
Then the storm was over, as suddenly as it had begun.
The clouds started to break.
Moonlight, sifting through, showed me trampled bushes, shreds of a girl’s clothing caught on briars.
I followed that trail, reached the face of West Cliff.
Just above where the spoor ended I saw the mouth of a cave, thought I sensed movement within it.
Possibly, I thought, my shots had scared the kidnaper away and Leila was alone up there.
I started to climb up to it.
Suddenly rocks started to fly down at me.
One struck me on the head.
I felt myself falling, struck and lost consciousness.”
Leila thought, his story fitted.
Was it the truth or a tissue of lies?
Somehow it explained everything too patly, everything except who the Monster was and where he had come from, except the mystery of Eve weird part in the dreadful night. face was an expressionless mask, her unfathomable eyes fixed on seamed, horribly tired countenance.
“When I came to I heard the sounds of struggle, far-off.
A pile of dead leaves had cushioned my fall, I wasnot badly hurt.
I staggered to my feet, ploughed tlirough the woods, and found Stan, knocked out.”
Or had he come on that scene just a little earlier, in time to whistle off Calban, in time to send the Monster ravening after her through the woods.
Was he playing still for a chance to get her alone, to finish her?
The speculation wrenched a groan from the bemused girl.
“Leila Eve exclaimed. white.
You look as though you were going to faint, ni get you some water.”
She was out of the room as her sentence ended.
The kitchen door swung closed behind her.
“Leila,” Foster Corbett spun to her.
“What do you know of actions tonight?
Have you seen her?”
A scream sliced across her amazing question, a scream from behind the kitdien door.
Corbett slewed around.
Gun in hand, he hurled himself across the room, pounded that door open.
The brick-walled room beyond was starkly, gruesomely vacant, but the back door was just slamming shut and from beyond it a thin, high wail of infinite terror told where Eve had vanished. got her, now,” the old man yelled. was wrong.
Come on, Stan!”
And then he, too, was gone into the grisly night.
Monster at Play came up out of her chair, fighting the intangible but cloying threads of her weakness, fighting a giddy nausea that whirled within her skull and tweaked at the pit of her stomach.
Through that dizzy whirlpool she saw vague form dart past her, lurched to follow it.
The room seemed to whirl about her as she moved, there was a wall where the door should be, a wall into which she jolted. she pawed at the partition, found the door away from which she had reeled in her vertigo, reeled through.
The kitchen, a place of black, threatening shadows, danced about her.
She staggered across it, stabbed at the outer door, missed it, pulled in an agonizing breath and tried again.
This time Leila contrived to grab the doorknob as it went by and steadied herself by it.
Gripping the jamb with her other hand, she fought to get the porta! open, succeeded.
Something lay, a black, unmoving bulk, on the porch outside.
Stan!
It must be Stan, her bemidered at her and she went to her knees beside it.

He surged to his fed, bringing her with him as though she had no weight at all.
He lid'ched beck into the house with her. the kitchen, the Uric^ room, he ploughed, chudding lewd glee.
Into the foyer he sliouldered., the piggish little eyes under his beetling brows lurid with an obscene light, his calloused, rasping fingers writhing as though with sane, vile life of thek own on her shrinking, quivering flesh. larynx swells! once more with, a shriric, but Celban caught her intention by some unhuman second-sight ami gagged her— her with the pressure of his slobbering, lips on hers in a kiss of ulrimate horror.
Crushed .thus in the visehke cradle of the arms, ga^ed thus by his insuflfierable caress, Leila knew that he was carrying her up the broad stairs to the passage above.
To the passage where her own room was, her onmt bed No doubt now, no doubt at of what the brute-man intended.
No doubt of what he intended or of what had happened.
He l^d been waiting outside, had grabbed Eve and— killed her, probably.
Foster Corbett had taken advantage of the girl’s one cry to get out of the way hunself, to get Stan out of the way and had sent back his creature to finish off Leila. unlocked for presoice time and tsne again had interfered with his macaber jdans, but was out of the ymy now »id Lrila was in power, being carried up to the room where the mght's horror had begun and now would' be consummated.
Calban was the- room, thrusting the doew sl^ with a foot as he passed thrm^ twisting to the bed with a swift surety that told of curious familiarity with its loc^ion.
Even in that terrible moment Leila noted that, noted that her white was rumpded and bloodflecked, that the indenmtion of a contorted figure w^ stifi visible on it Then Calban had flm^ her shmnii^y down on the bed, had pihned her to it with a digging, cruel knee as he tore avidly at what was left of her clothing.
“Pre^,” he jabbered, as he had jabbered before in the forest.
“Pretty.
Catban likes.”
He pai^d to ^oat over the quivering beauty his violating paws had revealed.
“Calban likes very much.” tortured eyes fled from the evil antietp^m of his drooling mouth, slid past the musdes of his terrible arms.
Her hopeless gare ^id akmg the walls of h^ room that now was a ceil of n»dness and despair, reached the door.
It was evening!
Slowly, silently, it was oponing and white fingers jo^ed its edge.
The girl’s heart leaped.
“Please,” she whimpered pulling her gaze back to her tormentor.
“Please, Calban, let me go.”
At all costs she must distract his attentiwi, keep him from notiedng the advent of her rescuer. pay you. give you lots of money, jewels.
The Monster gibbered his mindless laugh.
“Calban no want money, jewels.
Calban want pretty wanan, white, soft flesh of pretty woman.
Ijke this And suddenly he leaped away from her, leaped to the center of the room and whirled to the opening door.
Some sixth sense had warned him of danger. jumped into the room, a long carving knife in his hand that must have come from the kitchen below.
"Leila!” he yelled.
"Run, jump out of the indow.
I can hold him long enough Calban roared, plunged at him.
Stan met the attack with a darting slash of the knife, caught the Monster across the knuckles.
The other fist crashed against the trooper’s shoulder, him against the wall.
Leila screamed, started up from the bed.
Calban twisted to her.
A flick of his long arm pounded her back to the creaking mattress.
Stan rebounded from the wall, sliced at Calban.
The giant sprang backward, avoiding the rush, dropped to the floor and rolled toward the trooper.
Leila was out of the bed, was darting once more toward the window.
Black digits closed on ankles, heaved upward.
The trooper was flung high into the air.
He twisted Hthely, came down on his feet, crouched to. meet his snarling adversary’s lunge. juggernaut rush swerved at the last instant and the girl felt the impact of his fists once more, blasting her headlong away from attempted escape.
She sprawled, brought up thumping against the wall.
Stan ducked forward, slashed a long cut across the other’s leathery cheek.
Calban squealed, more in rage than pain, and exploded into a swift blur of action which eyes could not follow nor Stan avoid.
Suddenly that whirling battle was static, terribly static, Stan hung from the giant’s tight clutch on his wrists, hung from arms stretched horizontally out from his shoulders in that terrific grip.
Crucified on an invisible cross, the trooper’s body was a taut arc of suffering, his face a fish-belly white, sweat-wet mask of hideous torture.
A low moan squealed from his rigid throat, squealed into sound.
"Get out Leila ^your chance gurgled into a nondescript gust of agony as gargantuan span of whipcord muscle widened to crack the bone-jointures in his shoulders with the gruesome power of its living torture-rack. way to the door was clear as long as Calban held the straddle-legged pose he must to continue his grisly torment of her lover.
This was her chance to escape.
She shoved away from the to which that last fierce buffet had flung her, came up to her feet.
Came up to her feet with the light bedroom chair in her hands, leaped toward Calban and pounded the improvised weapon down on his head.
The chair splintered, smashed.
Calban let Stan drop and whirled to Leila, He was laughing, actually he was laughing! his twitching Ups spewed.
“Calban like you that way.”
His hands lashed out, his fingers dug into the girl’s shoulder, sent fiery agony darting through her twisting, almost nude body.
“Calban like woman that can fight, but canot play now.
Must finish with man first.
Tear arms out, legs, like fly’s wings.”
“No,” Leila screamed.
“No.
Leave him alone.
Do what you want with me, but leave him alone.” simian visage was distorted by his yellow-toothed, imbecilic grin.
“Calban do what he like with both.”
She was helpless, infantile in his great hands as he flung her once more on the bed, as he ripped the sheets into strips and lashed her ankles, her wrists lashed them tightly, cruelly, pulling the knots with sadistic violence.
The rough edges of the tom linen cut into her shrieking flesh, were scarlet-edged with oozing blood.
On the floor behind the sava^ giani a Img fodder ran through Stan crunip^ itame, and be was crawling, as a stepped-upoii l^tle might in wtuxn life was yet ^te But unhke fl»t b^tle the man moved with a definite purpose^ A yard beyoid his sh^h^, hand lay the knife he had dropped.
A yard to his anguish body d»t yaid was an infinite dsta!cee.
But if he could reach that knife Leila, seeing, stoppered in her throat the momjs of her own agony sought to wrench from her and contrived a question to hold Calban long enough for Stan to succeed.
"What will your master say if you harm him?
Your master doesnot want you to "Cdban have no master,” the brute rage flaring into Ws little eyes.
"No cmc tell Calban what must or must not do."
Dismay pierced Leila as he twisted away from her, as he lurched toward Stan, whose scrabbling fingera were still mdies away from the Inirfe.
"No one The whistle shrilled in, the whistle that twice before had saved Stan.
A vague figure blotted the window’s dim rectangle.
"Mr. Corbett," Leila screamed, killing Stan. killing A Bargain with the Rend Foster Corbett who came surging in tlirough the aperture.
It was Eve Astoundingly it was Eve.
“Calban she yelled.
The whisfle hadnot stopped the monster this time.
He was lifting the lacerated, almost unconscious man from the floor by one hand, and his ofl\er was at diroat!
"Calban!"
Eve cried again.
"Stop it The g^nt ^msed.
Over the limp^ lolling frame of his vidam he ghoed at the darkhaired ghiy his face a denuxniac visage.
"No," he chattered.
“Calban will not be cheated any more.
Calbaa will- tdll the man, and take the woman, your ties w-ill net stop him ^^aiu."
"Calban!
I not lie to you."
Grotesque, hideeua, this cofloquy between the slim, girl whom Leila Monroy had known all her Kfe, and tire beetle-browed, barrel-chested savage who was an atovism from the very dawn of time.
“It was you who foigot our bargain and tried to force from me what I promised would be yours when you finished the task I set you.
If you hadnot attacked me, choked me Oh Godt It was blasphemous even to think his name in the presence of that woman!
"You ^you fiend,” Lefla burst out.
"You brwigtrt him here to kill me.
You glance flicked to her, and it ^ung Leila aa if &e evil in it were a barbed whiplash of frozen sted.
"Shut up!” she hissed.
“You donot count, now," Then she was concaitrating on the giant.
“Calban," she pleaded, “tet him go.
Let him live."
Lurid crawled siuisteriy in the brute’s small eyes, “No,” he gnintwi, and his throtdmg fillers started again to close, bit by cruel bit, on throat “No.
You want him, and you’ll never give yourself to Calban while he lives.” it, is it?" cry was abruptly a hollow whisper of defeat. what I must pay to save him Here, then, Calban.
Htre!"
Her hands flew to her throat, her fingers at the high, lacy collar tliat veiled it.
Then the flimsy silk was ripping; as those white lands tore down through it; ripping away from her chest, the creamy, heaving rounds of her desirous breasts, the taut, quivering hollow of her abdomen.
The shredded fabric slid down the long line of her thighs, reached the floor, and she threw out her arms to the beast-man in an abandon of seduction noisome as the uttermost depths of Hell, and glorious as Heaven itself.
Glorious because, whatever the woman was, whatever evil had driven her, she descended now into Hades to save the man she loved The man she loved!
In that moment the whole story was clear to Leila.
Eve loved Stan and Calban whimpered.
He let his victim fall.
He lumbered; uncouth, shaken by the tempest she had aroused within him; to the naked, alluring form of the temptress, luminous-seeming in the moonlight glow.
His black arms slid around that voluptuous form.
By some accident of the inscrutable fates, Stan had dropped right atop the knife he so futilely had struggled to reach.
His twitching, bloodless hand closed on its hilt.
Eve moaned, shudderingly, as shaggy arms enfolded her That moan seemed to explode in Stan with a sudden, spasmodic strength.
He lifted to his knees, flung the knife.
Point first, it was a silver flash streaking the moonlight, and then it was a black excrescence, quivering from the middle of back.
Blood spurted.
The monster squealed with the sudden pain.
His great hands gripped the woman they had been fondling, flung her from him in a paroxysm of rage.
She catapulted into the wall.
The crackling thud of crushing bone sickened Leila.
And then the bound girl was screaming in terror for her lover as the wounded beast-man whirled and plunged ferociously at the trooper, who was swaying on his knees, was toppling over from the effort alone of throwing that knife. writhing fingers closed on Stan.
Thunder crashed in the room.
It was the thunder of Foster gun. blazing from the doorway.
Long, orange-red jets of flame seared across the room. great form jolted to the impacts of the lethal lead, once, twice.
He collapsed like a ripped meal sack, rolled over near his intended victim, quivered and was still.
Foster Corbett came in.
He was mudcovered, from head to foot A blue bruise blotched the seamed gray of his face and one trouser leg flapped, grotesquely somehow in two disjointed halves.
But the man’s old, tired eyes glowed with a strange satisfaction.
“You gals sure can play hell,” he growled, “when you get to fighting over a boy.”
He picked up the knife and sliced lashings, then bent to his son’s flaccid form.
“Is is he Leila dared not finish the question, but Corbett understood and answered it.
“No. just knocked out and he's coming out of it now. be all right by noon, I imagine, right enough to stand up with you in front of the parson and “He wouldnot marry me, now,” Leila moaned.
“He wouldnot marry the daughter of a madman.”
“Madman, hell,” Corbett grunted, swinging around to crumpled, moaning body.
His gnarled fingers probed the girl’s hurts with a curious tentemcss.
Then, afraid you’re through, Eve,” he said.
“Maybe things will be a little better for your soul, where it’s going, if you tell Leila yourself.
White lips moved in face that was agony incarnate.
“Yes I swore you never would have Stan.

A gush of blood burbled from her lips, she writlied to a sitting position, threw out her arms.
“Forgive me, Stan.”
And then there wasnot an Eve Starr any more.
Only a pitiftd, nude corpse, slumped in a corner of the dreadful room. pieoed it together afterward, tale of that dreadful nigkt How, learning of message that her plot had failed, the love-maddened girl must have determined to have her d«pe kill Leila.

(Author of Pagm idocktry" ftej.
A ll day long I had been hoping against hope that young Philip Rice would reach Palo Alto Plantation House by supper time.
For a full year we had heard nothing from him, had almost ^ven up any expectation of ever hearing from him j^in.
So my old heart was set fluttering a bit by that peremptory knock, and I went to the door myself.
Birt when I reached it old Jude had already opened it.
I caught a glimpse of Bob Shane, the only taxi driver in the county, as he hurried down the graveled walk toward the gate.
Only a glimpse, for he was almost out of sight behind the jasmine bushes, and my old eyes had been drawn as by a magnet to the stranger who stood in the doorway, looking into the gathering shadows of the hall.
I canot describe him.
He was tall and slender and dark, with a face of free, wild beauty.
His eyes were black that black which is a total absence of light, and when they looked at me I was lost in them completely, filled with that insane desire which comes to some men on the summits of high places ^the desire to hurl oneself over the parapet to the ground below.
For with all his beauty and grace, there was about him something dreadful, sometliing terrifying.
“If you will pardon this intrusion the stranger began.
And his voice matched the rest of him.
It was low and vibrant.
At the sound of it I felt an icy hand close hard around my heart. bring a memento ^from young Philip Rice,” the voice was continuing. left him down south there.”
He made a curious gesture with his long, slender, beautiful hands.
Never had I seen such hands as his, so sensitive, so capable.
I am an old man and shocks are bad for me.
I stood there gasping.
A then, quite unexpectedly, he smiled, and I knew at once that my fears were foolish.
I could see that he was just an extraordinarily handsome man who was asking hospitality at a door which for more than a hundred years had refused hospitality to none.
“Come in,” I begged, in confusion.
“The place is crowded, and afraid I must put you in Sherburne room spoke hesitantly, for we never use that room at all.
It has been called a haunted room ever since Sherburne Rice the Second hurled a man out of it and down the north stairway to the death, of a broken neck in the garden.
But this was All Eve, when all of us gather to celebrate tbe date of the house’s building.
Every room but that was full, and I was imwilling to thrust so strange a guest upon any of my kin.
He smiled queerly. am sure I shall be at home there,” he said.
“My name is Minos Dis, and I come from a strange, far country.
As I said, I have brought a remembrance from your kinsman, Philip Rice.”
“For me?”
I asked.
I admit my voice was eager.
Young Philip had occupied the limelight at the family gathering last year.
He was an explorer, with an already brilliant and bewilderir^ history in spite of his youth.
Again the stranger smiled that strange, haunting, extraordinary smile. do not know yet for whom it is intended,” he answered, and his voice, though low and very, very quiet, had something dreadful in it, some hint of doom unthinkable. have come to learn.”
“And is Philip He made a slight gesture with one perfect hand.
It silenced me as if those slender fingers had dosed around my throat. shall tell you all presently,” was all he said.
I myself led the way upstairs to Sherburne room.
I did it reluctantly, but I could see nothing else to do.
And yet, somehow, as I opened the door into that orderly but long disused room, I felt that there was a certain significance, a certain fitness, in ushering that man into that particular room.
I could not umlerstand why I should feel so, but I did.
I saw to his comfort and left him there in that feared and haunted room.
And as I walked away, through the dim old hallway toward the stairs, the man’s strange and foreign sounding name kept echoit^ through my mind.
It had, somehow, a faint familiarity.
Minos.
Had that not been the name of a fabled king of Crete?
A strai^e name; and a strange man who laid claim to it, surely.
But then, our hoi»se has Icmg been used to strangeness and to heartbreak and to dread.
It is an cdd house, a pioneer house, built solidly and substantially of brick.
There are heavy iron bars at windows.
There is a huge pantry behind the kildien and a deep cistern under the floor.
And its time its people have been thankful for thinga.
For Palo Alto has a dark and flame-shot history.
They say that pirate gold built it, and that pirate and huecaneers tried tg raid it in the old days.
And it is certain that withstood a siege in by Santa men, and a grim and furious battle fought up and down hs stairways in 'sixty-five.
And, more heroic still, when one of its women was marooned there in the flood of 'ninety nine, she fought off the hungry, drirfccrazed blacks and saved herself and her two baby girls from horror indescribable.
A strong, hard breed, tfiose children of fearfully remembered Sherburne Rice, who come back, each thirty-first of October, which is the date ifl the cornerstone, to celebrate the building of our bouse. strange things h^pen, yet something always brii^ us together again, tiio very fascinaticm, perhaps, of the autre and the unpredictable.
And our very terror urges us to make of it a very festive occasion, even riotous, with all the trappings, and old wine brought up from the cdlar where Rodney wife was once walled up alive.
At least we are always glad to see each other^ and we always make a volant effort to be gay, with games and dancing and laughter.
But we were not gay this year It was dusk when I found Patricia Rice standing alone on the wide front gallery, watching the darkness inarch down the turgid river.
And I knew she was thinking of that time thirty-six years ago when the high ground the house stands on was an island in a sweep of muddy, swirling water and shft stood tliere alone Patricia is an old woman now, a grave and sensitive and understanding woman, and, some people say, a little psychic at times.

“It isnot that, altogether.

Of course, I do ways remember too n:iuch when I come here, Jerry.
I canot forget that I stood guard beside the bones of Sherburne Rice, the Pirate, and Sherburne Rice, the Terrible, of Reconstnrction days.
I canot forget that it was the negroes’ terror of those very bones that saved me and my babies.
But I lived through horror too.
And I had to

But couldnot go on.
And for a while we stood in silence, we who are old and who remember such strange things.
As for Philip. come to «s that year for the first time.
Not one of us had ever seen him before.
He had just got back then from an exploring trip into the heart of South America, somewhere where white men had never been before.
He had tried to fly over an inaccessible jungle, he explained, but the plane had crashed.
He had come down in the outskirts of a city as yet unknown to white men, a bewilderingly lovely deserted city.
His eyes grew rapt as he talked about it he seemed to be lost in memories.
His own enthusiasm fired even our earth-bound imaginations.
He made us feel that place its unimaginable splendor, its beauty, its vastness, its unthinkable antiquity.
And as he talked, he seemed to me to be the very quintessence of the Rices, to be possessed of all their charm, their beauty, their love of adventure and their valor, without those darker qualities for which so many of them have been famed.
I loved the boy, and I hated the way his eyes were held by Moma Lane.
A tribe of Indians Mayas lived near the city, he told us, but they never entered it except for religious ceremonies, and even then they barred him out.
So he had to explore it by stealth, taking his life in his hands at every venture within its sacred walls.
He had stiunbled all by accident upon a Mayan treasure house.
The natives would have killed him if they had known.
For these Mayas had a rabid dread of white men.
Around their fires at night they told strange old legends of the Conquistadors, horrifying tales of pillage and torture and enslavement.
There would never be another invasion of white men into their land, they swore.
Yet, paradoxically, they had welcomed Philip, offered him membership in their tribe, made of him a sort of reincarnation of their Fair God.
And I could understand that, looking at him down the table.
He was one of those fortunates whom people love at sight.
Certainly our whole family fell in love with him that night.
And he?
Well, he fell in love with Moma Lane, the stepdaughter of one of our many cousins.
She was one of those fair girls whose beauty seems to shine, to dazzle men’s eyes.
And she was captivated with Philip or with the things he stood for.
Their eyes were locked together while he told his tale.
She was breathless, eager.
And she begged him to go back!
“But you must,” she cried. you see?
You brought nothing out with you.
You have no proof of your discovery.
Go back Get pictures and specimens, and astonish the world.
Bring me a Mayan amulet, Phil!"
Philip laughed and shook his head.
He knew the danger, you see.
If he, having been a sort of god among the Mayas before his escape, should now return.
It made me shiver even to guess at his punishment.
Besides, the Mayas had been in the habit of sacrificing the incarnations of their gods.
That old, puzzling, heathen idea that the essence of the human god must go back at stated times to keep the godhead strong was one of the fundamentals of their religion.
No one knew that better than Philip.
Yet he did return to his Mayan city.
We heard about it later, and the news had made my heart sink as if under leaden weights.
I am an old man, and I had loved that boy.
And now some one had come wlio claimed to bring us news of him.
But how weird and strange a messenger Yes, I believed with Patricia tliat something was going to happen.
Something dreadful.
Something far worse than merely strange. one of the darkies would go to Sherburne room to summon our strai^r guest to supper.
They made various plausible-seeming excuses, but I understood.
They were afraid.
So I climbed the weary stairs myself, stairs that had been tracked with human blood these many tunes.
My liand a little as I knocked on Sherburne door.
That strange, weirdly melodious voice bade me enter, but I did no more than open the door.
The stranger stood bareheaded in the lamplight.
The unearthly beauty of him struck me with new force.
My ey^ were so lost in that compelling gaze of his that I was barely conscious of the box he held between his hands not a large tox but extraordinary, like everythit^ else about him.
It had tlie look of having been made of a single opal; yet, impossible as that seemed, I know that I thought nothing of it at the time.
He shook his head slowly at mention of supper, be^ed to be excused.
-He would join us later, he said.
And such was the sprfi he had me under that I no protest, though deep down in me was an almost paralyzing fear.
A guest who wmdd not eat our salt or brealt our bread with us was not that a gurat truly to be feared But as I turned away from titat hated room, a queer choked-off cry jerked my thoi^hts away.
Terror lent me strength.
I hurried to door and jericed it open and lunged inside.
She was standing by the hearth in the full light of the tall white candles on the mantel.
Her face was ghastly and she held both hands to her tiiroat.
Her eyes, had tiiat supernatural look they sometimes have.
As I cried out at her in terror she lowered Iter hands and turned to loc^ at me.
Slowly her eyes regained their sanity.
She swallowed hard. thought for an instant that something had me by the throat ^was throttling me she whispered shakily.
I donot know.
If Sherburne Bice is walking it might be a ghastly business, Jerry.
It would be like liira to want to avenge his kinsman if Her voice died in a hoarse rattle in her throat.
I got Patricia downstairs someliow.
A buriness, that ^aipper.
One of our sudden northers struck the ^ace just as the meal was served.
Before the fires could be built up to give adequate warmth the house was staridy cold.
We were all shivering when we came to the loaded table.
And the wind was crying in a bmishee’s dirge through the leaves of the live oaks, keoiing under the eaves, aioimd the cornices of the old house.
A hound down in the quarters li fted his voice in the eerie howling that tells you death is passing.
And the negroes moved on noiseless feet, their dark skins grey, their eyes wild, their hands a-quivcr with terror.
And I could think of nothing but young Philip Rice, whose infatuation for an empty-headed girl had sent him into what must have been unthinkable and of the stranger who claimed to a>me from lum mid of the cool-eyed, smiling Moma Lane who sat acnoss tiie table from me.
We old folks sat about the fire in the back parlor after supper, and listenal to the shrieks of the rising wind, and told tales under our breatlj of the bloody deeds of Shelburne Rice the buc^aam’ and of his grandscai, Sherburne Rice the Second.
And while we whispered of past terrors and bloody deeds, the young pet^le danced in the big front parlor, bobbed for apples, looked in mirrors, and had their fortunes tc^.
But their attempts at gaiety were futile.
The b%ht of tlte stranger's presence was on them too.
It was midnight when the strainer came into the dim temjdight of the room wliere we were wmting.
The box I had seen in the haunted room iq>stairs was in his hands.
It seemed to me that a little chilly wind, not bom of the shrieking norther outside, came in with him.
And the far away howling of the dog had now become an anguished, maddened whine of fright.
The music in the front room ceased.
The young people crowded in witii us and sank down upon stools and cushions around the fire.
Morna eager, piquant face stood out startlingly iu the soft light.
I could not keep my old eyes away from her, she seemed so excited, so avid for the news that was coming.
And suddenly I knew that I hated her.
And the stranger stood in the wide doorway between the parlors and looked at us with his unfathomable eyes. all knew Philip Rice,” he stated quietly in his grave, deep, organtoned voice.
“He was kin to you?”
Some few of us murmured in assent.
Philip had been kin to all of us, except to Moraa Lane.
“He went back to the village in the jungle,” the sonorous voiced rolled on.
“He must have known that death awaited him there, yet he was driven by a force he could not resist.”
He paused, and the silence was absolute except for the soft crackle of the fire, and tlie wind, and the howling dog.
“He went back.
Even then he might have escaped his doom if he had been careful, for he had friends among the Mayas.
They are a remnant of a once highly civilized and mighty race, as yet uncontaminated by intermarriage with other breeds.
Their great stone city is an amazing place.
You would marvel at it if I could make you see it.
Where did the stones in its walls come from?
They are huge and expertly cut.
But what force brought them from their distant quarry, what force lifted them to their destined places in the towering walls?
No man knows.
Unthinkable wisdom, those long dead Mayas must have had, unthinkable riches.
Their ancient treasure house would make the richest treasury in your world look like a beggar’s pittance.
Gold and strangely wrought ornaments and glowii^ gems.
Why did Philip Rice persuade the Mayan girl who loved him to take him there That place was holy.
He knew it.
What untumable force could have sent him there?”
His black eyes moved from face to face, and I saw men and women sway backward as his eyes moved over them even as a field of grain sways when a wind blows over it.
“He took something exceedingly precious from that treasure house,” the stranger said, very quietly.
And his eyes came to rest on the opalescent box between his hands.
I saw Moma Lane lean forward, just a trifle, as if to see it better.
But her face was inscrutable.
I could make nothing of it.
Could she have cared for Philip and still betray no sign, now that he must be dead “The Mayan girl loved him with a selfless, undemanding love.
She helped him do the thing that he desired to do.
She showed him a secret pass through the hills.
Because she loved him.
Savage women are like that sometimes women to whom love is everything, even though the loved one lias no thought for them as Philip certainly had none for her.
His thought was all for the white girl who had sent him back.
He was mad to get for her the bauble she demanded.
And it was only through the native girl that he could get it so he took it and started home alone.
And he might have escaped, for the Mayas made no attempt to pursue him.
They but sent a messenger after him with the severed hand of the girl who had helped him.
‘Come back and burn,’ their message said, ‘or we burn the woman instead,’ He did not hesitate.
He went back.
And they gave his body to their gods.” screamed.
I think the rest did too.
I couldnot.
My breath stuck in my throat.
I was beyond the relief of any outcry.
I was stuni^.
The stranger watched us with his relentless eyes, tlwase eyes that were black with the blackness that is total absence of light.
He lifted the priceless box that was neither large nor »nall, the box that seemed to be made of a single fire-tinted opal, in his perfect hands.
I bring back from the jungle/' he cried, a pulse throbbir^ in his voice as the sacrificial drums must have throbbed in tile jungle while Philip died.
“It is meant for some one Itere.
To whom does it belong?”
It was beautiful, that box.
It glowed Ml glory in the ligtit of the leaping fire.
No rainbow in the world could ever have shown such colors, colors that wrkhed and burned Mid faded and burned ^ain.
But we drew t«ck frwn it in horror.
It was accursed For all its beauty it was stained with another oolor that did not show.
The color of blood.
“It belongs to one of you,” the stranger said, inexorably.
I saw Morna Lane lean forward suddenly.
She gasped, as a swimmer might gasp on tlie brink of an icy plunge.
Her hand reached out, drew back, reached out again.
She tried to speak, and could not.
The stranger gave her a long, still look from his fathomless eyes.
“It is yours then?” he asked, and his voice was husky and filled with deep vibratioiw like die music that comes from the strings of a bass viol.
Still she could not speak.
But she nodded, jerkily, and swallowed hard; and her outstretched fingers clenrfied and unclenched and clenched again in a spasm of desire.
He laid that lovely, priceless thing within their grasp.
He turned, slowly, and walked away, his head bent, like a man who was very tired, into the front parlor and across it into the hall.
I watdied him climb the stair slowly and sadly and yet with an air of duty done.
When he had passed from sight, my eyes came bad« to that room of silence.
Only one of the group liad moved.
Morna Lane was gone.
The rest sat still, white-faced, silentstricken. the morning I went with weary plodding feet to call our stranger guest to br^kfast.
It was late in the morning then, but only a few of the kin had come downstairs, and they looked as if th^^ had not slept.
The wind still bowled.
The hound was silent.
Oid Jude Imd whispered to me with tangled, stammering tongue that during the niglit die dog had died of terror.
My old hand shorfc as I knocked on the door of Sherburne room.
There was no answer, and, shaking as in a chill, I pushed the door open.
There was no one in that haunted room.
There was no sign that any one had ever been in it.
Nothing seemed to have been touched.
Even the bed was undisturbed.
Even as be had refused to eat at our table, so, it seemed, he had refused to sleep beneatli our roof.
Slowly, painfully, I stumbled down the stair.
Never had I felt so old and helpless and dismayed.
Patricia took my arm in the lower hall, and for the first time in my life I was glad of a woman's help.
Swnehow she got me to the telephone.
After what seemed hours of fumblii^ I got Bob Shane, the taxi driver, on the wire.
When had he taken the stranger back to town?
“But I never brought nobody out to Palo Alto,” he bawled in exasperation.
“Nobody at all.
Old Jude must’ve gone plum’ loco.
I brought out a small package that come by express, an’ I left it with that old dumb nigger at the door. the matter with the old hellion anyhow?”
I couldnot answer him.
The receiver dropped from ray nerveless hand.
I was sick, but there was something I had to do.
“That box I gasped to Patricia.
“Quick! got to find out what was in that box “Morna isnot down yet,” Patricia objected.
“Most of the young folks arenot.
Up late last night, you know “It makes no difference,” I mumbled. got to find out, Patricia.
I tell you, we’ve got to find out I saw her own face whiten.
I donot know whether her thougiit was the same as mine.
I never did know, for we never talked about it afterward.
But she helped me back upstairs and down the hall to the room that was Moma l^e’s.
She didnot answer when we knocked, and her door was locked.
I had to send for some of the men to break it down.
And then I wished I could have left it locked till judgment day.
I can never get that picture from before my eyes.
The opaline box lay on the night table by the bed.
It was open and empty.
Morna lay cold and quiet in her bed.
Her white hands still gripped the wrist of a severed brown hand that clutched her throat, in a desperate, futile effort to wrench it away a brown hand that had once been part of a Mayan maid who had loved and aided Philip Rice.
And face That is what I would almost be willing to give my immortal soul to forget.
But forget I cannot.
And even as we stared, spellbotind with horror, the brown fingere relaxed their grip, the hand fell to the pillow and lay still, its work well done “Sherburne Rice Patricia was babbling h3f6terically, over and over.
“The vegeance of Sherburne Rice But I was not so sure.
I stood there thinking of the strange man who called himself Minos Dis, the man who ate not and slept not in our house the man whom Bob Shane had not been able to see.
And I remembered then that Dis is another name for Pluto, the god of the nether world, and that Minos was one of the judges who rendered judgments there.

(Author of "Corpses for Witches ileen was just hanging up the dish towel on the rack beside the kitchen sirdc when she heard John car as it came into the driveway, and stopped by the back door.
A slightly annoyed look settled across the girl's pretty face.
John O'Marra alwa3rs made her feel strangely uneasy even more so of late.
John with his heavy black brows and his habit of scowling at nothhig.
He insisted he was Loved Pain It was the spirit of the devil, the good Irish folk said, that infested and blackened the soul of lovely Nancy Gannon.
For Ntmcy smiled at the sight of blood, and laughed when men died in agony and at times her strange heart-numhing joy drove her to dance naked the one shfh doom that was upon him... in love wife Eileen but when he came to see her he would often just sit there, staring at Nancy, eighteen year old sister.
Eileen couldnot understand him, but for some reason she was afraid of of'fending him by showing her uneasiness.
She looked at the clock.
It was just seven o’clock in the. evening early for callers, even in Blairfteld.
Quick footsteps sounded on the back porch and the kitchen door banged open.
John O’Marra stood there for a moment, breathing quickly.
“Hello, John.”
The girl's hands went to her hair, then smoothed the apron over her slim hips. wasnot expecting you this evening.” come to see you this time, Eileen.”
John O’Marra made a quick nervous jerk with his head. your dad?”
“In the living room.”
A look of sudden alarm spread over the girl’s face. happened? wrong?”
“Plenty John O’Marra went through the small dinii^ room of the Gannon home with Eileen at his heels.
Paddy Gannon, father, big and barrel-chested with black hair that showed no sign of grey, was sitting beside a table lamp reading his paper.
His wife, frail but bright-looking, was knitting at the other side of the table.
Mr. Gannon raised his eyes, looked at John face and let his paper drop to the floor.
"Trouble, eh, Johnny?”
“Yes, sir.
A cave-in.
Eddie Dwyer is trapped.” cave-in.”
Paddy voice became a growl.
"How could that happen?
I looked that tunnel over just before sundown. something very dirty going on, Johnny.”
He stamped out into the hall and got his hat.
Eileen went over and stood close to her mother.
The two women watched with fearful eyes as Paddy Gannon opened the drawer of the living room table, took out a white brassard, and slipped it on his left arm.
As they started out John O’Marra said, got to get Father Doyle, Mr. Gannon. ril see you at the shaft.”
“Is there a doctor there?”
“Yes, sir.
One of the boys got Dr. Akers.”
The noise of Paddy small car joined that of John for a moment behind the house.
Then they both roared out of the driveway. tightened her arm around waist.
"Trouble, Eileen, darlin', trouble.
Black days are upon us.
Working the mines in the dead of the night, sneaking the coal out in trucks that donot turn on their engines until they reach the bottom of the hill.
Fights with the cc«npany men.
Now this secret society.
The Silents they call themselves.
Secret societies breed trouble.
This is the third accident in two weeks.
It seems as if a curse has been put on the Blairfield mines Eileen interrupted her mother.
Nancy?”
Her mother blinked once or twice.
“Nancy went out right after dinner.
I suppose she’s over at the house.
Eileen, have you noticed anything strange about Nancy of late Sometimes the child frigjitens me.” bright blue eyes looked into her mother’s tired grey ones and she caught her lip between her teeth.
"Well, you know how girls are when they reach eighteen. always hard to understand at that ^e.”
"But you’re twenty-one,” Mrs. Gannon said.
“You didnot behave so strangely at her age.
Sometimes the woman’s voice dropped to almost a whisper "sometimes I feel that she’s not my own daughter at all.”
"Hush, mother.”
Eileen patted the older woman’s shoulder. going out for a little while.
Do you mind?”
“Out?”
Her mother glanced toward the window.
"But it’s starting to rain.
Where are you going “Up to the mine.”
"Now, Eileen donot go up there.
You know your father wouldnot like it.
They donot want the women up there, especially when there’s trouble.
There will be a rough crowd up there and besides you’ll get drenched.” wear my slicker and rubbers and mind my own business,” Eileen said, keep out of their way.
If you want anything before I come back Neil is upstairs doing his home work, isnot he?”
“Yes, like a good boy.
But I wish you wouldnot go.” wonot be long," Eileen was pulling on her raincoat, adjusting a soft felt hat so it would deflect the rain from her face and neck.
She opened the door on a ni^t that was black with a wind-driven rain.
There was a group of a score or so of men gathered armmd the mouth of the ^aft in the Blairfleld coal mines.
Coal oil torches flared and sent out fitful, downthfust flames hi the storm wind.
The ring of faces around the entrance to the shaft was picked out in red and black lights and shadows.
Mostly men, because the women had b«n forbidden to come.
Eddie mother and sisters were there, for it was Eddie who was trapped in the tunnel.
Their faces were no less grimly expectant than those of the other watchers.
Paddy Gannon and the doctor and priest were in the shaft with the shift that was trying to dig through to Eddie Dwyer.
No word was spoken in the waiting huddle.
Off to one side, on slight rise made by a dump pile, two figures stood alone.
The man was straight as a pine tree, dressed in rags, and his long snow-white beard was spread out on his chest by the wind so that it looked like a white jacket.
The girl was slender, and she wore neither hat nor coat.
Her black hair airled in the rain, and her thin dress was so wet it clung to her every contour, revealing a figure beautifully and youthfully feminine.
She had a lovely elfin face with large eyes that seemed to tilt up gently at the outer comers, and her hair was blown back, showing tiny ears that came to points at the edges.
There was a strange expression on her face as she stood there beside the old man, heedle^ of the elements, watching the group around the shaft.
She looked like a person who is witnessing a pageant of rare beauty.
Her lovely lips were half parted, like a cliild’s in front of a Christmas tree.
The old man just stood beside her, still and without expression.
Standing there together they looked, in the weird li^t of the torches, like the study of an inspired sculptor. came up the skirted the group at the mouth of the mine shaft, and climbed the little rise to where the girl and the old man were standing.
She seized the girl’s arm.
“Nancy.
What are you doing here?
Standing in the rain widiout hat or coat! better come home,” The white-bearded man turned his head once to look at Eileen, then looked away again.
Nancy Gannon turned her lovely young face toward her sister, “Oh, Eileen! that a beautiful picture?
Those people huddled in the rain and torchlight, with their faces hard with worry and sharp with pain waiting, waiting.
It is so beautiful it fills me with delight, makes me want to run and leap and sing “Nancy!”
Her sister’s voice was brisk.
“Eddie Dwyer is trapped in tiiere.
Daddy is one of the men trying to get him out.
He and the others might get cauglit in a cave-in before they can reach Eddie. talking nonsense and you’ll catch your death of cold.
Come.
Come home with me at once.”
“All right, Eileen,” Naticy said slowly.
I hate to leave such a lovely s%ht.
Good night, Seamus O’Callahan.
Lovely, like the little folk gathered around their fire, waiting for one of their mates who has been trapped in the world, and is late in coming.”
Eileen twitched her sister's arm.
“Keep still, and hurry.”
They had gone a dozen paces or so when Eileen said, “Why do you talk to that old hermit, Seamus O’Callahan?
Everyone knows he’s crazy.
People will talk if they see you with him like that. been told before.”
“Seamus O’Callahan is not crazy,” Nancy said.
“He is a gentle and kind man with a sensitive soul.
He sees beauty with eyes that others lack.
He talks to me until too, can see, beauty.”
"If I tell Dad you’ve been talking to Seamus O’Callahan, and calling it beautiful that Eddie Dwyer got trapped in the cave-in, he’ll take a strap to you, even if you are eighteen.”
Nancy shivered and started to walk faster.
Her voice had a quieter, more normal pitch when she spoke this time. wet through. hurry.”
The two sisters were lying side by side in bed when they heard their father’s car come into the yard.
They heard him stamp up the back steps into the kitchen.
Mrs. Gannon was up, waiting for her husband, with a pot of coffee on the stove.
The girls could hear them talking in tlie kitchen right below the bedroom.
“Did you get him out?”
Mrs. Gannon asked.
“Yes,” Paddy Gannon rumbled.
“We got him out too late.
Dead, he was, when we got to him.
Too late for priest or doctor.
I tell you, Mary, there is something very dirty about it all. not natural. like the place was bewitched.
Three accidents without any reason or cause, one after tlie other.
For all the world as if there was a black spell put on the place.”
Black Clouds dropped off to sleep to dream of the grim tableau at the mine.
Again she saw the huddle of anxious, fear-ridden figures at the mouth of the shaft.
No word or cry had been uttered at the shaft, but Eileen dreamed that somebody cried out sharply.
The cry came again, cut through tlie veil of sleep.
It seemed still to echo in the quiet house when Eileen sat up in bed, fully awake.
Nancy moved restlessly by her side, but did not answer when Eileen spoke to her.
Eileen leaned close and saw her sister’s eyes were shut, and that she breathed like a person in a deep sleep.
This time the noise was a frightened wliimper, and it came from the next room.
Eileen slipped out of bed and pulled on her robe.
As she went through the door to her young brother’s room she switched on the light.
Neil, her ten year old brother, was sitting up in bed, his eyes round discs of fright.
He was still whimpering.
"What is it, Neil?”
Eileen approadied tlie boy’s bed.
He looked at her without answering.
Paddy Gannon came thumping into the room in his bare feet, wearing an old fashioned flannel night shirt. this?
Was that you screaming, son?” donot know,” the boy said slowly. donot know if I screamed, but I was asleep and it was like as if somebody was holding a light over me.
Then somebody slapped my face, hard, three or four times.
Then the light seemed to go out and I woke up.”
“Bad dreams!”
Mr. Gannon scoffed.
“Too much sweet stuff on your stomach.”
“No,” the boy protested.
“Somebody was really slapping me.
I can still feel my face sting.”
Eileen leaned over the boy’s bed.
“Yes, dad.
His face is red, just as if he had been slapped.
Red and white welts.”
“Wrinkles in the pillow,” Mr. Gannon rumbled.
"Go back to sleep, Neil, and donot let me hear any more out of you.
You frightened 3^ur mother out of a sound sleep."
The hoy put his hand gingerly to the side of his face, then slowly lay back.
“Yes, sir." turned and went back to her room.
She switched on the small bed lamp for a ^ond.
The faint smell of hot wax came to her nostrils.
There was a candle in a pewter stick on the bedside table purely an ornament.
But there was a little pool of melted wax around the wick.
The wick, when she touched it, was still warm.
The candle was on side, within easy reach of her hand.
"Eileen stood there looking down at her sister with a strange, half-frightened expression.
But lovely faunlilffi face was wreathed in an innocent sleep smile.
The neck of her nightdress was Awry, ahowmg the white throat and the of her breast.
Half child, half woman-— all lovely.
Slowly, shaking her head, Eileen crawled back into her side of their bed.
“Nb, no.
It couldnot have= been Nancy.
She wouldnot have done tliat.
But his face was streaked.
And that candle was lighted only a short while ago. Oh, no.
Not my sister Nancy. unthinkable The next evening Nancy was not home for dinner and the Gannons sat down without her.
Prom time to tune Paddy Gannon looked at the clock and demanded sourly, Nancy? keeping her/”' donot know," Mrs. Gannon said at length.
“She must be over at the I canot think of where dse she could iie.”
Paddy Gannon finished his second cup of coffee and thumped his napkin down on the table. going after her.
What kind of conduct does she call that Not commg trame to meals, staying out by herself after dark, wandering around.
It seems you havenot taught your second daughter the things she should know, Mary. time I took a hand."
He filled his pipe, put on his hat and coat and stamped out.
“Oh, dear,” Mrs. Gannon breathed fearfully. hope .she is at I do hope she is," Eileen patted her mother’s shoulders reassuringly but there was a serious cast to her pretty face as she carried the dishes into the kitchen.
Mr. Gannon had not yet returned when Paul Savage came to see Eileen.
He was a slim, good-looking young man with a rather solemn expression.
He dressed mudh better than most of the yoimg men of Blairfield.
He was in the- living room talking to Mrs. Gannon when Neil came out to the kitchen where his sister Eileen was putting away the silver.
“That Paul Savage Is cnit in the parlor waiting for you,” Neil said.
“You donot like him, do you, Neil?”
Eiken smiled.
“Aw, he’s a dude.
I like John O’Marra.
Why donot you marry Johnny O’Marra, Sis? r^ular, and he’s a big shot in the Silents."
“Sshf’ Eileen put her finger to her lips.
“You shouldnot talk about that.
You know it.”
“Huh," Neil muttered.
“Everybody knows who the Silents are. one of them. why he donot like a company man like Paul Savage coming around to see you.
He likes Johnny O’Marra, too.”
“You keep still,” Eileen warned him.
“Or you’ll get yourself in trouble."
She took off her apron and went into the living room, Paul Savage rose from his chair.
When he smiled he looked much younger.
“Would you and your .nujther like to go to the movies?" he asked.
“No,” Mrs. Gannon quickly, added.
“Thank you, Paul, but I want to wait for Mr. Gannon.
You and Eileen go."
“Come out in the kitchen, Paul,” Eileen said. want to show you something.” in the kitchen Eileen closed the door and faced the young man.
“Paul, terribly worried about Nancy. where Dad is now, out looking for her.
I want to wait until he gets back. been acting awfully strange of late.”
Paul took her hand.
“Eileen, why donot you stop worrying about your silly sister, and listen to me?
I want to marry you, Eileen.” call her silly, please,” Eileen begged. really worried.”
“As long as you must talk about her,” Paul said, “All right.
People are beginning to notice that she’s well different. the prettiest girl around, not counting you, of course.
Yet she scares the fellows away because she never wants to do the ordinary things.
She wants them to go out and run in the rain with her instead of going to the movies.
She doesnot talk like anybody in Blairfield.
She could have any young man in town if she stopped being like that.”
“What are people saying about her?”
Eileen asked.
Paul Savage shrugged.
“Oh, I donot listen to gossip. you interested in.” sweet, Paul.
But worried.
Oh, here’s Dad now.” car came into the yard and stof^d at the side of the house.
The front door opened and Eileen and Paul could hear Mr. voice.
“Well, I found her Mrs. Gannon said mildly, “Where have you been, Nancy dear?” drove all over town looking for her,” Paddy Gannon growled.
“And where do you think I found her?
In the grave yard where!
I was driving past slow, thinking and worrying, and I heard laugh.
I hopped the fence and there she was, sitting on a tombstone in the dark by the side of a newly filled grave, talking to crazy old Seamus O’Callahan.
The two of them perched there on a headstone, for all the world like two ghouls.
And crazy old Seamus telling her mad stories about the Little Folk and the banshee and the leprechauns fairy stories “Well, now,” Mrs. Gannon said placatingly. a great many people aroimd here who still believe those things, and you’d not call them crazy.
You said yourself there was a black curse on the Blairfield mines.
If there are evil spirits, why canot there be “Hold your tongue, woman Paddy Gannon made a threatening gesture toward his wife.
Nancy stood there, watchii^ and listening with a sort of pleased smile on her lovely young face.
Mrs. Gannon made a helpless little gesture and stopped talking.
I troubles enough?”
Gannon demanded.
“Trouble getting the coal out.
Trouble with accidents that donot look like accidents at ail.
Trouble with the company and the men.
And then my fine young daughter spends hgr time in the evening in the graveyzu’d talking to a mad hermit. old enough to have done with that childish stuff, Nancy.
Look at you.
Why, you’re you’re a woman!”
“Old Seamus tells such lovely stories,” Nancy said sweetly.
“If I catch you talking to him again take the strap to you Gannon thundered. take the back of my hand to you in the public street, grown and all as you are."
“No,” Nancy said softly. beat me.
You would be very unlucky the rest of your days if you were to strike me.” kind of talk is this?”
Gaanon bellowed.
He took three quick strides to pass between the table and his wife’s chair to reach his daughter.
His foot caught in the electric lamp cord, swept the lamp off the table to crash heavily on the floor.
In falling it had missed Mrs. Gannon by bare inches.
Gannon stood there with the wrecked lamp at his feet and, for a second, his face was purple.
Then the anger seemed to go out of him.
“That almost hit you, Mary,” he told his wife. sorry for my clumsiness.”
Nancy looked from her father to her mother and her face was calm and sweet. going upstairs to bed.”
In tile kitchen Eileen Gannon turned to Paul Savage.
“You heard it.
Sitting on a headstone in the graveyard, listening to a crazy hermit tell stories.
Paul, so worried about tier.
It isnot tliat she herself is crazy, sure. just that some times she isnot Nancy at all.
Mother and Dad donot Inrow how to handle her. afraid it’s up to me.” wish I could help,” Paul said.
“But she’s your sister.
I wouldnot be much ure. afraid.”
Mr. Gannon came into the kitchen, stopped dead when he saw Paul Savage.
“Hahl So you’re here, are you?”
“Good evening, Mr. Gannon.” you company men,” Gannon said deliberately, “are all pleased to hear that Eddie Dwyer died in a cave-in.”
“You donot understand, Mr. Gannon," Paul explained. only work for the Company, but I know how they feel.
They know go in there and take out coal and ^ip it out quietly by trucks.
They know you have armed guards stand there while the men work.
They could call in other armed guards and cause bloodshed.
They donot, because of the men in Blairfield worked in the mines for yrars and will work there again when things open up.
But you work those shafts at your own risk.
You know that, Mr. Gannon.”
“There has been a lot of mysterious trouble lately,” Gannon said. suppose the company doesnot know about that, either “The company doesnot want trouble,” Paul insisted.
“When hot-heads like John O'Marra get excited they blame everything on the company.”
“Johnny O’Marra is loyal to his own kind,” Gannon said sharply. a trouble maker,” Paul answeral firmly.
“Things are bad enough without men like O’Marra keeping things stirred up."
“If you’re interested to know," Gannon said slowly. look with more favor on Johnny O’Marra than on another who was raised in Blairfield, and went away and got a fine education, and came back to work for the company-— against Ids own kind." know you mean me,” Paul said. do work for the company.
So did you, for years, as a mine foreman.
And when things pick up you’ll be working for them again unless there is serious trouble.” not sol” Gannon exploded.
“The company never intends to work Blairfield again, and they hate to see us scrape a few dollars out of it to keep from starving.”
Paul Savage shrugged. keep a check on Johnny O’Marra, Mr. Gannon. getting too big for his pants. let him get you into an rthing you’ll be sorry for."
From outside came the rattle of a noisy car coming into the driveway. think that’s John now,” Eileen said.
“Please donot start any unpleasaiitness.”
John O’Marra came in tlie back door, said good evening to Mr. Gannon and Eileen, and nodded curtly to Paul Savage.
He stood there awkwardly for a moment.
Then his heavy black brows drew down and he said, “Mr. Gannon, could I speak to you alone What I have to say is ncrf: for the ears of company spies.”
“Come with me,” Gannon invited.
They left the kitchen and went into the living room.
“Johnny was just one of the boys, working in the mine, when things were good,” Paul said meditatively.
“Now, with all this trouble, he’s getting to be a person of consequence.
The men defer to him and your father alike.
If your father doesnot watch out he’ll be taking orders from Johnny O’Marra, yet.”
“Trouble!”
Eileen put her hands to her temples.
"The air is heavy witli it. like watching a black cloud come rolling over the horizon.”
She shivered.
Who Walks at Night? was sound asleep when Eileen retired.
The older sister stood looking at the younger girl for several moments before putting out the light. face was so sweet and childishly free from lines.
The black hair clustered around her temples, and the lashes curled, smudge-black, against the warm whiteness of her cheek.
Eileen bent and kissed her sister’s forehead, very gently.
In sleep, lips curved.
Eileen stretched out beside her sister but sleep was reluctant to come.
She shifted position constantly, but did it gently so as not to disturb Nancy.
Eventually she dozed off, a fitful, tense sort of half-oblivion instead of a sound relaxed slumber.
Suddenly she snapped out of her halfconscious state and sat bolt upright in bed.
She reached over and tried to touch Nancy.
The other half of the bed was empty I Smothering a frightened exclamation Eileen switched on the'bed light.
Her sister Nancy was gone Eileen sat there, hands to her temples, trying to think coherently.
The house was silent as a tomb.
If she started to look for Nancy it would wake her father and mother.
Then, if Nancy had left the house, there would be a terrific scene.
Paddy Gannon would go looking for his daughter, and when he found her he’d give her a horrible beating.
Not since they were children had their father struck either of them.
But Eileen knew if her father discovered Nancy had left the house, a black rage would get the best of him.
Eileen covered her own face with her hands.
"No, no.
I wonot wake them. just wait, and pray. come back.
She must come back.
A that dragged like a prison sentence then the clatter of a car, a thximping on the front door.
Eileen bounded from bed, snatched her robe and ran down the stairs, her heart pounding.
“Something has happened.
Something has happened to Nancy.”
Her fingers groped for the light switch and then fumbled with the front door latch.
She had to cling to the door jamb to keep from surrendering to her trembling knees and folding up on the floor.
John O’Marra pushed in, his dark face pale and his eyes bright with a strange frightened look. your dad?”
“In bed,” Eileen stammered.
“Is something wrong?
Did something happen to “Get him up.”
John facial muscles jerked as he said each word.
“What goes on down there?”
Paddy Gannon bellowed from the stair head.
John O’Marra.”
“Come down, for sake,” John shouted.
“The shaft is haunted!
I saw it with my own eyes.
Joe Dixon and I were on the second level, waiting for the bucket, when all of a sudden Joe says in a scared voice, ‘Look!’
I looked and saw something white gliding toward us from the tunnel.
Joe let a yell out of him and stepped back -and fell down the shaft. killed.
I fired a shot right at the ghost but it just disappeared.”
“You must be drunk or crazy “No.
I saw it.
Joe saw it too and that’s what made him fall.
While we were getting body out another one of the boys saw it.
A white thing tliat seemed to float*along in the dark tunnel.
None of the boys will go back in the shaft.” get dressed and be right with you,” Paddy Gannon said.
Eileen stood downstairs in the hall, clutching her robe around her.
“What did it look like this thing you saw?
Could it have been a woman, or a girl?”
“No.
It was nothing human, I tell you.
I fired right at it.”
“You shot it?” voice was unsteady.
“And it disappeared where?”
“Just disappeared,” John repeated.
“Into the blackness of the shaft.”
Mr. Gannon came clumping down the stairs, his shoes not yet laced.
He grabbed his hat and coat.
“Haunted His voice was scornful. think you were bach hi the dark ages in Ireland.”
After they had gone Eileen crept back upstairs to bed.
She was trembling so she had to grasp the banister with both hands as she made the ascent.
Once in her room she threw herself face down on the bed.
Once more, the house was very pounding of her own heart boomed in her ears.
Nancy gone.
A white figure in the mine a. ghost.
Joe Dixon hurtling to his death John O’Marra shooting point blank at the white figure.
Nancy gone.
The words and thoughts flooded her mind in a confused and terrible jumble.
She was afraid as she had never before known fear.
Not fear of a known thing something tangible you see and understand and fight off but a heart-chilling terror of some unknown menace. she awoke the sun was streaming in her window and the little clock on the bedside table said six.
She turned quickly.
Nancy was lying there beside her, breathing regularly, sleeping like a child.
Maybe it was all a horrible dreamt Then she saw a red smear on the bed sheet that covered shouders.
She drew back the covers. white nightgown was torn at tire right shoulder, and under the tear a crimson groove marred the flawless skin.
Not deep, but raw and angry looking.
It might have been made by the branch of a tree run into in the dark.
It might have been made by the lash of a whip— or the sting of a speeding bullet as it grazed its mark, Eileen went quietly into the bathroom and got the iodine bottle. eyes opened as the strong antiseptic seared the red flesh of the wound.
She looked up at her sister and smiled sweetly.
“It doesnot hurt much,” “Nancy!”
Eileen leaned over her.
“Where have you been darling?
What happened to your shoulder?” have been asleep, right here beside you,” Nancy murmured drowsily.
“And I had lovely dreams.
Red lights in the dark underground, and yellow lights and men’s faces reflected.
And one face so frightened the man’s soul was stamped on it, like the brand of a white-hot iron.
It was lovely.
Then she closed her eyes again and slept.
Eileen threw back the covers. bare feet were bruised, and soiled with a thick black dirt.
Like coal dust.
Gently, Eileen covered her sister and tip'toed from the She had to get out into the air, out and walk in the ai^nshine.
She couldnot talk to her mother or father or little bn^er about diis ev»increasing fear tliat was seeping into her bones.
She left die house and walked quickly, takii^ breaths, As she reached main street she saw little groups of people standing about, talking excitedly.
Only one or two of the stor^ had opened as yet, but there were more people on the sidewalks than was usual at notm.
They nodded a good morning to Eileen as she passed, then turned to r«ume their fevered discussion.
In front of the drug store there was a larger group.
Eileen stopped and edged into the fringe around an old woman who was talking in a hi^ thin cackle, and holding her listeners spell-bound.
The first sentence Eileen heard made her heart ^and still.
"Bewitched I Yes!
You donot believe it, heh But you must believe now.
I remember, sixty years «^o, when Leadville was bewitched. things happened and men dropped dead at their work.
The whole town soon frit the curse.
Men were afraid to work and they couldnot get any money.
When they found the witeh they burned her.
Then they could work again.
Blairfield is bewitched.
No man will set foot in that haunted shaft.
Blarrfield is doomed!"
“Doomed?'
A bystander echoed the word stupidly.
“Yes, ckiomed— 'to waste and die.
Doomed, unless you find the witch."
Eileen caught her lip between her teeth to stifle a cry, and walked quickly away.
As she walked the words kept echoing in her mind.
“Find the witch.
Find the witch The people of Blairfield were simple, close to the soil.
Many of them were only one generation removed from the peasants of an old eoimtry whose lor© was woven around strange tales of Little Folk and fairies and leprechauns, handed down from the time of the so strongly a part of their consciousness that centuries of Christianity could not eradicate it.
None among them would deny in his own heart that certain families had a banshee, an evil spirit that wailed outside the house three nighls running whei a member of that family was marked for death.
They prayed to God, Imt over their shoulders their eyes were peeled and their ears attuned to another groups of spirits that recognized neither God nor man.
Dancers la the Forest family was seated at the dinner table that night waiting for the head of the house to come home. eyes kept straying across the taide to study the face of her sister Nancy.
Mrs. Gannon looked tired and nervous, and little ten year old Neil was chattering aboirt the topic that was the paramount subject of conversation in every home in Blairfield.
“Haunted!" little Neil piped, his eyes round.
“The mine’s haunted and nobody dasnot go near it.
The ghost will strike tlrem down dead."
“Neil!" voice was not quite steady. go around repeating such nonsei'ise.
Cackling old women txy to explain everything by blaming it cm the spirits.
You wait until Dad comes home and ask him."
"But they do say that, all over town,” Mrs. Gantion offered. not just the old women. the men, too.
The young men.
Johnny O’Marra was one who saw the apparition and he’s not a kd to be easily frightened.”
“Boyl" Neil exploded.
“Johnny O’Marra yanks out his gun and hang!
The old ghost—’’ “Neil, stop, please,” Eileen cut him short.
Her eyes probed face for the barest sign of a reaction.
She even engaged glance, switched to look at right shoulder, then back meaningfully to her sister’s face.
But the play of glances seemed to mean nothing to Nancy.
She just sat tlaere, her small face in repose, her large eyes, that slanted up a bit at the outer edges, dark blue pools of innocence.
Paddy Gannon came into the house with a bang of the door and a noisy clump of his big boots.
He marched through the diningroom to wash at the kitchen sink.
Through the splash of the water his voice carried through to the family in the next room.
"Mary, you get ready and get Neil ready to take the eight o’clock train for Reading in the morning. going to stay with your sister for a few days.” that, Paddy?”
Mary Gannon asked in a startled voice.
“Aw, gee.
Dad,” Neil protested. wanna stay here and see what happens about the ghost “Oh, you do Mr. Gannon stamped in and took his place at the head of the table. going to Reading with your mother, young one.
And hear no more of your lip.”
He turned to his wife, get ready.
This is no place for kids or women with weak hearts.
Do you know what the whole town’s talking about saying the mine is haunted. the spirits who are to blame for the trouble. show them who’s to blame They wonot go near the shaft ^and you know what that means.
Starvation that will come so quick we wonot have the strength to pull ourselves out of the way to die.
Haunted it may be, by all the evil spirits in hell, but we’ll work it just the same.
And there will be bad days.
So you and Neil go stay with your sister.”
"Why canot we all go?”
Mrs. Gannon asked plaintively. nothing here now but a bare living, made by sneaking out coal in the dead of night.
Trouble, all the time.
Secret societies and wearing white bands on your arms so you wonot shoot down your neighbor. not ever coming back, Paddy.
Blairfield is “Cackling like the old wives in the village, eh Gannon barked.
“Do as I say.
Eileen and Nancy can look after me and the house, and look after the mine, haunted or not.
Serve the food, Mary,” was a tension, a harsh discordant note that seemed to vibrate in the air, imlike the usual harmonious home life of the Mrs. Gannon looked scared, and her hands trembled visibly.
Even little Neil appeared to sense the change the sinister feeling of foreboding that hung in the room like a fog.
His strident young voice was dropped to a hushed whisper.
As Eileen studied the guikless smile on her younger sister’s face a cold chill raced down her spine, and the small hair prickled on the back of her neck.
It was Nancy, not the talk of the haunted mine, who had by some strange means deliberately charged the air with an ominous portent and she was enjoying the result.
Her smile said so.
“Nancy Eileen called sharply, look like that.
Stop it Nancy looked at her sister and smiled even more sweetly.
Eileen clenched her hands until the fingers were numb, and shut her mouth tight.
She mustnot let this wild spirit of discord that suddenly permeated the house draw her into its whirlpool.
Why did Nancy delight in making people afraid?
Eileen excused herself and went into the kitchen.
It seemed that smile had a slightly derisive quality as she watched her sister leave the room.
That evenhig Paul Savage came to call.
Mrs. Gannon was upstairs with Neil, getting ready for their visit to Reading.
Mr. Ganncwi had gone out, wearing the white brassard of tlie Silents on his arm.
Nancy was sitting on the front steps, watching a full moon come up to paint the countryside with quid<»tlver.
Paul and Eileen sat side by side in the living room.
Paul covered the girl's hand with his.
“Eileen, wlqr do you keep putting me off?
Is it of O'Marra?"
“My mind is filled with other things, Paul.
Terrible, disturbing things.
Some baleful influence seems to have settled over all of ns.” know," Paul said. heard the talk that’s going on around town.
That the mine is haunted, and all that rot.
But it’s dangerous talk, more powerful than any sensible propaganda.
We know there arenot any ghosts in that shaft, but as long as people think so you’ll get no sense out of them.
Anything is apt to result from a wild story like that.
I even went down the shaft myself, looking for tlw ghost.”
“But nobody can prove it isnot haunted,” Eileen said. know I shouldnot believe those fantastic stories, but there are a numbo’ of things I donot want to believe. been fighting them off, rejecting them- as impossible, but they persist and terribly worried.
I canot even tell you, Paul, what tliey are.”
“It would be better if you did,” Paul coaxed gently.
Eileen shook her head and ttiey sat for a moment or two in silence, holding hands.
The girl started suddenly, and a dliill tremor ran through her frame.
Prom somewhere outside came a weird half human cry, a wail that lingered like the echo of a soul in torment. fingers locked around hand.
“What what was that?”
“Some dog baying at the full moon,” Paul smiled.
“No.”
Eileen turned a tense face toward Paul.
“No.
I heard it last night, too.
Just Hl« that.
Paul, got to tell somebody She jumped to her feet.
Nancy?”
“She was outside, sitting on the front steps admiring the full moon,” Paul said. guess she's still there.”
Eileen ran for the front door and flung it open.
The moon drenched the oountiyside with a wan mysterious light.
The front steps were carpeted in its glow but they were empty.
Nancy was not out there.
Eileen stood by the door and called several times.
Paul came out and stood by her side.
Suddenly she turned to him.
“Paul, we must find her She seized his lapels with both hands.
“We must find Nancy.”
“But where did she go?”
Paul asked.
“Where will we look?"
Eileen started down the steps, digging Paul after her by the hand.
^'Come, quickly. got to find her.
Paul, where does old Seamus O’Calahan live?
You know, the strange hermit in the woods, beyond the ridge some place.”
Paul said.
“But you donot tliink Nancy would be there, do you “Oh, I donot know but let’s try.
If you only knew what afraid of. stumbled through the woods, climbing the slope to the ridge where old Seamus O’Calahan was believed to live in a cave.
The bright moon made their path easy to find, but haste made her feet unsteady.
At the end of twenty minutes she paused to get her breadi and leaned weakly against Paul Savage.
Nancy, Paul, dear.
I canot even tlxink of you until I find out what’s wrong with her.”
Paul patted her shoulder understandingly. help all I can, darling.”
A little farther on they came to a clearing, the grass silvered like the surface of a lake by the moonlight.
Paul seized hand, held her fast.
“Look Eileen stood there by side in the sliadow of the rim of trees, and blinked her eyes unbelievingly at what slie saw in the clearing.
Old Seamus O'Calahan was standing straight as a graven image in the center of the clearing, the moon making his long white beard a cascade of silver.
Two figures danced around him in a wide circle, one following the motions and gyrations of the other.
Both figures were snow white.
One was a beautiful young girl, nude as a nymph of tiae forest.
The other was a great white goat.
The goat was dancing on its hind legs, pawing with its front l^s as a dancer keeps the rhythm with his hands and arms.
“Nancy!” voice was a choked whisper.
“Yes,” Paul said slowly.
“Nancy.”
Eileen started forward but he held her back.
“Wait,” he said. marvelous, barbaric ^beautiful Eileen tried to break away from him.
“Paul, are you crazy, too? my sister Nancy dancing out there naked in the moonlight dancing with a goat in front of a crazy old man.
Paul, got to stop her.”
“Wait.”
Paul held her, his eyes gripped by the strange sight.
Graceful as birds on the wing, smooth and supple as fish gliding in water, the goat and the girl danced in a smaller circle each time, closing in around the still, erect figure of the old man with the silver hair and beard.
As they watched a strange music seemed to come from nowhere, a lovely pulsing rhythm that was part of the dance and the moonlight, barely audible, Faint but clearly defined.
“Paul!”
Eileen begged.
“Let me stop her. let her do that mad pagan dance there without any clothes in the moonlight.”
Reluctantly Paul walked by side as they left the fringe of trees and started across the clearing.
Old Seamus O’Calahan unfolded his arms and clapped his hands once.
The faint music stopped.
The great white goat dropped to all fours and trotted off int# the woods.
Nancy stood there, unashamed in her natural state, and watched them approach.
Eileen stood before her sister, probing her face.
Nancy smiled.
"It was beautiful,” she said. it beautiful?”
"Where are your clothes?”
Eileen demanded.
“Qothes?
Oh, yes.”
Nancy walked, straight and poised as a yoimg goddess, to the edge of the wood where her clothes lay in a heap.
Paul Savage, his eyes still filled with the wonder and beauty of it, touched old Seamus O’Calahzm on the arm.
“The music— where was it coming from The old white-bearded man spread his arms.
“It is always there, all around us.
It only grows louder when we need it.”
Eileen, holding her sister by the hand, was calling, “Paul, hurry. go home, please.”
Paul joined the two sisters and they started off through the woods in the direction of home.
Eileen was sobbing audibly.
Nancy was walking proudly, gracefully.
Once, at a tight comer of the path, Nancy turned her head and looked up at Paid.
She smiled sweetly, the moonlight showing every contour of her lovely young face.
It was like a child’s, no more self-consdous than when he had seen her doing the naked pagan dance a short time l>ack.
Paul looked back over his shoulder.
The clearing was still there, like a pool in the moonlight.
But the old man with the silver hair and beard was gone.
Gone, too, was the great white dancing goat.
But a dark figure appeared at the far edge of the clearhig.
A man was cutting across the edge of the clearing toward the deme woods.
The moon was so bright Patd had no difficulty John burly figure with its characteristic truculent stride.
“Now did that bird come from Paul asked himself.
"Was he hiding at the far side of ffie clearing all ffie time Nancy was dancing He must have been.
Why should he hide, and sneak away after I think it’s about time I told Eileen a few things I know about that lad."
“Hurry, Paul, please," Eileen called from down the path. frightened." turned and hurried to catch up with the two sisters.
They were almost home when a noise on the path behind them made Paul turn to look.
Coming toward them, plainly visible in the light of the moon, was an old woman.
She moved quickly despite her hunched shoxdders and bent frame.
A grey shawl with bng fringe covered her head and the upper half of her body.
As she approached made a cackling noise and strudc the ground before her with her cane.
As the path was narrow and the old woman evidently in a hurry Paul stood aside to let her pass.
The old woman passed him without a glance and stamped up even with Nancy and Eileen.
“Ha Her shrill tackle awoke echoes in the wood.
"The Her bony finger was extended toward Nancy, almost toucliing the girl’s face with its hooked nail.
Nancy stopped walking and looked at the crone with a half-pitying expression.
Eileen pushed the! old woman away.
“Go away, you crazy old idiot. ever call my sister that name!"
“She is.
She Is!"
The old woman beat the ground with her stick. was there at her birth.
Your mother knows she is a cfangeling.
I have smi her with Old Seamus O’Calaban, laughing at tragedy, sitting on headstones in the graveyard- I saw her tonight when she danced with the goat in front of that old he-witch, Seamus O’Calahan. no cliild born of woman.
And faring bad luck and sudden death to them as lives with her and are dose to her."
Savage took some money from his pocket and pressed it into the old woman’s hand., “You didnot see a thing.
Take this and get good and drunk and have yourself some more hallucinations."
She closed her bony talons over the money, held it close to her face to look, then shuffled off, bobbing her head.
Paul turned to the two girls. wait a little while and let her get a start Half crazy, lialf drunk.
You mustnot feel hurt at what she said, Nancy." was just thinking," Nancy said softly.
“How odd and tlirilling it would be to find out one was a diangeling.
Not the cliild of mortal woman, but an ageless spirit that comes back to the earth every century or so."
“Stop it Nancy!" voice was hoarse. talk like that. being silly. the natural daughter of your mother and mine. my very own sister and I wonot have any crazy old hag calling you things like that."
From far up the path, as if she had heard, came the old crone's voice, crying out in a brittle caclde, “Changeling Changdingt” Cdl of the Bandiee residents of Blairfield were frightened.
Something had happened to call a curse down upon them that was unanimously agreed. mine tlmt pirt food in their mouths and clothes on their backs was haunted ^bewitched.
The curse was reaching out to envelop them all.
Soon the pinch of want would be added to the vague apprehension of the curse of the mine.
No more trucks rolled at night.
Paddy Gannon talked himself hoarse at a meeting of the Silents but not one man among them would join him to enter the shaft.
Not even Johnny O’Marra.
For Johnny had seen the specter with his own eyes.
The women folk backed their men. go near that shaft, ’Tis cursed, and be sure of that And an old crone, leaning on a crooked stick and holding her fringed shawl around her bent shoulders with taloned bands, shuffled up and down the street, stopped at stores and houses.
Everywhere she cackled the same awesome story.
There was a changeling in their midst A thing in human form, not a child of woman, but a creature of the spirit world, walked among them daily.
Posing as Paddy own daughter, it was.
But no natural daughter at all, at all.
A changeling Paddy Gannon heard the gossip and took his pretty daughter by the hand.
He brought Nancy around to Father house and held his broad thumb on the priest’s bell imtil an aged housekeeper opened the door.
“Is His Reverence in?”
Gannon demanded. like to see him, if he is.”
“Yes.”
The old housekeeper was hesitant. donot know see me, sure.”
Gannon pushed in, still holding Nancy by the hand.
He walked into the hall and a gentle voice called from the front room.
“In here, Paddy Gannon.”
The shades were drawn and the room was in darkness.
Gannon halted on the threshold.
“Are you in the dark, Father?” afraid I am, Paddy Gannon,” Father Doyle said gently. few hours ago I lost the sight of my eyes.
Dr. Akers was here and will be back.
There seems to be no reason for it.
But I am blind.
Enough of that, then.
Can I do something for you “Blind?”
Paddy booming voice dropped to a whisper.
“God preserve your eyes, Father.
But brought my daughter, Nancy. a cruel rumor going around.
The people are saying my daughter here is a changeling.
What can we do to stop this terrible talk?”
“Come here, my child,” Father Doyle said.
“Can you see me in the dark?
Give me your hand.
There.
You arenot going to let this cruel talk make you bitter or envious are you Because we know there is no such thing.
There is only one Spirit, and that a benevolent Only man is cruel and wicked.”
“Oh, I donot mind.
Father," Nancy said sweetly. think it would be thrilling to be a spirit, not bound by the shackles of this earth.”
"All youth feels tlmt way, my child,” the priest said.
“Now go outside, please.
I want a word with your father.”
After a moment the priest asked, “Has she left the room, Paddy Gannon?”
“Yes, Father.”
“She moves so lightly one might well believe her to be a spirit,” Father Doyle said with a smile in his voice.
“Send her away, Paddy Gannon, to a good convent some place in the country where live and growing things aboimd.
The good Sisters will know what to do to shape that nimble mind without breaking her spirit.
But send her away, because these good people of Blairfield can be very cruel.” word went aroimd that Paddy Gannon had taken his daughter Nancy to see the priest, to have Father Doyle drive out the devil that possessed her.
But before he got there Father Doyle had gone blind The Devil had closed the eyes of God Even on the street now, people talked in awed whispers.
Nancy Gannon walked down the main street and people stopped, as if turned to stone, at her approach.
Mothers pulled their little children out of the way as if the devil htmsdf was abroad.
Even the seemed to sense the fearful isolation, and slunk out of her way.
In the old days, they told each other, she would have been driven out of town as a witch.
Maybe even burned of it had no effect on Nancy.
She walked as if in a world of her own, and her very manner of goit^ whipped tlie people mto a frenzy of hate.
She was no real daughter of Paddy and Mary Gannon.
She was a child of the devil and the curse that held Blairfield in its grasp was her doing.
Nancy went her way, smiling sweetly, a faraway look on her lovely elfin face.
Eileen Gannon was tearful and more than a little frightened as -she talked to Paul Savage.
“What can I do, Paul The whole town is calling Nancy a spawn of some evil spirit" “Vicious, stupid peasants!"
Paul growled.
“But, Paul," Eileen stammered.
“She does such ttrat^e things you can hardly Uame them.
She sneaks out at night and meets Seamus O’Calahan.
She was there when the cave-in killed Eddie Dwyer.
The night the ghost was seen in the shaft and Joe Dixon fell to his death, she was gone all night and in the morniag her feet were bruised and black and she had a strange wound in her shoulder.
Maybe this crazy old man has something to do with these awful events.
Maybp he is influencing Nancy to do things that are connected in some way with these tragedies."
“Seamus O’Calahan is a bit cradeed," Paul told her.
“But he’s not the one to bring the tremble that holds this community in its grip right now. a theory of my own.
And donot worry about Nancy. a rare and lovely creature.
Sucli grace and beauty -to be bom and reared in Blairfield “Stop it!"
Eileen screamed.
“Ever since you saw her dancing, naked in the moonlight, you’ve done nothing but stare at her and follow her with your eyes. it bad enough that my own sister is bewitched, but you have to fall under her spell “Eileen, you’re hysterical. show you “Please go!”
Eileen begged. canot stand any more. come back, ever.
You you too, are coming under the spell.
I can see it, feel it.
Go, for keeps and forever.
First she ^bewitched John O’Marra now it’s you!"
“You need a little rest,’’ Paul said. see you tomorrow."
“No Eileen slammed the door beloind him and leaned we^ng against the wall.
“Never come back.
There wonot be any tomorrow.”
Paddy Gannon was talking to a group of grim-faced naen at a meeting of the He was using strong words in a strong voice.
Were they going to sit down and wait for starvation?
Were they going to let their wives and kids starve with good coal ready for the pick, because some old crones had said there was a curse on the mine? going in there tonight!" he shouted.
“And going to get coal.
And if there’s a man amot^g you with the guts of a louse, hell go with me and the rest of you can stay home and tell your beads and starve like rats When he climbed the hill a little later fifteen men were Ijehind him.
Others were getting the trucks still others carried rifles and side-arms to stand guard while the shift worked. stood in her room with her back to the door and watched her sister Nancy get r^dy for bed.
When the younger girl had retired Eileen turned the key in the door and began to undress. going to sleep beside me, arenot you, Eiken Nancy asked.
“Yes, of course.”
Eileen tried to keep her voice steady.
“Why not everyone else is afraid of me.
Everyone in the world.
Mother took Neil away and father wonot stay in the house.
The people in town draw away from me ^but you arenot the least bit frightened, are you?”
“Of com-se not.”
Eileen was trembling.
She got into bed and reached out to extinguish the bed light, but halted her hand.
“It is strange, to see fear on people’s faces,” Nancy said.
“It gives one an exultant What would make you twist your face in fear, Eileen?”
The younger sister moved close and looked into eyes.
Eileen steded herself against showing any emotion.
She tried to smile at her sister.
Suddenly there came the weird, half-human cry she had heard on tlie two previous nights.
It seemed to oome from the >'ard, outside the house.
Its gliastly timbre swmed to run up and down her spine like needles as it climbed the register to a wail of torment.
She sat bolt upright in bed. that?"
Nancy laughed gleefully, “Your eyes showed fear, stark uncontrollable fear.
Your naked terrified soul was in your eyes, the way a person looks when death stares them in the face.
It is marvelous, thrilling."
She edged close to Eileen.
“Soon I shall see that look in your eyes again.
I know it soon.”
“But tliat ^oise,” Eileen muttered.
“That dreadful sound!”
Ihe banshee,” Nancy shrilled. nights it has wailed.
And that means death!”
She bounded oat of bed and stood on her bare toes as if poised for flight.
Her head was thrown hack, her eyes alight with rapture.
“The Eileen covered her face with her hands, then by sheer force of will pulled them away and looked at the weird tableau of her sister standing with outstretched arms, head thrown back.
For a split second it looked to Eileen as if a huge white bat, wings spread, stood there instead of Nancy.
Resolutely she got out of bed and approached Nancy.
“Go back to bed, Nancy. hysterical,” But sfie couldnot keep her voice levd and the nerves in her body tingled so that she walked jerkily.
Nancy lowered her Iiead and stared -at her sister, then, as Eileen drew close arms came out toward her, went around shoulders.
Tense and shaken, Eileen went a little limp.
As she sagged she felt fingers slide up and close around her throat.
Through a haze she heard voice. have heard the banshee call.
I must go.
When Eileen recovered from her faint Nancy was gone.
Death ia a Nymph responded at once to frantic call.
As he drew up to the front of the house in his small car Eileen was standing on the porch.
She ran down the steps and seized arm in her two hands.
“Nancy has gone again.
We must find her!”
“Do you know where she went?”
“No.
But let’s try the mine.
Paul, she acted like a mad persott.
We must find her and bring her back.”
“All right.”
Paul started the car.
“But it’s dangerous to be sneaking around the mine at this hour of the night.
The men are working up there and they’ll shoot on sight.” know it,” Eileen said in hushed tones.
“She only had her nightgown on.
If she goes up there they might think it has something to do with the ghost that is supposed to be haunting it.
They might kill her in the darkness before they see who it is.
Hurry, please.
You know how excited they all are.”
“Right.”
Paul Savage guided his car out of the village and up the hill to the dark shaft of the Blairfield mine.
He took a short cut over a bumpy road as they neared the top of the rise.
As they bounced around a curve his headlights picked out something that flashed white in the darkness.
He stood on his brakes.
“What was that?”
“It was Nancy,” Eileen gasped. sure it was.
Over there by that wooden shack.”
Paul Savage took a flashlight from the pocket of the car and got out.
“Come on,” he told Eileen.
“That shack is an air vent to number one tunnel. soon see if that was Nancy.”
The two left the car and ran across the field to the little wooden shack.
It was unlocked and Paul directed the beam of his flashlight inside as he swung the door open.
The grating that covered the hole inside was leaning against the wooden side of the little shanty. tell me,” Paul said slowly.
“She couldnot have gone down that vent “She must have!”
Eileen insisted. saw her come in here.”
Paid knelt and played his light down the vent, a hole about four feet in diameter, roughly shored with heavy planking.
“There are footholds in this thing,” he said.
“But I still canot imagine “She went down there!”
Eileen insisted. gone down there where the men are working. see her white nightgown in the dark and shoot her.
Paul, we’ve got to go down and find her.” another one they donot want around here,” Paul said ruefully. think I was spying for the company and give me the business but here goes. go down first and give you a light.”
He switched tlie light off and let himself down the vent, feeling with hands and feet for the iron footholds that had been driven into the shoring.
The vent sloped off around hard rock and was narrower at that point.
Then it widened again.
Eventually his feet struck hard surface.
He flashed his light again and saw that he was n^r the end of a tunnel.
Above him he could hear progress down the vent shaft.
He played the light for her and the two of them stood in the tunnel, black as the coal it sired, except for flashlight.
“She must have gone this way,” Paul said.
“Come on,” was a narrow gauge track along the floor of the tunnel and the footing was imcertain so Paul kept the light on the ground before them.
They approached a bay and Paul stopped suddenly.
"Did you hear flut noise?”
“Yes.
What was h?” voice was a hushed whisper.
"The men are working number three vein, the next below on this shaft,” Paul told her. about one hundred and fifty feet down.
The vein below that is flooded because the pump hasnot been kept going.
They must have stopped working, because the lift bucket isnot moving.”
“But that noise,” Eileen repeated.
“It seemed to come from right ahead in the tunnel.” know,” Paul said.
“And nobody is working up on this level.
Maybe it’s Nancy.
Come on.”
He led her out to the bay and around the shaft.
There was no indication that a score of men were working right below them.
The vein ran off at a tangent on the other side of the bay.
Eileen stuck close to Paul and walked with one hand extended, touching his back.
“It smells very unpleasantly/' she said.
“Almost gagging.”
“They are working without the exhaust blowers to dean out the foul air,” Paul told her.
“Clean air comes down the shaft but even at best it’s hard to exhaust the had air.
These men are taking chances but it’s diat or starve, that’s why my sympathies He stopped talking and his frame stiffened.
Standing bdiind him with her hand touching his back, Eileen knew from his abrupt tenseness that they had suddenly come upon something in that dark underground tunnel.
He stood there with the light directed straight in front of him.
Eileen moved so she could see around him.
He tried to stop her by an upfiung arm, but she had already seen.
Propped tip against the wall of the vein in a half sitting posture was big Paddy Gannon, father.
He was still as the black-hewn wall behind him and his eyes were wide open and staring staring up at them.
Paul held the light on the man, sitting there so limp and like a collapsed figure in a wax museum.
“Dad Eileen was on her knees before him. happened? wrong?”
“Hold the light.”
Paul gave the girl the flashlight and moved her gently to one side.
He knelt beside the slumped form of big Paddy Gannon, and felt for a pulse.
Then he placed liis ear against chest and listened for a heartbeat.
But he knew from the touch of him that Gannon was dead.
His flesh was already cold clay, although rigor mortis had not yet set in.
He put bis hand behind shoulders in an effort to straighten the grotesque figure.
His hand felt something wet and sticky.
As he pulled it away and looked at it in the flashlight’s beam he saw it was covered with blood.
Eileen saw it too.
She let out a pitiful litde cry and dropped the light.
Paul turned quickly and reached for her in the dark to catch her as she fell.
She went limp in his arms.
Gently, he lowered her to the ground and began to fumble around for the flashlight, but it dudcd his groping fingers.
Paul straightened up and his fingers were unsteady as he probed his pockets for matches.
There was no warning sound, but suddenly a light seemed to flash at the back of his head.
The darkness spun before liim in a dizzy cone.
He could feel hhnsdf falling, losing consciousness.
It was as If the roof of the vein had fallen in on him.
As he slipped into oblivion his last thought was, “So this is what a cave-in is like. regained her senses slowly.
Size was coughing and gagging and the darkness was around her like a tiiick black blanket.
She began to stru^le to her feet as she remembered the events just before she had fainted.
She was in the coal vein with Paul, looking for Nancy and they had found her father, dead.
And there had been blood on hand as he pulled it away from her father’s body.
She snapped alert.
Utter and complete silence esaept for the regular drip of water somewhere.
“Paul!”
She callal quietly at first.
Then, as the only response was the choked-off echo of her own frightened voice, she called again, louder.
Still no response and she screamed his name again and again, only to have it beat back at her like the mocking taunt of a hundred fiends hidden in the blackness.
Her head turned, first one way, then another, trying to make out some object.
In one direction she thought she caught the flicker of a light.
She stumbled over the rough floor of the tunnel toward the gleam of l^ht.
The narrow-gauge track tore one shoe off but she stumbled on, unheeding.
The tunnel made a turn and her hands fumbled along the rocky wall, following it.
Then she came upon the light.
And she stood, frozen with horror, her senses refusing to accept the scene.
Standing in the middle of the tunnel was her sister Nancy, still clad only in her white nightgown.
Nancy was holding a coal oil torch in her left hand, holding it aloft so its yellowish flame licked at the roof of the vein.
And in her right hand Nancy gripped a long knife and its bright blade was smeared red with blood “Nancy Nancy came toward her sister slowly, holding the torch out before her.
In its dancing light Eileen could see face plainly.
It had a strange expression, one of almost childish delight.
And her voice, when she spoke, was like the pleased gurgle of a little girl.
“Ah, you are afraid.
I can see it now.
Your face is all knotted and your eyes they stare so.
They stare like my father’s eyes stared when he knew he was dying.
All life is dull until the moment of death.
Then comes the thrill the only real thrill in the world.
The thrill of meeting death Eileen tried to speak but her tongue was numb.
She tried to pray, but her mind was in the throes of a terrible agony that blotted out all reason.
“Nancy is mad!”
Voices shrieking inside her said.
“She is not your sister.
She is a fiend incarnate.
She killed your father with that awful gleaming, red-smeared knife.
She can kill because she has no soul.
She is a fiend and now she is going to kill you.
She is going to plunge that knife, still smeared with your father’s blood, into you.
Just so she can see your eyes when you die!”
Her knees gave way and she knelt helplessly before the slim young girl who smiled like a child but held a murderous knife upraised. pray, Eileen,” Nancy said softly.
“It will do no good.
I do not like prayers.
They are the meanings of weak mortals.
Maybe, when you die, you will become a spirit, as I am a spirit.
You will be happier.” face took on the reddish glow of the torch and the crimson smear on the bright knife seemed reflected in her eyes.
She moved closer.
Eileen tried to shut her eyes but a strange fascination held them wide and staring.
Before their terrified stare figure appeared to float toward her like a wraith a murderous specter, red-stained with human gore.
Hell Underground struggled back to consciousness with the strange feeling that somebody was calling his name, far off.
His head vibrated with pain and when he touched the back of it with his fingers he felt a large swelling, cut across the top.
He remembered thinking he had been struck by a cave-in, but he was not hemmed in by rock or soil.
He felt about him in the pitch blackness, then called name.
There was no answer.
His head spun and breathing was difficult.
Standing erect Paul braced himself and took a deep breath.
Smoke The unmistakable pungent smell of smoke permeated the foul air of the vein tunnel.
In the blackness it was even more terrifying.
It rolled about him until he thought he could see it in the dark; he could taste its oily yellow stench and feel his aching eyes smart with it.
Eileen was somewhere in that tunnel.
She had been lying there in a faint when the blow he believed to be a cave-in had felled him.
Scrambling, liolding small paper matches in his fingers, he found the fiashliglrt.
Eileen was gone.
Tlie crumpled form of Paddy Gannon was there, eyes still wide and staring, but the girl was gone.
The flashlight showed drifting, slow coiling clouds of smoke.
Somewhere in the iilfated shaft there was a fire.
Calling the girl’s name Paul hurried toward the far end of the vein tumiel.
Ahead was a curve and beyond it voices.
He rounded the curve and came upon a scene like a picture of an ancient human sacrifice.
Eileen knelt, head bowed on the floor of tlie tunnel.
Before her, holding the torch and die uplifted knife, was Nancy.
The expression on face was sheer rapture.
She was staring at face with a gleeful concentration.
She did not look up at arrival.
He started to shout, tlien checked himself.
Nancy in this mood was dangerous.
The knife in her hand was red with blood.
“Put down the knife, Nancy," he said quietly. must go.
The shaft is on fire.
It is burning and we must go.”
Nan(^ took a backward step.
“Fire!
Beautiful red flames, lighting the frightened faces of men -inen trapped by fire “Fire is more beautiful than the knife," Paul stalled, inching close.
“Give me the knife, Nancy.
We will go and watch the fire.”
The yellow smoke was getting dense in the close tunnel, seeping in, closing around them like fog.
Nancy started to hand Paul the knife.
A voice behind him snarled: “Give it to him point first!
Plunge it in his throat, Nancy.
Watch his eyes as he dies!”
Paul whirled to see John O’Marra, standing in the tunnel right behind a flashlight in his left liand and a club in his right.
By the light of torch Paul could see the murderous light in dark eyes.
Paul swung his arm quicldy and threw his own flashl^ht.
John O’Marra was too close to duck, but hie right hand swung the dub just as the flashlight struck him between the eyes.
Paul dived and lodced both hands around John O'Marfa 's right wrist was trying weakly to get to her feet The smoke was Winding and gagging her.
The torch Nancy held was losing its glare in a pall of creeping smoke.
Paul hunched his shoulders and held O’Marra with botli arms while Jolin hammered his face and head witfi his free hand. head came down and he dosed his jaws on right wrist.
He bit down until he felt flesh give, felt the bone in his teeth, John O’Marra gave a scream of agony and tried to free his arm.
He let go of the club and thrashed around like a wounded tiger.
Paul could taste warm blood in his mouth.
Suddenly he unclenched his jaws and smashed with both hands at the face writhing before him in the smoke.
As John O’Marra went down, Paul drove his heel in his face, kicked him savagely, ruthlessly until the man went limp on the ground.
“Eileen "Yes."
The girf's answer was a choked sob.
“The fire is in the shaft.
We must go through it to reach the vent we came in by.
Give me your hand."
Nancy suddenly came to life at the word fire.
She darted past them, holding the torch aloft.
She disappeared down the tunnel and around the curve.
Paul tied his handkerchief around nose and mouth and began to lead her back along the tunnel.
Near the bay where the main shaft went down, the smoke was thickest.
The fire was dovm below, where the men were working, but the lift bucket seemed out of order.
Its cable was silent.
Only blackness and the oily smoke showed in the beam of light.
A down draft at the main shaft forced the smoke out in smothering billows and drove it along the vein.
Paul held his breath, gripped hand and pulled her after him. eyes were almost blinded and his lungs were bursting when the opening of the vent showed in his flashlight’s beam.
He pushed Eileen up the crude ascent.
She was so weak he had to support her weight on his shoulders at each step.
The air became clearer.
He could breathe.
Climbing, fighting for breath, they made the surface, toppled out of the little wooden shack and fell forward on the ground, side by side.
“Burn the Witchl” a flash of lightning word hit Blairfield.
Lights went on in houses as the awful news was shouted from one to the other.
“Trouble at the mine!”
The curse had struck again at the little band of men who had defied it to scratch a little coal from the bowels of the earth.
On foot and in tinny old cars, the frantic parade wound up the hill to the mine.
Torches flared and the crowd gathered.
They could not go too close, for foul black smoke rolled in great billows from the mouth of the shaft.
Fire!
Some of the men who had been working on the shift gasped out the story.
Without warning the first stench of smoke had smitten them.
Without the usual precautions, it was every man for himself, with no facilities for fighting the fire or even determining the source.
The men on the second level were suffocated before they could claw their way to freedom.
Some got up in the bucket, but the vengeful yellow and black smoke drove back all who tried to reach the others.
Ten men, trapped in that veritable hell, while their friends and families wailed and prayed and screamed outside the mouth of the shaft.
Somebody raised an agonized cry, “Look!”
Nancy Gannon and old Seamus O’Calahan stood on the rise to one side of the shaft.
Their forms and faces were plainly visible in the dancing torchlight.
The old man’s face was devoid of expression but the girl’s was registering sheer ecstasy.
“The changeling!”
“Her standing there, bubbling with joy, while her own father is in that pit of hell not her own father. no child of the world. the devil’s spawn and the cause of our grief a witch!”
The grief-maddened mob poured its emotion toward this fresh target.
The men and women began to call insults and threats.
Nancy turned toward them and smiled.
Somebody called.
“If we’d driven her out of town we’d have been spared this curse.”
“Drive her out now “Burn her.
Burn the witch Old Seamus O’Calahan stood between the girl and the onrushing mob, his arms outspread.
“No. harm the child. done no wrong The old man was trampled underfoot and great red stains showed on his silver beard in the jumping light of the torches as they swept him down to the ground.
The girl backed away, slowly at first, then she turned and began to run, throwir^ over her shoulder a look like a young doe in the forest being harried by a pack of dogs.
The part of the crowd that held back at first leaped in, their emotions whipped Gffil fey the ■chase.
They spread out, their torches ttraking crazy jumpiag flaxes ai they raa.
They c^ed blood-ctjrdltng threats and goaded themselves by shriel^ ing words of abuse.
The blood lust of the bust was upon them.
The pent-up fear and anger of days was finding its vent.
They closed in behind the rtmning fir], snarling like mad dogs and Eileen Gannon lay about two hundred yards from the mouth of the main shaft.
For some minutes their labored and tortured breathing was the only sound either uttered.
Then Paid ssid, “You all right, Eileen?”
“Yes,” she answered. feeling a little sick and my eyes burn.
Paul, I can^ understand it all.” been working on all this trouble at the mine,” Paul told her in gasping breaths.
"Old Seamus O'Calahan had nothing to do with any more than Nancy did.
I can explain it all to you if want to listen."
“Yes, yes.
But not now.
Wliat are they doing around the mouth of the shaft?
Why are they all running like that?”
“It must be the fire,” Paul said.
“There must be men trapped down there,” Nancy was running with mouth open now, her eyes staring wildly.
The mob snarling at her heels shrieked insane -exultation as her gait faltered.
Her fleet young legs were trembling, near exhaustion.
Ahead was a small clump of woods.
She ran, toward it.
The pursoing mob fatmed and scrambled after her.
She was trai^jod.
The litrie knoll ended in an ^rupt precipice with a sheer drop of more than a hundred feet.
She would have to stop at its edge.
Then they would get trer.
The torches moved down more slowly as the pursuers closed in.
They advanced oa the little fiogers of laud raised above the surpoanding terrain, the trap the huxu^d doe was too frightened to see.
They moved in relentlessly, right to the edge of the cliff.
A rabbit, a small, pure white rabbit, look«l at them with wide bewildered eyes.
But there was no sign of the girl.
It was as if she had disappeared from the face of the earth Eileen and Paul Savage searched the faces of the crowd, looking for Nancy.
People paid no attention to them.
No explanation of the chase was given.
They did not ask.
They just kept locdciag, half fearfully through the crowd.
Then somebody told Eileen that her father was one of those who had been trapped in the mine, probably smothered.
At the mention of her father’s name the horrible scene in the mine tunnel rushed back to flood tlie girl's senses.
She slipped to the ground in a dead faint.
When slie opened her eyes Paul had carried her back a little way from the crowd around the smoking shaft. been woridng on this thing for weeks,” he told her.
"It wonot make you feel any better, now that your father is gone, but the curse that had all these people frantic was a deliberate frame-up.
Johnny O’Marra had made a deal with a mob who wanted to take take over this mine and bootleg coal.
But they knew they'd never take it from the Blairfield crowd by force.
He framed this stuff, those accidents.
He used poor, strange Nancy, even started this fire.
But the fire got out of band.
I donot think he meant it to.
I guess he'll never come out now.” was afraid it was really bewitched," Eileen said.
“And I v'as afraid that Nancy and old Seamus O’Calahan had something to do with it.”
*He had nothing to do with it,” Paul told her, "And O’Marra just used Nancy.”
“Paul, do you think she killed Dad?”
Eileen whispered.
“No. sure O’Marra did it.
Your father must have discovered John was responsible for the dirty work.
Nancy must have come upon them just as he killed your father.
O’Marra knew Nancy was strange, so he gave her the knife to frighten us away.”
“But she looked so horrible,” Eileen insisted.
“She was going to kill me.” donot think so,” Paul said.
“She just wanted to see fear in your eyes. go home.
Nancy is probably there by now, calm as anyone.”
Nancy was not home when they got there.
She was never seen again.
The last anyone had seen of her was when she had fled, frightened before the mob, into that little patch of woods.
Three days later Eileen was getting ready to leave Blairfield for good.
She was coming out of a store in the village when an old woman stopped her.
The same old crone who had called Nancy a changeling.
The hag bobbed her head and cackled.
“Did you hear about Mrs. Downey Eileen shrank back, then asked civilly, “What about Mrs. Downey?” little white rabbit came out of the woods and hopped right into her kitchen It must have been good luck, because Mrs. Downey, childless these sixteen years, just had a baby girl.
And she not knowing or expecting one.
I was there when it was bom.
A pretty little girl with big blue eyes that slant up at the outside corners.” very nice, sure.”
Eileen hurried on to where Paul was waiting in his car. the matter?”
Paul asked.
"You look as if you’d just seen a ghost.” afraid if I stay here I will,” she said.
“Paul, drive as fast as you can, and as far as you can.
There are some things never be able to understand, and I donot think I want to and never, never talk to me about anything that happened here, just as long as I live.”
"Still brooding about Nancy?”
She gave him a long, searching look.
“No. stopped brooding about Nancy. hard to explain ^but Nancy is off my conscience now.
I donot feel that Pm responsible for her any more.”
Paul breathed a sigh of relief.
“Thank goodness that’s cleared up.”
Eileen shook her head.
“No.
It isnot, and it never will be.
But there are some things I donot want to understand and that’s one of them.”
Paul nodded.
“Amen.”
Bij Appel (Author of Attic of Terror," etc.) Sequestered in their swamp-land home, Ralph Payne and his beautiful young wife desired strong, comely children.
But that was before their splendid bodies began to turn into horrid travesties of human form which could never produce such offspring ometimes at night, when a high moon glints on the surface of that dark pool where first I encountered the shrinking death, doubt and terror cleave my brain with their dagger-strokes, and I despair of ever regaining my normal physique and health.
Sometimes in my sleep I seem to feel again the hideous torpidity of mind, the loathsome human fluidity of bone and muscle, that rendered me an inert jellyfish shrunken to the proportions of a child.
But science yet may save me.
We were celebrating my thirtieth birthday, here at the old Louisiana plantation where our family, the Paynes, have lived for a century past.
On every hand the grounds are guarded by a barrier of forbidding swamps through which a hard road leads to various plots of high land now cultivated by adsite tenants, oece tilled by my grandfatliw’s bkek slaves.
During the year since Grace and I were married the old manor house had been modernzed in varions ways, and foremost among improvements was a gleaming, white-tiled outdoor swimming pool designed to take the curse off torrid summer days.
When the scorching sus had drojqjed behind a surrounding wail of nmss-draped ej'press trees, Grace proposed a coding dip.

Doctor Hemerich Koop» made some small objection, socm we coaxed him into a bathing suit and led him to the brink of the inviting basin.
Grace ran to the end of the spring-board, her deli«tely molded form poised as lightly as a mocking bird’s upon a swaying bough.
Arcing through the air a clean dive that setrt drops sparkling upward^ she rose to the surface laughing and called "Come in I delightful Then, her face sobered as she floated there regarding the two of us with thoughtfrri eyes. the comparison she was msdfing vid knew the reason.
Doctor Koc^, whom I bad en^doyed, ostetsibly to manage a small hospital tq>on tfte jrfantation for the benefit of tenant families, but actually to safeguard the health of my bride, was one of her schoolday lovers- whose doglike devotion had endured through adolescent years.
As one of an adoring dozen she had given liis aspirations no serious thought until, with college behind Iiim and a profitable profession ahead, he proposed marriage and she told him it could not be.
With disarming candor she had confessed that wanted a husband whose physique would match her own bodily health and strei^tii; because she desir-ed numerous and there must be no heredity taints that might prevent tise growth of tall sons and love^ daughters. years numbered the same as mine, but I stood six feet two in my stoddngs and tipped the scales at two hundred weight.
He was a scrawny man of five feet four and a childhood injury had left his back huitthed.
Beneath his bulging brow dwelt a brain whose keenness mine probably never would attain, although I did enough at managing tlie estate.
Hemerich Koop also guessed the tenor of lier thoughts.

That meant a great deal to a young couple expecting to raise a family in tlie depths of a swamp forty miles from tlie nearest dty.
It more than that to me, five minutes latw, when a monstrous face was thrust out of a dump of shrubbery a few yards away and the idiot, Pedro, begaa smarling obscene Spanish oaths which frightened Grace into a fit of trembling hysteria.
Following a final g^st of vile curses Pedro hurled some curiously shaped object which splashed into the pool near where Grace dung to me.
Then he scuttled into the swamp before I could call a servant to catch him.
I held my wife in my arms, sitting upon a bench beneath the pergola, while Koop ran to the house for his small black bag.
Returning, he gave her a sedative.
Between us we strove to calm her fears, insisting that the outburst was meaningless, but still terrified she cried: “He has grown more boldl It has a dreadful meaning!
That old crone, Zell Mendez, is slowly goading him to the point of murder.
They mean to kill you, Ralph, because of the accident that crippled him.”
I laughed the idea aside, but even Hemerich dark-browed face betrayed deep concern.
Uneasily, he said “All the tenants talk of the threats Zell Mendez makes against you.
They fear her curses.
Superstitiously, they believe that she is in league with the devil.
Sometimes, I wonder.
Sorcerers have performed strange deeds which science cannot fathom.”
“For sake, Koop!”
I exclaimed.
“You donot mean that you believe in such twaddle He smiled, grimly.
“Not as witchcraft.
If that’s what you’re thinking.
But we live in a swamp, Ralph, and I must confess that some of the secrets of swamp herbs and poisons handed down from one generation of voodoo practitioners to another have not yet been solved by the medical profession.
Did you read, last spring, of the man in Bay St. Louis whose stature is slowly shrinking?
Who has been dwarfed to the size of a child from a height of six feet Not only is he said to be suffering from a curse, but similar cases have been recorded in Barbados and in Porto Rico.
It makes one wonder Angrily, I seized the bottle of brandy he had brought from the house and gulped a steadying drink.
Grace said, tearfully: “Why should she blame you, that old old witch, for an accident that was unavoidable Three people swore that Pedro Mendez darted out of the brush, squarely in front of your car “Forget it, dear,” I said, inwardly shuddering at the recollection of a stunning impact, the sickening crunch of flesh under heavy wheels, the screams of the stricken idiot when my speeding roadster felled him.
“Doctor Koop did everything pyossible for the poor fellow.
And neither curses, nor his mother’s, will mend his crooked legs nor harm us.”
Hemerich Koop was looking toward the glassy surface of the pool.
“What did he throw at you when he was swearing there? saw something queer splash see.”
Standing on the brink I scrutinized the white bottom, saw a small blue bottle lying in the deep end exuding an inky cloud.
“There it is. fetch it up.”
I dived.
The immersion cooled my excited blood instantly.
But, even as I enjoyed the pleasant sensation, blighting f«ir struck home.
Cooled met I felt chilled to the bone!
My limbs seemed frozen.
Neither arms nor legs would function.
In a state of complete paralysis I glided to the bottom.
The air in my lungs slowly raised me to the top but I hung face downward, helpless.
By no force of will could I command the movement of a single muscle.
When my tortured lungs rebelled and I could no longer forestall the gasp which filled them with water in a drowning flood, I heard shrill cry of alarm echo as from a great distance.
Then a Uack coma enfolded me. time which foibwed was marked hy vagufr peria^ of light and darkness.
I realised that I lay in a hospital bed, tiiat a and a nurse came and wet^ that I had sot drowned but was alive. and nights passed like a blur cd delirium, studded with moments of excruciating agony, broken by terrifying ta which tiie idiot’s face tft leer at me as I suffered there, while he gibbered of escape from pain through u3e of some drug contained in a small beetle ef hellish midn^ht blue.
At last, after an eternity o£ nameless terror, there came a ef clear consciousness, yet so weak had my strange illness left me that I could not raise my heavy eyelids and, perforce, without a sign of life lay listening to the voices of Doctor Koop and Grace.
“He is wasting away to death!”
My vrife’s anguished tone was sharp with grief.
“It is Zell curse I is doomed.
You cannot save him.’* “Now, now, my dear,” the doctor chided. give up hope so easily.
He lives!
And while there’s life there’s hope aplenty.
If only I could tell His voke thinned on a troubled note.
“Whedier this queer shrinkage is die restdt of a drug— or something, worse said that before There was near frenzy in cry “You, too, believe it is a curse That Zell Mendez has bewitched him “Nonsense!”
Koop snapped sharply.
“Of course it must be the work of a drug.
But, unfortunately, the small blue bottle which Pedro tlffew into the swimmmg pool had quite emptied itself brfoie I w»ent back to recorer it of water the tank produced: no- satisfactnry Tceidts because of great

“If Zell Mendez codd be forced to Despair edged my wife’s sweet voice. pl^ded with her, but riie only laughs, showing her yellow hag's teetli in a gloating snarl, calling down still more terrible oirses upon poor head.
Oh, will he ever be conscious again?

“Somehow you rau^; stop this horrible thing, Heuierich she exclaimed.
“At any cost.
Call in specialists to aid you, use every resource that money can buy, before it is too late.”
“My dear Grace,” Hemerich Koop said, “money wonot help, nor can any specialist, am doing my best to infiti«icfr the outcome of this peculiar sekure and no one could do more.”
His words cheered me as I lay there a motionless, helpless hulk, for I knew the keenness of his brain, his thoroughness in seeking the solution of difficulties.
If only he could contrive to ease the worries widi which Grace was besieged.
They left the room together.
I heard door open and close.
Then, for hours it seemed, I was plagued ly visions of vicious faces leering.
The tmwholesotne countenance of old Zell Meadez loomed above the foot of my bed, six^^g^e-toothed,. wild-eyed, stringy grey hair straggling across her leathv cheeka.
I the Bps mouthed venomous curses over and over, and never in life or death would she the accident that had cripfded her son. magltgnant visage tormeftted me after his mother’s dnsmed and faded.
A moron at best, he was and pimply.
His forehead sloped straight away in line with a long, pointed nose, and his chin receded obliquely to form a snouted face like a hog’s.
After my car had smashed his legs and left them but flopping clubs upon which he stumped about with the aid of two canes, appearance was enough to frighten women and children.
His witless tongue forever drolled profane obscenity.
Lying there in my torpid state, seeming to hear the foul threats he voiced, suddenly I was obsessed with fear for Grace.
What if the idiot sought to vent his spleen upon her?
Alone in our big house, save for black servants, she would prove easy prey for him.
The thought shocked me into wakefulness.
My eyes snapped open, they widened with consternation, and my jaw hung loose at sight of the ugly face peering through an open window near my bed.
I gasped.
"Is it you?
Did I hear you talking?’' meant every word of it," he whispered, shrilly.
“And why not?
Now, you’re no better than me."
"Filthy beast!’’ I rasped, weakly.
“If I hear that you’ve so much as looked at Grace horsewhip you.
And should you attempt to molest her break your back with my two hands.”
Your hands!
Look at ’em, and tell me how much breakin’ they can ever do. never get off that bed alive. you know that your finish is all planned?”
Pedro loosened the screen and swung it aside.
I thought he intended to clamber in and murder me but a streak of stubbornness kept me from calling aloud for help.
With all the force of my will I strove to lift the hands he mentioned so contemptuou.sly, but could not. as a babe, I demanded hoarsely “What do you want?
What do you mean to do Pedro grinned, his eyes shining redly like two mirrors of hate.
His subdued laughter jangled. do everything I said ^after you’re dead.
She wonot listen till you're gone.
But now that you look worse than me, your pretty wife’ll let me love her once you’re out of the way.”
A red haze of hate suffused my brain and for a space I could not see clearly.
Then the spasm passed and I found him leaning through the aperture, balancing a tiny blue bottle upon his palm.
“Take it!”
Pedro invited.
“Quick death, easy death, without any pain.
Ma wanted me to slip it into your grub, to make sure you die.
But worth the risk. dyin’ now.
Take it, yourself, so your wife’ll quit cryin’ about you and listen to me.”
“Get out!”
I raged.
"Go away from that w’indow before I yell for help. have you shot Pedro drew back hurriedly.
“That ainot no way to act,” he complained, “after I came to do you a favor.
Here! leave the bottle in this comer. see it and you'll want it soon.”
He re fastened the screen.
After a long, gloating look at me Pedro disappeared.
A low-flung shaft of light from the setting sun glinted upon the blue bottle and I stared, fascinated, wondering if in truth I might soon want the poison.
Why had the idiot said “Now that you look worse than me.
I remembered Doctor comment concerning a strange “shrinkage” that puzzled him.
Did he mean my skin, the wasting of my flesh I shuddered at thought of freakish human skeletons I had seen, struggled in a blinding effort to gain control of my limbs, almost succeeded.
After had fallen back, gasping, upon the psilow a harrowing i&ir possessed me.
Something was horribly wroi^!
I must get up and away To Grace.
What the ensuing effort to rise rost me in mental strain and mortal agony cmly God can realize.
If there be such a thing as actual power of mind over matter, then it was that which, in the end, gave me emnmand of my musdes again.
Striving to the point of deadly nausea, beset in every joint by dreadful pains which nearly drove me mad, at last myself to a sittit^ position, swung my legs down frmn the bed.
Clinging to the white iron framework I made an effort to stand, although at first my knees buckled miserably.
Dimly, I perceived the door of a closet across the room.
On hands and knees I crawled to it, seeking a robe or other covering for my nakedness.
I reached for the knob three times and failed, before I could draw myself erect.
Swa dng there, I found inside a suit of my dothes which Grace must have brought as a childish means of bolstering hope that cme day I would wear them home.
Draggmg garments from the hooks I crawled back to tte bed again.
After a grueling ordeal of rising and seating myself, I drew on the dark grey trousers and to stand.
Dazedly I stared down at their absurd length, noting that the legs were at least foot toe longi Fumbling in the pockets found a familiar purse.
Yes, indulntabty they were mine.
Turning a little, then, I caught a glimpse of my reflectioi in the glass of a window that was closed.
A cry of horror burst across my lips at sight of the revolting figure there darkly revealed.
A dvrarfted and hairless monstrosity!
My bald skull bulked far too large for the scrawny neck and stunted frame which supported it.
Deepset eyes were gloomy ca'vems beneath my brow.
My nearly fleshless jaws were those of a head, lips p^er thin and dghtly drawn.
My broad shoulders- had narrowed and were bunched like those of a deformed child.
My long and powerful legs were shrunken to si»ndling, bony shanks from which the last vestige of strength was swiftly ebbing.
Staring at the odious reflected sliape I felt my reason sway.
Locsii^ a rendering screen I toppled upon tlie floor and sank into a bottomless abyss of blackness in which my sufferings were extinguished with the appalling slowness of creeping death.
I lived.
When next I knew death’s groping clutch had missed me, it was to find myself again reposing in the hospital bed.
Tbe voices I heard, and the ^xjken words, dispelled an awful lethargy which gripped my brain but did not break the drains of weakness that shackled my leaden limbs.
“Ah, God I canot bear to look at him.”
It was my wife’s despairing cry.
“No curse has done this!
It fs the poison.”
I listened to her muffled sobs of horror.
Doctor Hemerich Koop was spealdug but I could not distinguish the things he said.
When my eyes -flicked open I saw that he held Grace in his arms and was whispering with lips pressed close against her golden hair.
She broke away and whirled to face him, her cheela flushed with anger and dismay.
“You dare say such things to me!
While Ralph Res dying “As well say ‘dead,’ my dear, for soon he shall be.
And even though I were to keep him alive, would you not choose me, small and ugly though I am, in preference to the jellylike thing which was once a man Ah He is watching us See him quivering there like a viscous blob upon the sheet.”
“You demon Grace screamed in chattering frenzy.
"Not Zell Mendez but you You did this “And why not?
He stole your love from me.”
“As though I ever could have loved a hunched and evil creature!” am a man Koop thumped his narrow chest proudly. am active and strong.
My brain is fine.
Look, now, at the one who thought himself superior.
Is not Ralph Payne a disgusting sight?
He little resembles that ‘father of tall sons and lovely daughters’ of whom you boasted.”
Grace approached on laggard feet and stood beside my bed.
Tears streaming, she touched my torpid arm, my bony face, crying bitterly: love him His soul lives despite the ruin you’ve made of his magnificent body.
Oh, what have you done to him?
What blight have you wrought?”
Doctor Koop came near and hatred glowed in his eyes as he grinned down at me.
“It was a master stroke,” he bragged.
“The strategy of using Zell Mendez and her half-wit spawn as pawns in my little game.
For days on end she voiced her threats to all she met, after the accident.
There are fifty witnesses to swear that she contemplated the murder of Ralph Payne and made Pedro help her plan it.
Now, both are jailed, accused of poisoning your husband by contaminating the swimming pool, and no one ever shall hear of the clever operation that I performed upon his throat.”
Grace stared, and so did my powers of speech paralyzed as yet although my tongue curled and twisted in an effort to talk.
“You operated on Ralph Why My wife’s eyes were round with terror.
“Oh, tell me what you've done to him.
Is there no cure?” could cure him ^but at a price you may not wish to pay.
Another might, if be were skilled in the science of the glands and knew what I have done.
Prevailing upon Pedro Mendez to hide nearby and toss a bottle of common poison into the pool after frightening you, I let Ralph drink of drugged liquor from a bottle I brought, knowing that we’d have to rescue him from his dive.
The numbing effect of the drug I used is instantaneous.
That gave me an excuse to bring him here to the hospital.
With only a simple-minded Cajun girl to help I planted a globule of metallic compound at the base of the parathyroid gland where it would immediately create sufficient pressure to halt the gland’s functioning.
The result, as you see. was swift decalcification of his bones, a shrinking of stature, a wasting of flesh.
He is like a thing of rubber and jelly, now. as death approaches.”
“But he could be cured?”
Grace pleaded.
“Oh, say that he can be saved “Of course.
By removal of the pressure. and with proper treatment, in a matter of months he might regain his normal size and health.
But who shall grant him that boon, my dear?”
“You shall!
Hemerich!
You say you love me.
You must be kind.
Restore him. forgive and forget.
Stop this madness and use your skill to make him a man again.”
“You heard my terms.
I mentioned a price smile was lecherous.
He seized Grace in his arms and sought her lips.
“The price is yourself ^mine for always.
And you must answer now shall I forget the play of torturing emotions that swept over my dear wife’s face as she fought to submerge her revulsion, to find the courage to endure an odious ordeal.
She gasped “What do you mean ^for always Not after he is well?”
“If I grant him life,” Koop said, harshly, “it must be without you, and he shall never know.
At best, his mind might not be restored cwnpletely.
It do rso harm to make certain of that.”
Coerprehoiding his horrible intention to render me a witless hulk endowed witii life, Grace tfcrew herself upon her knees and
{beaded piteously.
Roughly, Koop thrust her hands aside.
"If I only wanted you now, take you.
It most be of your own free will and always.”
Again, weakening, he bis skhmy arms about her and pressed his r^aisive lips to hers.
Grace tore hetsdf free, she strode him wkh her open palm, and dropped in a sd^ng hc^ upon die bed beside me.
"Let me die wkh Ralph ^e moaned. touch nse.
Only let me Hemerich swarthy face paled greyly.
I knew, then, that he had expected victory.
Failure seeraed to drive him mad.
“Die?
Never, you fool! keep the pair of you alive so long as the spark can be held within your rotting bodies!
You shall endure the same operation, Grace, mid in tum sh^ become as he is.
Bones of rubber and flesh of jdly, while your brain melts in harrowing helplessness.
If you love him so, you shall lie beside him and dream of the ecstasies that you win know no more.”
Springing upon Grace, Koop bound her hands ivith a towel, likewise her ankles.
Dashing out of the room he returned with a hypodermic fringe and plunged the needle into her arm.
Soon my wife’s froiaied stru^les ceased.
Removing lier bonds Koop leaned across motionless body and peered into my startmg eyes.
“You know!
I can read the suffering there Both mast live to suffer endlessly.
White I watdi over you day by day and laugh at two steong lovers eoi^ted ‘tall sons and lovely daughters’ His har^ mirth echoed in the room.
He opened the door and called.
“Addie Cenne here A dull-eyed Cajun girl appeared, fear written large upon her stupid features.
Koop exclaimed: “The lady is sick.
You must help me operate He carried Grace out.
The girl cast a frightened look at me.
I thought her lips moved in settndtess pky, that she felt an urge to render aid, btrt stark terror held her captive and she Koop obediently.
Once more I set my mind to the task of making the fie^

If only I cotald move, roll off the bed, crawl to the room where Grace lay helpless beneatli his This time I coedd not.
My greatest effort served only to elevate ragr head a triffing way.
But in that brief instant a downward glance encompassed my shrunken legs and I groaned in trembling horror.
The two limbs lay coiled awry i^on the sheet like rubber tubes in which no of bone remaiaed.
Koop had spoken truly.
I was but a jdlylike blob of slowly liquefying matter that was scarcely flesh.
The shock seemed to disintegrate i»y brain and consciousness faded. was lying upon a bed which had been moved into the room before I awalsened.
Some one had turned me upon my side so that I might sec her there when the toqior lifted.
A white bandage encircled her throat and lier eyes were wide and starii^.
Both wrists and ankles were caught dose to the irem frasnew'ork by broad straps to her prisoner.
Her quiverkig lips formed a whispered query “Ralph!
Can you hear me?
Can you speak?”
For long moments I fou^ the rigidity of throat mitsdes, then croaking worda grated across my dry t«:th.
“Yes, I he*u-.
Oh, God!
I see "He operated on me Soon I shall as ymi orsl” The dread sent«ice of doom gushed out of her very soul, a gulp of anguish.
“How long?” gasped. week, he sa»^ before the gland is aeriou^ affected.
Oh, there is ao hope—” voice sounded at the doorway.
His hateful vis^e was framed there, grinning.
“Oh, yes there is, my dear.
I might yet reconsider within the week, you decide that life with me is preferable to living putrescence,” I found the strength to curse him, to utter threatening prophecies of retribution.
Doctor Koop only smiled.
“You have revived considerably, as a result of treatment last m'ght while you were unconscious, I want you stronger that you may suffer morel While you lie there, waiting, watching.”
He stepped away to bed, threw back the coverlid, tore her gown away.
Lust gleamed in his hot eyes but hunger for vengeance and the will to torture prevailed.
He turned aside, muttering: Seeing her lovely form shrivel and shrink. be wrinkles and bony angles where you knew curves and tender maiden’s flesh.
Love will be smothered in revulsion as you watch each other disintegrate and become two dwarfed, disgusting thills with only brain cells hvir^.”
Kocp went out, saying as he departed "Soon the treatment will make you ravenously hungry, Payne.

His brittle lad^bter edioed from a distance.
Grace was weeping.

Stupefied, I lay resigned to the inevitable.
But soon I experienced a faiat soisation oi hfe, of tkodatiei^ in the atm which ky cnisfaed beneath my body. remark flashed across my mind.

Strong enough to move, to crawl, to exhaust the last famt spark of life force seeking aid for Grace?

But the instrument in the outer oflice might as well have been miles away.
Feverishly, my frantic brain strug^ed with the problem of what mi^tt be done if found some vntige strength restored.
My wandering gare paused at ffie nearest window.
An ktea sprat^ into being.
“Grace I exclatm^l.
“There may be a fighting diance.
If you could free an arm or leg.

Pitifully, she looked at me and shook her head, but I urged frantically: “Try!
Twist and try Grace began to writhe, to ti^ and struggle.
Faint moans of pain escaped her lips as the straps cut skin and flesh.
At last, said: one foot loose.
But, I canot do any niwe.”
“Plant your heel against the wall,” I cried.
“Push hard!
Force your bed against mine, and shove me nearer to the window. ojily a matter of inches Grace succeeded in doing wliat I asked.
Our beds collided and the impulse of her thrust skidded my cot against tlie window sill, rolling me upon my back as I made a desperate effort in that direction.
Lying there, then, I tried to move my hands, found new life tlie finger tips but none in my arms.
Slowly, gropii^ly, nails scratching at the bed linen and mind sav^ely intent upon aeoimplishment, I draped one hand in fractional jerks across the sheet onto the window ledge, and seized ffie tiny bottle that Pedro Mendes had hidden there.
The trivial mtucukr feat that fc^owed exhausted me more than I can express.
With the prize precariously clutched between thumb and forefinger I worked my hand back by the power of fingertips alone until it reached my body.
Three attempts I made to raise that left arm and failed.
Then, like a crawling worm, I made it creep across my chest until it met the other.
In a little while, when the cold sweat of weakness beaded my brow and nearly all my strength was spent, with my right hand I laid the vial in palm.
Her fingers closed upon it.

“Hide donot understand.”
Her eyes sought nune.
I rolled my head and whispered: "It is poison.” came later, bearing a well laden tray.
His forecast was correct I knew the pangs of hunger but the viands he carried interested me less than the bottle of wine.
Placing the food upon a table, he turned to smile at Grace and said hurt yourself struggling.
One strap was poorly fastened.
Why not agree to my proposals and have them all off?”
My wife looked up at him long and moodily.
One could scarcely recognize her voice when, chokingly, she said: canot bear itl To be Hke him!
Oh, Godl I canot “You mean Doctor Koop leaned above her, eagerly.
“That you have counted the cost of hopeless love for the thing that he has become “My love is dead!” she stormed, hj^terically. was faithful, I was true.
But Ralph Payne is gone!
There remains only that!”
She swung her eyes toward me and quickly looked away.
Koop exclaimed “Then come to me?
Oh, this Is glorious.”
Awkwardly, in his haste, he fumbled at the straps which bound her.
Casting them aside he caught Grace in his arms and helped her to arise.
“My dear one.
My lovely one,” he gloated.
“Always watched you, wanted you.
And now you are mine With a shuddering sigh Grace pushed his pawing hands aside, forced a shrill laugh, crying: "Yours I shall be, but donot ever call it love. the price I must pay.”
“Have it your own way,” he snapped.
“So long as you do pay.” be angry,” Grace pleaded. am upset and unnerved.

Grace lowered the glass from her lips, face white as death, exclaiming "Drink your toast to me!
Have I not deserved it?” countenance split an evil grin. improving, my dear Wc’U get along famously.”
Grace took his glass, half emptied, and gave him hers.
“The better to seal our bargain, Hemerichl” she cried, and a laugh like an echo from hell rattled upon her bloodless lips.
Koop tossed off the drink at a gulp.
He started violently.
A terrible tremor shook his scrawny frame from head to foot.

We held our breath while negotiating it And then we saw the lights of our destination.
Groff Hall!
Private residence, hotel or whatever it might be, it perched like an eagle’s nest high on the crags, with the river-gorge in a hairpin turn almost surrounding it.
Eerie location indeed, with these wild lightless defiles, slashed and broken, storm-swept by rain and wind of gale force now.
The trail looped and turned, and then we came to the small rocky top, with the two-story rambling stone structure before us.
The lights of its windows were blurred yellow blobs through the torrential rain.
Whatever sort of place it was, it had to be our resting place for the night.
Our car would Jack Baker felt that all was not well in the ominous appearing establishment of the sinister Dr. Groff but he little guessed, when he took his beautiful young sister into that place, that he was exposing her to the brutal lusts of one whom a weird madness had already driven to acts of unnameable horror A Novell atto o/ Night‘Cloaked Mystery and Death! go no further.
I pulled up under a porte-cochere.
Our radiator was boiling again; the engine was knocking violently when I shut it oif.
Iiad enough,” I said as I climbed from the car.
“Wherever we are here we stay.”
If I had known “Good evening, sir.
The voice by its very unexpectedness, was horribly startling.
Edith, my sister, gasped, with a faint, suppressed cry.
I whirled to find a man standing at my elbow.
In the dimness, here under the portecochere roof, I could see him as a tall figure, broad and burly.
He was without hat and outer coat; evidently seeing our approaching headlights as we toiled up the grade, he had come out to greet us.
“Oh,” I said.
“How do you do?
My sister and I we’re lost.
You we hoped this was a hotel our car’s running badly we’re hungry.”
He turned with a queer, stooping gesture as though peering at Edith.
He said Dr. Emil Groff.”
A heavy, guttural, foreign voice, but there was a dignified suavity about it. hotel?” he said.
“Well not just that.
But you are welcome.
Come in.
The young lady must be cold.”
He left us standing on the threshold of the open door while against my protestations he carried in our two suitcases.
We saw a dim hallway with electric lamps heavily shaded.
A tall, brown-haired young woman in a maid’s uniform stood watching us.
And suddenly there was the distant sound of a girl’s laughter, instantly checked.
It echoed through the silent interior and there was about it so eerie a quality that Edith and I stared at each other wordlessly, and the maid, whirlii^ at the soimd, hurried instandy away.
Dr. Emil Groff came with our suitcases.
“Most horrible night, my friends. shall put your car away later. short-handed tonight.
My nurse is on holiday, and my man went to Chattanooga for supplies.
I fear the storm may keq) him away for tonight.”
What was this place?
A hospital?
A madhouse?
I saw this Dr. Groff now as a man of perhaps forty.
A burly six-foot fellow, with a head of close-clipped black hair a smooth-shaven face of rugged, somewhat handsome features.
He stood fingering a black eyeglass ribbon that hung around his neck; his dark gaze, from deep-set eyes under heavy black brows, seemed appraising me.
“Oh yes,” I said awkwardly.
“It certainly is a bad night.”
I told him our name Baker; and that we were traveling from Florida to Chicago.
He listened, with a very queer, grave smile faintly pulling at his mouth; and abruptly he interrupted me.
"Well, I am honored that you came here, Mr. Baker.
We shall make you comfortable this storm, no one could travel these mountains a night like this.”
His gaze clung to dark, slim beauty.
He added, “We are glad to have you, my dear young lady.
We will do everything possible to make you happy.”
A madhouse, here in this wild, lonely mountain fastness?
This man himself one of the inmates?
Thoughts may run wild very fast Edith took an involuntary step backward as though his words were physically repelling, and she flung me a startled, questioning glance.
Then before I could speak, he had turned to me. understand you, Mr. Baker.”
His lowered voice and his bulk momentarily exduded Edith who was a few feet from us.
“Your sister needs attention?
Later we will discuss the details.” that my wits were scattered. ttw the brown-haired maid in her biack and white umform again sending near ua.
I ^mmered: “Wi^» we donot want to intrude, Dr. Groff.
I reafly thought this was a hotel My one wild wish then was to get Edith out of here, storm or no storm.
“Hotd?" he said.
“Well ^yes, you might call it that.
Of course your stay will be brief supper only, perhaps, if the storm dimimshes.
When my man returns I will ha^ him fix your car.
He is a very good mechanic.’' The maid said, “Shall I take tliem upstairs, Dr, Groff?”
“Yes, Millie.
Just temporary rooms.
They may leave after supper. bring up their hj^ge.’* The maid touched arm.
“Come, miss.”
She said it gently but firmly, as one would talk to a child.
And again Groff was leaning close to me.
“Naturally they donot like the idea of permaaeney. almost always the case.”
Edith, the patient to be humored upon her admittance here!
I smiled with relief.
“Look h^e,” I said, got us all wrong, Dr. Groff.
Is this a ho^ital?
I didnot realize it.
I assure you there’s nothing wrong with my sister.”
Certainly this fellow was no madman.
He saw that Edith could not hear me now that I could not possibly be talking for her benefit He looked startled, and disappointed.
He said, did not understand you.
It is so almost impossible for any one to arrive here by chance.”
“But we did,” I said, and smiled.
A sudden v^ue hostility had come to him.
His gaze had an appraising suspicion in it I addfed, wonot intrude further.”
His seemed to vanish.
“No inb’sstcm,” Ite said.
“This is Groff Hatf.
We receive patients who are depressed.
Melancholic, shall I say?
My treatment has proven very efficacious.
There is happiness here,”' Certainly nothing very sinister, for all its weird morbidness.
I said, s:^ well then, if we might have lodging until the storm is past.”
“Of course,” he agreed.
“My charges are reasonable and we have plenty of room Oh, my wife.
Dr, Agatha Groff.
This is Mr. Baker and bis sister.
Not patients they were lost in the storm.”
A woman in bladt load approached us.
Despite my polite endeavor to smile as I took her extended hand, an inward shudder swept me.
The woman was of indeterminate age, certainly older than her stalwart husband little, hunched, thick-set figure no taller than my shoulder, gorilla.-like, with long thick arms.
He dress was stiff black taffeta, wkh white ruching around her short neck where her head set down between wide hunched shoulders.
The dress gave an incongruous air of primness, carried also by her black hair, streaked with grey, primly parted in tlie middle, plastered down and rolled into a knot at the back.
But it was her face that most startled me.
Sharp, hatchet feattires and for all her smile new, there was so intent a malevolence in her face that I caught my breath.
“Mr. Baker?
You are welccane She bad the same guttural accent as her husband.
Her hand gripping mine was like a roughened, scaly daw.
Then she turned to where Edith stood “You are welcome, my dear.”
Her little glittering eyes seemed feasting on dark slhn beauty; die sucked in her breath with an audfele hiss.
“Wl^, my dear child you are beautiful— 4>eautiful We presently followed the maid upstairs.
Edith grilled my arm. go right after supper!"
"Yes!” of the storm was far more apparent up here on the second floor.
The slap and pound of the rain on the roof was audible.
Gusts of wind, as though this were a tropical hurricane, rattled the old building from end to end.
A dim upper hallway confronted us, with ft number of bedrooms opening from it The maid turned to a dosed door almost at the head of the staircase.
She said, "This will suit you, Mr. Baker.
Two connecting rooms.
Tliere is plenty of choice.
We have only two other patients just now.”
She had a quiet dignity, this maid.
An intelligent-looking, handsome girl of about twenty.
Wliat could have been her dark ftnd tragic history, tliat made her a part of this wild place?
I have often wondered.
“Other patients?”
I said. not patients. leaving right after supper.”
As though the storm were hurlipg defiance at my words, there came a sudden sizzling lightning flash, and a crack of thunder with it.
The lurid glare showed through a window at the distant end of tfie hall.
The electric lights of the house simultaneously vanished, so that for that bisant I saw the figures of Edith and the maid painted green-white, and the decrepit hallway an inferno of glare.
Then the hall lights flickered on again.
The thunder rolled away into the distance like ft grumbling, retreating giant.
Edith gasped, "Good heavens, that was dose.”
"We have bad storms in these mountains sometimes,” the maid said.
She stood with her hand on the bedroom door her gaze on Edith. going after supper? not sick?”
"No,” Edith said, and tried to smile, not” From one of these upper bedrooms, near us now, again came that eerie chilling burst of laughter.
So close to us it seemed two girls laughing behind one of these closed doors.
Laughter so queer, so wildly, unnaturally strange that to the listener there could not seem any quality of mirth in it, but only horror.
I saw the maid stiffen she took an involuntary step toward the sound.
Then she changed her mind and swung on us. going right after supper?"
She was breathless, with furtive lowered voice.
On the nearby stairs, Dr. Groff was starting up with our suitcases.
“You do tliat,” the maid added swifdy.
“You never mind tlie storm ^you get your sister out of here "Yes,” I agreed.
I gripped her shoulder as I bent toward her.
"Millie, tell me A bedroom door diagonally across the hall burst open.
From it two young girls came running.
The hall light shone on their slim pink-white beauty, their bodies clad in brief filmy undergarments, their hair wildly flowing.
They staggered together into the hall, clinging to each other, wildly laughing in a paroxysm of macabre mirth.
Then they saw Millie as she sprang for them.
"We want Mrs. Groff they screamed.
"Where is Mrs. Groff. it time?”
Millie was struggling with them.
"No, not time yet!
You go back.
You shouldnot have done that You stop it.”
She shoved them back into the roan, and banged the door on them.
But their wild screaming laughter still sounded.
Edith and I stood frozen.
Gruesome, unholy laughter.
What was this gliastly thing Lurking Rend than five minutes had passed.
Dr. Emil Groff had brought mp our suitcases, with his face stolidly inscrutable, ignoring that brief wild appearance of the two laughing girls.
In the hall he had murmured a few words to Millie, with a glance at the nearby door behind which the girls now were silent.
I caught a fragment of the maid’s answer locked them in.”
Then Dr. Groff had come to our door.
“Supper will be ready presently.
Come down soon.”
He left us he and the maid descended the stairs.
Edith stood shuddering.
I took a look around the two small bedrooms.
They were meagerly but comfortably furnished.
Each had a single window, and a door to the hall and there was a connecting door between them.
I peered from one of the windows.
Solid blackness, with only the wild rage of the storm.
But I could see enough to realize that there was a sheer drop from these windows, down into the canyon upon the brink of which the house was perched.
“Those girls Edith murmured, when I went back to her.
Whatever this macabre mystery, I could see no sense of talking about it.
Heaven knows, Edith was frightened enough. get us out of here right after supper,” I said.
Then we heard a car arriving.
Not the manservant from Chattanooga, for as we silently moved out to the head of the stairs, the visitors were visible down in the lower hall.
Dr. Groff and Millie, greeting a party of three.
Two men and a girl.
One of the men was elderly greyhaired.
He seemed ill he stood a moment, th«i Millie brought a chair in which he sat down while the other man talked with Dr. Groff.
This other man was young in his thirties doubtless a stalwart fellow, with smooth black hair.
The girl had taken off her hooded cloak.
The hall light gleamed on her pale-gold tresses.
She was small, no older than Edith, and extremely beautiful.
I thought suddenly of the way Dr. deformed hag of a wife had stared at the dark slim beauty of Edith.
Was this new arrival another possible victim?
An aura of wealth was upon these three latest visitors.
They came upstairs in a moment.
At the staircase head they turned down the hall in the other direction so that they did not pass our door, but the girl’s voice floated to us not too tired, father?”
We were presently ready to go dowm to supper.
As we started, it seemed that amid all the noises of the outside storm I heard footsteps, pattering away in the upper hall.
“Edith Wait here a minute The dim lull was empty; but ten feet or so beyond the locked door where Millie had shoved the two girls, the hall turned a right angle to the left, into anotlier wing of the building.
I ran there.
The hall beyond the angle was almost dark.
Thirty feet from me, it seemed that I saw a shadow blob of dark, indistinguishable shape disappearing into a doorway.
I section of the hall was heavily carpetal.
I padded noiselessly .forward into the deepening darkness.
It wasnot a doorway into which the sliadow had plunged, but the top of a steep flight of descending back stairs.
Solid blackness.
But down at the bottom there was a vertical slit of light which marked a door.
The slit was narrowing; the door evidently just being closed by whoever it was I had been following.
The door stopped, ajar, and abruptly I heard dim voices.
They were muffled, blurred by the confined space and the sounds of the storm but I caught fragments of the words.
“You Ludvig what are you doing?”
"No busmess of yours.
Who was it who oanje?”
"The Forrests.
The old man, and Rolf Forrest, his nephew.
And the old man’s dau^iter came It was Emil Groff talking I felt sure of tliat.
Then Ludvig said, “His daughter I I saw hut somehow glowinglike burnished “Ludvig!
Stop that, you fool!
You’B get us into troubte with your devitisb— “You talk Eke fftat to mel Emil, you dare talk like that!”
“Yes, I do. li’a going to stojp; I tell you.
These two damnable girisf—when they die— that's the end. have no in this “Get ns into trouble!’' There was a wild cadthog fellah.
This Ludvig, whose authority Emil now was challenging was this a nr something near it “Get us mto trouble?
Worse than your muiders, Emil?
Worse than Wg money fn that, you focd.
These Fosre^ are rich- be^ carefully pknoed, so there is no daii^r to us in it This young fellow, Rolf Forrest “You go to hell,” Ludwig suddenly rasped.
“You canot control me you’ll do what I you, as you always have.
Who owns tins building?
Whose mcm^ set yon in business here?”
Again that wild chuckl'mg laughter.
“You dare to tell me what I shall dol pl^sure, Emil.
What is life without pleasure?”
It seemed suddenly that they were scuffling.
The door at the foot of these back stairs clicked closed as one cd dietn against it; and the sounds were shut from me.
With my heart pottnding, I went back to Edith.
A maniac loose here?
Thus Ludvig, lurking here, never showing himself, intent only on hts lust for scmie weird, fentastlc pleasure?
Edith was still at our bedroom door.
“Jack, what was it?”
“Nothing,” I said.
"Swne one may have been up here went down the back stairs I didnot see anybody In a minute or tw'o vrt left tlic room.
Muffled, eerie laughter was coming again from the bedroom in whidi the two girls were locked.
In spite of ourselves we stood a moment, shudderingly listening to it Then we desceitded the front staircase.
In the front lower hall Mrs. Groff came forward to meet us.
"Ah, my dear children ^you are ready Come in to supper.”
She stood in her prim black taffda, smiling at tis ingratiatingly.
Hideous little woman.
A travesty of wonianhood, like a grinning fanale gargoyle.
I wondered then if my reyolted impressioiw of her were not inspired by the mere misfortune of her deformed, physical ugliness.
Certainly she seemed trying to be pleasant.
She fed us akmg the back lower hall, to the dining room where a dozen broad tables stood devoid qf setting.
“You have very few patients just now,” I said, “Yes only two ^Millie serves them in their room.
And a party of three who will dine with you.”
The table, here in a corner of the dining room, was set for six.
The Forrests came now; and when the introductions were over, Mrs. Groff said, “My husband he expected to be your host ^but he is detained My thoughts leaped.
He was stiff having troubte with Ludvig?
Why was- there no mention of this Ludvig?
Mrs. Groff added, “But Dr. Groff will join you presently.
As for me, I must hdp She smiled her grimace upon us all.
She “This terrible storm we will do our best for you She moved off to the kitchen, and Millie served ns.
Five of us, with one empty chair like a spectre in our midst.
We were, in truth, a strange little gathering.
Old Mr. Forrest a man with the aura of wealth and the blight of illness so obviously upon him.
Rolf Forrest, his nephew stalwart, darkly handsome fellow, with an arrogant swagger that wealth had doubtless given him.
And Anne Forrest.
To her, most of my interest went.
She was sitting beside me hair of pale gold faultless complexion a face beautiful as a cameo.
Beautiful as Edith.
Amazing contrast, these two girls the dark, slim Latin beauty of Edith, inherited from our mother; and this Anne, like a little fragile flower of the north. not detail our conversation during the meal.
It was strained, awkward, as though each of us might be engrossed with thoughts that could not be voiced.
Edith and I told the misadventures which had landed us there.
And the others explained that old Mr. Forrest had come here for his health a nervous depression which had come upon him from overwork in Nashville. shall be lonely here,” he said somberly.
“But only for a week or two, uncle,” Rolf Forrest said.
“Then you’ll be so well we’ll come and get you and take you back.”
Anne Forrest spoke hardly a word.
But when the meal was nearly over, at a moment when the others were talking with Edith, she suddenly leaned toward me.
And I caught her agitated murmur, must see you alone tonight please “Yes,” I murmured.
I had for the time, forgotten that Edith and I were leaving tonight.
I admit I was attracted with a singular swiftness to the fragile golden beauty of Anne Forrest.
Whatever menace was here in this sinister household, certainly it was directed at this other girl, not at Edith.
And her whisper now was appealing.
She added, “You and your sister I frightened I must talk to you Rolf Forrest was saying, "Yes, we expected ^Anne and I to go back to Nashville tonight.
But the accursed bridge is down no way of getting out of here for anybody not till daylight.”
It brought a gasp from Edith, and it snapped me to alertness.
Marooned here.
“Why,” I said, "nobody told us thj-t.
My sister and I were leaving tonight.”
Young Forrest shrugged.
"Not a chance.
You came over that bridge you know, the one like a trestle, nearly falling down of its own weight— r” He gestured.
"Just down the cliff a hundred feet or so.
That lightning flash Lord, we’d only just gotten over the bridge when the lightning hit it He laughed.
I suppose it was quite a normal laugh, but it sent a shudder over me as though any form of laughter in this mysterious house must carry horror.
“That bridge,” he added, “just slid sidewise and fell.”
I looked to Anne for confirmation, and she nodded.
Mrs. Groff was approaching, helping Millie with the dessert.
"My husband has just been to verify the wreck of the bridge,” she said.
“It is down.
On foot, one might get around the canyon to the other road by daylight, but it is many miles.”
Marooned here.
With the pale-gold beauty of Anne Forrest beside me, I own that at that moment it did not seem so horrible a catastrophe.
If I had known I I would have taken Edith and Anne and run out on foot to huddle through the night among the black, storm-swept crags if I had known Murder Stalks not going to sleep,” Edith said. take turns keeping awake,” I agreed.
“Jttst aa a matter of precaution.
But donot let’s get too tense over it.”
I laugbed slwrtly; and I was startled to see Edith flash me a look, as thougli to her too, the sound of laughter here was frightening.
"Mysterious damn jdaee,” I added. patients! morbid enough for anybody but I donot see any danger to us.*' I said it lightly enough, but the things I Imew that Edith didnot know, again leaped at me.
Tlie luihing Ludvig.
A third member of this Groff family?
The One who held the purse strings, a lustful fiend who must not be seen by us visitors —or even mentioned.
Demoniac with his desires unspeakable, so tudeous that even Enifl Groff was revolted at th^n afraid of ^he c»ftaequent^.
Yet Emil himself, had beea—ond perhaps was now engaged in mttrder.
And I thought of the appeal of Anne Forrest, Something was threatening her, so that in her terror she had aj^ealed to me, a I had had no opportunity yei of seeing Anae alone.
After supper we had all gone into a elieerless little siltii^ room.
It was by then laearly nine o’clock.
We sat for perhaps half an hour, discussing the storm which was raging.
Queer storms, these of the Tonuefisee mountains.
The lightning bolt which had demolished the ramshackle brid^ was the last.
No more had €ome.
But the wind was still high, and the min was still a torrent.
It seemed that Anne was watching an opportunity to talk to me alone, but could not find it.
Then her father seemed tired.
They w:nt to their bedrooms, with the hunchback Ihtle Mrs. Groff escorting them to be sure they were comfortable; and Edith and I totlowed.
At the top of the stairs as we all said goodnight; seemed that Anne flashed me a glpnce, but whatever her meaning, I could not determine it. caai sleep if you like,” Edith was saying.
“And staying here with you not iti my room.”
We sat together in one of the bedrooms.
We had closed and locked the hall doors of both rooms; and left tlie connecting door betwttn thesn <^)en.
The hotise had goite almost immediately silent.
There was up here on this floor with us, as far as we knew, only the two girls iodced the bedroom diagonally across the hall; and the Forrests, who had three adjacent bedrooms on this upper hall just beyond the front staircase.
Those two girls whose unholy laughter was so shocking to hear I sat wondering whether Millie had taken their supper if any attention were being paid to them.
They were silent now a silence that somehow seined more ominous even than their laughter.
Groffs and Millie were downstairs, so far as knew perhaps their bedrooms were down there.
Emil Groff liad not appeared.
And that Ludwig I found that I was doaing, with drifting thoughts.
If only I were anned.
Some weapon but I had none, save a very ineffectual pea-knife.
But I mustnot mention it to Edith.
Tomorrow I would see Anne again That hndvig would he be roaming the house now?
Tlie thotaght me into alertness.
“What is it, Jack?*’ "Nothing, Edith, you better lie down on the bed stay awake," “No. all right here."
Abruptly the small electric bulb in the was ejrtmguished.
We were plunged into darioiess.
"Jackr "Sit still,” I murmured, “Probably it’ll come on in a minute,” But it did not. through the stonn the lights of the bouse had been waverii^; but now It seemed permanent. darkness crowded us frightened, against all reason.
I could hear terrified breathing her hand reached out and gripped my arm.
“Oh— Jack!”
I said.
“There was a stump of candle on the table.
I guess the lights up here in these mountains are never very dependable.”
I fumbled and found the candle lighted it.
Even its wavering, tiny yellow glow was reassuring.
Then a startling thought hit me.
The light was out in our adjoining room.
The storm, during the last half hour, had seemed rapidly abating.
The rain had ceased the wind was still strong, but noticably less than before and outside our windows now there was fitful moonlight.
Queer, that having weathered the storm, the lights would go out now.
Were they out all over die house, or just in our two rooms?
Had someone pulled out a fuse, to plunge us, and all the house perhaps, into darkness?
I went to the bedroom door, with gaze upon me.
“What is it.
Jack?”
“Just want to see if the lights are out in the hall.”
The little hall was solidly dark.
Evidently every light in the house was extinguished.
And there was a new silence here now a black, empty silence, with the rattle of rain on the roof missing and the surge of the wind almost gone, so that now the silence was blank, unnatural.
I stood, straining my hearing.
Was that a dim, choking sound of laughter?
I turned to Edith.
“Those girls,” I said softly, “laughing again.”
Was it laughter?
Or something else now On impulse I crossed diagonally to the door on the other side of the hall.
Behind me, Edith stood framed in our doorway, by the candlelight.
I reached the other doorway.
Laughter?
It was soft, eerie.
A choked laughter?
I bent with my ear to the wooden panel.
And I heard a blur of confused sounds.
The thump of the girls moving about.
And queerly gruesome sounds of their suppressed voices.
Giggles A laugh, choking into a sob.
A thump, with a revolting, giggling little scream.
With wild rtmning thoughs I straightened, to return to Edith.
And frozen.
I stood tense, with dilating nostrils.
What was this I was smelling?
A drift from under the girls’ door.
A faint, weird smell, of which I had suddenly become aware.
A stench?
A perfume? went back to Edith; closed our bedro<mi door, and locked it. in there,” I said.
“Just the same laughing poor little devils maniacs There must have been some look on my face that stopped her questioning.
I .did not meet her gaze.
“Lie down, Edith,” I added.
"The night will seem interminable if you just sit there.” all right.”
Half an hour.
It did indeed seem an eternity as I sat alone with my questioning thoughts.
Beside me, fn a little wooden rocker with a bed pillow behind her, Edith was dozing.
And suddenly in the silence I heard a tap on our bedroom door.
&3ft.
Furtive.
Edith sat up, staring at me wordlessly.
The tap came again. open it,” Edith warned as I rose.
At the door I said softly “Who is it What you want “Mr. Baker.
Oh, please voice.
I jerked open the door and she came in like a white^ darting wraith, the light of the candle she was carrying painting her head and neck with its yellow glow.
‘Tfow Edith gasped and as I snatdied the candk, Anne ran to Edith with a Httie xxy.
“Oh Tve been so lightened I had to come to yoo.
When the lights went out a while j«st txjnldnot stand its I had to come She -was mth and terror Edith led her to the bed, and sat there with arms aromid her.

I said gently couldnot make any oppfsrtunity to talk with you.
I thought, tomorrow may— may be too late,” she gasped.
I suppose it’s just my silly fears.
This thra ghasdy house, as you say.
Btit I was afraid, even before Rolf brought father and me up here.”
My mind flung back to that altercation I had heaid at the foot of the stairs just before supper.

“Your cousin Rolf brou^t you up here?” demanded.
“Yes.

He came up here to inspect it.

And Rolf Kiid that die cure here was wonderful and he persuaded father to come.” a Kttle light in distant darkness, I began to understand.
“Your father is rich?”

She stared.

And she added wiffi a stark note of terror in her voice guessing what Fm thinking. only ray imagination maybe, but I always been alraid of Rolf.
He wants to marry me— I donot love him "Afraid for yourself?”
I inuimured.
“No.

“No.
And I got terrified just thinking.
Oh, wliat are you going to do?"
I had seized one of the candles. your father up,” I said. have to plan some way lo guard him.”
In truth, I had no plan, save that I could not let tl^at old man sleep in there alone now.
If only I had a weapon!
I saw now so many adversaries, tonight in this sinister household!
Emil Groff, intent upon murdering this victim aided, no doubt, by liis malevolent gargoyle wife.
And Rolf Forrest, here to see the murder accomplished, and to take the body back home with Dr. death certificate.
And the lurking, fiendish Ludvig what part would he play in this Both the girls were clinging to me.
I said: figure out some excuse to guard your father. tell him you got too frightened to stay alone.
Then Edith and I will stay with you and him They followed me, clinging to me as I opened our door and raised the candle to light the dark and silent hallway.
It was only fifty feet to the bedroom of father.
We passed the front hall stairs.
No sound.
The wavering little light from my candle shone partly down the stairs, with solid blackness in the lower hall.
“This is your father’s door, Anne?”
“Yes—” I rapped softly.
I said softly: “Mr. Forrest oh, Mr. Forrest, wake up.”
The silence was wnlnous.
Ghastly.
Terrifying.
The old door rattled slightly as though from a puff of wind behind it.
I turned its knob and shoved; but it did not yield it was locked on the inside.
“Anne, you call him,” Edith murmured.
“Father!
Father, dear No answer, though I rapped again, much louder.
It was loud enough now to arouse Rolf.
I turned to the adjacent door.
“This “Yes.”
I thumped.
“Rolf Forrest?
Let me ini This is Jack Baker.
Let me in!”
No answer.
I turned the knob.
The unlocked door went inward with my shove and I burst .into the room with the girls behind me.
It was unlighted, save by an eerie shaft of moonlight from the window, and now, the light of my candle.
The bed had not been occupied.
Rolf Forrest was not here.
To one side was the closed commimicating door to the bedroom of father.
I dashed to it; turned its knob.
It swung and I went through.
A of wind met me, extinguishing my candle.
The window was wide open, with moonlight streaming in, and a blast of the night air. father lay in the bed, with the covers to his chin.
He seemed to be peacefully sleeping.
I bent over him.
Pallid face in the moonlight.
Behind me the girls were shuddering.
I said, “Mr. Forrest, wake up.”
I shook him insistently, with a wave of dismay sweeping me because I knew it was futile.
Then I swung.
“You girls step back.
He he's fainted, I guess.
Anne gave a little cry, and Edith drew her back.
Both of them knew what I meant.
Dead.
He lay here, unbreathing.
I jerked down the window sash I saw outside that sheer drop of a hundred feet or more down to the little canyon of the mountain torrent.
Then I turned back to the bed.
Dead, unquestionably.
Yet, so far as I could tell, no mark of violence on him.
No blood.
No wound.
No sign even tliat the bedclothes liad been rumpled.
No contortion of the face, nor the muscles of the limbs as one who dies by poison.
What had done this What mysterious agency of murder was this, to leave a peaceful unmarked corpse which Rolf Forrest could take back to Nashville and offer for autopsy perlmps, secure that no evidence of murder would exist As though to answer my unspoken question, it seemed now that despite the opened window and the blast of night air, there was a vague smell in the room.
A stench?
A perfume?
Indefinable “Dead,” I said gently.
The two horrified girls were staring at me from the communicating doorway.
I shoved them back into room, and closed the door on the moonlit scene of death.
“We were too late, Anne.”
And what were we to do now?
So many lurking adversaries here The hall door of little bedroom still was open.
And abruptly all three of us stood here in the dim moonlight, frozen with a new surge of horror.
From outside in the hall there came the sound of drs^ing.
A slow, labored scraping on the hall floor a sound so grewsomely horrible that I stood transfixed, lioldkig the two juddering girls, and with my breath seeming to stidc in my throat, my Kps dry.
The sound stopped.
Came again.
A little louder, as though nearer.
Tiny muffled thumps, mingled with a dragging scrape.
Something out there in the hall, dragging itself toward «s?
I was hardly aware that I had moved to the door; stood virith the girls huddling against me so that we crowded the doorway the moonlit room behind us.
The distant hall was blank darkness, from out of whkh the sound was coming.
The moonlight scrawled past us and laid its wan pallid glow on the hall floor in a little patch just before our door.
Tlie blackness was a wall beyond it.
Ghasfly, approaclung dragging tlmmps, there in the blackness.
With a rush of terror so shocking to my senses tliat the grisly scene swam and blurred before n-ie, I saw, down by the flaer, a head appear.
A head of straggling long brown hair, \vild and tangled.
A disembodied head?
A face, livid whiter contorted with mortal agony smeared with blood wild ^ring eyes a mouth with parted life like a crimson smear For all the noisome horror, I was consefous of ray recognition.
The Groff maid her disembodied head, hobbling here?
No, there was a ghastly throat now and wliite shoulders with the brown hair tangled on them.
Another dragging, labored hitch I saw now her pitiful body, lying on the flow, emerging into the moonlight patch as slowly she dragged herself, hitchittg on one elbow.
I tried tb shove Edith and Anne belnnd me, but like me they were staring with shocked, whirling senses.
Millie dragging herself here in death agony lier throat a crimson gash, with tlie blood streaming draining She saw me now.
Her hand tried to gesture her ^spiiig dying breath, choked with blood, was andible and I was aware that I had flung off tlie girls and was bending over her.
“Millie—” dead.
I ju^ fcamd him murdered his tltroat cut like mine.
Oh and loved him— so much “Millie dead Who murdered him Her head Iiad faflcn now.
The blood rattled in her throat.
Then other words came: “He murdered him and did for me just now. murder everybody.
He is—” The words rattled off into the lant choldng agony of her death.
Her whole body twitched for a moment; then lay still, her white citeek the floor with a spreading crimson stain under if.
Room of the Maniac Girls stalking in the blackn^s of this ghastly household!
Old Mr. Forrest, dead here in his bed.
Mfllicf, here in the hall, with slashed throat.
And some one else was murdered, Millie hod said.
Some one whose body Millie had found lying somewhere here in the dark some man Millie loved.
Who was it?
The fiendish Ludvig?
Dr. Emil Groff?
Or Rolf Forrest?
And who had murdered him?
^murder everylxidy.
He is The choking words of the dying girl echoed in my head, as I leaped to my feet.
Lurking, stalldng fiend, roaming this house with the frenzy Of these murders turning him into a raging madman so tliat now^ he would not stop until he had murdered us all!
And I was unarmed.
I seized the pallid, Anne and Edith, shoved them through the doorway of the room Anne had !teen occupying.
It had no cortimunicatii^ door into at^ other room.
It was smj^, compact.
Its single window overlooked a sheer drop into the canyon no chance of an assailant coming through the window.
Barricaded in here we would be s^e The bed was a narrow iron affair.
A weapon for me?
Edith gasped: “What are you doing?'’ weapon.
Help me.”
I tumbled the bedding to the floor.
Snatched off the mattress.
Lifted out the spm^s.
A jerk, and I had detached from its slot one of the iron side rails of the frame.
It was nearly «evcn feet long; with it I could crack tlie head of any orre or anything that came near me.
A frenzied panic for action was upon me.
I turned to the girls.
“You lode yourselves in here. a telephone near the foot of ffie stairs. gping to call for help the police in the nearest to\vn.
I wonot be a minute! barricade ourselves in here Or we run from the house, out to the wind-swept crags?
More dangerous inside, or ocrtside?
Who could say-yet to me then it seemed that we would be safer locked in this room than in the open moonlit wildness outside.
“You lock the door,” I reiterated. open it unless you hear my voice.”
They nodded wordlessly.
I stood with the iron bedrail in my hand, listening as they Icwked the door.
This silent house!
The grisly corpse of Millie lay at my feet.
Brooding black silence everywhere.
Amazing silence.
Edith and Anne had screamed at the horrible sight of the dying Millie; and certainly I had made enough clatter snatching apart the bed.
Yet the house stood unaroused darkly silent.
Where were all its other occupants Two maniac girls, still locked, doubtless, in their bedroom, up here at the other end of the hall.
But Rolf Forrest?
Mrs. Groff?
Emil Groff and Ludvig?
One of them, Millie had said, was murdered.
But the others?
Where were they now, that my commotion had not aroused them?
Had, they vanislied, like spectres?
Or, like Siillie, were tliey all lyir^ here somewhere murdered?
All but one!
And that one, somewhere here, was lurkiflg.
From the stairs I could see faint shafts of moonlight now dimly illumining the lower hall.
No one nothing down there I stood on the stairs with tlie heavy bedrail poised, straining my hearii^ as though by force of wffi I could penetrate the silence and hear this monstrous adversary.
At the bottom of the steps I stood peering.
Wan, eerie patches of moonliglit by the windows and so many shadows everywhere, each of which might hold the lurking monster.
There was a little moonlight glow by the wall telephone.
Witli every muscle alert, I went there, rested the heavy iron bar beside me and lifted the receiver.
Uncanny silence of the instrument, like the uncanny silence of the house.
No buzz of current no distant operator’s inquiring voice.
And then I saw the cut wires, dangling under the box.
The fiend had been here.
I could send no call for h^p.
With a deepened sense of terror I seized the bedrail and fled back up the stairs.
At the door of room, I rapped.
I called sliarply Jack let me in And as the words were still echoing, I felt my heart contract as though as icy hand were clutchihg it.
Silence.
A silence so fraught with horrible import that it whirled and blurred my senses.
“Edith!
Anne!
Let me in!
Edith!
Answer me, Edith Silence so horrible.
I pounded the door rattled its ktrob.
Then I stepped backward, half stumbling over the gruesome body of Millie and I lunged with the heavy bedrail.
The wooden casement that held the lock, smashed inward.
The door swung and went with it. little moonlit bedroom was empty.
The window, locked on the inside, was undisturbed, But Edith and Anne wwe gone.
A stark panic descended upon me in that terrible moment so that I lunged and flung aside the heap of bedding, shoved wildly at the bureau as though by some diabolic necromancy the two girls might still be here, though at a -glance I had seen they were not.
And then I saw where they had gone.
A panel of the wall showed a narrow slit a. slidir^ door here, which when closed was undiscemable.
But it was not quite closed now.
A doorway to some descending secret lair?
I shoved my fingers into the vertical opening; the panel slid sidewise and I launched myself through, brandishing the bedrail.
I was merely in the adjoining bedroom a duplicate of with a white iron bed unmade; moonlight through the closed window.
No one here.
I stooped, hurriedly searching.
No one.
Nothing.
The room’s single door was ajar; it admitted me back into the hall, only a few feet from body.
So great a terror was on me now that I was hardly conscious of rational reasoning.
Where had the fiend taken them?
Somewhere in this ghastly house Ludvig, lusting for pleasure; lusting for the white beauty of young womanhood.
The room up here in which the two maniac girls were confined Had the fiend taken Edith and Anne there?
Had the maniac girls come out and lured them I dashed to that other door.
It still was locked.
I listened, with ear to its panel.
No sound!
There was only my own panting breath and thumping heart.
With the bedrail, I burst in the door.
Ghastly scene.
Disheveled room of these maniac girls.
Filmy garments strewn and scattered.
A place of lusting pleasure, mute now with death Death everywhere in this house.
A gust of wind from the open window met me.
And there was enough moonlight glow so that I stood gaping at the silent, tragic scene.
The two maniac girls were here, white bodies scantily clothed, hair down.
One was sprawled on tlie floor with arms up on the all of the open window.
The other was beside her, one arm over her companion's hip.
Both of them dead.
Unmarked by violence.
For a moment I stood transfixed, peering down at them so pallid in the moonlight.
And I saw now their slim bodies revealed by death to be wasted to thinness.
Pitiful little creatures.
Maniacs only with this strange lusting spell which had been upon them.
Pinched thin cheeks under the rouge bodies in life consumed by the fire of their lusts so that now, in death, they seemed only pallid wraiths of womanhood.
And on botii; the contorted faces there was a frozen grimace, as though even in death they were trying wildly to laugh.
In that shocked moment, I saw also a curious aspect to these death postures.
A sort of stretching of the necks gaping, stretching mouths—as though the one at the window, realizing that death was upon her, had staggered here, flung up the sash and then fallen, and on the floor had again reached upward, stretching with her mouth for the air too late to save her.
Afid the odier, -weaker, had seemed to have been dragging herself My mind flung back.
That stench?
That perfume?
Indefinable It was here now, widening my nostrils.
The room was permeated with it, clinging, saturating tins carpet, these draperies.
For all the wind from tlie opened window, I smelled it now more strongly than ever before.
And with every breath I was conscious of a Itttle heady thrill to tny senses.
Gruesome lethal breaths that s«med to hold a lure as I suck©! them in a wild pleasure of the senses that could only end in death.
I gathered my wits.
Edith and Anne were not here.
I searched the room peered along the walls for some loose panel.
And tlten, brandishing the iron b^rail, futilely, for there seemed nothing but the dead remaming in this terrible house, I fled back to the hall.
The rightangle turn to the left was here, I dashed around it.
Was that a moving sliape, off there the along the Iiall?
I went with a wild run.
No it was nothing but my memory of that shadow I had pursued here just before supper.
I found myself at the head of the back stairs.
The at the bottom was partly open now, with a little moonlight glwing behind it.
Cautiously I descended.
Stopped to listen.
Only silence here.
At the I shoved the door, But it bumped something on the other sidesomething which partly yielded to my shov«.
The door moved wider, with a dim scraping on the floor behind it.
Like Millie, dragging herself Like I pushed myself through the door-opening.
I was in a small, back lower hall with a nearby window admitting moonlight.
Something was here on the floor at my feet I had shoved and moved it vdien I pushed the door.
Like Millie, Tlw huddled ]5ody of Emil Gfoff was lying here, weltering frwn a ghastly crimson slash that almost severed the throat.
This charnel house of death.
I rose erect.
I think vaguely I may liave heard a sound behind me but it was engulfed by a crash on ray Tho world seemed to split with a roar and a burst of brilliant light so that I was conscious only that the faedrail was clattering from my hand as fell.
Orgy of Death all my senses faded, there was for me nothing but a blank abyss of empty, soundless darkness.
Death itself may be like that.
But presently, after some nameless interval, I was aware that I was alive.
Dimly conscious, I could feel myseli lying on die floor, -with rope lashing my -wrists beliiod me and wrapped around my ankles.
My senses faded again, but I struggled this time to hold a little something w'hicli was Me.
In the blackness there w^as the sound of a panting breath.
The fiend was here; I could feel fingers tying the rope at my ankles.
The fabric of garments brushed me.
And I could hear the breathing that was the swift triumph of a frenzy aboirt to be consummated.
Then I was being carried- Half carried, half dragged, with head and shoulders raised and my legs trailing on the floor as this gibbering adversary tugged and panted with my six-foot bulk.
And sight dimly was coming to me.
Vague moonlight.
This was the narrow back hallway along which I was being dragged.
A door opened.
I -was jerked through, tumbled to what seemed the softness of a rug.
Strange smell here.
A perfume?
Distinctly a perfume now.
Exotic, aromatic smell, like some powerful incense burning here.
I heard the door slam closed.
And at my appearance, there had seaned the dim blurred sound of a girl’s terrified cry.
Edith Anne Memory of them snatched my senses to greater alertness.
I was conscious of a throbbing pain at the back of my head; my hair wet and matted, doubtless with blood.
But the horrible weakness was leaving me strength coming back to my limp muscles all my confused senses sharpening, clarifying.
I was in a dimly candlelit apartment, draped and shrouded.
Heavily carpeted; soft chairs couches wall rugs and hangings, great splashes of red and black velvet.
Macabre interior.
Paintings on the walls, with the flickering candelight vaguely disclosing their voluptuous nudities.
A guttural voice at my ear said “Oh, you are not dead.
That I hoped.”
A grim, gibbering chuckle unlioly laugh that had nothing of mirth in it but only horror.
“Then you sit here and watch.
You will enjoy this, before you die I saw above me the leering, malevolently vile face of Mrs. Groff.
Gargoyle woman fiend, with her bent thick body, like a gorilla of amazing strength.
The prim black taffeta dress was blood-soaked now.
She stood shaking, trembling with the frenzy of murderous, demoniac triumph.
“You sit here and watch.
Beside him myself being propped up like a bent bundle on the floor, with cushions behind me.
Another figure was here.
Ghastly shape, sagging here beside me.
I turned my head to regard it.
Rolf Forrest.
He sagged here, propped by cushions so that he could not fall but slumped with dangling head against his chest.
Grisly companion.
His face was livid, blood-streaked blood welled from a wound in his side a great slash which had ripped his shirt half from him, exposing his crimsoned flesh.
No, he was still breathing, faint gasping breaths of unconsciousness.
Swift disclosures.
No more than half a minute had passed since I was flung into this I heard again that girl's cry and with senses at last fully clarified, I saw across the long apartment in shadows beyond the candlelight, a broad couch of black and red drapes.
Edith and Anne were huddling there.
Unharmed, save by the extremity of tlieir terror, they crouched clinging to each other disheveled, with hair tumbling to their shoulders and their clothing half tom from them.
The thick gargoyle shape of Mrs. Groff swung away from me, and then came back.
Maniacal glittering eyes gibbering unholy laughter hideous face so frenzied now that it was contorted beyond semblance of either woman or man so that it was only a monster.
“You two will watch that will be pleasure indeed for us all.
Him I did not mean to kill ^not just yet, but he nuide me with his %hting She leered down at me and young Forrest then like a gorilla, she swayed away.
At the wall, where now she stopped for a I saw a row of huge upright steel cylinders, each tall as a naan, with a pressure-gage on top.
She opened their valves now.
In the sudden silence I could hear the gas hissing out to mingle with the perfume of the incense which drifted in a lazy cloud from a brazier on the table.
Then she was at the couch, where Edith and Anne lay, pawing at them with quivering hands.
“Oh, you are afraid of me?
Little beautiful ones you, so slim and dark and you, pale like white gold I tugged frantically, futilely at ray bonds.
Beside me the dying Rolf twitched and Anne shcank back before her clawa litde, as though he too were spurred to frenaied eflort.
Edith now was screaming as the vile Img pawed her.
*Trou are afraid of met You want me not to toudi youl But ^is is pleasure, little ones.
Tlie smgil of pleasure will be with us in a moment.
You hear it hiss? yoa begin to snidl it now?
You fed its caress'?
You must laugh now and be happy.
It ts the smell ®f laughter the intoxieadon of Imaghter the thrill of doing -everythmg yrair senses you to do and laughing femghk^— Raging maniac now.
And as I panted, jerking at the ropes that lasted me, I could fed niy nos^s diiatiug.
That little heady thrill to my senses with every I choked bade a grim laugh.
Godl Why coaid I laugh wliea horror tingled every fiber of me!
Then the en>oked, voice rose louder He laughed!
We must all laughl” Abruptly the caressing tone turned to rage* “And you resist me?
Yon will not lose your seises to the pleasures tliat are coming?
Because I am a woman?”
Suddeidy the claw-like liands swept up to her head.
The primly parted liair was snatidied away to become a wig, wildly flung across the room.
This demoniac fiend ^not a woman.
I saw his bullet head of close-clipped black hair and iiow with clawing hands he tore away the taffeta waist aiid wliite ruching so that from under it lus muscular hairy chest seemed to burst out, freed of its pinching garment.
“See, my beautiful dear ones He stood swaying before the couch, gorilla now indeed in every physical aspect.
“See?
The woman you thought m^ is gone Mrs. Groff gone never existing, I am Ludvig master of pleasure master of laughter the girls were screaming again as he readied to dutdi them, Ludvig!
My half drugged sens« whirled with complete realization.
This chamal house of death ^we, the living ^the only survivors now were all gathered here in this room of lust.
Ludvig!
Eftiil older brother, who masqueraded always as the wife of Dr. Emil Groff, to give a greater semblance of respectability to this supposed sanitorium to give him also a greater freedom wtffi the young girl patients who had been admitted here until with the spell of lusting laughter upon them, he could dlsdose himself as a man. diabolic sted cylinders?
Compressed oxygen!
Diltrted in the air, as norraahy we Iweathe h, oxygen is lifegiving.
I think, ill the case of father,, nstlung but pure oxygen was used, We later found the tubes under his bed, leading it from tanks at a distant part of the house.
He had gone to sleep, perhaps with a sedative.
His window had been ordered closed against the storm and then tlift oxygen had been introduced.
Strange device for murder.
An of the heart, whidi in the old man's case, Emil Groff had known would certainly kill Irim quickly.
And from the blood and tissues of sudi a murdered victim, the over-charge of pure oxygen quickly evapomte so tiiat no autopsy can discover the cause of death.
Unique murder plot.
Etnil Groff doubtless had been successful with it many times.
But the half-mad Ludvig was not interested.
What diabolic other gases he mixed with the oxygen to create in his girl victims the lust that enslaved them, has never been disclosed, I had almost overheard the murder of Emil, for unquestionably that quarrel at the foot
(rf the back stairs had led Ludvig to an impulsive slashing of his younger brother’s throat.
For Litdvig then, the die was cast.
Whatever vestige of reason he had ever possessed must have been swept into maniacal frenzy then, with his brother lying weltering before him, so that Ludvig saw only that he must kill every one here.
With me, perhaps his most feared antagonist still alive ^and Edith and Anne still with me ^his twisted brain must have told him to hide the evidence of the gas, so that he crept through the wall panel with which most of these rooms were equipped, opened old Mr. window, and verified that the old man was dead.
And with each ghastly murder frenzy was telling him that he was nearing undisturbed possession of Anne and Edith.
The culmination of his unholy lusts now was at hand.
The dim candlelit room here had once been a storeroom back of the kitchen equipped by Ludvig for the lair of his orgies.
And he was laughing now, with his triumph so near.
"You feel it now, little white beauties?
You breathe its thrill?
Intoxicating pleasure And I could feel it now, more overwhelming with every breath.
A exultant pound of my heart.
A wild sense of power.
Desires stirring in me an intoxication of the senses a falling away of shackles of restraint which always before had been upon me and my animal desires God!
Was I laughing?
Was that wild laiigh of intoxication ringing out mingled with her half-choked screams of horror?
I saw the hideous monstrous form of the half clothed Ludvig reaching across the couch the white, intoxicated, shuddering girls all the pounding wildness of my new-found strength, still the damnable rope was holding me.
My lunges bumped the body of Rolf Forrest.
He slumped against me.
His contorted face twitched not quite dead, for the oxygen was bringing a last little strength to hold death away a moment Icmger.
And what was this almost vacant eyes imploring me?
A little twitch at my lashed wrists behind me!
His dying, twitching fingers with a little stimulated strength in tltem, plucking at my bonds!
His numbing brain with death creeping into it, still could direct his twitching fingers Then the death rattle was in his throat a shudder swept him a twitching, and then he slumped and fell forward on his face and lay motionless.
I jerked and found that my arms were free.
I fumbled at my ankles, tast off the last of the rope and sprang erect.
Ludvig did not see me as I bounded the twenty feet across the heavy red carpet.
He was sprawled forward on the couch, laugiiing, pawing.
With a last bound, like a pouncing animal I was on him ^lifting his hideous, vile little body with all the amazing power of my intoxicated strength, so that I shook him as though he were a gigantic rat and whirled and pounded his gargoyle head aginst the nearest of the steel cylinders.
Pounded— and laughed with my own wild unholy laughter until his head cracked and I cast him dead upon the floor.
“Edith!
Anne come With my arms around them, we ran, slamming the door upon the ghastly room.
And up in the house I wrapped their shuddering bodies in blankets, and we sat through the night, waiting for the dawn. of tke Rolseri Bladkmon

Mary Bellam had told Stanley that-her Uncle John Bellam, owner of Greater Circus, was recovering from a skin disorder, but the warning had not prepared the. young lawyer for anything like this.
He must have shuddered, for warm hands tightened reassuringly upon his arm.
“Mary has chosen well.”
The words hissed from lips.
His cold eyes moved slowly from polished shoes to the strong breadth of his shoulders, the firm set of his well-slaaped head.

"Sorry to frighten you, but we’re not sure about ^this.”
His right hand slid across his chest, moving with the slow grace of a reptile.
Greater Circus specializes in giant pythons and boas.
I have always loved snakes.
Since this happened a month ago, wondered if handling the big snakes could have He stopped as the door behind Stanley and Mary opened.
Stanley turned, and gulped as a squat, misshapen man waddled into the room.
The man’s big eyes, bulging almost level with jutting brows, slid over him, then flicked to the bed.
He was strangely nervous and frightened.
“You call, Misser Bdla’?”
His voice was a throaty croak.
“No.” tongue darted out to moisten pale lips.
“Mr. Austin, this is Shagar.
He was my snake-man until a maddened python attacked him.” glittering eyes seemed to mock the squat figure beside the bed.
“Shagar hates snakes.
Oddly, he believes I am becoming a giant python.” rustling chuckle made scalp tighten. believe Shagar hates me for gnarled fingers clasped nervously.

“Uncle John!”

"Your pardon, Mary.”
Suddenly lam’s voice was mild and lulling.
“Where is Elbert, Shagar?”
“He he go see dog.”
The twisted body seemed to shrink.

“Something ketch dog back of cottage.”
Shagar said, squirming nervously, his bulging eyes wide with terror.
“It it squeeze dog dead.”
His voice dropped to a terrified whisper.
“It kill like big python t” “Python!”
Breath whistled shrilly from slitted nostrils. fear froze his thin, scaled features, and his voice was the voice of a damned being.
“Merciful God, have I already “Hello, everybody The nasal voice came from behind Stanley.
He swung about and saw a well-built man of about thirty standing in the open doorway.
The newcomer was tall and muscular, and his sleek hair glistened in the afternoon light coming from the open front door at the end of the hall.
“Oh, pardon me.”
His black eyes appraised Stanley. know we had company.”
“Mr. Weiss, this is Stan Stanley Austin,” Mary said, and clung tightly to arm.
“Congrats and all that, Stan. lucky.”
The pressure of Weiss’ hand upon was quick and strong.

“Heard you was sick, John, so I come to see you.” big feet slapped the floor toward the bed.
His little, piggish eyes swept Stanley from head to foot.
Mary introduced them.
"Glad to know any guy Mary knows.”
Kelley grinned and turned to the bed.
"Now, John “Herman Kelley The words spat from lips.
He drew away from the rival show owner like a snake settling to strike.
“If you’ve come up here to “Easy, John,” said Kelley, spreading a beefy hand.
"My show’s playing Maxton, four miles over the hills.

“Holy cats, John!

Elbert moved toward the thing.

He could hear Shagar waddling behind him. twisted snake-man was muttering viciously beneath his breath.
They reached the crushed carcass, and a strange mingfing of nausea and fear gripped Stanley Austin.
Tlie animal had been a well-developed German dog.
Now it was but a horribly shapeless mass ©f blood-dotted fiir.
A throaty croak made scalp tighten before he realized the sound was coming frexn Shagar.
The crippled snakeman was staring down at the crushed dog, his bulging eyes glazed with horror.

Elbert Weiss’ laugh was strained.
He wetted his lips nervously, “Forget the crazy stuff.”
He seemed fordbly tq tear his black eyes from the dog’s crushed body. got to get that python.

Stanley, you'd better go to the little ing about a quarter -mile down the valley.
If the python comes near you, sing out.
Shagar and be witli you in two minutes. going up the valley and work back.
We ought to have a few more men, but Well, let’s go.”
Elbert stalked off through the trees, heading toward the left.
Still muttering, Shagar waddled past the dog's carcass and headed across the valley.
Stanley could hear him slipping on the pine needles after his twisted figure had disappeared behind the trees.
The young lawyer started down the valley, his muscular fingers tight about the short club he had picked up near the cottage.
Elbert had said the python would be unlikely to measure over eighteen feet, and it would undoubtedly be sluggish, half-dormant.
Yet A tight smile touched firm lips as he moved forward cautiously, brown eyes probing the trees and brush about him.
The pines thinned and disappeared after he had walked a few moments.
Stanley was coming into a small, irregular clearing, rimmed with the scrubby trees and underbrush.
Afternoon sunlight made the place look almost cheery, yet strange thoughts thrust into mind.
Was John Bellam actually being transformed into a reptile Were those ghastly scales upon his skin but a forerunner of the horror to come?
Had Bellam, as Shagar charged, deliberately prodded the python into attacking the snake-man?
Could the strangely reptilian circus owner actually talk with snakes, speak their hissing language?
Had the police dc^ been attacked by tlie python that liad escaped from Shows, or had it been crushed by ^John Bellam whose thin, scaled body was snakelike in its A derisive laugh burst from lips.
He was letting the queer happenings break his nerve.
The whole thing was sane enough just a skin disease, a crippled and half-mad snake-man and an escaped python.
Yet Underbrush rustled nearby, and every muscle in his bbdy snapped taut.
His fingers went white about the short club.
Bleak with a sudden, almost numbing fear, his brown eyes probed between the surrounding trees.
A slight movement caught his eyes, then a small bird darted up from the ground.
The lawyer relaxed, and grunted as he realized that the muscles of fais jaws ached.
Resolutely, he started to whistle, but he stopped as he recalled reading somewhere that reptiles were peculiarly steceptible to shrill noises.
Damn circuses and snakes!
After he and Mary were married Sudden horror held Stanley motionless, and the abrupt poimding of his heart all but drowned the shrill scream ringing in the narrow, wooded valley.
It was the terrified scream of a man in the maddening throes of infinite agony.
It came again.
Stanley stood rigid.
The cry was coming from the r^t side of the valley.
It knifed his eardrums again, dien stopped, choking short with a gurgling moan.
For a moment the valley was gripped in awful silence.
Then Stanley heard a heavy body breaking through the brush to his left.
“Shagar!
Weiss!”
His voice sounded queer shrill in his ears.
He broke into a stumbling run toward the sound, his fingers glued to the short club in his right hand.
Swaying tree branches plucked at his clothing.
Underbrush whipped at his legs.
Yet he stumbled on, the horrible cry still echoing in his brain.
After a few moments he stopped, every faculty concentrated on listening.
The noise of breakii^ brush had ceased, and there was no sound but the throb of blood in his ears, the eerie whisper of wind in the trees about him.
He moved forward cautiously, his aching eyes probing the brush.
A shapeless mass upon the ground some distance ahead drew his gaze like a magnet.
Cold horror swelled in his brain, waves of *ausea swept over him and the dread certainty that the shape was human grew in his mind.
Gritting hie teeth to steady jerking nerves, he forced himself toward the ghastly shape.
It was a man a man whose body was crusted into a mocking travesty of a human form.
There were no definable outlines to the horribly shapeless mass.
It was but a ghastly huddle of crushed flesh, bone and btood-soaked clothing.
Controlling himself with an effort, Staidey forced himself to examine the thing.
It was Shagar, the crippled snakeman. features were bloated.
His colorless eyes had burst from their sockets horrible globes pendant from red veins and muscles.
Trickles of blood streaked his cheeks.
His mouth was fixed in a grimace of agony.
The side of his head was bruised.
His body was a blood-seeping pulp.
John mad words flashed into diilled mind as he stared down at the crushed snake-man.
‘The stunning impact of a lightning thrust from overhanging branches, the anesthesia of fear!
Then coil after coil of steel-cabled body Stanley spun, his right fist white about the short dub, a>ld prickles racing along his spine. had moved in the trees behind him.
He heard it again, then saw the figure of a man coming through the underbrush.
“Stanly I Shagar cried Elbert Weiss.
He broke from the trees and ran toward Stanley, his face deathly pale.
"My God, Stanleyl glad you’re unhurt! heard He saw crushed body behind the young lawyer and his black eyes went wide, filled with horror.
"It it ^got Shagar!
I was afraid it was you.
I He raked sweat from his forehead with shaking fingers.
He stopped, froze into an attitude of listening, then Stanley heard some one l^owing through tlie brush toward them.
“Hil Shagar!” shouted Herman big voice.
In a moment the showman came into sight, his b% body crashing toward them.
"Heard a gosh-awful screech aud thought mebbe better see what's what.
You got any id«i what—" Then Kelley saw pulped body.
“Holy God His voice was but a hoarse croak.
"The pytlion “Your python!"
Elbert Weiss’ voice was brittle.
"My python, hell!
I give the snake to John!"
Kelley whipped about with surprising swiftness and gripped Stanley arm.
"You \vas a witness, Austin!
You got to say I give the snake to John!
I ainot responsible for this!”
His bulging eyes fought clear of crushed figure, you happen to come up here?”
Swift tljoughts clicked in mind.
"You canot pull me in on this!" roared Kelley, big hands clenching. left the cottage, stopped at the store and talked a bit.”
"Miss Mary come in and I left, started across the valley in my car.
Then I heard the screech and come up and "You saw Mary Bellam at the store!"
'The words exploded from lips.
“Sure.
She musta come down after something.
It ainot but a half-mile from the cottage to Kelley stalled, bulging eyes following Stanley as the young lawyer whipped past him, moving with a swift, ground-eatihg stride. you "To tlie cottage!”
Stanley flung the words over his shoulder.
"John up there alone, and out where that python can attack her He increased his pace to a run, heard Kelley and Weiss pounding after him.
Reaching the cottage, Stanley crossed the front porch, legs stiff, cold horror gnawing at his heart.
The place was quiet with a queerly sinister silence.
Kelley and Weiss burst from the trees about the cottage and trotted toward the porch.
"Mary Mr. Bellam The silent, empty cottage seemed to engulf call.
There was no answering sound.
He pushed through the open doorway, striding toward the door to the room.
He heard Weiss and Kelley on the front porch. room door was open, and Stanley saw the bed at the first glance.
It was empty, the covers thrown back.
There was no sign of thin, scaled figure.
Mad thoughts churned in mind.
"We got to get together on this thing, Elbert bull voice drifted in from the porch, Weiss’ nasal tones answered. now a case of getting Weiss stopped, then his voice was shrill and high.
Mary now, coming up tlie Stanley reached the front door as the car neared the cottage.
Kelley and Weiss were running toward the road.
Mary Bellam seemed lost behind the wheel of the big sedan.
Her blue eyes went big and frightened as she braked the car to a stop.
Weiss and Kelley crowded to the opened left window.
Stanley strode across the porch, ran toward the car.
"Why did you leave Mr. Bellam?”
Elbert Weiss was reaching for the door handle.
Stanley caught his arm and pulled him away.
"You heard me give the damn’ snake to John, Mary big head was thrust through the opened window.
"You got to witness.” muscular hand upon his shoulder stopped him.
The yotmg lawyer pulled Kelley away from the car.
"Take it easy, you two!”
"Stan!
Something terrible has happened!” slim hands were warm on wrist.
"Uncle John sent me to the store for cigars.
Something has happened to him!
Tell me, Stan!”
She pushed the car door open and stepped to the road, frightened eyes seeking the cottage door. gone!” blurted Weiss, long fingers clasping nervously.
"The python killed Shagar!”
"Oh Mary swayed against Stanley.
A dry sob choked in her throat.
"Weiss,” said Stanley as his arm tightened about quivering shoulders, "suppose you take the car and notify the Sheriff and coroner.”
"Coroner, hell bellowed Kelley.
"We donot want law in this yet! find Bellam and the python, then holler cop. ril get a gang of show-hands.”
Before either Stanley or Weiss could stop him, Kelley was in the Bellam sedan and had it swinging about, heading down the valley in a cloud of dust.
"Why, the dirty Burning anger flamed in Elbert Weiss’ black eyes as he stared at the speeding car.
A deep frown creased broad forehead and his lips tightened grimly as he watched the sedan disappear around a turn.
Herman Kelley was after Greater Circus.
He had been in the valley when Shagar screamed.
Could the beefy showman have planned to murder all but one of heirs before killing Bellam himself, then buy the show from the survivor Kelley didnot want the police yet.
Could that mean he was using his supposed trip to Maxton £or show-hands as atover for another murder?
Was John Bellam alive, or had Kelley watched the cottage, waited Bdlam was alone, then “Elbert Austin faint cry was coming from the narrow valley behind the mountain cottage, ^d the eerie tones seemed to pluck with chill fingers at nerves.
"It it’s Uncle John!”
Mary clutching fingers dug into arm.
Elbert^ Weiss was already running toward the sound.
Stanley started after him, Mary dragging at his arm, and as they sped toward the narrow, wooded valley behind die cottage, a dread certainty grew in mind.
Each one of these strange happenings was but part of a mad plan.
Each incident was leading to a hideous, death-filled climax.
“Mr. Bellam!”
He heard Elbert Weiss running through the brush ahead.
Mary was stumbling, panting at hife side.
“Stanley!
Elbert!”
John shrill cry came from di^tiy to the left.
Stanley clianged his course, Elbert Weiss, helping Mary through the entangling underbrush.
Then they saw the tliin, pajama-clad figure of John Bellam ahead through the trees, and Stanley thought of a horrible, half-reptile creature wandering in the wooded valley. reached the circus owner, and again revulsion swept over Stanley Austin as he looked at the dry, scale-like flakes of dead cuticle on skin.
A queer tightening came into the young lawyer’s body.
“Something has happened to Shagar!” narrow head thrust forward as he hissed the words the head of a scaled reptile upon a thin, upright body. heard him scream It was like his scream when he was attacked by tlie python!”
Bdkm pawed at his narrow forehead, and the dry rasp of scales sent prickles of horror through tight scalp.
“Circus £dks feel death.” ophidian eyes were unnaturally bright and uiiwinkiug. knovif Shagar is dead!”
His thin body swayed, a queer, sinuous movement.
“Take me to his body.”
Stanley Austin felt the hair rising upon his head.
Bellam had sent Mary away from the cottage.
He had been alone.
He hated Shagar, had according to the crippled snake-man prodded a python into attacking him before. could have slipped from the cottage, crossed the valley and Stanley shuddered.
Shagar liad said Bellam was half-snake, could talk the hissing language of serpents.
Shagar had predicted his own death in the crushing coils of a snake!
He had said that Bellam would be that serpent.
Had the crippled snake-man possessed some horrible, secret knowledge about John Bellam?
Had he been crushed because of that knowledge “Take me to Shagar.”
John tlim figure weaved in a loathswne, serpentine movement.
His sharp tongue licked pale lips avidly.
A queer, hungry gleam burned in his unwinking eyes.
His cold, fixed stare fastened upon Elbert Weiss.
“Take me to Shagar, Elbert,” he commanded hissingly.
Weiss lifted muscular shoulders in an expressive shrug, turned and started off through the trees, heading for the spot where Stanley had found the crippled horribly crushed body.
Muscles hard with a strange tautness, Stanley followed.
Mary walked at his side, her trembling hands clutching his arm.
The sinking sun painted darkening shadows in the narrow A slight evening breeze had started, and faint, eerie whispers drifted through the stopped, warned by something he could not define.
Quickening blood pumped in his ears.
His lips felt parched and dry.
His right hand clenched then he remembered he had dropped his short club near the cottage.
Beside him, Mary Bellam stood stiffly, her frightened breath shrill in his ears.
He could feel her slim figure trembling against him.
His bleak eyes probed the trees ahead.
Then the something which had warned him became apparent.
Elbert Weiss and John Bellamys thin, pajama-clad figure were nowhere in sight.
No sound came from the trees and brush ahead.
Slowly, Stanley moved forward, fingers knotted into hard fists.
Mary walked at his side, held silent by his tenseness.
As they passed a low mass of brush Stanley heard a furtive rustle behind him.
Chilled breath stopped in his throat.
The skin of his back crawled with sudden, numbing horror, and John strange words flashed into his mind.
“The stunning impact of a lightning thrust from overhanging branches, the anesthesia of fear!
Then coil after coil of steel-cabled body Instinctively he pushed Mary away from him and svmng about, his fists knotted. around he was aware of a vague something lashing out from the brush.
A smashing weight crashed into the side of his head.
Lights flamed within his skull. terrified scream reached his ears, seeming to come from an incredible distance.
A sable pall tightened about him.
Something hard and round encircled his body, yet he couldnot move, couldnot scream the terror swelling in his lungs.
Merciful unconsciousness engulfed him. became aware of a strange, acrid smell, a nerve-tightening odor that had a rank, corrosive quality about it.
It was somehow unutterably slimy and unclean.
Then abruptiy he knew what it was the nauseous stench of reptiles His eyes snapped open and a startled cry ruslied to his lips, and stopped.
He was gagged, bound hand and foot, and lying upon the rough stone floor of a large cave.
To his right, he could see Mary slim figure.
The girl was also bound, and a gag bit into the soft flesh of her cheeks.
She was unconscious, her eyes closed.
Still dazed by the blow upon his head, Stanley looked about him.
Farther toward the back of the cavern was a queer structure of heavy beams and coils of heavy, hawser-like rope.
He saw a powerful hydraulic jack.
The shadowy figure of a man was crouched behind the crude machine. eyes swept past the man, drawn irresistibly toward the back of the cave, then the noisome gag between his teeth flung back the scream of horror that tried to burst from his tight lungs.
The dusky shadows at the back of the cavern held the coiled bulk of a giant python He could see the sinuous coils of its huge, scaled body, the blynt triangle of its head.
Its eyes made tiny points of light in the shadows.
It seemed dormant.
Yet there was a certain pulsing of life about the giant bulk. eyes swung back to the crouched shape of the man, the crude machine, and the hideous solution of the whole mad scheme burst like a blinding flame within his brain.
He knew now the purpose of the ropes and beams, knew the identity of the kneeling man.
A ghastly vision of crushed body swam before his eyes.
He knew now why he and Mary had been brought to this cavern.
Frantically, he tried to burst free of the ropes about his wrists.
Warm blood crawled upon his skin as the rough hemp bit into his flesh.
He saw now that a man’s head thrust above the coils of rope between the heavy beams.
The features were all but obscured by the thick folds of a gag, yet Stanley knew who it was John Bellam!
Stanley threw every ounce of his strength into straining against the ropes, but they held fast.
A groan of despair forced from his tiglit lips.
Warned by the sound, the figure crouched beltmd the machine straightened, turned.
Stanley knew his identic before he rose.
It was Elbert Weiss.
^‘Wdll.
Well. brave lover is awake.”
A hacking laugh rasped from Weis* leering mouth.
^id his find plenty whai they come back.”
Weiss bent, released the big hydraulic jack, and the thick ropes about thin figure loosened.
He pulled the sliapeless mass that had been body from the madiine, flung it over his shoulder and stalked toward the front of the cave. find Bellam and you crashed by the 'python’ and they’ll find body in the coils of my prize beauty He jerked his head tovrard the rear of the cave. will own Circus.
In a few months Kelley and I will consolidate the Greatest and Biggest Siiow <m Earth, and own half of it!”
Chuckling throatily, Weiss strode out of the cave, carrying crushed figure.
Stanley tore at the ropes about his wrists, a rising sense of defeat beating at his mind.
Bellam was already dead, crushed in the liydraulic He and Mary would be next.
Grinding his teeth into the wadded cloth in his moutti, Stanley tried to push the gag free, tried to shout.
Then he heard Weiss returning. my turn now.

Weiss stalked to bound figure and stared down at her, black eyes flaming with mad hate. eyes snapped open, filled with terror as she saw him. looked on me as a bum and a common circus Imnd ever since been wth always avoided me, but you canot now.”
Weiss’ voice dripped venom.
“Within ten minutes, you’ll be dead and own Show.
Shagar was easy.
He died without a struggle in my machine, but saving the live snake for you.
Miss Bellam! watch and laugh as It crushes you.
Your lover can watch too, but he wonot laugh. be fighting the ropes in my mechanical python I After you two are dead, put you and the python in the for Kelley and his men to find. be at the other end of the valley, hunting for you.”
Picking the girl from the floor, Weiss carried her to the back of the cavern, dropped her upon the coiled python and stepped back, a mad, snarling laugh from his lips.
The huge serpent’s angry hiss filled the cave, and eyes widened with horror as he saw the deadly mottled body sliding about Mary, enfolding her in its ghastly embrace.
The young lawyer exploded in a mad effort to burst the ropes about his hands, dropped back his tortured muscles rebelled under the strain.
The pj'thon had looped two coils about slim figure, one about her waist, the other abotrt the fresh plumpness of her breasts.
The girl was paralyzed with terror the anesthesia of fear.
Stanley tried to jerk erect, and a sharp projection of rock beneath him gouged into his pressing hands, cutting the flesh.
Abruptly, he stiffened and new hope flashed into his mind.
Feverishly, he latruned his bound wrists on the sliarp rock, and a sob caught in his throat as the benrp snagged on the projection.
In less than a raimite several strands of the rope had parted.
Weiss was standing near the pjrthon, unholy ndcrest glraming in hfe black eyes as he watched the snake cotlitig about the girl.
The serpent’s mottled body wtis waving slowly about Mary.

Madly he clawed free of the bomk, lurched to his span and irurlcd his tall figure at Stanley as the latter stinnbfed Mary Bellani.
The young lawyer met his rush with a flying right fist that barbed squarely on Weiss' mouth.
The mad killer swung his feet in a vicious kick that raised skin from shins. right fist stabbed at Weiss’ face again, connected, and a sharp, grinding pain shot up to the lawyer’s right as he felt hot blood gush over his knurides.
Weiss shot toward tlie ba^ of the cave as thouglt catapulted, his muscular body squirming as he tried to keep his balance.
He smashed into the rock wall and dropped to the floor, still squirming.
Stenley lunged for the hissing python Weiss* statement ckmoring in his brain.
A man could handle tlie big snake Ks stiff fingers toudied the reptile, and the scafy feel of its body sent waves of horror through his Ihfte figure.
Tearing frantically at the engulfing coils, he freed holders, stabbed at the reptile’s weaving bead witli bloody hands.

A qoidc gianced showed him Elbert Weiss ndling over, trying to get to his feet, but Stanley strode on, Mary Bellam mhtsarms.
The sound of underbrush in the woods nearby stopped him at the cave mouth and in a second he saw Herman big bulk plowing through the bushes toward the cave.
Six thick-shoulcfered Ipirities buret from the woods behind the big show-owner.
All them carried ropes and eltdis.
“Hi, Stan!

I waited, there in the sitting room of Liu Ti, for him to tell me why he had asked me to come. have come to him around the world, and he knew it.
For forty years my father had been his friend, and his father’s friend, in China.
Liu Ti and my father had been blood-brothers, had mingled their blood from cuts in their strong right forearmsv too, knew China.
I had spent all of my boyhood and most of my young man107 A Weirdly Moving Novelette Chftrged With the Ominous Mystery of the East hood there, and had learned to love it.
“It is a dangerous thing I am asking you to do, Gordon Bais,” said Liu Ti.
I didnot answer.
I looked at his niece, gorgeous Liu Mei, and knew that it had to do with her.
Did she know my secret, this Liu Mei?
Did Kwan Tao know it?
Kwan Tao, the dusky, stalwart young Chinese who stood beside her I doubted it.
I had never told it to a soul, though Liu Mei must have read it in my eyes.
We had been children together, had almost grown up together.
Her father had married one of Liu sisters, and her father had been an American.
In the eyes of her world and mine, she was an Eurasian, neither Chinese nor “foreign”.
I looked at her and thought of how cruel people could be to one another.
"In the veins of my niece,” said Liu Ti, almost in a whisper, "runs the proud blood of kings.”
She was the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen.
Her hair and eyes were black and she bad the delicate beauty which must have been that of Kwan Yin, Goddess of Mercy, when she had been a mortal, walking the earth. am ready to do anything, old friend,” I said to Liu Ti. know.
There has always been a bond between us, and between thee and Liu Mei.
You played together as children.
Now, Gordon Bais, take her away and cherish her!”
I gasped in amazement.
I think my surprise must have made me look ridiculous.
"But Kwan Tao, to whom you have promised her “It can not come to pass, just now.
Gordon, a shadow of which I can give you but the slightest hint hangs over the houses of Liu and Kwan.
It means death I It whispers in the wind across the windows.
It sighs in the fog.
It moans in the sounds from the river.
Take her away with you, quickly.
For you, an American, it may be possible.”
I looked at Liu Mei.
Just to meet her eyes had countless times caused my heart almost to stop beating.
She didnot smile.
Her lips were white, and terror was in her face as it was in the eyes of Liu Ti, and Kwan Tao.
There were beads of sweat on the forehead of Liu Ti, and he was of the old school, one of those whose faces did not cliange, even under torture "If asked you, Gordon,” said Liu Mei herself.
"Anything, Runt,” I said, "you know that.”
Fd called her “Runt” when we had been brats together in Canton.
“But what of Kwan Tao I looked at her fiance, trying to figure it out Liu Ti spoke again.
“It is better you did not know.
Liu Mei knows little, which she may tell you when she is safely away with one who loves her.
Later, perhaps, Kwan Tao The weirdness of Chinatown, of China transplanted, chilled me.
Again I was conscious of the dismal foghorns, of the creepy mist that swathed the windows, of the strange music from the heart of Chinatown.
“Nobody will bother a foreigner, behind whom is the threat of the foreign police,” said Liu Ti.
“You will go forth unmolested.
It will be thought that because all of the blood in her veins is not Chinese, I have <ast her out, to become a member of her father’s people.”
I could see the scheme then, and it seemed mad; yet, perhaps, the only one that might work.
And I knew something of the frightful fury of nameless “shadows” in Chinatown. shall guard her, until I have word from you, as though she were my sister which, almost, she is.”
“It was knowing this that made me send for you.
I have never asked before.”
A Liu Mel, tali for a Chinese girl, dressed in Occidental garb, came to me then, smiling a little, and gave me her hand.
How soft it wasl It made me think of a beating heart, a bird’s heart perhaps, beating in the palm of the bird’s captor.
And after Liu Mei came Kwan Tao, with a firm handshake whidi said more than any words he could have irttered. beating of my own heart almost suffocated me as I stepped into the Iiallway with Liu Mei.
And there was sorrow, too, that was deeper than the wells of Shallaja!.
I would have given my life for girl.
I could understand the gr^t love, defying all prejudice, all conventions, which must have bound this girl’s father to her mother.
And now both were dead, and Liu Mei dwelt in the house of her aiid bore his name.
She put her liand on my arm as we walked to tlte electric elevator, Liu establislnnent, combination office and residence, was of five stories, and the stairs were almost never used for travel between floors.
It suffocated me, almost, to stand in the tiny elevator with Liu Mei.
Surely she must Imow, and lier eyes told me that she did that she knew she might never mention it.
I would never dare.
And because I would never dare I blurted out always loved you, Liu Mei.
My greatest desire is for your happiness.”
She was very close to me then, and her hand was still on my arm.
Her perfume was in my nostrils, like the radiant ghost of herself that might go with me always.
Her eyes told me that she had always known.
Was it fancy, or did I see, deep down in their depths, some hint of love returned?
I shook my head, in the shock of the near revelation, to drive away the image of tlie happiness that might have been ours were it not for the barriers of blood.
“Tliere will never be another, Liu Mei,” I said.
I pressed the button for the first floor, and the cage started down.
Liu Mei, as we passed tlie fourth floor, reached out her hand and turned off the light in the cage.
I was alone in the dark with the woman of all women, whom I loved, and for a moment, as the <age went creaking down, the knowledge hdd me paralyzed.
I had looked at my watch, from force of habit, when we had entered the cage.
Ten minutes after eleven at night.
By eleven-thir^ I would have taken Liu Mei to safety.
Then I must bear my own strange cross in patience until she was taken from me Her hand had dropped from my arm, as though she were afraid of what I might do in my madness, and I locked my lips tightly on whatever else desperation might have made me say.
The first floor was just below us.
I snapped on the light again, mustered a smile, and turned to lead her forth when the cage stopped.
I couldnot believe my eyes.
The cage hadnot stopped moving, I would have sworn to.tliat, but Lfu Md was not with me!
She had vanished, out of a moving elevator, as though she had turned to fog and eddied out through the grills into the shaft.
Nor was that all.
Five stalwart men in hideous devil masks had taken her place.
I stared at them in amazement.
It couldnot be ^yet it was.
Somewhere along the route from the fifth floor to the first Liu Mei had vanished and the five had taken her place.
And the cage hadnot stopped moving.
It had been magic.
“Where is she?”
I demanded in shrill, frightened Cantonese.
“Gone said one.
“And it is an order that the meddling foreigner be punished, so that never again will he be tempted to meddle.”
The speaker pressed the button again, and the cage started to ascend.
They stopped it between the third and fourth floors.
As we went up I snapped a glance at my watch.
It said eleven-thirty!
The cage, bearing Liu Mei and myself, had been twenty minutes descending The speaker turned out the light.
I must have been paralyzed with fear and surprise, for I didnot even offer resistance.
In the dark the hands of the “devils” began upon me.
Their feet came into use, too.
They kicked me.
They clawed me.
They battered away at me.
They ripped clothing from me with their knives.
Finally, when it seemed I could stand the agony no longer, something heavy struck the top of my head.
The cage was filled with shooting stars as the bottom seemed to fall out of it, dropping me headlong into the shaft, where I struck to find oblivion, black as the deepest night.
When I regained consciousness I was sprawled outside the elevator on the ground floor.
The outer door, of course, was closed.
Fog seeped through under it, to be absorbed by the lights.
I was alone in a building filled with echoes and horror.
My hellish assailants were gone.
I staggered to my feet.
My head was splitting.
I ached in every bone and muscle.
I vras a six-footer who should have been able to put up a terrific battle, but the five had handled me with ease, giving me the most brutal beating any man had ever had to take.
The seeming miracle of the twentyminute descent, the vanishing of Liu Mei, the appearance of the five, did not puzzle me as it might have any one who did not know the potentialities of Chinese master mummers as I did.
I didnot leave, though, as the five, or those who had sent them, must have expected.
They did not know my feeling for Liu Mei, which would have sent me Into the pit itself.
I rang for ffie elevator again.
I crawled into it, wondering what sort of hell would breathe its brimstone into it this time, and went back to the fifth floor.
The door to the apartment of Liu Ti was open.
I crossed the threshold my terror mounting.
There was nobody here but Liu Ti, and what I might have said to him would never now be said.
He was dead.
He hung by a silken cord from a beam of his living room.
His face was a mask of horror.
His bulging eyes stared right at me, as though he said: "By the bond which existed between yovr father and me, Gordon Bais, I command you to stand by my niece and her betrothed until the end!"
Tiny Shoes carefully and reverently I cut the cord which hung Liu Ti to the beam and lowered him to the floor.
I had closed the outer door.
Then I now went, systematically, through all the rooms.
Not another soul was in the place, living or dead.
Yet he had had a sister here, a wife, and a brother.
Now all were gone.
And by being my father’s son, was a part of this family!
I had been spared, I knew, because I was not Chinese.
But if I did not refrain from meddling, my recent captors had said, and had provtti by their manhandling, my white blood would not save me from their sinister designs.
Right now, I could have sworn, scores of eyes were watching me, studying me, waiting The family of Liu Ti was gone.
He at least, would never know if I went out, this very minute, into the street, and left Chinatown never to return.
What had I to do with the Chinese?
Maybe, in the final analysis, I loved that part of Liu A Mei which was of my own race.
Maybe I was blinded by my love of Oiina, where I had spent so many years.
Maybe, wlien my own pec^le looked upon love between the races with revclsion, they were r^ht.
Maybe Well, if I went away now I was safe.
They had safd so.
If I st^»ed, the beating I had taken would be horribly littfe compared to what ^y could do to me.
But, Lla father had been white, and ray own father’s friend, I knew what my dad, if he had been Iivlog> would have done.
And knew what my own heart dictated.
I stooped over Liu Ti, then, aad whirred: "They wonot get away with it, I said. while Hp couldnot hear me, of course or could he?
His face didnot diai^e expre^on, but somehow I knew th^ he knewh--had, perhaps, known from the begimiang. belb, the love between Mei and me xvas the sort of thft^ whidi ndgbl devefbp between a*^ boy and girt vdio, rear^ tt^ether, had never been allowed to know what the outside wortd of what it cruelly cafied "mfcced love".
It was just that, nothing more.
To me she was a Chinese, and the sooner I forgot about her, the better.
But even as these traitorous thoughts went through my brain, like black flashes, I seemed to see Liu Mei standing befons me, her eyes calm, filled with the bnowkdge of the ages, as th^ stared into mine and said: ‘Tt isnot like you, Gordon And it wasnot.
Why should human beings draw back from one another because of race, or color, or rel^on?
I knew then that nothing ever change me, not even when the time came, as it would, when I would be put to torture for my meddling.
Without a backward glance I hurried from the room of Liu Ti and into the hallway I had last traversed with Liu Mei.
"Somewhere between the fourth ftooi and the fi^rst," I told myself, "the strange thing happened; I must find which floor, ril start with the fourth."
For it was there that Liu Mei, afraid of being spied upon, had turned out the ligjit.
I went down in the devator.
It pleased me to defy the enemy tn thfs much at least.
I sti^ped at the fourth floor and got out, shutting the door behind me.
I was in another hallway, brilliantly Itghted.
I began to move along it, my eyes studying every inch of space.
I had the feeling that somehow Liu Mei woidd drop something dial would let me know, that would point the way to the place I might find her.
But there was I went back to the elevator.
I hadnot seen a soul, and the echoes of my own footfalls had taken on sinister meaning in the deserted hallway.
They seemed to be shouting to me to go bsrck, to run, fo cease trying to pry into the dark secrets of Chinatown.
I started to open the elevator door, but it would not open.
My heart stopped for a moment.
Since I had left the cage, some one had signaled for it, and it had or up.
Viciously I jabbed the button and lieard the whirring of the cage from below.
There was something horrible in that whirring.
What would I see when I opened the door of the cage?
Who had signaled it Had that one known what I was doing?
^es watched me now I loiew it.
They would watch me as long as I was in Qimatown, and wherever I went out of Qiinatown, until the tortuous Chinese minds were satisfied that the affair of Liu Ti and Kwan Tao and Liu Mei had been settled accordhig to the rdenttess Chinese code.
The cage stopped at my floor.
I yanked open the door.
I donot know what I expected to find, certainly not what I did find Liu San, brother of Liu Ti, standing in a corner of the cage, rigidly erect, his black eyes staring into mine.
There was the haft of a knife sticking out of his left breast.
His right hand was clutched about the haft.
Cold chills raced along my spine.
He was dead.
He had to be dead, with the knife in him like that.
But why did he stand upright And why was he in the cage now, when it had been empty the last time I had seen it.
Or had it?
The last three words were almost a cry of terror.
Had he been there with me, during my recent descent from the fifth floor to the fourth?
If he had, I hadnot known it; 3ret I knew it was possible.
I would have screamed, but knew it useless.
A hundred murders could have been committed here, and none outside the wiser as long as the victims were Chinese.
A white man, disappearing, would be sought.
I stepped into the cage, which quivered a little, and touched the body of Liu San.
Instantly it toppled sidewise, crashing stiffly to the floor.
The corpse was already rigid.
Had this body been sent to me as a warning?
I didnot know, but I did know that some one listened ^many some ones and watched.
I shouted, knowing that my words went ringing up and down the shaft, and out through the grills at all five floors: “So help me God, bring every one responsible for this to justice and slay them with my bare hands if any harm comes to Liu Mei.”
Of course it was foolish.
No sooner had I shouted, the echoes ringing all through the empty building, than I knew just how foolish it was.
On the hallway of the floor above me I could hear the scuffling of sandaled feet.
On the floor below I could hear it, too.
All through the building.
I slammed the door, dropped down to the next floor.
And this time I left the door open, so that only by cwning to this floor could any one use the elevator.
And be in the hallway, where I could see whoever approached.
I was fighting mad, and more frightened than I had ever been for Liu Mei, mostly, I told myself, and didnot fool myself at all.
I remembered the kiss and caress of' Chinese knives, and knew that I would feel them again.
Liu Mei, perhaps, was feeling them now I I searched this hallway, too, and found nothing.
Then I went back to the elevator.
No one had approached it, for repeatedly I had looked back, to make sure.
I started to step into the cage.
The body of Liu San had vanished.
In its place reposed the dead body of Liu sister, around her neck the mate of the cord which had strangled Liu Ti The elevator had become an instrument of hellish black magic.
Two people had been slain in it within the last fifteen minutes, or slain elsewhere and dumped into it for me to find, by some means I couldnot even guess at.
I was like an automaton, geared to run a certain distance in a straight line.
I couldnot, wouldnot turn back, or change my course in one iota, come hell or high water.
I dropped down to the second floor, still seeking the trail of Liu Mei.
This had to be the last floor, for I had come to on the first floor to find Liu Mei missing.
I stepped fearfully over the supine body of Liu sister, into the hallway.
And almost at once, like eyes of cats blinking in the dark, I saw the shoe.
It was a tiny shoe, and I recognized it at once.
One of Liu set with the brilliants that peeped forth so alluringly from under the hem of her gown when she walked.
It seemed to call to me, beseechingly.
It seemed to plead.
A It seemed to threaten, to challenge me.
It took all of my courage to walk down the hallway to that single shoe, to stare down at it.
It rested on its side at the top of a flight of stairs.
It was Liu shoe, without a doubt.
She had kicked it off for me to find or had she?
Maybe her captors had left it there, to lead me to destruction.
What would happen to me if I picked it up and went with it down the stairs?
Those stairs, strangely, were ominously black, filled with ebon foreboding of disaster to come.
The whole building seemed to have fallen silent to listen to what?
To the beating of my own terrified heart?
I wouldnot take the black stairs.
They led down to the first floor. take the elevator, stubbornly, as I had taken it hitherto.
This time I expected to find that some other horror had developed in my absence.
But no.
The door of the cage was still open, and the sister of Liu Ti still sprawled supine on the floor.
I started to shut the door when the cry came shrill, piercing, filled with agony, and with terror.
"Gordon!
Gordon Bais The cry came from the depth of that black stairwell, whence steps led down into God knew what.
That it had been the voice of Liu Mei I knew for a certainty, as I raced for the stairs.
And scarcely had the echoes of my footfalls started in the liallway again, than it came once more, with something added “Gordon I Go back Go back fol— And there it broke short off, and I knew that a hand had closed tightly over her mouth z. dirty hand, a grimy Chinese hand, like the hands which had beaten me, smelly hands, hands which it were sacril^e to use upon the person of Liu Md.
If I could get my hands on the fellow who had stopped her Even for touching her, I would tear his heart out with steely finr gers.
I didnot realize she had warned me back until I had plunged headlong into the black stairwell to be swallowed by a darkness redolent with the odor of incense and Liu perfume.
I saw her, then, vanishing into the hallway on the first floor, around the comer of the stairwell below, carried backward, upright, in the big arms of two huge men whose faces I could not see, but which I knew were devil-masked.
Something struck me at the base of the skull, and I rolled down the rest of the stairs, numb from the blow but knowing as I rolled that my attacker was right behind, coming to strike me ^in.
I hit the bottom and fought for the strength to meet him when he reached me.
Where Is Uu Mei? body, as I dragged stubbomly to my feet, seemed to be made of lead.
My arms were burdens, my legs were almost too heavy to drag under me.
My neck was stiff, almost immovable, as I twisted it, by great effort of will, to face the man who came down tlie stairs behind me.
A Chinese, of course, and a huge one, wearing a devil’s mask.
I couldnot have handled him, man for man, had I been in full possession of my faculties, and he unarmed.
As matters stood I was on my feet, but out, helpless, and he carried a club in both hands.
He wore the queue, most unusual in a modern Chinese, and it looked like a snake above his mask.
His teeth were showing in a snarl, or a grimace of murderous amusement.
He was like something out of a nightmare.
I raised my hands, or tried to, to ward off the blow he was sending at my But my tends wouldnot move, and the blow landed.
It landed with a dull sound, as though he had struck the head of a drum, and I scarcely felt it at all.
That one thing told me how close I was to death.
He had brought the chib down whh both hands.
I had tried to pull my head out of the way.
I think the blow was a glancing one.
It must have been, else it would have driven my head down into my shoulders.
He came at me, striking again.
My right shoulder well, I think it was almost broken by that first blow.
I had no defense whatever, except my wits.
And a certain knowledge of Cantonese.
Now I used the latter knowledge, and heard sing-song words burble madly through my lips— -lips that felt diick as untanned leather. figure of the Chinese danced before my eyes, until there seemed to te two of him, as I ^oke the words; must get to liu Mei.
She has done nothing.
What w31 they do to her?’' His answer was so strange that for a long moment I did not understand him.
“You know the ancient Cantonese custom of the broken urn?”
Um?"
I repeated.
“What has Liu Mei to do with urns?”
“This,” he answered, falling back a little because I had managed to lift my left foot against him, to keep him from getting too close.
“That a Chinese husband expects his wife ft come to him, as for^gners call it, *idean'.
If he finds it is not so, he «ends her back to her fafter, on a rattling cart, a broken urn swinging below a broken urn surrounded by bits of metal that dink.*’ The it drove most of the numbness out of me, then and there.
I loved the -Chinese, always had, the bad whh the good, but had never been able to thifdc of thdr heartlessness to women without a shudder of revulsion.
"But Lilt Hei can not thus be sent back!"
Again that horrible rattling in my throat which I could scarcely recc^ize as my own voice speaking Cantonese.
"There is no finer, more suitable woman anywhere.”
"That is true,” he said, "at the moment.
But when we have finished whh her He left it there, and I knew the full meaning of his horrible, fang-showing grimace.
Uu Mei was to be given to these monsters.
She was being taken away to that fate even as we spoke.
Kwan Tao, being a Chinese, could no more have taken her to wife than he could have denied his belief in gods and devils on the rivers of his native land.
It wasnot the first time a fragile, delicate Chinese woman had been given to a mob.
And here was numb with hurt, unable to stop this imspealable and Liu Mei already gone.
Nothing had happened to her so far only because her captors must first make sure of me.
They had no desire for "foreign” police to break in ou them.
I cried out in agony.
I was a desperate, savage man at that moment, who couldnot be hurt any more.
Whether I loved Liu Mei or not, have gone to help her, because she was a woman, and lier captors blood-mad brutes.
My desperation lent power to my bands, my feet.
I lunged at my attacker, with my head down, like a footbfdl player smashing the line.
Again his club crashed down on me.
This time I took most of the t^rific blow <m my shoulderbbdes, but almost intolerable pain shot through my entire body, Then my head crashed into the man’s stomach.
He was tdcen by surprise by a form of attack new to him and went violently backward to the floor, striking his head with a sickening thud.
The club rolled from his hands.
I saw it and resolved tliat, whatever happened to Liu Mei, none of it wotdd be because of this man at my feet.
A I picked up the dub.
I remembered the blows which had crashed against my skull.
I Must have been mad, a beast in my own right.
With all my power I smashed the club down on his head, just as he lifted it from the floor.
As it struck the top of his skull, I felt the club sink in, or the wood give, and his head dropped back soddenly upon the floor.
Something red and sinuous, like a crimson snake, crept out from his mask, sluggislily crawling.
Still with the dub in my hand, I whirled and ran, sluggishly, along the way those two had gone with Liu Mei, I scarcely realized that the blood from my own wounds was streaming down my cheeks until I tasted its salt on my lips.
Another flight of stairs led down into darkness.
I didnot hesitate. down those stairs, and from that moment on what happened was a kind of blur.
There were masked men on the stairs, and I struck at them savagely, with all my power.
I felt the club crack against skulls, cheeks, against bodies.
I rammed the end of It into bellies, but I allowed none of this to stay my headlong plunge down those stairs.
It w'as dark, that basement, where I struck the bottom of the stairs, but far ahead of me I saw a faint glow of light, and I knew that I was somewhere in the labyrinth under Chinatown ^that maze of tunnels and passageways which no white man ever sees.
There were men behind me, but they feared my bloody, swinging club.
Besides, I was mouthing weird cries which sounded insane even to me and Chinese have dread respect for the insane.
Knowing this the inspiration came to pretend insanity, to keep it up until the last.
If they’d realize that, insane or not, aiming directly at the freeing of Liu Mei they would know I was not mad, but if I acted fast enough they wouldnot have time to think.
I came to that glow of fight It was a tunnel mouth, and in the tunnel I dashed to the first turnii^;.
Even here I could see that it led to another basement, and a vast room outfitted with gaudy lavishness.
The room was filled with coolies, scores of them, standing, facing their master with becoming servility, masked heads bowed.
There was one man on a dais, a man in gorgeous robes, with a black cap on his head, topped by a red coral button.
He wore the five-strand beard of venerable wisdom, and there was no smile on his lips, nor mask upon his face.
Bound, gagged, fastened to a column which upheld the roof, stood Kwan Tao.
He was struggling with hie bonds.
His eyes were shooting flames.
I stared at him as I ran.
He was naked to the waist, and his torso was a mass of blood.
Kwan Tao had been beaten with the bamboo until his skin and flesh had been shredded.
His chest was crimson and dripping and horrible.
It made me think of the ghastly "death of a thousand cuts but I know Kwan Tao wasnot thinking of those wounds, those ghastly wounds which would have killed a white man.
Standing between two coolies, before the man on the dais, was Liu Mei.
Her face was deadly white, but she stood proudly erect, like a soldier.
I saw the lips of the man on the dais, and they were moving, but what the man said I couldnot make out.
Yet I was close enough to have heard.
I saw the lips of Liu Mei move in answer.
I saw her head thrown back, as though she flung defiance into the face of the seated man.
His face was twisted into bestial lines as he listened.
But why couldnot I hear what was being said Had something happened to my senses as Ihe result of the beatings I had taken The whole thing was utterly weird.
It was tiice watching a silent motion picture, and hearing not even the machine which ran it.
Yet all of these people were alive, unless I were looking into a vart mirror, which seemed impossible.
The man on the dais suddenly rose, shot out his hand and slapped Liu Mei twice, once -on either side of the face, so hard that I thought her head would be knod»d from her shouidets, I knew that ^e for I could see her moutii open, but I teard no sound.
The Chinese master stood there in his wrath, and I knew that he heaped that wrath upon this woman who defied Win.
Her uncle, his sister Mid God knew who rfse had already paid the penalty for something.
I had seen two— a, sister and a brother of Liu Ti— and knew some of the answer.
When any Chinese tribunal sentenced a man to death, his whole family dial with him. for what good did it do destroy the tiger Mid spare die cute?”
Only Kwaa Tao they had spared, for the moment at least; kit in the end lie would go the same way.
Just now, tliougli, they wished hhn to know to the full the huntihation to be visited upon Liu Mei. the m^t terrible feeling, as I hurled ojyseif toward this ghastly tableau, that I was a man in a nightmare, with I loved in dangw and my own feet rooted to the ground so that I could not move, while death raixd upon me from the rear.
It was like swimming in glue, forward march, because of my weakness.
My feet drammed against the tunnel floor, but seemed to talce me forward not at all.
My club was altnost too heavy to hold.
I had to clutch it with all the strength of my two hands.
I wondered if Lm Mei didnot know I was here, trying my best to get to her if only that I might ^ay her myself, to save her from what the monsters would do to her.
Did she guess?
As tiiough in answer to my thought she turned and looked dired:1y at me.
I thought her right hand lifted, palm toward me, as though she would order me to get back, to save myself.
But she couldnot, possibly, liave seen me.
I knew that instantly, and yet in some strange fashion she must have known I was there, trying my best to reach her.
I whirled.
There where hideously masked faces all around me.
Qiinese blocking my retreat had I wished to retreat They didnot offer to touch me again.
They merely laughed, horrible cackling laughter which shodc their bodies witli their glee and they were laughing at me.
I whirled, burled myself forward again.
I struck something;, an invisible mysterious something, in fidl stride, and it knocked mo flat on my back, stunning me again.
I almost lost my and all around me they laughed and chattered.
I scrambled to my feet, felt in the air for whatever it was that had knocked me down.
My hands came in terrifying with an expanse of spotlessly clean glass, of such dimensions that it sliut me in the tunnel entirely ^yet let me see the hwror of tbe room b^'ond! tilings were made plain to me in that one agonizing moment.
I knew, or guessed, sometiiing of what must have happened.
Coming down in the elevator, Liu Mei and I had passed a floor just after some sort of drug, hidden in the odor of meense perhaps, had A been blown through the grill.
It had instantly rendered both of iis inanimate.
The cage had automatically stopped at the ground floor, where I had been taken out.
Then the enemy on the other floor had pressed the signal, and the cage had gone back up, bearing Liu Mei, helpless, unconscious of what was happening to her, into the hands of her enemies.
I had awakened in the cage again, and had been beaten horribly because I was too numb and stupid from the drug to fight back.
Why had the Chinese gone about their work in so elaborate a fashion, when a single knife thrust would have done for me and left Liu Mei in their hands?
There seemed, at the moment, just one explanation, the one I had given myself.
They played with me to keep me from going out and bringing the white police.
And they didnot kill me solely because they know for sure that I hadnot told police to come looking for me if I didnot reappear in a certain length of time.
And this glass in the tunnel, shutting me off from the room beyond.
I could imagine why it was there.
Not for my personal and special confounding, but so that enemies of this imholy group, or people who doubted its power, might see what the monsters were capable of doing.
I couldnot go forward.
The tunnel behind me was packed with Chinese.
Knowledge of my plight drove me mad.
In a few moments something terrible would happen to Liu Mei.
I had to reach her.
I think desperation must have given me the strength of many men.
I stepped back from that expanse of glass.
I felt my biceps bulge.
Power, unimaginable power, seemed to swell and distend my every nerve and muscle.
The world whirled.
The tunnel spun.
I hurled myself at that glass.
I didnot feel my hurts.
It was as though my anger had nullified my agony.
Sweat dripped from me, the salty sweat of a cornered brute beast.
My chib crashed against that glass with all the power I had.
As it did, every face, and every mask, in the room beyond was turned toward me.
Liu Mei turned, and her hand went to her mouth.
Her eyes were big with terror.
A great jagged star showed in the glass.
I felt someone hurl himself at me from behind.
I spun, swung instinctively, lifted my aim a little, and crashed my stick in the man’s mouth.
It must have knocked out every tooth his head.
He turned a back somersault into the press behind him.
But I didnot even wait to see him strike among his fellows.
I whirled back to the glass again, seizing the split seconds left before the enemy behind overpowered me.
The first crash of my bludgeon against the glass had sounded like the crack of doom.
The second was even worse, for slivers of glass broke free and clattered into the tunnel in jagged shards, while others fell in the rown beyond.
Berserk now, unstoppable, desperate with terror, I swung, and swung again.
I smashed through.
The opening was small, but I stepped back and hurled myself through it, just the same.
Jagged points like a thousand swords struck me, caught at my clothing, ripped my flesh, I was sobbing and cursing.
I would reach Liu Mei.
I would free Kwan Tao. to my knees beyond the glass, turning a little, to see the smaller Chinese coming through the glass after me.
I paused just a moment to crack down on the skulls of the first two.
I did not spare my strength, and there were other spfaffers of crimson on the glass when I again sw’ung back to the occupimts of that hateful room.
My enemies in the tunnel, aghast that one man could be so murderously destructive, and drawn back.
I could hear the voices of die men in the room I had so violently and madly entered.
The man on the dais “Sdze the ^rl Take her to the room beyond!
Half the coolie with her, the other half here to slay this meddler f" The coolies divided as though they had alreaffy been instructed.
Kwan Tao, a bleeding Iwrror, tugged witliout cessation at his fionds.
The man on the dais scarcely moved, nor did the expression on his face change. jumped between the girl and me.
Through their ranks I saw the others, bearing the girt to the other room.
I had no trouble gu^sing what woufd happen there.
But no damned coolies could keep me from reaching her!
I swung into that first group with all njy desperate ftrry.
One went down with a smashed ^tll.
I heard the man on the dais "The first man to break ground before I bid him, dies by my hand!"
I snapped a glance over my right shoulder.
The man on the dais gripped a snubnosed automatic in his ri^t hand.
Anotlier -Chinese v’tut down.
Desperation drove the other coolies as they stood shoulder to shoulder to fight me off.
There were more a>ming through the glass behind me, I knew.
But I didnot take time to turn.
I swept die heavy end of that club along the faces of my enemies, not to land solidly, but to graze ant} maim and smash.
The effect was horrible, the now bloody masks askew.
It was like running the end of a stick along a picket fence, save that tire result was bloody horror.
And I cried out all the tfme.
I saw the door beyond them open.
Liu Mei cast one despairing look over her shoulder at me as the coolies bore her into that room, out of which a faint light came.
Then she was gone, and die smiridng coolies with her, and hell had never spawned a fury such as I became.
I swung again— -and missed completely.
And this was the reason.
The man on the dais had said’: “Enough!
Let him try to reach Irer now.
You are too iate^ Gordon Bais.
By the time you could rip down tliat door He have to finish it.
I hurled myself toward the door, but my mind was not on tliat objective.
It held a picture of the automatic gripped on the knee of the master of all this horror.
I couldnot reach him.
Bullets woirid travel too fast.
His eyes would be following every move I now made.
I had his location fast fixed in my mind.
I must make no slightest error of judgment.
And I did not.
Almost at the door, I whirled like a dervish, and the blunt-ended club sped from my hands with my power, and with all the skill that sometimes comes to a man in a desperate place.
It went like a shot, directly for the chest of the man on the dais.
His opened to scream.
But the sound never got out.
His right hand Italf swung toward me, but he didnot have time to pull the trigger.
The bhint dub struck him in the dhest, and bones and cartdage must have given back before the hurtling projectile.
The man toppled badeward from his dais.
I was right behind my strange weapon of offense, while the slow thinkers almost incapable of executing anytititig without the command of some superior, stared at me like so many yellow statues.
Only their ^es moved.
I grasped the unconscious tealer by the throat, yanked him to fiis feet.
A I shook him.
I had to bring him to.
I grabbed at his automatic, held it in my right hand, so that its muazle menaced the wall of coolies who now surrounded me.
"Make one move against me,” I said hoarsely, "and twist this man’s head from his shoulders!”
They knew I meant it, and this man was their rice, their living, their master.
No move was made by any one.
The man was coming around.
"Where is the key to that room?”
I demanded.
"If I donot get it still kill this monster!”
Nobody spoke.
The unconscious man couldnot.
Kwan Tao still with his bonds.
I snapped at the nearest coolie, in whose belt was a knife.
"Loose his gag!
Cut his bonds!” had ever obeyed a mas* ter more quickly.
Kwan Tao stepped free.
His face, his whole body, had been so harshly tortured that it was next to impossible to recognize him.
"Where is the key, Kwan Tao?”
I demanded.
"On his left wrist, hidden under the sleeve.”
I found it, fastened by a thong.
I yanked it free, breaking the thong, but only after it had cut deeply into the man’s flesh.
I dragged him to the door.
I commanded Kwan Tao to hold him there.
"If anything has happened to her,” I said, "this man will wish to God he had never been born!”
Kwan Tao didnot answer me.
He merely stared.
His lips worked spasmodically.
His face was a gargoylesque red mask.
"Take this gat,” I snapped again, "and see that the coolies donot follow us into the room.”
I twisted the key in the lock.
The door protestingly.
From inside it, driving me to madness, came sounds which were like, a woman’s moans of terror.
Then words in shrill Cantonese, in Liu voice “Turtles, sons of turtles, eggs of turtles How dare you lay hands on a daughter of kings!”
And one voice making answer "Daughter of kings, true, but damned to eternity by mingling with the blood of a barbarian!
Even your ancestors would say that what befalls you will be less than you deserve!”
Then I was inside, with Kwan Tao beside me, dragging the man I had all but slain.
And what a tableau met my eyes.
Liu Mei, backed against a far wall, much of her upper garments tom away.
Her head was back, her shoulders were stiff with pride.
Her right hand held a knife, poised, its point aimed at her own heart.
The masked coolies were closing on her in a tight semi-circle, like hyenas to the kill.
"Drop it, Liu Mei,” snapped some one.
"Out, you curs, back with your own The crimson Kwan Tao was the spokesman.
Liu Mei dropped the knife.
The Chinese slunk past us like beaten mongrels.
Kwan Tao, while relief began to surge through me, shut the door, locked it, put his back against ft.
Kwan Tao grinned, a savage, red grin.
The man he had dragged in with him had vanished!
Maybe he had been playing dead.
Maybe, well, the fact remained that between the second Kwan Tao shoved him against the wall, and closed the door, the man had snapped into consciousness, and had slipped out behind Kwan Tao.
Kwan Tao hadnot closed the door.
It had been closed from outside, and all three of us were prisoners!
"We bimgled it,” said Kwan Tao, "but maybe it is just as well.”
He stared at Liu as I did.
Hef face never be whiter.
She had plainly been through hell, I wanted to ask her what had happened.
Chinese are, to us, brutally frank.
Kwan Tao asked her before I could “Those coolies Did they—” “Have coolies ever, in all our history,” asked Liu Mei bitterly, “failed to take of women captives?”
She didnot mince words.
I saw the fece of Kwan Tao change as no torture had ever been able to make it change.
No Chinese of his station cotdd possibly ignore the “law of the broken nfn.”
I broke in on tlie grim, thing that had come between Kwan Tao and the woman both of us loved.
“Will some one kindly tell me the meaning of all this?” will,” said Kwan Tao, “and I must hurry, for we have little time.”
“Little time?”
I repeated.
“Yes, for even now the snaky tendrils of the yellow smoke comes into this from the room of hell beyond.”
The flowery language of the high-bom Chinese did not desert him even now, I whirled, and saw the yellow snioke; yellow tentacles of it, coming in through the keyhole, making one think of an inept smoker trying to blow rings.
I choked.
It already had me by the throat.
Chineje Blank Watb said Kwan Tao, speaking very rapidly, “wished me to take Liu Mei in marriage.
I wished it, too, proud to have for wife the dau^ter of Chinese kings.
But the tong said no.
Lhi Ti the tong.
They thr^tened us with death i^ Liu Ti persisted in his defiance.
Liu Ti thought you might help.
This is the result.
And now, my two good friends, here we are, altogether, with but a few minutes of life left to us.”
He didnot go toward Liu Mei.
I knew that centuries of tradition held him apart from her.
Modern America would have ridden, in its youth, over any such barrier as convention had reared between these two, especially when the fault was not with Liu Mei.
Kwan Tao spoke to her. loved you from the bottom of my heart, Liu Ti.” know.”
Her voice was harsh.
“But if we were to escape from this pit, you would never again so much as touch my hand.”
He didnot nod he couldnot.
He didnot shake his head.
There was no answer he could give, because Liu Mei had already given it. love you, too, Liu Mei, have always loved you,” I said.
One might as well speak truly on the brink of the grave, where there was nothing to win or lose, loved rou both,” said Liu Mei, speaking as one already dead.
“And now I die, alone.
It is so unutterably lonely.”
I didnot tell them, even if there had been time, what had befallen their people.
They must have guessed anythow.
They knew their own kind.
I whirled on Kwan Tao.
“Go to her, Tao,” I choked.
“Take her in your arms.
What can it matter now, when death is so close?”
He looked at her and did not move.
In the ear of my mind I could hear a creaky cart on the streets of Canton, with a tinkling, broken urn swinging below it.
I could see Liu Mei, white o| face, sitting on that cart, jeered at by multitudes along the narrow, muddy streets.
The thought almost broke my heart.
I started toward Liu Mei, and couldnot make it.
My feet didnot work properly.
A I staggered, almost falling, away over to the right.
The wall was jumping at me.
I couldnot lift my arms, to ward it off.
It struck me in the face, knocking me flat.
I rolled to my side, looked at Kwan Tao.
He was staring, his face a mask of agony, at Liu Mei.
But he hadnot taken a step toward her.
Now he swayed, like a tree in a hurricane, as the drug which was slaying all three of us got in its deadly work.
I got to my feet, finally, and it was like lifting a mighty weight.
I slid against the wall, trying to shove myself toward Liu Mei.
She was watching me, and her eyes thanked me.
It must liave hew terrible, to a delicately nurtured woman, to die Uke this, with two men who knew what a dreadful thing bad happened to her. fina% reached her.
I put n^ arm around it.
It was like tryir^ to lift an arm of lead.
I sagged against Hie wall.
A yellow film now between Kwan Tao and me, through which he seemed still to sway.
His eyes were still fixed on Liu Mei.
I thought he was talking, but there was a ringing in my ears, so that I was none too sure.
"Daughter of kings!
Blood of kings!”
I tliougbt he was saying.
“Defiled by dregs from die rbttenest gutters of Chinatown!
How can turned to Liu l^ei.
"It wouldnot matter to me, darling,” I whispered, my whisper a sobbing kind of gasp. know you help it.
I would tjdce you in my arms, hold you forever, and we’d both forget.”
She whispesed back.
"How good it is to know that, Gordon Bais, on the brink of the Eastern Heaven.”
Shb, like Kwan Tko, used the flowery speech in a crisis.
She was all Chinese, save that her coloring was almost as light as my own.
She, to me, was an American girl.
I tried to hold her more tightly.
But both of us were swaying, and I was trying to grip the smooth cold wall with the fingernails of my free liand.
I felt the nails slide along the stone I heard them, like a thin screaming in my ears.
These weird impressions told me that hashish, at least in part, was in the yellow smoke which destroyed us.
There was nothing ahead of us but death.
I turned to face Liu Mei.
Maybe, by slapping her, by shaking her head, I could keep her awake.
Soon the enemy would open the door.
Then, perhaps, I could hurl her out, save her.
But, God help me I couldnot manage my hands and arms.
All my strength could not lift them.
I couldnot even take my arm from about the proud, graceful shoulders of Liu Mei. were all three doomed.
This was the end.
I swayed.
We swayed together, and I tiunk Liu Mei held me up, once or twice, when I would have fallen.
My eyes seemed to bulge as I looked at that locked door, so that the thin tendrils of yrilow smoke became as large full-bodied pythons yellow, hideous, nightmare pythons, shoving their coifs through a Gargantuan keyhole to quest for the three of us.
I tiled again to tell Liu Mei that it didnot matter.
But now no words would pass my lips.
My vocal cords would no longer serve me. unaccountably, I was down on the floor, on my belly: I couldnot rise again.
I couldnot wriggle my fingers.
Beside me Liu Mei was standing with her feet wide apart, proudly trying to die erect.
The yellow film was everywhere.
Kwan Tao still stood, weaving, swaying, looking at liu Mei.
She must have been looking at him, too.
But she preferred me, I was sure of that.
It was something to take with me into the Hereafter, where our heavens would not cross, and we should never meet again.
Unless the white of Liu Mei came to my heaven.
How silly it was But the yellow smoke caused it.
And then my heart seemed to stop beating for a moment.
I was losing Liu Mei.
Perhaps I had never had her.
Her love, yes, a strange kind of love, but part of my life.
Now the two of them, Kwan Tao and Liu Mei, staggering, almost falling, were moving toward each other.
I saw them meet.
His hands, by some superhuman power which I did not share, because I could not move mine at all, went out to her.
They caught her left arm, drew the hand through his elbow.
They stood side by side with this strange Chinese handclasp which was the signal of foregiveness, of dose harmony of souls.
And then, though both knew American kisses, because both had known the freedom of American schools, they were both all China.
They were rubbing their cheeks together, because the true Chinese did not kiss.
They locked in each other’s arms.
Then they fell, as a tree falls, and though I saw them strike the hard floor, I did not hear them, because of the ghastly roaring in my ears.
They fell, sprawled supine, but held fast in each other’s arms, and my spirit writhed in agony as they fell.
For I knew that in those last minutes both had forgotten there had ever been such a one as Gordon Bais. took that awful, strange agony, with me into abysmal darkness, where there was nothing but the roaring in my ears.
Darkness, through which shot long tendrils of yellow smoke, engulfed me. consciousness in an elevator that was moving.
Strange and horrible and unearthly it seemed.
My last memory liad been of Kwan Tao and Liu Mei, falling side by side in the room of the yellow smoke, forgetting all about me.
And here I was in a moving elevator.
My hand was on the control.
The cage was dropping.
Save that Liu Mei was not here, I might just have entered it with her.
But what hell there had been between My dazed, drugged wits began to come back.
I noted the passing floors.
I was dropping from the third to the second.
I jammed the control, to stop the car at the ground floor.
I ran out.
I was crazy, I suppose, but it couldnot end like this.
I had to find Kwan Tao and Liu Mei.
I screamed.
I went racing through the corridor, down the stairs, heading for the tunnel where Miu Lei, Kwan Tao and I had suffered.
I smashed headon against a wall where the door leading down had been.
There was nothing.
Just a smooth wall, with no sign that a stairway had ever existed here.
I banged against that panel, shouting.
I couldnot have broken it down with a battering ram.
The echoes of my cries, and my pounding, ran eerily all through the bouse.
That was all.
No other soiwids.
Wild with terror, I raced back to the elevator.
Half an hour later I had scoured that building from top to bottom, and had found not fwie living soul.
Nor a dead body.
And this, at the last, was the result of my madness: I had found no trace of Liu Mei or Kwan Tao, no hint that Liu uncle A had ever even lived here.
Every trace of the things which had happened here had vanished.
I found nothing.
I satisfied mysetf that I was alone in this place that had become a mausoleum of dreadful mystery.
I battered against that mystery and could find no answer.
I tried to find ways down into the warrens, and only cold blank panels met my every attempt, I was beatwi, whipped. get officers. dashed to the outer door, the only one in this place that wasnot locked.
I raced out, looking along the street for police.
The door clicked shut, and locked, behind me.
I couldnot get back in.
I banged against that door I broke my knnddes.
I cried out Liu name, and Kwan I sobbed with futile rage and despair.
This was, I knew, the end.
Nobody hi all Chinatown, throughout which my cries and battering must have been pla&ily heard, gave the slightest sign, until almost an hoftr of madness had passed.
Then an old, a very old, Chinese gentleman came to me, looked up and said "It is futile for the foreigner to batter his head against the stones.
The dead must bury their dead.
The past is gone.
Nothing can be regained.
The task of the Kving Is to forget quickly.
In your place, my young friend, I should go back to my own.
For never again will you see any of you knew so well no, not even though your police tear Chinatown into shreds.”
It took a long time to convince me, but he did it, finally, and I went home, staggering like a drunken man, while fingers of yellow mist seemed eternally to be striking the lobes of my brain, pushing them a^inst the inside of my skull.
Out of it all, I thought crazily, the yellow smoke, at least, would be always with me. ns 10c a Copy Out Now wmamsr stobses ever toldi Two Fall heagib Novel* of Eerio Mrsterf Itm By Now On Sale!
By Two Weirdly Realistic Novelettes By By And Three Unforgettable Short Terror Tales! had nsen from puddler to the control cab of the big ladle in less than three years.
A hard worker, Joe Seitz was, and the hearth foreman had had his eye on him from the first.
Before the first year was out he had seen that Joe was put in charge of furnace No. and the only reason Joe hadnot risen steadily from that time onward was due to no fault of It just happened that, at the time, there was no job open to There was a pause in the puddler boss’s upward progress that lasted almost two years.
That two years strained Joe patience to the limit and beyond.
But Seitz had never workw anywhere but in the steel mills.
He didnot know anything else.
He had to stick ^but there was nothing to keep him from advancing up and away from the furnaces.
Nothing, that is, except the fact that Ben Grady had the job he was in line for and in two years’ time Ben never gave a sign of slipping, never made a mistake, never missed a day’s work.
It was maddening.
Joe Seitz went on a three weeks’ drunk to see if he couldnot think of something to do about it.
His brain was sli^gish and dull when he was sober.
Only his motor-sensory system worked efficiently, seemingly, without the stimulant of alcohol.
But liquor loosened his imagination, gave him ideas.
He emerged from the drunk with a fully-hatched scheme for removing Ben Grady from his path.
Once in a while the big ladle got stuck right in the middle of the mill.
It always happened when there was a full load in it ^the weight of the molten metal in the huge cauldron making the accident more promote Joe into. likely to occur.
There was a slight dent on the girder the conveyor traveled on, and the bump sometimes sprung a dog in the cut-off mechanism so that the circuit to tlie motor was broken.
When tluit happened, the man in tlie control cab had to walk out on tlie girder until he was directly over the huge vat of boiling metal in order to re-set the cut-off dog.
The mill did not have a night shift.
Business was dull, and Seitz had no difficulty in avoiding the nightwatchman when he came to put his |Jan into operation.
The plan was very simple.
All Seitz did was to crawl out on the girder and grease it thoroughly at the spot that would be directly over the ladle the next time the dog slipped.
It did.
Ben Grady died horribly, and Joe got his job.
Ben had screamed, when his foot slipped on the grease Seitz had put on the girder.
He had screamed again as his body plunged down through space into the ladle of white-hot molten metal.
Joe Seitz remembered those screams.
He was afraid that he would remember and at intervals seem to hear them in all their brain-twisting horribleness until he died.
Lately it had been getting time the iadle the nhfldle ai dw aaiy lapffiiite the wlia<e die cah wa* located, Joe Seitz He coiid look dowtt iitto the rat from where he perched aad, in ian^ he saw his .body into that lashir^ fury of ^ea soup.

That didnot help ai^.
Wfaawver the ladle reached the wl^re it used to get ^uck Joe could hear Grady scream.
The ladle didnot get sftick any fnore. death had r^ulted hi the repair of tiiat dent in the gicd'er.
Sonjething like that usually had to hz^jpen in b^ore a piece of maclimery was fixed.
But Joe continued to hear Ben scream ^the screams got louder eveay day.
