a moneymaking opportunity for men of character an invention expected to replace a industry costly work formerly sent out by business men now done by themselves at a fraction of the expense this is a call for men everywhere to handle exclusive agency for one of the most unique business inventions of the day
forty years ago the horse and buggy business was supremetoday almost extinct
twenty years ago the phonograph industry ran into many millionstoday practically a relic
only a comparatively few foresighted men saw the fortunes ahead in the automobile and the radio
yet irresistible waves of public buying swept these men to fortune and sent the buggy and the phonograph into the discard
so are great successes made by men able to detect the shift in public favor from one industry to another another change is taking place
an old established industryan integral and important part of the nations structurein which millions of dollars change hands every yearis tn thousands of cases being replaced by a truly astonishin g si mple invention which does the work bettermore a it has not required very long for men who have taken over the rights to this valuable invention to do a remarkable business and show earnings which these times arc almost unheard of for the average man
one man in california earned over per month for three monthsclose to in days time
another writes from delaware i have been operating just a little less than a month of actual selling and not the full day at that because i have been getting organized and had to spend at least half the day in the office counting what i have sold outright and on trial i have made just a little in excess of one thousand dollars profit for one month
a connecticut man writes he has made in a single days time
texas man nets over in less than a weeks time
space does not permit mentioning here more than these few random cases
however they arc sufficient to indicate that the worthwhile future in this business is coupled with immediate earnings for the right kind of man
one man with us has already made over a thousand sales on which his earnings ran from to per sale and more
a great deal of this business was repeat business
yet he had never done anything like this before coming with us
that is the kind of opportunity this business offers
the fact that this business has attracted to it such business men as former bankers executives of businessesmen who demand only the highest type of opportunity and incomegives a fairly good picture of the kind of business this is
our door is open however to the young man looking for the right field inwhichto make his start and develophis future
not not a a valuable proved device which has been sold successfully by business novices as well as seasoned veterans
make no mistakethis is no noveltyno flimsy creatioo which the inventor hopes to put on the market
you probably have seen nothing hke it yetperhaps never dreamed of the existence of such a deviceyet it has already been used by corporations of outstanding prominenceby dealers of great corporationsby their branchesby doctors newspapers publishersschoolshospitals etc etc and by thousands of small business men
you donot have to convince a man that he should use an electric bulb to light his office instead of a gas lamp
nor do you have to sell the same business man the idea that some day he may need something like this invention
the need is already therethe money is usually being spent right at that very moment and the desirability of saving the greatest part of this expense is obvious immediately
some of the savings you can show too into an office and put down before poor prospect a letter from a sales organization showing that they did work in their own office for which formerly could have cost them over a building supply corporation pays our man whereas the bill could nave been for an automobile dealer pays our representative whereas the expense could have been over a department tore has expense of possible cost if done outside the business being well over and so on
we could not possibly list all cases here
these are just a few of the many actual cases which we place in your hands to work with
practically every line of business and every section of the country is represented by these field reports which hammer across dazzling convincing moneysaving opportunities which hardly any business man can fail to understand
profits typical of the young growing industry going into this business is not like selling something offered in every grocery drug or department store
for instance when you take a order can be your share
on worth of business your share can be the very least you get as your part of every dollars worth of business you do is centson ten dollars worth on a hundred dollars worth in other words mo thirds of every order you get is yours
not only on the first orderbut on repeat orders and you have the opportunity of earning an even larger percentage
this business has nothing to do with house to house canvassing nor do you have to know anything about highpressure selling
selling is unnecessary in the ordinary sense of the word
instead of hammering away at the customer and trying to force a sale you make a dignified businesslike call leave the installationwhatever size the customer says he will acceptat our risk let the customer sell himself after the device is in and working
this does away with the need for pressure on the customerit eliminates the handicap of trying to get the money before the customer has really convinced himself you simply tdl what you offer showing proof of success in that customers particular line of business
then leave the invention without a dollar down
it starts working at once
in a few short days the installation should actually produce enough cash money to pay for the deal yvith profits above the investment coming in at the same time
you then call back collect your money
nothing is so convincing as our offer to let results speak for themselves without risk to the customer i while others fail to get even a hearing our men are making sales running into the hundreds
they have received the attention of the largest firms in the country and sold to the smallest businesses by the thousands
no money need be risked in trying this business out
you can measure the possibilities and not be out a dollar
if you art looking for a business that is not overcrowded a business that is just coming into its ownon the upgrade instead of the downgradea business that offers the buyer relief from a burdensome but unavoidable expensea business that has a prospect practically in every office store or factory into which you can set footregardless of size that is a necessity but does not have any price cutting to contend with as other necessities dothat because you control the sales in exclusive territory is your own businessthat pays more on some individual sales than many men make in a week and sometimes tn a months time if such a business looks as if it is worth investigating get in touch wirb us at once for the rights in your delaybecause the chances are that if you do wait someone else will have written to us in the meantimeand if ir turns out that you were the better both be sorry

i suddenly felt as if i were floating in flowerscented space and that only strong arms were holding me to earth as they were holding me to him
nor did i know that in that astoundingly blissful moment of loves first realization that i was shivering until he said his deep voice smooth a little amused trembling karen

lacey sat behind the wheel driving with unconscious skill his steelgrey eyes filled with a strangely ruminative light his black fedora hat pushed back over the queerly white expanse of his forehead so that the crisp curling brickred hair which clung tightly to his skull was visible
red lacey goes berserk when terror path of a courageous hardboiled sleuth the sap broke teeth and mouth both sides of the street were lined with pushcarts
there were car tracks in the center of the street and a multitude of trucks and drays pounded and jounced over the cobblestone paving
the pushcarts were lined in a solid mass
piled on them was an assortment of merchandise appalling and profuse piled up jumbled masses of merchandise which fat perspiring women pawed over lackadaisically watched by sleepyeyed almost inert merchants who seemed completely disinterested in salesmanship or customer interest
fruits and vegetables meats garments hardware notions odds and ends of bolts of cloth haberdashery cart after cart pushed into position indiscriminately
and the hot sun beat down into the narrow canyon of fallon street and the cluttered pavements and cobblestones gave off shimmering heat eddies until the space between the ancient brick buildings became like the interior of a crematory
draymen and truck drivers cursed lethargically
trolley motormen clanged bells halfheartedly
even routs his old home stamping grounds the children playing in the street at peril of life and limb seemed to run and to yell in slow motion
the windows of the tenements were festooned with pillows and on the pillows ladies of the neighborhood leaned on meaty elbowsleaned with a fine disregard for the random display of feminine anatomy which should have been reserved for the eyes of more or less fond husbandsleaned and conversed haphazardly as if no zest remained in neighborhood gossip
strange smells hot foreign impregnated the heat eyes looked at the traffic of fallon street looked at the faces the skullcaps the beards the black vestments the tired draggedout women the whitefaced children the straining horses and the sizzling trucks him surrounded by an aura of almost regal splendor rode willie quirk uplifted nose was distinctly sniffing at fallon street odors
his freckled impish face was drawn up into a grimace of impatience
jeez what a joint complained willie
how come you didnot cut over to street and get a decent break goin uptown
the cabriolet was stopped by the immovable traffic ahead head turned his eyes looked at willie quirk
the queer rapt look was still in the steelgrey depths
every now and then willie i deliberately drive through here he said strangely
it kind of helps a guy to keep things straight in his mind
it kind of keeps his sense of values in proportion donot get it groaned willie hotter than the inside of a rhumba dancers instep
look willie said lacey with a nod toward the teeming sidewalks
see those pushcarts
see those stores
see those people
sure grunted willie
so what
those people are the backbone of new york city remarked lacey in the same strange voice
and people like them are the backbone of the whole united states of america
willie quirk merely stared at face
there was a little frown of worry and perplexity on his forehead
he looked at face anxiously as if to assure himself that his beloved chief was physically and mentally fit and in no danger of heat prostration
he nodded vaguely
backbone
you said it chief
see those little metal signs on those pushcarts willie
them peddlers licenses
yeah
know what that means
sure they go down to city hall and put up a couple of bucks and get one of them tin signs they tack it on the cart and theyre in business
more than that smiled lacey
those little tin signs represent taxes paid
thousands of dollars goring into the treasury of the city of new york and to the government
those stores there on both sides of the street
every one of them pays a license and taxes on top of that
taxes mean money
taxes build big beautiful buildings like the new court buildings we just passed
taxes the dollars sweatcovered grimy dollars from fallon street and other streets like it
well gosh everybody pays taxes donot they asked willie
why didnot that man with the whiskers make me pay out on that dough we made
i a taxpayer a little different with these people willie said lacey in the same almost sombre tone
they get so little back for their money
i guess proportionately they pay more taxes than anybody else in the country
they pay em more honestly
you see they canot cheat
they donot make enough to hire fast talking slippery lawyers to chisel the government and the city
they canot cover up
they just pay what theyre told to pay and no questions asked
and the damned shame of it is that a lot of the money they pay goes uptown to make central park sections beautifulso that the tax chiselers can have lovely places to walk their dogs
a lot of the sweatstained money that comes out of fallon street goes uptown eyes closed for a minute
perhaps the glare of the sun had something to do with it
his voice became distant
squalor and magnificence side by side
maybe upstairs in one of those tenement rooms a little kid is standing with a fiddle under his chin
a little kid who never had quite enough to eat
and the bow is going back and forth across the strings and the little kid doesnot even feel the heat
and maybe someday that little kid will stand up in front of a boiledshirted audience in carnegie hall and hell be another elman or heifetz
and maybe in another room a kid is sitting in front of a pianoa piano
maybe an old man is going around with holes in his shoes and a mother is not going to a doctor about that pain in her side to get that piano
and his fingers are pushing down those keys and maybe another gershwin will come out of that boy
or another kid is standing up on the roof looking down on this street dreamy eyed drinking it inand another fannie hurst is being born dancers too asked willie
fannie hurst is a writer willie grinned lacey suddenly
oh scuse me
i guess the first name kind of threw me off
sure
fallon street has something park avenue never will have said lacey
fallon street has its dreamsit sleeps with the dreams
it forgets the heat and the smells and the clamor and the gongs
dreams roundeyed people shuffling in here from other countriesbringing with them nothing but dreams
exploited gouged victimizedstill they cling to the dreams
dreams are life down here i guess thats why i like to drive through fallon street
park avenue has no dreams
park avenue hasnot feeling enough to dream isnot close enough to life
gee chief said willie you got relatives down here
see that corner asked lacey with a faint white smile
sure fallon and orchid
why
my grandfather was born right around that corner and lived there to the last day of his life
your grandfather marveled willie
sure
any reason why i shouldnot have a grandfather
most people have
only gee its funny hearin you talk about a grandfather somehow a guy gets the idea that you was always here that you were born grownup
get it
just kinda happened along just as you are
lacey grinned traffic started its slow move eastward
the tired horses strained at traces
the ironrimmed wheels rolled and crunched on the cobblestones
the truck engines chugged raced backfired
the trolley bells clanged querulously
the heat beat down soaked into bodies
and over the grinding pound of the traffic there was a sudden shrieking voice
a single voice uplifted in a hideous throatstraining scream
the sound ripped through the ordinary sounds of the street like a knife stabbing to the heart
the horses suddenly stopped
the truck engines were stilled
a silence gripped fallon street
a silence which seemed made up of white deadeyed faces staring toward the source of the scream
a girl stood in front of a shop
her hands were beating her breast
long black hair seemingly torn violently out of place fell down over her shoulders
her eyes were wide and staring
she stood stark in the doorway of the store and screamed
over and over
in a breath lacey was on the sidewalk
the door of the cabriolet was still open
the car stood in the center of the stalled traffic
he glanced once at the girls face
she was beautiful almost oriental
she wore a onepiece dress
the dress was ripped at the throat exposing one full beautifully rounded breast
her eyes were wild with fearand newborn grief
lacey grabbed her by an arm whirled her around the matter with you he barked at her harshly
the scream died out of her throat
she whimpered a little
her face was ashen
her throat moved spasmodically
she seemed unable to speak
she turned her head her eyes stared into the shadows of the store
lacey looked inside the door
there was a crumpled something on the floor close to the counter
a heavily veined white hand outflung inertly the wrist disappearing into a rusty black alpaca coat
lacey was inside the store in three strides
he banged the door after him
he dragged the girl with him
the thing on the floor was a man an old man
an old man with a white beard
a skullcap was pushed down over the old mans eyes
the angle was ribald
he lay quietly half on his back on his side
there was a little trickle of blood running from the corner of his mouth
his eyes were closed
there was an ugly bruise on the parchmentlike flesh covering his jaw
excepting for that he might have been asleep overweary asleep on the floor of his store
lacey picked up the hand
the hand was warm but soft and inert
he felt for a pulse
there was no pulse
the old man was dead
the girl stood quiet now looking down
outside faces pressed against glass of the window and door
lacey looked over his shoulder
he got to his feet snatched open the door spoke angrily
you people scram he told the crowd
the old man faintedheat nothing serious
scram now or there was authority in his voice
the authority these people knew
they looked at his face
there was authority there too
they drifted away talking to themselves looking back
lacey strode through the already impatient traffic
drive the bus in front of the store he told willie quirk
the hell with these guys in the trucks and things
put it up on the sidewalk if you have toand stay with it be in that little store
protective union went back to the store entered closed the door after him
he stood facing the girl
her face was quiet but still ashen like a mask
her hands were clenched into hard fists she asked quietly almost resignedly
lacey nodded dead he said
something rushed up into his throat at the look which came into the girls eyes
something that seemed to strangle him
what happened he asked huskily
they came back
her voice spoke out of a semistupor
they said theyd come back and hed have to pay
he didnot have the money sothey did that to him
they hit hima big manheavywith a gold tooth
he hit him in the face cursed at him wait a minute said lacey
who
what men
what money did they want donot know said the girl only know they came in the store maybe ten days ago they said they were forming a societyunion
yes a protective union they called it
all the merchants were joining to keep from being robbed and it would cost papa twenty dollars a week to belong
well grated lacey a sudden chill in his voice
where would he get twenty dollars a week to join a union
and nobody had ever robbed him or anything in ten years in business right here
so why should he join a union
and they told him hed join or else is that it growled lacey
he had to pay the twenty bucks a week whether he wanted to or not
she nodded
how did you know asked her dead voice
there are a lot of unions like that said lacey grimly
well he didnot pay
so
so the two men said theyd come back and he better have the money
so they came back today and he tried to tell them that he didnot want to join the union couldnot
and then one of the menthe big one with the gold tooth took something black out of his pocket and hit papa across the mouth and laughed and said next time the price would be fifty dollars a week
and they went out still laughing eh
icy glints were swimming in eyes
papa stood there staring at them as ifhe couldnot feel anything
i tried to keep them from hitting papa
they hit me tore my dress
when they went out the door came around the end of the counter and suddenly hefell down
i couldnot make him hear or open his eyesor anything
there was a sign on the window
the letters were reversed
lacey read the sign
notions he looked away from the window at the pitiful little stock within the store
at the impeccably neat array of shelves and counters
and the clean scrubbed floor and then at the white face with the trickle of blood oozing from the corner of the mouth
samuel golden asked lacey as if for something to say to break the terrible silence and the hoarse breathing of the girl
she nodded
samuel my father
my name is rosa rosa golden
suddenly she fell her knees buckled under her weight
she fell across the black alpaca coat and the black trousers
her face buried itself in the white beard
agony flooded up out of her soul shook her body
lacey stood looking down at her for a moment
then he lifted her face got to talk to you for a sorry he said
why she moaned
why should they do this to him
all he ever did was be kind to everybody
every day of his life he worked
every day he sat here and workedand dreameda bigger store maybe
he was a good manhis voiceso gentlehis eyeslike a childs let anyone in here said lacey
understand
nobody in here
and donot talk to anyone or go out of that door until i come back
her eyes merely looked at him without seeing
he turned his own eyes swirling almost devilish
he closed the front door of the store after him
the kids were playing in the street
tha endless procession of trucks and drays went by
heat eddies steamed up from the cement and pushcarts and cobblestones
he saw a public telephone sign on a corner store
he went in closed the door of the booth after him called police headquarters
gimme johnson of the homicide squad he barked at the police operator
after a moment he was talking to johnson little storekeeper named golden was killed a couple of minutes ago by a couple of thugs
samuel golden four eightysix fallon street
i want you to come down to that address alone see
plainclothes no police car nothing talk to you after you get here got an idea
remember nothing that looks like the police and no sirens or so help me never give you another break as long as i live
he went back to the store
he picked samuel golden up in his arms carried him into a back room put his body on a worn sofa
ten minutes later johnson came in
lacey talked to him in a voice vibrant with nervous energy
once he broke off to shoot a question at the griefstricken girl know these two men again if you saw them
her eyes blazed
yes she said simply like to keep them from doing the same thing they did to your father to some other girls father she shuddered covered her face with her hands
yes oh yes she moaned be afraid said lacey kindly
this is johnson of headquarters
my name is laceyred lacey going to try to punish the men who did this
we may want you to help a little
those were bad men
unless we catch them they will go on doing things like this
if you donot help us some other girl may lose her father as you lost yours
the flame in her black eyes was suddenly dazzling
it seemed to transfigure her whole being
she stood very straight and very white
her voice shook with emotional undercurrents am willing to do anything she said
johnson looked at lacey and nodded think youve got something there sherlock he admitted play ball with you
play it out see where it gets you
only cut me in when it gets hot and if you need help holler
what help will i need trapping a couple of rats asked lacey saw the dead samuel golden taken out of the little store in which he had been buried ten years of his life with his dreams and ambitions
johnson took care of that
a litter crew came in the early morning through the alley behind the store came silently departed the same way bearing the old man between them
no one knew that samuel golden was gone
no one knew he was dead
because red lacey labored for an hour before a mirror studying the dead face of the old man working and molding his own features with infinite care into a perfect resemblance
a man from headquarters arrived in a taxi
an expert on makeup he studied the dead face and head
he departed
an hour after his going a messenger boy delivered a package to the little store
the messenger boy was willie quirk in uniform
the package contained a wig the exact duplicate of samuel hair and pigment of the proper shading for makeup crisp red hair disappeared under the wig
so samuel golden lay still on the sofa and red lacey sat at a table and copied him feature for feature line for line
even to the little stoop between samuel shoulders and the wart over his right eyebrow
and while he worked the girl rosa watched her eyes filled with an almost hypnotic horrorwatched her father made to live again in the person of red lacey
watched as if it might have been a terrible nightmare
watched in silence
when lacey stood up he had samuel beard fastened to his own face with spirit gum
the beard masked the young grim lines of his mouth
he wore the black alpaca coat and the worn black trousers and the watchchain and the skullcap
the girl put her hand over her mouth held her breath
lacey kept talking to her all the time he manufactured himself into a replica of the dead storekeeper
you must believe it in your heart he told her
you must not think of your father as being deadkilled
you must not give a sign that anything has happened in this store that anything is changed
you must go about your daily affairs just as you did until today
you must treat me exactly as you treated your father
she nodded voice went on talking
what did you do usually
her voice swam through layers of weary numbness in her brain my meals and took care of his house
and sang
sang said lacey casually touching an eye shadow with a pencil
what did you sing
folk songs things he loved have to sing just as you did whenbefore todaysing the same way her throat trembled
he worked so hard so that i could sing
he would sit there looking at my face when i sang to him and sometimes the neighbors would come in and listen and he would be so proud
he used to say someday rosa you will sing for the world her voice broke suddenly
she was looking at his face
sing now said lacey
her eyes closed
sing she said hollowly
sing
her voice went up ended in a little shrill screaming pitch got to be a trouper rosa he said kindly got to sing got to tell yourself that youre in the wings and its your cue to go on and youve got to sing
there was a silence
her hands were fists again her body rigid
very well she said in a whisper sing face of samuel golden on the sofa
ghost of samuel golden in the person of red lacey
stark figure of the girl half covered by the shadows of the room
only her eyes alive in her face and her mouth opened and sounds came out
low sobbing throbbing sounds in a deep contralto voice
the sound filled the room rose and fell
her eyes looking at her fathers face
the grief and anguish in her heart rushing into her voice
her hands lifting up and up
lacey sat there looking at her spellbound
she was suddenly a thing of exquisite beauty the living figure of tragedy
tragedy singing a threnody
tragedy hands uplifted to the heavens
her voice died away a crooning minor tone
she sank down on the floor covered her face with her hands
lacey said in a husky whisper god what a voice
then the men came in the door and carried out samuel golden
carried him away in the darkness
east side hero sat behind the counter of samuel notion store
the black skullcap was on his head
the half light touched him
the girl rosa moved about through the store
now and then she looked at face at the bread and the cap and the black alpaca coat and a strange halffrightened halfunbelieving light filled her eyes
it had been like this for four days
lacey playing the part of samuel golden
never leaving the store
rosa preparing his meals acting her part in the grim little drama
waiting for the men to come back
the men who had crashed a blackjack off the jaw of samuel golden killed him
one manwith a gold tooth
hours like slow moving eternities
hours filled with suspense with tingling nerves
hours waiting watching that front door
under the counter close to hand was a submachinegun and a automatic
when customers came into the store he carried out the part of samuel golden
his stooped form stood erect
he smiled under his beard
and the girl was a thoroughbred
she sensed everything
she came running into the store to greet neighbor customers
she talked to them
she laughed
she sang
and she watched the front door
traffic moved endlessly through fallon street
the rumble of heavy wheels shook the building
the heat beat down mercilessly
across the street willie quirk lounged in his uniform
now and then he went into a store now and then he went from one end of the block to the other
there was a police whistle in his pocket
he had explicit directions on how and when to use that whistle
he played his part so well he nearly effaced himself
certainly no one gave him a second look
and then on the afternoon of the fourth day the girl rosa was in the back of the store singing
singing one of those deeptoned crooning things that made the heart liquid and her voice broke jaggedly in the middle of a strain
she stood staring at the door
the little bell over the door had jangled
the men had entered
lacey hardly turned his head
he looked at the girls face
it was enough
he knew the visitors he awaited had arrived
he got out of his seat slowly his hands resting on the counter
a in a white suit panama hat orchid silk shirt white sport shoes and a diamond ring bellied up to the counter
hi sam he said
there was a wicked glint in his eyes
the grin grew broader as he looked at the ugly purple bruise lacey had duplicated on his own face the jaw he asked
what
it didnot bust
cripes for an old guy you can take it
the second man was a ratfaced little punk with pinpoint irises and twitching hands
he mirrored the grin on the face of his companion
now and then he glanced through the window at the street
he was restless almost itching
he was overdressed
his face was sallow unhealthylooking
the mark of the drug addict was on him voice shook a little
what do you want he said in an old mans tones
the heavier of the two laughed loudly and poked the hophead in the ribs with an elbow
what do we want he mocked
how do you like that
he donot krnv what we want
he whirled suddenly stuck his face close to listen you punk he snarled through playin with you get it
from now on things are going to get toughbeginning right now
we figured that maybe that little rap on the teeth with a sap would wake you up to the fact that we ainot playing bean bag
you get the dough on the line and be glad youre getting off at bargain rates
twenty bucks a week is the price
and come up with itbe wisesave yourself grief
twenty dollars moaned lacey in a quavering voice
where should i get twenty dollars
i donot make twenty dollars hardly in a week
besides i donot want to belong to no business protective association or whatever it is
i donot need it positively
nothing is happening in this store
in ten years already nothing happens
his voice trailed away
you mean up to now laughed the spokesman with a grating sadism in his voice
now look were talking business and you may as well get used to it
from now on the guy who will make the collections see
i collect the membership fees
sure every friday like clockwork be around
and you better be ready for me see
we donot carry no delinquent customers
we leave that job to the hurryup wagon from bellevue
now kick through with this weeks dues
i donot want no trouble with you voice was the same stubborn monotone havenot got twenty dollars
i wonot pay
why donot you go away
i donot want to belong
i told you
the man in the white linen suit shrugged and looked at his ratfaced pal
well i guess we may as well start he said meaningly
the dopehead had a voice like a rat
sure he squeaked
might as well start
the man in the white suit made a sudden lunge forward
his hand grabbed for the beard in front of him to pull the bearded face toward him
a sap leaped out from under the sleeve of his coat
a sap with the loop around his wrist
this time you get it righthe grunted
and suddenly the bearded face in front of him glided out of reach
and at the same instant a white shaking hand came up from under the counter and the hand caressed a automatic
why you greasylooking louse screamed the man in the white suit
you got a rod huh
a little popgun
where in the hell do you get off being so brave all of a sudden
just for that going to break your arm
put that lousy rod down was suddenly looking at the glinting lights in the eyes over the beard eyes staring out from under the white bushy brows of an old man
but they were not old mans eyes
he took a step back
the girl rosa stood unmoving her hand resting on her heart
the black sap ugly dangerouslooking was still clutched in the beefy hand of the gorilla in the white suit
be so kindly said voice imitating the voice of samuel golden as rosa had described it to him to step across the storeface to the wall
the ratfaced punk made a sudden dive for a shoulder holster
there was a cracking sound like a dry stick breaking
the expression on the ratlike face changed stared
a crimson blotch spread over the fellows shoulder ran into the texture of the sport coat he wore dripped down the sleeve
against the wall kindly said lacey donot like shooting why you sap
you canot get away with something like this cursed the man in the white suit
the mob will come in here and take this place apart murder you
against the wallkindly urged quiet voice
the man in the white suit turned abruptly faced the wall walked forward
he plugged me
ratface mumbled through white trembling lips
the damned old mug plugged me
there was a whimper in the voice
shut your trap snarled the man in the white suit take care of this guy nutsraving
they stood there face to the wall hand half lifted
a gentle hand ran over their persons
the same gentle hand took a belly gun from the bird in the white suit tossed it behind the counter
just as gently it removed the uglylooking sap from around the right wrist
so youre coming every friday to collect is it said the gentle voice
every friday i should pay twenty good dollars to a gang of chiselers like you which go around hitting honest people with blackjacks
well i wouldnot pay it pay it snarled the voice of the man in the white suit
the old mans hand balanced the sap reflectively
the old mans voice said turn around
the man in the white suit turned his eyes swirling with hatred and rage
the old mans white hand suddenly went up the sap with it it cracked down
the sap hit the man in the white suit across the mouth
there was a nasty grating breaking sound as the sap broke teeth and mouth
ratface shrieked almost like a woman
so my friend
how does it feel to get hit across the mouth
the sap went up again
it smashed down a second time
across the bridge of the nose of the man in the white suit
there was a sickening crunching sound
the nose collapsed became a pulp a terriblelooking thing
blood spurted on the floor
quite calmly lacey looked at the ratfaced dopehead
he took a step forward screeched ratface
the sap fell
it ruined the ratface
it fell again this time on the collarbone
there was a breaking sound
so on fridays youll come asked voice calmly
so on fridays be waitinglike this
only it wonot be friday for you gonifs not for a lot of fridays
the door opened
a blue uniform filled the doorway
the cop on the beat walked into the store
he was grinning a little a tight white grin
the grin got a little sicklooking as he looked at the two faces in front of lacey couple of customers mr mulligan said lacey in samuel voice
good customers too
a little damaged maybe but good
maybe youll take them with you
leave em to me promised officer mulligan was just passin
he winked gimme something to occupy me mind
he grabbed the half dead gorillas by an arm each
the white linen suit on the bigger gorilla was bloodsoaked ruined
come oh said mulligan gruffly go for a ride
maybe when you get a chance to talk to these boys they could tell you something about who sent emmaybe sing promised mulligan when the boys downtown start askin the questions
he dragged the two men out with him
the girl rosa her eyes wide stared at face the face which looked so much like the face of her own father
a face with swirling grey steel green eyes crowded with the lust of battle
a the street willie quirk almost dancing in excitement but still acting the part of the random messenger boy followed the cop and the two ruined mobsmen
it was terrible said the girls deep voice
it was a cinch grinned lacey under the beard
but its only the beginning be back
only the little fellow was here before
the one with the thin face and funny eyes
the other man i didnot recognize
before it was a man with a gold tooth a big man
the sidewalk outside the store was milling with excitement
shirtsleeved men and perspiring women shoved and pushed to peer through the windows into the golden store
chattering voices and excited yelpings filled the street drowned out the noises of the traffic
men rushed into the store shook hands in emotional hysteria with the man they believed to be samuel golden
women wept and screeched and looked frightened
after a while a horde of newspaper men descended on the scene
a hot story
photo bulbs flared inside the store of samuel golden
reporters shot questions
at five oclock the evening papers came through fallon street and fallon street grabbed them avidly
there was a big picture of samuel golden on the front page of the papers and a big black headline
the caption under the picture stated meek storekeeper half kills two thug extortionists
there were pictures of the two thugs
they did look half killed
features swollen
eyes closed to slits
mouths crushed out of shape
pictures taken in the precinct station by grinning reporters
the running story with the photos said believe it or not but a stooped kindlyeyed bearded little man sere with the years which have sprinkled snow upon his head today defended the sanctity of his home and business so well that he handed out a terrific beating to two habitual tough guys
the tough guys have police records as long as the beard of samuel golden who vanquished them
reporters viewing the remains of the two muscle men who attempted to levy tribute on golden found it difficult to believe that a man slight to the point of selfeffacement modest as a whisper looking belligerent as the proverbial lamb could so manhandle twice his weight in hoodlums
but there is no doubt of what occurred in the little notions store of samuel golden this afternoon
the two racketeers representing a merchants protective association demanded tribute from golden on threats of physical violence to his person and injury to his property
the lamb swung into action took from the two hoods the artillery they carried for selfprotection and worked them over to the queens taste
officer mulligan cop on the beat which includes fallon and orchid streets entered the store after the smoke of battle had cleared away and half carried the two semiconscious tough guys to the nearest police call box
all in all samuel golden wrote himself a oneman declaration of independence from the vicious extortion racket and racketeering which has fallon street and its environs by the throat
a few more fighters like samuel golden would make racketeering impossible
fallon street read the story
fallon street looked at the picture of samuel golden on the front page and at the picture of big mike cleary and tony piazzini whom the police had identified as the collectors for the merchants protective association
fallon street looked at samuel golden in the flesh and was a bit dazed by it all
but fallon street crowded the golden store to pay tribute to its hero a modest hero who contented himself with waving gentle protests with smiling a little and permitting rosa golden to do all the talking
tommygun party paced the thick chinese rug which covered the floor of his private office
he clutched a late afternoon edition of the newstelegram in his right hand
his left hand was jammed into the pockets of his tailored trousers
his thin strangely white face was cold as ice and his black eyes swirled with anger
there was a suggestion of cruelty about the exquisitely molded features of mr moore
the nose a trifle too thin and mobile suggested the wolf
the thin almost colorless mouth added to the illusion
the manner in which he wore his hair sleek drawn sharply back from his forehead added to the animal likeness
the expensive materials and tailoring of the lounge suit he wore did nothing to dispel the illusion
neither did the gardenia in his buttonhole
in a chair set beside a massive rosewood desk sat a floridfaced man with a gold incisor
little blue veins ran about the mans nose
he had a massive head slightly bald with greying sandy hair
his mouth was largelipped
his teeth were clamped down on a cigar
he chewed at the cigar
there was a worried almost furtive look in his bloodshot grey eyes
his hands were soft and white pudgy with good living and he wore a threecarat diamond on the third finger of his left hand
his clothing was almost as expensively fashioned as he was uncomfortable
there as the suggestion of invisible perspiration about him
now and then he squirmed in the chair as he looked at thin white face
at the end of the rug mr moore turned suddenly faced the man with the gold tooth
his voice was cold almost plaintive but seething with a carefully controlled undercurrent of fury
the trouble with you angelo said mr moore to the gentleman beside the rosewood desk is that i canot trust you with the execution of even petty details
aw mr moore protested angelo
the guy went raving nuts
he couldnot get away with a play like that again in a million years
he just kind of took mike and tony by surprise
hell
they didnot expect that golden mug to pull a rod on em
they figured after that sock on the jaw this golden would be all softened up like everybody else and that it was just a business of walking in and making the collection
but the little goof must have gone nuts
to pull a stunt like that
look at this paper invited moore coldly
how do you think that will react on all of ourclients
suppose they suddenly band themselves together decide from the protective association refuse to pay theirer dues
listen boss growled angelo
you lemme handle this business
i know how to take care of that golden punk and how to keep the rest of those babies in line going to make an example of this golden
when i get finished with him hell payif hes able run with the dough in his hand
and so will those other suckers down there in fallon street
if they have any fancy ideas put em to sleep quick
mr eyes looked at angelo afraidreally i am afraid angelo that perhaps you are getting a littlehow do you put itsoft
you donot stand prosperity well
you fail to take care of details properly
this golden case proves it
i do all the work and all the planning and take care of all the legal technicalities involved
you have only the simple execution of orders and yet you involve the organization in something like this
really its inexcusable
it ainot nothin but an accident like i said that can happen to anybody insisted angelo said take care of that monkeyand i will show that guy
and we had fallon street so well organized mourned mr moore
everything going so smoothly the dues are paid so promptly
really it isa crime to permit something like this to happen
he threw the crumpled paper on top of the desk
his eyes were slits
his mouth drew away from his teeth a little
his teeth were white and small and sharp
his voice was still calm still cold but like the slashing of a wolfs fangs shall expect you to straighten this matter out he said am impatient with failures
i will not tolerate failures
i cannot personally take care of the little details connected with the running of this organization
if you donot take care of it properly or if this affair assumes serious proportions i am afraid i shall have to part company with you angelo
it seemed that a little shudder ran up the spine of angelo
he sat in the chair his eyes fixed on the white aristocratic face of mr moore
eyes in which lurked a sudden fear almost terror
perspiration broke out in beads on his forehead
his hands opened and closed spasmodically
aw gee boss he said huskily all angelo said mr moore and his voice was almost kindly
you may go now expecting you to justify my confidence in you
angelo came up out of the chair
you leave it to me he growled give that punk a dose of medicine that will make him well for the rest of his life
he backed out of the office bumping into a chair on the way his hat still in his hand the light of worry and fear still in his eyes
he left mr herbert slocum moore to the contemplation of a corot landscape hanging on the wall of the exquisitely appointed office
a contemplation made up of a frown a snarling mouth and tightly clenched hands still in the role of samuel golden sat in the darkness of the store near the window looking out on fallon street
his eyes were closed his body relaxed
the grey beard fell down upon his chest
the black skullcap on his head completed a picture of repose
from the living quarters behind the store the deep contralto voice of rosa golden crooned a russian gypsy song
crooned it with a passionate love for the music crooned it her throat and mouth seeming to caress each note
now and then she moved across the doorway became a silhouette against the yellow glow of light
her body was tall and straight her head carried proudly
now and then lacey opened his eyes a little and looked at her
now and then he shifted the position of the tommy gun lying across his knees
night had stilled fallon street
the heavy rumble of wheeled traffic was gone
only a random street car clanged and crashed its way over rails
between the street cars there was silence
the pushcarts along the curbs were covered over against the night and the merchants vanished
even the children had disappeared
the footsteps of hurrying passersby echoed hollowly from the buildings
the street lamps threw a fitful illumination only living thing in fallon street seemed to be that crooning voice of rosa golden
the quiet was heavy oppressive like the quiet before the unleashing of a summer thunder storm
a black sedan rolled slowly through fallon street
it was showing parking lights only
it rolled around the corner disappeared
lacey glanced at it followed it with his eyes
a figure in od serge a messenger boy flitted through the shadows darted across the street came to the door of the golden store entered
willie impishlooking face was touched for an instant by a street light
his face was tense his eyes snapping
get ready chief thats them he said
you sure asked lacey
sure a black car
four guys in it a cinch they were giving the joint a case the first time around
when they come back its the business voice was like the crack of a whip lash
okay willie
beat it back across the street
you know what to do and when
keep out of the business
get it
out
aw gee chief protested willie
scram
the od serge uniform drifted back across the street was swallowed up in the shadows
lacey strode into the living quarters behind the store
he carried the tommy gun in one hand
the round pan with its hundred rounds was slung over the gun
rosa golden looked at him her eyes wide
her voice seemed swallowed by her throat donot want you to be frightened rosa said lacey havenot but a minute to talk coming
i want you to go out in the backyard
you wonot be in any danger there
go out and stayuntil its over
i think this will be the last visit
there was a terribly grim something in his voice and the steely depths of his eyes were swirling not afraid the girl said in a steady voice
if there is danger i should share it
i should not let you a hurry ordered lacey
stay there
he almost pushed her by main strength out into the darkness of the backyard
he put out the lights in the living quarters
he ran across the store in half a dozen steps opened the door quietly went out onto the sidewalk of fallon street
there were three galvanized iron ash cans on the sidewalk near the curb
they were heavy and filled with ashes
they were arranged in a strange pattern
they had been there for four days
they formed a breastworks a dozen feet east of the entrance to the notions store of samuel golden
lacey crouched on his knees behind the cans
he held the tommy gun in his hands the muzzle behind the top of the cans
he was breathing through set teeth
the silence was heavy oppressive
then at the west end of the block the lights of a car swung into fallon street
it passed under the first street lamp
it was a black sedan running with parking lights
it eased over to the south curb running slowly
it ran more slowly as it drew abreast of the golden store
suddenly the windows of the car were rolled down and the machine came to a momentary halt
three black objects flew out of the car crashed through the plate glass window of the store
the muzzle of an automatic submachinegun was thrust out of the car
it began to vomit flame to buck and jump with the recoil
the chattering staccato filled the canyon of fallon street with a typhoon of noise
the most murderous noise in the world
the interior of the golden store seemed to erupt flame and concussion
the roar of three closely separated explosions shook the street
there was the sound of splintering and showering glass
wood blasted to splinters flew through the air
bits of bricks and stonework swirled madly fell with a clatter
a voice from the black sedan yelled okay go bet that damn mug kicks through now
the voice was answered by a laugh
behind the ash barrels lacey a white grin on his face rested the muzzle of his tommy gun on the top of a barrel
his finger crooked around the trigger
the engine in the car raced roared
the car lurched forward
at that moment lacey squeezed the trigger of his gun
the muzzle spat flame and destruction
the windshield of the black sedan disappeared
there were momentary screams from within the car
the car rolled over the sidewalk crashed into a wall spilled over on its back and above every other sound was the terrible rivethammerlike firing of tommy gun
after a minute the gun went dead in his hands the ammunition expended the gun whitehot
he knelt there looking at the wreck of the black sedan
then he got to his feet took his automatic from his vest pocket walked slowly toward the overturned car
a the street willie quirk blew one shrill blast on his police whistle
at almost the same instant a squad car with a submachinegun operator came around into fallon street stopped with a squealing of brakes
lacey was standing over the wreck of the car a queer tense expression on his face
he watched while the cops pulled riddled bodies out of the car
watched the expressions on the faces of the cops
he watched until the morgue wagon came up until fallon street was in the midst of a seething excitement such as it had never known with men and women half dressed thronging the street
men and women looking at the explosiongutted remains of samuel store and at the bearded face of samuel golden who stood with a tommy gun in his hands
be careful of that mug with the gold tooth whispered lacey
he was in the back seat and i tried not to hurt him much
i want to talk to that guy later
take good care of him and save him
he belongs to me
the sergeant on the detail nodded
the morgue wagon pulled away
lacey went into the ruins of the store into the backyard
he found rosa golden standing there her face white a little trickle of blood running from her cheek where a splinter had scratched her
is it all over she asked tonelessly
lacey looked at her face all over he said got a little mopping up to dobut that gang is going to leave fallon street alone from now on
suddenly she seemed to collapse
he put his arm around her the arm holding the tommy gun
he held her with the wreckage of everything her life had been tumbled and heaped about her in ghastly debris willie quirk was standing in the shadows of the ruined building
look willie growled lacey take care of miss golden here stay with her till i come back wonot be long
then the stooped figure still in the likeness of samuel golden made its way through the blackened ruins of the little store and disappeared fallon street triumph of the homicide squad threw open the door of the little room and kicked a bloody snarling figure inside
a gold tooth was prominent in the mouth of the bloody face
the little room was without windows
when the door was closed it was like a cell
the walls were a dead white
there was one chair in the room
a plain wooden kitchen chair
the floor was concrete
the walls were thick and sound proof
there was a tripod in one corner of the room a tripod with a brilliant reflector and a twothousandwatt lamp
johnson looked at the man
he grinned
you look like hell angelo he said almost cheerfully
but donot let that worry you going to look a lot worse
there was a muffled knock on the door
johnson crossed the room threw the door open
four men came inside
they were big men with huge shoulders
two hundred pounders
they were in sweatshirts and gym pants
they were grinning
grinning with icy eyes
they looked at the man
they looked at johnson
suddenly the atmosphere within the room became grim taut called you boys in because i want you to meet angeloangelo vittori said johnson pleasantly
maybe you boy have met angelo before a big shot
yes sir a big shot boys
angelo is in the gouge racket
he runs a protective association over fallon street way
does his collecting with pineapples and tommy guns and blackjacks you angelo
there was an ugly glinting light eyes
there was a silence
angelo vittori sat in the middle of the room on the kitchen chair
why the hell donot you go to work and cut out the gags he snarled
you might as well get in your licks now be sprung out of this rat trap as soon as my mouthpiece gets the news
until thenamuse yourselves
i can take it
i tell you he was a big shot nodded johnson to the sweatshirted detectives
the four men grinned mirthlessly and their hands opened and closed spasmodically
they looked at johnson for the cue
angelo and his partners went drumming up business tonight
they threw the works into a little store on fallon street pineapple and tommygun business from the street
only something happened all so strange
just when they were ready to roll away in a nice new caddy a tommy gun picks em up and angelo here is the only survivor he lucky
those terrible mirthless grins were turned on angelo vittori
he sat there his mouth snarling sweat running down over his eyes from his scalp mixing with the smear of blood on his face your boss angelo asked johnson suddenly in a low whisper
go to hell
come on whos your boss insisted johnson
you can save yourself a lot of grief by playing this straight
you heard me
a sweatshirted sleeve suddenly swung
there was the crack of knuckles across mouth
blood spurted from under the knuckles
say sir to the inspector you chean punk growled a voice or feed you your own teeth tongue lapped up the blood on his mouth
his eves swirled as he looked at the detective
big brave guy he sneered
see how brave youll be in the hot squat said johnson sweetly
under the blood and hate face was suddenly white
his eyes glistened
where the hell do you guys get that hot squat stuff he said in the same sneering voice
but there was a brittleness mixed with the fear and fear crawled in his eyes
why donot you know
they still fry gorillas in this state for murder said johnson in a patient voice
you guys must think youve got an amateur snarled vittori
what dya meanmurder
you canot frame me
i ainot bumped nobody off
and beat this other rap the minute i get sprung
i got connections you mugs got connections said johnson in a reverent whisper for the benefit of the four sweatshirted detectives
connections
he looked down at face
now thats interesting he said
who are the connections angelo
big enough to tear that tin badge off you and send you back to flatfooting it in the sticks
important people eh
whadda you think
oh i admit it nodded johnson have to have connections
somebody with brainsto tell you what to do
yeah
well lemme tell you this there was another crack of knuckles on teeth
speak when you are spoken to hood said the husky voice
so you think youre not going to fry eh said johnson
you said it
i can beat any sour rap you guys can frame up
and you donot want to tell me who your boss is be silly looked at him for a minute
he looked at the men in the room with him
after a moment he said and he was still smiling bring in mr identify him mike
a sweatshirted figure went to the door opened it went out
he returned in a minute and with him came the counterpart of samuel golden
the lights went down in the room only the cruel white light beat on the face of angelo vittori
mr golden said johnson look at this man closely
ever see him before
cut out the comedy growled vittori answer
sure he saw me
sam golden
he runs that store on fallon street right isnot it mr golden asked johnson quietly
the mouth under the beard moved
an old mans voice nervous answered right mr johnson coming to my store to make me join a union which i am not wanting to join asking me twenty dollars a weekdues hes calling it refusing to pay
i donot make so much
so he hits sam golden an old man with a blackjack which he is carrying up his sleeve eyes were looking at angelo vittori
his mouth was smiling but the eyes were deadly
and youre not going to burn he asked in the same soft voice
listen what is this
where do you get that burn stuff
vittori eyes were scornful
well anyhow you hit him with a sap is that it
there was sudden quiet in the room
you hit sam golden an old man with a sap because he wouldnot pay dues to your protective association
so i hit him with a sap
so what
so make something of it growled angelo beat that rap too
and that fry stuff donot kid me
i ainot killed nobody
i donot never kill nobody
only chumps go round bumpin guys off no chump
sure hit golden a little love tap to soften him up
but that ainot killin
and be out of here in twp hours
the men in the room took a long breath
they smiled a little more
they looked at vittori
so you hit samuel golden with a blackjack because he wouldnot pay dues in the protective association
johnson seemed to caress the words as they came out of his mouth
you can hear canot you snarled angelo
and so what
the old mans hands went up to his head
very slowly
his eyes were fixed on angelo face
the hands took off the skullcapdeliberately tossed the black object into lap
then just as slowly the same hands manipulated an old mans wig took it off almost like scalping himself revealing closecropped brickred hair under the wig
and little by little the hands worked at the spirit gum and the beard came away from the jaws
the beard followed the skullcap and the wig onto knees sat there his face ghastly staring
his throat worked
his eyes stared
as a last gesture the cunningly contrived lines were wiped off the old mans face on the back of a sweatshirt
and red lacey stood in the room still dressed in samuel threadbare pants and alpaca coatbut red lacey
remember me vittori asked voice coldly
the name is lacey
there was a hoarse cry in voice
hey what the hell is this
what the hell is this guy going around dressed like golden for the angle
did you say you werenot going to fry angelo asked johnson in a voice that suddenly held a chill an icy chill
did you say youd beat the rap
did you say you hit golden on the jaw with a sap but that was not killing
sure i said it
there was a little shriek in the voice wrong as hell angelo said johnson
it was murder
he was dead when you were running out of the store after you conked him with the blackjack
he was an old manyou killed him hands clutched at the air a lie
a plant damn it
the boys see him in the store after that he half kill tony and big mike cleary when they go around to collect he get his mug in the papers
what
an old man like sam golden beating up two tough guys like mike and tony chided johnson
angelo
when brains were passed out you didnot hear the dinner bell
the gentleman who gave mike and tony the rocking and socking was mr lacey here
all dressed up like sam golden
sure using you guys as suckers
making you come back and dig your own graves wiping you out
the whole mangy squealing pack of you
spilling your blood on the same street where you spilled sam he got you allall but youand your boss
he turn page a it would be thrilling to inherit a lot of money but theres a bigger thrill in making it yourself in being your own rich uncle
and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you remember this your biggest help toward success is good health
but you canot be healthy if youre constipated
perhaps nothing does so much to pull down your energy and dull your ambition
poisonous wastes in your system always drag at your health
you canot keep at the top of your form unless you get rid of them
so if you want to feel better if you want to step up your energy if you want a quick mind and a vigorous body remember this one thing see that your bowels move regularly
but the way you move your bowels is important
instead of taking a laxative that disturbs your system and upsets your stomach take gentle exlax
exlax limits its action entirely to the intestines where the actual constipation exists
it gives the intestines a gentle nudge emptying the bowels thoroughlybut easily and comfortably
exlax works in such a simple commonsense way
and it is such a pleasure to take
exlax tastes just like delicious chocolate
available at all drug stores in economical 10c and 25c sizes
in and saved you twofor something better
for the hot squat
suddenly angelo vittori collapsed in the chair
his eyes stared down at the skullcap and the beard and the wig
you guys wouldnot kid me about something like this would you he whimpered
naw we wouldnot kid you angelo nodded johnson on the level
sam golden is dead
you killed him
and in my neighborhoodalmost on my own corner snarled lacey ought to go to work on you just for the exercise
and so youre going to burn
and your boss who got the important dough from the racket is going to like hell he is screamed vittori
his face was purple his eyes staring see that rat squirm too took enough of his lip and the phony scent and the fishy stare
sure he was going to put me on the spothave me taken care of if i didnot handle this golden business
sure he told me that today
well he ainot going to sit in that picture gallery and eat off gold plates and look at guys as if they were worms while i fry
to hell with him
ah sighed johnson
now we are getting somewhere
go get him screamed vittori
bring him down here
throw him in a lousy cell
see how that fits his park avenue clothes and his harvard line of talk
let him lay on the cement and feel the lice crawl over him
who the hell is he anyway
yeah whispered johnson
who is he
moore spat vittori venomously
mr herbert slocum moore of the park avenue moores the front for this mob his racket
us guys got nickels
he got the dough
moore echoed lacey
moore the big shot lawyer
ten grand retaining fees
moore marveled johnson
the chairman of the board of the borland bank
moore echoed the four sweatshirted detectives
they ran tongues over mouths
gardenias
striped pants
silk hat
box at the opera
nothing less than the supreme court for him
moore voice was grating not a liar are you angelo asked johnson softly
naw i ainot a liar
get him
bring him down here got the proof
you guys will be able to fry two eggs
he laughed wildly a cackle
he isnot lying said lacey grimly heard things about this guy moore
put em away for future reference
what are we waiting for
put him away boys said johnson to the sweatshirted detectives with a nod toward vittori
mr lacey and i have a date uptown
park avenue butler parted the curtains to the drawing room of the magnificent apartment and announced with great dignity inspector william johnson and mr richard lacey sir
mr moore smiled got up from behind a great walnut desk bowed at the hips
please come in gentlemen he said for being in dressing gown but after all it is an ungodly hour in the morning to get a man out of bed
but anything to aid the police
johnson looked at him
at the sleek hair and the gold and black dressing gown at the richness of the room and the wolflike features of herbert slocum moore
may i offer you gentlemen your first cigar of the day smiled moore
he lifted a walnut box that matched the desk opened the lid held it toward lacey and johnson
no thanks said johnson gruffly use them said lacey
he was watching eyes
moore sank down in a chair behind the desk
and now inspector on the mind of the police force so early in the morning am here to arrest you as an accessory before the fact of murder committed upon the person of samuel golden voice droned ominously within the dead stillness of the apartment
moore drew a long breath rather early to play jokes isnot it he demanded
really its a little out of taste
he reached for a cigar his hand stopping halfway across the desk no joke moore snapped johnson got angelo slocum moore stood in front of his desk the automatic in his hand half raised
there was a look of polite surprise on his face
then his mouth sagged open and his eyes glazed and he fell forward his head smashing inertly against the heavy top of the walnut desk
johnson was across the room in three strides
he looked at moore and then he looked up at red lacey
damn it he beefed at lacey you ever miss with that lousy popgun you carry through c the the progress a complete mystery novel featuring the greatest outlawsleuth by worldfamed originator of tori
he killed golden with a blackjack days ago he spilled everything
he wants to have you in the next cell downtown and in the death house
vittori said moore blankly
vittori
really his hand reached in the cigar box
then he leaped from the chair
there was the glint of indirect light on the vicious blackness of gunmetal voice yelped duck got a gat
there was the sound of a breaking stick in the room
it sounded twice that and the smell of burning powder
he picked up the phone dialed police headquarters eyes were looking around the room at the rich paintings and tapestries
his eyes were swirling
and he got this stuff out of the sweat and blood and misery of fallon street he growled in his throat too bad he wonot make the trip with angelo
the two of them waited until tne wrecking crew came up from headquarters the great stage the lights were low except a spot which touched the rapt face of the girl who sang
below in the orchestra pit a muted violin played an obligato and accompaniment above the hushed ensemble of the orchestra
i the first row red lacey in dinner jacket sat beside willie quirk his eyes staring at the face of the girl who sang at her half closed eyes listening to that warm voice which came out of her soul listening to the supplication which seemed going up out of the great theater up to heaven itself
eliiiiiii rosa golden on stage before two thousand people singing her heart out tears rolling down her cheeks
singing as she sang once in a little notions store on fallon street
rosa golden in jet black her black hair falling down over her shoulders in a glorious cascade
the voice came to a murmuring stop
there was a long instant of silence in the theater with the two thousand sitting almost trancelike
then a tumult of applause a thundering ovation
and she stood white the tears still rolling down her face trying to smile trying to thank the two thousand a riot willie quirk said in an awed voice great
gee from fallon street to herethats something made it said lacey queerly
his eyes were looking at the girls face his eyes just a little wet a long long journeyand the fare is plenty
remember that day in the car going through fallon street told you dreams were born theredreams voice trailed away
sure
well look up see what i mean
a little fellow with a black skullcap and a beard dreamed this dream and gave it to his daughter
so the little fellows dream came trueonly he isnot here tonight guess that was part of the fare
ah it only cost a nickel to get uptown from fallon and orchid sajd willie vaguely nickel and pain and blood and misery and hunger
he looked at willie for a moment and suddenly hugged him with one arm
okay go he grinned had enough of the highbrow environment for tonight got to feed it to you in small doses
a waterfront mystery novelette by john hawkins the odds are all against you when you buy unknown razor blades
play safe
get the doubleedged smoothshaving probak jr product of the worlds largest blade maker
buy a package today junior steve lake slides out of favor on hot icebut cool thinking lays a trap for a killer
imagination by author of hot dough brute kill etc stood in the echoing corridor of police headquarters in centre street and stared glumly at the door through which he must presently enter
it was a simple oldfashioned door half of wood half of frosted glass
and on the glass in gold leaf lettering was printed steve lake had to go through that door
standing here he was a detective thirdgrade in the jewelry squad
but after he went in there he would be a patrolman a flatfoot assigned to some precinct in the bronx where he could break his arthes on a long beat
in short they were going to bust steve lake
if he had deserved this break he could have pushed his chin out and gone in to take his medicine
but to be broken to a harness bull simply because older policemen in the de34 partment were jealous of his quick promotion aroused his anger at injustice
was it his fault that he chased three bandits escaping from a drug store stickup and shot it out with them killing one and wounding the other two after he himself had been shot down
was it his fault that commissioner harkness anxious for favorable publicity had publicly commended him and then announced that patrolmen of such courage should be rewarded and promoted him to detective thirdgrade
he took a deep breath got a new bite on his gum
standing there thinking wasnot going to help
he had been put on the dewarr stickup because the guys that hated him knew he couldnot break the case
and he hadnot
it didnot matter that the dewarr holdup was a perfect job without a clue that einstein himself couldnot solve it
he had flopped and hed have to pay the price of failure
someone calling his name broke his reflections
hey lake telephone for you couldnot imagine anything important coming over the phone but he seized on the interruption to postpone his appearance before inspector riordan
he hastened back to the jewelry bureau
the two older dicks ignored him except to nod coldly to the phone
lake picked up the receiver said hello
lissen lake came a rasping nervous voice this is gimpy martin
watchu willin to pay for a hot tip on the dewarr stickup
gimpy martin was a fink a stoolpigeon
he had also been what is called a punk or a gang hangeron
every new york dick cultivates and builds up his own sources of information through stoolpigeons
and lake had caught gimpy trying to push in an east side cutrate jewelry store
he held this charge over gimpy and bought occasional hot underworld tips from gimpy at ten dollars a tip
he was reliable facie grew tauta lead at last
he might still break the dewarr case and stave off the loss of his shield
he said pay plenty
what have you got
bring fifty bucks around to the barkley hotel said gimpy cunningly and belch an earful
the line clicked and went dead
lake put the receiver back on the cradle
old pieter van hoosen who had been a cop when steve wore diapers growled gruffly inspector riordan just called and says for you to hop in and make it snappy
lake smiled
if you boys are waiting around for the funeral you may have a long wait
he strode briskly into inspector office
hello chief he forced a smile
detective lake reporting
you mean patrolman lake reporting corrected inspector riordan
he was a big leathery man with a square face a square jaw and hard disillusioned eyes
now wait a minute inspector lake began and told him of the new development withholding only name as was customary
with this lead lake concluded think i can bust this case wide open
maybe you could inspector expression did not change only its been busted wide open settled
the diamonds have been returned
what
lake was staggered you read the papers riordan held up a noon edition of the sphere
in black headlines across eight columns it read and in lesser type asah stone famous private detective returns one hundred thousand dollars in gems to dewarrs after police fail to break case eyes sped down the thick blocks of grey printing and he was sick at what he read
it was asah stone this and asah stone that the renowned private detective the brilliant private sleuth who had ceeded where the police had failed
but when you got rid of all the compliments and the literary efforts of a reporter trying to pad out a story it summed down to this that asah stone by means which he had not revealed had recovered the hundred thousand dollars in diamonds stolen from mrs jonathan dewarr when she had been held up in her suite at the hotel superbe a fortnight ago there was something else too that steve read with a sick heart
set two columns wide in bold black type was a short editorial boxed at the top of the page entitled it said a lot of bitter terrible things about inefficiency hinted at graft and corruption and political stupidity and wound up by saying has it come to this in our city that a private detective can succeed where eighteen thousand policemen fail
is asah stone more brilliant than our two thousand wow muttered lake
he knew that the sphere was against the present police commissioner but this was the boldest most vicious attack yet made
wow is right growled riordan
the first thing harkness did was to call me and have you suspended on charges of inefficiency
and thats where you are now
the goat said lake bitterly sent to join the other goats in the bronx worse than that lad said riordan probably be dismissed from the force
harkness is in a spot and somebody has to take the fail
lake recoiled
his anger flushed his face red
but they passed up older men to stick me on this case because they wanted to see me busted he yelled
they wanted to reduce me because older men were jealous department politics riordan said coldly
you laid an egg on this case and you pay
he held out his hand take your shield
slowly lake unpinned the shining shield
how proud he had been of it
blowing on it to polish off the moisture proud of it looking upon it as a symbol of high duty
riordan took the bit of metal and flipped it into the drawer
he sat silent indicating that the interview was over
lake said suddenly well if asah stone recovered the diamonds where is the pinch
who did he turn over for the job stared disgustedly
he didnot pinch anybody
he just made a deal with the thieves and got back the jewels
he snorted
how dumb are you anyway
you know asah stone is retained by most of the big insurance companies
those diamonds were insured for a hundred thousand dollars
if asah stone can make contact with the thieves and offer them fifty grand no questions asked they take it
mrs dewarr gets back her diamonds
the thieves get an easy fifty grand and the insurance company saves fifty thousand dollars
but thats compounding a felony protested lake just urging these bandits to go ahead and keep on knocking off rich dames who wear too many jewels
maybe that accounts for the sixteen big jewel stickups in the past year
riordan twisted impatiently
the trouble with you steve is that you havenot got any imagination
you canot figure beyond cause and effect why satisfied youll never make a detectivebeat it now busy
the bright sunshine on centre street seemed pale and weak as steve lake stumbled to the curb
mechanically he tossed away his gum unwrapped another stick folded it and put it in his mouth
the first shock had passed his fury was under control imagination got to do with being a dick he muttered
suddenly his teeth clicked
he waved down a cab
fulton and broadway he growled and sank back against the cushions
he didnot move all during the trip
at the corner of fulton and broadway he climbed two flights of stairs and entered an office whose door bore the sign private investigator to the girl at the desk he said hi sweetheart is the man marvel in
she went on smearing lipstick with the tip of her right little finger
he just came in
i donot know whether he sees dicks with broken arches not your sweetheart
lake grinned right you belong to the world
he pressed on before she could reply to the door marked private
he opened without knocking but evidently the girl had pressed a buzzer for asah stone was standing smiling toward him
well well he chuckled if it isnot steve lake the harmonica player in person the oneman band asah stone looked like a smoothie
he was tall with broad shoulders
he had smartly cut grey hair narrow grey eyes
he wore a grey suit and his thin long grey face had the wary expression of one who knew all the answers
looking at him steve thought of a clever grey fox
a was a guy going places
the best night spots saw him he squired the snappiest looking blondes
he spent big money and got his name in the paper often enough to have a reputation as the best private dick in he charged accordingly hello said lake
he kept his dislike for asah stone out of his eyes
deduction tells me said stone that youve come about the dewarr diamonds
you must do it with mirrors rejoined lake
what i want to know is will there be a pinch in the dewarr case
how did you recover the diamonds and one question at a time laughed stone happen to know that you donot own a badge any longerthat if youre lucky youll wear your heels to the ankle shuffling around in harness
but at that willing to tell you a few things
go ahead lake kept his moutn stretched in a forced grin
there will be no pinch stated asah stone
first because this was a dicker i made as representative of the insurance companies to save them money
second i donot know who did the job anyway
he gestured to lake invited him to approach the flattopped desk
here is the record he continued put an advertisement in the sphere to make contact with the thieves
read it if you want to
the advertisement was answered by this letter the words cut as you can see from daily newspapers
they or he or she asked fifty grand talked with the consolidated insurance people and they okayed the price
i put another ad in the sphere accepting
there it is
and heres the reply telling me to put up the dough in old fivebuck bills and check the package at grand central terminal
he grinned smartly at lake
neat but not gaudy eh
go on said lake grimly
asah stone shrugged was to walkas you can read in the instructionsto the twentieth century train gate
i was to drop the check
i did so
a guy picked it up and handed it back to me
it wasnot the same check
i walked to the checking booth and turned in my stub
the package i got contained the diamonds all
not quite said lake quietly
you saw the guy that handed you the substitute stub
no corrected asah stone deliberately didnot look at him so i wouldnot have to testify
lake stared at him a racket he muttered
you and the thieves and the insurance company dishing somebody out of fifty grand your cut
the insurance company pays me an annual retainer
then therell be no pinch no clues
asah stone shrugged paid to recover the jewels not to grab hot boys
if you had any imagination youd see that
it donot take any imagination to see that you connive with thieves
asah stone flushed redly
are you insinuating a crook wouldnot know now snapped steve
how did those thieves know youd play ball
before they had the dough they gave you the check stub
how did they know but what having got the check stub you might have slipped them a package of cut newspaper got a reputation for playing square
settled other cases like this
fifteen stone said softly
so what
so keeping on digging
i might turn up plenty thrust his chin out came close another crack and the last
get to hell out of here
he made the mistake of giving lake a rough shove
the trigger on anger snapped home
his right arm swung up throwing four hard knuckles and riding behind the punch one hundred and eighty pounds of fightingmad cop
the knuckles clicked on jaw just as the private dick himself threw a punch
a large engraved black onyx ring on his hand scratched forehead
but asah stone himself went backward
he lit on the back of his neck and did not get up
lake rubbed his forehead looked at the onyx ring cutting ring he said a fool but i feel better now
he backed to the door
stone glared at him
in twenty minutes punk every cop in new york will be looking for you to make a pinch for assault and battery not only see you dishonorably discharged but see you in stir for that blow
nuts said lake
he turned and went out of the office down to the stairway
lake went down to the bright sunshine of the street
he stood for a moment wiping the scratch on his forehead with a handkerchief
steve darling said a voice that snapped him upright with a thrill of joy figured youd be here
and heres me to give you an earful
lake grinned at her
hello scrumptious have to put off getting married until i get my shield back put it off until i say yes marjorie steele said and that wonot be until the sixth friday in october a career gal your career will be cooking corned beef and cabbage and raising a mess of kids
they started walking up broadway immodest she smiled
but cut out the cracking got news
good news
if you had any imagination it would be
listen
i was around to the to see about an interview on why bigbosomed lasses wear diamonds
i learned from her that the diamonds had been recovered
i immediately suspected asah crooked hand and dropped by here to check with him before i wrote my story
and who do you think i saw going into asah office eyes gleamed
it wasnot santa claus scrumptious
it may be santa claus to you she retorted
darling it was moxie ardery
not the beautiful boy bandit
the longlashed peachskinned little rat himself she nodded
lake stood very quietly then pulled out a crumpled package of cigarettes straightened one lit it handed it to marjorie and then lit one for himself
stand very quiet lovely he said until i think this through got an idea and since it didnot tear my head open maybe its good
he stared abstractedly across city hall park
moxie ardery was notorious from one end of broadway to the other as a youth of twentyfive who had started out as a punk and had become in a few years the smartest bandit in the game
his downy skin and handsome looks got him into the better hotels where women fell for him and he sized up a lone woman or a husband and wife with jewels
the jewels were stolen either by a sneak thief or at the point of a gun
moxie was never caught with the goods and if arrested had an alibi is an underworld term meaning smart having lots on the ball
moxie ardery had all that
the connection between him and the dewarr diamonds was obvious
the proof of his guilt was something else again
the fact that he came to see asah stone was important enough to show moxie as the probable intermediary to settle the details of returning the diamonds
but you couldnot prove that
in short as lake realized about all this tipoff was good for was to make information of value
he had to see the stoolie at once
he raised a hand hailed a cab
where are you going
marge demanded going to see a man about a horse grinned lake
thanks scrumptious
have dinner with me tomorrow night and give you santa lucia on the new harmonica a honey
he got into the cab and marjorie climbed in beside him go for the dinner but god forbid i have to hear you play
lead on i smell a story for the sphere
if i break this youll have a story he agreed grimly
this is what you people call a ring of jewel thieves
there are plenty of brains behind it
there was silence for a while until marge suddenly said be a great detective if you had imagination to go with your memory for facts
hey lay off growled lake
detectives donot need imagination been reading books
marjorie sighed
skip it lovey
and so nothing was said until they reached the barkley hotel on third avenue
the barkley was a cheap hotel where for a few dollars a week you got a room with a key to it within walking distance of a bathroom
gimpy had a room on the fourth floor a walkup that left both steve and marge without wind
the corridor even in daylight was lit by the sickly glow from a drop cord bulb
the numerals twentysix were penciled on the chipped front of a door
lake knocked me gimpy he said steve lake
he heard no sound and rattled the door knob impatiently
then he pounded
open up gimpy
still silence
lake looked suddenly at marge
she was pale and suddenly her eyes were wide with intuitive horror
lake hurled himself at the door
his broad shoulders rebounded and he hit again
this time the flimsy lock gave and he sprawled inside
one look was enough
stay out there kid he rapped
but she was already behind him
he felt her sway against him
my god she muttered dead
he wasnot sung to sleep lake countered
come on kid buck up
he left her there and walked to the body that lay sprawled on the cheap whiteenameled bed
gimpy had looked like a weasel in life with his big buck teeth and now his mouth opened in death he looked more like a weasel than ever trained eye took in the details so he knew what had happened as well as if he had been here
somebody socked him on the jaw he said
see the bruise on his cheek bruise
he started for the telephone in the hall and he was shot with a silenced gun
right through the pump no it must have just missed the heart because theres blood on his lips
but he didnot live long
just long enough to take out that dollar bill
dollar bill said marge
yeah
i wonder why
he felt of the body
already getting cold
say an hour ago he was shot he said
and as he spoke these words his eyes widened in surprise
by the lord scrumptious he was killed within a minute or two after he called me at headquarters
somebody heard him or knew he was going to squeal
now hell never squeal
the realization sickened him
he never knew until now how much he had banked on information
he was up against a blank wall once more
moxie ardery marge called
he did it steve
he must have
you told me yourself gimpy used to play around with mob
lake nodded
the theory is logical darling but you have to prove it
he studied the bruise memorizing the purple pattern of it
then he searched the body and found nothing
he stood for a space bitterly disappointed
then he took the dollar bill and stared at it curiously
funny thing for a dead man to do he muttered be damned
what is it
marge cried breathlessly
lake pointed to the dollar bill
in the upper righthand corner and in the lower left was printed the bills serial but someone with an indelible pencil or ink had marked the letters and certain numbers
the letter was marked then the numbers two eight three one seven and finally the marge looked puzzled see it but what does it mean she asked looked at the corpse
gimpy you were a genius
what do you mean
suppose said lake softly you wanted to keep a telephone number and didnot want to carry around a paper that could be found
suppose marge cried it is a telephone number steve twoeightthreeoneseven
endicott on a hunch said lake a clue
marge was trembling with excitement
lake shrugged
he didnot get it out for a tip
he wrapped his hand in a handkerchief and telephoned centre street
after he got inspector lanahan and had told the facts of murder he said and inspector have them bring the infrared camera
that bruise is peculiar
hey what you doing there
you wait until lake hung up
wait until he pinches me for socking stone he muttered
come on scrumptious lets trace this telephone number
they called the superintendent who when he heard police business immediately dug into his files a private listing he told lake
robert hardell importer riverside drive
marge cried moxie ardery for a dime
maybe said lake
anyway you go into your office and write what you have and meet you at eight for dinner
then we go calling she laughed
then we go calling
at eight oclock however
lake was not waiting for marge
he was crossing the lobby of the apartment house at riverside drive be sore he knew but if this was what he expected it to be then no girl belonged
the nassau negro took him up to the ninth floor and pointed to a door
mr lives there but i donot know if hes in
lake rapped on the door
for a long time there was silence
then a voice said there
janitor said lake water leaking into the apartment below
there was a long silence the sound of whispering
then the door was unlocked opened about six inches
listen janitor said a voice fix it later canot you
my wifes lake put his number nine shoe in the opening his shoulder against the door and pushed
he went inside in a hurry as the resisting body surrendered to his strength
just a minute moxie he said this is a pinch and the charge is murder
the boy bandit was beautifulno other word described him
yellow curly hair bright blue eyes and a soft pink skin on a perfectly chiseled face
only his ear lobesor rather lack of lobesdistorted his face hinted at the mental twist that had made him a crook
that and the bitter cold inhuman blaze in his eyes as he stared at lake
lake thrust the door closed behind him and backed the youth into the living room
there was consternation hateeven fearin expression as he slowly retreated
once lake saw him glance swiftly at his wristwatch a diamond and platinum affair that belonged more properly on wrist
lake kept his hand in his right pocket the nose of his gun pressing hard against the cloth and making a lump
beyond moxie he saw a yellowhaired bit of painted fluff with wide saucerlike eyes
also a short stocky man whom lake had never seen before
drop your guns in the middle of the floor lake said and do it easy just holding this trigger with my thumb
moxie said you canot do this you punkheaded lug
you ainot a dick any out
you ainot got any right to come in here skip it cut in lake here
you killed gimpy martin a lie screamed the girl
he was with me and swear to it
yeah said lake
how did you know when the kill was done
her crimson mouth bit down
moxie said shut up mae every time you open that trap of yours you put your foot in it
lake waited until two guns and a blackjack lay in the middle of the floor
then he moved slowly toward the table where the telephone was
sit down he said while i call the homicide guys
moxie was purple
but i didnot bump gimpy he besides it was the short stocky man who changed the complexion of things
his hand flicked once and an inkstand flew through the air as straight as an arrow
lake had no time to duck
it smashed into the side of his head a glancing blow but sufficient to trip him make him lunge to catch his balance and blind his inkfilled eyes to the trio
the short stocky man was hustling in on a followup but moxie beat him to lake
moxie made one flying leap landed on back and hooked both hands around throat
get his gun george moxie cried
george did more than that
he hooked a punch to jaw then kicked the detective in the stomach
with weight on him lake went down
then they had his gun
he was brutally kicked toward the sofa
i that instant had moxie changed
his eyes grew to pinpoints and his mouth was lifted in a terrible smile
swell work george
i admit he had me going
never let a dumb cop get you going said george had that inkstand all set the minute i saw him come in
they searched lake but found nothing but his twodeck harmonica the one he had paid twentytwo dollars for
moxie laughed remember now youre the guy that plays the mouthorgan
lake went on wiping the ink off his face
the girl called mae laughed hysterically god i thought he was gonna bust up the big job we got shut up snapped moxie and george added geez get a twist into something and you start walkin on dynamite
moxie glanced at his wristwatch again
he reached for the telephone ask what we got to do with this flattie he said worried
a silence came over the room and lake sitting there listened intently as moxie dialed the number
the detective reached out and picked up his harmonica but he did not blow into it
he was counting the clicks as forefinger wheeled the dial and let it slide back
presently moxie said hello yeah
why we was all set to shove off for this job and this lug steve lake came in behind a rod yeah we grabbed him
do we throw him to the crabs
he listened intently
so did lake but while he could hear certain metallic sounds over the wire he could not hear a word spoken
moxie nodded as if he could see the speaker get it stuff
okay do it that way drop the stuff with you and then fix this punk dick
he hung up and turned to george
you stay here while me and mae do what we got to do
if this lug gives you any trouble bounce him one good
and how grinned george
permanent
moxie nodded slowly
permanent
lake blew softly into the harmonica and with his fingers cupped around it made pennies from heaven come out with surprising melody and skill
moxie thrust mae through the door
he drew on his gloves
permanent he repeated
mae was saying as the door closed never knew mouthorgan music was so pretty
now you take pete you take him growled moxie your husband
the door banged after them
lake played the last bar
does this bother you he asked blasted smoke from his nostrils took out the cigarette spat in the waste basket
go ahead it donot bother me none eyes moved reflectively around the room
he blew into the instrument and this time more loudly played the night and you
the music was quite loud
george lit a cigarette from the stub of the first and all the movement he made was his foot beating time to the music
his automatic pistol and the hand holding it lay idle in his lap
lake stopped for a time staring at the opened windows and french doors that led to a balcony
you really blow that thing george said
lake said yeah been practicing since i was a kid
he glanced at his wristwatch
a shade of frown passed over his forehead
he began to blow again a hot swing tune that had both of feet tapping had his shoulders swinging his head nodding appreciatively
george began to whistle through his teeth in accompaniment
the gun more relaxed was disturbed by his legs movements and slid over to one side
gun and hand both were ready to slide down toward the floor
george was completely relaxed
lake beating time with his feet got himself into position for a plan he hoped to carry out
swifter and swifter he worked up the time shoulders shaking sitting bolt upright
george said boy is that hot
and then as he was blowing out the last swift measures lake already taut came off the couch in one hurtling movement that was a flow of strength and desperation
the harmonica flew out and whacked george across the nose
he tried to raise his gun but it takes time to coordinate your muscles after youre all let down
and he didnot get the gun straightened out until lake was alongside
one powerful downward blow paralyzed arm and the gun belched redly to drive a slug into the floor
lake hooked george to the chin
he lifted him up socked him again
and george staggered back tripped and fell headlong to bang his head nastily against the side of the desk drawer
blood drooled from his scalp and he didnot move
lake got the gun tore up the portieres to make bonds and trussed george until he looked like a mummy
lake hurried to the door then went back for his harmonica and nodded
swell he muttered and went out in the hall
he almost knocked marge down
she had a policeman with her
for once marge had lost her poise
she leaped at lake and flung her arms around his neck
steve she gasped thought they had you
oh you were smart
it took imagination to play that har42 monica so i could locate the apartment
i heard it and knew they had you and got a cop
lake said huskily you mean you were going to crash in against those monkeys okay she said flustered except when you run off and leave me to pay for my own dinner did you get moxie
the mention of the boy bandit brought lake back to reality
he nodded to the cop a guy in there named george
he knows things
but you wonot be able to hose them out in time
you take him down got things to do
he glanced anxiously at his watch
come on marge he grabbed her hand
in the taxicab marge gasped my god wheres the fire up
lake said going to bust up this jewel gang got ideas she said
yes but he didnot tell her what they were
at times square he stopped long enough to call centre street
to the detective who replied he said new hotel robbery reported
he gave his name
yeah
a mrs ida whitehouse was robbed of eighty grand in pearls not twenty minutes ago but how the hell did you know
do you believe in fairies
lake said and hung up
back in the cab marge said to him where are we going
pishing said lake hope they all bite good
at city hall park he picked up the cop on the corner
get your gat ready lake said this may be tougher than you think
they covered the two blocks to office
something in expression brought the policeman silently at his heels
marge was panting with excitement as they went up the stairs
the same girl was putting more lipstick on the same lips when lake camf in
is the mental giant in there
steve asked
yeah but hes busy
no tipoff he growled waving his gun at her head
she let go the plug
he banged against the door and when it held drove his fist through the frosted glass and then reached inside and unlocked the door
asah stone was jumping up from behind the desk
moxie ardery had a gun out but the cop said now now and asah stone halfturning growled are you crazy
put up that gun his eyes blazing he strode to lake
now what the hell does this mean stupid
it means rejoiped lake calmly that youre under arrest for the murder of gimpy martin charged with being the big shot of a bandit syndicate picking out the people to be robbed and splitting the insurance dough that you get for recovering the jewels
it means rat that youre an accessory before and after the fact of the robbery of mrs dewarr and mrs ida whitehouse
and one buck will get you fifty that moxie got the pearls on him or theyre in your desk nuts laughed asah stone
me kill gimpy martin
why should i want to kill a punk like that
because he knew you were the guy that engineered the thefts said lake pleasantly
you got your records from the insurance company
they told you who had the most valjable jewels and how much insurance they carried as a precaution
you got guys like moxie to go out and knock off the catch and then split with them on the dough paid by the insurance company
well grinned asah stone if youre that crazy are you crazy enough to say you can prove it
sure nodded lake
all of a sudden he grabbed asah right hand
he wrenched off the ring the black onyx ring with the peculiar design
you hit gimpy with this and the ring left its impression
this new photographing by infrared rays picks up designs like that easy
it was your trademark
his face never revealed what a hunch what a guess that was
asah stone turned livid
then went on lake moxie telephoned you after he caught me in his apartment
called you about this whitehouse job
he dialed the number in a silent room stone and i counted the clicks
two two six six nine two one
check that on any telephone and its canal before stone could say a word lake went on and moxie you take a rap for murdering gimpy too
you were with stone and that makes you an accessory
gimpy put the finger on you by holding a dollar bill that had your telephone number on it
no no howled moxie suddenly
stoney knocked him off
on account of gimpy seen girl wearing that dewarr necklace before stoney sent it back
he did it
i didnot know he was going stone went for the man in a death struggle
but lake and the cop pulled them apart and held them screaming accusations and invectives
a phone call brought a prowl car and the homicide squad men
the next day lake went to the sphere office in response to summons reinstated she said
just got a call from centre street
better yet harkness says he intends to make you a secondgrade detective
how sweet of him said lake sourly
they make you a secondgrade dick today and tomorrow if you fumble they take it away
however he was thrilled though he didnot let marge see it
she said earnestly steve youre wonderful
i never knew you had that much imagination
figuring out that telephone call marking the print of that ring imagination the devil protested lake
those are facts
you just find them and you donot need any imagination
they tell their own story
she reached up gave him a hearty kiss
does that arouse your imagination she demanded
no said lake that tells me that on a detective pay we have an apartment on the west side and you learn to cook corned beef and cabbage at least once a week
next month a diamondstone novelette by flemingroberts be gnilty of scraping your face
star blades give you comfort for life
made since by the inventors of the safety razor
star blade div brooklyn tevin turns on a barrage of anticrime a complete novelette reaching hands a detective can sense trouble coming folks say
but i wasnot sensing anything when i started back to my office after dinner that night rounded the corner without a thought in my mindand then i saw it
a car was in front of my office building
a girl stood next to the car back to it facing the building entrance
her face was crazy with fear and her hands were tearing at her throat
no not at her throat
they were tearing at two hands reaching out from the sedan hands that strangled her saw veins knot on those murderous hands saw the girls face suffuse with blood
i pounded toward the car at top speed
if i could get my mitts on the he heard me coming got just a flash of blue serge sleeves above the strangling hands then the to whitewash black deeds a wily killer tactics against a game of greed girl was released and the car screamed into gear
i took one leap after it and stopped
the girl needed attention badly looked like shj was dead when she slumped to the walk with her face white and her throat bruised
but she opened her eyes when i bent over her
blue eyes
nice take you to a doctor i said picking her up all right she came back voice thick and burred fainted for a minute all
game kid
her throat was turning livid now
put me down please she said huskily
okay
how did that happen bade there
who was trying to kill you
the girl shook her head had my back to the car when the hands reached out
i didnot see who owned the hands
pleasei have to see a man named tevin in this building seeing him now i said
runs he gamut mass iurd private detective james tevin right i replied setting her down on her feet
come on up to the office and tell me about it
she sat in the visitors chair trembling but not hysterical and explained was nearly killed three days ago somebody tried to club me down late at night on the street
i thought see a private detective about it
you were recommended
i came here and your office was closed
i walked around the block then stopped at the entrance next to that parked car which i thought was empty
and out for me
if you were attacked three days ago i said how is it youre just getting around to asking for help
and why not the police instead of a private detective went to the police
the girl shrugged
they said i must have been attacked by a common thug who ran when i screamed
but i know better
the man didnot try to take my handbag
but the police took three days to come to their conclusion
after which i came here
i nodded
okay start the routine
name
harriet warner
circumstances private secretary to a paper wholesaler
an uncle and two cousins of mine live in the city but i live alone
she looked around my office pretty well furnished if i do say so myself afraid i canot afford you for very long
skip the walnut and bronze i said make the fee right an office worker not wealthy yet twice youre almost murdered
got any idea why
it might have something to do with the other reason why i wanted to see a private detective she said
what other reason
i snapped her up
another uncle of mine living in the colchester hills section died a few days ago his will is to be read tomorrow evening at his country place
after the attack the other night i thought i needed a detective not only to investigate but also to go with me to the place as a guard
well
i said will several heirs
maybe youre to be murdered for your share of your uncles fortune
harriet warner shook her head
uncle rudolph had money but not to get any of it
he told me a short time ago that all i was to get was his colchester hills home
the rest goes to my uncle ralph brother and my two cousins sons of dead sister
i shrugged
perhaps theres something of value hidden in this new home of yours donot think theres a buried treasure angle
harriet smiled see when you get there
it would be like trying to bury treasure in a city street solid rock around my uncles house
i an appointment to meet her next morning and drive her to colchester hills
i had things all docketed in my mind hear the will read discover that miss warner had inherited more than she had expected to and thus find a motive for one of the other heirs to murder her
with the motive in my possession i could soon nail the killer
all neatly docketed in my mind
and all just as wrong as hell
she was harriet and i was jim before we got to the colchester hills nett evening
an awful nice kid
the more i saw of her the more i liked her and the more i liked her the madder i got at the skunk who had tried to strangle her barehanded
we got to the place at eight
colchester hills is rich mans stuff
big estates
high meshedwire fences
picturesque cliffs and waterfalls
the dead rudolph place was modest though only an acre in extent
the house was small cape cod in style of whitewashed brick
whitewashed
and how
the stuff a was so spotless that it hurt your eyes to look at it
the grounds were solid humped stone with barely a skin of soil over it
harriet had been right about buried treasure
you couldnot have buried a dog biscuit here without dynamiting
three cars were in front of the cape cod cottage
two were nice jobs
the third could have been six years younger without hurting anything the lawyers car said harriet of the latter
uncle rudolph didnot have a city lawyer
he did business with a man named cook from the near village of boynton
your uncle lived here alone asked
alone except for strine said harriet
strine was with uncle rudolph for years
his servant
he cooked cared for the house and grounds everything be broken up about uncle death
did mr packer commute to a city office
no
he was retired
he played the market now and then thats all
played it shrewdly i guess door of the house opened
an old man with a leather face under white hair looked at us
good evening strine harriet said and smiled
the old man bobbed his head
this isa friend strine
mr tevin george strine
the old boy bobbed his head again wordlessly
harriet and i stepped through the door and into the living room
a drylooking elderly man with sideburns came up got something to tell you i heard old strine say to him in a whisper
the elderly man only said later please and looked at us
harriet introduced him as the lawyer bruce cook
the others are all here cook said out in back get them
harriet and i settled ourselves in the living room and in a minute the rest straggled in her uncle ralph a middleaged man with closeset dark eyes her cousin arthur fitch a blond young fellow with a mouth like a gash in his face her other cousin corey fitch a taciturn man of thirty who stared at me with hostile eyes
i didnot like relatives
it didnot make me like em any more to have arthur fitch say why is mr tevin here
he has no connection with the family
a reading of a will is certainly a private thing
is there any clause in the will forbidding me to bring a friend demanded harriet spunkily
cook looked over the top of his reading glasses fussy but not unkindly
as far as the will is concerned you may bring any one you please miss warner
with that settled cook droned over the contents of the will guess had been right
she got the house and grounds and all therein contained
the dead mans brother and nephews shared about fortyeight thousand dollars in cash
such was the essence of it
cook started packing papers in his briefcase
corey fitch and ralph packer walked to the french windows ignoring harriet and me
arthur fitch went toward the back of the house
a later his horrified shout came to us
my god
strine
i ran through the rear door of the living room through the dining room with the rest at my heels
arthur fitch wasnot shouting any more but i could hear his heavy breathing like sobbing and i ran for that
i found myself in the kitchen
fitch stood beside a table staring down at something
something of which i could see only two legs sprawled in grotesque angles on the floor
i jumped to the table and looked down ata corpse
it was strine
he lay on his face in a red pool
from his back stuck the wooden handle of a butcher knife
the blade had pierced heart never known what hit him
i turned to keep harriet back but she had already seen
her face was the color of death
she looked at me with horror in her eyes then stared at the dead man again
they did to they tried to doto me she whispered through white lips
i put my arm around her shoulders and helped her back to the living room
then i called the boynton sheriff thinking of one thing
the old servants urgent whisper to lawyer cook got something i must tell you had strine been killed to prevent his speaking to cook
but what could he have had to say that led to murder
he hadnot been given anything in the will but a home in this house for the rest of his life
nothing there to kill him for
the sheriff came from boynton
his name was schule and he had a belly and chinablue eyes that stuck out
i didnot think much of him
if i didnot like schule i cared even less for relatives in the red light of murder
ralph packer was greyfaced with fear and his closeset dark eyes darted everywhere at once
corey dark face was bloodcongested and his eyes glittered in a feverish way
arthur fitch wandered around with his hands in his pockets and his slitlike mouth as hard as granite
a sadists mouth
how the hell had a girl like harriet emerged from his brood
schule started with me first alone in the living room
did you hear the old man yell or anything when he was killed in the kitchen
no i said
he wouldnot have been able to yell
he was struck from behind and the blow killed him instantly
when i want opinions ask for em snapped schule
you just answer questions
were you in the kitchen between the time you got here and the time strine was found dead
i shook my head
got proof of that
miss warner can tell you
i was in the living room with her from the minute i set foot in the house your only proof
schule looked as triumphant as though hed discovered something
was strine killed before you gathered in here do you think
or afterward
you told me you didnot want opinions i reminded him a duly authorized officer of the law be blustered getting purple
you answer my questions
okay
you want me to say whether strine was killed by the man who found his body arthur fitch or not donot know
but i think strine was killed before the will was read while everybody was out in back except miss warner and myself
the blood had begun to coagulate a little when i got to him
yeah but which could have done it muttered schule for a minute not pompous
the two fitch brothers old cook ralph packer he jerked himself up
but donot think lettin you and miss warner out just because shes pretty and youre a private detective
tell miss warner to come in here bad luck to paste a sheriff on the jaw so i just went out
the rest were in the dining room
somehow my flesh crawled when i saw them silent and whitefaced sitting around the dining room table like so many ghosts
i looked at harriet who sat a little apart next to old cook
someone in this room it was almost certain had tried twice to kill her
the same person with almost equal certainty had murdered strine
but why
i motioned silently for her to go in to the sheriff
a hidden treasure the sheriff was grilling the rest i moved around
i had swung back to my first belief
something valuable was hidden around this place that made bequest the richest of the lot
something known only to the killer who had tried to murder harriet to get it and had succeeded in murdering strine to keep him from giving lawyer cook a hint of it
that was the only theory that fitted in with the attacks on the girl the killing of the servant and urgent whisper there is something i must tell you
something of value hidden here mentioned in the will only to the extent that harriet got the house and grounds and all therein contained
i set out to track it down
the grounds as has been said were out
you canot bury thingsbonds jewelry what notin solid rock
that left the house and garage
the garage was ruled out soon walls were solid concrete
its floors of cement could not have been disturbed without leaving a trace anyway under them was the inevitable rock
its ceiling was rafters with shingles laid directly on them and certainly no valuable article would be hidden in a can of oil or a box of tools or the dead mans sedan
that left only the house which seemed doubtful to me
the walls were out
i had noticed that the partition walls were of paperthin modern construction
no room in them for anything in the first place in the second any disturbance of them would have meant calling in outside labor to replaster or repaper which might have given the hiding place away
the outer walls were of brick two bricks thick
solid
you couldnot hide anything there either i decided
attic was too obvious
rudolph packer in building the place had gone in for antiquity
ceilings were beamed with bare wood of the floor above showing between the beams
no space there to store things secretly
and there was no basement the house rested on solid rock
that left the furniture considering which was slightly a melodramatic idea or the trick of hiding something right under your eyes
i walked toward the house white as snow in the moonlight with its immaculate coat of whitewash saw harriet coming out of the side door
she looked around and i waved
she came toward me couldnot stay in there any more she said in a low voice afraid
i nodded
that was certainly understandable in view of the probability that a murderer was under that roof
of course the rest were safe now with the sheriff right in the house but nevertheless harriet couldnot be blamed for wanting to get away
we walked slowly around the house toward the front driveway
i kept looking around
if there had been any lawn ornaments i would have investigated them
but there were none never seen a place so bare of possibilities for hiding things
harriet would have to pull the furniture apart i thought if this idea of hidden valuables persisted enough to make the effort worth while
i had to admit that i was losing my own conviction again
how long will we be here
jim she asked me wistfully donot know i said
you should be able to leave pretty soon now
me too i think
the others well it depends on the sheriffs ideas
and i added but only to mysdf if it was me hold the two fitches and your uncle and give them plenty grilling
we stood looking at the road fifty yards or so from the drive
cars hummed past
now and then a local driver recognizing the sheriffs car at the door would pause a little
but for the most part they sped past serenely unaware that a murdered man lay in the snowwhite cape cod cottage
it gave me a kind of funny feeling
harriet gripped my arms suddenly
what was that
i hadnot heard anything sound from behind us she insisted
around the side of the house
we walked back to the corner of the house and around
and the moment we rounded the corner we saw the long dark blotch on the ground next to the white wall
and harriet screamed while i grabbed her elbows and turned her around
into the house
get the sheriff
i went to the long blotchand looked down into the dead face of arthur fitch
a face that was untouched though the bony structure of the head behind it was a shattered mass
a mechanics heavy hammer reddened and gleaming in the moonlight lay near the pulped head rest safe now with the sheriff in the house
i echoed my thought of a moment ago with a cold chill touching my bones bumped up against a lot of violence in my life
but never seen anything to match the ruthlessness the icy recklessness of this killer now among us
i ran on blind impulse to the nearest door and into the house after harriet
i didnot want her out of my sight
not any more
two men dead within a space of an hour and a half
one of them murdered while a law officer was conducting an investigation under the same roof
but the sheriff wasnot having any of my guardianship over the girl
with two deputies hastily called from the village to watch the dining room in which every one sat he beckoned me out to the second dead man
i went leaving corey fitch looking numbed by the shock of his brothers death lawyer cook badly unstrung and fussing with one of the deputies who refused stolidly to let him get into his briefcase and ralph packer a palsied mass of fear
i have never seen a man so frightened as packer
but it was not the double fear youd expect
the fact that he was logically a murder suspect didnot seem to occur to him
it was fear of death from the as yet undetected murderer that seemed to hold him most abjectly
looking around outside with schule i catalogued the findings
it was pretty easy because they were so few
arthur fitch had been killed from behind with the hammer taken from a tool box in the garage
a man could have done it all in three minutes by running from house to garage getting the weapon and running back to where fitch stood smoking in the moonlight and returning swiftly to the house again
harriet and i had been in front so we were out of the way
why had fitch been outside
well a half smoked cigarette put out by the damp grass near him told that
he had been out taking a cigarette getting relief from the tenseness inside the house
and the killer had seen him and seized the chance to get rid of him
why
well why had strine been killed and harriet attacked
it all seemed to make increasingly less sense as it got more complicated
schule had shed his pomposity by now
this second killing done while hed been within ten yards was going to look like the devil for him
he flashed his light feverishly and pointlessly around was talking to mr packer he said over and over again said to him to get arthur fitch in again
i told him to hunt fitch up because it seemed to me before that fitch had something he wanted to say and that he wasnot quite sure enough a about it to put it into words
something on his mind
so i wanted to talk to him again
and then the girl comes running in saying theres a dead man out on the lawn and its this guy fitch
damn it sure he had something to say only before he wasnot positive enough
you wouldnot talk against a brother or uncle for instance unless you knew what you were talking about
you sent ralph packer after him
i repeated
yeah
and uncles have killed nephews before
i think arrest packer
he looked pathetically relieved
yeah thats the stuff
it must have been packer
he went after fitch on my orders found him alone and killed him
why
eh said why
what reason would he have for murdering his sisters son
how would i know
but thats what must have happened
where was corey fitch
schule gnawed his lip again donot know
he wasnot in the dining room
mr cook can testify to that
so both the uncle and the brother of this guy were on the loose
either one might have done it
or cook or miss warner or me i said
his eyes came back to mine with plenty of suspicion in them not forgettin you and the girl were out on the lawn
keep on remembering it and see what it gets you i told him have a lot of reasons for killing guys i never even saw before
miss warner would have a reason
she splits this guys share of money now
i bit my tongue over that one
it was so evidentand so unexpected
harriet had a motive for murder in the eyes of the law
i answered a possible law court as well as schule when i said nuts
i was with her when both men died
i saw her being attacked herself
if you donot want to take my word for it just remember how much strength it takes to stick a knife into meat
miss warner wouldnot have the strength to drive a dull kitchen knife into a mans heart from behind
you would said schule
and on that friendly note we went in to the house again and schule again began chasing in circles to get his man
meanwhile i stuck close and tried to nail the killer on my own hook
but i got no farther than schule did
ralph packer sweating so that perspiration stains showed clear through his blue serge suit said he had been in the bedroom still searching for arthur fitch till just before fitch was killed
corey fitch claimed he had been in the bathroom
cook had been in the dining room
amazingly when you remember a sheriffs presence right in the house any one of them could have made murderous opportunity out of the fact that arthur fitch had nervously decided to smoke a cigarette in the moonlight grilled us all again one by one
he asked some good questions at that i noted with professional interest
but he didnot get anywhere so he started a second time
we were again in the dining room cook and packer and corey fitch and harriet and voice came to us from the living room
mr cook
cook got up moistening his lips averting his eyes from the door leading into the kitchen
there were two dead men lying in the kitchen now
one of the deputies opened the dining room door for the lawyer and he walked through the tiny hall into the living room
and then just before the deputy had the door closed again i saw cook stop next to the outside living room door and stare into the night
his mouth went slack
his hands went up to pluck at his trembling lips
and he yelled hoarsely
it was a high brittle cry almosl like a womans scream
he pointec through the screened doorway
sheriff
out there
oh my god
the deputy wasnot interested in closing the dining room door any more
he threw it wide open and leaped toward cook
schule got there first
his hand gripped shoulder
what is it
what do you see out there
cook fought for words
when they did come they were like icy whips figureout therein the moonlight
i saw it
it looked like strine
in the dark gasp was like a sob
a sort of moan came from ralph lips
then i was out of the dining room on the heels of the other deputy and corey fitch
they started for the grounds
i didnot
i went for the kitchen where strine lay
i got the door open had one glimpse of two sprawled bodies on the floor and then the lights went out
all of them
every light in the place
i heard fearpacked scream sound out again from the front of the house
and an instant after that a sound that drew a hoarse shout in echo from my own lips
harriet shriek which died in horrible fashion into a choking moan which was succeeded by complete silence
i lunged from the kitchen hitting the partly opened door in the pitch darkness
i got to the dining room door and it was locked against me
through it i could hear a terrible scraping of high heels on hardwood floor
the sound drove me crazy for a minute
i banged my shoulder against the door backed off tried jt again
running steps sounded outside and the kitchen door to the back yard burst open
i saw four dark shapes outlined against the moonlight heard voice
my god happened now
strine a voice i thought was corey cut the sheriffs words off here where he was before
anyway theres two bodies
these things i heard with half my mind
the rest was in that locked dining room with the girl whose heels were rasping so desperately and convulsively on the floor
i caught up a kitchen chair and smashed it to kindling against the door
and the door only quivered a little
i turned thrusting a couple of shadowy figures out of my way ran out the back door and around to the dining room window
i smashed the glass and climbed in
as the glass crashed i thought i heard a sound across the room from the window but wasnot sure
in the rooms dimness i saw harriet lying near the table
i jumped to her side bent down
i couldnot feel a pulse
her face was ghastly in its pallor
even in the dim light i could see how her throat was swelled and discolored
i got her hands saying something or other to her all the time
things i hadnot a right to say so soon
but they came out anyway
i began working her arms back and forth in artificial respiration
i heard somebody yell in the living room and then after quite a little while the lights went on
all of which meant little to me
the important fact was that harriet was beginning to breathe again and in a little while she opened her eyes
jim she whispered talk i said chafing her wrists and making her head as comfortable as possible on my knee
lights went out somebody grabbed me
almost got methis i kept on chafing her wrists
almost got her
hell she had been a actually and literally dead
only artificial breathing had snapped her out of it again
i carried her to the bedroom not leaving you again if the house burns down around our ears
i told her grimly
she smiled at me and rubbed her throat
yes you are she said words coming painfully lock this window so no one can get in without breaking the glass and lock the door
and sit up in bed out of line of the window with your gun in my hands got to help the sheriff get this killer jim
well she was right though i hated to agree with her
and finally i went out hearing the key scrape in the lock as she closed the door after me
i went to the kitchen first
old strine lay on the floor as he had before
there was the knife handle protruding from his back with the slowly coagulating blood all around it
dead as yesterdays mackerel
the knife handle sticking up proved that
i went to the living room
why the hell had cook said hed seen strine in the moonlight when that was utterly impossible
in the living room i got the next shock out of a night of crazy surprises
old cook lay on a divan with schule and a deputy and corey fitch all bending over him
the lawyers forehead was laid open and blood ran down his cheek smearing in his sparse sideburns
we found him in the living room doorway like this schule said to me
the sheriff was completely lost now
what happened
i asked cook donot know
his voice trembled sawthat horrible figure in the moonlight
then the others ran past me out the door onto the grounds
i didnot see it any more but i heard a step behind me
and then something hit me on the head and i was through the lights go out
i asked schule he had an answer for that if he didnot for anything else
he held up a pin
it was discolored and some of the point had melted off
it had been thrust into an electric cable causing a short circuit
we found this in the dining room schule said
i blinked at that
in the dining room
i remembered the procession that had crowded out after yell
the two deputies corey fitch and myself
leaving two people in the dining room
harriet and ralph packer was in the living room with the rest of us
he sat in a chair not far from the divan
i stared at him suddenly and caught his closeset eyes just sliding from my face
sweat stood out on his forehead minute ago i said slowly all of us ran out of the dining room except you and miss warner
shortly afterward somebody came within a hair of killing her
packer said nothing
his heavy breathing sounded out
you must have been in there when she was attacked i said
no
no
his voice was thick wasnot
it looks bad for me but i wasnot
i went out just after the rest of you did leaving harriet aldne
my own niecesurely you donot think you could have come back in again i said after youd blown the light fuse with that pin didnot
i was in the living room
then i snapped him up you must have seen the attack on mr cook
packer shivered
he wiped at his forehead but new drops of perspiration came out at once couldnot see a thingexcept cook
i saw him standing there in the doorway and then i heard him scream and saw him fall
it was as if he had been struck by something invisible
by a ghost
you couldnot have been the one that hit him by any chance
i said swear i didnot
schule joined in
you were the one i sent to find arthur fitch just before he was killed
you were out in back at about the time strine was killed
you could have knocked mr cook out after youd blown the lights and then could have gone back into the dining room after miss warner
no
no
i turned from packer to the old lawyer lying on the divan
what in the world made you think you saw a dead out on the lawn
he shook his head weakly donot know
maybe been thinking of strine
when i saw a moving figure out there i may have fitted face to it because he was in my mind
and yet i donot think thats the explanation
i saw the face so clearly
i even seemed to see aa knife handle sticking out of the mans back
it couldnot have been me he saw packer cut in swiftly was in the dining room with you at that minute
you know that yourself wiped his forehead which was almost as moist as maybe strine wasnot dead after all he muttered
we didnot feel for his pulse to find out
we took it for granted he was dead because of the knife
he might have had strength enough left to regain consciousness crawl out to hie lawnand then get back to the kitchen again
leaving no blood spots in his trail and not trying to call out for help i snapped
no thats out impossible
all right mr cook didnot see strine
i guess that is kinda impossible
but he did see somebody
that means an outsider did all this
somebody hiding on the grounds killed strine and arthur fitch
and theyre probably miles away now
but cook objected
he shook his head winced at the pain the move caused donot think so sheriff he said
there was something familiar about the figure agree that the notion that it was strine i saw is insane
but there was still something familiar about it in my opinion
though thats only an opinion
schule sighed
only one thing to be done have to take everybody in till morning
the coroner might have some light to throw then he stopped abruptly
corey fitch he snapped
we all looked around
there were the two deputies schule packer cook and myself in the room
he was here a second ago said one of the deputies
he was sitting near the door he get out with no one seeing him snapped schule
that question answered itself
we had all been hanging on the words first of packer and then of cook
by moving softly corey fitch could have got from chair to door unnoticed
the question in my mind was why had he moved so stealthily
and on the heels of that question came a lightning burst of fear
fear for harriet
i jumped to my feet and tore from the room
the room in which harriet lay was at the end of the short hall
i pounded on the door almost yelled with relief when i heard her voice come in alarm who is it
mejim i said wanted to be sure you were all right
i heard voice then
you fitch
what the hell are you doing out here
the voice came from the kitchen
i went there
corey fitch whitefaced was staring at schule and the deputies
he was standing beside body and there was a little blood on his hands
what are you doing here
fitch stared at schule and then at me
with all the talk about seeing strine i came out to see if he was really dead
i had a crazy notion that maybe he was just pretending a to be dead with a fake knife handle glued to his back and blood from a butcher shop or something spilled on the floor to make it look convincing snort was an indictment
yeah a swell explanation the truth
mr cook seemed so positive he saw strine why did you sneak out here without saying anything
the idea was sort of crazy fitch said stubbornly thought youd laugh at me if i suggested it
so i slipped out by myself to make sure he was dead you get that blood on your hands took hold of the knife handle to see if it was really attached to a knife blade face got paler yet
it is
strine is dead all right
you took hold of the knife handle
schule grated
what a swell excuse for finding your prints on that handle
you didnot have time to wipe em off the handle after you killed strine so you tried an alibi
damn you fitch began
and then the last act of the swift drama hit us as we confronted fitch in the kitchen
oh my god came a shout from the living room
packer
help
dead men dance to get through an all too narrow doorway once more that night we ran from a room on each others heels
we got to the living room
i was first with schule close enough behind to see over my shoulder as we reached the living room doorway
cook and packer were swaying in a deadly struggle in the center of the room
a chair was knocked over nearby
the chair packer had been sitting in when we left
cook had his arms desperately around body
the arms were striving to pinion arms to his sides while with his right hand cook held the wrist of the heavier man in a tense grip
the briefest possible glimpse we had of the two swaying figures
then as we crossed the threshold the two men fell
they fell with packer on his back and cook on top arm continued to be bent at a grotesque angle behind him
and he did not move
cook crawled off looking white and sick
there was blood on his right hand which he drew from under body
my god he whispered
he turned the body over a little
we saw the handle of a paper knife sticking out of back
cook moaned killed him
the lawyer picked at loose lips with trembling fingers
he cowered back from us didnot mean to do it
he came at me with a knife
i twisted his arm behind him
he was getting the best of me when i tripped him
he fell on the knife he held in his own hand
it wasnot me
schule touched his shoulder all right he said gruffly got plenty of witnesses that it was self defense and that you didnot have the knife in your hand
it was self defense
yes babbled cook
self defense
an accident
you saw i said nothing
i looked at bruce left coat sleeve
on the sleeve there was a faint smear of white
and the white smear was telling me all i had wanted to know
piece by piece the whole thing was fitting into shape now
schule glared down at ralph packer
got no more than he deserved
killed two people damned lucky he didnot get you too mr cook
anyhow the case is washed up
the murderers dead whichll save the state the cost of putting him in the chair
no i said looking at the streak on sleeve
whitewash it was
the murderer isnot dead standing here now jittering around about self defense are you talking about panted cook apparently recovering strength slowly from the battle for his life screwy snapped sehule
we all saw how packer was trying to stab cook
yeah
i said
for how long
for about a fifth of a second
then cook tripped packer and packer fell back on his own knife
obliging guy packer
cook was staring at me with astonishment and a sort of patient injury in his eyes donot quite understand mr tevin he said was attacked by the man as though he had suddenly gone mad
i managed to beat him off and we fell and he was killed by the very weapon he had meant to use on me
interesting i said
but that doesnot explain the streak of whitewash on your sleeve at his sleeve with nothing but bewilderment in his face
then stared questioningly at me again
it was damned well done
you were outside this room while the rest of us were in the kitchen i charged him
you brushed against one of these freshly whitewashed walls outside
your attitude is insulting and unwarranted sir
i may have had this streak of white on my sleeve since i first arrived here
you may have i cut him off but you didnot
it wasnot on there five minutes ago which means you went out within the last few minutes
was it before you killed packer or afterward
but my dear sir you saw packer few seconds ago we saw you dancing around with him
but we didnot see packer killed i shot out thought there was something funny about the way his knees were buckling
packer teas dead before he fell have had to kill him before you went out of the house or hed have asked questions or raised an outcry
you put on an act with a dead man cook
cook turned to sehule
sheriff is this man authorized to attack me in this absurd way
no he ainot sehule growled
he switched his eyes to me
back out of this
shut up i told him
i returned to cook
there is something of value hidden around this property now belonging to harriet warner
as rudolph lawyer you knew of it
you tried to kill miss warner so the house would be untenanted and you could steal it
she was lucky enough to escape your first attack down in the city
i stopped the second
we all came up here tonight
the first thing you were greeted with was an indication that old strine knew the secret too though he didnot know you were in on it
you killed strine to shut him up
arthur fitch you discovered saw something to make him a little suspicious
probably he saw you either enter or leave the kitchen just before the will was read
sheriff sehule was going to question him a second time because the first time arthur fitch had acted as if he had something on his mind
you spiked that by racing to the garage when you saw him walk out onto the lawn and getting a hammer with which you later killed him
cook was shaking his head almost pityingly
and the pin that caused the short circuit he murmured
that was found in the dining room
at the time it was dropping i was lying in here unconscious what you say
actually you werenot at all
you caused the short while you stood in the living room after the rest had run past you and out the door
packer came out then and you put on an act for him pretended to be attacked and droppedafter carefully gashing your own head
packer couldnot see you at the floor level in the dark a and didnot see you crawl to the dark dining room lock it from the inside and then attack miss warner once more after dropping the fused pin as a plant was staring a little more uncertainly now and a little less angrily at me
you made up the silly yarn about seeing strine in the yard to distract our attention so you could have one more chance to kill the inheritor of this house i told the lawyer
at the moment it seemed like a good idea
later you began to realize that it might draw suspicion to you
so you planned a goat
you killed packer while his back was turned
you ran out into the night ran back in again and put on the cockeyed act we caught a glimpse of as we ran here in answer to your yell
and why would i go outside the house at such a tense moment demanded cook with a sneer
because of the thing of value hidden here which has been youi motive from the first i shot back
obviously this thing is somehow a part of the outside house wall which explains the immaculate whitewash put on carefully to cover the object
now it seems to me your anxiety to rush things which led you to the terrific risk of doing murder while a law officer was right in the house can only mean that this valuable thing is in danger of becoming visible
maybe the whitewash is coming off from over it
i donot know
yes thats probably it
and you ran out after killing packer to try to cover it up so you could have at least a few days more in which to get miss warner out of the way and steal it
cook sighed should be very angry young man
but not because fortunately you canot harass me with your insane theories
you all saw me fighting for my life with a man who attacked me for no reason the man who is the real murderer
schule at least will testify to that extent
so i think you are to be disregarded mr tevin
schule looked at the lawyer and then at me
got any way to prove what youre spouting about he challenged me
i grinned a little at that been angling for the question
the whole case i said rests on the fact that theres something around this place which miss warner has inherited that is worth a lot of money and that cook alone knows of it and has killed to get it
right
yeah or youre crazy schule grunted
okay
now if we can go outside find the part of the wall where cook picked up that smear of whitewash and discover something of value there it would hang him wouldnot it an idea said schule striding for the door
wait
cook cracked out
schule and i turned
he had looked contemptuous before
now he looked damned mad
his eyes were hard glitters in his face
the veins in his forehead stood out demand my rights sheriff
it may be remotely possible that thi man has chanced to guess an amazing truth that there is something valuable concealed here
but if that is so it would prove not one thing
the hell it wouldnot said schule
come on tevin
we got to the door
cook came after us
he moved fast for a man who had been hit in the head a little while before tell you sheriff schule ignored him
we moved down the wall
to the left to the right
cook came with us talking clutching first at arm and then at mine
long before we came to the end of the search schule had glanced meaningly at the two deputies who closed in behind the lawyer
and to the right near the corner of the house we saw a discoloration in the gleaming whitewash
it was a little patch of dried mud no larger than a silver dollar i reached to scratch at the mud
and cook cracked
a scream like that of an animal came from his lips
he lunged toward the two deputies then stopped
i saw his face congest with the dreadful apoplexy of a stroke and he that night we got back to the mud patch
we scraped it away and some of the whitewash around it
the cape cod cottage was constructed of brick
but right here was a slab of gold as thick as a brick and ten bricks in area
when the gold moratorium had gone into effect rudolph packer had secretly bought some and cast it into this ponderous slab
he had put it there in the wall which every one passing could see but had ruled bricklines in it and had washed it over with whitewash with which he kept the cottage meticulously covered from then on
the only man besides strine to know of it was cook who had been instructed to inform harriet of its presence when in future years it was once more legal to own gold
cook had planned to kill harriet so he could loot the gold from an uninhabited house
the sheer weight of the slab made it impossible for him to cart it off alone during a normal short absence of hers or of when he had come in that night he had been horrified to see that a bit of whitewash had flaked off the glittering slab
and at the end of his murder spree he had rushed out to rub a skim of mud over the metal getting the whitewash that damned him on his sleeve
harriet wanted to give me a tenth of the slab for my fee
nothing doing i said
why should i take a tenth when got a shot at the whole thing
you think you have a chance at it she murmured
why not
i said pretty well fixed now
you need a detective in the family to watch over your interests and keep you from being lonely out in this nice cottage
she looked at me for a full minute
swell eyes
it would serve you right if i took you seriously she said at last
we were under the moon
i took her hand
go on i said a little thickly serve me right
i guess my voice told her how far i was from kidding did
next month a new story by ray cummings and many other crime thrillers his rifle spoke again and ripped off a splinter from the cross arm davis once a ball player makes a headline play when a drug combine tries a home run by author of border patrol murder gain etc girl had been crying
there were no streaks on her face for she had done a good job with her powderpuff
but her eyes were red they were good eyes toowide and frank and deep blue
her ankles were slim and thats a criterion with me
faces run pretty much alike nowadays what with facials and mudpacks and electric vibrators but i never saw ankles like hers on anything but thoroughbreds
speck chandler talked to her his homely freckled face as kindly as the face of a bulldog can be
she was pulling at the fingertips of her gloves but she looked straight at us
it was up in our office in the federal building which has on the frosted glass of the door narcotic squad agent in charge david chandler my name is julia proctor the girl said live in fenway a hun59 dred miles south of here about my brothermy kid brother just seventeen working in fenway to send him to high school orphans
jimmy has been a brilliant student
worked too hard i think
then he got to where hed come home in a hilarious mood laugh and singand say that the most ordinary thingslike electric lightswere the most beautiful things in the world
and then it would only be a little while before hed be sunk in the depths of despairactually groveling in despondency
she shuddered
his grades fell off at school
he looked haggard and kept wanting more money
it frightened me
i caught him smoking cigarettesa brand never heard of
so i watched him one day when school turned out
there was a swarthy man parked in a coupe about a block from school
several boys went to his car he slipped them something and they gave him money
the girls honest gaze was direct donot want jimmy to get into any trouble
i want to break up this awful thing whatever it is
i took this out of clothes handed speck a crumpled pack with a few cigarettes in it
it was labeled smokeys
speck broke open one of the fags riffled its contents in his palm sniffed it then handed the whole business to me
he took the girls arm steered her to the door
will you wait in the lobby miss proctor he said
i left the office by a rear door
we have enough of a lab back there to lift and read fingerprints and enough of a file to check against the main ones
it all didnot take over three or four minutes
a steely glint was in eyes when i returned to the office
heavenly weed i cracked
with its roots in hell speck finished
and neither of us smiled when we said it
marijuana is no smiling matter
four sets of prints on the pack i said
probably the girls yours and the kid brothers
the other set is honey that means nick dariant speck said
honey has always been a dariant manpeddling everywhere but working specially among high school kidsbuilding up hellish business for the future face was more like a bulldogs right then than ever
the image of nick dariant was in my mind
nick dariant the man we wanted the number one man on the divisions list
a man with the figure of a marathon runner the classic face of a screen loverand a soul as black as the pit of hell
he had taken a powder in chicago when narcotic agents had closed in on his gang and hideout
he had done the same in saint louis
ditto los angeles
a most slippery customer mr dariant
in those other places it had been hasheesh and bhang
down here it was marijuana probably the most insidious and hellish of them all
wherever he operated nick dariant had cleaned up a wad and left a few thousand wrecked lives behind him had other evidence that dariant was at work in our vicinity
here in the city we had picked up and convicted half a dozen addicts and small time peddlers we knew were dariant menor women
we had nailed down the town pretty tight
that was why dariant men were working in the smaller places like fenway
but we hadnot been able to learn where dariant was or how he was getting the stuff
we knew that he wasnot fooling around with windowboxes and backyard gardens
he never operated on a twobit scale
this is the best lead weve had dinkey davis speck said
they call me dinkey maybe because sort of short and squat which had come in handy because before i came into the division i was a flashy shortstop on a class baseball team with an exmarine sergeant for a captain
he gave me the nameand it had stuck ever since told miss proctor an agent would go to fenway with her speck went on
we may learn something from her brother
and besides the girl may need protection hoods might be watching her
dariant always works a big crew and hes still got some of his old gang left a mean bunch of rats
protection for ladies i said right up my alley
maybe i was thinking about the girls ankles
i put on my hat and began to look around to see what want to take with me
speck put a hand like a bunch of bananas in my face and pushed me back into my chair
no sentiment in this business he growled saw you looking at that girl going
i griped but it didnot do any good
that business means what it says
phone fanny for me speck said whenhe left with the girl a little later
tell her be back on the train tonight about seven
if i donot make it phone you
one of the first rules of an agent is to keep in contact with his headquarters to keep from getting out on a limb and then finding it sawed off behind you
speck didnot come in that night and he didnot phone
fanny called me the next morning and said that speck hadnot come in during the night
of course she was scared but fanny is game and didnot show it except for a little choke in her voice
that day wasnot much fun for me
fanny would phone about every two hours the choke in her voice getting a little more noticeable each time
and no word came from speck
i put in a call for him at fenway and couldnot get him
then i put in a call for julia proctor and i couldnot get her either surely be in tonight fanny said bravely the last time she called having whitefish for dinner tonightbroiled the way dave is crazy about
come on out and eat with us
we ate the whitefish and i and the two kids
speck didnot show up and afraid we didnot enjoy the dinner good as it was
i sat around faking cheerfulness for a couple of hours with the kids crawling over me and calling me uncle dinkey
the boy is four and looks so much like speck its spooky the girl six looks like fanny which is plenty goodlooking
it made my stomach go cold those kids talking about their daddy and asking when he was coming home and fanny going kind of white every time name was mentioned
when i left she went to the door with me
she kind of reached out caught both my arms tight and began to cry
i let her use my shoulder crazy about fanny swell people
i told her to keep her chin upthen i got out of there
i had to or have been blubbering too
i got in my car and headed south is a nice little town with a chamber of commerce and all the trimmings
at one oclock in the morning it was a blot of darkness with the exception of two blocks of street lights and the lights in front of the new courthouse
i got the directions to julia house from a bent and toothless old night watchman
it was a pocketsize cottage with vines around it
it seemed to fit her all rightand verify my judgment on her ankles
it was dark of course
i walked around the cottage
and i didnot go clanking
i couldnot spot anything queer
finally i went up and tried the front door
it was locked
i rang the bell thinking it kind of foolish
i had a funny feeling down under my breastbone
maybe i was sticking my neck out
i was
the lock clicked the door came open with a jerk and the lights snapped on
i had yanked out my service gun but the man who opened the door had jumped to one side
the door slammed behind me and its spring lock clicked
take it easy copper honey savoni said
we was kinda expectin you
all i could see of honey was one eye half of a crooked nose and half of his grinning gash of mouth
the rest of him was behind the casement of the doorway down the hall
but i saw what honey had
it was a tommygun and it was pointed just about where i had recently experienced my funny feeling
we found out a long time ago honey cracked that federal dicks run in pairslike other snakes
all right take him sailor where honey made his mistake
when theyre going to take me they ought not to let me know about it
i learned in class baseball how all at the same time to dodge popbottles from the visiting fans fight the umps with one hand and members of the visiting team with the other often used that technique
this time i dodged
the sap that sailor pringle swung down at me would have knocked me cold as a foot
it didnot even do my shoulder any good when i jerked my head aside
sailor was the punk who had opened the door
he used to be a thirdrate pug before he got the killers itch momentum of his blow threw sailor onto my back i let my gun slip whipped my hands over the back of his neck locked my fingers hunched low and heaved up like a bucking burro
honey didnot use the tommygun to open up my hide for two reasonsone was in our tangle sailor pringle was as likely to become a bloody corpse as me the other was they didnot want a fouralarm bedlam in this quiet burg
my heave did the work for sailor
with a cry like a frightened guineahen he went over my back and slammed down in front of me
i didnot let him go to the floor
i grabbed a new hold and held him up in front of me his back to honey and the artillery
fire when ready honey i yammered
see if sailor can take it
sailor couldnot
he squirmed like a worm on a hot rock bawling out for honey not to shoot
but sailor still had some of the stuff he had in the fight ring and he began to fight back
and honey savoni was closing incautiously because honey likes himselfbut closing in nevertheless
and the ruckus brought two more of the rats from the room off the hall
i knew all of them
not personally of course
their mugs were on file in the division
the last two were skeet filmore a thinfaced little rat with buckteeth and fats googan a beefy one with a tic that made his mouth twitch
all four were nick dariant trigger men
both newcomers had rods and had a muffler on it
i figured when they got ready to kill meand it looked like that time was coming on skeet would be delegated to do the job
i was fighting nasty
my knee had found groin one fist in his face and the other in his stomach below the belt
which doesnot mean that sailor wasnot doing anything about it
my chin had found his fist three or four lost count and i was as groggy as a gob on shore leave
but sailor was plenty sick and i made a wild swing that caught him flush on the button and sent him reeling staggering away to flounder blindly into the wall and slump down
the others were right on me then and i had to shake my head hard to keep the hallway itself from jumping up and down
i was thinking that a girl with nice ankles had let me in for this
let me drop this copper
skeet fillmore wheezed through his nose
his gun with the awkwardlooking muffler was shoved against my teeth
he had been smoking up his own profits i could smell the weed on his breath and see the ugly shine of his eyes
how i did it i donot know
again the practice from dodging popbottles i guess
skeet just didnot pull the trigger fast enough
my hand slapped up whacked against the gun
it coughed in my face parted my hair neatly in the middle and powderburned my forehead
i had sense enough to know that an automatic with that kind of a muffler had to be cocked between shots
while our misguided mr fillmore was trying to do that i hit him
the blow cracked like a cappistol and his head went way back
skeet went over sank flat on the floor lay still was cursing fervently he hit me over my ear with the muzzle of the tommygun
i slogged to my knees and couldnot get up
honey drew back for a finishing blow but fats googan caught his arm
everything stopped in that hallway like a moving picture when the film breaks
somebody was pounding on the door
open up
open up
the lawthe hick law
fats whispered hoarsely his mouth jerking hard
scram
honey cried
they were leaving and i couldnot get up
my elbows kept folding under my weight
sailor pringle was going too yawing behind them in a zigzag trail
then a hefty body hit the front door and it cracked heaving in a couple of big cops in toonerville uniforms
halt called one of the cops
he had a big round face and he raised a big heavy black gun
but sailor didnot halt and the others were already through the back door of the hall
the cops jumped over me and skeet fillmore on the floor and went rushing after them
doors slammed and then the big guns started off
i heard tommy chattering wild and devilish out there
then a car roared
i was surprised to see the cops come back in both as good as new
luck of the irish i guess
they got away one said dolefully all this the other demanded trying to find out i mumbled and managed to show them my badge
the watchman told us you asked the way to miss the redfaced one said
we didnot like the looks of it this time of night so we came out glad you didyou saved my life
one of the cops had a drink on him and he offered it to me
it brought me around
they found surgical tape in the house and patched the places where had the corners knocked off my skull
i went over and took a look at skeet fillmore
he was dead the trouble with a longtime addict
life hangs by such a slender thread with them
a little sock and out goes his heart
and i was genuinely sorry because a dead man canot talk
they took body away with them and said theyd phone in an alarm to go on the shortwave
i let it go at that
what i wanted what the division wanted was the hide of the devil behind all dariant
honey savoni wouldnot lead us to him as long as he was chased
in the living room of julia cottage i flopped in an armchair and searched around
i started putting two and two together and got a hatful of things i didnot like
the girl had been watched just as speck had guessed
perhaps the kid brother had sung to savoni
then speck had stepped into the buzzsaw just as i had
the savoni mob had taken him the girl and the boy jimmy
where
they had come back to sit on the cottage like a hen on a nest of eggs
and smart guy i had walked into their parlor
i went over the house with a finetoothed comb
no soap
back in the living room i searched around some more
two demons were beating tin pans in my head
then i saw a book lying open face down on the mantle
that book meant something mob would not have been reading oliver twist
either julia proctor or speck chandler had left the volume there
if it was speck thered be some message about it for me
i marked the place where the book was open and put it through an examination
at last i got it there were tiny indentationssuch as might have been made by a fingernailunder certain letters of the reading matter
grabbing a pencil searching those faint marks out with acute care i wrote down the letters farmeightmilesnmilstead farm eight miles north of milstead
i could reconstruct what had happened here
the gang had held speck here probably waiting for a chance to move him out
he heard them talk knew where they were going to take him
when they were not watching too closely he had left this message
milstead was seventy miles northwest of fenway a hamlet on the highway
i called fanny by long distance and told her i had a lead and was going right on after speck
but i didnot tell her that nick favorite method was a spray of machinegun bullets in the face and interment in a limepit
a noon the next day i was up a pole literally climbing spikes were strapped to my legs a safetybelt encircled my waist and the pole and through binoculars i was studying a farm a quartermile away
this wasnot the first pole i had climbed nor the first farm i had studied through the glasses
there were a bunch of farms eight miles north of milstead and i hadnot passed up a bet
this one at casual glance looked like all others in the vicinity
but a big section at the rear of it was bordered on all sides by a thick bois darc hedge and in that section was growing a brand of cotton no cotton farmer would acknowledge
it was growing lush thick and broadcast instead of in rows
under my glass it had long downslanting ladyfinger leaves
mexican hempthe marijuana plant
here then was nick supply of the weed
roughly i calculated he had about half a million dollars worth of it on the stem enough to ruin the lives of the population of a city
about the time i had that thought one of the glass insulators about eighteen inches from my face exploded
chips of glass cut my face a bullet screamed away like a banshee and across from the big modern twostory farmhouse came the sound of a gun
i whipped my glasses that way and saw the figure of a man in one of the upper windows
his rifle winked again and a long raw splinter ripped off the crossarm to which i was holding
jerking my spikes free wrapping arms about the pole i began to slide down
the bullets followed me
they made ugly notches on the pole right at my face
one breezed through my clothes with a hot breath scraping my hide at the waist
other guns began booming closerhoods in the bois darc hedge who had been guarding the marijuana field
and i saw a car put out from the house
i was slipping as fast as i could without letting go entirely
i was about halfway down when a bullet cut the safetybelt and gravity did the job of getting me to the ground
it was a shocking jar but no bones broke
i got up running
the car was racing along a narrow lane and would be here in seconds
there were five men in it and i saw a machinegun poking out the rear window
i was in timbered pasture land ducking among bushes and low brush
and right there i pulled a little trick of psychology on them
i knew theyd expect me to run away from danger so i ran toward it
my car was in the other direction but i had brought up a carryingcase with my ment in it and cached it not far from my lookout pole
men had left the car and were running through the pasture
honey savoni had the machinegun
fats googan had a thirtyshot luger
the others were as well heeled
they were getting closer and closer
they were as wary as lynxcats
behind a bush i shed the linemans doodads stripping for speed bet the rat run the other way
fats cried out
i tumbled into a shallow depression with some weeds along its sides
i scuttled along on all fours going toward the lane until i was just opposite the clump where my stuff was cached
but there was open space between it and me
the chance had to be taken
i sprinted up and ran for it putting on all my steam
honey savoni yelled
his tommy began its insane jabber
a heel was knocked from my shoe
i saw pieces of ground eaten away in front of me
that brush clump was the home plate and i slid into it like a runner in the last of the ninth with the score tied
thorns clawed at me but i hardly knew it
i grabbed up the carryingcase with my left hand and plunged out of the bushes on the other side
right across from me was the gangs car parked in the lane
a hood was standing by it on guard with a big automatic in his hand
he had seen me coming had his gun up
my own was up too
i shot him in the chest just as his gun went off and his bullet zipped by my head
that cured him permanently of the gang killers favorite trickshooting at his victims face
the motor of the car was still going and mad crew was still coming like a pack of hounds
i pushed the dead man from the running board and leaped in under the wheel
it was a big heavy car with thick nonshatterable glassalmost an armored car
i made a tank out of that car
i didnot go back down the lane because that way they would cut me off literally rip the tires off of it with their guns
i whirled the machine halfway around and headed straight into a wire fence
wires snapped like fiddle strings and i roared across rows of cotton straight for the house
the machine cut through the plants like a scythe
while i drove with my left hand i opened the case beside me with my right and took out the submachinegun
guns opened up from the house
spider webs appeared on the windshield
bullets beat like sharp hammers on the body
and gun noises were driving me on from behind
i through another wire fence hurdled a ditch and roared across a gravel lane that bordered the grounds of the house
then i was facing a sturdy white paling fence
the car hit it with a crash made a hole in it slapped the fence to the ground for twenty feet on each side
the grounds of the house were nicely landscaped with dwarf cedars and firs
the car took these in its stride slicing down a tall graceful lombardy poplar for extra measure
i couldnot stop and get outit was raining lead and i had no umbrella
there was a tiled sun porch on this side of the house just about level with the yard
i drove straight at it
it had two thick brick columns but i gunned the machine to the floor i thought i could drive between them
i did but i left rear fenders behind
looking out on the sun porch was a big wide cathedral window reaching to the floor
again i gunned to the bottom hit the window center
glass metal framework mortar crashed around me like all hell
there was a twofoot drop beyond the window and the car leaped in like some live devil from a dream
there it came to a halt astride a studio couch with its nose hooked over a library table
on the other side of the room was an open archway with double columns on each side of it
a man was behind the right side columns with the nose of a machinegun poked be66 tween them belching fire and death at me
the bedlam was hideous
i flopped down below the dash as the windshield was eaten away and fell in stiards on my back
i wormed to the floor with the gear lever pressing my stomach and reached across to the handle of the righthand door
when it swung open i went out with it dragging the machinegun
glass shattered out of the door as the gunner spotted my move
but i crouched low behind the side of the hood low enough to have the protection of the heavy metal of the motor from which bullets were gonging like demons beating a triangle
more men had come down the stairs beyond the archway their rods joining the hellish din
i raised my tommy just above the engine hood got a lightning bead between those two columns squeezed trigger
the gun bucked and jumped in my hands
the man with the chopper neighed out like a stricken horseonce then he and his gun disappeared from the niche
the artillery on the stairs behind him backed up beat a retreat turning to flee the steps
they couldnot take it
seeing their man die in a bloody mess like that broke their nerve
maybe i sensed donot know
i went on because i couldnot go back
a i hit the bottom step the last of the rats above was quitting the landing
he tried to fire down on me
he wasnot fast enough
my spray of bullets carried away half his side and he came tumbling down the stairs a lump of dying flesh
i was a little sick from the carnage but i was a little crazy too
when i reached the top of the stairs i was cocked for more of it
but i came face to face with three thugs who had dropped their weapons and had their hands high
it was pretty brutal
but i couldnot take a chance on their treachery and i didnot have time to tie them up
i socked themone two threeon the conk with the barrel of the tommy
after i had kicked their weapons through the bannister to clatter down the stairs i ran on down the corridor
some one was shouting
i knew it was speck chandler and my heart leaped high with joy
a window was open at the end of the corridor and i looked out
the four men were running across the yard skirting around a fish pond
honey was in the lead gripping his tommygun
i aimed my own at their feet intending to plow up the ground in front of them as a warning
i triggered
nothing happened
the drum was empty
and i had left my service revolver in the wrecked car
i didnot might have wilted
i had to bluff it take the chance
all right of you
drop your guns and reach or take lead on tender places
i yelled
to a man they looked up
saw my chopper beaded on them
there was a motionless moment never forget their white faces upturned toward me
that nerve in fats face jerking at the corner of his mouth gash of a mouth slack in surprise the others blank
honey made a half gesture to raise his weapon when fats googan babbled a curse and threw down his gun
then honey let go of his and the others followed suit
kick them in the fishpond
i ordered
they obeyed while i watched
then i turned away
their fangs were drawn there is no danger in a gangster when his gun is gone
they might lam but i knew they could be picked up as soon as i phoned in an alarm
i listened now to speck shouting
dinkey dinkey he yelled
look out for nick
nick dariant
how i would look out for him
how i had craved to come face to face with him
now good luck or bad luck with me i wouldand with a gun
but i traced the sound of voice ranged down from the corri dor
i spotted it behind the third door
the door was locked
i lunged against the door and broke it open
but no shots bombs or other forms of destruction greeted me
instead i was looking into a very nicely furnished room where speck chandler julia proctor and her kid brother sat rigidly in chairs
they were taped to them like so many mummies
nick dariant was not in the room
when freed them speck sheepishly tried to say something appropriate the girl was crying from reaction and hugging her brother who was a manly looking little chap after all
then she was hugging me and she kissed me
i liked it all right but i didnot want to go soft then
i growled got to get nick
we went out of the room into the corridor
we kept together
i didnot tell speck and the others my gun was empty
we tried doors
they were locked and i was tired of crashing things
then a voice sounded from the other end of the long hallway
all right ruined my hideout busted my racket havenot you
take this from nick dariant as a little token
i whirled and saw nick
just a glimpse of him
his matinee idol figure his greek god face eyes crazy now classic features in a twisted cast of fury
then he raised his right arm and threw with all his mighta bomb
i saw that bomb coming on and on growing bigger for what seemed like hours
we were all huddled together at the end of the hallway we couldnot run we were hemmed in by walls and locked doors
it wasnot a standard bomb but a handmanufactured one round and about the size of a baseball it made me sick inside to think what that much highexplosive could do to us
it came on like a groundliner and i realized that it was going to hit the floor and skim along to our very feet
i must have thought i wasnot in that hall any more
i was on the baseball diamond and maybe i could hear the fans yelling what gone through made me a little berserk
that bomb was a baseball a fast groundskinner coming at me redhot from the smash of a bat and i was racing to meet it to pick it up caught it as it hit the floor
i didnot know until a long time later that a bone in my hand was cracked
my hand lashed up and i returned it hot as it had comeputting all the steam i had on that return
nick dariant saw it coming but he seemed paralyzed couldnot move
then there was an awful growl of sound in our ears the house shook and nick was blotted from sight by a jagged blast of flame
there was a hole in the wall a hole in the floor and plaster and lath ripped out and fell
and somewhere in that debris was what was left of nick dariant
it was funny that think right then of speck wife waiting by the telephone and the two kids who had crawled over me the night before asking about their daddy
you go phone fanny this minute you big lug
i said roughly to speck
then i went blind as a bat and reeled over
when i came to i was stretched out flat on a couch in one of the rooms and the girl was bending over me
i could see her ankles and they were as trim as ever
i knew been right about those ankles
i tried to grin give jimmy a whipping down if i ever catch him smoking offbrand cigarettes again i said
how about a date tonight lady
she bent closer and maybe crazy but i thought there were tears in her eyes and she seemed like she couldnot speak for a moment
and she kind of choked up when she spoke
what time shall i expect you
mr davis she said
i midforties of new york city not far from fifth avenue stands the huge building which houses the scientific crime club
the clubs luxurious quarters are on the roof far removed from the turmoil of busy city streets
there is a little garden of pebbled winding paths between flower beds and trellises with a splashing fountain in its center
one of the rooms has sliding walls and roof which in pleasant weather may be opened to the sky
and there are other rooms of luxurious leather lounging chairs a little bar and restaurant with whitecoated attendants
bridge and chess tables are here a billiard room a small bowling alley a shooting gallery a small gymnasium and pool
outwardly they are rooms for wealthy men at play
but some of them are very strangely equipped
one is crowded with expensive devices of modern science an electrical laboratory a room equipped for research chemistry and physics
and there is a room which would seem to be a theatrical storehousescenery props of every imaginable kind ranged in an orderly litter
they are the clubs equipment when it is at work
no one visiting the club for the first time would think of it as more than a playground
but the lighting effects of its rooms can be made extraordinary for they have wiring as intricate as any theatrical stage
there are ingenious secret panels in some of the walls hidden traps in the floor and the roofan amazing equipment which may not be used for a year but is always available by author of the mental giant for the scientific probing of the minds of suspected criminals who may be brought here
the club members largely are wealthy professional men
upon a warm summer night a group of them were gathered in one of the lounging rooms
some club members were here by chance others had been summoned as spectators and participants in a case which just today had come before the club
the services of the members dr allaire plumbs the depths of a i didnot do itl condemned by fate etc the resources of the clubhave for years been at the disposal of the police or any individual who cares to demand them
the cases come at irregular intervals generally from the police of new york city and its outlying districts clueless affairs usually with definite suspects upon whom by ordinary police methods guilt would probably never be fastened
the case tonight was typical
the psychologist lounging in his a tale from the chair with his fellow members around him was saying a pathetic affair gentlemen
the girlshe was only sixteenkilled herself last evening
and perhaps almost simultaneously her father was murdered
how do you know she killed herself the banker demanded
why not a double murder
the facts are against it the psychologist said
the thing happened in maple about this time last evening
peter mackenzie and his daughter alice
they lived in a small but very respectable lodging house
he was a widowera glass blower in the torrence glass works out there
and the girl kept house for him took poison i understand the doctor interjected
why asked the very young man eagerly
was she a pretty girl dr allaire
they say she was the psychologist answered
an oldfashioned sort of girl
her father brought her here from scotland just after she was born
the father was a man of fifty
you know the typeindustrious thrifty squarely solid both in physical build and in character
a plain man of doggedly high principles
and he brought his daughter up in just that fashion
they say the girl was dutiful gentle sweet and she killed herself the very young man sighed wish i had known her
maybe then at nine oclock last evening the psychologist went on peter mackenzie is known to have gone out and left his daughter at home
they were both agitatedthe landlady heard their voices but nothing that they said
at ten oclock she went up to see alice
the girl was mind to secure a halting confession lying on her bed unconscious from an overdose of sedative
she never recovered consciousness she died at dawn today
and last nightat ninethirty while the girl was ending her lifeless than two miles away her father was being murdered
and there is a clear connection the lawyer asked
there is indeed
the greyhaired distinguishedlooking psychologist sat up in his chair smoothing a crumpled bit of paper in his hand
here is the note she left pathetic simple words
he read father darling he doesnot love me so why bother
i hope you tell him so
but even as much as i love you i cannot live without him
oh please forgive was a brief silence the men staring at the psychologist put the smudged tearstained bit of paper back into his pocket
then the lawyer said it se6ms obvious that her father went to meet the man she loved
exactly the psychologist agreed
that inference is plain
they met
and the unknown man killed a bridge high over the central railroad tracks in the outskirts of maple grove
we have a witness to it
the train for new york had just left the maple grove station
it wasnot going very fast when it reached the bridge
the engineer plainly saw two men high up there the silhouettes of them
he saw the murderer shoving mackenzieand saw mackenzie come hurtling downstriking not the track on which the train was advancing but the one adjacent
the fall killed him
the murderer perhaps had intended to throw him in front of the train if the engineer saw the murderer what did he look like the lawyer demanded
just a bareheaded silhouette
no details
the silhouette of a man peering dpwn then running away
now gentlemen you can see easily why marberry of maple grove referred the case to us
this man whom the little alice loved more than her father or her lifeonly she and her father knew his identity
and there you have the murder motive
this stern old scotchman meeting this man the murderer felt that he could control the girl the astronomer suggested
or perhaps he would have murdered her later the psychologist said
her suicide saved him the trouble
the case gentlemen by inference is extraordinarily simple
but that indeed is exactly why the police are balked
there are no tangible clues
nothing but inferencean assumption of what happened and why it happened
which wouldnot get very far before a jury the lawyer interjected
defense counsel would knock that sort of evidence into a cocked hat
exactly the psychologist agreed
we have the suspectsand nothing else
it wasnothard even in a few short hours today for marberry to locate the possible men for whom alice mackenzie could have had this attachment
there are only two
a young fellow named george bolton who works in an office here in new york and a rich widower of thirty an exactor named thomas dale who was fortunate in a mining speculation and now has retired from business
both were seen frequently in the girls companyold mackenzie seemed to like them both
and where were they last evening the lawyer demanded
the psychologist smiled wryly
marberry has been grilling them all day
young bolton was in his maple grove boarding house roomon the ground floor so that he could easily have gone in and out the window without attracting attention
thomas dale was alone in his maple grove apartment with a private entrance to the street so that no one but himself can say whether he was there all evening or not
and its up to us to make the choice the very young man claimed
but how in the devil sent for them the psychologist said be here any minute
now gentlemefi there is little for you to domost of it negative
you may hear for instance a queer grinding clicking noise
ignore it
pretend it does not exist
i want the murderer perhaps to think he is imagining it the lean sensitive face was grim now as he added the guilt is in the brain of one of these two men going to drag it outwithout him knowing it
a club attendant appeared at the door of the room
george bolton is here to see dr allaire
send him in
the psychologist stood up
the idea is gentlemen he added hurriedly told both these suspects that a wealthy eccentric criminologist is interested in the casethat he is convinced they are both innocenthas hired me scientifically to demonstrate it
whether they believe that or not is immaterial
neither dared refuse to come
so you gentlemen act with the assumption of sympathy
an experiment in applied psychologyto prove innocence not guilt
and we will entered the room and stood staring surprised confused by the number of men all of whom were gazing at him intently
he was a tall blond broadshouldered very handsome young fellow dressed in a neat dark business suit
drallaire he said hesitantly am dr allaire the psychologist said
he indicated a chair
sit down please
thank you for coming mr bolton
the young man smiled do you do
i thought gotten into the wrong room
these gentlemen are my fellow club members the psychologist explained need not introduce them by name
gentlemen this is mr bolton
the police seem to think he might be guilty of the crime been describing to you
young bolton smiled nervously at the men as he sat down
the police have been pretty tough on me all day
what is it you want of me dr allaire
lord knows fve already told again the attendant appeared
mr thomas dale is here dr allaire
send him in arthur
at the name young bolton had leaped to his feet
dale
why you didnot tell mewhat is this some more inquisition
no the psychologist smiled
quite the reverse
sit down mr bolton
the police told me that was one of your too impetuous
if i can prove your innocence youll be free of the police you understand
as things are they canot prove a thing but theyll hound you trying and hoping but the young man wasnot listening
with flushed face he stared at the door where now thomas dale stood calmly surveying the room
dr allaire am dr allaire
come in mr dale
the psychologist introduced the club members
the second suspect was an extreme contrast to young man of thirty short but powerfully built
his dark hair was thinning at the temples
his smoothshaven face of rugged features was somewhat pale
he had been an actor and it showed now in the selfpossession with which he acknowledged the introductions
and then his quiet gaze landed upon bolton who was standing with clenched fists
how do you do bolton he said didnot know you had been invited here
where do you want me to sit dr allaire
certainly there was no love lost between the two men
the psychologist placed them in small chairs side by side
they were diagonally facing the intent group of club members with the psychologist standing before them owe you both an explanation he began quietly have been commissioned to try and produce some evidence that will persuade the police to let you alone
my client is aware that there is no evidence against either of you who is your client
bolton asked
is he here
no one is interested in me am not at liberty to name him the psychologist said
perhaps it is myself
why not
i am interestedwell to be frank if not in you two certainly in applied psychology
he smiled at the two men who now were staring at him with an almost breathless intentness
and it was obvious that both of them considered his words as a preface to some new questioning with the same purpose the police had had all day
one was guilty
one innocent
no choice could be made from their outward aspect
wholly different types they had balked the police young bolton with an impetuous angry flush or grim sullenness and thomas dale with a seemingly quiet desire to give all the information he could and an imperturbable selfpossession
it is not my purpose to question you the psychologist went on manas the police have told youwas seen killing peter mackenzie
unfortunately the witness cannot describe that man
it could have been either of youor anyone of a thousand other men which is very hard on us dale said
it is indeed
i quite agree with you
to come to the have invited these gentlemen here as witnesses to an experiment in psychology wait a minute mr bolton donot interrupt me please
you are both innocentyou have told the police so
and both of you know by now very well indeed that there is not a particle of evidence against either one of you he paused and then he abruptly added you donot know do you anything of what happened between mackenzie and his murderer on that bridge do not bolton said
how could dale said
my idea is to tell you what happened the psychologist continued
he smiled faintly
not that i know what happened because i donot
but what i tell you i want you to remember
will you try donot understand dale began
then both he and bolton nodded dubiously
the watching men could not miss the fact that both were frightened
but still there could be no choice a guilty man afraid of exposurebut an innocent man would also be afraid that by some mischance he would be incriminated
yes they both said
and dale added try my best to do whatever you suggest
thanks
an abrupt tenseness seemed to come to the room as the psychologist took a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and adjusted his glasses have here some notes i made on what probably happened up there on the bridge
i am going to read them to want you to listen carefully
the theory isinto your empty mind i am going to put these facts
they are quite simple
i want you to engrave them there in your brain stared at the flushed young bolton and the pale thomas dale
perhaps one of them now had a wild desire to withdraw but if so he did not dare show it
are you ready the psychologist added quietly
again they both nodded
very slowly with careful but drab intonation which emphasized no word the psychologist read the murderer led his victim onto the bridge
they talked in the moonlight about alice
they were angry
the murderer said never made love to her
then they sat on the bench by the rail and the victim said
but it is not like my child
you cannot make me believe it
the victim was toying with a blue cap in his hand
then a ment later the murderer pushed him over the rail
he fell to the railroad track and lay crumpled between the gleaming rails with the moonlight bathing him
the room was heavily silent as the psychologist paused
and looking up from his notes he added clear isnot it
i want you to memorize it not necessarily word for word but the exact sense of it read it again
even more slowly more drably than before he repeated it
and then at once added you jack bruce from across the room the very young man looked startled
yes sir
just beyond that door the psychologist gestured put a small table with some articles on it bring it in will you please
carefully jack the very young man hastened to obey and came back at once from the adjoining room dragging a small square table with a group of miscellaneous articles spread upon it
here you are dr allaire
thanks jack
the psychologist drew the table before young bolton and thomas dale who stared at it silently
without speaking the psychologist touched a switch
the roomlights faded
shadows enveloped all the intent men and from the ceiling a narrow white beam of light came down to illumine the table with the objects lying there fully revealed in the white glare
the psychologist was in the shadow
close at the edge of the circle of white illumination young bolton and dale sat staring fascinated
there were perhaps twenty objects arranged on the table
they were all commonplace seemingly without any relation to each other dr personal card an envelope and letterhead of the scientific crime club a mans brown felt hat and gloves a silverheaded cane an old battered doll a blue knitted little cape a few the shadows the psychologist said quietly my idea is to put into your mind a knowledge of these things almost all of which are wholly unrelated to the crime
that was doll young bolton said abruptly
yes dale agreed seen it
she said she had it most of her life she treasured it have no purpose of trying to find out which of them you recognize the psychologist said
that isquite he let his voice trail away and in the silence of the shadowed room now a very faint sound was audible
a low grinding clinking sound
it was muffledindescribably queer
it lasted no more than five seconds
in the darkness someone shifted his feet as though startled
dale and bolton both murmured something but the voice had only stopped for those five seconds and now he was talking again the things on that table have no relation to each other he moved forward into the white glare and shoved the table away
forget them
i want you only to remember what happened on the bridge between the victim and the murderer
i read it to you twice his pocket he took two pencils and two small pads of writing paper and handed them to young bolton and dale
you can scribble in the darkness he said
and neither can see what the other is writing
put your name at the topand then write your memory of what i read you
well dale murmured may get it wrong bolton said
do your best
neither of them wrote hastily
it was several minutes before they had finished
here you are bolton said
dale handed his silently
the psychologist took the two scrawled papers
in the silence of the shadowed room several of the men tensely shifted themselves in their chairs
thomas dale and young bolton were dim blobs the gloom
at the circle of white glare beating down on the floor now where the table had been the psychologist stood in shadow a moment he silently read what the two men had written
this is very interesting gentlemen
there was just a hint of emotion vibrating in his voice comparison of these two little essays with my original will interest you all very much indeed
to refresh your memories read you again my exact original words which mr bolton and mr dale attempted to reproduce canot be sure dale murmured out of the darkness interrupt me now please the psychologist retorted sharply
he was holding his original paper into the light
here was what i asked them to reproduce the murderer led his victim onto the bridge
they talked in the moonlight about alice
they were angry
the murderer said never made love to her
they then sat on the bench by the rail and the victim said but it is not like my child
you cannot make me believe it
the victim was toying with a blue cap in his hand
then a moment later the murderer pushed him over the rail
he fell to the railroad track and lay crumpled between the gleaming rails with the moonlight bathing him
there is the original
now here is what one of them wrote
analyze it carefully gentlemen
the murderer took his victim to the bridge
they stood in the starlight and they talked angrily about alice
the murderer said did not ever make love to her
they were sitting by the rail and mackenzie said
my child is not like that
i donot believe it
he was toying with something blue in his hand
then suddenly the murderer shoved him over the rail
he fell and lay crumpled on the gleaming railroad track bathed by the starlight
from the darkness of the intent room as the psychologist paused came the voice
he seems to have made several errors dr allaire but i donot exactly see what let me analyze them for you
please be quiet you twono apologies are necessary for your errors
this writer says starlight instead of moonlight
he says they were sitting by the rail
i mentioned that they sat on the bench by the rail
he says mackenzie was toying with something blue in his hand
i said it was a blue cap but he evidently forgot that
the psychologist was talking swiftly now
so much for that one gentlemen
now read you the other
the murderer and his victim went out onto the bridge
it was moonlight and they talked about the girl and the murderer said but i did not ever make love to her
they were sitting on the box by the rail
mackenzie was toying with a blue cape in his hand and the murderer said it is not my child you cannot mako me believe it
then the murderer pushed him through the rail andhe fell to the track with the gleaming headlight bathing him
a startled gasp had come from several of the men in the darkness
gentlemen the psychologist added which is the guilty version
that one
several of them chorused it question of it the psychologist said crisply
lights marberry please
a glare of lights sprang in the room
thomas dale was sitting pale intent awestruck
young george bolton was on his feet flushed trembling with a hand flung before his eyes in the glare a lie he cried didnot do it
i didnot mean to write those things
i donot know what possessed me the guilt in your brain possessed you the psychologist said ironically your man marberry
from the doorway the bulky uniformed police sergeant sprang ward gripping the terrified bolton
so they got youan i couldnot
come onout with ityou canot lie out of this mean there isnot anything to lie out of
you take your hands off me found out more about him this afternoon the sergeant said been making love to an heiress over in pleasant hills
i located herdragged it out of her a lie
bolton stood struggling in the grip
oh is it
marberry said
well youll get a chance to tell her that before the then bolton suddenly broke
all right i did it
you let me alone i tell you
stop torturing meall of youlet me alone am engaged to herher father knows it and poor little alice mackenzie with her coming child and her dogged outraged fatherthey were the obstacles the psychologist said murder motive as old as history
and despicable beyond most murder motives
take him away marberry
a when the room had quieted the psychologist said that was a very simple psychological test gentlemenand one that is almost infallible
a true and a false memory cannot be distinguished by the mind
bolton undoubtedly knew he had a dangerous problem
whatever guilty facts i had mentioned he also must mention
to have ignored guilty facts would have been a confession that he recognized them as guilty
dale had no guilty memories at all to confuse him
he had no problem except to try and remember what i had read
he said starlight got it mixed with moonlight
it generally is mixed on a clear night
he forgot the blue remembered something blue
he forgot the bench on which they were sitting
that was reasonable
a bench is unusual on a bridge
as a matter of fact there is no bench on that bridge wanted to make sure of refreshing the guilty memories in this murderers mind and confusing those guilty memories with the memory of what i had read
you recall that faint mysterious clanking sound a while ago which we all ignored
it meant nothing to the innocent thomas dale
it was my simulationin an adjoining room hereof the sound of the gears shifting the railroad semaphore signals which are on the bridge
we knew the murderer must have heard those gears shift as the train approached
they make quite a racket and he and mackenzie were sitting on the gear box
and the articles on that table the psychologist continued most of them were meaningless
to the innocent dale that little blue cape lying beside doll probably looked like a doll cape
but to the murderer it was a little garment for the coming baby
mackenzie had it in his handthey found it still clutched in his dead fingers
evidently he had brought it to appeal to this seducer
bolton recognized it on the table
and when i said blue owned no blue capit was almost inevitable that bolton should confuse the memories and think that i said blue cape
and he was the only one who knew of the coming child
the autopsy showed it but the fact was never mentioned
he garbled my sentences on that pointgot my words almost all correctbut out came his guilty knowledge of the child when i had said something wholly different
and mackenzie was pushed through the rail not over it
and in the deep railroad cut the moonlight did not penetrate down at his victimhad an inescapable memory of the body bathed not by moonlight but by the headlight of the advancing train
guilty memories gentlemen are the murderers greatest danger almost impossible for him to hide themif you dig for them in scientific fashion
ken boyce burns the road for easy the revolvers blasted lead novelette i a crash i like seeing a traffic cop in the middle of a south african veldt
ken boyce felt like that
he told himself anyone would feel like that seeing him strolling along this serene country highway
he didnot belong on this highway any more than the cop belonged on the veldt
he didnot fit in with the fencedin pastures the blotches of green woods and cultivated fields that rolled in gentle swells for miles on either side of the road
he didnot fit in with the specks of white that were the distant farmhouses and only signs of civilization in the countryside
there was nothing rural about ken boyce
the smart snapbrim the impeccable pinstriped grey flannel suit that clung trimly to his tall well knitted frame suggested park avenue extravagant tips to taxi drivers and expensive hotels
the colt automatic in the holster under his left shoulder suggested business
an insurance detective tries for a long mone heels who infest the highway s across the open road there was the sound of a car coming from behind
boyce turned eagerly to meet it started to hoist his thumb after the inveterate manner of a hitchhiker
muttering in disgust he dropped his thumb and let the car go by without hailing it
it was a rattletrap model with a corpulent redfaced farmer sitting rigidly behind the wheel
boyce cursed softly
there wasnot any use bumming a ride from that kind of a setup
he wanted the bigger cars that looked expensive to operate
the guy who drove that kind would have dough and if hed made his dough anywhere around this hick district hed just be sucker enough and soft enough to pick up a stranger
especially when the stranger didnot look like a bum
still swearing softly he stamped his feet on the macadam of the highway to get the dust off his shoes
ken boyce prided himself on his ability to dress
it was his weakness
he liked expensive clothes and he liked expensive shoes
these shoes for instance these custommade fullbrogued shoes had cost gets a swell closeup him fortyfive bucks
there was only one shop in new york that sold them an ultra smart shop that he cheerfully frequented whenever he had any money and could buy good shoes
he cursed the quiet serenity of the countryside
it got on his nerves
he cursed the fact that hed spent two of his last twelve bucks for bus fare to this hellforsaken farm district
he ought to have known better than to attempt a job like this on his own
when hed climbed out of the bus three or four miles back at some jerkwater little burg he should have turned around and gone back to new york instead of hiking down this placid deserted highway
hell he wasnot even sure that this was the right spot
it was just a wild surmise hed had picking this spot
the racket had worked once before here and he saw no reason why it wouldnot work again heard the sound of another car behind him
if it werenot for the fact that he had ten bucks between him and a vacuum stomach and the fact that he was in bad with kelly because big shot ace daggert had put another one over on him and monopolized every rackethell if it werenot for daggert ken boyce knew hed never even have attempted this longshot job
boyce had to admire daggert because the bigtime racketeer was a dresser like himself
he liked expensive clothes too had earned his nickname ace because of his extravagant taste
but daggert was a racketeer and a killer and he had put one over on boyce for the last time
that was the reason kelly had fired him
and boyce had figured if hed go off on his own and pull a job like this successfully maybe kelly would reinstate him
because this was a job that none of boys had been able to pull off
the car rushed abreast of him
boyce turned languidly then his heart skipped a few strokes
this was the kind of car hed been waiting fori he jerked up his thumb
hey he yelled
going my way
the big expensivelooking sedan flashed by him
then he heard the sound of brakes and tires skidding on the macadam
the sedan pulled to a stop twenty yards in front of him and he could see the driver turn around and beckon to him through the window in the rear
boyce ran to the car took time hastily to brush his immaculate suit before he opened the door to the front seat many thanks he smiled thought never get a lift
the man at the steering wheel grinned goodnaturedly
get in he said going as far as elmsdale
i been home eating lunch and i reckon mary took too long to feed me
i got to get back to the bank president of the bank
finest bank in elmsdale
only bank in elmsdale mighty proud of it
get in friend
get in
boyce smiled at the typical loquacity of the obvious small town citizen
and yetand his smile was a trifle grima banker would be an ideal setup for the job
he couldnot have struck it better or luckier
he got in beside the rotund jovialfaced little man and the banker started the car again
my names herbert knox the little man said
what you doing hiking this highway friend
you look like a city feller
you look like those pictures in the fashion magazines
you look like you could afford an airplane stead of hoofing it
boyce ignored the mans affable curiosity
he kept his eyes on the road as though searching intently for something
you pick up strangers like this very often he said
knox laughed give everybody a lift friend why people keep their money in my bank
i trust everybody and they trust me
but a stranger
i might pull a gun on you and frisk you for everything youve got
knox winked out of the comer of his eye
not you he laughed
you donot need money
not with those classy duds
now if you looked like a bum never stopped and picked you up
boyce nodded eyes still searching the road
it was no wonder he thought the racket had worked in this part of the country before
people around here were real people honest farmers
they were guileless
and this racket was ingenious it had worked on far more sophisticated people than farmers
it was a cinch
and if ken boyce could get into it then kelly would give him another chanceand another chance to get in with ace daggert
boyce suddenly started sat upright in the seat
knox whistled said softly be darned
on the right side of the road facing their oncoming car her thumb asking for a lift was a feminine hitchhiker
but like ken boyce she wasnot an ordinary hitchhiker
she was slim and from that distance beautiful
her modish sport suit had come from a fashionably expensive designer in some large city
she looked like a ravenhaired heiress out for a stroll got to stop for that girl knox said smiling and jamming on the brakes a lulu
she looks like your class mister
some pumpkin
wonder why she wants a ride
he backed the car until it came to a stop beside the girl
going my way maam he asked smiling
glad to give you a lift far as elmsdale
boyce saw that her clothes were not imitation
they were the real thing
he appreciated that
he appreciated the brown eyes with an iridescent touch of violet in them the small pert nose and the firm red lips which smiled a little hesitantly as she climbed into the back seat
one thing struck him singularly something about her eyes the way she held her lips indicated that she was nervous and tense
more than that she was distraught and afraid though she tried to conceal it
as the car started boyce threw his left arm around the back of the seat half turned and said a long way from home arenot you she smiled quickly at him
yes i ama little
new york
she hesitated a moment then said yes
now you take new york knox began only been to it once but even tones interrupted him as he addressed the girl
did you run out of gas or something going home she said was in a show in new york and it closed
i couldnot get anything else to do so i started home
i came as far as i could on the bus before i ran out of money
there was nothing else to do and i thought perhaps i could catch rides
say now
knox began again sympathetically mighty tough
but again boyce cut him short
where is your home
maryland going to be a long walk if you donot catch a good many long rides
yes
yes but its the only thing i can do
boyce watched her
she was biting her delicate underlip
he knew she was lying
she had answered him as though she were reciting lines that someone had forced her to memorize
but he liked her
she was beautiful but she had a lot more than just beautyand she was deathly afraid
he knew busses ran only twice a day through this part of new jersey
and she hadnot been on his bus
if shed come on the one early that morning it had taken her an awfully long time to walk this far
but he liked her
he liked the way her eyes seemed to reach out to him and appeal in a mutely ashamed way for help
for some reason he knew hed help her just as he knew she was trying her ut80 most to be honest with him and was afraid to be
knox started to say something over his shoulder as he gave the car more gas
and then he uttered an alarmed cry and the car jolted and swerved violently as he applied the brakes with all his strength
ken boyce swung around and his eyes widened
instinctively he stiffened his legs against the floorboard as a futile shock absorber
he heard the girl gasp with a frightened intake of breath that ended in a little sob
knox had been doing close to fifty
they were going through a section of the road that was bordered by a green woods on each side
directly ahead was a little crossroad that was concealed on both sides of the highway by the trees
a conscientious but inconsiderate state highway commissioner had placed a stop sign on the highway so that like in so many countryside counties the insignificant little crossroad traffic had the right of way out from this intersection was a disreputable touring car the driver taking his time as though unaware of the headon collision knox had his brakes down to the floor but the car shrieked as its impetus carried it skidding forward they were going to smash and it seemed nothing could prevent it
boyce heard frightened squeal he heard the whimper of the girl behind him
he couldnot close his eyes
dread of the inevitable crash looming in front kept them wide open staring
it enabled him to see the sudden expert maneuver by the other driver at the last split second
the man sent his car leaping ahead so that his left rear fender was torn away by left front fender
that apparently was the only damage done
knox managed to bring his car to a stop fifteen yards down the road
for a moment he was too frightened to move
boyce glanced back quickly to see if the girl was all right
her face was white but otherwise she appeared to be unhurt
better back up he said quietly to knox
the other fellow is getting out of his car
there was a strange expression on ken lean face an odd triumph was there and disappointment too
the disappointment registered plainly when he shot the girl another quick glance
knox backed the car and he and boyce got out
the man coming toward them was a brute of a fellow with barrel chest and long thick arms and legs
there was an ugly expression on his face as he towered over knox
look what you done squirt he said succinctly
tore the fender off my buggy
an you mighta killed me if i hadnot done some quick thinkin
your thinking was a little too quick wasnot it
boyce asked quietly
sort of as if you knew exactly what you were doing
the man whirled on boyce
you keep outa this
this little squirt damn near killed me
he busted up my car
i guess he must be blind or else he didnot pay no attention to that stop sign
knox was frightened but he made a commendable effort to draw himself up
listen mister
i been drivin this here road for forty never mind what you been doing
you wrecked my car an any courtll award me any damages i ask
got that
but be soft on you an take a hundred bucks an call it square
understand
knox suddenly put his hand in his pocket and drew out some bills give you fifty friend
and thats too darned much hundred squirt
or collect plenty in court and youll collect a sentence florid face went redder got a reputation to think of he said slowly a bank president
i donot want any scandal your hundred
now go away and okay squirt the man said taking the money
never mind the orders lucky to get off this easy
racket had walked over to car
he watched while the girl got shakily out of the car
she refused his proffered arm of assistance
she leaned against the car rubbing her forehead with her hand
my head she murmured my head
you were okay a minute ago boyce said callously
she glanced at him sharply for a moment there was panic in her eyes
then she began rubbing her head again happened to my head she said must have hit it against the front seat when we stopped so suddenly
it hurts
her voice trailed off in a bewildered dazed way your name
boyce said abruptly
he knew she answered spontaneously before she had any time to think
adelaide page
then she realized she had been trapped and she tried quickly to cover up
no
no thats not my real name
i use that sometimes on the stage
my names joan brown
why asked boyce sardonically do people always say brown or smith when theyre lying about their names
i guess its the first thing comes into their heads my name
she had been fumbling with her handbag
she took out a pencil and paper called to knox to come over
the little banker left his argument with the big man came over your name
adelaide page said
herbert knox
sorry if caused you let me see your license mr knox
eyeing her with a puzzled expression the little man took out his wallet
she copied the details of his license on her paper hear from methrough my lawyer mr knox she said
knox gaped at her
i donot see he stuttered
the girl boyce saw was making a desperate attempt to keep the fright out of her voice keep it slow and steady but it faltered a little
mr knox there is a sounded as though she were reciting again and hated to do is a law that makes the owner and driver of a car responsible for any person he is carrying with him
no matter who it is
if that passenger is in any way injured the driver is responsible and liable to a damage suit
i have hurt my head
how badly i donot know
but i am going to sue you for exactly one hundred thousand dollars spluttered knox it wasnot my fault
this man this nodded to the driver of the other be a witness to the fact that i was injured while you were taking his right of way and smashing his car
ken boyce looked at her
the entire setup was one of the neatest rackets he had ever heard of
this was what he had been expecting
she had knox dead to rights and the big man would be her witness
it was a racket that even ace daggert would be proud to work
and now boyce had it by the horns
he was glad of that
kelly would be glad and would give him back his job for breaking into this racket
he had knox for a witness
the only thing was the girl
somehow he detected a note of revulsion for her job in her attitude
she was going through with it because she had to
something was going to happen to her if she didnot
he reached in his pocket produced his wallet
okay adelaide all over with now
you made a nice attempt but it didnot work take that paper you have
it can be used as evidence
he showed her his open wallet
she looked at the card inside then up at him
terror had come into her eyes
for a moment he thought she was going to cry
you she whispered you are a right
special investigator for the consolidated insurance company been trying to break this racket of yours for a long time
but you and your bunch have been too clever
kelly my chief had just about given it up and consolidated has been forced to pay out to you for its clients because of lack of evidence
but i thought youd try it again and this time i hit the right spot had recoiled as his words lashed out in a low incisive tone
even as he spoke he could not believe that she was a part of the scheme of which he was accusing her
not with her face not with her eyes which were frightened and bewildered and seemed to look to him for help
but he made himself go on his voice still caustic
yeah miss adelaide page you and your bunch have a sweet racket or you had because going to bust it wide open and this time i have mr herbert knox to testify as my witness
he noticed that the girls eyes were darting across the road to where a wagon path disappeared into a thick clump of woods
he glanced at the path saw nothing but his hand went under his coat and deliberately he brought out his automatic
he saw that now the big man had moved close to them and the girl was looking at his scowling face with a mixture of panic and appeal in her glance
he held the colt in an apparently careless position at his side as he went on talking mr knox is just one of many of your victims
you adelaide as a pretty girl are used as bait
you walk along a road wait until an expensive car comes along and catch a ride
immediately you are in the car the driver becomes responsible and liable for your personal security a law the average man doesnot know exists
you as his passenger can collect any amount of damages you want providing you get a shyster lawyer to prove you were hurt
so one of your mob is planted down the road and at the opportune time he slightly smashes into the car youre in taking care he has the right of way
then you pull your stunt and you have your victim practically helpless
and consolidated has been paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars to their clients who have been the girls eyes had widened and were staring across at the wagon path
she gave a little gasp of fright started to move
for an instant eyes flicked to the path
he saw three men rushing out of the woods ugly shortsnouted revolvers in their hands
then his head rocked snapped back and he felt himself sprawling on his back his automatic skidding from his hand
the big man had waited for his chance and his huge fist had caught ken jaw during the split second interval the insurance investigator had glanced at the path
the man had grabbed hand was rushing her across the road to his rickety touring car
a gun had appeared in his hand and as ken scrambled for his own colt the big man threw a shot at him from over his shoulder
the lead splattered into the macadam at knees
he found his gun raised it was aiming at the man when a sudden fusillade of shots snapped and barked around him
the three men wefe firing as they ran for the touring car
get behind your car
boyce called to knox
the little banker stood in the open dazed his mouth sagging with fright
he did not seem to hear the special brittle command
he looked uncertainly from the big man who was dragging the girl into the disreputable car to the three who were charging across the road guns flaming as they ran automatic bucked his palm twice and one of the men pitched forward on his face
the other two succeeded in making it to the car which they stood behind and used as a barricade while their revolvers blasted lead across the open road
knox had miraculously escaped being hit so far but he stood in frozen fright unable to move while shots splattered his own car three feet behind him
ken boyce crouching behind the radiator saw that the little man was not going to run to cover
he edged along the fender suddenly leaped for knox
even as he reached him the banker cried out and slipped sideward to the road his mouth flecked with red two blackedged holes in his throat
he was dead by the time his loose body sprawled out on the macadam
a of rage escaped ken lips as the little man fell at his feet
knox had been an innocent bystander as well as sole witness
now he was dead victim of the racket
a bullet tore away the cloth under armpit as he leaped back to the safety of car
he heard the whir of the touring cars starter the roar of the engine as the big man jammed it into gear
the car spurted forward then stopped abruptly as boyce sent a bullet into the big mans head
he slumped over the wheel and boyce had a fleeting glimpse of the girl pushing him to one side
the cars unexpected movement had left the two gunmen in the open road unprotected by its tonneau automatic jetted flame and one of them spun forward on his chest his head lolling to one side
the investigators gun came up once more drew a bead on the remaining man
but ken boyce didnot fire
the man was hesitating his face turned toward the girl in the touring car listening
boyce saw that he was young with a mop of blond hair and a weak but handsome face
the girl was talking to him rapidly her face white body tensed as she crouched behind the steering wheel
suddenly the young fellow nodded to her threw down his revolver and started across the road toward the insurance investigator his hands in the air
ken boyce stood up his automatic raised
almost as though an uncanny sixth sense had aided his vision he suddenly was aware of three things happening simultaneously
the girl bent low over the wheel her foot frantically searching for the selfstarter the blond young man advancing unarmed across the road and back where the wagon path entered the woods a man appearing
thinking it a ruse to detract his attention boyce drew a bead on the blond fellows chest
hold it he shouted
stop there and keep your hands up
the youth kept on coming terror written across his pallid face
then suddenly there was blood on his mouth dripping over his lower lip and chin and he sank to his knees
boyce heard the hysterical scream of the girl as she straightened up from the wheel and saw the blond man drop
then he swiveled his gun to meet the figure standing at the mouth of the wagon path
he never saw the figure clearly
it became a blur that he could not distinguish from the trunks of the trees behind it
he was sinking crazily to his knees a hot pain at the side of his head where a bullet had ripped
his gun slipped to the macadam and he groped blindly for it laughing halfhysterically with pain as he noticed the suit he took such pride in was torn and dusty the expensive shoes that could be bought at only one store were scarred and creased where lead had flicked them
he had his gun inhis hand was trying to straighten up clear his head in order to find the figure of the man who had shot him
he got to his knees tried to push himself up with one hand then saw a mans feet planted squarely in front of him
too late he tried to jerk his head away from what he knew was coming
he felt the splitting thump of a revolver butt against the back of his head and after that there was no feeling at all
accused kelly chief of the consolidated insurance special investigators shook his black head vigorously his bleak blue eyes snapping
you had a chance to turn a trick that would have put you in solid with your job boyce he rapped
and you would have put all of us in solid with consolidated
none of us has been able to break that racket and here you have the chance and you let it slip through your fingers
no wonder i wonot give you your job back
ken boyce stood before his chief and rubbed his forehead with his hand
it was bandaged his face was bleak and tiredlooking his suit was torn and disheveled
look chief he muttered it took two bucks to ride back here on the bus only got eight left and thats every cent got in the world
you canot expect me to follow this case up with only eight bucks
give me my job back and an advance on my sal advance
kelly roared
listen you havenot got a job so you canot have an advance
how you going to follow up this case anyway
what have you got to go on
nothing
nothing but the fact that a guy named knox was found shot to death beside his car
sure there were bullet scars on his car and it looked like a gun battle but what can you prove
they found him dead and they found you alive
hell been just as satisfied if it had been the other way around
what chance did i have against five mugsall with gats spitting at me
i think i did pretty well considering five guys
five
there wasnot anybody there except you and knox
naturally
whoever it was clipped me on the head dumped the other stiffs into the car took the girl and drove away
all got to do is find the guy that clipped me and have the racket tied up in knots
because hes the big shot the guy behind the whole works bleak eyes went colder
his voice was thin with sarcasm
yeah all youve got to do is find the guy who clipped you
there are only seven million souls in this city so it wonot be too difficult for the great detective boyce to pick the right guy out of seven million
ken boyce bent over the desk
his tired eyes had a strange light in them
chief i know where to find that guy
i can find him
yeah you can find him
besides theres that girl
somehow i donot believe she fits in with that bunch of hoodlums
she sort of asked me for help in a silent way
oh she sort of asked you for help in a silent way
yes
and i believe i can help her
i can get to the bottom of the racket and that will help her
kelly stood up his blue eyes frosty
get out of here boyce crazy failed on this assignment just as you failed on the assignments i gave you to nab ace daggert through
get out
ken looked at his former chief for a long moment his cobalt eyes defiant
then he walked to the door of the office turned
okay chief he said
if thats how you want it thats how you want it was an odd confident smile on his firm going to be in for a surprise
a good one
you put up a big kick about daggert and you kicked about this insurance racket and not you nor any of your men could get to either got a hunch youll give me my job back and a bonus to spare when i come in with both daggert and this racket
get out of here boyce before you get me as goofy as you are
okay chief
okay
boyce didnot waste any time
he caught a fifth avenue bus and stayed on it until he reached fortysecond street
then he got off and walked midway down the block on fifth until he came to a fashionable shop with a sign over the small doorway essex boots for gentlemen he went in
one of the clerks in a cutaway hurried up to him smiled
how d you do mr boyce he murmured
something i can do for you nodded his eyes encompassing the smart glass cases decorated with ultraexpensive shoes of all models
yeah tell mr wilke like to see him
the clerk looked surprised and a trifle hurt
the manager mr boyce
is something unsatisfactory certain i will do my best
just tell mr wilke i want to see him
the clerk hurried away
in a few minutes mr wilke small and dapper appeared
something wrong mr boyce
or is it that you wish a specially constructed model
i hope you were pleased with those sports that you bought
ah i see you have them on and they look as though they had been through the wars
is it listen mr wilke
this is the only shop in town sells the kind of shoe i have on isnot it
mr wilke looked pained
the only shop in the country mr boyce
we are proud of the distinction
well look
can you gire me a list of the men who have bought this kind of shoes in the last month important
mr wilke studied his nails for a moment
then you are some sort of detective mr boyce
i will go so far as to disregard the rules of the store for that reason
if you will come with me ken boyce grinned
he thought of ace daggert and his reputation as a dresser
he thought of the feet he had glimpsed just before that gunbutt had descended on his head he remembered the shoes
those brogues were the same he remembered as his own
and he figured there was only one place in town where they could be bought
he smiled again and followed mr wilke into the adjoining had something less than eight dollars left when he came out of the subway at and walked over to west end avenue
he stopped in front of an imposing greystone facaded apartment house
down the street he could see a strip of riverside drive as it wended its way along the bank of the hudson
this was a section of wealth
only the rich could afford apartments in these buildings
boyce adjusted the gun in his shoulder holster taking care that the uniformed doorman did not see his action
then he went through the glass doors across the luxurious intimate lobby to the desk
the clerk was busy at the moment with a register book and boyce turned his back leaned against the desk and waited patiently
he straightened up stared for a split second with mingled surprise and pleasure as she came in then turned his face away quickly so she wouldnot see
it was adelaide page and the girl went straight for the elevators
boyce sauntered after her
sorry to keep you waiting sir the clerk called after him
may i help you no thanks boyce said out of the side of his mouth can find my way now
the girl was staring fixedly at her feet face taut eyes a little glazed with pain and what boyce thought might be sorrow
something in his throat tightened as he watched her
he didnot want to see her hurt this way she didnot deserve it
she was too good to look at something about her was too instinctively fine
she didnot belong in any kind of rotten racket
he felt a sudden impulse to tell her so to tell her he was trying to help her to take her in his arms and tell her not to worry
he looked away
the elevator door opened and she stepped in
boyce decided to get in with her and risk the chance of her recognizing him before she had led him to the apartment
unless he gave the nature of his business to the clerk at the desk he would never be given the apartment number
and adelaide appeared so despondent and preoccupied that he did not think she would even glance at him
she didnot
on the sixth floor she got out
he waited until she had walked part of the way down the redcarpeted corridor then followed her at a respectful distance oblivious of anything but the thoughts preying so despairingly on her mind the girl stopped in front of one of the mahogany doors extended her hand to the brass knocker
for a moment she hesitated as though trying to make up her mind or steel herself for an unpleasant ordeal
a look of grim determination flashed over her pale face and she reached resolutely for the knocker
wait
ken boyce said softly
wait adelaide go in there
let me talk to you first
she spun around frightened
as she recognized him her expression changed and hatred suddenly took the place of fear
the violet in her eyes seemed to grow black the nostrils of the delicate nose flared
her voice was virulent and husky with restrained rage
what do you want
what are you doing here killer
her abrupt vehemence caught boyce unawares donot he murmured
what are you you done enough the girl whispered hoarsely thought at first i could trust you
somehow i thought you stood for what is honorable and clean
but i donot see you turned out to be more of a a rat a coward than any of those animals i was with a coward and a killer shook his head donot understand what you mean
adelaide
but i do know that i want to help you
i wanted to yesterday
i want to now one of the reasons here
you must believe that
i can help you if youll let meif youll trust me
she looked at him intently her eyes softening a trifle
then they glinted again and her voice was hard
she said how can i trust a coward
a man who would mercilessly shoot down an unarmed manhardly more than a boy
adelaide
what do you mean
i didnot shoot down she moved closer to him her eyes flashing her breath coming sharply between her words
yes you did
the blond young man who talked to methe one i convinced to go to you and surrender because he was young and weak and because he wasnot bad but frightened
he did what i told him
he threw away his gun started across the road to you and youyou shot my brother without giving him a chance
all the emotion of her hatred seemed to ebb as the scene was recalled to her mind and suddenly she was crying sobbing softly as she swayed back against the wall of the corridor her hands covering her face her bosom rising and falling as the sobs caught in her throat
pain and bewilderment etched ken face
he moved close to her didnot know he was your brother adelaide
and i didnot shoot him
you know that
you must know it
it was someone elses bullet not mine
slowly she looked up at him her eyes wet hie catch still in her throat
but if you didnot shoot ted who who did
boyce took both her hands in his and pressed them going to find out he said softly believe the man who shot your brother was the man who came out of that wagon path when it was almost all over the same man who clipped me on the head the same man whom been trying to nab for a long time the man who owns this apartment daggert girl caught her breath sharply he wouldnot shoot ted
ted was working for him
ted was one of men
ace wouldnot shoot one of his own men
ace saw that you had convinced your brother to surrender to me
ace didnot want that
that would be living evidence against him
before hed let that happen he boyce broke off significantly
then he looked intently at the girl
you can trust me adelaide he said softly got to believe that in a jam as much as you are
if i donot get daggert i donot get my job back and that means i donot eat got to help me stick by me see us both through this mess
she nodded took out her handkerchief and dabbed her eyes trust you she whispered
for some reason i do trust you
adelaide why are you in with this racket
and why was your brother in itwith daggert
the girl held her taut throat as though to loosen it
because ted she said slowly was in a street brawl once
he was drunk he and another man fought
he beat the man badlyand the man died in a hospital later
my brother wasnot caught but one of men saw the fight
daggert used that to hold over head made him work all the society rackets for him
ted couldnot get away
but you
she closed her eyes then opened them and looked at him donot have anything to do with daggert
please believe that
the girl who was supposed to do my part in this insurance holdup could not show up
ace daggert forced ted under threat of exposing him to make me work as a substitute
you see ace likeshe thinks he see in love with you
yes
and you voice was tight
my brother was killed yesterday
there is no further reason for me to obey daggert
i was going in to tell him i was through when you saw me
ken boyce breathed easier
he turned and looked at the door
stick with me adelaide he said swiftly might need you to locate something in this apartment for he stopped abruptly as the door swung inward and a man came out
the man was abnormally thin abnormally tall
he was dressed in black had a brutally ascetic face long and thin with scraggy jaw
he carried a physicians black case with him
at sight of the man the girl drew back and uttered a sharp exclamation of surprise
doctor tolmanl bullet search physicians thick eyebrows went down in a frown as he recognized adelaide page
then a perfunctory smile asserted itself
how do you do miss page
coincidence meeting you here
just attending one of my patients
shall hurriedly he made a move to go back into the apartment and close the door
ken boyce grasped him roughly by the shoulder swung him into the hall
go on tolman
keep on going you arenot going back in there and warn anybody here
keep going
dr tolman glanced at the size of knotted fists muttered something under his breath then hurried down the hall and rang for the elevator
when the car appeared he got into it and boyce saw by the indicator that it didnot stop until it reached the first floor you know him he whispered to the girl his hand on the knob of the half closed door
he knew he would have to move fast now before the man with the physicians bag should get to a telephone the doctor who signed my brothers death certificate adelaide said her voice low
boyce frowned not all he is a quacka fake doctor
he lost his license a long time ago also a mortician how he makes his money a member of mob
but ted the girl cried left him at attend to that later got to take a look at ted
we have to go in here
keep your chin up and trust me
he took out his automatic gently kicked the door open and went in
the girl followed close behind him
the door opened into a small alcovelike hallway which was empty
they emerged into a large luxurious dining room also empty
three doors led off from the dining room
boyce contemplated them undecided
the girl indicated one of the doors the living room she whispered where hell most likely be
boyce nodded
he moved silently to the door turned the knob
the door swung inward and he went in with it
it was a living room done on an elaborate scale its modern chromium and enamel appointments blending in good taste with the multicolored books row upon row in the tall shelves that clung to the four walls
at one end of the room was a large flattopped desk and behind the desk were long windows draped with scarlet and silver variegated curtains
turn around ace boyce said
the telephone on the desk started ringing shrilly
and keep away from that phone too late to warn you
ace lean figure standing immobile before the window started then he swung around and scowled in surprise at boyce and the girl
his face was bony his eyes small and close together his dark hair coming down to a point on his low forehead
he resembled nothing so much as a scrawny powerful demon as he glared from the gun in ken hand to the pale resolute face of the gave one glance toward the phone then shrugged
it stopped ringing
finally a thin sardonic smile creased his lips and he nodded
hello boyce come to get you ace
this time its for keeps
get me for what
for killing a little guy by the name of herbert knox
for killing a boy named ted page smile remained set leathery
his voice was fiat with arrogance
still a sucker eh boyce he drawled
still chasing around trying to pin something on me
still the boy scout trying to make good and nab the bad man
why donot you wise up and stop this stuff made a fool out of you so many times getting fed up with it
ken eyes were hard his voice low and metallic
you were smart yesterday ace
you stepped out of that woods and shot ted page when the boy was going to come clean and spill the works to me
you shot little knox who would have been my witness
you packed those stiffs into a car and carried them here disposed of them some wayprobably as youve done beforeinto the river so that when theyre found if ever their own mothers wouldnot recognize them
yeah ace you did your usual thorough job
but you made one mistake
you didnot kill me
daggert shrugged his right hand slipping almost imperceptibly to the pocket in his dressing gown
small thanks i get he grinned get your thanksin the hot seat
keep your hand away from your pocket
daggert nodded easily and deliberately folded his arms
there was a slight accusing frown on his face as his eyes wavered to the girl
what are you doing with this insurance detective adelaide he asked no way to treat me honey keeping cheap company like that
the girls eyes were cold her voice huskier than ever through ace she said icily
through do you hear tolerated you
i even memorized those lines and played my part in that insurance holdup of yours
i had to or you would have harmed ted
but yesterday youyou killed my brother
shot him down in cold shut up honey small eyes were suddenly blazing
the vehemence of the girls attack had disconcerted him for the moment
who says i shot your brother
ken boyce saidhe told me that regained composure had put the girl off balance and she faltered
boyce immediately came to her rescue said it ace
and i can prove it
i want the gun you used to kill ted page
your bullets werenot found in herbert knox
they were slugs from the guns of some of your dead mobsters
but your bullet will be in ted body ace
and find it because youre in love with adelaide and you went soft and allowed her to place his body in doc mortuary in preparation for a decent burial
that slug along with your gun and evidence will be enough to electrocute you coming for your gun ace move your hands
i eyes were smoldering his shoulders heaving under his dressing gown
suddenly as boyce came toward him he smiled
listen boyce
if youre so sure i was in on this thing why donot you call the police
because if you used any of your usual snake tricks and squirmed out of this rap you could make it plenty hot for me for false accusations and arrest done it before getting the dope this time
and without that slug and the gun you havenot much of a case
you know that as well as i do not stupid
daggert laughed dryly amused and suddenly relieved
okay boy scout
take a gander at my gun
carefully boyce patted the mans figure
the gun in the pocket of the dressing gown was the only weapon daggert carried
boyce drew it out and looked at it
it was a pocket size caliber automatic
boyce studied it
somehow i donot think this is the gun ace he said too smart to carry the other one when its hot have a look around
for twenty minutes he searched through every conceivable hiding place in the apartment
daggert followed him the sardonic confident grin on his face
at last ken gave it up
you know of any place he might keep it adelaide he asked the girl safe somewhere
a secret place eyes fixed on face and there was a tense expression about his mouth
the girl considered for a moment then shook er no she said donot think so
daggert grinned again
on my desk is a box of the caliber bullets i use for my little cannon he said
you can take a look at those too boy scout if you think itll do you any good
boyce looked at him
daggert seemed too confident suddenly too sure of himself as though he had successfully pulled the wool over ken eyes and was reveling in the thought
boyce didnot like the setup but there seemed little he could do about it
he was stymied look at them ace he said
they went into the living room again
boyce picked up the box of cartridges
he emptied some of them out in his hand
then he reached over took a magnifying glass from the desk and held it in front of one of the bullets
striations of a slug often tell a lot he muttered
he put the glass back on the table
if youre all finished sherlock daggert sneered you can hand back my gun
and then get out tired of fooling with you
next time you meddle in my affairs i wonot be so easy on you put gun on the desk pointed his at the man just leave your gun here until you escort us to the door ace
safety first is a good motto
daggert turned on his leering smile shrugged and led them to the front door
boyce looked down at feet
little things lead to big things sometimes he murmured glad you wear the same shoe that i do it led me to you
maybe some other little thing will lead you to the chair ace
sorry to have troubled you get out of here adelaide arrogant grin vanished and a scowl appeared
he put his bony hand on the girls shoulder pulled her back tow ard him not going with you punk
clear out staying here you honey
he slipped his arm about her waist
the girls face was livid
she tried to push away
boyce looked at her
do you want to stay adelaide he said never want to see him again she cried
you heard that ace
get the hell out of here boy scout before i lose my temper
deliberately boyce holstered his gun
okay ace he said
then his left hand darted out grasped shoulder jerked him away from the girl
the special investigators right fist connected with jaw and the sharp powerful impact knocked the racketeer halfway across the room where his back smacked the dining table
he sank to the floor his breath wheezing between moans his hands coming up and covering his face
boyce and the girl hurried out and boyce rang for the elevator
not until he had hurried her into a cab did he speak the address of the mortuary where your brother was taken eleventh avenue and fiftyseventh she answered staring at him
he gave the driver the address looked out of the window behind as they headed across to upper broadway
we havenot got much of a start boyce said
daggert knows where were going and he knows where tolman headed straight when there was no answer to his phone call
i knew there was no danger of coming back himself too much of a coward for that
either he or some of his men will follow usprobably get there before i can find what i want
the girl leaned closer toward him her eyes soft as they looked into his hope she said that nothing happens to you
somehow i think youll win out
i want you to know that i trust you
his hand closed over hers hope he said wonot let you down
doctor mortuary was a dreary building of grey stone and had been converted from an oldfashioned mansion
it had a bleak morbid look about it
boyce paid off the driver and he and the girl went in through the open front door
dr tolman himself came from somewhere in the rear to meet them
his ascetic face was fixed in a thin smile as he greeted them
he showed no sign of surprise at their visit
you have come to take a last look at your dear brother no doubt he said to adelaide with the low monotonous tone of the professional sympathizer completely ignoring their former meeting as though it had never happened
listen tolman boyce rapped forget that stuff
daggert has probably already called you and told you to stall us off until he gets here or sends somebody for us
so get moving
he went up to tolman and whispered sharply into the lean mans ear expression was pained and shocked
really my good fellow
i canot do that
it isnot ethical and quit stalling heel boyce said
he turned to adelaide whispering because what i have to say isnot pleasant for you to hear think i know the girl murmured want the bullet fromfrom boyce nodded
he gave tolman a shove
get going before i start in the strongarm stuff
boyce was still capitalizing upon known cowardice
he knew what he was after but he had to work fast to get the necessary evidence
quick thinking moved into a dismal shaded room
on a heavy table reposed a casket
a prickle of natural distaste for things pertaining to death etched along ken neck and spine
he saw the face white and waxen of a youth lying in the casket
all right tolman he said do your stuff
i want the bullet from ted body
i know its still there
when you forged the death certificate pretty sure you did not take the trouble to remove the slug
he glanced at tolman when the tall man didnot answer
then he cursed and ducked instinctively
a short barrelchested man powerful of arm and leg with the hairy face of a gorilla and wearing an internes white coat was running for him at a crouch
the mans feet had made no sound on the carpeted floor
before boyce had time to move the man had dived at him the full weight of his compact animal body catapulting into the insurance investigators chest
boyce went down and hit the floor hard knocked breathless from the force of the tackle
the man squirmed over his body apelike his muscular arms flaying face with blows that rocked his senses
boyce fought back as best he could but he was no match for the strength of the gorillalike man who snarled bestially breathed heavily as he pounded
suddenly the man stopped using his fists his arms went around neck in a hug that had him choking from strangulation
red and black jagged spots flecked before the investigators eyes as his throat contracted and what little breath he pad left began to sear in his chest
he saw adelaide appear at the doorway heard her stifled scream as she took in the situation
he had a glimpse of tolman darting for her suddenly wrapping his long bony arms about her and dragging her into the room arms flailed the hairy face on the bullet head above him but his blows became weaker as the steel bands about his neck contracted and shut off every bit of air from his scorched lungs
things began to wobble crazily and then the room whirled around
with a last desperate convulsive wrench of his body he twisted and squirmed managed suddenly to roll over and throw the weight of the man off his chest
he felt the mans body jar as it came into violent contact with something solid
he heard the scraping of wood and there was a split second during which he knew something had moved above him and was going to hurl down upon him with devastating destruction for anything it crushed below it
it crashed into the bullet head that still hung tenaciously above his
it sent the wind from lungs with a whistling rush
he felt as though some giant monster had walked upon him
things went black for a moment then he was conscious again and aware of a terrific weight mashing him against the floor
with the weakened strength he possessed he managed to twist from underneath the weight
he staggered to his feet hauling out his gun and training it on tolman taking a quick glance at his feet as he did so
when he had thrown the interne with that last wrench of his body the man had crashed into the tenuous legs of the table broken one of thi and the casket it had supported had slid off and fallen onto the internes head
he lay under the big metal box twisted and still
let her go tolman
boyce clipped
tolman glared at him and released the girl
now get your scalpelor whatever you useand remove that bullet before i throw one into you
he followed tolman into the next room with its long white table and rows of glistening instruments
sullenly and deliberately tolman selected a small keenedged scalpel
they went back and tolman bent over the casket
the girl gave a sharp pained cry and turned her back
for sake boyce rasped you do that in the next room like you would an autopsy
i donot want adelaide to see canot
tolman sud1 denly shouted got to be here
then abruptly he resumed his suave urbane manner and added excuse me
what i mean is it wonot take a second
i can do it here
boyce nodded
there was something strange about that he thought
tolman was too concerned about performing the gruesome postmortem work without disturbing the body
but he said nothing waited until tolman finally straightened up extended his hand upon the palm of which lay a lead slug
boyce took it want a thick glass he said
any kind of heavy drinking glass
tolman went into the next room and boyce stood at the doorway
fill it with water he commanded
tolman did so and handed it to the investigator
boyce held the slug up against the light put the glass against it magnifying the striations in the lead
this slug came from a caliber revolver he muttered
the kind i have seen ace daggert carry
the gun ace showed me was not the gun he used to kill your brother adelaide
he held the glass against the bullet again and the girl looked at it with him
if i can only find the gun have evidence against ace daggert that will send him to the chair so quick show you the gun boy scout
and show you how that gun works
boyce swung around swore luridly
slowly he let his automatic drop to the floor and looked squarely into the small gleaming eyes of ace daggert
daggert grinned sourly held the gun in his hand on the insurance investigator
tolman take adelaide and hold her against the wall over there he rapped
but be sure you donot obstruct her view something going to happen that i want her to see
her boy friend is going to take a trip right before her eyes
and hes going to be sent on that trip by the same gun hes been wanting to find
how do vou like that boy scout
smiling he edged over to the casket
he bent slightly and his hand groped under the half closed lid of the casket
it came out holding a revolver a revolver that ken boyce instantly recognized as being a caliber type
boyce realized then why tolman had been so reluctant to take the lid off the casket or extract the bullet in the other room
daggert slowly pocketed his small automatic then deliberately moved close to ken boyce raising the revolver until it pointed at the investigators forehead going to make it easy on you sucker going to give it to you in the brain where it wonot hurt much
it canot hurt what you havenot got
if youd had any brains youd have kept your nose out of my business
but you had to monkey around till you found the gun i killed page with
now youve found it punk
and now youre going to get it from that same gun
the revolver stiffened in grasp his finger grew white as he pressed the trigger gently
the sardonic smile on his face had become fiendish hands slipped tensely to his sides his fingers grazing the outside of his pockets
suddenly the taut lines of his face relaxed and a slow deliberate grin broke over his face
a look of puzzlement and rage came over daggert
you think its funny do you he roared
it wonot be funny when save your breath ace boyce said calmly not going to harm me with that gun not going to are you crazy
boyce shook his head still smiling
the sweat on his forehead belied the coolness of his grin but daggert didnot notice
why do you think boyce said evenly that casket is on the floor
naturally you wouldnot be able to figure that eyes narrowed with suspicion his voice was hoarse
why
because like a boy scout i did my job thoroughly
i found the murder gun
you found of course
and thats why you are not going to shoot me with it sorry ace but that gun is empty
i emptied it ten minutes ago to confirm his words boyce reached in his pocket took out four bullets and tossed them contemptuously at feet
there are the slugs ace
the same kind that killed young page face went livid
for a moment he stared with insane rage at the calmly grinning face of ken boyce
then he cursed wildly and his hand fumbled in his pocket for his other gun was all boyce needed
he dropped to the floor retrieved his own automatic before hand came halfway out of his pocket gun lanced flame twice
lead streaked into ace knees
the racketeer screamed sank to the floor hands clutching his wounded knees
boyce whirled in time to see tolman making a desperate leap for the door
again his gun jetted fire and tolman jerked as though he had been stabbed jackknifed to the floor and also clutched at his knee while his voice shrilled hysterical shrieks
ken boyce walked over to the moaning 
daggert quietly stooped and picked up the racketeers revolver
he pocketed it little painful that knee business he said softly
but mighty effective
and youll live ace
you will be able to walk to the chair
he came over to the girl took her hand in his and squeezed it gently
you all right
her face was white and tired and frightened but her eyes were a little misty
she managed to nod
and you she murmured
he nodded smiled reassuringly
in the hall youll find a phone
better let the police in on this watch my friends in here
when she came back she had regained her composure
her voice was still husky but a trace of color had come back into her cheeks
when she asked did you get the chance to empty that gun
boyce smiled shook his head didnot empty it
it was just a bluff
and ace daggert wasnot used to bluffs
he fell for it
but the bullets you took from your pocket
they were just like the clue his shoes gave me
from them i found out where he lived
i told him little things often led to big things
the bullets i felt in my pocket gave me the idea of the bluff
and those bullets were the ones that ace himself gave me in his apartment
adelaide looked up at him her hand in his
the violet had come into her eyes again and a tremulous smile to her lips
everything is finished now isnot it she said quietly
he grinned drew her close to him
no not everything
first got to see kelly that boss of mine a few things to say to him
then for a long moment he looked at her squarely
there will be another thing to attend to
a very important thing
only i canot attend to that alone and a complete mystery novel by in next issue of wanted by the a nemesis lurks in the sweet scent of a rose
by avin johnston author of last bullet piped orders etc ordinary circumstances carter morris did not resemble the popular conception of a crook
known on the street as the head of morris and company reputable brokers his shock of white hair his hard lips and firm chin were generally construed to be the trademarks of an honest dealer in bonds and stocks
but just now crouched over the desk in his ornate westchester home carter morris did not in the least look the part of a respectable wall street broker
his white hair was ruffled there was a dampness on his forehead not brought about by the june weather
morris worked feverishly with the papers on the desk
there were bundles of securities pads of bank notes all of large denomination more money in loose piles
sixty thousand in cash
morris mumbled as he worked
an even hundred thousand in securities
i can cash them anywhere
get this matter straight and grab the first boat for europe sailing sound of a car brought him back to the window in a single leap morrow give me time
he rubbed a hand across his face
god he whispered got to get away before they find out about that texas oil deal
hundred and sixty thousand keep me for a time blow over
sure it will blow over
he was trying to bolster up the courage he had felt slipping away during the last hectic week during which time he worked over the books of his company endeavoring to falsify the accounts stave off the pending investigation he knew would shortly take place two of his investors demanded an accounting of their money placed in his keeping on that texas deal
morris cursed bitterly
thirty years on the street thrown over by one stupid move
like many others on the street morris and company had been hit hard
carter morris had seen a chance to make a cleanup recover some of his losses
it was on the shady side of the ledger but he had taken itand lost out
even now the was after those in on the texas dealand he was one of the principal fish
morris worked feverishly for another ten minutes stuffed the money and securities into a bag locked it thrust the key into his pocket rose and crossed to the window
visions of newspaper headlines flashed before his eyes
he saw them as if they were reality and not figments of his fevered brain reported moving spirit behind huge texas oil swindle morris breath choked him sweat made his hands and face clammy
in an effort to divert his mind from the subject he swept the lawns and gardens with a swift glance
everywhere was a riot of color
hundreds of rosebushes clustered around the lawn
roses he had trained and watched treated and experimented with
roses of every color under the sun crossstrains he had grown by himself
roses he lovedhis hobby
morris tore his gaze from their beauty and stumbled back into the room
as he reached the desk the sound of a car rolling across the gravel drive brought him back to the window in a single leap
it was a big car
it contained four men
four letters on the side door sent morris lurching against the window edge grasping the wood for support
the four letters were morris face lost its color
the district attorneys men he whispered the sound coming from between shaking lips
he whirled to the desk tossed the bag containing the cash and securities into a lower drawer lacked it
his eyes roved wildly around the room
the front doorbell chimed
the broker lurched again to the window and what he saw there sent his knees weak
one man from the car stood near the bottom of the steps
a second wandered around towards the rear of the house out of his sight a third bent over a rosebush apparently examining the beauty of the flowers
the fourth was not in sight
wade morris butler knocked on the door of the study entered
if he noted morris terrorstricken condition he made no sign gentleman to see you sir his dry voice said
says its important
morris choked before he replied
tell him to wait see him in a moment
wade withdrew
morris pounded the desk with clenched fists
caught
he mouthed the word
no use trying to get away
the man who had gone around to the back would block that exit
there was no other way out of the house except the front and back doors
the windows
no theyd spot him for sure one of them
bluff it out
he didnot have the nerve
he glared wildly around the room
a short barking laugh bubbled from his lips
there was one way will see you in a moment sir said wade to the man at the door
sure
just wanted to the words were cut short by a crackling shot from the study
both men plunged into the room
wade jerked back with a cry
carter morris sat at his desk his head on the blotter
a thin trickle of blood seeped from a hole in his right temple staining the blotter smoke floated from the gun clenched in his right hand
mr morris cried wade
the other man whistled
whew this looks like a case for the coroner
my business will have to wait from the department of agriculture
we wanted a few roots of that blue giant rose he developed recently
wanted them for the garden at the white house
but i guess thatll have to waitnow

oh hello miss kit slim darkhaired daughter
kit had parked their limousine
she joined them on the moonlit veranda of the big rambling four story maple grove home of dr george randolph who lay murdered in his laboratory on the second floor
it was two a placid summer evening
five people were in the house dugan said got em all here in the sittin room
if you discard the two guess you can all rightthen that leaves three men if it was an inside job
they passed a uniformed man at the front door and traversed a hallway
as they entered a brightly lighted living room it seemed that the two women there had no guilty knowledge of the tragedy
they were seated on a couch in a corner
mrs green the housekeeper a greyhaired motherly looking woman dressed in a wrapper was holding the hand of a young woman beside randolph twentyyearold daughter of the murdered physician
ruth was fully dressed but her dark hair was rumpled her eyes red from crying
so obvious was her shock at the loss of her father that dr feather impulsively held out his hand
my goodness really very sorry miss randolph
her tremulous smile held dignity
thank you she said
do wehave to answer many more questions dear me be as quick as can
two of the men had jumped from their chairs
both were young and wore dressing gowns over their pajamas and house slippers
this is dr john parker dugan said
dr assistant for the past two years
the young physician had been seated near the murdered mans daughter with a hand on her arm as though to comfort her
he was a slim pale delicatelooking fellow with sleek brown hair and a neat brown mustache
how do you do
dr feather he said
anything that we can do to help and this dugan said is mr secretary lee johnson been here about two years
johnson was a ruddy stocky fellow with a mop of curly hair
his smoothshaven face was flushed
he coughed nervously told sergeant dugan everything that happened he said
what i want to knoware we suspected of this thing by any chance
because if we are dr feather will ask the questions dugan said
dear me i just want to hear you people tell what happened dr feather said mildly
the facts were simple
dr randolph the murdered man had been a retired physician
he was a wealthy widower with a considerable property and a large correspondence so that he needed the services of a secretary
and two years ago dr randolph had engaged in secret research work and had hired dr parker as his assistant
there can be no secret about it now dr parker said earnestly
dr randolph was seeking a virus for the control of cancer tumorpathological abnormalities of cell reproduction
he was successful
dr feather asked
yes
we had a formula was it something that could get stolen
dugan demanded
the young assistant shook his head
no
merely a series of progressive experiments
the circumstances of the crime also were simple
at midnight dr randolph had been alone in his laboratory working with his microscope
dr parker whose bedroom was twenty feet away on the second floor had gone to bed and to sleep
so also had the secretary in his own bedroom about the same distance in the other direction along the hail guess the shot woke me up the secretary said lay a minute getting awake
then i went out into the hall
i saw dr parker come from his room correct the young physician said
the shot woke me
we met out in the hall
the laboratory door was closed
we rushed in and saw the murdered mans daughter gave a low cry
quite so dr feather said hastily
never mind the details
he stared at the two men his head tilted his mild eyes searching them
both were plainly nervous
dr parker was abnormally pale tensed as though his nerves were close to the breaking point
johnson was not only flushed but his eyes were abnormally bright
a dr feather turned from them to mrs green
where were you he asked the housekeeper
she looked frightened had gone to bedup on the fourth floor the west wing
i was took sick with the indigestion
miss ruth she went up with her about midnight ruth said hadnot undressed as you see
i sat with her you didnot hear the shot
dr feather asked donot think so
if we did hear it we must have thought it an automobile out in the street
then dr parker and mr johnson came rushing up told us her voice broke her eyes filled with tears
the third man seated across the room a big heavyset fellow of perhaps fifty had not spoken
he was wearing a pair of trousers with the tails of a flannel nightshirt tucked into them
he shifted nervously as dr feather looked at him
who are you
dr feather asked
william green the man said my wife
he gestured to the housekeeper been employed by dr randolph for ten years
and where were you when the shot was fired didnot hear it green said was asleep
my bedrooms on the fourth floor jus a little ways from my wifes
but dear me your wife was sick dr feather said
she was gettin better by half past twelve green declared
miss ruth was with her so they told me to go to bed
i wuz tiredgardening all day
first thing i heard everybody was poundin on my door shoutin that dr randolph was murdered
the silent little kit had been standing at the living room door unobtrusively her alert eyes missing nothing
abruptly she said think any such details down here father of course child
dr feather turned believe heard quite enough go upstairs sergeant
in the hall kit said those men hard to choose between them father even try to jump to conclusions kit
at the door of the murder room dr feather paused with kit beside him as they peered at the mute tragedy
the room was more a study than a laboratory a fairly large square room with a single window the door to the hall and one other small door which the sergeant said opened into a clothes closet
a library of technical books lined one wall
a small machine and fluroscopic apparatus stood in one corner
in another was a glass cabinet of surgical instruments
there were two upholstered reclining chairs several other chairs and one or two tables with electric table lamps and a litter of medical magazines
small oriental rugs were scattered on the floor single window was directly opposite the hall door the lower sash partly up
on the floor a few feet in front of the window lay the crumpled body of dr randolph a small thin man in his fifties
he was dressed in felt slippers trousers and a dark blue shirt open at the throat with his sleeves rolled partly up his forearms
a small chair was nearby
beside the body was an overturned small wooden table
the doctors microscope had crashed to the floor almost upon the body
shot in the back dugan was saying
dr claus who was here says the bullet entered just to the left of the spine went through the heart
dr feather and kit silently were peering down at the face of the dead man
abruptly they looked at each other
dear me sergeant you couldnot get an idea from which direction the bullet came
the window or the doorexactly opposite positions
no way to tell dugan said
but he must have spun as he fell knocked over that table and microscope
he gestured to the window
take a look a straight twentyfive feet to the ground but an active man could climb up theys rainpipes an ivy trellises
but dr feather and kit seemed not listening
they were kneeling over the body examining the bullet hole and the crimson stain on the dark shirt between the shoulder blades then peering intently at the dead face
dr feather carefully pulled an eyelid outward to expose more of the eyeball
then he was examining the dead mans scrawny throat was feeling the dead mans muscles been dead about an hour sergeant
hour an a quarter maybe
the shot came about one am they all agree on that
queer that he should have been strangled kit dr feather murmured
very queer father
sergeant jaw dropped
strangled bruise on the throat dr feather said
see it here
dr claus mentioned that the sergeant declared
like when he fell maybe the microscope might have hit him
dr feather smiled faintly
that or fingers squeezing his windpipe a hand violently over his mouth
my goodness when youve seen as many such contusions as i have kit child take a look around the room will you
the sergeant said blood was scattered dugan gestured
some over there on the floor miss kit
a little dried smear two or three of em around like somethin dripped blood
and yet the shot caused instant death dr feather said
in fact the wound seems to have bled a little less than normal rather than a low exclamation from kit interrupted him
the girl was still kneeling over the body she had lifted the loose half rolledup shirt sleeve
on the flesh of the left forearm just below the elbow was a small scratch hardly more than an abrasion which had drawn only a small amount of blood quickly drying
dr feather stared
well kit dilated pupils father
locked muscles
i was sure wed find of course child
but the blood around the room is more puzzling
let me think
dugan was across the room bending down to the floor midway between the hall door and the clothes closet some of the blood miss kit
it was a small smear as though a few drops had fallen
carefully kit examined it
then like a little hound she was searching the floor drop here on the rug father
it was close to the body
then she found one nearer the clothes closet door
dr feather was examining the microscope and the glass microscope slide which lay by the instrument
he was using his oil immersion lens sergeant the highest powered combination across the room by the clothes closet door kit suddenly exclaimed smear of blood here partly under the door father
the door must have been open
little dr feather leaped to his feet touch that closet kit
keep away
what the devil now
dugan gasped
dr feather confronted him his cheeks flushed his mild blue eyes flashing
my goodness the answer certainly lies right here somewhere
microscopic evidence
kit well need a lot of apparatus from the car
yes father have to make the analyses kit sergeant clothes closet
did you go in there just poked my flashlight in
i told you i left everything for you
just opened the door a little
but what dear me thats excellent sergeant
good luck indeed
the door was closed when you got here
yes
say listen dr feather what are you please donot question me when questioning you sergeant
my goodness thats annoying
how big iq flip small
just a few feet
clothes hangin on racks shoes on the floor
good
bring those three men suspects up here
i can think of a lot of things to ask them now
my goodness i certainly can
a lot of queer business went on here
kit hurry down to the car child
get our exhaust pump for that air
bring your paraffin outfit the big microscope all the apparatus for analysesand bring the haemocytometer
yes father have quite a bit of work kit
i want to make paraffin casts
if i can determine which one fired the shot that would clear everything up father
and the simple medical examinations of course child got this murderer
dear me sergeant donot stand gawping at us like that
bring up those men suspects
kit had hurried from the room to get the apparatus from their big limousine which was in effect a traveling laboratory
she came back in a few minutes erecting her apparatus in an unoccupied bedroom across the hall
dugan meanwhile had brought up the three grim frightened men
dr feather had been standing motionless in the center of the room pondering
as the men appeared he hopped to confront them
ah here you are
what i want to knowwhich one of you fired the shot the abrupt question startled them so that each gave a low exclamation staring at each other
stand aside sergeant dr feather ordered
his manner was amazingly different now crisp menacing
one of you is a murderer
which one
murderer the pallid dr parker echoed accusing us
lee johnson demanded
one of you dr feather said
but what happened in this room tonight is anything but simple
which one of you fired the fatal shot sergeant dugan jumped at them
come clean
which one
he swung on lee johnson
you maybe havenot fired a gun in five years johnson protested
nor dr parker declared
there wuz no weapon in the house that i ever heard of the stalwart gardener said
my girl kit has a few little tests she wants to make dr feather said crisply
you three men wonot mind of course
come here kit like to make them in the room over there kit said they followed into the opposite bedroom with dr feather and the awed dugan watching from the doorway
it was to dugan and the three suspects certainly a strange series of tests to which the deft girl now put them
quickly she took their blood pressure their temperature then with a sterile needle stabbed the lobe of their ears and with a stethoscope listened to their hearts and respiration
quite a physician young dr parker sneered didnot know this was a medical case know a lot more when dr feather gets through with you dugan commented have the wax ready kit said quietly
shall i make the casts now father
no do it
you get that sample of air
all right father
but if he opened the closet door very wide then probably try it anyhow kit
just corroborating evidence
my goodness well certainly have plenty of evidence
yes father
with a belllike exhaust pump in her hand the girl hurried across the hall to the murder room
closet young dr parker murmured
but no one answered him
on a bureau of the bedroom kit had erected a small alcohol lamp over which in a retort paraffin was heating just want to apply it to your hands for a few minutes dr feather said
hold out both hands pleaseyes all three of you
quickly he coated the six hands with the paraffin an eighth of an inch thick encasing the backs of the hands and all of each thumb and forefinger leave it on about ten minutes he said
father
come here please
from across the hallway kit was excitedly calling
you three sit still dr feather warned
hold your hands motionless or youll break the mold
what is it child
in the closet father i found this in an old shoe
she spoke softly as she held out a small triangular fragment of broken glass
dr feather gasped
why dear me
easy out careful father
he hid it there quite evidently
and blood dropped on the floor in there quite a lot of blood
and the air child
deficiency of oxygen father surplus of carbon dioxide quite obvious even without a test
he must have been shut up in there at least five minutes or more instinctive to open a door only a little when you slip out furtively and quickly
the air didnot get altered much when he left
quite so child
well weve got every link now havenot we
take your microscope in there and complete everything
yes father
the three men were grimly seated waiting their hands held motionless donot know what this is all about green muttered
nor anyone else i guess lee johnson retorted believe thats long enough dr feather said
your perspiring hands will have loosened the paraffin and cleansed the pores
carefully he peeled off the casings
then with a little brush dipped in a chemical he began swabbing the interior of the paraffin casts
this is a solution of diphenylamine and sulphuric acid he informed
watch what it does
there were six casts
on five of them it did nothing
but the interior of the sixth in a moment was dotted with blue spots
microscopic bits of gun powder dr feather said into the tense silence blowback from the firing chamber of the gun driven into the pores of the skin
they couldnot be washed be seen even microscopically
but the perspiration brought them out onto the paraffin the chemical made them visible and my goodness there they are
lee johnson and green were staring at dr parker the young physician gasped numbly
you fired that shot dr feather said
dear me youve got to admit it now got you
dugan exclaimed triumphantly be damned dr feather that was quick work
the sergeant was jingling handcuffs but little dr feather pushed him away
not so fast sergeant
does every test have to try to prove a man guilty
my goodness this was just the opposite
this was to prove one of them innocent lucky dr parker
amazement spread over face yes i did shoot him he mumbled
but it was an swear it was
i thought he was a burglar there at the window
i shot too quickly
i swear i didnot mean to kill him
you didnot dr feather said gently
you thought you did but you didnot
tell us exactly what happened to you
parker had been sleeping restlessly he said
his room was hot and he had opened his hall door
then he heard a dim crash
he had bought a revolver about a week before had said nothing about it because he had no license
when he heard the noise he had seized the revolver rushed out into the hall
he heard the laboratory door open as though someone were coming out someone who heard him and ducked back in again knew it wouldnot be dr randolph he said rushed on thinking only of a burglar lucky dr feather commented drily not the kind of man to own a revolver more courage than wits the doctor had recklessly plunged to the laboratory doorway
the room was dark
at the window hed seen a blob of figure crouching at the sill had impulsively fired dashed forward seized the blob
dr randolph had tumbled at his feet dying
the horrified parker had stood a moment gazing at the bullet wound in his employers back
as though it were a viper he had flung the revolver far out the window then he had fled terrified back to his room
a murderer
who would ever believe it was accidental
he even had a motive for murder
he was engaged to ruth randolph
her inheritance would make her rich now
and parker himself had sole possession of dr medical discovery which had great commercial possibilities
well dugan said when the dazed dr parker finished a grand yarn
when you said nobodyd believe it you hit the nail square
but it happens to be true dr feather said
my goodness it fits the facts
it has to be true
kit stood again in the doorway just about finished father all the data
dr feather scanned the cards of her penciled notations
thanks kit
not much argument is there
no father
dr eyes were flashing as he faced lee johnson the secretary and green the gardener
we had three suspects he said
now weve got two
you donot have to say anything
my goodness not trying to trap you into a confession
i can tell you now pretty exactly what happened
my girl kit and weve seen so many murdered menthis ones dilated pupils his locked rigid on page on the a complete novelette of criminal espionage by author of merry christmas killer the man in the window etc i peter case was not well
his mind was filled with the nervous confusion that is born of an aching restlessness
there was nothing he could do about it except wait for something to happen
it was suspense he did not like because he had no way of telling what was going to happen
the storm was liable to break at any minute
it might come from any quarter
and when it came the foreboding that was now deep within him promised it would be a deluge of the worst sort of trouble
he paced the lanai terrace burning up one cigarette after another and looking each minute or so out past the shining sands of waikiki beach at the dark water and the lights of the ships that crawled along the horizon and disappeared past the looming shadow of diamond head
peter case pressed he had two ideas concerning the possible origin of the trouble to comethe submarine which had left pearl harbor by nowand the disappearance of gladys benton wife of the skipper
but that disappearance should not be bothering him
as the captain had said it was probably due to an impulsive notion of her own that ocean depths conceal a fiendish plot the trigger of the automatic prompted her to go to one of the other islands for a vacation
since benton was not worried there was no real reason for peter case of naval intelligence to be concerned
in the first place even if the worst had happened even if she had been abducted or murdered her plight would not be brought to his official attention
but peter case was thinking of one angle which would mean that her disappearance might have a lot to do with the business for which he had come to honolulu
foreign spies in the city were as thick as flies and it was possible that the wife of a naval officer would be valuable tc them
particularly if she happened to be the wife of the skipper in the battery room of a submarine for the spies were all here for the same reasonafter the invention the carried with her tonight the same invention peter case was commissioned to buy for the united states the moment it was tried and approved
he lifted his binoculars and looked again out to sea
isimo he snapped suddenly isimo
here she comes
case was a giant and his straight strapping figure was silhouetted by the light from the room that adjoined the terrace
he wore a white mess jacket and blue broadcloth trousers
he was blond his high cheekboned face definitely nordic
he looked both youthful and handsome though in a hardened way for his face was like fine leather
hurry isimo he said still peering through the glasses
the terrace door opened and a small filipino garbed in navy whites came rushing out gibbering my goodness
she come so queek sir
case handed him the glasses
peek for yourself general who by his own statement commanded troops in the far reaches of the philippine islands long before the temptation of a steady salary as a mess boy in the american navy intervened in his questionably brilliant career had been allowed to accompany peter case when he was taken from active naval service and put in the intelligence
isimo was to be mess boy personal valet and servant but he had served in that capacity only a few months when he graduated from all that by blandly announcing that he would be henceforth a ganteelmans ganteelman
he was looking through the binoculars now
brave general isimo is glad he ees not on sad vessel eyes flickered
why he demanded
no like number no like idea
like shore side and palm trees
he handed back the glasses and returned to the room leaving case not a little uncomfortaole for the boy had an uncanny ability for predicting disaster in a subtle way
case too had a feeling that all might not go right with the he looked again toward the deathladen little submarine cruising serenely through the spash of moonlight
suddenly a grim foreboding gripped him
he felt as though he wanted to shout to it order it back to port
he kept watching as the shadows swallowed the dim little running lights and he was conscious that sweat trickled down his face
the was on an experimental cruise
within her bulkheads was the first completed model of a perfect sounding instrument
it was the product of an inventor who lay dying in the queens hospital of spinal paralysis and if it worked the united states wanted it badly
but if the trial proved to be a failure it was quite possible that the would be destroyed with all lives aboard
the permanent value of a sounding machine had long been a subject for naval discussion
all were agreed that an effective instrument of this kind would be a leading factor in winning or losing a war at sea
in recent years various types of sounding machines had been invented
none of them had gained complete success
the type of machine that peter case was commissioned to inspect and which had been installed in the had the broadest sound range of any in the world
use of this equipment made it possible for a submarine lying either on the surface or bottom of the sea to pick up the sound of every vessel cruising within a radius of a hundred miles
using this information as a basis it would be possible to determine with fair accuracy the approximate size of the cruising vessels and their course
in the event of war the value of a machine that could supply such information was obvious
a submarine so equipped would be able to inform the battle fleet of the exact position and definite approach of the enemy ships would make it possible to catch such ships by surprise or would permit minelayers to place deep water mines in the path of enemy craft causing them to be blown to bits when they crossed these uncharted minefields
vaguely peter case heard the tinkle of the phone from inside but the clapping of palm fronds and the strumming of guitars on waikiki beach below him carried the sound away in the warm breeze
a moment later however general isimo appeared at the door
come queek he said missy gladys benton missing wife of captain on the phone
case moved quickly forward hours gladys benton had been waiting to be left alone for a moment and now that moment had come
she had struggled with the ropes that bound her until they were loose
and now with the man who had been guarding her out of the room for an instant she had to make use of her jerked the ropes from her aching body and stood up
for a moment the blood rushed from her head and she was so weak that she thought she would faint
strands of black hair hung about her livid white face she brushed them back and moved toward the window
freedom
it would be a brief freedom and it would end in death
this she knew and yet she was unafraid
if she had known fear before her captors had beaten it out of her so that now but a single flame bright and hot burned in her soul
the flame of vengeance
her dress ripped to the hip as she climbed onto the window sill
she stared into the night and then down at the ground below her
in a moment she had let herself fall and now she as on that ground and getting to her feet
she could feel her heart pounding pounding
she must hurry
even now the was under way with her husband bill benton in command
poor bill
she ran stumbled across the ground a fever beating white hot in her mind
god bless you bill she kept thinking god bless you and damn me
my rotten betrayal my filthy schemes and intrigue were not big enough to touch you
she was sobbing now
the night breeze whined across the cliff that was the pali and the leaves of a thousand trees rustled like the laughter of gods
somewhere over the top of this mound and down through the woods there must be a house where there would be a phone
that was all she wanted a phone
she must find it before they discovered her escape before they could find her and kill her
to be caught now that she had gotten away from them would mean certain death
before if she had remained their captive there might have been a chance of living
she might have been sent back to the foreign country in whose employ she had originally been when she married bill benton to spy on him
you are a traitor her chief agent had charged
no she had answered evenly am a woman and in all the wars of the world in all the suffering and bloodshed and shame through which men like you have tried to use women there has never yet been found a way to rob them of their souls
i didnot promise that would be a party to blasting into bits a submarine filled with living men
nor could i possibly know when i married him that bill benton would be the man he is and that i would fall in love with him
our nation is not interested in your emotions the agent had snapped if the invention on the thirteen explodes the united states will not exercise the option to purchase it
then we yes i know then weyouyour country could have it
but the price you are asking the price of mens lives in a time of peace is too great
it had gone on like that for hours
they wanted to know what she had told benton
she hadnot told him anything and she wished now that she had but they had kidnaped her sensing in some uncanny way that she was ready to reveal their whole rotten plot to him
so bill benton knew nothing
the lights of a house flickered yellow through the night
sucking breath into her lungs she stumbled toward it
she reached it and pounded on the door
a gaunt hawaiian answered and she hysterically demanded the use of the telephone
the stupefied native pointed the instrument out to her
and a few moments later she was talking to peter case
murder on deck in the conning tower of the somehow did not like the silky smoothness of the night sea nor the moon that was so white too white
he had been skipper of the for a long time so that he sensed when something was wrong
he felt that something was wrong now something more than the natural apprehension of the experimental dive they were coming out here to make
bill benton was a stocky man he had sloping shoulders and short firm arms
he was young and extremely sincere about everything he undertook
his eyes were black wideset and his lips thin
he had full ruddy cheeks and his skin had been bronzed by the sun
he glanced now at stacy standing alongside of him
stacy a junior lieutenant was his executive officer who had been aboard only a few months
he looked at bradshaw the tall slim quartermaster now at the steering lever
there was someone aboard who didnot belong though bill benton did not know whether either one of these two knew that or not
this feeling about the sub was not one that had come to him suddenly it had been coming for days
during those days he had been careful to observe almost everything that took place
at least he had tried and he was beginning to realize that one or more men who were either spies or were being bribed by foreign agents were in the complement of the new volunteer crew
he leaned back now his thoughts coming slowly
the swish of water along the ships side slithered above the deep hum of the diesel engines below
the steady breeze was rattling the driedout canvas of the signal bags
at last benton said take over stacy going below
yes sir
shall i leave the deck hatches open
might as well benton grunted admit theres not much air to be pulled below but at the same time theres no chance of water spilling over the deck so long as the sea remains like this
he climbed down through the conning tower hatch reaching the bottom in the square center operating controls room
he rubbed his feet on the greasy deck and glanced around him
the radioman was in his glassenclosed shack and a sailor was sitting on a ditty box on one side of the room jotting down some notes
other than that the room was empty and the shiny steel of the walls the cross bars of the periscope and the heavy throbthrobthrob of the diesel engines oppressed him
he headed toward the door leading into the forward battery and as he walked he felt the sub sway gently from side to side and he heard the swishheavier nowagainst the hull as the boat pushed through the calm water
he stopped at the tiny officers wardroom which was separated from the rest of the forward battery by strips of canvas and looked inside
mari mason was sitting alone at the oak table a cup of hot coffee in front of her
hello he said his voice a little thick and the hot oilladen air catching in his throat mind if i join you
as a matter of fact lieutenant she said was just going to request that you do
there is much we must talk over before the dive
he entered and sat down
there may not be a dive he said
she looked at him incredulously
mari mason was the daughter and only real assistant that fred mason the inventor of the new type sounding machine ever had
her hair was rich with golden yellow contrasting with the fine color of her skin the deep green of her eyes
she was slim and although she looked very young she was the type of a girl who at a glance one would call competent
what do you meanthere may not be a dive she asked black eyes had a soft gleam and his thin lips parted in a half grin
perhaps i donot mean exactly that he replied ringing for a mess boy but i think rather i feel certain that there is someone aboard who doesnot belong here
and that means trouble
do you know this persons identity believe i do
but there may be more than one
at least i shall arrest one man presently and then i will feel safer about the dive
the filipino boy arrived took the order for coffee and disappeared
when he returned with the steaming liquid benton and mari mason sat in silence staring at one another
at length benton shrugged donot mean to alarm you it may not be anything at all
she leaned forward her lovely face tense her green eyes flickering
do you think anyone could have heard what you said she whispered
bill benton shook his head
again there was silence for one came to regard the throbbing of the diesels as part of the elements
like time and space they seemed to go on forever
the sub kept rocking gently rocking and water swished along the hull didnot speak loud enough for anyone but you to hear
i had thought of that
she nodded but did not look as though she were convinced
she drew in her breath and coughed it out
at last she got to her feet
is it all right if i go up on deck
i am supposed to get the pitch and roll an hour prior to the divethough i donot suppose there is much pitch and roll now
besides i want to get a breath of air and smoke a cigarette donot blame you
bill benton grinned and rose
the air seems pretty putrid down here until you get used to it go up with you
they left the wardroom together going forward
mari mason wore blue slacks and a slipover sweater
a green band held her hair close to her head
she ducked through the watertight door and into the torpedo room
bill benton followed his eyes on the grimfaced sailors who sat about playing an old battered phonograph
beyond them stood the four gleaming doors of the torpedo tubes and the sleek greasy fish themselves were lashed to the bulkheads
in this compartment you could see how the hull of the boat curved like a bloated cigar
the sailors were sitting on bunks on ditty boxes
over the incessant pounding throbbing beat of the diesels the music screeched from the phonograph st louis woman with a diamond ring
mari mason grasped the iron rungs of the ladder and began to climb
some of the sailors watched others paid no attention they were too tense the mission of the boat too grim to notice much of anything right then
as the girl climbed through the manhole hatch and out onto the deck bill benton his officers cap cocked back on his head climbed the ladder and followed her
it was quiet on deck a quiet away from the diesels with only the bubbling swish of the water and the soft hum of the wind as it slid past the looming hulk of the grey conning tower
mari mason lit a cigarette a nice night she said
bill benton shivered involuntarily
he had been about to add a nice night for murder but somehow he didnot
he glanced up at the bridge the red and green running lights flickering the figures of stacy and bradshaw
at last his gaze returned to the girl who was facing forward now
as for pitch and roll he said weakly you were right
and as for the fresh air she replied over her shoulder delicious
the night was beautiful and for a moment neither of them spoke
the kept sliding onward through the water and neither bill benton nor mari mason saw the slim figure that darted across the after part of the deck to the side of the conning tower
back to the tower the figure crept quietly around the side of it
for a moment that was eternity he waited
then noiselessly he unsheathed a knife and gripped it in his hand
he moved forward stealthily raised the knife then he struck
the blade sliced squarely between bill shoulder blades
jerking the weapon out the killer hurriedly raced back for the engine room hatch
he flung the knife over the side and disappeared below deck
mari mason turned to speak to the skipper
she looked quickly around and then suddenly she saw his huddled form on the deck
she screamed
death on the pali said into the phone but where are you mrs benton where can i reach you
it doesnot matter about me she said kill me before you can possibly arrive
and i deserve no more than that
what you must do is get to that submarine
their peril is far greater than my own
yes case said can stop the boat but they are coming now she said thickly can hear them
tell the police it was on the pali
they shall perhaps find me here
but as for you for sake see that the line suddenly went dead
peter case was up strapping an automatic about his waist putting on a leather jacket
general isimo followed him to the door
case turned
phone wailupe
tell them i have ordered the immediate return of the to pearl harbor
under no circumstances are they to dive
double check said isimo but where you going
for a social call to the pali case clipped going to call on some spies
general isimo was wideeyed call police double queek
maybe need some help in call huh
but the intelligence ace had left
a few minutes later he was roaring up the road to the pali
a cottage loomed in the glare of his headlights
two figures lay sprawled in front of it
case swung in at the side of the road his brakes squealing
he leaped from the car drawing his but he had no need for it
a tall hawaiian lay halfway down the porch steps his head battered and bloody and his body already stiff
on the ground near him lay gladys benton the front of her dress crimson and her black hair disheveled
her face was very white her lips a smear of crimson
her eyes were still open and case saw them blink
he holstered his gun and bent over her
she was not quite dead and she stared at him through glazed eyes
a chill ran through his body as he looked down at her
he felt himself trembling all of a sudden
he did not know what to say speech seemed so useless in these ebbing moments
he felt unaccountably embarrassed as though he should not be here watching a beautiful woman die
he took her into his arms and he felt her blood on his hands warm and sticky
her lips were quivering now and he leaned close to catch her whisper
bubbles of blood flecked from her mouth
the spies areshackhere she sucked in breath and case felt somehow that it would be her last
her voice became huskier so the terrible machine of murder that is war grinds on with neither pity nor mercy with a ruthlessness that she was choking her voice coming like short sobs from deep in her throat face was flushed and his heart was beating very fast
he could hear the wind on the pali and the rattle of leaves have been such a fool peter case she went on at last such a selfish shortsighted little but her voice stopped there and case saw her eyes close they were like the eyes of a child who is very sleepy
her muscles relaxed and when he bent down he could not feel her breath
he took her wrist and felt it grow cold in his own warm grasp
in a moment he was able to get to his feet
he was too stunned to think coherently
over and over he heard her voice and the whining of the wind and the rustle of banyans and he knew that he was walking in the direction of the shack she had pointed out
he knew that his gun was in his hand again and that something cold ached in his chest
he saw the shack from the top of a hill
figures moved about inside
one of them came out carrying a bag
it seemed to weigh him down
there were three men altogether
he gripped the service a little tighter
he did not know how he was going to accomplish the capture of these men but strangely enough it did not seem to matter
a government agent isnot paid to think of his own life
he started forward
he had gone scarcely four steps when a thompson machinegun loomed from an open window of the shack
brrrrrrrrrt the first spasm of the gun case was no longer a man
he was a cold and grim fighting machine of the naval intelligence
he was on his stomach crawling across the ground
the tommygun bullets screamed over his head
it was as though hell had broken loose
he lifted the automatic rolled back
the gun belched with flame and the man with the machinegun dropped it
there was a bullet in his head
case saw that as the spy gunner slipped down beneath the window sill out of sight
but the machinegun had been silenced less than a second when the other two spies both outside now sent shots screaming into the darkness where case lay
the shadows were allies
in the light of the house he could see the other two men quite plainly crawling rolling across the ground sucking breath into his great lungs holding the automatic tight in his sweaty hand he moved inexorably closer to them
he opened fire again
three solid blasts
the man with the suitcase whirled about wounded
the impact of the bullet sent him to the ground whare he at once struggled to regain his feet
the other spy looked around wildly
then there was a crashing of twigs behind case and the roar of police guns
case got to his feet and rafted forward
the spy who had not beer wounded was running in a straight line back through the trees
case stood and triggered the remaining shots in his gun at him
then he whirled in time to kick a weapon out of the hand of the man he had wounded
he jerked the spy to his feet
dirty pup he breathed
it was the first he had spoken since getting out of the car
the police arrived five huge hawaiians
case jerked his head in the direction the last spy had escaped
see if you can get him of the hawaiians raced off through the trees
the other two stayed to handcuff the man case had wounded and to drag the corpse of the machinegunner from the shack
case was looking at the suitcase undoubtedly filled with a lot of photographs and maps the government will be interested in he said keep it in a safe place for me
the detective captain nodded
will do case
god what a mess you ran into up here eyes flickered a little grimly and then he saw general isimo running toward the shack
meester case
meester case he squealed
so happy to see you vertical slant not horizontal
have bad news
much work
what is it
the little filipino was breathing hard
called wailupe as you said
but they can get no rise from the radio
it had not occurred to case that he might not be able to radio the and order her return to safety
now a new and more horrible fear gripped him
he and isimo would have to fly out to the sub at once
come on he said thickly
they returned to the car
case headed it down the pali and toward the air island at pearl harbor minutes later the motor of their boeing sputtered caught on and roared
case eased back the stick geared the trim seaplane forward
it skimmed rapidly across the dark water and as it leaped gracefully into the air general isimo in the navigators seat held on with both hands
his oily black hair waving in the wind he screeched out his excitement
sucking the cool night air into his lungs case hand on the stick led the ship nose up toward the stars
it lifted in a slant like a child hurrying up a flight of steps
they reached the mouth of pearl harbor in no time and looking over the side case saw the beam of the lighthouse
his feet worked on the tail assembly steerage and he guided the craft in a heavy bank to the left
motor pounding hard then propeller whirling he opened up
they swept over aloha tower in a minute or two and winged swiftly out over the dark sea
since the radio was dead on the ship there was naturally no way of being sure of its exact position
but peter case knew the course they had planned to take and he now checked his own gyro and set bearings to follow it
according to his own calculations the submarine would by now be nearing roads off the picturesque island of maui
nearing the position he had expected them to be peter case at length brought the boeing on a slant toward the water
they lost altitude rapidly and he could hear the loose flipping of the guy wires the rattle of a piece of canvas somewhere near the undercarriage
he adjusted the goggles he had borrowed and looked down over the side
the sea was black and empty
bringing the plane down to where he was no more than a hundred feet above the water he skimmed along at ninety miles an hour watching on every side of him and directly below for the missing submarine
before he realized it he had completely passed the island of maui
cold terror or perhaps it was a foreboding of terror gripped him suddenly
thick lips tight he brought the plane about dropped even closer to the water and started back
he covered the same route he had flown before in almost no time and by now his concern had greatly grown
he was about to lift the wings of the boeing and turn about again when he spotted red and green running lights on the horizon of the sea ahead of him
and as he saw it he realized why the submarine had not been where he had thought it would be
it had turned about and started back toward pearl harbor
that might mean there was more wrong on board than a temporarily silenced radio
he eased the boeing gently to the water skimmed rapidly over the top of it once the pontoons had bumped down
taxiing up alongside he signaled the bridge by means of blinker code with a flashlight then cut the motor
almost at once sailors appeared on deck climbing up through the torpedo tube and after battery hatches
hoist the plane aboard peter case called
he climbed out across the wing and leaped to the sloping side of the feet planted on the hull he pulled himself to the deck
general isimo leaped immediately afterward
he caught with one hand and squealed until two of the sailors helped him aboard
his shoes were soaking wet
shoes go on expense bill he chanted unhappily ruined in line of duty
attempt at escape the sailors rigged a small deck crane peter case went to the torpedo room hatch and climbed below
the torpedo room was empty
the battered phonograph was grinding at the end of a record making no sound except a shrill scratching
general isimo descended the ladder like a monkey
case went in through the forward battery to the small wardroom
he glanced inside drew back then stared
lieutenant bloody corpse lay on one of the lower bunks
while he looked at this stacy came through the he was captain of the craft now and had climbed down from the conning tower
mari mason followed on his heels blue slacks sweeping across the greasy deck
her face was very white
peter case looked around and his nordic face was set who did it he asked thickly donot know said stacy
he was short had red hair and grey eyes looked as though he had just come out of the academy
although he must have been nearly thirty his face was very boyish
it happened on deck mari mason said was there when it happened
bill benton had been talking of arresting some man whom he said did not belong on board
for a moment peter case said nothing then he declared your killer probably credited benton with more knowledge concerning his identity than the lieutenant really had
general isimo shifted nervously from one wet foot to the other next words were sharp
he addressed the juniorlieutenant and you were going in right stacy said
how was the radio silenced
someone slugged the radioman and smashed it
nothing very subtle about this business i must say youthful face looked strained
with the killer still on board peter case said acidly you were going in to port where he would have a chance to get ashore and escape
stacy shrugged
well i didnot know what else we should do sir
case said sharply regulations state that when a crime occurs at sea the intelligence should be notv fled at once and when that is impossible every attempt should be made to solve the crime before coming to port
as he spoke case felt the intensity of the atmosphere as though high voltage wires were strung taut and to the breaking point
everywhere in the face of every man there seemed to be death expressions that were bleak or resigned or of fear
the men had volunteered to take a chance on the sub but none had bargained for murder and all hated its presence
the red haired juniorlieutenant looked up
you going to remain at sea until until the murder is solved case said slowly eyes burned curiously
under the circumstances sir i should say that such a plan was dangerous
we have that invention aboard you know
there are spies on board case replied
if we touch port theyll have the chance of escaping in which case their ring would still exist imperiling the entire navy
but they might kill more of us
they might you are quite right
peter eyes flickered grimly
we are all in grave danger stacy but as i have told you there is more behind this than murder
we must risk our lives because these spies must be captured see sir stacy murmured softly
and for a moment there was only silence punctuated by the heavy of the diesel engines
then the sailors evidently having finished their jobs lashing the plane aboard the phonograph in the torpedo room was going
low toned voices sounded everywhere
the pigboat rocked gently back and forth water rushing along the sides
mari mason spoke softly
then there will be no dive to test the sounding machine donot know case replied canot tell yet
we have been promised that if we do go through with it the ship will be exploded
yet he may be the very method we shall have to employ to catch the killer
stacy protested good lord man
in that case case halted him with a motion
during a dive he snapped there is absolute silence
every man is supposed to be at his station
an irregular movement by any sailor will throw suspicion upon him
after all the ship canot be blown up by someone merely wishing it
action must be applied and yes but if they should succeed
case shrugged
it is our business to see that they donot
lieutenant stacy was shaken
he turned and went back into the case turned to the girl
sorry you have to be here miss mason
my boy can fly you ashore if must be here for the trial of the invention she replied blue eyes were warm admire your spirit he said softly
at that moment the buzzer of the ships phone sounded in the wardroom
case stepped inside the small room picked the instrument up
yes
someone is trying to get away with the plane a tense voice said going to try and stop him
better get the men on deck and the voice stopped and peter case turned raced through the forward battery into the torpedo room and up the ladder
sailors gaped after him
he reached the deck to find that the boeing had been secured aft
in the dim light of the moon he could see two figures struggling
lieutenant stacy in the conning tower was shouting down at the fighters leaped forward swept around the blunt hulk of the tower but even as he did so he saw one of the figures near the plane a tall slim oneslump down in a heap
the other figure vanished into the nearby after battery hatch
the ropes securing the plane had been slashed and the boeing swayed precariously toward the subs side
leaping over the figure on deck case careened around the plane and leaped into the manhole hatch of the after battery
he crashed with a deafening thud on the steel plates of the deck below
a sailor whose bunk was over the galley table stirred
the ships cook in dungarees and an apron had been sitting at the table reading he looked up
another sailor was at the door of the a machinists mate stuck in his head from the engine room
ankles smarting case pulled himself to his feet stared at the group of faces about him
where did he go
who asked the cook
case groaned
the man who came down just a second before i did
the sailors looked at one another didnot even notice him said the cook was reading
the fellows go up and down that ladder all the time
they go up on topside to smoke was asleep the man in the bunk added
and i didnot see anybody said the machinist
peter case looked at the chunky unshaven sailor who stood near the door of the nordic countenance was a tight mask of disgust
what about you he demanded
the unshaven man shrugged just came in he said slowly
his piggish eyes gleamed with amusement
why looking for somebody sir
for a murderer peter case replied
the heavy pounding of the diesels throbbed into his ear drums the hot air from the engine room caught in his throat and choked him
his heart had started to beat a little faster and he felt as though his skin was burning
the sailors appeared to be dumbstruck at what he had said and no one opened his mouth for a long time
throb throbthrob pounded the diesels
peter case looked the men over carefully for some moments then he said one or all of you is lying
before very long going to find out who it is
and when i do its going to be a long and sad story ft seems rather incredible in spite of the fact that the diesels make so much noise that a man could come down that ladder without being seen or heard
he turned to the cook who was skinny and had morbid black eyes your name
page sir the cook answered
case looked at the chunky unshaven sailor
your nameand rate
martin sir a torpedoman first class glanced at the bunk
the sailor there was lean medium sized
he had a heavy jaw dark eyes and short clipped hair
my name is lambert sir he said am also a torpedoman
second class
do you usually sleep in your dungarees lambert
case asked
well going on watch pretty quickly due to go on at twelve and was just getting a cats nap see case grunted turning to the machinists mate who was huge
he had black hair and his face and hands were covered with grease
you
my name is ryan sir
page martin lambert and ryan peter case said aloud
he paused looked from one to the other framing leading questions by which he could trap the guilty one so tightly that it would be impossible to lie out of it
but suddenly with his thoughts came another idea
it hit him all of a sudden and hit him hard
it seemed to write a key to the solution of the identity of the mystery killer
if it worked he would have the murderer redhanded
it meant also that instead of just one spy being aboard there were at least two
case felt that at least one of these was among the four present torpedoman lambert machinist ryan cook page and torpedoman martin
the knowledge made him tingle with excitement
he turned and climbed the ladder to the deck of the craft
he could see part of maui on the horizon the palms tall and straight the dust of stars carpeted behind them
mari mason and some of the sailors were grouped around the still figure that lay near the plane
a flashlight was turned down on the face
bradshaw someone said he was the quartermaster on watch in the conning tower when he saw the figure cutting the plane loose from the temporary stays
case glanced at the small iron boom to which the sailors had raised the boeing and strapped it
bradshaw is dead said someone else
he was a cottonhaired young ensign whom peter had not seen before
secure all hatches spoke up
this is so unfortunate mr case
so much of this happening you think we should go in postpone the trial of the invention until later sure my father had no idea this experimental cruise would be such a gruesome one sure he didnot either peter case said softly but as for going in afraid i must be contrary
what we are going to do is dive
dive echoed the ensign getting to his feet
the sailors looked up as though someone had lashed a whip across their faces
case nodded and then seeing a flash of white down the deck called isimo
general isimo
the little filipino came on the run
yes sir
general isimo ganteelmans ganteelman awaits command sir going to put the boeing back over the side case said and youre going to take it back to pearl harbor
he saw disappointment flicker on the brown face and added hurriedly think you can fly it all right
general isimo can fly anything he answered quickly adding sir
case himself had taught isimo a lot of things during their spare time in washington but knowing the pride in these accomplishments he had appealed to his vanity
in another few minutes the sailors were lowering the ship over the side and into the water
the had come to a stop
the boeing had been raised from the water in the same way that a lifeboat on a larger vessel is taken up over the side
the sailors hauled the lines through the pulleys and then when the ship was in place strapped it to the deck with stays
now it was lowered back down the sailors easing off on the lines until the pontoons rested in the gently rolling water
one man held the plane off with a boat hook so it wouldnot scrape against the side of the submarine while general isimo scrambled down the sloping side of the like a brown monkey
his feet sloshed into the water
for a moment it looked as though he would plunge in and he screeched
but in the next moment he had leaped caught the wing which dipped with his weight and crawled across it and into the cockpit
case waved at him
if i donot see you again he said grinning you can have my tuxedo
without a pause isimo shouted back it would be a feeting theeng for them to bury me in
case smiled as he always did at the boys sentiment about him
in the next instant the motor of the plane roared
isimo waved then taxied smoothly down the water gradually lifting the wings into the air
case walked forward with mari mason
he nodded toward the conning tower ladder
she climbed up it into the bridge and he followed
stacy looked at them expect to be ready to dive in a few minutes case told him
first i want mari to show me the lay out of the invention below deck
i will signal you from the wardroom when we are ready to go under
yes sir the reddiaired skipper snapped but donot you think its inadvisable to the dive case said is a net in which hope to bag two killers
as for its advisability take that responsibility on my own shoulders
that would be wonderful stacy said acidly if we all were killed
what good would didnot ask for an opinion mr stacy here to take orders
mari mason climbed through the round hatchway down into the and case followed her
color was beginning to come back into her face as though she had suddenly begun to believe in him
she showed him the invention and briefly explained the main points
while they were talking the cottonhaired young ensign walked through the compartment headed aft to his station on the engines his name
case asked
ted bronson she told him
they went on discussing the invention and he told her his plan
she was very excited about it though he thought he could detect a trace of doubt in her face
finally they made a complete tour of the vessel from the torpedo room to the battery room think were ready case said tried to smile he gripped her hand
they went into the wardroom
they looked toward the two corpses as though sealing a silent oath
the sub rocked gently in the calm of the sea and the air was hot
case could hear the faint sound of the phonograph from the torpedo room st louis woman with a diamond ring
he looked at mari
well here goes he said
she touched his hand looked up into his eyes her fingers tightened over his
okay skipper she assented
he talked into the phone to the bridge
a moment later the word was passed that electrified the crew
secure all hatches
man your stations for diving
quickly and silently the sailors went to their stations in various parts of the ship
mari mason left the wardroom
though a woman her sweater slacks and the green band about her yellow hair somehow made her look quite equal to the job of looking after her fathers interest concerning the sounding instruments
peter case followed her into the where already the ten sailors assigned to thisthe most vital position on board during a divewere taking their places near the controls
it is hot below decks hotter in a tropic sea and most of the men in spite of mari presence were garbed as they usually were during a dive dungaree trousers white skivie shirts some of them wore handkerchiefs about their necks to sponge the sweat that rolled from them
peter case could not help but notice the tenseness in the atmosphere the grim hardened looks on the white faces as they prepared for thisperhaps the last dive
they seemed resigned fatalistically so
yet one could not help but notice the etched lines in their countenances the traces of fear in the muscles of their cheeks the occasional slight quiver of lips
lieutenant stacy crawled down through the conning tower tube bolting the last hatch after him
for a moment he stood in the middle of the deck his hat cocked back showing his red hair his grey eyes hot
he looked at the smashed radio through the glassenclosed door and at last glancing not at case nor mari mason went to the periscope
he grasped the cross bars and sat down
almost at once the huge pounding diesels went off went silent
it was almost as though a thundering river had instantly frozen over
the sudden quiet was ominous portentous
it brought reality to half numbed minds
the batteries were on now the batteries which operated the ship when it was under water
stacy leaned forward and as he spoke gave the orders to the men talked into the voice tube to bronson in the battery room his voice seemed to come from deep in his throat as though something was clogged there and was muffling his words
diving planes he said
as he spoke and the men responded automatically to the command great iron planes like wings unfolded from the side of the pigboat so that as it went under it was not unlike a giant fish with straight and sturdy fins that guided its course under the water
peter case looked around him
he observed the men their sweating faces their eyes in which death seemed to dwell
the sub nosed down its blunt little bow wallowing into the waves under them and gradually the whole black and grey hull slid from sight until only the thin pipeline of the periscope remained above water cutting through the surface with the slithering hiss of a serpent
at that moment when the submarine was completely encased in the limpid water a chill seemed to freeze the air blowing from nowhere through the compartments like the damp breath of death
peter case shivered involuntarily and began to sweat
he looked at the glistening steel bulkheads oozing now with beads of perspiration and steam water dripping dripping down the sides and rolling in rivulets to the deck
it was as though the pressure of the sea were closing in about them as though the ocean would crush the sides and sweep into the square compartment of the coc mari mason stood near case not moving watching with wide green eyes
her face appeared more calm than any of the countenances of the sailors her eyes brighter and less afraid
she would not try the invention until they were on the bottom
ease her now stacy said slant thirty degrees for the bottom and he leaned forward pressing his eye to the rubber about the periscope eye his arms about the heavy cross bars
on the bottom still deeper the dove rocking back and forth as it made its way rocking like a cradle of death the water laving against the iron bulkheads a loud swishing that told case what was outside
the bloated cigar form of the boat sank deeper through the murk of undersea fish swam away from it around it eyes goggling seaweed swept aside
an octopus and a shark hurried away from the path of the great iron monster
no one spoke except stacy giving his orders and now peter case kept watching the men and waiting
he unholstered the automatic and then gripped it in his hand
the sailors looked at it looked up into his face
their eyes were flickering crazily
so the worst was expected
their stare seemed to say that and in all the cold the damp heavy air that froze them sweat came more profusely
bottom was reached at last the boat thudded gently into the mud and at once stacy put the ship in reverse
with the aft end high it brought them ort of it and now his voice growing gradually more quiet stacy straightened the vessel to an even keel
not even the periscope was above the surface now
they were completely under
stacy leaned back wiped sweat from his face
well
mari mason moved forward her lovely face composed her green eyes on stacy will put the sounding machine in motion she said
the sub kept rocking on the bottom water kept oozing down the sides of th glistening walls the sailors stood tensely dungaree trousers white skivie shirts wet with sweat
wait a minute said peter case want an accounting of the men in the torpedo room
stacy stared then he spoke into the voice tube called out the names one by one
his voice echoed hollowly from the empty bulkheads
all right case said when he was through all right mari
set the sounding machine in motion
pick up all craft within range and prepare your report for the board of officers in pearl harbor
this is your first real experiment on this machine make it a good one
she grinned though there was no humor on her face
okay skipper
stacy looked up thinking he had been addressed
but she had spoken to peter case
she moved toward a panel in which the operating mechanism for the device had been installed
case not watching her now walked to the door of the after battery
at just that momentthe moment mari mason turned on the sounding machinethe overhead lights flickered grew dim
case looked about
the sailors seemed rigid hand was to her mouth and she had turned pale eyes were wide
then the lights plunged out
the ship was in total darkness
an hysterical scream broke from the lips of one of the younger sailors
oh for the love of god get us out of here be killed
get us out
although peter case had not expected the lights to go out the fact that they did did not change his course of action
it complicated it and made it more dangerous
standing at the after battery door the automatic gripped in his hand he snapped every man remain at his station
you too mari
you too stacy move until you hear from me
yet in spite of his sharp words there seemed to be a minor bedlam
the sailors were muttering there

continued from page was the shuffle of feet and all of it all of the sound was intensified by the silence of the boat
the sub kept rocking and the water on the outside of the hull brushed against it
case did not wait
turning he groped into the after battery past the sailors on the huge electrical control panels
give me a flashlight somebody
he went farther and someone pressed a flashlight into his hand
peter case turned it on
he saw the galley stove over in one corner the bleached white table and the bunk that was high above it directly over the table
he saw the coffee urn and the white faces of the sailors in the battery
a then he left the room went through the door to the engine room compartment
on both sides of him were the huge silent diesel engines and peter case walked the catrunway the strip of steel that lay between them
the beam of his light penetrated feebly through the darkness down to the end of the engine room where lay the closed watertight door leading to the battery room
the battery room was the farthest compartment aft
enginemen and machinists mates stared at peter case blond giant nordic face set tight flashlight in one hand gun in the other he swept forward
the submarine kept rocking rocking on the bottom of the sea
now there was the deep hum of the mason sounding machine which in war times would make a submarine almost a hundred percent more effective by giving them the exact position of all vessels within a radius of over a hundred miles
by this tokenif the invention were a successsubmarine craft would be promoted to a far more important place in the defensive and offensive fighting fleets
case reached the door of the battery room
it was dogged shut with wrenches
as quietly as possible he turned them loose pulled the wrenches from their places so that the door would open
he had to holster the gun while he did it and he worked there for several minutes
then gripping the gun again and snapping off the flashlight he shoved the door open stepped inside the battery room and slammed the door shut behind him
for a moment he stood leaning back against it the gun tight in his hand
it was so dark that he could see nothing nor did he hear anything
he was waiting for some sound
at last it came a deep voice
who is it
peter case did not answer and at that moment a wrench slugged into the iron door just over his head
he ducked to one side crouched back against the bulkhead kept waiting
the submarine rocked back and forth
at last case flipped on the flashlight sent it rolling across the deck
red flashed hideously and shots followed it
the roar in the small compartment was almost earshattering
peter case pressed the trigger of the automatic fired at the figure he had seen shadowed behind the red flare of gunfire
wham
wham
he heard a groan a cursing but the cursing broke off in a throaty scream
a figure hurtled forward landed on him
peter case rose with the man still clinging to him
hands gripped at his neck and case using jiu jitsu to break the grip did it easily by placing his own arms between those that clutched at his throat
he swept his arms outward and the fingers lost their grip the clinging figure dropped to the deck
peter case slashed his gun down the blow missed and he felt the man holding his legs
words came from the grapplers lips
shoot him now
shoot high
but as the gun of the second man opened up peter case had swept aside landed on the deck and was trying to crawl back to where the man with the gun was crouched
the other kept clinging to legs and now clawing tried to climb up on him
a wrench lashed out
peter case felt blood trickle down the side of his head but the blow had been a glancing one
viciously now he grabbed the shoulder of the man who had hit at him
he caught the second blow as it descended wrested the wrench away
it clattered to the deck and hand still on the shoulder so that he knew in which direction to hitbrought the butt of his gun down mercilessly
he felt it crack on the skull felt the warm blood that trickled through his fingers
the mans grip suddenly loosened and peter case kicked him away kicked him to the center of the deck
the man was out but there still remained another adversary
this one had not ventured forward but lay back holding a gun and waiting for a chance to use it
for a moment there was silence and a ruse suggested itself to case
he would try to imitate the voice of the man with whom he had been fighting and whom he had just slugged unconscious
if he did not succeed he would be inviting gunfire and possible death
but if he were whispered thickly got him all right
fix that cord on the lights
the explosion must have come off
we have nothing to worry about
the answer came after a moments hesitation john
yes case whispered
you say fix the lights for the whole ship
sure
but we we didnot hear the explosion
we wouldnot back here case snapped
again there was silence and then movement
gun gripped in his hand peter case was crouched
what happened came so rapidly that he had no opportunity to use it
two shots roared out thudded into his body
he went limp
blackness screened his conscious thoughts and then very slowly began to clear leaving a horrible debris of pain so intense he felt he would cry out

continued from page when he gazed slowly upward his eyes feverish able only to gather half of his thoughts a hazy vision swayed over him
the lights had been turned on
the cottonhaired ensign ted bronson stood over him a weapon gripped in his hand waited until i heard you say enough to know you werenot lambert he whispered and to determine your exact position so that my shots wouldnot miss this time
it was a clever trick case trying to make me think you were my partner but it is perhaps the last trick you will ever use dying now case but not even going to wait for that going to put a bullet through your rotten head
the words seemed to be a soft patter that fell about him like rain drops on paper
he was not able to hear all bronson said
he knew only that the ensign was desperate if not hysterical knew that he was capable of murder and more
he saw torpedoman had been in the upper bunk of the after battery when peter had last seen himlying nearby unconscious and splattered like himself with bright blood
and then though he did not know how he did it he struggled to get to his feet
it was more the power of a strong mind than physical strength for his strength was ebbing like water running from a punctured cardboard cup
ensign ted bronson seeing his feeble effort laughed harshly and lifted case
he shoved him back up against the bulkhead
case watched through glazed eyes and he felt sweat bathing his hard face
he saw bronson the cotton hair the wild gleam in his eyes
he saw the gun bronson held
and in face he saw death
killers mind might have told him farewell peter case death is here with you on the bottom of the sea but his heart told him that even in death he must triumph
he must point out to bronson that even if he a single and unimportant cog in the great crimefighting machinery that is called the naval intelligence was killed victory had been snatched from him
he began talking in whisper at first your spy ring numbered five he said one was killed and one was captured ashore the wounded lambert there is the third
you bronson are the fourth
only the fifth man remains free for the present
a poor showing for five men who were commissioned to see that the united states did not buy the sounding machine
bronson rocked back on his heels and wiped his mouth
he seemed fascinated and case could see that the death of one of his companions ashore and the capture of another was news to him
bronson seemed to become more nervous
he twisted the gun up in his hand
yes but success or not case he said think youll have to tell the rest of your story in hell
because your plans to explode the case went on dramatically you want to know why they didnot work tell you case hurried on and there was a deathless smile on his painwracked face
the explosion which was meant to wreck that one compartment could not be effected until the boat dove
but ahead of myself
earlier you became aware that lieutenant bill benton was suspicious of you and was about to make an arrest
so you killed him
there was a strange light in eyes
his hand gripped the gun tighter
what if i did
that doesnot answer the question of why coming to that case said and he managed to straighten up now
you wanted to engineer the explosion from back here so you would not be harmed
the only victims would be the men in and near the you and lambert lead a wire from the invention into thisthe battery room
you also had lambert lead a wire in from the electrical controls so you could plunge out the lights simplify your problem by working under cover of darkness
when lambert was through with his portion of the job you no longer needed him about
you might have planned to murder him claiming that you caught him returning from the battery room thus establishing a culprit and giving yourself something

continued from page of an alibi
you didnot count on my coming aboard tried to break in but case had no intention of giving him even a temporary advantage
when i crossed you up you might have covered yourself by having lambert escape through a torpedo tube or the emergency crash lock
that would lead naval intelligence to believe that the killer of bill benton had gotten away leaving you the remaining spy aboard free of suspicion and in a position to continue negotiations for the desired plans
you could blame the explosion on a deficiency in the invention
yes but where your plans began going wrong case said hoarsely because lambert was unable to release the plane quickly enough
when bradshaw tried to catch him he had to kill bradshaw and escape into the after battery
when i arrived in that battery a scant moment after he did no one had seen him although several men were present
i admit that at first i was puzzled
then it was plain what he had done
he had swung from the ladder that led down into the compartment right into the upper bunk
that was the only way he could come through the hatch without the others seeing him
bronson was becoming impatient
his eyes seethed fair deduction case but case felt the submarine swing back and forth felt the water pressing in against the sides
mari mason and he continued found the line you had strung to the invention and with which you intended to explode it from aft here
as i say you could blame the invention for the explosion you and lambert would have been saved with the others who remained alive without anyone knowing your identities get it bronson said from deep in his throat and before the sub dove you cut the lines making explosion impossible
but you didnot know we had a line to the lights so they went out all right
in that case there has been no case nodded grimly
no
there has been no explosion
i knew that since lambert was not in the torpedo room he was here to escape the effects of the explosion
you two were able to join this crew with faked service records and transfer papers such as spies have used in the past
suddenly voice slowed and stopped
eyes wide with horror he saw that bronson had found the break in the wire to the invention and was piecing it together again
there was no explosion eh
no explosion case saw a vision of the result
the blowing up
mari mason and the others being killed
the boat lurching crazily on the bottom of the sea fumes escaping everywhere
he saw someone in the dark trying to blow the ballasts to bring them to the surface
these things he saw in his mind
for the moment he did not consider himself in danger because he knew that the doublehull of the would probably prevent any break in the outer wall of the craft itself
the delicate mechanism in the control room would be damaged but unless bronson planned to die a martyr to the cause he must have arranged his own escape
while he cudgeled his mind for this explanation he was inching forward
bronson looked up at him leering at his weakness considering his puny efforts as impotent unimportant
think trapped too
bronson gritted
case said nothing concentrating his efforts on preserving his strength for one final hopeless attack
this submarine has been equipped for other experiments besides that of the sounding device bronson reminded him
we have the new emergency control rooms that work the ballast tanks
the mechanism is right behind that door
a step and i can start the to the surface
we are only resting in about thirty fathoms of water
case halted half in surprise and half in horror
the cyclorama of destruction still left figments of the bloody picture in his semiconscious mind
the ends of those wires assumed a gargantuan size like the twin horns of a mighty sea devil
he knew what would happen if bronson succeeded in what he was now doing
the fury of his inflamed brain gave him the power to move forward
bleeding his face strained he plunged down at the spy
bronson whirled about snarling the gun in his hand
it shrieked with a shot that whirled a fraction of an inch from head
then case was throttling the spy even as he felt bronson crumple beneath him even as he felt his fingers on the ensigns throat blackness and pain surged into his mind so that he did not know whether he could go through with his job whether his consciousness would remain long enough
his was blind and insane fury without reason but coupled with crushing action head crashed on the steel deck he choked out struggled
case was still on top of him only a shred of consciousness left in him
but that shred was like a stick of dynamite
peter case next opened his eyes he was in the naval hospital in pearl harbor
there were two people present one on either side of his bed each holding one of his hands
he looked up into the radiant face of mari mason
the invention is a success she whispered
case smiled then too he looked at the person on the left
general brown face was wreathed in smiles but tears ran down his cheeks

within a minute or two randolph died
in that minute the murderer held him from screaming beginnin to see it dugan murmured
that scratch you showed us on his arm signs of fingers at his throat quite so sergeant
while the swift poison was killing dr randolph the murderer kept him silent
then when he was unconscious i would say that the murderer dragged him and hung him over the window sill
the murderers idea evidently was to make it look like an randolph scratching himself with a broken microscope slide on which he had a deadly poison
and it would have looked as though dying he had crawled to the window gasping for air
dear me that would have looked reasonable
the murderer maybe would have placed the poisoned bit of glass on the floor or in the dead mans hand
but things went wrong for this murderer
in his haste he knocked over the microscope

continued from page derer heard someone coming
he lad no time to escape so he ducked into the clothes closet
there was a little trail of blood leading there so we knew it could only have been made with the door open
we know by findings of the closet air that he stayed in there quite a time
that was while dr parker fired into the dying man discovered his horrible error and rushed away
then the murderer slipped furtively out of the closet
he didnot disturb its air much
kit found in the closet traces of the micrococcus catarrhalis and streptococcus donot understand any of this the burly gardener muttered
dear me probably not
dr feather smiled
those are common germs
anyway you can understand that while he was in the closet the murderer got rid of his damning murder weaponthe poisoned fragment of glass
he hid it in a shoe
into the stricken silence as dr feather momentarily paused
dugan murmured but who is he
how can conclusive test sergeant
this murderer was bleeding
in his panicstricken haste as he ran around the room his blood was dropping
there was quite a bit of it in the clothes closet
my girl kit got a perfect sample
dr voice was edged now with grim menace
these three men have blood that is very different
kit took a few drops from the earlobes of each and made a blood count
yours dr parker as you no doubt know is deficient in the number of erythocytes red corpuscles
the pigment the haemoglobin of them also is deficient in redness
you are anemic
that was apparent just looking at your pallor
but otherwise you are in good health
dr grim gaze turned to the burly flushed gardener
you green youre in perfect health so far as your blood shows
red and in white corpuscles both normal
and you johnson the flushed secretary was half out of his chair
me going to tell me your blood is red enough dr feather said
but it happens you have a temporary ailment a pretty well established bronchial catarrh
a mean sort of bronchitis and the white corpuscles in your blood have increased in number to fight the infection
traces of the germs from you were in the air of the closet
and wholly conclusive the blood from your ear matches with mathematical perfection the blood scattered around the murder room
the terrified secretary had leaped to his feet
he made an impulsive move to dart past dugan but the alert little kit barred him
and then dugan seized him
so he did it
dr parker exclaimed tell you why dr feather been gambling and drawing unauthorized checks on dr account
he runs the checkbook pays the bills
dr randolph only goes over the account very infrequently
but the bank got suspicious of the unusual drafts and bills didnot get paid
dr randolph told me that in confidence
he had given johnson until tomorrow to make good
but johnson thought it was all just between him and randolph
