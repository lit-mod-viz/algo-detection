May Volume Number A Thomas Clareson, editor Department of English, The College of Wooster Wooster, Ohio The Newsletter of the Conference on Science-Fiction of the is published twice a year in the Department of English at The College of Wooster* All correspondence should be addressed to the editor. With this issue we complete five years of publication, and, at least teaq)orarily, are in the black. The Executive Council has approved our request for a conference next year. The topic proposed is as an Index to Popular Attitudes Toward Science,” but as yet the members of the panel have not been- selected. Since I will be in England until after September nothing will be made final until early fall. This is an indirect way of asking for your your own participation on the panel. In the December issue, I hope to give some brief report on recent and pertinent British publications that may not have been reviewed or publicized here as much as they should be. A final items I wonder whether or not Extrapolation might begin to do two things next years first, conqsile some kind of list of "work in progress” in the field; and second, publish an aimual bibliography of both articles and books in the field. Again, suggestions and volunteers. One phase of this might well be the annual index of the stories and novels themselves. Bernard Paris When I was first asked to speak to the Conference on Science Fiction, I intended to confine myself to George use of science in her But as I thought about the topic of the versus Science in found myself becoming more and more concerned with the relation between George Eliot, Science-Fiction^ and Fantasy It was necessary to introduce Fantasy Into the discussion because, as I hope to show., we need all three of these terms for a meaningful comparison. In his remarkable essay, "Stages in the Development of the Sense of Reality," Sandor Ferenczi argues that in early childhood we e^erience delusions of omnipotence in which consciousness and wish are the supreme realities. And that the pressure of our frustrations, if it does not drive us into some form of escape, forces us into a mature acceptance -of a limiting external world, Ferenczi holds that "the replacement (to which we are compelled by esqierience) of the childhood megalomania by the recognition of the power of natural forces conq>oses the essential content of the development of the ego,"^ Even in adulthood, of course, we retain a nostalgia for our early feelings of omnipotence; and this nostalgia, strangely enough, often finds expression in our use of science, which normally is so closely associated with the reality principle. When Ferenczi himself, near the end of his essay, wanders into speculations about future discoveries concerning "the phylogenesis of the reality- sense," he quickly relates his own extrapolations of the possible to the persistence of childish cravings for power and warns that we must always distinguish between the wish to know and the reality of knowledges The impetuous curiosity to know everything that has just seduced me into enchanted vistas of the past, and led me to bridge over the yet unknowable by the help of analogies, brings me back to the starting-point of these considerations to the theme of the acme and decline of the feeling of omnipotence. Science has to repudiate this illusion, or at least always to know when she is entering the field of hypotheses and fancies, (p. Ferenczi immediately launches into a discussion of the fairy tale as the antithesis of science and the reality principle; and as I reread this lo This paper served as Professor point of departure when he led the discussion at the December, Conference in Chicago, First Contributions to Psycho-Analysis trans. Ernest Jones (London, p, passage, after having been asked to speak to this group, I could not help being struck by how many of the motifs which Ferenczi ascribes to the fairy tale are also found in science fiction. Also, I could not help won=> dering if science fiction serves a psychological function similar to that which Ferenczi gives the fairy tales In fairy°°tales, on the contrary, [Ferenczi proceeds] phantasies of omnipotence are and remain the dominating ones. Just where we have most humbly to bow before the forces of Nature, the fairy° tale comes to our aid with its typical motives. In reality we are weak, hence the heroes of fairy»tales are strong and unconquerable; in our knowledge we are cramped and hindered by time and space, hence in fairy~tales one is immortal, is in a hundred places at the same time, sees into the future and knows the past. The ponder<° ousness, the solidity, and the impenetrability of matter obstruct our way every moments in the fairy=>tale, however, man has wings, his eyes pierce the walls, his magic wand opens all man may live in perpetual fear of attacks from dangerous beasts and fierce foes; in the fairy-tale a magic cap enables every transformation and makes us inaccessible, Thus the fairy-tale, through which grown-ups are so fond of relating to their children their own unfulfilled and repressed wishes, really brings the forfeited situation of omnipotence to a last, artistic presentation, (pp, If the fairy-tale presents artistically our longings for, and perhaps secret convictions of, omnipotence, fiction such as George is the artistic presentation of sober science, of our mature awareness of reality. At the heart of view of the human condition is a strong sense of the disparity between the inward and the outward, between desire and reality, consciousness and the world, Eliot attributed the timelessness of Greek tragic drama to its insistence upon the inevitability and universality of the collision between the individual and the generals "They had the same essential elements of life presented to them as we have, and their art symbolized these in grand schematic forms. The Prometheus represents the ineffectual struggle to redeem the small and miserable race of man, against the stronger adverse ordinances that govern the frame of things with a triumphant power, sense of the divorce between man and his world came to her through the impingement of the scientific cosmology and epistemology upon her early religious beliefs, but, as her remarks on Greek tragedy suggest, she soon came to see the sense of divorce as something which men of all ages have somehow experienced, Eliot strikes us as mature not only in her awareness of reality, but also in her refusal to flee from the pain of knowledges "The highest 'calling and election*," she proclaimed, "is to do without opium and live through all our pain with conscious, clear-eyed endurance, Cross, George Life as Related in Her Letters and Journals Cabinet Ed,, The George Eliot Letters, ed, Gordon Haight (New Haven, m, Science is present in fiction not so much in its specific findings and technological consequences as in its basic principles, its fundamental philosophy. The principles of the positivistic cosmology and epistemology constitute the most general lavs of fictional worlds; they are the presuppositions which govern every phase of her thought and which shape her vision of human nature and the hu a condition. The fates of characters grow out of the inevitsble workings of the cosmic process; but they are equally determined by whether the character ppraarhea reality in Subjective, egocentric-, childish way or objectively, scientifically, maturely. In her review of Modern Painters Eliot directly advocated the application of science's objective ^proach to every phase of lifes truth of infinite value that he [Buskin] teaches is real ism» the doctrine that all truth and beauty are to be attained by a humble and faithful study of nature, and not by substituting vague forms, bred by imagination on the mists of feeling, in place of definite, substantial reality. The thorough acceptance of this doctrine would remould our life.”^ For George Eliot, realistic fiction is that which is based upon the author's experience and observation, which is imaginative in that on the basis of the known it fills in unapparent facts, and which conforms in action and character to the laws of human and physical nature. The novel, for Eliot, was an instrument of discovery, as her letter to Dr. Joseph Frank Payne testifiesg Imy writing," she e]q>lained, "is simply a set of egqperiments in endeavour to see what our thought and emotion may be capable stores of motive, actual br hinted as possible, give promise of a better after which we may gains from past discipline we must strive to keep hold of as something more sure than shifting theory" Letters theory of fiction reminds one of the definition of science fiction which Bobert Heinlein draws from Beginald Bretnors "science fiction [is that sort of fiction] in which the author shows awareness of the nature and ioqjortance of the human activity known as the scientific method, shows equal awareness of the great body of human knowledge already collected through that activity, and takes into account in his stories the effects and possible future effects on human beings of scientific method and scientific fact." Westminster Beview (April, For fuller accounts of thought, see my articles, "Science and Art in George Quest for Values," The Humanist Jan.-Feb., and "George Beligion of Humanity," A Journal of English Literary History. Some of the material in the present essay will also appear in my forthcoming book, Experiments Life George Quest for Values, and is published with the kind permission of the Wayne State University Press. Bobert Heinlein, "Science Fiction? Its Nature, Faults and Virtues," in The Science Fiction Novel (Chicago, p. George Eliot would not reject this as a description of her own art. But is this a definition of what science fiction is, or of what it should be? Supposing that science fiction is what it should be, it must be pointed o.ut immediately that George fiction is much more concerned than is science fiction with the intact of science upon the psychic life of man, upon man's image of himself and his demand for a sense of religious, orientation in the cosmos. This brings us, of course, to a well-known weakness of science fiction, one which greatly limits its literary potentialities science fiction does not, and cannot by its very nature, create great characters and deal with the complexities of man's emotional life. Even so, it may well seem that science fiction has more in common with the realistic novels of George Eliot than it does with fairy tales: I suspect that it has much in common with both. Kingsley Amis, who likes science fiction but has no use for fantasy, insists that science fiction always aims to do justice to the laws of natures "while science fiction... maintains a respect for fact or presumptive fact, fantasy makes a point of flouting these; for a furniture of robots, space-ships, techniques, and equations it substitutes elves, broomsticks, occult powers, and incantations," Science fiction, despite its belief in the ability of man to create his destiny through the power of the scientific intelligence, cannot be accused of wishing away problems, as does the fairy-tale. Indeed, the problems which have come and are likely to come from a scientific, technological civilization form the subject matter of much of the best science fiction, which is clearly an important form of social criticism. It could be argued, however, that science fiction's joyous grappling with social problems, which seem in it to be the only really important problems, may be a flight from the self, from the coiq>lexities of emotional life, to the relatively simpler world of external difficulties. Also, one suspects that the possible horrors of science are often less inq>ortant than the possible powers of science, and that a stiff dose of ugly probabilities is the price that we willingly pay for a hint of glorious possibilities. Is the science in science fiction a psychological cover for its fairy-tale qualities? Can we permit ourselves, that is, to indulge in the fairy-tale motifs of science fiction because they are disguised as extrapolations of the possible or are surrounded by good bit that is unpleasant? I have in mind people who reject fantasy but like science fiction; others may have less need to justify their flirtations with the belief that mind is the master of time, space, and matter. It cannot be denied, of course, that much science fiction reveals the dominance in the psyche not of the pleasure principle, but of deep and terrifying anxieties about the fqture. At the saaie time, however, such fiction seeks to escape the uncertainties of thehman condition; it seeks to master the future by knowing it. Does it not reveal the same curiosity New Maps of Hell (New York, p, to know everything" that seduced Ferenczi into bridging over "the yet unknowable by the help of analogies"? I am sure that often it also re= veals informed foresight, a quality which, under the name of "vision," George Eliot valued highlyo Science fiction, then, is separated from the fairy tale and allied to fiction such as George by its attempt to do justice to the laws of nature; and it is separated from truly mature fiction such as George and allied to the fairy-tale by its self-indulgence, its use of science to transcend realityo "Often," writes Kingsley Amis, think that part— and I mean part— of the attraction of science-fiction lies in the fact that it provides a field which, while not actually repugnant to sense and decency, ^allows us to doff that mental and moral best behaviour with which we feel we have to treat George Eliot and James and Faulkner, and frolic like badly brought-up children among the mobile jellyfishes and unstable atomic piles" (p.

And hid in a cavern, where, weary and cold, j3xey slept a whole century throughi?= Than rose to return to their whole habitation. But found it dismantled and hoary; Their kindred were dead, and the new generation Refused to give heed to their story. And too, have slept a whole century through. And rising, go forth through my land; I seek for my home, and at length find the place But all is so strange and so grand; My cottage, that stood on the hill, is no more; A mansion now covers the ground; I pass up the yard, and approach to the door. But none to receive me is found. I go to the wonder lost: The fruits of all countries are there: The fig and the date are not hurt by the orange is luscious and fair. Each month brings renewal of all kinds of fruits The tropical flowers grow wild; The birds of the south and the African brutes Find the climate congenial and mild. In deep meditation I wandered alone. And lifted my gaze to the sky; And lot in the heavens a bright object shone. Approaching from regions on high: As an angel it hovered, then drop't by my side: "Who are you?" I asked and retreated: She folded her pinions and sweetly replied: "Your hostess; come in and be seated." No words can express my surprise when I learned This lady possessed my om name; She told me hear, when her husband returned. He, too, relationship claim. By different lines, they their pedigree traced. Through four generations to me; And my portrait the walls of the gallery graced. Where all of my race I could see. He turned to the hallj and my likeness selected. Mid pictures enchantingly bright; She told me photography now was perfected. And colors were painted by light. These pictures surpassed, in their scope and design. The paintings of masters of art; Their colors were such as no art could combine. And nature alone could impart. She that my mind was bewildered and dazed. And guided me forth to the green; "And now," she observed, as to teaven ahe gazed, "Mot a cloud in the sky can be seen; And yet I will bring, in the course of an hour, A thunder°cloud, lightning and rain; And languishing nature, refreshed by the shower. Will smile in soft beauty again.” She stepped to a rod, that extended on high^ And touched it with magical gathering vapors grew thick in the sky. And poured out a copious draught. She again touched the rod, and the sun, from his path. Looked down with exhilarant ray; All nature rejoiced in the life-giving bath. And mountain and meadow were gay. We walked through the nutmeg and cinnamon bowers. By statues and beautiful fountains. Mid shrubbery, fruit trees and tropical flowers. By streamlets and miniature birds, of rich plumage, from isle. And humming birds brought from Brazil; While songsters from Europe, the Ganges, and Nile, Glad nature's rich orchestra fill.

Were acclimated here and grew wild; And a motor, much stronger than steam, had appeared. Yet cheap, economic and mild. "And look," she exclaimed, as she lifted her face, "There, now in the sky is a ship; As swift as an eagle it moves to its place; Tis my husband returned from his trip," He stepped from the vessel, as near us it came. And dropped upon wings from above: He knew, from my portrait, my kinship and name. And hailed me in tenderest love. He told of his visit to Paris and Rorae>Of his flight over England and Spain; He found in his travels, no land like his home. No place where he wished to remain. He spoke of his trip to the banks of the Nile, To cities now crumbling to dust>> Of China, Japan and isle. Where all are in ruin and rust. He noted and wept, for the rapid decay. Of lands of the date and the lime. Where ignorance, vice and oppression held sway. And men sought a happier clime. But when he had passed o'er the isles of the ocean. And reached strand. His spirit was filled with a thrilling emotion, Of pride for his own happy land. He rested on top of the high Rocky Mountains, And turned for a view of the West; The land was a garden, with forests and home for the free and the blest. He turned to the East, and a picture more bright. Never rose in the poet's sweet dream; The land was an Eden of love and delight. With mountain and valley and stream. In the midst, at St. Louis, the Capitol loomed. With lofty and glittering seat of a Nation, where freedom first bloomed. Containing a billion of people. "And now," he exclaimed, "the whole ours. From Panama, North to the polet For naught but the ocean can fetter our powers, Or give to us less than the whole As we walked to the house, my companions reported. That roads through the land were not found. That men, on light wings, in the atmosphere sported. Or walked, as they pleased, on the ground.

And lot every house had a sun. Above me in splendor, surpassing the moon, A disk, in the heavens gave light; And neighboring orbs gave the brightness of noon, And scattered the darkness of night.

William Johaaon Thomas Clareson Because of the importance of light to science-fiction and the long tradition of the voyage to the moon, it may seem naive to call attention to the role astronomical findings have had in shaping the modem genre. Yet to do so in terms of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries provides a classic exaople of the interplay between scientific speculation and the literary imagination, Beginning perhaps in when Dr. Galle of Berlin "found" the planet Neptune as a result of the mathematical calculations given him by Leverrier, the attention of the magazines and the embryonic science-fiction genre turned Increasingly toward outer space, toward the planetary system. An increasing number of articles in such periodicals as Atlantic Month]^ during the 's and 's give their attention to "the present state of knowledge" regarding individual planets, as well as the nature of the great meteoric and cometary action which reached a climax with Comet in One indication of the way in which astronomy took hold of the popular imagination can be seen in Garrett Serviss' becoming identified throughout the country as "the New York Sun 's astronomer" during the 1880's. Most important, however, beginning in the 1880's Mars becomes the focal point of speculation until not only does it command the popular press but also, by World War becomes the umaj^ destination of any interplanetary voyage. Within the genre itself, let alone the popular magazines, the evidence of such novels as Nark To Mars Via the Moon which was dedicated to Percival Lowell and which reads in its early chapters like a textbook and then like a mystical tract, emphasizes that Mars became the focal point as the result of a single events Giovanni announcement in that he had discovered canal on Mars. The resultant controversy was changed— science-fiction. As Mark Hillegas has pointed out, Schiaparelli at least at first thought of the canali as "grooves" in the red planet's surface, but.the word was translated as canals, with all the resultant implications. In For a listing of American novels dealing with Mars, see Extrapolation. Vol. No. (December Hillegas, Mark, "The First Invasions From Mars," Michigan Alumnus Quarterly Review (Winter p. during the next opposition^ he found that some of the ’’canals” had parallel counterparts running their full lengtho Percival Lovell confirmed these observations in the same year, though he did not then publish in the popular press©^ Indeed, during the 1880*s in the American periodicals at least, the controversy merely simmers in essentially reportorial articles© own writing was not published until 1894o) But the potential seems Implicit in the speech Charles Young made in upon his retirement as president when he wondered whether or not those xnapping Mars’ surface "have not gone into a little more elaborate detail than the circumstances warrant,” and referred to wide and irreconcilable differences ”in minor points©” In order to make the most of the implications of the canal the writers needed a theory that would lend authority to the assumption of Intelligent life on Mars© Camille Flamraarion had suggested the possibility as early as simply because he could not imagine a planet as a ”vast and useless desert” when ”on earth the smallest drop of water is peopled with myriads of animalcules©©©” The theory, however, came from John Fiske, whose Cosmic Philosophy advanced the concept of necessary and progressive development© In its final form the theory insisted that the entire universe was governed by a parallel evolution® Thus Mars, as an older world, necessarily had an advanced civilization© Interestingly, many theosophical e£ al© writers took refuge in the idea; like Louis Po Gratacap, they knew The Certainty of a Future Life on Mars Even Wells presented a Martian who was least vaguely humanoid© The props were in place for the oppositions of and In Harvard University and the Flagstaff -Lovell Observatories backed expeditions to Peru; in to Chile© Professors William Pickering and David Todd, leaders of the q>editions of the respective institutions, could not reach agreement upon what they had seen, but they did acknowledge the possibility of life on Mars© Although in Britain the greater furor can^ with the opposition of in America it came later© As Darwin found his champion in Huxley, so Schiaparelli and his canals found theirs in Percival Lowell© Beginning in the popular press with his articles in Atlantic in which were to form the basis of his first book.

Mars and Its (!l907)© insisted the canals represented the irrigation system used by an advanced race to maintain a dying world© In he maintained he observed new canals that must have been constructed since his last observations in A kind of frenzy entered the controversy as early as with the sudden obsession to communicate with Mars© (In one cannot help but infer that the entire affair, but this communication especially, represented another expression of the cosmic loneliness of the fin de siecle) Nicola Tesla received electrical impulses in that could have originated on Mars,” while, ironically, William Pickering, the severest opponent of the canals, proposed in that the United States Todd, Mabel Loomis, Ruddy Neighbor Planet,” The Independent ^ril p© should spend ten million dollars to build a system of mirrors with which to signal the ilartians. Another plan called for giant cut-outs to be laid upon a desert. One of good friends, whose novels had been serialized in Cosmopolitan wrote a non-fiction article for that magazine after he had read Mars and Its Canals. In ”The Things That Live on Mars,** Wells suggested that Martianss will probably have heads and eyes and backboned bodies, and since they must have big brains, because of their high intelli<* gence, and since almost all creatures with big brains tend to have them forward in their heads near their eyes, these Martians will in all likelihood be larger in size than humanity, two and two-thirds the mass of a man perhaps. (March Another friend of the two men, who had written about the canals almost as much as Lowell and who had destroyed giant Martians by deluging them with water from their canals in his Conquest of Mars a sequel to Wells’ War of the Worlds, made perhaps the best judgment of the entire controversy. After recalling that in August Asaph Hall had discovered the twin moons of Mars, Garrett Serviss concluded: moons of Mars, having once been discovered, were afterward seen with comparatively small telescopes, the canals heve never been seen with the great glass at Washington, and dhly three or four observers besides Schiaparelli have ever seen them. Thus he wrote in but certainly by his later writing he helps to prove that the canals of Mars exist at least in the cosmography of the literary imagination.
