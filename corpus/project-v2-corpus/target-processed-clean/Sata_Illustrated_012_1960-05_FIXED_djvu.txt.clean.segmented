The light of the pale Egyptian moon Tnms polished silver each wind-swept dune.
And with Its shattered Jeweled rays The houndless desert sands are strewn.
From far across the sculptured drifts, A cry the silence lifts.
And fills the ancient temple's halls, Scholng through the time-worn rifts.
Its once-great glory now unknown.
The temple deeps through time, alone.
The desert rats and lizards creep,
(There kings onoe walked, upon the stone.
Like watchful guards, the pillars stand; Sentinels in this timeless land; Slowly crumhllng into dust; Deeply scarred hy wrlnd-hlown sand.
Three times its walls were covered o'er.
A heavy dusty rohe it wore.
Bidden from the pale moon's gaze.
And then the sands moved on onoe more.
Long shafts of silver light fall through Between the towering pillars to Form moon-paths across the floor.
And l^ght the spots where flow'rs onoe grew.
The moaning wind Begins to rise.
And fills the hall with echoing cries.
And while it howls and sohs euid sings.
The moon bangs lower in the skies.
As the glowing orhi descends, Slowly each light-path extends Into the ancient god's retreat.
Their Journey on his altar ends.
For one second's time, the light A Jeweled object Brings to sight.
The saoriflclal dagger lies Beside .a dceleton gaunt and white.
A man laid out upon the stone; His once-strong anas, now only hone.
To the altar of the god reach out, There a tragic thing is shown.
Lying in a tattered gown Upon the altar's top stained hrown Tith ancient hlood a heap of hones; A skull encircled hy a crown, A gem-encrusted golden hand; A mark of honor in this land.
In ages past the fairest maid In marriage gave the god her hand.
The sacrificial victim's fate; To give up all she loved to sate A dark and evil god's desires, Then through his priests, he called a mats.
Bow had she died?
Bow had he?
The hlade which struck so cruelly Into hie hack, was meant for her, That had caused this tragedy?
The their's perhaps a love so brief That he, her lover, filled with grief Sought to rescue or to die To find life's Joy or death's relief?
Bad she heen forced to natch him die?
Or he, to suffer her last cry?
Or perhaps, as lovers should.
Did they together fate defy?
Only those who saw the end Could any light the mystery lend.
But time has stopped their mouths with dust Long since to earth they did descend.
From the silver light.
Tiny specks of glittering white Thirl into the shadowed room To drive away the brooding night.
The glistening motes, as if endowed With sentient life, now form a cloud About the forms so still in death.
To clothe each in a glowing shroud.
Faster whirls the silver dust, Teavlng in and out, as must The dancers have, in years gone hy.
Fanning to flame the dark god's lust.
The wind, through cracked and broken wall.
Tith sobbing moans and screams, recalls The countless maids in ages gone Who met their deaths within these halls.
Suddenly, the moon descends.
The desert wind's mad walling ends.
The whirling dust sinks to the floor.
The echo with the silence blends.
Stillness in the temple reigns.
But though the moon set* light remains In two white spots.
The pillared hall More 'brilliance than the moon attains.
The shlbiiaerlng white unearthly glow Condenoes.
From lt« two shapes grow; Their forms, indefinite and faint.
As seen through clouds or water^flow.
From the altar’s blood-stained crown, A maiden young and fair steps down.
Her raven hair with jewels strung.
Her hands carress a gem-starred gown.
Her lovely lips part in a smile.
Her arms reach out: her eyes beguile.
Her face reflects the perfect love That neither time nor death defile.
Rising from the sand-scarred floor.
Her lover comes, as long before.
Handsome, strong and clothed in light.
He takes her in his arms once more.
^y they died in ages past How they came to breathe their last Must remain a mystery, For time has sealed the secret fast.
The temple where they met their end May in the years to dust descend.
But their pure and deathless love Throughout the aeons will extend.
Til no man is left to stand Where desert covers sea and land.
And fobbed of even the jackal's cry.
The breeze alone blows o'er the sand.
Ihe instant Chuok dove into the slime of the pool, he realized he was in trouble.
Crawlers slapped their suckers into his skin, eager for his blood...
But his momentum carried him deeper and it was too late to stop.
He saw the faint glimmer of the shoe in the red haze of the water.
Pulling it out of the mud he swam upward until he broke the surface.
Then he was quickly out on the grass, rolling over and over to scratch off the small crawlers. he stood up, shaking the water out of his shoe, Moxita came over and favored him by pulling out the remaining crawlers that he hadnot rolled off.
But she still wasnot speaking to him.
Not after what had happened last night That damned Guatoeat.
All this trou’ble.
Chuck Dewitt wiped the mud off his shoe and slipped it on.
Finishing with the zipper, he smiled hopefully at Hoxita but she was still mad.
He shrugged his shoulders and went back into the tent they'd rected the day before, lloxita follo'ved him, in silence.
Slowly, he began to pack and she packed with him.
She was a good wife, even if she was a Boondooker.
Chuck thought that the green tint of her skin added something to the natural lithesome beauty of her race.
But these mad spells of hers; they irritated him.
He whirled at her, "It was only a Guatooet, for cripes sakel" good Guatooat," she corrected.
"And you had to chase it away by throwing a shoe at it. it may not come back."
"’i/ell, all for that," Chuck said sarcastically, flinging a pair of dirty socks into one of the packs.
He buckled the straps and tossed the pack onto the levitator platform. a stupid religion," he persisted, "worshipping big oatsl" lloxita didnot reply, dhe'd lapsed behind her wall of silence.
And she wouldnot speak he glanced at his another hour or so.
Her mad spells often lasted two days.
But Chuck knew that he was falsely accusing her, Ihe cats werenot symbolic, nor even remotely connected with religion.
Boondock women liked the big tawny things and Boondock men seemed to hate them and chased them away whenever possible.
Chuck could easily understand why. like last night the big oat had prowled near their tent and created so much racket with its screams that he hadnot been able to sleep.
So, he had chunked a shoe at it to chase the thing away.
The shoe had plummeted into the pool.
It was too far back to the city to get another pair so he'd had to dive into the pool for his old one.
Guatooats were big trouble all the way around.
He took the guide rope and floated the platform out of the tent, then began to break down the plastic structure.
Toxita helped him dutifully.
Everything was packed and they moved out onto the jungle trail.
For a while, Koxita walked behind him.
But she soon tired and climbed upon the platform.
Chuck was a bug-trapper.
He made the rounds twice a month in his territory and sold the brittle bug shells to the hospitals on Earth.
When boiled down via chemical processes into a liquid state, the sticky substance that formed the bug's outer shell was a positive cure for the common cold He tended one trap, took the horned bug out of the statis field trap and killed it, then slimg the carcass aboard the platform, lloxita, who loved him inspite of the times when she was mad at him, scooted over to make room for the shell.
He sneaked a loving glance at his strangeworld wife.
Lately, it had come into his mind to have a son.
Of course, it wasnot easy to get the idea over to lloxita.
Twice, he had tried it, but .well. .He 'd also mentioned it to Harper, the old trader who operated the shell market-dome down by Caix lake and Harper had said rather embarrassed to take his wife with him on his next round of traps.
Chuck was doing now.
But advice was not succeeding because it seemed that lloxita was staying mad at him.
After he'd throra that shoe at the Guatooat, tossed his blankets outside onto the platform and that's where he'd spent the night.
Other Earthmen had children by Boondock women.
Ho problem there.
Proof of the matter was Harper.
Eighteen kids.
Hope.
The only trouble was with lloxita and the Guatooat s. i/earily.
Chuck bent his head and strolled on down the trail.
Haybe Harper could advise him.
After last night.
Chuck knew something had to be done.
The way things were going now, his nerves would collapse in another week.
The day seemed to pass slowly, but he put his mind to the task of tending the traps and it wasnot until late in the evening that he noticed the two Guatooats slipping through the dense ferns that bordered the trail.
The big oats were seldom dangerous.
They resembled an Earth tiger in some ways, except for the thin tentacles growing in a mass from the tops of their heads.
At first, he wasnot sure, but when he saw one spring lightly across a small clearing, he knew they were following him.
Just to be safe, he stopped and took his proton rifle off of the platform, Blinglng it over his shoulder, he felt more secure. be at about two hours from now," he said in direction. ihe didnot reply.
Chuck looked at his wrist watch.
It was odd that she wasnot over her mad spell yet.
Ihey seldom lasted this long.
Women I Ihe Guatocats seemed to he doing a good joh of keeping up with him.
Chuck noticed, because when he quickened his pace, they were still there sometimes invisible, but always present nearby.
He hoped they wouldnot start anything.
There was a stiff penalty for killing one of the creatures, whether they attacked you or not.
Evidently, if one attacked, you were supposed to run.
Chuck had never heard of one of the cats attacking a man but he’d be damned if he'd take any chances with one of them.
Ihe oats seemed to be creeping closer, becoming more courageous every minute.
He wasnot worried yet.
If things came to worse, he'd climb upon the platform and boost it up out of- reach.
Time was a factor.
If he could manage to reach the clearing at the cats would wander off.
Ke glsinced back at I.Ioxita. dhe seemed to be in a trance with the slight fringes of a smile playing about her lips.
He was tugging the platform around a curve in the trail when he came face to face with one of the Guatocats.
The big tawny thing was crouched ahead of him in the trail, its tail making a circle ominously in the air. tentacles waving furiously, it stared at him.
The oat appeared to be preparing to spring.
There wasnot time to get on the platform. .Vith an instinctive motion.
Chuck slung the rifle off his shoulder and brought it up and sighted.
There was a hissing noise as he pressed the button and the big oat fell apart into tiny dust motes that settled slowly to Barth, Moxita was screaming as Chuck darted forward in the trail to make sure that the other Guatooat wasnot preparing to attack.
But the other Guatooat had departed for places unknown.
So he ran back to comfort i’oxita.
She was crying uncontrollably, "You killed it she wailed, "You killed a Guatooat Chuck was angry now.
Uat at her for worrying more about a damned oat than himself and mad at himself because of the stiff fine he'd have to pay for killing the thing.
"Shut up," he told her.
Viciously, he grabbed the rope to the platform and, with the rifle grasped firmly in his othdr hand, he trudged quickly past the tiny pile of dead Guatooat in the trail.
It didnot take much longer to reach He was anxious to get out of the jungle now and he was also '.worried.
Moxita was having a nervous breakdown; screaming her head off.
At he could send for a doctor.
He was panting heavily when he broke free of the jungle into the clearing before market-dome.
The platform's inertia flung it to the length of the rope when Chuck stopped.
Harper, his white beard streaming over his shoulder, came running out to I.Ioxita and helped her down from the platform.
Ilrs.
Harper, a kindly Boondock woman, was right behind him.
Together, they led the still sobbing Moxita inside the huge air-conditioned dome.
Chuck was almost too winded and tired to move.
A moment later.
Harper came back out of the dome.
He wore a troubled frown.
"Tllgodl he exclaimed, "Did you really kill a Guatooat?"
Chuck, still breathless, was only able to nod hi's head.
"For sake, why I thought you wanted to be a father, '.fell, you've damned sure spoiled your chances nowl" "The oat was attacking," panted Chuck.
"Attacking, raved Harper, swinging his gnarled hands.
He stared at Chuck, his eyes flashing rage.
Then he began to simmer down.
Bor a time, he just stomped around in the dust.
Chuck was leaning on the platform for support, something Harper had said was beginning to dawn on him. .what has a Guatooat got to do with having a baby?"
Chuok asked.
He had a fairly high intelligence ratio, and was forming ooaolusions that soared him.
Harper didnot answer; merely shuffled the toe of his shoe in the dust Chuok moaned.
"Boondock doesnot have a... a tri-sexual race?"
Harper shook his head. all my fault, guess. just took it for granted that you already knew about the birds and bees," look! not going to let one of those damnea oats touch I donot give a bucket of blood if we never have any children!" oats only furnish atmosphere, son," Harper explained patiently.
"Ever hear one scream? fhat scream is a sonic nerve stimulent that does something chemically inside a woman."
"Ihen why do Boondock men chase them away?"
"How would you like to have a hundred brats yapping at your heels?
Boondock women require only two months in order to give birth to a new litter."
Chuck did some rapid figuring, "fhat amounts to about six children a year."
"i/rong," Harper stated, shaking his head.
"Depends upon the number of Guatocats.
One oat around, one child, fwo oats, two offspring.
■Jhen a Boondooker wants an offspring, he goes into the jungle and captures a Guatocat with a stun gun and puts it in a cage and takes it back to his home.
Bingo."
"If you'd told me this before, I wouldnot have shot that oat.
How, not only do I have a stiff fine to pay, but lloxita to pacify. probably stay mad a week."
"How would you feel if your nerves had just been ripped apart," Harper asked.
He shook his old wizened head, "But you're worse off than that, son.
Every time something like this has happened, the Gustooats refuse to cooperate from there on out. never scream around you again.
"But how could they know I killed one?"
Chuck asked. just go capture one in the jungle on the other side of the city." work.
Somehow, the oats know.
Telepathic."
And that was the gist of the evening.
Moxita soon regained some of her composure and Chuck set out on the return journey.
Unbelievingly, he stunned a Guatocat and fastened a cage' for it. v/hen it regained consciousness, it was as Harper had said the cat was morose and sat silently in its cage. nays passed.
Paying the fine hadnot hurt half as much as the real! zation that he and Uoxita could never have any children.
How that he had reason.
Chuck checked with a Boondock doctor and what Harper had told him was relatively true.
Weeks later, he discussed the situation with Harper when he was again in that territory.
"Moxita has grown sad," Chuck said, leaning across the counter as Harper counted his take of bug shells. lap-kitty wonot compare with a child," said Harper. rub it in.
How was I to know?"
"Could have happened to anyone," Harper justified. often wondered," said Chuck, "All of your children look abont the same age.
Why?"
"Eighteen Guatocats, son.
One of the dangers of living in the jungle like this.
All of my offspring are of the same litter.
Better believe I was careful after that.
I had a couple police Shepards brought in from Earth to use as watch dogs.
Dogs hate the big oats and the cats have little love for the dogs.
The dogs keep the Guatocats away." it!" yelled Chuck.
"Can I borrow one of your dogs?"
"Both of the original dogs have died, but sell you one of the pups Three months later.
Chuck again stopped at the market-dome and yelled for Harper to come out.
Harper and his gree-skinned wife went out into the dust and there sat Moxita on the platform with a baby in her arms Chuck was standing on the ground with the rope of the platform in his hand and a proud fatherly smile on his face.
^ow in Jupiter did you do it?"
Harper exclaimed, astonished.
"Earthman ingenuity," Chuck bragged. be blasted!"
"You gave me a clue the last time I was here," Chuck pointed out.
"Remember what you said about dogs hating the big cats?
'Well, I captured a Guatocat and, at an opportune moment, put the dog into its cage.
That Guatocat screamed alright, and loud."
Chuck let out a laugh and handed Harper a cigar.
"So, you see," he continued, like to buy another of your dogs.
Moxita and I have been thinking we might like a set of twins the next The painting was a monstrosity.
It was a swirling mess of green, red and brown, thrown together into crude and obscene shapes.
Suggestibility was the keynote of the painting; for one oould look at it for a moment and feel his imagination come alive with a hundred morbid dreams.
The painting hung in John llosby's livingroom, above his reading chair.
He had acquired it from an obscure aft dealer a month prior; and for all its ugliness, he enjoyed gazing at it in the evenings when he came home from his office.
There was a restful feeling in the brown shapes, a soothing feeling in the geeen and a relaxing feeling in the red.
Probably he was the only person, save for the one who had painted it, who oould look upon the painting and enjoy what he saw.
Or, rather, what he felt.
The door buzzer hummed at precisely seven-thirty.
John llosby, fresh out of the shower, with the faint smell of aftershave lotion clinging to his cheeks, carefully finished the knotting of his tie, glanced at the effect in his dressingtable mirror and felt pleased with his appearance.
For a bachelor of twosoore and seven, he thought, still a handsome fellow.
He opened the door and smiled at llaria, "Come in, darling," he said, taking her arm. liaria returned his smile and walked with him into the room.
They stopped in the center of the room and kissed.
Inria pressed herself to him hungtily, and for a long moment John liosby was lost in a strong desire.
When they reluctantly broke their embrace, John pushed Maria away, holding her shoulders and letting his eyes take in her body.
"Such a beautiful creature.
Too bad I couldnot have met you twenty years ago." "For all the good it would have done you," Maria laughed, was only twelve.
I had braces on my teeth, freckles splotched all over my face, and I was abominably fat.
Bo there "Well, we would have made a go of it anyway."
John Mosby threw his arm around shoulder and turned her around to face the wall upon which hung the painting.
He flung out his other arm, palm up. have acquired a priceless work of art.
How do you like it?"
Maria l&oked at the painting and for a while said nothing.
John Mosby glanced at her face and saw a film of fear over her eyes.
His arm still lay over her shoulders, and he oould feel her shrinking away from the painting.
Finally she said "John, it's hideous," "Hot hideous, just different," said John Mosby hastily, seeing that she was genuinely upset by the painting.
"How, come on, let's eat some of my marvelous cooking, then go sit mystified through a horror movie."
John Mosby returned to his apartment at twelve o'clock.
He turned on the reading lamp and sat down to relive the past two hours.
Marians body so near his own, almost merged with his own.
He knew her lipstick had come off on his shirt collar, and the knowledge made him feel strangely youthful again.
Maria 'Williams was indeed a lucky find for him. years old (she looked and acted morg like twenty-five), unmarried, with interests strikingly similar to his own, she had come into his life two years ago, at a time when he had relinq,uished himself to the staleness of "old age", and brought him baok to life.
During the last two years John I.Iosby and l.iaria had enjoyed a companionship that bordered on the sublime, ihey seemed to sense one another's thoughts, moods, emotions; they -vere held together by a bond of intimacy that neither of them could understand or explain. l!any times they said, were just meant for each other," and certainly that was true, i'hey had never cjuarrelled had never felt together.
Always, they looked for and brought out the best in one another, magnifying their affections.
And yet they were not in love. was a link between them, as strong as any personal link could have hoped to be.
They shared themselves with one another their thoughts, their hopes, their des-'' pairs but there was no love involved.
It seemed that one was extention of the other, and that without one the other was incomplete.
Ihey had met and they had come together, and now they were fulfilled.
In all ways save one: Iheir inability to find love, one for the other.
John Mosby sat far into the morning hours before a weariness fell upon him and sleep caused his eyelids to flutter.
He relaxed in the chair, stretched out his legs, kicked off his shoes.
Hlowly he dropped into a light slumber.
It seemed that he was still partially awake, for the sounds of the room the ticking of the mantle olook, the humming of the air-conditioner, the swirling of the colors over the canvas above his head were greatly magnified.
He seemed to he sinking down into a warm mist, which swirled about him and obscured his vision and rendered his body immobile.
The swirling of the colors over the canvas above his head-.
Yes; yes, he could hear the colors.
He could hear the reds and the browns and the greens.
The colors sounded so much different from the way they looked, but he knew which was which.
The lifuid gurgling; that was the red.
The rustling, awkward scraping; that was the green.
And the soft, humming vibration; that 'was the brown.
The sounds merged, crept across his mind, spread through his body, bringing a warmth.
You havenot found love said the sounds, tugging at him. found only pl^sure and temporary fulfillment they whispered liaria gives you strength, but she can never give you love they murmured, caressingly. is no good for you, but I am good for you.
I can give you love.
John Hosby awakened with frightening abruptness.
The voices of the painting still echoed in his mind.
His hands gripped the arms of the chair, and a great weakness held him in its frigid grasp.
"Maria, he said, "llaria."
The sound of her name was unpleasant.
"Maria."
The thought of her face, of her lips, of her eyes that looked into his own, was somehow obscured.
The memories of taking her into his arms and holding her so near he pushed them out of his mind.
Rising from the chair, he turned and looked at the painting.
The red spirals and the green swoops and the brown undulations.
They flowed and wriggled and contorted across the canvas.
They shimmered and reflected the light dully and oarae alive with a thousand faint but perceptible movements.
They formed soothing shapes and tender shapes and gentle shapes.
He gaced into the depths and saw a core of softness that beckoned so irresistibly that he could not deny it.
The reason I bought the painting, John llosby thought, 'was because I wanted love.
The reason I bought the painting was because I felt that it contained all the love I could ever need or want.
I didnot knoww it at the time, but that's why I bought the painting.
He had invited Maria to his apartment that night, as he had often done in the past, ostensibly to share with her a large dinner he had prepared for them.
But now he knew that was not the only, nor the real reason for his having wanted her to come to his apartment on that particular night.
He had wanted to show her the painting, and in so doing to say goodbye to her.
Iheir love-making had been particularly violent that night, just before he had left her.
Had she knowm what was happening?
He recalled the look on her face, the fear in her eyes when 'he showed her the picture.
Had she known, then?
'flell, it didnot matter whether she knew or not.
She would find out soon enough.
John Moshy oroased the room and picked up the telephone.
He dialed apartment and 'vaited for her to answer.
All the while, he watched the painting. voice came from the receiver, sounding very sleepy.
"This is John, Maria. sorry to awaken you at this hour, but there's something important I must tell you."
The painting formed 'many shapes, stretched out the colors and snapped them back, moving, curling, contorting.
He could hear the colors moving softly. is it, darling?"
Maria asked, and he was infuriated by the innocent tone of her voice.
Surely she must know.
The colors were moving faster, now, becoming impatient for him to say what must be said and get it over with.
He watched them, fascinated by their subtle changes, overwhelmed by the surge of warmth which passed through his body, causing it to ache pleasurably with an inexplicable passion; have called to say goodbye," John llosby said. the painting," Maria said. that hideous painting."
John Mosby chuckled.
It was the first time he had heard Maria speak angry words, and the sound was cold and rasping.
Here was a aide to Maria that he had never seen.
"Yes, it's the painting." knew.
I think I knew from the moment I saw it.
But we have so much, John.
I canot understand how a painting, a hideous painting like that, could take it all away."
The room was alive with the sound of the painting, and John Mosby wondered if Maria could hear it also.
It swelled in soft murmuring caresses; it whispered gentle words that were not words at all but wondrous sensations.
If Maria could hear those sounds she would know, or she should know, what a marvelous thing the painting was.
Hurry called the painting.
Hurryl Get it over wlth And he realized with a flutter of ant loi pat ion that the painting was jealous.
Maria had never been jealous of him.
Love made the difference.
Love made the jealousy.
"Goodbye, Maria," John Mosby said, dhe said something else, but he didnot hear her words.
He dropped the receiver back into its cradle.
It wouldnot hurt Maria too much, ohe wouldnot miss him for his own self, but she would miss him for the particular sameness that had held him to her.
John Mosby stretched forth his arms and started across the room toward the painting, while the room swelled and pulsed to the rhythm of love that came from the painting in beating waves.
The colors changed shape again and again, and a single form finally solidified and became a face.
Pull, red lips and soft, green eyes and dark brown hair.
A complexion that was light and clear and radiant.
The eyes shone, and the lips moved to form the words I love you John Mosby moved across the room with fire in his chest and a vast longing in his mind.
The room become very still and q,uiet as though time had frozen there.
Taking the painting gently from the wall, John Mosby held it tightly to his chest and closed his eyas and trembled as the fire of love burned through his being.
"And I love you," he said.

The following is a quote, Morris: "But what is beyond the stars?" he would ask.
"Other worlds, Eranoesco, other stars, which we see not."
"And beyond them?"
"Still others."
"Yes, but in the end, in the very end?"
"There is no end."
"There is no end?" repeated the boy, and Leonardo felt hand tremble within his; in the light of the unmoving flame of a lamp burning on a little table in the midst of the astronomical instruments he saw that the child's face had become covered with sudden pallor. where," asked he, slowly, with growing amazement, "where is Raradlse them, Messer Leonardo, the angels, the martyrs, the Madonna, and Sod the Father, sitting on His throne, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost?"
The master was about to retort that God is everywhere, in all the grains of sand of the earth, as wall as in the suns and the universes; but kept his peace, sparing the child's faith.
"The artist who does not doubt attains but little.
'Tis a good thing for thee if thy creation be above the value thou dost set by it; 'tis bad if it be equal to it; but the greatest misfortune of all is for it to be below it, which is the case with those who wonder how it was that God helped them to make anything so excellent.

Bernard Gnllbert Guemey (Engllsher) The Sabbath chapter Vll Out of the hearth-chimney flew Cassandra, sitting astride a black goat whose soft wool felt pleasant against her bare legs.
Rapture filled her soul, and, gasping for breath, she shouted and screamed, like a swallow plunging into the sky: "Sarrl Up from below, and steer clear We fly I We fly Naked, dishevelled, hideous Aunt Sidonia was rushing beside her, astride her soovel.
They flew at such speed that the air they clave whistled in their ears like a hurricane.
"To the Horthl To the North!" shouted the old woman, guiding her soovel like an obedient steed.
Cassandra gave herself up to the intoxication of flight.
"But this mechanician of ours, now, this poor Leonardo da Vinci with his flying machines!" she recalled suddenly and become still merrier.
Now she would rise upvvards: black clouds piled up beneath her, blue lightnings quivering in their heart.
Up above was a clear sky with a full moon, enormous, dazzling, round as a millstone, and so near that it seemed one could touch it with one's hand.
Then she would direct the goat downward anew, seizing him by his twisted horns, and flew headlopg, like a loosened stone, into the bottomless abyss.
"Vfliither goest thou?
Whither goest thou?
Thou wilt break thy neck!
Hast become mad, thou devil's wench?" vociferated Aunt Sidonia, barely keeping up with her.
And now they were rushing so near the ground that they heard the slumbrous grasses in the swamp rustling; the night-fires lit their way, and rotted logs glimmered bluely; the tawny owl, the bittern and the goat-sucking whippoorwill called plaintively to one another within dreamy forests.
They flew over the summits of the Alps, sparkling under the moon with their transparent bowlders of ice, and descended to the surface of the sea.
Cassandra, having scooped up some water in her hand, flung it upward, admiring the sapphire drops.
With every moment their flight grew faster.
More and more frequently did they come upon fellow wayfarers; a grey, shaggy wizard in a tub; a merry prebendary, pot-bellied, rosy-faced, like Silenus, on a poker; a fair-haired girl of some ten years, innocent of face, blue-eyed, on a bath-broom; a young, naked rufous anthropophagite witch, on a grunting boar; and a multitude of others.
"Whence come ye, little sisters?"
Aunt Sidonia hailed them/ "Out of Ellada, from the Island of Candiai" Other voices replied; "Prom Valencia.
Off the Brocken.
Prom Salaguzzl.
Llirandola.
Prom Benevento.
Out of Horoia." go ye?"
"To Biternel To Biternel There the Great Goat celebrates his espousal el Booh de Biternel Ply, fly!
Gather to the Supperl" How in a whole flock, like crows, they sped over a dismal plain.
In the fog the moon seamed blood-red.
In the distance the cross of a lonely village chapel took on a warm glow.
The rufous one, she who was galloping astride a hog, with a squeal flew up to the church, tore off the big bell, oast it with all her force into a bog, and, as it splashed into a pool with a plaintive clang, burst into laughter, just as if she were barking.
The fair-haired girl on the bath-broom began to clap her hands with mischievous playfulness,
(rg\ chapter Till fhe moon hid behind the clouds.
In the light of the twisted green torches of wax, their blaze vivid and blue, like lightning, upon the snow-white, chalky upland, the enormous coal-black shadows of the dancing witches ran, intertwined, and separated.
The Sabbath, the Sabbath!
Eight to left, right to i.6 Around the Goat of the Night, Hyrous Nooturnus, enthroned in state on a crag, thousands upon thousands whirled by, like black rotted leaves of autumn, sans beginning, sans end.
Garr Garr.
Glorify the Goat of the Night!
El Boch de Biterne!
El Booh de Biterne!
Ended are all our tribulations!
Rejoice!"
High and hoarse skirled the bag-pipes, made of hollowed dead men's bones; and the drum, drawn over with the skin of men who had met their end on the gallows, thumped with a wolf's tail, throbbed and rumpled, muffled and even: toop, toop, toop.
In gigantic cauldrons a horrible mess was coming to a boil, unutterably delectable, even though unsalted, for the Host of this place detested salt.
In modest little nooks love-jinks were starting up, of daughters with their fathers, of brothers with their sisters; of a black were-oat a tom, dainty-maimered and green-eyed, with a submissive little girl, slender, and as pale as a lily; of a visageless, shaggy incubus, as grey as a spider, with a nun who bared her teeth in a shameless smile.
Everywhere were loathsome couplings, squirming in their abominations.
A white-fleshed, fat witch-giantess, with a maternal smile on her foolish and kindly face, was feeding two new-born imps, the gluttonous sucklings had attached themselves greedily to her pendulous breasts, and, with loud smacking, gulped down the milk. infants, who had never yet participated in the Sabbath, were modestly tending, on the edge of the field, a' herd of knobby toads with little bells, tricked out in caparisons of cardinals' purple, and fatted on the Holy Eucharist.
"let us dance!"
Aunt Sidonia was impatiently tugging Cassandra.
^he horse-trader might see us!" exclaimed the girl, laughing.
May he be food for the dogs, this ansivered the old woman.
They both dashed off, and the dance carried, them off like a gale, with din, howling, squealing, roaring and laughter: "Garr!
Garr!
Bight to left!
Eight to left! long, wet moustaches, just like those of a walrus, were pricking neck from behind: someone's thin, hard tail was tickling her in front; someone or other pinched her painfully and shamelessly someone or other bit her, having whispered in her ear a monstrous caress.
But she did not resist: the worse, the better; the more awful, the more intoxicating.
Suddenly they all stopped, instantaneously, rooted to the spot; they grew deathly still, as if turned to stone.
Prom the black throne, where the Unknown sat in state, surrounded with horror, resounded a stifled voice that was like to the rumble of an earthquake: "Accept ye my gifts; the humble, my strength; the meek, my pride; the poor in spirit, my knowledge; the grieving at heart, my joyousness!
Accept ye them!"
A greybeard dotard, benigtaant of visage, one of the higher members of the Most Holy Inquisition, a patriarch of the wizards, performing the Black Mass, solemnly proclaimed: "Sanctificetur nomen tuum per universum mundum, et libera nos ab Omni malo.
Pall prostrate, ye faithful!"
All prostrated themselves, and, mimicking churohly chanting, the sacrilegious choir burst forth: "Credo in Beum patrera Luciferum, qui oreavit ooelum et terram, Et in filium ejus Beelzebub.”
When the last sounds had died away, and silence again fell, the foirner voice that was like to the rumble of an earthquake again resounded: "Bring me my spouse unespoused, my dove undefiled!"
The high priest interrogated: "What is the name of thy spouse, of thy dove undefiled?"
Cassanflral Madonna Cassandral" the answer rumbled forth.
Hearing her name, the witch felt her blood turning to ioe in her veins, felt the hair on her head stand up on end.
"Madonna Cassandral Madonna Cassandral" the ory floated over the horde, "iifhere is she?
'ilfhere is our sovereign mistress?
Ave, arobisponsa Cassandral" She covered her face with her hands, and was fain to flee, but bony fingers, claws, tentacles, proboscides, and shaggy spiders' paws stretched forth, seized her, tore off her shift, and drew her toward the throne stark-naked and shivering.
A goatish stench and the chill of death were wafted in her face.
She oast down her eyes in order not to see. fhen He that sate upon the throne spake, saying: "Come:" she bent her head still lower and saw at her very feet a fiery cross, shining in the dark.
Making a supreme effort, she overcame her loathing, made a step, and lifted up her eyes to Him who rose up before her.
And the miracle was wrought Ihe goat 's hide fell from Him, even as the shed skin sloughs from a snake and the ancient Olympic god Dionysos appeared before Monna Cassandra, with a smile of eternal rejoicing on his lips, holding a thyrsus uplifted in one hand, a cluster with its tongue.
And at the very same instant the Sabbath was transformed into the divine orgy of Baoohos; the old witches into youthful maenads; the monstrous demons into aegipedal satyrs; and there, where the dead bowlders of the chalky cliffs were, sprang up colonnades of white marble, illuminated by the sun; between them, in the distance, the azure sea began to sparkle, and Cassandra beheld in the clouds the entire sun-clad throng of the gods of Hellas. fhe satyrs, the bacchantes, striking tympani, stabbing their nipples with knives, siiueezing out the scarlet juice of grapes into kraterae of gold and mixing it with their own blood, danced, whirled, and chanted; "Glory, glory to Dionysos: fhe great gods have arisen from the dead: Glory to the gods arisen:" fhe nude youth Baoohos opened his embraces to Cassandra, and his voice was like unto thunder, shaking heaven and earth: "Come, come, my spouse, my dove undeflled:" !l Cassandra sank into the embraces of the god.
Magic concoction to make witches fly poisonous laotuoa, swamp smallage, hemlock, banewort, henbane, roots of mandragora, serpents' blood, and the fat of unohristened infants, tortured to death by sorceresses.
To be rubbed over the entire body, with incantations.
Btallg Begins Why is it that so many science fiction writers and editors fail to inform themselves of some of the simple rules of English composition?
They neednot know the more obscure ones; they arenot expected to recognize the vocative case when they use it, or the remnants in English of the instrumental case, but they should be able to write clearly without confusing the reader by errors in grammar and vocabulary.
Instead of following Ambrose exhortation to write it right, they write it rough, and leave it that way.
But the genitive case, for instance, is something they should recognize, understand, and know to form.
Nevertheless, the placing of the apostrophe is a frequent source of error.
It Is often found in the possessive pronouns ours theirs yours and hers and I am confidently expecting to find it some day in his.
The possessive character of these words resides in the words themselves, just as in mine thy thine etc.; it is not imparted to them by the addition oi^ with an apostrophe to denote some omission.
Yes, the apostrophe even when used to form a possessive does indicate an omission.
The original fora of book was Johnne his boke By changes in spelling and the elision of an h, this later became Johnis boke and still later book A corollary feminine form, such as Jane book, did not appear, because at the time the language was being formed women did not own property.
Another error which appears to be common to science fiction authors is the inability to distinguish between lay and lie I should almost be willing to say that I have never seen lie used correctly in science fiction.
But there isnot really anything difficult about it.
All that is required is to know the principal parts of each verb, and to remember that lie is intransitive, it never takes an object, and that lay is transitive, it must have an object; you must lay something somewhere and no jokes, please Probably the confusion arises from the fact that the past tense of lie looks and sounds the same as the present tense of lay.
However, the following table is memorizable in five minutes, and should have been memorized in grade school by anyone who considers himself a sufficient master of the language to be a writer. by Dr. Raymond Wallace Infinitive to lie (down, or abed) Past Past Perfect Present Participle I lay down I have lain down I am lying down Infinitive to lay somet hing own or anywhere) Past Past Perfect Present Participle I lay it down laid it down I have laid it down I am laying it down all there is to it; nothing more is required.
The verb to lie (repose) should not be confused with the verb lie
(to tell a The latter verb
(principal parts: He lied lied lying is quite a different word, with a different etymology.
Present I lie down Present should know what a predicate adjective is and use it when required, rather than use an adverb.
So say that someone looks badly does not mean that he looks unveil, it means that is vision is faulty, lo say that he felt badly does not mean that he was depressed or ill, it means that his tactile sense was defective.
If you feel bad, say so.
If there is uncertainty over the proper form of a particular word, substitute another in the construction to see what form it should take.
Ihere is no confusion over the differing meanings of looking anxious and looking anxiously Host science fiction authors do avoid the use of a double negative when only one is required, but they are not so skilful in avoiding a triple negative when they want only a double, fhey seem to be misled by the fact that a negative construction sometimes uses words which by themselves are not recognizably negative. cannot help but go is a common example of three negative where only two are wanted.
Xhe Intended meaning is that he must go, but not help and hut are all negatives in this construction.
A double negat ive makes a positive; a triple negative is equivalent to a single negative.
He cannot help going is a correct form of the intended expression; he cannot but go is another, a little stilted nowadays, perhaps, but still serviceable.
A particular source of error among writers of science fiction is the confusion of a certain group of words with others which are similar in sound or appearance, even though in some oases they may he opposite in meaning.
Ihis is nothing but fuzzy thinking, and a science fiction author in particular ought to keep his wits keen.
Sxarnples are wrack and rack; flout flaunt livid florid wreak wreck torturous full uls ome noisy noisome exercise exorcise and many more.
A writer ought no! to be content ne rely to co nt inue using a word in what he supposes to he its meaning.
It should be his goal, over a period of years, to look up in the dictionary every word he uses, not only for its precise meaning and other possible meanings, but for its derivation, in order to understand the subtle connotations arising from its etymology.

My Es and Six Years Old and in the First Last time around, in case you didnot know, this portion of Our Column was used to introduce your Affable and Illustrious Columnist.
This time, due to a complete paucity of requests for similar material, will continue this department by presenting the Stirring Story of My Hometown.
(Gotta be a nonconformist, ya know. the crowd say do something, ya canot just go do it.
Be independent, like.)
Huntsville, Alabama, is the generally accepted name of the quaint little village we're visiting in this month's trailer, though "Little Chicago" is also coming into vogue.
To our civic-minded citizens, however, Huntsville is "Rocket City, Stirring, eh wot?
How did this colorful title come into its present worldwide disrepute'' That, dear reader, shall here be discussed.
It seems that a couple of years ago some damned fool, noting that Redstone Arsenal is the major rocket resoarch base, galluraphed off to City Hall with a bright idea for getting famous and Looked Upon Awe.
All that's needed, stated this right-thinking dullwit is that the city be subtitled "The Rocket City."
Our typically bright, energetic Chamber of Commerce quickly went ape over the scheme, doubtless thinking of our' immddiate fame and lasting universal recognition; of the countless industries clamoring to get into Our Town.
(Here we slip in a dramatization for extra effect the scene is the plush central office of Blehh Enterprises, Inc.; the speaker, a young junior executive named a backer of Togetherness, a suburbanite, and the proud owner of high-powered late model tailfins.
As Camera pulls in for a close-up, we do a slow dissolve into the action:) it seems to me, and my conclusion was reached only after long hours of thought and a great deal of study, that we should move our largest factories and several of our principal branch offices to Huntsville.
For, after all, is Huntsville not 'The Rocket City'?"
(Slow fade by Camera as the house lights are turned up; the fading sound track a conglomeration of the rabid shouts of the supporting oast, shouts (a) proclaiming the brilliance of this suggestion, (b) promising the immediate advancement of and
(cl quibter murmurs of the old corporation members as they contentedly realize that they'll be able to leave good ol' Blehh in good hands when they pass on, and like that Things started rolling fast with the Think on the council pressing the matter.
Before long out came an intriguing little booklet called, by some strange working of the Spirits, "Huntsville, The Rocket City".
Gosh.
Such originality there.
This book naturally became an instantaneous nationwide hit, relating to all the beautiful story of how John Hunt (ah, these clean-cut caucasions) built his log cabin at the site of the Big Spring, fabled from time immemorial in Indian legends..
Well, it must have been an "instantaneous nationwide hit" (if I may baoktraok there to quote the writings of a great man).
After all, wasnot it an overnight sellout .here?
Indeed it was.
Enough of this mockery: being Broadminded and '’^'earlaas, I fear I must admit that it does not appear likely that this stirring document ever got out into th« outer world, Land of Shadow Beings; much past Lily Flagg.
But nearly everybody in town, since they bought it, decided that we had become fabulously famous and that soon we would be drenched with inquiries from people wanting to spend their money here.
Ho say Vfhile rummaging around a local used-book store downtown, I came aoro«s an old mimeographed newssheet which I found of oonsiderable interest.
It was titled Radio limes Sounds Today and a portion of it is reproduced below; ((Mistakes, sloppy pacing, and runtogetherwords may be solitarily accredited to the editor)) Poor Excuse For)) April, Hugo Oernsbeok, long a leader in the publishing of radioand electronics magazines, has in formed Radio Times that this month he will release, as an experiment a fl.agazine consis ting entirely of pseudoscientific fiction, or as he calls it, "scientifiction."
Mr. Gernsbeck founded the world's first radio magazine, "Modern Electronics", in In he published his fantastic serial, "Ralph High sales encouraged Gernsbeok to continue publishing these in later magazines such as "Science and Invention" which had stories not only by Gernsbeck but by outside writers. the editors of Radio Times deplore the practice of selling such material as Mr. Gernsbeck' scientifiction in a package advertised as containing electronic facts.
Such fads, included only to boost sales figures, can do nothing but harm.
While many of us strive to bring radio magazines into the respectability they fully deserve rich’ schemes of a few tend to teardown all we have accomplished.
Wildeyed scientifiot ional stories are not what the readerswant.
As has been proved time and time again, the best policy is to stick with articles on the electronics field, and try to combat the bad image created in the Ipublic eye bythesefads We sincerely hope that Mr. Gernsbeck will recognize his mistake and return topublishing the factual type of material that gave him his start.

"Ho" is a royal way of saying, "9ome here."

Frank Baum, The Emerald City of Oz Tea, this really is the real editorial. .tho it will probably turn out pretty much the same as the other Cor unreal) one, with or without the swans, since it's being written by the same goof anyhow.
I suppose I should mention to any Loyal louts among the readership that at last our little zine is acquiring the Satanic reputation it so richly deserves.. .
The editor personally has been acknowledged as: A pagan, a cynic, a beatnik, an athiest (beouz I play golf on Sunday morning) a communist, (becuz I made mention of the fact that the newspapers or the major magazines of the und just might not print the exact truth all the time) a Sox Fiend,

One of my aunts loaned me a book just a privately printed little job on the life of my great-grandmother. called "Poems and Prose by Kate Terry Pearson" and it contains her account of her life in addition to a collection of tender poems.
