 QUARTER TO FOUR.
CHAPTER I.

An Enigma.

Mr. Benson, of Benson & Grimes, attorneys,
was a small man physically, with tow-colored hair
and eyebrows, and two mismatched eyes, one
brown and the other gray. His eyes fenced gro

tesquely with mine, as I entered his private office
and stood at attention.

I had never met the man before, and the curi

osity of two strangers who suddenly find that
they have business together was ours. On my
part, the curiosity was heightened by an utter lack
of knowledge concerning the business.
“Well?”

Mr. Benson, wriggling in the chair before his
desk, rapped out the word with the insistent em

phasis of a busy man with no time for trifles.
“My name is Robert Lorry, Mr. Benson,” said
I.
9

“Ah!” He whirled quite around in his pivot
chair at that, and vouchsafed me his full atten
tion.

The brown eye and the gray traveled over my
seedy garments and unshaven face. I wondered
if he knew I had but two five-cent pieces in my
pocket.
“Sit down, Mr. Lorry,” said he, indicating a
chair.

“Has this business of ours anything to do with
my Uncle Rufus?” I inquired, taking the chair.
“Whether the business has anything to do with
relatives of yours or not I don’t know,” he re
sponded. “My part is extremely simple, Mr.
Lorry, consisting merely of making sure you are
the man wanted, delivering a document and a
small sum of money, and giving you some instruc
tions orally. I have no knowledge of the whys

and wherefores, and I cannot say that they
greatly interest me.”
He got up from his seat and went to a small

safe at one side of the room. Taking a long
manilla envelope from the safe, he returned to

his desk, drew a sheet from the envelope, and
spread it out before him.

“It will be necessary, Mr. Lorry,” he resumed,
leaning back in his chair, “for you to submit to
a number of questions decidedly personal in na

ture. This is by way of establishing your iden
tity.”

I nodded. There was much of my past that
I would have been glad to undo, but nothing that
I was ashamed of. Mr. Benson might probe as
deep as he liked.
My principal concern was for the elaborate
precautions he was taking to make sure of my
identity. What was in the wind?
Mr. Benson raised his eyes from the sheet in
front of him.

“How old are you, Mr. Lorry?” he asked.

“Twenty-six.”
The lawyer dropped his eyes to the paper,
picked up a lead-pencil, and checked off my an
SWer.

“Where were you born?”
“In Great Barrington, Massachusetts.”
Another move with the pencil. It was plain
that the examination was going forward cate
gorically.
“Your father's given name?”

A Q_u art e r to Four
“Hiram.”
“Your mother’s maiden name?”

“Anne Mayhew.”
“Are your parents living, or dead?”
“They died when I was five years old.”
Mr. Benson checked twice. Evidently my re
sponse had covered two questions. .
“Where did you live, and with whom, after the
death of your parents?”
“In Great Barrington, with my uncle, Rufus
Lorry. My parents left a small estate, and Uncle
Rufus was made guardian and trustee—”
He lifted a hand restrainingly.
“Let us stick to the catechism,” said Mr. Ben
son; “it is not necessary to go beyond what I
have here. When did you leave Great Barring
ton, Mr. Lorry?”
•

“Eight years ago.”
“Where have you been since?”
“It would take some time to tell you that, sir,”

I answered. “I have been knocking about the
world, and

39

“That is the reply I wanted,” interrupted Mr.
Benson, with more work of the pencil. “Any
other relatives besides your Uncle Rufus?”
I2

“I have another uncle, Jeremiah Lorry, who
is a missionary in
“Any one else?”
“A cousin on my mother's side of the house.
99

-

No one else.”
“The cousin’s name?”

“Arthur Mayhew.”
“What is Arthur Mayhew’s business?”
“He was a soldier in the United States army
when I heard of him last.”

Mr. Benson penciled an “O. K.” on the sheet,
refolded it, and laid it aside.

“Your answers are satisfactory,” said he, “and

I am now to proceed on the supposition that you
are the Robert Lorry wanted.”
He drew from the envelope a small packet of
paper money.

“Please count it,” he went on, handing the
money to me.

“One hundred and fifty dollars,” I observed,
after thumbing the bills.
“Here’s a receipt. Please sign it.”
He drew out a leaf at the side of his desk,

laid a typewritten slip upon it, and handed me an
I3

A Q_u arter to Four'
inked pen. My fingers shook a little as I signed
my name. The typewriting began: “Received
of Benson & Grimes, per Benson.” There was no
other cue to the donor of the money, and I was,

quite naturally, mystified.
“I should like to know who gives me this,” I
remarked.

“I am working at the instigation of another
attorney, Mr. Lorry, and am as much in the
dark as yourself. Two hundred and fifty dollars
was sent to me. My fee is fifty dollars, and it
cost fifty dollars to have a private detective hunt

you up at that Twelfth Street boarding-house. I
was told merely that you were in Chicago, and
Chicago”—he smiled slightly—“is rather a large

place in which to locate a stranger. The re
mainder of the amount sent to me is now in your
hands.” He folded the receipt and laid it with

the other document. “That money is to be used
for a purpose, Mr. Lorry,” he added.
“What purpose?” I inquired.

“You are to proceed to San Francisco, timing
yourself to arrive in that city on the twenty-fifth
of April. When there, go to the Palace Hotel.

Three others will be there, waiting for you.”
I4

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“I am to make myself known to them?”
“Yes.”

I was properly at sea with all this, you may be
sure. Yet my life had been one which enabled
me to adapt myself to the circumstances with

comparative ease. Taking a pencil and note-book
from my pocket, I asked for the names of those I
WaS to meet.

“I do not know the names of the three per
sons,” was the lawyer's astounding answer.

“They will be at the Palace Hotel, San Fran
cisco, on the twenty-fifth, and will be expecting
you.”
“I take it, then, that they know my name and
will make themselves known to me?”
Mr. Benson shook his head.

“They do not know your name,” he proceeded,
“and will make themselves known to you by ques
tion and answer. You may do the questioning,

or the others may do it. The question is this:
What time is it? The answer: A quarter to
four. You may give the challenge, or receive it,
and the response must be the one stated.”

“This looks like a lot of claptrap possibly lead
ing nowhere!” I exclaimed.
15

A Q_u a r t e r to F our
“Possibly,” returned Mr. Benson.
“Is it a hoax?”

“Rather an expensive one if it is, don’t you
think?

You will take this”—he drew a small

sealed envelope from the larger one and handed
it to me—“to San Francisco with you.”
There was no address on the envelope, no in
formation of any kind.
“Unless instructed to the contrary,” said Mr.
Benson, “you will open that envelope at a private
conference of the four after all of you have been
identified.”
This looked to me like a lot of cumbrous ma

chinery for evolving an infinitesimal result.

I

said as much, in a tone of pronounced depreca
tion.

The lawyer's mismatched eyes surveyed me
with weary impatience.
“I have done my part, Mr. Lorry,” he an
nounced, “and you will either do yours or leave
it undone, as you see fit. Good morning.”

Thereupon I left the room, the money in my
pocket, the sealed envelope in the breast of my

coat, and my mind in a chaos of speculation as
fruitless as it was exasperating.
16

CHAPTER II.

Zooking Backward.
Have you ever observed how hard luck, when
it once deals you a telling blow, follows it up with
another, and another? You are fortunate indeed
if this observation is not born of personal experi
©11Ce.

Misfortune, getting past your guard with a
blow that dazes and bewilders, proceeds forth
with to take advantage of your sorry condition
and to smite you hip and thigh. Thus had the
world gone with me up to the very hour I had
received that letter summoning me to the office
of Benson & Grimes. Just before the letter came

into my hands, so grievously had I been worsted
by the “blows of circumstance” that I had begun
to wonder if I were not down and out.

Adversity is a rough road. Where it branches
from the smooth and sunny thoroughfare of Suc
cess, one can usually look back and see a sign
board that was wrongly interpreted.

For me, Uncle Rufus stood at the parting of
17

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
the ways. If he had been a little less inflexible,
if he had concerned himself a little more with my
natural bent and had not sought to drive me into
a vocation for which I was manifestly unfitted,
perhaps I should not have awakened, that bright
spring morning, in a humble, eight-by-ten hall
bedroom, with certain arrearages of board to
meet, and with only ten cents in my pockets.
My estate—which, with myself, had been left
to the care of Uncle Rufus—was small, amount

ing to about five thousand dollars. Yet if the
world gives Atlas as much trouble as that money
gave Uncle Rufus, then I am sorry for Atlas.
Uncle Rufus wanted me to become a minister.

As I had absolutely no inclination that way, he
deferred to the wanderlust that had taken hold

of me from my infancy and trimmed his desires
to the more modest specifications of a missionary.
He thought that by wandering in heathen
parts I could please myself, and that by evangel
ising the heathen I could please him. But still
his pattern was too large for his cloth.
The Crusoe spirit fastened upon me by virtue
of a one-syllable edition which I sequestered
about the time I discarded pinafores for short

trousers. From Defoe's mariner it was an easy
stage to “Gil Blas,” and only a couple of steps
farther to the “Count of Monte Cristo” and
“Two Years Before the Mast.”

My reading-room, while I lived with Uncle
Rufus, was a corner of the haymow. In the
house, my puritanical, straight-laced guardian
had laid out a noble library, with Fox’s “Book
of Martyrs” at the head, for my especial benefit.
One day Uncle Rufus commended the zeal I
displayed in imbibing the “Martyrs,” only to look
over my shoulder a little later and find “Jack

Harkaway” snuggled among the leaves. From
that moment our estrangement began, growing
through the years to an ultimate separation.
I graduated from the high school at eighteen,
with an imagination that had won me the honor
of class prophet. It was a gallant effort, I re
member, carving out fame and fortune for nine
young men and women; and inasmuch as I left
every one of them in power and prominence, it
was heartily applauded.
I went home that night to find Uncle Rufus
dallying with a bonfire. As I drew nearer, I
19

y

A Q_u a r t e r to Four

saw him poking the last vestige of my haymow
collection of literature into the flames.

We had words. At midnight I stole away
from the house, left Great Barrington and the
dear old Berkshires on the trucks of a passenger
train, and in three days had shipped as cabin-boy
on a tramp steamer bound for Cape Town.
How is a soldier of fortune launched upon his
career? In some such way as this, I imagine,
providing the inclination to roam is strong
enough to endure the hardships.
On the way to Africa I had sailoring cursed
and hammered into me.

No sooner was the

tramp under the shadow of Table Mountain than
I went overboard in the

night, and, in due course,

reached Bultfontein and the diamond-fields.

Looking for bits of carbon in blue ground did
not satisfy me, and it was not long before I joined
a party that raided the Boers, got Old England
in no end of trouble, and, incidentally, put me in
hospital for a month. When well enough, I
shipped on a Yankee trader for the South Seas,
from the Portuguese settlements.
It is needless to detail the eight years of knock
ing about. Soldiers of fortune usually find Cen

tral America in their itinerary, so quite naturally
it dropped into mine.
Had I been on the right side of the con
troversy, the man who would have made himself
dictator of one of the two-by-four states would
have remembered me substantially. What a
wealth of possibility is wrapped up in those
words, “would have” and “should have!”

As it chanced, I was on the wrong side of that
Central American argument. A handful of
ragged fugitives got me into Mexico in a ham
mock swung between horses, for I had been badly
wounded.

The fugitives left me to die in the hut of a
peon, and with the peon they left a big bag of
silver dollars, to pay for decent interment and to
reward the peon for his trouble.
All my life long I had been disappointing peo
ple, so I disappointed the peon and began to re
cover. When he saw the bag of dollars slipping
away from him, my gracious host tried to finish
the bullet’s work with a dirk.

He found me with more fight at my disposal

than he had imagined, and I escaped with my
dollars and my host’s burro, ultimately reaching
2I

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
the City of Mexico. Still far from well, a desire
to get back into God's country took hold of me,
and I struck for the heart of it, making the long
railroad journey to Chicago.
I would settle down, I fondly persuaded my
self. I was twenty-six, and it was high time.
Eight years as a rolling stone had left me with
“moss” enough to pay two weeks' board in a
humble South Side boarding-house. I awoke
from my Monte Cristo dreams, and even the hum
bler fortunes of the Irish Con Cregan failed to
interest me. I would look for a place to work.
I looked for a month, walking to save car fare
during the last two weeks of the time. My
search was unsuccessful.

I could not keep books, I could not write short
hand, I was not scholarly enough for a private
tutor, and had no references for a position of
trust. No one in Chicago wanted a man of such
shining abilities as I had developed.
As a last resort I tried shovel-work in a sewer

gang. My spirit chafed because of it, but my
landlady, Mrs. Pynchon, was becoming garrulous
on the subject of a fortnight's bill, due and un
paid.
22

A Q_u a r ter to Four
The discovery that the wound in my side made
shovel-work an impossibility was not particularly
distressing. I drew my time at the end of an
hour, and, with fifteen cents in my pocket, walked
from Diversey Street, on the North Side, to
Twelfth Street, on the South.
My interview with Mrs. Pynchon, when I got
back to the boarding-house, was of a nature that
I hesitate to describe. During my absence she
had taken possession of my grip, had examined
it at her leisure, and had found it to contain a
short-bladed machete, a brace of revolvers, and

a pair of puttees.
Mrs. Pynchon was wroth, indeed, and in the
morning I must pay, or go. She would keep the
relics of my Central American experiences and
sell them for what she could get.
I was thinking of all this as I lay in my bed
that bright spring morning, looking out through
the dusty window-panes. Should I, or should I
not, write to Uncle Rufus for an accounting?
It seemed to me that five thousand dollars,

properly invested for eight years, should amount
to quite a tidy sum. Many a time before I had
thought with longing of that money, but senti
23

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
ment—foolish, if you will—had kept me from
claiming it.
My dream, tenderly nursed for those eight
years, had been to return to Great Barrington
possessed of untold thousands, thus proving com
placently that I had “opened the oyster” with my
own good sword. To demand an accounting of
Uncle Rufus was tacitly to acknowledge defeat—
to admit he was right when he said, during our
last bitter interview, that I would go my un
bridled course and come to want.

For a man, whose strong spirit pants for suc
cess, the acknowledgment of failure is galling.
Even at a time when my fortunes were at their
lowest ebb I could not bring myself to it.
Yet I was beaten. Lying there in that bed, for
whose hire Mrs. Pynchon still stood on the credit
side of my ledger, I pondered the momentous
question as to whether, being down, I was to be
counted out.

In the throes of my quandary a knock fell on
the door.

“Mrs. Pynchon,” I thought, “come to eject
me.”

But it was not Mrs. Pynchon. It was Betty,
24

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
the maid, and Betty, wonder of wonders! had a
letter for me.

That letter proved to be the brief document
that carried me to the office of Benson & Grimes,

attorneys, the astonishing result of which call
has already been chronicled.
I have never been very long in reaching a de
cision, or in mapping out a policy for future en
deavor. With money for immediate needs and
traveling expenses, it was not five minutes after
I left the lawyers' offices before I had made up
my mind to see the matter through.
Thereupon I replenished my modest wardrobe
with a new suit of clothes, visited the barber’s,

and went back to Mrs. Pynchon's with the air of
a prodigal who has come into his own.
Nothing succeeds like success, unless, now and
then, it is something that has the appearance of
success. Mrs. Pynchon’s attitude veered with the
favoring wind, and her hostility melted away in
smiles.

-

The roll of bills which I drew from my pocket,
in canceling my obligation, appeared to contain
vastly more than it really did. While her eyes
widened, her morbid amiability increased.
25

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
She was curious, of course.

What woman

would not have been, in the circumstances?

It

required all my tact to parry her indirect ques
tions without offending.
There was an embarrassing moment when she
returned my satchel, but when I left she gave
me a hearty hand-clasp and begged that I would
not forget her house whenever I chanced to be
in the city.
Forget her house? Not I, whether in the city
or out of it. The most discouraging period of
my life had been passed in that third-class board
ing-place on Twelfth Street.
That evening I started westward in a “tourist”
sleeper, equipped with a sealed envelope and a
horological countersign, more than half-con
vinced that I was wanted for some filibustering
expedition.

26

CHAPTER III.

The Time o' Day.
The morning of April twenty-fifth found me
in the Palace Hotel, in the City of the Golden
Gate. To particularize further, the beginning
of that eventful day found me in the great ro
tunda with a weather-eye out for swashbucklers
of the filibustering type.
Reflection during that long cross-country jour
ney had still further convinced me as to the de

sign back of my interview with Mr. Benson. The
law has a heavy hand for filibusters outfitting
from a peaceable port; hence the mystery that
pointed my course and shrouded my movements.
One detail alone marred the theory I had

evolved. Sailors' lodging-houses on the “Front”
should have been the scene of our questionable
coming together, and not that magnificent hos
telry.
Big, broad-shouldered, devil-may-care swag
gerers, with a thwartship-roll in their gait, would
surely be out of place in that splendid rotunda.
27

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
Through the curling wreaths of my cigar I looked
for such persons in vain.
“May I trouble you for the correct time, sir?”

The words came like a thunderclap, came from
the depths of a sleepy-hollow chair on my right.
I hoisted up on one elbow for a sidewise stare.
A stout gentleman, with smooth face and iron
gray hair, silk-hatted and prosperously dressed,
had launched the question. A morning paper lay
across his knees and he was studying the open
face of his watch.

“A quarter to four,” said I, searching the ques
tioner with a keen look.

The gentleman gave a startled gasp, counter
ing my glance with one of perplexity and alarm.
Still holding his watch in his hand, he struggled
to his feet and made his way to the desk. There
he had some talk with the clerk, both shooting
covert looks in my direction.

No doubt they considered me a fool or an idiot.
It was late in the forenoon and could not by any
possibility have been a quarter to four.

My disgust was intense. The shallow absurd
ity of my position exasperated and mortified me.

Red and perspiring, I got out of my chair and
28

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
went into the writing-room. Seating myself in
font of a desk, I leaned on my elbows and began
canvassing the difficulty that had so suddenly pre
sented itself.
I had Benson’s word for it that there were

three persons in that hotel who were as anxious
to find me as I was to find them.

But there were

many guests, and if I went from one to another
inquiring the time of day, it would not be long
until my sanity was questioned, and an officer
called in.

-

It was consoling to know that there were three
others placed in a similar situation. The ridicu
lous aspect of the affair caught me finally, and I

laughed to myself.
Instead of waiting for a challenge I would give
one. A yard away sat a middle-aged individual
in a black silk skull-cap. He was writing in

dustriously.
“Pardon me,” said I, “but could you tell me
the time?”

-

The man in the skull-cap paused, looked toward
me with a frown, then jerked his head in the di
rection of a clock that stared me in the face from
29

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
an opposite wall. There was no need of words,
and none were spoken.

There were three others in the writing-room.

*..

All had heard my query, and, if one of them had
been in the plot, certainly he would have signi
fied it in some way and presently have come close
enough to give me privately the correct answer.
After a brief wait, during which nothing hap
pened, I got up and went away. My disgust, it
is needless to say, mounted as failures multiplied.
If a quartet of filibusters were to come together
in that hotel, why had not the guiding mind speci
fied green ribbons in coat-lapels, brick-red neck
ties, or some other identification that would ap

peal to the eye? For getting a man into trouble,
commend me a dozen times over to what he says
rather than to what he sees.

Simple and inoffensive expedients, it ap
peared, had been laid by. A silly question and
a brainless answer; I must abide by these if I
were to follow the matter to its legitimate con
clusion.

Leaning against a marble column in the ro
tunda, I watched the people coming and going
across the mosaic floor, lingering at the desl:, or
30

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
filing away toward the elevator under convoy of

the agile money-seeker known as “Front.” Idlers
in the sleepy-hollow chairs again underwent my
scrutiny.

There was nothing at all promising in this ma
terial.

No one trod the mosaic floor with knees

bent as though to meet the heave of a deck, no
one bearing the earmarks of a filibuster idled in
the big chairs.
Nevertheless, that was the Palace Hotel and

the day was the twenty-fifth of April. If I had
been steered on a proper course, there were three
within sound of my voice who were as anxious to
find me as I was to find them.

If, from my post at that marble column, I had
dared shout my query as to the time o’ day, no
doubt the three missing ones would have heard.
But I lacked the hardihood for such initiative,
especially as a big clock, with a dial like a full
moon and hands and figures that could have been
seen a mile, hung in plain view from every part
of the rotunda.

From berating the extravagant machinery that

was to lay me alongside the trio I had come to
meet, I fell to chafing at my helplessness. Leav
31

A Q_u arter to Four
ing the rotunda, I went out to the sidewalk in

front of the hotel. The fresh air, I thought,
would clear my brain and settle my nerves.
Market Street was crowded with people. A
fruit-growers’ convention was in progress, and
the walk in front of the Palace seemed to be the

rendezvous for a visiting delegation.
I elbowed my way into the throng, decided that
it was no place for any one not a fruit-grower,
and started to elbow my way out of it again. A
man collided with me, and the next moment I

pricked up my ears at the query:
“What time is it, neighbor?”

The voice was husky, the man was blear-eyed,
and his ensemble was little better than that of a

hoodlum. By then I had learned to be cautious.
Bracing myself against the ebb and flow of the
human current, I drew my watch from my vest.
While ostensibly studying the face of my time

piece, I would scrutinize the face of my inter
locutor.

If wariness could help me, I would not place

myself in a false position again. While I was
debating whether I should give my inquirer the
right time or the countersign, he solved the ques
32

A Q_u art e r to F O ur
tion by seizing my watch and vanishing into the
crowd.

“Stop thief!” I shouted, and attempted pursuit.
On account of the jam, however, a successful
pursuit was impossible. After I had overturned
half a dozen pedestrians, and had been tossed
back and forth like a water-logged hulk in the
current, I gave up attempting to recover the
watch and drew out of the press into the ladies’
entrance of the hotel.

While I stood there, panting and bewailing my
loss, a cab pushed up to the curb and a lady
alighted. She was a stout lady, beyond middle
age, and with a motherly face. She was neatly
gowned in black, and her bonnet proved her a
widow, in mourning.
The cabby dismounted from his box and
handed his passenger an old-fashioned carpetbag.
The hotel attaché who looked after the ladies’ en

trance was nowhere to be seen, and the stout

lady surveyed the current of humanity between
her and the hotel door with dismay.
That was a busy day with the cabby, and he
hurriedly mounted his box and drove away, leav

ing his fare on the curb. I ceased deploring the
33

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
loss of my watch, descended the pair of steps that
led to the ladies’ entrance, and pushed my way
through the stream of fruit-growers.

“Do you wish to get into the hotel, madam?”
said I, halting at the stout lady's side.
She lifted her motherly face to mine, forlornly
hopeful.
“If you please, mister,” she answered, a breath
less catch in her voice.

“Sakes alive, what an

awful crowd!”
I took her carpetbag and requested her to take
my arm. Presently we gained the pair of marble
steps and mounted to the hotel door.
“You’re all right now, ma'am,” I observed, in
a cheery tone, returning the carpetbag.
“I’m much obliged to you,” said she grate
fully. “It’s been a long time since I was in a
big town like this, and I’m that flustered with the
noise and bustle I hardly know whether I’m afoot
or horseback. Could you—ah—tell me——”
She faltered, and a scared look crossed her
face.

“If I can do anything more for you,” I said,
“command me.”
“What time is it?”
34

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
She gazed fixedly at me.
“About eleven o’clock,” I returned, wondering
at her stare and her odd manner.

Disappointment ran through the lines of her
face.

“Thank you,” she said, and turned away.
Then I had a most amazing thought.
“It might be a quarter to four,” I called after
her.

-

By then her back was toward me and she was

half-through the door. The carpetbag dropped,
and she clutched at the ornate door-knob to sup
port herself. Another moment and I was beside
her again.
“Have—have you found the others?” she
asked.

“Not yet,” I answered.
“In an hour I'll be in one of the parlors on the
second floor. Will you meet me there?”
“Certainly,” said I.
“I am Mrs. Sarah Brackett,” she added, hesi

tatingly offering her hand.

“And I am Robert Lorry,” I answered, taking
the hand encouragingly.
I picked up the carpetbag for her, and she van
35

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
ished into the marble corridor. So here was one

of my filibusters!
I wanted to laugh at finding myself so far
afield, but was too deeply mystified to treat the
matter lightly. What could I possibly have in
common with that elderly lady?

There was no use bombarding myself with
mental questions. The more I speculated, the
farther I found myself at sea.
Passing through the ladies’ entrance, I trav
ersed the corridor, crossed the reception-room,
and ultimately gained the rotunda. There I
hunted out an unoccupied chair, threw myself in
to it, and continued my reflections.

This initial success was followed quickly by
another. While busy with my thoughts, my eyes
absently followed the people who were coming
and going around me.
A young man fixed my passive attention. He
was slight of form, with carroty hair, buttermilk
eyes, and a wisp of down on his upper lip. His

forehead and chin were of the retreating variety,
giving his face a birdlike contour; in fact, as he
fluttered about the rotunda, he reminded me of a
nervous tomtit.
36

A Q_u arter to F our
His narrow chest and thin legs were incased
in garments of an ultra-fashionable sort. He
wore light-yellow gloves, light-yellow spats, and
carried a rattan cane.

The young man belonged to a class that had
never appealed to me. Yet curiosity pulled me
out of my reflections as I watched him.
Beginning at one end of a row of loungers, he
would flutter to the other end of the row, halt
ing at every third man to bend over and say some
thing. When he passed on, the loungers would
exchange looks and significant grins, and a fore
head would be tapped suggestively.
The young man worked his way nearer to
where I sat. Presently he came close enough
so I could hear what he was saying.
He was asking the time of day, going about
the work with systematic thoroughness and with
utter disregard for appearances! I got up,
stepped over to him, and took him by the arm.
“My friend,” said I, “have you found any one
yet who told you that it was a quarter to four?”
“Found!” he gasped. “By Jove!”
He shifted the rattan from his right to his left
hand and dropped the right hand on my arm.
37

A Q_u a r ter to Four
“Fancy,” he went on, with a vacuous grin, “I
thought it might be a joke.”
As I gazed at him, and thought of the elderly

lady up-stairs in the parlor, I was not altogether
certain that it was not still a joke.
“Have you found the other two?” he whis
pered explosively.
*

“I have found one of them,” I answered.

“I have worked my way through the rotunda
this far,” he proceeded, “and suppose we keep on?
You go to the right and I’ll go to the left,
so—”

“No,” I returned firmly; “before we were half
done an officer would be called in and we'd be car
ried off to some institution for the feeble-minded.

What is your name, my friend?”
“G. Chauncey Vandeleur. And yours?”
“Robert Lorry.”

“I say, Lorry, what's it all about? I haven’t
the least idea, don’t you know.”
“Neither have I,” I responded dryly. “Come

up-stairs with me and I’ll introduce you to the
third person of our distinguished quartet.”
“But, I say,” he demurred, “we’ve got to find
the fourth.”
38

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“The three of us will discuss that point,” I
went on. If this was really a joke, I wanted to
make sure of it and wash my hands of the entire
matter.

-

G. Chauncey Vandeleur followed me to the ele
vator. When we reached the second-floor parlor,
we found Mrs. Sarah Brackett in animated con

versation with a young lady—a slender, hand
some girl of twenty-two, or twenty-three.
As Vandeleur and I came close, Mrs. Brackett

started up with a look of undisguised pleasure.
“Mr. Lorry!” she exclaimed. “Let me make
you acquainted with Miss Zelda Anstruther. I
just asked her what time it was, and she told me”
—here the elderly lady's voice sank to an awe
some whisper—“that it was a quarter to four!”
The color mounted to Miss Anstruther's cheeks

as I gazed at her.
“By Jove!” chirruped Vandeleur. “This is
what I call luck, don’t you know.”
Instantly I revised my opinion as to the whole
affair being a joke. The beautiful Miss An
struther, it may be, was responsible for the re
vision.

CHAPTER IV.

An Odd Enterprise.

This mysterious business had nothing to do
with filibustering, that was sure. A motherly old
lady, a fair slip of a girl, a youth with a simian
facial angle—these three were out of any picture
that had a background of lawlessness on the high
seas or in the southern Americas.

The thought came to me that we were a set of
pink-tea conspirators, brought together, perhaps,
to plan a missionary campaign on the Mosquito
Coast. Yet, even so, Miss Anstruther’s hazel
eyes reconciled me to whatever the fates held in
StOre.

I presented Vandeleur. Mrs. Brackett eyed
him indulgently and sympathetically, Miss An
struther with curiosity and some small amount of
tolerance.

Vandeleur and I seated ourselves.

Finding

that we were alone in the parlor, we at once went
into executive session.

“We have been strangely brought together,”

Page 40.

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
said I, “in pursuance of some design of whose
nature I have not the slightest knowledge. Can
any of you enlighten me?”

Silence followed the query.

Four pairs of

eyes fenced anxiously and fell in disappointment.
“I haven’t the least notion what it's all about,
Mr. Lorry,” spoke up Mrs. Sarah Brackett. “I’m
from Emmetsburg, Ioway, myself, and came on
here because a lawyer by the name of Cart
wright advised me to. Mr. Cartwright couldn't
tell me much. He just handed me two hundred
dollars, said I was to be at the Palace Hotel, in

San Francisco, on the twenty-fifth, and go around
asking what time it was until I had found three
who said it was a quarter to four. I haven’t trav
eled a great deal, and I hate anything that's not
free and aboveboard, so I thought long and hard
before I concluded to take the trip. Mr. Cart
wright said I’d better come. He knew my hus

band, Ezry, and my boy, Tom, and he's always
been a good friend to me, Mr. Cartwright has.”

The wrinkled lips quivered and the faded blue
eyes grew frankly tearful.

Miss Anstruther

drew her chair closer to Mrs. Brackett's and took
one of her hands in both her own.
4I

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“I haven’t got Ezry no more, and I haven’t got
Tom,” continued Mrs. Brackett, leaning toward
the girl; “I’m just a poor old woman with neither
chick nor child I can call my own, and I haven’t
enough money to hardly keep me out of the coun

ty house. That two hundred dollars looked like a
small fortune to me, and I hated to spend it on
what might turn out a wild-goose chase to San
Francisco. But Mr. Cartwright said ‘Come, and
kept saying it, and I didn’t make up my mind till
the last minute.

I’m here, now, and I’m thank

ful to know I didn’t have much trouble asking
that foolish question and getting the foolish an
swers. I wonder if you all felt about it like I
did P”

Miss Anstruther pressed the wrinkled hand she
was holding.
“I am sure I did, Mrs. Brackett,” said she. “I

had waited in this parlor all morning without
courage to put the question. When you came
and asked me the time, I felt as though I was

going to faint.” She smiled a little and barely
glanced in my direction. “Yet,” she went on,
“see how easily our meeting has come about. You
find me, and Mr. Lorry finds Mr. Vandeleur and
42

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
brings him to us.

You have come from Iowa,

Mrs. Brackett, but I have come all the way from
New York, and I had—and still have, for that

matter—as little confidence in the outcome as you
had yourself.

My experience was similar to

yours, too.

“A lawyer wrote and requested me to call upon
him. He gave me two hundred dollars, told me
substantially what your lawyer told you, and I
was several days considering the matter. I am
stenographer for a law firm in Liberty Street—
McMillan & Hays. I laid the matter before Mr.
McMillan, and he advised me to follow the tip,”
as he called it, and see what it amounted to.

If

the business comes to nothing, I am to return to
New York and have my old place back.”

Thereupon I gave my experiences, which paral
leled those of Mrs. Brackett and Miss An

struther. Then we three directed our glances at
Vandeleur.

“Deucedly odd?” exclaimed the young man,
with a smirk at Miss Anstruther which caused

that young lady to avert her eyes. “I live right
here in 'Frisco, don’t you know, and got a letter
from a lawyer chap just like Miss Anstruther
43

A Q_u arter to Four
and Mr. Lorry. I called on him, and was jolly
well surprised when he handed me a wad of
greenbacks and told me to call at the Palace on
the twenty-fifth and go around asking different
people what time it was. Here we all are,
though, and what's to be done?”
The buttermilk eyes fixed themselves on me
shrewdly.
“Did any of you receive a sealed envelope?” I
inquired.
All of us had been wary, it seems, and had
held the matter of the sealed envelope back, wait
ing for a cue to mention it. Straightway four
envelopes, identically alike, were brought into
-

view.

“No doubt,” I proceeded, “these envelopes have
an important bearing upon the case. My lawyer
instructed me that the envelopes were to be
opened when we four came together.”
“Mr. Cartwright said the same thing,” an
nounced Mrs. Brackett.

“And so did the lawyer I visited in New York,”
averred Miss Anstruther.

“My instructions were different,” said Vande
leur. “As soon as we found each other, the law
44

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
yer here said we were to call on him and he
would tell us what to do with our envelopes.”
I reflected upon this point. It was the only de
tail in which our legal advisers had differed.

“Who is your lawyer, "Mr. Vandeleur?” I in
terrogated.
“Mr. Price, of Price, Green & Garnett.”
“Is his office far from here?”
“Not more than two blocks.”

“Would we be likely to find him in his office
now?”

“I’ll call him up on the phone, Mr. Lorry, and
see if he is there.”

-

We soon found that Mr. Price was in his of

fice and would receive us, so we left the hotel im

mediately and called on him. The lawyer was a
big, florid man and met us with a grim smile.
Vandeleur introduced us, and Mr. Price offered
us chairs and closed the door of his private room.
“You all have your envelopes?” he asked. We

produced the envelopes. “Very good,” he went
on; “keep them carefully, and do not let them
get out of your possession for a minute. If one
were lost, this whole proceeding would result in
a fiasco. I cannot tell you what the business is,
45

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
because I do not know. Naturally, however, I
am conversant with a few details, and I know
that a matter of prime importance is for you to
hold fast to your envelopes. I have it, on the
best authority, that this will mean much to you
perhaps a fortune—”
“A fortune!” murmured Mrs. Brackett, start
ing upright in her chair.

“A fortune!” echoed Miss Anstruther, staring.
“By Jove!” exclaimed Vandeleur.
I smiled skeptically.
“Rather an odd way to distribute a fortune,
don’t you think, Mr. Price?” said I.
“Oh, yes,” he answered, “but indirect methods
may be necessary. You four are to charter a sea

going vessel, manned and provisioned for a long
voyage. When you are three days out, on a west
erly course, you will hold a private conference
on the boat, and open your envelopes. Their
contents will give you your destination and other
needful instructions.”

“Charter a vessel!” I cried, startled. “Embark
for a long voyage with only the contents of four
unopened envelopes to warrant the undertaking!”
Mr. Price waved his hand.

46

“I admit it is ask

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
ing a good deal of four people, brought together
in the strange way that you have been,” he vouch
safed. “However, it may be in my power to
give you more confidence in the undertaking.”
He took a paper from a pigeonhole in his desk
and slowly opened it.
“Do any of you know a person named Arthur
Mayhew?” he asked.
“He was my cousin,” I spoke up.
-

“Archibald Anstruther?” pursued the lawyer.
“My brother,” faltered Miss Anstruther. “He
was in the army, and—and disappeared.”
“Thomas Brackett?” intoned the lawyer.
“My—my son,” murmured Mrs. Brackett,
fumbling for her black-bordered handkerchief.
“He was a soldier, too, and killed in Chiny.
Leastways, he hasn’t been heard of for more'n
a year, and—and I’ve given him up.”

“Eugene Trent?” continued the lawyer.
“By Jove!” cried Vandeleur.
mine.

“An uncle of

A fat lot I ever cared for him.”

“If you charter a boat and put to sea,” said
Mr. Price, “the four I have mentioned will be

your authority for so doing. You will know bet
47

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
ter than I whether they would have any intent
to deceive you, or to cause you needless expense.”
Mrs. Brackett and Miss Anstruther had their

handkerchiefs to their eyes. Vandeleur was ab
sently rolling a cigarette. I sat in my chair with
a bewildered brain.

“Where is the money to come from for char
tering the boat, Mr. Price?” I inquired.
“You four will have to settle that question
among you,” he responded. “No funds have been
deposited for that purpose.”
“I haven’t a penny,” came tremulously from
Mrs. Brackett, “but if I am to go somewhere and

find my boy Tom, I will find a way.”
“So will I,” declared Miss Anstruther, with

fine determination, “if my brother is calling for
me to come to him.”

“Uncle 'Gene can go to ballyhack, for all of

me,” grumbled Vandeleur. “I haven’t a cent to
pay for a sea-voyage, anyhow. You said some
thing about a fortune, Mr. Price? By Jove!
that's a different proposition from going it blind
to find Uncle 'Gene.”

“There is a big reward in the business for all
48

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
of you,” reassured the lawyer, “providing you
follow it up.”
“What are we to do?”

Miss Anstruther put the question, and all eyes
appeared to focus on me.
“We shall find a way,” said I. “We will go

back to the hotel for luncheon and discuss ways
and means immediately afterward. You have
nothing more to tell us, Mr. Price?”
“Not a thing, except to say that I wish you all
the good luck imaginable.”
I started out with the others, but the lawyer
called me back. When he and I were alone, and

with the door closed, he took me by a button con
fidentially.
“Your original instructions contemplated the
opening of the envelopes in the hotel here, did
they not, Mr. Lorry?” he queried.
“Yes,” I answered.

“I took it upon myself to change that. Van
deleur, I find, has not a very good character. All
this complicated machinery, which you think so
odd and uncalled for, was ingeniously devised to
keep one of you four from obtaining an advan

tage over the other, and using it unfairly. If the
49

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
envelopes are opened at sea, Vandeleur, if so dis
posed, can do nothing to backcap your plans. Do
you rise to that?”
“I think so,” said I.

“There are two estimable ladies in your party,
if I am any judge of character, and it will fall
upon you, Mr. Lorry, as the most able and re
sourceful, to safeguard the ladies’ interests.
Keep an eye on Vandeleur, that's all.”
“You have nothing more to tell me—pri
vately?”
“No. I wish, on my soul, that I knew more,
but I don't.”

“Do you know of any one who would care to
advance money for chartering a ship, receiving
back twice over the amount invested?”

Once more he smiled grimly.
“I do not,” he returned. “It would be a pre
carious investment, this putting up expenses for
a quartet of rainbow-chasers.”
“But you said—”
“Never mind what I said. I read off to you
certain names, and those names impressed the
four of you. You and your three companions
know the persons named, and that should give
50

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
you confidence, but it would hardly impress an
outsider.”

With that he bid me a good day, and I left his
office. I had been sadly tangled on leaving the
Chamber of Commerce Building, after my inter
view with Mr. Benson; but that state of mind
wasn’t a circumstance to the one I carried with

me on leaving Mr. Price.

51

CHAPTER V.

An Unexpected Assault.
This, then, was the condition of affairs: To
go forward in the strange business that had
brought us to San Francisco, we must have
money—enough to charter a boat for a long
cruise.

Our star-chamber session in the parlor of the
Palace Hotel, immediately after luncheon, de
veloped the very important fact that Vandeleur
had no funds and no credit.

From what Mrs.

Brackett had said, indirectly, I knew that she
could be of no financial help, and Miss Anstruther
assured me tearfully that she was in like circum
StanceS.

That placed the brunt of it at my door, and
sent my thoughts eastward to Uncle Rufus and
to my patrimony that had been gathering bulk
through the years. Should I hazard my all on a
lawyer's word that my cousin, Arthur Mayhew,
vouched for the enterprise?
I had never seen Arthur Mayhew more than
52

A Q_u art e r to F O u r
once in my life. He had lived in the Middle
West, whither my relatives on the spindle side
had emigrated, and a well-earned reputation for
being “wild” had restrained Uncle Rufus from
inviting him to Great Barrington.
When I was seventeen, however,

Arthur

dropped in on us without an invitation. He was
two years my senior, had beaten his way over a
good part of the world, and I liked him im
mensely. But he was a good deal of a rake, and

Uncle Rufus packed him off before he had been
with us a fortnight.
The instinct of a soldier of fortune pushed me
toward the risk.

What were a few thousands

compared with an adventure that promised ex

citement and much gain? That would draw Miss
Anstruther and myself into close companionship
for several months?

-

*

This latter consideration had a good deal of

weight with me. From what little I had seen of
the girl, I liked her immensely.
We were, of course, taking the word of Mr.
-

Price for everything. And Mr. Price was not
only as ignorant as ourselves of the object of the
53

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
undertaking, but his optimism would not carry
him the length of taking stock in it.
By some psychological turn, Mrs. Brackett and
Miss Anstruther had formed the conviction that
the former's son and the latter's brother were to
be found at the end of this weird coil.

Hence

they were feverishly eager to embark and put to
SC3.

According to Vandeleur, Eugene Trent was
skipper of the two-hundred-ton brigantine Ga
aelle. He was a “shady” mariner, and although
San Francisco was his home port, the Gazelle
had not been seen in the bay for three years.
Vandeleur would have tramped barefoot around
the world to get any money Uncle 'Gene had
left, but he would not have walked around the
block to discover whether Uncle 'Gene were alive
or dead.
Before our afternoon conference came to an

end, I offered to charter and provision a small
seagoing boat, if one could be had on reasonable
terms. I added, however, that it would possibly
be a fortnight before I could get at my money,
and suggested that we remove to some respect
able but less pretentious hotel, where the charges
54

A Q_u a r ter to Four
would be more in keeping with our circum
StanceS.

-

Miss Anstruther looked her gratitude, and
Mrs. Brackett caught my hand and thanked me
tremulously. There was a fortune to be gained,
said Miss Anstruther, and my three companions
would see that I was well repaid for the pre
liminary outlay.
Miss Anstruther also suggested that, inasmuch
as I was to finance the enterprise, the entire man
agement should be left in my hands. I should be
their leader, and they would trust every detail
to me implicitly.
Mrs. Brackett heartily agreed to this, but Van
deleur balked.

I have an idea that he wanted to

captain our undertaking himself.
In proof of their confidence, Mrs. Brackett and
Miss Anstruther offered me their envelopes for
safe-keeping. I demurred, but they insisted.
Finally I yielded, asking only that each write her
name across the flap of the envelope before giv
ing it to me.
Vandeleur watched this proceeding with frank
disapproval. Then, of a sudden, his attitude
changed, and he averred fulsomely that the ladies
55

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
had done exactly the right thing. A man, he as
serted, was better able to safeguard the important
documents than a woman; and if I could take
care of three of the envelopes, certainly he could
take care of one of them.

Vandeleur stated further that he had some ac
quaintance with seafarers of the “Barbary
Coast,” and could introduce me to just the skip
per we wanted for our requirements.
I was liking Vandeleur less and less the more
I saw of him. I thanked him a bit curtly for his
offer, averring that I had some acquaintance on
the “Coast” myself, and would begin that very
evening looking for a man to help us.

That afternoon we began lopping off expenses
by removing to a modest but entirely respectable
hotel in Kearney Street; and by eight in the eve
ning I had started for the water-front, with one
“Logy” Bill in my mind's eye.
Logy Bill, I suppose, stood for about all that
was bad in one of the worst quarters of that
metropolis. But I had pulled Logy Bill clear of
a stout sailorman armed with a dirk, some years
before, and Bill had sworn undying friendship
on the strength of it.
56

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
I knew Logy Bill could help me find a proper
skipper and a proper boat. His positive power
for evil was as great as his negative power for
good, and I was going to approach him on his
negative side. Bill would tell me which skipper
was to be relied on, and which was not, and from

the former class I would pick the man I wanted.
It was an early hour for the water-front, yet
darkness had settled down and I was sufficiently
wary to keep the middle of the road. Hulls and
masts rose starkly from the mirk that edged the
wharves as I reached the “Front” and turned

along the “Coast.”
Dull lights shone through the windows of
sailor-robbing dens, but, for the most part, the
dens were steeped in prophetic silence. They
would waken into raucous life later on, and by
that time I hoped to have accomplished my mis
sion and to be back to Kearney Street.
Presently I came to the squat little house where
I had once sat out a reminiscent evening and
smoked half a dozen pipes with Logy Bill.
Mounting the gloomy veranda, I rapped on the
door. The summons was answered by a frowsy
looking Chinaman.
57

A

Q_u arter

to F O u r

“Mr. Williams at home?” I inquired.
Lamplight, from somewhere back of the China
man, cast a glow over the veranda. The slant
eyes gave me a catlike sizing.
“What manner fashion you come, hey?” in
quired the domestic, with elaborate care. “Why
you wantee Logy Bill?”
“Me all same friend, savvy? Is Bill in the
house?”
“Him not in house.”
“Where is he?”

“Plaps ovel town, plaps makee bizness up stleet.
No can tell.”
“Will he be back Soon?”
“NO can tell.”

“I makee one-piecee paper-talk, you givee Bill.
Savvy?”
“Can do.”
With that I scribbled a line on the blank leaf

of a note-book, requesting Logy Bill to call on
me at my Kearney Street headquarters the fol

lowing morning. The Chinaman took the note
and closed the door, and I stumbled from the ve

randa, half-blinded by the sudden shutting off
of the lamplight.
58

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
Twenty feet brought me opposite the mouth of
an alley. My eyesight cleared suddenly, and I be
came aware that a man had leaped out of the
blackness of the alley and was standing in front
of me.

The fellow stood stiffly erect, barring my path.
Without a word, I attempted to go around him,
but he shifted his position.
“What do you want?” I demanded.
For answer, his right fist darted toward me.
Expecting a hostile move, I jumped back and
evaded the fist.

Thereupon two arms went around me from be

hind, pinning my hands to my body. The en
circling arms were like steel, and the pressure
they exerted drove the breath from my lungs.
On leaving Kearney Street, I had had the fore
thought to slip a revolver into my pocket, but the
attack from behind had come before I could get
at the weapon. Instantly I began a fierce strug
gle, kicking at my captor's shins and wriggling
like an eel to free myself.
“Git the letters,” came a husky and impatient
voice from behind; “the's three of 'em.”
Being thus apprised of the object of the at
59

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
tack, my desperate struggle became more fierce
and determined. I yelled as I fought.
The man behind cursed me roundly.
“Put a stopper on 'is jaw-tackle,” he panted.
“Look alive, now !”

A clean-cut, smashing blow on the side of my
face dazed me. My limbs went limp for a few
moments, and I lay like a sack of meal in the
arms that held me.

The man in front bent over, fumbling at the
breast of my coat. Strength rushed back to me
then, and I lifted my feet and planted them in the
pit of the fellow's stomach.

The rogue fell away, staggering and catching
his breath. The other man flung me to the
ground with an oath, and I saw him jerk a knife
from his pocket.
Before the knife could fall, a third form
lurched out of the darkness, and I heard the

sodden impact of a fist, followed by the clatter of
a blade on the stones.

60

CHAPTER VI.
A Timely Arrival.
I was on my knees when the two who had at
tacked me pulled themselves together and took to

their heels. The man whose timely appearance
had turned the tide came close and lifted me to

my feet.
“A tight squeak, mate,” he volunteered, “but

things like that are happenin here continual.
Web-foot?”

“Well, if it isn't Logy Bill himself!” I ex
claimed, recognizing the hairy, thick-set dump
ling of a man who was ranged alongside of me.
“I think we're square now, Bill,” I added, gro

ping for my breast pocket and making sure the
three envelopes were safe.
“Dashed if it ain't Bob Lorry!” Williams
thrust out his hand. “Whenever did you blow
into 'Frisco, Lorry? And whatever are ye doing
around here?”

“Let’s go back to your house, Bill, and I'll tell
you. I’ve a little business on hand and want your
61

A Q_u a r t e r to F our
help. In fact, I was just leaving your place when
those two swabs ran afoul of me.”

“Did they lift any plunder belonging to you?”
“No, you arrived in time to prevent that.
Lucky thing for me that you—”
“Stow it! I'm glad I happened around. It
was that yell o' your’n that fetched me.”
Williams was usually a man of slow and de
liberate movement, as befitted one of his build,
but he had been quick enough that night. We
got back in the house, and the Chinaman brought
a wet towel for my bruised face and served us
with cigars; he also gravely presented his mas
ter with the note I had left.

Williams spelled the written words through
carefully.

“By coming when I did,” he remarked.

“I

reckon I saved myself a trip to Kearney Street.”
“You did more than that, Bill,” I averred; “you
kept me out of the morgue.”

“That's as maybe, Lorry. Ye know the ropes
hereabouts, so it's sort o' humorous seeing ye
caught like that.”

-

“Your idea of humor doesn't exactly jibe with
my own, Bill,” I laughed.
62

A Q_u arter to Four
For half an hour we chatted on various gen
eral topics, and then, as we lighted fresh cigars,
I broached the business I had in mind.

“What I want, Bill,” said I, “is to charter a

good, seaworthy little boat. The skipper must be
straight, and a man I can depend on.”
“The sort o’ skippers I deal with are gen'rally
a bit off-color,” he grinned, “although the best of
'em don't object to a shanghaied man or two in
the fo'c'sle. Where is this craft ye want to go?”
“I won’t be able to tell that until we’re two

or three days at sea.”
He looked at me with his bulletlike eyes
a-twinkle.

“And still ye're after a good, clean skipper!

with an idee that you're shady and’ll bear watch

“It’s honest business, nevertheless,” I persisted.
“You ought to know me well enough to be sure
of that, Williams.”

“How long a v'yage :

he asked speculatively.

A Q_u a r ter to Four
“Several months—I can’t tell exactly.”
Logy Bill smoked and reflected.
“Any skipper,” he commented finally, “who'll
undertake such a v’yage will have a yaller streak
in him some’rs. That's something you got to ex
pect, Lorry, and guide yourself according. Any
passengers besides yourself?”

“Four passengers, all told. Two are ladies,
and I want good accommodations for them.”
He raised his bushy eyebrows and gave me a
queer look.
“When I say ladies,” I went on, “I mean ex
actly that.”
“I reckon you know your business, Lorry, and
I ain’t no hand to pry into things as don’t con
cern me; but petticoats is pretty much in the way
on everything but liners and yachts. Small boats,
like what you want, not having no passenger li
cense, these here ladies'll sign on as stewardesses,
I take it, and you and t'other man will go as
fourth and fifth mates?”

“Something like that, I suppose.”

“That's easy fixed. The ladies being along,
that ought to satisfy any skipper you ain’t up

to anything unlawful. Still, it's a handicap leav

How’ll the papers read?”

“They can read “Honolulu. We head westerly
on leaving the Gate.”
“I’ll send you some one in a day or two. You
can take the skipper's measure, hire him if you
want to, and, if you don’t want to, turn him down,
and I’ll have another try.”
In this way, that part of the business was set
tled. I stayed with Williams an hour longer, and,
when I left, my friend accompanied me as far
as Market Street.

Late as it was when I

got back to the hotel,

I wrote and posted a letter to Uncle Rufus, re
questing an immediate draft for the funds of
mine which he had in his keeping.

Then, when I turned in, I gave serious thought
to the principal event of the evening. Two men
had waylaid me and made an attempt to get the
three envelopes I was carrying in my pocket.
How did those two men know I had the enve

lopes, and why was the attack made?
There was but a single answer, embraced in
the one word: “Vandeleur.” Beyond all doubt,
65

,

A Q_u arter to Four

G. Chauncey Vandeleur was proving true to Mr.
Price's estimate of him.

I recalled Vandeleur's sudden change of front
after Mrs. Brackett and Miss Anstruther had

passed me their envelopes. Then and there was
born his design to secure the three documents, at
one stroke, add the three to the fourth, which he
himself carried, and thus have the entire matter
in his own hands.

Vandeleur had been quick to act. I would not
have believed that his retreating forehead hid
so much resourcefulness. Courage in the deed
there was none; merely a snakelike craftiness in
persuading others to his lawless will.
Yes, Vandeleur was a man to be reckoned with.
Whatever the sea-business that was to claim our

attention, clearly it would take the contents of
the four envelopes to make it understandable.
One envelope would not do, nor two envelopes,

nor three. The mystery was divided in quarters.
iFour quarters made the whole, and the whole
would give the solution.
In that hour I gave mental deference to the
one who had devised the scheme for giving each
66

A Q_u a r ter to

Four

of us four what might be our just due. To suc
ceed, we must all work together.
It would be impossible for me to call Vande
leur to account for the night’s work. If he
needed our envelopes, it was none the less true
that we needed his envelope. No, the fellow must
be borne with somehow until the four envelopes
had worked out the theoretical part of our prob
lem. During the practical demonstration of it
I could handle him without gloves.
Perhaps it was three o'clock when I went to
sleep. If I am not mistaken, that was the hour
chimed by a distant bell before I dozed off.
When I awoke, it was a bluff knock on the door

that brought me upright in my bed. The sun
flooded the room; and, in a moment, that far

away clock began tolling the hour.
My last waking memories were of that bell. I
counted the strokes: one, two, three, and so on

up to eleven. Evidently I had secured my proper
allotment of sleep.
The last echo of the bell was taken up by re

peated clamor at the door.

“Who's there?” I

demanded, getting my feet on the floor.

“Boy from the office, sir,” came the response.
67

A Q_u arter

to F O u r

“Gentleman to see you—he's waiting down
stairs.”
“Who is he?”

“Captain Golden, sir. He says Mr. Williams
sent him.”

“Tell Captain Golden that I'll be down in a
few minutes,” said I.

Logy Bill had been active enough in finding
a skipper for me.
“Captain Golden, eh?” I said to myself, as I

got into my clothes. “That name is a good omen
for a quartet of fortune-hunters, I must say.”

68

CHAPTER VII.

A Search for a Ship.
When I reached the office, the boy led me
to an out-of-the-way corner, where Captain Gold
en was waiting. He was puffing at one of those
long, crudely rolled weeds which pass by the name
of “stogies.” As I approached, he pulled the

stogy from between his teeth and got slowly to
his feet.

I found him some six feet of a man, in a dingy
cap, worn blue pilot-cloth coat with brass but
tons, dungaree trousers, and sea-boots. Judging
from his rig, his last voyage had not been pros
perous.

The captain and I surveyed each other as the
distance lessened between us. Following a first

comprehensive look, my eyes sought his face and
dwelt there.

It was a lean, strong face, brown and weather
beaten as became a man of the sea. A green

patch covered the left eye. The other eye was
steel-blue and glistening-keen enough, appar
69

A Q_u a r ter to Four
ently, to do service for itself and its defunct mate.
In the forehead, above the green patch, there was
a dent not at all pretty to look at.
A red, torpedo beard bristled from the lower

jaw. The hair, overlong and fringing the bottom
of the cap, was of even a more pronounced red
than the beard.

“Red hair for fighters,” was my mental com
ment.

“It’s not difficult to account for that miss

ing eye, or the concavity above it.” Then, aloud:
“Captain Golden?” I queried.
“The same,” he returned, extending a hand
that carried but three fingers and a thumb.
“You’re Mr. Robert Lorry, I take it?”
“Exactly.”
I looked around. The boy had disappeared,
and we could be quite by ourselves in the corner.
I drew up a chair as the skipper seated himself.
“You come from Mr. Williams, I understand?”

“That's the idea, as the man says.

He said

you wanted to hire a boat.”
“I do. What sort of a boat have you?”

“The Lady May, finest two-sticker that ever
sailed out o’ 'Frisco. Jam 'er on the wind an’
7o

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
she'll show her heels to anything under canvas,
as the man says.”
“What's her size?”

“Hunnerd an’ fifty tons.”
“Where is she?”
“Alongside o pier twelve, on the ‘Front.’”
“What’s her condition?”

“Jest been cleaned, painted, an overhauled.

Everything spick an’ span from truck to keelson.
She was sealin', last trip, but she'll never go ag’in.
I been two months gettin’ the smell out o’ her.
She's as sweet as a rose now, an I ain’t afeared

to show 'er to nobody.”
“I’ll pay her a visit at one o’clock, captain. If
the boat suits me, we'll go into matters a little,
and perhaps we can do business.”
“Right-o,” answered Captain Golden. “Pier
twelve is the place, and you’ll find me aboard
when you get there.”
He touched a match to the end of his stogy,
got under weigh, and rolled the length of the
office and out at the door. He talked fair enough,
and had the look of a skipper who knew how to
do things.
Having missed breakfast, I was among the
71

A Q_u a r ter to Four
first to go in to dinner when the dining-room
doors were thrown open. Style, and a scale of
prices to match, make all the difference between
a light repast at noon and a square meal, and
what was “luncheon” at the Palace was a regular
“dinner” there in Kearney Street.
I had finished and left the hotel before Mrs.
Brackett and Miss Anstruther came into the di

ning-room. It was just as well. When I next
saw the ladies, perhaps I could report that a skip
per and a boat had been secured.
I had no difficulty in picking up the Lady May,
even before I had seen the gilt lettering across
the stern. She lay at her moorings softly rubbing
her fenders against the planks.
Approaching from the south, and before turn
ing upon the pier, I was able to take in the craft's
length and height along the starboard side. She
was dazzlingly fresh in a coat of new paint, her
decks were scrubbed to snowy whiteness, her
stays whipped and tarred, masts and booms new
slushed, brasswork glittering, and all running
gear coiled down trimly.
From stem to taffrail, I should judge that she
measured full ninety feet. She had a bow like a
72

A Q_u a r ter to Four
knife's edge, and a run that seemed incapable
of drawing a bucketful of dead water after it in
a day's sail.
Her masts were raking, and so high that I
thought the schooner must be crank. A glance
at the beam, however, dispelled the impression.
I strolled along and gained the pier, my gaze
still traveling over the boat. I was already in
love with her, and hoped in my soul that Captain
Golden and I might come to terms.
“My best girl, Mr. Lorry,” called a voice.
“What do you think o' her?”
I looked around, and saw the skipper standing

at the top of a gangplank, aft.
“She’s as pretty as a belle in her best bib and
tucker,” I answered heartily.
“She was a gentleman's yacht once, before she
fell into my hands an’ took to trading. Come
aboard, sir.

I’ve been over her with a tooth

brush, an’ she'll stand close inspection.”
I crossed the plank, and Captain Golden led
me to the fo'c'sle, where the inspection began.
The fo'c'sle was a commodious place, with twelve
bunks—six on a side, in two tiers.

“What's her complement, captain?” I inquired.
73

A Q_u a r ter to F O ur
“Master, mate, six hands, cook, an’ cabin-boy.”
On our way aft from the fo'c'sle we had a look
in at the galley, and then descended the after
companion to the cabin. This latter room was a
marvel of bird’s-eye maple, gilt, and mahogany.
The captain’s room and mate's room opened
off the port side of the cabin, while two doors to
starboard led to staterooms. The staterooms,
naturally, were small, yet each was neatly fur
nished and had double berths.

-

Such an undue proportion of cabin space, for
ward and aft, bespoke the yacht. As the captain
and I seated ourselves for a business talk, I no

ticed a rack against the cabin bulkhead with half
a dozen Wincester rifles.

“You’re well armed, Captain Golden,” I ob
served, my gaze dropping from the rack to the
skipper’s glittering blue eye.
“As the man says,” he answered, with a slight
grin, “it’s always well for the after-guard to be
prepared for emergencies. I never go hunting
for trouble, but you can bet I’m always prepared
an’ don’t dodge any.”
“Did Logy Bill tell you anything about the sort

of cruise we're going to start on?”
74

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“Nary a whisper. Where are you going, and
how long do you expect to be gone?”
“I don’t know where I am going”—the blue eye

flickered and half-closed—“and, consequently, I
can’t tell how long we'll be gone.”
“Most remarkable,” was Golden's dry response.
“Do you happen to know, Mr. Lorry, whether
your business is straight or crooked?”
I straightened stiffly.
“Beggin' your pardon, an no offense meant,”
went on Golden. “Mayhap you know Logy Bill's
reputation? He sent me to you—don't forget
that.”

“It’s honest work, Captain Golden,” said I
sharply. “Boats have sailed under sealed orders
before, I take it, and haven’t done anything pi
ratical, either.”

“Sealed orders!” he exclaimed, sucking in his
breath and his eye glimmering. “So that's the
lay of it, hey? When do you open your orders?”

“Three days westward of the Gate.”
“That's different. I draw the line at pearlin’
among Jap islands, or smuggling Chinks or pop
py-juice into the States, or arms an ammunition
out of it. If it's straight goods, and only a mat
75

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
ter o' learning our destination three days out,
why, as the man says, I'm your huckleberry.
Long v’yage?”
“Several months, possibly.”

“That suits me uncommon. The longer the
time the bigger the lay. Any passengers besides
yourself?”
“Three, two of them ladies.”
He jumped at that, and began to look dubious.
“Mebby you know how it is at sea, Mr. Lorry,”
he observed. “Now an ag’in we have to use lan
guage which the hands for’ard’ll understand.
Think the ladies'll object to that?”
“Give them personally all the consideration you
can,” said I, “and I think they will be satisfied.”

This point covered, we fell to debating terms.
At the end of half an hour we had reached an

agreement.

I was to give Captain Golden one hundred and
fifty dollars a month for the use of the boat, pay
the wages of master, mate, and crew, pay for
towing, pilotage, harbor-dues, and other inciden
tals, provision the craft for six months, and hand
over one thousand dollars advance-money inside
of two weeks. Nothing further was to be done
76

A Q_u a r ter to Four
by Captain Golden until the preliminary payment
was in his hands.

He looked askance at the delay until I ex
plained that the money was to come from the
East. We drained a glass to the success of our
cruise, and parted good friends.

I was mightily pleased, and tried to find Will
iams and learn something about Golden's past
history; but Williams was abroad, and I turned
my steps toward Kearney Street.
When I got back to the hotel, I found Vande

leur waiting for me in the office. He came for
ward, handling his cane nervously, and with
something like anxiety in his shifty eyes. Dis
sembling my real feelings, I greeted him amiably.
“I have a suggestion to make, Mr. Lorry,” said
he, seemingly relieved by my show of friendli
116SS.

“What is it?”

“Suppose you give me those three envelopes
and let me take all four over to Mr. Price's office

and have him put them in his safe?”

It was artlessly said. The fellow's simplicity
might have deceived me had it not been for the
events of the night before.
77

A Q_u art e r to Four
“Those envelopes are as safe in my pocket as
they are in Mr. Price's safe, Mr. Vandeleur,” I
assured him. “I shall always go armed, you
know,” I finished, dropping my voice, “while I
have them about me. I know how to shoot, too,
if any one tries foul play.”
His face paled a little, and the rattan quivered
in his yellow-gloved hand. His next move was a
puzzle.
Reaching into the breast of his coat, he took
out his envelope. For a moment he held it and
looked at it, then presented it to me.
“If I’ve got the right of this thing, Mr. Lorry,”
he said, “one envelope is of no earthly use with
out the other three. You might just as well keep
the lot. If the ladies can trust you, I ought to be
able to.”

“All right, Mr. Vandeleur,” I acquiesced, “if

you want it that way.”
“You will open them—” he hesitated, per
haps wondering whether I would take it upon
myself to get at the contents of the envelopes at
Once.

“When we have been three days at sea,” said I.
Again he appeared relieved.
78

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“Have you done anything toward getting a
boat?” he inquired.
“I have chartered the Lady May, a hundred
and-fifty-ton schooner, Captain Nathan Golden.”
His head was bent and he was rapping his cane
aimlessly against one of his shoes.
“Do you know anything about Captain Gold
en?” he went on.

“He comes to me well recommended, and cer

tainly his schooner is all that we could desire.”
Relief again. Vandeleur had not the knack of
hiding his feelings.
“How long do you think it will be before we
get to sea?”
“Some time within two weeks.”

With that I excused myself and went up to my
room.

Vandeleur was a riddle, and I wanted to

get away by myself while I gave some thought
to his particular case.
Once inside my room I locked the door, threw
off coat and vest, filled and lighted a pipe, and
laid the four mysterious envelopes on a table.
Vandeleur, I knew as well as I knew that I was

alive, was back of that attempt to get the three
envelopes away from me. Failing in that, he had
79

A Q_u art e r to F O u r
just come at me, schoolboy fashion, with the re
quest that I give him the envelopes to take to Mr.
Price for safe-keeping. And when he had failed
in that, he had given me his own document to
keep with the others.
Bending over the envelopes, I compared them.
They were all of a size, identical in color and ap
parently made out of the same kind of paper.
Yet there was a difference—hard to detect, but

it did not escape me. The three envelopes be
longing to Mrs. Brackett, Miss Anstruther, and
myself all bore the same water-mark; Vande
leur's envelope bore another.
Now, I might have been well within my rights
—being honorably disposed and with the inter
ests of my companions at heart—if I had opened
the envelopes and learned our destination. Such
a proceeding, however, would have a tendency to
discredit me with Mrs. Brackett and Miss An

struther; besides, I hated to trust myself with
the knowledge contained in the envelopes before
we got to Sea.

I went the length, however, of opening Van
deleur's envelope. It contained simply a piece of
blank paper! By holding the other envelopes be
8O

A Q_u a r t e r to F our
tween my eye and the window, I could see that
they held written enclosures.
Vandeleur still had his original envelope, and
had tried to fool me by giving me a dummy.
Why?

For nothing less, I imagined, than to parry any
suspicions I might cherish against him on account

of that futile night attack. There was a lack of
will shown in his retreating chin, and mental de
ficiencies might be argued from his retreating
forehead. Nevertheless, he was playing a cool
game, and he was playing it craftily, deliberately,
and well.

My cue was to let him think he had pulled the
wool entirely over my eyes. After the third day
out, he would find that I had been keeping a rod
in pickle for him.
My worry concentrated about this one point:
that Vandeleur might, in some way, let the en
velope given him by Mr. Price get out of his
possession. If he held onto that, I was sure I
could handle the rest of it.

CHAPTER VIII.
Sealed Orders.

Eight days of uneasiness followed.

Mrs.

Brackett's and Miss Anstruther's serenity was
ruffled by the mystery that hedged about our un
dertaking, and by a suspense of hopes and fears
that had mainly to do with their relatives, but my
own doubts reached farther, and I kept them in
ignorance of the cause.

There was always Vandeleur, of course, to fret
me; and as the days passed.without a letter, I be
gan to have forebodings about Uncle Rufus and
the funds. Uncle Rufus had labored hard to keep
my patrimony intact and conservatively invested,
yet what if, in spite of his vigilance, the money
had been invested and lost?

Every day I had several hours' conversation
with Mrs. Brackett and Miss Anstruther.

To

cheer and distract their thoughts, I took them for
little excursions about the city—to the parks, to
Chinatown, to the theaters, to inspect the Lady
May.
82

A Q_u arter to Four
I will not deny that I took rare comfort in
Miss Anstruther's society, that I came to look

forward to these brief excursions, and to enjoy
them in spite of the many matters I had to harass
me.

I had been drawn toward Miss Anstruther

from the first, and the realization that my heart
was trending inevitably in her direction came to
me suddenly.
Vandeleur likewise paid Miss Anstruther his
attentions. It was this fact, I think, that brought
me to an abrupt understanding of my own feel
ings.
Miss Anstruther seldom discriminated between
Vandeleur and me.

Sometimes I was her escort

and Vandeleur piloted Mrs. Brackett, and some
times it was the other way around. Yet, gradu
ally and in spite of my attempt to keep it hidden,
the breach widened between Vandeleur and my
self.

On the evening of the eighth day of our proba
tion in Kearney Street I received a letter from
Uncle Rufus, and had the satisfaction of finding
a draft for seven thousand dollars enclosed.

The

greater part of my worry at once took wings, al
83

A Q_u a r t e r to F O ur
though Uncle Rufus’ letter was something to
make a man think.

The old gentleman implored me to leave my
wandering life, interlarding his supplication with
passages from Scripture; he admonished me not
to waste my substance in risk and adventure, but
to settle down, engage in some Christian business,
and make myself a credit to the community which
should finally claim me. He deplored the fact
that my cousin Arthur's career had been such as
to appeal to my roaming nature and lead to emu
lation, and he offered a dire prophecy of priva
tion, and worse, should I fail to heed his final
words.

Uncle Rufus was in poor health, and did not
believe that he was long for this world. His
brother Jeremiah had been killed in the Boxer
uprising in China; and, while the missionary had
been a martyr to the Christian faith, and Uncle
Rufus gloried in it, yet the blow had been a hard
O116.

Shall I admit it? There were tears in my eyes
as I put aside the good man's letter.
I had laid a course directly contrary to his ad
vice, and I was risking every dollar I had in the
84

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
world on a single throw.

More than that, my

cousin Arthur was at the root of the venture.

That was an unpleasant night I passed, but I
arose with determination unshaken. My first
move was to acquaint my companions with the
fact that our venture was ready for launching.
Then I hurried to find Captain Golden, and for
two days we were more than busy.
Stores were purchased and hustled off to the

Lady May by the dray-load. The crew were got
aboard, and the blood sang in my veins as I
watched sailors and stevedores trample the
schooner’s white decks and stow her cargo. On
the second day after that draft had wrought its
magic, Mrs. Brackett and Miss Anstruther came
aboard with their luggage, Vandeleur following
later.

The tide turned at eight in the evening, and
we were to go out with it. A little after six
o'clock, Logy Bill hove alongside and beckoned
me to the pier.
“Ready for the start, are ye?” he asked, lead
ing me a little apart and dropping his voice.
“All ready,” I answered complacently.
“What d'ye think of Cap'n Golden?”
85

A Q_u arter to Four
“He looks to me like a man I can depend on.”
“He looked that way to me, Lorry, or I’d never
have sent him to ye. Reckon he knows that dude
who's takin' the trip with ye?”
“Why,” said I, with a start and a quick look
at my companion, “Golden hasn’t said anything
about it, and neither has Vandeleur.”

“Well, I just got it pretty straight that them
two have been thick as sardines in a box for the

past couple o’ days. You know your own busi
ness, Lorry, and if what I tell ye is any news,
you can turn it over in your block. As I said at
the start-off, any skipper who'd deal with you
would have a yaller streak in him some’rs.”
“You don’t know anything to Golden’s dis
credit?”

“Not a thing, and not a thing to his credit,
either, if it comes to that. But the mate's a whole

sailor, and a man. Stubbs, his name is, and you
can count on him to do what's white in all

weathers. Just remember that.”
Captain Golden was leaning over the rail, star

ing at us. Williams saw him, mentioned the cir
cumstance sotto voce, wrung my hand, wished
me luck, and went away.
86

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
Later, when the wharf-houses began to fade
in the dusk, and the city lights twinkled out on
the hills, I leaned over the after-rail while the

tug raced us down the harbor.

There was I, with my all wrapped up in a risky
venture, with two women under convoy, with un
known business and an unknown port ahead, with
one known enemy in my party, and with a final
doubt inspired as to the schooner's captain!

When was I to see San Francisco again? And
was I to return victor, or vanquished?
The mate was bawling orders within a few
yards of me, and the hands were scrambling
about alow and aloft sweating out the canvas.
I gave no attention to the orderly disorder of sea
manship, but continued to lean over the rail and
watch the passing lights.
A hand touched my arm.
“Mr. Lorry!” murmured a voice.
“Miss Anstruther!” I exclaimed.
She leaned on the rail beside me.

“Of what

are you thinking?” she asked softly.
I was silent.

“Perhaps I know,” she went on, her voice
a-quiver with feeling. “You are thinking of your
87

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
responsibilities, wondering whether you are do
ing right in taking Mrs. Brackett and myself
away, you know not where, and exposing us to
unforeseen dangers. You have risked a good
deal of money, too, and—pardon me for saying
it—I do not think it is money you could afford
to lose.

“As for Mrs. Brackett and myself, Mr. Lorry,
we accompany you of our own free will. We
have nothing but gratitude for your generosity
and kindness. More than that, you will not find
that we are a drag upon you. We are prepared
to face bravely whatever comes. As for myself,
may I ask you to be entirely frank with me con
cerning our difficulties? Will you let me share
the anxieties that are bound to come?

“Oh, I know what you think! You think I am
a woman, and ought to be spared the mental wor
ries and the hardships; but, Mr. Lorry, I am
capable of bearing my full part, and I insist that

you let me do it. Will you?”
While I doubted the policy of the step she sug

gested, yet there was no gainsaying her.
“After we have been three days at sea, Miss
Anstruther,” said I, “and the business of our ex
88

A Q_u a r t e r to F our
pedition unfolds itself more tangibly, I shall be
happy to take you into my full confidence, and
to look to you for advice. Two heads are wiser
than one, you know,” I smiled, “and really you
are the only one of our party with whom I should
care to counsel.”

If she felt surprise because my words gave
Vandeleur the cold shoulder, she gave no evi
dence of it. Her small hand fluttered whitely
toward me in the dusk; as I gently clasped it in
my big palm, she said softly:
“Thank you, thank you ever so much! Now,
please, do not worry about Mrs. Brackett and me.
I have passed several sleepless nights because it
was your money that financed this queer under
taking, and because I feared you might lose it;
but I am quite easy in my mind now, Mr. Lorry.
Somehow, the conviction has crept over me that
our expedition is to prove a grand success, and
that you have merely cast your bread upon the
waters.”

Her hand lingered in mine until she had fin
ished speaking, then she withdrew it, bade me a
hasty “Good night,” and fluttered like a wraith
down the after-companion.
89

CHAPTER IX.

A Protesting Voice.
Midnight saw us well up on the Farallones, the
Lady May dancing prettily through the open sea.
Not until then did I go below and turn in.
Vandeleur and I had one of the staterooms.

He had appropriated the lower berth and was
snoring loudly.
Although the quarters were cramped, and the
staggering of the ship threw me around some
what while I was disrobing, yet I managed to
get into my blankets without waking my room
mate. The three envelopes I took to bed with
me, merely to be on the safe side.
That first night must have been one of horror
for Mrs. Brackett. The poor old lady had never
been on a boat before, and her discomforts be

gan early.
“She'll be all right when she gets used to it,
mum,” grinned Captain Golden, addressing Miss
Anstruther, and referring to Mrs. Brackett, who
was not able to leave her stateroom.
90

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
We were at breakfast in the cabin, the four

of us—Miss Anstruther, Vandeleur, the skipper,
and myself. Vandeleur sat at Golden’s right, and
I at his left; Miss Anstruther was at Vandeleur's
side of the board, and the vacant chair beside me

was reserved for Mrs. Brackett. Opposite the
captain's end of the table was the mate's place.
Stubbs would eat by himself, when the rest of us
had finished.

“By Jove, Miss Anstruther,” observed Vande
leur, with an admiring sidewise glance, “you seem
to be quite a sailor.”
“I have crossed the ocean twice,” returned Miss

Anstruther, with a glance at me, “and it was a
rough passage both times, but I was not a bit
uncomfortable.”

“The Lady May ain’t a liner, by no means,”
pursued the skipper, “but she's as stanch as one,
even if she does tumble about more.

You’ll do,

mum, as the man says. I'll bank on you, even
when we run into a gale an’ begin turning hand
springs.”

“You seem to be perfectly at home on a boat,
Mr. Lorry,” said Miss Anstruther.
Ever since we had taken our chairs she had
91

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
been trying to draw me into the conversation;
but I preferred to keep silence and watch Van
deleur and the skipper for some sign of an under
standing between them.
“Like yourself, Miss Anstruther,” I laughed,
“I have been to sea before.”

“I had about made up my mind, Mr. Lorry,”
cut in the skipper, “that you could tell a topping
lift from a reef-point. About day after to-mor
row, I suppose, we'll know where we're going?”
“I hope so, captain.”
“The crew, of course, is a bit curious. That's
the trouble on v'yages like this, when you don’t
know where you’re going when you start out, nor
what you’re going to do when you get there. The
fo'c'sle fairly b'ils with wrong idees, an all the
hands are upsot an’ onsettled. But I’ll curry 'em
down, as the man says, if the need comes.”
“As soon as the men find out what port we're
bound for,” I returned, “they’ll probably become
easy in their minds.”
“The port we’re bound for ain’t the whole of
it, Mr. Lorry.” Golden dropped his hands on

the table-edge and fixed the blue eye on me. “The
swabs for’ard’ll overhaul their brain-tackle an’
92

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
wonder what's in the wind when we make land

fall.

But I ain’t stewin’ none.” The skipper

grinned expansively. “I can take a pin, or a
blessed rope's-end, an’ make a black-jack or a
black-birder out o’ ev'ry duckfoot aboard; but,
seeing as how we got ladies with us, an’ don’t
want no knock-down and drag-out, mayhap it
would be as well to let the crew have a workin'

knowledge o' what's going on.”

“That's my business, Captain Golden,” I
snapped, resenting his wishy-washy attempt to
get at the nub of our enterprise; “you and your
men will know as much or as little as I see fit to
tell.”

That was straight talk for the skipper, and in
his own cabin, too.

He stiffened, and the red ran

into his face. For a moment I thought he would
give me as good as I sent, but he changed his
mind. His temper passed in an indulgent grin,
and he got up from the table.
“You’re giving me my whack for this deal, Mr.
Lorry,” he remarked, starting for the companion
way, “an it's your right to blow the gaff, or
crawl farther back into your shell, as you please;
but, as master o' this boat, I’ve got to know our
93

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
destination. You'll either stick a pin in the
proper p’int on the chart, when we're three days
out, or I 'bout ship an’ put back to 'Frisco, an’
keep the advance-money.”
I wanted Golden to understand my position,
and was glad of the opportunity to make it clear
to him. Vandeleur followed the skipper to the
deck, and Miss Anstruther, with an earnest look
at me, went back to Mrs. Brackett. Stubbs, re

lieved by the skipper, came down.
He was a short, thick-set, moon-faced man

with a fringe of grayish mutton-chop whiskers. .
I remained in the cabin long enough to pass the
time of day with him, and to take his sizing, then
climbed to the poop.
It was good to sniff salt air again, to watch the
bellying canvas, to hear the wind sing in the rig
ging, the waves splash alongside, the mellow notes
of the ship's bell, and to feel the heave of the deck
underfoot. Difficulties loomed vaguely ahead,
but I faced them complacently.
As a passenger, I was privileged to go and
come as I saw fit, and took advantage of this to
mingle somewhat with the men. Looking in at
the fo'c'sle, H spent an hour with the watch below,
94

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
and later I spent another hour with all hands
during the first dog-watch.
My object was to measure up the men forward.

The covert investigation pleased me in some re
spects, and displeased me in others.
Including master and mate, cook and cabin
boy, the ship's complement numbered a half
SCOfe.

The cook was a Fortune Islander, the cabin
boy an eighteen-year-old native of Oakland. Of
the other six, two were Swedes, two Americans,
one a Mexican, and one a Kanaka.

The Mexican, the Kanaka, and the Americans
were a part of the flotsam and jetsam that goes
broke ashore, takes the first berth that offers, and

thinks more of a good “lay” than of honest means

for getting it. The Swedes were sturdy, taci
turn, good seamen, and thrifty—and thrift, of
course, is an evidence of character.

For three days we had shifting winds and clear
skies, and made a fair westing. On the morning
of the third day Mrs. Brackett, looking a bit pale

and distressed, joined us at table for the morning
meal.

Up to the time Mrs. Brackett presented herself,
95

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
I had caught only fleeting glimpses of Miss An
struther. Nearly the whole of that third day,
however, both ladies were on deck and appeared
to enjoy the experience.
At eight bells of the second dog-watch, Cap
tain Golden came to me, where I stood leaning
against the cabin near the break of the poop, and
touched my arm.
“Now’s the time for you to open your sealed
orders, Mr. Lorry,” said the skipper. “No more
going it blind after to-night.”
“May we have the use of the cabin?” I asked.
“Help yourself. Stubbs has just turned out,
and I’ll stay on deck with him an' give you the
run of everything aft, below. But I want to
know where we’re going when you’re done with
your chinning, that's all.”
I turned away and descended the companion
stairs, closing the doors after me. Vandeleur sat
under a ship's lamp in the cabin, reading a book
and smoking a cigarette. He made as though
he would leave when I came down.

“Wait, Mr. Vandeleur,” said I; “we are three
days out, and it is time to hold our conference and
open the envelopes.”
96

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
He was nervous and ill at ease. “You have my
envelope, and it isn’t necessary for me to remain,”
he observed shiftily.
I understood very well what ailed him. He did
not care to be present when I opened that dummy
envelope which he had given me.
“It is necessary for you to remain,” I answered
sternly. “Sit down!”
My show of authority dismayed him and sent
him back into his chair. He watched apprehen
sively while I knocked at the stateroom door to
summon Mrs. Brackett and Miss Anstruther.

The ladies appeared immediately, Miss An
struther supporting Mrs. Brackett and helping
her across the rocking floor to a chair.

“Deary me!” sighed Mrs. Brackett. “I wasn’t
never meant to be a sailor, I guess. What is it,
Mr. Lorry?”
“We are going to open the envelopes, Mrs.
Brackett,” said I.
“Oh!” There was a flutter of excitement on

the part of both ladies.

Taking one of the pivotal chairs, I swung to
the table and laid three envelopes in front of me.
“I’ll thank you for your envelope, Mr. Vande
97

A Q_u arter to Four
leur,” said I sharply, giving the young man a
steady glance.
“What do you mean?” he demanded weakly.
“Just what I say. I want your envelope.”
“Look here, Lorry,” he cried, pulling himself
together, “is this a joke?”
“Not so far as I am concerned.”

“Why, I gave you my envelope before we left
San Francisco.”

“That is where the joke comes in, Vandeleur.

The envelope you gave me contained nothing but
a piece of blank paper.”
“Then the joke is on all of us,” Vandeleur
remarked, with a feeble attempt at levity. “More
than likely all the envelopes contain pieces of
blank paper.”
Mrs. Brackett wrung her hands and Miss An
-

struther looked startled.

“What I want from you, Vandeleur,” I went
on, “is the envelope Mr. Price gave you—not the

one you handed me in San Francisco.”
He fell back in his chair, making a pitiable
attempt to dissemble.
“By Jove!” he stuttered, “do you mean to in
sinuate tha

py

98

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“Come,” I cut in briskly, “don’t keep us wait
ing.”

-

Vandeleur recovered himself a little, got out
of his chair, and swaggered toward me.

“You’re bound to force my hand, are you?” he
cried, coming to a halt, bracing himself, and
glowering at me with his buttermilk eyes.
“I am,” I returned calmly, “just that.”
“Please, Mr. Vandeleur !” pleaded Miss An
struther, in an agitated voice. “We must all
work together, you know, or we cannot hope for
success.”

“Don’t be troublesome,” admonished Mrs.
Brackett, in a tone of paternal tolerance, “now,
of all times.”

Vandeleur turned and bowed to Miss An
Struther.

“My actions, Miss Anstruther,” went on Van
deleur melodramatically, “spring from a due re
gard for your interests and mine. You ladies
don’t know anything about this fellow, Lorry, but
I have been at some pains to look him up. From
what I have learned about him, I assure you that

he is not a man to be trusted.” He drew up to
99

A Q_u arter to Four
his full height.

“Personally,” he finished, with

a flourish, “I decline to trust him.”
Mrs. Brackett and Miss Anstruther stared,
first at Vandeleur and then at me.

Another man

than Vandeleur, making such a speech, would
have heard from me promptly; but there was a
ludicrous side to this affair, and it completely
dwarfed the youth’s insolence.
“Perhaps,” I spoke up dryly, “you had better
tell the ladies what you know.”
“I know,” he cried, turning fiercely and level
ing at me a finger yellowed with cigarettes, “that
you are an adventurer, and that you will stoop
to anything to feather your own nest!”
“Is that all, Vandeleur?”

“It’s enough, I think. I demand”—he lifted
his clenched right hand and brought it down in
the open palm of his left—“I demand that you
turn those three envelopes over to me, and make
me the leader of this expedition.”
Silence followed, silence broken only by the slap
of waves alongside, the straining of timbers, a
tramp of feet overhead.
“I shall be glad,” said I finally, “to yield to the
1OO

A

Q_u arter

tO FO u r

will of the majority. If the ladies want you for
a leader, Vandeleur, let them say so.”
“Good gracious!” exclaimed Mrs. Brackett,
with a long breath. “Whoever heard of such a
thing? Here Mr. Lorry furnishes the money to
take us, goodness knows where, and makes it pos
sible for us to find out whether there's anything
or nothing back of this trip, and Mr. Vandeleur
thanks him by going into a tantrum like that.
Young man,” she added severely, giving Van
deleur a withering look, “I wouldn’t have stirred
a step if it hadn’t been for Mr. Lorry, and I won't
go a mile farther into this big ocean unless he has
entire charge of the party.”
“I feel the same way, Mr. Vandeleur,” said
Miss Anstruther.

“Do be reasonable.”

For an instant the wind seemed taken out of

Vandeleur's sails. Then he got himself in hand
again.

“I am going to look after your interests in
spite of you,” said he, puffing out his chest like

an angry robin. “Before long, both of you ladies
will thank me for it.”

He started for the companion stairs. Before
he had taken three steps, I had him by the collar
IOI

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
and had laid him, squirming, back down on the
table.

He clawed, kicked, shouted threats, and bawled

for help. In spite of his puny struggles, I pushed
a hand into the breast of his coat and drew out

the envelope which I knew to be there.

Then I flung him aside. He toppled to the
floor, but sprang up fuming and rushed for the
deck.

“I am sorry, ladies,” I remarked, “that I found
it necessary to use force. Vandeleur, however,
has queer ideas, and we cannot allow him to men
ace the success of our enterprise.”
“You did exactly right, Mr. Lorry,” approved
Miss Anstruther. “Now, let us open the en
velopes before there is any more interference.”
“Why, who else is there to interfere?” fluttered
Mrs. Bracktt.

“No one, I hope,” answered Miss Anstruther,
“but Mr. Vandeleur will appeal to Captain Gold
en, and—and I must confess that I do not like
Captain Golden's looks.”
I was tearing open the envelopes while Miss
Anstruther was speaking.
IO2

CHAPTER X.
A Dissected Clue.

The problem of the four envelopes had so com
pletely won me that I gave little attention to the
clash with Vandeleur.

At least one of the veils

that shrouded our mission was about to lift.
A few moments after Vandeleur had left, the

ladies forgot him as utterly as I had done. Lean
ing forward over the table they watched breath
lessly, the swinging lamp overhead throwing our
shadows weirdly across the table-top.
Each envelope contained a piece of cardboard,
some three inches square. On the back of each
piece was the name of the person who had re
ceived it, with the words, in parentheses: “Im
portant—Keep Carefully.”
On the reverse side of my piece and Vande
leur's were figures with degree, minute, and sec
ond-marks, and the letters “W” and “N.” On
the reverse side of Mrs. Brackett’s and Miss An

struther’s pieces were words, painstakingly
printed in a bold hand.
IO3

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“It looks like a dissected puzzle,” said Miss
Anstruther.

“Hardly a puzzle,” said I, “for the pieces go

together without difficulty. They are our instruc
tions, Miss Anstruther, cut into quarters, and
each piece sent to one of the four who are en
titled to a knowledge of the whole.”
I juggled the pieces about until they lay as fol
lows:

Fortunel Island

149-40'-Io” W
Io-|12'-30° N
Mouth of Sea Calve on East Side
Ten Teakwlood Cases

“There it is!” I exclaimed exultantly.
Mrs. Brackett tremblingly adjusted a pair of
spectacles and bowed her head close to the four
rejoined quarters.
“I can’t make out one thing!” she murmured.
“What does it all mean, anyway?”
“Why, Mrs. Brackett,” returned Miss An
struther, with repressed excitement, “can’t you
IO4

A Q_u a r ter to Four
see that by fitting those cards together, in that
way, we find out where we are to go?”
“I don’t suppose I’m very bright, Zelda,” said
Mrs. Brackett, shaking her head helplessly, “but
then I ain’t so young as I used to be, and there
are a lot of things past my understanding. What
are those figures with the funny marks after
them?”

“Those figures give us the latitude and longi
tude of ‘Fortune Island,’” explained the girl pa
tiently. “With those figures to guide him, Cap
tain Golden can lay our course for the island.”
“So it's an island we're going to?”
“Yes.”

“Not one of these cannibal islands?” queried
Mrs. Brackett, in sudden alarm.

“There are no cannibal islands in this day and
age of the world, Mrs. Brackett,” I hastened to
reassure her.

“Thank goodness for that,”
Brackett. “When I was a girl I

and here her face hardened resolutely, “I’ll find

A Q_u a r t e r to F O ur
him, if the place is crowded with cannibals. But
what does the rest of that printing mean?”
“That,” I explained, “is something for us to
investigate when we get there. Some one,” I
went on, “I don’t know who, has taken a great
deal of pains to set us on the right track. All
this, you see, was printed on a large card; the
card was then cut into four pieces and a quarter:

sent to each of us. That is where the quarter
to four comes in, I suppose.
“So cleverly were the instructions printed on
the large card that, when quartered, all four
pieces were necessary before the instructions
could be read. This, of course, was to keep any
one of us from obtaining an advantage over the
Others.

“To learn this clue to our destination, we were
all obliged to bring our quarters and lay them
together. A very simple plan, but entirely effect
ive.”

*

Taking my note-book from my pocket, I wrote
out the name of the island and the latitude and

longitude twice, each description on a separate
leaf. One of the leaves I tore out, to give to
Captain Golden.
IO6

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
“You ladies understand, I think,” I proceeded,
laying the detached leaf on the table and return
ing the note-book to my pocket, “that Mr. Van
deleur is not to be trusted.

He is entitled to a

quarterly share in our enterprise, and we will
deal with him justly, no matter how he elects
to deal with us; but I think the information we

have just developed should be kept from him.
Vandeleur has mistaken ideas. We must not for

get that we know little of Captain Golden and
even less of his crew.

If we told Vandeleur

everything, and he made a confidant of Captain
Golden, we might—I don’t say that we would,
but that we might—make trouble for ourselves.
It is better to be on the safe side.”

“Dear, dear!” faltered Mrs. Brackett, becom

ing nervous, “I do hope we won’t have any
trouble with anybody.”
“Mr. Vandeleur knows enough already to whet
Captain Golden's curiosity,” put in Miss An
struther. “If the captain’s cupidity were aroused
—and, as I said before, I don’t like the man's

looks—we might find the whole ship against us.”
“It couldn’t be so bad as that, Miss Anstruther,

I am sure,” said I hastily, “for certainly there are
107

A Q_u a r ter to Four
some honest hands aboard the schooner.

Please

don’t be alarmed by what I said. I spoke as I
did merely to emphasize the need of caution with
regard to Vandeleur. Have you fixed in your
mind the printed words on your card and Mrs.
Brackett’s?”

The girl leaned over the cards for a moment,
then looked up with a nod. Taking a match from
my pocket, I burned the cards one by one, pow
dered the little heap of black ashes, and dropped
them on the floor.

“Let me warn both of you,” said I, “to say
nothing, not a word. I will give that leaf on the
table to Captain Golden, and it will tell him all
that he needs to know.

If Vandeleur tries to talk

with either of you, please refer him to me.”
“I’m afraid,” mourned Mrs. Brackett, “that
this work of ours won’t be clear sailing, after all.
I'm a pretty old woman to be mixed up in any

trouble, Mr. Lorry. It was only the thought of
finding my boy that brought me into this; and
while it's mighty fine to think of securing a for
tune, too—for, goodness knows, I'm poverty poor
at this very minute—still, a woman of my years
hasn’t any business philanderin’ around the ocean

A Q_u a r ter to Four
looking for a pot o' gold. I'm hunting for Tom,
that’s all, and now that we’ve made a good start
you can count on me to keep my best foot for
ward.”

“I shall do all I can to avoid trouble, Mrs.

Brackett,” said I earnestly, “both on your ac
count and on Miss Anstruther's—and I might
add, on my own, as well. If trouble comes, it
will not be of my seeking, you may be sure, nor

because I did not do everything possible to keep
away from it.”
“Why did Mr. Vandeleur deceive you, in San

Francisco, by giving you an envelope contain
ing a piece of blank paper, Mr. Lorry?” queried
Miss Anstruther.

“You did not tell me about

that,” she added reproachfully.
“I did not want to bother you,” I returned,
“when you had so many other things to think
about. I felt sure that Vandeleur was trying to
trick me, and it was not an hour after he gave me
the envelope before I investigated and discovered
that it contained nothing.”
“Why did he want to trick you?” persisted
the girl. “He must have known that you would
find him out, sooner or later.”
Io9

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
I hesitated about telling of the night attack on
me on the water-front. There was no way to
avoid it, however, so I gave them the story briefly.
Mrs. Brackett was horrified, and Miss An

struther’s eyes flashed.
“Only Vandeleur could have inspired that at
tack,” I went on. “I imagine, therefore, that he
gave me the envelope to quiet any suspicions of
him that I might have formed.”
“He is treacherous,” breathed Miss Anstruther

indignantly.

“You are perfectly right not to

trust him with any information. Of course, he
shall have his share of whatever we find, but it

is plain that we must do all the work ourselves,
and perhaps we shall have to do it in the face of
his open hostility.”
Our conference had proceeded thus far when
it was interrupted by the opening of the compan
ion doors. Captain Golden and Vandeleur came
down the stairs.

Vandeleur was fuming. The skipper's single
eye held a baleful gleam, and I saw that he car
ried a revolver in his hand.

“Miss Anstruther,” I requested, in a low tone,
I IO

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
“will you and Mrs. Brackett please retire to your

“I will take Mrs. Brackett to the stateroom,”

resolute, “and then I shall return and take my

“I beg of you
“My mind is made up, Mr. Lorry,” she broke
in decisively.
While she supported Mrs. Brackett across the
99

rocking floor, I got up, braced myself against the
chair-back, and faced the skipper and Vandeleur.

III

CHAPTER XI.
Who's Who?

“What's the trouble here?” demanded Captain
Golden, planting himself in front of me, legs
wide apart, his ominous eye raking me up and
down.

“No trouble, captain,” I answered easily.
“Mr. Vandeleur here says there is.”
“By Jove!” stuttered Vandeleur, “the scoun
drel laid hands on me, threw me down on that

table, and took a document out of my pocket. He
used violence, Captain Golden, that’s what he did.
He's got that document yet, and I demand it
back.”

“There's your indictment, Mr. Lorry, as the
man says,” came sternly from the skipper. “I’m

the only man that has a right to use violence on
this fore-an’-after, an I won't have my passen
gers robbin’ an’ sluggin each other. Do you
rise to that?”

I nodded.

Miss Anstruther, at that moment,

glided forward and took her station at my side.
I I2

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“There's a lady present, Captain Golden,” said
I, “and your revolver is out of place.”

“Before I put up this gun,” went on the skip
per doggedly, “I want to know whether or not
you're going to give Vandeleur's dockyment back
to him?”

-

“I am not.

That document and three others

have been destroyed.”
“Destroyed?” cried Vandeleur, in a voice that
throbbed and choked with wrath.

“If he's des

troyed those papers, Captain Golden, then, by
gad! I call on you to put him in irons. I had as

much right to those papers as any one, and if
he destroyed them he did it because he wants to
rob me

35

“That will do, Vandeleur,” said I sharply, step
ping toward him.
He jumped back and behind Golden, as though
fearing I was about to lay hands on him again.
“Avast there,” warned the skipper, putting out
his arm. “What business you got destroyin'
property belonging to Vandeleur?”
“Whatever business it is, Captain Golden, at
least it is no business of yours.”
My gorge was rising. Something touched my

sleeve as though to arouse in me a realizing sense
of what I was doing. I dropped my eyes, and
saw Miss Anstruther's small white hand.

I gave her a reassuring glance out of the clew
of my eye, then picked from the table the leaf
with the longitude and latitude of our destina
tion.

“This is a fitting time for us to come to an
understanding, captain,” I announced.
He
ducked his head, fixing himself to say something
ironical, but I cut in ahead. “I hold here a slip
of paper giving the bearings of our destination,
but before I turn it over to you I must know
whether you intend to live up to your contract
-swith me.”

He vouchsafed no response.
“Who owns the Lady May?” I pursued.
“You know as well as I do,” he snarled.

“And who's her skipper?”
“What sort of a fool question is that?”
“Who chartered the schooner?”
*You did.”

“Who signed the contract and put up the ad
vance-money?”
“Yoti did.”

“So it follows that the Lady May, her skipper

“Providin' your business is honest,” he quali

that, yet.”

“It is honest, and I own you and your boat for
the period of our contract. There are three per
sons aboard who are my guests—Mrs. Brackett,
Miss Anstruther, and a Vandeleur. If I choose to

have you put in at Honolulu and leave Vandeleur,
you’ll do it.”

That caught the skipper. It also made a salu

“You ain’t treatin

bit on his temper.
“That is an affair between Vandeleur and me.

You have nothing whatever to do with it. Now,
then, once for all: Are you going to continue
this voyage, or are you going to put back to San
Francisco?”

“If you'll tell me where we're going,” he an

swered sulkily, “I’ll continue the voyage.”
115

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
“Very good,” said I, handing him the paper.

“There's the latitude and longitude of our first
landfall, providing”—and here I turned grimly
on Vandeleur—“this young man doesn’t make it
necessary for me to put him ashore at Honolulu.”
“You haven’t any right to go through with this
business without me,” babbled Vandeleur, his

face turning a sickly gray. He was thoroughly
cowed and not a little frightened.
“I have a moral right to do anything I see fit
that will make for the good of this expedition,”
I declared. “If you are foolish enough to try to
meddle with me, and so increase our difficulties,
we shall certainly drop you off somewhere until
the work is done.”

“Don’t I have a share?” he asked, his appeal
ing gaze traveling from me to Miss Anstruther.
“Certainly, Mr. Vandeleur,” spoke up Miss An
struther. “Mr. Lorry intends to protect your in
terests. If you will be advised by me, you will
do exactly as he says.”
“He’s got me in a corner,” was Vandeleur's
sullen response, “so I suppose I'll have to jump
whenever he cracks the whip. What do you
116

A Q_u a r t e r to F our
want me to do?” he jerked out, turning in my di
rection.

“Sheer away and keep to yourself until this
boat puts into San Francisco again,” said I
promptly. “And keep a still tongue in your
head,” I added, with a significant glance at the
skipper, who had his back to us overhauling some
charts.

*

“I’ll do that, by Jove!” growled Vandeleur,
with a black look. “And if you play me false,
Lorry, don’t forget that I’ll have an accounting.”
“If I find,” I continued, ignoring his last re
mark, “that you are not acting strictly in accord
ance with my instructions after we lay our south
erly course, I shall have you transferred to the
first ship we fall in with.”
He bent his brows at me, but made no answer.

“Captain Golden!” he called.
“Well?” interrogated the skipper, looking up
from a chart which he had laid over the table.

“I decline to occupy the same stateroom with
this man any longer. Have I your permission to
bunk in the fo'c'sle?”

“You can bunk in the cross-trees for all O’ me,”

snapped the skipper; “but you better ask Mr.
117

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
Lorry. He seems to be cock o’ the walk on this
hooker, at the present speakin’.”
“Bunk wherever you please,” said I.
Vandeleur carried a deeply injured air across
the cabin and into our stateroom; and he carried

it out again, together with a couple of suit-cases
and a hat-box. He never deigned a look in Miss
Anstruther's direction, or mine, until he reached

the foot of the companion stairs. Then he whirled
about.

“I’ll match my wits against yours any day,
Lorry,” he scowled. “As for Miss Anstruther
and Mrs. Brackett, just let them remember that a
man who'll steal for them will steal from them.”
With that, Vandeleur lurched up the stairs and
out onto the deck. Miss Anstruther gave me a
faint smile. Evidently her appreciation of Van
deleur's performance was equal to my own.
“No such place,” called Captain Golden, a fin
ger of his mutilated hand resting on the chart
before him. “You’re off soundings with this lati
tude an’ longitude o' yours, Mr. Lorry.”
“What do you mean?” I queried, stepping to
his side.
“There's no such island down on the chart.
I 18

If

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
it’s the Fortune Islands you're after, they're 'way
Off

99

“We’re not after the Fortune Islands.”
“That other Fortune Island ain’t charted.”

A glance at the chart showed me that he was
right. It was an admiralty chart, and a good
Cine.

“The island is there, all right,” said I confi
dently, “even if it isn’t down on the chart.”
Golden shook his head.

“Some one's handed

you a gold brick,” he averred. “Them four en
velopes
“Where did you hear anything about four en
velopes?” I interrupted sharply.
95

The skipper looked blank for an instant.
“Why,” said he, getting the whip-hand of him
self, “didn’t we talk about them envelopes when
Vandeleur an I come down?”

“Not that I know of,” I returned shortly.
“Then Vandeleur told me afore we come down.

Anyhow, you an’ your friends have been gold
bricked, as I says.”
“That's not your affair, Captain Golden,” I

observed deliberately. “Take us to the spot in
dicated. If we find open water, then we'll 'bout
119

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
ship and return to San Francisco. You're in
sured against loss, no matter what happens.”
“Right-o,” said he, then put away the chart
and went on deck to give the man at the wheel
Oll1 116W CO111 Se.

“You did very well, indeed, Mr. Lorry,” said
Miss Anstruther. “I cannot begin to tell you
how glad I am that you did not come to any vio
lence with Captain Golden.”

“That lesson in who's who was coming to the
captain,” I answered.

“He'll profit by it, I

think.”

“Still,” she murmured, “I do not trust him.

It

almost seems as though there is some understand
ing between the captain and Mr. Vandeleur.
Certainly Mr. Vandeleur has told Captain Golden
more than was necessary.”
“No doubt, and when Vandeleur gets into the
fo'c'sle, he may proceed to enlighten the crew.
But I don’t see how we can help that.”
“It’s too bad,” commiserated Miss Anstruther,

“that we should have such a contrary-minded per
son in our party. However, as you say, it can
not be helped, so we must make the best of it. It

was a good stroke to burn the four cards and
12O

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
not trust Mr. Vandeleur with the rest of the in

formation. It won’t be long, I suppose, until
every one on the ship knows that we are making
for an uncharted island.”

“That will be common fo'c'sle gossip before
many days.”
“What will the crew think of us and our mis
Sion?”

“The first thing a sailor always thinks of, on
a voyage like ours, is treasure. They will im
agine, probably, that we're going after pearls. A
mysterious voyage is quite apt to whet a mari
ner’s curiosity.”
“And the idea of pearls is quite apt to whet his
greed, is it not?”
In that Miss Anstruther had struck the key
note. I marveled at her foresight.
“Are you an optimist, Miss Anstruther?” I
smiled.

“I try to be,” she answered, catching my spirit
and also smiling.

“Then, as optimists, we will not cross any
bridges until we come to them.”
“Yet it is well, don’t you think, to imagine
I2 I

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
what lies before us, and try to be prepared for
whatever may happen?”

“Exactly so,” I agreed, my eyes wandering to
the rack that held the rifles.

She noticed my glance at the firearms and
dropped her head with a little shiver.
“You will not forget what you promised me
while we were being towed down the bay?” she
asked.

“I will not forget. You will find, Miss An
struther, that I shall rely upon your judgment a
great deal.”
“You may rely upon me in other ways, too.
Perhaps, Mr. Lorry,” and her eyes danced as
they rose to mine, “I have more courage than you
are pleased to credit me with. At any rate, I
shall stand at your side, no matter what comes.
Good night.”

“Good night,” said I, and we separated to go
to Our StaterOOmS.

A bonny girl, truly, ran the current of my
thoughts; a girl to fight with, and a girl to fight
for. Who could not succeed in any undertaking,
with Zelda Anstruther at his side?
122

CHAPTER XII.
The Sou'easter.

I had always plenty of food for thought—the
obscure details of our enterprise offered me that
—and the progress of events was continually
warping my mental processes to a different angle.
For instance, my speculations dealt often with
the mysterious unknown who had written out our
directions, quartered them, and distributed them
so oddly. Who was this person? And why was
he hiding his hand and foregoing a part in the
expedition? Nay, more: if there was a fortune
to be had, why did he not go after it himself in
stead of turning it over to others?
Then, too, what sort of a fortune was it? Of
what did it consist?

Inasmuch as I had staked my all on the ven
ture, it may be that I gave the outcome more

thought than did any of the others. They were
deeply interested, of course, but hardly to the ex
tent that I was.

A fresh view-point was mine when I learned
123

A Q_u arter to Four'
that the ostensible fortune lay somewhere over

sea. The angle changed with the treacherous
maneuvers of Vandeleur; with the information
that our landfall lay well down in the tropics; that
it was not charted, and, consequently, shrouded
in doubt. All these, and many other develop
ments, kept the vague perspective constantly
shifting.
My one firm support was Miss Anstruther.
Come fair weather or foul, success or failure, I
felt that she would not fail me.

Mrs. Brackett also, in her way, was thoroughly
dependable. Circumstances, narrowing her life
to the little world of Emmetsburg, had not given
her the broad outlook most available for our pres
ent needs. Of the experience that counts in the
larger affairs of existence, Miss Anstruther had
acquired infinitely more in less than half Mrs.
Brackett's years.
It seemed almost a sacrilege to do or say any
thing that would disturb Mrs. Brackett's serenity
or hopefulness. Her artlessness and simplicity,
no less than her advanced years, counseled me to
smooth the path before her.
Miss Anstruther, on the other hand, would not
I24

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
have contented herself one moment unless she

knew herself to be in touch with every detail of
our enterprise.
During that first night of my lone occupancy
of the stateroom we ran into some heavy weather.

The Lady May wrestled and tumbled with the
long Pacific swell, and I heard much tramping
about on the decks and much shouting of orders.
Mrs. Brackett was again indisposed and did
not join us at breakfast. Neither did Vandeleur
—but from indisposition of another sort. He
was sulky, and the skipper told Miss Anstruther
and me that he chose to eat at the second table
with Mr. Stubbs.

Following breakfast, I took a turn on deck.

The sun had appeared for only a brief space, and
then had withdrawn behind ominous-looking

clouds. The sea was a dull leaden gray, and

whitecaps reared above the schooner's rail and
now and then tumbled aboard. A peep into the
binnacle showed me the compass-card bearing
southwest.

“The glass is down, sir, and we're in for a sou’
easter,” said the man at the wheel.

This man was one of the Swedes, Anderson by
125

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
name. His easy command of English surprised
IT16.

I should have liked to talk with him, but the
skipper was pacing the lee alley and might have
resented a conversation with the helmsman. With

a nod to Anderson, I went over and sat down on
the cabin.

The wind was steadily increasing.

Captain

Golden, tramping up and down and side-stepping
with the roll of the ship, appeared to be com-.
muning with himself.
All our canvas was set and drawing. Every
once in a while our lee rail went under, and a
wave swept us amidships with the windward roll
and ran hissing through the scuppers.
It was high time, I thought, that the skipper
began taking in sail. However, if it is bad form
to talk with the man at the wheel, it is even worse

form to advise a skipper what to do in handling
his ship.
All hands had been turned out.

I presumed

Stubbs had done that before he went below. Hud

dled forward, I could see the men alternately
staring to windward and up at the poop where
126

A Q_u a r ter to Four
the preoccupied skipper was mechanically pacing
his round.

“Are you anything of a seaman, Mr. Lorry?”
shouted Captain Golden, bracing himself near
IIle.

I don’t know whatever put the question into
his head, nor what possible bearing it could have
on his thoughts. It was certainly odd that he
should address me in such a way at such a time.
“I’m enough of a seaman to know that you’ll
have us on our beam-ends if you don’t begin to
snug down,” I called back to him sharply.
His blue eye glinted. What reply was on his
lips I never knew, for at that moment a fierce
gust hit us, and over we went with our lee rail
under.

A look forward showed me Vandeleur, hang

ing for life to a pin-rail and with his heels buoyed
up in the deluge that swept us. The pull on his
arms was too much for him.

Hurled from his

support, he was slammed against the weather
bulwarks, and, a moment later, hauled out of the

scuppers by the Mexican. Then, personally con
ducted to the fo'c'sle hatch, he was dropped be
low.
127

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
A scud of rain drove down on us, and as I
started for the companionway, Stubbs bounded
out of it to the deck. Captain Golden was
aroused at last, and as I went below I heard him

bawling to
jibs.
I would
know what
he came up

the hands to get in the topsails and
have given something handsome to
the skipper had had in his mind when
to me and asked if I was anything of

a seaman.

Miss Anstruther was in the cabin

when I got below.
“This is our first storm, isn’t it, Mr. Lorry?”
she asked.

“A bit of a blow, Miss Anstruther,” I replied

cheeringly. “It’s helping us on into the trades,
and the quicker we strike the trades the quicker
we get to Fortune Island.”
“You refer to the trade-winds?”
“Yes.”

“The captain has put the ship on her new
course?”

“We are now headed southwest,” I assured
her.

“You didn’t think he would refuse to take

us to Fortune Island after his promise to me last
evening, did you?”
128

A Q_u a r ter to Four
“I hardly know what I thought,” she answered

musingly; “the more I see of Captain Golden the
more my distrust of him increases.”
“I shall watch him closely, you may be sure of
that,” said I.
A wail came from the stateroom.
“Poor Mrs. Brackett is almost worried out of

her senses,” said Miss Anstruther, starting for
the stateroom; “she thinks we may go to the bot
tom any moment, and insisted that I should find
you and ask if there is any danger.”
“Tell her she may be a little uncomfortable for
a while,” I smiled; “but that she is perfectly
safe.”

We ate our dinner with the rough-weather
trays in place, and I do not think Miss An
struther found it a very enjoyable meal. She ate
but little, and soon left the table with some bread
and tea for Mrs. Brackett.

During the brief period she sat with the skip
per and me, her growing dislike of Captain Gold
en was plainly manifested. She avoided his
glances; even when he asked her a question, she
kept her eyes away from him when she answered.
I29

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
That was the woman of it, I supposed. As I
did not want the skipper to feel that we distrusted
him, I resolved to speak to Miss Anstruther and
give her a little good counsel at the first oppor
tunity.
Vandeleur did not come to the cabin for his

dinner. Mr. Stubbs told me, with a humorous
grin, that he hadn’t the nerve to make the pas
sage from the fo'c'sle aft with the big sea run
ning.

The rest of that day was dreary enough. Miss
Anstruther clung to her stateroom, in constant
attendance upon Mrs. Brackett, and I missed her
sadly. I had another brief glimpse of her at
supper, when she resumed her same air of frigid
reserve toward Captain Golden.
The skipper was not a dense man, and I knew
that Miss Anstruther's attitude did not escape
him. Was he sufficiently dense to misconstrue it?
‘That was the point that bothered me.
As I lay in my bunk that night, with the Lady
May wallowing and plunging toward the heart
of the great Pacific, I fell back on the usual pas

time of my solitary waking hours. My mental
carpentry had to do with dovetailing together cer
I 30

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
tain speculations in such a way as to make a
tangible fabric of three dimensions.

Of course I gave it up. The materials with
which I had to work were too vague for a lucid
product.
Some agility was necessary to keep me in my

berth.

Nevertheless, I slept—by spells.

The

groaning timbers, the stamp of feet overhead, the
shriek of the wind, and the splash of the rain and
the waves all united in a lullaby.
Several hours must have passed when a rough
hand drummed on my door. I started up with a
suddenness that brought my head in sharp con
tact with the bottom of the upper berth.
Floundering to the door, I pulled it open and
found Petie, the cabin-boy, hanging to a chair
in the cabin.

“What do you want?” I demanded.
“Mr. Vandeleur sent me, sir,” answered Petie.
“He wants to see you in the fo'c'sle.”
“If he wants to see me,” I answered, “why
doesn’t he come here?”

“He ain’t able, sir.

He got stove in a little

by a wave that boarded us this mornin’.”
“What time is it, Petie?”
I31

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“Four bells of the mid-watch, sir.”
I had not heard that Vandeleur had been hurt

by his morning's experience.

Yet I gave him

the benefit of the doubt, got into my clothes hur
riedly, took the skipper's oilskin coat and sou'
wester from the cabin table where he had thrown

them, and climbed out into the howling gale.
The rain had abated somewhat, but the fierce
wind drove the schooner at a race-horse clip
through the inky seas. Just from the lighted
cabin, as I was, I could hardly see my hand before
my face.

“Where ye goin', Mr. Lorry?” called the mate,
from somewhere behind me.
“Vandeleur wants to see me in the fo'c'sle.”

“Purty time, this, to turn out a man! Mind

yer eye as ye go for’ard, sir. There's a nasty sea
running.”
I lurched down the lee steps from the poop,
sensed the windward roll by the feel of the deck,
and hustled forward along the lee rail. The roll

from windward caught me close to the main rig
ging.
By then I could see a little, and I jumped into
the shrouds just as a huge wave foamed athwart
I 32

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
ships with the slant of the deck. Watching
my chance, I dropped to the dripping planks and
started on again.
Forward of the galley, with the fo'c'sle hatch
but a few yards away, a stunning blow caught me
from behind. I tried to cry out, but every muscle
went lax under the impact of the heavy hand that
SmOte me.

A sickening feeling of abject helplessness
rushed through every nerve. For an instant the
raging of wind and sea died away in blank si
lence.

Then, with a desperate dragging upon my re
serve powers, I regained my senses and felt that
I was being propelled toward the side of the ship.
Who it was that had laid hold of me I could not

see, but I realized that my life was at stake, and
that if I saved myself I must fight.

Lifting my voice in a wild yell, I struck out
furiously with my clenched fists, grappled with
my unknown antagonist, and we went to the deck

and rolled over and over into the scuppers. There
my head brought up with tremendous force
against the bulwarks, and once more everything
tangible slipped from me.
I 33

CHAPTER XIII.

Cool Villainy.
When I regained my wits, the mate had me up
on the poop, in the lee alley. There was keen
pain at the back of my head, and in my ears a
dull roaring not of the wind or the sea.
“What did ye yell for, Mr. Lorry?” inquired
Stubbs, helping me to my feet and supporting me
as I leaned against the cabin. “A man don't
usually yell like that when a bit of a comber
comes aboard and slams him head first into the
bulwarks.”

“I should say not!” I agreed. “Didn't you see
any one else when you picked me up, Mr.
Stubbs?”

“Only the watch.”
“Wasn't I grappling with any one?”
Because of the dark, I felt rather than saw the
mate's amazement.

A moment more and his

words left no doubt of it.

“Now, keelhaul me!” he exclaimed. “I thought
I 34

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
ye was too much of a sailor to git knocked off
your pins. Was ye set on?”
“I was, and from behind, just forward of the
galley. I left my mark on the man who did it,
that I’ll swear to.

Come forward with me, Mr.

Stubbs, until I can have a look at the watch.”
“You’d better crawl into your bunk for now,
Mr. Lorry,” counseled the mate. “It’s half-after
two in the mornin', an’ your investigation can
wait.”

“I’m going to settle this now,” I declared. “I
want to have a look at Vandeleur as well as at the
watch.”

My head, in spite of its throbbing ache, was as
clear as a bell, and I was as steady on my feet as
ever. We gained the fo'c'sle hatch without much
difficulty, and I descended, leaving Stubbs to send
the watch down a man at a time.

A chorus of snores reverberated in the fo'c'sle,
battling with the outer noise and with a thump of
boots against the bulkhead as the vessel rolled,
and the slap and swish of oilskins.
One of the Swedes was the first to come down.

His face bore no evidence of rough treatment.

He had heard my yell, he stated, but he had seen
135

A Q_u a r ter to Four
no one forward aside from his watch-mates.

He

had been dozing on the deck-house under the lee
of one of the boats.

The Mexican followed the Swede, told a similar
story, and bore no marks of a struggle. Next
came one of the Americans, a low-browed, bull
necked ruffian, who, I was sure, would be capable
of anything in a pinch. But he passed muster
as easily as the other two.

So much for the watch. Taking the sea-lamp
from its swinging frame, I went from bunk to
bunk, examining the faces of the sleepers. These
offered no evidence whatever.

Vandeleur was

sleeping, apparently, as soundly as the rest. He
did not seem in very bad case from his experi
ence with the boarding wave. With one hand I
shook him into wakefulness.

“Well,” said I grimly, as he lay staring up at
me, “what do you want?”
“By—by Jove!” he stuttered. “What are you
doing here? What do you want?”
“You sent for me.”

“I–I—” he mumbled, and I saw fear in his
weak face.

136

A Q_u a r ter to Four
“Well?” I said, between my teeth, leaning
down over him.

“Out with it!”

“Mrs. Brackett has a bottle of arnica in her

carpetbag,” with a futile readiness that brought
a half-smile to my lips, “and I wanted you to get
it for me.”

“Why didn’t you tell Petie that when you sent
him aft?”

“I thought I did; but I was in a good deal of
pain and may have neglected to do so.”

“There's arnica in the medicine-chest. Why
didn’t you have Petie go to Captain Golden?”
“I—I didn’t think of that,” he gulped.

“There are several things, Vandeleur, that you
didn’t think about. Here's something, however,
that you had best keep in mind from this on:
Hereafter I shall carry a loaded revolver, and if
any one tries to slip me overboard there'll be
shooting. Look sharp, my lad. If you want to
stay aboard the schooner you'll have to do dif
ferently.”
Then I put the lamp back in the bracket,
climbed to the deck, and went to the galley. Sli
ding the door, I stepped into the narrow room.
The cook slept in a cubby-hole off his kitchen, and
137

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
a scratched match gave me a good view of his
ebony face. No, it wasn’t the cook.

When I regained the poop, the mate inquired
anxiously for the result of my investigation. I
told him of my failure to find the man I was look
ing for.
He was strangely quiet for a minute, his fin
gers running up under his sou’wester and scra
ping through his scant hair.
“If I was you, Mr. Lorry,” he remarked, “I
wouldn’t give that Vandeleur any more rope than
necessary. He's been stringin' the crew with a
lot o' talk about treasure, an’ the Lord know
what. Mebby you knows how sailors is, an’ meb
by you don’t, but it ain’t policy, an is like to breed
trouble. That's betwixt ourselves an’ the main

mast,” he added hastily.

“Thank you, Mr. Stubbs,” said I grimly.
“From this on I'll have two eyes for Vandeleur.”

Thereupon I lurched down the companionway
and crawled back into bed. By the following
morning the storm had blown itself out, the wind
had died down to a skipper's breeze, and the
heavy sea was slowly subsiding.

There was a lump at the back of my head, and
138

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
a bruise at the crown. The skin had been frayed
from the knuckles of my right hand, too, and I
was more certain than ever that I had left some
mark on the man who had attacked me.

Every doubt vanished at breakfast. When
Captain Golden appeared and took his seat, there
was a patch of court-plaster as large as a half
dollar pasted over his left temple.
My angle of vision had again changed. So
deeply impressed was I by my discovery that I
was more than taciturn to the others at table,

even to Mrs. Brackett, who had put in an appear
ance with clearing weather.
“Snapped by a rope's-end,” explained the skip
per, resting the fingers of his mutilated hand on
the patch of court-plaster. “That was an un
common wind we had,” he added, “and everythin'
loose was snapping, for a while.”
There was a brief respite of silence.
“Mr. Stubbs tells me you had a rough experi
ence last night, Mr. Lorry,” continued the skip
per, his voice easy and non-committal.
“Nothing to speak of,” I answered, with a
quieting glance into Miss Anstruther's apprehen
sive face.
139

A Q_u a r t e r to F O ur
Excusing myself, I went on deck. So Captain
Golden was the man who had laid for me forward

of the galley!
It seemed incredible that the skipper should
descend to such cool villainy. And the cunning
of it!

For he had left his oilskins on the cabin

table for tacit evidence that he was in his state
TOO111.

Why should he want to get rid of me? Was I
not the one from whom he was to receive his
hire?

There could be but one answer to the question
that burned in my brain. Golden and Vandeleur
had exchanged confidences, and, if appearances
spoke rightly, had gone into a conspiracy.
With me out of the way, the two rogues could
have intimidated the two women and forced a

confession—from Mrs. Brackett, at least—of the

details of our mission which we were holding
back.

Suppose I had been thrown over the rail in
the sou’easter? Not a soul aboard, save the two

most nearly concerned in the plot, would have
known that it was not the result of accident.

Receiving a doubt of Golden from Logy Bill,
I4O

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
at the last moment, I was a fool for not breaking
my contract, losing the advance-money, and hir
ing another ship.
The forenoon watch was the captain's. Dur
ing the afternoon watch, which was the mate's,
iMiss Anstruther came on deck and joined me at
a place where we could talk out of hearing of the
man at the wheel.

“What was that ‘rough experience you had
last night, Mr. Lorry?” Miss Anstruther asked.
“Vandeleur sent for me at two o'clock in the

morning

yy

“And you went?”
“The cabin-boy said he had been hurt, and
wanted to see me,” I continued, with a trace of a
smile. “I wasn’t expecting foul play, you know,
but some one made an attack upon me from be
hind and tried to throw me overboard.”

I saw

the quick pallor rise in her face, and her small
hands grip the rail. “Miss Anstruther,” I mur
mured, “believe me, I should not have told you
this had Captain Golden not aroused your curi
osity.”
“You said, Mr. Lorry,” she returned, leveling
I4 I

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
her steady eyes at me, “that you would tell me
everything.”
“But such rough wor
99

“Is one of the contingencies of this expedi
tion,” she finished. “Did you find out who at
tacked you?” she went on, pushing straight for
the nub of the difficulty.
“I left my mark on the fellow,” I answered,

showing my skinned knuckles.

“We rolled

against the side of the ship, and, before I had a
chance to find out who he was, the blow from
the bulwarks caused me to lose consciousness.”

“But you could find the villain—by your
mark?” She touched her hand against mine as
it lay on the rail. “Did you look for him, Mr.
Lorry?”
“I did,” said I. “I scanned the watch, with
the mate's help, and I went into the fo'c'sle and
looked into the sleeping faces of the watch below.

I also went to the galley and took the doctor’s’
measure.”

“The man wasn’t in the forecastle or the gal
ley?” Her voice was intense and earnest.
“No.”

“Did you observe Mr. Vandeleur particularly?”
I42

A Q_u a r ter to F O ur
“Why, he wouldn’t have the strength, or the
courage, for such an attempt, Miss Anstruther.
Nevertheless, I did observe him.”
“Did he send for you? And, if so, what was
his excuse?”

I told her. Then, as her mind traveled swiftly
along the various circumstantial links in the
chain, her pallor returned and a look of horror
filled her face.

“Captain Golden!” she gasped, and looked
around fearfully, as though half-expecting to see
the treacherous skipper.
“Your reasoning, Miss Anstruther,” said I,
“brings you to the same point which I reached
this morning. You will worry more than ever
now, and that is why I did not want you to
know.”

“It is right that I should know,” she averred,
her lithe form straightening. “You are the main
stay of our venture, Mr. Lorry. Vandeleur un
derstands that, and so does Captain Golden. This
was their plot—to—remove you and then take
whatever part in our plans they chose. The mys
tery, the fact that we are going after a possible
fortune, has aroused Vandeleur's cupidity, and
143

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
he has invoked the aid of the skipper. Ah, it is
plain, plain! And it—it is fiendish!”
Her eyes, ranging forward to where Vandeleur
was sitting on the main hatch, blazed angrily.
“Hereafter,” she continued, a resolute note in
her voice, “you must go armed every minute.”
I tapped the sagging pocket of my coat.
“That suggested itself to me, Miss An
struther.”

“Furthermore,” she pursued, “you must be

wary and watchful.

Everything, Mr. Lorry,

everything depends upon you.”
I remained silent. Events seemed to prove con
clusively that I stood between Mrs. Brackett and
Miss Anstruther, and trickery on the part of
Vandeleur and Captain Golden.
“Do you think,” said Miss Anstruther, as
though by afterthought, “that Captain Golden
notices my dislike? Would he infer from that
that you and I suspect him of underhand deal
ings with us? And if he did draw such an in
ference, could it have had anything to do with

your experience last night?”
She was a wondrously clear-headed girl. The
I44

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
more I talked with her the more my admiration
was aroused by her perspicacity.
“I was going to speak with you about that,
Miss Anstruther,” I replied. “Really, I think
Captain Golden notices how you avoid him. Cer
tainly he could draw no inference from that to
lead to the act of last night; still, if you could be
a little more amiable, it might be well.”

“Am I to act a lie, Mr. Lorry?” The color
crept into her face as she spoke.
“I would not call it that,” said I hastily.

“There is such a thing, you know, as being diplo
matic. In a way, Mrs. Brackett and you and I
are in Captain Golden's power. This is his ship,
and the sailors recognize his authority. When
afloat, a master's authority is a fearsome thing,
for he is often a law unto himself. If Captain
Golden thinks we distrust him, he will do one

of two things. Either he will try to demean him
self in such a way as to set our fears at rest, or
he will go his way, and let us know that he does
not care how we regard him.

“Whichever thing he does,” I added slowly,
“the knowledge that we suspect him will render
him more cautious.

He will be more careful to
I45

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
hide his hand, and hence will be all the more dan

gerous.”
For several minutes Miss Anstruther was in a

brown study. At last a smile, not untinged with
self-reproach, wreathed about her sensitive lips.
“I have been very foolish,” she observed, “but
I am a girl of pronounced opinions. When I dis
like any one, it is hard for me to dissemble.”
“Are you equally generous with those whom
you like?”
What was that inscrutable light that flashed
in her eyes? What would I not have given could
I have interpreted it! The words had no sooner
left my lips than I was angry at my presumption.
“I must go now,” she said, ignoring my ques
tion save for that one swift look. “I see very
clearly, Mr. Lorry, that your well-being depends
in a measure upon myself. Please observe, in
the morning, how good an actress I can be—
upon occasion!”
She would act a lie, as she called it, for the

sole purpose of disarming the skipper in my be
half! My emotions were conflicting as I watched
her flit from sight through the companion.
146

CHAPTER XIV.
The Uncharted Isle.

For a voyage begun under such exciting cir
cumstances, the days following my “rough ex
perience” in the sou'easter passed in an unex
pected dearth of incident. I was at a loss to ac
count for this, except on the supposition that Van

deleur and Captain Golden were holding their
ulterior designs in abeyance.
Miss Anstruther was indeed an actress of no

mean ability. Whether at meals in the cabin
or with Captain Golden on deck, she so favored
him with her wit and her conversational charm

that the crafty sea-dog appeared fairly capti
vated.

The skipper began a stealthy, and, in some re
spects ludicrous, personal overhauling. For in
stance, we noticed one morning that the dingy
green cotton shield which had covered his useless
eye had been replaced with a diamond of yellow
silk; on another morning that he had polished the
brasswork of his coat and sponged from the cloth
I47

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
certain traces of pea soup which had long been in
evidence; and, again, that his torpedo beard had
been freshly though bunglingly trimmed.
Heaven knows what Captain Golden meant by

this. The obvious conclusion was too annoying
for me to consider.

Nor did Miss Anstruther pause here in the
sacrifice she was making, for Vandeleur also was
much in her company, and, to all appearances,
rather high in her good graces. I rebelled in
wardly at this, and perhaps something of jealousy
was mixed up in it.
Nevertheless, it was as good as a show to
watch the antics of the skipper and Vandeleur
whenever Miss Anstruther appeared on deck and

they were within hailing distance. Both men
would hasten toward her, striving to see which
should be first at her side; and the smarting vexa
tion of the one that lost the race always flew to
the surface.

At such times I have noticed the dancing mis
chief in the girl's hazel eyes, and read the soft
raillery in the demure lines of her face. Natur
ally, there fell a growing coolness between Gold
en and Vandeleur.

148

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
Between two such monopolists as these, Miss
Anstruther’s hours on deck were so completely
taken up that Mrs. Brackett and I had perforce
to fall back on each other’s society for diversion.
I will not say that I failed to enjoy the elderly
lady's homely views on life in general, and on
our expedition in particular, but, nevertheless, I
was conscious of the waxing discontent deep
down in my soul.
Nearly every day there were periods, usually
brief, when Miss Anstruther and I met by our
selves. Sometimes these came to us in the cabin,

sometimes on deck, and I began to observe a
change in her manner as well as in her talk.
There was a far-away look in her eyes, an ex
pression half-sad, half-determined, on her face—
when we were alone. For me, too, her conversa
tion dealt in generalities and was burdened with
constraint.

After a while this line of conduct touched my
pride. Had my heart not been so intimately con
cerned, doubtless I should not have begun to
avoid her as I did.

Vandeleur continued to sleep in the fo'c'sle, but
resumed his place at the first table in the cabin
I49

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
soon after Miss Anstruther began to notice him
again. He had ever a cold eye for me, and if
he noticed me at all it was by a curt, perfunctory
nod.

I wondered, along toward the end of the out
ward voyage, if the rivalry and growing coolness
between Captain Golden and Vandeleur had any
thing to do with the eventless days that trooped
after the sou’easter?

Was Miss Anstruther

playing a woman's part to draw the sting of their
conspiracy?
We picked up the steady trades about twenty
five degrees north of the equator, and went foam
ing southeasterly night and day, wing and wing,
our headsails blanketed by the spread of canvas
aft. The ship well-nigh sailed herself, and after
her morning toilet—always punctilious and thor
oughly attended to—the hands idled about in
every available scrap of shade.
The skipper got his time-sight in the morning,
and at noon took the meridian altitude, working
out longitude and latitude together. I tried to
be around while he pricked out course and dis
tance on the chart.

Our daily average run in the trades was two
150

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
hundred and fifty miles, but we had lost a good
deal of time in the light and variable airs off the
coast. Captain Golden had marked a cross on
the spot where our uncharted isle was supposed
to lie, and I noted with quickening pulse each
day’s forward leap toward our destination.
Whenever I mentioned “Fortune Island,” the
captain vouchsafed me a sarcastic look out of his
expressive eye.
“I’ll sail over this island of yours,” he once
told me, “an’, just to convince ye it isn’t there,
I’ll heave the lead an’ get no bottom.”
This was merely talk. If he really thought
there was no such island, why had he and Vande
leur worked together at the beginning of the
cruise? If the island was a myth, conspiracy
between the two would have been a waste of
effort.

The weather grew warmer and warmer as we
bore southward. Flying-fish dropped aboard,
and Anderson got dolphins for us from the
knightheads. This gave us a pleasant variation
of our bill of fare.

For some days I made it a practise to mingle
with the crew during the dog-watches. My pre
151

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
vious impression that the Swedes, Anderson and
Larsen, were the only trustworthy men forward,
was confirmed.

Eph, the “doctor,” was a morose individual and
inclined to be quarrelsome. He talked but little,
and he had a way of avoiding a straightforward
look that convinced me he was tricky, Petie,
the cabin-boy, was no better than a wharf-rat,
with all a wharf-rat's shortcomings. Allison and
Minturn, the American sailors, had the faces and

hangdog airs of a pair of beach-combers. The
|Kanaka was of a gentler but more crafty type of
deep-sea criminal, and Garcia, the Mexican, was
no whit better.

All hands regarded me as the walking personi
fication of a profitable mystery. Curiosity, envy,
and hostility could be read in the covert glances
cast in my direction. In all except the Swedes,
this mixture of emotions was frankly brutal.
My investigations forward were made at the
time I was seeking to avoid Miss Anstruther.
Several times I had seen her alone on the poop,
looking a mute invitation for me to come aft.
Later I reproached myself for my churlishness—
later, when I had discovered the cost to her.
152

A Q_u arter to Four
On an evening, when we were nearly four

weeks out of San Francisco, I stood looking over
the rail, watching a phosphorescent glow turn
the schooner's wake into a pathway of gold.
It was the mate's watch, but I did not know
where he was. The man at the wheel was nod

ding, and the watch probably asleep on the
fo'c'sle-head. The strong breeze, which had not
failed us for days, had dropped to a light wind,
but still came directly over our taffrail.

I was

thinking, as usual, of our strange voyage and
speculating upon the mystery to be revealed at
the end of it.

Suddenly I became aware that some one was
standing near me, likewise peering over the rail
into the golden-tipped waves.
“Miss Anstruther!” I exclaimed.

“Yes, Mr. Lorry,” she answered, resting her
chin on her hand and gazing at me through the
semigloom. “I have been wanting to talk with
you for some time; but you are so preoccupied—
shall I say elusive?—these days, that it has been
difficult to find the opportunity.”
“Your own time has been pretty well taken up,
Miss Anstruther,” I countered, “and for a long
153

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
time Mrs. Brackett saw so much of me that I was

afraid she had begun to tire of my company.”
“And so you went forward to make a study
of the crew! Do the men bear close inspection?”
We were far enough from the wheel to be out
of ear-shot of the helmsman, and I could see no

one else in our near vicinity.
“Two of them, Anderson and Larsen, will bear
close inspection,” said I, “but the rest are rather
too much like Captain Golden.”
With her chin in her hands, she looked off over

the heaving sea.
“I fancy,” she murmured, “that you are vexed
with me. Perhaps,” and there was a trace of
levity in her voice, “you find me too good an
actress?”

I did not reply. A moment of silence, and then
she continued:

“Nothing has happened—to you, I mean
since your ‘rough experience during the south
easter?”

“I would rather have faced treachery every
day from Captain Golden and Vandeleur,” I burst
out, my surging discontent finding its way to my
lips, “rather than—than
99

154

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
I paused lamely, realizing that my heart was
carrying me too far.
She withdrew her eyes from seaward, and,
for a few moments, peered into my face intently.
When she finally spoke, it was with a throbbing
undernote that set every nerve in my body to
tingling.
“Do not misconstrue what I have done, Mr.

Lorry. You cannot know what it has cost me to

follow your advice, or how I have reproached
myself for my conduct even while I acknowl
edged the sordid wisdom of it. Yet, if it has safe
guarded you in any way, my sacrifice of a life
long principle has not been entirely in vain.”
There was a sad little quiver in the final words.
One of her hands had dropped to the rail, and
lay there whitely. By a quick impulse I dropped
my roughened palm over the hand, and the next
instant my love for the girl would have been de
clared.

-

Quickly, however, she withdrew her hand with
a rigid straightening of her body.
“Captain Golden,” she whispered.
The odor of the skipper's everlasting stogy
was blowing back to us. He lounged toward us
155

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
carelessly with some remark concerning the fail
ing wind, and Miss Anstruther bade me a quick
good night and went below.
An hour or two later I followed her, lighter
of heart than I had been at any time since the be
ginning of the voyage. Miss Anstruther had
virtually admitted that all she had done had been
for me.

From my dreams that night I was awakened
in the small hours by a pounding on my state
room door. Recalling another time when I had
received a similar summons, I answered the call

warily. This time it was the skipper who stood
outside, and not the cabin-boy.
“What is the matter, Captain Golden?” I
asked.

“Matter enough!” he cried. “Your con
founded island is right under our forefoot, and
we shall be on a lee shore in less than a brace

of shakes unless a miracle happens. A mess of
rocks, that’s what your island is. Can't you
hear the surf?”

I did hear it, and it was booming dangerously
near.

“We must have made a phenomenal run since
156

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
noon,” I commented. “It is impossible that we
should be near the place. You must have been
off a little in your reckoning.”
“It’s your island that's off its reckoning,” he
fumed.
“But the lookout—”

He swore roundly. “The lookout was asleep,
and here we are drifting in.”
“Isn’t there room enough to wear?”

“Room, but not wind enough. There's a dead
set toward the island, and it's impossible to claw
off. Tell the women to get ready for whatever
happens, an’ then come on deck.”
He whirled and rushed away, while I began
scrambling into my clothes.

157

.

CHAPTER XV.
A Close Call.

As I hurried from my stateroom I met Miss
Anstruther in the cabin.

She had dressed even

more quickly than I had done. I began to tell
her what had happened.
“I heard everything that Captain Golden said,”
she interrupted calmly. “If you want Mrs.
Brackett and me for anything, Mr. Lorry, you
will find us ready and waiting.”
I stared, filled with admiration for her cool
ness and courage.
“You’re a brave girl,” I said, as I flung on
ward up the companion stairs.
When I saw the vast, shadowy bulk of the
island in the dim distance, the inexcusable na
ture of the skipper’s blunder was borne in upon
me.

He had had the deck when we came to such

dangerous quarters with the uncharted coast;
and even though the lookout were asleep the skip
per himself should have been on the alert.

He had made a mistake in his reckoning—of
158

A Q_u a r t e r to F O ur
that I was tolerably sure. Perhaps, too, at the
critical moment he had been steeped in one of
those reveries of his and had not awakened to

the peril of the ship until too late.
The schooner had been brought by the wind on
the best tack to haul offshore, and Captain Golden
was anxiously watching the effect of our change
of course.

But the move would not serve.

The

current was dragging us three feet toward the
reef for every foot that the light wind helped
us away from it.
All hands were on deck, silently waiting for

orders. The mate was in the chains, watching
the casts of the lead. “No bottom,” was his con

tinual call. Our only hope, just then, seemed to
lie in finding holding-ground for our anchors.
“Off soundings,” was the despairing comment
of the skipper. “Might as well try to run out a
line to Chiny as to anchor here.”
“But if the boats were in the water

9

He whirled on me with an oath, reminded me

that I was a passenger, that my devilish cruise
was like to cost him enough, and would I put a
stopper on my jaw-tackle before he knocked me
overboard?

He had asked me to come on deck,
I59

A Q_u arter to Four
and in any other circumstances he would probably
have won a retort in kind. As it was, I held my
peace and stared at the smother of foam, white in
the moonlight, toward which we were rapidly
drifting.
Yet he was right about the boats. The current
was uncontrollable, and they would have been
useless.

Reefs of the Pacific, particularly coral reefs,
are usually steep-to on their seaward side, so
that only a jump takes a ship from off soundings
right into the breakers. At that moment I
wouldn’t have given a copper cent for the Lady
May's chances.

Quite naturally, my thoughts of probable dis
aster brought Mrs. Brackett and Miss Anstruther

vividly before my mind. The skipper would have
none of my advice as to the management of his
ship, and, so far as the ship was concerned, he
was welcome to the exercise of his own judgment,
good, bad, or indifferent; but, in the present in
stance, bound up with the fate of the schooner
were my life and the lives of the two ladies. I
had a suggestion to make, as Golden's helpless
ness became more and more apparent.
16o

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“With your permission, captain,” said I, “and
the help of a couple of hands, I'll take the dory
from the stern davits, pull to leeward, and try
the soundings. It’s a slim chance, I know, but
if we don’t find holding-ground somewhere be
tween here and the reef we’ll be stove in in less
than half an hour.”

I could see his one eye glimmer balefully in the
dusk, consequently his answer was a surprise.
“Go ahead,” he growled, “if it will be any sat
isfaction to you.”
“Give me Anderson and Larsen,” said I.
He called the two men aft, gave them their
orders, and the dory was got into the water. In
less than five minutes we were foaming to lee
ward, the Swedes bending to their oars, while I
stood in the stern-sheets and made frequent casts
with the hand-lead.

I had already made up my mind that the island
was not of coral formation—it bulked too large
against the moonlit sky for that. More likely it
was of volcanic origin, and I had hopes of get
ting bottom at some point nearer the outlying
reef.

I was presently able to see as well as to hear
I61

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
the long, formidable ground-swells as they broke
over the rocks and churned the space beyond into
seething white.
As I surveyed the creaming ridge, and the cur
rent sucked us steadily toward it, I noticed what
looked like a belt of smooth water piercing the
line of breakers. We were perhaps forty fathoms
away, and I swerved the dory to a course that

would lay it well into the smooth belt, hoping in
my soul that it might prove a swashway leading
to safe anchorage beyond.
My surmise was correct. I got bottom at ten
fathoms in the swashway, and beyond, in com
paratively quiet waters, at eight fathoms.
This was infinitely more than I had dared to

hope for. The dory was put about and we fought
our way back through the passage.

The ship was still steering by the wind, and
still setting in toward the reef at frightful speed.
“Ahoy, the schooner!” I called.
“Well?” came Golden's hoarse response.
“Have you steerageway, Captain Golden?”
“Just about.”

“Then follow the dory, if you can, and have
everything in readiness to anchor.”
162

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“Do you know what you’re doin', Lorry?”
shouted the skipper. “Mind ye don’t make a bad
matter worse.”

A tart reply was on my tongue, but I smoth
ered it back. For a short space I was in doubt
whether Golden would adopt my suggestion;
then, with a feeling of relief, I heard him order
the helm up.
Slowly the schooner's bows fell off, then she
began forging ahead with speed increasing by
degrees. I kept the dory far enough to wind
ward to give the schooner plenty of room; then,
at the right moment, we darted into the passage.

Threading that swashway was ticklish business
for the Lady May, but I kept the dory in the lead
of her, sounding as we went. A few minutes
took us beyond the reef, and a few minutes later
the schooner followed.

Standing in the stern-sheets, I watched until
the Lady May had gained the proper position,
when I shouted for Golden to anchor.

The roar of the breakers prevented me from
hearing much of what took place on the schooner,
but I saw her wear smartly with her headsails

and foresail coming down. The main boom was
163

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
hauled amidships as she came into the wind, and
then the welcome splash of the anchor shivered

through the boom of the surf. The schooner
took her scope of cable freely and was finally
brought up. I drew a deep breath and told the
men to lay the dory alongside.
“I think the old man can thank you for saving
the ship, sir,” said Anderson.
Larsen agreed with his mate, and the tones of
both, it struck me, carried more respect than an
able seaman ever feels for a landsman.

“The schooner has a safe enough berth for

the present, my lads,” I answered, “but it will
be well to hunt a safer one in the morning. We
should have trouble in plenty if our cable were
to chafe off on sharp rocks at the bottom.”
As I came over the schooner's side, the skip
per's greeting was characteristic.
“Damned lucky I thought o' havin’ ye go off
in the boat an’ try for soundings,” said he.

“”Twas the only thing under heaven that saved
the old hooker.”

I let it go at that and went below. Mrs. Brack

ett sat in one of the cabin chairs wringing her
164

-

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
hands. Miss Anstruther stood beside her, try
ing to be of comfort.
“Has—has the ship been wrecked, Mr. Lor
ry?” asked Mrs. Brackett, lifting her distressed
face to mine. “Are we all goin’ to the bottom?”
“No, indeed, Mrs.

Brackett,” I answered

cheerily; “the schooner is safe at anchor, and
we're a good eight fathoms from the bottom.”

“Thank goodness!”

Mrs. Brackett straight

ened up, and her face cleared. “I’ve had Zelda
lookin’ all around for a cork-belt, or whatever

it is they use when there’s a shipwreck. This is
the island we’ve come to find, is it?”

“Undoubtedly.”
“I declare I’m glad of that, even if it did come
near bein’ the end of us.”

“You and Miss Anstruther had better go back
to bed, now,” I advised, “and get all the rest you
can.

There’ll be work for us ashore to-mor

row.”

Mrs. Brackett got up and tottered toward her

stateroom. Miss Anstruther lingered to say:
“And it was you who saved us, Mr. Lorry
Petie told me that much,” then gave me a daz

165

A Q_u a r ter to Four
zling smile before she turned to follow Mrs.
Brackett.

Next morning I heard excited voices on deck,
and hurried up to investigate. Our cable hadn’t
parted—that much was evident—and I was at a
loss to account for the commotion.

Golden, Stubbs, and Vandeleur were gathered
in a group by the starboard rail, surveying some

object through a glass. This object, I could see
with my naked eye, was the hull of a wrecked
and dismasted boat, broken across the reef and

with her stern just awash.
“Some other fellow blundered in here in the

dark, I reckon,” observed Captain Golden, care
fully studying the wreck through the glass. “‘G’
is the first letter, an’ the next is “A.” Now, wait

till she rolls again. Ah, ah! There—” His

hand fell to his side, and his one

eye ranged
amazedly from the mate to me, and from me to
Vandeleur. “Holy mackerel! Why, that's the
old Gazelle, o’ 'Frisco.”
Vandeleur gave a jump and uttered an
astounded exclamation.

The next moment he

turned slowly around and stared at me.
166

CHAPTER XVI.

An Enemy Unmasks.
“I wouldn’t give the fag-end o nothin’, as the
man says,” pursued Captain Golden, again sizing
up the wreck, “for Trent’s chances when his
brigantine hit that bunch o' rocks. Cap'n 'Gene
never crossed my hawse but once, but that was
enough. I never see such a misbemannered sou’
wegian—reg'lar mixture o’ bear, buff'lo, bandi
coot, an’ crockydile. Now that Jones has pulled
him under, though, I reckon we'll not think of
anythin' but the good he had in him, even if it

does take a mikerscope to find it. That wreck got
anythin’ to do with your business here, Lorry?”
“Perhaps it has and perhaps it hasn’t,” I an

swered. As a matter of fact, I did not know my
self, although the skipper considered my reply
evasive.

“I’m not of a pryin’ disposition, Lorry,” went
on the skipper, with a snap of the jaws, “but your
expectations is goin’ to be knocked flat aback if
ye don’t make up your mind to be a little more
167

A Q_u a r ter to Four
confidin’.

I reckon that's all.

While we take a

pasear below, Mr. Stubbs, an' hit up the chow,
you’d better get out one of the boats an look for
a better anchorage.”
Before following the skipper to the cabin I
gave the island a critical survey. It looked bleak
enough from seaward—a sandy beach bordered
with a broken jumble of rocks, and back of the
rocks a steep cliff fifty feet in the sheer. As far
as I could see, there was not a patch of green
anywhere.
Yet certainly this was Fortune Island. The
wreck of the Gazelle bore vague but substantial
testimony to that.
Mrs.

Brackett and Miss

Anstruther

were

vastly interested when informed of the wreck.

The former came near to saying something that
trenched directly on our mission, but Miss An

struther gave her a look that brought her to her
SenSeS.

Golden noticed the elderly lady's half-slip and
the glance that had corrected it. His eye glim
mered vindictively, although he said nothing.

There was a change in the skipper's treatment
of Miss Anstruther, for he was now brusk to the
168

A Q_u arter to Four
verge of insolence. Had he been skulking about
the deck the evening before, I pondered, and
overheard some of the talk between Miss An

struther and myself?
Whether or no this was the case, yet the skip
per's attitude toward the girl started my temper.
A short step farther and we should fall afoul of
each other.

The mate's explorations in the boat were
highly successful. He reported a sheltered cove
with good holding-ground, a beach of sand and
gravel easy for landing, and-best of all—a safe
passage to leeward when we were ready for sea
OnCe n'Ore.

Fortune Island lay under the northeast trades,
and to work out of the swashway against wind
and current would have been a difficult proposi
tion. An accessible cove with a passage to lee
ward, however, tided us over this difficulty.
Mrs. Brackett and Miss Anstruther were for

being rowed ashore at once.
“If the ‘doctor’ will put us up a lunch,” said
I to Captain Golden, “we’ll land and spend the
day on the island.”
“I shouldn’t like anything better,” answered
169

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
the skipper, “than to stretch my legs on the beach.
An' I don’t suppose Vandeleur will object to a
day ashore, either.”

“The ladies and I will spend the day on the
island alone,” I observed bluntly, and brought
Golden up with a round turn. “For the work
we are going to do we wish to have the island
to ourselves, and even Vandeleur is barred.”

“Well, sink me!” The skipper drew back and
took my sizing ironically. “You don’t have any
idea, now,” he drawled, “that you own every un
charted turtleback in the two oceans?”

“I have a very clear idea,” I frowned, “that I
am paying you good money to obey orders. You
will set Mrs. Brackett, Miss Anstruther, and me
ashore, this morning, and call for us late in the
afternoon.”

With that I whirled on my heel and went to
collect some traps which we were to take with us.

The impedimenta consisted of a hundred feet of
stout rope, some candles and matches tightly
wrapped in a water-proof covering, my two re
volvers with a good supply of cartridges, and the
short-bladed machete.

The “doctor” had the hamper of food ready,
170

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
when I came on deck, and the ladies were wait

ing. The dory was alongside, manned by Alli
son and Minturn, with Captain Golden in the
stern-sheets.

Vandeleur had drawn Miss An

struther apart and was protesting wrathfully
against being left behind.
“I can do nothing, Mr. Vandeleur,” I heard
the girl say. “Mr. Lorry has entire charge, and
you and the rest of us must do exactly as he
thinks best. Your interests will not suffer in any
way, I can promise you that.”

The sailors watched curiously while I threw
my traps into the boat; and while I was helping
the ladies over the side, and Golden was assisting
them below. Vandeleur rushed up to me and
shook a puny fist in my face.
“By Jove!” he cried, “if you don’t act square
with me you'll wish you had!”
“Don’t make a show of yourself before the
men,” I counseled, in a low tone. “And you
may rest assured, Vandeleur, that we will deal
squarely with you—in spite of your trickery and
crookedness.”

Thereupon I gained the boat and we pushed
off, Vandeleur looking over the side and glaring
171

A Q_u a r ter to Four
at me until we vanished into a narrow, high
walled passage that led to the cove. The mate,
at the time, was making ready to warp the
schooner to her safer anchorage.

The passage between the rocks was about ten
fathoms wide and thirty long. Traversing this,
we came out into a little lagoon, sheltered on all

sides by high bluffs, with the leeward channel
mentioned by the mate opening off at the farther
end.

In this small but

perfect haven the

roar of

the surf was so deadened that we could hear the

whisper of waves on the shingle.
An ancient volcanic upheaval had split away
the northern segment of the island, forming the
lagoon and leaving the two channels to east and
west. On our right was a clifflike wall, and on
our left was a smooth, sloping beach leading up
ward to a barren rift in the rocks.

The kelp-fringed shore gave off a salty, re
freshing odor, and I noticed a rill of water flow
ing into the lagoon by a devious course, appar
ently coming out of the cleft above the beach.
But there were no trees, no verdure, nothing but
scoriated rocks as far as the eye could reach. Yet
the smooth, still water, the lap of waves on the
172

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
gravel, the grateful smell of the seaweed, the
heat-tempering touch of the trade-wind, and the
prospect of an easy landing with a thrilling mys
tery near solution, brought happiness to Miss
Anstruther's hazel eyes and a look of compla
cency to Mrs. Brackett's face.

The one jarring note was the skipper. He was
taciturn, wore a black scowl, and his single eye
flashed with ominous portent. I imagined that
he had not yet recovered from my show of au
thority.
We got the boat to the beach, and I assisted
the ladies to land.

I had thrust the revolvers

through my belt, and, after Allison had thrown
out the coil of rope, the parcel wrapped in oil
skin, and the machete, Captain Golden sprang out
on the sand and faced me squarely.
“A word with you,” said he savagely. “As the
man says, one or the other o' us has got to toe
the mark, an’ it's high time we settled which.”
Mrs. Brackett and Miss Anstruther drew

closer together, the latter setting down the ham
per which she had brought from the boat, and
both regarding the skipper with distrust and fore
boding.
173

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“I supposed,” said I easily, “that we had set
tled that point when we signed our contract.”
“What happens afloat, an’ what happens
ashore,” barked Golden, “is two different things.
Your money pays for the Lady May, an’ when
ye're aboard her ye're cock o’ the walk. On solid
ground, however, ye're no more to me than a
castaway, an’ your representative on the schooner
is Vandeleur.” He grinned fiendishly over the
quip.
“Vandeleur is my guest,” I parried sharply,
“and not my representative.”
“In which case, as captain I’m to do as I see

fit?”
“You are to anchor the schooner in this cove

subject to my orders,” said I sternly.

“Anythin ye tell me on shore goes into one
ear an’ out the other,” he snarled.

“Lord it as

ye please on deck, but here”—he flourished a
doubled fist in my face, probably taking his pat
tern from Vandeleur—“give me any o' your lip,
an’ I’ll stave in your headlights.”
I turned to the ladies.

“Miss Anstruther,” I requested, “please take
Mrs. Brackett and go up to that arroyo, yonder.”
174

“AVAST, YoU Two ! HELP THE SKIPPER INTo The BoA.T.”

Page 175.

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
As I spoke I pointed to the cleft in the hills
above the beach.

“No,” she objected firmly, “we will stay right
here. Captain,” and here she turned appealingly
toward Golden, “surely you understand that you
are as much under Mr. Lorry's authority while
we are on the island as you are while we are
on the ship.”
“It’s none o' your put-in,” he growled, ducking
his head toward the girl. “What're you, any
way, I’d like to know? Helpin’ Lorry, hey?
Playin' off me an' Vandeleur against each other
with that glib-gabbed tongue o' yours
I suffered him to get that far, but flesh and
9%

blood could stand no more.

I let him have the

weight of my fist on the point of his heavy lower
jaw, and he sprawled backward, flat on the sand,
with heels in the air.

Allison and Minturn started toward me, but I

whipped out one of the revolvers and they
dropped back.
“Avast, you two!” I cried sharply. “Help the
skipper into the boat and pull back to the
schooner. Sharp's the word, my lads!”
Captain Golden lay heaving on the beach like a
175

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
gudgeon that has been overlong out of the water.
He was stunned and bewildered, almost uncon
scious.

The sailors lifted him into the boat, pushed
off, tumbled aboard themselves, and fell to with
the oars. I put the coil of rope over my shoulder,
picked up the oilskin parcel, the machete, and the
hamper, and started up the slope of the beach.
“Come, Miss Anstruther,” said I, “bring Mrs.
Brackett and let us go about our work.”
“You—you shouldn’t have done that, Mr. Lor
ry,” murmured the girl, a mist of tears in her
eyes as she looked after the retreating boat.
“He pushed me beyond endurance,” I answered
shortly.
“I know, but it wasn’t policy.”
“There are times, Miss Anstruther, when it is
a man’s part to throw policy to the winds. That
was one of the times.”

Then I marched on up the slope, my compan
ions following slowly and talking excitedly as
they came.

CHAPTER XVII.
A Gruesome Fend.

Miss Anstruther was right. Laying violent
hands on the skipper, at that stage of our under
taking, was far from being good policy. Yet,
given the same excuse, I should have repeated the
lesson and defied the consequences.
I couldn’t understand what had come over the

man.

I knew he was fond of his bottle, and I

had been told that he went to excess with it when

in port or when laid up elsewhere so the schooner
could spare him, and I could only imagine that
he had taken a drop too much that morning.
It was a bad beginning for our work on the
island, and I felt sure my companions would be
depressed by it. At the opening of the cleft
through the hills I paused and waited for the
ladies to come up with me. As they were coming
slowly, I had time to lay down the stuff I was
carrying and climb to the highest bank.
From that elevated point I obtained a good
view of the entire island. It was small, and lit
177

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
tle more than the top of a submarine mountain
pushed above the surface of the sea.
In shape, the island was an irregular circle,
higher toward the west and diminishing in a
series of “steps” toward the east. Its whole ex
tent was crossed and recrossed with rocky and
dismally barren ridges.

Following the angling cleft with my eyes I
observed, farther eastward, a thin strip of green
grass, bordering the brook. This was all the
herbage I could see.

There was a bend in the cleft, however, just
beyond the grass, and what lay farther on could
only be ascertained by investigation. Slipping
down the sterile hillside, I rejoined my compan
ions.

“Did you see our promised land from up there,
Mr. Lorry?” asked Miss Anstruther, seeking
bravely to hide the perturbation aroused by the
affair on the beach.

“It is a very barren land,” I smiled, “so far as
tropical islands go. Still, we did not come here
hunting breadfruit and coconuts, so we have no

cause to feel discouraged. The most promising
178

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
thing on the island is this valley, and we will fol
low the brook.”

Before picking up my burdens I knelt and took
a drink of the water. It was deliciously cool and
sweet. Opening the hamper, I took out a tin
cup and filled it for Mrs. Brackett.
Mrs. Brackett was not so successful at hiding
her feelings as was Miss Anstruther, and she
continued to be very nervous and excited. Never
theless, between us Miss Anstruther and I suc

ceeded in calming her fears.
A hundred yards brought us to the narrow
carpet of grass, and another hundred yards took
us around the turn in the valley. Here we made
a discovery indeed, for we came upon a small
hut, evidently built of materials from the wreck
of the Gazelle.

“A house!” cried Mrs. Brackett; then, impelled
by a wild but pathetic impulse, she hurried for

ward, calling: “Tom! Tom!”
Miss Anstruther and I, lingering behind for a
moment, exchanged sad glances. “It—it isn’t
possible there is any one here, is it, Mr. Lorry?”
the girl asked, thinking no doubt of the possibility
of finding her brother.
179

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
I shook my head.
“If we found any one here it would probably
be some one from the wreck of the Gazelle,”

said I; “and you may be sure that if there were
any castaways on the island they would long
since have made themselves known to us.”

I noted the hut wonderingly as we approached.
It was sided with sandalwood strips and roofed
with a couple of hatch-covers, rotten tarpaulins
filling out the space between the walls. A section
of cabin skylight served for a window, and the
door had evidently once closed the entrance to a
stateroom. A stovepipe projected from the roof.
The hut contained but a single room, and there
were four berths arranged against the walls, in
two tiers. The floor was of sand, and a table
stood in the center of it, with four chairs placed
one at each side in orderly fashion. At one end
of the room was a galley stove.
Not far from the stove was a box-cupboard,
swung against the wall. Neatly piled in the cup
board were four tin plates, four tin cups, four
spoons, four knives and forks.
In a corner, close to the cupboard, was a pile
of tinned meat and vegetables, also a bag of
18O

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
moldy ship's bread, overturned and spilling out
on the floor. There were blankets in the bunks,
and a smoky smell about the interior of the hut
that suggested human habitation.
Miss Anstruther and I stood just within the
door while we made our survey. Mrs. Brackett,
her wild hopes disappointed, leaned dispiritedly
against the table.
“Tom ain't here,” she said dully; “there ain’t
any one here.”
“You didn’t really expect to find your son, did
you, Mrs. Brackett?” I asked gently.
“Why not?” she burst out. “Why shouldn't I
expect to find Tom, I want to know? Don’t you
think he had anything to do with sending us here,
Mr. Lorry?”
“Who sent us here is still a mystery, as well
as why we were sent here.”

“The teak-wood cases—” began Miss An
struther, and paused.

“The ten teak-wood cases,” I finished, “we
shall doubtless find in the sea-cavern. What they
contain will probably be our sole reward for com
ing here. Apart from that—and even that is
supposition—we know nothing.”
181

A Q_u a r t e r to F O ur
“All the furnishings of the hut,” suggested
Miss Anstruther, “seem to be made up of groups
of four. Plainly,” she deduced, with a specula
tive air, “there were four survivors of the wreck
of the Gazelle.”

“And I would hazard the opinion,” I added,
“that those four were Captain Eugene Trent,
Archibald Anstruther, Thomas Brackett, and Ar
thur Mayhew.”
“If my boy was here,” demanded Mrs. Brack
ett, her reason obscured by hope and anxiety,
“then why ain’t he here now?”
“Perhaps they were all taken away by a ship,”
said Miss Anstruther.

“If he was taken away by a ship, he'd have
come home to me,” persisted Mrs. Brackett.
“No,” she went on after a moment, her voice

quivering with conviction, “if Tom was here,
then he's here now—and I’m goin’ to find him.”

The poor woman, for whose grief and despair
Miss Anstruther and I had nothing but deepest
compassion, left the hut and started along a faint
path that led onward down the slope of the bleak
valley. Miss Anstruther and I followed her.
A pile of broken and splintered wreckage lay
182

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
back of the hut, and seemingly had furnished the
castaways with fire-wood. Not far from the
wreckage the ground was littered with empty
meat and vegetable tins.
“The castaways, whoever they were,” I ven
tured, “must have remained on the island for
some time. This pathway is well worn, and is
still easily followed, although months must have
passed since it was last used.”
Miss Anstruther did not answer.

Her head

was bowed in pensive thought. Mrs. Brackett
was not the only one to be grievously disap

pointed. The girl, I knew, had entertained hopes
of finding her brother somewhere along that trail
of mystery.
The path ended at a spring which bubbled out
of the rocks, dropped into a pool, and then trick
led away down the valley. Mrs. Brackett had
kept on and vanished from sight around another
turn that lay ahead of us.
Miss Anstruther and I followed, suddenly ac
celerating our pace when a plaintive, grief-strick
en cry smote upon our ears from the distance.
Wondering and fearful, we hastened around a
183

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
projecting spur of rocks and found Mrs. Brackett
upon her knees beside an oblong mound.
There were four of the mounds, for the sig
nificant grouping of fours was carried out even
here. At each mound was a headboard, neatly
squared and neatly lettered. Each character in
the several inscriptions had been painstakingly
carved in the wood.

The legend on the headboard of the first grave,
where Mrs. Brackett was kneeling, read thus:
“Sacred to the Memory of Thomas Brackett, Who
Died of Injuries Received During the Wreck of the
Gazelle.”

Miss Anstruther and I read the inscription
and passed slowly on to the next grave. Here
the inscription was identically the same, except
that the board bore the name of “Archibald An

struther.”

The girl leaned against the head

board, and buried her face in her hands.

I went on to the next mound. Under that lay
“Captain Eugene Trent,” who had likewise met
his end through the wrecking of his ill-fated
brigantine.
There was no one to mourn for Captain Trent.
Even had Vandeleur been there, there would have
184

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
been no sorrowing over the grave of the dead
skipper.
The next mound, I felt sure, would hide one of

my own kin. But in this I was mistaken. The
headboard marked the final resting-place of
“Three Sailors,” whose bodies had been washed
ashore.

I stood beside that last grave and pondered.
What had become of my cousin, Arthur May
hew P

It must have been he who had laid away the
others, and had erected the headboards, with their

inscriptions. Naturally, there would have been
mo one left to perform the last sad rites when
his turn came.

Why had we not found his remains in the hut?
Surely, there, if anywhere, his end would have
overtaken him.

-

Then came another thought:

Had not the

same hand that had laid away these men, and so
carefully commemorated their last resting-places,
been the one to send those four cards their sev

eral ways?
If such was the case, then Arthur Mayhew
185

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
must still be among the living. Yet, if so, why
was he not there, in person? Why had he quar
tered that card of instructions? Above all, why
was he not claiming his share of the contents
supposed to be in the ten teak-wood cases?

CHAPTER XVIII.
The Sea-cavern.

Words are sometimes inadequate to express
our truest feelings. I find them so in trying to
do full justice to Zelda Anstruther's courage and
helpfulness at this dark period of our fortunes.
Our gruesome discovery shocked us into reali
zation of the vanities of earthly aims and ambi
tions. I needed the lesson, and profited by it.
Of late, my mind had been growing more and
more sordid in dealing with the outcome of our
expedition. There were fortunes to be had at the
rainbow’s end, and the thought of mere gain is
always brutalizing.
The sight of those two women in tears touched
and softened me. If our enterprise accomplished
nothing more than a knowledge of the fate of a
son and a brother, even yet it was worth the
price we had paid in money and hardship.
In a little while Miss Anstruther came to my
side. She was her calm, brave self again, and
suggested that we get Mrs. Brackett back to the
187

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
hut. Miss Anstruther thought that she could
minister to the poor woman and stem the torrent
of her grief with more success if she were re

moved from that heart-breaking spot.
I silently acquiesced, and we supported Mrs.
Brackett to the spring, and back along the path
to the cabin. An hour later, when the distraught
woman began to gain some control over herself,
we had luncheon.

After luncheon I picked up my coil of rope, my
oilskin parcel, and my machete, excused myself
for a time, and started for the door.

“Where are you going, Mr. Lorry?” asked
Miss Anstruther.

“To investigate the sea-cavern.”
She looked worried.

“Must you do that to-day? I hate to have you
go alone, and yet I feel as though I—”
She finished with a significant glance at the
bowed head of our companion.
“We are in such a state of uncertainty with
regard to Captain Golden,” I answered, “that I
feel as though we should be no longer about our
work than is absolutely necessary. What I am
188

A Q_u art e r to Four
going to do now I can do best alone. Will you
remain here until I come back?”

She looked at me steadily for a moment.
“Yes,” she replied.
I hesitated for a space, then drew one of my
revolvers from my belt and laid it on the table.
“So far as I can see,” I went on, “there is
not the least reason in the world why you should
need that, but, nevertheless, I am going to leave
it. Perhaps you will feel safer.”
She thanked me with a glance, and I went on
out of the cabin and started eastward along the
valley. At the spur beyond the spring I looked
back.

Miss Anstruther stood in the doorway watch
ing me. She started suddenly to withdraw as I
turned, but paused and waved her hand encour
agingly. I lifted my hat to her, then faced about
and strode onward.

Passing the headboards, which stood as so
many mute details of the greater mystery, I ha
stened my steps and came finally to a place where
the valley angled sharply to the south and to the

sea. Climbing the eastern slope of the angle, I
..won to a flat crest whose wall dropped sheer
189

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
downward to the breakers.

Somewhere in that

wall should be the entrance to the sea-cavern.

This, the easternmost scrap of the island,
measured no more than five hundred feet across.

The average drop to sea-level from the brow of
the cliff I judged to be about fifty feet.

To locate the mouth of the cavern properly a
boat should have been used, with two stout oars
men like the Swedes.

For me a boat was mani

festly out of the question, inasmuch as the use of
one would have given every man in the schooner
an inkling of our business.
Later, it might be, a boat would have to be
used, but not until I had investigated the cavern
and mapped out a suitable course of procedure.
Just now my business was to find the opening
into the wall.

Looking downward, the wall itself gave no
suggestion of a breach. But what the wall failed
to tell the breaking waves made manifest.
There was one spot, directly below a point mid
way across the top of the cliff, where the waves
did not break against the rocks. There was no
spray, supposably, because the waves found no
obstruction to break against. In other words, the
Ioo

A Q_u a r ter to F O ur
seas rushed unimpeded into the mouth of the cav
CTIl.

Lying flat down on the top of the cliff, I let my
eyes rove searchingly across the face of the wall.
A shelflike ledge jutted out from the rocks, above
the turmoil of the waves, although well within
reach of the spindrift.
The shelf could not be more than two feet

across, at the widest, and scarcely more than six

feet in length. It offered foothold, however, and
a point of vantage for further discoveries.
Rising to my feet, I looked around me, and to
the westward, where the schooner was anchored.

The rising rocks in that direction hid the ship
entirely. I was alone and unwatched, and could
proceed with my work.
My first move was to make the end of the rope

fast to a boulder which lay on the brink and al
most over the shelf. In order to keep the rope
from chafing against the sharp edges of the boul
der, I padded it with my coat on the side that was
to receive the brunt of the “pull.” Also, I cush
ioned the angle, over which the rope turned down
ward, with my hat.

Then I stripped off my shoes and shirt, tied
191

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
the oilskin packet to the back of my belt with my
cotton handkerchief, slipped the machete into the
front of the belt near the revolver, and lowered

myself over the brink. Used to ropework as I

was, the downward climb was not difficult.

I

was pleased to note, too, that my old wound did
not bother me.

A few minutes brought me to the shelf; and
to my intense satisfaction I found that the shelf
hung directly alongside the mouth of the cavern.
So far, everything had gone swimmingly; and I
was not long in discovering that the rest of my
work would have to go swimmingly, if I wanted
to get inside the cavern.

From my limited base of operations, I gath
ered that the opening into the cliff was perhaps
forty feet across, with its top a dozen feet above
the smooth water. Pulling off my stockings, and
weighting them down on the ledge with the ma
chete and the revolver, I tied a bowline knot in

the end of the rope, pushed the rope through the
loop and drew the bight taut around my body,
under the arms.

.

Possibly I had thirty feet of leeway before I
should take up all the slack of my life-line. This,
192

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
I hoped, would be enough to land me on the sub
terranean beach of the cavern.

With a final look upward, to make sure that all
was right, I slipped from the ledge and was im
mediately sucked into the black maw of the cav
ern with dizzying swiftness. So fierce was the
inset of the waves that the current itself upbore
me with very little swimming.
When I brought up at the end of the rope it
was with a jar that almost dislocated my neck.
For a few moments I bobbed up and down like a
hooked fish, the spray from the broken current
nearly smothering me.
Then I began swimming in good earnest, de
scribing an arc about the bend of the rope at the
cavern-mouth. I was thirty feet from daylight,
and the darkness was so intense that I could not

see my hand before my eyes.
I swam into a wall to my left, but it was an
overhanging wall, with the bottom of it worn
away by action of the water. I “sounded,” ho
ping to touch bottom, but failed in my expecta
tions, and propelled myself to the surface again.
Presently, I struck out for the opposite side of
the cavern, and there my feet grounded in sand,
193

A Q_u a r t e r to

Four

and I groped my dripping way up a slope through
thick darkness. As soon as I found myself clear
of the water, I sank down to rest and recover

breath before continuing farther.
In five minutes I had taken my matches and
candles from their water-proof covering, and had

struck a light.

The candle's gleams fought

ifeebly with the opaque gloom. Nothing short of
a powerful arc-light could have given me an in
stantaneous and comprehensive view of my situa
tion.

Stygian waves, rolling out of a wall of shadow,
broke over the sand at my feet. An impenetrable
curtain seemed to surround and shut me in, over
head and on all sides.
The hollow roar of the surf echoed and rever

berated thunderously between the rocky walls.
Walking up the gloomy beach, I gained the wall
at ten paces.

Keeping close to the perpendicular rocks, I
traversed an irregular half-circle before I again
found my way barred by the breaking surf. I
had skirted the confines of the underground

beach and had reached the overhanging wall
I94

HERE IN THE CAVERN I HAD COME UPON THE TEAKWOOD

CASE8.

Page 195.

A Q_u a r ter to

Four

which had defied me just within the cavern's
mouth.

Turning back, I retraced my course at a dis
tance of some two yards from the wall. Not
more than fifty paces from the turning-point I
stumbled against something.
I stooped and swept the candle-light over the
object. A box! One of the teak-wood cases!
As though under violent compression the
breath rushed from my lungs and seemed to carry
every ounce of my strength with it. I sank down
on the box, and the candle shivered in my hand.
We had found the island, the uncharted island,
lying where our mysterious instructions had
placed it. I had found the cavern situated at the
island’s eastern extremity; and here, in the cav
ern, I had come upon the teak-wood cases.
As step by step we had followed our strange
clue, I could look back and see that my confidence
in the final result had waxed stronger and
stronger as we proceeded. I had expected to find
the teak-wood cases, so I was at a loss to account
for that sudden rush of weakness when I did
find them.

There were fortunes in those ten boxes. What
195

A Q_u a r ter to

Four

the treasure consisted of I did not know, yet I
could have staked my life that an equal division
of it meant fortunes for four of us.

But were there ten boxes? My conviction in
this regard was as firm as in every other; never
theless I sprang up on the instant and investi
gated.
Yes, there were ten cases, in five piles of two
each. I tried to push one of the upper boxes with
my free hand. It resisted the push like so much
solid iron.

Setting down the candle, I took both hands to

the box. I lifted it, barely. The weight I placed
roughly at one hundred and fifty pounds.
Spurred by feverish curiosity, I hunted for a
stone, intent on breaking open one of the boxes,
to see what it contained.

I found the stone, but

the strong black wood resisted my efforts.
Each box was strongly made and crossed four
times with bands of strap-iron. Only a cold
chisel and hammer could have forced one of the
COVerS.

It was useless for me to remain in the cavern

any longer. I had found out all that I could, and

had made assurance doubly sure. The next step
196

A Q_u a r t e r to F our
was to consult with Miss Anstruther and devise

ways and means for getting the treasure aboard
the Lady May and safeguarding it against a
venomous skipper, a treacherous companion, and
a piratical crew. This was a task to call for all
our tact, shrewdness, and courage.
With a final look at the black cases, shimmer

ing like ebony under the candle's light, I went
back to the place where I had left the end of
my life-line anchored to a stone.

The line was there. Whether it was high tide
in the cavern or not I did not know, but I care
fully stowed my reserve supply of candles and
matches high up in a niche of the rocky wall.
The half-consumed candle I planted upright
in the sand and left burning. I could watch it
as a beacon while hand-over-handing my way
along the rope and against the current.
Placing the loop over my head, I dropped it to

my armpits and pulled it tight; then I threw my
self into the water and began drawing at the
rope. It yielded so readily to the pull that I mar
veled at the amount of slack lying between me
and the mouth of the cavern.

From marveling my mind leaped to doubt, from
197

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
doubt to fear, and from fear to the horror of a

supreme conviction. The other end of the rope
had been cast from its fastening at the brink of
the cliff!
Staggering ashore, with the limp rope in my
hands, I sprawled backward at full length on the
sands, my stony eyes on the mocking flicker of
the candle.

CHAPTER XIX.

The Jaws of Death.
All that the loosening of the rope signified did
not appear at once. As my power to reason re
turned the vista of probabilities opened with a
plausible deadliness that took my breath.
I had protected the cliff end of the rope so well
that I knew it had not chafed apart. Neverthe
less, I hauled it in, foot by foot, until I had the
end in my hands, and could examine it.
The wide loop was just as I had tied it. It
had been lifted bodily over the top of the boulder
and cast from the cliff.

With this to start from, my line of probabili
ties developed. I had been watched when I made
the descent to the cavern, and some one—it may
have been Captain Golden, or it may have been
Vandeleur—had hoped to make an end of me by
displacing the rope.
We were back again to the situation as it stood
on the Lady May at the time of the nor'easter.
By eliminating me, Golden and Vandeleur could
199

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
work their will with the treasure, and Mrs.
Brackett and Miss Anstruther would be power
less to interfere.

But there was more to the present situation

than that. I had been seen going into the cavern,
and this would point our enemies indubitably to
the heart of our mission.

Captain Golden and Vandeleur would come to

that sea-cubicle by boat. Should I remain there,
unarmed as I was, and allow them to kill me out
of hand?

There was too much for me to live for.

I

thought of Zelda Anstruther, and then again of
the teak-wood boxes.

If I lived I might yet be able to protect Mrs.
Brackett’s and Miss Anstruther’s interests, no

less than my own. But in order to live I must not
be caught in that cavern like a rat in a trap.
Some thought of secreting the cases occurred

to me; but they were too large, too heavy, and
the cavern offered no opportunities for secret
stowing. I might have rolled them into the
water, but, not knowing what their contents were,
feared to take the risk.

No, I would leave the cases where they were
2OO

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
and struggle to get away from the cavern. And
just here the enormity of the task unfolded itself.
I should have to battle with the current; if I

breasted it successfully, there was the pounding
of the waves against the outer wall to be en
dured; resisting that, I had still the shelf to gain;
and, finally, there were fifty feet of sheer cliff
between the shelf and safety.
As for the current, I was a strong swimmer,
and my strength might even withstand the buf
feting against the outside rocks. So far as re
gaining the shelf was concerned, I observed that
the tide was rising and that it was creeping
higher and higher up on the dark sands; this
would bring the surface of the sea nearer the
shelf, perhaps near enough for me to gain it

without the rope. Once on the shelf, I should
have a revolver to my hand, and if Golden and

Vandeleur came in a boat I would be able to give
a good account of myself.
Having hit upon a plan of action, I set myself

immediately to carrying it out. Traversing the
beach until I had got as close as possible to the
cavern's mouth, I took to the water, and began
swimming.
2OI

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
The current was not so strong, from which I
imagined that the tide was nearing the flood;
yet it was strong enough to make my work diffi
cult in the extreme. However, I forged slowly
ahead, gaining on the current inch by inch.
When I was well within the narrow walls of

the entrance, the heave of a wave threw me

sharply against the rocks. Grasping the rough
projections of the wall, I supported myself for a
brief rest.

The wall gave me an idea, and when I resumed
my progress toward the light it was by reaching
from one projection to another and drawing my

self forward. This called for the expenditure of
a good deal of strength, yet not so much as
though I were swimming in the middle of the
channel.

It was probably half an hour before I reached
the mouth of the cavern, and found myself clutch
ing a slippery point of rock in the outer wall.
Above me was the shelf, but it was not within
reach!

Again and again I lifted myself and tried to
catch at the flat edge. The incoming waves hove
me with sickening force against the jagging
2O2

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
granite, and always I missed the top of the shelf
by two or three inches, and fell back.
With muscular power going fast, and spirits
flagging, I began debating the advisability of re
turning to the cavern to rest until the tide should
be at the flood, when it might be I could make a
second attempt with better success. In that dis
couraging moment a nameless horror came zig

zagging from seaward, gliding toward me by a
series of tacks.

What I saw, with terror-distended eyes, was a
tall, triangular fin, the dorsal fin of a shark.

For a brief instant my whole body went lax, then
I gave a frenzied yell, and sought to dig my way
up the slippery rocks.
My hands were torn with the desperate effort,
and the slapping waves rolled back from the cliff
tinged with the blood of my wounds. The mon
ster, scenting the blood, ripped toward me
through the water, the fin parting it like a black
streak.

I fell away from my insecure handhold. Use
less, useless, was my agonized thought; a min
ute, half a minute, and I should be plucked from
the cliff's face.
2O3

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
I knew how pearl-divers fight the shark, drop
ping below him as he rushes, and disemboweling
him with the thrust of a keen blade.

But a brown

or a black man is safe from a shark, a white

man never. Still, if I had had the machete lying
on the shelf above me, Heaven knows that no ex

pedient would have been too desperate for me
to attempt.

Without the machete I was as good as lost. I
closed my eyes. I did not think of the treacherous
skipper, or Vandeleur, or the treasure; in that
supreme moment I thought only of Zelda An
Struther.

“Robert! The rope! Quick!”
Was I dreaming? Had thoughts of the girl
brought the fancy of her voice in my ears?
Something struck on the rocks beside me.
Opening my eyes, I found the object to be the end
of a rope.
I did not look up—I had no time. Gripping
the stout hempen strands, I lifted myself frantic
ally toward the shelf. For one horrid instant,
the awful fascination of death in its most grue
some form held me supine at the end of the rope,
half-in and half-out of the water.
2O4

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“Hurry!” shrieked the voice above.
I threw off the lethargy that had enchained
my limbs. With one quick heave I laid myself
across the shelf.

A clash came from behind me. Turning my
head, I noticed two bows of serrated teeth inter

locked, caught a glimpse of an ugly gray head,
and saw two staring, baffled eyes dropping back
under the water. A groan was wrenched from
my lips, and I straightened out on the narrow
shelf.

205

CHAPTER XX.

Treachery.
I may have lain five minutes on that shelf, with
the spray beating over me, or it may have been
half an hour. Spent and horror-shaken as I was,
time passed unheeded.
Finally, I became aware that Miss Anstruther
was calling down to me, her voice quivering with
fear and dread.

“Robert, Robert! Why don’t you speak?
Why don’t you answer me? Are you hurt?”
I rose to my knees and looked up.
“I’m all right, Zelda,” I called back to her.
“You saved my life. But for that rope I should
have been a dead man by this time.”
“Oh, I did not want you to come here alone!

I told you that I did not. Somehow I had a feel
ing that all would not go well with you. How
will you get up here?”
“Climb the rope.”
“Can you? Do you feel strong enough?”
2O6

A Q_u a r t e r to F our
It was pleasant to have her so concerned about
my welfare.
In her voice, in her manner, I read plainly that
she cared for me. My strength returned with a
bound, and I was ready to laugh at the dangers
that lay behind, no less than at those to come.
“I’m strong enough to dare anything, Zelda,”
I shouted cheerfully. “Just see that the upper
end of the rope is secure, and I'll be at your side
in a jiffy.”
I saw her fall to at the upper end of the rope,
taking one half-hitch after another, and belaying
over all. While she was engaged in this I was
drawing on my stockings, and slipping revolver
and machete into my belt.
“I think—I am sure it will hold now,” she

called down. “Be sure and hang tight—the shark
is swimming around off the ledge.”
The triangular fin, as I saw, was weaving back
ward and forward, just awash.
“That shark has had his last chance at me,” I

laughed, gripping the rope.

“Here I come,

Zelda.”

Up I went, hand over fist. “Don’t come too

A Q_u arter to Four
close to the edge,” I panted, as the girl bent down
to catch my arms and help me over the brink.
When I had gained the flat surface of the cliff's
top, and while I was half-reclining against the
boulder to catch my breath, Zelda fell at my side,
buried her face in her hands, and began sobbing.

“There, there, little girl,” said I soothingly,
my bare arm going about her waist, “it’s all over
now.”
y

“It's all over now,” she answered brokenly,
“but—but think of what might have happened.”
“A miss is as good as a mile,” I jested gaily.
“Just keep your face in your hands, please, till
I get into my shirt and coat, and then we will go
back to the hut. I have something to tell you,

and I know you have a good deal to tell me. The
walk up the valley will be just the thing for a

little exchange of information.”
I was not long getting into my clothes and
shoes. My hat, fortunately, had not dropped into
the sea, but lay on the cliff's edge.
“Now,” said I, as I coiled in the rope she had

used, “please tell me where you got this line?”.
“It was hanging in the hut, Mr. Lorry—”
2O8

A Q_u a r ter to Four
“That won’t do,” I objected, with a smile and a
shake of the head.

She gave me a puzzled glance.
“What won’t do?” she queried. “The rope was
99

really——
“Oh, that part of it is well enough; it's the
‘Mr. Lorry part. You just established a prece

dent by calling me ‘Robert.

Please keep it up.”

The color mounted her cheeks.

“I was so excited,” she murmured, averting her
eyes, “that I hardly know what I said or did.”
“I was excited, too, but I distinctly remember
the ‘Robert part of what you said.” I slung the
rope over my shoulder. “Now, as we go back,”
I added, “you may begin the talking.”
“I had a foreboding when you left the hut,”
she began, dropping in at my side as we de
scended the slope toward the valley, “and I
“Was that why you watched from the door
way, Zelda?” I rallied. “So that you might see
35

the last of me?”

She blushed again, prettily.

“As you are the sole protector of two lone
women,” she reasoned demurely, “it was very

natural that your safety should be a prime con
sideration.”
“Oh!” I muttered.

“You had been gone only a few moments,” she
proceeded, “when Captain Golden and Mr. Van
deleur looked in at the door of the hut.

Mrs.

Brackett and I were startled, of course, but we
said nothing. ‘He's not here, the skipper
growled, with a fierce look. “Ask the girl,” said
Vandeleur; she'll know where he is.’
“Captain Golden did ask me, and I told him
the truth, that I did not know where you were.
‘Oh, well, we'll find him! Captain Golden de
clared, and he and Vandeleur went on down the

valley.
“I was alarmed, for I felt sure the skipper in
tended doing you some injury on account of what
happened on the beach this morning.”
“So you followed the skipper and Vandeleur?”
“Yes—keeping out of their sight, so they would
not know I was watching them. I took this with
me.” She smiled, and for the first time I saw
that she had the revolver I had left with her.

“Whether I should have used it, or not, if there
had been need, I don’t know. Possibly, when it

Ad

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
came to the pinch, I should have exercised a
woman’s prerogative, and—fainted.”
“Not you,” I demurred admiringly.
“Well, I followed the skipper and Vandeleur,”
she went on, “and saw them reach the top of the
cliff, look downward, and, apparently, study what
lay below. They talked earnestly together, and
I heard Captain Golden give a fierce laugh as he
lifted the rope and threw it from the boulder.
“Directly afterward, the two left the cliff and
hurried back up the valley. As soon as they were
gone, I went to the ledge and looked over, to see
for myself. Your revolver and machete were
plainly to be seen on the narrow ledge, and my
knowledge of our instructions made me positive
that you had gone into the cavern. I called to

you, but, of course, you could not hear me. Then
I reflected that you would need a rope when you
came out, so I ran back to the hut to get one that
I had seen hanging there.
“I—I got back just in time,” she finished, after
a brief silence, “and you know the rest. Now,
what did you find in the cavern?”
“Ten teak-wood boxes,” I replied, “and each of
them will weigh a hundred and fifty pounds.”

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
She clapped her hands, and her hazel eyes
glowed with excitement and delight.

“Then they are really there! What is in them,
Mr. Lorry?”
“I shall not answer that question until you re
vise its terms,” I averred, with mock displeasure.
“Now, don’t be provoking, Robert!”
“That will do,” I smiled. “I don’t know what
is in the boxes, Zelda.” Her face fell in disap
pointment. “You see,” I explained, “I had to
swim into the cavern, so I couldn't burden myself
with anything that would help pry up the covers.
I did use a stone, but the boxes are bound with

strap-iron, and strongly nailed.”
“It must be treasure!”

“Undoubtedly.”
She sighed softly. “I am so glad!” she whis
pered.
“Does the treasure mean so much to you?” I
asked.

“More than you can know. I have a younger
brother to support, and it has been a hard strug

gle for me to take care of him since—since Ar
chie ceased to share the burden.”
2I2

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
I echoed her sigh, for I knew that the treasure.

was receding farther and farther from us.
“Mrs. Brackett, too,” went on Zelda, “is in

sore need of money. She has nothing, and there
is a mortgage on the home her husband left her.
The treasure,” and here she waved her hand to

ward the stark headboards which we were pass
1ng, “is a heritage from those who lie there.
Who knows but that they may have gone down to
death in seeking to save the treasure for us?”
“Zelda,” said I soberly, “you have asked me
to keep nothing from you. Shall I do that now,
even though it may dash your hopes?”
She halted with a start, and gazed steadily into
my face.
“Yes,” she answered slowly. “I have earned

the right to know all, have I not?”
“You have, and I am sure you will appreciate
the situation and make the best of it, as soon as

I call your attention to one fact: After casting
the rope from the boulder, Captain Golden and
Vandeleur hurried off toward the schooner?”
“Yes.”

“Can you not imagine why they did that?
They had studied the face of the cliff, they had

sure that I was inside the cavern, and

“And they wanted to get boats, come back, and

deal with you below there as they saw fit!” The
girl shivered.

“Who would believe there could

be such scoundrels?”

“That was partly their object,” I admitted, “to
find me in the cavern, unarmed, and at their

mercy. They had another object, too, for they
certainly inferred that the cavern contained some
thing that had brought us to the island. If they
explore the place, as they undoubtedly will, they
cannot help finding the boxes. When they do
find them, it will mean that they will consider
nothing but their own gain. In other words, I
firmly believe that the treasure is lost to us.”

“They would not dare!” she breathed, with
flaming eyes.
“Men like Captain Golden will dare anything.
He is making a dupe and a tool of Vandeleur,
and I am certain that Vandeleur will never get
his share of the treasure, either.

He will know

too much for Captain Golden’s welfare, and to
push him overboard in the night will be easy.
The

official log would show that he was lost

“But if we are on board

“We will not be on board, Zelda.

Unless

something like a miracle happens, you and I and

Mrs. Brackett will never step foot on the Lady
May again.”
“Then a miracle will happen, Robert. Heaven
never yet prospered such rascals as Captain Gold
en and Vandeleur. Somehow, some way, we shall
all of us receive our due.”

-

“I hope so. I, at least, shall not yield with
out a fight.”
“What will you do?”
“I will leave you to explain matters and go
down to the cove in order to find out, if possible,
what is going on aboard the schooner.”
“Please don’t,” she begged. “Robert! Every
thing depends on you now, even more than ever.
If you go down to the cove, and Captain Golden
should deal treacherously with you, as he has al
ready done, and will continue to do, think what
would become of Mrs. Brackett and me!”

We were near the hut, by that time. Our feet

passed the bend in the valley and struck into
the path that led from the spring.
“I am thinking of you always, Zelda,” I whis
pered. “If I had not met you in that San Fran
cisco hotel, I firmly believe that I should not have
followed up this hazy and extravagant venture.
In going to the cove, I am thinking of your inter
ests even more than I am of my own.”
A warm light broke over her beautiful face,
her eyes dimmed with gathering tears, and her
sensitive lips trembled ever so slightly.
“Then, Robert,” she said softly, “since you
know how much your welfare means to me, I feel
that I can trust you to go.”
My hands were red with the wounds inflicted
on them by the rocks, my hair was dripping and
tangled about my eyes, and, taken altogether, I
was not very presentable, even for an adventurer.
But I flung my arms about her, drew her close,
and pressed my lips to hers.
She fluttered away from me, and off to the
cabin door; and, as I lost myself around the next
turn of the valley, she was there, watching and
waving her hand, her face flushed and her eyes
like stars.

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
There were other treasures apart from those
to be found in teak-wood boxes, treasures beside
which the purest gold and the rarest pearls are

CHAPTER XXI.
Marooned.

The schooner lay snugly at anchor in the cove.
No sign of life appeared about her decks, and I
hailed lustily.
Mr. Stubbs rose lazily from behind the bul
warks. Evening was drawing on, and, while he
was plain to me, I was somewhat in the shadow,
and he appeared in doubt as to my identity.
“Alloy, the shore!” he called, leaning over the
rail. “What do you want?”
“This is Lorry, Mr. Stubbs,” I shouted. “I
wish you'd send off a boat and take us aboard.”
“There ain't any boats, Mr. Lorry.”
“No boats? What’s become of them all?”

I knew that the schooner had three boats,
one at the stern davits and two on the deck
house.

“Cap'n Golden an' Vandeleur have gone off
ter circumnavigate the island.”
“Why did they take the three boats?”
“Blest if I know.”
218

-

A Q_u art e r to Four
They had taken the three boats and gone after

cargo. There could be no other explanation.
“Who’s aboard?” was my next question.
“An anchor-watch, consistin' o 'me, an’ the
‘doctor, an’ Petie.”
“When did the boats leave?”

“Nigh onto three hours ago, I guess. I’ve been
snoozin' full an’ by most ever since, an haven't
kept much track o’ the time.”
“I believe I'll come aboard and have a chat with

you, Mr. Stubbs,” I volunteered.
“How'll ye come?”
“Swim.”

“Don’t ye do it, Mr. Lorry. I got orders from

the cap'n, an I’d have ter kerry 'em out. You
know how it is.

A mate's got ter do like he's

told.”

“What are your orders, Mr. Stubbs?”

“To keep the schooner a cable's length away
from ye. I like ye fust chop myself, Mr. Lorry,
but there's been rum doin’s on this hooker ever

since ye swatted the skipper over the head. It
'u'd suit me uncommon ter pull out to ye, if I
had a boat, or ter let ye come aboard, purvidin’
orders wa’n’t ag’inst it.”
219

A Q_u a r ter to Four
“I believe you, Mr. Stubbs,” I called gratefully.
“What is the skipper intending to do?”
“You’ve got me over my head, now.”
“Well, he's no better than a pirate, and I'll
have the law on him one of these days.”
“That's between you an him, an I don’t want
ter take sides. I guess you understand how I'm
fixed.”
I did understand.

At that moment the heads

of Eph and Petie appeared over the rail forward.
Whatever the mate said and did would be re

peated to Captain Golden, so he had to bridle his
tongue and act judiciously.
If he could have posed openly as my friend,
without incurring the captain’s displeasure, I felt
that Stubbs would have done so. Even now I was

positive that he was secretly friendly toward me.
While I stood there, considering what should
be my next move, a dip of oars and a hoarse
mumble of voices echoed from the cove-inlet.

Presently, three boats pushed out of the deepen
ing shadows in the passage.
“Ahoy, the schooner!” roared the voice of Cap
tain Golden.

Eph and Petie turned away from the rail to
22O

A Q_u a r ter to Four
face in the direction of the approaching boats.
As Stubbs answered the hail, he motioned with
his hand for me to retire.

-

“We got some salvage from the wreck o’ the
Gagelle,” went on the skipper, “an we'll hoist it

aboard by the davit-tackle.

Stand by, Mr.

Stubbs, to lend a hand.”

There was exultation in Captain Golden's
tones. His manner of referring to the plunder
as “salvage” was decidedly humorous.
“Ten boxes,” piped Vandeleur jubilantly, from

another of

the boats.

“Those boxes are stolen,” I shouted; “they be
long to three of us, who are still ashore, and to
Vandeleur.”

I heard Captain Golden's startled oath as it
came ripping across the water. He was rounding
to under the stern of the schooner. Then I heard

his call of “Way enough,” and saw him rise in
the stern-sheets, and face the beach.

“You’re there, are you?” he flung at me, with
a torrent of profanity. “I thought you had hove

to alongside the bottom. Your tricky work with
Vandeleur didn’t pan out, did it? That's be
22 I

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
cause he had a decent skipper along, that stood
for fair play.”
“Avast with that!” I shouted angrily. “Cap
tain Golden, you're a piratical scoundrel!
You're making off with property that doesn’t be
long to you, and I'll live to have you up for rob
bery on the high seas
A rifle cracked sharply. Golden had stooped,
picked the weapon up, and fired from his hip be
fore I could get an inkling of what he was about.
Screened by the growing dusk, I was not an
easy target, and the skipper's haste to get in the
35

shot had marred his aim. The bullet sang harm
lessly through the air.
Lifting the butt of the gun to his shoulder, he
sighted carefully for another shot. Just as he
pulled trigger, I saw the stern of the boat veer

swiftly to starboard.

The second bullet also

went wild.

Golden faced the bow with savage fury.

“That was you, you damned Swede!” he yelled.
He leaned forward, and I heard the impact of a
blow. “I’ve a notion to make shark's-bait o' ye,
but look to yerself when I git ye aboard.”
I believed that I understood what had hap
222

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
pened. One of the Swedes had pulled his oar
at the right moment, thus disconcerting the skip
per’s aim. I was grateful to the sailor, but it
was a rash thing for him to do.
I should have fired with my revolver, imme
diately after the skipper's first shot, but for the
fear of injuring some one else in the boat. As I
was powerless to prevent the skipper and Vande
leur from carrying out their designs, and know
ing that further threats were worse than useless,
I turned and hurried toward the cleft.

At the top of the beach I met Zelda. She had
been hurrying, and was quite breathless.
“What was that firing, Robert?” she de
manded.

“Captain Golden tried a couple of shots at me,
Zelda.”
“What will that scoundrel do next!

I heard

the firing, and my first thought was that you
had forgotten your promise.”
“Any promise I make you I consider sacred.”
“Please don’t put it like that. Did you learn
anything about Captain Golden’s intentions?”
“All that is necessary. He intends to kill me
223

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
if he can, and thought he had already accom
plished it at the cavern.”
“He is equal to anything,” breathed Zelda.
“When I reached the schooner,” I proceeded,
“the skipper, Vandeleur, and most of the crew
had gone, and taken all the boats. Stubbs was in
charge, and he said the skipper had left orders
not to let me come aboard.”

“I suppose so!” exclaimed Zelda angrily. “Cap
tain Golden will not let you step foot on the ship
again. I’m glad of it, Robert. After what has
happened, I shouldn’t feel easy a minute if we

were there.”
“Nevertheless, Zelda, we shall have to go
aboard the schooner, and take our chances.

pointed

toward the shadowy boats near the

schooner’s stern.

“They are hoisting aboard the teak-wood
cases,” I answered.

She received the announcement calmly.
“Well, let them; let them have their teak-wood

cases and sail away with them. After all, it is a
small price to pay for your safety. I am satis
fied, Robert.” She turned to me and stretched
out her hand. “Let us go back to the hut,” she
added smilingly. “We have a surprise for you
there.”

“I am not satisfied, little girl,” I returned ear
nestly, taking her hand, “and before we return
to the hut I want to tell you of a plan. It isn’t
best to excite Mrs. Brackett by talking the mat
ter over before her.”

-

“What is the plan?” Zelda asked suspiciously.
“Unless something is done, we shall be left on
the island,” I continued. “I am used to hard
ships, but that would not do for you and Mrs.
Brackett.”

“No?” she flashed.

“Well, then, sir, what do

you want to do with Mrs. Brackett and me?”
“We must all leave Fortune Island on the
225

A Q_u arter to Four
schooner,” I insisted.

“That is best for

ladies, and for me, too.

you'

When we are on the

schooner we are in the same ship with the treas
ure, and there is always the chance that some
thing will turn matters our way.”
“Well?” she asked impatiently.

“If I can get aboard the schooner to-night, and
have a quiet talk with the mate, I am sure we can
reach some sort of an understanding.”
“What good will an understanding with the
mate do you, Robert? Mr Stubbs will obey Cap

tain Golden.

Besides, how would you get

aboard?”

“Swim.”

f
“I shouldn’t think, after what you went
through to-day, you'd ever want to get into salt
water again.”

“There probably isn’t a single shark in the
whole lagoon.”
“You don’t want to go aboard the schooner
merely to"talk with Mr. Stubbs,” asserted Zelda,
after a short period of reflection. “What is your
real reason, Robert?”

“Well,” I admitted charily, “if I could make a

A Q_u a r t e r to

prisoner of the skipper, and bring him ashore, we
would have everything in our own hands.”
She turned squarely about and stared at me.

“You are mad to think of it! The very idea
of your swimming out to the schooner, climbing
aboard, then making a prisoner of Captain Gold
en, and bringing him ashore—with every one on
board against you! You shall not attempt any
such foolhardy plan as that,” she added deci
sively.
“But we must do something,” I protested.
“Will you take my advice, Robert?” she asked.
“You are a girl of good judgment, Zelda, and
I should be glad of your counsel.”

“Then, do nothing to-night.

Give Captain

Golden until to-morrow morning to think this
matter over. He is doing wrong—he is doing
something that will make him amenable to the
law. He knows all this, and sober second
thought will lead him to see his error. In the
morning we will all three go down to the beach
and have a talk with him.”

“But where will you and Mrs. Brackett stay

to-night?” I asked, in dismay.
She laughed.
227

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“Why, in the hut, you goose!” she answered.

“It is quite comfortable.

I shall be far more

contented there than I would be aboard the
schooner.”

“And there is the matter of food,” I went on,

remembering what a terrific inroad I had made
on the contents of the hamper at noon. “You
and Mrs. Brackett must not go hungry.”
“We do not intend to go hungry, Robert, nor
to let you go hungry, either. Didn’t I tell you we
had a surprise at the hut? Will you promise to
put aside that crazy plan of yours, and let further
action lie over until to-morrow morning?”
“Of course,” I answered, but against my better

judgment, “if you want it that way.”
“I do want it that way,” she returned, with
finality, “and so we will consider the matter set
tled. Now, for the surprise.”
The “surprise” consisted of a hot supper.
Zelda and Mrs. Brackett had found matches,

broken up pieces of the wreckage for fire-wood,
and had built a fire in the stove.

Somewhere about the hut they had found cof

fee, sugar, and condensed milk. A tin of canned
meat and another of tomatoes had been opened,
228

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
and there was enough bread left in the hamper.
to supply the evening meal.
Considering our sad discoveries of the day we
were far from being a jolly party, but after so
many weeks on shipboard I am sure we all en
joyed the land. Mrs. Brackett was pensive, but
I could see that she was slowly recovering from
the bitter blow of the morning.

My candles were all in the cavern, so we had
nothing with which to make a light. Evening
was well advanced before we finished our sup
per, and it was something of a feat to find your
own dishes and keep from helping yourself out
of your neighbor’s.
Mrs. Brackett and Zelda made themselves as

comfortable as they could in the hut, and I took
some blankets and went out of doors to pass the
night. Truth to tell, I feared a visit from Cap
tain Golden and his men, for I chose to think

that instead of passing a night in repentance he
would be concocting fresh deviltry.
So I took both revolvers, and laid myself down
at a point where I should be aroused by intruders
before they had a chance to reach the hut. Noth
ing untoward happened to us, however, and I
229

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
slept soundly, and awoke in excellent spirits, and
mightily refreshed.
We breakfasted off the remains of our supper,
and then the three of us set off toward the cove

for our intended colloquy with the supposedly
repentant Captain Golden. As we advanced
along the valley toward the top of the beach we
failed to descry the tall masts of the Lady May;
and when we reached the beach our staring eyes
swept the lagoon, only to return and rest upon
each other in blank dismay.
The schooner had fled from the island some

time during the night.
“Marooned!” I gasped.
“Dear, dear!” murmured Mrs. Brackett, toss

ing her hands. “What's that?”
I explained, and the poor lady fell to sobbing
and bewailing. As usual, Zelda made it her duty
to soothe and console her; and I imagined that
Zelda was not so grievously cast down by our
misfortune as she might have been.

230

CHAPTER XXII.

“Only the Mate.”
Zelda and I had been keeping as many of the
serious details of our situation from Mrs. Brack

ett as we could. The good woman was naturally
pessimistic, and we aimed to show her the bright
side of the picture.
Now, in order to reconcile her with her lot,

we told of Captain Golden's treachery in the mat
ter of the teak-wood cases, and how it had led to

the further treachery of our marooning. Zelda
showed her how much safer and better off we

were on the island than we could possibly have
been on the schooner, and so well did she talk

that Mrs. Brackett came almost to regard that
barren isle as a haven of refuge, and our ma
rooning a providence.
I held the private opinion that Zelda had felt,
all along, that something of this sort would hap
pen—indeed, that she desired it to happen—and
that she was throwing her full heart into the per
suasion of Mrs. Brackett.
231
--~~~~

A Q_u a r ter to Four
Our elderly companion seemed to have but one

regret: The mortgage on her Emmetsburg home
might be foreclosed before a ship took us off and
carried her away to 'Frisco in time to pay the in
terest!

While the two ladies were talking, I climbed

the arroyo-bank, and gazed to seaward in all di
rections. There was no sign of the Lady May,
so they must have hove up the anchor and got

clear of the island very soon after our teak-wood
cases had been put aboard.
Well, it was consoling to know that I had
saved the better part of my patrimony, even
though the treasure had been lost. I should have
about four thousand dollars with which to make

a beginning when we regained our own coun
try.

From the blank sea, I brought my gaze to the
valley, and looked at the lithe, graceful form of
Zelda as she moved about Mrs. Brackett like a

ministering angel. After all, what did I care for
the treasure?

It was the treasure that had brought Zelda and
me together. Now that it had accomplished its
232

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
purpose, it might take wings and welcome. I felt
in my heart that a richer prize was to be mine.
“We might talk our situation over,” I observed,
descending the hill, and rejoining my compan
ions. “Our chance of being taken off this island
at an early day is not flattering.”
“What of that, Robert?” demanded Zelda. “It

is a novel experience, and I am sure we will en
joy it. Besides, we are sure to be taken off some
time, you know.”

“There's the homely question of food,” I sug
gested; “simple enough, yet all important.”

“Find some coconuts!” brightened Mrs. Brack
ett.

“There isn't a coconut-tree on the island, Mrs.
Brackett,” I answered gravely.
“Just as well,” sighed Mrs. Brackett, folding
her hands with quiet determination to endure any
thing. “I don’t think I should be overly fond
of coconuts for a steady diet. I imagine they
wouldn’t be healthful. But I thought ships went
every which way across the ocean, Mr. Lorry?”
“They have certain tracks they follow, between
different points,” I explained. “A little farther

But this is an obscure cor
The fact that Fortune Island

is not on the charts is proof that it is seldom vis

“But we'll surely be rescued after a while,
won’t we?” Mrs. Brackett inquired.
“Oh, of course,” I replied indefinitely. “I will
plant a flagstaff at each end of the island, so that
whenever a ship passes those aboard will know
there are people here who are anxious to be taken
Off.”

“I am pretty sure,” said Mrs. Brackett, “that
Mr. Cartwright will take care of my interest for
me, when it comes due.

He'll know where I am,

an he's been a real good friend to me since

Ezry's death. I’d saved enough out of that two
hundred dollars Mr. Cartwright gave me to pay
the interest.”

“I wouldn’t worry about that, Mrs. Brackett,”
I advised.

“I left a curstanthem in the parlor-window,
at home,” she sighed regretfully; “I don’t know

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
how I ever come to forget it, when I took all my
other plants over to Mrs. Henry Tinker's. I
know as much as anythin’ in the world that I'll
be away so long that curstanthem'll just dry up
like a bone.”

“I wouldn't fret about anything, Mrs. Brack
ett,” I went on, “but try
y?

“Goodness!” she burst out. “I’d clean forgot

about my carpetbag. That ornery Captain Gold
en has sailed away with that, too. It never rains
but it pours, does it, deary?” And she looked
pathetically into Zelda's face.
I gave over trying to be of any comfort to Mrs.
Brackett, and went down toward the beach.
There I made a “find.”

A number of objects lay in a promiscuous heap
—a suit-case of Zelda's, the recently lamented
carpetbag of Mrs. Brackett's, and my own bat
tered satchel.

Over, under, and around these

were half a dozen sides of bacon, two hams, a
cheese, a couple of bags of bread, tins of coffee,
tea, and condensed milk, and three pairs of neatly
rolled blankets.

Surmounting the pile was a large piece of
brown paper, weighted with a stone. I took the
235

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
paper from the pile, and read the following, writ
ten in a cramped and almost illegible hand:
“Mr. Lorry, i didun Hav no Han in It an swoar i wold

not leeve i'lan without This truck was putt ashoar for
you dam sory but i am only the Mate

“respeckfuly, Stubbs.”

That was Stubbs for you! Waving the paper
above my head, I called to the ladies, and they
at once hurried down to the beach.

“We have one friend aboard the Lady May,
at all events,” said I. “See what Mr. Stubbs put
ashore for us.”

“I always thought Mr. Stubbs was too good a
man to sail with Captain Golden!” declared Zel
da, her eyes glowing at sight of her suit-case.
Mrs. Brackett pounced upon the carpetbag,
and we went through the heterogeneous heap,
parcel by parcel.
“It begins to look as though the food ques
tion was irrevocably settled,” said Zelda.

“Mr. Stubbs has done a great deal for us,” I
went on, “but he will do even more. Unless I
misread him, he will have some ship headed for

Fortune Island to take us off before very long.
Here is a note he left with the goods.”
236

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
Zelda took the note and studied it for a few
mOmentS.

“There was a heart of gold back of that,” she
commented.

We returned to the hut, carrying as much of
the plunder as we could. After that I made half
a dozen trips, and soon had it all at headquarters.
“Inasmuch as my money paid for this,” I re
marked laughingly, as I put down the last load,
“I think we are fairly entitled to it.”

The glint came into Zelda's hazel eyes as it
always did when she was deeply stirred.
“You are minus a good deal of money, Rob
ert,” said she, “through Captain Golden's dis

honesty and treacherous conduct. The only pos
sible way you could have been repaid was out of
the contents of those stolen boxes. Really, you
know,” and the eye-flash was followed by a wan
little smile, “I still have the feeling that those

boxes will yet come to us.”
I shook my head. “The boxes, perhaps,” I
qualified, “but not what is in them. Captain
Golden is too old a hand to let any treasure slip
through his fingers.”
At luncheon, that day, Mrs. Brackett was
237

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
greatly depressed. Now and again some stirring
event would lure her mind from those mounds

and melancholy headboards, only to let it swing
back once more and plunge her into deeper sad
ness.

And, in a measure, it was so with Zelda.

But Zelda was younger and of firmer fiber.
Realizing the necessity of bearing up under our
misfortunes, so that she might be of help to me
and a source of consolation to Mrs. Brackett, she

thrust her own grief resolutely aside.
Our enforced stay on the island, be it long or
short, would pass most quickly and comfortably
if we could contrive to keep ourselves busy. I
had already planned a few tasks, but my chief
concern was to lay out enough work so that none
of us should be forced into idleness. Grief, I un

derstood very well, takes firmest hold of those
minds which have nothing to do but dwell on
their sorrows.

The first piece of work I had set for myself
I felt sure would not be regarded with favor by
Zelda; so it was with some misgivings that I
pushed back from the table and prepared to
broach the subject to my companions.
238

CHAPTER XXIII.
Back to the Sea-cave.

“Zelda,” said I, “there is one point in recent
affairs which we must not overlook.”

She turned her wide, hazel eyes upon me with
a questioning lift of the brows.
“What point is that, Robert?” she asked.
“Perhaps,” I went on, “all the teak-wood boxes
were not removed from the cave.

Golden and

Vandeleur must have had to work hurriedly, and

it might be that they missed some of them.”
I was angling for an excuse to pay the cavern
another visit, and, in my own mind, I had small
doubt that Golden and Vandeleur had made a

clean sweep of all the boxes. Indeed, I had heard
Vandeleur call out something to the effect that

they had ten boxes with them in the boats, short
ly after my colloquy with Stubbs from the beach.
However, I thought it well to make sure, and
was bending my energies toward securing Zel
da’s consent to my plan.
“No, Robert,” and Zelda shook her head de
239

A Q_u arter to Four
cidedly, “we both know what sort of man Cap
tain Golden is, and we know he would not leave

that cave until he had secured every box.”
“At any rate,” said I, “I believe I will go down
there again and see for myself.”
A shudder ran through the girl, and a look of
horror crossed her face.

“You wouldn't think of such a thing!” she
cried.

“There is no danger,” I returned reassur
ingly, “now that our enemies have left the
island.”

“But the sharks! They are more to be feared
than human enemies, Robert.”
“There's not one chance in a hundred, Zelda,
that there will be any sharks around the cave
during the short time I shall be there.”
“But if one should come,” said she, her voice

tense and her face full of foreboding, “and—and
if anything should happen to you, what would be
come of us?

You must take no unnecessary

risks.”

“I would not do that,” I answered gravely,
“and if I thought I was taking any long chance
I would not mention the matter.
24O

But I did not

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
give the cavern a very thorough examination,
when I was there, as the finding of the boxes took
up most of my attention. Now I am going back

again and go over the place more carefully.”
Mrs. Brackett lifted her grief-stricken face.

“You might find something there that Tom
had left, Mr. Lorry,” said she. “If Tom, and
Zelda's brother, and your cousin, and this Cap'n

Trent had anything to do with putting those
boxes in the cave, like as not they may have left
something else there, too—something it might
be well for us to find.”

Mrs. Brackett was proving an unexpected ally.
I could see that Zelda was wavering, and that
Mrs. Brackett had mentioned something which
had not before occurred to her. Nevertheless, she

had an objection.
“Depend on it,” said she, “that whatever was
left in the cave was found and carried away by
Captain Golden and Vandeleur.”
“I left some matches and candles there,” I went

on, “and I don’t believe that Golden and his land

ing-party could find them. We could use them
very handily now,” I replied, with a smile.
Then I got up and took down the coil of rope
24I

A Q_u a r ter to F O ur
which had served me so well on the occasion of

my first visit to the cave.

“You and Mrs. Brackett might come with me,
Zelda,” I added, “and watch for sharks from the
top of the cliff while I am below.”
“Of course we shall go with you!” declared
Zelda, and we left the hut forthwith.

When we passed the headboards, in making
our way along the valley, Mrs. Brackett's grief
opened afresh. Zelda slipped an arm around her
and spoke such words of comfort as her own
grieving mind could suggest. As soon as we

reached the turn of the valley and had begun
climbing the bank, I was pleased to see that the
prospect of our adventure was claiming more and
more of Mrs.

Brackett's attention.

As we

crossed the flat crest of the hill and drew close to

the brink of the cliff, Mrs. Brackett paused fear
fully.

“Mercy!” she gasped. “Is the cave down
there? How’ll you ever get to it, Mr. Lorry?
And how were those boxes ever taken down

there, in the first place?”

Clinging to Zelda, she edged cautiously toward
242

A Q_u arter to Four
the brink and stood looking down at the lashing
WaVeS.

“I’ll get down easily enough,” I answered,
throwing off my coat and dropping down to take
off my shoes. “When the boxes went into the
cave, Mrs. Brackett, they were taken in by means
of a boat.

If we had a boat at hand now we could

all visit the cave, and do it safely and easily.
The way I am going is safe enough—only a lit
tle more difficult, that's all. Are you looking for
sharks' fins, Zelda?” I finished laughingly.
She was standing close to the edge of the cliff,
and her eyes were wandering sharply over the
smooth water to seaward.

“Yes,” she answered, shifting her gaze to me,
“and I sha’n’t be easy a minute until you are with
us again, Robert!”
The look in her eyes disturbed me. It was
pleasant to know that my welfare meant so much
to her, but it seemed brutal to play with her fears

by going on. I felt that it was due to all of us,
however, that a second and final examination
should be made of the cave. We must know, be

yond all peradventure, that all the boxes had been
removed by Golden and Vandeleur.
243

A Q_u a r t e r to F O ur
I was not long in knotting a noose in the end
of the rope and in throwing it over the boulder,

with my folded coat as a cushion; then I dropped
the free end of the rope to the shelf. At that
point I discovered that this rope was shorter than
the one I had used before, but a mental calcu
lation convinced me that it would reach far

enough inside the cave to answer my purpose.
Both revolvers I left with Zelda.

“I am certain you'll not see any sharks, Zelda,”
said I, “but, if you do, shoot at them. That will
give me warning. Your voice wouldn't reach me

in the cave, but I could hear a revolver-shot.”
“You won’t be long?” Zelda asked, with an im

ploring note in her voice, as I seated myself on
the brink preparatory to descending.
“Not a moment longer than necessary,” I re
plied. “Meanwhile, please don’t worry.”
With that, I gripped the rope and started down.

When I reached the shelf, I looked up and saw
two white faces peering down at me.

“That was easy enough,” I cried, waving my
hand, “and the rest will be just as easy.”
Removing my shirt and stockings, I left them
244

A Q_u a r ter to Four
on the shelf; then, tying the rope to my belt, I
plunged into the churning surf and raced
through the cavern entrance.
Having gone over the course once, I took my
bearings and proceeded to make a landing with
out any preliminary investigation. As on the
other time, I was halted in a smother of foam

when I took up the slack in the rope, but I at once
began swimming to the right and quickly found
bottom.

Untying the rope from my belt, I weighted it
with a stone, as I had done before; then, after a

moment’s rest, I fell to hunting for the niche
where I had left the candles and matches.

Luck

was with me, and before many minutes had
passed I was moving up and down the subter
ranean strand looking for whatever I might find.

I discovered many footprints in the damp sand,
and came upon the spot where the boats had
nosed into the beach, but as for teak-wood boxes
there was not one to be seen. I was not sur

prised; on the contrary, I should have been sur
prised if I had found that even one had been left.
Having thus settled the matter of the treasure
to my complete satisfaction, I began a thorough
245

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
investigation of the cave. I went at this sys
tematically, zigzagging back and forth between
the wall and the water's edge and covering every

foot of ground. The sum of my discoveries was
a clasp-knife. It was bright and new, which was
proof positive that it had not lain for any length
of time in the damp air of the cave. Quite likely
it had been dropped by one of the landing-party
from the Lady May.
With a sense of keen disappointment because
of my failure to discover anything worth while,
I made my way to the spot where I had seen the
boxes. There, by merest chance, a flash of can
dlelight on the wall revealed something that drew
my instant attention. A flat surface of the wall
had been scratched deeply with some hard,
pointed instrument. My surprise was great when
I found that the indentations took the form of

letters, and that the letters grouped themselves
into words.

Not a little excited, I pushed the candle closer

to the wall.

The printing was in two lines,

roughly done but all perfectly legible:
“Capt. Eugene Trent, brigantine Gazelle”
“Arthur Mayhew, 9th Reg’t U. S. A.”
246

A Q_u a r t e r to

Four

That was all; but, brief and unsatisfactory
though it was, the words came like a message
from the tomb.

Trent and Mayhew! Were they the ones who
had brought the teak-wood boxes to the cavern?
If so, why had they not chiseled in the rock some
thing about Anstruther and Brackett?

Thinking I might discover something by
searching the wall further, I began examining
the stones carefully and working my way foot
by foot around the cavern.
"Perhaps I had been at this work for a quarter
of an hour when I heard a sound that forced me

from the wall with a frantic leap.

The candle

shook in my hand, and I staggered unsteadily,
hoping against hope that my ears had played me
a trick.
But I was not mistaken.

Once more the sound

floated in through the cavern entrance, muffled
but distinct.

It was the report of a revolver!

247

CHAPTER XXIV.

Escape from the Cave.
In my time I have heard it said of some men
that they “did not know what fear was.” Per
sonally, I doubt if such a man ever lived. There
would be no merit in courage if there were no
such thing as fear. But a test for any man would
be to place him as I was placed then, immured
in a cave whose only exit was by an arm of the
sea-blockaded by a man-eating shark!
My life as a soldier of fortune had brought me
face to face with many perils, but never had
danger played such havoc with my nerves as it
did then. And the fact that I had gone into it,
recklessly and open-eyed, in no wise ministered
to my peace of mind. Zelda had counseled me
against taking the risk, and I had laughed at her
fears.

Dropping nervelessly on the wet sand, I peered
with wild eyes toward the entrance of the cave
and upbraided myself for being a headstrong
fool. There had been nothing to gain by the ven
248

A Q_u a r t e r to

ture, and everything to lose in case luck happened

to go against me. Even if I had found a box of
treasure, how would it have helped us in our sorry
situation? Now, when I found myself trapped, I
could conjure up a thousand and one reasons why
I should never have paid that second visit to the
CaVe.

But if I had one thought for myself, I had two
for Zelda and Mrs. Brackett. I pictured them
crouching on the brink of the cliff, staring with
terror-stricken eyes at the triangular fins dart
ing through the water. Unable to aid me, what
must have been their hopelessness and despair!

This thought brought back my courage. I had
the clasp-knife. With that in my belt, and with
the rope to aid me, I would swim and fight my
way back to the shelf.
Before I set out on my return, I watched the
sunlit stretch of water that led into the cave.

Nothing struck athwart the channel to arouse my
fears. If I worked quickly, and made the best
use of the rope, there was a chance that I could
gain the shelf unmolested.
Passing hurriedly around the beach to the place
where I had left the end of the rope, I planted
249

A Q_u arter to Four
what remained of my candle in the sand, wrapped
the rest of the candles and the matches in their

water-proof covering, tied the packet to my belt,
and then plunged resolutely into the water.

The current buffeted me roughly, but the pull
of the rope and the resistance my body offered
to the current served to buoy me up. I had little
swimming to do, and hand-over-handed my way
along the life-line. From time to time I lifted my
head and shoulders above the waves, shook the

water from my eyes and stared about me. The
thing I dreaded I failed to see, and presently I
was back on the shelf, overcome with a sense of
relief almost as much as I was by the fatigue of
my fierce struggle with the current.
“Robert!” a voice called down to me.

Rising to my knees I looked upward. Zelda
and Mrs. Brackett were staring over the cliff's
edge.
“Where’s the shark, Zelda?” I cried.
“It was a mistake, Robert,” she answered. “I
am sorry if we alarmed you, but our nerves were
none too steady. Look!”

She pointed as she spoke. Following her fin
ger with my eyes I saw a bit of wreckage twisting
250

A Q_u arter to Four'
and whirling in the waves. I laughed—I could
afford to laugh now.
“Was that what you saw?” I asked, getting
into my shirt. “And you thought it was a
shark!”

I made a mental reservation, then and there,

that neither of my companions should ever know
what a bad half-hour they had given me in the
cave. After a brief rest, I started up the face of
the fifty-foot cliff, finally getting over the top
with the aid of Zelda and Mrs. Brackett.

“That's the last time,” I panted, as I lay
sprawled out in the sun, “that I shall ever visit
the cave.”

“Did you discover anything, Robert, that made
the risk worth while?” asked Zelda.

“I found this,” I answered, taking the knife
from my belt.
Mrs. Brackett gave the blade a quick look, then
turned away her eyes disappointedly.
“The-the boxes were all gone, Mr. Lorry?”
she asked.

“Golden and Vandeleur made a clean sweep. I
saw where their boats had grounded on the beach,

and where they had tramped back and forth load
251

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
ing the boxes, but this knife was all they had left
behind.”
*

“But you got the candles and matches,” said
Zelda quietly, watching as I untied the packet
from my belt. “All the candles and matches in
the world, Robert, wouldn’t pay for what I-for
what we went through up here on the cliff while
waiting for you to come.”

I was properly rebuked, and hoped in my soul
that never again should I see such a look of re
proach as was then in Zelda’s hazel eyes.
“Well,” said I, “we know exactly where we
stand, now. If I hadn’t investigated the cave we
might always have had the feeling that some of
the treasure had been left there.

Now we know

that all of it was taken from the island in the

Lady May. On the wall
I bit the words off short, wondering how my
companions would take it when I told them that
99

Trent and Mayhew had left signs of their pres
ence in the cave, while Zelda's brother and Mrs.
Brackett's son had not.

“On the wall?” fluttered Mrs. Brackett, her
face lighting with sudden hope. “Did you find
something on the wall of that cave, Mr. Lorry?”
252

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“It was nothing of any importance, Mrs.
Brackett,” said I gently; “just the names of Cap
tain Trent and my cousin, Arthur, scratched on
the stone.

After Trent's name followed the two

words, “brigantine Gazelle, and after Arthur's,
‘9th Regiment, U. S. A.’”
“Why,” Mrs. Brackett murmured, “that was

Tom's regiment.”
“And Archie's,” added Zelda.

“Then,” said I, “my cousin, your brother, Zel
da, and Mrs. Brackett’s son all belonged to the
same regiment—perhaps to the same company.
This shows how the three might have been
thrown together, but it doesn’t help us much,
otherwise. Where does Captain Trent and the
Gazelle come in?”

Mrs. Brackett shook her head in pathetic be
wilderment. Zelda gave a deep sigh.
“Some time,” said Zelda, “all this may be made
clear to us, but it is very dark and mysterious
now. Our relatives were in the brigantine with

Captain Trent, and they had those teak-wood
boxes with them. The brigantine was wrecked,
and four of those on board got safely ashore and
took the boxes to the cave. That is all we really
253

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
know. Let us not plague ourselves with surmises,
but accept the situation as we find it—and go
back to the hut. We can do nothing more, Rob
ert, but wait, and hope for the best.”
I put on my shoes and coat, coiled up the rope
and swung it over my shoulder, then we retraced
our way across the crest of the hill, through the
valley and back to the rude little shanty which
had now become our home.

In the end, I think we were all better for that

afternoon’s experience. It brought home to us,
as nothing else could have done, our mutual need
of each other in our forlorn situation, and taught
us to grieve less over what we had lost and to
do more toward cultivating an optimistic spirit
for the general good.
Mrs. Brackett sighed as we passed the row of
headboards in the valley, but there was resigna
tion in her face, and a calm determination to
make the best of her lot.

254

CHAPTER XXV.

Island Days.

The pall of misfortune rested upon us but
lightly. The shadows cast by that gloomy row
of carved boards beyond the spring did not often
reach the place which we called “home.”

Never in my wildest dreams did I think I could
be so happy and contented as I was during those
days we spent on that barren little island. It

was the most satisfying kind of happiness, too, for
it had its undernote of resignation, which hal
lowed it and gave it the ring of true worth.

The trade-wind, blowing almost constantly
from the northeast, tempered the heat of the

shadeless valley. So far from inducing languor,
the air was like wine, and inspired to effort.
Zelda worked by my side in the several out

door tasks we set for ourselves, helping to plan
as well as to execute.

Mrs. Brackett assumed

charge of the house and the culinary operations.
From the wreckage near the hut Zelda and I

dug out one of the brigantine's upper yards.
255

A Q_u art e r to Four
This I hacked in two at the middle, with the ma
chete, and we carried one half to the eastern end
of the island and the other half to the western

end. We set them up on the highest elevation,

planting them firmly in a nest of stones. Then
we made two streamers out of a white blanket

which we had found in the hut, using needles
and coarse thread, donated by Mrs. Brackett out
of the contents of her carpetbag. These stream
ers we flew from the tops of our flagpoles, ho
ping they would attract the notice of any wander
ing ship that chanced to pass in our vicinity.
While we still had faith that Stubbs would send

a vessel to pick us up, yet we felt that we should
do everything possible to hasten our rescue.
When the poles were set, and the streamers in
place, Zelda and I had other work come to our
hands. Half-buried in the sand opposite the point
where the Gazelle had met her fate, we discov

ered a whale-boat. The boat had been badly stove
in aft, but she was sound forward, as Zelda and

I found when we had dug her out of the beach.
“Repair her, Robert,” said Zelda.
“What for?” I queried, mentally weighing the
task and our means for accomplishing it.
256

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“So you can take me to see the cavern, and so
we can pay a visit to the Gazelle.”
I had long wanted to visit the wreck of the
brigantine myself, just to see if anything could
be found that would throw light upon the situa
tion we had encountered on the island.

Zelda’s

suggestion was a good one, and we started to
carry it out.
We worked on the beach, transporting our slen
der supply of materials from the hut. The re
pairs on the whale-boat were never finished, for
the reason that we were interrupted in our long
task by a rescue, but I look back on that era of
planning and working as one of the most delight
ful periods of my life.
-

We had the machete, and we had a butcher

knife. Of the latter we made a saw, serrating
its straight edge with pieces of flint.
One entire day was consumed in the manufac

ture of the saw, and I remember the joy with
which Zelda saw me haggle it through a piece of
board. I was half an hour getting through six
inches of pine, and she applauded heartily when
I straightened erect with the two pieces of board
in my hands.
257

A Q_u a r ter to

Four

Our prospective operations were all detailed in
advance. We were to get nails from the wreck
age, unlay rope, to get material for calking, and
we were to try to make a cement from powdered
shells as a substitute for pitch.
The first step was to saw the whale-boat in two
just forward of the wrecked stern. This we ac
complished in three days.
An oak stern-post was worked out with the
machete and a knife, made fast to the shortened

keel of the whale-boat, and strengthened with a
stern-post-knee. Then we began cutting out the
lumber to fill in the gap at the square stern.
While I gouged away with the butcher-knife
saw, and pounded with a stone hammer, Zelda
sat on the beach beside me, unlaying rope for
calking.
“Where do you suppose those ten teak-wood
boxes came from, Robert?” she once asked me.

We talked a great deal while we worked, and
our ill-fated expedition was a never-failing topic.

“You’ve got me guessing, as the man says,”
and I gave her a quizzical glance from the clew

of one eye.

“Teak-wood somehow suggests

China to me,” I added, a moment later.
258

A Q_u arter to Four
“Have you ever tried to guess how those teak
wood cases came to be in the Gazelle?”

“No, Zelda. I have never even tried to guess
how Thomas Brackett, my cousin Arthur, or
your brother Archie came to be in the Gazelle.
They were soldiers, and supposedly off some
where in the Philippines, or in China. What

were they doing on Captain Trent's brigantine,
with ten teak-wood cases?

It’s a condition of

affairs that defies analysis.”
“Some one of the four sent us those cards,
with instructions to meet at the Palace Hotel on

April twenty-fifth.”
“Presumably, that was my cousin Arthur.”
“It must have been. Presumably, also, he was
taken off this island, for he could never have sent
the cards from here. Why did he deal through
lawyers, instead of sending the cards directly to
us?”

“In my case, Zelda, it was impossible for him
to deal directly with me, as he did not know my
address. I have been a rolling stone, you know,
and rolling stones are proverbially hard to find.”
“Your cousin, I think, dealt with only one law
259

A Q_u arter to Four
yer, Robert, and that was Mr. Price. If so, your
cousin must have been in San Francisco.”
y

“If Arthur was in San Francisco,” said I in
credulously, “why did he not come to see me?
Why did he not help us with advice, give ex
planations, or even join the expedition?”
“He may have been unable to do so, or perhaps
he had some good reason for hanging back.”
I shook my head hopelessly.
“It's bootless to do any surmising now, Zelda.

iThe treasure has vanished, and the mystery will
probably remain unsolved.”
“The treasure will return, and the mystery
will be solved,” she asserted, with quiet convic
tion.

Day after day we labored on. We came to be
completely wrapped up in the rejuvenation of
that whale-boat, rushing to the hut for our meals,
and then rushing off again, with hardly half a
dozen words for Mrs. Brackett.

Two weeks slipped away. Most unexpectedly,
the lapse of the fortnight brought us to the end
of our island probation.

It was afternoon, and I was just finishing off
260

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
the stern of the whale-boat preparatory to calk
ing. Very quietly, Zelda announced:
“There's a ship, Robert.”

I turned quickly around. The girl was looking
seaward, shading her eyes with her hand.

There was no trace in her of the joy a cast
away would be expected to feel in the circum
stances. She had said, “There's a ship, Robert,”
just as she might have remarked, “Here comes
Aunt Sarah to call us to supper.”
The ship was a fore-and-after, and was stand
ing in quite close. “A schooner,” said I. “You
aren’t in much of a transport, Zelda. Aren’t you
glad we're going to be taken off?”
“I suppose I am,” she answered dubiously, with
a regretful look at our unfinished work, “but I
wish the rescue could have been delayed until we
had got the whale-boat into the water.”

Throwing down the stone hammer, I stepped
to her side.

. .

“You have been happy here,” I asked, “in spite
of the fact that we were marooned, and that we
have lost the treasure?”

“Happy, yes,” she murmured, “happier than
I ever thought I could be.”
261

A Q_u arter to Four
-

“I have been happy, too,” I said, taking her
hand.

“Even a barren rock in the Pacific be

comes a paradise, when there is work to be done,
and love to—”

“Robert!” she cried out, showing some excite
ment at last. “That ship is the Lady May.”
I had not been watching the schooner, but try
ing to catch the hazel eyes, which were evading
mine and gazing seaward. Zelda's words star
tled me, and I turned and stared across the sunlit
WaterS.

Zelda was right. The schooner was none other
than our old friend, the Lady May.

The main question was this: Why was she re
turning?

Did the fact bode well or ill for the

three on the island?

262

CHAPTER XXVI.
A New Master.

Zelda and I hastened to carry the news to Mrs.
Brackett.

There was not the least doubt as to

that good lady's feelings, for she was fairly be
side herself with joy.
With Zelda and me, I believe Mrs. Brackett
had achieved a certain amount of contentment

there on the island.

But the roots of her con

tentment had not struck so deep that she felt
constrained to regret the end of her probation.

Together we proceeded to the westernmost ele
vation. The schooner, bearing down on the
island smartly from the northeast, would cer
tainly hunt for her old anchorage in the cove.
For two hours we watched her. Coming
around the end of the island, she beat in through
the leeward passage, and splashed her anchor
into the lagoon. Lying directly under us, what
I saw on her decks surprised me.
The skipper with the fiery hair was not in evi
dence.

Neither was Vandeleur.

263

A Q_u arter

to F O u r

Stubbs was on the poop, and his raucous voice
rolled up to us as he gave his peremptory orders.
I observed that he was armed with a rifle.

Anderson, also armed, was forward among
the crew. Larsen, a revolver thrust through his
belt, stood aft alongside of Stubbs.

The hands forward moved nimbly enough, yet
it was clear that armed authority alone held their
respect. Stubbs looked up at us, and motioned
toward the beach.

When we gained the sands, Anderson was on
his way to us in the dory. The boat grounded,
and he stepped ashore with a grim smile.
“All well, Mr. Lorry?” he asked.
“All well, Anderson,” I replied. “What's hap
pened aboard the schooner?”
“I’d prefer to let Captain Stubbs tell you that,
sir. You are to go aboard in the dory, and I am
to help the ladies get their traps down to the
beach.”

I looked at Zelda questioningly.
“We will help Mr. Anderson, Robert,” said
she. “Besides, we shall want to go over by the
spring before we go aboard.”
264

A Q_u arter to Four'
She and Mrs. Brackett wanted to pay a last
visit to the graves, and they wanted to be alone.
“You can go there to-morrow, Zelda,” I ad
vised.

“Begging your pardon, sir,” put in Anderson,
“but Captain Stubbs wants to get away to-night.
You will understand why when you get on board.
That’s the reason, too, he sent me ashore, in
stead of coming himself.”
I pushed off the dory and got in. A few min
utes laid me alongside the schooner's stern, and
I climbed to the deck.

“Glad to meet ye, Mr. Lorry,” grinned Stubbs.
He had the worn, tired look of a man who has

encountered trouble and bested it by grim en
durance. “Thought ye’d git along all right fer
a while with the stuff I piled on the beach.”
I shook his hand heartily. He leaned against
the forward part of the cabin, where he could
keep watch of the men, and kept the rifle in his
hands. Larsen was forward, leaning against
the starboard rail. The two Americans, the Mex
ican, and the Kanaka huddled sullenly against
the port rail, opposite.
“What's been going on here, Mr. Stubbs?” I
265

A Q_u a r t e r to
asked.

“Where's Captain Golden and Vande

leur?”

“Vandeleur's locked in your old stateroom, an’
the skipper is in irons in his bunk.”
“In irons?” I echoed.

“Off his head,” explained Stubbs, “batty as

they make 'em. That puts me in cap'n, see?
Soon’s that happens, I tacks about an’ stands fer.
this island, to undo the wrong the skipper done

“You’re a whole man, Captain Stubbs,” said I
gratefully, “and you'll lose nothing by acting as
you have done.”
“When Golden has charge, I does as he says,
which is plain sailorin', an’ what a mate agrees
to when he signs on. But when the skipper runs
foul o' an accident, an’ goes loony, then the mate
steps in an acts accordin’ to his own lights. No
sea-lawyer can git around that, eh, Mr. Lorry?”

“Right is on your side, Captain Stubbs,” I
agreed.
“Better leave off the ‘captain part, Mr. Lorry

pried open by Cap'n Golden, but I don’t think
anythin’ ter speak of was taken out.”
“What happened to the captain, Mr. Stubbs?”
“He was half-seas over an' tumbled down the

poop-steps. There was a gun in his pocket, an’
it went off, the bullet plowin’ along his anatermy,
an’ lodgin some’rs in his head. He was able ter
move around, but he went off the jump right
from the start.

It took four o' us ter handle him

time about everythin'ye could think of. We got
the irons on him, an’ fer the last two days he's

“When did this happen?”
“We was nine days out, beatin' up ag’inst the

The crack of a revolver interrupted Stubbs.

The sharp report was followed by a yell and the
sound of a struggle.
The Mexican and the Kanaka had leaped to
one of the boats on the forward house.

Larsen

had ordered them back, and Allison and Minturn
had rushed across the deck to disarm him.

Larsen had time to shoot, and Minturn fell

back, cursing and gripping at his left wrist. Al
lison closed with Larsen, and the Mexican and

the Kanaka jumped down from the house, and
268

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
rushed toward the scene of the struggle, with
knives in their hands.

“Git back, ye murderin swabs!” yelled Stubbs.
“Back, I say, or I puts a shot inter ye betwixt
wind an’ water.”

Springing to the main deck, I rushed forward,
grabbing a belaying-pin as I went. Leaving Lar
sen to settle for Allison, I dodged the Kanaka's
knife, and swung on his head with the pin. He
tumbled in his tracks.

The Mexican, seeing Stubbs' rifle trained on
him, threw down his knife, and tossed his hands

in the air. I picked up the Mexican's knife, and
the Kanaka's, and threw them overboard.

By then, Stubbs had raced to the scene. Pluck
ing Allison away from Larsen with a steellike

grip, he flung him clear across the deck, and
against the port rail. As the fellow jumped up,
Stubbs handed him a fierce blow directly between
the eyes, and down he went like an ox under the
poleax.
The four were then dragged and kicked to the
fo'c'sle hatch and thrown below. “Stay there, ye
onnery whelps,” shouted Stubbs, “till I tell ye ter
come on deck. If one o' ye shows his head with
269

A Q_u a r ter to Four
out orders, I’ll put a bullet through it.” Stubbs

closed the hatch and turned away.

“That's a

sample, Mr. Lorry,” said he; “it shows what's
li’ble ter happen when ye got a lot o' beach-comb
ers for’ard an a few boxes o' treasure aft.

But

I'll git you an’ them boxes safe ter 'Frisco, if
I hev ter kill every man-jack in the fo'c'sle.”
Larsen had been a bit rough-handled, but not
seriously hurt.
“Ay tank day vant to steal da boat an go
'shore,” said he.
“Sarve 'em bloody right if I’d put 'em ashore
an’ leave 'em,” growled Stubbs; “would, too, if
I didn’t need ’em ter work ship.”
Leaving Larsen to guard the fo'c'sle hatch,
Stubbs and I went below. Petie was looking after
the captain.
Golden's face was haggard, his red hair strag
gled about his brow, and through the tangle the
unshielded cavity of his defunct eye showed hor
ribly. Under the hair, and hiding the depression
in the temple, was a white bandage. The skip
per's eye was closed, and he seemed asleep.
His manacled hands lay across his breast. His
feet were not secured.

Stubbs, “an kept him lashed ter the bunk, be

“Is there any one on board that knows any

“Anderson does. He examined the skipper
arter he quieted down so'st we could sheer along
side without a fracas.

But it's too much of a

problem fer Anderson. Anderson thinks the
only thing we kin do is ter leave the skipper like
he is till we git back ter’Frisco.”
We moved on to the stateroom, unlocked the

door, and called to Vandeleur. He came out,
crawling over the boxes that filled the space be
tween the lower bunk and the bulkhead.

He was

an exceedingly disheartened youth, if appear
ances counted for anything.
“What's the use of keeping me locked up?” he

whimpered. “This isn't my doing, Mr. Lorry.
Golden was to blame.

I'll admit I told him

more'n I ought to, but after that he took every

be bygones, if you are.”
He thrust out his hand toward me.

I turned

away in disgust.
“It won’t be necessary to keep him locked up
there any longer, Mr. Stubbs,” said I. “His
power for evil is gone, and there are men enough

aboard now to look after the four in the fo'c'sle
and Vandeleur, too, if he needs it.”

“Jest as you say, Mr. Lorry,” returned Stubbs,
“but I never did hev any use fer that tow-headed
lubber.”
Two hours later the schooner was hailed from

the shore, and I rowed over in the dory and
brought back Zelda, Mrs. Brackett, Anderson,
and the little heap of goods they had carried to
the beach. Mrs. Brackett was crying softly, and
Zelda's eyes were red.
About nine o’clock that evening we caught the
wind in our topsails and worked through the
leeward channel into the open sea; then we put
about, gave the island a wide berth, and laid OU11.
course for home.

".

homeward voyage happened on the first night out.
Some blame was afterward attached to Stubbs,
and, indirectly, to the rest of us, because of it;
yet Stubbs was asleep in his berth at the time,
and the rest of us, on deck or below, were as
powerless to prevent the tragedy as though we
had been a thousand miles away.
Mrs. Brackett and Zelda were in their state

room. I was standing the first watch with An
derson, helping to keep an eye on Allison and the
Kanaka, who had been brought up from the fore
castle for duty. Stubbs, as has been stated, was
getting a little needed rest in the stateroom occu
pied by Vandeleur. The Kanaka had the wheel.
Suddenly, an ear-splitting yell echoed from be
low decks, aft.

An instant later, I saw a form

bound through the companion, jump to the rail,
and go over the side, head first.
It all happened so quickly that no one could
get close enough to interfere before the splash
alongside told that the man had struck the water.
“Man overboard!” came the yell.
Anderson shot his orders rapidly at the Ka
naka, and I leaped to help Allison with the sails.
The schooner came around, and when I went aft
273

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
I found that Larsen had come up and was help
ing Anderson clear away the dory.
“It was Captain Golden,” said Anderson.
“Larsen says he jumped out of his bunk, bowled
Petie over with a double-handed blow of the steel

cuffs, and rushed for the deck.”

Larsen and I manned the dory, while Anderson
climbed the main rigging to watch and direct us.

274

CHAPTER XXVII.

'Frisco Again.
Our efforts were useless. Manacled, as the
skipper was, he must have gone down like a piece
of lead.

Larsen and I cruised about for two

hours, and were then called back to the schooner

by Stubbs.
“No use wastin’ any more time,” said Stubbs;
“the skipper's got his what-for, though I’d ruther

it had come in any other way. I'll git you an'
Anderson ter sign the log as witnesses, Mr. Lor
ry, when I write it up in the mornin’.”

The schooner was once more put on her course,
and we bore away, leaving the ill-fated skipper
somewhere in the broad reach of waters behind.

It was a depressing event.
Captain Golden had been no friend of mine,
and he had tried at least twice to take my life,
yet the suddenness with which he had met his
end inspired a gruesome feeling which I did not
get over for days.
Zelda received the news of the skipper's death
275

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
calmly and without comment. Mrs. Brackett's
humanity brought from her a few words of re
gret, but nothing could mar the good woman's

complacency over the prospect of an early arrival
home with a quarterly share of the treasure.

The effect of the tragedy on the four mutinous
men forward was most marked.

Their sullen

ness vanished by degrees. They had come to
realize that there was nothing in the ten boxes
for them, and I soothed their regrets by an offer
of double pay, all around.
A few days after Captain Golden's death I
called a conference in the cabin, a second confer
ence of the four.

One of the teak-wood boxes

had been opened by the skipper and Vandeleur,
and a little mound of its contents was heaped on
the cabin table.

The mound consisted of metallic fragments,
roughly hacked from some parent mass, and

showing ax and pick-marks. There was little in
a casual survey of the fragments to suggest
value. Every piece was stained and discolored,
and in some of them were embedded particles of
broken stone.

276

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“Is that all we get for our trouble?” muttered
Mrs. Brackett, surveying the heap dejectedly.
I took up one of the fragments and cut into it
with a knife. It cut easily, and the passing of
the knife-blade left a glittering surface, streaked
with yellow and gray.
“Unless I am greatly mistaken, Mrs. Brack

ett,” I remarked, “each of these fragments con
sists of silver and gold, in a marvelously pure
state. By some means, perhaps by the action of
volcanic fires, the metal has been melted and run

together. There are ten boxes of this rich con
glomerate, remember, and each box weighs a
hundred and fifty pounds. In other words, we
have some fifteen hundred pounds of gold and
silver, in nearly a pure state. As a mere guess, I
should say that each box contains treasure to the
amount of thirty thousand dollars.”
“Thirty—thousand—dollars!” gasped Mrs.

Brackett. .
“That's simply a guess. We don’t know the
proportion of silver to gold, nor how much must
be taken from the weight for foreign matter em
bedded in the molten metal. But I am of opin
ion that the figure stated is most conservative.”
277

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
Mrs. Brackett struggled for a while to com
prehend the enormity of our good luck. Vande
leur, sitting at one side of the table, kept his head
down and his eyes averted. Zelda, sitting at my
right, was calmness itself.
“Mr. Lorry, where did it all come from, I won
der?” Mrs. Brackett, her mind floundering help
lessly in a mire of undreamed-of riches, reached
after their origin as a measure of relief.

“That is something, Aunt Sarah,” said Zelda,
“that we shall probably never know.”
“Well, anyway, we’ve got a good right to the
treasure,” bristled Mrs. Brackett, as though by
her vehemence to quiet the still, small voice of
conscience. “When I think of my poor boy, lyin'
back there on that rocky island, I don’t feel that
there is enough money in this world to make up
his loss to me. We’ve got a right to it, I know
we have.”

“Certainly we have,” affirmed Zelda.

“We

should not have been sent for the treasure if we

hadn’t a right to it.”

“By Jove!” chimed in the thin voice of Vande
leur, “it’s ours, no matter where it came from.”
“I have an idea,” I theorized, “that the treasure
278

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
was found somewhere on the island. The very
name of the island, no doubt given to it by our

relatives, would seem to point to that fact. Then,
again, Fortune Island is of volcanic origin.
Somewhere about it this molten metal may have
been found. I am not enough of a metallurgist
to know whether a mine of silver and gold could
exist in such a condition as we see these frag
ments, yet that is the only explanation I can
Offer.”

“In the absence of anything more definite, Rob
ert,” said Zelda, “it is the explanation we shall
accept.”
I was made custodian of the boxes by Mrs.
Brackett and Zelda, even Vandeleur assenting
to the arrangement. Upon reaching San Fran
cisco I was to turn the treasure into money and
parcel it out in quarterly shares.
A day or two later I had a talk with Vande
leur, forcing him to a full and complete confes
sion of his double-dealing. He had hired the two
beach-combers to “lay” for me the night I went
to Logy Bill’s, just as I had supposed.
When they reported their failure to him, on
the same night the attack was made, they like
279

A Q_u a r ter to Four
wise brought the news that I had gone to Logy
Bill to secure his help in putting me on the track
of a reliable skipper.
Vandeleur knew of Captain Golden through
Captain Trent. Armed with the information
brought by the hired footpads, Vandeleur called
on Captain Golden, told him some of the facts in
the case, and suggested that he approach Logy
Bill in a cautious way and see if Bill would not
refer him to me.

That is exactly what happened. All our subse
quent troubles were due to Logy Bill's failure to
make sure of his man.

As soon as it became certain that Captain Gold

en was to take our expedition seaward, he and
Vandeleur began to plan.

They finally decided

that it would be best to wait until our destina

tion was known, then put me out of the way as a
troublesome

menace

to

the

success

of

their

schemes.

After the failure of the attempt to get me over
board in the southeaster, the ludicrous rivalry
between the skipper and Vandeleur for Zelda's
favor caused a coolness between the conspirators,
and I was let alone. Captain Golden overheard
280

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
Zelda telling me that her object in making her
self agreeable to the skipper and Vandeleur was
solely to insure my safety, and the “rivals” imme
diately became reconciled and agreed to continue
their nefarious work.

-

The blow I had given the skipper on the beach
of the lagoon inspired him to go ashore with
Vandeleur for the purpose of seeking vengeance.
Their discoveries at the eastern end of the island

followed, and they believed they had done their
worst when the rope was tossed from the cliff.
Returning to the schooner, Golden ordered
away the three boats and went to the cavern. If
I had been there, Vandeleur assured me, I would
never have left the cavern alive.

Golden and Vandeleur, positive that the cav
ern had something to do with our secret mission
to the island, searched it carefully, and, of course,
found the ten boxes. When they weighed anchor
and left the island, Captain Golden intended to
make port somewhere in South America, dispose
of the schooner, turn the treasure into negotiable
funds, divide with Vandeleur, and then he and

Vandeleur would lose themselves in distant parts
to enjoy their ill-gotten gains.
281

A Q_u a r ter to Four
In making his confession, Vandeleur was very
careful to shield himself at the expense of the
dead skipper. Vandeleur, to take his word for
it, was always the one who was led, always the
one who deprecated violent measures. Yet I
knew the part he had played as well as though
he had told it, and his desire to shirk responsibili

ties served merely to increase my contempt for
him.

We were more than a month getting back to
San Francisco.

As soon as we had effected a

landing, a cab was called, and Mrs. Brackett and
Zelda proceeded at once to our old lodgings in
Kearney Street.
I remained overnight in the schooner with
Stubbs, and, on the following morning, hired a
dray and accompanied the ten cases personally
to the Morgan Smelting and Refining Company.
Here the bullion was weighed and a receipt given
me in the name of Brackett, Anstruther, Vande

leur, and Lorry.

Two days afterward I called for my statement
and check. There was a ripple of excitement
in the office of the smelting company when I pre
282

A Q_u arter to

Four *

sented myself, and I was requested to step into
Mr. Morgan's office for a private interview.
A spasm of doubt seized me, and I began to
have vague fears for the outcome. Mr. Morgan
was a stout man, with sharp, commercial eyes.
My appearance, I believe, was respectable
enough, but I am very sure that I did not look
like the honest custodian of the treasure deposited
two days before. Mr. Morgan had a memoran
dum of the bullion and a certified check before
him.

“You will pardon me for making some in
quiries, I trust,” said he, “but the large amount
of gold and silver which you left with us, and the
peculiar condition in which we found it, impel me
to ask you a few questions, Mr. Lorry.”

“I shall be glad to give you any information
you may desire,” I answered.
“Could you send for the other parties who are
interested with you in this matter?”
-

“Certainly, if you wish it.”
A boy was sent out to secure a cab, and pro
ceed to the house in Kearney Street with a note
for Zelda.

In half an hour the cab had returned,
283

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
and Mrs. Brackett, Zelda, and Vandeleur were

with me in Mr. Morgan's office.
During our wait for my three companions, I
had ample time to observe the suspicion with
which Mr. Morgan regarded me; and when Zelda
and Mrs. Brackett entered, I saw the suspicion
slowly leave his face.
“Have you any objection to telling me where
this large amount of gold and silver came from?”
inquired Mr. Morgan.
I nodded to Zelda.

“Will you satisfy his curiosity, Miss An
struther?” I asked. “Tell him everything. I
have an idea that Mr. Morgan looks upon us as
freebooters, and I, for one, should like to have

him entirely satisfied.”
Zelda launched into the story forthwith, be
ginning with the quartered card of instructions,
mentioning our interview with Mr. Price, and
following the narrative through to our landing in
San Francisco. Of course she mentioned only
those matters that had to do with the treasure,

leaving out all incidental matters.
Mr. Morgan excused himself, went into an
other room, and we could hear him calling up Mr.
284

A Q_u a r ter to Four
Price. Presently Mr. Morgan returned, smiling
and perfectly satisfied.
“Your narrative, Miss Anstruther,” said he,

resuming his chair, “sounds like a tale from the

Thousand and One Nights. I wish to congratu
late all of you,” and here he swept the four of
us with a comprehensive glance, “on your cour
age in following a very strange affair through
to a successful and highly profitable conclusion.
“I find,” he continued, consulting the memo
randum before him, “that Mr. Lorry deposited
with us, for your joint account, 22,400 ounces of
precious metal. Of this amount, 12,216 ounces is
gold and 8,184 ounces silver, both of an exceed
ingly high degree of fineness.

“The gold amounts to $284,320, and the silver
to $4,501.20, making a total of $288,821.20, for
which I now hand Mr. Lorry our certified check.
Allow me to congratulate you again on your good
fortune, and to bid you a good morning.”
It required Zelda on one side and myself on
the other to support Mrs. Brackett back to the
waiting cab.
“You will have more than seventy thousand
dollars for your share, Aunt Sarah,” Zelda had
285

A Q_u a r ter to Four
whispered, and Mrs. Brackett was continually
mumbling the amount over to herself.

From the office of the smelting company we
drove to the bank on which the certified check
was drawn.

There we wrote our names on the

back of the check, exchanging it for four drafts,
each for the sum of seventy-two thousand two
hundred and five dollars and thirty cents.

“We have still to reimburse Mr. Lorry,” said
Zelda; “if each of us gave him twelve hundred
dollars

sy

“I’ll send him my check,” said Vandeleur airily.

This happened more than a year ago, and Van
deleur's check is still on the way.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

Dight Breaks.
Settlement for the use of the schooner was

made with Job Golden, a ship-chandler and a
brother of Captain Nathan. No complaints were

lodged against the hands. They received their
wages from Job Golden, together with a similar
amount from me, for I had promised them double

pay shortly after leaving Fortune Island.

.

With the consent of Mrs. Brackett and Zelda,

a bonus of one thousand dollars was given the
mate, and five hundred dollars each was given
Anderson and Larsen as a gratuity. Had these
three not served us so well, the entire treasure

would probably have escaped us.

The extra money came at a particularly oppor
tune time for Mr. Stubbs, inasmuch as Job Gold
en was harassing him with threats on the score of
the dead skipper. I suggested to Mr. Stubbs that
he spend a little of his bonus for a lawyer's
services, and sent him to Mr. Price.

Mr. Price sent the ship-chandler a call to come
287

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
to his office.

When Mr. Golden came he faced a

counter-threat for damages if he persisted in

maligning Mr. Stubbs. Thereupon Mr. Golden
dropped the matter.
Mrs. Brackett did not remain long in San
Francisco after obtaining her share of the treas
ure. At her urgent request, Zelda accompanied
her to Emmetsburg for a visit of several weeks.
Before Zelda and Mrs. Brackett left, I asked

Zelda the most momentous question of my life,
prefacing it with a brief account of my career as
a soldier of fortune. During my clash with Van
deleur in the cabin of the Lady May, at the time
the envelopes were opened, he had made a slur
ring attack upon my character. I wanted Zelda
to know everything before she gave me her an
SWer.

She smiled as I offered my reasons for going
into the recital of my past.
“That was entirely unnecessary, Robert,” said
she. “When two persons have been together so
long, and have faced so many dangers side by
side, as we have, they come to know each other
pretty well, I think.”
“Your answer, dearest?” I asked eagerly.
288

A Q_u a r ter to Four
“I thought I gave it to you, weeks ago, when
we took that walk up the valley from the cliff
to the cabin.”

-

So she had; but, loverlike, I felt that the sweet
est story ever told could not be told too often

even if its depth and intensity proved the despair
of words.

-

So she gave me her answer again; and while
I was sealing the compact with a kiss Mrs. Brack

ett came into the hotel parlor—and stood aghast.
Rosy and bright-eyed, Zelda flew to her, put
her arms about her neck, and told her the secret,

our secret. And poor Mrs. Brackett avowed that
she had never dreamed of such a thing!
Nothing would do, then, but that I should come
to Emmetsburg in the course of a month, so that
Zelda and I might honor her home with our nup
-

tials.

“It will be clear of that mortgage by then, my
dear,” asserted Mrs. Brackett, “and if there is

anything in omens, you and Mr. Lorry will be

blessed with a good one.”
San Francisco seemed dreary indeed after Zel
da had left, but I tried to keep busy. After nearly

nine years of profitless roaming I at last had
289

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
money to invest, and with Mr. Price's help I was
able to invest it safely and well.
I saw nothing of Vandeleur, but I heard that
he was, to use a slang term, “flying high,” and
burning the candle at both ends in the attempt
to get rid of his money.
After three weeks of San Francisco, I began

making preparations to leave for Emmetsburg.
And then, on the very morning of the day I had
planned to start, a hasty summons reached me
from Mr. Price.

I was to call at his office imme

diately.

Wondering what could be in the wind, I hur
ried to answer his request.
“Mr. Lorry,” said he, after we were both com
fortably seated in his private office, “I am now
at liberty to tell you more regarding your recent

highly successful expedition to Fortune Island.”
“At liberty?” I repeated, bewildered.

“Exactly that. I was bound by a promise up
till this very morning. Not that I know anything
worth while,” he put in hastily, “or anything
which, if told, would have helped you materially
in your work. What I have to say is merely by
way of explanation.
290

A Q_u a r t e r to F O ur
“Several months ago I was sent for by a pa
tient in St. Andrew’s Hospital. I found this pa
tient to be a man who had been badly hurt and
was slowly dying from the effects of his injuries.

He might live a week, the doctor said, or he might
drag out a miserable existence for a year, but his
end was sure to come.

“This man gave me four sealed, unaddressed
envelopes, together with eleven hundred dollars
in cash. He told me that one hundred and fifty
dollars of the money was to be my fee for doing
certain things which he would stipulate.

“The four envelopes were to be given or for
warded to four different people, who lived in
various parts of the country. The addresses of
two of those people were known, and the ad
dresses of the other two were to be found.

“The names the man gave me were yours, Mrs.
Brackett’s, Miss Anstruther’s, and Mr. Vande
leur’s.

Where Mrs. Brackett and Miss An

struther were to be found, he knew.

He also

knew that Vandeleur lived somewhere in San

Francisco, but of your whereabouts he was en
tirely ignorant.
“Vandeleur was easily discovered, and a letter
291

*

A Q_u a r ter to F our
to your Uncle Rufus, in Great Barrington,

Massachusetts, developed the fact that you were
in Chicago. There were certain questions to be
answered by all of you, in order that identity
might be proved beyond all peradventure.

“The man in the hospital had these questions
written out on separate sheets of paper, together
with the correct answers. He impressed me with
the fact that fortunes were waiting somewhere in
the Pacific for the four whose names he had

given me, and that to find the whereabouts of the
fortunes, the contents of all the envelopes would
be needed.

“My task was to see that the envelopes reached
the proper parties. My client suggested that I
work through lawyers in various parts of the
country, and I was to forward with each en
velope the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars
in cash. Out of this amount the several lawyers
were to keep fees of fifty dollars each, the re
mainder being turned over to the person the law
yer was to communicate with.
“The fact that my client was in San Francisco
was to be kept a secret, as well as was everything

else except the details that had to do with the
292

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
coming together of the four, and the beginning
of their enterprise.
“My client it was who offered the suggestion
that the four make themselves known to each

other by the mystical formula that concerned the
time of day. “This, said my client, will not only
prick their curiosity, when a bare statement of
what they were to do might fail, but it will also
give them a fitting idea of the caution necessary
to the success of their undertaking.” Personally,
I think that my client was logical and entirely
COrrect.

-

“Human nature is a queer thing, Mr. Lorry.
This client of mine is a good judge of human na
ture, and he had worked out every detail of his
plan while lying on his back in the hospital ward.”

“But this client of yours, Mr. Price,” I broke
in, “if he knew of this treasure, why did he allow
it to go out of his hands?”
“As I have already said, he has been bedridden
for months, and slowly dying. Fate denied him
an active part in seeking the treasure, and what
good could the treasure do him when his doom
was sealed and merely a matter of weeks, or

months? Besides, he assured me that he was
293

A Q_u a r ter to F O u r
bound by a solemn promise, a promise given to
the dying. What he hoped to accomplish was the
recovery of the treasure by those entitled to it,
and to so plan that not one of the four, if so dis
posed, could take unfair advantage of the others.”
Mr. Price got up from his chair.
“You now understand the preliminary details,
Mr. Lorry,” said he, “and if you will accompany
me to the hospital, you will learn whatever else
is necessary to make the whole matter clear.”
I was now at the end of the mystery, and I
had discovered that the end of it did not lie in

far-away Fortune Island, but right there in San
Francisco. Mr. Price had a carriage waiting at
the curb.

We entered it and were soon at St.

Andrew’s Hospital.
An attendant, who had seemingly been ap
prised of our intended visit, met us in the office,
led us to an elevator, and to a private ward on
the third floor. He tapped on the door, and a
white-capped nurse answered the summons.
“Mr. Lorry,” I heard the attendant whisper to
the nurse.

“In a moment,” the latter answered, and went
back into the room.
294

A Q_u a r ter to Four
Presently the nurse returned.
“He wishes to see Mr. Lorry alone,” said she.
“Just go right in, sir,” she added to me.

Thrilled with all this mystery, supposedly sur
rounding the clearing of the great puzzle.

I

passed into the white, high-walled room. The
door closed behind me.
On a white iron bed in the center of the room

lay a man whose thin face was like chalk, and
whose black, burning eyes seemed abnormally
large. A slight smile crossed the cadaverous face

and gave a ghastly twist to the bloodless lips. A
clawlike hand was lifted and held toward me.
“Bob!” exclaimed a weak voice.

I stared, stepped forward, and grasped the cold
hand, and stared again.
“Arthur!” I exclaimed. “Arthur Mayhew!”

295

A Lifted Veil.
“I didn’t think you'd know me, old chap,” said

Z\rthur; “I’m a bit changed since you saw me
last. Draw up a chair by the bed. My voice isn’t
any too strong, and I’ve got a lot to say.”
Vividly impressed by the difference between
the roistering, harum-scarum lad I had known
years ago and the wreck that now lay before me,
I pulled a chair close and sat down. For a few
moments Arthur lay quiet, staring at me intently.
“Your mother and mine were sisters, Bob,” he

murmured, “and if they had not died so soon per
haps you and I would have been different. Who
knows? I never was so bad as your Uncle Rufus
chose to think me,” he added, with another of his

ghastly smiles, “so when I couple your lot in life
with my own, it is not in an evil way. Soldiers
of fortune!” His smile became a husky laugh.
“I am dying early, don’t you think?”
“Perhaps it isn’t so bad as all that

In a few days, the doctor says, my heart will be
involved. Then—the Unknown. I shall pass
into the undiscovered country’ with a better con
science now that I know a solemn promise has
been fulfilled, and that I have been the means of

bringing wealth to four who deserve and are en
titled to it.”

He paused.
“Hand me a glass of water, Bob,” he said
abruptly. “My throat is as dry as a bone.”
I gave him the water, and he rested for a min
ute.

“You did the business, all right,” he smiled.
“Price told me. How much did it weigh out?”
I told him.

“Good!” he exclaimed. “I was able to bring a
little with me when I left the island—enough to
see me through this hospital experience, and to
hand around something for lawyers’ fees and to

give you four a limited amount for traveling ex
penses. And, I say, Bob?”
“What is it, Arthur?”
His flaming eyes danced with a suggestion of
their merry, boyish twinkle. “What time is it?”
he asked.
297

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
I looked around for a clock, and again he
laughed huskily.
“I thought you would tell me a quarter to

four,’” he went on. “Have you so soon forgot
ten, or didn’t it make the impression on you I
thought it would?”
“Certainly it impressed me strongly enough.
But why didn’t you have me come right here, and
tell me the whole business?

That would have

been the sensible way to get at the thing, Ar
thur.”

“You don’t understand, Bob,” he answered ear

nestly. “I was bound by a promise. I could not
even seem to give you an advantage over the
Other four.”
95

“But you know I am hones

“Tush, boy! Of course I know you are honest.
To tell the truth, I didn’t want to talk with you
before you crossed the water for that treasure.
I was afraid you'd find out too much about it, you
have such a keen way with you, and would not
go after it.”
I started as though stung.
“Wasn't the treasure honestly come by?” I de
manded.

298

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
“My three dead comrades are lying in Fortune
Island,” said he, giving me a steady look. “Be
fore I closed their eyes I promised each one of
them that the person he named should have a
rightful share in the treasure. When men die,
they try to go with clear consciences, even as I
am trying. Is it likely, Bob, that they and I
would want you to go after treasure that was not
honestly come by?

“The point hinges on your personal interpreta
tion of right and wrong. I know that I am right,
and you must acknowledge that you feel in the
same way before you leave this room, or I shall
die plagued with the thought that I have been a
curse instead of a benefit to you.”
“Go on, Arthur,” I urged, strangely thrilled.
“I thought you got that silver and gold from
somewhere about the island.”

“We didn't!” he burst out vehemently.

“It

came from the mint at Tien-Tsin.”

“From the mint at Tien-Tsin!” I gasped.
“By fortune of war,” Arthur resumed, still ve
hemently. “Are you a soldier of fortune that you
should balk at what comes to you by fortune of
war? Nonsense, Bob! Listen:

A Q_u a r t e r to F O u r
“The old Ninth did itself proud on that hot
July day when we rushed the Chinks, blew up
the wall, and marched into the town.

We went

into quarters at the arsenal, and all the soldiers
were mad for loot. And it wasn’t the foreign
soldiers only, for the Chinks themselves had the
biggest finger in the pie. For three days it went

on, Chinks, Japs, Frenchies, Britishers, Russians,
Germans—they all were at it.
“Everything went.
English officers rode
through the streets with their horses buried under
piles of silks, furs, and bronzes, and soldiers car
ried bundles on their bayonet points. Raiders
plundered the pawn-shops and stores, and when
they came out were held up and the stuff taken
away from them.

“The center of the city was like an ant-hill
kicked open, and thousands upon thousands of
people were diving into the flames, dodging fall
ing walls and daring a dozen kinds of death just
to get their own rake-off. If the stuff hadn’t been
taken it would have burned anyway.

struther, and I were in at the pillage of the mint.

The building had been burned, and the ruined
walls and broken floors were plastered and cov

ered with melted gold and silver. The heaped-up
bars of bullion had run together in the intense
heat and had then flowed in a rich wave over the

floor. Hundreds of people were there, and every

body was helping himself.
“Brackett and I got picks and axes, and while
we cut, and hacked, and tore the metal veneer

from the floors, Archie dumped ten cases of am

munition down a well and brought in the boxes
'for us to fill.

“Well, we filled 'em.

We had to work like

Turks to do it, but we finished the job, and did
it well.

Then we made that deal with 'Gene

Trent.

He had a brigantine off Port Arthur,

and he agreed to get the stuff away for an even
share. It was taking a big risk, for we didn’t

know a thing about Trent, and what reports we

got of him weren't any too favorable.
“But it was Trent, or no one, and so we chanced

it. He was to get the stuff down the river in a
sampan, transfer it to a junk, and get it aboard
the Gazelle at Port Arthur. Then the Gazelle

was to sail for Nagasaki, and wait there until we

three joined him—and he was to wait a year if he
had to.

“My time had nearly expired, and so had An

struther's. Tommy had a couple of years before
him, and he was wondering how he could slip
his hawse without doing anything underhand, or
unsoldierlike.

“We three forgot about Trent and the boxes
in the hot times we had during the march to
Pekin. Archie and I were there when we got

our discharges. Tommy was there, too, flat on
his back in a heathen temple that had been con
verted into a hospital. He had a bullet in him
somewhere, and had been mentioned for bravery.
“When Archie and I had drawn our travel pay
and got our papers, we took a wagon-train and

went down to Tien-Tsin with a squad of dis
charged men. The last thing Tommy said to us,
when we left, was: “Don’t forget to hang around
old Nagasaki till I catch up with you.’
“Well, Archie and I got across to Nagasaki on

as to whether Trent was there, or had slanted
away with our plunder. We were a couple of

surprised and delighted travelers, I can tell you,
when we saw the brigantine in the bay and read
off the name across her stern.

“Captain Trent had had a time of it, too, for
he told us he had to put up a single-handed fight
with the sampan-men in order to get the stuff
to the junk, and while he was in the junk he had
to sleep on the boxes with his guns handy in order
to keep the piratical crew from throwing him
overboard and appropriating the treasure.
“We idled away two months at Nagasaki wait

ing for Tommy to come. We had about made up
our minds that his wound had got the best of
him, and that he had been planted somewhere in
side the walled city, when, lo and behold! along
he comes—a little peaked and pale, but spry as
a cricket.

“‘Didn't desert, did you, Tommy?" Anstruther
asked.

“‘Desert?’ says Tommy, with fine scorn; not
me, for all the gold in China—and I tell you
there's a power of it. Invalided home, that's

Arthur had rushed on with his account, his
words fairly tripping over themselves. He
paused suddenly, asked for another drink, and
stared hard at me over the top of the glass.
“What do you think of it, Bob?” he asked,
handing the glass back.
“I don’t know what to think, Arthur,” said I
gloomily. “I looked for a surprise, but not for
anything like this.”
“I haven’t a hair-trigger conscience, as they
call it,” Arthur proceeded, “but I don’t think any
one can complain that I never tried to do what's
right. I’ve given months of study to this thing.
I’ve studied it from the point of right and wrong
between men, and between man and his Maker,

and I decided long ago that the treasure was

rightfully ours. If we hadn't taken it, some one
else would. And where's the wrong of taking
a thing that’s bound to be taken anyway, and
from a people that didn’t deserve to have it in the
first place?”
I remained silent.

“Well,” said Arthur, “I’ll go on. The Gazelle

sailed for San Francisco. For weeks everything
went well, and then, one night, we tried to sail
across a reef and into an island that wasn't on
the chart.

“It was blowing hard at the time, and the
brigantine went head-on with a smash that broke

her down clear to the foremast. The sailors in
the fo'c'sle were drowned like rats in a trap, and
those on deck were washed overboard.

“Trent, Brackett, Anstruther, and I were be
low, in the after cabin, and we crawled up on
deck as quick as we could and tried to get a
whale-boat into the water.

A wave stove her in

against the side of the wreck and every one of us

got hurt. That's what's doing the trick for me
now, Bob. I was hurt internally somehow, and
the trouble never took form until after I was

picked off the island by a tramp sealer and had
started for home.

“We were a quartet of cripples, after that, and
it was the hardest kind of work getting to land.
I was thrown into the water and got ashore by
swimming; Trent and the other two followed in
the dory.
“We ere on the island two months—that is, I

was, for my comrades began to drop off the sec
ond week after we landed. The first week,

though, we all managed to do a fair amount of
work. Anstruther had a broken arm, Brackett's
wound had opened up again, so those two buckled
in on shore, while Trent and I ferried back and
£orth between the beach and the wreck.

“We brought away canned stuff and other pro
visions, and Brackett and Anstruther picked up
wreckage on the beach and carried it to the val
ley, where we built our cabin. We took the gal

“Our hardest job was getting out those ten
boxes. Man, man, but Trent and I sweat blood

from the ammunition-cases to the teak-wood

boxes at Nagasaki.

Somehow, Trent couldn’t

bear the look of those United States army am
munition-cases.

“We had found that cave while snooping

around the island in the dory, and Trent thought
it would be safer to dump the boxes on the beach

inside the cave; then, if any boat happened along
and picked us up, there wouldn’t be any disagree
able questions asked. If the rescuer looked like
a pretty decent white man, we'd trust him to help
us get the boxes; if he didn't, we'd leave the boxes
where they were and come back after them.
“So we labored like galley-slaves getting the
treasure out of the wreck and into the dory, and
out of the dory and into the cave. After that

first week, we all got together in the cabin we'd
built, and the gloom had settled over us thick.
We hadn't a notion that any of us would ever live
to get away, but we each gave information about
our next of kin, along with other needful details,
and it was written down, and solemn promises
were made to do the right thing.
“Brackett, poor chap, was the first. He'd be
alive to-day but for that bullet the Boxers threw
into him. His hardships at the time the brigan

couldn’t do anything. He flickered out during
the night, and we found him cold and stiff next

morning, with his mother's picture gripped in his
fingers.

“We buried him, picture and all, alongside the

grave of some of the sailors we'd picked up on

the sand. Then I began getting out headboards,
and put in my spare time carving them.
“Gruesome work?

It was worse than that,

Bob. Here we'd been soldierin’ in the Philip
pines and China, counting the hours until we were
to get back to God’s country, only to wind up on
that miserable rock in the Pacific and begin end

“Anstruther followed Brackett. Nostalgia—I
think the doctors call it—got in its work and

third week.

“Trent was tough, and he hung on longer than

week, and there I was, all alone on the island,

manufacturing headboards!
“Trent, before he died, had taken the island's
bearings, and I had them down on a piece of
paper, along with the other information the rest
of the lads had given me. Also, I had some of

as a sort of sample, and the survivor was to have

CHAPTER XXX.
Conclusion.

Loot! Loot from the pillaged city of Tien
Tsin!

How that thought rang in my brain as I
walked away from the hospital! And again and
again my conscience asked: What shall I do?
What is it right to do?
I thought of what that treasure meant to Mrs.
Brackett, widowed and childless; of what it meant

to Zelda, and what to me. I turned the problem
over in my mind a thousand times, and I could
come to no decision.

If I half-decided that it was right to keep the
treasure, then Self-interest arose and grinned
mockingly in my face; if I half-decided that it
was not right to keep it, then Arthur's face
haunted me, and fancy flew across leagues of
heaving Pacific to a lonely island with four stark
headboards, and beside one of the mounds Mrs.

Brackett was kneeling, and over another bent
Zelda Anstruther.
3II

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
I went to the hospital undecided. I went away
awed, impressed, sorrowful.
Arthur was dead! I had seen the screen pulled
around his cot, and the nurse had led me behind

it, and I had stood, hat in hand, looking down on
my cousin's calm, untroubled face.
“His last words were for you, Mr. Lorry,” said
the nurse.

“What were they?” I asked.

“They were these—I do not understand them,
but I presume they will be clear to you: ‘Tell
my cousin Bob to keep what he has, and say noth
ing; if not for his own sake, then for the sake
of the others.’ You know what he meant, Mr.
Lorry?”
“Yes,” I answered huskily, and turned away.
-

Arthur had died fearless in the conviction that

it was right for us to keep the treasure.
After I had laid Arthur away I called upon
Mr. Price. Behind the closed door of his private
room I repeated Arthur's story as faithfully as

memory would allow. Then I asked for his ad
vice.

The lawyer lighted a cigar.
“Anstruther and your cousin, Arthur May

A Q_u a r ter to F our

hew,” said he, as I thought irrelevantly, “must
have seen some hard fighting in China?”
“I suppose so,” said I. “If there was any hard
fighting, and Arthur could get in it, there'd be no
holding him back. But what has that to do with
the question, Mr. Price?”
He did not seem to hear my question.

“And Tom Brackett,” he went on, “was badly
wounded and mentioned for bravery?”
“Yes,” I answered, growing more and more
perplexed.
“And you had an uncle killed in the uprising?”
“Why, yes; but Mr. Price
“Wait a minute, Lorry,” he interrupted. “As
near as I can figure it out, China owes you, and
Miss Anstruther, and Mrs. Brackett something
99

on account.

Vandeleur, it strikes me, is about

the only one who's getting something he's not en
titled to—but then we haven’t any means of

knowing what Captain Trent did for or against
the Chinamen. I can see by your face that you
think this a specious argument, Lorry. But I
don’t know. Your cousin’s last words to you
seem to strike a telling note.”

The lawyer puffed at his cigar in silence, for a
313

A Q_u a r t e r to Four
few moments, and then once more picked up the
thread of his remarks.

“Do you want to talk about this thing, Lorry,
and get Mrs. Brackett so harrowed up that she'll
return every stiver of her share to the Boxers?
Do you want some country skinflint to foreclose
on that mortgage and turn the old lady out of
house and home? Or, on the other hand, are you
willing to tuck your sentiment in your pocket and
let Tom Brackett's mother keep a roof over her
head, and live in peace and plenty all the rest of
her days?”
I was silent.

“And Miss Anstruther,” continued Mr. Price.

“She has a young brother to look after, hasn’t
she? Tell her what you know, and I imagine
Archibald Anstruther, out there on that un
charted island in the Pacific, would turn in his

grave. As for Vandeleur, how much talking do
you think it would take to make him give up what
he’s got?”

There was nothing I could say, and I continued
to sit quietly and wait for more light.

Leaning back in his chair, Mr. Price reflected
deeply until he had smoked the cigar to his lips.
314

A Q_u arter to Four
Then he tossed aside the remains of it, got up
and stood before me.

“I appreciate your feelings in the matter, Mr.

Lorry,” said he, “and they are infinitely to your
credit. I am sixty years old, my boy, and I con
sider myself a good American; and I have tried
to be a just man always, in spite of the fact that
lawyers are popularly supposed sometimes to be
paid for their principles. My judgment is this:

The matter has passed from national to one of
mere individual importance. Possession is nine
points of the law, and you have possession. Fol
low the line of least resistance, and peace go with
you.”
So I pocketed my conscience and followed the
line of least resistance, but real, substantial peace

was never wholly mine until a few days ago.
A year passed, and during all that time I had
not breathed a word of Arthur's story to any one
except Mr. Price, and I had begun to feel that
it was about time I made a confidante of Mrs.

Lorry.
So I told her.

During that year my affairs had prospered

amazingly. The Oro group of mines, in Colo
315

A Q_u a r t e r to

Four

rado, had developed into a second Comstock lode.
By advice of Mr. Price I had purchased half the
stock of the Oro Company, investing most of my
own funds and Zelda's.

The company had recently disposed of its hold
ings to an English syndicate, and my profits and
Zelda’s were such as to make that entire Fortune

Island treasure look very small indeed by com
parison.
Mrs. Lorry received my account of the source
of the island treasure with an equanimity that
surprised me. “I am glad that you told me,
dear,” was all she said.

A week later she came to me and smilingly
proffered a request for a check, forewarning me,
at the same time, that it was to be quite a large
one, and stating that I was not to know the dis
bursement of the funds.

-

-

“How much is it for, dear?” I asked, whirling
my chair around to my study-table, opening my
check-book, and picking up a pen.
She laid a slip of paper on the table before
me. The amount penciled on the slip was $144,
4Io.60. I dropped the pen and fell back in my
chair with a gasp.
316

“Can't you spare it, dear?” Zelda asked.
“Why, of course, but—but
She put one arm about my neck and laid her
soft cheek against mine. “Then why don’t you
99

write it?” she asked.

I wrote it. Next day a thought came to me
and I did a little figuring.

That island treasure had yielded each of the
four the sum of $72,205.30. Twice this amount
gave for a product the face of the check I had
written for Zelda.

What she did with the money I don’t know; but
my conscience has been easier ever since.

THE END.
