CHAPTER I
A STRANGER IN HIS OWN TOWN

Guy Herbert arrived in Concord, Dakota Terri
tory,” on the noon train. As soon as he had re
moved the stains of travel and eaten his luncheon,

he made haste to inquire his way to the office of
The Concord Blizzard.

The Blizzard was reckoned a very potential
power throughout Dakota, and not to have heard
of it was synonymous with being a stranger in
that part of the country. A man named Keever
Colonel Archibald Keever, if you please-presided
Over the destinies of The Blizzard.

His was also

the guiding hand that manipulated the affairs of

the Concord Townsite Company in those booming
times of ’85.

Guy had to do with the Colonel on

matters appertaining to the town-weighty mat
ters so far as Guy was concerned.
The building that harbored the sanctum with
its accompanying “plant” was an unsightly two

story structure covered with tar paper held in
place with strips of lath. A flight of crazy stairs
clung to the outside, and Guy, somewhat doubtful
of their stability, laid hold of the hand-rail and
ascended cautiously. At the landing above he

turned sharply to the left and was confronted by
a door bearing this printed placard:
OFFICE OF THE BLIZZARD

FEARLESS CHAMPION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN,
IN GENERAL,
AND OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IN PARTICULAR.
WELCOME.

[G" Wipe Your Feet on the Mat.
Guy scraped his shoes assiduously and passed
into the sanctum. One would hardly have
thought that in such a musty little cubby-hole the

powerful mind of Archibald Keever was wont to
evolve those gems of editorial wit which had made

The Blizzard venerated and feared all the way
from Fargo to Bismarck, and from Standing Rock
as far north as Turtle Mountain. Yet such was

the fact. Guy looked about him with interest.
Insurance calendars, farming implement adver
tisements, a cheap lithograph of Topsy and an
other of Eliza pursued by bloodhounds did their
little mite toward covering the rough board walls.
Two ten-penny nails, affixed to the board wall by
half their length, supported a white hat and a
cane. A window containing eight panes of dusty

glass let in a mellow light upon the great man
who sat at a desk, his profile to the caller, and
took no notice of him. Evidently the editor was
in the throes of composition.
Guy had no desire to interrupt and remained
standing very quietly in the center of the floor.
Scratch, scratch, scratch. Humped over that

antiquated desk with his old steel pen scraping
away as for dear life, what fire the Colonel must
have been throwing into that editorial ! Guy
observed him curiously.
The Colonel was not tall, but rather short. He
was also very stout—a pudgy man with an ex
tremely pudgy countenance. His face was red, the
tip of his nose conspicuously so. He wore a mus
tache and chin whiskers, both gray and bristling,
and cut in the fiercest form compatible with high
respectability. The better to show the Colonel's
illustrious bumps, Nature had denuded of hair the
greater portion of his scalp. Phrenology had been
a pastime study of Guy's and he observed how,
beginning at the temples, the hirsute fringe bor
dered the Colonel's head passing, at the back, no

higher than the topmost limits of Philoprogeni
tiveness, imperfectly developed. Two small eyes,

murky, but wide apart, claimed Guy's final atten
tion.

The caller realized suddenly that he had been in
the office for quite a considerable period. If the
Colonel could not grant an interview, he might
say so and Guy would call again. The young

get away !

“Don’t let him

Maybe he wants to subscribe l’”

Guy was startled. He halted and peered about
the room, finally detecting a cadaverous, ink
begrimed face topped with a snarl of red hair.
This face was peering into the sanctum from the
workroom through an unused stovepipe hole cut

in the partition. The red-haired boy grinned as
he caught Guy's eye and dodged away to escape a

paperweight which the Colonel hurled at him.
The Colonel's aim was bad and Guy observed that
the opening was bordered with dents and abrasions.

“By gad!” exclaimed

the editor,

angrily,

“that imp has knocked the tar out of one of the
finest things I have set hand to in many a day.
If the people ever find out what they lose on ac
count of that graceless cub, they'll rise up as one
man and hang him, no doubt about it.” Whirling
in his pivot chair he glowered at his caller.
“Perhaps I had better go and come back at
some more convenient time,” said Guy.

“The mischief has been done and my inspiration
is knocked into a cocked hat,” answered the
Colonel, softening. “If you wish to subscribe for

my excellent paper, two-fifty a year, in advance, I
shall be pleased to enter your name on the
books.”

A

“I presume I am addressing Col. Keever?”
“You are, sir, you are.”
“I do not wish to subscribe, Colonel, but have
come on other business.”

The Colonel looked disappointed; nevertheless
he waved his hand hospitably towards a chair.
“Very well, sir. What can I do for you?”
“My name is Herbert, Guy Herbert,” answered
the young man. The other acknowledged receipt
of the information with a nod.

“You were the

manager of the Townsite Company, were you
not?”

“Were!” cried the Colonel. “I am, sir, at the
present moment.”
“Three men owned the townsite,” continued
Guy; “Mr. Harlow Briggs, president of the H. G.
& Y. Railroad; Mr. Edward Thomas, a lumber
dealer in St. Paul, and Mr. Montfort Herbert.

Mr. Briggs and Mr. Thomas sold out to Mr.
Herbert, and Mr. Herbert”—the young man's
voice trembled—“died two months ago.”
“You don’t tell me!” ejaculated the Colonel.
“Of course I know all about the company; in fact,
I am on familiar terms with Briggs and Thomas
and both knew and admired-admired, I say, sir
Mr. Montfort Herbert.”

The Colonel settled back

in his chair and shook his head sadly.

“And so

Herbert is gone,” he murmured. “This news
comes with appalling suddenness.”
“Mr. Montfort Herbert,” resumed Guy, “was
my father.”

I4

His Friend the Enemy

“Your father !” The Colonel struggled to his
feet, rushed upon Guy and wrenched his hand

powerfully. “My dear boy, this would be a happy
moment for me were you not the bearer of such
sorrowful news.” The Colonel dropped Guy's
hand, reached behind him to the tails of his coat
and brought forth a large bandanna handkerchief.
Applying this to his eyes, he proceeded to pace the

narrow confines of the sanctum while rallying from
the blow.
Guy was surprised at this manifestation of feel

ing. He was aware that his father had known
Col. Keever well; so well that, having acquired
entire charge of the town, he was on the point of
dispensing with the manager's services at the time
his last illness came upon him.
Halting under the stovepipe hole, the Colonel

recovered the paperweight, again seated himself
and laid both paperweight and handkerchief on
the desk beside him.

“As Mr. Briggs and Mr. Thomas sold out to
my father,” observed Guy, “and since I am my
father's sole heir, it naturally follows that I—”
Guy hesitated.

“It naturally follows that you own the town,”
finished the Colonel. “A princely inheritance, my
boy.”

“Do you think so?” queried Guy hopefully.
“I do, providing we can keep the county-seat.”

“Then I hope Concord will be able to keep it,”
said the young man fervently.

“Aside from a few

A Stranger in His Own Town

15

hundred dollars, this town is all my father left
me.”

-

The Colonel's face lengthened. Guy observed
this and augured direfully.
“What's the matter with the county-seat?” he
asked. “I understood that Concord had it hard
and fast.”

“County-seats, my boy, are peculiar institu
tions. In this country it takes a county-seat to
make a town; consequently, every settlement in a
county that has been able to euchre the Govern
ment out of a post-office feels in duty bound to

step in and try for it. You are familiar, I sup
pose, with the fight we have had up here?”
“I know that the town of Harmony was beaten
at the polls a year or more ago. I thought that
settled the question.”
“It should have settled the question, but it
didn’t. Harmony is like Banquo's ghost, and
won’t down. Do you know what the Harmony

ites, under the leadership of that arch conspirator,
Wilbur Vlandingham, have done?”
&4

NO.”

“Well, I'll tell you. Two-thirds of the qualified
voters of Goodwill county have signed and pre
sented a petition to the County Commissioners,
praying that the county-seat be removed to Har
mony, and the Commissioners have ordered a

special election to be held for the purpose of vot
ing upon the question. This, mind you, is in
direct violation of the law !” The Colonel brought

I6

His Friend the Enemy

his clenched fist down on his desk with a vim that

made the ink leap out of its stand and prostrated
the pen rack.

“What say the statutes?” he de

manded. “They expressly stipulate that the peo
ple's will, with respect to changing the location of
county-seats, shall be learned at the general elec

tion directly following the presentation of the
petition praying for such change. Now they have
called a special election. A sandbag game, sir!
Robbery, rank robbery!”

“If it's illegal, why can’t it be stopped?” asked
Guy.
The Colonel's indignation dropped away and he
smiled indulgently.
“This is Dakota, my dear young man. The
Commissioners are under the thumb of Vlanding
ham. But you wait. Archibald Keever is to the
fore and The Blizzard lives ! We'll beat them, I
tell you.”
“How P”

The Colonel tapped his brow significantly.
“It requires a two-thirds vote to capture the
county-seat away from us,” he replied. “I have

arranged matters so that Harmony will never be
able to roll up a sufficient ajority.” The Colonel
arose and

alked to the window.

“Come here,

Mr. Herbert.”
uy passed over and stood beside
him. “Behold my confidence in the outcome,”
added the Colonel, with a sweep of his arm.

What Guy saw was a ten-by-fifteen building in
process of construction. At least a dozen men

*~~<----------- ~~~~-----

A Stranger in His Own Town

17

were working upon it and even a novice like Guy
could see that they were very much in each other's
way.

“A lot of carpenters for a small house like
that,” commented the young man.
“I should say so,” chuckled the Colonel.
“Those men were brought in from Jimtown and
they're voters, every mother's son of thein. I’ve
got others building roads and repairing bridges.”
He closed one of his murky little eyes, slowly and

slyly. “They'll vote as I tell them to, Mr. Her
bert, and there'll be enough of them to kill Har
mony too dead to skin.” He threw up the win
dow. “Hello, there, Jordan l’’ he called to a man
who was working languidly with a saw. “You
fellows are getting along altogether too fast.
Take a lay-off this afternoon.” Instantly all work
ceased, tools were left where last used and the
twelve workmen hurried away in a body. The

Colonel closed the window and beamed upon Guy
complacently.

“That's the court-house they're

building,” he explained.
“Rather a small court-house, isn’t it?”
“Oh, it will grow, it will grow.”

“Where does the money come from?” inquired
Guy anxiously.

“Don’t worry about the money, my boy. I
sold a batch of lots to a tenderfoot a few weeks

ago, and it's his money that's doing all this.”
“It doesn’t seem just right to rush voters in in
that way, Col. Keever.”
2

His Friend the Enemy

I8

“Anything's right that's successful up in this
Territory. This is my little plan, and of course
Harmony isn't laying back on its oars and wait
ing for me to grab the persimmons. Vlandingham
and his lieutenants, Dingle, Harp, Blue and
Boomer, are going to do something, but just
what remains to be seen. They have a town
meeting over at Harmony to-night to discuss
ways and means for getting ahead of me !” The
Colonel's smile faded into a look of trouble.

“I’d

give a hundred dollars,” said he, “to know what
kind of a scheme they hatch up at that meeting.

They'll have lynx-eyed men on watch, however, to
make sure that no Concord fellows get in.”
The Colonel turned and wandered reflectively
about the office. Guy sat down again and
watched him thoughtfully. Finally the Colonel
halted, thrust his thumbs into the armholes of
his vest and declared :

“Herbert, you're the man l’”
“The man for what?”

“To run over to Harmony and take in that

meeting. You're a stranger in this section, and
they won't know you from Adam. Be careful,
though, and don’t give yourself away. Feeling is
running high and both sides are exceedingly bit
ter. If you were to be found out you’d have a
rough experience. Ever carry a revolver?”
s&

NO.”

“Then get one. I haven’t anything but the
office gun and can't spare that.”

A Stranger in His Own Town

19

“Col. Keever,” said Guy, reddening, “I’m not
going to make a spy out of myself.”
“Tush, tush ! You're not doing anything dis
honorable. I’d cut my tongue out before I'd

counsel anything of that kind. You're a high
minded young man-I can see that at a glance
and I admire you for it. But those fellows on the

other side of the county are blackguards, every
one of them. They are laying their plans to steal
the county-seat away from you and all you are to
do is to discover what their plans are, if possible,
so we may balk them in their nefarious attempt.
My boy, you have something like 1,200 lots in
this town. That means a fortune for you if we

can keep the county-seat. If we lose the county
seat your lots will be worth just what they'll
bring for farming purposes, and no more. Nor is
that the worst of it. Let Harmony win in this
election and every man, woman and child now
living in Concord will pull up stakes and move
Over to the Other town.”

“They wouldn't leave their homes and their places
of business, would they?” queried Guy, aghast.
“Not much they wouldn’t leave 'em—they'd
take 'em along. You could put wheels under the
National Capitol and move it a hundred miles
over these prairies without jarring out a brick or
a chunk of mortar. My word for it, Mr. Herbert,
let Harmony win and there won't be so much as

a hencoop left to mark the site of the present
town of Concord.”

2O

His Friend the Enemy

“I’ll go,” said Guy.
“I thought you would,” returned the Colonel
approvingly. “There's a freight down at six
thirty. Take that.”

“Copy. C-o-p-y !” bawled a voice through the
hole in the partition.

The Colonel made a dive for the paperweight
and the red-headed printer vanished in a flash.
“I’ll have to grind out some stuff for that
rascal, or he'll drive me crazy!” exclaimed the
Colonel, tossing his hands.

“Then I won’t bother you any longer,” said
Guy.
“You’ll have to be discreet,” went on the Col

onel, following the young man to the door.
“Don’t let those Harmony chaps get an inkling

as to who you are or what you're there for,
that's all. Keep your plans to yourself and don't
talk about them to any one in this place. There's
a bad leak in this community somewhere, and

more than one choice plan of mine has floated out
of it and drifted over to the enemy. Sharp's the

word, and I shall expect a good report from you
in the morning.”

The Colonel gave the young man's hand a part
ing grip, closed the door on him and then seated
himself before his desk and resumed his scratching.

“He’s clay in my hands,” soliloquized the Col
onel blithely. “I can do as I please with him, and
can make or mar the future of this town—which

ever is the more profitable.”

A Stranger in His Own Town

21

Out in the workroom the red-headed printer had
been doing some peculiar things. The moment
Guy had left he had thrust the brush-end of a broom
out through an open window; and then, on the
reverse side of an old piece of copy, he had writ
ten the following:
“Guy Herbert, son of the late Montfort Herbert,
arrived in Concord at noon and at this hour

2 P. M.—has just left the old man. He's going
over to the town meeting to-night to get some
pointers, Watch out for him. He's about twenty
two or three, five feet eleven or possibly six feet
tall, dark hair and mustache, and looks as though
he was built for business.”

That was all. The printer neither addressed the

note nor signed it and the moment he finished
writing the last word a soft tap fell on the back
door.

The printer made haste to answer the knock.
A man stood outside at the head

of the rear

stairway—a strapping big fellow with his trousers
tucked in his boot-tops. He and the printer ex
changed winks as the scrap of paper was handed

over. Then the big fellow noiselessly descended
and the printer noiselessly closed the door and
removed the broom from the window.

That “leak” was through the stovepipe hole in
The Blizzard office.

CHAPTER II
IN THE HOSTILE CAMP

Guy had four hours and a half at his disposal
before the freight train left Concord, and he made

up his mind that he would put in the time looking
over the town.

Before descending the decrepit

stairs leading from The Blizzard office, he lingered
at the top to scan the three points of the compass

that were open to him. As the building occupied
by the newspaper was well at the foot of the
main thoroughfare, nearly the whole of Concord
lay under the young man's eye.
Certainly no eulogies were to be wasted upon
that collection of houses and stores. The princi
pal street had roads debouching to left and right.
Buildings were not huddled together; on the con
trary, they were far apart, with stretches of virgin

prairie between them. It had been the policy of
the Townsite Company to donate a lot in each
block in the residence portion to any one who

would build a house upon it. For this reason,
nearly every dwelling had a block to itself.

Main street began at the Northern Pacific depot
and ran south for half a mile beyond The Blizzard
building, the latter closing up the ragged file of
23

24

His Friend the Enemy

store structures. Just south of the depot was a

huge, barn-like hotel. The hotel, be it observed,
always formed the nucleus of the “boom” town.
Across from the hotel was the office of a real

estate agent; south of that, on the same side, was

a building erected by the Townsite Company for a
bank; then there was a drug store and then Mr.
Benjamin Glimmer's Emporium, and then a livery
stable, the latter almost opposite The Blizzard
building.

Between the latter and the hotel was

the new court-house.

As Guy gave further attention to the court

house he saw something which had before escaped
him, namely, a weather-vane. This vane was cut
into the profile of a man's head, hand before the

face, thumb to the nose and digits outspread.
The head looked steadily and insolently westward
and refused to move with the northeast wind.

Guy's anger arose at the sight. He had no idea
what such a vane might mean but he would
tolerate nothing of that kind in his town. That
vane was to come down in a very short time, even
if he had to remove it himself.

Descending the stairs he went over to the Em

porium and introduced himself to the proprietor.
Mr. Glimmer was a slender man of sallow com

plexion and looked at the world through iron
framed spectacles. He was glad to meet Guy and
presented him to several citizens; among others,

Elisha McQuilkin, the postmaster, Lemuel Bil
kins, a youth of harmless aspect, whose abnor

In the Hostile Camp

25

mally long and spider-like legs were the standing
joke of the town; Christopher Waffle, Justice of
the Peace and proprietor of a threshing outfit,
and Bill Comfort, who operated Judge Waffle's

engine. Conversation with these gentlemen re
vealed such a depth of animosity and bitterness
over the county-seat question that Guy was sur
prised.
“The Harmony folks have threatened to come
down on us like Assyrians on the fold and run off
with the county records,” observed Mr. Glimmer,
his thin lips compressing and his eyes gleaming

through his glasses. “We'll fool ’em if they try it
on, I can tell you. I've only to pull this rope”
—he laid his hand on a rope that dangled through
a hole in the ceiling—“and a bell on the roof 'll

ring out a warning and bring every citizen to the
new court-house.”

“And every citizen will bring a gun l’’ snapped
Waffle.

“And use it if necessary !” thundered McQuilkin.

Coming from the fairly peaceable confines of
Chicago this warlike language filled Guy with
considerable apprehension. It likewise gave him a
realizing sense of the danger of the mission he was
about to undertake.

If the Harmony people were

aroused in a similar degree, to be discovered tak
ing notes at their town meeting would mean-Guy

refrained from following out this train of thought.
He did not care to anticipate the disaster which
would probably befall him in case of discovery.

26

His Friend the Enemy

Truth to tell, this work was being entered upon
against the counsel of his honor. In love and
war, however, all means are supposed to be fair,
and he was endeavoring to apply that principle
in the present case.
Nevertheless, he was
troubled.

The 6:30 o'clock freight had a few cases of
merchandise for Concord

and while these were

being unloaded Guy climbed into the caboose on
the rear of the train.

“I’ve counted as many as three people, father,”
broke upon Guy's ears in a feminine voice that
was richly musical.
“One of those is the station agent, Betty, and
doesn't count,” replied a voice of masculine tim
bre, so deep it was almost a roar.

Guy discovered the second speaker instantly.
He was a large man wearing a black slouch hat
and was sitting on a seat that ran along the side
of the car, his eyes close to a window and eagerly
observing the town.
The other speaker was not so easily located,
but Guy found her at last. She was perched on a
stool up in the “lookout,” or cupola, and was
also studying the main street with eager gaze.
“I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the gallant

Colonel,” continued the girl with a ripple of
laughter. “Subtract him from Concord and the
result is naught.”

“Huh !” exclaimed the father without looking
around. “Keever is the biggest cipher in the

man's arms.—Page 27.

27

whole lay-out. Everybody will know that one of
these days.”

“I can't understand,” went on the girl, “why
more people haven’t come down to see that the

train arrives and departs properly.”
“Pardon me,” put in Guy whimsically, halting
below the young lady and looking up at her, “the
people here do not manifest the same interest in

a freight that they do in a passenger. Besides,
there are two men and a dog behind the depot
whom you have overlooked.”

-

The large man at the side of the car switched
around and fixed his eyes on the speaker.

The

girl also turned in her seat, in a startled way,
and looked down.

She was a very handsome girl, her fine, clean-cut

features possessing the charm of womanly resolu
tion and firmness. Symmetry was the keynote of
face and form, and the eyes, the lips and the
square, dimpled chin all told of underlying
strength. From the viewpoint of a physiognomist

she delighted Guy, and it may be that the joy of
his character study betrayed itself, for the young
lady suddenly assumed a haughty air which be
came her amazingly. She vouchsafed him a frigid
stare, tossed her head disdainfully, and then

Well, just then the train gave a terrific jerk in the
uncomfortable manner that all freight trains have,
and the young lady was precipitated from her

perch fairly and squarely into the young man's
arms. Guy was a good sailor and able to keep

28

His Friend the Enemy

his feet in the hardest kind of a blow, so he re

mained upright, and was able to save the young
lady from any ill effects that might have accom
panied her fall. Undoubtedly she was grateful,
but she did not show it.

Her face was in a flame

as Guy released her, and her white teeth closed
bitingly on her red underlip.
“Jupiter, but that was neatly done !” exclaimed

the large man, heartily. “Betty, why don't you
thank him? That drop might have hurt you, my
girl.”
“Had he not attracted my attention,” flared

Miss Betty, “I would not have lost my hold.
These freight trains are simply insufferable and
this is the very last time I shall ever ride on one.”
“Allow me,” said Guy.
Stooping he picked up a chain bracelet which

had become unclasped from Miss Betty's dainty
wrist. She took it from him, replaced it around

her glove, and then seated herself on one of the
side seats just where the last flicker of sunlight
touched her reddish hair into gold. A very pretty
picture she was, too, sitting stiffly erect in her
injured dignity and looking neither to right nor
left. The large man shifted his twinkling eyes

from her and gave Guy a wink.
“What's your line?” he asked.

“I don’t understand you,” returned Guy.
“Drummer, I take it?” The large man squinted
about Guy's vicinity as though searching for
sample cases.

In the Hostile Camp

Guy was annoyed, especially as Miss Betty's
sense of the ridiculous prevailed over all and al
lowed a smile to twitch at the corners

“You are mistaken, sir,” said Guy.

of her

“I am not

a drummer.”

“Been long in Concord?”
“A few hours only.”
“That was as long as you could stand it, I
suppose. Well, I don’t blame you. If you want

to make a little money during this boom you’ve
got to buy lots in a live town like Harmony.
My name's Vlandingham, young man.”
Guy had been on the point of saying that he
already had more lots than he knew what to do
with, but the large man's announcement of his
name caused him to take another course.

Here

undoubtedly was the very Vlandingham who had
the County Commissioners under his thumb and
was the ringleader of the conspiracy to steal the
county-seat away from Concord. Guy became
wary on the instant.

“My name is Herbert, Mr. Vlandingham,” said
he. “I am going over to have a look at Har
mony.”

“Mr. Herbert, my daughter, Miss Elizabeth
Vlandingham.”
The easy familiarity of the Northwest had long

since claimed Wilbur Vlandingham for its own and
he presented the stranger to his daughter with a
cheerful disregard of the proprieties. But if he

3o

His Friend the Enemy

forgot himself Miss Betty was far from being ruled
by his example. To Guy's profound bow she re
turned only the curtest of nods, two little wrinkles
between her brows showing her disapproval of her
father's course. Mr. Vlandingham smiled and
winked again.
“Harmony,” he resumed, “is my town, Mr.
Herbert.”

-

3*

“Our town,” corrected Miss Betty.
“Certainly, my love,” deferred her father;
“whatever is mine will some day be yours.” He
turned once more to Guy. “Harmony is going to
have the county-seat, Mr. Herbert, and the mo
ment the result of this special election is known

lots will go up with a jump.” Leaning sidewise
confidentially he tapped Guy on the knee.

“Take

my advice. Buy a few lots before the rise.”
“I’ll have to think about it,” said Guy.
“Of course, and while you are thinking about it

you are to accept the hospitality of my humble
home.”

Miss Betty shot a quick glance of protest in her
father's direction.
* ,

“Really, Mr. Vlandingham,” answered Guy, “I
couldn’t think of such a thing.”

It was one thing to prevent his fortunes from
being wrecked by reconnoitering the enemy, but it
was quite another thing to sit at table with the

general of the hostile camp and carry the espial
into his very household. Guy drew a line at that.
“Nonsense !” cried Vlandingham. “I won't

In the Hostile Camp

3.

have it any other way. You're going with me
and I won’t take no for an answer.”

“It is impossible,” returned Guy, firmly.
“By Jupiter, we'll see about that. In my own
town-beg pardon, Betty, our own town—things
go about as I-as we-want them to go.”
“I appreciate your kindness,” said Guy, em
barrassed by the persistent nature of Vlanding
ham's hospitality, “but I cannot impose upon
you.”
“Impose ! Hear that, Betty? He talk of im

posing on me-on us—after saving your life, my
girl! Think of how you would now be lying
crushed and broken on that car floor but for his

heroic assistance 1

Jupiter ! Mr. Herbert, I owe

you a debt of gratitude. Buy two lots at the
present price and I'll throw in two more. Now,
then l’’

Guy was overwhelmed. Miss Betty bowed her
head and her shoulders moved convulsively.
“See how my daughter is affected !” cried Vlan
dingham. “She understands how much we owe
you, Mr. Herbert, and—”
A smothered laugh came from Miss Betty. She
looked up presently, straightening her face with an
effort. Guy was chagrined. The more he saw of

Elizabeth Vlandingham the more he wished they
had met under happier circumstances.
“My father, Mr. Herbert,” remarked the young
lady, “is very anxious to sell our lots. He has

forgotten that there are none for sale.”

32

His Friend the Enemy

“What?” gasped Vlandingham, aghast.
“After the election the lots will be worth double

what they are now, and why should we divide our

profits with any one?”
Miss Betty had a delightfully contrary nature.
Had Guy accepted her father's hospitality she
would have been set against him; but now that

he was determined not to accept, she was equally
determined that he should.

“Mr. Herbert,” she went on, “allow me to

second my father's invitation. We shall be glad
to have you stay at Willowview while you are in
Harmony.”

The witchery of her blue eyes made the tempta
tion a powerful one, yet Guy shook his head.
Then the blue eyes grew imperious.
“You must !” declared Miss Betty, and Guy
yielded under mental protest.
A few minutes later they were in Harmony,
descending from the caboose far below the depot
and proceeding “cross lots” towards a large and

comfortable-looking group of farm buildings
framed in a dusky setting of willows. Evening
had fallen too darkly for Guy to see very much of
this rival town but assuredly there was nothing
in Concord to compare with Wilbur Vlandingham's

palatial home. Willowview was a manor com
prising, in its entirety, almost a thousand broad
acres abutting upon the townsite. The house was
large and neatness itself without and within.

Dinner was waiting, and after Guy had removed

In the Hostile Camp

33

the cinders and dust with which the short journey

by freight train had liberally covered him, he joined
Miss Betty and her father in the dining-room.
There were only the three of them, and Guy was
not long in learning that Mrs. Vlandingham had
been dead for several years. The daughter had
taken the mother's place in the household and
was filling it, if Guy might judge, with eminent
credit to herself and with supreme satisfaction to
her father.

The dinner was charming. Miss Betty made
herself most agreeable and there was no talk of
lots, or townsite matters, or anything else that
breathed remotely of business or discord. Guy
forgot for the time the mission he had undertaken
at the Colonel's behest. He was brought to him
self, however, with something like a shock, directly
after dinner, while he and Mr. Vlandingham were
in the parlor listening to Miss Betty's piano
playing.

There came a sharp ring at the door-bell, fol
lowed by a colloquy between the maid and some
person or persons without. The next moment
there was a tread of feet and four gentlemen

marched into the parlor, single file, their hats in
their hands.

The gentleman in the lead was a very small
person and from the way his left eye focused itself
unswervingly on a given point while its fellow
roved at will there was small doubt that the left

eye was glass. Behind the leader came a gentle
3

34

His Friend the Enemy

man of towering height—he was taller even than
Guy or Mr. Vlandingham—and his framework was
so loosely put together he could not seem to talk
without jarring himself; the third of the quartet
had a wooden leg and the sleeve of the fourth was
folded over and tucked in the front of his coat.

“Miss Vlandingham,” exclaimed the man with

the glass eye, “your most obedient !” He bowed
and his three companions bowed with him. The
spokesman executed an “about face” and directed
his attention at Miss Vlandingham's father, the

rest of the squad participating in the movement.
“Evening, Squire,” he said, starting a nod that
tilted every head in the row.
“Good evening, gentlemen,” returned Vlanding
ham courteously.
“It's 8 o'clock. Have you forgotten?”
“Not at all.” Mr. Vlandingham consulted his

watch. “It is close to 8, that's a fact. Betty
and I came down on a freight from Jimtown,
Colonel, so that I’d be here in time to connect

with the town meeting.” Vlandingham turned to
Guy. “Mr. Herbert, allow me to present to you
Col. Dingle,”—the man with the glass eye bowed

“Major Harp,”—acknowledgments from the giant
—“Capt. Blue,”—ditto from the gentleman with
the wooden leg—“and Mr. Boomer.” The man
with the empty sleeve ducked amiably. “The
Colonel,” continued Mr. Vlandingham, “conducts

our paper, The Harmony Norther;”—Guy won

papers—“the Major, by grace of the Republican

Administration, hands us our mail; the Captain
is proprietor of the Bee Hive store, and Mr.

Boomer-er-er—what the nation do you do,
Boomer, anyhow?”
“Just hang around,

Squire,”

smiled

Mr.

Boomer.

“That's it,” said Vlandingham. “Mr. Herbert,
gentlemen, will probably invest in some Harmony
lots.” Guy raised his hand in protest.

“After the

election,” supplemented Mr. Vlandingham. “We
have a town meeting to-night, Mr. Herbert, and

you might go along with us and rub up against
some of our best citizens.”

-

“Squire !” exclaimed the man with the glass eye,
crooking his finger.
Vlandingham bent down, and Col. Dingle whis
pered to him earnestly.
“Nonsense !” said Vlandingham, in a low tone,
which nevertheless reached Guy's ears; “I’ll vouch
for him.”

When the six of them finally started for the
meeting, Guy's conscience was sadly troubling
him.

He would rather, a thousand times, have

remained behind and spent the evening with Miss
Betty.

CHAPTER III
A FRIEND IN NEED

The town meeting was held in a vacant room

over the Bee Hive store. So far as Guy could
make out, Harmony and Concord were very much

alike, except that in Concord the business places
were ranged along a main street, while in Har
mony they were grouped about a vacant square.
This was a distinction without much of a differ

ence. The square, Mr. Vlandingham informed
Guy, was reserved for the court-house. In the
event that Harmony won the contest, Guy won
dered what he and Col. Keever would do with
their court-house.

A lamp burned in the entrance leading up to the
hall and a stern-looking man with a rifle over his
arm blocked the way.
“How is everything, Marley?” inquired Vlan
dingham.
“Nothin suspicious so fur, Squire,” replied
Marley, staring at Guy.

“Got sentries posted all around this building?”
“Sure.

No one that ain't on the square can

come within a block of it.”

“That's right.”

Vlandingham and his party ascended the stairs.
37

38

His Friend the Enemy

At the top they passed the scrutiny of another
guard and entered the meeting room. There were
some twenty or thirty men in the hall and Vlan
dingham made for a platform at the farther end
of the room, nodding to citizens on either side

and speaking a word here and there as he pro
gressed.

“I’ll introduce you all around after the meeting
is over,” he whispered to Guy. “You’ll want some
lots, I know you will, and I'll see that you get
them, no matter what Betty says.”

Guy had no time, just then, once more to dis
avow any intention of purchasing real estate in
Harmony, for Vlandingham was late and the
impatient people wasted not a moment in having
the meeting called to order.
Guy sat on the platform with Vlandingham,
Col. Dingle, Major Harp, Capt. Blue and Mr.

Boomer. These five, as Guy quickly learned, con
stituted a Committee of Safety and Ways and
Means. Vlandingham was elected chairman, and

as they had no use for a secretary the business
was begun immediately.
The first man to get the floor was a Mr. Pink
ney. Mr. Pinkney was excited to a hysterical
degree. He shook in body and limb, and during
his agitated delivery of the matter that oppressed
him his voice broke often from excess of wrath

and indignation.
Business had called him to the eastern side of

the county that day, Mr. Chairman and fellow

A Friend in Need

39

citizens, and in returning he had driven boldly
back through the outskirts of that pitiful excuse
for a town called Concord. Yes, sir, and no one

had dared to raise a hand against him. And
what do you think he saw, Mr. Chairman, what
do you think he saw with his own eyes? At this

point Mr. Pinkney gulped his words, choked on
them, and finally managed to articulate hoarsely.
Why, on that rattle-trap of a building which the
wretched Keever is erecting for a court-house, he

actually saw a weather-vane, a monstrous thing
which answered to no wind of heaven but pointed

ever and always in the direction of Harmony.
And what was that weather-vane, Mr. Chairman
and gentlemen, what was it? It was a man’s
head, sir, a man’s head and hand, and the hand
was doing this, looking straight towards Harmony
all the time and doing this, doing this at their
honorable chairman, at Col. Dingle, Major Harp,
Capt. Blue and Mr. Boomer ! Yes, gentlemen,
doing this at all of you!
Mr. Pinkney made a weather-vane of himself for
purposes of illustration. With his thumb to his
nose and his trembling fingers outspread he di

rected the opprobrious gesture at Vlandingham,
then in turn at each member of the Committee of

Safety and then at the entire meeting.

Guy was consumed with a desire to laugh but
suppressed it strenuously. It was not a laughing
matter for the citizens in the hall and not one
detected a trace of humor in the situation.

A

4o

His Friend the Enemy

murmur of rage swept through the assemblage
and Col. Dingle sprang to his feet with a fierce
cry.

“They are all hoodlums and rowdies on the

other side of the county,” he shouted, tossing
his arms, “and the arch-fiend who leads the rab

ble is that schemer, that political trickster, that
preëminent rascal, Archibald Keever!”
In a twinkling the meeting was in an uproar.

Every citizen was talking wildly and shaking his
clenched fists. Vlandingham pounded for order.
When a measure of quiet finally obtained, he spoke
a few words himself.

“We must be quiet, we must be calm, we must
not allow our passions to run away with us. Let
us remember that it is the cool head and the dar

ing hand that win the day. They have flung the
gage at us and we will bear with this insolence
now and return it a hundredfold. Col. Dingle, we
will hear from you.”
Mr. Pinkney sat down and Col. Dingle, calming
himself with a painful effort, declared that this
gratuitous insult could have been the work of
none other than Keever; that he came from Ken
tucky, as did the aforesaid Keever, and that he
wanted the meeting to appoint him a committee

of one to ride directly into the town of Concord
and slap the aforesaid Keever's face.

He would

do it and he would abide by the consequences.
Barely had this duty been laid upon Col.
Dingle's shoulders when an uproar was heard be

low, at the street entrance. The noise increased
and swept up the stairs, and the cause of it all

presently burst open the door and dashed into the
room.

A wild-eyed, strapping big fellow with his

trousers tucked into his boot-tops was among
them.

He was covered with dust and his face was

ominous and eager.

“A traitor !” he shouted, waving a scrap of
paper over his head; “there's a traitor in this
room.”

During the foreboding silence that followed
Guy's heart beat like a trip-hammer.
“A traitor, Barney?” queried Vlandingham,
getting up and sweeping his gaze over the people
before him. His voice was soft, but there was a
metallic glitter in his eyes as he advanced to the

edge of the platform. “Come here, Barney,” he
added, indicating a cleared space in front of him,
“come here and tell us about it. Boomer, you
and the Captain will please guard the exit.”

The Captain stumped away to the door followed
by Boomer, both frowning heavily. Mr. Boomer
grimly developed a revolver.
“I got the information from the Broom Man,”
said Barney, approaching as he had been directed
to do and presenting the folded paper. “I would
have got here sooner but that broncho of mine
consarn him l—got scared and threw me, so I had
to walk half the way.”

Vlandingham unfolded the note and read it
silently. Guy, who was watching him narrowly,

42

His Friend the Enemy

saw his face slightly redden and observed a twitch

ing of his heavy, iron-gray mustache. The deep
stillness was at last broken by the chairman.
“Is there a hunchback man in this room?” he

demanded sternly.

There was not, and Guy was participating in
the general feeling of relief when Barney cried
Out:

“Hunchback, Squire? That doesn’t say any
thing about a hunchback!”
“I thought you couldn't read, Barney?” re
turned Vlandingham, accompanying the words
with a severe look.

“No more I can’t, Squire. I can spell out print
tolerable well but writin' is a point beyond me. I
stopped at your house though, on the way in,
and Miss Betty read the note aloud and sent me
along here in a hurry. She said I wasn't to give
the note to any one but you.”
Was it disappointment or consternation that

afflicted Vlandingham? Guy wondered as he sur
veyed him.
“I have been possessed with the idea, gentle
men,” continued the Chairman, addressing the
meeting, “that trouble is to be expected through
the agency of a hunchback. This note doesn’t
describe such a person, but I know who the man

is. If Mr. Herbert”—he turned to Guy and handed
him the note—“will assist us, we will be able to
capture him without trouble or violence. Please
read that, Mr. Herbert, and inform me whether

A Friend in Need

you are acquainted

with

43

the individual de

scribed.”

Guy glanced at the writing hurriedly.
“Yes, sir,” he replied, “I know him.”
“Will you go with Barney, here, apprehend the

fellow and see that he stays at my house until I
come?”
Guy saw how Vlandingham was trying to save
him. He noted also the perplexed faces of the
citizens in front, and of those on the platform;
especially was he aware of Barney's blank amaze.
The latter's eyes were starting from his head, and
it was evident that his brain was violently dis
turbed. Guy gave Vlandingham a square and
manly look.
“On my honor, Mr. Vlandingham,” said he, “the
man will be at your house when you get there.”
“Why,” gasped Barney, leveling his finger,
“that there—”

“Silence !” roared Vlandingham, knocking the
extended arm downward. “You are to go with
Mr. Herbert and apprehend this man, and take

him to my house. Not a word from you. If you
had been a little later in getting here, your in
formation would have been valueless.

44

His Friend the Enemy

Barney faced about automatically and started
for the door. Guy followed at his heels. Aside
from their echoing footsteps there was not a
sound in the room. The Captain and Mr. Boomer
parted and allowed them to pass, Mr. Boomer

fingering his revolver nervously. The guard in the
passageway eyed them keenly, and the man with
the rifle, at the foot of the stairs, suffered them
to depart without a word.

When they were well on their way to Willowview,
Barney found his tongue.
“Well, I'm dinged !” he muttered.

“You’re the

spy, ain't you?”
“I’m the man described in the note,” answered

Guy, who did not relish the harsher term.
At that precise moment he was wishing Col.
Keever at the antipodes.

His own folly in allow

ing the Colonel to influence him came in for a
large share of his condemnation. Better a hun
dred times that he lost every cent he had in the
world and preserved his self-respect. He was go
ing to meet Miss Betty now, and what would she
think of him?

“Why the dickens did the Squire act like he
did?” asked the confused Barney.
“He did that to save me from the hands of the

Harmony people,” answered Guy with a dash of
irritation. “They're so wrought up over this
county-seat matter that they would have acted

first and thought about their actions afterwards.”
“You bet they would.”

“Mr. Vlandingham is head and shoulders above
the rest of them. He's a gentleman.”
“He’s ole business, that's what. Don't you feel
pretty meachin’?”
“That's my affair.”

“S'pose you'll try to run away now, hey?”
Barney caught Guy's arm and Guy wrenched
away and gave his companion a push that almost
upset him.

“I’m not going to run away. I’ve given my
word and I shall abide by it.”
Barney whistled.
“If the people at the meetin’ had known who
you was, I guess you’d have been carried back
to Concord feet foremost.”

Guy made no answer to this and they shortly
arrived at Squire Vlandingham's house. Their
ring was answered by Miss Betty herself.
“Mr. Herbert 1" she exclaimed smilingly; “I

knew very well that father wouldn’t allow you to
be hurt. But you took frightful chances. Why
are you here, Barney?”
“The Squire sent me along to see that he didn't
get away,” responded Barney valiantly.
“Well, you needn’t remain. I’ll see that he
doesn’t get away. Good night.”
The door was closed in the astounded Barney's
face.

“Come into the parlor, Mr. Herbert,” said Miss
Betty.

Guy couldn’t understand the situation at all.

46

His Friend the Enemy

Miss Betty did not seem to abate one jot or tittle

of her friendliness. “A consummate actress,” Guy
thought; “the storm will come before long.”
Miss Betty motioned towards a chair. After Guy
had obediently seated himself she took a rocker
vis-a-vis. She thought for a moment and then
laughed softly.
“To think,” she remarked, “that neither father

nor I, on hearing your name, ever thought of
connecting you with Mr. Montfort Herbert of the
Concord Townsite Company | And you boarded
that freight train at Concord, too !”
“Why don't you denounce me for being a spy?”
asked Guy, impatiently.

“Why should I denounce you? Concord is your
town, Mr. Herbert, and it is right for you to do
what you can to hold the county-seat. Harmony
is our town and we shall do what we can to take

the county-seat away from you. I'm sorry for
you, for yours is a losing fight.”
“Yet there are means you would not counte
nance even in a struggle of this kind?”

“I will have no violence. That is why I added
a line to the note which Barney brought from
Concord.”

That “line” had escaped Guy.

He took the

note from his pocket and saw penciled dimly at
the bottom the words : “See that no harm comes

to Mr. Herbert.—Betty.” He drew a deep breath.
“Then I have you to thank for my present.

safety,” said he, replacing the note in his pocket.

A Friend in Need

“Please don’t misunderstand me, Mr. Herbert,”
returned Miss Betty. “My father's ruling passion
is real estate. He wanted to sell you some lots in
Harmony, and, for fear you wouldn't be where he
could watch you, he insisted on having you come
here. That was also his reason for taking you to

the meeting and he had not the slightest notion
he was harboring an enemy.” Miss Betty laughed

again. “At heart,” she resumed, “my father is
one of the noblest men in the world, but I cannot
remember that he ever championed a losing cause.

Whenever he enters a fight he goes in to win.
With my aid he is going to be victorious in this
county-seat affair.” She spoke decisively. “I
don't know your real motive for coming here but
I presume you wanted to look over the rival town
and find out what chance there was for Concord

retaining its prestige.”
“That was partly it,” admitted Guy. “But I
also wished to attend the meeting and find out,

if I could, what move your side intended to make.”
“Col. Keever suggested that, did he not?”
“It was suggested to me.”
“And you endeavored to follow out this counsel

against your better judgment?”
“I am very sorry now that I acted on the sug

gestion at all.”
“You are too much of a gentleman for this sort
of work, Mr. Herbert. A county-seat contest of
this kind is a very disagreeable affair.”
“Why should there ever have been a contest?”

-------->

His Friend the Enemy

48

“That was because Concord stole the county
seat away from Harmony in the first place. The
vote was close and the canvassing board, bought

by Col. Keever, threw out a sufficient number of
Harmony votes to give the county-seat to Con
cord.” The blue eyes snapped and the thin nos
trils dilated. “For this reason the question has
been reopened, Mr. Herbert, and it is for this
reason, also, that I am heart and soul in the
conflict. I will have no violence, but Col. Keever

may have to be met with his own weapons in
order that right and justice may prevail. We can
be good enemies and good friends as well, and
after the election”—she smiled—“we will try to
forget the disagreeable incidents of the campaign.”
“With all my heart!” declared Guy.
She offered him her hand and he pressed the
little palm cordially.
At that moment they heard running feet along
the road by the gate, angry shouts and now and
then the report of a revolver. Betty sprang up
-

and hurried to a window.

“There's a mob in front,” she said quietly,
“but you need have no fears, Mr. Herbert. You

are just as safe under this roof as you would be in
Concord.”

Guy greatly admired her calmness but she un
derestimated his courage if she thought for a
moment that he was frightened. Before he could
reply, Squire Vlandingham hurried into the room,
coming from the rear of the house.

“I’ve got a horse at the barn, Herbert, all

saddled, bridled and waiting,” said he quickly.
“I don’t want to alarm you, but some of those
rascals out there are drunk and Barney has told

them everything. You'd better go; I might be
powerless to protect you.”

Some one jangled the bell furiously. A scuffling
of feet and muttering of hoarse voices came from
the porch.
“There they are,” said Betty. “You talk with
them at the door, father, while I show Mr. Her
bert where he can find the horse.”

Vlandingham started for the hall but paused to
reach out his hand to Guy.
“I don't believe you knew what kind of a hor
net's nest you were going to get into over here,
Herbert. You've got Betty on your side, I can
see that, and I don’t lay up any hard feelings.

I'd advise you, though, to give this burg a wide
berth in future. You see, I hold the winning
cards in this fight and can afford to be magnani
mous.”

Guy wrung Vlandingham's hand and followed
Betty outside to a post where a horse was hitched.
Untying the halter he vaulted into the saddle.

Betty directed him how to go.
“I hope I shall see you again, Miss Vlanding
ham,” he observed.

“You may see me when you least expect it,” she
answered.
“I will send the horse back to-morrow.”

“Any time that you find it convenient will be
soon enough. Remember, we are enemies on
county-seat matters.”
“And friends on all others?”

“If you wish it.”
“I do wish it. Good bye.”

She waved her hand and he sped away into the
night.

CHAPTER IV
CONCORD INVADED

Guy had a lonely ride back to Concord over the
broad, flat, star-lit lands. He could see the road
dimly, a lightish streak cutting the darker turf of

the plains. A moist, lush smell arose from the
dewy grass, and the croaking of frogs, the chirping
of crickets and the resonant boom of the bittern

floating from the sedge served only to intensify
the stillness.

There was far more to this county-seat business
than Guy had imagined. Miss Betty felt that
Harmony had been cheated out of its rights, and
that was the cause of her inexorable stand in the

present contest. Two-thirds of the voters in the
county had signed the petition for a special elec
tion and it was a foregone conclusion that these
two-thirds would vote for Harmony. Without
doubt this was the premise on which Squire Vlan
dingham and his daughter were building their
hopes. Their ground was well taken, but Guy had
information relative to Col. Keever's imported

voters.

He did not know what the voting

strength of the county was, but he was sure the

Colonel had been sharp enough to bring in suffi
5I

52

His Friend the Enemy

cient ballots to overcome the two-thirds majority.
The young man did not fancy this phase of the

question, although the entire contest was gradu
ally presenting itself to him as a case of diamond

cut diamond. He had been brought up in abhor
rence of “ways that are dark and tricks that are

vain,” but now that he was in Rome why should
he not emulate the Romans? To take any other
stand was equivalent to bankrupting himself, for
what chance would Concord have if he ordered the

Colonel's imported voters out of the town or per
mitted them to exercise the right of franchise un
influenced? If ordered away they might flock to
Harmony in a body, and if permitted to vote as

they pleased they might be subsidized by agents
of Vlandingham. The matter was a delicate one
and

to be handled with extreme caution.

The

temptation to look out for himself at all costs
was a powerful one, and had not Miss Betty her
self said that it was right for him to do all he
could to keep the county-seat at Concord? Tak

ing everything into consideration, Guy thought it
would be well to lay back on his oars, watch the
opposition and see what happened.
He had a number of thoughts concerning Miss
Betty entirely apart from the political question

and in the fairer fields where they were to esteem
each other as friends. These were headstrong
fancies and so vividly tinted with the hues of
youth that they were more properly dreams and
not to be chronicled.

Concord Invaded

53

Arrived in Concord, Guy left the horse at the
livery barn and made his way along the dark and
deserted street to the Lisbon House.

This hotel was under the proprietorship of a
Portuguese. Being unable to pronounce his name,

the people of Concord rose up and bestowed upon
him the patronymic of “Smith.” Retaining his
multitude of Christian names, his full title thus
became Pedro Fernandez José Manuel Smith.
This was, of course, altogether too long for a
pioneer community, and when Pedro Fernandez
was not plain Smith, he was Pedro, or “Cinch,”
—which was practically the same.
Almost any day Pedro might be seen sitting in
front of his establishment, wearing his white apron
and square white cap, his legs crossed, elbows on
his knee, complacently swinging his suspended foot

and puffing at a corncob pipe. It was thus that
Guy found the proprietor when he came out from
breakfast on the morning after his ride from
Harmony.

The early train from the West had just stopped
at the station as Guy took a chair on the porch
and lighted a cigar.

“Quite an excitement when the trains come in,”
Observed Pedro.

“So it seems,” returned Guy, looking at the
little throng which had gathered on the platform

and part of which was visible around the ends of
the station building.

He saw Mr. Glimmer and

Lemuel Bilkins, among others, and gave especial

54

His Friend the Enemy

attention to a slender youth whose fiery hair
curled fringingly about the edges of his old cap.
This latter individual was throwing a canvas bag

into the open door of the mail car.
“That's Sampson,” ventured Pedro, noting the
direction of Guy's gaze. “Works for the Colonel,
and is just throwing on the eastbound bundle of
this week's Blizzard. Here's a copy of it, if you'd
like to run it over. It's a mighty warm number
county-seat war is gettin' interestin’.”

Pedro pulled the paper out from under his apron
and Guy examined it lazily. There was a red-hot
leader, in the Colonel's scorching style, picking the
County Commissioners to tatters, and then hold
ing these remnants up to public contumely. The
intrinsic value of the article did not interest Guy
quite so much as something else. He brought out
the note which Squire Vlandingham had handed
him at the town meeting the night before—a scrap
which he was treasuring simply and solely because
of Miss Betty's penciled message to her father, at
the bottom of it. Turning the note over he

perused the writing on the back, as he had done
once before that morning.
The chirography was a blotted scrawl and the
ink was purple in color. Guy remembered that the
ink which the Colonel had jarred out of its stand,
on the preceding afternoon, was of that identical
hue. Yet this was not all. The writing on the
back of that note was the counterpart of a frac
tion of the leader, word for word, comma for

Concord Invaded

55

comma and exclamation point for exclamation

point. Had Guy a piece of the “copy” in his
hands? Was this a clue to the identity of the
“Broom Man” mentioned by Barney?
“Jee-mi-nee ''' broke from Pedro Smith, as he

got up from his chair. “Here come three passen
gers from the West. We don't get many from
that direction.”

Guy thrust the note back into his pocket and
looked towards the station. The train had gone
and the curious citizens were headed back towards
the business section of the town. Lemuel was

carrying the mailsacks for Mr. McQuilkin, a task
which he performed proudly and regularly for the
mere glory of it; Sampson, a little time at his
disposal now that the week's issue was out of the
way, had lighted a cigarette and was sauntering
leisurely; Mr. Glimmer had been expecting his
wife's sister from Bismarck and it cannot be said

that he wore a very disappointed look because
she had failed to arrive; Waffle was of the party,
and his shadow, Bill Comfort, and several more.
The attention of the group of citizens was

riveted upon the three arrivals who walked in
advance and headed for the hotel.

Two of these

were women, ostensibly Sisters of Charity, and
closely veiled. The third was a man, under

medium height and enveloped from head to heels
in a garment that was much too large for him.
His hat was drawn down over his forehead and

the collar of his ill-fitting coat was turned up

56

His Friend the Enemy

about his ears. The attire was exceedingly warm

for that season of the year and Sampson guyed
the stranger in frequent asides to Lem Bilkins.
The Sisters of Charity passed into the hotel,

ushered by the obsequious Pedro. The little man
in the long coat likewise entered the office and
took a seat in one corner, rigidly erect and not
deigning to unbutton his coat. The citizens
halted in front of the veranda to stare and specu

late—all save Bilkins, who was due at the post
office.

“Cracky 1” exclaimed Sampson, looking hard at
Guy. The printer started to say something more
but bit his words off short.

“What's the matter?” asked Guy, wondering at
the mystified expression of the youth's face.
“Oh, nothing,” replied Sampson, backing away.
“My dear Herbert l” cooed the familiar voice of
Col. Keever as that gentleman rounded the corner

of the hotel and advanced upon Guy precipitately.
“You look well,” added the Colonel significantly,
dropping a hand on the young man's shoulder.

Then he stooped and whispered: “How did you
come out?”

Before Guy could answer, the little man in the
ill-fitting coat plunged out on the veranda and
halted at the Colonel's side.

“Ha!” cried the little man furiously. “I have
come into the jackal's lair to pay my respects to
the jackal-in-chief. Archibald Keever, you are an
impudent scoundrel, sir! You are an ill-mannered

Then the blow fell across the Colonel's face.—Page 57.

blackguard, sir! You have not the first instincts
of a gentleman. You are a coward, do you hear

me? A coward and a knavel My hat in your
teeth, sir!”

The little man jerked off his slouch hat, revealing
two eyes, one of which gleamed glassily at Guy
while the other traveled up and down the full ex
tent of Col. Keever's anatomy; then the blow fell
across the Colonel's face.

It all came about with paralyzing suddenness.
The crowd of Concordians stared and gaped as

though under some baneful spell. The little man
was Col. Dingle, of Harmony | The next instant
Guy had leaped to his feet.
A shudder of mighty passion convulsed Col.

Keever. His hand tightened convulsively on the
head of his cane.

“Sir,” he shouted, “is it your intention to

apply to me those hurtling epithets?”
Come to think of it afterwards, there was little
use of the Colonel's question; but great minds
often wish to be absolutely certain of both horns
of a proposition before tackling the conclusion.
The little man laughed mockingly.
“I have coupled the word with a blow !” he
cried. “In order that you may satisfy yourself I
have made no mistake, I will strike again, so !

The Norther greets The Blizzard!”
Again came that swishing blow with the hat
and Col. Keever, dazed for the moment, fanned
imaginary flies from before his face.

58

His Friend the Enemy

“It's Dingle !” gasped Col. Keever, hoarsely.
“Hold me, somebody

Hold me or I shall kill him l’”

Mr. Glimmer hurled himself into the breach and

caught Keever about the waist while Pedro Smith

dashed out of the hotel and threw himself upon
Dingle. Then, struggling ineffectually to free
themselves, the two Colonels glared at each other.
“You are a sneak, sir, and a coward, sir!”
screamed the editor of The Norther.

“Hold me tight, Glimmer,” hissed the editor of

The Blizzard through his grinding teeth. “I am
not myself! Righteous wrath is making a demon
of me ! If I were to swoop down on that mis
guided man nothing would be left to tell the
tale.”

“Let him go!” cried Dingle, frantically; “I dare
you to let him go !”
“A Harmony man 1" howled the citizens, push

ing angrily forward and surrounding the diminu
tive person with the glass eye.
“He must be a spy l’’ roared a voice.
“String him up !” echoed another.
“Lynch him ! lynch him ! lynch him !” swelled
the chorus.

“Stand back!” shouted Guy, shouldering his
way to Dingle's side.
“Get a ropel” fumed the crowd. “Next to

Vlandingham he's the worst enemy this town has
got | Make an example of him '''

Guy halted in front of Dingle and kept the crush
back with his strong arms.

Concord Invaded

59

“We must get him out of here, Pedro,” said Guy
breathlessly. “If we don’t, some of these hot
heads will get us all into trouble. Where can we
take him?”

“I’ve got a room upstairs that we can lock him
in,” replied Pedro, and the people, catching the
last words, voiced the fierce demand :
“Lock him up ! Put him under lock and key
until we decide what to do with him !”

“I want to help you, Dingle,” said Guy, in the
little man's ear. “Don’t be foolish—go with us
and we'll do what we can for you.”
Dingle was sullenly defiant, but he yielded to
Guy and Pedro and accompanied them into the
hotel and up the broad stairs leading to the
second floor, the crowd pushing and plunging
after them.

Rumors of the excitement had spread to the
four quarters of the town and citizens came run

ning from every direction, adding their numbers
and their excitement to the tumultuous gathering
in the hotel.

-

“Give the man a show !” cried Christopher

Waffle, shrilly, springing upon a chair in the office.
“Don’t act like a lot of hyenas !

There's law in

this town and Waffle knows how to deal it out !”

“Down with old Waffle!” bellowed the crowd;
“let’s take the law into our own hands !”

The mob swarmed about Waffle's chair, over
turned it, and the Judge went down and was lost
in the human wave that rolled over him.

His Friend the Enemy

6o

Meantime Guy and Pedro had been doing yeo

man service in behalf of the headstrong Dingle.
The little man had been crowded into a five-by
seven linen closet off the upper hall and the door
locked on him. Guy, the key in his hand, turned
away and confronted the clamoring multitude
that struggled up the stairs.
“You are men, not brutes,” he shouted, “civil
ized

citizens and not a barbarian horde l’”

He

had used that speech, once in his callow youth,
for a school declamation and he poured forth that
much of it with all his power. It sounded well,
caught the ears of the unruly townspeople and
proved the entering wedge for a little reason.
“Look!” Guy waved the key. “We have locked
Col. Dingle in a closet and if you will appoint
someone to guard him, some one whom you can all
trust, we will proceed to debate this question and
decide, as dispassionately as we can, what shall be
done with our prisoner. Don't be like ravening
wolves”—more of the declamation—“but prove
that you are reasonable beings. Let us go down
into the office and reason together.”
“Herbert has got the right end of the stick,”
seconded Judge Waffle, lifting up his voice from

the top of the office counter. “Do as he says and
let's have a concensus of opinion.”
“That is my wish,” shouted Col. Keever from
the foot of the stairs. “Come down, fellow citi
zens, come down and we will talk the matter
Over.”

Concord Invaded

6I

To have their leader add his personal request
settled the matter, and the riotous citizens on the
stairs began to descend.

“Who shall guard the prisoner?” asked Guy.
“Mr. Pedro Smith ?”

“No !” thundered Keever, “let Sampson stand
in the hall before the door.”

Sampson pushed up the stairs with alacrity,
took the key from Guy's hand and proceeded at
once to his post. When all the others were on the
office floor a debate as to the punishment which
should be meted out to Col. Dingle was at once
begun.
A few suggested hanging in no equivocal terms;

a large number were of the opinion that tarring
and feathering was as far as they should go,
while a conservative element believed that Col.

Dingle would suffer sufficient punishment if he were
set astride a pole and ridden out of town. There
was but one point on which the agreement was
anything like being unanimous, and that was that
Dingle, before he was dealt with in any manner
whatever, should go down on his knees to Col.
Keever and implore his pardon.
Guy was against this and so was Waffle, and, of
course, Bill Comfort. Arguments pro and con
came fast and furious, and an hour passed with

out bringing the dissenting factions any closer
together than they were at first. Misunderstand

ings began to crop out and more than one harsh
word was bandied back and forth.

62

His Friend the Enemy

Just when it seemed that the wrangling citizens
would come to blows a despairing cry for help
floated down from upstairs. It was Sampson's

voice

What had happened? In a flash every

voice was hushed and the crowd caught its breath.
Then came the slamming of a door, followed by a
crashing sound and a hollow groan.
Guy led the rush for the second story and
found, when he reached the top of the stairs, that
the closet door was ajar, the prisoner gone and
Sampson lying in a huddled heap on the floor
without sound or movement.
The astounded citizens looked from one to an

other, and, as they looked, the swift fall of a
horse's hoofs echoed up from the street, accom
panied by a shrill and triumphant yell. With one
accord the crowd flocked

to the windows and

caught a fleeting glimpse of Col. Dingle careering
madly in the direction of Harmony. He was
mounted on the horse which Guy had ridden the

night before, and was waving over his head the
weather-vane that had been recently affixed to the
roof of the new court-house.

CHAPTER V

THE “SISTERS OF CHARITY”

The citizens of Concord were stupefied. That
weather-vane was a symbol of their defiance of the
other town, and to have the hated Dingle come
brazenly among them, insult their leader in a

peculiarly irritating manner, escape mysteriously
while they were wrangling over the method of his
punishment, and flee with that grotesque gal

vanized iron figure waving over his head was
enough to paralyze the most rabid partisan.
Christopher Waffle was a Concord man to the
marrow of his bones; but he had no love for Col.

Keever—possibly because the Colonel had once
overcharged him for a threshing “ad.”

Nor had

Waffle admired the Colonel's handiwork as exem

plified in the weather-vane. The Judge had said
that it was coarse and brutally insolent, and that
something would happen on account of it for
which they would all be sorry. In the present
crisis the Judge was first to find his voice and he
cried, in tones vibrant with a certain kind of
triumph :
“I told you so !”
63

64

His Friend the Enemy

“That's what Waff said all along,” supple
mented Bill Comfort.

The swarm turned upon the Judge wrathfully,
and Col. Keever shouted :

“And do you, sir, do you mean to champion the
cause of this contemptible sneak from the other
side of the county?”
“No, never ! But Dingle has done this town a
service by making off with that monstrosity.”
“What?” gasped the crowd, glaring at Waffle.
Bill Comfort planted himself at the Judge's side

and defiantly reiterated the Judge's statement.
Col. Keever was red and wrathful.

A clash was

impending and Guy pushed his way between the
opposing factions.

-

“Enough of this !” said he. “We have a power
ful enemy in Vlandingham and we cannot hope to
win unless we present an undivided front.

Instead

of contending among ourselves, suppose we inquire
into the method of Col. Dingle's escape? And

Sampson—we are forgetting about him. He may
be severely hurt.”
This was sufficient to turn the attention of the

crowd into another channel and Guy led the back
ward movement along the hall to the spot where

the unfortunate printer was lying.
Sampson had not moved a hair's breadth. He
was flat on his back, his arms and legs sprawled

out and his eyes closed. There were no visible
marks of injury upon his face and Guy dropped
down on one knee and lifted his head.

The “Sisters of Charity”

65

As he did this, Guy saw a section of glittering
gold chain on the floor under the printer and he

dropped one hand over it and concealed it in his
palm. No one else had glimpsed the bit of jewelry,
and Guy's heart was in his throat the instant his
eyes fell on it. At a favorable moment he trans
ferred the chain to his pocket and continued his
examination of Sampson.

-

“Stand back l” commanded the Colonel.

him air !

Get some water, somebody

“Give

Gentle

men, gentlemen, that boy has been the trial of my
life, but if he has been sacrificed by the venomous
Dingle, I'll call the murderer out, by gad! I'll

face him with a six-shooter and, my word for it,
he’ll be carried from the field.”

That awful threat silenced the bystanders and
forced them back, but Guy saw Waffle nudge his
engineer and whisper something that made them
both grin sarcastically.

“You’ll not have to call Dingle out, Colonel,”
said Guy. “Sampson's pulse is normal, his heart
strong, and I can’t find a wound on him.”

Pedro arrived, just then, with a glass of ice
water.

In his excitement he dashed the whole of

it in the printer's face. The effect was instantane
ous and Sampson sat up, rolling his eyes and
spluttering.
“Who did that?” were his first words.

“Sampson,” said the Colonel, tenderly, “do you
know me? Look, boy!”
“’Course I know you! Who hit me with that
5

66

His Friend the Enemy

bucket of water, that's what I want to find out.
Nice way to treat a man when he's down ''”
Sampson got up energetically and looked about
him with indignant eyes.
“There, there, Samp,” said the Colonel, sooth
ingly. “You were knocked down by that brute of
a Dingle. Don't you remember?”
“Oh, yes,” returned Sampson, peering at the
open door of the closet and rubbing his forehead
in a bewildered way. “Did he escape?”
“I should say he did, Sampson. How did it

happen? Tell us about it.”
“Well,” replied Sampson, “I heard him hunting
around in that closet and I opened the door to
see what he was up to. After that there's a blank
kind of mixed up with shooting stars, comets, and
other bright things.”

“Where did he hit you?” inquired Guy.
“Give it up.”
That is exactly what Guy did.

Either the

printer had had a timely attack of heart failure
or else he was shamming.
“What's this?” asked Comfort, who had wan
dered into the closet and was now standing with
his eyes fixed on the door. The next moment he
stepped backinto the hall, pulled the door shut and
all could see that there was a letter fastened to one

of the panels with a pin. The crowd surged for
ward eagerly.
“‘For that arch-conspirator, Keever, with the
compliments of Col. Dingle !’” read Mr. Glimmer,

The “Sisters of Charity”

67

as he jerked the note from the door and handed
it to the Colonel.

“Read it, Colonel,” chorused the crowd, palpi
tating with curiosity.
The Colonel tore off the end of the envelope and
drew out the enclosed sheet. His eyes flashed fire
as he swept them over the few lines the note con
tained, his face became convulsed with passion
and his breast shook with his labored breathing.
“Read it, read it !” clamored the bystanders.
“No !”

roared

the Colonel.

“This is for me

alone, for me. I have borne with this contempt
ible cur beyond endurance. The villain
The ras
cal !

Let him look to himself now if he can.”

The Colonel spun about on his heel and made
off ragefully as fast as he was able. Sampson
shot after him and then the crowd disintegrated
by twos and threes and drifted in the direction of

the post-office, discussing the exciting events of
the morning and asking each other what that
note could possibly have contained to set the

Colonel off at such a tangent.
A favorable moment presenting itself, Guy
drew Pedro into the parlor on the second floor.
“Those two Sisters of Charity are staying in

this hotel, aren’t they, Mr. Smith?” asked the
young man.

“Yes,” replied Pedro.

“Where did they come from? Do you know?”
“I don’t know a thing about them. They

haven’t spoken half a dozen words to me.”

68

His Friend the Enemy

“Have you made any guess as to what they are
here for?”

“Some charity or other, I suppose.”
“Please ask them to come to this parlor. Tell
them that a gentleman who is charitably disposed
would like a short interview with them.”

Pedro's eyes opened wide as he went away to
carry out Guy's request. Presently there was a
rustle of garments along the hall and the two
ladies, still deeply veiled, entered the parlor. Guy
bowed. They acknowledged the greeting with a
slight courtesy. Pedro was standing in the door.
“I will join you in the office in a few moments,

Mr. Smith,” said Guy significantly, and Pedro
went away disappointedly.

The young man waited until he heard the proprie
tor's footsteps descend the length of the stairs and
then he advanced to one of the ladies and handed
her the chain which he had found a short time before.

“You must have the clasp repaired, Miss Vlan
dingham,” he said in a low tone.
Both ladies started back instinctively; and then
a low laugh came from Miss Betty as she switched

her veil aside and revealed her smiling face.
“You are very kind, Mr. Herbert,” said she,
taking the bracelet. She turned to her companion.
“Lois, this is the gentleman of whom I was telling

you. We are discovered, you see, in spite of all
our precautions, and that proves that the best

laid plans of mice and maids gang aft agley.
Mr. Herbert, Miss Pinkney.”

The “Sisters of Charity”

69

Miss Pinkney was reassured by her companion's
confident manner and likewise dropped her veil.
She was a darkly beautiful girl and, although she

seemed a trifle frightened, her gaze was steady and
her lips were rigidly firm. She bowed formally.
“Miss Pinkney,” resumed Miss Betty, “is a very
dear friend of mine, and quite as determined to
assist in winning the county-seat as I am.”
“You have both been very reckless,” said Guy,

gravely. “The citizens of Concord are exceedingly
wrought up over the events of the morning, and
I tremble to think of your position if you chanced
to be discovered.”

“We shall not be discovered,” answered Miss

Betty pertly. “That is, not unless you see fit to
reveal our identity.”
“You know I would not do that,” retorted Guy
indignantly.
“But we are here in the interests of Harmony,
you know.”
“I have no doubt of it.”

“It would be to your interest to have us appre
hended and—and made prisoners.”

Miss Lois paled and flashed a startled glance at
her companion.
“I would rather have Concord lose the county
seat,” said Guy.

Miss Betty fixed her melting blue eyes upon him
for a space.

“Concord will be ruined when Harmony gets
the county-seat,” she went on.

“I suppose, how

7o

His Friend the Enemy

ever, that you are very wealthy, and would con
sider as a mere bagatelle the depreciation in
value of a thousand or more lots.”

Guy started to tell her that he had hardly a
dollar that he could call his own, outside of the
town, but he bit his lip and kept the words back.

“Miss Vlandingham,” he said instead, “you and
Miss Pinkney must return at once to

mony.

Har

I will get a conveyance and drive you

back.”

“Not for worlds would I allow you to do that !
If the Concord people ever found out what you
had done they would turn against you.”
“I’ll chance it.”

“Perhaps you would, but we won't.” Miss Betty
tossed her head.

Guy was desperate.

“Really, Miss Vlandingham,” he said earnestly,
“I must insist that you let me drive you back to
Harmony.”

“Really '' exclaimed Miss Betty, laughing at
him with her eyes. “Well, sir, we insist on staying
here until we accomplish the work that brought
us. You will not deport us against our will?”

“You are a pair of madcaps 1” averred Guy
helplessly. “If you came over here to assist
Col. Dingle—”
“We did not come for that,” she interrupted
hastily. “I am sorry you have such a poor

opinion of us as to think we would bear a hand
in such a matter.

Had I been informed of Col.

The “Sisters of Charity”

71

Dingle's purpose he would never have come here
this morning.”
“Yet I found your bracelet close to the room
from which Col. Dingle escaped.”
“We are quartered across the hall. After Col.
Dingle got into such a predicament we could do no

less than help him out of it. While you and your
fellow townsmen were wrangling in the office, I
left by a rear stairway and a rear door and had
the liveryman saddle and make ready the horse
you rode over from Harmony last night. The
animal was hitched near the building you propose
to use for a court-house. When Col. Dingle es
caped from the room the coast was comparatively
clear, as nearly all the citizens were at the hotel.
For that reason he had no difficulty in getting
away. In my haste I lost my bracelet and did
not discover that it was gone until the angry
mob came flocking up the stairs. Then, of course,
it was too late to recover it. I am very much
obliged to you, Mr. Herbert, for proceeding so
secretly in the matter. You had seen that bracelet

before and you knew who the owner of it must
be, so you had only to raise your voice and
direct the whole pack against us. , We're grateful,
aren’t we, Lois?”

“Very,” said Miss Pinkney in a constrained
voice.

-

“You are under no obligation to me,” returned

Guy. “The account is more than balanced by
your kindness of last night, Miss Vlandingham.”

72

His Friend the Enemy

At this juncture Guy heard some one coming up
the stairs three steps at a time.
“Quick!” he murmured; “replace your veils.”
Miss Pinkney's hands trembled as she once more

folded the gray covering across her face. But
there was no trace of alarm in the actions of Miss

Betty. She was as cool and self-possessed as
though presiding at some social function in her
own town of Harmony.
Barely were the fair faces covered when Samp
son burst into the parlor. He stopped short on

beholding the ladies and evinced some confusion.
“What do you want, Sampson?” asked Guy.
“The Colonel wants to see you, Mr. Herbert,

and in a tearing hurry.”
Guy turned to give a parting salute to the
ladies, but Miss Betty extended her hand. As he
took the little palm in his she whispered:

“As a friend, I thank you from the bottom of
my heart, Mr. Herbert; but as an enemy—I defy
you ! Do not be too sentimental nor over-chival
rous.

Remember that I am here in the interests

of Harmony, and that it is your duty to look out
for Concord.”

With that she turned away and Guy followed
Sampson out of the room.

CHAPTER VI
COL. KEEVER'S “FLASH IN THE PAN”

Col. Keever was tremendously wrought up. He
was pacing the restricted limits of his office and
tossing his arms and talking to himself, so wrath
fully oblivious of his surroundings that he did not

notice the entrance of Guy and Sampson for
several moments.

Occasionally the Colonel would halt, glower at a
copy hook fastened to the wall, shake his fist at
it and address it by such terms as “infernal
scoundrel,” “contemptible cur,” and so on. Fi
nally he jerked the hook from the wall, cast it on
the floor and set his heel on the sheets that were

strung upon it.
“Great guns, Colonel,” cried Sampson, “you're
spoilin’ about a dozen stickfuls of copy.”
“Oh, is it you, Sampson?” said the Colonel,
whirling. “Mr. Herbert, I want a word with you,
sir.” He picked up the hook with its attached
sheets and handed it to the printer. “Go out and
get to work on that,” he said shortly. Sampson
vanished into the workroom forthwith.

“How

long have you been in this office, Mr. Herbert?”
asked the Colonel.
73

74

His Friend the Enemy
**

“About two minutes,” replied Guy.
“Then you witnessed my ebullition of wrath,
sir, and I beg your pardon. Ah, but I have a

devil of a temper ! I would fight at the drop of a
hat—possibly, sir, I would jar the hand that held
the hat. It's my Southern breeding, I suppose;
my Southern breeding, backed by long years of
slaughter in our late war. I am trying to out
grow my temper, but success comes very slowly.
Some ancient philosopher said that every man has

a wolf imprisoned in his breast. I believe that,
Herbert, and I am trying to strangle my own
particular wolf. It was the wolf that hurled
scorching words at that copy hook and tore it
from the wall, sir; not Keever—no, no, not Keever.

But—” and the Colonel brought his right fist
down in his left palm—“the wolf is going to have

the upper hand until I square accounts with this
man Dingle.”
“I wouldn’t do anything rash, Colonel,” ven
tured Guy.
“Rash? Gad ' What would you do if a man

struck you twice across

the face with

his

hat?”

“Knock him down,” said Guy promptly.

“Pre-cisely, and that's what any man with an
ordinary temper would do. But that would only
be a half-way measure with me. I presume you
noticed that I did not knock Dingle down?”
“I did,” was the dry response.

“I restrained myself, held myself in check, in

Col. Keever’s “Flash in the Pan” 75
order that I might take a more terrible vengeance.
Herbert, I am going to have Dingle's life l’”
“You certainly are not—”
“There, there ! Don't try to argue with me, for
it is useless, utterly useless. I have made up my
mind. Let me assure you that I am no stranger
to the field of honor. At one time, sir, the code
duello was my vade mecum. I counted that day
lost, Herbert, which passed without my calling
some one out.”

The Colonel pulled the brim of his white “top”
hat firmly down over his brow. In his estimation

a stiff white hat was the acme of gentility, the
crown and symbol of a gentleman. A stiff white
hat, moreover, throws about its wearer a political
glamour, which was something not to be ignored
by the editor of that justly celebrated sheet The

Concord Blizzard. The Colonel not only pulled
down the brim of his hat, but he buttoned the
two lower buttons of his frock coat across his

capacious stomach, rested one elbow on the top
of his desk and swung his cane-swung it slowly ,
and relentlessly. His manner plainly stating that
threats, prayers and entreaties would alike be
powerless to swerve him, Guy thought best not to
make another attempt.

In a little while the Colonel ceased swinging his
cane long enough to indicate with the point of it
a letter which lay open on the top of his desk.

“Read that, Herbert,” he said; “by gad, you
read that.”

76

His Friend the Enemy

Guy cast his eyes down and read the following:
“Archibald Keever, Colonel so-called.
“Sir : I have been appointed a committee of one
to rid this Territory of your baneful presence.
You have cumbered the earth too long and I shall
be pleased to offer you a proof of my distinguished
regard with a six-shooter at twenty paces, time
and place to be designated by you. My only
stipulation is that the place selected be equi
distant from Concord and Harmony. Reply by
post. If you do not meet me, I shall make it my
pleasant duty publicly to chastise you and de
nounce you as the arrant braggart that you are.
“ISAAC DINGLE.”

“That certainly has a business-like sound,”
commented Guy.
The Colonel laughed tragically.
“‘Colonel so-called'!” he sneered. “By gad, I
didn't have to move West, like Dingle, to get a

title. I won it on the field of battle, sir, spilling.
my blood for my country. He asks for an affec
tionate exchange of powder and ball and I shall give
him a heartfelt token of my esteem at the distance

specified. Herbert, I want you for my second.”
Guy shook his head. The cane stopped swinging
with a jerk and a hard, hard look came into the
Colonel's eyes.
-

“Do I understand you to say, sir, that you will
not accommodate me?”

“I don’t believe in duels, Colonel.

Nature has

endowed every gentleman with a pair of fists. If

Col. Keever's “Flash in the Pan” 77
these weapons are powerless to protect his honor,
his honor is hardly worth bothering about.”
The pith of this remark escaped the Colonel
entirely.
“I am not only protecting my own honor, Her
bert,” he said coldly, “but the honor of our
town, as well. Your 1,200 lots share in the gen

eral ignominy and it is your duty to stand by me
in this little affair. Do I still understand you to
say that you won’t?”

“You do. I want a fair and square fight for the
county-seat and I don’t approve of any coarse or
gratuitous flings like that of the weather-vane.
Claptrap of that kind merely intensifies the hos
tile feeling which is already too bitter and venge
ful. It is only a step from our present situation
to warfare and bloodshed. I was in grave peril,
last night—”
“I was going to ask you about that,” broke in

.the Colonel, curiosity for the moment overcoming
his resentment. “You succeeded in getting in?”
“Yes; and I succeeded in getting out again and

saving myself a rough experience only through
the magnanimity of Squire Vlandingham.”
“Vlandingham is a knave, sir!”

“Squire Vlandingham is a gentleman, Col.
Keever !”
“He couldn’t come of the stock he does and be

a gentleman.”

“Rot!” exclaimed Guy disgustedly.
“We won’t quarrel, Herbert; it won’t do for us

to quarrel.

Did you discover anything at the

“Nothing of any consequence.”
At that moment the office door opened and a
man who looked like a day laborer came into the
room. He had a shifty eye, an unrazored face,
and

wore a

red

and sweat-stained

shirt.

His

hands were big and seamed with toil.
“Who are you, sir?” demanded the Colonel.

“My name's Hepburn,” replied the man, rolling
his eyes from the Colonel to Guy, and then about

the room. “Up to yesterday I was workin' on the
section at Harmony. But I got fired yesterday
mornin’.”

“Ah, ha!” returned the Colonel, blinking. Here
was a deserter from the enemy, a man with a

grievance. “What do you want, Mr. Hepburn?”
“I suppose I can talk before him all right?”
answered Hepburn, nodding his head in Guy's
direction. “He was the chap that got out of
Harmony last night by the skin of his teeth.”
“Certainly you can talk before him,” said the
Colonel.

“Is there any one else to hear us?” Hepburn's
gaze continued to travel around the sanctum, and
his face became anxious.
9y

“There’s no one else to hear us,” answered the
Colonel impatiently. “Proceed, sir; proceed.”
“Well, then, I want to sell some information.”

“What is it about?” queried the Colonel,
warily.

Col. Keever’s “Flash in the Pan” 79
“About Harmony.”
“What is it worth P”

“It's worth hundreds to you, mebby thousands,
and mebby it means the county-seat—I don’t
know. I want $20 for the information. Got to

have money to get to Jimtown. Ain't never
goin' back to Harmony no more.”
The Colonel laid his cane on the top of his desk,
removed his hat and placed it carefully beside the
cane and then began to rub his hands.
“What do you say?” asked Hepburn.

The Colonel looked toward Guy as though ex
pecting him to foot the bill.
“I say no,” said Guy. “I don’t want your

information, Mr. Hepburn, and decline to hand
over the price of your treachery.”
Hepburn appeared startled and the Colonel's

jaw dropped spasmodically.
“Are you mad?” spluttered Keever. “Let me
tell you, sir, that if you try to run this county

seat fight according to any Sunday-school notions
we'll be beaten hands down.”

“All right,” returned Guy cheerfully.

“It’s not all right, sir,” cried the Colonel.
“You with your 1,200 lots are not the only man
interested.

There are others.

In

behalf of the

others”—he drew a bill from his pocket and

handed it to Hepburn—“I shall pay Mr. Hepburn
the price of his treachery, if you please.”
“Then look to it that the money doesn’t come

out of the Townsite fund,” warned Guy.

8o

His Friend the Enemy

Col. Keever held his head very high and refused
to take any notice of these words.
“Go on,” said he to Hepburn.

“Well,” said Hepburn, casting a nervous glance
at Guy, “one of Vlandingham's hired men is a
friend of mine, and he told me what I am goin' to
tell you. Cap'n Blue has formed a company of

twenty men, which he calls the Harmony Invinci
bles. They're drillin' nearly all the time.”
“Is that all ?”

“That's only half. The other half is the biggest
part of the news. There are two spies in this
town. They are at the hotel now disguised as
Sisters of Charity. One of them is Vlandingham's

daughter an' t'other one is a Miss Pinkney.”
A cold chill swept along Guy's nerves. Had he
known what was coming he would have reached
out and choked the section man into silence. The
Colonel let off a roar of delight and grabbed up
his hat and cane.

“Are you done, Hepburn?” he cried.
“Ain’t that enough?” asked the informer wick

edly, his hand on the door-knob.
“It’ll do, it'll do. Mind you keep this to your
self, man.”

“They'd hang me if I ever went back to Har
mony and they found it out.”

Hepburn departed and the Colonel turned to Guy.
“Young man,” said he severely, “your notions
of right and wrong are exaggerated and out of
place. But for me those two items of information

Col. Keever’s “Flash in the Pan”

8I

would never have been delivered. Vlandingham's
daughter here at our mercy! Gad, think of
that l”

The Colonel started for the door and Guy
stepped quickly in front of him.
“What do you intend to do about it?” asked
Guy quietly.

“Do?” blustered the Colonel. “Why, I'm going
to have Pettibone, the sheriff, arrest 'em both.
We'll hold 'em as hostages. Vlandingham will

have to bargain with us for their release, by gad!
We'll make it cost him the county-seat.”
“You’ll do nothing of the kind,” said Guy, a

glint of steel coming into his eyes.
“What's this?” cried the Colonel. “By the
eternal ! it looks as though you are playing into
the hands of the enemy and that we have three
traitors in camp instead of two.”

“It's immaterial how it looks to you. I will
deal with these ladies at the hotel.”

“No, by gad! Stand aside Stand aside, I
say, or I'll brain you!”
The Colonel caught his cane by the lower end
and flourished the heavy handle above Guy's
head. Quick as a flash the young man caught the
stick, jerked it from the Colonel's grasp and flung

it into a corner; then he grabbed the Colonel by
both shoulders and pinned him against the par
tition.

“Attempt to arrest those young ladies, or say
a word about their being in this town,” he mut
6

82

His Friend the Enemy

tered fiercely, “and I'll see that you have cause to

regret it. I'll take care of them.”
After giving the Colonel a final bump against
the partition, Guy released him and dashed from
the office.

CHAPTER VII
A NARROW ESCAPE

It was about 11 o'clock when Guy left the
Colonel's office. He did not go to the hotel im

mediately, but hastened first across the street to
the livery stable. A big, strapping fellow came
out and advanced toward him from the shadowy
regions between the stalls. Guy was surprised, for
in spite of the big fellow's turned-up coat collar
and continued attempts to keep his face averted,
he recognized him as Barney.
Guy had not much time to waste in useless ex

pressions of astonishment or in any other ex
tended chain of thought. He immediately con
nected Barney with that note of which he had
been the bearer, and which was written on the
back of a sheet of newspaper “copy.” The next
instant he recalled Vlandingham's words about

Barney's inability to read writing. If this were
true, Barney certainly could not have been the
author of the note. Possibly there were four spies
in camp instead of two. Was the fourth man
Sampson?
-

“Well, Barney,” said Guy cynically, “we meet
again.”
83

84

His Friend the Enemy

“You’ve got the best o' me,” answered Barney,
staring blankly at Guy.

“Don’t try to play the innocent,” went on Guy,
drawing closer to the stableman and speaking in
a low and hurried tone. “I know you're a Har
mony man, but I give you my word that I won't
say anything about it providing you stop your
spying operations from this time on. Just now I
want you to help me. Miss Vlandingham and
Miss Pinkney are here in town disguised as Sisters

of Charity. Col. Keever has found it out and I
want to get them started back to Harmony before
any harm befalls them. Put your best team to a
double-seated carriage in the shortest possible
order and drive to the hotel.”

Without another word Guy left the stable and
hastened to the hotel office. As he passed the
Emporium he caught a glimpse of Col. Keever
standing inside in close and animated con
versation with Mr. Glimmer and several others.

The young man had little doubt that Keever
was retailing the information obtained from
Hepburn.

There was not an instant to be lost

if Miss Vlandingham and Miss Pinkney were
to be saved from the consequences of their rash
116SS.

On reaching the hotel Guy found the office
empty, but quickly discovered the proprietor
smoking his pipe on the veranda.
“I must have a word with those Sisters of

Charity at once, Mr. Smith,” said Guy.

A Narrow Escape

85

Pedro took his pipe out of his mouth and stared

at Guy wonderingly.
“It isn’t possible, Mr. Herbert,” said he.

“Why not? Quick, I'm in a tearing hurry.”
“They're not here, that's why.

They went out

half an hour since.”

“Where did they go?”
“Can't tell you.”

Guy ran out through the rear of the building.
He was about to wheel sharply into the main

street when he saw an excited throng making in
that direction, the Colonel at their head. Facing
about, he hurried along under the shelter of a
barn and some sheds, thereby avoiding the crowd,
which was just entering the hotel as he came out
on the street again.

What could he do? He was perplexed and had
an uncomfortable feeling of helplessness. Sud

denly he saw Barney drive a team and carriage
out of the barn.

The vehicle was a covered sur

on the front seat.

ladies?

But where are the

What has become of them?”

As he asked himself this question he saw Barney
draw his mettlesome horses down to a slower

pace, swerve sharply to the right and come to an
abrupt halt in front of the new court-house.

86

His Friend the Enemy

-

There were no workmen engaged on the building,
the force employed there having been sent into the

country to assist in repairing some roads. Rais
ing his whip, Barney motioned with it and Guy
was quickly at his side.

“They're in there,” said Barney, nodding his
head towards the court-house.

Guy stepped into the building. Miss Pinkney,
white as death, was leaning against one of the
unfinished walls. At sight of Guy an expression of

horror crossed her face. Miss Betty was standing
a little distance away, jotting something down in
a notebook. A tape line was looped over the

gloved fingers of her left hand.
“Told of us, did you?” she observed icily,
without looking up.
Guy went hot and cold in a breath.
“Told of you?” he echoed.
“Yes,” said Miss Betty, still writing. “Some of

your worthy townspeople are in pursuit of us.
They came out of a store down the street and
bolted past, shouting all sorts of direful threats

against ‘old Vlandingham's daughter.” I am al
most sorry I helped you out of your dilemma last

night, Mr. Herbert. But for my meddling you
would not have been here to betray our identity.”
She closed the notebook with a curt little snap,
laid the pencil on its cover and wrapped the tape
line around and around. “I do not care for my
self particularly, as I know your fellow-citizens

would not dare to do anything very desperate.

A Narrow Escape

87

But Miss Pinkney is not made of such stern stuff
as I am. It was very unkind and ungrateful of
you, Mr. Herbert.”

Guy's face had become almost as white as Miss
Pinkney's.
“Do you think for a moment,” he gasped, “that
I would do such a dastardly thing?”
“Who else could have done it?”

She looked at

him hopefully, asking with her eyes as plainly as
eyes could ask anything that he lift himself from
the depth to which he had fallen in her estimation.
She seemed to have no regard for the peril of
her position, appearing to desire only an explana
tion and half fearing he could not give it.
“It was done by some one else,” said Guy, in
desperate earnest. “Take my word for it. An
explanation would consume too much time and
endanger your chances of escape. I have had that

carriage made ready for you.

Please get into it

at once without a moment's delay. As soon as

those men find you are not at the hotel they will
go elsewhere to look for you.”

“Who is the driver of the carriage?” asked Miss
Betty, able to see only one side of the vehicle
through the narrow door.
“Barney,” said Guy; “a man whom you can
trust implicitly.”

“Lois,” said Miss Betty, “get into the carriage.
I think we are mistaken about Mr. Herbert.
Anyway, I shall stay here long enough to make
sure.”

88

His Friend the Enemy

Miss Pinkney left hurriedly and Miss Betty
again turned to Guy.
“It is too bad that the high opinions we some
times form of people on first acquaintance should

be overthrown,” said she, “and I was very much
disappointed when forced to the conclusion that

you had told of our presence here. Now tell me
truly, Mr. Herbert, is not this a little plan of
yours to get us to leave Concord without ac
complishing the work that brought us here?”
“Great heavens, no !” cried Guy.
“It would have been a very clever plan,” she
went on demurely. “Have a carriage ready, you
know, tell the populace, send them rushing away
on a wrong scent and thus make us glad of the
opportunity to avail ourselves of the carriage
which we refused this morning. As a ruse it would
have been almost-Napoleonic.”

“Don’t wait any longer,” implored Guy. “I
fancy I can hear your pursuers coming.”
She bent her head listeningly.
“No, not yet,” she answered lightly. “Who was
it told of us?”

“A man who will never again go back to Har
mony. His name was Hepburn and he worked on
the railroad in your town, but was discharged

yesterday. I refused to purchase his information,
but Col. Keever paid for it and I heard what he

had to say. I have done what I could for you,
Miss Vlandingham—”
“I know it, Mr. Herbert, and in order that your

A Narrow Escape

89

work may not have been done in vain, I am go
ing. I have performed the mission that brought
me here, so look out for a master stroke on the
part of Harmony.”
She flashed a bright smile at him and was out
of the building and into the carriage before he
could reach her side and give her any assistance.
Barney used his whip and just as his team started
along the street towards the railroad track Col.
Keever and his followers broke from the hotel and
raced back in the direction of The Blizzard office.

Guy halted stock still and held his breath. The
carriage was upon the men and almost past them
before any attention was paid to it. It was the
Colonel's fortune to catch first sight of the ladies,
who were leaning back on the rear seat in the
shelter of the side curtains.

“There they are !” cried Keever.
team |

“Stop that

Catch the horses’ heads !”

But Barney plied the lash vigorously, and before
the Colonel's companions were able to act on his
warning the carriage was beyond them all and
whirling its passengers rapidly away.
The road to Harmony led past the depot,
across the railroad tracks and then bore off to the
left.

With a fresh team and a good start there is no
doubt that Barney would have distanced his pur
suers had not the road been unexpectedly blocked.

The noon train suddenly drew up to the depot
platform. It was a long train and so completely

9o

His Friend the Enemy

obstructed the way that there was no getting
around it without turning squarely about and
retracing the street for a full block. Such a move
would have been disastrous, for the pursuers were
not more than a hundred yards behind. A yell of
triumph went up from the throats of Col. Keever
and his men.

Guy started at a run for the scene. Before he
came anywhere near the carriage, however, he saw
Miss Vlandingham and Miss Pinkney descend from
it and hurry to the train. A brakeman helped

them up the steps of the nearest car, signalled
“go ahead” to the conductor, and the latter gave
the word to the engineer.
But already Col. Keever, panting like a por

poise, had clutched the iron hand-rail. Close be
hind him was Dick Pettibone, the sheriff.
“Hold this train l’’ bellowed the Colonel.

“Get off, there !” shouted Barney, pressing the
lines between his knees and flinging the shotgun
to his shoulder. “Drop off that train, Col. Keever,
Or I'll ShOOt!”

The train had begun to move.

Pettibone had

not been able to get aboard, but the Colonel had,
and was standing on the lower step.

He looked around at Barney's command, and
the sight of the gun staggered him.
“Don’t shoot, don’t shoot!” he cried frantically,

and sprang to the ground, lost his footing, fell
flat and rolled over and over in the dust of the
road.

THE KEY TO THE SITUATION

Guy had come up with the baffled crowd just in
time to witness the Colonel's discomfiture.

He

experienced a sense of great relief at the escape of
Miss Betty and her friend, and kept himself as
much in the background as possible when the
irate citizens rushed forward and assisted Petti

bone to set their leader upright and dust him off.

“I’ll have the law on you, sir!” raged the
Colonel, breaking through the crowd that sur
rounded him and shaking his fist at Barney.
“Threaten me, hey? Egad, it makes my blood

“Don’t get excited, Colonel,” shouted Barney
from the carriage.

“Excited, you impudent puppy! Excited ! Pet
tibone, arrest that man. I'm surprised that you
stand there without raising a finger against the
young scalawag.”

The town had only one fault to find with Dick
Pettibone, and that was that he was too easy

going, too good natured. There were Spartan
fibres running through his make-up, but they were
in evidence only on extreme occasions.
“Oh, I wouldn't make him any trouble, Col

onel,” returned Pettibone, soothingly. “He’s
young, you know, and all young men are more or
less headstrong.”

.

“He’s a traitor !'' fumed the Colonel.

“If it

hadn't been for him Vlandingham's daughter
wouldn't have slipped through our fingers.”
“I think she would, Colonel.”
“No, sir!” raved the Colonel. “Arrest that
young rapscallion or I'll chastise him here and
now.”

-

The Colonel began to roll up his coat sleeves,

and Barney, coolly eyeing him, made a wry grim
ace. Laying the shotgun down on the seat,
Barney attempted to turn the carriage and drive
off. By this time, however, the Colonel's words
had had an effect on his followers and two of

them caught the horses' heads. Pettibone, seeing
that there was nothing for him to do but to act

in his official capacity, ordered Barney to get down.
Barney obeyed without any show of resistance
and Pettibone marched off with him, while Mr.
Glimmer took the team and carriage back to the
livery stable.
During all this time Guy had been overlooked.

He remained in the vicinity long enough to note
the outcome of the exciting little drama and then
slipped quietly away to the hotel.

He was there an hour later, deeply engaged in a
St. Paul paper, when a nervous little gentleman,
wearing a pair of nose glasses, was led up to him

by Pedro Smith.

The Key to the Situation

93

“Mr. Herbert,” said Pedro, “Mr. Pinchbeck.
Mr. Pinchbeck has recently interested himself in

our little city and he wishes to talk with you
concerning the outlook.”
Guy shook hands with Mr. Pinchbeck, and the

latter seated himself at the young man's side
while Pedro drifted away towards the kitchen.

“I understand that you own nearly all the
vacant lots in this town, Mr. Herbert,” observed

Mr. Pinchbeck, catching his glasses as they
dropped from his nose.
Guy nodded.
“Have you bought here recently?” he asked.
“Quite recently.”
“Very much?”
“A
block—conditionally.”
Mr. Pinchbeck

caught his glasses again, fitted them carefully to
the bridge of his nose and wrinkled his brows a

time or two to satisfy himself that they would
hold. “I am to pay $3,000 for the block, provid
ing this town wins the county-seat fight.”
“Ah, I see. Your money is to be paid back if
we lose?”

“Well-er-it hasn’t really been paid over, as yet.
I have merely a contract for a deed. It's this
way, Mr. Herbert. When the ballots are counted

if they show a good safe majority for Concord I
am to pay $2,000 to the workmen who have been
brought here to build roads, bridges, etc., and I
am also to pay $1,000 for that wooden shell

which is ultimately to be the court-house.”

94

His Friend the Enemy

This was a revelation to Guy.

Here was the

“tenderfoot” about whom the Colonel had told

him. The Colonel, however, had said nothing of
a conditional bargain.
“In case we lose the county-seat, Mr. Pinch
beck,” said Guy, “what would happen?”
Mr.

Pinchbeck smiled.

The

mirthful wrinkles

disconnected his glasses and they evaded his hand
and dropped into his lap. The smile faded into a
look of vexation as he picked up the glasses and
jammed them back on the bridge of his nose.
“That's all right, Mr. Herbert. I have a con
tract with Vlandingham for a block at the same

figure in case his town wins.”
Guy was startled.
“Has Mr. Vlandingham also imported some
voters?” he asked.

“Um—I don’t know as I ought to say so, but
he has run in a lot of fellows from Bismarck

the same number that Keever has brought in
from Jimtown. They're working somewhere
around Harmony, and will be in evidence on elec
tion day.”

“In c se Harmony wins you are going to pay
Vlandingham's workmen. Is that it?”
“That'S it.”

“Col. Keever said you were a tenderfoot, Mr.

Pinchbeck, but you certainly do not act like one.
No matter from which direction the breeze comes,

you have an anchor to windward.”

“It's just plain business, that's all,” returned

The Key to the Situation

95

Mr. Pinchbeck, dashing his hand to his face barely
in time to keep his glasses there.

“Is Squire Vlandingham also building a court
house?”

“N—no. I drove over from Harmony this
morning and saw Vlandingham before I started.
He's got something up his sleeve. I hardly know
what, though. He told me that fools build court
houses and wise men occupy them. I don’t know
as I ought to tell you this, being a non-com
batant, as you might say, but I guess it won’t
do any harm. Vlandingham is a deep one, but

his daughter is deeper still.”
“What do you know about Miss Vlandingham?”

asked Guy, with sudden interest. Mr. Pinchbeck
started to answer, but had to pause to grab his
glasses again. “Why don't you get a cord?”
added Guy, somewhat testily.
44

Eh ?”
9y

“Tie 'em on,” continued Guy, pointing to the
glasses. “If they were mine they'd give me ner
vous prostration. I don’t know but they will
anyhow.”
“I get so mad sometimes,” admitted Mr. Pinch
beck, “that I feel as though I could swear.” He

put the glasses in his pocket. “Nearsighted, you
know, and can't tell a dog from a wildcat across
the Street.”

“I was asking what you know about Miss

Vlandingham,” said Guy.
“So you were. Miss Vlandingham, Mr. Herbert,

96

His Friend the Enemy

is one of the cleverest young women I have ever

seen. Her mind is by far the brightest of any in
the rival town. She'll give you the fight of your
life and I’m inclined to think that her town will

win. She's a girl of infinite resource, and that
episode of this morning clearly illustrates the

spectacular way she has of doing things. Gra
cious ! Think of a woman donning a disguise and
coming deliberately into a hotbed of partisanship
like this !” Mr. Pinchbeck seemed so overcome by

the thought that he found it impossible to con
tinue for several moments. “You are a young
man without much experience, Mr. Herbert,” he

said finally, “and I’d like to give you a word of
advice. Will you accept it in a kindly spirit?”
“Certainly, Mr. Pinchbeck. What have you to
Offer?”

“Amityville is the key to this county-seat situa
tion. One lot of imported voters will offset the

other and as Amityville goes so goes the election.
Do you catch on?”
“I think I do.”

“Personally, I have little choice between Con
cord and Harmony. Still, my profits, if this town
is victorious, will be slightly greater, as the blocks
are four lots larger. Hence this tip, Mr. Herbert.

Get a county map and study it.”
Mr. Pinchbeck got up, walked over to the cigar
case and took out a cigar, laying a nickel in the

box for such purpose made and provided.
The principle of gain was too firmly wrought

The Key to the Situation

97

into Mr. Pinchbeck's nature for Guy to estimate
him very highly as a man, but he had furnished
the youth with a good deal of mental pabulum.

Every makeshift and design in the rival town
appeared to cluster about the personality of Miss
Betty—Miss Betty, with her Titian hair and melt
ing eyes—as dauntless as she was charming, as
brave as she was resourceful.

She had met Col.

Keever's most diplomatic move, bringing in voters
from Bismarck to offset those from Jamestown.
The contest was assuming proportions which made

Guy extremely doubtful of the result. Miss Betty
was likely to win the county-seat away from him
and his heart along with it. After an hour of
fruitless reflection Guy borrowed a county map of
Pedro, fortified himself with a good cigar, and

went up to his room to consider the question of
Amityville.
This village was the only other town in Goodwill

county. A marginal note on the map informed
Guy that its population was only about thirty
five. These thirty-five were undoubtedly favorable
to Harmony, for Amityville lay to the west of
that town and consequently nearer to it than to

Concord. In order for Harmony to present a peti
tion containing the names of two-thirds of the

qualified voters in the county, Amityville must
have signed it to a man.

Here was a good field

for effort, Guy thought. Why could he not go
over there and talk to the people? He came to a
conclusion just as the supper bell rang. He was
7

98

His Friend the Enemy

thoroughly determined to go to Amityville in the
course of a few days, and try his hand at elec
tioneering.
When he came out of his room he saw Pettibone

sitting in the hall beside his door. The young
man was surprised at the sheriff's presence but
made no comment.

“What did you do with Barney, Mr. Petti

bone?” asked Guy.
“He’s confined in a room over Pinney's that we
use as a jail.”
“What's to be done with him?”

“Judge Waffle will have to decide that.”
Pettibone was most companionable. He not
only accompanied Guy downstairs, but sat at
table with him, during supper, followed him out
on the porch for an evening smoke, chatted with
him until bedtime and then accompanied him up

stairs again to his room. A cot was standing in
the hall beside Guy's door in place of the chair.
“See here, Pettibone,” said Guy, “you're a nice

fellow, and all that, but don't you think you're
crowding me pretty close?”
“Well, no,” answered Pettibone, after a brief
period of thought.

“What does this mean, any way?”
“The Colonel and a lot more didn’t like the

way you carried on this morning, and they wanted
me to lock you up along with Barney. But I
told 'em no. Then they insisted that I should

have to watch you and be responsible for you if

I didn't put you under lock and key. I says all
right, and that's why I'm here.

I’m a good feller,

as you've just been kind enough to say, and I'm
dead sure you're another, so we're going to get
along without any friction, ain't we?”
“We'll try to,” laughed Guy.
“And in the morning,” continued Pettibone,

“we’ll go to the circus.”
“Circus?” echoed Guy.

“What circus, Petti

bone?”

“Well, the case of Keever vs. Liscomb is going
to be tried before Judge Waffle, and if we don’t
have a show with all but the rings and the canvas
I'll miss my guess. Good-night.”

Guy bade the sheriff good-night and went into
the room and closed the door.

The people of his own town had turned against

the interest was likely to increase instead

CHAPTER IX
KEEVER VERSUS LISCOMB

On the following morning, shortly before the
judicial hour of ten, Guy and Pettibone proceeded

to the building containing the drug store and
ascended to the second story. Here was the court
room and likewise the small apartment utilized as
a jail. Unlocking the door of the latter chamber,
Pettibone requested Barney to come forth. The
prisoner obeyed, and when he saw Guy he pressed
close to him and asked in a low tone, while the
sheriff busied himself relocking the door:
“Did you give me away?”
“No,” replied Guy, “and I will not. If you can
get clear, Barney, go back to Harmony and stay

there. That will be the safest and best thing you
can do.”

Barney nodded as the sheriff joined them, and
they started for the court-room.
As has been stated, Christopher Waffle owned a
threshing outfit. His profession was that of an
itinerant thresher of grain; incidentally, as will be
remembered, he was also Justice of the Peace.
There was, in Christopher Waffle, a certain
warmth of originality and sharpness of purpose

that had earned him the sobriquet of “Hot
Waffle.” But Christopher Waffle cared not for
public opinion, good or ill. He made it his ex

clusive aim to please Waffle, J. P., and thus was
always sure of being on good terms with himself,

whatever might be the state of his feelings toward
the rest of mankind.

When Guy, Barney and Pettibone entered the
room, the Judge had not yet arrived. Col. Keever
was there, however, his white hat severely set
upon his ample brows-mute testimony of his
mental condition. There, also, was Lem Bilkins,
twisted about a chair in close proximity to the
Colonel and watching his every movement with an
admiration that was almost soulful.

Glimmer was

there—Mrs. Glimmer having agreed to look after

the Emporium during his absence—and Pinney,
the druggist, and Leffingwell, proprietor of the

livery stable, and Sampson, and Mr. Barberry,
who was supposed to be a lawyer and who pos
sessed a painfully meagre form, a hatchet face,

had an impediment in his speech and had been
retained by the defense.

Others were present, but

none especially noteworthy. The buzz of conver
sation ceased abruptly upon the coming of the
sheriff with his prisoners—for it was plain that
Guy was considered in the light of a malefactor,

spared the odium of imprisonment merely because
of Pettibone and upon the latter's responsibility.
Frigid looks were directed at Guy by every one
except-strange as it may appear—the redoubt

able Colonel. The manager of the Townsite Com

pany had slept upon the incidents of the preceding
afternoon and had come to the conclusion that he

had been somewhat hasty with Guy. Solely by
grace of the young man he was directing the
affairs of the town. The office was no sinecure,

but if Concord won in the contest his paper would
“boom” and his nest would be feathered in other

ways. For these reasons, the glances he shot in
Guy's direction were of the sorrowful and injured
but-forgiving kind.
A chair, a table, a glass and a broken water

pitcher were awaiting the Judge, who finally ar
rived. He was clad in overalls carelessly tucked
into his boot-tops, was in his shirt sleeves, and
carried an oil can in one hand and a bunch of

“waste” in the other. Bill Comfort, bearing a
large book, was close at his employer's heels.
“It looks as though you people never would get

through lawin’,” growled the Judge. “Here it is,
only two months from the biggest harvest we

have had in the Territory yet, and I’ve got to
leave my threshing machine and come here.”
At this point his Honor exchanged his oil can
and bunch of waste for the book.

“Sit down, Bill,” he commanded, and the engi
neer tipped Lem Bilkins out of his chair and
seated himself.

“Now,” continued the Judge, laying the book
down on the table and throwing himself into his
seat, “I was busy yesterday afternoon and don’t

know what this is all about.
body.”
Mr. Barberry got up.

Tell me, some

“If you p-p-please, your Honor, I have the
p-p-pleasure to ap-ap-ap-”
That was the extent of Mr. Barberry's utter
ance, for the time. He grew red in the face,
whistled, stamped his foot and struck himself in
the side, all to no purpose.

Then the Colonel, suave, dignified, voluble, arose.
“Your Honor,” said he, “this is an action

brought against one Barney Liscomb for mali
ciously threatening my life with a shotgun.”
“I seen him do it !” declared Lem Bilkins.

“You hush, Bilkins. You, too, Keever. I
wouldn't try to say anything if it's painful, Bar
berry. Sit down and keep still, all of you. I'm
the boss of this threshing outfit.”
“This is a court of law, your Honor, and not a

threshing outfit,” remonstrated the Colonel.
“It isn't, eh?

I say a court of law is a moral

threshing machine. Doesn’t it separate the wheat
from the chaff?”

“Right you are, Waff!” seconded Bill Comfort.
The Judge frowned at his engineer.
“This is no the-ay-ter,” he resumed. “What
have you been doing, Barney?”
“Your Honor, I-I-I—” began the lawyer for
the defence.

“Don’t distress yourself, Barberry; sit down. I
was talking to Liscomb.”

Keever Versus Liscomb

IoS

“I r-r-represent him in this c-c-case.”
“Not in this court. Sit down, I tell you. Now,
Barney?”
“But, your Honor, c-c-c—” stuttered Bar

berry, red and desperate. .

“Stop your whistling and stomping ! Don't
you know any better than to whistle and stomp

in a court of justice?”
“But Mr. Lis-Lis-Liscomb—”

The Judge glared at the lawyer so sternly he
wilted into his chair.

“Shall I throw him out, Waff?” asked Bill Com

fort, making a pugilistic gesture with the bunch
of waste.

“No,” said the Judge, withdrawing his glare
from Barberry and bestowing it upon his engineer,

“but I'll tell you what you can do, Bill Comfort.
You can keep still or I'll throw you out, and no
two ways about it. Now, Barney.”

Barney stood up and was about to speak when
Col. Keever broke in ahead of him.

“Your Honor, it is customary first to hear the
plaintiff. I beg to be allowed to make my state
ment.”

“And I beg to be allowed to tell you to mind
your p’s and q’s, Is my authority to be respected
Or isn’t it?”

Col. Keever coughed and thrust his hand into
his bosom.

“I will address this court, sir.”

“You will, will you!” exclaimed Waffle, starting

Io6
up slowly.

His Friend the Enemy
“If you say much more, Keever, the

dignity of this court is going to be badly im
paired.”
“You’re a disgrace to the law you profess to
represent.”
“Silence, or I'll fine you for contempt.”

“If my fine was in proportion to my contempt,”
scored the Colonel, “a million dollars wouldn't

pay it.”
“Now, you're getting personal. Pettibone, if
that man forgets himself again, take him down to
the end of the hall and lock him up. While I'm

here this thing is going to be run according to
Waffle. Come here, Barney, and I'll swear you.”
Barney laid his hand on the book while the
oath was administered, then he was asked in a
tone of judicial severity:

“Did you point a deadly weapon at that gentle
man in the white hat?”

“Yes, sir.”
“What was it—a shot gun?”
“Yes, sir.”
“What was it loaded with?’”
“NO. 5 shot.”

“How far were you from Col. Keever at the
time?”

“About fifty feet.”
“Now, then, answer me square-up.

If your gun

had gone off would it have killed our respected
friend?”

“I think it would, sir.”

Keever Versus Liscomb

107

The Judge leaned forward in his chair.
“Then why in HELL didn't you shoot?”
A painful silence settled over the court-room and
then there came a titter from some one some

where in the crowd.

Guy laughed outright.

Springing erect the Colonel inflated his broad
chest, and fastened his eyes on Waffle.
“Sir,” he cried in a voice whose every intona
tion sent a palpitating chill through Lem Bilkins,

“you are invested with the sacred majesty of law,
and I would rather cut off my right hand than

raise it against one of the noblest of my country's
institutions, but—”

“That will do, Keever,” cut in the Judge.
“Make any more comments on my way of doing
things and I'll fine you and levy on your old
blanket sheet for the amount.

You're the kind of

a frontier product that makes an honest man
blush for his race. You're having your day now,
but the time will come when the people will find

you out. Beware of that time, Keever, that's my
advice to you.”
Col. Keever turned stiffly and strode to the door.

There he halted to shake his cane at the Judge
and exclaim wrathfully:

“You shall answer for this, sir! Egad, I shall
see that you answer for this !”
He flounced out of the room and the Judge
laughed and called after him:
“Whenever you're ready for me, Colonel, you'll
find I’m ready for you. Liscomb, I shall have to

IoS

His Friend the Enemy

fine you $10, not for what you did do, but for
what you didn’t do. If you will promise—”
He was interrupted by the wild tolling of a bell.
His words died away on his lips and he sat rigidly
upright, listening to the sound as though fasci
nated. Pettibone gave a startled jump. A death
like stillness was everywhere, broken only by the
heavy breathing of those in the room.
“It's the alarm l” cried Glimmer, his voice shak
ing with excitement; “the Harmony men are
coming after the records! The Harmony men l’”

“Court's adjourned !” shouted Waffle, leaping
over the table. “Run for the court-house, every
man of you!”
There followed a scrambling rush for the door,

accompanied by fierce yells and shouts of defiance.
In the confusion, Guy and Barney were separated
from the sheriff and from each other.

Left to his

own devices, Guy drew back and then trailed
along in the rear of the crowd, which swept down
the stairs and off up the street in the direction of
the court-house.

CHAPTER X
GUY'S DILEMMA

When the excited Concordians reached the court

house they found absolutely no sign of a foe. All
was quiet and peaceful and the men who had
formed themselves into a hasty cordon about the
building began to look at each other dubiously.

Their attention was finally attracted by Mrs.
Glimmer, who came out in front of the Emporium.
“Who rang the bell?” she cried nervously.
“Don’t you know?” returned her husband in a
bewildered tone.

“I haven’t the slightest idea, Benjamin. I
heard a noise upstairs and ran to see what was
the matter. While I was gone some one rang the
bell. Dear sakes ! Are the Harmony folks
comin’?”

“Don’t you worry, Amanda. Whether they
come or not, I'm here. Did you see any one in

the store when you came down?”
“Not a soul.”
y

“Here's a how-de-do, boys,” said Glimmer, in a

puzzled tone. “Who could have rung that bell
and what was it rung for?”
“There's Sampson up on top of The Blizzard

building !” shouted Bilkins.
Io9

*

I IO

His Friend the Enemy

Sampson was there, sure enough, shading his
eyes with his hand and looking off towards Har
mony.

“See any one, Samp?” cried Pettibone.
“Can't see a thing,” called back Sampson.
“Some one must have played a joke on you fel
lows.”

“Joke!” spluttered Waffle. “If we could find
the man who played a joke of that kind we'd
string him up.”
Coincident with the Judge's remark, the Colonel
rounded the front of The Blizzard building. His
whole manner was one of hauteur and utter in
difference.

The crowd around

the

court-house

watched him in silence. The great man had been
treated shabbily. The citizens realized that now,
and as their sympathy deepened for the Colonel
their anger arose against the Judge.

The Colonel mounted slowly and with dignity
step by step. On reaching the upper landing he
laid his hand on the knob of the office door, hesi
tated, and then turned and vouchsafed his atten
tion to the group below.
“Men of Concord,” he said sonorously, “Chris

topher Waffle has spared a traitor this day—at
my expense. You have been cozened, deceived by
some confederate of Liscomb's.

This confederate

raised a disturbance in Glimmer's living apart
ments, and while Mrs. Glimmer went to ascertain
the cause of the unwonted noise the confederate

slipped into the Emporium and rang the bell.

Guy's Dilemma
What was the effect?

I I I

In the confusion that re

sulted the traitor escaped. Search among you
and see if I am not correct.”

The Colonel entered his office and slammed the

door.

He had had his fling.

Upon them he had

returned a moiety of the disparagement that had
a short time before been his. And he was right,
as usual, for Liscomb was nowhere to be found;
nor could the confederate be discovered.

After a

hrief period of search the citizens went their sev
eral ways.

Guy and Pettibone turned in the direction of the
hotel. While sauntering leisurely along, discussing
the incidents of the morning, Sampson passed
them. The printer was going to the post-office to

get the Colonel's mail and he had his hands in
his pockets and was whistling lustily. Any one

could have seen with half an eye that he was very
well satisfied with himself.

“I want a word with Sampson in private, Petti
bone,” said Guy. “Will you wait here a moment
while I overtake him?”

“Going to put up a job to give me the slip?”
inquired the sheriff with a wink.
“I hadn’t thought of such a thing.”
“All right, go on.”

Guy called to Sampson and came up with him
a dozen yards ahead.

“There is one man in this town, Sampson,”
remarked Guy, “who knows all about your deal

ings with the Harmony people.”

II 2

His Friend the Enemy

The printer's jaw dropped and a troubled look
shot athwart his freckled face.
“What's that?” he mumbled.

Guy repeated his words and Sampson cast an
apprehensive glance behind him.

“What are you trying to get at, any how?” he
demanded, putting on a bold front.
“I’ll tell you in a moment. But for a combi
nation of unusual circumstances that came to my

aid, you'd have got me into a peck of trouble
Monday night.

I have the note you wrote to

Vlandingham. You made a mistake when you
used the back of an old sheet of copy. I have

identified that copy with a printed leader in The
Blizzard and the circumstantial evidence against
you is complete.”
The red faded out of Sampson's face and left it
a sickly white. His frightened glances focused
upon the sheriff for an instant, and then returned
to Guy.
“I know,” went on Guy, “that you assisted
Col. Dingle to get out of that closet in the hotel
and I think that you are also the confederate who
helped Barney to make his escape.”
Sampson moistened his dry lips with his tongue.
“I’m not saying a word about anything,” he

observed finally. “What are you going to do
about it?”

“I am merely going to advise you to stop this
trafficking with the enemy. If I promise not to
turn you over to Pettibone and tell the Concord

Guy's Dilemma

II 3

people what you have done, will you be a good
citizen after this?”

“Sure,” was the printer's prompt reply. He was
greatly relieved, and showed it. “I’ll do more

than that, and give you this letter right now in
stead of sneaking into the hotel and slipping it
under the door of your room as I was going to

do, after I went to the post-office.” Sampson
took a square pink envelope from the breast of
his coat and handed it to Guy. “Vlandingham's
hired man brought that over to me at 12 o'clock
last night. He said he couldn't deliver it himself,
as the sheriff was sleeping with one eye open in
front of your room door and he wanted me to
slip it into your hands.”
Guy looked at the superscription of the missive.
The chirography was graceful and distinctly femi
nine.

Of course he did not know who the letter

was from, but he could imagine, and his eyes

brightened and his face flushed.
“It's a good thing you're going to keep still
about me,” grinned Sampson. “I’m not the only
fellow who has established communication with

the enemy.”
He went away chuckling, while Guy dropped the

note quickly into his breast pocket and waited for
the sheriff to rejoin him.
“Didn't he give you something?” queried Petti
bone, as they walked on.
“Nothing of much importance,”

Guy.

answered

II.4.

His Friend the Enemy

The sheriff was thoughtful for a space and then
asked abruptly :
“Did you ever see a duel, Mr. Herbert?”
“What kind of a duel ?”

“One of the old-fashioned blood-and-thunder

kind. Guess you know about as much how they
did it as I do. It's in defiance of the law, and I
suppose I'll have to go out and linger around even
if I don’t do anything. You can have your choice

between being locked up while I am gone, or going
with me.”

“I’ll go with you, Pettibone.”
“That's sensible. We may have a little fun inci
dentally. Read that.”
The sheriff fished a folded paper out of his
pocket and Guy opened the sheet and read as
follows:

“Concord, June 16, ’85.
“Mr. Richard Pettibone, Sheriff of Goodwill
county, Concord, D. T.
“Dear Sir : One who cherishes the law as the

dearest of our country's institutions, and who has
become aware of a terrible crime about to be

committed, comes to you with these presents,

asserting that challenge and acceptance to fight a
duel have passed between two of the most worthy

people of Goodwill county. , Challenge was issued
from the editorial office of The Norther and ac

cepted in the sanctum of The Blizzard—this, be it
stated, in direct violation of paragraph 298,
Chapter XXIII, Penal Code of this Territory.
This affair of honor, unless thwarted by exercise

of your authority, will take place at 4 o'clock in

Guy's Dilemma

II 5

the afternoon of Wednesday, June 17, on the
north shore of Lake Elizabeth.

“If you have a decent regard for the peace and
well-being of this community, let me supplicate
you forthwith to take such steps as may seem
advisable for averting an impending catastrophe.
Proceed to the scene of this intended crime and

resort to force, if necessary, in overturning the
sanguinary plans of the duellists.
“PRO BONO PUBLICO.”

“This states plainly enough that the two Col
onels are the principals in the affair,” said Guy.
“The fact of this proposed duel is no news to me,
however, as I already had knowledge of it from
Col.

Keever

himself.

Who is this ‘Pro

Bono

Publico, I wonder?”
“You wonder, eh?” returned Pettibone, with
another of his winks. “Don’t you know that
there is only one man in this town who could, or
would, write a letter of that kind?”
“Who is that?”

“Hold that letter close to your nose and get a
good whiff of it.”
“Printer's ink,” said Guy.

“Right you are; the kind of printer's ink they
use on The Blizzard.”

“You don’t mean to say that Col. Keever
wrote this letter himself?”

“Yes, I do.”

“Why, he's simply furious, and vows that he'll
have Dingle's life.”
By this time they were at the Lisbon House and

I 16

His Friend the Enemy

Pettibone, with one hand on the veranda railing,
threw back his head and laughed boisterously.
“Keever is playing to the galleries,” said he.
“He’s the slickest hand at make-believe that I

ever knew, and I’ve known a good many.

He

hasn’t any more thought of fighting a duel than
I have, but he'll act as bloodthirsty as a savage.
Don't you see that if I go out to Lake Elizabeth
and interfere by force to prevent the duel he'll
come out of the scrape in high feather? The rank
and file of this town have never dropped a plum
met to the bottom of the Colonel's nature, but
Chris Waffle has and so have I, that's sure.”

“You’re going out there to stop it, are you?”
“I’m going out there, but not to stop it,” an
swered Pettibone, folding the letter which Guy had
handed back to him and replacing it in his pocket.

“I’m going out there to hide in the brush and
look on. My word for it, Mr. Herbert, it will stop
itself.

Let's see—the north shore of Lake Eliza

beth at 4 o'clock, Wednesday afternoon.

If you

will promise not to take French leave, I'll run
over to the house and tell my boy, Alec, to hitch
up and drive around here about 3 o'clock.”
“Don’t worry about me, Pettibone,” answered
Guy. “I shan’t leave this town until the county
seat contest is decided, one way or the other. I
have too much at stake.

“All right, then. I won't be gone more than
half an hour.”

Thereupon the sheriff strode off down the street

--~~~~~~~<---------------------------

Guy's Dilemma

and Guy went up on the veranda and seated him
self.

At that hour Pedro Smith was in the kitchen

overseeing the preparations for dinner. Guy was
alone in that quarter and he removed the pink
envelope very gently from his pocket and opened
it and drew forth the perfumed sheet. It was
really from Miss Betty, and his heart beat faster
than usual as he read the dainty writing.
“Dear Friend : There is a matter of grave im
portance which I wish to discuss with you. As I
cannot come to Concord, and you cannot come to
Harmony, may I ask you to meet me at some
neutral point to-morrow, Wednesday afternoon, at
4 o'clock? There is a pretty little lake which is
named after me and which lies equally distant be
tween

the two towns–Lake Elizabeth.

Please

meet me there. Yours very truly,
“ELIZABETH VLANDINGHAM.

“P. S.–Miss Pinkney will accompany me, but I
shall expect you to come alone.
E. V.”
The joy which Guy felt over this proposed meet

ing with Miss Betty was lost in the consternation
which suddenly seized upon him. By what strange

coincidence had she appointed for their meeting
the very place, day and hour fixed upon by the
duellists for their affair of honor?

And how was

he to go alone when he had already agreed to go

with the sheriff? Anyhow, how could he go alone
any place?
Guy was in despair. He did not see how he
could possibly engineer affairs so as to prevent

I 18

His Friend the Enemy

Miss Betty from getting the idea that he was
two-faced and had betrayed to the sheriff the con
tents of her letter.

Here was a dilemma of gigantic proportions,
and how was he to get around it?

CHAPTER XI
AN AFFAIR OF “HONOR”

Guy had an idea that he might telegraph Miss
Vlandingham he would be at Lake Elizabeth at
4 o'clock, but that, through circumstances over
which he had no control, the sheriff would ac
company him. A little reflection convinced him
that it would not be well to send a message of
this kind; so, instead of that, he sent the follow

ing:
“Please appoint another day, same place.”
This was tantamount to saying that he would
not be able to meet Miss Betty at the rendezvous
and Guy, highly pleased with the way he had
got around the difficulty, returned from the
telegraph office to the hotel. Unfortunately he did
not observe that Col. Keever was in the freight
department of the depot, where he had come to

find out whether the “patent outsides” for the
next issue of The Blizzard had yet arrived. Un
seen, the Colonel overheard the young man's
colloquy with the operator. What the great man
did after that will soon appear.

Pettibone joined Guy at dinner. After the meal
they smoked their cigars and chatted in friendly
II 9

I 2O

His Friend the Enemy

fashion until 3 o'clock, when young Alec drove a
high-stepper and a covered buggy up to the hotel
veranda. Guy and the sheriff immediately got
into the vehicle and drove off, leaving young Alec
staring wistfully after them.
Very soon the travellers were out of town and
rolling rapidly along the level road which, worn
deeply into the turf, was almost as hard and
smooth as asphalt. The sun had half descended

the western sky; a few vaporous clouds floated
overhead and a balmy wind blew from the north
west and languidly rippled the grass and the
flowers. The whistle of a robin and the plaintive
notes of a meadow lark thrilled through the scene,

giving a touch of melody to a day already per
fect.
??

“This is something like living,” remarked Guy,

again and again filling his lungs to their fullest
capacity with the warm, sweet air.
“That's what,” assented Pettibone. “If a man
was only out in these parts for his health what a
time he could have | God made the country, they

say, and men make the town. Everything's lovely
until civilized people come along, tickle the soil
with a plow and make it laugh wheat and oats,
and then the trouble begins. Seems like the more
Nature smiles and shows her good feelings, the
more unsociable people become. Now, look there”
—the sheriff waved his hand towards the stretch of

prairie dotted with squares of growing grain, each
square pushing the “shack” of its owner as far

An Affair of “Honor”

I 2I

towards its limits as possible—“did you ever see
anything purtier? But there's a heart in every
one of those shacks, Mr. Herbert, that's bitter as

gall over this county-seat question. And if it
wasn't that, it would be something else.

I tell

you, a human bein’ has got to have a grievance
to nurse, or fondle, or tuck away, or put up on a
pole and howl about, or he won’t be contented.
That's right.”
“Why are the farmers so deeply interested in the

county-seat fight?”
“Most of 'em have a lot or two in town, so it's a

pocketbook affair with them. Those that haven’t
any lots just take sides in order to have some
thing to quarrel about. , The farmer that lives
nearest to Concord is a Concord man, and the
one closest to Harmony is for that town tooth

and nail. Sile Whittaker—that's his house 'way
over yender, you can see it just over the lash of
my whip now—well, when he first built his claim
shanty it was right square between the two towns,
not a foot farther from Concord than it was from

Harmony. For a long time Sile didn’t know what
to do for a grievance, and it worried him so that
he hitched his team to his shack one night, and
pulled it over onto the northeast corner of his
hundred and sixty. That brought him nearer
Concord, see? When the county-seat was located
in Concord, and things got fairly quiet there, he
was blue as a whetstone till he hauled his shack

across to the southwest corner of the quarter, and

I 2.2

His Friend the Enemy

that made a Harmony man out of him. Just now
it don't make any difference which side of his
farm he's on.

Sile can be in hot water all the

time, so he's just about as comfortable in the
spirit as any man can be, and live. And that's
the way it goes.”
Dick Pettibone was full of anecdote and reminis

cence and sage reflections on life, and the half

hour which it required for the high-stepper to
trot them to their destination was whiled away
most agreeably.
Lake Elizabeth was a small but beautiful ex

panse

of water, shimmering like a diamond

against the green of the plain. On all sides the
banks had a gentle slope and there were wide

reaches of white sand skirting the water's edge.
To the north were two small groves of cotton
woods standing knee-deep in a dense undergrowth.
“We're half an hour ahead of time,” said Petti

bone, “and consequently are first on the ground.
Suppose we make ourselves comfortable among
those cottonwoods, where we can't be seen, and

await developments.”
Thus speaking, he headed his horse toward the
more southerly of the two groves. In a little
time the horse and buggy had been hidden in the
brushy tangle and the sheriff and Guy had hit
upon a point of vantage from which, entirely un
observed, they could see the north shore of the
lake in its full extent.

They had no more than settled themselves com

An Affair of “Honor”

123

fortably when a fall of hoofs reached their ears

and they saw, near the crest of the sloping shore,
two horsemen descending at a gallop toward the
other grove.
“By cracky 1’’ muttered Pettibone. “If there
ain't old man Glimmer and Lem Bilkins, I'm a

Feejee | Now what the dickens are they here for?
Tell me that, somebody, and I'll be obliged.

Look

at that ! They're going into hiding in the other
grove. Well, I'll be dinged !”
Bilkins and Glimmer disappeared in the brush
and among the trees to the north, and all was
outwardly as calm and serene as before.

The next arrivals were Col. Dingle and Capt.
Blue, who drove a red-wheeled gig over the rise
and down to a sentinel cottonwood that stood

apart. The Captain and the Colonel were joking
and laughing, and one would have imagined that
a duel was as ordinary a matter with them as

Col. Keever had informed Guy it had once been
with him.

Capt. Blue hitched the horse to a tree and as he

finished and turned away Col. Keever and Samp
son drove merrily upon the scene. The editor of

The Blizzard was smoking a cigar and his extreme
nonchalance was the most noticeable thing about
him.

“Good afternoon, gentlemen,” he called courte
ously to those already on the field.
Col. Dingle and Capt. Blue nodded distantly
and Col. Keever shrugged his fat shoulders,

I 24

His Friend the Enemy

chuckled cynically and got down from the buggy.
Groping around under the seat he succeeded in
fiinding and in drawing into sight a large revolver.
Facing about, he pressed a spring, pulled down
the barrel and gave a business-like glance at the

cartridges in the cylinder. This done, he snapped
the revolver together, knocked the ashes from his
cigar with the muzzle and swaggered over in the
direction of his opponent.

“Well,” said Dingle, sharply, “if you are ready,
pace off the distance and let us get this affair
Over with.”

“We'll first flip a quarter for choice of posi
tions,” returned Keever, giving a side glance at
the sun. “The last time I figured in an affair of
this kind—was it the last, now, or the next to the

last?—well, anyway, I fought with the sun in my
eyes and only pinked my man. Still—”
“Your reminiscences are very interesting, but I
think we can dispense with them,” cut in Capt.

Blue, taking a quarter out of his pocket. “Once
for all, Col. Keever. What is it?”
The coin twirled in the air.

“Heads !” cried Keever, and won the toss.

Taking up his position with his back to the
west, he motioned to Sampson.

The printer came at once, leaving the horse un
hitched. Although the horse was known to be
gentle, it was a foolish thing for Sampson to
leave it in this way.
“Sampson, pace off twenty steps with Capt.

An Affair of “Honor”

I 25

Blue,” commanded Keever. “If you'd rather make

it ten, Dingle, I'm agreeable.”
“Five l’’ cried the little Colonel.

“Would you like to have me tie a handkerchief
over one of my eyes?” asked Col. Keever with
exasperating condescension. “I dislike to take
any advantage of you.”
“Don’t you be disturbed !” flared Dingle hotly.
“When it comes to pistol practice my one eye is
as good as your two eyes any day.”
“Calm yourself, Dingle, or your aim will be bad.

Sampson, see that I get five paces—or less.”
Five very short paces were stumped off by the

Captain, who punctuated the distance by driving
his wooden leg into the sand at both posi
tions.

“All right, Colonel,” sung out Sampson, and

the principals were soon back to back, weapons in
hand, awaiting the fall of Capt. Blue's cap, which
was to be the signal to turn and fire.
From their places of concealment in the brush

Guy and Pettibone were listening to the conversa
tion and watching the sanguinary preparations
with intense interest. Was it to be a tragedy,
after all, instead of a farce? Guy was beginning
to grow nervous.

“We'd better go out and stop this before it's
too late,” he said excitedly
“They'll kill each other.”

Pettibone.

“Don’t you believe it,” returned the sheriff con
fidently. “Hear that I This is where Bilkins and

126

His Friend the Enemy

Glimmer take a hand and I'll warrant Keever put
them up to it.”

Bilkins and Glimmer had suddenly leaped from
the other patch of timber and Guy and the sheriff

saw them bound over the intervening space and
hurl themselves upon Col. Keever. Sampson had
also seized his employer and the three were strug
gling with him in great desperation.
Capt. Blue took a pipe from one pocket, a
handful of tobacco from another, and filled the

pipe-bowl calmly and methodically while watching
Keever's apparently desperate attempt to free
himself.

“Stand off!” shouted Dingle. “Break away
from that scoundrel or I'll open fire on you all !”
No attention was paid to him.
“Go for the whole lot, Dingle,” advised the

Captain, applying a match to his pipe and puffing
out little clouds of white vapor.
“Crack l’’ came a shot from the little Colonel's
revolver.

The bullet plumped into the ground at the feet

of the struggling quartet, throwing a spurt of
sand into the air.

At this ominous sound the four

Concordians separated and began to run. The

report also frightened the horse attached to the
Colonel's buggy and the animal took to a wild

gallop and vanished over the swell in a twink
ling.

Concordians, the gallant Keever, despite his
avoirdupois, keeping well in the lead.
Dingle gave chase and continued to follow until
his weapon was empty and his foes out of sight,
then he returned, shook hands with Capt. Blue,
and they unhitched their horse, climbed into the
red-wheeled gig and drove unconcernedly away.
Pettibone was rolling on the ground, kicking his

heels and choking with tumultuous mirth. Guy
shared the sheriff's enjoyment, with the same ap
preciation if not the same abandon, but the
laughter died suddenly upon his lips. He had
chanced to look out over the sandy shore of the
lake and the vision that met his gaze had hushed

his merriment. After he had turned away to rub
his eyes he looked again.

Could he believe the

evidence of his senses?

Pettibone was not slow to observe the change
that had come over his companion. Getting up
quickly, he drew close to Guy's side and likewise
peered through the bushes.
“Great Jupiter !” he exclaimed. “If there ain’t
Vlandingham's daughter and another girl, I'm a
Hottentot ! I'll just go out and interview them.”
He started out as he spoke, but Guy grabbed him
and jerked him roughly back.

“No, you don’t l” said the young man firmly.

CHAPTER XII
A MISUNDERSTANDING

Why was Miss Vlandingham there? Was it pos
sible that she had not received his message?
These questions flashed through Guy's brain, but
he had no time to debate them. Pettibone, smart
ing under his summary treatment, was as near
angry as he ever became.

“I’m a good fellow all right, Herbert,” muttered
the sheriff, “but I'll be dinged if I’m going to let

you slam me around like that. I can be sociable
and pleasant, if I want to, and I can be the other
thing, too.”

“You mustn't go out there,” said Guy, nodding
his head towards the beach.

“Shucks!

Any one would think, to hear you

talk, that I’m the prisoner and you're the sheriff.
You can’t boss me, no, siree.”
“Look here, Pettibone,” returned Guy earnestly,

“there's no need of our having a particle of diffi
culty. Those ladies have come here to meet me.”
“An appointment, eh?”
“Yes.”
“Who made it?”

“They did.”
9

I 29

I 30

His Friend the Enemy

“Funny thing that they should appoint this
place and this particular time,” observed the
sheriff cynically.

“It's a coincidence, but I can't see anything
very humorous about it.”
“It's a coincidence that doesn’t coincide.”

“I’m telling you the truth,” averred Guy, flush
ing at this pointblank doubt of his veracity.
“They wanted me to come out here alone and
talk with them on an important matter. The
appointment was made by letter, received this

morning. Naturally I had no time to inform Miss
Vlandingham that I was under surveillance and if
she sees you she'll think I brought you. You've
been a capital fellow all along, Pettibone. Be one
now, can't you? Stay here while I go out and
talk with them.”

“And put up a job for beating Concord out of
the county-seat, eh?

Not much ! You're a little

the most peculiar fellow I ever saw, Herbert.
With as big a bunch of lots as you've got in Con
cord you're willing to throw up everything on
account of a chit of a girl like Betty Vlanding
ham.”

“See here,” retorted Guy warmly, “Miss Vlan

dingham is a lady, and not the kind of a girl to
try to put up a job, as you call it, with any one.
I am just as loyal to Concord as you are, every
whit. Heaven knows I ought to be, for if we lose
the county-seat I shall be a financial wreck and
will have to hunt around for somebody who wants

A Misunderstanding
a bookkeeper.

I3I

Have a little reason, Pettibone,”

Guy implored, casting a hasty glance in the direc
tion of the ladies and noting that Miss Vlanding
ham was standing up in the buggy and looking
around perplexedly. “If I don’t go out pretty
soon they'll think I'm not coming. Stay here and

keep quiet and I'll give you a block of lots.”
“You can’t bribe me,” answered Pettibone,
“and you can’t go out there, either.”
The steely flash shot into Guy's eyes and the

lines tightened at the corners of his mouth.
“You refuse to let me pass?” he demanded, as

Pettibone stepped in front of him.
“I certainly do.

Everybody in Concord wanted

you locked up because, as they said, you were
ruining the chances of the town with your gadding
about.

But I says, “No.

He's young, gentlemen,”

says I, ‘and a pair of blue eyes has a fascination
for him,' I says. “I’ll take him in tow and watch
him,' I says, “and see to it that he doesn’t com
municate with the enemy, with that particular

enemy,' I says, “any more. Now, that's what I
done, Herbert, and here you are, first jump out of
the box, trying to get me into trouble.

You

don’t go out there, I tell you flat.”
“And I tell you that I am going,” answered

Guy vehemently.
He made a spring to the left with the intention
of darting past the sheriff; but the latter was
fully as quick and threw himself sideways, catching
Guy's arm and clinging to him like a leech. Pant

I 32

His Friend the Enemy

ing, the two stood for a second and gazed at each
other.

“I don't wish to hurt you, Pettibone,” said
Guy in a tense tone, “but I assure you that I am

going out to talk with Miss Vlandingham. I'll do
nothing treasonable, I promise you that. Won't
you take the word of a gentleman?”
“I’m not taking anybody's word just now,”
was Pettibone's obstinate rejoinder. “Here you
are and here you'll stay.”
“Then look out for yourself!”

With these words Guy closed with the sheriff.
The young man had a splendid muscular develop
ment, which his appearance, in a measure, belied.
He was likewise the possessor of a fair amount of
fistic science and wrestling skill which his quiet
demeanor and modest bearing were far from sug
gesting. A knowledge of all this was quickly made
manifest to Pettibone, and the realization that he
had met more than his match was about the last

tangible thought he had for several minutes. In
a twinkling he was neatly thrown, and, in falling,
his head came in violent contact with a tree root,
so that he was stunned and his hold on Guy re

laxed. After contracting strongly, his limbs were
flung out with a jerk and he closed his eyes and
lay motionless.

Guy was alarmed, at first, but when he had
pressed the tips of his fingers through Pettibone's
thick hair, and felt the skull at the point where it
had come in contact with the root, his apprehen

A Misunderstanding

I 33

sion vanished. There was nothing to worry over,
and the sheriff would be himself again very
shortly. Removing Pettibone's coat, Guy wrapped
it up compactly and placed it under his head;
then he hurried to the buggy, and secured the
halter rope that was under the seat. Coming
back, he tied the sheriff's hands behind him with
one end of the halter and secured the other end
about the tree beside whose trunk the sheriff had
fallen.

He worked rapidly, only a few minutes elapsing
between his attack upon Pettibone and his final
work with the halter. Without waiting an in
stant, Guy pushed through the intervening thicket
and started down the grassy descent toward the

carriage.
Miss Betty, a vexed expression on her pretty

face, had just tightened the lines with one of her
gloved hands and taken the whip from its socket
with the other, when she saw Guy approaching.
The vexed look faded into a dazzling smile.
“Well, truant,” cried Miss Betty, “did you re

main away purposely to punish us for being
late?”

Guy's clothing was somewhat disarranged, and
a wondering light came into Miss Betty's eyes as
she gazed at him. Miss Pinkney was as reserved
as usual, although she smiled in friendly spirit and
evidently partook of her companion's curiosity.
“I came as quickly as I could, Miss Vlanding
ham,” answered Guy, settling his collar and ar

I 34

His Friend the Enemy

ranging his scarf. “Please pardon my disordered
appearance—it could not be helped.”
Miss Betty indulged in one of her silvery laughs.
“You did not walk all the way here from Con
cord, did you?” she queried.
“No. The horse and buggy that brought me
are over there among the trees. Your appoint
ment was for 4 o'clock, if I remember.”

“Yes, and I should have been here punctually
but for Lois. She misunderstood that part of our
programme and was late in getting to our house
to accompany me.

But here we are, at last, and

if we have not entirely exhausted your patience,
Mr. Herbert, perhaps I had better proceed at once
with the matter which led me to seek this inter
view.”

“Pardon me just a moment.” Guy had ad
vanced to the forward wheel on Miss Betty's side
of the buggy. He was very close to her, and, in
the few times he had seen her, she had never been

more lovely in his eyes than she was then. The
breeze had brought a fresh, ruddy color to her
cheeks and her broad-brimmed straw hat was

most becoming. “I was going to ask you,” pro
ceeded Guy, conscious of an awkward pause, “if
you were at home all the afternoon up to the
time you left to drive here?”
“I was at home the entire afternoon,” answered
Miss Betty.

“And did you not receive my message?”
“Your message?” she echoed.

A Misunderstanding
“Yes.

I 35

I sent you a telegram.”

“Then it was not delivered to me.”

“That's strange,” murmured Guy.
“What was the message?”
“Nothing very important.”

“Messages are usually quite important if they
are telegraphed.”

“I should have said that it is not very im
portant now, so we need not concern ourselves

any further about it. As you said a moment ago,
you are here, and I'm here, and we can talk over
the matter about which you wished to see me.
What is it, Miss Vlandingham?”

“Possibly I am acting a treasonable part,” she
answered thoughtfully, “but I have already told
you how I abhor any show of force, or suggestion
of violence. The Concord people have not taken
a course calculated to lessen the bitterness in

separable from a contest of this kind.”
“I know that very well,” said Guy, as Miss
Betty paused. “Much of the evil was done before
I reached Concord and, during the short time I
have been in town, I have had no influence what

ever with the citizens.” Guy smiled as he said
this, wondering what Miss Betty would think if he
told her the plain truth of his situation. “If I

wish to do anything that's really commendable,”
he added, “I’m obliged to resort to force and
violence myself.”

Miss Betty raised her eyebrows interrogatively,
but Guy would not answer her unspoken question.

136

His Friend the Enemy

In a few moments he cursed his folly for not doing
so while he had the opportunity. A woful misun
derstanding would thus have been avoided.
“I hope no unpleasantness has resulted from the

timely aid you gave those two Sisters of Char
ity?” said Miss Betty demurely.
“I have only pleasure in the thought that I was

able to assist them,” answered Guy gallantly.
As he spoke he fancied he heard a noise in the
undergrowth behind him and looked around has
tily. He could see nothing to arouse his suspi
cions and both Miss Betty and her friend followed
his quick look with questioning eyes.
“You were about to tell why you wanted to see
me, Miss Vlandingham,” continued Guy, smother

ing every symptom of alarm and looking as calm
and self-possessed as was possible under the cir
cumstances. “I don't think you could be treason
able if you tried.”
“Indeed !” she exclaimed with a smile.

“How

do you know that I have not summoned you here
to make a captive of you? How do you know,
sir, that I have not a horde of Harmony people
at my beck and call, lying in ambush yonder?”
Guy laughed at the tragic air she put on to fit
the words.

“I am sure there are no Harmony people over
there,” he replied, trying to imagine what the

sheriff was doing by this time.
“Nevertheless, you seem very nervous,” said

Miss Betty. “It is getting late and you are

A Misunderstanding

I 37

anxious to start homeward, I can see very plainly,
so I will hasten to finish the business that brought
me.” Snapping with the whip lash at a wild rose

blooming on the verge of sandy beach and prairie
sod, she went on in a manner that was captivat

ingly confidential. “Capt. Blue, one of Har
mony's most warlike citizens, has organized a

company of Invincibles and is drilling them night
and day. There are a score of men in the com
pany and I am very much afraid, Mr. Herbert,

that possessing the means for some headstrong
piece of work will lead to the work being done.
I have tried to break up the Invincibles, and to
scatter them, but what can one woman do against
twenty armed men? They have defied me, and

declare that they are organized to protect their
homes at the expense of their lives, if need be.
Now, Concord is taking just the course to cause
trouble and arouse the Invincibles to something
overt and desperate. I was going to ask you to

use your influence with your fellow townsmen and
see if you could not impress upon them the ex
pediency of a more conciliatory attitude. And

now you tell me that you have no influence I
am very sorry to hear that, for I have grave fears
of the Invincibles. If only—”
Miss Betty was interrupted by a quavering

shout, instantly followed by fiercer yells in voices
of stronger timbre. Guy's heart leaped into his
throat and he whirled about in the direction from
which the sounds came.

138

His Friend the Enemy

“This is a trap for us, Betty 1" cried Miss
Pinkney in startled tones. “Oh, mercy! What
shall we do? They're Concord people !”
Miss Pinkney was right as to the newcomers
being Concord people, but wrong, terribly wrong,
in suggesting such a thing as a trap.
Bilkins, Glimmer and Pettibone were dashing
across the stretch of treeless plain straight to
ward them. They looked most formidable, espe
cially the sheriff, whose whole manner suggested
the avenging Nemesis of fabled origin.
“And this,” cried Miss Betty, passionate re
proach in her every tone, “this is your doing, Mr.
Herbert | Your base plot will fail, but I shall
never forget it, never, never!”
She cut her horse with the whip and the animal
sprang away so swiftly that Miss Betty's becom

ing hat was jerked from her fair head and fell to
the bottom of the carriage.

As for Guy, he was stricken dumb in his tracks.
He could say nothing, do nothing,-simply stand
where he was and watch the carriage disappear
on one hand and the shouting and angry trio
advance on the other.

What untimely fate had brought Bilkins and
Glimmer to the sheriff's rescue and made possible
this awful finale?

Guy was soon to know.

CHAPTER XIII
THE COLONEL’S “INDICTMENT.’”

As they drew close to Guy, Bilkins, Glimmer and

Pettibone separated, surrounded him and pressed
cautiously in from three points of the compass.
When within a dozen feet of the young man the
sheriff threw up his right hand. This was a pre

arranged signal for the attacking force to halt for
a parley.

“If you try to resist us, Herbert,” said Petti
bone menacingly, “you'll be mighty sorry for it
before we get through. I'm a good feller, as I
said, but even a good feller is generally able to
tell when he's got enough.”
“Where did Bilkins and Glimmer come from ?”

inquired Guy.

“We circled around back to get our horses,”
spoke up Glimmer.
“We didn’t know but those two Harmony chaps
might still be here,” admitted Bilkins artlessly,
“so we did our circlin’ t'other side the swell and

out of sight. My, I thought I was a goner, sure,
te-he-hel My legs were about ten feet too short,
and goodness knows they're plenty long for most
occasions. The Colonel's runnin' yet.”
I39

I 4o

His Friend the Enemy

“If I didn’t know the Colonel so well,” said
Glimmer, “I should think he was a coward. But
a man who saw so much slaughter in our late

war couldn't be that. I wasn't afraid myself”—
Glimmer glared through his iron-rimmed glasses—
“and I just ran after the Colonel to see if I
couldn't persuade him to come back.” He shook
his fist in the direction of Harmony. “If I ever
meet that Cap'n Blue alone—” But words

proved powerless and he finished with an ominous
frown and shake of the head.

“Oh, yes,” commented Pettibone sarcastically,
“if you ever get at Cap'n Blue I suppose there

won't be anything left but splinters. Will you
surrender, Herbert, or have we got to close in on

you?”
“I have a half notion to close in on you,” re
turned Guy irritably. “You’ve made a pretty
mess of this ! Those ladies are positive now that
I had the three of you lying in ambush.”
“I don't care what they think,” answered the

sheriff. “I’d probably be lying over there yet if
Bilkins and Glimmer hadn't passed near enough
to hear me call to them.

You'll have to be locked

up after this.”
“Try to lock me up and you may find you’ve
caught a Tartar,” retorted Guy. “Because I have
submitted peaceably to your surveillance, that is

no sign I do not know my rights. I’ve broken no
law and if you try any highhanded measures I'll
make this county too hot to hold you fellows. If

The Colonel’s “Indictment”

necessary, I'll have a company of soldiers here to
protect me.”

“The Harmony Invincibles, I suppose,” sneered
Pettibone.

“No, sir; a company of regulars from Standing
Rock Or Fort Totten.”

“Think you didn't break any law when you

knocked my head against that tree root and tied
me up with a halter, eh?”
Pettibone rubbed the back of his head as he

said this and assumed such an injured air that
Guy had to laugh in spite of his vexation.
Lem Bilkins te-he'd once more, Glimmer unbent
himself so far as to smile, and Pettibone, who

always had a laugh lurking somewhere close to

the surface, was caught in the general hilar
ity.

“Anyway,” qualified the sheriff, “there ain’t
going to be much fun in this for you, Herbert. Of
course, you haven’t broken any of the statutes,
but the Concord folks won’t stop to think of
that.”

“Well, I’ve an idea that I can take care of my
self,” said Guy.

“I have told you once or twice

and I tell you again, I haven't done anything
treasonable and I’m just as loyal to Concord as
Col. Keever himself.”

Glimmer and Bilkins exchanged sly glances
tittered suggestively. Guy kindled at this
said nothing and went with Pettibone to help
back the horse and carriage out of the brush.

the time they were started, Glimmer and Bilkins
were two galloping specks on the horizon.
“You’re pretty powerful in a set-to,” observed

Pettibone, driving with one hand and stroking
the back

of his head with the

Other.

“Your

looks are deceivin', Herbert.”
“Perhaps the rest of the Concord people will
-

find that out if they take too arbitrary a course,”
said Guy significantly.
“I was only trying to do my duty and you
treated me a little bit rough,” continued etti
bone, “but I know how it is. A pair of blue eyes
has bewitched more than one young feller, and
I'm not going to lay up anything against you. I
don’t think you’d be such a fool as to help Har

mony at the expense of Concord, knowingly, but
Miss Betty is pretty cute. She's coddlin' you

along just to find out what our side is doing,
and—”

“You’re mistaken l” cried Guy, so sharply and
suddenly that Pettibone gave a startled jump and
then settled back in his seat with a low whistle.

“Miss Vlandingham is far above any such double
dealing as that.”
The sheriff shook his head hopelessly.

“That's exactly the way it strikes in,” he mut
tered.

“I had the same kind of a spell and got

so ethereal I didn’t want to eat or do a blessed

thing but write poetry. If Matilda had told me
grasshoppers were butterflies or that jimson pods
were lilies of the valley, I'd have fought with the

The Colonel’s “Indictment”

I43

man who called 'em by their right names. That
was before we got married, though; now it's
different.”

“What are you talking about, Pettibone?”
The sheriff laid a hand on his heart and winked.

“That little chap with a pair of wings and a
bow and arrow has been getting in his work on

you, and he's hit you so fair and square that
everybody can see it.”
“Pshaw !” exclaimed Guy, coloring.

“Don’t

talk nonsense.”

“I’m not. Betty Vlandingham is a fine girl,
but she's on the other side o’ the fence.

She

bosses her father and her father bosses the town,

consequently things go about as she says over in
Harmony. But looket here, Herbert”—the sheriff
dropped his hand lightly on Guy's knee-“’twon’t
do for you to be meeting her. As far as I’m per

sonally concerned, I think you're true as a die,
and I don't lay up anything against you on ac
count of that crack on the head and your work
with the halter. There are others, though, who

won’t think as I do when they”—he nodded his
head towards the little column of dust far in ad

vance—“strike C neord. They'll publish your
meeting with Miss Vlandingham from one end of
town to the other.

And what will be the result?”

He shook his head seriously. “I hate to think of
it, I do, for a fact. You musn't meet that girl
again, Herbert—at least not before the election.”
“Small chance of my ever meeting her again,”

I44

His Friend the Enemy

said Guy in angry discontent. “She sent a line to
me, as I told you, asking me to come alone and
meet her and Miss Pinkney. Now she thinks I'm

a treacherous hound, who disregarded her request
and brought you and Glimmer and Bilkins—con
found them l—along with me.”
Much bitterness of spirit was manifested in Guy's
voice, and the sheriff gave him his earnest attention.
“You’ll have plenty of chances to explain,” said

he, “and when Betty Vlandingham finds out how
she has wronged you she'll think all the more of
you. Oh, I know 'em ! 'Twas that way with me

and Matilda. Why, we used to quarrel every few
days before we got married, and now look at us!
Hitched, by gee, and quarrelin' all the time.”
Pettibone chuckled to himself.

“You leave Vlan

dingham's girl alone until we win this election,
then waltz over to Harmony and tell her you
want to give her a dower interest in your town.
She'll snap you up too quick, see if she don't.”
On reaching Concord, Guy went with Pettibone

to put up his horse, and then they made for the
hotel. Passing the Emporium they saw Mr.
Glimmer inside holding forth to a small and select
gathering of citizens. Farther on, in front of the
drug store, was Lem Bilkins, likewise engaged.
When Guy and Pettibone passed the second group,

Bilkins hushed his excited discourse, and every
man to whom he had been speaking turned a

glaring eye in Guy's direction.
“It's very evident,” remarked Guy, “that I'm a

The Colonel’s “Indictment”

I45

prophet without honor in my own town. Before
long, however, every one in Concord will see how
greatly he was mistaken.”
“I hope they'll see that before they do anything
to be sorry for,” muttered Pettibone.
Guy did not hear this and perhaps it was just
as well.

They had supper—a late supper of the kind
which Pedro Smith husbanded for stragglers—
and during the meal, and afterward as they sat
smoking in the office, the sheriff continually mani
fested the nervousness of his state of mind.

The

slightest noise would startle him. Once, at a

whirr of wheels in the street, he sprang up and
ran to the door, returning in a few moments pale
and fidgety.
“What's the matter with you, Pettibone?”

inquired Guy.
“I’m expecting something and am afraid it's
going to come.”
“What is it?”

“A delegation of citizens looking for you.”
Guy laughed.
“That's giving you more concern that it is me.

Suppose we go to bed? If the delegation arrives
after that I hardly think they will dare to disturb
us.”

The indignation committee, if such it might be
called, did not put in an appearance that night,
nor the next morning. Late in the afternoon of
the following day, however, as Guy was seated at
IO

146

His Friend the Enemy

the writing table in the hotel office, struggling
with a letter of explanation which he designed
sending to Miss Betty, five representative citizens
presented themselves.

“Gee!” murmured Pettibone despairingly; “here
they are, Herbert.”
Mr. Pinney, the druggist, was one of them; and

Mr. Leffingwell, proprietor of the livery stable;
and Mr. Glimmer, of the Emporium; and Mr.
Biggs, the register of deeds—carrying a tin box
and, last if not least, the redoubtable Colonel.

The redoubtable Colonel had had twenty-four
hours in which to recover his equipoise and he
had succeeded admirably.

To look at him now,

his white hat tipped slightly over his right eye,
the tip of his cane planted firmly on the office
floor, one foot thrown over the other, his frock
coat caught together with the two lower buttons
and his left hand thrust into his bosom—to look

at him thus, he gave no suggestion of his wild

struggle and exhausting footrace of the preceding
afternoon.

Guy minced into fine fragments the dozenth
sheet on which he had tried to write, threw the
pieces into a waste basket and turned upon the
gentlemen who were grouped beside him. He
noted their grim and determined looks and there

fell a portentous silence.
“The wolf's legs performed excellent service yes
terday afternoon,” remarked Guy, by way of
breaking the ice.

The Colonel’s “Indictment”

147

“We have not come here to discuss that par
ticular wolf, sir,” answered the Colonel, with an
uneasy side glance in the direction of his friends.
“Another wolf is the object of this call, a wolf in
sheep's clothing, sir! A wolf with the outward

guise of a loyal gentleman but with a heart
of—”

“Softly l’’ interrupted Guy. “Don’t forget how
I bumped you against the partition the other
day. If you made me very angry, Colonel, I
might do more than that.”
The Colonel's bosom began to heave. It was
the wolf, probably, seeking to get out, and show
its white teeth, and snap. But the wolf did no
more than shake its chain, for the Colonel calmed

the brute after a prodigious effort.
“Sir,” went on the Colonel huskily, “you are
young and I will bear with you. I am heading
this delegation, this righteously indignant delega
tion, more in sorrow than in anger. We have an
indictment against you and I will read it, count

by count.” Mr. Glimmer handed the Colonel a
paper and the latter continued: “You are
charged, Mr. Herbert, with treasonable conduct
which gravely imperils the interests of this town.
Specifically, the counts are as follows:
“First; a visit to Vlandingham's house on Mon

day evening last. Have you anything to say?”
Guy shook his head.
“Second; you are also charged with assisting
Vlandingham's daughter when she was among us

148

His Friend the Enemy

disguised as a Sister of Charity. Incidentally
you must also have aided in the escape of Dingle.
Will you deny this?”
Guy did not answer.
“Third; you attempted to communicate with

the enemy yesterday afternoon, your telegram
being stopped in transmission by myself.”
“By you !” cried Guy, half starting from his
chair. “What business had the telegraph operator
holding that message on anybody's order but my
own?”

“I told him you desired it held.”
Guy had a fiery temper and it was hard for him
to keep it in bounds. Emboldened by his silence
the Colonel proceeded.

“Fourth; you met the enemy yesterday after
noon and knocked the sheriff senseless and bound

him fast in order that you might carry on your
conversation with no loyal Concordian at hand
to overhear. These are the charges, Mr. Herbert.
Have you still nothing to say?”
“I have this to say,” answered Guy. “From

this moment, Col. Keever, you may consider your
self discharged from the service of the Townsite
Company.”

“You are not the whole town, young man,”
said the Colonel. “You are ready to dispense
with my services, but are these other gentlemen”
-he turned to his companions—“whose interests
are quite as completely wrapped up in this town
as are yours?”

The Colonel’s “Indictment”

I49

“We want you to manage the affairs for us,
Colonel,” spoke up Glimmer. “Mr. Herbert may
think it policy to try to get along without you,
but we are of another opinion.”

The register of deeds, the liveryman and the
druggist agreed fully with Mr. Glimmer.
“So you see, Mr. Herbert,” resumed the Colonel
blandly, “I am still at the helm. Harmony has
organized a military company for the avowed pur
pose, as we think, of marching over here and

taking the county-seat records by force. How far
your treasonable conduct has helped this plot
along we naturally have no means of knowing,
but we are taking steps to prevent any catastro
phe. Our court-house is roofed over and enclosed,

and Mr. Biggs will take the records”—the Colonel
struck with his cane the tin box carried by the

register of deeds—“to the building. I will lock
myself in with the documents and guard them all
night—at the expense of my life, if need be. As

for you, Mr. Herbert, you may either leave town
at once or walk with us to the jail.”
“I’ll not leave town until I get ready to go,”

replied Guy, defiantly, “and if you put me under
lock and key I'll break out at the first oppor
tunity.”

This was the young man's final word. He did
not resist when piloted across the street by the
committee and quietly permitted himself to be
conducted to the room over the drug store and

locked within it. Fresh bedding for the cot was

I 5o

His Friend the Enemy

brought from the hotel and Guy passed a com
fortable night in spite of the fact that he was a
prisoner.

A storm of wind, rain, thunder and lightning
raged during the night but the young man slept
through it all to be finally awakened by unwonted
noises in the street and by the ringing of Mr.
Glimmer's bell.

Springing from the cot he began hastily to
dress. It was broad daylight and the sun was an

hour high. Snatches of loud and excited conver
sation floated up from the street, and through
the one barred window Guy could catch glimpses
of men darting here and there, afoot and on horse
back, while the bell continued its alarming clamor.
What was up, anyway?
Just as he finished dressing, a key grated in the
lock, the door was thrown open and Christopher
Waffle ran in. The Judge wore a whimsical look
although it was plain that he was greatly agi
tated.

“What's the matter, Judge?” asked Guy.
“The Old Boy himself! Harmony made a raid
on us last night.”
“Did they get away with the records?”

“Did they?” Waffle laughed jerkily. “They
didn't stop at the records, but took the Colonel
and the court-house along with 'em.”
“What!”

“I say that that brand new court-house is gone,
slick and clean. As the Colonel was inside of it,

The Colonel’s “Indictment”

I5I

guarding the records, and is nowhere in evidence
this morning, the surmise is that he was stolen
along with the court-house and the papers. Gee

whittaker ! Did you ever hear anything to beat
it?”

CHAPTER XIV
THE FIRST VICTIM

“Aren't you joking, Waffle?” asked Guy, whose
credulity was sorely taxed by the Judge's state
ment.

“This is altogether too serious a matter to joke
about. Concord can spare Keever just as well as
not, but it's a big loss to have the records and
the court-house stolen. I guess we'll have to tally
one for Harmony this innings.”
“This explains what Vlandingham said to
Pinchbeck,” said Guy, reflectively.
“What was that?”

“Why, that fools build court-houses and wise
men occupy them.”

“That's about what it amounts to. Harmony
has the laugh on us now, and if you run this
thing to earth, I'll bet you find Vlandingham's
daughter at the other end of it. She's the only
one in Harmony who'd be able to hatch up such
a scheme.”

Guy remembered how he had seen Miss Betty in
the court-house, a tape line in her hand, jotting
down something in a note-book.

It flashed over

him, at that moment, that she had been taking
I 53

I 54

His Friend the Enemy

measurements with the view of consummating
this coup.
“How was it done, Judge?” queried Guy.

“Easy enough. The Harmony folks manufac
tured a pair of long axles and swung each one
between a couple of low, broad-tired wheels. There
was a storm last night, if you remember, and
that was exactly what the other side wanted.
The noise of the thunder, and the wind and the
rain drowned out the commotion they made, so
that no one in this town heard them—unless it

was Keever, and they very soon took care of him,

I'll guarantee. After they had lifted the court
house with jackscrews, they slid the wheels under
it, front and rear, and then hitched several teams
of horses to it and hauled it away. You can see
the tracks of the wheels where they sank into the

wet ground. Pettibone and several more, armed
to the teeth, have started along the south trail
at a gallop. But they'll have their trouble for
their pains, mark me.

Here's a notice that was

left sticking on a post near the court-house site,
and it's what I call adding insult to injury with
a vengeance.”

The Judge took from his pocket very carefully a
wet and bedraggled scrap of paper on which was
written the following:
“To The People of Concord, Greeting: We needed
a court-house to go with the weather-vane, so we

thought we'd take yours. Now if you will please

I 55

The First Victim

build us a coal shed to go with the court-house,
you will greatly oblige,
“The People of Harmony.”
“How's that for a

blow

between the ribs?”

asked Waffle, as he returned the paper to his
pocket.
“It's a terrible set-back,” said Guy. Notwith
-

standing the financial peril with which this success
of the opposition threatened him, the humor of
the situation appealed to the young man and he
sat down on the cot and laughed till he choked.
“If we don’t look out for those fellows, Waffle,”

he observed, finally, “they'll come over here and
steal the town.

I wish some one would go my

bail so I could get out and do a little looking
around.”

-

“I’ve come to let you out on your own recog
nizance, Herbert.”
“How's that?”

“I’m doing it on my own responsibility. You
see, I told the indignation committee that if they
kept you a prisoner they'd have to bring you up
for trial. After the way I threw the law into Lis

comb they're afraid to have me try your case and
so they said they'd keep you a prisoner until
after the election. That isn’t the law the way I
read it, and as Pettibone is chasing after the

court-house and as I’ve got a key to this room, I
thought this would be a good time to let you
scamper. The people have got their heads so full
of other things they won't be able to think of you

156

His Friend the Enemy

for a while and I'd advise you to go some place

Jimtown, or Bismarck, or anywhere else you want
to—and stay for a few days until the suspicions
and hard feeling against you have a chance to
blow Over.”

“I’ll do it,” said Guy, and shook Waffle's hand
gratefully. “If you hadn't released me, though,
I'd have escaped from here in some way before
many hours had passed. I'm going to Amity
ville to see if I can’t win a few votes for Concord.”

“You’ll take the risk for nothing, I'm afraid.”
“What risk is there?” .

“Well, Abe Landy rules the roost in Amityville,
and Vlandingham has made himself so solid with
Landy that they’re all red-hot for Harmony. If
you go there, however, take my advice and stop
with Landy. He's a miserly old sinner but he's
the most fair-minded of any one in the town.”
“Thanks; I'll remember the name.”

Guy followed the Judge from the room, down the
stairs and out into the street. The wild clangor

of the bell had ceased, and the excited shoutings,
the grind of carriage and wagon wheels and the
fierce tattoo of hoofs had given place to a church

yard quiet. There were many people on the
street but their hats were pulled moodily down
over their brows and they conversed with one
another in hushed tones. The stunning effects of
the calamity had set in.

Going over to the Lisbon House, Guy passed
through the deserted office to the dining room.

The First Victim

I 57

A waiter served him his breakfast in an agitated
and absent-minded manner, and when the young
man had finished his meal he went up to his room,
packed a few articles in a satchel and then left the

hotel and made his way to the livery stable.
There were many citizens clustered about the site
of the court-house, but they vouchsafed Guy no
attention whatever. Lem Bilkins was there, sit
ting forlornly on one of the four posts that had
supported the stolen building. Mr. Biggs, the
register of deeds, was circling sadly about the
spot, bewailing the loss of his records. Mr. Glim

mer, reposing on the steps of the Emporium, was
cleaning a huge, old-fashioned horse pistol, pausing
now and again in his work to glare across the

street through his heavy-rimmed glasses. Chil
dren were as hopelessly cast down as were their
elders and even the dogs took upon themselves the

general air of dejection.
Another stable-boy had been employed in the
place of Barney. His name was Herkimer and he
had wandered into Concord, as he expressed it,

“on his uppers.” Leffingwell. had immediately
hired him and put him to work. Being a new
comer, Herkimer had not had time to acquire any

of the prejudices of the town. Not knowing Guy
from Adam, he made ready a saddle horse without
question, and the young man, after swinging his
satchel from the saddle-horn, mounted and gath
ered up the reins.

“Please tell Mr. Leffingwell that I may not be

158

His Friend the Enemy
*

back for two or three days,” said he, “as I am
leaving Concord on business appertaining to the
county-seat.”

“What name?” inquired the new hand.
“Herbert.”

“Wait ! Stop! I don’t think you can have
that horse !” cried the hostler, who was familiar
with Guy's name if not with his face.

But Guy was well away by this time, and gave
no heed to Herkimer's summons.

There were two roads leading to Amityville.
The shortest road paralleled the railroad track
and led directly through Harmony. In order to
follow this route it would have been necessary for
Guy to traverse the main street of Concord and
bear west from the depot. He did not care to do
this, or to run the risk of being halted in Har
mony, so he debouched southward along the

other road and ambled toward Amityville by way
of Lake Elizabeth.

This latter course had been the one taken by the
men who had spirited away the court-house and

Guy saw, stretching out before him, the broad,
deep wheel-marks of the gigantic truck which had
been improvised by the Harmonyites.

When near Lake Elizabeth he suddenly glimpsed
half a dozen horsemen galloping rapidly towards
him.

It was too late to beat a retreat, or to

gain unnoticed the friendly shelter of the trees on
the bank of the lake. He had been so deep in his
thoughts that the horsemen were within a short

The First Victim

I 59

quarter of a mile of him before he discovered their
approach.
He was soon able to distinguish Pettibone, and

Pinney, and Leffingwell, but the remaining three
were unknown to him. Drawing rein he quietly
waited.

“Thunder !” shouted the sheriff; “it’s Herbert.”
The next moment Guy was surrounded by six

angry and baffled men.
“Well, gentlemen,” said Guy, his eyes twinkling,
“did you find the court-house?”

“You be blamed !” returned Pettibone, sourly.
“How did you get out?”
“That doesn’t matter, Pettibone. I'm out,
and that's enough. As you gentlemen appear to

be in anything but an agreeable frame of mind,
kindly ride out of my way and let me pass on.”

“Not much !” cried Pinney. “You’ve escaped
and you’ve got to go back with us.”
“That's the ticket,” said Leffingwell, glancing
sharply at the horse Guy was riding.
The three others, whom Guy did not know, were
equally as positive that he should go back to
Concord.

Pettibone knotted his brows over the

problem but said nothing.

His horse stood di

rectly in front of Guy's and as he reflected he
snapped his quirt absently against his boot-leg.
“Hear me a minute, gentlemen,” said Guy. “I
don’t want to have a clash and I'm sure every

thing will be pleasant between us if you’ll only be
reasonable. Yesterday I was given my choice

~~~~~~

16o

His Friend the Enemy

either of leaving town or being locked up. I
didn’t care to leave town then but I'm willing to
do so now. Why do you want to stop me?”
“Yesterday we had the court-house,” blurted out

Leffingwell, “and to-day the other people have
got it.

That makes all the difference in the world.

You've assisted the other people and I suppose
you want to go over there and help them cele

brate. I, for one, am in favor of taking you back
to Concord and treating you as you deserve.”

“So am I,’” seconded Pinney.
The rest were of the same mind, even the sheriff
joining in with them.
As Pettibone voiced his agreement with his com

panions, he flashed Guy a meaning glance and the
quirt flew awkwardly from his hand. Dismount
ing, the sheriff led his horse aside and bent to

pick up the whip.
This made a breach in the cordon that sur

rounded the young man and left the road, for the
moment, clear before him. In a trice he inter
preted Pettibone's look and dug his heels into his

horse's sides. The animal sprang away like a
shaft from a bow.

“Stop!” roared Pinney, but he might as well

have ordered the wind to cease blowing.
“Stop or I'll shoot!” shouted Leffingwell, draw
ing a revolver from his pocket and sighting it
quickly.

Still Guy did not halt and Pettibone knocked
the liveryman's arm downward before he could fire.

The First Victim

I6 I

“None of that, Leffingwell !” cried the sheriff.
“Chase after him, that's the thing to do.”
Thereupon the six of them had recourse to their

spurs and quirts.
The horses of the pursuers had seen hard ser
-

vice that morning and were at a disadvantage.
Guy's mount, on the contrary, was comparatively
fresh, and he could see, by the hasty glances which
he occasionally threw over his shoulder, that he
was slowly increasing the distance that separated
him from those behind.

There was a point where the road forked, one
branch leading on to Amityville and the other

turning sharply in the direction of Harmony.
Pursued and pursuers were drawing close to this

point. Guy's attention was taken up by those
behind and Pettibone and his companions had

eyes for no one but the young man in front. Thus
it happened that a large contingent of mounted
men, spurring swiftly along the Harmony road,
failed to capture the notice of those on the other
trail.

Realization was brought suddenly home to the
Concordians by a terrific yell from the Har
monyites. Pettibone and his friends drew rein,
panic-stricken, and whirled to flee.

Capt. Blue was coming at the head of his In
vincibles, a score at least, and the sun shimmered
upon the polished gun barrels that lay across
their saddles.

Guy was between two fires. As it made little
II

162

His Friend the Enemy

difference to him which way he went, he kept
straight on.
He saw several of the Invincibles

raise their

guns to their shoulders. Instantly he threw up
his hand.

“Don’t shoot!” he cried, thinking the weapons
were aimed at him.

“I’m unarmed !”

At that precise juncture a report came from be
hind him and a bullet sang past his ear. He
turned in his saddle to launch a threat and a

warning at Pettibone and his men and, just as he

did so, a spiteful volley leaped from the muzzles
of the levelled guns ahead.

Guy felt a sharp sting in his side as though a
knife-point had pricked him.
“Stop shooting !” he cried again, and the quiv

ering impotence of his voice amazed him. “Stop
shooting or you’ll kill somebody !”

He had in

tended to make the shout a lusty one but it was
scarcely more than a whisper.

Everything in his line of vision began to reel.
The horsemen in front became tangled in a maze.
He raised himself in his stirrups, pressed both
hands over the burning spot in his side and then

pitched head foremost from his saddle.

CHAPTER XV
“SUAVITER IN MODO”

On the night Col. Keever guarded the county
records, he took with him into the court-house a

Winchester rifle and a pint flask. Kentucky born
and bred, it is to be presumed that he was as

familiar with one of these weapons as he was with
the other.

Be that as it may, however, it is cer

tain that he fortified his courage to such an ex
tent that he slept soundly throughout all the

operations connected with the moving of the
building.
So level was the road leading from the court
house site in Concord to the vacant square in
Harmony, and so skilfully did the enemy work,
that Col. Keever, if he realized anything at all,
could only think that the storm was most furious

and that this half-finished structure was sadly in
need of underpinning.

A never-to-be-forgotten picture he presented to
Capt. Blue and his Invincibles, who did the work
connected with the moving. In the light of an
occasional lightning flash the Colonel could be
viewed at leisure by any one who wished to walk
along beside the solitary window and peer into the
163

164

His Friend the Enemy

single unfinished room which the building con
tained.

The great man was lying upon a cot in such a
way as to reveal the noble proportions of his
platonic brow. Under the cot was the tin box
containing the precious records and close beside
the cot lay the empty flask. The Colonel's pillow
partly covered the rifle, only the stock and muzzle
of the weapon being in evidence. As the Colonel
slept he smiled—smiled condescendingly in that
superior manner which was a part of him. He
was dreaming dreams, no doubt, and pleasant
O11eS.

It was late in the morning when the awakening
came. The rain had ceased, the clouds had dis
pelled and a burst of June sun trailed in through

an eastern window. The Colonel stirred restlessly,
opened his eyes and yawned. The melancholy
gaze he vouchsafed the empty flask changed to a
look of pride as his eyes took in the box of records,
all intact. It would have taken an army corps to
separate him from those documents.

Suddenly a startling thought darted through
his brain and he jerked spasmodically and blinked
in his bewilderment. Then he lay quite still,
thinking. What business had the morning sun

shining through a western window? The court
house, at the present stage, had only one glazed

opening and nothing but a blank wall on its
eastern side.

What did this mean?

The Colonel

rubbed his forehead. Was it possible that he had

“Suaviter in Modo”

165

slept into the afternoon and that the sun was

descending instead of rising? He got up and hur
riedly dressed himself.

Then he walked to the

window. Merciful powers | There were iron bars
across the outside of it! The mystery deepened.
As he stood there staring, lo! the face of Dingle,
of the hated Dingle, appeared and looked in at
him.

The Colonel staggered against the wall and
caught his head in his hands. Was this a hideous

dream or was it reality? Dingle remained at the
window but spoke no word.

All he did was to

grin, in a sarcastic way, and draw the lid partly
down over his glass eye.
That half-wink broke the spell. With a roar, the

Colonel rushed to the cot and caught up the
Winchester.

“Villain l” he cried, tossing the gun to his shoul
der.

“Your insolence has

overshot the mark |

You have dared to come into this town again and
this time I’ve got you. Egad, we'll teach you a
lesson now that you won't soon forget.”
Once more Dingle drew down the left eyelid.
The Winchester seemed to have no terrors for him

and the Colonel's fury passed all bounds. He
pulled the trigger—not with the intention to slay
but merely to frighten and to arouse the town.
There was a sharp click, but no report. The
Colonel “pumped” the lever and tried again but
with like result. Then Dingle found his tongue.
“Don’t excite yourself, Keever,” said he.

166

His Friend the Enemy

“Capt. Blue unloaded the magazine of that gun
last night.”
“Gad!” yelled the Colonel.

“Blue is here, too,

is he? And he came in on me last night and
tampered with my rifle !”

its strongest.

He lifted his voice to

“Up, Concordians ! Hello! Hey!

The enemy, the enemy l’”

As he finished he hurled the Winchester at Dingle
and the resonant call ended in a crash of glass.
Keever sprang to the door. The key had been
removed from the inside of the lock and the door

did not respond to his furious pull. He hurled
himself upon it and struggled like a demon. So
furious was the onslaught that the knob came
away and the great man was precipitated to the
floor. A laugh floated in from the window. Gain
ing his feet after an elephantine tussle, he braced
himself in a corner and turned his gleaming eyes
upon the barred opening. Dingle had been joined
by others whose heads were crowded together
in the narrow space; and when the Colonel
had recognized Capt. Blue, Mr. Boomer, Major

Harp, Vlandingham, Barney and a few more, his
brain became dizzy and he staggered to the cot.

Dropping down there he buried his face in his
hands.

Had it come to this? Was he finally bewitched
by the spirits of Kentucky bourbon? He had
been a hard drinker all his life, but so had his
father been before him and he had died in his

ninetieth year, of a palsy. Rising on the cot, the

“Suaviter in Modo”

167

Colonel brought an impulsive heel down on the
empty flask.
“I don’t know who you are, or where I am,” he

said hoarsely, peering at the grinning faces in the
window, “but if there's a doctor among you, send
him to me. I'm going mad-I must be.”
“Eat this and you'll feel better,” said Barney,

pushing through the bars a pasteboard box filled
with eatables.

The Colonel got up and walked unsteadily
across the room.

“Liscomb,” he murmured, “step up to the
office and tell Sampson I want him.”

“Step up !” exclaimed Barney. “It’s quite a
step, Colonel—seven miles if it's a foot. You're in
Harmony, don’t you know that?”
“Harmony l’” gasped the Colonel; “how can
that be?”

“Well,” drawled Capt. Blue, “we moved the
whole shebang over last night, during the storm.

As you happened to be inside, we brought you
along.”
That took the wind completely out of the Col
onel's sails. Very humbly he received the box of
luncheon out of Barney's hands, went back to the
cot, turned his face from the crowd and sat down.
He ate the food and as he ate he reflected.
Here was a masterstroke, indeed ! Beside this

that affair of the weather-vane paled into utter
insignificance. The Colonel had known all along
that Harmony was meditating some coup. It was

I68

His Friend the Enemy

for the purpose of discovering what this was that
he had prevailed upon Guy to come to Harmony
and attend the town meeting. Although the theft
of the weather-vane had chagrined the Colonel, it
had lulled his suspicions, for he believed that that
had been the contemplated stroke. What an
awakening he now had ' The records were stolen,
the court-house was stolen, and he himself had been
carried along with the rest of the plunder.

During that forenoon all Harmony came to
look into the Concord court-house and gloat over

the prisoner. Citizens, male and female, young
and old, felicitated themselves and cried uncharit

able things at the crushed and melancholy man
who had been the head and front of all offending
against them. The Colonel kept his back to the
window, held his peace in the face of great provo
cation and waited patiently to learn what was to
be done with him.

The afternoon was marked by a dearth of curi

osity seekers. No one came to the window and it
was possible for the prisoner to rise and pace the
room, without running a gauntlet of scoffs and

gibes. While he was thus wandering about his
prison, the key scraped in the lock and the other
half of the knob-which had fallen outside—was

thrust through the mechanism. The catch was
turned, the door opened and Isaac Dingle stepped

fearlessly in. Keever rushed at him like a whirl
wind, but halted in trepidation at sight of a
quickly displayed revolver. By a chance, Col.

“Suaviter in Modo”

169

Dingle's natural eye and its artificial counterpart
were both fixed on the prisoner.
“Careful !” warned the rival editor.

“I have

not come here in anger, Col. Keever, but as a

messenger of peace. I wish to ask you to let
bygones be bygones. The wheel of fortune has
turned against you, but we are both editors and
the art preservative is the tie that should bind us

in good fellowship. I am here to extend a frater
nal hand and a helpful one. Shall we bury the
hatchet and smoke the pipe of peace?”
Col. Keever was astounded.

There must be an

ulterior purpose back of this show of friendliness.
That was certain. It was equally certain, to

Keever's mind, that he had everything to gain
and nothing to lose by meeting Dingle half way
in these amicable overtures. As Dingle switched
his revolver to his left hand he extended his right,
Col. Keever grasping it with great show of cor
diality.
“It is not my nature, sir,” said the great man,
“to cherish animosity. True, you behold me now

at the depth of my fortunes, but always and ever
you will find me suaviter in modo, fortiter in re.”
No one could say a fine thing more finely, and
this delicate bit, culled by the Colonel from the

back of his dictionary in a leisure hour, was ren
dered with a voice and gesture that brought ad
miration into Dingle's eyes—even the glass eye.
The little man put away his revolver and they
both took seats on the cot.

“The uncomplaining manner in which you are
bearing this reverse,” said Dingle, “has touched
me most profoundly.”
“I can bear as well as forbear,” returned Col.
Keever.

“I see you can, Colonel, and it's that which

shows your inherent nobility. You are not the
only Concord man whom the Harmony people
have in their midst.”

Being of the old school,

Col. Dingle clung to some of its platitudes.
“Another of your fellow townsmen has experienced
the misfortunes of war.”
“Another Concordian in this town '' exclaimed
Keever.

“Not in town, exactly, but out at Whittaker's,
and being cared for by one of our men.”
“To whom do you refer?”
“To Mr. Guy Herbert.”
“He is not a Concord man, sir; he inclines more
towards Harmony than towards his own town.”
“What do you mean by that?”
“Every Samson has his Delilah,” was the other's

gloomy and significant response. “Herbert has
deserted to you?”

“No; some of your people chased him out of
Concord and pursued him into a company of Har
monyites. Shots were fired. Mr. Herbert was
hit—”
“Hit !

Not killed?”

“No, no; just wounded, that's all. But isn't
that enough? The affair might have been in

“Suaviter in Modo”

171

finitely worse. If any one gets killed during this
squabble the Governor of the Territory will take a
hand and it will go hard with all of us. Miss

Vlandingham saw the shooting this morning and
when Herbert dropped from his horse, she rode up
to him, dismounted in a twinkling and raised his
head. She was pale as death, and how she did
lecture us! She would have no violence, no blood

shed, she declared, and she would have something
to say to all of us after Mr. Herbert had been
attended to. The something she had on her mind

was spoken only a little while ago and to nearly
every man in town,-all of us having been sum
moned to her father's house for the purpose. I
can't tell you all she said, but reconciliation is the
order of the day. The fight for the county-seat is
to continue just as vigorously but, if it can pos
sibly be, Miss Vlandingham desires that the strug
gle for supremacy shall be a good-natured one.”
“It can’t be,” declared Keever, “so long as you
have the court-house.”

“It's a young woman's dream, that's what it
is, an unsubstantial fancy. Matters in this town,
however, are run about as Miss Vlandingham de
sires. We wouldn't give up this court-house,

though, even if she should order us to do so.”
“Then the bitterness will continue, sir, mark

my words.”
“With me, that was a foregone conclusion.
Nevertheless, I was told off by Miss Vlandingham

to inaugurate her new policy. I have reconciled

172

His Friend the Enemy

myself with you and am now to drive you back
to Concord, or as near Concord as I dare to
go.”
“I am free?” asked Col. Keever.

“You are. My horse and gig are out in front.”
“Do I take the records back with me?”
“You do not.”

Col. Keever sighed.

“In accepting my liberty at your hands,

said

he, “understand that I make no promises.”
“That is understood. Miss Vlandingham pre
sents her compliments, however, and hopes that

you will persuade your fellow citizens to accept the
olive branch which she holds out to them on be

half of Harmony.”

“When Miss Vlandingham sends the olive branch
to Concord nailed to the court-house, I give my
word it will be accepted.” This from Col. Keever,

with dignity.
Dingle wagged his head decidedly and led the
way out of the building. Two minutes later the
red-wheeled gig was making record time in the
direction of Concord.

CHAPTER XVI
WHITTAKER'S “SHACK”

Of all life's mysteries the mystery of pain is the
most profound and baffling. Men on a battlefield

have been wounded most horribly and have yet
thought, at the first of it, that they were injured
only slightly, if at all.
It was so with Guy. When the bullet entered
his side his suffering was no more than would
have come from a pin-prick, and great was his
surprise to feel the quick weakness, the sudden
sapping of his strength, the dizzy whirl of every

thing about him. As he plunged headlong to the
ground the darkness closed in and left not the
faintest ray of reason.

This hiatus was not of long duration and for
some time before he opened his eyes he was con
scious of a gentle forward motion as though he
was being carried. Voices were borne to him, too
—the sturdy voices of men mingling with another,
soft and musical in spite of its undertone of in

dignation and reproof. The softer voice thrilled
him to his heart's core. He did not mind the pain
so much, although it was steady and intense.
The realization that Miss Betty was near was as a

balm to him, body and soul. Looking out from
I73

I 74

His Friend the Enemy

between his partly opened lids he discovered that
he was being carried on a blanket by six men.
Others of the company rode and led the horses of
those who were acting as bearers. A little to the
left was Capt. Blue, Miss Betty, mounted on a

fine, spirited horse, riding at his side.
“What right had you,” Miss Betty was saying,
“to ride out of Concord with these armed men?

What is your excuse for doing that, Capt. Blue?”
“We feared reprisals on account of the court

house,” answered the Captain stiffly, for to be
taken to task by Miss Betty was sorely against
the grain. “We were scouting, that's all. Just
scouting.”
“The moment I heard that you had trooped
out along the Concord road I galloped after you,”
went on Miss Betty. “Oh, I wish, I wish, I had
come up with you in time to prevent this terrible

meeting !” She looked toward Guy, poignant
regret showing in every line of her fair face.

“Mr.

Herbert would not have been hurt if I had.

I

have felt all along that something terrible would

happen before we secured our rights in this county
seat fight. I have tried my best to keep you
from violence and you, Capt. Blue, have disre

garded my expressed wish, my strongest com
mand.

Who was it fired the shot that wounded

Mr. Herbert?”

“The other side fired the first shot,” replied the
Captain, evasively.
“I know that, for I was close enough to see it.

-------------

Whittaker’s “Shack”

I75

But that shot did no harm, and was no excuse

for the fusillade which you returned. You were
three times the number of the other side and they
were fleeing as fast as their horses could carry
them. My question was not answered, Capt.
Blue. Can you tell me whose bullet struck Mr.
Herbert?”

“No one could tell you that, Miss Vlandingham.
A dozen shots were fired simultaneously and it
would be impossible to tell which did the work.”

“We will inquire into that later. I am going to
push on so as to have the doctor at our house
and to make ready for Mr. Herbert. See that you

bring him as quickly and as easily as you can.”
She darted from the Captain's side at top

speed and was quickly lost to sight.
“How is he getting along?” asked Capt. Blue,

riding close to the men who were carrying Guy.
“He hasn’t flicked an eyelid,” replied Barney,
who was one of the six and who imagined that he
had been watching Guy very closely.

“You’re mistaken, Barney,” spoke up Guy, his
eyes wide open.
“How do you feel, Herbert?” inquired the
Captain, in tones of great relief.
“As well as can be expected, Captain.” Guy lifted
himself slightly and saw that his coat and vest were
unbuttoned and that, tight across his wound and
over his blood-stained shirt had been bound a

scarf of silk.

“Whose house is that over there?”

he asked, pointing.

-

176

His Friend the Enemy

“That's Sile Whittaker's place,” answered the
Captain.
“Take me there, please,” said Guy, dropping
back on the blanket.

“We’ve got orders to carry you to Harmony, to
the Squire's,” returned the Captain.
“It seems to me that I am the one who ought
to be consulted,” murmured Guy, weakly.

He was in much pain, but he could probably
have weathered out the longer journey to the

Squire's had circumstances been different. Just
now he preferred any other haven than Willowview.
“See here, Herbert,” demurred the Captain, his
brow wrinkled perplexedly, “Miss Vlandingham

has gone on to make things ready for your recep
tion at the house. She's going to have a doctor

there, too. If I don't bring you I'll be raked over
the coals and I think I’ve had more than my
share of that already. Put yourself in my place,
can't you?”

“Put yourself in mine, Captain,” said Guy, his
eyes closing and his face twitching with pain.
The Captain felt that he understood then.

Her

bert was not able to be carried farther than Whit
taker's.

“Major,” said the Captain to a man who reared
above the saddle like Don Quixote over the back

of Rozinante, “ride on to the Squire's and tell
Miss Betty that Herbert gave out and we couldn't

get him past Whittaker's. Bring the doctor post
haste.”

** ~

*-*******~~~~--~.

Whittaker’s “Shack”

177

“Correct, Cap'n,” was the response which the
Major shook out of himself. Relinquishing to a

companion the horse he was leading, he rattled
his spurs and was off at speed.

Only a few minutes were required to carry Guy to
Whittaker's shack.

Whittaker was a bachelor and

immediately came forth to meet the Invincibles.

“Who you got there, Blue?” he asked, nodding
his head towards Guy.
“A wounded man, Whittaker.”

“I heard shootin' off south, a spell ago. Did
he get in the way of it?”
“Yes.

We had orders to take him on to the

Squire's but he doesn’t feel able to travel any
farther. Will you take him in?”

“Not if he's one of your folks,” blustered Whit
taker, whose house was just then on the Concord
side of his farm.

“Well, he's a Concord man,” said the Captain
grimly.
“All right, then. Sile Whittaker is with the
under dog every time, and if he's from Concord

he's welcome to the best I’ve got. Bring him in,
bring him right in.”
Sile Whittaker's shack was small and its furni

ture, what there was of it, was very primitive,

but the young man could not have been made
more welcome had the house been a palace and
Sile Whittaker a grandee.
After seeing that Guy was as comfortable as

possible, Capt. Blue and his Invincibles galloped
I 2

178

His Friend the Enemy

away, leaving Barney behind to be of what as
sistance he could.

They had not been gone long before Miss Betty
came, accompanied by her father and a sober
appearing gentleman who carried a medicine case

under his arm. Miss Betty was first in the room
where Guy lay.
“Are you better, Mr. Herbert?” she asked, halt
ing beside the bed and looking down at him.
“I shall do well enough, Miss Vlandingham,
thank you,” answered Guy.

“I hope so,” she said formally, after bending
her blue eyes on him for a space. Then she turned

to her father and his companion, who were just
entering. “Mr. Herbert says he thinks he will get
along all right, father,” she added.
“Glad to hear that,” responded Squire Vlan
dingham heartily. Stepping up to the bed he
reached down and pressed Guy's hand. “I’m
sorry, confoundedly sorry, this has happened,
Herbert,” he went on. “Our people were getting
carried away, but I guess this little incident will

bring them up with a round turn. Too bad,
though, that you had to be the victim.” Vlan
dingham addressed himself to the man who had
entered the room with him. “Dr. Larkin, this is
Mr. Herbert. Please tell us what you think of his
wound.”

If one might judge from the way he went about
his work, Dr. Larkin knew his business thor
oughly.

Whittaker’s “Shack”

179

“You’re worth a dozen dead men, Mr. Herbert,”
he smiled, turning away to open his medicine case
and draw out some lint and bandages and a

polished probe. “You’ll have to lie still for a few
days and take life quietly for some time after you
get up and around.” He laid the lint and ban
dages to one side and drew a chair close to the
bedside. “I’m going to hurt you now,” he re
sumed, leaning over. “I know exactly where that
bullet is and it's got to come out, you know.”
“Go ahead,” said Guy.
The doctor “went ahead” with a vengeance.
His bright probe sank into the wound, the blood
flowed afresh and Guy stiffened out as he lay,

ground his teeth together and clutched the side of
the bed with his fingers. Miss Betty voiced a little
cry and left the room. In a short time the doctor
raised up with his ensanguined instrument in his
hand and dropped the bullet on a table that had
been placed at his elbow.
“Good for you, Herbert !” he exclaimed. “That
is about as painful a thing as a doctor can do to
a man.”

“He never groaned once,” murmured the admir

ing Barney, who had come in with Sile Whittaker.
“You’re all right, Mr. Herbert,” averred Whit
taker. “I couldn't have stood it better myself.”
The wound was then dressed and Guy, thankful
to have the ordeal over, released his tense muscles
and fell back, white, trembling and numb with the
shock.

"--------------->

“You’re a Concord man with Harmony grit,
Herbert,” smiled Vlandingham.
His daughter reappeared just in time to hear the
words. Coming near the bed, she pushed her hand

through her father's arm and directed her blue
eyes at Guy. He returned her gaze steadily.
Did he read sympathy in her look? And was

there nothing else in it but sympathy? He was
no weakling and never had been. He did not
want pity from any one, especially from this fair

girl whom he—loved ! For some time he had hesi
tated to acknowledge in his own heart the depth
of his esteem for Miss Betty. Their meetings had
been few, and, for the most part, under stress of
peril to one or the other. And behold, this was

Guy's first experience with the tender passion 1 A
first love springs like Minerva from the head of
Zeus; or, better still, like Aphrodite from the sea.
These callow beginnings of the old, old tale are for
the most part as substantial as a child's bubble

just about; yet occasionally, be it known, men
and women have ideals and will strike their colors

the very moment the ideal comes into their lives.

Guy had met his ideal and had surrendered his
heart. He was not doubtful of himself; if he had
any doubt at all it was of Miss Betty. All at

once he remembered the happenings at Lake Eliza
beth and of the sorry plight in which they had

left him in Miss Betty's mind. When he began to
talk with the view of leading up to an explana
tion, he was frowned down by the doctor.

Whittaker’s “Shack”

I 81

“Don’t converse,” interrupted the medical gentle
man; “don’t move, either. Simply lie as com
fortably as you can and rest. I'll come out and
see you again this evening.”

Closing his medicine case with a decisive snap,
the doctor tucked it under his arm and went out.
“As soon as you can, Mr. Herbert,” said Miss
Betty, “you are to come to Willowview.”

“I shall do well enough here, Miss Vlanding
ham,” returned Guy, “but I thank you for the
invitation.”

“People must not say that the Harmony people
almost killed a Concordian and then left him to
shift for himself in a bare little shack like this.”
Sile Whittaker had left the room with the doctor

or Miss Betty would never have made this remark.

“This shack will answer the Concordian's pur
pose very well,” answered Guy. It nettled him to
be referred to in such a generic manner.

“By Jove,” interposed the Squire, “when you're
able to come to Willowview you’re going to come,
even if I have to order out the Invincibles.”

Miss Betty turned on her father in a flash.
“The Invincibles have already had their orders

to disband,”

she exclaimed.

“Haven’t they

worked mischief enough? From now on I shall do
my utmost to conciliate the Concord people, and
you are to help me, father. I have a plan which
we will discuss on our way back.”

The Squire cast a half-humorous glance at Guy
and bowed humbly.

-

182

His Friend the Enemy

“Of course, Betty, of course,” said he, and they
started out.

Before she had reached the door, Miss Betty
halted and faced Guy once more.
“You will hear from us again, Mr. Herbert,” she
observed. “Barney will stay here to help care for
you.”
“You are very considerate,” said Guy, “but I
can manage to struggle along without Barney.”

“Nevertheless he stays ''' declared the Squire.
“Good-bye, my boy, for the present.”
They left at once and Miss Betty did not give
the young man a parting word, a backward

glance or even a smile. Guy thought of this
gloomily, for naturally he could not know how

absorbed Miss Betty had become in the plan she

had suddenly evolved and which she was going to
talk over with her father. This plan had to do
with the policy of reconciliation and with the re

lease of Col. Keever. The latter, as Miss Betty
was planning the matter, should be released and

presented with an olive branch for delivery to the
people of Concord.
Guy heard the hoofbeats of the horses die sod

denly away in the distance and he imagined that
even so was Miss Betty passing out of his life.

He

would lose her and he would lose the county-seat.
Before his vision passed a host of migratory
structures, stores and dwellings, mounted upon
broad-tired wheels and drawn by innumerable
teams of horses.

Col. Keever was on the roof of

Whittaker’s “Shack”

183

The Blizzard building, spyglass in hand, laying the
course for the long caravan that bobbed behind.
Pettibone and little Alec drove their own domicile

with the high stepper between the shafts and, as
this home drifted past, the sheriff winked deri
sively. One by one the buildings rolled by, in
dreamy review, and the spot where Concord had
been was desolated as by some comprehensive
cyclone. Guy saw himself, forlorn and utterly
alone, wandering among his vacant lots, bewailing
the loss of the county-seat, and of the girl he
loved, and then—
And

then

merciful oblivion

blotted out the

vision and he slept dreamlessly, and the slumber
did him more good than all the medicines in the
world.

CHAPTER XVII
MR. LANDY OF AMITYVILLE

For a week after Guy had taken refuge at Sile
Whittaker's nothing of moment happened. The
doctor called regularly and Squire Vlandingham oc

casionally came with him. The Squire was at all
times his jovial self, although Guy fancied that an
undercurrent of restraint permeated his good
nature, at times.

During those seven days the

young man neither saw nor heard anything of
Miss Betty. Her father avoided mention of her—
studiously, as Guy imagined—and pride restrained
the inquiries which Guy often had at the end of
his tongue.

This reticence and seeming neglect hurt him, for
he yearned to set Miss Betty right concerning
that fateful meeting on the shore of Lake Eliza

beth. While Guy fretted much over the devious
course his true love was taking, yet this did not

interfere with his rapid improvement.
The following Saturday found him able to sit
up and walk with a cane about the house and
out of doors, where Whittaker always had a com

fortable chair ready in the shade of the house.
185

I 86

His Friend the Enemy

Barney was gone, by this time, and Whittaker
himself was attending to the wants of his guest.
On this particular Saturday two incidents oc
curred which effectually relieved the tedium of

Guy's convalescence and changed the character of
his thoughts concerning Miss Betty.
The first of these incidents had to do with Abe

Landy, of Amityville. Mr. Landy was a cousin of
Sile Whittaker's and drove over regularly once a
week to argue the political question.

Mr. Landy was a florid man with a fringe of
carroty whiskers about his plump face. He had
been a miner in the coal regions of Pennsylvania
before he came to Dakota, Whittaker explained to
the young man, “and always acted as though he

was delvin' for somethin' in the dark.” Guy and
Whittaker were seated out of doors when Mr.

Landy drove up in his two-wheeled cart.
“Howdy, Sile?” said Mr. Landy.
“Same to you, Abe,” answered Whittaker.

“Came over to see if you weren't about ready
to live on the other side of the farm, Sile.”

“If that's all you came for don’t stop; just
keep movin’.”
“No, sir,” said Landy, jumping down and tying
his horse. “I think too much of you, Sile, to
abandon you to your foolishness.”

Landy came forward, was introduced to Guy,
and another chair was brought from the house.
In vain did Whittaker seek to divert the conversa

tion to the weather, the crops, the doings of the

Mr. Landy of Amityville

187

Territorial Legislature, or what not; Landy al
ways swerved back to the county-seat question.
“The work I’ve laid out for myself,” observed
Landy, “is winnin' you over to vote for Har
mony. Election day is comin', Sile; and I don’t
want you to throw away your vote.”
“You’re the worst man I ever see to Stick and

hang,” returned Whittaker petulantly. “If I'm
going to throw away my vote by casting it for
Concord, what do you care?”
“I don’t want to see you do a thing you'll be

sorry for. Look here,” proceeded Landy, growing
confidential, “vote for Harmony and I’ll see that
you get three good lots for doing it.”
“Did Vlandingham send you to me?”
“Not exactly; but I’ve got an understanding
with him.”

“There's a pointer for you, Mr. Herbert,” said
Whittaker, winking at Guy. “Don’t you know,
Abe,” he added, addressing his cousin, “that Mr.
Herbert is a Concord man?”

“Heard he was,” replied Landy, nibbling at a
plug of tobacco. “I’ll see that he gets three lots,
too, if he'll only vote for Harmony.”
Guy smiled.
“Why,” said he, “I’ve got about twelve hundred
lots in Concord, Mr. Landy.”

“So I'm told,” responded the unruffled Landy.
“But the hull twelve hundred

won’t be worth

three Harmony lots after the election.”
“I don’t think I can accept your offer even if

I 88

His Friend the Enemy

that is a fair statement of the case.” Just then

Guy had a bright thought. “There are thirty
five voters in Amityville,
Landy?” he asked.

aren’t there, Mr.

“Fifteen,” corrected Landy, “and I carry every
vote in my pocket. The population of the village
is thirty-five, countin' men, women and children.”
“How many Harmony lots did Squire Vlanding
ham give you for turning these votes to his side?”
Landy jumped.
“What makes you think he gave me any?” he
asked warily.

“I’m sure he did. He must have given you a
good many, it strikes me, for Amityville is the
key to the situation.”
“You’re right about our town being the key to

the situation. Our votes will settle the county
seat business—no doubt about that.”

“Now I should think,” resumed Guy, “that

Squire Vlandingham gave you a whole block in
return for the Amityville vote.”
“A block?” gasped Landy.
“Yes, or more.”

“Why, if I had a block of Harmony lots I’d be
independent rich as soon as the county-seat ques
tion is settled and the boom sets in.”

“Your influence would be worth it.

Didn't you

get a block?”
“No, nor half a block. I only got six and was
given two to transfer to every voter in Amity
ville.”

Mr. Landy of Amityville

189

“You don’t say so !” exclaimed Guy. “Is it
possible that that is Squire Vlandingham's idea of
fair treatment? Only six lots for gaining the
county-seat for Harmony | Well, well!”
Guy leaned back in his chair and looked at

Landy sympathetically.
“Vlandingham has pulled the wool over your
eyes, Abe,” chuckled Whittaker, making due note
of his cousin's long face.
“It doesn’t look as though he had treated me

just right, does it, now?” mumbled Landy.
“No, sir,” said Guy, with emphasis. “Did you
make a straight bargain with Squire Vlanding
ham P”

“There wasn't any bargain at all. When Vlan

dingham got ready to have his petition to the
County Commissioners signed he handed me a
due bill for six lots, together with fourteen other
due bills for two lots each for the rest of the

voters in Amityville. All he did was to slap me
on the back, and call me Abe, and say how much

he thought of me. Gosh! And to think that he
was making game of me all the time.”
“It is too bad, Mr. Landy,” rejoined Guy. For
some time he had been furtively taking Mr.
Landy's measure and he was now ready to lay on
the finishing stroke of a hastily evolved plan.

“If Amityville votes for Concord,” he went on,
“it’s almost a certainty that Concord will win.
When it is once settled that Concord has the

county-seat hard and fast, the town will boom

*-*-*-*-------

*

His Friend the Enemy

I 9o

and lots will sell like hot cakes. As I told you, I
have over twelve hundred good lots and I
wouldn't object to giving thirty-four due bills for
two lots each to every man, woman and child in
Amityville, excepting Abraham Landy. As for
Mr. Landy, I would ask him to distribute the
thirty-four due bills and then, if he would promise

to return a solid vote for Concord, I would give
him a thirty-fifth due bill for fifty lots, two full
blocks.”

“You’d do that, would you?” exploded Landy,
leaping from his chair.
“I would,” answered Guy, “and I would con
sider that Mr. Landy had done me a favor.”
Mr. Landy clasped his hands behind him and
walked around the house, his eyes turned ground
ward.

“You’ve hooked him !” muttered the delighted
Whittaker.

“By jinks, you’ve hooked him, Mr.

Herbert.”

And Whittaker was right. Ten minutes later
Guy was writing due bills by the dozen and half
an hour later Mr. Landy was homeward bound,

after having given a written agreement to poll
every Amityville ballot for Concord. While he
was engaged in giving away lots, Guy did not
forget to present Whittaker with half a dozen;
thereupon that gentleman solemnly covenanted
that his house should remain forever upon the
Concord side of his farm.

This deal consummated, Guy went in and laid

- - - --

Mr. Landy of Amityville

I 91

down. He felt that he had done a good stroke of
work for Concord.

His conscience troubled him

somewhat, for there was a hint of sharp practice

in his deal with Landy that was directly opposed
to the young man's inclinations and general

character. Still, if Vlandingham had bought Ami
tyville signatures to his petition, why should not
Guy buy Amityville votes? The ballots of the

two sets of imported voters, each just a score in
number, would nullify each other. Now that Ami
tyville was to go for Concord, the success of
Concord seemed certain.

The first flush of assured victory over, Guy be
gan to feel sorry for Miss Betty. She was bending
every effort towards winning a victory for Har
mony and was so confident of the result that he—

well, he almost regretted that he had allowed him
self to purchase Mr. Landy's influence.
“Lady to see you, Mr. Herbert,” announced
Whittaker, abruptly opening the door. After grin
ning slyly he vanished as quickly as he had ap
peared.
“A lady,” murmured Guy, in trepidation.
He had been so busy with his thoughts that he
had heard no sounds indicative of the arrival of a

visitor. As he arose he glanced through a win
dow and saw Miss Pinkney seated in a gorgeous
trap and holding a horse. The next moment he
saw Whittaker approach the trap, stand beside it

and engage Miss Pinkney in conversation. The
young man's heart fluttered. At last! At last

I 92

His Friend the Enemy

he would be able to explain that affair on the
lake shore.

Miss Betty was waiting for him when he entered
the other room. She came forward hastily and
took one of his hands in both her own. The look
on her face was one which he had never seen there

before. Sadness, heartburning, regret—these were
all in the glance she gave him.
“I can remain but a moment, Mr. Herbert,” she

said. “I have been in Bismarck for a few days
and on my return to Harmony I learned some
thing which has brought me straight to you to
ask your forgiveness.”
“My forgiveness?” he repeated, clinging to one

of her hands. “Forgiveness for what?”
“For allowing you to help me, thus causing you
to be looked upon as a traitor by your own
townspeople; and for daring to think that you

had brought the sheriff and two others with you
to the lake, a week ago last Wednesday. Oh, I
feel as though I am personally culpable and that

your wound is the indirect result of my own
actions.” Her blue eyes grew misty and her

voice shook. “Will you forgive me, Mr. Herbert?”
He longed to clasp her to his breast and tell her
how dear she had become to him in the brief time

they had known each other; he would have given

worlds to kiss her tears away and do other senti
mental and foolish things which he had no earthly
right to do, but he restrained himself. He loved

her, and he defied the months and years to dis

prove a truth which two short weeks had made

clear to him. Yet, while sure of his own feelings,
he must wait to assure himself of hers.

“Who has told you my side of the case, Miss
Vlandingham?” he asked.
“Some one who knows,” was the reply; “some
one who lives in Concord and is thoroughly con
versant with every phase of your ill-treatment at
the hands of the mistaken people there.”
“My ill-treatment, I fear, has been overdrawn,”

said Guy, smiling. “I love the study of my fellow
man, Miss Vlandingham, and although I have
been put to some inconvenience while in Concord,
I assure you that I have had a great deal of en

joyment out of the situation existing there. In
trying times like these, human nature flies to the
surface and that makes the study of character

not only easy but delightful. I am glad, however,
that you know I was not at fault when I met you
at the lake. Did you hear of my telegram?”
“Yes, I know of that. Col. Keever told the

operator that you had decided not to send it.”
“And it was simply a coincidence that caused

you to appoint, for our meeting, the very place,
day and hour that was hit upon by Col. Keever
and Col. Dingle for their affair of honor?”
“A coincidence entirely. You will forgive me,
will you not, and forget my hasty words at the
lake? Please hurry, for I must be going.”
“I forgive you freely, although I do not see how
you could have acted otherwise than as you did.”

“Your generosity prompts you to say that.

But you must not be too generous. For instance,
I would not want you to think that you must
not strain every effort to win the county-seat con

test. It is a case of Greek meeting Greek, you
know; and all is fair in war—”
“And love!” added Guy.
The color flew to her face.

“I like to see a man successful,” she added,
“even if he is fighting against me.”

“I have done, and shall continue to do, every
thing I can to keep the county-seat at Concord,”
averred Guy.

“There !” she exclaimed; “I like to hear you say
that and in just that tone of voice. It sounds
businesslike and manly, you know, and that's the

way I like to hear people-some people-that is,
people in whom I take an interest— What am I
saying?” She bit her lip in vexation and stamped
her foot. “Please let me go,” she said, attempt
ing to withdraw her hand.

He raised the gloved hand to his lips. Again
the scarlet flew to her cheeks and she turned and

fled from the house.

CHAPTER XVIII
FOUR GENTLEMEN FROM HARMONY

The election was to be held on Tuesday, and the
Monday preceding had been fraught with matters
of grave concern for Col. Keever. The most mo
mentous of these matters was the strike of Samp
son for back pay and higher wages; the most
momentous because, like the newly started snow

ball, the incident grew amazingly in importance
until it ended in the Colonel's disgrace, his ban

ishment from the town, and the wrecking of The
Blizzard.

To begin with, The Blizzard had never been
much of a financial success. It was a paper of
Johnsonian excellence; that is to say, so ponder
ous in its utterance that it had to be read with a

Webster—unabridged—at one's elbow. The little
fishes talked like whales on every line and through
every column. In a community necessarily defi
cient in its supply of Websters, The Blizzard was
venerated and feared because of its evident learn

ing. For the same reason, but few subscribed for
it; and so small was the subscription list at the

time the unfeeling Sampson went on strike, and
I95

196

His Friend the Enemy

so meagre was the advertising patronage, that
the Colonel had barely two dollars that he could
call his own.

In his extremity he bewailed the reckless impulse
which had led him to pay Hepburn, the discharged
section hand from Harmony, twenty dollars for

information which had proved of no value. The
great man dreamed of that twenty-dollar bill in
his sleep and would clutch at it so fiercely that he
would awake-awake to realize that it was gone
forever.

His printing “plant” had cost him five hundred
dollars, and he had paid all but four hundred and

fifty dollars of that debt. He had no lots in
Concord, and if Guy had demanded a settlement
it would have been found that there were fifty or

more which could not be accounted for. That
very Monday, Pedro Smith had pressed the Col
onel for a board bill long past due; the news

company had sent his “patent outsides” by ex
press, C. O. D.—the C. O. D. covering certain

arrearages—and the bundle was still in the
express office while the forms waited in vain on
the “Army” press.
What was the Colonel to do?

Racked with all

these worries he had entered his office only to be
confronted by Sampson, who demanded money and
declared he would “stop work” if he didn’t get it.
This was the last straw. The Colonel's patience

gave way and hot words were passed between him
and his printer. And then—well, he struck Samp

Four Gentlemen from Harmony 197
son with his cane, and Sampson hit him with a
chair, and threw him into one corner, and shook a

fist in his face and vowed revenge, r-r-revenge!
After that, Sampson went away in high dudgeon
and the Colonel picked himself up, limped to his

office chair and sat there for a long, long time,
bitterly reflecting. The sun went down, the shad
ows of evening fell, and still the Colonel's acute

mind had found no loophole for escape from his
present difficulties.
It was at this juncture that four gentlemen from
Harmony, all of serious aspect and wearing black
slouch hats, ascended the unsteady stairs that led

to the office of The Blizzard. And one was very
tall, and one had a glass eye, and the third

stumped through life on a wooden pin, and the
fourth carried an empty sleeve.

Business called

them to Concord and ill-fortune had prepared the
Colonel to greet them in receptive mood.

The Committee of Ways and Means—dark ways
and questionable means-came at night as befitted

doers of ignoble deeds. Their two-seated carriage
and team were left at the edge of town and they
were unseen by any save Sampson. He still car
ried a key to the workroom and as they entered

by the front he entered at the rear.
Col. Keever cherished no ill-feelings and wel

comed his callers cordially and humorously.
Should he put their names down for a year's sub
scription to his invaluable paper, two-fifty a year,
in advance?

198

His Friend the Enemy

No; the four gentlemen from Harmony had not
called for any such purpose.
Indeed! While his four callers were unfortunate,

in so far as they resided in a town with such a
poor outlook as Harmony, yet lack of taste was
not a crime, and Col. Keever was glad to extend

the right hand of fellowship to Col. Dingle, Maj.
Harp, Capt. Blue and Mr. Boomer.
Col. Dingle, Maj. Harp, Capt. Blue and Mr.
Boomer gratefully acknowledged Col. Keever's
amicable sentiments and begged to assure him of

their own, coupled with a slight offering in the
way of liquid refreshment.
This preliminary matter arranged to the voluble
satisfaction of all parties, Col. Dingle asked to
know if they were alone.
Col. Keever told him that they could not be
more utterly alone if they were set down on the

broad bosom of the Sahara—with nothing to
drink.

Then they all laughed and clapped the great
man on the back and seemed to think it an excel

lent joke, and Col. Keever became bland and
facetious and informed them again of his ever
lasting regard.
Following this, Mr. Boomer went to the door

and looked out on the landing and down the
stairs and came back seemingly satisfied.
“All clear, Colonel,” he said, and Col. Dingle
hitched his chair into confidential proximity to
Col. Keever's.

Four Gentlemen from Harmony 199
“Colonel,” he observed carefully, “Concord is
the county-seat of Goodwill county.”
Col. Keever replied that he had no reason to
dispute his honorable friend's statement. He
concurred in it fully.
“Colonel,” went on Dingle, “Harmony would
like to have the county-seat.”
Keever averred loudly, in answer to this re
mark, that Col. Dingle was a truthful man and a
man of undoubted ability. They had had their
little differences, of course, yet Col. Keever knew
how to grant honor where honor was due. When

it rained, Col. Dingle knew where to go to keep
out of the wet.

Dingle laughed, his natural eye glowed, and he
nudged Keever with his elbow. The other three
gentlemen joined in the merriment, liquid refresh
ment was again bountifully administered and the
good feeling prevailed to an extent that was al
most morbid.

Dingle hung languishingly on Keever's shoulder
while the three others huddled about, anxious to
laugh at any joke however old, and silently im

ploring an opportunity to express their unbounded
affection for everybody.
“A special election has been called for the pur
pose of shifting the county-seat from Concord to
Harmony,” Dingle resumed, “and a two-thirds
vote is necessary to the consummation of such a

change. Now it is impossible to deny that Har
mony is a favorite with two-thirds of the county,

2OO

His Friend the Enemy

but we”—Dingle designated himself and his three
companions—“thoroughly understand how ut
terly vain it would be for Harmony to attempt to
secure the county-seat without the good will and
assistance of one whose ability is undoubted,
whose virtues are the envy of his fellow men and
whose congenial nature is a theme of general re
mark. In short, Col. Archibald Keever, of Con
cord.”

-

Col. Keever smiled his gratification and desired
to state that it had never been his extreme good
fortune to run across so truthful a man as Col.

Dingle, nor such a whole-souled, appreciative set
of companions as had accompanied him; and he
hoped that, knowing him as they all did, they
would take this little apostrophe for what it was
worth. In the meantime, as the national debt was

oppressive, why not give it another lift?
The four gentlemen from Harmony readily un
derstood this hint and four flasks were stretched

out simultaneously towards Col. Keever. The
latter bowed, and to the end that none might feel

aggrieved, paid due and lengthened attention to
each flask, supplementing each draught with a
peculiarly happy remark relative to the generosity

of the donor and the excellence of his gift.
This small formality over, Col. Dingle once more
resumed his topic in a voice that was growing
husky by very apparent degrees.
“Col. Keever, you have managed the townsite
of Concord and managed it well. Among other

Four Gentlemen from

Harmony 201

things you have gone ahead, like an able tactician,
and have rushed into this precinct certain men to
build bridges and houses, and repair roads and

heaven knows what. Now, everybody is aware
that the roads are all right, the bridges in good
condition and that you have more houses than

you can use. Well, then, why have you brought
all these men here?

Oh, we know !

That fertile

brain, that intellect that labored and brought
forth The Blizzard, has hidden its purpose well,
but we have discovered it. Haven’t we, boys?”
“We have,” came a chorus of thick voices.
Col. Keever wore a perpetual smile, very child
like, very bland; and he would wink his right eye
now and then and shake his head with a great
deal of feeling.
“What's the purpose?” he inquired, evincing a

tendency to run his words together.

.

“It's this. That special election is called for to
morrow. These men will have been in the county

sixty days and in the precinct twenty days; con
sequently they can vote and, naturally, they'll
vote for Concord.”

“Shouldn’t wonder much,” remarked Keever,

with a dry hiccough. “Twenty men, and I pay
'em two dollars a day for sixty days—that's
twenty-four hundred dollars that it costs us to

save the county-seat. And who's to the fore in
the enterprise? Col. Archibald Keever ! I declare,
gentlemen, my throat is parched. Would it be
asking too much—”

2O2

His Friend the Enemy

It was not asking too much. Col. Keever was

welcome to the best they had in the shop and all
there was of it.

-

“And this brings us back to where we started,”
said Col. Dingle. “Harmony would like the
county seat and she would like it just two thou
sand dollars' worth.”

Dingle gave Keever a playful push.

“What's that?” murmured Keever, rolling his
eyes.

“Just this,” went on Dingle. “Instead of vot
ing these men for Concord, vote them for Har
mony. You can do it. The great mind that built
up a paper like The Blizzard can do anything.”
Col. Keever relapsed into silence and did his best
to think calmly while the four gentlemen from

Harmony awaited his reply in soulful expecta
tion.

“Two thousand?” asked Keever huskily.
“Two thousand,” came an equally husky reply.
“Cash down?”

-

“Fifty now and nineteen hundred and fifty when
the votes are polled.”

A long period of silence ensued, to be finally
broken by Keever with the anxious query:
“Gen'1' men, is there any left?”
There was some left and libations were renewed
all around.

“What is it, Colonel, yes or no?” asked Dingle
when the gurgling period was over.

Through Col. Keever's mind there flitted hazily

Four Gentlemen from Harmony 203
the following items: Four hundred and fifty on
account of “plant,” twenty-eight sixty to get that

week's issue out of pawn; sixty some odd for
Sampson, and there was no knowing the amount
of Pedro Smith's bill. Why not?

He coughed, looked around him a trifle ner
vously and then held out his hand.
“Gim’me the fifty.”

A crisp bank note was tendered him.
“Here you are,” said Dingle, “and here are two
documents—mere matters of form, you know, one
for us and one for you-setting forth what's to be
done, what's to be paid, and when. For your

protection as well as ours, Colonel. Sign there.”
Unsteadily the editor took up his pen and
scrawled two awkward signatures, whereupon Col.
Dingle signed below him and the other three at
tested the act as witnesses.

Then, after drinking the last of the liquor, the
four gentlemen from Harmony bade Col. Keever
an affectionate “Goo' bye” and left. Col. Keever
heard Capt. Blue fall down the full length of the
stairs, heard Col. Dingle whoop joyously and

Maj. Harp tune himself into a discord faintly
suggestive of “We Won't Go Home Till Morning,”
and then these sounds died away and all was
still.
Further and further the Colonel's head bowed

forward until, no longer able to retain his seat,
he fell under the desk and lay there, a melancholy
example of fallen greatness.

2O4.

His Friend the Enemy

At that moment the door leading into the work

room opened softly and Sampson, a cunning grin
on his freckled face, tiptoed into the sanctum.
“It's my turn now, Colonel,” he muttered be
tween his teeth as he looked down on the sprawled
out form of his former employer. Stooping over,
he removed the crisp bank note from the Colonel's
vest pocket. “You owe me something like sixty

five dollars, but I'll apply this on account. And
I'll put this in my pocket, too,” he added, taking

from the desk the paper that had just been signed.
“A tramp printer isn’t the man to be fooled with,

Colonel, and you'll understand this before I am
done with you.”

With that Sampson shook his fist at the Col
onel and strode from the office.

Meanwhile, Col. Dingle, Maj. Harp and Capt.

Blue were riding Harmony-wards in a lethargic
condition, while Mr. Boomer, who had fallen from
the carriage unknown to himself or his compan

ions, was peacefully sleeping by the roadside some
two miles out of Concord.

CHAPTER XIX
“THE RIGOR OF THE GAME”

It was on Monday afternoon that Miss Betty
dashed up to the door of Sile Whittaker's shack

in the gorgeous trap. A dazzling picture she pre
sented to Guy with her light dress, her fluttering
ribbons and her bewitching hat. The ubiquitous

Miss Pinkney was not along and the silver-plated
harness jingled rare music as Miss Betty drew to
a halt.

-

Mr. Whittaker had gone off to attend to some
farm work and Guy was alone at the house. He

went out forthwith to greet the young lady and
to ask her if she would not alight.
“Oh, no,” said she, “I can’t stop. I have come

for you, Mr. Herbert.”
“For me?” he echoed.

“Certainly. It was understood that when you
were well enough to leave Mr. Whittaker's you
were to come to Willowview. Don't you remem
ber?”

That was not Guy's remembrance of the under
standing.

“I can’t go with you, Miss Vlandingham,” he
murmured confusedly. “Really, I—”
2 o'S

206

His Friend the Enemy

“Now, Mr. Herbert !” she pouted. “I have
driven out here purposely to get you and is it

possible that you will refuse to go back with me?”
There was laughter in her eyes as she added:
“You need apprehend no danger, now. A Con
cord man, I am happy to say, may walk the
streets of Harmony without the slightest fear.”
“It isn’t the danger that deters me,” answered

Guy. “I am not such a coward as that, I hope l’’
“Aren't you well enough?” She eyed his stal
wart form archly.
“Richard is himself again—almost. But to
morrow, you know, is election day.”
“The returns will reach you more quickly in
Harmony than they will here.”

“I shall not stay here. My post of duty is
Concord, and Mr. Whittaker is going to take me
there in the morning.”
“From the way the Concord people treated

you,” she said, her eyes glowing resentfully, “I
shouldn’t think you’d ever want to set foot in the
place again.”

“Irrespective of the feelings of the Concordians,”
he smiled, “there is my financial interest. I can
not abandon those twelve hundred lots.”

“What are twelve hundred, or twelve thousand
lots to the son of Mr. Montfort Herbert?” she

returned. “A mere bagatelle ! I know perfectly
well that it isn’t the money at stake, in your case,
nor is it in mine.
test.”

It is the excitement of the con

She threw back her shoulders and tossed

“The Rigor of the Game”

her fair head. “A stout heart, a fair fight, and
the rigor of the game ! The end of our plots and
our counterplots is now at hand.

Either success

or defeat will prove equally glorious and you can
learn the worst, or the best, at Willowview just as
well as you can in Concord. Please don't keep me
waiting, Mr. Herbert.”
Evidently she thought the son of Mr. Montfort

Herbert had a competence in his own right. She
had not been informed of the real condition of

Guy's fortunes and he was not the one to lay bare
the truth.

Guy reflected. He might do more harmthan good
in Concord if he went there during the crisis. He
had no vote, anyway, as two weeks in the Territory
would not give him the right of franchise. Be

sides, had he not, in a quiet way, gained a strate
gic advantage which would keep the county-seat
at Concord?

“Very well, Miss Vlandingham,” he said. “It is
kind of you to come for me, and if you really care
for my company at Willowview I shall be most
happy to return with you.”
He went into the house for his satchel and they
started for Harmony with a snap of the whip and
a jingle of chains. Very shortly they passed Mr.
Whittaker, at work by the road, and there was a
brief halt while Guy explained matters. Mr. Whit
taker said little but smiled in a knowing way, and

they could see him lean on the handle of his
shovel and watch until they were out of sight.

His Friend the Enemy

208

Only the pen of a poet could fittingly describe
that wondrous ride. A sentimental journey it
was, every step of the way from Whittaker's to the
Squire's; a delicious faring across the sunny plain,
through a drowsy odor of wild flowers and under
such

skies

as smile over the

Fortunate Isles.

Touched by the spell, neither of the young people
wasted much time in conversation, and the long
lapses of silence into which they fell were rhythmic
intervals wherein their hearts echoed back the

melody of a song as old as the days of man.
Arrived at their destination Guy heaved a sigh of
regret. The calends of his love had lifted a white
stone to mark a passing hour, and he was more

securely a captive if that could be.
The young man's sojourn at Willowview was
very brief. Both Miss Betty and her father ex
erted themselves to the utmost to make his stay

enjoyable, but he was ill at ease. His negotiations
with Mr. Landy had certainly won the county
seat for Concord, and it seemed to him as though

he were acting a double part. When the returns
came in, and when the genial Squire and the

adorable Miss Betty discovered how wily and
tactful he had been, he feared that there would be

an upheaval and that they would deny him their
hospitality, and send him forth in scorn.
It was all very well for Miss Betty to talk of
“the rigor of the game.” The prime incentive in
every game is success, and when the ballots were
counted and it was found that Amityville had cast

“The Rigor of the Game”

209

a deciding vote for Concord, he would see then
whether Miss Betty would take defeat as “glor
iously” as she would have taken a better fortune.

It would be a bitter triumph for him if it cost him
her favor. Yet if she had not spoken those words

in a spirit of raillery—in short, if she really meant
them—how incomparable she would become in his

eyes! As Pettibone had said, he could go to her
and offer her a “dower” interest in his town.

then, if she would accept—!

And

His heart leaped at

the thought and his mind winged skyward in
sweeping dreams.

-

That night they were in the cozy parlor just as
they had been exactly two weeks before. Miss
Betty was at the piano and Guy stood beside her
turning her music. The Squire was engaged with
his paper. Since the young man had come to the
house that second time the county-seat question
had not once been mentioned. As during his first
visit, father and daughter were making it plain
that while he was their guest there was to be no

discordant note to jar their friendship. Guy was
delighted at this, for there was a charm in observ
ing Miss Betty as the light and center of her
father's home. If her shrewdness and courage had
pleased him in the political field how much more
was he attracted by her domestic accomplish
ments.

Guy was watching Miss Betty's white fingers flit
over the keys, and now and then exchanging a
soft word in which his passion throbbed danger

ously near the surface, when there came a sudden
interruption. A lusty voice outside gave an alarm
of “Fire! fire !” and the Squire leaped from his
chair as his daughter and Guy hastily left the
piano.
“Can it be this house, father?” inquired Miss
Betty, nervously.
“No, it's in town,” replied the Squire, who had
drawn back the curtain for a quick look at the
surroundings. “I can't just make out what build

ing it is, but it's near the square, that's evi
dent.”

He ran to the hall, secured his hat and opened
the door. A mellow glare was cast over the scene

without and a man was discovered hastening
along the road.

“Hello!” cried the Squire. “What's burning?”
“The court-house !” was the startling answer
flung back by the man as he sped on.
“Oh, dear!” cried Miss Betty, with a sharp note

of regret. “I had planned to do something in the
morning, before the polls open-something which
would have knit Concord and Harmony in closer

bonds and have insured a peaceable election, but
now it is impossible.”

“The best laid plans of mice and maids gang
aft agley, you remember,” observed Guy. “For
my part, I hope that ill-fated court-house will be
burned to the last stick.

It has caused trouble

Together they sat on the porch watching the

yellow flames leap high and toss their sparkling,
star-like cinders. Then gradually the fiery tongues
sank down and down, the glare faded out of the
sky and they knew that the court-house had ceased
to be a factor in the contest.

The Squire returned by and by, and with him
walked a youth who was wheeling a bicycle.

“Let us go in for a moment,” they heard the
Squire say.

“You can leave your wheel at the

Guy had preceded them, and Guy then discovered

that the youth who was accompanying the Squire

Notwith

standing a certain air of bravado and triumph, it
could be seen that Lemuel was very much agitated
and frightened.
“A fellow townsman of yours, Mr. Herbert,”

remarked the Squire, a grim smile flitting across
his face. “This young man,” he laid his hand on
Lemuel's shoulder, “came over from Concord and
burned the court-house. He was caught while
attempting to escape and the people were strongly

tempted to make an example of him, but I re
minded them of our new policy—”

“Of my new policy, father,” interrupted Miss
Betty.

“Quite so, my dear. I reminded them of your
new policy and the incendiary was turned over to
me.

His name is Lemuel Bilkins and he has

probably done a brave thing, as his people will

2I 2

His Friend the Enemy

look at it. That was a very bright idea of yours,
Mr. Bilkins.”

There was sarcasm in the Squire's voice, but
Lemuel could not detect it.
9*

“It was the Colonel's idea,” answered Lemuel,
falteringly but proudly. “He said if I’d do it I
could have Sampson's place in the office.”

“Has Sampson left Keever's employ?” queried
the Squire, with sudden interest.
“Why,” returned Lemuel, “he set on the Colonel

like a tiger an’ if the Colonel hadn't held himself
in he'd jest naturally have killed Samp.”
“This is news indeed!” exclaimed Guy.
“I have brought the young man here, Betty,”
resumed her father, “so that you might tell him
what you intended doing with the court-house
to-morrow. He will see, then, that the building
was sacrificed to no purpose.”
“Won't you sit down, Mr. Bilkins?” asked Miss
Betty.
“I’d ruther stand,” returned Lemuel, fidgeting.

“If it's all the same to you, I'd ruther go right
off, too.”

“You are in no danger, Mr. Bilkins,” went on
Miss Betty, “I give you my word. Stand if you

like, for I will detain you only a few moments.
The purloining of the court-house was my plan. I

did not intend to steal it, but after Harmony had
legally acquired the county-seat I was going to
have the building paid for.

Had I not done this,

I hardly see how a clash could have been avoided,

“The Rigor of the Game”

2I3

for the Invincibles were organized and drilled and

it was their avowed intention to march upon
Concord and take the records by force. I had

absolutely no power over them. By allowing
them to work off their ardor in a more theatrical

way their purpose was accomplished without

violence. We bear no ill will toward you or your
people, and I had arranged to have the court

house hauled back to its original site in the early
hours of the morning. I am very sorry, indeed,
that you have made this impossible. If you will
remember what I have told you, however, and tell

your fellow citizens about it, they may perhaps
accept the intention in lieu of the deed.”
Lem Bilkins, when the Squire conducted him
from the house and started him homeward on his

bicycle, appeared as one stunned. As for Guy,
this fresh proof of Miss Betty's consummate

ability in managing a delicate situation merely
increased his admiration for her.

Next day came the crucial test, and the nerves
of the entire county were stretched to tightest
tension. There was much excitement in Harmony
and the Squire was abroad all day, not even re
turning home for his luncheon. Miss Pinkney
walked over from the town and awaited the re

turns in company with Miss Betty and Guy.
Great was the consternation of the ladies when

Barney, late in the afternoon, arrived with the

intelligence that Amityville had gone solidly for
Concord.

2I4

His Friend the Enemy

“Why,” cried Miss Betty, “every one of the Amity
ville people signed the petition for this election l’”

“And the Squire gave Mr. Landy six lots !”
wailed Miss Pinkney, who was the picture of
despair.

“The Squire wasn't liberal enough,” put in Guy,
looking keenly at Miss Betty. “I gave Mr. Landy
two entire blocks and distributed Concord real

estate to every man, woman and child in Amity
Ville.”

“You did that?” cried Miss Betty. “You, Mr.
Herbert?”

Miss Pinkney looked daggers at Guy when he
bowed in answer to her friend's question.
“I knew all along, Miss Vlandingham,” said the

young man, “just how Amityville would go.
That was one reason why I did not want to come
here yesterday. I have done what I could for
Concord and, it seems, have earned your dis
pleasure.”
“Earned my displeasure,” she repeated, with a
rippling laugh. “Not a bit of it! You were a
foeman worthy of our steel and I am almost as
glad you have won as I would have been had
Harmony achieved the victory.”
“Betty l’” gasped Miss Pinkney. “You are cer

tainly beside yourself. Do you know what this
means to your father, to mine, to all of us? Oh,
dear, dear, dear! I can’t imagine what we are all

going to do ! And to think that we were all so
certain of Amityville !”

“The Rigor of the Game”

“That is where the joke comes in 1” exclaimed

Miss Betty. “What a surprise this will be for my
father ! You’ve certainly won, Mr. Herbert. It
was very clever and I am proud of your success,

believe me. Allow me to congratulate you!”
She gave Guy her hand.
“Betty,” cried Miss Pinkney, “you're a—a
modern Tarpeia. The idea of you—you of all
others—being happy because Concord won ''”
Miss Pinkney began drawing on her gloves in an

angry flutter.
“Lois,” returned Miss Betty, “you do not un
derstand, dear. I am not happy because Concord
won, but because Mr. Herbert has come out of the
East, burdened with his inexperience, and worsted a
clique of old campaigners like my father and yours.”
“Are you proud of me for going into the open
market and buying votes?” asked Guy.

“Hush !” she returned, raising an admonitory
forefinger. “That is too hard a name for some
thing which the great political parties never
scruple at doing. It was a case of diamond cut

diamond. You interested the Amityville people in
your own town even as my father had interested
them in ours—only you were shrewd enough to be

more liberal. The game of politics is a selfish one,
at best, and you—”

Just then the Squire stormed in.
“My condolences, Herbert,” he cried, in gay
mood, waving a slip of yellow paper above his
head.

2I 6

His Friend the Enemy

“What?” asked Guy, startled.
“I sympathize with you, but a town divided

against itself is sure to fall. Harmony carries the
day, and the deciding votes come from Concord

itself. Five, Betty | We have five votes more than
we need. Here, read this telegram.”
The Squire threw himself into a chair and Guy
turned mechanically towards Miss Betty. She had
taken the message from her father's hand and now
read aloud, as follows:
“‘Concord casts twenty-four votes for Har
mony. Conservative estimate gives you five more
than required two-thirds majority. Riot here.
Town in turmoil. Hard to tell what will happen.—
Biggs.”

??

“Hurrah!” cried the excited Miss Pinkney, wav
ing her handkerchief.
“Where in the world did those twenty-four

Harmony votes come from?” asked Miss Betty.
Her father pursed up his lips, looked at the

ceiling and twirled his thumbs.
“Victory is perched on our banners, Betty,” he
observed, finally.

“I don't know how it got there

any more than you do, but what's the odds?”
What's the odds? That is plainly what Miss
Betty thought, for the moment.
“Now what do you think, Mr. Herbert?” she
queried, facing the amazed young man and shak
ing the telegram before his eyes.
“I think I shall have to return the congratula

“The Rigor of the Game”

217

tions which you gave me a few moments ago,”
laughed Guy.

“Not only that, but I think, too,

that I shall have to return to Concord at once.”

“No, no!” said Miss Betty.
“It would be suicidal !” declared the Squire.
“Didn't you hear the message? ‘Riot here
town in turmoil. Don't go back there until mat
ters quiet down.”
“They could have spared me in the event of a

victory,” said Guy, “but it's cowardly to remain
away in time of defeat.

I must go immediately.

Perhaps Barney will take me?”
“I’ll take you myself if you're bound to go,”
answered the Squire, promptly. “I don't want to

persuade you against your convictions, you know,
and I have the greatest respect for your courage,
but really I'm afraid you'll be in some danger if

you go over there just at present. Wait until
morning, anyway.”

“No, Squire,” returned Guy firmly, “I must go
to-night.”

And go he did, heedless alike of the protesta
tions of Miss Betty and her father.
When the Squire went for the horse and car

riage, Guy bade adieu to the overjoyed Miss Pink
ney and left the house, Miss Betty accompanying
him as far as the gate.
“You’re the most obstinate young man I ever
saw,” pouted Miss Betty.
“Obstinate?” echoed Guy.

“Well, determined then. I have faith in your

218

His Friend the Enemy.

ability to take care of yourself, but please remem
ber that you are not entirely recovered from that
wound. I do hope you will be careful.”

Something in her tone caused the young man's
pulses to beat more rapidly. With a quick move

ment he caught one of her hands from the palings
of the gate.
“I am glad to know that you care so much for
my welfare,” said he; “and now that the county
seat question is settled, you are no longer my
friend the enemy—are you?”
She laughed a little but her hand clasped his
warmly and sincerely.

“I trust that we shall always be the best of
friends,” she replied.
Guy longed to say more, but at that moment
there came a beat of hoofs, a grind of wheels, and
then the Squire's voice: “All aboard, Herbert l”

“Coming, Squire,” Guy called, and added softly:
“Good night, Miss Vlandingham.”
“Good night,” she murmured. “I need not tell

you how anxiously I—how anxiously we shall
await news from Concord.”

“You shall be informed of everything,” said he,
and released her hand, passed out through the
gate and sprang lightly into the carriage.

As Guy and the Squire traveled quickly out of
Harmony, bells were ringing, horns were blowing,
guns were firing and joy was general and unconfined.
When they first glimpsed the lights of Concord
they likewise discovered a blot of shadow hovering

“The Rigor of the Game”
in the road directly ahead.

2I9

On drawing nearer

the blot resolved itself into the outlines of a horse

and carriage with a man in silhouette on the car
riage seat. This rig was at a standstill and
looked most ominous.

“Why, it's Pettibone !” exclaimed Guy, as they
came in line to pass.

He had recognized the high

stepper and its driver by a sort of instinct.
“Stop a moment, Squire.”
The Squire drew rein.

“Is that you, Herbert?” inquired the sheriff.

“How are you?”
“Nearly as good as new.”
“Glad to hear it. Never had anything break me

up quite so much as that skirmish and seeing you
tumble into the road.

Where are you bound

“Concord.”

“Take my advice and turn back.”
Why?”
64

“It won’t be healthy for you to go there, that's
why. There are all kinds of stories afloat about
you. In their present temper the people wouldn’t
like anything better than to string you up. Of
course, I know you better and don’t take any

stock in their yarns. A pair of blue eyes, says I,
and I make allowances.”

“What are the yarns?” queried Guy hastily. He
resented that allusion to “blue eyes,” especially
on the Squire's account.

22O

His Friend the Enemy

“Why, Bilkins got back from Harmony last
night and told about your being at Vlanding
ham's. People in town, though, didn't think
much about that until those Jimtown rascals
voted for Harmony, every man jack of 'em. Two
hours ago a mob of citizens waited on Keever

with a rope and they'd have lynched him, I guess,
if he hadn't sworn that you played into the

enemy's hands all through, and that those im
ported voters cast their ballots in accordance
with your orders.”
The Squire muttered an angry imprecation.
“Those Jamestown men would have given the
lie to the Colonel's words,” cried Guy, with some
heat.

“Possibly; but they all left town in a body,
nearly scared out of their wits.”
“Squire Vlandingham,” said Guy, appealing to
his companion, “tell Pettibone that Keever is
wrong.”
“I don't need Vlandingham's testimony,” broke
in the sheriff. “I know you're straight goods,
Herbert. 'S I say, a pair of—”

“What are the people doing now?” asked Guy,
heading the sheriff off.

“Everything's quiet just at the present speakin'.
It's the calm precedin a storm. The inhabitants
are goin’ to cut loose in the morning and, if

you're around, you're liable to be the storm
center.”

“Why are you out here, Pettibone?”

“The Rigor of the Game”

22 I

“Was takin' a look for the Jimtown fellers, but
I guess I'll have to call it a bad job.” The sheriff
gathered up his lines, “I’m goin' back now to
get a little rest before the trying times that are
to come to-morrow.”.

Guy arose quickly, leaped out of the Squire's
carriage and climbed into Pettibone's.

“What are you going to do, Herbert?” cried
Vlandingham.
“I’m going on to Concord,” said Guy, with de
termination, “and I don’t want you to run a
needless risk by trying to take me any farther. I

am much obliged to you for bringing me this far,
Squire.”

“Don’t do anything rash, my boy,” returned the
Squire, earnestly.

“Go back with me and wait

until this blows over.”

“I thank you for your consideration, but I am
face to face with a responsibility that I must not

shirk. Had I been in Concord yesterday I could
then and there have branded Col. Keever's state

ments as false. It is a little late in the day, but
I shall do it now. I am grateful to you and Miss
Betty for all that you have done for me,” his
voice trembled a little, “and I shall never forget.
Good-night.”

“Good luck to you, Herbert,” said the Squire,
heartily.
The next moment Pettibone had turned and
started back towards Concord.

CHAPTER XX
UNMASKING A TRAITOR

A great silence hovered over Concord. There
were lights in the drug store, in the Emporium
and in the hotel and in each establishment a knot

of gloomy visaged men was gathered, smoking
much but saying little. The people were thinking
dark thoughts and lashing themselves into a
revengeful mood.
The first uproar following the announcement of
the Concord vote was an eruption of frenzy, a
spontaneous outburst of anger on the part of the
disappointed and angry populace. The calm that
followed this storm was not a presage of peace; it
was rather a warning of disaster when the venge

ful feelings of the people should be directed along
more systematic lines.
Pettibone and Guy, when driving into town,
passed a huge pile of empty boxes and barrels.
“What's that?” Guy asked.

“We were going to celebrate our victory with a
blaze that could be seen as far as Harmony,” the

sheriff answered with a grim laugh, “but you
know how things went and that's the reason that

pile wasn’t touched off. Over on the left, there, is
Pinney's old cannon, loaded to the muzzle with
223

224

His Friend the Enemy

scrap iron. She was to have dropped a remark
that would have been heard clean acrost the

county, but she hasn’t had the heart to let off so

much as a whisper. This town is playin' in tough
luck, Herbert, no two ways about that.”
Pinney's cannon was a small affair but it was

the pride of the town. The druggist had bought
it of a dealer in old iron, in Bismarck, had had it

shipped to Concord and had placed it on guard in
front of his store. Along the rounded side was the
conceit, in red letters, “The Boom Has Struck
Us,” and below, on the carriage, was the com
mercial legend, “Go to Pinney for Drugs.” On the
Fourth of July the cannon was always in pro

nounced evidence; and during a certain Presiden
tial contest, when a candidate not favored by
Pinney had been elected, members of the successful
party had gotten themselves very much disliked

by stealing the cannon and firing a salute. Guy
had been told all this several times, and he was

thinking of it when Pettibone drew the high
stepper to an abrupt halt.
“What's the matter now?” inquired Guy.
“It won’t do to take you through the town,”
was Pettibone's answer.

“I’ve got to go through the town to get to the
hotel.”

“You don’t go to the hotel to-night, not much,”
averred the sheriff firmly. “You’re to bunk at my
house, Herbert.”

“I don’t want to inconvenience you,” the young

Unmasking a Traitor
man demurred.

225

“Mrs. Pettibone will not be ex

pecting—”
“Don’t you worry about Mrs. Pettibone. She'll
be tickled to death to have you with us. She's
another of these blue-eyed women”—the sheriff's
elbow caught Guy smartly in the side—“and, like
all the rest of 'em, she likes to stand by a feller
when he's in trouble. Home you go with me,
Herbert, even if I have to put you under arrest
and take you by force. That's settled.”
Guy could not refuse an invitation of this kind
and Pettibone made a wide détour which brought
them to his house without traversing the main
Street.

The young man assisted the sheriff in taking the
high-stepper out of the thills and Pettibone and

his guest went into the house together. Young
Alec, Pettibone's single hostage to fortune, was in
bed, and it was evident that Mrs. Pettibone had

been keeping an anxious vigil.
“Oh, Dick, Dick 1" she cried, throwing herself

upon her husband's breast, “I was so afraid
something terrible had happened to you. Did you
find those men, those awful men?”
“No, Tilda,” replied the sheriff, “those awful
men have put a wide stretch of country between
themselves and Concord. Don’t you fret about
me.” He removed the clinging arms from about
his neck and turned to Guy. “Tilda, this is Mr.

Herbert. Herbert, the lady who shares my joys.
Observe those bewitchin' blue eyes and—”
I5

His Friend the Enemy

226

“You Dick 1" cried the agitated lady. “Mr.
Herbert, how do you do? Dick has told me a lot
about you and I think just as he does, that the
people of this town ought to be ashamed of them
selves for the way they’ve treated you. Haven't
I said so a hundred times, Dick? You’re a brave
man to come back here now—ain’t he, Dick? But

you're safe as long as you’re under this roof
every bit as safe as you’d be in the place you
came from. Dick'll look after you-won’t you,
Dick?

Goodness me, ain’t it dreadful that we’ve

gone and lost the county-seat? We'll have to go
to Harmony and live now, I s'pose, Dick, and

Alec and I, but I told Dick to resign first and he's
thinking about it. Then there's Col. Keever
could any one imagine that he'd do such a thing
as to say that you were the one who sold us out?
It's outrageous, that's what it is, and I told
Dick—”

So Mrs. Pettibone rattled on, appealing to her
husband constantly but allowing neither him nor
their guest a chance to get in a word. Guy was
very glad when it came time for him to go to bed.

The sheriff was abroad before the young man
got up and at breakfast he reported that nearly
all the men in town were over by Pinney's cannon,

“havin' swarmed there like a lot of crazy hor
nets.”

Some miscreant had stolen into Concord

and fastened a placard to the twelve-pounder—a

placard bearing the words, “A Charge to Keep I
Have.” This was Mrs. Pettibone's signal to hurl

Unmasking a Traitor

227

a torrent of indignant language at the Harmony
people. As this torrent could not be stemmed,
Guy and Pettibone beat a hasty retreat from the
house.

“Where now?” asked the sheriff, heaving a sigh
of relief as he and Guy paused for a moment at
the gate.
“We'll walk over to the cannon,” said Guy. “I
must speak with the people, and this seems as

good a time as I could find for defending myself
against Keever's charges.”
“Worst time you could pick out !” declared the

sheriff. “The people are ripe for somethin’ and
would just as lieve hang you to-day and try you
to-morrow.”
??

“I’m going nevertheless,” returned Guy firmly.
“Is Col. Keever One of the crowd P”

“Not much,” chuckled Pettibone. “Chris Waffle

and Bill Comfort have been watching him all
night so’s he couldn't clear out. The Colonel is
up in that little two-by-twice office of his wonder
ing how the lightning is going to strike, and
when.”

“After I talk with the citizens,” continued Guy,
“I shall go to The Blizzard office and say a few
things to Keever.”

“If you’re able,” qualified Pettibone.
“Pshaw !” exclaimed the young man deprecat
ingly.
“Well, if you're set on it, we'll strike out. I
look for a warm time, though, and that's honest.”

228

His Friend the Enemy

Every male inhabitant of Concord, from the
deserted appearance of the main street, must have

gone to look at that placard on Pinney's cannon.
Store doors were all closed with the exception of
those that gave entrance to the Emporium. Mrs.
Glimmer sat on the steps of her husband's estab
lishment, knitting with fierce fervor and watching
sharply for the Colonel to appear at the top of

the stairs leading from his office. His appearance
would have caused her to ring an alarm on the
bell. She saw Guy, vouchsafed him a startled and

furious glance and rose hastily and flung into the
Store.

“That's the way they feel,” remarked Petti
bone, “every man, woman and child of them.
You're going to have the time of your life.”
“We'll see,” said Guy, the steely flash in his
eyes.

As they passed The Blizzard building the young
man threw an upward look at the sanctum win
dows. Col. Keever, however, was not to be seen.

Presently they turned from the street and came
within sight of the throng of men and boys,
crushing about the cannon and talking in loud
and angry tones.
So concerned were the people about this last

gratuitous fling that Guy and Pettibone were
almost upon them before they were seen. It fell
to Barberry to discover the approaching traitor
and to make his presence known.

“Th-th-there—” stuttered the lawyer, levelling

Unmasking a Traitor

229

a forefinger at Guy and dancing about in a wild
endeavor to acquit himself of his momentous news.
In his excitement the words refused to come;
but his manner and the pointing finger were quite
sufficient. The crowd whirled, an enraged shout
went up and a simultaneous rush was made in
Guy's direction.
“There's the traitor !”

“He hung that card on the cannon l’”
“Hang him to a telegraph pole !”
“Tie him to the mouth of the cannon and fire
it Off!”

“Show him we haven’t got no charge to keep !
Show him—”

Amid the hubbub of angry cries these shouts
came distinctly to Guy's ears. A slight pallor
crossed his face but his determination to face the

mob and defend himself against Keever's charges
was intensified rather than shaken.

“I have come here to talk with you,” the young
man cried, but his words were lost in the con
fusion.

“There has been a mistake—”

The headlong rush of the angry citizens was not
checked. Leffingwell, Pinney, Barberry and Pedro
Smith—yes, even Pedro—were at the head of the
rabble and had come within a dozen feet when

Pettibone jerked a revolver from his hip-pocket
and presented it full in their faces.
Barberry halted so suddenly that he stumbled

and fell heels over head; Pedro Smith paused,
ostensibly to lift the lawyer to his feet, and Lef

His Friend the Enemy

230

fingwell and Pinney, and those behind, came to an
abrupt stop. For a moment not a sound was
heard.

“Stand right where you are !” commanded Pet
tibone.

“If I had the riot act with me I’d read

it, but I'd just as soon shoot first and read it
afterwards.”

“Do we understand, Pettibone,” demanded Lef

fingwell sternly, “that you will defend that
traitor?”

“That's what you're to understand.
traitor.”
“He is !

He is !

He's no

He is !” roared the mob.

“Give him a chance to explain, can't you?”
cried the sheriff. “He could have slipped out of
this town and you'd never have been the wiser,
but he chose to come out here and talk to you. I
told him it was a big risk, but he insisted on

coming. Now that he's here he's going to say
what's on his mind and you'll either listen to him
or there'll be gun-play and fatalities. The law's
behind me, too, don't forget that.”

“That's right,” cried Chris Waffle, pushing out
of the crowd with Bill Comfort at his heels; “I’m
the law but I sha’n’t be behind Pettibone.

bert's entitled to fair play and he's going to have

“That hits off the matter to a t-y, ty,” sec
onded Bill Comfort, pushing up his sleeves and
assuming a pugilistic attitude.

Unmasking a Traitor

23 I

The ardor of the crowd began to cool.

“Well,” snapped Pinney, “if he can’t explain
he'll have to take his medicine.”

“His word is worth more than Keever's bond,”
asserted the Judge. “State your case, Herbert,”
he added, turning to Guy.
“I am told that Col. Keever accuses me of sell

ing out to Squire Vlandingham,” spoke up Guy.
“That statement is false !”

-

“What were you doing at Vlandingham's house
on Monday night?” demanded Leffingwell. “You
were there, we have it on good authority.”
“And all the while you were at Sile Whittaker's,”

supplemented Pinney, “you were arranging to
vote those Jimtown men for Harmony.”
“While I was at Sile Whittaker's, Mr. Pinney,”
Guy retorted, “I was arranging to secure the
Amityville vote for Concord. How did Amity
ville go? The records will prove whether I was
successful or not.”

“Th-th-that was only a r-r-ruse,” stuttered Bar
berry, leaping into the breach Guy had suddenly
made in the case against him.

“Let him tell what he was doin' at Vlanding
ham's,” fluttered Lem Bilkins from the farther

edge of the crowd. “Col. Keever has worked
mighty hard for this town, and he couldn't lie!
He wouldn’t if he could !”

“Bosh, I say, bosh!

He could lie and he DID !”

A hatless, red-haired youth had suddenly raced
around the corner of The Blizzard building and

232

His Friend the Enemy

darted across the level stretch that separated him
from the crowd. It was Sampson, his freckled face
aglow with passion and his eyes gleaming vin
dictively.

“What's more,” the printer added, taking a
folded document from his pocket and shaking it
above his head, “I’ve got proof!”
“Let's see your proof,” said Judge Waffle,

snatching the document from Sampson's hand.
Hurriedly unfolding the paper, the Judge glanced
through it hastily.

“I knew it,” he cried in tri

umphant tones, “I knew it all along ! Where did
you get this, Sampson?”
“Old Keever hasn’t paid me a cent for more'n
a month,” said Sampson, “and when I asked him

for my wages we had a row. He called me every
thin he could lay his tongue to, and then he—he
struck me with his cane!” The printer's voice had
risen shrilly and he swayed sideways to shake his

clenched fist at The Blizzard building. “For that
blow I swore I'd be even, swore I'd have revenge.”
Sampson rattled the ‘r of the last word melo
dramatically. “Monday night Dingle, Harp, Blue
and Boomer drove over from Harmony and made

for Keever's office. I saw 'em, and I went up,
got into the workroom and overheard the whole
thing from beginnin’ to end. When the Harmony
outfit went away, Keever was drunk, so drunk he
was dead to the world, and I sneaked into the
sanctum, took the fifty-dollar bill from his pocket
and that paper from the desk. He dared to hit

Unmasking a Traitor

233

me, he dared!” Sampson closed his remarks in a
high and defiant treble, and once more shook his

fist at the building behind him.
“Read it, Waffle! Read the paper,” clamored
the crowd.

“I will,” cried Waffle. “Citizens of Concord,
you shall learn what a double-dyed scoundrel we
have been harboring among us. Listen I Don't
let a word of this escape you.
“‘Memorandum of agreement made and entered

into this 29th day of June, A. D. 1885, by and
between Isaac Dingle, of the Harmony Townsite

Company, party of the first part, and Archibald
Keever, of Concord, party of the second part:
“‘Witnesseth, that for and in consideration of
the sum of two thousand dollars, fifty dollars in

hand paid, receipt of which is hereby acknowl
edged, the other nineteen hundred and fifty dol
lars to be paid immediately upon the consumma
tion of the provisions of this agreement, the said
Keever hereby covenants and agrees to cause
twenty votes to be cast for Harmony in the
polling place at Concord during the county-seat
election to be held to-morrow, Tuesday, June
30th, throughout Goodwill county.
“‘Witness our hands and seals this day and

year above written.’”
Waffle paused a moment, and then added in
thunderous tones :

234

His Friend the Enemy

“This document, citizens of Concord, is signed
by Isaac Dingle and Archibald Keever; the sig
natures being witnessed by Harp, Blue and
Boomer !”

For a moment the people were stunned, and

during that moment Lemuel Bilkins slipped away
and ran for The Blizzard office as swiftly as his
long legs could carry him.
On recovering from the shock of this revelation,
the mob was fairly beside itself. Hoarse shouts of
rage went up from a score of throats and, as one

man, the gathering started for The Blizzard build
ing. Guy tried to check the citizens and reason

with them, but Pettibone caught him by the
shoulder and jerked him around.
“Herbert,” he said, “you let them alone.
Thank your lucky stars you got out of this as
well as you did.”
“But they'll kill Keever!”

“No, they won't!” put in Chris Waffle, “but
the vials of wrath are uncorked and their con

tents have got to be spilled.”

CHAPTER XXI
THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE

Col. Keever was pluming himself for flight. It
was his intention to wing his way westward,
alighting at Harmony long enough to receive his

nineteen hundred and fifty dollars from the Com
mittee of Ways and Means.
To remain long in Concord would be to court
disaster. The score of men from Jamestown he
had sent to Amityville there to await him and
receive the twenty-four hundred dollars promised

for their services. Mr. Pinchbeck was to pay two
thousand dollars of this sum in the event that

Concord won the contest. Concord having lost—
the men voting their wages out of their hands—

there was no money for them forthcoming. Im
mediately upon collecting the price of his treach
ery from Col. Dingle, Col. Keever's plan was to
give Amityville a wide berth.
Lumber and hardware bills were also due on

account of the court-house. Young Herbert must
shoulder those and, to the end that unpleasant
questions might be avoided, Col. Keever had be

gun his preparations for shaking the dust of
Concord from his feet as early as Tuesday night.
235

His Friend the Enemy

236

It was his desire to depart secretly, but on
opening the front door of his office he found

Christopher Waffle seated on the stairs. Softly
closing the door, the Colonel sought exit from the

rear, and on the back flight he came upon William
Comfort. The Colonel, smothering his wrath,
returned to the sanctum and waited.

Then he

tried again, only to discover that the siege had
not been raised.

During the entire night the

editor made essays at intervals of an hour or so,
but was each time balked by the blockading
forces. There was nothing for it but to remain
where he was and brazen the matter through.
Morning came and found the Colonel asleep in
his chair.

A commotion outside caused him to

move restlessly. What was it he heard?

Excited

and angry cries, a sharp voice haranguing a
mob, an uproar as of men enraged? His faculties
were blunted by his vigil of the night. He could
not reason from point to point and draw proper
inferences. With a stertorous sigh he changed his
position in the chair and slept on.
A few moments more and the outside stairs

echoed with a wild clatter of ascending feet. The
door was burst open and the Colonel started for
ward, aroused and apprehensive. Lemuel Bilkins
was before him, flushed with excitement and
tremulous with fear.

“Run, Colonel !” gasped Bilkins; “for heaven's
sake, run l’’

The Colonel's pudgy face went white in a flash.

The Voice of the People

237

“What's the matter, Lemuel?” he demanded,
starting to his feet.
“Herbert's in town—he tried to talk to

the

people—they accused him of makin' those Jim
town fellows vote for Harmony—they were goin'
for him hammer and tongs when—when—”
Bilkins, clutching at the desk for support, halted
to catch his breath.

“When what?” asked the Colonel in a husky

whisper. “Speak out, can’t you?”
“When Sampson jumped up beside Herbert and
gave Chris Waffle a paper to read to the crowd.”

Bilkins drew a sleeve across his dripping forehead.
“It was an agreement between you and the Har
mony people, and—”
The Colonel fell over against the partition with
a hollow groan. Now he knew what had become

of that document, and where his fifty dollars had
gone !

At that instant clamorous shouts, drawing
nearer and nearer, were heard without, swift feet
ascended the stairs, and suddenly there came a
roar :

“Lynch him '''
“Ride him out of town l”

“Sack the office-pull it

down

about his

ears l’’

“There they come!” burst out Bilkins. “Hurry,
Colonel ! There's lots of trouble, lots of it !”

He

took down the Colonel’s hat and cane in feverish
haste. “Go down the back stairs and run for

238

His Friend the Enemy

your life, Colonel,” he implored, “while I stay
here and keep them off.”

“Hold 'em off, Lem,” cried the Colonel, taking
his hat and cane. “Do your duty, boy!”
Thereupon the great man started for the rear exit.
He proceeded with more haste, however, than

was consistent with safety. Missing the top step
of the flight he tried to regain his balance by
catching the next one, but in vain. Down he fell,
tumbling over and over.
When he recovered himself, he found that he was
sitting on the damp earth, his position in no wise

suggestive of dignity. His head had been forced
through the crown of his hat and he was endeav
oring, in a wild way, to get a view of his sur
roundings, when Christopher Waffle, Bill Comfort,

McQuilkin, Glimmer and Sampson pounced upon
him.

“Stand off!” commanded the Colonel, shaking
his cane, to which he still adhered with a life-and

death tenacity. “I’ll have the law on you!
Egad, I'll call you out !”
This was the great man's last defiance.

“Caught !” cried Comfort, laying hold of him
and dragging him towards the street.
While the people in the street were deliberating
on the fate Keever should suffer at their hands,
there was borne to their ears a crash of glass and

a form containing a chase full of type for the de
layed issue of The Blizzard came crashing to the

ground. This was followed by documents, copy

239

and old papers, which were caught by the wind
and scattered broadcast.

Then there were sounds

of hammering and heavy falls that shook the
building to its very foundations, while type cases
and type, rollers, brushes, cans of ink and lye and
every conceivable thing known to a pioneer news
paper office came raining down from every door
and window.

Pinney came out on the steps of the Emporium
with a rope, which he waved frantically above his
head.

“Hang him !” he shouted; “hang the scoun
drel !”

-

Guy appeared at the druggist's side as if by
magic and snatched the rope from his hands.
“No,” cried Guy sternly. “Nothing of that
kind.”

“A rail, a rail !” yelled Sampson, ceasing a mad
dance around his former employer for the pur

pose of offering the suggestion. “Ride the gentle
man out of town l’’

In lieu of a rail, a length of “four-by-four” was
secured, Keever was placed astride it and then

carried, amid hoots and jeers, along the entire
length of the main street.
And a melancholy figure the doughty Colonel
presented.
That white hat, so often and proudly declared
to be the badge of his political rank and social
position, was still about his ears, while the crown,
hinged by a thread at the back, opened and closed

24o

His Friend the Enemy

with every movement of the four stout men who
carried the timber on their shoulders.

The Colonel's clothes were torn, one end of his
collar was flapping dismally about his neck and
he had lost a shoe, but never once did he forget
himself and release his hold on his cane.

Some two miles out of town the angry citizens
dropped their victim roughly and gave him warn

ing, in terms more forcible than polite, never more
to show his face within the corporate limits of
Concord.

Sampson was the last of the indignant people to
make his way back to town. As he was about to

pass from sight he turned for one final glimpse of
his former employer.
And there the Colonel sat, he, the great man

who had raised out of nothing that monument of
tireless energy and intellectual grandeur, The
Concord Blizzard. The monument was gone—had
passed away in a breath—and there he sat, soli
tary and alone, pondering the depth of his fall.
And Sampson—was he touched by the woful

spectacle?
Rearing himself to his full height, he gave a
shout of triumph and waved
“Hit me with your cane!”

fist, whirled about

and continued on towards Concord.

He had carried his vengeance to a point which

would have satisfied an ordinary mortal, but there

The Voice of the People

24 I

was nothing ordinary about Sampson. His ire
had mounted high, not only against the Colonel,

but against everything that had formed a part
and parcel of The Blizzard's equipment. The
newspaper had gasped its last under the stran

gling fingers of the mob, so that nothing remained
save the building that had housed the “plant,”
and even that was hateful to the printer.
While plodding homeward his thoughts were
more than busy, and he evolved an idea that
caused him to slap his skinny hands together and
laugh impishly.
“It'll be the last act,” he muttered, “and the
town’ll have somethin that'll help to keep my
memory green. I’ll do it—yes, sir, I'll do it if it
takes a leg !”
In pursuance of his plan Sampson re-entered the
town by stealth. Screened by the water-tank he
cautiously reconnoitered the situation and dis

covered that the weary and perspiring citizens
were gathering about the doors of the hotel.
Nothing could have been more favorable, and
Sampson gave vent to an unholy chuckle.
“Mebby they won’t be surprised,” he whispered
to himself, “oh, mebby they won't!”
Warily he crossed the railroad track, crawled on
hands and knees the full length of several piles of

railroad ties and then, by skilful manoeuvering,
gained the rear of the hotel unseen. From this
point the course was clear and he did not halt
until he reached the cannon.
I6

24.2

His Friend the Enemy

Excepting Sampson, there was not a soul any
where in the vicinity of the twelve-pounder. Mrs.
Glimmer, now that the Colonel had been removed
from the town, had retired into the Emporium
with her knitting, and her husband was still lin

gering among those who hovered about the hotel.
Herkimer was on duty in the livery barn, but the
troubles of the town were nothing to him and he
was cleaning harness in the harness room.
Sampson's nefarious work might have been wit
nessed by any one who chanced to stand in front
of the Emporium or the livery barn, and hence it
will be seen how fortune continued to favor him.

“We'll salute The Blizzard,” muttered Sampson,

with a laugh of the demoniacal kind; “we’ll give
The Blizzard a boom !”

Then he tugged and pushed with tremendous

energy until he had brought the muzzle of the
cannon in line with The Blizzard building. When
this was accomplished, he fished a match out of

his pocket and struck it against the side of the
gun.

From the fact that this particular piece of ar

tillery had been purchased of a junk dealer it had
never had the full and unqualified confidence of

those who were designated to fire it off. As a
precaution, therefore, it was usually discharged by
means of a “two-minute fuse”—the two minutes,

grace being utilized by the man who lighted the
fuse in placing himself at a safe distance.

This

precautionary measure was well known to Samp

The Voice of the People

243

son and after he had applied the match he took
to his heels. He did not get too far away, how
ever, for he wanted to witness the devastation.
While he stood, watching and waiting, he sud
denly remembered that some dynamite, left over
from the operations of the imported road-builders,

was stored in the first story of the structure on
which he had trained the cannon; and besides the

dynamite there was also an assortment of fire
works, bought with a fund raised by popular

subscription, to be used in celebrating the coming
Fourth of July.

“Great Scott!” murmured Sampson huskily.
By a wild impulse he started towards the can

non; then he turned abruptly, gave a despairing
groan and made in the opposite direction, pallid,
fearful, and bent only on getting away from the
scene of his rash deed before the direful conse

quences could overtake him.

CHAPTER XXII
A FORTUNATE DISASTER

Pettibone had remained discreetly in the back

ground during the spilling of those “vials of
wrath.” Guy had also kept clear of the mob, but
his reason for doing so was different from Petti
bone's.

If an investigation had followed that morning's
work it might reasonably have been asked why, if
the sheriff was present, he had not performed his

sworn duty and prevented a destruction of prop
erty and the subsequent violence which had been
visited upon a citizen of the town, culpable though
he undoubtedly was. Pettibone forestalled the

question by taking himself out of the way.
As for Guy, he had suffered by the Colonel's
misdoing far more than any one else in Concord
and might have been excused the desire to see

punishment fall where it was so justly deserved.
But the desire was lacking.

He did not care to

glory in the Colonel's downfall, much less to wit
ness it. So, after the citizens had disappeared
with the hated offender, he seated himself on the

hotel veranda and was presently joined by the
sheriff.
245

246

His Friend the Enemy

“The activities of our friend the Colonel will

now be transferred to other quarters,” observed
Pettibone, bringing a chair from the office and

dropping into it with a deep breath of satisfac
tion. “Heaven help the other quarters!” he
added soulfully. “Herbert, if it hadn't been for
that red-headed printer I hate to think what
might have happened to you.”
“Truth, crushed to earth, will rise again,”

smiled the young man.
“And the way of the transgressor is mighty
hard—as the Colonel has probably discovered by
this time.” Pettibone took an old pipe from one

pocket, a handful of tobacco from another, and
was soon shrouded in a cloud of smoke. “Lone
some Will used to be loaded to the water-line with

all these here proverbs, old sayin's, wise saws, and
so on. Had one for 'most every occasion. Ever
hear about Lonesome Will, Herbert?”
&4

NO.”

“He was a Harmony man and he's dead now.

Didn't live in Harmony but was on that side of
the county, you understand. Miss Blue-Eyes
knows all about him”—Pettibone looked at Guy
with a twinkle—“and some time, when the signs
are just right, you get her to tell you about
Lonesome Will.”

“What do you mean by the signs being just

right?”
“Sunshine—moonlight might do—you two alone,
then the story, then a heart-to-heart talk—”

A Fortunate Disaster

247

“Pshaw !” interrupted Guy, reddening.
“All right,” laughed Pettibone, “we’ll change

the subject. Heard just how the voting came
Out?”

“I know that Concord lost and that's enough
for me.”

“Forty-nine votes were cast in the Concord

polling-place,” the sheriff went on, “and only
twenty-five of the forty-nine were favorable to
this town. Twenty of the remaining twenty-four
were, as a matter of course, cast by those hood
lums from Jimtown, but who were the other four
that voted here and voted for Harmony?”
Guy shook his head. He had it in mind to
name Sampson as one of the four, but refrained.
“Some of the farmers who come in here to ex

ercise the right of franchise must have been bought

up by the other side,” proceeded Pettibone.
“Amityville, going solid for us, was the biggest
kind of a surprise, and when you explained how
it happened, over there by Pinney's cannon, you
made your first tally.”
“I’m not particularly proud of that,” said the
young man. “I suppose, though, that the only
-

way to fight the devil is with fire.”
“It's all in your point of view,” chuckled the
sheriff. “Politics is a muddy country and you
can’t go through it and keep your shoes clean.
But, to come back to the election, it was the

great big vote rolled up by Harmony that settled
the case. Vlandingham's people presented him

His Friend the Enemy

248

with eighty-one ballots | Think of that. Several
votes could be thrown out and Harmony would
still have more than a two-thirds majority. We're
done up brown, Herbert, that's sure.”

“Let's accept the defeat as gracefully as we
can,” returned Guy. “What will you do, Petti
bone? Move over to Harmony?”
“No Harmony for me. After a little I'm going
to resign.

You see, I've got a nice eighty joining

the corner of this townsite and I was thinking, if
Concord won, that I'd block it off into lots and
call it

“Pettibone's Addition.”

Now that I’ve

woke up, and found that was a dream, I guess I'll

farm it.” He was silent for a minute, puffing re
flectively at his pipe. “There's one thing that's
worrying me, Herbert,” he added, finally.
“What is that?”

“I’m not much on religion, although I’ve got a
streak of veneration in me all the same, and I’m
telling you that when people sow the wind they're
going to reap the whirlwind. That's gospel, ain’t
it?”

“I believe so; but how does it apply to this
county-seat affair?”
“Well, now, there's the Colonel.” Pettibone re

moved his pipe from his mouth and waved it in
the direction of the returning mob whose van
guard was coming into sight along the railroad
track, to the west. “We know what he sowed and

we know what he reaped—purty near.
We?”

Don't

A Fortunate Disaster
66

249

Yes.”

“To go still further then, do you think that
running in a lot of rowdies from Jimtown and
Bismarck, as Concord and Harmony have done,

is anything more or less than sowing trouble? I
don’t; and if we don't reap a cyclone I'll miss my

guess. Don't make a mistake, Herbert, and think
I'm a calamity howler, 'cause I ain’t, God knows.
But I'm in dead earnest with you, now, and I say
we haven’t reached the end.

We've had our dance

and we've got to pay the fiddler. Those Jimtown
hoodlums got out of town purty fast, Tuesday

night, but I’m positive they had an understanding
with Keever, and I’m just as positive that what
ever Keever has agreed to do by 'em he won’t do.
Work a real injury to a man-a man that hasn’t

any scruples to speak of—and you make out of
him an engyne of destruction. Ketch my mean
ing? It's the next thing to saying that possibly
the position of sheriff in this county of Goodwill

won't be quite so much of a sinecure during the
next few days as it has been up to now. That's

why I'm delayin' my resignation.”
Guy's mind was debating Pettibone's momen
tous words when Pinney, Leffingwell and Pedro
Smith came wearily up to the veranda and threw
themselves down on the steps. The rest of the

party straggled along after them by twos and
threes, dropping on the ground the moment they

reached the shady side of the hotel building. They
were all dusty, tired and perspiring, but a calm

25o

His Friend the Enemy

sense of duty well done brought a glow of satis
faction to every face.
Nothing was said for some time; then Mr. Glim
mer, seated on the edge of the veranda, fanning
himself with his hat, lifted his voice:
“Sic semper tyrannis,” said he, glaring about
him through his spectacles.
In those quarters where it was understood the
remark was duly approved.
-

“Gentlemen,” remarked Pinney, rising to his
feet, “the people have spoken in no uncertain
tone. The torrent of-of-of popular wrath and—
er-righteous indignation has overflowed its banks
and engulfed the common enemy.”
He ceased. There was general surprise, for no
one had imagined that the druggist could plume
his speech with such rhetoric. Emboldened by a
ripple of applause the speaker continued:

“Like lightning from a clear sky the depth of
this man Keever's perfidy was suddenly made
known to us. We did not pause, we did not hesi
tate. We leaped forward as one man and then

the-er-heavenly artillery boomed out, zig-zag
flashes bespangled the firmament, the earth trem
bled, opened and Keever was—er-er-swallowed
from the sight of man. The voice of the people
had been heard | The hand of the people had been
felt l”

This magnificent period was received by the

gathering in silent awe. Pinney's thunder had
defied nature by preceding the lightning, but that

A Fortunate Disaster

25 I

was a minor point. As he stood before them,
erect and glowing with his impromptu effort, it
seemed to the citizens as though the mantle of the

editor had fallen upon the shoulders of the drug
gist.

As if to emphasize and illustrate the figurative
terms of the orator, a hoarse BOOM from the

lower end of the main street tagged closely upon
the heels of his peroration. It was the cannon |
Pinney and the others recognized the sound but

had barely time to exchange apprehensive glances
when a terrific detonation shook the earth, set
every building in town a-quiver, crashed into
fragments all the glass in all the windows and
hurled

Glimmer from the veranda and levelled

Pinney in his tracks.
A lurid glare, ghastly in the white light of day,
hovered sullenly over Concord. Swiftly it faded,
débris began to rain down and rockets and
Roman candles opened a furious bombardment

with their flaming balls. Strange serpentine things
left fiery trails in the streets and open spaces, or
wriggled in glowing lines over the rooftops, or
streaked luminously through the air, exploding as
they vanished; pin-wheels sputtered above and
below and flashed into nothing with a shower of

sparks; fire-crackers popped merrily here, there
and everywhere, a bass note being frequently
sounded by one of the “cannon” variety; and in
front of the hotel a wonderful contrivance came

plumping down and forthwith unbosomed itself of

252

His Friend the Enemy

a veritable whirlwind of blazing vagaries, closing
with a beacon that changed from red to white,
and then to blue.

Then there ensued a lull in the

wild confusion of fire and noise, and Glimmer,

raising himself from the ground, pointed across
the street towards the roof of the Townsite Com

pany's building. “Look!” he cried, huskily.
The eyes of the bewildered people followed the
pointing finger and beheld a “set-piece” whose in

tricate wires had become entangled with the cop
ing of the roof. Thus held the device was sputter
ing and hissing, and tracing in blood-red letters
the ironical word VICTORY |

What had happened? Eyes sought eyes and put
the silent question. The citizens began to move
mechanically as though awakening from some
horrible nightmare. Women and small children

could be seen rushing from their dwellings and
could be heard screaming and lamenting. A runa
way team, with a lumber wagon bounding behind,
plunged across the railroad track and disappeared
beyond the depot. Stray cows galloped from

point to point with frenzied bellows, and dogs
crouched shivering and whining in any chance
corner that might afford protection.

“The Blizzard building !” cried Pettibone, dash
ing one hand across his eyes. “There was dyna
mite there and the fireworks for the Fourth !

It's blown up !”
He sprang from the veranda and started south
at a run, the people following.

A Fortunate Disaster

253

“Never mind The Blizzard building !” shouted
Guy, keenly alive to the dangers of the moment.
“Fires may result from all this ! Go to your
homes and stores, quiet your families and guard

against fires !”
This warning struck home and the frightened

crowd disintegrated in every direction. Guy, as
soon as he made sure his advice would be acted

upon, hurried down the street in the direction
taken by Pettibone. As he ran he noticed the
broken windows on either side and observed that

the litter of splintered boards increased as he ad
vanced. At last he reached the spot where The
Blizzard building had stood only to find that it

had disappeared, a deep hole in the earth marking
its site. More débris was banked up about the brink
of the hole and on the highest part of the heap
stood the sheriff.

“Ain’t this the worst you ever heard, Herbert?”
Pettibone called to Guy. “I argued against hav
ing that dynamite stored here but Keever had his
say, as usual. “It's under me, not you,” he says,
and that settled it. Looket that cannon,” he
added, waving his hand towards the gun around

whose muzzle a broken window-frame was hang
ing; “some 'un pointed it this way and touched
it off.

Who was it?

That's what I’d like to

know. If there had been as much of that dyna
mite in the store-room as there was a month ago,
I’m telling you Concord would have been wiped
off the map.”

254

His Friend the Enemy

Guy climbed up beside Pettibone and surveyed
the ruin from that position. The building, flimsily
constructed at best, had been literally riven asun
der, the walls blown to fragments and crushed
back and the roof scattered piecemeal over the
whole townsite. For fully ten feet downward the
earth had been displaced, heaved up at the sides
and hurled over the broken boards and timbers.

The sheriff, talking under his breath and shaking
his head gloomily, moved off towards the cannon
and Guy lowered himself carefully down the ragged
sides of the pit. He saw something that startled
him. It was an object, irregular in shape and
little larger than a man's fist. Picking up the
fragment with trembling hands, he pinched it in
his fingers, examined it on every side and then
dropped it into his pocket.

He was pale with excitement, and looked up
wards in the hope of seeing some one to whom he
could announce his “find.” But the sheriff had
not returned and there was no one else to hear

his news. Suddenly a doubt swept through his

brain. That fragment might have been in the
store-room at the time of the explosion and—
He pressed one hand to his forehead and stood for
a second immovable; the next moment he had

hurried stumblingly to the deepest part of the
pit, had sunk to his knees and had begun scraping
away the earth with his hands.

“No, no,” he whispered; “here's where it came
from, right here !” He got up and stamped with

A Fortunate Disaster

255

his heel in half a dozen different places. “There
is no doubt,” he said to himself, “no doubt in the
world.”

Climbing out of the pit, he dropped down on the

heap of ruins and bowed his face in his hands.
“What ails you, Herbert?”
It was Pettibone. He had approached unno
ticed and was standing at the young man's elbow.

“What ails me?” Guy repeated, laughing jerkily.
“Oh, nothing, nothing! Is it you, Pettibone?”
He reached out and caught the sheriff's arm,

raising himself slowly. His face was still pale but
his eyes were bright and growing brighter. “What
makes you think that there is anything the mat
ter with me?” he asked.

“Great Scott!” exclaimed the sheriff. “I only
have to look at you to see that there's something
up.”
“You own eighty acres adjoining this townsite,

do you, Pettibone?”
“Yes,” returned the other, wonderingly.
“Then keep it; don’t sell it, no matter what

you're offered. Tell every one else who owns land
around this town to hold on to what they've got.

It's possible, Pettibone,” Guy brought his lips
close to Pettibone's ear, “that your eighty will
make you rich.”
Pettibone recoiled a step and looked at the
young man sharply.
“Are you crazy, or what?” he demanded.

Guy laughed again, this time more naturally.

256

His Friend the Enemy

“I’m not a prophet exactly,” said he, “but un

less I’m very much mistaken the blowing up of
this building will prove the making cf Concord.
Let Harmony have the county-seat; if 1 am not
deceived, Concord has got something a hundred

times more valuable. Don't look at me that way,
Pettibone. I'm not raving and my mind is just as
clear as yours is, this minute. The man, whoever

he was, who poured a broadside from Pinney's
cannon into The Blizzard building, is entitled to a

vote of thanks by every one in this community.”
Guy turned and walked away and Pettibone
looked after him, thunderstruck.
“Merciful powers!” muttered the sheriff. “Can

it be that the loss of the county-seat and a slump
in the value of twelve hundred lots, more or less,
has turned Herbert's brain?

I never saw him like

that before; it ain’t natural—no, sir, not with
him.”

Two hours later an east-bound freight train
backed along the Concord siding, picked up a box
car and steamed away with it in the direction of

Jamestown. This box car would technically have
been called an “empty.” But it was not empty,
in the strict meaning of the word, for Sampson
was inside, far gone with terror because of the
havoc he had wrought and scarcely daring to
breathe until Concord had been left safely behind
him.

CHAPTER XXIII
DEVELOPING THE GREAT DISCOVERY

No fires, no fatalities, no one even seriously

injured ! This was the remarkable record of the
morning of that red-letter day when Col. Keever
was banished the town and when Sampson fired
into The Blizzard building and blew it to the four
winds. There was a property loss, to be sure, for

apart from the destruction of the printing estab
lishment and the roof that had sheltered it—the

Colonel owning a small equity in each-not a
whole pane of glass had been left in any building
in Concord.

Whether the town was worth the expense and
trouble of re-glazing its windows was a query

propounded by Mr. Biggs, the register of deeds.
This matter was discussed in a spirit of levity and

sarcasm, not seriously. And when it was found
that Mr. Biggs had spoken in sober earnest and
was to leave for Harmony on the six-thirty
freight, the levity and sarcasm gave place to
scorn and derision.

Mr. Biggs, carrying a carpet-bag and bandbox
filled with his worldly goods, was accompanied to
the train by a procession of citizens. Pedro
17

257

258

His Friend the Enemy

Smith had a fife and Bill Comfort a drum, and
there were hastily devised brown-paper signs borne
aloft, some of them reading: “Our Gain is Har
mony's Loss,” “Drummed Out of Town,” “The
Only One to Go,” and “What Was He Good For
Anyhow?”
It is needless to say that this honor was en

tirely unsolicited by Mr. Biggs or that he failed to
shake hands with the delegation before climbing
the steps of the way-car and dodging inside to
escape the missiles that were hurled at him.
Later that evening Guy had a very serious dis
cussion with Pettibone in one corner of the hotel

office. In the course of an hour the young man
succeeded not only in convincing the sheriff of his
sanity but of several other important matters

which vitally concerned the future of Concord.
“Herbert,” said Pettibone, shaking hands with

Guy when ready to go, “you're a brick | There's
one chance in ten that you're wrong, or that the

business won't pan out, but the other nine chances
are good enough for me. Keep it quiet for a while.”
“The men who own the land around here ought
to know about it for their own protection.”
“Trust me; I'll tell every one that's interested.”
Pettibone strode off with a beaming face and an
unwonted look in his eyes. He was alive to the

possibilities of Guy’s “great discovery” and his
awakening had brought with it no small amount
of excitement.

The young man slept but little that night, for

Developing the Great Discovery 259
his brain continued to busy itself with stray
thoughts and half-formed plans. He was astir
early and after an early breakfast walked over to
the “Pettibone eighty” and found its owner hard
at work with a shovel.

“I’ve told everybody that ought to know,” said

Pettibone, leaning on the shovel and looking up
at Guy from the hole he was digging, “and I can

tell you of five others who got to tearing at the
ground before sun-up.”
“Strange the discovery was never made before,”
remarked Guy.
“How could it have been made except by an
explosion like we had yesterday?”
“Why, in digging cellars, or wells—”
“All the wells around here are driven,” inter

-

??

rupted Pettibone, “not a one of 'em dug. And as
for cellars, I suppose there are a few, cyclone
cellars and the like, but they're not down over six
feet if they're that.

By noon, Herbert, I'll be able

to tell you whether your theory is straight goods
or only moonshine.”

“Let me know when you find out.”
“Count On that.”

Guy returned to the hotel and composed himself
to await reports of the “development work.”
While he was sitting on the veranda the train
from the west drew up at the depot platform and
he was very much surprised to see no less a per
sonage than Mr. Pinchbeck alight and turn his
steps in the direction of the hotel.

26o

His Friend the Enemy

“By Jovel” exclaimed Guy, as a particularly
bright thought came to him, “he's just the fel
low !”

“My condolences, Mr. Herbert,” said the capital
ist, tendering Guy his right hand and grabbing
his glasses with his left.

“Thank you,” returned Guy, smiling a little as
he shook the outstretched hand.

“Have you

come to find out how Concord is taking her de
feat, Mr. Pinchbeck?”
“Not that exactly. I was curious to see the
effects of that explosion you had here yesterday.
We heard it in Harmony and couldn't imagine
what was up. Others from there would have come
with me, but they didn’t think it was hardly safe.
By the way,” and here Pinchbeck put his refrac
tory glasses in his pocket and vouchsafed the

young man a near-sighted squint, “you are alive
after all, aren't you?”
“Very much,” laughed Guy.
“We had it in Harmony that you had been
blown from the mouth of a cannon, hung from a
telegraph pole, tarred and feathered and ridden
out of town, and I don’t know what all.”
“Preposterous !” exclaimed Guy, his thoughts at

once reverting to Miss Betty.
“After the treatment accorded Col. Keever,”
said Mr. Pinchbeck, “we could believe almost any
thing of Concord. Not that Keever didn't deserve

all he got,” he added hastily; “it’s the lawlessness
we deplore.”

-

Developing the Great Discovery 261
“Do you know what became of Col. Keever, Mr.
Pinchbeck?” Guy himself deplored the lawlessness
and was anxious to turn to another side of the

subject.

The capitalist laughed softly.
“The Colonel limped into Harmony about noon
yesterday,” said he, “a melancholy spectacle if
there ever was one. He could barely drag himself
to the edge of the depot platform, and there he
sat, his hands on the head of his cane and his

chin on his hands. Really, he looked as though
a hadn't a friend in the world. Dingle, Harp,
Blue and Boomer heard he was in town and they
walked to the depot and paid him something like
nineteen hundred dollars—”

“The price of his treachery,” interjected Guy.
“So I was told. Dingle invited him to go to the
hotel, and Keever would have accepted the invita
tion, I guess, if Miss Vlandingham hadn't driven

up just then. She had been fully informed of the
transaction between Keever and the Committee of

Ways and Means, and my, my l” Mr. Pinchbeck

shrugged his shoulders, compressed his lips and
looked wildly at Guy. “If you're ever told that
that girl hasn’t a temper, don't believe it. The
lecture she read to Keever was so hot it made

him fairly shrivel. And she didn't confine herself
to the Colonel, either, but turned her fire on

Dingle, Harp, Blue and Boomer and kept it going
until she had given them a thorough understand

ing of what she thought of their doings. When

262

His Friend the Enemy

she was through, she ordered Keever out of town
on the first train, east or west, and drove off.
Gracious ! That was a talk to remember, Her
bert.”

“It is difficult to understand Miss Vlanding
ham, at times,” said Guy, wondering why she

should applaud him for securing the Amityville
vote and then turn squarely about and condemn

Dingle and his associates for securing the James
town contingent through the Colonel.
“Difficult?” echoed Mr. Pinchbeck; “impossible,

sir, impossible ! But she always has the courage
of her convictions.”

“Always 1” added Guy, and spoke in such a tone
that the other shot a swift glance at him. Guy
met the glance calmly, and asked: “Do you want
that block of Concord lots, Mr. Pinchbeck?”
“Hardly,” was the reply, with an expansive
smile.

“Suppose I could convince you that it would be
a good investment?”
“It would be impossible for you to do that.”
“I would like to try, at any rate. Will you

come up-stairs with me to my room? I have
something there I wish to show you.”
“Certainly, if you wish it, but I tell you plainly
that I have already closed with Vlandingham.

Harmony is the coming town

of Goodwill

county.”

The young man made no response but led the
way into the hotel and up to his room. For more

Developing the Great Discovery 263
than an hour he was closeted with the capitalist
and the latter was a highly excited man when

they reappeared. Accompanied by Guy Mr. Pinch
beck paid a visit to the hole in the earth where
The Blizzard building had stood, descended into
it and went down on his knees at the deepest

part. He was even more excited when he climbed
out of the pit. A horse and carriage were secured
and Guy drove the capitalist to Pettibone's

“eighty.” The perspiring sheriff had just found
what he was looking for and was wildly hilarious.
The commercial instinct was snapping in Pinch
beck's eyes as he examined the broken fragment

which Pettibone had to show for his morning's
work.

“There are others digging, you say?” asked
Pinchbeck in a business-like tone.

Pettibone replied affirmatively and indicated the
various points where development work was in
progress.

“Let’s go to these places, Herbert,” said Pinch
beck.

The round was made and when the young man
and the capitalist returned to Concord they were

of one mind regarding the bright future that lay
before the town.

“You should

have kept this to yourself,

Herbert,” commented Pinchbeck, “and secured

options on all the land around here.”
“That isn’t the way I was brought up,” re
turned Guy.

264

His Friend the Enemy

“Ah!” murmured the capitalist with a slight
curl of the upper lip. “You expect to make your

money out of the lots?”
&4

Yes.”

“May I still have an option on that block at
the original figure?”
“Until Saturday, Mr. Pinchbeck.”
“Very well. I'm going to Jamestown by first
train and will take some of the stuff with me.

Meanwhile, it would be well for you to go to
Amityville and have a good talk with Abe Landy.”
“Landy is probably anxious to have a good
talk with me, about now,” said Guy with a short
laugh. “I shall ride over there this afternoon.”

“Let me impress upon you the necessity of keep
ing this as quiet as possible for the present,” said
Pinchbeck with great earnestness. “You thought
it best to notify those directly interested and I
shall not quarrel with you on that point, but
there is no earthly use in publishing the news yet
awhile.”

“I have not published the news,” said Guy,
“and do not intend to do so. Those already noti
fied have their instructions to say nothing until
the proper time arrives.”

Immediately after dinner Guy secured a saddle
horse, stuffed samples of the material that prom

ised such wonders for Concord into a pair of
saddle-bags and started for Amityville by the
south road—the one that led past Lake Elizabeth.
Much as he desired to visit Harmony he had yet

Developing the Great Discovery 265
decided not to do so on the way to Amityville
but on his return.

He could then inform

Miss

Betty—and incidentally the Squire—of recent
events in Concord. Man proposes, however, and
fate wills otherwise. Half a mile beyond the lake
he met Miss Betty, out for a canter on one of her
father's spirited horses.
A vision of rare loveliness Guy thought her,
gowned in her riding habit and skilfully curbing
the high-bred animal she rode. Why was it, he
asked himself, that every time he saw her she ap

peared more and more beautiful in his eyes?
“Well, Mr. Herbert l” she cried, her eyes danc

ing. “Is this what you call keeping your promise
to let us know of your safety and well-being?
Thursday, sir, and it was Tuesday night when

you left Harmony to plunge into the thick of your
enemies! We have heard dreadful things about

you.” She turned her horse and continued on at
his side.

“You said you had faith in my ability to look
out for number one,” he smiled.

“The sight of you, alive and apparently well”
—she gave him an artful side glance—“proves
that my confidence was not misplaced. We will
ride straight to Willowview and there you shall

render a full and accurate account of everything
that has happened to you since that fateful Tues
day night.

Come, I'll race you to Harmony l’”

“Nothing would please me more, Miss Vlanding
ham, if I were going to Harmony.”

266

His Friend the Enemy

“Then you were not coming to see us, after
all?” She turned her face full upon him.
“Oh, yes,” he replied; “on my way back from

Amityville.”
“Very well,” she said. “My father and I are
both very. eager to hear of the exciting events
that have taken place in that town of yours.”
“Concord, it seems, has not had a monopoly of
the exciting events,” Guy observed.
“No?” she returned interrogatively. “Where

else in the county has anything recently occurred
that is worth mentioning?”
“Mr. Pinchbeck was telling me, this morning,
how Col. Keever paid Harmony a flying visit and

collected the money due him from the Committee
of Ways and Means.”
Deep color flashed into Miss Betty's face.
“Mr. Pinchbeck is very observing,” said she.
“I presume he also told you how Miss Vlanding
ham stormed at the Colonel and hurled her scath

ing denunciations at the Committee?” She did

not wait for Guy to answer but continued hastily,
with a touch of bitterness in her voice: “Oh, if I

had only known of that call the Committee made
on Col. Keever, Monday night !”
“What would you have done?” asked Guy quietly.
“Done?” she repeated, with sparkling eyes. “I
would not have countenanced the proceeding;
that infamous bargain would not have been made.”
“If that bargain had not been made Harmony
would not have secured the county-seat.”

Developing the Great Discovery 267
“County-seat l” she echoed in fine scorn. “Is
that all we have to think about, or live for? The
whole town of Harmony is as nothing weighed in
the balance with that despicable piece of work l’”
Guy quite lost his breath.
“Why,” he murmured, “when I made it an ob
ject for those Amityville men to vote for Har

mony you found no fault with me for doing
it.”

“Therefore you think me inconsistent 1” she

exclaimed. “But that was far from being a
parallel case. You took my father's weapons out

of his hands and won the Amityville people by
his own methods. I was proud of you for that.
Suppose, however, you had come to Harmony like
a thief in the night, suppose you had plied Col.
Dingle with liquor until he was intoxicated, and
suppose you had there and then hired him to

make those men from Bismarck-men working for
my father, mind, and drawing their pay from him
—suppose you had hired Col. Dingle to make
those men vote for Concord? If you had done

that, Guy Herbert, you would have been beneath
contempt !”
Her eyes gleamed, her bosom heaved under its
stress of passion and her words came clear and

keen. Guy gazed at her mutely. As she stated
the case it looked altogether different to him.

“But you would not have done such a thing,”
she went on, “you could not have done it!

Nor

would you wrong me by thinking I had the slight

268

His Friend the Enemy

est knowledge of what was going forward, or by
my silence gave even a tacit consent to it. You
did not think that, did you? Tell me, please tell
me you did not!”
There was a pleading tone in her voice, and a
suggestion of tears in her eyes.
“I was sure you knew nothing about that,”
said Guy.
“Why were you sure of it?” she asked, looking
-

at him steadily. “Had I not told you that it
was all a case of diamond cut diamond? Did you
not see me actively engaged in the stealing of
your court-house?”
“Those were not parallel cases,” he answered in
her own words. “But for you, Miss Vlandingham,
this contest would have been a sanguinary one.
I had no influence; you threw the weight of yours
into the scales and by a diplomacy as rare as it
was skilful warded off the violence that seemed
bound to come. The loss of one life would not

have paid for a dozen county-seats.”
There was a strange something in the blue eyes
as they bent upon him and why could he not read

their mystery?
“If I could undo the wrong,” said she after a
brief pause, “if the election might be recalled and

held over again, believe me, Concord would hold
its own. Why did you not tell me, Mr. Herbert,
that success or failure meant so much to you?
Mr. Whittaker told us all-everything that you

were so careful to hide from us. Were you afraid

Developing the Great Discovery 269
of our generosity, afraid we should think less of
you or—or—”

Her voice choked; tears started from her eyes,
and she abruptly turned from him and darted
away along the road that led to Harmony.
“Betty 1" he called after her; “Betty l’”
Her answer was a quick use of the whip and

never a backward glance did she deign him. He
struck into a gallop with the intention of over
taking her, but by that time her horse was at a

run and pursuit on a livery hack was simply a
useless effort. As he drew to a slower pace, she
looked around and flourished her whip.

“We shall expect you this evening,” she cried,
and continued on her way at a more leisurely pace.
Twenty minutes later she was at Willowview and

had found Barney, a yellow envelope in his hand,
waiting impatiently at the gate.

“What is it, Barney?” she asked, drawing to a
halt.

“A telegram for the Squire, Miss Betty,” he re

plied, holding out the message, “and it's marked
“Rush.

I can’t find the Squire anywhere and

didn’t know what the nation to do about it.”

“When did it come?” she asked, taking the en
velope and tearing it open.
“’Bout a quarter of an hour ago.”

She read the message and her face paled and an
exclamation escaped her.

“Anythin serious?” asked Barney, startled.
“It is from the telegraph operator at Amity

27o

ville,” Betty answered, in a hurried tone. “Listen,
Barney.” She read aloud as follows:
“‘The Jamestown hoodlums are terrorizing the
town. Send Invincibles, without delay. Have
wired the sheriff.’”

“Je-ru-sa-lem !” muttered Barney. “I thought
there'd be trouble with that gang.”

“Hold my horse a moment.” Betty was out of
the saddle and on the ground in a twinkling.
Hurrying into the house she presently reappeared

the ground she regained the
“Hand them to me, Barney,”
“Take that message to Col.

Dingle, at once; if you can’t find him, give it to
Maj. Harp or Capt. Blue.

But don’t be long in

finding somebody.”
Barney, his eyes wide with astonishment and
wonder, had handed her the gun and the belt.
Running her arm through the belt and holding the
gun across the horse in front of her she turned

with her last word and dashed away at a gallop.
“Judas priest !” exclaimed Barney; “she's goin'
over there alone, an’ she'll be killed ! What does
she mean, anyhow?”

Betty, however, had no intention of facing those
Jamestown hoodlums. It was her purpose to

overtake Guy, if she could, and warn him. If she
could not overtake him before he reached Amity

ville, she might at least be able to give him
something with which to defend himself.

CHAPTER XXIV
“REAPING THE WHIRLWIND”

The twenty Jamestown men spent Tuesday
night at a deserted “shack” in the hills two miles

west of Harmony, and on Wednesday morning,
hungry and sullen, marched down on the half
score of wretched houses comprising the town of
Amityville.

There were but fifteen men of legal age living in
the settlement and thirteen of these had left on a

two-day “bone hunting” expedition in the rough
country to the north. The struggle for existence
was a hard one in Amityville, and Abe Landy and
his neighbors were compelled to make shift in
every way to provide food for their wives and
children. When the day's work failed, scouring
the country for bleached buffalo bones was re
sorted to. The lordly bison once roamed the

country in countless numbers, and their ruthless
slaughter by red men and white was mutely re

vealed by the litter of bones to be found every
where. These relics were gathered into large heaps
near the town and shipped east in car-load lots to
be used in some part of the process of refining
sugar. They brought eight dollars the ton.
271

272

His Friend the Enemy

Of the two men left behind by the bone-hunters
one kept the single small store which the town
boasted and the other was the station agent and
telegraph operator.
At first the Jamestown men were not disposed
to cause trouble. Their imaginations were at

work, but as yet had furnished them with no well
defined grievance. They were expecting Col.
Keever to come to Amityville and carry out his

promises. Knowing him as they did, however,
they were filled with doubts and misgivings.
Two dollars a day was an unheard-of price for
the amount of work these men had been called

upon to do, but perhaps it was cheap enough
when the Colonel's main object is considered.
Nevertheless the bargain had been made and the
labor, such as it was, completed. The men were

expecting the sum of one hundred and twenty
dollars each and if it was not forthcoming their
evil passions would assuredly obtain the upper
hand.

Among them they had a little money and this
they used to buy crackers and cheese and a few
“drinks” from a barrel which the storekeeper ex
ploited on thirsty occasions. After that they
lounged in the shade, scowling at the women and
children who stole forth to take frightened looks
at them.

From house to house a still alarm had

spread and there was much disquiet in Amityville

as the morning wore away without witnessing the
departure of the unwelcome guests.

“Reaping the Whirlwind”

273

At noon more money was produced and there

was a further purchase of food and a continued
and more liberal patronage of the storekeeper's
barrel. The Colonel had not presented himself,
and the Jamestown men delegated two of their
number to visit Harmony and obtain news of his
whereabouts.

It was a long walk and the messengers did not

return until dusk. The tale they brought with
them stirred the tempers of their comrades to an
inordinate degree. Col. Keever had been in Har
mony, had collected over nineteen hundred dollars
and

had soon afterwards taken an east-bound

train. There was no longer any room for doubt
he had cheated them out of their wages !
The hoarse shouts and lurid oaths that went up
from the Jamestown men could be heard all over
the small settlement. The doors of every house
were locked and

behind them crouched women

with pallid faces and wildly beating hearts, gather

ing their little ones about them with trembling arms.
One question the Jamestown men were debat

ing: In view of the failure of Keever to pay them
their just dues to whom should they now look?
To young Herbert or to Vlandingham? It was a
fine point and opinion was equally divided.
Keever had hired them, but he had ostensibly

acted for Herbert. On the other hand, Vlanding
ham

had secured the benefit

of their ballots.

Herbert was legally, but Vlandingham was mor

ally, constrained to pay.
I8

274

His Friend the Enemy

The discussion waxed warm and more liquor
was needed to oil the grooves of contention. The
store-keeper was routed out of his bed and made
to draw glass after glass from the barrel. No
money changed hands and thus the first unlawful
step was taken. The night passed with the riot
ous crew in possession of the store, besotted with
drink and sleeping on counters, in corners, and

wherever sufficient space could be found to lay
themselves.

Morning dawned and the sun rose high before
these unwelcome strangers began to rouse them
selves. They were morose, sulky, revengeful; but
their carousal of the night had numbed their
brains and brought with it an aversion for physi
cal effort. Crawling from the store to the outside
shade they lay with limbs out-sprawled and with
minds dormant, but ready as tinder to catch the
flame of lawlessness and riot.

It needed but the

right man to awaken them and this man, in due
course, lifted himself erect and gave the brief
harangue that effected his purpose.
In a body they rushed into the store and de
manded more liquor. The store-keeper refused the
demand and was struck over the head and hurled

helpless into one corner, the men taking what
they wanted. Firearms and ammunition formed

part of the store-keeper's stock in trade and the
weapons were laid hold of and loaded and fired in
a spirit of pure abandon and devil-may-care.
The sound of the first shot drove women and

“Reaping the Whirlwind”

275

children from their homes in a panic. Huddling
together as if for protection, and screaming and
wailing at every step, they ran to one of the bone
piles and cowered behind it. That first shot also

alarmed the man in the depot building. He came
to the door with a white, scared face and looked
in the direction of the ragged file of shanties.
The din of the disorder struck on his ears in in

creasing volume, he saw the fleeing women and
children and turned, rushed to the telegraph key
and sent his urgent call to the sheriff and to
Squire Vlandingham.
It was something more than half an hour after

this that Guy Herbert came spurring towards
Amityville. The shuttle of his fancy was weaving
an intricate design in cloth of gold; his senses
were all turned inward and he had eyes and ears

for nothing that took place ahead of him. Only
when a supplicating cry went up at his side, a
white object leaped into the road, and his horse
shied and nearly unseated him did he come to
himself. Taking a stronger grip on the reins he
regained control of his horse and looked in amaze
ment at the white-faced, frantic, unkempt women
and children by whom he was surrounded.
“Oh, sir, in Heaven's name help us, help us !”

came the distracted cry, while eager hands were
thrust out and caught convulsively at the bits,
the stirrups, his hands and even his clothing.
And there was one wail, soul-racking in its intense

anguish, that shrilled high above all the other

276

His Friend the Enemy

cries: “Oh, my little Luther, mammy's boy!
He'll be killed, I jest know he'll be killed !”
The babble of tearful voices was lost at that
moment in a ribald roar that broke from the

town. Guy swerved a startled glance in that
direction and saw a man reel out of the store, a

revolver in each hand. For a moment he stag
gered, then both weapons bellowed recklessly to

right and left and he fell down the store steps and
lay in a shapeless heap on the ground.
“What is the meaning of all this?” asked Guy.
“What has happened?” A dozen distraught
voices sought to answer his question. “One at a
time, please,” he said, laying a gentle hand on the
arm of the woman who seemed to have the great
est burden of grief. “You tell me what is the
matter.”

“The Jimtown men?” she cried brokenly. “Our
men folks are off bone-huntin'—won’t be back till

to-night-only Pete Lacy, who keeps the store,
and Jim Hicks, the station man, was left-and
oh, I do think they've killed Pete Lacy—and
Luther, little Luther, mammy's boy!”
She covered her face with her apron and broke

into a fit of hysterical weeping, two tow-headed
children hanging to her skirts and crying a lusty
accompaniment.

“It's her young’un, sir,” put in a gaunt, sandy
haired woman who had a babe at the breast.

“Her sister lives with her and when they run
from the house she thought her sister had Luther,

“Reaping the Whirlwind”

277

but she hadn’t, so the boy's back there and no
tellin' what'll 'come of him.

Oh, these fiends,

these ruffians ! I’m fearin’ they'll set fire to the
town an' burn what they don’t destroy in other
ways.”
“They're from Concord,” said another woman,
turning fiercely to shake her fist towards the east,

“the riffraff an offscourin's that was brought in
to vote for the county-seat. They bring 'em in
an' we're the ones to suffer. Where's the justice o'
that?”

The white leaped into the young man's face.
Aye, his heart echoed, where was the justice of it
when these poor souls were made to bear the
effects of Keever's evil deeds?

And in this dire

reckoning he himself was a factor and must shoul
der his share of the responsibility. He turned to
the woman who had her face in her apron, touch

ing her head slightly to signify that his words
were addressed to her.

“Which is your house?” he asked.
“The first one this side of the store buildin’,”
she answered, looking up at him with her faded
blue eyes swimming in tears. “I’m Abe Landy's

wife,” she added. “Oh, if Abe was only here, if he
was only here !”
“Go back behind that bone pile and wait,” said

Guy, in a tone of calm authority. “I’ll see what
I can do.” Leaning forward he softly loosed the
hands that clung to the bridle.

made sharp use of the whip and rode into
at a gallop. Only the one man who had
from the steps was visible, but from the
came sounds of turmoil and depredation,

the small structure rocking under the pent-up
violence.

Landy's house was perhaps a dozen yards from
the store. Halting in front, Guy threw himself to
the ground, dropped the bridle reins over a post
and rushed into the dwelling. It was divided into
two parts, living room and kitchen, and the dis
order everywhere apparent spoke mutely of the
hurried flight of the inmates.
The boy who was occasioning his mother so

much worry was not to be seen. After a hasty
look through the kitchen Guy returned to the
other room and called the youngster's name. A
muffled sob from under the bed furnished a clue

and Guy dropped flat on the floor and had soon
drawn young Luther into sight by one of his bare
little legs. The child was more frightened than

hurt and, when picked up, squirmed furiously and
cried for his mother at the top of his voice.

Guy had no time to use pacifying measures. He
must first restore Luther to his mother's arms

and then do his utmost to stop the nefarious work

of the Jamestown men. Bounding through the
door he made for his horse. To his dismay he
discovered that two of the tipsy rioters had
taken possession of the animal, one holding its

“Reaping the Whirlwind”

279

head while the other endeavored clumsily to
mount.

The cries of young Luther drew the attention of

the two men and likewise brought a floundering
quartet to the front of the store.
“By thunder, boys,” roared one of the four,
Bracing himself in the doorway, “here's young
Herbert | D'ye hear? Young Herbert !
the time to get our money !”

Now's

“Herbert | Herbert !” followed an explosive
chorus of thick voices. “Make him pay us!
Shoot him if he don’t pay us!”
A rush of jostling, stumbling and swearing men
accompanied the words. Guy thoroughly under

stood the peril of his position and decided quickly
as to what he should do. His actions were greatly
hampered by young Luther, but to abandon the
boy was an expedient he would not even consider.
Had Guy been fully recovered from his wound and

in possession of his normal strength he would
have thought but lightly of his contemplated
move. As it was, he had fears of the outcome.
Still, he could only do his best and trust the rest
to fortune.

Switching young Luther to his left arm, Guy
raced for the horse. The bit was still held by the
man at the animal's head, the other confronting
Guy with his back to the saddle stirrup.

“Out of my way!” commanded the young man,
his eyes flashing dangerously.
The man's reply was an oath.

A revolver

28o

His Friend the Enemy

gleamed in his hand and was raised unsteadily.
With a quick movement Guy caught the weapon
by the muzzle and snatched it away. The ruffian
struck out with his clenched fist, Guy evaded the
blow and brought the butt of the revolver down
on his antagonist's head. The man fell sideways,
cursing and groaning.
Dropping the weapon so that he could use his
-

hand, Guy gripped the saddle-horn, shoved his left
foot into the stirrup and was quickly astride the
horse.

“Let go !” he shouted hoarsely to the man at
the horse's head.

The command was not obeyed.

From a leather

loop about Guy's wrist hung the whip. Catching
the stock of it he threw himself along the horse's
neck and cut the man across the face with the

lash. A howl of pain followed the blow and the
man released the bit-rings. By then the others
were fast closing around, but Guy lashed the

horse and the animal sprang through the cordon
of men and away.
Bullets followed. They flew wild for the most

part although one tore its way through the brim
of his hat. With young Luther in front, his own

body protecting him, Guy raced past the last
house.

“Nobly done!” cried a voice, a voice that
thrilled him in every fibre.
He threw an astonished glance ahead and mid

way of the distance that separated him from the

white heap where the women and children had
taken refuge saw Miss Betty, her foam-flecked

horse at a standstill. There was fire in the girl's
eyes and her face was ruddy with excitement.
“Betty l’’ he gasped. “You here?”
“I tried to overtake you and warn you not to
come here,” she answered, “but it seems I arrived
too late. A telegram reached Concord from Ami
tyville asking for help. Barney is getting the
Invincibles—”

“Then help will come?”

“Before long.”
He cast a hurried look over his shoulder.

The

enraged Jamestown men were following, brandish

ing their weapons and clenched fists and giving
vent to cries of baffled rage.

“They want me,” he said, facing about hastily,
“and perhaps—”
“You are mounted,” she broke in, “and can

distance them easily. Ride for Harmony l’”
“And abandon those women and children?” he

returned.

“I can’t do that, Betty. As I say,

those fellows are after me and perhaps I can hold
their attention until the Invincibles get here.
Take this boy to his mother; I must ride in an
Other direction.”

She was proud, proud of his bravery and proud
that he remembered the women and children when

she had for the moment forgotten them. Some

thing of this pride must have shone in her eyes for
a gleam of happiness crossed the young man's face.

282

His Friend the Enemy

“I’ll care for the boy,” she said, in a hurried
tone. “You take these, and mind ! protect your
self at any cost.”
There was no time for further words. Betty
took charge of young Luther, and Guy, the cart
ridge-belt over the saddle-horn and the gun in one

hand, whirled and galloped for a second heap of
buffalo bones on the south side of the town. Just
as he had anticipated, the angry men followed him
and deep in his heart he thanked God that this
WalS SO.

Before the attacking force had come within a
hundred feet of him, Guy had dismounted, buckled
the bridle-reins about a buffalo skull, made the
cartridge-belt fast about his waist and was peer

ing over his makeshift breastworks, the shotgun
at his shoulder.

“Back!” he cried sternly. “I’ll shoot the first
man that advances another step.”
The leader of the Jamestown men was Jordan,

a tall, evil-faced ruffian whom Guy knew by sight.
He was the least intoxicated and, at the same
time, the most determined of all the trouble

makers. Over his shoulder he carried a repeating
rifle and his fingers seemed itching to make mur
derous use of it. At Guy's command to halt,
Jordan threw up one hand and, ordered his com
panions to obey.
“This is a ground-hog case for you, Herbert,”

said he, with a wicked leer. “We're twenty
against you and the only way you can save your

“Reaping the Whirlwind”

283

life is by shellin' out the twenty-four hundred
dollars that's due us. Eh, boys?”
Jordan appealed to his companions, who an
swered with a clamorous affirmative.

“I haven’t even twenty-four hundred cents
about me,” the young man returned.

“Then we'll make a prisoner of you and keep
you until your friends send the money.”
“Keever hired you,” Guy called back, “and you
followed his instructions and voted against Con
cord. Why should I pay you a cent?”
“You will, all the same. Will you come out

from behind that bone-pile and give yourself up?”
&4

NO.”

“Then we're goin' to surround you. I don’t
believe that old pepperbox of yours can cover the
whole twenty of us.”
“It will cover enough of you to make your
move a dangerous one,” was the cool response.
Jordan was thoughtful for a moment and then

the demands for action, vociferously led by the
two rascals who had already suffered at Guy's
hands, prompted him to begin operations.
“Circle 'round back of the bone-pile, you fellows
over there !” cried Jordan, waving his hand to
wards the right. “And you on the left,” he
added, facing towards that point, “do the same
thing. Spread out and keep your guns ready l”

The right and left wings of the small army be
gan a cautious and unsteady advance. Guy had
no intention of allowing himself to be surrounded

-

284

and attacked by flank and rear where the breast
works would prove of no protection. He watched
sharply and when the two men at the points of

the half circle were opposite him on left and right,
he stood up fearlessly and gave them a barrel on

each side. The charges did no more than plump
into the ground at the feet of the men farthest in
advance, but the effect of the two shots was start

ling. The crescent contracted as if by magic, the
men staggering and stumbling towards Jordan
and clustering about him. Their leader swore at

them, taunted them with cowardice and did every
thing in his power to urge them on, but they felt
safer in solid formation. A brisk fire was opened
on the bone-pile and splinters flew in all directions.

Guy remained in plain view while reloading the
shotgun and then calmly dropped from sight.
This skirmish took place within sight of the
women and children, who watched it breathlessly
and with blanching faces. Betty, sitting rigidly
erect in her saddle, curbed her plunging horse
mechanically and kept her eyes on Guy's stalwart
form until, having reloaded the gun, he sank be
hind the white heap. Then she turned a wild, im

ploring look behind her along the Harmony road.
“Why don’t they come, why don't they come,”
she murmured again and again in anguished tones.
Abruptly the firing ceased.
“Vlandingham's daughter is over there with the
rest of those women,” Guy heard Jordan say,
“and if we could capture her—”

“Reaping the Whirlwind”

285

The plan was tumultuously approved, mainly
because an attack on unarmed women and chil

dren was attended with no danger. Guy's heart
leaped into his throat.

Betty was well mounted

and could flee from danger. Something whispered
to the young man, however, that she would not
abandon the women and children but would cast
her lot with them. What would the drunken

wretches do? What might they not do?
Pettibone was right when he said that an un

scrupulous man with a grievance was an “engine
of destruction.” And such a man, inflamed with
liquor, had his power for evil increased a hundred
fold.

With maudlin shouts the gang turned and
started towards the northeast.

The women saw

them coming, and thinking the attack was upon
them all screamed and crushed helplessly together.
Betty rode to them and Guy heard her calm,
authoritative voice although he could not dis
tinguish her words. Whatever the words were
they had a reassuring effect and the women re
treated to the protection of the bone-heap while

Betty, entirely self-possessed and fearless, swerved
her horse about and rode forward to meet the
1men.

It was beautiful and intrepid; but the useless
ness of it wrenched a groan from Guy's lips. She

was deceived. She thought the cowardly pack
were charging upon the defenseless women and did
not dream that she alone was the object of their

286

His Friend the Enemy

attack. With no thought for his own safety, Guy
leaped over the white mound in front of him and
started after the hooting and howling mob.
“They're trying to capture you, Betty l’” he

shouted at the top of his voice. “Turn your
horse-ride like the wind-Oh, my God!”
While the warning was upon his lips the spirited
horse, frightened by the noise and the sight of the
on-rushing men, broke from its rider's control,
reared high and fell backward; another instant

and it was up and careering away with an empty
saddle.

Betty was somewhere among that horde of men,
hurt, perhaps dying ! For a second the blood con
gealed in Guy's veins and he stood like one dazed.
But only for a second. A savage strength leaped
suddenly into his limbs, every nerve stretched to

tightest tension and his brain seemed on fire.
With a furious cry he plunged into the crowd of
men and battled his way to Betty's side. She lay
on the turf like a trodden lily, her face as the face
of one dead.

-

“Stand back, you cowards, you fiends, you
murderers l’” shouted Guy in a delirium of rage.
Catching the shotgun by the barrel he whirled
it around and around, leaping at the closing circle
of ruffians like a madman.

He forced them back

by the very impetuosity of his assault and as he
stood before them, panting and aflame with pas

sion, a buzzing sound came from, the railroad
track and died away in a fall of distant hoofs.

Pettibone was coming on a velocipede car—Petti

the Harmony road was a cloud of dust. The
Invincibles !

clutched at his shoulder. Yes, they were coming,
but coming too late | Staggering to Betty's side

arms. It was for his sake that she had come

CHAPTER XXV
CONCLUSION

For Guy the events that followed swiftly upon
the coming of the sheriff and the Invincibles had

all the hazy unreality of a dream. His heart and
brain were benumbed as a consequence of the
shocking accident to Betty. The passing of his
angry outburst against the Jamestown men left
him nerveless and overwhelmed, and of what he
saw and heard he remembered little.

He had a glimpse of Pettibone shouldering
through the drunken crowd and tearing away

guns and revolvers; he saw Col. Dingle charge
upon the scene and deploy his mounted men in a
circle about the mob, and then some one dashed

up in a carriage and sprang to the ground with a
grief-stricken cry. It was the Squire. The next
moment he had caught Betty out of Guy's arms.
The young man arose mechanically. Dingle gal
loped to the spot, dismounted and hurried to the

Squire and Betty. He exchanged some words with
the Squire and presently turned on Guy, who stood
near with stony eyes. He spoke, but Guy did not
hear. Again he spoke, shaking Guy by the shoul
ders to arouse him from his lethargy.
I9

“Her horse was frightened by the Jamestown
men,” said Guy, in colorless tones; “it reared
back and must have fallen On her.”

Dingle whirled about at a sharp command from

the Squire; then the Squire got into the carriage,
Dingle lifted Betty to him, climbed in himself and
drove towards Harmony, lashing the horse into a
1"U111.

Guy felt a hand on his shoulder. Withdrawing
his eyes from the disappearing carriage he turned
and saw Waffle. Waffle was talking, and his hand
had fallen from Guy's shoulder to his breast.

“Her horse must have fallen on her,” said Guy,
passing one hand slowly across his forehead.
“She came here to warn me and she could have

ridden away in safety but she would not leave the
women and children.”

He fell heavily against Waffle, who threw an arm
about him to keep him upright. Pettibone ran to
them, spoke hurriedly with Waffle and at once

called some one behind him. Bill Comfort ap
peared, placed himself at Waffle's side and as
sisted in supporting Guy. Then they walked to
the railroad track and the young man was helped
to a seat in the velocipede car. There were three
seats, and two of them—the ones taken by Waffle
and Comfort—faced the machinery that furnished
the motive power. Applying themselves to the
foot and hand levers Waffle and Comfort sent the

car eastward at racehorse speed.

Guy felt as though they were winged and cleav

ing the air. The click click of the rails died away,
the broad back of Waffle, bending to its work,
vanished by degrees and the red face of Bill Com

fort, lifting and falling, receded farther and farther
into a cloudlike haze. . . . .

Guy was in the gorgeous trap with Miss Betty,
riding from Whittaker's to Willowview. The mel
low jingle of the harness chains mingled with the
silver notes of birds winging about them and
singing to them as they passed. His heart

throbbed with its awakening passion and his eyes
drank in the beauty of sky and earth. The yel
low flowers and the dull gold of Betty's hair, the

blue of the wild violets and the blue of her eyes,
the mantling blush of the prairie rose and the
delicate tint of her cheeks were as one to him

in that delicious hour of peace, and happiness,
and budding love. . . . .

Again, he was in Willowview and Betty's small
hands were flitting over the piano keys while he
stood at her side and watched her face and list

ened to her voice, his heart-strings swept by the
master passion and echoing melody for melody
and song for song.

His fancy was unfettered and leaped from one
bright hour to another, backward or forward,
hoarding its happiness as a miser hoards treasure,
counting the golden moments one by one.
In time his wayward thoughts rode into Amity
ville, plucked young Luther from the midst of the
Jamestown men and carried him from the town

292

His Friend the Enemy

and delivered him to Betty. Once more he fought
his battle at the bone-pile and again he witnessed
the dread spectacle that racked him body and
soul-Betty, sinking from sight, the front hoofs of
her horse beating the air as they shot upward
and whirled back. Then, as before, he fought the
horde single-handed and drifted back to earth in a
small room with Pettibone and Waffle holding him
down on a bed by main force.
It was night. A lamp burned on a table and

Guy, marveling at the quick change of scene,
straightened out and lay quietly.
“He'll be all right now,” said Pettibone. “Sit
down, Waff; or, if you want to go, I guess I can

manage him.”
Waffle took a chair.

“Who's

house

is

this,

Pettibone?”

Guy

asked.

“Mine, Herbert,” replied the sheriff. “Feel bet
ter?”

“What's the matter with me?”

“That wound in your shoulder opened and you
bled a considerable. Waff and Comfort brought

you here and I rode back on your horse after

out of your head and babblin’ all kinds of talk,
but you didn't get violent till a few minutes ago.

“That's the truth,” put in the Judge, “but

you'll do from this on, Herbert. A man with as

much fight in him as you’ve got won’t be long on
the sick list.”

“Is—is Betty—Miss Vlandingham—”
Guy turned a glance upon the sheriff, an icy
hand clutching his throat and choking him, his
eyes finishing the unspoken question.
“Rest easy about Miss Vlandingham,” was the
cheery response. “I stopped at the Squire's on
my way back and was told that a dislocated
shoulder and a sprained ankle was about all she
had to get over.”
“It might have been a whole lot worse,” said
the Judge, philosophically.
“God knows l’’ affirmed the sheriff.

Guy closed his eyes, reverently grateful to the

Mighty Hand that had averted the dire calamity
he feared in his soul.

Betty would live!

He

whispered it over and over to himself and the
knowledge thrilled and rejoiced him as nothing
else on earth could have done.

That little war

over the county-seat had been a play, an opera

bouffe performance that had well-nigh turned out
a tragedy. But the curtain was down on the final
act, the reckoning had been paid, and Betty
would live!

Two months passed, two months fraught with
many changes for the town of Concord.
First came the news that coal had been discov

2.94

ered, of good quality and apparently in unlimited
quantities. It was known to underlie the whole
townsite as well as the adjacent country for many
miles to the north, east and south. Westward,

however, the vein grew thinner and of poorer
quality and finally gave out altogether. The
Carboniferous Age had worked its miracles for
Concord but had turned its venerable back on

Harmony.
In a treeless country, where the rigors of winter

are as keen as in the Dakotas, this discovery of
coal meant much-meant everything in fact—and

Concord was brought prominently before the at
tention of the whole Territory.
Soon it became known that young Mr. Herbert

had interested a capitalist in the new fields, this
capitalist had interested other men of wealth and
they had formed a company, incorporated and
known as the Concord Coal & Land Company.
It developed later that this company had pur
chased from Mr. Herbert the Concord townsite,

giving him therefor the sum of twenty thousand
dollars, together with a paid-up interest entitling
him to one-fifth of all profits arising from the
company's operations in real estate and mines.
Coal lands were secured right and left, bought
for cash, leased or worked on a percentage as the

original holders of the lands might desire. A
“boom” was started; not a flurry of high prices
based on fictitious values and kept alive by greed
and excitement, but a prosperous advance along

Conclusion

295

the lines of sound business and pure commer
cialism.

Entire columns in the various Territorial papers

were given over to Concord and one Bismarck
daily referred to the town as the “New Mecca.”
These reports created a profound impression
everywhere and the people of Amityville, with all
their household goods in bone-wagons, traveled
eastward in one grand hegira and were among the
first newcomers to reach the New Mecca. They
had a surplusage of lots, and each family, after

reserving a lot for a house, sold the rest for
enough to build the house. The men were practi
cal coal miners and quickly identified themselves
with the operations of the Coal Company.

The erection of new stores along the main
street was begun and the townsite was checkered
with piles of yellow lumber. The demand for
buildings brought a demand for masons, car

penters, plasterers, laborers, and strangers poured
into the town by every train. Pedro Smith was
overwhelmed by the crush; another hotel was
built, and then another, and another. A news

paper rose from the ruins of The Blizzard under
the guidance of a snappy little man with a corn
cob pipe—a man who was frankly commercial,
severely plain and had an aversion for any word
that outranked three syllables. He succeeded so

well that another paper, of different political
stripe, intruded into the field and was able to live,
and circulate, and make money for its promoters.

296

His Friend the Enemy

Another druggist came to rival Pinney, a second

livery stable opened its broad doors directly
across the street from Leffingwell and the Empo
rium found itself in mad competition with no less
than four other establishments of the same kind.

When the finger of Capital touches the button of
Business every artery responds to the electric
thrill. The wave of energy that swept over Con

cord grew to tidal proportions and the town was
all but swamped in prosperity.
The reader will wonder and no doubt be pleased

to learn that Squire Vlandingham had a profitable
share in the good fortune that descended upon
Concord.

This came as an indirect result of the

evil doings of the Jamestown men and happened
in this wise:

The rioters, quelled by the sheriff with the aid of
the Invincibles, were loaded into a box car and

shipped to Concord. They were there tried before
Judge Waffle, who, in his usual refreshing manner,
fined them for all damages inflicted upon the
Amityville store and contents together with a tidy
sum for costs. Then it was that Squire Vlanding
ham stepped forward and paid the fines and costs,
deducting the sum total from the wages due and
dividing the balance among the twenty men,
share and share alike.

The rascals were there

upon returned by first train to their native place,
the Amityville storekeeper was remunerated for his
trying experience and the incident was closed.
Guy offered to give his note to the Squire for

Conclusion

297

the twenty-four hundred dollars, but the offer was
peremptorily refused. Guy then desired to present
the Squire with a block of Concord lots in lieu of
the note, and the Squire, not knowing that the

reign of King Coal was about to begin, and
thinking the lots practically worthless, pacified
the persistent young man by accepting a deed.

In the end, the Squire's holdings in a supposedly
“dead” town netted him more than the entire

Harmony townsite.
As for young Herbert, he awoke one fine morn

ing to find himself rich—and famous. Whenever
he walked the streets “old settlers” were proud to

grasp his hand and chat with him about things
present and to come; and whenever one of these
old settlers presented a stranger who had sought

the New Mecca in quest of an “opening,” the
accepted formula was: “Mr. Herbert, Mr. So-and
So.”

Then to Mr. So-and-So the old timer would

add, with swelling chest and brightening eye:
“Mr. Herbert, you know, found the coal that's

under us and is the father of our little city.”
For a few times this introduction could be borne

with, but it cloyed with constant repetition.
The hum of industry, busily at work on the raw
materials of a new town, was also more or less

distracting. And for these, as well as for other
good and valid reasons, Guy fell to making peri
odical pilgrimages to Harmony, where he was
always certain of a bright welcome at Willowview.
Miss Betty recovered from her accident but

298

His Friend the Enemy

slowly. A month passed before she was able to

leave the house, and then it was Guy's great
pleasure, one sunny afternoon, to take her for a
drive into the country.
“I’ve heard so much about Concord during the
last few weeks,” remarked Miss Betty as they

drove along, “that I shall be glad when I am
able to go there and see for myself just what is
being done.”

“If you were now to pass through the town on
the six-thirty freight, Miss Vlandingham,” smiled
Guy, “I assure you that you would be able to

count more than three people from the way-car.”
“I suppose so,” she answered, laughing softly;
“poor Harmony has been quite eclipsed. You
have done wonderful things for Concord since you
came to the town, Mr. Herbert.”
“Now,” returned Guy gruesomely, “please don’t
add that I discovered the coal that's under us

and am the father of our little city.

I run when

ever I hear that.”

“I’ve been told how strangers are invariably
presented to you,” she said, with a ripple of merri
ment; then, suddenly sobering, she added: “You
are popular with every one and I am glad, very
glad.”
“That set formula is hardly a test of popu

larity,” Guy answered. “The very men who now
overpower me with their attentions are the ones
who put me under lock and key ‘for the good of
the town, shrieked ‘traitor at me and at one

time suggested a telegraph pole and several feet of
stout rope.”

“The source of popularity is success,” said Miss
Betty,

“and you have been marvelously suc

cessful.”

“An accident entirely,” averred Guy.

“No !” she cried, and her eyes flashed as they
turned upon him; “you shall not wrong yourself

by calling your success an accident.”
“I don’t want to be loaded with more honor

than I deserve, Miss Vlandingham,” said he, “and
I don’t want to take a false position in any one's
eyes, yours least of all. Some one would have
discovered coal in Concord, sooner or later, and
was it not an accident that the destruction of The

Blizzard building revealed it to me?”

“If an accident, why did not Pettibone discover
the coal?” she asked.

“His eyes were not so sharp as mine, I suppose.”
“No, nor his mind so acute. Only one man
could do for Concord what has been done and

that man is Guy Herbert.”
It pleased him to hear her say that and in just
the tone of voice she used.

“You are a great man in Concord,” she pur
sued, “but that does not satisfy me. I want you
to be a great man in North Dakota.”
“North Dakota ?” he echoed.

“Yes. The Territory is to be divided and will
be admitted as two states. My father, as you may
know, is high in the councils of his party and he

3oo

His Friend the Enemy

knows all that is being done. When North Dakota
is admitted as a state she will be entitled to repre
sentation in both branches of Congress. That
will be a chance for the popular Mr. Herbert, of
Concord—”

“Betty l’’ exclaimed Guy.
“It is in you to do great things,” she con

tinued, with supreme conviction, “and you must
do them.

It is your duty.”

Her face was earnest but he felt that she was

laughing at him with her eyes.

“You are looking too far ahead,” he said, jest
ingly. “The Gentleman from North Dakota will
no doubt appear in the legislative halls of our

country, at some future day, but I doubt very
much whether he will be Herbert, of Concord.”
“The young State will need men,” she answered

with great seriousness; “not politicians but up
right and resourceful men. Your star is in the

ascendant, Mr. Herbert.” Suddenly she started,
looked about her and laid one gloved hand on his
arm. “Can you tell me, sir, where you are driv
ing?” she asked.

There were no houses visible anywhere on the
broad plain. A little distance ahead, and to the
right of the road, there was a mound-like ruin
which looked as though it might once have been a
dwelling.
“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said he. “What

is that in front of us, Miss Betty? Can you tell
me?” He pointed with the whip as he spoke.

“Yes,” she returned, her voice low, her gaze on
the ruin and a suggestion of sadness and mel

That

Hark!” She

raised one hand and bowed her head, her lips
parted, her eyes dreamy, her whole manner rapt
and breathless. “Do you not hear it?” she whis
pered.

“What?” he asked wonderingly, drawing the
horse to a halt.

“A burst of music falling from up there !” She
flashed a glance at the sky above them. “I
never pass here that I do not hear it—“Lone
some Will's violin playing the ‘Rose of Allan
dale.’”
He recalled Pettibone's mention of “Lonesome”
Will and his voice was soft as he answered : “I

cannot hear the music, Betty. Perhaps I might if
I knew the story.

Please tell me.”

Her face was divinely sweet and her voice in
effably gentle as she told him of “Lonesome” Will.
“Those ruined walls, Mr. Herbert, once sheltered

a sad and solitary man. He had no companions;
he shunned the society of his fellowmen, and lived

out a life that was beautiful in its very sadness.
I say he had no companions and yet he did have
one-a companion that communed with and com

forted his grieving heart—a violin. And the air
that old instrument knew best was the ‘Rose of

“Once, “Lonesome Will had loved a fair-haired,
faithful girl whose name was Rose. A love, strong
as fetters of iron yet soft as a gossamer web, had
sprung up between them. In life they lived for
each other and when, by God's inscrutable decree,
the earthly Rose was taken to blossom in Heaven,
the lover continued to live for his dead.

“How long and dreary must have been the

There fell a silence. Something there was about

of it, or the time and place, that affected the

young man powerfully.
He urged the horse forward. At the very wall

of the ruin he stopped again, got out of the
carriage and assisted Betty to alight. She did not

question the meaning of his act. No words passed
between them. Eye may have spoken to eye and
heart to heart, but the lips were mute. Together,

hand in hand, they entered the old doorway and
stood within the roofless walls.

As under a spell, they listened for the music,
listened with that soulful ear which attunes itself
to the Infinite. While they stood, their glances
roved about them, and in the selfsame moment
they saw something which caused them to start
and gaze at each other with eyes filled with a

divine mystery.
A rose bush grew out of the old wall and there,

before them, blossomed a full-blown rose ! They
passed over to it and Betty went down on her
knees and brushed her lips against the petals.
Guy knelt beside her.
“Betty,” he whispered, “is it not type and
emblem of that supernal blossom which “Lone

“Few men love as “Lonesome Will loved,” she
murmured.

“I love you,” she murmured, her face against
