War—a young sea adventurer, whose daring deeds have long been 
told in song and story ! whose name thrilled the whole world, and 
created a reign of terror alongthe coasts of Great Britain when he 
battled with and conquered some of the best war ships of the British 
navy, while his own was but little better than a “tub”—a man who 
knew not the meaning of the word “fear,” and who was as gallant 
as he was brave.

Old BUI Caff, boatswain and a man of valor. 

Charles fieriness, an Bnglish officer who did not forget a kindness. 

Scfplo and Cato, two craven hearted negroes from a Virginia 
plantation. 

La Belle Francesca, a dancer in a French seaport. 

Qrimstone, who commanded a British sloop-of-war, and had reason 
to remember Padl Jones the rest of his life. 


‘ CHAPTER I. 

PEA SOUP AND TROUBLE. 

“Sail ho!” 

The cry of the lookout on the forecastle of the Venge¬ 
ance, which, as our readers will remember, was the flag¬ 
ship of dashing Paul Jones, the founder and hero of the 
American Navy, galvanized into activity the crew, who, 
as it was Sunday afternoon, were lounging in various lazy 
attitudes about the deck of the speedy war ship. 

Hardly had the first cry rung out than it was echoed 
from the main topmast 

“Where away ?” bawled Lieut. Dale, tEe first “luff” of 
Jones’ vessel. 

“Right off the starboard!” was the response from the 
maintop. 

“Right off the port bow,” was echoed from the fore¬ 
castle. 










PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


At the first cry Jones had issued from his cabin beneath 
the poop deck; he had been up all the previous night, for 
the Vengeance and the squadron acting as her consorts 
had run into a stiff blow, and it had needed all the sea¬ 
manship of Jones and his mates to bring her through all 
taut. 

The commander of the Vengeance ran forward, button¬ 
ing his well-worn uniform coat as he went, and, telescope 
in hand, took up his position on the forecastle head. 

He was followed by his first lieutenant and the young 
fellow to whom the reader has been previously intro¬ 
duced as Jimmy Blake, the powder monkey, but whose 
rank was raised by special act of Congress and who was 
now known as Ensign James Blake. 

The crew, too, had clustered about their commander as 
he swept the sea with his glass. 

“What do you make of them, sir ?” 

The question came from Jimmy, whose face was flushed 
with eagerness at the thought that here at last was the 
vanguard of the British fleet that Jones had pledged his 
word to Congress to keep from a swoop on the shores of 
America. 

The lad’s heart beat high at the feeling that at last he 
was to have a chance to go into action, and prove to the 
nation that he was a not unworthy son of the first Ameri¬ 
can Navy. 

Jonqp laid aside the telescope and then turned to the lad 
with a kindly look in his keen gray eyes. 

“They are ships of war,” he replied, “that much is cer¬ 
tain ; but of what nation I have no means of ascertaining 
till we are near enough to,make them- show their colors.” 

“But they can be none other than the vanguard of the 
British fleet ?” 

“Let us hope so, for I do not want the Britishers to slip 
past us in the night or otherwise evade us.” 

The Vengeance was tearing through the water at a rate 
that gave her two consorts, the sloop-of-war Pallas and the 
hrig Concord, all they could do to keep/within sight of her. 

The stiff breeze that was blowing had laid her over till 
her channels were awash. 

Dale cast an anxious glance aloft at the straining top 
hamper of the flagship. Her great sails were bellied out 
rill it seemed as if they must carry away, and the taut rig¬ 
ging whistled like piano wire. 

“Had I not better order down the main topgallant?” he 
asked, looking at Jones, whose gaze was bent intenth* 
ahead at the two ships that were, as yet. only dim purple 
shadows on the horizon. 


“No,” said the young commander, without removing 
the glass from his eye, “keep on all standing as we are. 

I mean to get up with yon craft before nightfall if we 
fetch our sticks out.” 

Dale nodded, but ordered new tackle bent onto the 
weather rigging, and the sheets flattened a little so as to 
take the strain from the bending spars. 

The excitement was intense. 

Not a man on board the ship but was eager for a brush 
with the British vessels if, indeed, they were British. 

“We will teach the beggars a lesson,” quoth old Bill 
Cuff, the boatswain, to a group of his mates who had 
gathered about him to glean from his figs the veteran’s 
opinion of the chance there was of a scrimmage when they 
overhauled the two big vessels ahead. 

The latter seemed to be under no particular apprehen¬ 
sion, though they must have long since sighted the little 
Yankee squadron. 

As Jones had said, they were two of the leviathan 
“three-deckers” of the English Navy. 

As they “stood about” in the Bright sunlight the flash¬ 
ing Atlantic waves heeled them over till they showed their 
copper. ' 

Both of them sported three rows of black-and-white 
ports a side. 

It seemed madness on the part of the young American 
commander to pit his tiny fleet against two such formi¬ 
dable fighting machines, but as the British had learned to 
their cost, it took more than heavy odds against him to 
deter the young “sea eagle,” as people had already begun 
to call him, from facing his country’s foe. 

“Hurrah!” exclaimed the young ensign, “we are in for 
a fight, sure.” 

“Do you hear that, mates?” cried old Bill Cuff, as he 
heard the words of his young commander, “we are in for 
a fight. Away, you starboard battery men, and get your 
barkers ready to give Johnny Bull a warm reception.” 

At this juncture a strange interruption occurred in the 
shape of an exceedingly fat and exceedingly black negro, 
who was projected from the door of the galley, with a 
force that suggested that his movement was not entirely 
voluntary. 

The ship was heeling over to the ever stiffening breeze 
till her lee scuppers were all awash. 

The unfortunate cook, for such was the office of the- 
darky who had just emerged from the little galley, held 
in his hands a large “kid” of steaming pea soup which 
was destined for the men’s dinners. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


o 


He had intended to carry it forward, but as he crossed 
the threshold of his domain the ship gave a lurch and the 
negro gave a yell as he felt himself and his savory burden 
being gradually impelled toward the boiling puddle of the 
scuppers. 

“Scipio seems to be in trouble,” said Dale, as his eye lit 
on the struggling darky. 

The words had hardly left his lips before a second 
chocolate-colored face was poked out of the galley door 
and a second portly Senegambian went staggering to the 
aid of his unfortunate fellow cook. 

Old Bill Cuff saw their predicament. 

“Sink me, if them fellers ain’t goin’ to let the crew’s 
dinner go to feed the fish!” he angrily exclaimed, as the 
two darkies, wildly gesticulating, were forced nearer and 
ever nearer to the seething scuppers. 

The old bosun was a man of action, and he did not 
waste any time on mere words, but plunged gallantly to 
the rescue of the two struggling cooks. 

“Golly! Massa Cuff,” shrieked the second of the two 
sons of Ham, “but dis am a terrible t’ing, dis yar sea, sure 
’nuff.” 

“Belay 1” shouted old Cuff, as he clawed his way along 
the steeply sloping deck. “Ef yer spill that thar soup, ye 
black idjuts. I’ll brain yer with this fist!” 

With these words he shook that’formidable member at 
the already terrified negroes. 

Unfortunately for his dignified demeanor, however, the 
ship at the same moment gave an unusually violent lurch 
and the old boatswain was sent spinning straight against 
the men to whom he had been handing out his admonition. 

The two holders of the soup “kid” gave vent to a howl 
of dismay as they saw the burly form of the old sailor 
hurtling toward them with the speed and force of a pro¬ 
jectile. 

Cuff himself saw, long before it actually happened, that 
a collision was inevitable, unless one or the other of the 
negroes sheered off. 

“Hard over, ye lubbers!” he yelled, with his storm 
voice, as he was pleased to call the stentorian tones with 
which he was.in the habit of calling the watch on a rough 
night. 

The wretched negroes obeyed his instructions literally. 
Their obedience, however, was involuntary, for the mas¬ 
sive body of the old man reeled, with all the force that a 
fresh lurch of the plunging ship imparted to it, full against 
them. 


Men and soup went sliding into the boiling mass of 
water in the lee scuppers. 

Cuff was on his feet in a moment and stood, painstak¬ 
ingly, wiping the soup out of his grizzled whiskers with 
one hand, while he wrathfully shook the other at the two 
half-drowned darkies. 

“Bad luck to you, you leather-skinned sons of Ham 1” 
he roared. “Sure it’s myself that wishes the Ark had 
struck a rock-and gone to Davy Jones’ locker before 
Noah’s son ever got to Africa to raise such a gang of fel¬ 
lows as you are.” 

“But, Mister Tuff-” 

Poor Scipio got no further. 

“Cuff is my name, sir,” roared the infuriated boatswain. 

“Yas, sah, Massa Bluff-” 

Cuff’s face grew purple. 

“Are you making fun o’ me on purpose ?” he demanded. 

“No, indeed, sah, Massa Ruff-” 

“And it’s rough you’ll find me, my laddy-buck. Lay 
aft! lay aft, and get some more peas from the steward’s 
boy or it’s a coffin we’ll be makin’ for you before night.” 

Jones and his young officer were watching the scene 
from the forecastle head, and the young commander, when 
he had recovered from his first amusement, took pity on 
the misfortunes of the two negroes who had been taken 
to sea by him from the plantaion he owned in Virginia, in 
order to satisfy the craving they had expressed to see 
“de mighty oshun.” 

Many a time since tjie Vengeance and her two consorts 
had sailed they had regretted their rash step, and now 
were looking forward in terror to the day when they 
would smell powder for the first time. 

As they hastened back to the galley to carry out the 
furious Cuff’s order’ Jones hailed the boatswain. 

“They are punished enough, Mr. Cuff,” he said, as seri¬ 
ously as he could. “Besides, I have work on hand for you 
elsewhere than in the galley.” 


CHAPTER II. . 

THE SEA FIGHT. 

The Vengeance was by this time separated from the 
two Britistuwar vessels by a little over half a mile. 

This space she was rapidly covering. 

Half an hour more would lay her alongside the two 
great craft. 

Jones’ face was lighted up with the eager look peculiar 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


to it when the young commander was about to go into 
action. 

With flashing eye he felt the hilt of the magnificent 
sword presented to him by Louis of France. 

'‘You mean to attack them.” asked Dale, “or shall we 
try and show them a clean pair of heels ?” 

Jones turned on him almost angrily. 

“We are pledged to drive the red cross of St George 
from the Western seas,” he exclaimed, “and shall we turn 
tail at the first sight of the enemy ?” 

“But,” objected Dale, “we shall in all probability be 
blown out of the water at the first broadside from these 
fellows.” 

“I intend to fire the first broadside,” was the calm reply. 

“But they are undoubtedly not alone; the rest of the 
fleet is somewhere about and it would be madness to en¬ 
gage the entire force of the British.” 

“Our duty lies plainly before us. Dale. Will you order 
the signal man to inform the Pallas and the Concord that 
we will engage the enemy; and you, Blake, lay aft and 
have the port battery cleared for action.” 

The two officers hastened to obey. 

It was none too soon to put the ship in fighting trim, for 
the next moment a puff of smoke from the side of the 
hindmost of the English ships and the scream of the ball 
as it passed over their heads, warned them of the hostile 
nature of the two strangers, even if they had not been in¬ 
formed of their nationality by the display of the British 
naval flag. 

“Shall we give it to them back, si??” asked Jimmy, who 
had got his battery in fighting shape and was eager for a 
chance to show what his carefully trained gunners 
could do. 

“Not yet,” replied Jones; “we would simply be wasting 
powder and shot, and we cannot afford to do that.” 

“You intend to reserve your fire, then?” asked Dale. 

“For‘the present, yes. We will wear round to.the wind¬ 
ward of them and then show our teeth; that will give us 
a distinct advantage.” 

The other nodded and seemed about to say something, 
but he was interrupted by a wail of anguish from the two 
negroes. 

“Massa Jones!” cried Scipio, “am it a fac’, sah, dat you 
intends to fight with them two big ships ?” 

Jones nodded. 

“Then fo’ de Lord's sake, massa, I have ter giv’ you 
notice an’ mus' respectfully request tq be put on dry lan’ 
once more,” 


“I am afraid that is impossible, Scipio.” 

“Den we have to stay aboard an’ hear dem awfly bullets 
go whizzin’ over our heads? No, massa, we mus’ mos’ 
respectfully decline de honor.” 

“An’ I secon’ de motion,” declared Cato. 

“What 1” exclaimed Jones, half amused and half angry. 
“I thought you two fellows wanted to see what life on a 
ship was like, and here, at your first chance of smelling 
powder, you want to get out of sight.” 

“As far as is possible out of sight, yes, sah, Massa 
Jones; dat am a solid fac’.” 

“Then down with you into the forecastle! This ship is 
no place for two such cowards as you are.” 

“Dat may be true, sah, but I was taught by my ole 
mammy, in good ole Virginia, dat it is a great deal better 
fo’ folks to say ‘dar he goes’ dan ‘dar he lays.’ ” 

Despite his disgust, Jones could not refrain from laugh¬ 
ing as the two woolly-headed cowards disappeared down 
the forecastle hatch. 

There was no time, however, to exchange words on any 
other topic than the business in hand. 

The Vengeance was now close enough to the rear frig¬ 
ate to read her name, Benbozv, which was displayed in 
gorgeous scrollwork on her rounded stern. 

This was the vessel commanded by Capt. Hawksdale, 
who had sworn to rid the sea of Jones or sink his own 
vessel in the attempt. 

Jones was well aware of this^boast, for, during his visit 
in France he had been informed of the bitter enmity the 
British captain cherished toward him. 

As he recognized his enemy's vessel the battle light 
came into his face. 

The lines about his mouth set and hardened and a steely 
glint came into his eyes. 

It was the face of a fighting man. 

“Show them ‘the Rattlesnake,’ ” he ordered, curtly, and 
a moment later the famous standard of the coiled rattle¬ 
snake was floating from the peak of the gallant Yankee 
vessel. 

The Pallas and her companion followed suit and a full- 
throated American cheer was borne over the waves as the 
emblem of liberty was displayed. 

The British vessel replied with a volley of musket balls 
that did no more harm than to plow up the deck. 

They had the effect, however, of arousing the American 
crew to a state of fury. 

“The scoundrels,” roared old Bill Cuff, squinting along 
the polished barrel of the wicked-looking bow chaser. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


The old man was an expert gunner, and Jones had in¬ 
trusted to him the task of winging the great three-decked 
frigate so that she would be at the mere}' of the Yankee’s 
broadside. 

At last Jones gave the long-expected signal. 

“Let them have it,” he said to the boatswain. 

Cuff stepped back a foot or two and waited, lanyard in 
hand, till the Vengeance came up on an even keel, 

“Cut her maintop in half if you can, Cuff,” cried Jones, 
eagerly. 

Every eye on board Jones’ vessel was on the old man as 
he jerked the lanyard. 

The gun spoke and the deadly missile screeched through 
the air. 

The ball sped through the rigging of the Britisher and 
parted some of her maintop hamper; but the spar itself 
was untouched. 

“Missed, by thunder!” exclaimed Bill, wiping the smoke 
from his eyes with the back of his hand. 

At the same moment the Britisher wore round, an evo 
lution in which she was followed by her sister ship. 

“Signal the others that we will tackle the Benbow,” ex 
claimed Jones, turning to the signal master; “they must 
hold the attention of the other three-decker while we en¬ 
gage.” 

The signal man broke out the bunting, and the brig and 
the little sloop-of-war put their helms up and headed for 
the Benbow’s consort. 

Jones himself took the wheel of the Vengeance and 
jammed her up into the wind till she had the Britisher 
on her weather quarter. 

Fortunately, the Vengeance was what is known to sail ¬ 
ors as “a weatherly craft," and she could hug the breeze 
a good two points further up than the big three-decker, 
which, as was the way of her type, showed a wake almost 
as broad as a county. 

The sailing qualities of Jones’ ship brought him up 
where he could rake his foe with deadly effect. 

The young commander stood on his quarter-deck, in his 
battle-stained uniform, and watched the movements of 
the three-decker intently through the telescope. 

When the foresail of the Vengeance began to shiver 
as she took the wind over her bow, he ordered her to bear 
down on the huge foe that was now floundering about 
like some agitated leviathan. 

The reason of her dilemma was that her captain had 
attempted to follow Jones’ evolution and had only sue 
ceeded in getting his ship into "iron's.” 


That is, that she was jammed up into the wind till she 
pointed right at the blow. 

This had the effect of setting her “all aback,” and she 
lay helpless for a moment till her people could swing her 
great main topsail about. 

Jones was quick to see his advantage and act on it. 

“Fire!” 

The command was passed from the poop deck to the 
region below, where, in the light of the battle lanterns 
the crew, stripped to the waist and barefooted, were ram¬ 
ming home the deadly contents of the starboard broad¬ 
side. 

A sheet of flame and smoke belched from the Yankee’s 
side and she trembled from stern to stem-post, as the 
guns discharged their deadly hail. 

Jones sprang into the lee rigging as the smoke blew 
out over the sea and eagerly observed the effect of his 
assault. 

The telescope showed him that his broadside had se¬ 
verely crippled the Britisher, but owing to the great 
height of her sides, the shots had for the most part struck 
her too low- to inflict as much damage as would have 
been the case had she been raked along the decks. 

It was at this moment that the accident- Dale had 
dreaded took place. 

As the Yankee ship, after pouring in the broadside, was 
put before the / wflnd, the main topmast backstay parted, 
with the report of a cannon. 

Instantly the sail tore the spar of the main topmast clean 
out of its steppings and in a moment everything aloft was 
in a terrible muddle. 

The man at the helm let her pay off in order to save 
the foremast, for had that spar parted, they would have 
been at the mercy of their foe as much as if they were 
aboard a helpless wreck. 

The moment was the opportunity for which the Benboiv 
had been waiting. 

At the same time as Jones’ ship had met with her dis¬ 
aster the British ship had been “eased” and her pruning 
broadsides now threatened the brave little Vengeance. 

A perfect volcano broke from her three gun tiers and 
the decks of the Yankee ship were swept. as though by 
a tornado, under the storm of shell and grapeshot that 
hurtled about her. 

The little craft was riddled from stem to stern and her 
rigging cut to shreds by the chain shot, * with which some 
of the British guns had been loaded. 

The already strained masts snapped like wooden knit-

ting needles as the stays parted and the falling timbers 
and blocks converted the decks already strewed with the 
dead and dying into a veritable shambles. 

Amid the confusion Jones and Dale, with Jimmy and 
old Bill Cuff, alone remained calm. 

The scene was enough to try the nerves of the bravest. 

Everywhere men were dying or dead. The vessel, 
which but a moment before had been as stanch a craft as 
sailed the sea, was converted into a mere dismantled hull 
at the mercy of the Britisher to do as he willed with. 

“Get together all the men you can,” was Jones’ first 
order, “and cut away all this hamper.” 

“It ain’t much good,” muttered old Bill Cuff, as he 
sounded his boatswain’s pipe, to which, however, not more 
than a dozen men answered, “we are as good as dead 
already.” 

After the mass of rigging and spars that had floated 
alongside had been cut away by the crew’s axes, the vessel 
was found* to be fast sinking. 

At the same moment Jimmy uttered a cry and pointed 
to the three-decker. 

She had “gone about,” after her deadly broadside and 
was now bearing directly down on the Yankee’s dis¬ 
mantled hull. 

“What can she intend to do ?” asked Dale. 

“If she keeps on her present course that question is 
easily answered,” was Jones’ reply. 

“What does that mean?” 

“That she is going to ram us and send us to the bot¬ 
tom !” 

t 

“Never, she could not be so inhuman.” 

“Why not? This is war and they are dealing with a 
foe they are determined to crush out at all hazards. They 
will stop at nothing to accomplish their purpose.” 

“This is fiendish!” exclaimed Jimmy. 

“Is there no way we can save ourselves if she carries 
out the plan you think she has?” 

Dale asked the question. 

He was a brave man, as brave as could be found on the 
high seas; but there was something terrible to him in the 
thought of being sent to the bottom without having a 
chance to strike a blow in his own defense. 

If he could have died fighting he would have met his 
death, as would his two companions, without a tremor. 

Jones thought jtfor a moment, his eyes fixed on the fast 
advancing three-decker as he pondered. 

“There is a way,” he said at length, “but it is such a 


desperate resort that I am afraid you will , not care to 
adopt it.” . 

“What is it?” 

“Why, when the crash comes we must spring into her 
main chains and swarm onto her deck.” 

“It is only changing our mode of death.” 

“Possibly, but while there is life there is hope; and I 
mean to s make the attempt.” 

“Paul Jones, you are a brave man.” 

“To avoid death? I don’t think so; that is an instinct 
even with animals. 

“You must take care to keep your pistols dry, for we 
shall have plenty of work for both them and our cutlasses 
’when we get on the British decks.” 


CHAPTER III. 

RAMMED! 

The men who remained of the crew were called aft and 
the plan explained to them. 

They all agreed to stand by their officers and fight to the 
death rather than be sent to Davy. Jones in their riddled 
hulk. 

There was no doubt now of the Britisher’s plan. 

Straight down on the doomed Yankee bore the leviathan 
hull of the three-decker, driven at tremendous speed by 
her great spread of canvas. 

She was drawing so near by now that the men on the 
battered Vengeance could almost hear the “swish” of her 
forefoot as she cut through the seas. 

A shudder passed through more than one of the men 
on the bloody deck as they thought that ere long the keen 
stem would have cut the hulk they floated on sheer in 
half. 

It was at this moment that Paul Jones left the deck and 
disappeared down the after companion. 

He was not missed for several moments in the general 
confusion that reigned at the time. 

The young commander swung himself easily down the 
companion stairway till he reached the alleyway leading 
to the powder magazine. 

He wrenched one of the smoking battle lanterns from 
the wall and, tearing off a strip of his. shirt, wetted it in a 
pail of water which stood near the magazine door, and 
then spread powder on the dampened linen. 

Then he listened intently. 

Above, the groans of the dying that made the ship hide¬ 
ous lie heard a warning cry from the deck. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


/ 


The moment had come! 

Quickly he thrust the strip of linen, which was to serve 
as a fuse, into the flame of the lantern. 

It made a capital fuse and he trust it, sputtering and 
glowing, into the magazine. 

Then he turned and ran quickly to the deck. 

He was not a moment too soon! 

Right above the smoking, battered hull of the little 
Vengeance towered the huge black shape of the three- 
decker. 

From the low elevation of the little craft the Britisher 
seemed to tower like a mountain. 

“Stand by!” cried Jones, as the huge, sheering bow 
was right upon them. 

“Stand by!” was echoed among the devoted little Yan¬ 
kee band. 

The next moment there was a rending crash, as the 
bowsprit of the Britisher tore its way through what was 
left-of the Yankee’s top hamper. 

As the bobstay of the leviathan swept over dieir heads, 
the* men on the deck of the Vengeance reached up and 
seized it. 

Several of them caught the stay and hung for a mo¬ 
ment suspended over the rending timbers of the ship that 
had borne them so long and so faithfully ere they swarmed 
hand-over-hand into the main chains. 

Tones himself made a spring for the port channels and 
soon joined his followers in their effort to reach the deck 
of the big three-decker. 

Before the British crew, which was massed on the 
bow of the war ship to witness the destruction of the 
audacious Yankee, was aware of what had happened Jones 
and his men stood or* their forecastle, and with drawn 
swords and pistols drove furiously at the Johnny Bulls. 

The rather stolid crew of the Britisher were so com¬ 
pletely taken off their guard that it was some moments 
before they collected their wits sufficiently to rally and 
make some resistance to the bold Yankees. 

By this time the rest of the Britishers, that is to say, the 
few that had been left on the poop when the Britisher 
made her swoop on the poor Vengeance, had rushed to 
the aid of their comrades. 

They were too late, though, to stop the furious swoop 
of the Americans who, with Paul Jones waving his sword 
high above his head, in the lead, had dashed right through 
the group on the forecastle and were now well amidships. 

It cost hard fighting to gain this position, and their num¬ 
bers were sensibly decreased in the desperate sortie. 


“We cannot hold out if they rally and attack us in a 
body,” Dale was saying, when his words were cut short 
by a roar that seemed to rend the very sky. 

At the same moment there was a blinding flash of light, 
as if a thunderbolt had been launched in their midst, and 
they were thrown flat on their faces by some superlative 
force. 

At the same time the entire forward part of the British 
war ship was hoisted skyward and the air was dark with 
the rain of shattered timbers and dismembered human 
bodies. 

As soon as they were able after the shock, the Ameri¬ 
cans struggled to their feet and gazed about them, dazed 
for a moment at the suddenness of the whole affair. 

Dale was the first to guess what had happened. 

“You fired the magazine of the Vengeance,” he said to 
Jones. 

The young commodore nodded. 

There was a look of triumph on his face as he did so. 

His plan bad succeeded beyond his wildest expectation. 

Of their late enemies not more than half a dozen re¬ 
mained, and these were huddled forward in a frightened 
group eying the Yankees, as if they were some sort of 
supernatural beings. 

They offered no resistance to Jones when he ordered 
them to be imprisoned in the forward deckhouse, but 
huddled into their prison like a herd of frightened sheep. 

The smoke hung so heavily over the scene that Jones 
was unable, despite his anxiety, to see how the Pallas and 
her consort were faring. 

Suddenly, through the dense fog of powder fumes, a 
voice sounded. 

“Vast you British lubbers!” it hailed. “By Heaven, you 
have tackled a genuine Yankee sailor this trip, and if you 
come one step nearer I’ll blow some of you to kingdom 
come.” 

The voice had a familiar ring. 

It was that of old Bill Cuff. 

In the excitement of the moment no one had missed 
him, and it filled their hearts with joy to think that their 
old shipmate was safe and sound. 

They hailed him back and in another moment they were 
all shaking hands on the battle-scarred decks of the Brit¬ 
isher. 

A puff of wind sent the smoke, which had hung over 
them till now, like a pall streaming out to leeward. 

At what was revealed, when their full vision was re¬ 
stored to them, every man on that deck gave a cry.

PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


The sea was within a few feet of the vessel’s main deck. 
It was evident that the ship was taking on water fast 
and had only a short time to live. 

They were in the most desperate situation that can con¬ 
front a mariner. 

Paul Jones and his men were alone on the shattered 
decks of a sinking ship! 

Anxiously they cast their gaze about the ship. 

Their vigilance was barren of results, however, for her 
boats hung shattered in the davits. 

Jones cast a sweeping glance about them. 

Down to windward hung a heavy cloud of smoke. 

In the midst of it he could not doubt were the two re¬ 
maining ships of his squadron. 

What their fate was the cloud of battle did not enable 
him to ascertain, but he had every confidence in Com¬ 
manders Crawford and Biddle, and knew that they were 
giving a good account of themselves. 

Although the situation did indeed seem hopeless, Jones 
was not the man to let the grass grow under his feet. 

At any time, and particularly in moments that would 
have seemed to other men their last, his bold spirit rose 
to the emergency and had many times turned defeat into 
victory. 

“There are no boats, as you see,” he said, turning to 
Dale. 

“No,” was the reply; “it seems our doom is sealed.” 

‘ “Not at all. There is still a chance.” 

“A chance?” 

“Yes, though we have no boat, we can build a raft 
stout enough to hold us till either the Pallas or the Con¬ 
cord sees us and picks us up.” 

This put new hope into the little party, and they set to 
work to collect a number of planks that seemed suitable 
for their purpose. 

These were lashed, as securely as their time limit would 
allow, to a number of empty barrels which would give 
the raft buoyancy in the water. 

Their preparations complete, Jones threw in a keg of 
water and a bag of hard sea biscuits. * 

He would have stocked their frail craft with more water, 
for he did not know how long it might be before they 
were picked up, but time pressed. 

The last preparations were barely completed when the 
ship gave a sickening lurch. 

For a brief second those on board thought that their 
last moment had come, but with a brave effort the dying 
ship righted herself. 


She was now so deep in the water that to launch the 
raft over the side was an easy matter. 

A faint cheer rang out from the Yankees as the 
wretched contrivance slipped into the water, 

It was very faint, though, for not a man who stepped 
aboard her but realized that they might be going to their 
deaths. 

As they shoved off from the side of the sinking ship 
Dale cast a swift glance round the horizon. 

Far to windward there was a faint outline of purple 
mist lying like a veil over the blue water. 

The first “luff” gazed at this for some moments with 
a troubled expression on his face. 

It seemed that he scented trouble in the dim, filmy 
mass. 

If he did, however, he said nothing to his companions, 
none of whom seemed to have noticed the appearance that 
had caused a shadow to rest on his brow. 

At this moment his reflections were cut short by a wild 
cry from the deckhouse of the sinking ship. 

They had forgotten the imprisoned British sailors! . 

Their pleas to be taken off were pitiful. 

Without a moment’s hesitation Jones, who had the key 
of the place, plunged into the sea. 

With swift, strong strokes he had reached the side of 
the sinking Britisher almost before his companions had 
had time to guess what he was about to attempt. 

Seizing a dangling piece of rope, he swung himself 
easily to the deserted deck and raced for the deckhouse. 

The cries of the poor creatures within were pitiful. 

“Shoot us, if you will,” they cried, “but for pity’s sake 
do not leave us to drown like rats in a trap.” 

“I come to save you,” cried Joneg, as he turned the key 
and flung the door back. 

The deck was trembling with the vessel’s , last throes 
as the men rushed out. 

“Swim for your lives for the raft,” shouted Jones; “she 
is going down.” 

They all plunged into the water and made for the raft. 
All, that is but some half dozen who were unable to swim. 

One of these, a fair-haired young fellow, of slender 
build, Jones helped to the raft. 

This man was the only one he was able to save. 

The others sank like lead after a few struggles. 

“Pull for all you are worth, or we shall be caught in 
the undertow,” cried Dale, as soon as his leader and the 
rescued men were safe on board

A sinking ship creates a whirlpool into which everything 
afloat in her immediate neighborhood is drawn. 

Dale’s admonition was timely. 

As he spoke, the stern of the three-decker raised high 
in the air and then, with a noise like the rending apart of 
huge timbers, she sank forever. 

Those on the raft had little time to watch the spectacle, 
for they were kept busy sculling her out of the undertow. 

The man whom Jones had rescued gazed at the sinking 
derelict with horrified eyes. 

“But for you,” he said to Jones, “I should be going to 
my grave with the other poor fellows. Who am I to thank 
for my rescue ?” 

“My name is Paul Jones,” was the quiet reply. 

The fellow started back as if struck by lightning. 

“Paul Jones,” he exclaimed. “Why, they told me that 
you killed every Englishman and gave no quarter to your 
foes.” 

“We give quarter; but we never ask it.” was the Yan¬ 
kee’s curt reply. 

“Spoken like the brave man I now believe you are. I 
was the second lieutenant of yon ill-fated craft; my name 
is Charles Harkness, at your service, Capt. Jones, and can 
I ever reciprocate your noble act I will do so.” 

“Thank you,” said Jones, “I am sure that you will.” 

They were interrupted by a cry from Dale, who, for 
some time past, had not removed his eyes from the filmy 
cloud that had first attracted his attention when they were 
putting off from the ship. ' 

“The fog!” he cried. “Unless we can make the Pallas 
or the Concord before it is on us we are lost.” 

There was a note in his tones that gave no doubt of 
the seriousness of their position. 

The men pulled with all their strength for the two ves¬ 
sels, which were still fighting the other Britisher. 

The raft was a clumsy contrivance, however, and, de¬ 
spite their efforts, the fog curtain rolled over the darken¬ 
ing sea toward them till they were wrapped in its soft, 
impenetrable folds. 


CHAPTER IV. 

FACING A CRUEL DEATH. 

It was a situation filled with horror. 

They had no compass, and even if they had one it would 
have been useless to them in the surrounding gloom. 

Occasionally they could catch the distant boom of guns 
which told them in a vague way the whereabouts of the 


other two vessels, but although they pulled through the 
dense mist, as they judged, in the right direction, they 
could not seem to get any nearer. 

. Unless the fog lifted they had to face a situation that 
was unparalleled for sheer hopelessness. 

Their raft was of'the frailest, and even with the great¬ 
est economy their slender stock of provisions would not 
last them more than a day at most. 

They shouted with all the strength of their lungs in the 
effort to attract some attention, but no answer came to 
their hails. 

At length the sound of firing began to grow fainter, 
and they were compelled to acknowledge, although the 
realization brought with it a chill, that they were adrift 
on the unknown, with the vessels that might have given 
them aid rapidly bearing away from them. 

What made it harder to bear was the thought that as¬ 
sistance, had they been able to signal, was so near at hand. 

Suddenly from out of the fog a voice answered their 
hail. 

“If you be English, for de Lawd’s sake be mussiful an’ 
pick up two distressed mariners 1” it moaned. 

Another voice, coming from the same direction as the 
first, chimed in with: 

“We never did have no use for dat ere Paul Jones. We 
is Af’ican gen’lemen an’ prisoners till we was blowed up. 
Now we dunno if we is alive or jes’ colored angels.” 

Despite their terrible situation not a man aboard the 
raft could forbear smiling as he recognized the voices of 
Scipio and Cato. 

“I had forgotten them,” exclaimed Jones. “Well, I am 
glad they are safe and sound, for had they been sunk in 
the Vengeance I should never have forgiven myself.” 

A rift in the fog revealed to the men <?n the raft two 
woolly heads bobbing, side by side, up and down on the 
swell and holding tight to a floating chicken coop. 

Loud duckings from the interior of the latter showed it 
to be occupied. 

The negroes were soon hauled on board, to the intense 
disgust of old Bill Cuff, who opined that there wassome- 
thing not just all right about people who could emerge 
from an explosion like that of the magazine of the Venge¬ 
ance without further hurt than a little singed wool and 
a bad fright 

They drifted helplessly about till the fading light told 
them that night was coming on. 

With the coming of darkness a low, moaning wind 
sprang up and the sea began to roll in a wav that made

PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


the wretched collection of planks and barrels creak omi¬ 
nously. 

“What if the raft should part?” Dale whispered to 
Jimmy. 

“We should have to trust tc luck to get us out of it,” 
replied Jimmy. 

“There is another peril we shall have to face, even if 
we do escape from the raft."’ 

“What is that?” 

“Why, you know these waters are alive with British 
vessels, and I suspect that the two we encountered were 
simply stragglers from the main body.” 

“Our position would indeed be serious if we fell into 
the hands of the British.” , 

“Especially if they found out that we had sunk one of 
their finest ships.” 

“See! It looks as if this measly fog were going to lift 
at last.” 

The rising wind had indeed driven away the fog mass in 
heavy swirls of vapor that streamed far out to leeward 
like strips of veiling. 

From behind the driving masses a sickly moon shone 
out and feebly illumined the heaving waste of waters. 

The men on the raft gazed eagerly about. 

Toward every point of the compass they looked. 

The result was bitter disappointment. 

Not a trace of a sail was to be seen. 

As far as the eye could reach the sea was empty, save 
for the frail and hurriedly put together raft that floated, 
a mere speck on the desert of waters, with her burden 
of humanity. 

Jones approached Dale, 

“Old friend,” he said, “we have need of all our courage 
now, for this ip something very different from the excite 
inent of battle.” 

“True, it means days and perhaps weeks of impotent 
suffering.” 

“Days, perhaps ; you forget that we cannot by any possi¬ 
bility survive for more than a week.” 

“Trite, and even then-” 

“We will not dwell on it, but hope for the best. Now 
some had better lie down and try to sleep.” 

The men on the raft lay down on their frail support of 
planks and closed their eyes. 

Not one of them slept, however. 

Their thoughts were busy with various things far re¬ 
moved from the waste of deserted waters that surrounded 
them. 


Toward morning slumber mercifully visited some of 
them. 

When Dale awoke he saw. Jones standing by a make 
shift mast he and old Cuff had rigged up with the aid of 
one of the oars. 

The young commander was eagerly gazing all about 
him. 

The eastern horizon was dyed a delicate pink with the 
first heral dings of the coming day, and under the fresh 
light of dawn the heaving desert of salt water showed 
as desolate as though the keel of man had never 
plowed it. 

“You see nothing, sir?” asked Dale. 

Jones shook his head. 

The moaning of one of the men who. had been wounded 
struck on their ears. 

“Water! water!” he moaned. 

Jones nodded with a significant look at the tiny keg of 
the precious fluid/ 

Dale knew what he meant at once. 

There was hardly enough water to last them the day. 

Jones stooped over the wounded man and let him drink 
his fill. 

It was later in the day. that the others aroused them¬ 
selves, for they all felt that it was better to drowse away 
the hours till they should be rescued than to suffer the 
agonies of waking suspense. 

Toward noon Jones made a distribution of biscuit and 
water. 

They ate and drank with avidity. 

It was hours since any of them had done either. 

As the sun rose higher, the glare from the water daz¬ 
zled their eyes, and the heat increased till some of the 
sailors began to clamor for more water. ' 

“Men,” said Jones, addressing them, “we are Sll in a 
terrible position, and whether we shall ever get out of it I 
know not. That is in the hands of Providence. Of one 
thing, however, I can assure you; the first man caught 
stealing w ater will be shot.” 

That was all he said, but it had the effect of calming the 
men down and they endured in silence till sunset, when 
a second distribution was made. 

Jones himself took less than anyone. 

The British officer noticed this and offered to forego 
his own share, but Jones would not hear of it. 

It was about midnight when Jimmv arose from a trou 
bled sleep, and, gazing about him, made out a form by the 
.water cask. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


ri 


It was one of the rescued British sailors and he was in 
the act of repaying his saviors by filching from their 
scanty supply of water. 

Jimmy was on him in an instant. 

A quick, backward wrench of his hand sent the fellow 
sprawling. 

He was up in a minute, though, and Jimmy caught the 
gleam of a knife in his hand as he came at him. 

There was no time for the young ensign to draw his 
weapon. 

The only thing to do was to grapple w'ith the man. 

As they closed, Jimmy felt a sharp pain in his shoulder, 
as though a red-hot iron had been plunged into it. 

The Britisher had used his steel to good effect. 

But he had not calculated on the strength of the young 
American. 

With all his might Jimmy grasped the man’s wrist and 
bent it slowly back till he was on his knees. Then: 

“Drop that knife!” 

The blade rang to the deck. 

“Now look here,” said Jimmy, to his now helpless an¬ 
tagonist, “I will spare your life this time; but if ever you 
attempt such a thing again I shall shoot you like the dog 
you are.” 

. The fellow answered not a word, but slunk over to the 
side of the raft, on which his companions lay, and was 
soon wrapped in apparent slumber. 

Jimmy examined the spigot of the water keg. 

He turned it slightly so as to see if the British sailor 
had tampered with it. 

As his hand met the spigot he heard a loud shout be¬ 
hind him. 

It was the man he had just wrested the knife from. 

The young ensign was about to order the fellow away 
when he shouted at the top of his voice: 

“Here he is! Here is the fellow who steals the water 
while we are asleep!” 

In a second everyone on the raft was wide awake and 
Jimmy faced a score of accusing eyes. 

Even Jones was tempted for a moment to believe in the 
young ensign’s guilt, but one glance into the lad’s face 
and the ring of his voice as he exclaimed: 

“It’s a lie!” convinced Jones that his young ensign was 
guiltless of the base act of which he was accused. 

“What have you to say about this ?” he demanded, 
sternly, of the English sailor, a sinister-looking fellow, 
the lower part of whose face was enveloped in a huge red 
beard. 


His small eyes, dancing with hatred, he pointed at 
Jimmy as he replied: 

“I saw him do it!” 

A sensation ran through the men on the raft. 

If a trusted officer was to be detected in the act of 
stealing some of the precious water, in whom could they 
place any reliance? 

“Jimmy,” said Jones, sorrowfully, “I am afraid it looks 
pretty black against you, my boy. You know when we 
all awoke you were by the keg and were in the act of 
turning the spigot.” 

“For Heaven’s sake, commodore, you don’t think me 
guilty?” 

“Let me hear your explanation.” 

Jimmy related the events as they had occurred. 

“Does that sound like the truth ?” asked the red-bearded 
sailor, when the lad had finished. 

"Why, mates,” he went on, “you all saW that he had 
his hand on the spigot when I called you.” 

“So that I could tell how much you had stolen, you 
lying dog!” shouted Jimmy. 

“Does that sound a likely story ?” demanded the ill- 
favored Britisher. 

Even Jones was compelled to admit that it did not 
seem very credible. 

' “You know the penalty for such an act, Jimmy?” said 
the commander, sadly. 

“Capt. Jones!” exclaimed the young ensign, “you are 
making a horrible mistake. Surely, surely, you cannot 
think that I have done this thing?” 

“Jimmy boy, it looks black against you.” 

“Do you mean that you are going to shoot me ?” 

Jones bowed his head. He could not trust himself to 
speak. 

Deep confidence as he had in the lad, he could not doubt 
but that, tortured by the thirst that was beginning to tor¬ 
ment them all, the ex-powder monkey had been unable to 
resist the craving. 

Jimmy buried his face in his hands. 

“I don’t mind the penalty, commander,” he said bitterly, 
“for if you doubt me there is not much use in my living, 
but you should know that I am not a liar.” 

“Jimmy, we would all be too glad to believe it, but what 
were you doing by that water keg?” 

“That I have told you once.” 

“That is all the explanation you have to offer ?” 

“It is.” ' 

The English sailor broke into a brutal laugh.

PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


“His voting life will be snuffed out, anyhow," he re¬ 
marked to a comrade near him. 

“Not just yet!” said a clear, ringing voice, as Lieut. 
Harkness strode up to Jones. 

All stared at the English officer’s sudden interruption. 

Jones looked at him interrogatively. 

"You have evidence pointing to the guilty party?" he 
asked. 

“Yes." 

"Who is he ?” 

“There he stands!" the Britisher pointed to the sailor 
who had accused Jimmy. 

“Why did yen not speak before?" 

"I did not dream that matters were going to turn out so 
seriously; besides, 1 was unwilling to see a countryman 
convicted of such a base act, but I was forced to believe 
the evidence of my own eyes when I saw that man drink 
ing from the spigot of the water butt.” 

A terrible change had come over the face of the bearded 
sailor as his officer had spoken. 

His florid features were overspread with a sickly gray. 

Jones spoke to him sharply. 

"Come here!" 

The fellow shuffled over to the young commander. 

“What have you to say to this charge?” 

“It’s a lie!” * ' 

The tone in which he said it was enough to convict the 
man of falsehood, but Jones let him go a little further. . 

“You mean you were not at the water keg at all ?” 

“That is what I mean; yes.” 

“I do not believe you. There are stains of water on the 
front of your shirt.” 

The fellow looked down in terror. 

Yes, there they were beyond a doubt. 

Several wet stains of the water that had dribbled from 
his mouth as he drank; and they made a damning piece 
of evidence against him. 

Jones’ face grew hard as steel as he looked at the cring¬ 
ing creature before him. 

He hated a sneak, and above a sneak he abhorred a 
liar. 

The man who faced him was both. 

He turned to Jimmy. 

“Give me your pistol.” 

Jimmy blanched. 

The fate he would not have hesitated to face himself 
he could not bear to be instrumental in bringing on an¬ 
other. 


Jones saw his hesitation. 

“Come, Jimmy,” he said, “you cannot save the man by 
refusing me your weapon.” 

“But you surely do not mean to shoot him?” 

“As if he were a dog. Did he think of the lives that 
depended on that water when he tried to steal it ?” 

Jimmy was forced to admit the justice of Jones’ argu • 
ment. 

Without another word he handed him the pistol. 

Jones pointed it at the shrinking wretch in front of him. 

“If youliave anything to say, speak now,” he said. 

The sailor broke into a torrent of blasphemy. 

Jones checked him. 

“Do not revile your'Maker in your last moments,” he 
said. 

The only answer was another burst of profanity; then, 
before Jones could put himself on guard, the frenzied man 
leaped full at him and buried his fingers in his throat. 

"If I am to die, by heavens! you go with me!” lie 
shrieked, in the tones of a madman. 

The fury of his assault sent Jones staggering backward 
toward the edge of the raft. 

In another moment they were both struggling in the 
water. , 

There is an old saying that there is no enemy as dan 
gerous as a desperate coward. 

• Jones struggled with all his might to free himself, but 
the fellow’s fingers sunk deeper into his flesh. 

He felt his senses leaving him, as, completely exhausted, 
he made a last effort to wrest himself from the madman’s 
grasp. 

CHAPTER V. 

HELP HEAVES IN SIGHT. 

For the first few seconds after the two men had gone 
over the side Jimmy and the others had stood paralyzed 
with amazement at the affair. 

As the young ensign- saw the difficulties his com¬ 
mander was in, however, it required , only the work of a 
moment for him to plunge into the water to the rescue. 

He threw his arm about the throat of Jones’ assailant, 
as the latter was about to sink for the last time, and forced 
him back. 

As his head was wrenched round, the fellow released 
his death grip on Jones’ throat and turned his attention 
to Jimmy. ; 

“I’ll do for you, anyway, you pup!” he hissed, as he 
strove to grasp the boy’s windpipe. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY.

But Jimmy was on his guard. 

He forced his arm under the other's chin, and together 
they sank. 

Jimmy was too experienced a hand in the water not to 
have taken a good lungful of air before he went under. 

The other, however, had not, and, when they once 
more shot to the surface, Jimmy felt the form of the 
treacherous fellow limp in his arms. 

He felt his heart. 

It had stopped beating. 

The man’s lips, too, were blue about the comers. 

He was dead beyond a doubt. 

Nevertheless the men on the raft worked over him to 
try and fan some faint spark of vitality to life, but, at the 
end of an hour, they saw that their efforts were useless. 

It was sundown of their second day on the raft that 
they consigned the body to the deep. 

Shortly after they took their last drink from the keg 
and ate the last biscuit. 

If help did not come shortly, they were doomed men. - 

All that night they sat up on their frail floating plat¬ 
form, and some of them prayed that aid would come be¬ 
fore death claimed them. 

Dawn, however, showed them the same monotonous 
level of rolling water, without a sail to break the loneli¬ 
ness of the heaving waste. 

They spoke but little. 

Men in their position have little to say; for each is 
busy with his own thoughts. 

The wounded man groaned in his pain and implored 
them to give him a. drop of water to moisten his parched 
throat. 

They dared not tell him that the water was all gone, 
but, with the strange intuition that comes sometimes to 
the dying, he sat upright and, pointing his finger at the 
keg, screamed: 

“You have drunk it all, you cursed thieves. You mean 
to leave me to die without a drop to ease my last hours.” 

It was terrible to hear his ravings as he called down 
curses on the heads of the men who, as he thought, had 
deprived him of his share of the precious fluid. 

At last lie raised himself up and tried to drag his 
wounded body to the keg. 

The effort was too much for him, and he fell exhausted 
halfway. 

They let him lie there until Jones saw his position, and 
tenderly lifted him back onto the pile of canvas that 
served him. as a pillow. 


Toward evening a tiny cloud appeared on the horizon. 

It spread with the rapidity of an ink spot on blotting 
paper and soon the whole heavens were overcast with 
a sooty pall of dark clouds. 

The castaways hailed this with expressions of thankful¬ 
ness. 

It meant the one thing that might yet save their lives— 
rain. 

Presently a few heavy drops fell. 

They turned their faces, with their mouths open, eagerly 
up to the sky that they might not miss a drop of the 
blessed moisture, 

"We must catch some of this downpour and save it,” 
said Tones, who realized that they might still have many 
days of suffering to face ere a ship or death put an end 
to their miseries. 

The canvas from beneath the wounded man’s head was 
spread so as to catch as much of the rain as possible. 

It leaked like a sieve, and when the shower ceased, only 
a few minutes after it had begun, there was not more 
than a quart of dirty water to show for their pains. 

One of the sailors stepped up to Jones. 

“Are you going to serve out that water now, sir?” he 
asked, respectfully enough, yet with a note in his voice 
that Jones did not like. 

"You know well enough that this is to be kept for that 
poor fellow,” he said, indicating the dying man, who had 
cried so beseechingly for water that day. 

“What, we don’t get none of it?” 

"Not a drop, my man.” 

The sailor turned without a word and joined his mates. 

They talked together for- a while in low tones. 

Evdn in situations such as that in which the castaways 
found themselves, men will form into cliques. 

This is for various reasons on land, but among seamen 
there is the line that is drawn between forecastle and 
quarter-deck that nothing, not pven the prospect of a ter¬ 
rible death, can eliminate. 

So it was that the British officer was in the group com¬ 
prising Jones and his two^officers, not forgetting old Bill 
Cuff, who held himself to be the equal of any quarter-deck 
pacer. 

The crew, on the other hand, formed a little body of 
their own. 

They outnumbered the officers two to one and were 
equally well armed. 

“Mark my word, captain, those fellows mean mischief.”, 
said Dale, turning to Jones.

PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


Jones’ eyes snapped as he replied: 

"Well, if they think they are going to put tongue to 
that poor fellow’s water, they are much mistaken, mischief 
or no mischief.” 

"I am with you, Capt. Jones, in this,” said the Brit¬ 
isher. “I hope that the fact that I am your prisoner will 
not prevent you from letting me draw my sword on your 
side if it comes to a tussle.” 

"Not at all,” replied Jones. “If they do, indeed, intend 
to mutiny, every sword we have will improve our chance 
of beating them off.” 

At last the sailor who had approached Jones before de ¬ 
tached himself from his fellows, and once more ap¬ 
proached the commodore. 

“Me and my mates has been talking this thing over,” 
he said, “and we have decided that the living has more 
right to the water than a fellow what can’t last more than 
a few hours anyway.” 

Despite the veiled threat in the man’s manner, Jones 
did not lose his temper. 

“Surely you would not have him pass his last hours 
tortured by the agonies of thirst ?” he asked. 

“We don’t know nothing about that. We wants our 
rights.” 

“Well, what do you wish me to do?” 

Jones was sparring for time. He saw, as soon as the 
man spoke, that they were in for a fight, and every mo¬ 
ment he could avert it, while he decided on some plan of 
action, would be to their advantage. 

The man leered at him insolently. 

All the conventionality that marked the quarter-deck 
intercourse between officer and man was at an end now. 

The two groups of men were alone on a deserted sea 
on a tiny and frail raft. 

They were reduced to the situation of the primitive man 
to whom the battle for the necessities of life was a daily 
occurrence. 

‘Well, do we get the water?” 

“No, ypu don’t 1” 

Question and answer rang out sharp as rifle shots. 

“Well, we mean to have it in spite of you, Capt. Paul 
Jones.” 

The young commander’s fist shot out like a flash, and 
the sailor who had addressed him was stretched on the 
flooring of the raft. 

His mates uttered a growl of rage as they advanced 
threateningly toward* the group of officers. . i'. 

They had drawn their sea knives and cutlasses, and 


presented a formidable appearance, compared to the group 
of officers who awaited their coming calmly. 

The man whom Jones had knocked down lay like a 
stone, as he had fallen. 

This put one of their foes out of the way. 

“Hold on, men!” cried Dale, raising his hand to com 
mand attention; “have you considered what you are about 
to do? This is mutiny on the high seas.” 

“You can’t frighten us with your threats,” growled one 
of the seamen. “You’re not on your cursed quarter-deck 
now, but here, as man to man, we mean to drive you into 
the sea if we don’t get that water.” 

“Well, then, you can try to drive us into the sea; but 
I give you fair warning that, if you attack us, we will 
show you no mercy,” said Jones. 

The men made a concerted rush at these words. 

The man who had addressed Jones rushed straight at 
him and aimed a savage sweep of his great cutless at the 
young commander’s head. 

«Jones dodgedJ:he blow and, lunging, ran the fellow clean 
through the body. 

At the same moment, Harkness, the British officer, ac 
counted for another. 

Jimmy’s sword was knocked out of his hand, and the 
young ensign would have fared Ijadly if it had not been 
for old Bill Cuff, who seized the fellow who had struck 
the blow by the throat and hurled him into the sea as if 
he had been a stone. 

Then the fighting grew so fast that none of the par¬ 
ticipants had time to observe the movements of the. others. 

It was cut and thrust for dear life. 

The young Britisher was wounded, but fought doggedly 
on, with the courage of his race; and old Cuff had got a 
slash over the arm. 

On the other hand, they had accounted for fully half 
their opponents, and now the officers were evenly matched. 

Slowly they drove the mutineers back to the edge of the 
raft 

The men made a desperate sortie, but their heart was 
gone, and they lost two of their number in the assault. 

At last they threw down their arms and called for 
quarter. 

Jones and his officers had won. 

At that moment Jimmy exclaimed: 

“Look!” 

They followed his gaze, and saw on the horizon a white 
sail. ,

CHAPTER VI. 

IN THE LION’S JAWS. 

She was as yet only hull down, but, at the pace she was 
coming, they soon made out that she carried royals and 
double spencers and was a craft of great speed. 

As she drew nearer she revealed a double row of black • 
and-white ports and a line of bright copper. 

‘"She is a war ship!” exclaimed Dale. 

“Beyond a doubt,” said Jones, “but of what nation I 
cannot yet make out.” 

Harkness had remained silent since the sail had hove in 
sight. 

All at once, however, he gave a start and regarded the 
ship earnestly. 

“I can set your doubts at rest as to what the nationality 
of yon ship is,” he said. 

They all leaned forward to catch his words. 

“She is his majesty’s sloop-of-war Harpy, and there, 
on the horizon, if my eyes do not deceive me, are two 
corvettes and a brig of the same service.” 

This was about as bad as it could be. 

The sloop had undoubtedly sighted them, for she had 
backed her spencers and was rounding to as gracefully as 
a great swan. 

“I know her skipper,” said Harkness, with a side glance 
at Jones. “He is a man named Grimstone, and as big a 
martinet as there is in the British Navy.” 

Jones guessed his meaning. 

“You mean that there will be a court-martial on board 
her in the morning, and the prisoner will be Paul Jones ?” 

Harkness hung his head; he could not tell the man he 
had grown to admire that, in all probability, he would be 
hanged before dawn. 

The sloop was rounded to, and brought up, with beauti¬ 
ful precision, within a cable's length of the raft. 

A boat was lowered, and came flying through the water 
toward the castaways. 

As she drew' alongside, a midshipman seated in the stern 
sheets hailed them. 

“Raft ahoy! What in blazes are you doing out here in 
mid-Atlantic ?” 

“Hullo. Ddfringer,” cried Harkness, “is that really you? 
I last saw you on the old Viet ary.” 

“It’s me right enough,” replied the shaver, as the boat 
swfept alongside; “but are you Charlie Harkness, and what 
on earth are you doing on this Noah’s Ark ?” 


“I owe my life to this gentleman here,” replied Hark¬ 
ness, indicating Jones. 

The middy bowed as he looked at Jones. 

He suddenly stopped short in the midst of his saluta 
tion as his eye fell on Jones’ uniform. 

“Rebel, by thunder!” he exclaimed. “Old Grimstone 
will be glad to hear of this.” 

“One of my men informs me that you are Paul Jones, 
the rebel. Is that a fact ?” 

Capt. Grimstone, of the Harpy, drew his brows to¬ 
gether as he looked hard at the man confronting him in 
the wardroom of the sloop-of-war. 

"It is true that I am Paul Jones,” was the reply. 

“The pirate?" 

“I think you are making a mistake ; I am acting com¬ 
modore of the American Navy.” 

“We do not recognize such a navy.” 

“That is strange; you .have had opportunities enough 
for recognition.” 

“Insolence will not help your cause, sir.” 

' “I had no intention of being insolent. I merely wished 
to point out what even you must admit to be a fact.” 

The face of Capt. Grimstone grew purple with rage at 
the calm tone of the man he was endeavoring to bully. 

“Very well, sir; if you do not choose to answer my 
questions, you are under no obligations to do so. But I 
give you fair warning that I shall hold myself equally 
free, and order you hanged at sunrise.” 

Paul Jones regarded the man opposite him with stead¬ 
fast gaze. 

“Is it according to the rules of civilized warfare to hang 
a man wdthout a trial ?” he asked. 

“In such a case as this—yes. England must clear the 
seas of such as you.” 

“England pays me a great compliment,” said Jones, 
bowing. 

Capt. Grimstone’s face was a study. 

“Take him away!” he bellowed to the two marines who 
guarded the young American. “I’ll have him rigged as 
a jewel block by noon to-morrow, or my name’s not Grim 
stone.” 

Jones was marched back to the gloomy brig, in which 
Cuff and his two brother officers were confined. 

"Well,” said Dale, as the marines locked the doer, 
“what is it ?” 

'They mean to hang me at sunrise.” 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


1 6 

An exclamation of horror burst from the lips of the 
others. 

“What—without even a trial ?” 

“So it seems. You see, I am a pirate and, as such, not 
entitled to the formality of a trial.” 

“Who could have told them of your identity?” 

“One of the sailors we rescued from the three-decker, 
I suppose.” 

“You don’t think it was Harkness?” 

“I am sure it was not.” 

“I am glad you have such implicit faith in him. For 
my part, I am inclined to believe he was the man who 
did it” , 

Jones drew a small piece of paper from his pocket. 

“Read this,” he said, “and perhaps you will alter your 
opinion.” 

“At midnight,” read the note, “the watch is changed. 
Your lock is a simple one, and easily filed. I will convey 
the tools to you. Do not despair. You saved my life —I 
will save yours.” 

Dale laid the letter down with an exclamation of aston¬ 
ishment. 

“It is from him?” 

“Yes.” 

“How do you know ?” 

“Because he handed it to me as I passed him on the 
way to the wardroom.” 

“That was the: reason it was not found on you. when 
we were searched?” 

“Exactly. The only thing to do now is to wait till 
eight bells, and see if Lieut. Harkness carries out his 
promise.” 

The hours went slowly by, while outside their prison 
they could hear the monotonous tramp of the sentry. 

At last they heard a sharp challenge, and Harkness’ 
voice saying: 

“I must see the prisoners.” 

The door of the brig was at once thrown open and the 
young officer entered. 

He spoke to the prisoners in a sharp voice. 


“I am sent to see if you have anything to say before 
your sentence of death is executed upon you, prisoner 
Paul Jones ?” he said, in a brusque tone. 

Jones stepped up to him. 

“No, sir, you can tell your commander that I have noth¬ 
ing but contempt for the man who will take advantage of 
such a chance as brought me into his hands.” 

“That is all you have to say?” 

“That is all.” 

“I am sorry; if you will give your parole that you will 
keep to the poop deck, you may not be hanged till we land 
in old England.” 

“I will never pledge my word to stay voluntarily on 
board a British war ship.” 

Jones saw the drift of the young officer's talk. 

He was waiting till the sentry should have passed che 
door, after which he would npt return for a good fifteen, 
minutes; for the door of the brig was strong, and it was 
not deemed necessary to watch the prisoners very closely. 

Indeed, the British never dreamed of men, penned as 
the Yankees were, making the attempt. 

As soon as the sentry’s footsteps had died away, Hark¬ 
ness extended his hand. 

Jones grasped it, and the British officer slipped some¬ 
thing hard and cold to the other. 

It was a file. 

Then, from the bosom of his loose deck coat, he pro¬ 
duced two long-barreled pistols and a brace of cutlasses. 

“These were all I could get,” he explained, “but they 
may help you if it comes to a tussle.” 

He grasped Jones’ hand once more. 

“Good-by, Capt. Jones,” he said. “I am an English¬ 
man and, I suppose, your natural enemy; but we may 
never meet again, and I want to express to you my hopes 
for your welfare and——” He stopped. “Oh, hang for¬ 
mality!” he exclaimed, the next moment, “good-by and 
good luck to you all!” 

The next moment he was gone. * 

The four men in the cell looked at one another. 

“There goes'a man!” said Dale. 

The others nodded. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


As for Jones, his heart was too full to speak for a 
moment 

They soon had the lock fastenings filed away, so that 
it would be possible for them to remove it at will. 

Nothing now remained to be done but to wait till the 
watch, was changed. 

Before he left, Harkness had slipped Jones another 
note. 

The American opened 'it and found that it contained the 
information that the Harpy was towing her longboat 
astern. 

“You can slip over the stem and into her,” said the 
writer, “and, with decent luck, get away.” 

“It seems a desperate chance,” said Dale. 

“It’s a sight better than being clapped into an English 
prison at any rate,” growled old Cuff. 

-s 

“So say I,” echoed Jimmy. 

“Say,” remarked Cuff, after a brief silence, “what about 
the two niggers ?” 

Jones laughed. 

“Oh, they have gone back to the galley,” he said; “I am 
under no apprehension that they will not be treated well, 
for the Britishers needed a doctor 1” 

“Well, it’s a relief to think that we won’t be hampered 
with them,” said Cuff, who had never fbrgiven Scipio and 
Gato for the accident to the soup. 

Eight bells chimed out sharp and clear. 

So far as the four prisoners could judge from the 
motion of the vessel, it was a calm night; which was so 
much the better for them, if they could only get into the 
boat. 

Silently as a thief Jones wrenched off the filed lock, 
and liberty faced the four Americans. 

Grasping their cutlasses and the precious pistols in a 
determined grip, they crept along the dark ’tween decks. 

Capt. Grimstone was a great economist, and did not 
provide lanterns for the lower decks of his sloop, except 
in time of action. 

It was this fact which saved the lives of Jones and his 
followers, for, as they advanced from behind a bulkhead, 
they came full on the two sentries, stealing a smoke in 
the embrasure of a gun.' 


They drew back without a sound and the men went on 
smoking, afterward walking to the port and looking 
out at the sea and talking, after the manner of senti¬ 
mental sailors, of their sweethearts in the green lanes of 
England. 

Now was their time, and, silently as cats, the Yankees 
slipped up the companion. 

They crouched in the shelter of its hood for a moment. 

After a cautious reconnoitering of the deck, however, 
they deemed it was safe to make their dash for freedom. 

The night was as dark as a pocket, and this fact un- 

» 

doubtedly saved them from discovery. 

For, although they could not see him, they could dis¬ 
tinctly hear the “tramp, tramp” of the lookout in the bow. 

They crept aft, keeping carefully in thd shadow of the 
bulwarks. 

Suddenly Jones’ foot encountered something soft. 

The “something” uttered a grunt. 

It was a man. 

Without a moment’s hesitation Jones seized him by the 
throat and choked him into insensibility. 

It was no time for half measures. 

After this they met with no obstacle till they came to 
the ladder leading to the poop deck. 

They had either to climb this, with the risk of being 
seen, or creep through the main cabin and drop out of 
the stern windows. 

They decided on the cabin. 

* 

They had crossed it, the soft carpet not making a sound, 
and were wrenching open one of the big stern windows 
that ships of that day were fitted with, when there came 
an interruption. 

A man, carrying a lantern, came out of one of the 
berths opening off the main cabin. 

Jones recognized him at once.’- 

It was Capt. Grimstone. 

r 

The Yankee sprang at him like a tiger. 

4. ■ • ■ 

The British captain struggled manfully; but it was no 
use. Jones was too much for him. 

Cuff got some rope out of a locker, and they gagged 
him by stuffing Jones’ handkerchief in his mouth. 



i8 PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


There they left him, like a trussed turkey, and as angry 
as a wet hen. 

‘‘They won't need him till to-morrow," laughed Dale, 
as they scrambled through the window. 

“No, but he will have to postpone that hanging he 
was looking forward to so eagerly, I fancy." replied Jones, 
as he followed. | 

They felt about with their feet for a rope. 

There was one dangling from the stern that they lo¬ 
cated without any difficulty. 

It seemed so handy that they guessed their friend Hark 
ness must have placed it there. 

One after the other they slid down it and into the boat. 

As soon as they were all on board, Jones raised his 
cutlass. 

“Good-by, Harpy!'’' he said, as he cut the painter; 
"when next we meet Paul Jones may be arranging a- neck 
tie party of his own." 

At this moment there came loud shouts from the sloop, 
which was fast vanishing in the night. 

“They must have found Capt. Grimstone,” said Cuff, 
with a grin. 

“Well, if they don't take it into their heads to look for 
the boat, we are all right,” replied Jones. 

Apparently the Britishers did not take it into their 
heads to look for the boat, for the cries died away and 
the little craft was alone on the sea. 


CHAPTER VII. 

PAUL JONES’ RUSE. 

“Do you not see some object out there to leeward, sir?” 

Ensign Downs, of the American sloop-of-war Pallas , 
asked the question of Capt. Crawford. 

The young officer's superior brought his telescope to 
bear on the object indicated. 

“Why, bless my soul. Mr. Downs,' - he exclaimed,, “it’s 
a boat." 

“A boat!” exclaimed the other, incredulously. 

“Yes, an open boat and, as I live, there are human be 
mgs aboard of her. They are waving to us. Tell the 


sailing master to change our course so as to bring us 
down on her.” 

The ensign hurried to obey the order. 

“Shall I signal the Concord, sir?” 

“No,” said the captain, glancing at his consort, which 
lay a short distance to windward,” for she has sighted 
them, too, and is heading for them.” 

“Who can they be, sir, do you think?” • 

“I have no idea, unless possibly part of the crew of the 
three-decker we sank, just after poor Paul Jones and his 
ship were lost.” 

"Do you know, sir, I can’t help thinking that, in spite 
of our fears, Capt. Jones will turn up all right?” 

"Let us hope so, my boy. We do not know but that 
he may have got away in the fog." 

“Then might that not be his boat ?” 

The captain shook his head. 

“So far as I can see, she is a Britisher. Their boats are 
always painted as is this one. From her build, though, 
she evidently belonged to a man-of-war. 

"Hullo! hullo!" he broke off, excitedly, “what’s that? 
It cannot be!—yes, it is, though! Cheer, boys! Cheer 
for all you’re worth!” he cried, turning to the crew. “Paul 
Jones is safe and in yonder boat.” 

t 

A deafening cHfeer broke from the throats of the men 
at the news that their beloved commander was safe. 

Surely no boat was ever lowered more briskly than the 
one that dropped from the side of the Pallas a moment 
after Capt. Crawford had recognized the young leader of 
the American Navy. 

Half an hour later Jones with his officers was seated 
in the wardroom of the Pallas, narrating his experiences 
with the British, and receiving the congratulations of 
high and low. 

They had only drifted in the boat for a day, and that 
they had been picked up so quickly by the Pallas was ac 
counted for by the fact that the American ships had spent 
the time, since the supposed loss of their commodore, in 
cruising about the neighboring ocean in the hope that they 
might find some trace of his fate. 

The day was one of general rejoicing. 

Seated on the capstan head, old Cuff entertained the 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


crew with, a full, and not too veracious, narrative of their 
adventures. 

His account served to fan the flame of the men’s hatred 
for the British, and not a soul before the mast on either 
of the Yankee ships but was eager to tackle the king’s 
fleet once more. 

Jones and his officers had decided, after a consultation, 
to head for the coast of France. 

They knew that the British fleet was somewhere be¬ 
tween them and the land of Gaul, but they trusted to the 
nimbleness of their wits to escape them. 

From where they now lay, it was a sail, provided the 
wind held fair, of only a few days before they could reach 
the French coast. 

To reach America, on the other hand, would take some 
weeks. 

As it was absolutely necessary to refit their craft, it 
was decided to run into some port on the west coast of 
France. 

A course was accordingly laid and, a few days later, 
they entered the Channel. 

The English Channel was at that time, as it is at the 
present day, one of the most thoroughly patrolled pieces 
of water in the world. 

The Yankee commander hardly expected to gpt through 
without encountering some British ship doing police work, 

.1 

but he hoped to get by through the exercise of his native 
wit. 

During a calm which fell when they were still some 
three hundred miles we^t of the Scilly Islands, the men 
were set to work painting out the ports on the side of the 
two Yankee ships and mussing up their running gear, 
and generally smart appearance, till they looked like two 
tired, old Geordies, home from a cruise to the West 
Indies. 

Thus disguised they'slipped past the Lizard and into 
England’s sacred water. 

About the middle of the second day when, with royals 
all rove any fashion, and topsails timidly reefed, they were 
rolling down the Channel, a dandy frigate of the British 
line hove in sight. 

From topmasts to kelson she spoke of discipline. 


19 

There was man-of-war written, to the eye of the sailor, 
in every halyard and in the graceful set of her masts. 

Down she bowled until she lay to within a few cables’ 
lengths of Jones’ disguised craft. 

Then she backed her topsails and, losing way, settled 
as gracefully as a resting swan on the rolling seas. 

An officer, resplendent in gold lace and brass buttons, 
leaped to her rail. 

“Ship ahoy! Where are you from ?” 

Jones, who, with the rest of his officers, had donned 
old sea togs and no more resembled the scrupulously neat 
and dashing American naval hero, answered in a piping 
voice: 

“Out forty days from Jamaica—who are you?” 

“His majesty’s frigate Bcllona. Heave to, we’ll send 
a boat.” 

“Can’t wait; we’re in a hurry.” 

“Hurry be hanged!” was the reply. “Heave to! and 
look sharp about it, or we’ll let daylight into your ugly 
bones!” 

Jones waved his hand in true Geordie fashion to signify 
that Iff would obey, and the topsails were swung round 
till the Pallas was stationary. 

The Concord followed suit, and soon the two vessels 
were as motionless as the frigate. 

A boat came skimming over the waves and a dandy, 
young officer stepped superciliously up in the stem sheets. 

“Where’s your gangway, my man?” he asked, sharply. 

“Don’t you see the Jacob’s ladder?” asked Jones; “ain’t 
that good enough for you, my man?” 

“None of your impudence, my fine fellow, or we’ll send 
you to the bottom without much ceremony,” said the young 
officer, as he placed his foot on the Jacob’s ladder and pro¬ 
ceeded to climb up the side. 

He got his varnished boots ducked as the Pallas gave a 
heavy roll, and this did not improve his temper. 

“Pall!” he said, as he gained the deck, “how these tubs 
do smell, to be sure. I really don’t see how these fellows 
support life. Now, my good man, will you bring your 
papers here on deck? For I really cannot go into that 
stuffy cabin of yours.” 

Jones bowed and brought out, in a tin box, the set of 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


papers that had been carefully forged for just such an 
emergency. 

The officer turned them over with a gloved hand. 

“Yes, yes, they’re all right, I suppose, and now, as we 
are short-handed, I shall need some of your crew.” 

It was the custom in those days for a nation when at 
war to stop even the ships flying her own ensign, and 
“impress,” as it was called, as many of her crew as she 
happened to need. 

Jones was, therefore, fully prepared for this, and ac¬ 
ceded to the other’s request with alacrity. 

The young officer was somewhat surprised that Jones- 
offered no resistance to his demand, but, as he had sized 
him up as a simple fellow, he did not see anything sus¬ 
picious in it. 

Jones excused himself and* stepped below. 

He whispered something to each man of the crew and 
soon the British officer’s boat was loaded to the gunwales 
with rough-looking sailors with no suggestion of trained 
fighters about them. 

Among them, but in their disguises looking no different 
from the rest, were Jones and Dale. 

Under their loose smocks each man was armed to the 
teeth, and in nowise was there anything about them to 
suggest that they were anything but what the young of¬ 
ficer thought them—a fine body of merchant sailors. 

“Well, captain,” said the yOung officer to Jones, as the 
boat rode over the waves on her return journey, “I am 
sorry to have to do this, but you see,' we are at war now, 
and, if we can rid the Atlantic of this fellow Jones, "the 
Yankee admiral,’ as he calls himself, why, so much the 
better for you merchantmen.” 

, Jones nodded. 

“Just the same,” he said, “I feel it will be my duty to 
protest to your captain so that I can enter it truthfully in 
the log to account to the owners for my delay.” 

“Well, of course that is as you like,” said the Britisher, 
as the boat scraped the frigate’s side. “I am sure Sir 
Frederick de Vere, our captain, will be delighted to see 
you.” 

Jones bowed once more, and, followed by his crew, 
climbed up the gangway onto the deck of the frigate. 


She was a magnificent vessel, and evidently commanded 
by a man who prided himself on his discipline. 

Her -decks were white as snow and, from the Ted- 
painted tompions of her guns to the snowy hammocks 
lashed along her rails, she was as spick and span as a 
Quakeress. 

The young Officer who had commanded the boat which 
impressed Jones’ crew led the supposed merchant captain 
aft to the cabin under the poop deck. 

He ushered him, with a bow, into the luxurious cabin 
of the aristocratic commander and, with a word of intro¬ 
duction and another bow, left them. 


CHAPTER VIII. 

THE BRITISH LEARN A NEW TRICK. 

Sir Frederick de Vere was an officer of the type who 
believed in the old-fashioned methods of doing things. 

He eyed Jones with marked disapproval as the dis¬ 
guised Yankee captain stumped, with his clumsy sea boots, 
on. the soft, Turkey carpet. 

“Aw, my good man,- stand on the deck, if you please.” 

, Jones obeyed. 

“Aw, you want to speak to me—aw?” x 

“Yes, I wish to protest against the high-handed man- 
* 

ner in which my crew have been pressed by your frigate.” 

“Well, my good person, you are at perfect liberty to— 
aw—protest and—aw—all that; but it won’t do you a 
penn’orth of good—aw!” 

“No?” Jones was mildly interrogative. 

, “No, I can assure you, no. And now, if you have fin¬ 
ished your—aw—protest—aw—will you have the good¬ 
ness to remove yourself from my—aw—awpawtment ?” 

“One moment, captain,” exclaimed Jones, stepping 
quickly to the rear window of the cabin and dragging a 
strip of white linen from his breast as he did so. 

“Why, my good man! What impertinence! What do 
you want to do?” 

“I want you to stand in that corner.” 

The drawl was gone from the supposed “lime-juicer’s” 
voice, and the words snapped from his lips like shots from 
a musket. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


21 


The indignant commander turned like a flash. 

He faced a pistol held in the hand of the man he had 
fancied a harmless, old dodderer. 

‘‘Why, I never heard of such impertinence!” he gasped. 
“Who are you r” 

“Paul Jones!” whipped out the man with the gun. “The 
guns of my two ships are trained on this vessel; out of 
the window I am holding a strip of white linen that I 
shall wave if I want them to fire a broadside at you.” 

The old captain made a move. 

“Don’t move, or I’ll blow your brains out!” 

Sir Frederick sank back in a chair; he could hardly be¬ 
lieve his senses. 

His frigate captured by a vagabond Yankee pirate 1 

He pinched himself to see if he was awake. 

“Now- go to that port, opening on the deck, and order 
your watch below. Quick, or I may not give you a 
chance.” 

Sir Frederick hurried to the port. 

“Order the watch below,” he said, to the officer of the 
deck. 

“Order them below, sir ?” echoed that functionary, sur 
prised out of his usual unquestioning obedience. 

Jones’ pistol pressed the cold rim of its barrel at the 
nape of the old baronet’s neck. - 

“I said order them below, sir,” he repeated, with great 
alacrity. 

The officer gave the order. 

No sooner had the last man disappeared down the fore¬ 
castle than one of the crew of the Pallas made fast the 
hatch and imprisoned them, -while Dale, presenting a pis 
tol to the amazed officer’s head, said he would trouble 
him for his weapons. 

There was a glint in the eye of the first luff of the 
Pallas that the Britisher knew meant “obey,” and he 
gave up his sword and pistol like a lamb. 

The other officers were soon overpowered, and then 
Jones ordered a boat provisioned and lowered. 

One by one the indignant British officers were lowered 
into it and a knife given them to cut their bonds with. 

Sir Frederick was the last to go. 

If he could have spoken, much new profanity would 


have been added to the language of the sea, but words 
failed him and he merely looked as if he were about to 
suffer a fit of apoplexy. ' 

As soon as the boat had received her load of brass- 
buttoned and gold-laced Britishers, the yards of the frig¬ 
ate were swung round and she slowly gathered way; 
followed by the Pallas and the Concord. 

As the cloths filled, old Cuff stepped nimbly aft and, 
drawing from his blouse the flag Jones always used, the 
sign of the coiled rattlesnake, he bent it on the halyards. 

As it broke out at the peak, the other two Yankee ships 
fired a deafening salute and the cheers of the sailors rent 
the air. 

What the boatful of British officers felt as they slowly 
drifted astern, it would be difficult to portray. 

They stood up in the boat as fast as they severed their 
bonds and shook their fists, with vehement language, at 
Jones and the craft they had lately officered. 

Jones mounted on the poop rail, waved his hat in vale¬ 
diction as the Bellona heeled to the freshening wind. 

“Don’t excite yourselves, gentlemen,” he cried, “you 
will soon fall in with some ship to rescue you, and, in the 
meantime, think over the American Navy and what it 
stands for.” 

By sunset the boat was a speck on the horizon and the 
three Yankee ships, for the Bellona was now rated as an 
American craft, were bowling along for the friendly shores 
of France. 

They picked up the coast early the next morning and, 
by night, found themselves off Vigo Bay. 

This was a great deal further south than Jones had 
meant to come, but the wind had blown them off their 
course. 

During the night, however, the wind grew stiffer, and 
by dawn it was blowing great guns. 

The Yankee captain decided to run for the coast and 
try and slip into some shelter. 

A survey of the chart showed them that there was a 
good anchorage to be found in the little harbor of St. 
Vincent, and accordingly they ran for it. 

Off the coast of St. Vincent there stretches a long, 
natural breakwater of shoal sand, but there is a good

channel, and Jones' fleet got through and into the smooth 
water beyond in safety. 

They lay at the mouth of a river which flowed past the 
little town and, in order to be out of the reach of prying 
British ships, Jones decided to take his ships well up into 
the estuary. 

They laid here two days, till the gale blew itself out, 
and then decided to refit the Pallas , whose mainmast 
was badly sprung, before putting to sea again. 

During their stay in the port the men amused them¬ 
selves ashore in the quaint streets of the old-fashioned 
town. 

Jimmy was frequently ashore with the others, and 
found much to interest him in the place. 

To get from the wharf to the main part of the little 
town, it was necessary to take a narrow and ill-lighted 
street that was an ideal place for villainy of all kinds. 

One night when Jimmy was passing through this, on 
his way back to the boats, he heard the scream of a 
woman from one of the dark alleys that branched off. 

The lad was not a moment in making up his mind to 
go to her assistance. 

Pistol in hand, he raced up the dark passage from 
whence the cry had sounded. 

In the light which streamed from the half-open door 
of a low wine shop, he saw a young, and apparently 
beautiful, woman struggling in the arms of four or five 
huge ruffians of the worst type. 

They were evidently trying to abduct her, but in that 
low quarter of the town the scresgns of women and the 
groans of the assassinated were such common sounds 
after nightfall that no particular attention was paid to 
either one or the other. 

The young American hurled himself like a thunderbolt 
into the midst of the ruffians. 

One of them clutched him by the throat, but his pistol 
spoke and the man fell back dead. 

His fist shot out and landed full in the face of one of 
the others. 

The other two, after a few blows, took to their heels 
and Jimmy found himself alone with the girl he had 
rescued. 


She was a magnificent creature of the darkest type of 
brunette, and was evidently .not muck more than seven¬ 
teen. ..' ••'''• • • 

Her full figure, however, was that of a woman, and 
there was a light in her eyes, and a look on her face, as 
she held it up to her rescuer in the flickering light of the 
wine shop, that told Jimmy, although he was not a boy 
who had seen much of the seamy side of life, that she 
had seen and knew things that a girl of her years should 
not. 

The girl looked up at the broad-shouldered youth with 
his healthy, sea-tanned face with a look of more than 
mere gratitude in her dark eyes. 

It seemed to Jimmy, too, that she held his hand rather 
longer than was essential to mere thankfulness. 

“How brave you are, Senor Americano,” she whispered, 
attempting to lay her head on his shoulder, although the 
boy drew back. “I know you are an Americano, for I 
have often watched you as you came from the ships in 
the river.” 

Jimmy felt his cheeks bum at the girl’s almost open 
words of love. 

“It was nothing,” he said, gently removing the girl’s 
hand from his arm; “it is the custom of my countrymen 
to go to the assistance of any woman who is in distress.” 

“Ah, but they are all not as brave as you, senor,” the 
girl whispered, once more patting his arm with her soft 
fingers. 

“Oh, yes they are,” said Jimmy, smiling at the girl’s 
open admiration; “and now, if you like, I will escort you 
to your home, as soon as you are ready, for it is time I 
returned to the ship.” 

The girl threw back her head and laughed as she gazed 
at the frank face of the young sailor. 

“You think that I am not safe, senor?” 

“I don’t think the streets are the place for a girl like 
you at this time of night,” said Jimmy. 

"Mats il est drole! Know you not, my little senor, of 
La Belle Francesca? 

“No,” replied Jimmy, truthfully enough. 

The girl once more threw back her head, showing her 
full, white throat. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


Then she struck an attitude. 

“C’est moil My little boy, I am the belle Francesca! 
The Spanish dancer, and I like you!” 

CHAPTER IX. 

LA BELLE FRANCESCA. 

To say that Jimmy was taken by surprise at this avowal 
on the part of the beautiful creature, half Spanish and 
half French, with the wild beauty of both races, would 
be to put it mildly. 

He was about to speak when, before he uttered a word 
of protest, the girl had slipped her warm, bare arms about 
his neck and pressed her lips to his. 

Before he could protest, a rasping voice cut through 
the night behind him. 

“Upon my word, a very pretty tableau; I am sorry to 
have to spoil it—thus!” 

The swish of a heavy knife sounded in Jimmy's ear 
as the man who had witnessed the involuntary embrace 
he had received aimed a vicious blow at him. 

Jimmy caught the arm of his would-be assassin, as it 
hurtled down, and bent it back till the wrist bones cracked. 

The man, with a howl of pain, dropped the knife, which 
Jimmy contemptuously chucked over an adjacent wall. 

“So, Francesca! this is the way you repay my trust in 
you!” hissed the newcomer, who was a sinister-looking 
fellow, muffled in a long, dark cloak. 

“Oh, it is you, is it? Spy!” replied the girl, her head 
thrown defiantly back and her eyes flaming with rage as 
she regarded the other. 

“Yes, it is I who have—thank the saints—caught you 
in your perfidy; but enough of this. Senor Americano, 
good-night. The next time we meet, I may have the 
upper hand. As for you, you hussy, come with me." 

The young American hesitated at leaving the girl, who • 
ever she might be, alone with such a ruffian as the man 
had shown himself; but, as she saw his hesitancy -.nd 
divined its cause, she broke into her wild laugh and ex 
claimed* 

“Have no fear for me, senor, I can twist this gentleman 
round my little finger.” 


2 3 

This was all the assurance Jimmy wanted and, with a 
bow, he took his way to the wharf. 

As soon as the sound of his footsteps had passed out 
of hearing, the man turned to the girl with a grating 
voice, asked her how she had come to meet the American, 
and what she meant by kissing him. 

For answer the girl bestowed fully as warm an embrace 
on the would-be murderer of the young American as she 
had on her rescuer himself. 

“Don't be an old silly,” she said, reaching up and pat¬ 
ting his cheek, “the young fellow saved me from a band 
of ruffians, and I did but reward him.” 

“Hum,” was the muttered reply, “you had better keep 
such rewards for those who know you better. So the 
American was from the ship of Paul Jones?” he asked, 
with a sudden change of the subject. 

“Yes, but why do you ask ?” 

“Because, listen, Francesca —because there is much to 
be made out of this American sailor. The English call 
him a pirate, the Americans a patriot. I care not which 
he is. But, as you know, I have lost heavily at your 
father’s gaming tables of late, and I must recoup my 
losses.” 

“Yes, you have said all this a thousand times before; 
what is your new plan ?” 

“Do not mock me. but listen. You know, or perhaps 
you do not, that the British admiral, on behalf of his gov 
emment, has offered a large reward for information that^ 
will lead to the capture of the bold Yankee they fear.” 

“You mean that you will give the information?” 

“Yes, and then, when I am rich, you will marry me.” 

“And become the wife of a traitor. You forget that 
this country is an ally of the United States.” 

“That matters little. I hate these cursed Yankees. They 
have beaten me at everything, and now they are trying 
to beat me at love. Curse them! but I know a way to rid 
myself of them, and to-night I will take the lugger and 
tell the British admiral where he can lay his finger on 
Master Paul Jones and the rest of the Yankee pigs.” 

“Impossible! Besides, the British fleet is nowhere near 
here.” 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


“It is nearer than you think. They were oft* St. Malo 
last week, and were cruising south. They do say that a 
sloop-of-war that Jones escaped from in mid-Atlantic is 
the instigator of the chase.” 

“You are determined to go, then?” 

“Yes, I must have this money, come what may.” 

The girl shrugged her shoulders at his words and they 
parted, she taking the street that led to her house; he to 
the wharf. 

******* 

The first rays of the dawn were gilding the bay when a 
fishing lugger shot from the harbor and, tumbling heavily 
in the roll of the big waves outside, headed for the open 
sea. 

In her sat the man of the cloak. 

He was accompanied by two other men to attend to the 
handling of the lugger. 

The little vessel was a speedy craft, and at sunset, that 
night, she was in view of the British fleet. 

It was almost midnight, however, before they laid to, 
alongside a tall three-decker. 

As soon as it was light, the citizen of Saint Vincent’s 
demanded an interview with the admiral. 

The sentry at the top of the gangway frowned at him 
when he made the request; but, when he added that it 
concerned Paul Jones, he was speedily conducted aft. 

4 He found the admiral engaged at breakfast; but the 
great man was not too busy to draw back his chair and 
ask him to tell his story. 

As the man concluded his narrative, the old admiral 
looked at an officer across the table from him. 

“Well, Grimstone,” he said, “it looks this time as if 
we really have our man bottled. Now you will be able to 
revenge that trussing he gave you.” 

The other colored furiously. 

The fleet had heard of his adventure with Jones, and a 
smile went round the cabin at the admiral’s allusion to it. 

“I trust we shall meet him, sir,” Grimstone contented 
himself with saying; “he and I have an old score to 
settle.” 


“Let the fleet make sail at once,” said the admiral, when 
the amusement had subsided. “They will follow my ship, 
and this fellow here shall act as pilot.” 

The lover of Francesca made some show of demurring 
to this. 

“And if you try to play us false, or if I even suspect 
you of double dealing, I will have you shot like a dog,” 
added the admiral, as the fellow turned gray with terror 
at the prospect. 

In.another hour the fleet was under way, with every 
man on board confident that, at last, they had trapped 
the tiger of the Atlantic. 


CHAPTER X. 

JONES IN A TRAP. 

Francesca lost no time the next morning in going to the 
wharf and getting a boatman to row her out to the Pallas. 

She found everything in a state of confusion on board 
the smart, little craft. 

She knew very little English, and therefore had some 
difficulty in finding Jimmy ; but at last she recognized him 
and flew to his side, while the men winked knowingly at 
one another. 

Poor Jimmy was much embarrassed at the caresses of 
the beautiful creature, publicly bestowed as they were, 
and lost no time in conducting her to the main cabin, 
where he introduced her to Jones, for she had explained 
to him that she had important news of the greatest in¬ 
terest to the American commander. 

She prefaced her remarks by telling the commander that 
what she did was only done for Jimmy’s sake, which al¬ 
most made that modest youth flee the cabin. 

She then related all that her lover had said and threat¬ 
ened, and added that he had left the harbor that morning. 

“That must have been his lugger we saw, Jimmy ?” 
said Jones. 

“I only wish we had known who was in it, and what 
he was after,” said the ensign, ruefully, “and we could 
have kept our whereabouts a secret till we had that hew 
mast stepped.” 

“How long will it take to finish the work ?” 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


“We cannot get it done till after dark to-night.” 

Jones stamped his foot impatiently. 

“That means that we are to be bottled up here till the 
British please to dash in and annihilate us.” 

“Unless we choose to dash out first.” 

“Ah, that is the plan. You have the mast ready on 
time, Jimmy, and we will try and give them the slip once 
more.” 

As Francesca was rowed back to the shore, she stood 
up and kissed her hand to Jimmy till, to his great relief, 
her boat reached the wharf. 

Jones and Dale took a walk out to the hills above the 
town that afternoon, and spent the time watching the sea 
with the ship’s telescope. It was getting dusk when, after 
a prolonged scrutiny, Jones handed the glass to Dale. 

“You take a look, Dale; there, to the northwest, and 
tell me what you think of them.” 

The first lieutenant gazed for some seconds at the point 
of the horizon his commander had indicated. 

“It is the British, all right,” he said. 

“"What do you make their force, Dale?” 

“As far as I can see, three ships of the line and some 
smaller fry.” 

“That’s what I make them. Well, we don’t need to 
worry about the little fellows, but the big chaps will give 
us a tussle unless we can slip past them.” 

“You think we can outsail them?” . 

“I am sure of it, the Bellona —by the way, we must find 
a new name for her—is one of the fastest ships I ever 
trod the deck of, and the other two can outsail any of 
these clumsy three-deckers.” 

They retraced their way to the ships, and found that 
the work of refitting had made giant strides during the 
afternoon under the influence of the news that the British 
fleet was coming. 

The English prisoners had all been put to work, and 
as they toiled there was a look in their eyes that showed 
that they confidently believed that.by nightfall they would 
all be back on their old ships once more. 

Jones-paid another visit to the lookout hill after dark 
had fallen, and had the satisfaction of observing the riding 
lights of the British at the mouth of the river. 


“They are waiting for us, as a spider waits for the fly 
she knows she has in her power,” he thought. “Well, we 
shall see if the fly may not get out this time. I wish, 
though,” he mentally added, “we could get hold of that 
fellow who went out in a lugger. I think we could inter¬ 
est him for a time.” 

When he once more boarded his ship, he ordered out 
his cutter. 

“You are going to reconnoiter ?” asked Dale. 

“Yes; I have a fancy to see the Britishers at close 
range. In this light they will think that we are fishermen.” 

The boat flew down the river, urged by the powerful 
strokes of the men. 

Not far from where Jones’ little squadron was anchored 
was an old schooner lying on the mud. 

To Dale’s surprise the young commander seemed to 
take the greatest interest in this venerable craft. 

He ordered the boat pulled alongside of her. 

“She will float at high tide,” he observed to Dale. 

“So I noticed to-day, sir, but what of it ?” 

“It will save the trouble of towing her off.” 

“What, you want her ?” 

“I do.” 

“What do you expect to do with her?” 

“Get out of this trap,” was Jones’ reply, given with a 
quizzical look. 

Dale, however, seemed so tortured by curiosity that the 
young commodore leaned over and whispered something 
to him, so that the men who were pulling the boat could 
not hear. 

Dale seemed to be greatly pleased at his commander’s 
communication and slapped his knee, as he exclaimed: 

“Capital! The very thing.” 

They spent some time at the mouth of the river, lying 
in near the bank where they were certain of not being 
observed, and watching the lights flitting over the water 
as the ships’ boats pulled from one vessel of the fleet to 
another. 

They found that the observation of the number of ships 
in the squadron they had made from the hill was correct. 

“Hello,” said Jones, suddenly pointing to a small sloops- 
of-war that lay moored dose inshore, “that fellow has a 



26 


PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


familiar look to me. By Jove, it’s the Harpy! Dale, 
don’t you recognize your old friend?” 

Dale looked at the vessel. 

There was no doubt of it. 

It was the ship from which they had escaped. 

“This is Capt. Grimstone’s chance to get even with me 
for spoiling his hanging,” remarked Jones, with a laugh, 
as they pulled back to the Pallas. 

“May Heaven grant that we disappoint them all once 
more,” said Dale. 


CHAPTER XI. 

THE TIGER AT BAY. 

The rest of the time till midnight was spent by the 
Yankees in transferring bags of some substance, which 
they handled with the greatest care, and barrels of tar 
and pieces of canvas, to the abandoned schooner. 

Tn fact, by the time the tide began to turn, they had 
Stowed away a regular cargo on her. 

At midnight the tide was high, and the schooner, which 
had been fitted with sails and been painted up till she 
looked like a war ship, began to glide slowly down the 
river. 

But one man stood on her decks. 

The night was too dark to reveal his features, but he 
evidently was under no apprehensions of the British, for 
he lolled at the wheel, as the ship slid along, with as much 
nonchalance as if he had been steering a load of garden 
stuff to market, instead of piloting a ship down a river, 
the. mouth of which was policed by the British patrol 
fleet 

A keen observer would have noticed, however, that he 
did not as was the custom among sailors, smoke any¬ 
thing. 

Instead he hummed a tune of old Virginia, and the 
water, lapping against the dingy sides of the rickety old 
craft he steered, was the accompaniment. 

Close behind the refitted schooner crept the Pallas, and 
the CoHcord, and the big Bellow. 

The former was slightly in the lead. 

As the man on the schooner came within sight of the 


British vessels, he dropped his nonchalant air and ran 
swiftly forward to the stem of his old craft. 

He disappeared down the forescuttle, from which a 
faint glow was presently visible. 

The next moment he reappeared and, running swiftly 
to the stern, plunged overboard. 

He swam to the Bellona, whose sails had been noise¬ 
lessly lowered through greased falls, and clambered on 
board by the main chains. 

“Thank God! you are back safe, captain,” exclaimed 
Dale, as he wrung the hand of his commander, for the 
man who had piloted the mysterious schooner down the 
river was none other than Paul Jones, the man the British 
had dubbed the “Tiger of the Atlantic.” 

“Thank you, Dale,” he said, as he shook the water out 
of his clothes, “and now to put the second part of our 
plot into execution.” 

■s 

As he spoke there was a burst of flame from the bow 
of the schooner and the loud report of a gun. 

“How did you arrange the lanyard of the gun ?” asked 
Dale, in amazement, at the firing of the gun from the 
now deserted schooner. ) 

“By tying a piece of rope yarn to the lanyard and tQ 
the rope attaching a piece of rock and throwing the whole 
thing over the side. When the rock, in trailing along the 
bottom, struck a submerged obstacle, it jerked the lanyard 
and fired the gun.”« 

The report of the cannon had set the British fleet in an 
uproar. 

The will-o’-the-wisp-like Sittings of battle lanterns 
about their decks showed the active preparations they 
were making to meet Paul Jones, for they did not doubt 
that the schooner was one of his fleet. 

In the meantime the craft that had caused all the ex¬ 
citement drifted silently on until she was almost abreast 
of the big three-deckers. 

Then she was seen to change her course and run right 
in between two of them, because of the peculiarities of 
the tide. 

The Britishers were taken aback by such boldness, but 
they saluted her with a broadside that seemed as if it 
would blow her out of the water. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


27 


She kept right on, however, and, before the two bulky 
ships could get way on them, they had locked yards with 
her. ; 

At the same moment a tongue of livid flame crept from 
her hold and licked hungrily at the masts. 

Then the truth burst on the British. 

They were locked inextricably with a fireship. 

Hardly a second elapsed from the time the first bluish 
flame had crept from the hold, full of tar and oil the fire¬ 
ship carried, before great, yellow sheets of fire were shoot¬ 
ing high into the air. 

The British fought like demons to shove off from their 
deadly foe, but their spars were already on fire and the 
men were leaping overboard in wild terror. 

Higher and higher shot the flames, and the roar of the 
fierce volcano could be heard as far as the town. 

The glare lit up the sea as by day, and in the midst 
of the panic that had fallen on the British, the sea eagle 
made his swoop. 

Out from the mouth of th^ river dashed his three ves¬ 
sels! 

Before the British knew what was happening, they were 
upon them and hurling their deadly iron rain right and 
left. 

Suddenly a terrific explosion rent the air. 

The fire on the schooner had reached the powder bags, 
with which her hold was partly filled, and she had blown 
up. 

The explosion sent a perfect rain of flaming embers 
and red-hot bolts over the rest of the vessels. 

Jones’ ships were undamaged, for, before going into 
action, the sails and spars had been thoroughly wetted 
down to avoid their catching fire from the blazing rain. 

It was far otherwise with the British however. 

Their ships caught on fire in a dozen places at once, 
and their crews had to leave the guns to fight the flames 
that threatened to destroy them. 

In the thick of the inferno of flames, and noise, and 
smoke, one of the great three-deckers, the one that had 
bepn undamaged, drifted down on Jones’ ship, and opened 
a grueling fire on her. 

On the other side was Jones’ old enemy, the Harpy. 


He had never been in a worse position. 

From both sides the iron hail was hurled into his ship, 
till it seemed she must be torn apart. 

The night was lit up by the wild light of the burning 
ships and never did battlefield more resemble the infernal 
regions than did the scene about the three vessels that 
lay locked together and fighting hand-to-hand. 

Men stripped to the waist and stained with blood and 
powder manned the guns with a frenzy bom of the des¬ 
perate nature of the fight. 

From time to time a man fell at his gun, with the 
rammer in his hand, and, in a moment, another would 
have snatched it up and prodded the charge home. 

The decks were slippery with blood and dim with 
smoke. 

The acrid reek of burned powder was thick over 
everything and the smoke from the burning ships dimmed 
men’s eyes and choked their throats. 

In the midst of this inferno, while the cannon belched 
their deadly contents, a chance bullet shot down the 
Coiled Rattlesnake flag of America from the peak of the 
Bellona. 

It was Paul Jones himself who snatched up the fallen 
flag, and, springing into the shrouds, amid a hailstorm of 
bullets, fastened it once more to the halyards and ran it 
aloft. 

A cheer broke from the tired men at the guns as they 
witnessed the heroic deed of their young leader. 

The sight of the gallant flag once more waving, amid 
the thick-hanging smoke, lent the Yankees fresh courage. 

Cheering, they beat back the boarders from the three- 
decker and, led by Jones, advanced to drive back the 
horde of British blue-jackets that were pouring over the 
Yankee’s side from the Harpy. 

Jones himself, sword in hand, led the men on. 

With a cheer they fell on their enemies, who gave way 
without more ado. 

Their leader alone, a gray-haired man, stood his 
ground. • 

‘‘Do you know me, sir?” he demanded, forcing his way 
to Jones. 

The American instantly recognized him. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


28 

It was Capt Grimstone. 

He rushed at Jones with a furious lunge of his sword, 
but the young sea eagle had no difficulty in parrying the 
thrust. 

After a few passes the Englishman was disarmed and 
at Jones’ mercy. 

His sword lay on the deck, where Jones skillful twist 
had sent it. 

The old man gazed sorrowfully at Jones for a moment, 
then he turned his eyes on his ship. 

The American flag now fluttered there in place of the 
British ensign. 

The same sight met his eye when he turned it on the 
three-decker. 

“You have bested us fairly, sir,” he said, in a broken 
voice, stooping to pick up his sword; "take the blade of 
a heartbroken man and your prisoner.” 

Jones returned the sword with a chivalrous bow. 

"I will not deprive of his sword a man who knows so 
well how to use it,” he said, with a touch of the charm 
of manner that so endeared him to all. 

“Hurray!” shouted Bill Cuff, at this moment, “the 
British have struck their colors to the Pallas and the Con¬ 
cord, and we’ve won the battle!” 

Wild cheers rose on every side at the announcement. 

Jones held up his hand to check the noisy rejoicing. 

“Hush, boys!” he said, “remember that there are brave 
men dying all about us.” 


CHAPTER XII. 

A LAST BIT OF TREACHERY. 

After a short time had been spent in putting the ves- 
sels in trim for the long voyage to America, Jones de¬ 
cided to pay a brief visit to Paris and make a report of the 
battle to Benjamin Franklin, the American minister. 

Accordingly, with Jimmy and Dale, he set out for 
the French capital about a week after the events de¬ 
scribed in the last'chapter. 

After a hard day’s ride, they pulled up on the first 
night of their journey at a little roadside inn. 

The landlord seemed a surly fellow and did no* appear 


to be any the more willing when Sdpio, who with Cato 
had been rescued from the Harpy by Jones, told him 
that his guest was none other than the famous Paul 
Jones. 

He appeared, however, to take the greatest interest 
in his guest’s movements after he knew who the dash¬ 
ing young traveler was. 

They retired early, for they were much fatigued with 
the hard ride of the day. . * 

It was about midnight when Jones was awakened by 
a slight sound in his room. 

There was a bright moon shining through the win¬ 
dow, and by its light he saw a face intently regarding 
him through the aperture. 

He recognized it as that of the surly landlord. 

The fellow disappeared almost as soon as Jones had 
discovered him. 

He was not gone long, however, for he reappeared in 
a few minutes. 

He put one leg over the sill and climbed silently as 
a cat into the room. 

Jones saw that he held in his hand a gleaming knife. 

He crept cautiously toward the bed, holding his 
weapon partly concealed. 

Jones was unarmed, for he had left his weapons down¬ 
stairs. 

He decided in a flash to pretend to be asleep and seize 
the man when he should have actually reached the bed¬ 
side. * 

The fellow crept on his tiptoes across the room. 

In a few seconds more he was at Jones’ side. 

The American snored loudly in his effort to make the 
man think he was really asleep. 

The rascal seemed to be in no hurry, for before he 
made any other move, he went through the pockets of 
Jones’ clothes and removed his wallet. 

The American saw his opportunity and pounced on the 
fellow as he leaned over his clothes. 1 

Jones had the agility of a cat, and his leap brought 
him on the fellow’s back. 

The man was too thoroughly taken by surprise to of¬ 
fer much resistance. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY.

In another moment Jones had wrested his knife from 
him and had thrown it out of the window. 

“Mercy, mercy!” implored the man. 

His eyes were almost starting out of his head in the 
extremity of his terror. 

“I swear. I only intended to rob you!” exclaimed the 
innkeeper. 

“And’kill me, if I resisted, I suppose?” 

The man did not reply. 

Jones was filled with unutterable loathing for the man 
who would have murdered him, and at least intended to 
rob him. 

“Go!” he said, in tones of disgust; “for such a man as 
you I have nothing but contempt! You arc safe from my 
swprd, or any harm from me. for such a wretch as you 
works out his own punishment.” 

The man rose to his feet as Jones released him, and 
stood before him as abject a figure as could be imagined. 

He looked the miserable sneak that he was. 

. “Capt. Jones,” he said, holding down his head, “I will 
repay your kindness by giving you warning of a great 
danger that threatens you on the road to Paris.” 

“A great danger that threatens me?” repeated Jones. 
“Man, you cannot frighten me with such a tale as that!” 

“It is true, I swear it!” was the reply. 

The man’s manner impressed Jones, although hi still 
suspected that the other was lying. 

“Well, go .on,” he said. 

“When you broke up the British fleet, you did not take 
all of the Englishmen prisoners,” was the reply. 

“No; that is true: several of them escaped under cover 
of the battle smoke, and reached the shore.” 

“You are right. They were here last night, and with 
them was a man of St. Vincent, a dark man; you know 
him?” 

“Perhaps; go on.” 

“He had evidently news of importance, for he rode up 
shortly after they arrived, and they at once asked for a 
private room.” 

“Yes.” 

“Well, they remained in there some time, and I—well, 

J considered it my duty to know what was going on, and 


J listened at the door to their conversation. The man 
told them of your proposed visit to Paris, and the road 
you would take." 

“It is true that anyone in St. Vincent might have 
known of that, for ‘it was no secret.” 

“It would have been better for you, Paul Jones, had 
it been. They decided to waylay you in this inn to-night 
and kill you for the reward the British Government has 
offered for you, alive or dead." 

The man’s manner would not permit Jones to longer 
doubt him. 

It bore every evidence of sincerity. 

Suddenly the fellow listened intently. 

“Hark!" he exclaimed. 

Jones cocked his ear "and listened. 

The night was very still, and the silence was only 
broken at intervals by the bark of some distant dog. 

As they listened, neither of them scarcely breathing, 
another sound was borne to their ears. 

It was the galloping of fast-approaching horses. 

There seemed to be quite a number of them. 

Nearer and nearer they came. 

“It is your would-be assassins!” exclaimed the inn¬ 
keeper, with blanched cheeks. 

“There is no time to be lost, then,” said Jones; “how 
many of them are there?” 

“Twenty, at least. They are well armed, too.” 

“You have pistols?” 

“Yes, two.” 

“Good! Now, go and call the others.” 

In a few seconds Dale and Jimmy, with Cato and 
Scipio, who were as badly frightened as on the day of the 
battle with the Vengeance, were in the room. 

The landlord had told them the reason of the midnight 
summons, so that there was no necessity for wasting time 
in asking questions. 

The landlord had also brought Jones’ pistol and sword. 

Jones clapped the weapon to the fellow’s head. 

“You will get your two pistols and use them, too, or I 
will reconsider the matter of a few moments ago, and 
scatter your rascally brains!” 

The fellow shivered, for fighting was not much to His

liking, yet he saw no way out of the dilemma but to 
comply. 

The horsemen had nearly reached the inn, the doors 
of which had been barricaded in expectation of their 
coming. 

Jones went to the window as they rode up, and in the 
bright moonlight saw that the landlord had not lied about 
their numbers. 

There were at least twenty of them. 

The silvery light shone on the steel of swords and 
pistols. 

Jones could not help smiling as he saw the great prepa¬ 
rations that had been made for his capture. 

The leader of the troop looked up. 

Jimmy gasped as he saw the face of their leader, for 
it was that of the man who had attacked him in the slums 
of St. Vincent 

The next moment they were thundering at the door. 

“What do you want?” asked Jones, leaning, pistol in 
hand, from the window'. 

“Paul Jones,” was the reply of the rascal from St. 
Vincent. 

“Well, here he is, and here is what he has to say to 
you!” replied the young American, as he discharged his 
pistol at the fellow’s head. 

The bullet sped true, and the man threw up his hands 
and tumbled from his horse, with a groan. 

_ This was the signal for a perfect fusillade of bullets 
on the part of the British, but it did riot do them much 
good, for Jones had withdrawn from* the window as soon 
as he fired. 

“Those fellows have exhausted all their weapons!” he 
exclaimed; “now is our time to fire, while they are re¬ 
loading !” 

The defenders of the inn, poured in a volley, and had 
the satisfaction of winging several of the men outside. 

This seemed to cool the ardor of the besiegers, and 
they withdrew. ■ 

They held a brief consultation, and then one of them 
went to the bam, and returned with several armfuls of 
bay, which they piled against the door. 

What could they be going to do ? 


They were not left long in doubt. 

Their next move was to produce a flint and steel. 

Like a flash, their fiendish intention broke on Jones. 

They meant to burn the place. 

They were too close in. to the wall for the besieged 
men to be able to shoot at them. And yet to let them 
fire the inn meant death. 

“We must make a dash for it!” exclaimed Jones. 

Led by the gallant young American, they dashed down 
the stairs to the door. 

Jones flung it open, and the next moment they were in 
the midst of their enemies. 

The British were taken completely by surprise. 

Jones’ sword had never done better work. 

»In a few minutes the Englishmen were put to flight, 
and Cato and Scipio crawled out of the garret, where 
they had been hidden. 

The landlord was the only one injured. 

Jones saw at once that his wound was mortal. 

The dying man gasped out to the American that he 
wanted to say something to him ere he breathed his last 

Jones leaned over him, to catch his words. 

“Forgive me!” he gasped, and, ere Jones could reply, 
fell back with a gasp—dead. 

There is little more to tell 

Louis conferred upon Jones, when he heard of his 
achievements off St. Vincent, the much-coveted Cross of 
the Legion of Honor, and Mr. Franklin was able to 
promise him more ships for his little navy, in whose up¬ 
building he found his life work. 

Of his return to America, and the honors that awaited 
him there, this is not the place to tell. 

That he was a nation’s hero, though, our readers will 
not doubt. 

He did not remain long on shore, however, but soon 
engaged in another hazardous undertaking. 

What this was, and with what wonderful nerve and 
dash he accomplished it, will be told in the next issue of 
this weekly, No. 4, entitled “Paul Jones’ Bold Swoop; or, 
Cutting Out a British Supply Ship.” 

THE END.
