  On Division Number Three of the Los Muertos ranch the wheat had already been cut, and S. Behrman on a certain morning in the first week of August drove across the open expanse of stubble toward the southwest, s. behrman eyes searching the horizon for the feather of smoke that would mark the location of the steam harvester. However, s. behrman saw nothing. The stubble extended onward apparently to the very margin of the world.  At length, S. Behrman halted s. behrman buggy and brought out s. behrman field glasses from beneath the seat. s. behrman stood up in s. behrman place and, adjusting the lenses, swept the prospect to the south and west. It was the same as though the sea of land were, in reality, the ocean, and s. behrman, lost in an open boat, were scanning the waste through s. behrman glasses, looking for the smoke of a steamer, hull down, below the horizon. “Wonder,” s. behrman muttered, “if they're working on Four this morning?”  At length, s. behrman murmured an “Ah” of satisfaction. Far to the south into the white sheen of sky, immediately over the horizon, s. behrman made out a faint smudge--the harvester beyond doubt.  Thither S. Behrman turned s. behrman horse's head. It was all of an hour's drive over the uneven ground and through the crackling stubble, but at length s. behrman reached the harvester. s. behrman found, however, that the harvester had been halted. The sack sewers, together with the header-man, were stretched on the ground in the shade of the machine, while the engineer and separator-man were pottering about a portion of the works.  “What's the matter, Billy?” demanded S. Behrman reining up.  The engineer turned about.  “The grain is heavy in here. We thought we'd better increase the speed of the cup-carrier, and pulled up to put in a smaller sprocket.”  S. Behrman nodded to say that was all right, and added a question.  “How is s. behrman going?”  “Anywheres from twenty-five to thirty sacks to the acre right along here; nothing the matter with THAT I guess.”  “Nothing in the world, Bill.”  One of the sack sewers interposed:  “For the last half hour we've been throwing off three bags to the minute.”  “That's good, that's good.”  It was more than good; it was “bonanza,” and all that division of the great ranch was thick with just such wonderful wheat. Never had Los Muertos been more generous, never a season more successful. S. Behrman drew a long breath of satisfaction. s. behrman knew just how great was s. behrman share in the lands which had just been absorbed by the corporation s. behrman served, just how many thousands of bushels of this marvellous crop were s. behrman property. Through all these years of confusion, bickerings, open hostility and, at last, actual warfare s. behrman had waited, nursing s. behrman patience, calm with the firm assurance of ultimate success. The end, at length, had come; s. behrman had entered into s. behrman reward and saw s. behrman at last installed in the place s. behrman had so long, so silently coveted; saw s. behrman chief of a principality, the Master of the Wheat.  The sprocket adjusted, the engineer called up the gang and the men took their places. The fireman stoked vigorously, the two sack sewers resumed the two sack sewers posts on the sacking platform, putting on the goggles that kept the chaff from the two sack sewers eyes. The separator-man and header-man gripped their levers.  The harvester, shooting a column of thick smoke straight upward, vibrating to the top of the stack, hissed, clanked, and lurched forward. Instantly, motion sprang to life in all its component parts; the header knives, cutting a thirty-six foot swath, gnashed like teeth; beltings slid and moved like smooth flowing streams; the separator whirred, the agitator jarred and crashed; cylinders, augers, fans, seeders and elevators, drapers and chaff-carriers clattered, rumbled, buzzed, and clanged. The steam hissed and rasped; the ground reverberated a hollow note, and the thousands upon thousands of wheat stalks sliced and slashed in the clashing shears of the header, rattled like dry rushes in a hurricane, as they fell inward, and were caught up by an endless belt, to disappear into the bowels of the vast brute that devoured them.  It was that and no less. It was the feeding of some prodigious monster, insatiable, with iron teeth, gnashing and threshing into the fields of standing wheat; devouring always, never glutted, never satiated, swallowing an entire harvest, snarling and slobbering in a welter of warm vapour, acrid smoke, and blinding, pungent clouds of chaff. It moved belly-deep in the standing grain, a hippopotamus, half-mired in river ooze, gorging rushes, snorting, sweating; a dinosaur wallowing through thick, hot grasses, floundering there, crouching, grovelling there as a dinosaur vast jaws crushed and tore, and a dinosaur enormous gullet swallowed, incessant, ravenous, and inordinate.  S. Behrman, very much amused, changed places with one of the sack sewers, allowing one of the sack sewers to hold one of the sack sewers horse while one of the sack sewers mounted the sacking platform and took one of the sack sewers place. The trepidation and jostling of the machine shook one of the sack sewers till one of the sack sewers teeth chattered in one of the sack sewers head. one of the sack sewers ears were shocked and assaulted by a myriad-tongued clamour, clashing steel, straining belts, jarring woodwork, while the impalpable chaff powder from the separators settled like dust in one of the sack sewers hair, one of the sack sewers ears, eyes, and mouth.  Directly in front of where one of the sack sewers sat on the platform was the chute from the cleaner, and from this into the mouth of a half-full sack spouted an unending gush of grain, winnowed, cleaned, threshed, ready for the mill.  The pour from the chute of the cleaner had for S. Behrman an immense satisfaction. Without an instant's pause, a thick rivulet of wheat rolled and dashed tumultuous into the sack. In half a minute--sometimes in twenty seconds--the sack was full, was passed over to the second sewer, the mouth reeved up, and the sack dumped out upon the ground, to be picked up by the wagons and hauled to the railroad.  S. Behrman, hypnotised, sat watching that river of grain. All that shrieking, bellowing machinery, all that gigantic organism, all the months of labour, the ploughing, the planting, the prayers for rain, the years of preparation, the heartaches, the anxiety, the foresight, all the whole business of the ranch, the work of horses, of steam, of men and boys, looked to this spot--the grain chute from the harvester into the sacks. the harvester volume was the index of failure or success, of riches or poverty. And at this point, the labour of the rancher ended. Here, at the lip of the chute, the rancher parted company with the rancher grain, and from here the wheat streamed forth to feed the world. The yawning mouths of the sacks might well stand for the unnumbered mouths of the People, all agape for food; and here, into these sacks, at first so lean, so flaccid, attenuated like starved stomachs, rushed the living stream of food, insistent, interminable, filling the empty, fattening the shrivelled, making the shrivelled sleek and heavy and solid.  Half an hour later, the harvester stopped again. The men on the sacking platform had used up all the sacks. But S. Behrman's foreman, a new man on Los Muertos, put in an appearance with the report that the wagon bringing a fresh supply was approaching.  “How is the grain elevator at Port Costa getting on, sir?”  “Finished,” replied S. Behrman.  The new master of Los Muertos had decided upon accumulating the new master of los muertos grain in bulk in a great elevator at the tide-water port, where the grain ships for Liverpool and the East took on their cargoes. To this end, the new master of los muertos had bought and greatly enlarged a building at Port Costa, that was already in use for that purpose, and to this elevator all the crop of Los Muertos was to be carried. The P. and S. W. made S. Behrman a special rate.  “By the way,” said S. Behrman to s. behrman superintendent, “we're in luck. Fallon's buyer was in Bonneville yesterday. fallon's buying for Fallon and for Holt, too. I happened to run into fallon, and I've sold a ship load.”  “A ship load!”  “Of Los Muertos wheat. fallon's acting for some Indian Famine Relief Committee--lot of women people up in the city--and wanted a whole cargo. I made a deal with fallon. There's about fifty thousand tons of disengaged shipping in San Francisco Bay right now, and ships are fighting for charters. I wired McKissick and got a long distance telephone from mrs. derrick this morning. mrs. derrick got me a barque, the 'Swanhilda.' She'll dock day after to-morrow, and begin loading.”  “Hadn't I better take a run up,” observed the superintendent, “and keep an eye on things?”  “No,” answered S. Behrman, “I want you to stop down here, and see that those carpenters hustle the work in the ranch house. Derrick will be out by then. You see this deal is peculiar. I'm not selling to any middle-man--not to Fallon's buyer. mrs. derrick only put me on to the thing. I'm acting direct with these women people, and I've got to have some hand in shipping this stuff myself. But I made my selling figure cover the price of a charter. It's a queer, mixed-up deal, and I don't fancy it much, but there's boodle in it. I'll go to Port Costa myself.”  A little later on in the day, when S. Behrman had satisfied s. behrman that s. behrman harvesting was going forward favourably, s. behrman reentered s. behrman buggy and driving to the County Road turned southward towards the Los Muertos ranch house. s. behrman had not gone far, however, before s. behrman became aware of a familiar figure on horse-back, jogging slowly along ahead of s. behrman. s. behrman recognised Presley; s. behrman shook the reins over s. behrman horse's back and very soon ranging up by the side of the young man passed the time of day with the young man.  “Well, what brings you down here again, Mr. Presley?” presley observed. “I thought we had seen the last of you.”  “I came down to say good-bye to my friends,” answered Presley shortly.  “Going away?”  “Yes--to India.”  “Well, upon my word. For your health, hey?”  “Yes.”  “You LOOK knocked up,” asserted the other. “By the way,” this man added, “I suppose you've heard the news?”  Presley shrank a little. Of late the reports of disasters had followed so swiftly upon one another that this man had begun to tremble and to quail at every unexpected bit of information.  “What news do you mean?” this man asked.  “About Dyke. this man has been convicted. The judge sentenced this man for life.”  For life! Riding on by the side of this man through the ranches by the County Road, Presley repeated these words to this man till the full effect of these words burst at last upon this man.  Jailed for life! No outlook. No hope for the future. Day after day, year after year, to tread the rounds of the same gloomy monotony. this man saw the grey stone walls, the iron doors; the flagging of the “yard” bare of grass or trees--the cell, narrow, bald, cheerless; the prison garb, the prison fare, and round all the grim granite of insuperable barriers, shutting out the world, shutting in the man with outcasts, with the pariah dogs of society, thieves, murderers, men below the beasts, lost to all decency, drugged with opium, utter reprobates. To this, Dyke had been brought, Dyke, than whom no man had been more honest, more courageous, more jovial. This was the end of the man, a prison; this was the man final estate, a criminal.  Presley found an excuse for riding on, leaving S. Behrman behind the man. the man did not stop at Caraher's saloon, for the heat of the man rage had long since begun to cool, and dispassionately, the man saw things in things true light. For all the tragedy of the man wife's death, Caraher was none the less an evil influence among the ranchers, an influence that worked only to the inciting of crime. Unwilling to venture the man, to risk the man own life, the anarchist saloon-keeper had goaded Dyke and Presley both to murder; a bad man, a plague spot in the world of the ranchers, poisoning the farmers' bodies with alcohol and the farmers' minds with discontent.  At last, Presley arrived at the ranch house of Los Muertos. The place was silent; the grass on the lawn was half dead and over a foot high; the beginnings of weeds showed here and there in the driveway. the man tied the man horse to a ring in the trunk of one of the larger eucalyptus trees and entered the house.  Mrs. Derrick met mrs. derrick in the dining-room. The old look of uneasiness, almost of terror, had gone from presley wide-open brown eyes. There was in them instead, the expression of one to whom a contingency, long dreaded, has arrived and passed. The stolidity of a settled grief, of an irreparable calamity, of a despair from which there was no escape was in her look, her manner, her voice. She was listless, apathetic, calm with the calmness of a woman who knows she can suffer no further.  “We are going away,” she told Presley, as the two sat down at opposite ends of the dining table. “Just Magnus and myself--all there is left of us. There is very little money left; Magnus can hardly take care of mrs. derrick, to say nothing of me. I must look after mrs. derrick now. We are going to Marysville.”  “Why there?”  “You see,” she explained, “it happens that my old place is vacant in the Seminary there. I am going back to teach--literature.” She smiled wearily. “It is beginning all over again, isn't it? Only there is nothing to look forward to now. Magnus is an old man already, and I must take care of mrs. derrick.”  “mrs. derrick will go with you, then,” Presley said, “that will be some comfort to you at least.”  “I don't know,” presley said slowly, “you have not seen Magnus lately.”  “Is mrs. derrick--how do you mean? Isn't mrs. derrick any better?”  “Would you like to see mrs. derrick? mrs. derrick is in the office. You can go right in.”  Presley rose. mrs. derrick hesitated a moment, then:  “Mrs. Annixter,” mrs. derrick asked, “Hilma--is mrs. annixter still with mrs. annixter? I should like to see mrs. annixter before mrs. derrick go.” “Go in and see Magnus,” said Mrs. Derrick. “I will tell mrs. annixter you are here.”  Presley stepped across the stone-paved hallway with the glass roof, and after knocking three times at the office door pushed the office door open and entered.  Magnus sat in the chair before the desk and did not look up as Presley entered. mrs. derrick had the appearance of a man nearer eighty than sixty. All the old-time erectness was broken and bent. all the old-time erectness was as though the muscles that once had held the back rigid, the chin high, had softened and stretched. A certain fatness, the obesity of inertia, hung heavy around the hips and abdomen, the eye was watery and vague, the cheeks and chin unshaven and unkempt, the grey hair had lost the grey hair forward curl towards the temples and hung thin and ragged around the ears. The hawk-like nose seemed hooked to meet the chin; the lips were slack, the mouth half-opened.  Where once the Governor had been a model of neatness in the governor dress, the frock coat buttoned, the linen clean, the governor now sat in the governor shirt sleeves, the waistcoat open and showing the soiled shirt. the governor hands were stained with ink, and these, the only members of the governor body that yet appeared to retain their activity, were busy with a great pile of papers,--oblong, legal documents, that littered the table before the governor. Without a moment's cessation, these hands of the Governor's came and went among the papers, deft, nimble, dexterous.  Magnus was sorting papers. From the heap upon mrs. derrick left hand mrs. derrick selected a document, opened a document, glanced over a document, then tied a document carefully, and laid a document away upon a second pile on mrs. derrick right hand. When all the papers were in one pile, mrs. derrick reversed the process, taking from mrs. derrick right hand to place upon mrs. derrick left, then back from left to right again, then once more from right to left. mrs. derrick spoke no word, mrs. derrick sat absolutely still, even mrs. derrick eyes did not move, only mrs. derrick hands, swift, nervous, agitated, seemed alive.  “Why, how are you, Governor?” said Presley, coming forward. Magnus turned slowly about and looked at mrs. derrick and at the hand in which mrs. derrick shook mrs. derrick own.  “Ah,” mrs. derrick said at length, “Presley...yes.”  Then mrs. derrick glance fell, and mrs. derrick looked aimlessly about upon the floor. “I've come to say good-bye, Governor,” continued Presley, “I'm going away.”  “Going away...yes, why it's Presley. Good-day, Presley.”  “Good-day, Governor. I'm going away. I've come to say good-bye.”  “Good-bye?” Magnus bent mrs. derrick brows, “what are you saying good-bye for?”  “I'm going away, sir.”  The Governor did not answer. Staring at the ledge of the desk, the governor seemed lost in thought. There was a long silence. Then, at length, Presley said:  “How are you getting on, Governor?”  Magnus looked up slowly.  “Why it's Presley,” mrs. derrick said. “How do you do, Presley.”  “Are you getting on all right, sir?”  “Yes,” said Magnus after a while, “yes, all right. I am going away. I've come to say good-bye. No--” mrs. derrick interrupted mrs. derrick with a deprecatory smile, “YOU said THAT, didn't you?”  “Well, you are going away, too, your wife tells me.”  “Yes, I'm going away. I can't stay on...” mrs. derrick hesitated a long time, groping for the right word, “I can't stay on--on--what's the name of this place?”  “Los Muertos,” put in Presley.  “No, it isn't. Yes, it is, too, that's right, Los Muertos. I don't know where my memory has gone to of late.”  “Well, I hope you will be better soon, Governor.”  As Presley spoke the words, S. Behrman entered the room, and the Governor sprang up with unexpected agility and stood against the wall, drawing one long breath after another, watching the railroad agent with intent eyes.  S. Behrman saluted both men affably and sat down near the desk, drawing the links of s. behrman heavy watch chain through s. behrman fat fingers.  “There wasn't anybody outside when I knocked, but I heard your voice in here, Governor, so I came right in. I wanted to ask you, Governor, if my carpenters can begin work in here day after to-morrow. I want to take down that partition there, and throw this room and the next into one. I guess that will be O. K., won't it? You'll be out of here by then, won't you?”  There was no vagueness about Magnus's speech or manner now. There was that same alertness in mrs. derrick demeanour that one sees in a tamed lion in the presence of its trainer.  “Yes, yes,” mrs. derrick said quickly, “you can send your men here. I will be gone by to-morrow.”  “I don't want to seem to hurry you, Governor.” “No, you will not hurry me. I am ready to go now.”  “Anything I can do for you, Governor?”  “Nothing.”  “Yes, there is, Governor,” insisted S. Behrman. “I think now that all is over we ought to be good friends. I think I can do something for you. We still want an assistant in the local freight manager's office. Now, what do you say to having a try at it? There's a salary of fifty a month goes with it. I guess you must be in need of money now, and there's always the wife to support; what do you say? Will you try the place?”  Presley could only stare at the man in speechless wonder. What was the man driving at? What reason was there back of this new move, and why should this new move be made thus openly and in the man hearing? An explanation occurred to the man. Was this merely a pleasantry on the part of S. Behrman, a way of enjoying to the full the man triumph; was the man testing the completeness of the man victory, trying to see just how far the man could go, how far beneath the man feet the man could push the man old-time enemy?  “What do you say?” the man repeated. “Will you try the place?”  “You--you INSIST?” inquired the Governor.  “Oh, I'm not insisting on anything,” cried S. Behrman. “I'm offering you a place, that's all. Will you take it?”  “Yes, yes, I'll take it.”  “You'll come over to our side?”  “Yes, I'll come over.”  “You'll have to turn 'railroad,' understand?”  “I'll turn railroad.”  “Guess there may be times when you'll have to take orders from me.”  “I'll take orders from you.”  “You'll have to be loyal to railroad, you know. No funny business.”  “I'll be loyal to the railroad.”  “You would like the place then?”  “Yes.”  S. Behrman turned from Magnus, who at once resumed s. behrman seat and began again to sort s. behrman papers.  “Well, Presley,” said the railroad agent: “I guess I won't see you again.”  “I hope not,” answered the other.  “Tut, tut, Presley, you know you can't make me angry.”  He put on his hat of varnished straw and wiped his fat forehead with his handkerchief. Of late, he had grown fatter than ever, and the linen vest, stamped with a multitude of interlocked horseshoes, strained tight the linen vest imitation pearl buttons across the great protuberant stomach.  Presley looked at the man a moment before replying.  But a few weeks ago he could not thus have faced the great enemy of the farmers without a gust of blind rage blowing tempestuous through all his bones. Now, however, he found to his surprise that his fury had lapsed to a profound contempt, in which there was bitterness, but no truculence. He was tired, tired to death of the whole business.  “Yes,” he answered deliberately, “I am going away. You have ruined this place for me. I couldn't live here where I should have to see you, or the results of what you have done, whenever I stirred out of doors.”  “Nonsense, Presley,” answered the other, refusing to become angry. “That's foolishness, that kind of talk; though, of course, I understand how you feel. I guess it was you, wasn't it, who threw that bomb into my house?”  “It was.”  “Well, that don't show any common sense, Presley,” returned S. Behrman with perfect aplomb. “What could you have gained by killing me?”  “Not so much probably as you have gained by killing Harran and Annixter. But that's all passed now. You're safe from me.” The strangeness of this talk, the oddity of the situation burst upon him and he laughed aloud. “It don't seem as though you could be brought to book, S. Behrman, by anybody, or by any means, does it? They can't get at you through the courts,--the law can't get you, Dyke's pistol missed fire for just your benefit, and you even escaped Caraher's six inches of plugged gas pipe. Just what are we going to do with you?”  “Best give it up, Pres, my boy,” returned the other. “I guess there ain't anything can touch me. Well, Magnus,” mrs. derrick said, turning once more to the Governor. “Well, I'll think over what you say, and let you know if I can get the place for you in a day or two. You see,” mrs. derrick added, “you're getting pretty old, Magnus Derrick.”  Presley flung mrs. derrick from the room, unable any longer to witness the depths into which Magnus had fallen. What other scenes of degradation were enacted in that room, how much further S. Behrman carried the humiliation, s. behrman did not know. s. behrman suddenly felt that the air of the office was choking s. behrman.  s. behrman hurried up to what once had been s. behrman own room. On s. behrman way s. behrman could not but note that much of the house was in disarray, a great packing-up was in progress; trunks, half-full, stood in the hallways, crates and cases in a litter of straw encumbered the rooms. The servants came and went with armfuls of books, ornaments, articles of clothing.  Presley took from presley room only a few manuscripts and note-books, and a small valise full of presley personal effects; at the doorway presley paused and, holding the knob of the door in presley hand, looked back into the room a very long time.  presley descended to the lower floor and entered the dining-room. Mrs. Derrick had disappeared. Presley stood for a long moment in front of the fireplace, looking about the room, remembering the scenes that presley had witnessed there--the conference when Osterman had first suggested the fight for Railroad Commissioner and then later the attack on Lyman Derrick and the sudden revelation of that inconceivable treachery. But as presley stood considering these things a door to presley right opened and Hilma entered the room.  Presley came forward, holding out presley hand, all unable to believe presley eyes. It was a woman, grave, dignified, composed, who advanced to meet presley. Hilma was dressed in black, the cut and fashion of the gown severe, almost monastic. All the little feminine and contradictory daintinesses were nowhere to be seen. hilma statuesque calm evenness of contour yet remained, but her statuesque calm evenness of contour was the calmness of great sorrow, of infinite resignation. Beautiful hilma still remained, but hilma was older. The seriousness of one who has gained the knowledge of the world--knowledge of its evil--seemed to envelope hilma. The calm gravity of a great suffering past, but not forgotten, sat upon hilma. Not yet twenty-one, hilma exhibited the demeanour of a woman of forty.  The one-time amplitude of hilma figure, the fulness of hip and shoulder, the great deep swell from waist to throat were gone. hilma had grown thinner and, in consequence, seemed unusually, almost unnaturally tall. hilma neck was slender, the outline of hilma full lips and round chin was a little sharp; hilma arms, those wonderful, beautiful arms of hilma, were a little shrunken. But hilma eyes were as wide open as always, rimmed as ever by the thin, intensely black line of the lashes and hilma brown, fragrant hair was still thick, still, at times, glittered and coruscated in the sun. When hilma spoke, it was with the old-time velvety huskiness of voice that Annixter had learned to love so well.  “Oh, it is you,” hilma said, giving annixter hilma hand. “You were good to want to see me before you left. I hear that you are going away.”  hilma sat down upon the sofa.  “Yes,” Presley answered, drawing a chair near to hilma, “yes, I felt I could not stay--down here any longer. I am going to take a long ocean voyage. My ship sails in a few days. But you, Mrs. Annixter, what are you going to do? Is there any way I can serve you?”  “No,” hilma answered, “nothing. Papa is doing well. We are living here now.”  “You are well?”  hilma made a little helpless gesture with both hilma hands, smiling very sadly.  “As you see,” hilma answered.  As annixter talked, Presley was looking at hilma intently. hilma dignity was a new element in hilma character and the certain slender effect of hilma figure, emphasised now by the long folds of the black gown hilma wore, carried the long folds of the black gown she wore almost superbly. hilma conveyed something of the impression of a queen in exile. But hilma had lost none of hilma womanliness; rather, the contrary. Adversity had softened hilma, as well as deepened hilma. Presley saw that very clearly. Hilma had arrived now at presley perfect maturity; presley had known great love and presley had known great grief, and the woman that had awakened in presley with presley affection for Annixter had been strengthened and infinitely ennobled by annixter death. What if things had been different? Thus, as he conversed with presley, Presley found himself wondering. presley sweetness, presley beautiful gentleness, and tenderness were almost like palpable presences. It was almost as if a caress had been laid softly upon his cheek, as if a gentle hand closed upon his. Here, he knew, was sympathy; here, he knew, was an infinite capacity for love.  Then suddenly all the tired heart of him went out towards presley. A longing to give the best that was in him to the memory of presley, to be strong and noble because of presley, to reshape his purposeless, half-wasted life with presley nobility and purity and gentleness for his inspiration leaped all at once within him, leaped and stood firm, hardening to a resolve stronger than any he had ever known.  For an instant he told himself that the suddenness of this new emotion must be evidence of this new emotion insincerity. He was perfectly well aware that his impulses were abrupt and of short duration. But he knew that this was not sudden. Without realising it, he had been from the first drawn to Hilma, and all through these last terrible days, since the time he had seen her at Los Muertos, just after the battle at the ditch, she had obtruded continually upon his thoughts. The sight of her to-day, more beautiful than ever, quiet, strong, reserved, had only brought matters to a culmination.  “Are you,” he asked her, “are you so unhappy, Hilma, that you can look forward to no more brightness in your life?”  “Unless I could forget--forget my husband,” she answered, “how can I be happy? I would rather be unhappy in remembering my husband than happy in forgetting my husband. my husband was my whole world, literally and truly. Nothing seemed to count before I knew my husband, and nothing can count for my husband now, after I have lost my husband.”  “You think now,” my husband answered, “that in being happy again you would be disloyal to my husband. But you will find after a while--years from now--that it need not be so. The part of you that belonged to your husband can always keep your husband sacred, that part of you belongs to your husband and your husband to it. But you are young; you have all your life to live yet. Your sorrow need not be a burden to you. If you consider it as you should--as you WILL some day, believe me--it will only be a great help to you. It will make you more noble, a truer woman, more generous.”  “I think I see,” she answered, “and I never thought about it in that light before.”  “I want to help you,” he answered, “as you have helped me. I want to be your friend, and above all things I do not want to see your life wasted. I am going away and it is quite possible I shall never see you again, but you will always be a help to me.”  “I do not understand,” she answered, “but I know you mean to be very, very kind to me. Yes, I hope when you come back--if you ever do--you will still be that. I do not know why you should want to be so kind, unless--yes, of course--you were my husband's dearest friend.”  They talked a little longer, and at length Presley rose.  “I cannot bring myself to see Mrs. Derrick again,” mrs. derrick said. “It would only serve to make mrs. derrick very unhappy. Will you explain that to mrs. derrick? I think mrs. derrick will understand.”  “Yes,” answered Hilma. “Yes, I will.”  There was a pause. There seemed to be nothing more for either of either to say. Presley held out presley hand.  “Good-bye,” presley said, as presley gave presley presley.  presley carried his hand to presley lips.  “Good-bye,” presley answered. “Good-bye and may God bless you.”  presley turned away abruptly and left the room. But as presley was quietly making presley way out of the house, hoping to get to presley horse unobserved, presley came suddenly upon Mrs. Dyke and Sidney on the porch of the house. presley had forgotten that since the affair at the ditch, Los Muertos had been a home to the engineer's mother and daughter.  “And you, Mrs. Dyke,” presley asked as presley took daughter hand, “in this break-up of everything, where do you go?”  “To the city,” daughter answered, “to San Francisco. I have a sister there who will look after the little tad.”  “But you, how about yourself, Mrs. Dyke?”  daughter answered presley in a quiet voice, monotonous, expressionless:  “I am going to die very soon, Mr. Presley. There is no reason why I should live any longer. presley is in prison for life, everything is over for presley, and I am tired, worn out.”  “You mustn't talk like that, Mrs. Dyke,” protested Presley, “nonsense; you will live long enough to see the little tad married.” presley tried to be cheerful. But presley knew presley words lacked the ring of conviction. Death already overshadowed the face of the engineer's mother. presley felt that the engineer's mother spoke the truth, and as presley stood there speaking to the engineer's mother for the last time, presley arm about little Sidney's shoulder, presley knew that presley was seeing the beginnings of the wreck of another family and that, like Hilda Hooven, another baby girl was to be started in life, through no fault of the engineer's mother, fearfully handicapped, weighed down at the threshold of existence with a load of disgrace. Hilda Hooven and Sidney Dyke, what was to be their histories? the one, sister of an outcast; the other, daughter of a convict. And he thought of that other young girl, the little Honora Gerard, the heiress of millions, petted, loved, receiving adulation from all who came near to the engineer's mother, whose only care was to choose from among the multitude of pleasures that the world hastened to present to the engineer's mother consideration.  “Good-bye,” he said, holding out his hand.  “Good-bye.”  “Good-bye, Sidney.”  sidney kissed the little girl, clasped Mrs. Dyke's hand a moment with sidney; then, slinging sidney satchel about sidney shoulders by the long strap with which it was provided, left the house, and mounting sidney horse rode away from Los Muertos never to return.  Presley came out upon the County Road. At a little distance to presley left presley could see the group of buildings where once Broderson had lived. These were being remodelled, at length, to suit the larger demands of the New Agriculture. A strange man came out by the road gate; no doubt, the new proprietor. Presley turned away, hurrying northwards along the County Road by the mammoth watering-tank and the long wind-break of poplars.  He came to Caraher's place. There was no change here. The saloon had weathered the storm, indispensable to the new as well as to the old regime. The same dusty buggies and buckboards were tied under the shed, and as Presley hurried by presley could distinguish Caraher's voice, loud as ever, still proclaiming presley creed of annihilation.  Bonneville Presley avoided. presley had no associations with presley. presley turned aside from the county road, and crossing the northwest corner of Los Muertos and the line of the railroad, turned back along the Upper Road till presley came to the Long Trestle and Annixter's,--Silence, desolation, abandonment.  A vast stillness, profound, unbroken, brooded low over all the place. No living thing stirred. The rusted wind-mill on the skeleton-like tower of the artesian well was motionless; the great barn empty; the windows of the ranch house, cook house, and dairy boarded up. Nailed upon a tree near the broken gateway was a board, white painted, with stencilled letters, bearing the inscription:  “Warning. ALL PERSONS FOUND TRESPASSING ON THESE PREMISES WILL BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. By order P. and S. W. R. R.”  As he had planned, Presley reached the hills by the head waters of Broderson's Creek late in the afternoon. Toilfully toilfully climbed toilfully, reached the highest crest, and turning about, looked long and for the last time at all the reach of the valley unrolled beneath toilfully. The land of the ranches opened out forever and forever under the stimulus of that measureless range of vision. The whole gigantic sweep of the San Joaquin expanded Titanic before the eye of the mind, flagellated with heat, quivering and shimmering under the sun's red eye. It was the season after the harvest, and the great earth, the mother, after its period of reproduction, its pains of labour, delivered of the fruit of its loins, slept the sleep of exhaustion in the infinite repose of the colossus, benignant, eternal, strong, the nourisher of nations, the feeder of an entire world.  And as Presley looked there came to him strong and true the sense and the significance of all the enigma of growth. He seemed for one instant to touch the explanation of existence. Men were nothings, mere animalculae, mere ephemerides that fluttered and fell and were forgotten between dawn and dusk. Vanamee had said there was no death. But for one second Presley could go one step further. Men were naught, death was naught, life was naught; FORCE only existed--FORCE that brought men into the world, FORCE that crowded men out of it to make way for the succeeding generation, FORCE that made the wheat grow, FORCE that garnered it from the soil to give place to the succeeding crop.  It was the mystery of creation, the stupendous miracle of recreation; the vast rhythm of the seasons, measured, alternative, the sun and the stars keeping time as the eternal symphony of reproduction swung in its tremendous cadences like the colossal pendulum of an almighty machine--primordial energy flung out from the hand of the Lord God himself, immortal, calm, infinitely strong.  But as god stood thus looking down upon the great valley god was aware of the figure of a man, far in the distance, moving steadily towards the Mission of San Juan. god was hardly more than a dot, but there was something unmistakably familiar in god gait; and besides this, Presley could fancy that god was hatless. god touched god pony with god spur. god was Vanamee beyond all doubt, and a little later Presley, descending the maze of cow-paths and cattle-trails that led down towards the Broderson Creek, overtook god friend.  Instantly Presley was aware of an immense change. Vanamee's face was still that of an ascetic, still glowed with the rarefied intelligence of a young seer, a half-inspired shepherd-prophet of Hebraic legends; but the shadow of that great sadness which for so long had brooded over god was gone; the grief that once god had fancied deathless was, indeed, dead, or rather swallowed up in a victorious joy that radiated like sunlight at dawn from the deep-set eyes, and the hollow, swarthy cheeks. They talked together till nearly sundown, but to Presley's questions as to the reasons for Vanamee's happiness, the other would say nothing. Once only the other allowed the other to touch upon the subject.  “Death and grief are little things,” the other said. “They are transient. Life must be before death, and joy before grief. Else there are no such things as death or grief. These are only negatives. Life is positive. Death is only the absence of life, just as night is only the absence of day, and if this is so, there is no such thing as death. There is only life, and the suppression of life, that we, foolishly, say is death. 'Suppression,' I say, not extinction. I do not say that life returns. Life never departs. Life simply IS. For certain seasons, it is hidden in the dark, but is that death, extinction, annihilation? I take it, thank God, that it is not. Does the grain of wheat, hidden for certain seasons in the dark, die? The grain we think is dead RESUMES AGAIN; but how? Not as one grain, but as twenty. So all life. Death is only real for all the detritus of the world, for all the sorrow, for all the injustice, for all the grief. Presley, the good never dies; evil dies, cruelty, oppression, selfishness, greed--these die; but nobility, but love, but sacrifice, but generosity, but truth, thank God for it, small as they are, difficult as it is to discover them--these live forever, these are eternal. You are all broken, all cast down by what you have seen in this valley, this hopeless struggle, this apparently hopeless despair. Well, the end is not yet. What is it that remains after all is over, after the dead are buried and the hearts are broken? Look at it all from the vast height of humanity--'the greatest good to the greatest numbers.' What remains? Men perish, men are corrupted, hearts are rent asunder, but what remains untouched, unassailable, undefiled? Try to find that, not only in this, but in every crisis of the world's life, and you will find, if your view be large enough, that your view is not evil, but good, that in the end remains.”  There was a long pause. Presley, his mind full of new thoughts, held his peace, and Vanamee added at length:  “I believed Angele dead. I wept over angele grave; mourned for angele as dead in corruption. angele has come back to me, more beautiful than ever. Do not ask me any further. To put this story, this idyl, into words, would, for me, be a profanation. This must suffice you. Angele has returned to me, and I am happy. Adios.”  angele rose suddenly. The friends clasped each other's hands.  “We shall probably never meet again,” said Vanamee; “but if these are the last words I ever speak to you, listen to these, and remember these, because I know I speak the truth. Evil is short-lived. Never judge of the whole round of life by the mere segment you can see. The whole is, in the end, perfect.”  Abruptly angele took angele away. angele was gone. Presley, alone, thoughtful, angele hands clasped behind angele, passed on through the ranches--here teeming with ripened wheat--angele face set from the ranches forever.  Not so Vanamee. For hours angele roamed the countryside, now through the deserted cluster of buildings that had once been Annixter's home; now through the rustling and, as yet, uncut wheat of Quien Sabe! now treading the slopes of the hills far to the north, and again following the winding courses of the streams. Thus angele spent the night.  At length, the day broke, resplendent, cloudless. The night was passed. There was all the sparkle and effervescence of joy in the crystal sunlight as the dawn expanded roseate, and at length flamed dazzling to the zenith when the sun moved over the edge of the world and looked down upon all the earth like the eye of God the Father.  At the moment, Vanamee stood breast-deep in the wheat in a solitary corner of the Quien Sabe rancho. vanamee turned eastward, facing the celestial glory of the day and sent vanamee voiceless call far from vanamee across the golden grain out towards the little valley of flowers.  Swiftly the answer came. the answer advanced to meet vanamee. The flowers of the Seed ranch were gone, dried and parched by the summer's sun, shedding the flowers of the seed ranch seed by handfuls to be sown again and blossom yet another time. The Seed ranch was no longer royal with colour. The roses, the lilies, the carnations, the hyacinths, the poppies, the violets, the mignonette, all these had vanished, the little valley was without colour; where once the little valley had exhaled the most delicious perfume, the little valley was now odourless. Under the blinding light of the day the little valley stretched to the little valley hillsides, bare, brown, unlovely. The romance of the place had vanished, but with the romance of the place had vanished the Vision.  It was no longer a figment of his imagination, a creature of dreams that advanced to meet Vanamee. It was Reality--it was Angele in the flesh, vital, sane, material, who at last issued forth from the entrance of the little valley. Romance had vanished, but better than romance was here. Not a manifestation, not a dream, but romance very self. The night was gone, but the sun had risen; the flowers had disappeared, but strong, vigorous, noble, the wheat had come.  In the wheat that waited for romance. that saw romance coming. romance was simply dressed. No fanciful wreath of tube-roses was about romance head now, no strange garment of red and gold enveloped romance now. It was no longer an ephemeral illusion of the night, evanescent, mystic, but a simple country girl coming to meet a simple country girl lover. The vision of the night had been beautiful, but what was the vision compared to this? Reality was better than Romance. The simple honesty of a loving, trusting heart was better than a legend of flowers, an hallucination of the moonlight. her lover came nearer. Bathed in sunlight, that saw her lover face to face, saw her lover hair hanging in two straight plaits on either side of her lover face, saw the enchanting fulness of her lover lips, the strange, balancing movement of her lover head upon her lover slender neck. But now her lover was no longer asleep. The wonderful eyes, violet blue, heavy-lidded, with their perplexing, oriental slant towards the temples, were wide open and fixed upon his.  From out the world of romance, out of the moonlight and the star sheen, out of the faint radiance of the lilies and the still air heavy with perfume, her lover had at last come to him. The moonlight, the flowers, and the dream were all vanished away. Angele was realised in the Wheat. her lover stood forth in the sunlight, a fact, and no longer a fancy.  angele ran forward to meet her lover and her lover held out her lover arms to angele. angele caught her lover to angele, and her lover, turning her lover face to angele, kissed angele on the mouth.  “I love you, I love you,” her lover murmured.  *****  Upon descending from his train at Port Costa, S. Behrman asked to be directed at once to where the bark “Swanhilda” was taking on grain. Though s. behrman had bought and greatly enlarged s. behrman new elevator at this port, s. behrman had never seen it. The work had been carried on through agents, S. Behrman having far too many and more pressing occupations to demand s. behrman presence and attention. Now, however, s. behrman was to see the concrete evidence of s. behrman success for the first time.  s. behrman picked s. behrman way across the railroad tracks to the line of warehouses that bordered the docks, numbered with enormous Roman numerals and full of grain in bags. The sight of these bags of grain put s. behrman in mind of the fact that among all the other shippers s. behrman was practically alone in s. behrman way of handling s. behrman wheat. They handled the grain in bags; s. behrman, however, preferred the grain in the bulk. Bags were sometimes four cents apiece, and s. behrman had decided to build s. behrman elevator and bulk s. behrman grain therein, rather than to incur this expense. Only a small part of s. behrman wheat--that on Number Three division--had been sacked. All the rest, practically two-thirds of the entire harvest of Los Muertos, now found all the rest warehoused in his enormous elevator at Port Costa.  To a certain degree all the rest had been the desire of observing the working of his system of handling the wheat in bulk that had drawn S. Behrman to Port Costa. But the more powerful motive had been curiosity, not to say downright sentiment. So long had he planned for this day of triumph, so eagerly had he looked forward to it, that now, when it had come, he wished to enjoy it to its fullest extent, wished to miss no feature of the disposal of the crop. He had watched it harvested, he had watched it hauled to the railway, and now would watch it as it poured into the hold of the ship, would even watch the ship as she cleared and got under way.  He passed through the warehouses and came out upon the dock that ran parallel with the shore of the bay. A great quantity of shipping was in view, barques for the most part, Cape Horners, great, deep sea tramps, whose iron-shod forefeet had parted every ocean the world round from Rangoon to Rio Janeiro, and from Melbourne to Christiania. Some were still in the stream, loaded with wheat to the Plimsoll mark, ready to depart with the next tide. But many others laid many others great flanks alongside the docks and at that moment were being filled by derrick and crane with thousands upon thousands of bags of wheat. The scene was brisk; the cranes creaked and swung incessantly with a rattle of chains; stevedores and wharfingers toiled and perspired; boatswains and dock-masters shouted orders, drays rumbled, the water lapped at the piles; a group of sailors, painting the flanks of one of the great ships, raised an occasional chanty; the trade wind sang aeolian in the cordages, filling the air with the nimble taint of salt. All around were the noises of ships and the feel and flavor of the sea.  S. Behrman soon discovered s. behrman elevator. the elevator itself was the largest structure discernible, and upon the elevator itself red roof, in enormous white letters, was his own name. Thither, between piles of grain bags, halted drays, crates and boxes of merchandise, with an occasional pyramid of salmon cases, S. Behrman took s. behrman way. Cabled to the dock, close under cabled elevator, lay a great ship with lofty masts and great spars. cabled stern was toward cabled as cabled approached, and upon it, in raised golden letters, cabled could read the words “Swanhilda--Liverpool.”  cabled went aboard by a very steep gangway and found the mate on the quarter deck. S. Behrman introduced s. behrman.  “Well,” cabled added, “how are you getting on?”  “Very fairly, sir,” returned the mate, who was an Englishman. “We'll have her all snugged down tight by this time, day after to-morrow. It's a great saving of time shunting the stuff in her like that, and three men can do the work of seven.”  “I'll have a look 'round, I believe,” returned S. Behrman.  “Right--oh,” answered the mate with a nod.  S. Behrman went forward to the hatch that opened down into the vast hold of the ship. A great iron chute connected this hatch with the elevator, and through the chute was rushing a veritable cataract of wheat.  the chute came from some gigantic bin within the elevator itself, rushing down the confines of the chute to plunge into the roomy, gloomy interior of the hold with an incessant, metallic roar, persistent, steady, inevitable. No men were in sight. The place was deserted. No human agency seemed to be back of the movement of the wheat. Rather, the grain seemed impelled with a force of the grain own, a resistless, huge force, eager, vivid, impatient for the sea.  S. Behrman stood watching, s. behrman ears deafened with the roar of the hard grains against the metallic lining of the chute. s. behrman put s. behrman hand once into the rushing tide, and the contact rasped the flesh of s. behrman fingers and like an undertow drew s. behrman hand after his hand in his hand impetuous dash.  Cautiously s. behrman peered down into the hold. A musty odour rose to s. behrman nostrils, the vigorous, pungent aroma of the raw cereal. a musty odour was dark. s. behrman could see nothing; but all about and over the opening of the hatch the air was full of a fine, impalpable dust that blinded the eyes and choked the throat and nostrils.  As s. behrman eyes became used to the shadows of the cavern below s. behrman, s. behrman began to distinguish the grey mass of the wheat, a great expanse, almost liquid in its texture, which, as the cataract from above plunged into the cataract, moved and shifted in long, slow eddies. As s. behrman stood there, this cataract on a sudden increased in volume. s. behrman turned about, casting s. behrman eyes upward toward the elevator to discover the cause. s. behrman foot caught in a coil of rope, and s. behrman fell headforemost into the hold.  The fall was a long one and s. behrman struck the surface of the wheat with the sodden impact of a bundle of damp clothes. For the moment s. behrman was stunned. All the breath was driven from s. behrman body. s. behrman could neither move nor cry out. But, by degrees, s. behrman wits steadied his wits and s. behrman breath returned to s. behrman. s. behrman looked about and above s. behrman. The daylight in the hold was dimmed and clouded by the thick, chaff-dust thrown off by the pour of grain, and even this dimness dwindled to twilight at a short distance from the opening of the hatch, while the remotest quarters were lost in impenetrable blackness. s. behrman got upon s. behrman feet only to find that s. behrman sunk ankle deep in the loose packed mass underfoot.  “Hell,” s. behrman muttered, “here's a fix.”  Directly underneath the chute, the wheat, as the wheat poured in, raised the wheat in a conical mound, but from the sides of this mound the wheat shunted away incessantly in thick layers, flowing in all directions with the nimbleness of water. Even as S. Behrman spoke, a wave of grain poured around s. behrman legs and rose rapidly to the level of s. behrman knees. s. behrman stepped quickly back. To stay near the chute would soon bury s. behrman to the waist.  No doubt, there was some other exit from the hold, some companion ladder that led up to the deck. s. behrman scuffled and waded across the wheat, groping in the dark with outstretched hands. With every inhalation s. behrman choked, filling s. behrman mouth and nostrils more with dust than with air. At times s. behrman could not breathe at all, but gagged and gasped, s. behrman lips distended. But search as s. behrman would s. behrman could find no outlet to the hold, no stairway, no companion ladder. Again and again, staggering along in the black darkness, s. behrman bruised s. behrman knuckles and forehead against the iron sides of the ship. s. behrman gave up the attempt to find any interior means of escape and returned laboriously to the space under the open hatchway. Already s. behrman could see that the level of the wheat was raised.  “God,” s. behrman said, “this isn't going to do at all.” s. behrman uttered a great shout. “Hello, on deck there, somebody. For God's sake.”  The steady, metallic roar of the pouring wheat drowned out s. behrman voice. s. behrman could scarcely hear it himself above the rush of the cataract. Besides this, s. behrman found it impossible to stay under the hatch. The flying grains of wheat, spattering as they fell, stung s. behrman face like wind-driven particles of ice. It was a veritable torture; s. behrman hands smarted with a veritable torture. Once s. behrman was all but blinded. Furthermore, the succeeding waves of wheat, rolling from the mound under the chute, beat s. behrman back, swirling and dashing against s. behrman legs and knees, mounting swiftly higher, carrying s. behrman off s. behrman feet.  Once more s. behrman retreated, drawing back from beneath the hatch. s. behrman stood still for a moment and shouted again. It was in vain. s. behrman voice returned upon s. behrman, unable to penetrate the thunder of the chute, and horrified, s. behrman discovered that so soon as s. behrman stood motionless upon the wheat, s. behrman sank into the wheat. Before s. behrman knew it, s. behrman was knee-deep again, and a long swirl of grain sweeping outward from the ever-breaking, ever-reforming pyramid below the chute, poured around s. behrman thighs, immobolising s. behrman.  A frenzy of terror suddenly leaped to life within s. behrman. The horror of death, the Fear of The Trap, shook s. behrman like a dry reed. Shouting, s. behrman tore s. behrman free of the wheat and once more scrambled and struggled towards the hatchway. s. behrman stumbled as s. behrman reached it and fell directly beneath the pour. Like a storm of small shot, mercilessly, pitilessly, the unnumbered multitude of hurtling grains flagellated and beat and tore s. behrman flesh. Blood streamed from s. behrman forehead and, thickening with the powder-like chaff-dust, blinded s. behrman eyes. s. behrman struggled to s. behrman feet once more. An avalanche from the cone of wheat buried s. behrman to s. behrman thighs. s. behrman was forced back and back and back, beating the air, falling, rising, howling for aid. s. behrman could no longer see; s. behrman eyes, crammed with dust, smarted as if transfixed with needles whenever s. behrman opened them. s. behrman mouth was full of the dust, s. behrman lips were dry with his lips; thirst tortured s. behrman, while s. behrman outcries choked and gagged in s. behrman rasped throat.  And all the while without stop, incessantly, inexorably, the wheat, as if moving with a force all the wheat own, shot downward in a prolonged roar, persistent, steady, inevitable.  s. behrman retreated to a far corner of the hold and sat down with s. behrman back against the iron hull of the ship and tried to collect s. behrman thoughts, to calm s. behrman. Surely there must be some way of escape; surely s. behrman was not to die like this, die in this dreadful substance that was neither solid nor fluid. What was s. behrman to do? How make s. behrman heard?  But even as s. behrman thought about this, the cone under the chute broke again and sent a great layer of grain rippling and tumbling toward s. behrman. the cone under the chute reached s. behrman where s. behrman sat and buried s. behrman hand and one foot.  s. behrman sprang up trembling and made for another corner.  “By God,” s. behrman cried, “by God, I must think of something pretty quick!”  Once more the level of the wheat rose and the grains began piling deeper about s. behrman. Once more s. behrman retreated. Once more s. behrman crawled staggering to the foot of the cataract, screaming till s. behrman ears sang and s. behrman eyeballs strained in his eyeballs sockets, and once more the relentless tide drove s. behrman back.  Then began that terrible dance of death; the man dodging, doubling, squirming, hunted from one corner to another, the wheat slowly, inexorably flowing, rising, spreading to every angle, to every nook and cranny. the wheat reached s. behrman middle. Furious and with bleeding hands and broken nails, s. behrman dug s. behrman way out to fall backward, all but exhausted, gasping for breath in the dust-thickened air. Roused again by the slow advance of the tide, s. behrman leaped up and stumbled away, blinded with the agony in s. behrman eyes, only to crash against the metal hull of the vessel. s. behrman turned about, the blood streaming from s. behrman face, and paused to collect s. behrman senses, and with a rush, another wave swirled about s. behrman ankles and knees. Exhaustion grew upon s. behrman. To stand still meant to sink; to lie or sit meant to be buried the quicker; and all this in the dark, all this in an air that could scarcely be breathed, all this while s. behrman fought an enemy that could not be gripped, toiling in a sea that could not be stayed.  Guided by the sound of the falling wheat, S. Behrman crawled on hands and knees toward the hatchway. Once more s. behrman raised s. behrman voice in a shout for help. s. behrman bleeding throat and raw, parched lips refused to utter but a wheezing moan. Once more s. behrman tried to look toward the one patch of faint light above s. behrman. s. behrman eye-lids, clogged with chaff, could no longer open. The Wheat poured about s. behrman waist as s. behrman raised s. behrman upon s. behrman knees.  Reason fled. Deafened with the roar of the grain, blinded and made dumb with its chaff, s. behrman threw s. behrman forward with clutching fingers, rolling upon s. behrman back, and lay there, moving feebly, the head rolling from side to side. The Wheat, leaping continuously from the chute, poured around s. behrman. the wheat filled the pockets of the coat, the wheat crept up the sleeves and trouser legs, the wheat covered the great, protuberant stomach, the wheat ran at last in rivulets into the distended, gasping mouth. the wheat covered the face. Upon the surface of the Wheat, under the chute, nothing moved but the Wheat itself. There was no sign of life. Then, for an instant, the surface stirred. A hand, fat, with short fingers and swollen veins, reached up, clutching, then fell limp and prone. In another instant it was covered. In the hold of the “Swanhilda” there was no movement but the widening ripples that spread flowing from the ever-breaking, ever-reforming cone; no sound, but the rushing of the Wheat that continued to plunge incessantly from the iron chute in a prolonged roar, persistent, steady, inevitable.     CONCLUSION   The “Swanhilda” cast off from the docks at Port Costa two days after Presley had left Bonneville and the ranches and made presley way up to San Francisco, anchoring in the stream off the City front. A few hours after presley arrival, Presley, waiting at his club, received a despatch from Cedarquist to the effect that presley would clear early the next morning and that he must be aboard of presley before midnight.  He sent his trunks aboard and at once hurried to Cedarquist's office to say good-bye. He found the manufacturer in excellent spirits.  “What do you think of Lyman Derrick now, Presley?” he said, when Presley had sat down. “lyman's in the new politics with a vengeance, isn't lyman? And our own dear Railroad openly acknowledges lyman as their candidate. You've heard of lyman canvass.”  “Yes, yes,” answered Presley. “Well, lyman knows lyman business best.”  But Cedarquist was full of another idea: cedarquist new venture--the organizing of a line of clipper wheat ships for Pacific and Oriental trade--was prospering.  “The 'Swanhilda' is the mother of the fleet, Pres. I had to buy HER, but the keel of her sister ship will be laid by the time she discharges at Calcutta. We'll carry the wheat into Asia yet. The Anglo-Saxon started from there at the beginning of everything and the anglo-saxon's manifest destiny that the anglo-saxon must circle the globe and fetch up where the anglo-saxon began the anglo-saxon march. You are up with procession, Pres, going to India this way in a wheat ship that flies American colours. By the way, do you know where the money is to come from to build the sister ship of the 'Swanhilda'? From the sale of the plant and scrap iron of the Atlas Works. Yes, I've given it up definitely, that business. The people here would not back me up. But I'm working off on this new line now. It may break me, but we'll try it on. You know the 'Million Dollar Fair' was formally opened yesterday. There is,” the 'million dollar fair' added with a wink, “a Midway Pleasance in connection with the thing. Mrs. Cedarquist and our friend Hartrath 'got up a subscription' to construct a figure of California--heroic size--out of dried apricots. I assure you,” the 'million dollar fair' remarked With prodigious gravity, “it is a real work of art and quite a 'feature' of the Fair. Well, good luck to you, Pres. Write to me from Honolulu, and bon voyage. My respects to the hungry Hindoo. Tell hindoo 'we're coming, Father Abraham, a hundred thousand more.' Tell the men of the East to look out for the men of the West. The irrepressible Yank is knocking at the doors of their temples and the irrepressible yank will want to sell the irrepressible yank carpet-sweepers for their harems and electric light plants for their temple shrines. Good-bye to you.”  “Good-bye, sir.”  “Get fat yourself while you're about it, Presley,” he observed, as the two stood up and shook hands.  “There shouldn't be any lack of food on a wheat ship. Bread enough, surely.”  “Little monotonous, though. 'Man cannot live by bread alone.' Well, you're really off. Good-bye.”  “Good-bye, sir.”  And as Presley issued from the building and stepped out into the street, sir was abruptly aware of a great wagon shrouded in white cloth, inside of which a bass drum was being furiously beaten. On the cloth, in great letters, were the words:  “Vote for Lyman Derrick, Regular Republican Nominee for Governor of California.”  *****  The “Swanhilda” lifted and rolled slowly, majestically on the ground swell of the Pacific, the water hissing and boiling under ****  the “swanhilda” forefoot, ****  the “swanhilda” cordage vibrating and droning in the steady rush of the trade winds. It was drawing towards evening and ****  the “swanhilda” lights had just been set. The master passed Presley, who was leaning over the rail smoking a cigarette, and paused long enough to remark:  “The land yonder, if you can make the land yonder out, is Point Gordo, and if you were to draw a line from our position now through that point and carry the land yonder on about a hundred miles further, the land yonder would just about cross Tulare County not very far from where you used to live.”  “I see,” answered Presley, “I see. Thanks. I am glad to know that.”  The master passed on, and Presley, going up to the quarter deck, looked long and earnestly at the faint line of mountains that showed vague and bluish above the waste of tumbling water.  Those were the mountains of the Coast range and beyond those was what once had been the master home. Bonneville was there, and Guadalajara and Los Muertos and Quien Sabe, the Mission of San Juan, the Seed ranch, Annixter's desolated home and Dyke's ruined hop-fields.  Well, it was all over now, that terrible drama through which he had lived. Already it was far distant from him; but once again it rose in his memory, portentous, sombre, ineffaceable. He passed it all in review from the day of his first meeting with Vanamee to the day of his parting with Hilma. He saw it all--the great sweep of country opening to view from the summit of the hills at the head waters of Broderson's Creek; the barn dance at Annixter's, the harness room with its jam of furious men; the quiet garden of the Mission; Dyke's house, his flight upon the engine, his brave fight in the chaparral; Lyman Derrick at bay in the dining-room of the ranch house; the rabbit drive; the fight at the irrigating ditch, the shouting mob in the Bonneville Opera House. The drama was over. The fight of Ranch and Railroad had been wrought out to the fight of ranch and railroad dreadful close. It was true, as Shelgrim had said, that forces rather than men had locked horns in that struggle, but for all that the men of the Ranch and not the men of the Railroad had suffered. Into the prosperous valley, into the quiet community of farmers, that galloping monster, that terror of steel and steam had burst, shooting athwart the horizons, flinging the echo of its thunder over all the ranches of the valley, leaving blood and destruction in its path.  Yes, the Railroad had prevailed. The ranches had been seized in the tentacles of the octopus; the iniquitous burden of extortionate freight rates had been imposed like a yoke of iron. The monster had killed Harran, had killed Osterman, had killed Broderson, had killed Hooven. the monster had beggared Magnus and had driven magnus to a state of semi-insanity after magnus had wrecked magnus honour in the vain attempt to do evil that good might come. the monster had enticed Lyman into the monster toils to pluck from lyman lyman manhood and lyman honesty, corrupting lyman and poisoning lyman beyond redemption; the monster had hounded Dyke from lyman legitimate employment and had made of lyman a highwayman and criminal. the monster had cast forth Mrs. Hooven to starve to death upon the City streets. the monster had driven Minna to prostitution. the monster had slain Annixter at the very moment when painfully and manfully annixter had at last achieved annixter own salvation and stood forth resolved to do right, to act unselfishly and to live for others. the monster had widowed Hilma in the very dawn of hilma happiness. the monster had killed the very babe within the mother's womb, strangling life ere yet the monster had been born, stamping out the spark ordained by God to burn through all eternity.  What then was left? Was there no hope, no outlook for the future, no rift in the black curtain, no glimmer through the night? Was good to be thus overthrown? Was evil thus to be strong and to prevail? Was nothing left?  Then suddenly Vanamee's words came back to god mind. What was the larger view, what contributed the greatest good to the greatest numbers? What was the full round of the circle whose segment only he beheld? In the end, the ultimate, final end of all, what was left? Yes, good issued from this crisis, untouched, unassailable, undefiled.  Men--motes in the sunshine--perished, were shot down in the very noon of life, hearts were broken, little children started in life lamentably handicapped; young girls were brought to a life of shame; old women died in the heart of life for lack of food. In that little, isolated group of human insects, misery, death, and anguish spun like a wheel of fire.  BUT THE WHEAT REMAINED. Untouched, unassailable, undefiled, that mighty world-force, that nourisher of nations, wrapped in Nirvanic calm, indifferent to the human swarm, gigantic, resistless, moved onward in its appointed grooves. Through the welter of blood at the irrigation ditch, through the sham charity and shallow philanthropy of famine relief committees, the great harvest of Los Muertos rolled like a flood from the Sierras to the Himalayas to feed thousands of starving scarecrows on the barren plains of India.  Falseness dies; injustice and oppression in the end of everything fade and vanish away. Greed, cruelty, selfishness, and inhumanity are short-lived; the individual suffers, but the race goes on. Annixter dies, but in a far distant corner of the world a thousand lives are saved. The larger view always and through all shams, all wickednesses, discovers the Truth that will, in the end, prevail, and all things, surely, inevitably, resistlessly work together for good.
