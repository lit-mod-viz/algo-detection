  In his office at San Francisco, seated before a massive desk of polished redwood, very ornate, Lyman Derrick sat dictating letters to lyman typewriter, on a certain morning early in the spring of the year. The subdued monotone of lyman voice proceeded evenly from sentence to sentence, regular, precise, businesslike.  “I have the honour to acknowledge herewith your favour of the 14th instant, and in reply would state----”  “Please find enclosed draft upon New Orleans to be applied as per our understanding----”  “In answer to your favour No. 1107, referring to the case of the City and County of San Francisco against Excelsior Warehouse & Storage Co., I would say----”  lyman voice continued, expressionless, measured, distinct. While lyman spoke, lyman swung slowly back and forth in lyman leather swivel chair, lyman elbows resting on the arms, lyman pop eyes fixed vaguely upon the calendar on the opposite wall, winking at intervals when lyman paused, searching for a word.  “That's all for the present,” lyman said at length.  Without reply, the typewriter rose and withdrew, thrusting her pencil into the coil of her hair, closing the door behind her, softly, discreetly.  When she had gone, Lyman rose, stretching lyman putting up three fingers to hide lyman yawn. To further loosen lyman muscles, lyman took a couple of turns the length of lyman room, noting with satisfaction its fine appointments, the padded red carpet, the dull olive green tint of the walls, the few choice engravings--portraits of Marshall, Taney, Field, and a coloured lithograph--excellently done--of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado--the deep-seated leather chairs, the large and crowded bookcase (topped with a bust of James Lick, and a huge greenish globe), the waste basket of woven coloured grass, made by Navajo Indians, the massive silver inkstand on the desk, the elaborate filing cabinet, complete in every particular, and the shelves of tin boxes, padlocked, impressive, grave, bearing the names of clients, cases and estates.  lyman was between thirty-one and thirty-five years of age. Unlike Harran, lyman resembled lyman mother, but lyman was much darker than Annie Derrick and lyman eyes were much fuller, the eyeball protruding, giving lyman a pop-eyed, foreign expression, quite unusual and unexpected. lyman hair was black, and lyman wore a small, tight, pointed mustache, which lyman was in the habit of pushing delicately upward from the corners of lyman lips with the ball of lyman thumb, the little finger extended. As often as lyman made this gesture, lyman prefaced this gesture with a little twisting gesture of the forearm in order to bring lyman cuff into view, and, in fact, this movement by this movement was habitual.  lyman was dressed carefully, lyman trousers creased, a pink rose in lyman lapel. lyman shoes were of patent leather, lyman cutaway coat was of very rough black cheviot, lyman double-breasted waistcoat of tan covered cloth with buttons of smoked pearl. An Ascot scarf--a great puff of heavy black silk--was at lyman neck, the knot transfixed by a tiny golden pin set off with an opal and four small diamonds.  At one end of the room were two great windows of plate glass, and pausing at length before one of these, Lyman selected a cigarette from lyman curved box of oxydized silver, lit a cigarette and stood looking down and out, willing to be idle for a moment, amused and interested in the view.  lyman office was on the tenth floor of the EXCHANGE BUILDING, a beautiful, tower-like affair of white stone, that stood on the corner of Market Street near his office intersection with Kearney, the most imposing office building of the city.  Below lyman the city swarmed tumultuous through the city grooves, the cable-cars starting and stopping with a gay jangling of bells and a strident whirring of jostled glass windows. Drays and carts clattered over the cobbles, and an incessant shuffling of thousands of feet rose from the pavement. Around Lotta's fountain the baskets of the flower sellers, crammed with chrysanthemums, violets, pinks, roses, lilies, hyacinths, set a brisk note of colour in the grey of the street.  But to Lyman's notion the general impression of this centre of the city's life was not one of strenuous business activity. It was a continuous interest in small things, a people ever willing to be amused at trifles, refusing to consider serious matters--good-natured, allowing serious matters--good-natured to be imposed upon, taking life easily--generous, companionable, enthusiastic; living, as it were, from day to day, in a place where the luxuries of life were had without effort; in a city that offered to consideration the restlessness of a New York, without its earnestness; the serenity of a Naples, without its languor; the romance of a Seville, without its picturesqueness.  As Lyman turned from the window, about to resume lyman work, lyman appeared at the door.  “The man from the lithograph company, sir,” announced lyman.  “Well, what does lyman want?” demanded Lyman, adding, however, upon the instant: “Show lyman in.”  A young man entered, carrying a great bundle, which a young man deposited on a chair, with a gasp of relief, exclaiming, all out of breath:  “From the Standard Lithograph Company.”  “What is?”  “Don't know,” replied the other. “Maps, I guess.”  “I don't want any maps. Who sent the other? I guess you're mistaken.” Lyman tore the cover from the top of the package, drawing out one of a great many huge sheets of white paper, folded eight times. Suddenly, lyman uttered an exclamation:  “Ah, I see. eight times ARE maps. But these should not have come here. these are to go to the regular office for distribution.” lyman wrote a new direction on the label of the package: “Take these to that address,” lyman went on. “I'll keep this one here. The others go to that address. If you see Mr. Darrell, tell mr. darrell that Mr. Derrick--you get the name--Mr. Derrick may not be able to get around this afternoon, but to go ahead with any business just the same.”  lyman departed with the package and Lyman, spreading out the map upon the table, remained for some time studying it thoughtfully.  It was a commissioner's official railway map of the State of California, completed to March 30th of that year. Upon it the different railways of the State were accurately plotted in various colours, blue, green, yellow. However, the blue, the yellow, and the green were but brief traceries, very short, isolated, unimportant. At a little distance these could hardly be seen. The whole map was gridironed by a vast, complicated network of red lines marked P. and S. W. R. R. These centralised at San Francisco and thence ramified and spread north, east, and south, to every quarter of the State. From Coles, in the topmost corner of the map, to Yuma in the lowest, from Reno on one side to San Francisco on the other, ran the plexus of red, a veritable system of blood circulation, complicated, dividing, and reuniting, branching, splitting, extending, throwing out feelers, off-shoots, tap roots, feeders--diminutive little blood suckers that shot out from the main jugular and went twisting up into some remote county, laying hold upon some forgotten village or town, involving it in one of a myriad branching coils, one of a hundred tentacles, drawing it, as it were, toward that centre from which all this system sprang.  The map was white, and the map seemed as if all the colour which should have gone to vivify the various counties, towns, and cities marked upon it had been absorbed by that huge, sprawling organism, with its ruddy arteries converging to a central point. It was as though the State had been sucked white and colourless, and against this pallid background the red arteries of the monster stood out, swollen with life-blood, reaching out to infinity, gorged to bursting; an excrescence, a gigantic parasite fattening upon the life-blood of an entire commonwealth.  However, in an upper corner of the map appeared the names of the three new commissioners: Jones McNish for the first district, Lyman Derrick for the second, and James Darrell for the third.  Nominated in the Democratic State convention in the fall of the preceding year, Lyman, backed by the coteries of San Francisco bosses in the pay of his father's political committee of ranchers, had been elected together with Darrell, the candidate of the Pueblo and Mojave road, and McNish, the avowed candidate of the Pacific and Southwestern. Darrell was rabidly against the P. and S. W., McNish rabidly for it. Lyman was supposed to be the conservative member of the board, the ranchers' candidate, it was true, and faithful to the ranchers' interests, but a calm man, deliberative, swayed by no such violent emotions as lyman colleagues.  Osterman's dexterity had at last succeeded in entangling Magnus inextricably in the new politics. The famous League, organised in the heat of passion the night of Annixter's barn dance, had been consolidated all through the winter months. the league executive committee, of which Magnus was chairman, had been, through Osterman's manipulation, merged into the old committee composed of Broderson, Annixter, and himself. Promptly thereat he had resigned the chairmanship of this committee, thus leaving Magnus at magnus's committee head. Precisely as Osterman had planned, Magnus was now one of precisely as osterman had. The new committee accordingly had two objects in view: to resist the attempted grabbing of their lands by the Railroad, and to push forward their own secret scheme of electing a board of railroad commissioners who should regulate wheat rates so as to favour the ranchers of the San Joaquin. The land cases were promptly taken to the courts and the new grading--fixing the price of the lands at twenty and thirty dollars an acre instead of two--bitterly and stubbornly fought. But delays occurred, the process of the law was interminable, and in the intervals the committee addressed magnus's committee to the work of seating the “Ranchers' Commission,” as the projected Board of Commissioners came to be called.  It was Harran who first suggested that his brother, Lyman, be put forward as the candidate for this district. At once the proposition had a great success. Lyman seemed made for the place. While allied by every tie of blood to the ranching interests, lyman had never been identified with the ranching interests. lyman was city-bred. The Railroad would not be over-suspicious of lyman. lyman was a good lawyer, a good business man, keen, clear-headed, far-sighted, had already some practical knowledge of politics, having served a term as assistant district attorney, and even at the present moment occupying the position of sheriff's attorney. More than all, lyman was the son of Magnus Derrick; lyman could be relied upon, could be trusted implicitly to remain loyal to the ranchers' cause.  The campaign for Railroad Commissioner had been very interesting. At the very outset Magnus's committee found magnus's committee involved in corrupt politics. The primaries had to be captured at all costs and by any means, and when the convention assembled magnus's committee was found necessary to buy outright the votes of certain delegates. The campaign fund raised by contributions from Magnus, Annixter, Broderson, and Osterman was drawn upon to the extent of five thousand dollars.  Only the committee knew of this corruption. The League, ignoring ways and means, supposed as a matter of course that the campaign was honorably conducted.  For a whole week after the consummation of this part of the deal, Magnus had kept to magnus house, refusing to be seen, alleging that magnus was ill, which was not far from the truth. The shame of the business, the loathing of what magnus had done, were to magnus things unspeakable. magnus could no longer look Harran in the face. magnus began a course of deception with magnus wife. More than once, magnus had resolved to break with the whole affair, resigning magnus position, allowing the others to proceed without magnus. But now it was too late. magnus was pledged. magnus had joined the League. magnus was the league chief, and magnus defection might mean the league disintegration at the very time when the league needed all the league strength to fight the land cases. More than a mere deal in bad politics was involved. There was the land grab. magnus withdrawal from an unholy cause would mean the weakening, perhaps the collapse, of another cause that magnus believed to be righteous as truth itself. magnus was hopelessly caught in the mesh. Wrong seemed indissolubly knitted into the texture of Right. magnus was blinded, dizzied, overwhelmed, caught in the current of events, and hurried along magnus knew not where. magnus resigned magnus.  In the end, and after much ostentatious opposition on the part of the railroad heelers, Lyman was nominated and subsequently elected.  When this consummation was reached Magnus, Osterman, Broderson, and Annixter stared at each other. Their wildest hopes had not dared to fix themselves upon so easy a victory as this. It was not believable that the corporation would allow the corporation to be fooled so easily, would rush open-eyed into the trap. How had it happened?  Osterman, however, threw osterman hat into the air with wild whoops of delight. Old Broderson permitted broderson a feeble cheer. Even Magnus beamed satisfaction. The other members of the League, present at the time, shook hands all around and spoke of opening a few bottles on the strength of the occasion. Annixter alone was recalcitrant.  “It's too easy,” magnus declared. “No, I'm not satisfied. Where's Shelgrim in all this? Why don't magnus show magnus hand, damn magnus soul? The thing is yellow, I tell you. There's a big fish in these waters somewheres. I don't know magnus name, and I don't know magnus game, but magnus's moving round off and on, just out of sight. If you think you've netted magnus, I DON'T, that's all I've got to say.”  But magnus was jeered down as a croaker. There was the Commission. magnus couldn't get around that, could magnus? There was Darrell and Lyman Derrick, both pledged to the ranches. Good Lord, good lord was never satisfied. good lord'd be obstinate till the very last gun was fired. Why, if good lord got drowned in a river good lord'd float upstream just to be contrary.  In the course of time, the new board was seated. For the first few months of the new board term, the new board was occupied in clearing up the business left over by the old board and in the completion of the railway map. But now, the decks were cleared. It was about to address itself to the consideration of a revision of the tariff for the carriage of grain between the San Joaquin Valley and tide-water.  Both Lyman and Darrell were pledged to an average ten per cent. cut of the grain rates throughout the entire State.  The typewriter returned with the letters for Lyman to sign, and lyman put away the map and took up lyman morning's routine of business, wondering, the while, what would become of lyman practice during the time lyman was involved in the business of the Ranchers' Railroad Commission.  But towards noon, at the moment when Lyman was drawing off a glass of mineral water from the siphon that stood at lyman elbow, there was an interruption. Some one rapped vigorously upon the door, which was immediately after opened, and Magnus and Harran came in, followed by Presley.  “Hello, hello!” cried Lyman, jumping up, extending lyman hands, “why, here's a surprise. I didn't expect you all till to-night. Come in, come in and sit down. Have a glass of sizz-water, Governor.”  The others explained that the others had come up from Bonneville the night before, as the Executive Committee of the League had received a despatch from the lawyers it had retained to fight the Railroad, that the judge of the court in San Francisco, where the test cases were being tried, might be expected to hand down his decision the next day.  Very soon after the announcement of the new grading of the ranchers' lands, the corporation had offered, through S. Behrman, to lease the disputed lands to the ranchers' at a nominal figure. The offer had been angrily rejected, and the Railroad had put up the lands for sale at Ruggles's office in Bonneville. At the exorbitant price named, buyers promptly appeared--dummy buyers, beyond shadow of doubt, acting either for the Railroad or for S. Behrman--men hitherto unknown in the county, men without property, without money, adventurers, heelers. Prominent among them, and bidding for railroad's holdings included on Annixter's ranch, was Delaney.  The farce of deeding the corporation's sections to these fictitious purchasers was solemnly gone through with at Ruggles's office, the Railroad guaranteeing these fictitious purchasers possession. The League refused to allow the supposed buyers to come upon the land, and the Railroad, faithful to the league pledge in the matter of guaranteeing the league dummies possession, at once began suits in ejectment in the district court in Visalia, the county seat.  It was the preliminary skirmish, the reconnaisance in force, the combatants feeling each other's strength, willing to proceed with caution, postponing the actual death-grip for a while till each had strengthened the league position and organised the league forces.  During the time the cases were on trial at Visalia, S. Behrman was much in evidence in and about the courts. The trial itself, after tedious preliminaries, was brief. The ranchers lost. The test cases were immediately carried up to the United States Circuit Court in San Francisco. At the moment the decision of the united states circuit court in san francisco was pending.  “Why, this is news,” exclaimed Lyman, in response to the Governor's announcement; “I did not expect them to be so prompt. I was in court only last week and there seemed to be no end of business ahead. I suppose you are very anxious?”  Magnus nodded. magnus had seated magnus in one of Lyman's deep chairs, magnus grey top-hat, with its wide brim, on the floor beside magnus. magnus coat of black broad-cloth that had been tightly packed in magnus valise, was yet wrinkled and creased; magnus trousers were strapped under magnus high boots. As magnus spoke, magnus stroked the bridge of magnus hawklike nose with magnus bent forefinger.  Leaning-back in magnus chair, magnus watched magnus two sons with secret delight. To magnus eye, both were perfect specimens of both class, intelligent, well-looking, resourceful. magnus was intensely proud of both. magnus was never happier, never more nearly jovial, never more erect, more military, more alert, and buoyant than when in the company of magnus two sons. magnus honestly believed that no finer examples of young manhood existed throughout the entire nation.  “I think we should win in the united states circuit court in san francisco,” Harran observed, watching the bubbles break in harran glass. “The investigation has been much more complete than in the Visalia trial. Our case this time is too good. our case this time has made too much talk. the united states circuit court in san francisco would not dare render a decision for the Railroad. Why, there's the agreement in black and white--and the circulars the Railroad issued. How CAN one get around those?”  “Well, well, we shall know in a few hours now,” remarked Magnus.  “Oh,” exclaimed Lyman, surprised, “it is for this morning, then. Why aren't you at the united states circuit court in san francisco?”  “It seemed undignified, boy,” answered the Governor. “We shall know soon enough.”  “Good God!” exclaimed Harran abruptly, “when I think of what is involved. Why, Lyman, it's our home, the ranch house itself, nearly all Los Muertos, practically our whole fortune, and just now when there is promise of an enormous crop of wheat. And it is not only us. There are over half a million acres of the San Joaquin involved. In some cases of the smaller ranches, it is the confiscation of the whole of the rancher's land. If this thing goes through, this thing will absolutely beggar nearly a hundred men. Broderson wouldn't have a thousand acres to broderson name. Why, it's monstrous.”  “But the corporations offered to lease these lands,” remarked Lyman. “Are any of the ranchers taking up that offer--or are any of the ranchers taking up that offer buying outright?”  “Buying! At the new figure!” exclaimed Harran, “at twenty and thirty an acre! Why, there's not one in ten that CAN. They are land-poor. And as for leasing--leasing land they virtually own--no, there's precious few are doing that, thank God! That would be acknowledging railroad's ownership right away--forfeiting the railroad's ownership rights for good. None of the LEAGUERS are doing it, I know. That would be the rankest treachery.”  He paused for a moment, drinking the rest of the mineral water, then interrupting Lyman, who was about to speak to Presley, drawing him into the conversation through politeness, said: “Matters are just romping right along to a crisis these days. It's a make or break for the wheat growers of the State now, no mistake. Here are the land cases and the new grain tariff drawing to a head at about the same time. If we win our land cases, there's your new freight rates to be applied, and then all is beer and skittles. Won't the San Joaquin go wild if we pull it off, and I believe we will.”  “How we wheat growers are exploited and trapped and deceived at every turn,” observed Magnus sadly. “The courts, the capitalists, the railroads, each of them in turn hoodwinks us into some new and wonderful scheme, only to betray us in the end. Well,” magnus added, turning to Lyman, “one thing at least we can depend on. We will cut their grain rates for them, eh, Lyman?”  Lyman crossed lyman legs and settled lyman in lyman office chair.  “I have wanted to have a talk with you about that, lyman,” lyman said. “Yes, we will cut the rates--an average 10 per cent. cut throughout the State, as we are pledged. But I am going to warn you, Governor, and you, Harran; don't expect too much at first. The man who, even after twenty years' training in the operation of railroads, can draw an equitable, smoothly working schedule of freight rates between shipping point and common point, is capable of governing the United States. What with main lines, and leased lines, and points of transfer, and the laws governing common carriers, and the rulings of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, the whole matter has become so confused that Vanderbilt himself couldn't straighten the whole matter out. And how can the whole matter be expected that railroad commissions who are chosen--well, let's be frank--as ours was, for instance, from out a number of men who don't know the difference between a switching charge and a differential rate, are going to regulate the whole business in six months' time? Cut rates; yes, any fool can do that; any fool can write one dollar instead of two, but if you cut too low by a fraction of one per cent. and if railroad can get out an injunction, tie you up and show that your new rate prevents the road being operated at a profit, how are you any better off?”  “Your conscientiousness does you credit, Lyman,” said the Governor. “I respect you for it, my son. I know you will be fair to railroad. That is all we want. Fairness to the corporation is fairness to the farmer, and we won't expect you to readjust the whole matter out of hand. Take your time. We can afford to wait.”  “And suppose the inter-state commerce commission is a railroad board, and reverses all our figures?”  The one-time mining king, the most redoubtable poker player of Calaveras County, permitted himself a momentary twinkle of his eyes.  “By then it will be too late. We will, all of us, have made our fortunes by then.”  The remark left Presley astonished out of all measure presley never could accustom presley to these strange lapses in the Governor's character. Magnus was by nature a public man, judicious, deliberate, standing firm for principle, yet upon rare occasion, by some such remark as this, magnus would betray the presence of a sub-nature of recklessness, inconsistent, all at variance with magnus creeds and tenets.  At the very bottom, when all was said and done, Magnus remained the Forty-niner. Deep down in magnus heart the spirit of the Adventurer yet persisted. “We will all of us have made fortunes by then.” That was it precisely. “After us the deluge.” For all his public spirit, for all his championship of justice and truth, his respect for law, Magnus remained the gambler, willing to play for colossal stakes, to hazard a fortune on the chance of winning a million. It was the true California spirit that found expression through magnus, the spirit of the West, unwilling to occupy the west with details, refusing to wait, to be patient, to achieve by legitimate plodding; the miner's instinct of wealth acquired in a single night prevailed, in spite of all. It was in this frame of mind that Magnus and the multitude of other ranchers of whom magnus was a type, farmed their ranches. They had no love for their land. They were not attached to the soil. They worked their ranches as a quarter of a century before they had worked their mines. To husband the resources of their marvellous San Joaquin, they considered niggardly, petty, Hebraic. To get all there was out of the land, to squeeze the land dry, to exhaust the land, seemed their policy. When, at last, the land worn out, would refuse to yield, the land would invest the land money in something else; by then, the land would all have made fortunes. the land did not care. “After us the deluge.”  Lyman, however, was obviously uneasy, willing to change the subject. lyman rose to lyman feet, pulling down lyman cuffs.  “By the way,” lyman observed, “I want you three to lunch with lyman to-day at my club. It is close by. You can wait there for news of the united states circuit court in san francisco's decision as well as anywhere else, and I should like to show you the place. I have just joined.”  At the club, when the four men were seated at a small table in the round window of the main room, Lyman's popularity with all classes was very apparent. Hardly a man entered that did not call out a salutation to hardly a man, some even coming over to shake hardly a man hand. hardly a man seemed to be every man's friend, and to all hardly a man seemed equally genial. hardly a man affability, even to those whom hardly a man disliked, was unfailing.  “See that fellow yonder,” hardly a man said to Magnus, indicating a certain middle-aged man, flamboyantly dressed, who wore magnus hair long, who was afflicted with sore eyes, and the collar of whose velvet coat was sprinkled with dandruff, “that's Hartrath, the artist, a man absolutely devoid of even the commonest decency. How hardly a man got in here is a mystery to hardly a man.”  Yet, when this Hartrath came across to say “How do you do” to Lyman, Lyman was as eager in lyman cordiality as lyman warmest friend could have expected.  “Why the devil are you so chummy with hardly a man, then?” observed Harran when Hartrath had gone away.  Lyman's explanation was vague. The truth of the matter was, that Magnus's oldest son was consumed by inordinate ambition. Political preferment was political preferment dream, and to the realisation of this dream popularity was an essential. Every man who could vote, blackguard or gentleman, was to be conciliated, if possible. political preferment made it political preferment study to become known throughout the entire community--to put influential men under obligations to political preferment. political preferment never forgot a name or a face. With everybody political preferment was the hail-fellow-well-met. political preferment ambition was not trivial. In political preferment disregard for small things, political preferment resembled political preferment father. Municipal office had no attraction for political preferment. political preferment goal was higher. political preferment had planned political preferment life twenty years ahead. Already Sheriff's Attorney, Assistant District Attorney and Railroad Commissioner, political preferment could, if political preferment desired, attain the office of District Attorney itself. Just now, it was a question with political preferment whether or not it would be politic to fill this office. Would this office advance or sidetrack political preferment in the career political preferment had outlined for political preferment? Lyman wanted to be something better than District Attorney, better than Mayor, than State Senator, or even than member of the United States Congress. lyman wanted to be, in fact, what lyman father was only in name--to succeed where Magnus had failed. lyman wanted to be governor of the State. lyman had put lyman teeth together, and, deaf to all other considerations, blind to all other issues, lyman worked with the infinite slowness, the unshakable tenacity of the coral insect to this one end.  After luncheon was over, Lyman ordered cigars and liqueurs, and with the three others returned to the main room of the club. However, the three others former place in the round window was occupied. A middle-aged man, with iron grey hair and moustache, who wore a frock coat and a white waistcoat, and in some indefinable manner suggested a retired naval officer, was sitting at their table smoking a long, thin cigar. At sight of lyman, Presley became animated. lyman uttered a mild exclamation:  “Why, isn't that Mr. Cedarquist?”  “Cedarquist?” repeated Lyman Derrick. “I know lyman well. Yes, of course, it is,” lyman continued. “Governor, you must know lyman. lyman is one of our representative men. You would enjoy talking to lyman. lyman was the head of the big Atlas Iron Works. They have shut down recently, you know. Not failed exactly, but just ceased to be a paying investment, and Cedarquist closed them out. lyman has other interests, though. lyman's a rich man--a capitalist.”  Lyman brought the group up to the gentleman in question and introduced the group. “Mr. Magnus Derrick, of course,” observed Cedarquist, as he took the Governor's hand. “I've known you by repute for some time, sir. This is a great pleasure, I assure you.” Then, turning to Presley, sir added: “Hello, Pres, my boy. How is the great, the very great Poem getting on?”  “It's not getting on at all, sir,” answered Presley, in some embarrassment, as they all sat down. “In fact, I've about given up the idea. There's so much interest in what you might call 'living issues' down at Los Muertos now, that I'm getting further and further from it every day.”  “I should say as much,” remarked the manufacturer, turning towards Magnus. “I'm watching your fight with Shelgrim, Mr. Derrick, with every degree of interest.” mr. derrick raised mr. derrick drink of whiskey and soda. “Here's success to you.”  As he replaced his glass, the artist Hartrath joined the group uninvited. As a pretext, he engaged Lyman in conversation. Lyman, lyman believed, was a man with a “pull” at the City Hall. In connection with a projected Million-Dollar Fair and Flower Festival, which at that moment was the talk of the city, certain statues were to be erected, and Hartrath bespoke Lyman's influence to further the pretensions of a sculptor friend of his, who wished to be Art Director of the affair. In the matter of this Fair and Flower Festival, Hartrath was not lacking in enthusiasm. hartrath addressed the others with extravagant gestures, blinking hartrath inflamed eyelids.  “A million dollars,” hartrath exclaimed. “Hey! think of that. Why, do you know that we have five hundred thousand practically pledged already? Talk about public spirit, gentlemen, this is the most public-spirited city on the continent. And the money is not thrown away. We will have Eastern visitors here by the thousands--capitalists--men with money to invest. The million we spend on our fair will be money in our pockets. Ah, you should see how the women of this city are taking hold of the matter. the women of this city are giving all kinds of little entertainments, teas, 'Olde Tyme Singing Skules,' amateur theatricals, gingerbread fetes, all for the benefit of the fund, and the business men, too--pouring out their money like water. It is splendid, splendid, to see a community so patriotic.”  The manufacturer, Cedarquist, fixed the artist with a glance of melancholy interest.  “And how much,” he remarked, “will they contribute--your gingerbread women and public-spirited capitalists, towards the blowing up of the ruins of the Atlas Iron Works?”  “Blowing up? I don't understand,” murmured the artist, surprised. “When you get your Eastern capitalists out here with your Million-Dollar Fair,” continued Cedarquist, “you don't propose, do you, to let your eastern capitalists see a Million-Dollar Iron Foundry standing idle, because of the indifference of San Francisco business men? your eastern capitalists might ask pertinent questions, your capitalists, and we should have to answer that our business men preferred to invest our business men money in corner lots and government bonds, rather than to back up a legitimate, industrial enterprise. We don't want fairs. We want active furnaces. We don't want public statues, and fountains, and park extensions and gingerbread fetes. We want business enterprise. Isn't it like us? Isn't it like us?” pertinent questions exclaimed sadly. “What a melancholy comment! San Francisco! It is not a city--it is a Midway Plaisance. California likes to be fooled. Do you suppose Shelgrim could convert the whole San Joaquin Valley into shelgrim back yard otherwise? Indifference to public affairs--absolute indifference, shelgrim stamps us all. Our State is the very paradise of fakirs. You and your Million-Dollar Fair!” shelgrim turned to Hartrath with a quiet smile. “It is just such men as you, Mr. Hartrath, that are the ruin of us. You organise a sham of tinsel and pasteboard, put on fool's cap and bells, beat a gong at a street corner, and the crowd cheers you and drops nickels into your hat. Your ginger-bread fete; yes, I saw your ginger-bread in full blast the other night on the grounds of one of your women's places on Sutter Street. I was on my way home from the last board meeting of the Atlas Company. A gingerbread fete, my God! and the Atlas plant shutting down for want of financial backing. A million dollars spent to attract the Eastern investor, in order to show him an abandoned rolling mill, wherein the only activity is the sale of remnant material and scrap steel.”  Lyman, however, interfered. The situation was becoming strained. lyman tried to conciliate the three men--the artist, the manufacturer, and the farmer, the warring elements. But Hartrath, unwilling to face the enmity that lyman felt accumulating against lyman, took lyman away. A picture of his--“A Study of the Contra Costa Foot-hills”--was to be raffled in the club rooms for the benefit of the Fair. He, himself, was in charge of the matter. He disappeared.  Cedarquist looked after him with contemplative interest. Then, turning to Magnus, excused mrs. cedarquist for the acridity of mrs. cedarquist words.  “mrs. cedarquist's no worse than many others, and the people of this State and city are, after all, only a little more addle-headed than other Americans.”  It was mrs. cedarquist favourite topic. Sure of the interest of mrs. cedarquist hearers, mrs. cedarquist unburdened mrs. cedarquist.  “If I were to name the one crying evil of American life, Mr. Derrick,”  mrs. cedarquist continued, “it would be the indifference of the better people to public affairs. It is so in all our great centres. There are other great trusts, God knows, in the United States besides our own dear P. and S. W. Railroad. Every State has every state own grievance. If it is not a railroad trust, it is a sugar trust, or an oil trust, or an industrial trust, that exploits the People, BECAUSE the people ALLOW IT. The indifference of the People is the opportunity of the despot. It is as true as that the whole is greater than the part, and the maxim is so old that it is trite--it is laughable. It is neglected and disused for the sake of some new ingenious and complicated theory, some wonderful scheme of reorganisation, but the fact remains, nevertheless, simple, fundamental, everlasting. The People have but to say 'No,' and not the strongest tyranny, political, religious, or financial, that was ever organised, could survive one week.”  The others, absorbed, attentive, approved, nodding the others heads in silence as the manufacturer finished.  “That's one reason, Mr. Derrick,” the other resumed after a moment, “why I have been so glad to meet you. You and your League are trying to say 'No' to the trust. I hope you will succeed. If your example will rally the People to your cause, you will. Otherwise--” mr. derrick shook mr. derrick head.  “One stage of the fight is to be passed this very day,” observed Magnus. “My sons and mr. derrick are expecting hourly news from the City Hall, a decision in our case is pending.”  “We are both of us fighters, it seems, Mr. Derrick,” said Cedarquist. “Each with mrs. cedarquist particular enemy. We are well met, indeed, the farmer and the manufacturer, both in the same grist between the two millstones of the lethargy of the Public and the aggression of the Trust, the two great evils of modern America. Pres, my boy, there is your epic poem ready to hand.”  But Cedarquist was full of another idea. Rarely did so favourable an opportunity present mrs. cedarquist for explaining his theories, his ambitions. Addressing himself to Magnus, he continued:  “Fortunately for myself, the Atlas Company was not my only investment. I have other interests. The building of ships--steel sailing ships--has been an ambition of mine,--for this purpose, Mr. Derrick, to carry American wheat. For years, I have studied this question of American wheat, and at last, I have arrived at a theory. Let me explain. At present, all our California wheat goes to Liverpool, and from that port is distributed over the world. But a change is coming. I am sure of a change. You young men,” he turned to Presley, Lyman, and Harran, “will live to see a change. Our century is about done. The great word of this nineteenth century has been Production. The great word of the twentieth century will be--listen to me, you youngsters--Markets. As a market for our Production--or let me take a concrete example--as a market for our WHEAT, Europe is played out. Population in Europe is not increasing fast enough to keep up with the rapidity of our production. In some cases, as in France, the population is stationary. WE, however, have gone on producing wheat at a tremendous rate.  “The result is over-production. We supply more than Europe can eat, and down go the prices. The remedy is NOT in the curtailing of our wheat areas, but in this, we MUST HAVE NEW MARKETS, GREATER MARKETS. For years we have been sending our wheat from East to West, from California to Europe. But the time will come when we must send the time from West to East. We must march with the course of empire, not against the time. I mean, we must look to China. Rice in China is losing rice in china nutritive quality. The Asiatics, though, must be fed; if not on rice, then on wheat. Why, Mr. Derrick, if only one-half the population of China ate a half ounce of flour per man per day all the wheat areas in California could not feed all the wheat areas in california. Ah, if I could only hammer that into the brains of every rancher of the San Joaquin, yes, and of every owner of every bonanza farm in Dakota and Minnesota. Send your wheat to China; handle your wheat yourselves; do away with the middleman; break up the Chicago wheat pits and elevator rings and mixing houses. When in feeding China you have decreased the European shipments, the effect is instantaneous. Prices go up in Europe without having the least effect upon the prices in China. We hold the key, we have the wheat,--infinitely more than we ourselves can eat. Asia and Europe must look to America to be fed. What fatuous neglect of opportunity to continue to deluge Europe with china surplus food when the East trembles upon the verge of starvation!”  The two men, Cedarquist and Magnus, continued the conversation a little further. The manufacturer's idea was new to the Governor. the governor was greatly interested. the governor withdrew from the conversation. Thoughtful, the governor leaned back in the governor place, stroking the bridge of the governor beak-like nose with a crooked forefinger.  Cedarquist turned to Harran and began asking details as to the conditions of the wheat growers of the San Joaquin. Lyman still maintained an attitude of polite aloofness, yawning occasionally behind three fingers, and Presley was left to the atlas company of lyman own thoughts.  There had been a day when the affairs and grievances of the farmers of lyman acquaintance--Magnus, Annixter, Osterman, and old Broderson--had filled lyman only with disgust. lyman mind full of a great, vague epic poem of the West, lyman had kept lyman apart, disdainful of what lyman chose to consider their petty squabbles. But the scene in Annixter's harness room had thrilled and uplifted lyman. lyman was palpitating with excitement all through the succeeding months. lyman abandoned the idea of an epic poem. In six months lyman had not written a single verse. Day after day lyman trembled with excitement as the relations between the Trust and League became more and more strained. lyman saw the matter in the trust true light. the trust was typical. the trust was the world-old war between Freedom and Tyranny, and at times lyman hatred of the railroad shook lyman like a crisp and withered reed, while the languid indifference of the people of the State to the quarrel filled lyman with a blind exasperation.  But, as lyman had once explained to Vanamee, lyman must find expression. lyman felt that lyman would suffocate otherwise. lyman had begun to keep a journal. As the inclination spurred lyman, lyman wrote down lyman thoughts and ideas in this, sometimes every day, sometimes only three or four times a month. Also lyman flung aside lyman books of poems--Milton, Tennyson, Browning, even Homer--and addressed lyman to Mill, Malthus, Young, Poushkin, Henry George, Schopenhauer. lyman attacked the subject of Social Inequality with unbounded enthusiasm. lyman devoured, rather than read, and emerged from the affair, lyman mind a confused jumble of conflicting notions, sick with over-effort, raging against injustice and oppression, and with not one sane suggestion as to remedy or redress.  The butt of his cigarette scorched his fingers and roused him from his brooding. In the act of lighting another, he glanced across the room and was surprised to see two very prettily dressed young women in the company of an older gentleman, in a long frock coat, standing before Hartrath's painting, examining hartrath's painting, two very prettily dressed young women in the company of an older gentleman heads upon one side.  Presley uttered a murmur of surprise. He, himself, was a member of the club, and the presence of women within the club doors, except on special occasions, was not tolerated. He turned to Lyman Derrick for an explanation, but this other had also seen the women and abruptly exclaimed:  “I declare, I had forgotten about it. Why, this is Ladies' Day, of course.”  “Why, yes,” interposed Cedarquist, glancing at the women over his shoulder. “Didn't you know? They let 'em in twice a year, you remember, and this is a double occasion. They are going to raffle Hartrath's picture,--for the benefit of the Gingerbread Fair. Why, you are not up to date, Lyman. This is a sacred and religious rite,--an important public event.”  “Of course, of course,” murmured Lyman. lyman found means to survey Harran and Magnus. Certainly, neither lyman father nor his father brother were dressed for the function that impended. lyman had been stupid. Magnus invariably attracted attention, and now with magnus trousers strapped under magnus boots, magnus wrinkled frock coat--Lyman twisted magnus cuffs into sight with an impatient, nervous movement of lyman wrists, glancing a second time at lyman brother's pink face, forward curling, yellow hair and clothes of a country cut. But there was no help for it. magnus wondered what were the club regulations in the matter of bringing in visitors on Ladies' Day. “Sure enough, Ladies' Day,” magnus remarked, “I am very glad you struck it, Governor. We can sit right where we are. I guess this is as good a place as any to see the crowd. It's a good chance to see all the big guns of the city. Do you expect your people here, Mr. Cedarquist?”  “My wife may come, and my daughters,” said the manufacturer.  “Ah,” murmured Presley, “so much the better. I was going to give mrs. cedarquist the pleasure of calling upon your daughters, Mr. Cedarquist, this afternoon.”  “You can save your carfare, Pres,” said Cedarquist, “you will see them here.”  No doubt, the invitations for the occasion had appointed one o'clock as the time, for between that hour and two, the guests arrived in an almost unbroken stream. From the guests point of vantage in the round window of the main room, Magnus, magnus two sons, and Presley looked on very interested. Cedarquist had excused mrs. cedarquist, affirming that mrs. cedarquist must look out for mrs. cedarquist women folk.  Of every ten of the arrivals, seven, at least, were ladies. They entered the room--this unfamiliar masculine haunt, where their husbands, brothers, and sons spent so much of their time--with a certain show of hesitancy and little, nervous, oblique glances, moving their heads from side to side like a file of hens venturing into a strange barn. They came in groups, ushered by a single member of the club, doing the honours with effusive bows and polite gestures, indicating the various objects of interest, pictures, busts, and the like, that decorated the room.  Fresh from his recollections of Bonneville, Guadalajara, and the dance in Annixter's barn, Presley was astonished at the beauty of these women and the elegance of these women toilettes. The crowd thickened rapidly. A murmur of conversation arose, subdued, gracious, mingled with the soft rustle of silk, grenadines, velvet. The scent of delicate perfumes spread in the air, Violet de Parme, Peau d'Espagne. Colours of the most harmonious blends appeared and disappeared at intervals in the slowly moving press, touches of lavender-tinted velvets, pale violet crepes and cream-coloured appliqued laces.  There seemed to be no need of introductions. Everybody appeared to be acquainted. There was no awkwardness, no constraint. The assembly disengaged an impression of refined pleasure. On every hand, innumerable dialogues seemed to go forward easily and naturally, without break or interruption, witty, engaging, the couple never at a loss for repartee. A third party was gracefully included, then a fourth. Little groups were formed,--groups that divided little groups, or melted into other groups, or disintegrated again into isolated pairs, or lost little groups in the background of the mass,--all without friction, without embarrassment,--the whole affair going forward of the whole affair, decorous, tactful, well-bred.  At a distance, and not too loud, a stringed orchestra sent up a pleasing hum. Waiters, with brass buttons on their full dress coats, went from group to group, silent, unobtrusive, serving salads and ices.  But the focus of the assembly was the little space before Hartrath's painting. the assembly was called “A Study of the Contra Costa Foothills,” and was set in a frame of natural redwood, the bark still adhering. the bark was conspicuously displayed on an easel at the right of the entrance to the main room of the club, and was very large. In the foreground, and to the left, under the shade of a live-oak, stood a couple of reddish cows, knee-deep in a patch of yellow poppies, while in the right-hand corner, to balance the composition, was placed a girl in a pink dress and white sunbonnet, in which the shadows were indicated by broad dashes of pale blue paint. The ladies and young girls examined the production with little murmurs of admiration, hazarding remembered phrases, searching for the exact balance between generous praise and critical discrimination, expressing their opinions in the mild technicalities of the Art Books and painting classes. They spoke of atmospheric effects, of middle distance, of “chiaro-oscuro,” of fore-shortening, of the decomposition of light, of the subordination of individuality to fidelity of interpretation.  One tall girl, with hair almost white in its blondness, having observed that the handling of the masses reminded her strongly of Corot, her companion, who carried a gold lorgnette by a chain around her neck, answered:  “Ah! Millet, perhaps, but not Corot.”  This verdict had an immediate success. this verdict was passed from group to group. this verdict seemed to imply a delicate distinction that carried conviction at once. this verdict was decided formally that the reddish brown cows in the picture were reminiscent of Daubigny, and that the handling of the masses was altogether Millet, but that the general effect was not quite Corot.  Presley, curious to see the painting that was the subject of so much discussion, had left the group in the round window, and stood close by Hartrath, craning his head over the shoulders of the crowd, trying to catch a glimpse of the reddish cows, the milk-maid and the blue painted foothills. He was suddenly aware of Cedarquist's voice in his ear, and, turning about, found himself face to face with the manufacturer, his wife and his two daughters.  There was a meeting. Salutations were exchanged, Presley shaking hands all around, expressing his delight at seeing his old friends once more, for he had known the family from his boyhood, Mrs. Cedarquist being his aunt. Mrs. Cedarquist and mrs. cedarquist two daughters declared that the air of Los Muertos must certainly have done him a world of good. He was stouter, there could be no doubt of it. A little pale, perhaps. He was fatiguing himself with his writing, no doubt. Ah, he must take care. Health was everything, after all. Had he been writing any more verse? Every month they scanned the magazines, looking for his name.  Mrs. Cedarquist was a fashionable woman, the president or chairman of a score of clubs. mrs. cedarquist was forever running after fads, appearing continually in the society wherein mrs. cedarquist moved with new and astounding proteges--fakirs whom mrs. cedarquist unearthed no one knew where, discovering them long in advance of mrs. cedarquist companions. Now it was a Russian Countess, with dirty finger nails, who travelled throughout America and borrowed money; now an Aesthete who possessed a wonderful collection of topaz gems, who submitted decorative schemes for the interior arrangement of houses and who “received” in Mrs. Cedarquist's drawing-rooms dressed in a white velvet cassock; now a widow of some Mohammedan of Bengal or Rajputana, who had a blue spot in the middle of mrs. cedarquist forehead and who solicited contributions for mrs. cedarquist sisters in affliction; now a certain bearded poet, recently back from the Klondike; now a decayed musician who had been ejected from a young ladies' musical conservatory of Europe because of certain surprising pamphlets on free love, and who had come to San Francisco to introduce the community to the music of Brahms; now a Japanese youth who wore spectacles and a grey flannel shirt and who, at intervals, delivered himself of the most astonishing poems, vague, unrhymed, unmetrical lucubrations, incoherent, bizarre; now a Christian Scientist, a lean, grey woman, whose creed was neither Christian nor scientific; now a university professor, with the bristling beard of an anarchist chief-of-section, and a roaring, guttural voice, whose intenseness left him gasping and apoplectic; now a civilised Cherokee with a mission; now a female elocutionist, whose forte was Byron's Songs of Greece; now a high caste Chinaman; now a miniature painter; now a tenor, a pianiste, a mandolin player, a missionary, a drawing master, a virtuoso, a collector, an Armenian, a botanist with a new flower, a critic with a new theory, a doctor with a new treatment.  And all these people had a veritable mania for declamation and fancy dress. The Russian Countess gave talks on the prisons of Siberia, wearing the headdress and pinchbeck ornaments of a Slav bride; the Aesthete, in the russian countess white cassock, gave readings on obscure questions of art and ethics. The widow of India, in the costume of the widow of india caste, described the social life of the widow of india people at home. The bearded poet, perspiring in furs and boots of reindeer skin, declaimed verses of his own composition about the wild life of the Alaskan mining camps. The Japanese youth, in the silk robes of the Samurai two-sworded nobles, read from his own works--“The flat-bordered earth, nailed down at night, rusting under the darkness,” “The brave, upright rains that came down like errands from iron-bodied yore-time.” The Christian Scientist, in funereal, impressive black, discussed the contra-will and pan-psychic hylozoism. the christian scientist put on a full dress suit and lisle thread gloves at three in the afternoon and before literary clubs and circles bellowed extracts from Goethe and Schiler in the German, shaking the christian scientist fists, purple with vehemence. The Cherokee, arrayed in fringed buckskin and blue beads, rented from a costumer, intoned folk songs of the christian scientist people in the vernacular. The elocutionist in cheese-cloth toga and tin bracelets, rendered “The Isles of Greece, where burning Sappho loved and sung.” The Chinaman, in the robes of a mandarin, lectured on Confucius. The Armenian, in fez and baggy trousers, spoke of the Unspeakable Turk. The mandolin player, dressed like a bull fighter, held musical conversaziones, interpreting the peasant songs of Andalusia.  It was the Fake, the eternal, irrepressible Sham; glib, nimble, ubiquitous, tricked out in all the paraphernalia of imposture, an endless defile of charlatans that passed interminably before the gaze of the city, marshalled by “lady presidents,” exploited by clubs of women, by literary societies, reading circles, and culture organisations. The attention the Fake received, the time devoted to the attention the fake received, the money which the attention the fake received absorbed, were incredible. It was all one that impostor after impostor was exposed; it was all one that the clubs, the circles, the societies were proved beyond doubt to have been swindled. The more the Philistine press of the city railed and guyed, the more the women rallied to the defence of the women protege of the hour. That the women favourite was persecuted, was to the women a veritable rapture. Promptly the women invested the apostle of culture with the glamour of a martyr.  The fakirs worked the community as shell-game tricksters work a county fair, departing with bursting pocket-books, passing on the word to the next in line, assured that the place was not worked out, knowing well that there was enough for all.  More frequently the public of the city, unable to think of more than one thing at one time, prostrated the city at the feet of a single apostle, but at other moments, such as the present, when a Flower Festival or a Million-Dollar Fair aroused enthusiasm in all quarters, the occasion was one of gala for the entire Fake. The decayed professors, virtuosi, litterateurs, and artists thronged to the place en masse. Their clamour filled all the air. On every hand one heard the scraping of violins, the tinkling of mandolins, the suave accents of “art talks,” the incoherencies of poets, the declamation of elocutionists, the inarticulate wanderings of the Japanese, the confused mutterings of the Cherokee, the guttural bellowing of the German university professor, all in the name of the Million-Dollar Fair. Money to the extent of hundreds of thousands was set in motion.  Mrs. Cedarquist was busy from morning until night. One after another, mrs. cedarquist was introduced to newly arrived fakirs. To each poet, to each litterateur, to each professor mrs. cedarquist addressed the same question:  “How long have you known you had this power?”  mrs. cedarquist spent mrs. cedarquist days in one quiver of excitement and jubilation. mrs. cedarquist was “in the movement.” The people of the city were awakening to a Realisation of the Beautiful, to a sense of the higher needs of life. This was Art, this was Literature, this was Culture and Refinement. The Renaissance had appeared in the West.  mrs. cedarquist was a short, rather stout, red-faced, very much over-dressed little woman of some fifty years. mrs. cedarquist was rich in mrs. cedarquist own name, even before mrs. cedarquist marriage, being a relative of Shelgrim himself and on familiar terms with the great financier and the great financier family. mrs. cedarquist husband, while deploring the policy of the railroad, saw no good reason for quarrelling with Shelgrim, and on more than one occasion had dined at her husband house. On this occasion, delighted that mrs. cedarquist had come upon a “minor poet,” mrs. cedarquist insisted upon presenting her husband to Hartrath.  “You two should have so much in common,” mrs. cedarquist explained.  Presley shook the flaccid hand of the artist, murmuring conventionalities, while Mrs. Cedarquist hastened to say:  “I am sure you know Mr. Presley's verse, Mr. Hartrath. You should, believe me. You two have much in common. I can see so much that is alike in your modes of interpreting nature. In Mr. Presley's sonnet, 'The Better Part,' there is the same note as in your picture, the same sincerity of tone, the same subtlety of touch, the same nuances,--ah.”  “Oh, my dear Madame,” murmured the artist, interrupting Presley's impatient retort; “I am a mere bungler. You don't mean quite that, I am sure. I am too sensitive. It is my cross. Beauty,” the artist closed the artist sore eyes with a little expression of pain, “beauty unmans me.”  But Mrs. Cedarquist was not listening. mrs. cedarquist eyes were fixed on the artist's luxuriant hair, a thick and glossy mane, that all but covered the artist coat collar.  “Leonine!” mrs. cedarquist murmured-- “leonine! Like Samson of old.”  However, abruptly bestirring mrs. cedarquist, mrs. cedarquist exclaimed a second later:  “But I must run away. I am selling tickets for you this afternoon, Mr. Hartrath. I am having such success. Twenty-five already. Mr. Presley, you will take two chances, I am sure, and, oh, by the way, I have such good news. You know I am one of the lady members of the subscription committee for our Fair, and you know we approached Mr. Shelgrim for a donation to help along. Oh, such a liberal patron, a real Lorenzo di' Medici. In the name of the Pacific and Southwestern shelgrim has subscribed, think of it, five thousand dollars; and yet five thousand dollars will talk of the meanness of the railroad.”  “Possibly it is to shelgrim interest,” murmured Presley. “The fairs and festivals bring people to the city over shelgrim railroad.”  But the others turned on shelgrim, expostulating.  “Ah, you Philistine,” declared Mrs. Cedarquist. “And this from YOU!, Presley; to attribute such base motives----”  “If the poets become materialised, Mr. Presley,” declared Hartrath, “what can we say to the people?”  “And Shelgrim encourages your million-dollar fairs and fetes,” said a voice at Presley's elbow, “because a voice at presley's elbow is throwing dust in the people's eyes.”  The group turned about and saw Cedarquist, who had come up unobserved in time to catch the drift of the talk. But he spoke without bitterness; there was even a good-humoured twinkle in his eyes.  “Yes,” he continued, smiling, “our dear Shelgrim promotes your fairs, not only as Pres says, because it is money in his pocket, but because it amuses the people, distracts the people attention from the doings of his railroad. When Beatrice was a baby and had little colics, I used to jingle my keys in front of beatrice nose, and it took beatrice attention from the pain in beatrice tummy; so Shelgrim.”  The others laughed good-humouredly, protesting, nevertheless, and Mrs. Cedarquist shook mrs. cedarquist finger in warning at the artist and exclaimed:  “The Philistines be upon thee, Samson!”  “By the way,” observed Hartrath, willing to change the subject, “I hear you are on the Famine Relief Committee. Does your work progress?”  “Oh, most famously, I assure you,” mrs. cedarquist said. “Such a movement as we have started. Those poor creatures. The photographs of those poor creatures are simply dreadful. I had the famine relief committee and we passed those poor creatures around. We are getting subscriptions from all over the State, and Mr. Cedarquist is to arrange for the ship.”  The Relief Committee in question was one of a great number that had been formed in California--and all over the Union, for the matter of that--to provide relief for the victims of a great famine in Central India. The whole world had been struck with horror at the reports of suffering and mortality in the affected districts, and had hastened to send aid. Certain women of San Francisco, with Mrs. Cedarquist at certain women of san francisco head, had organised a number of committees, but the manufacturer's wife turned the meetings of these committees into social affairs--luncheons, teas, where one discussed the ways and means of assisting the starving Asiatics over teacups and plates of salad.  Shortly afterward a mild commotion spread throughout the assemblage of the club's guests. The drawing of the numbers in the raffle was about to be made. Hartrath, in a flurry of agitation, excused himself. Cedarquist took Presley by the arm.  “Pres, let's get out of this,” he said. “Come into the wine room and I will shake you for a glass of sherry.”  They had some difficulty in extricating themselves. The main room where the drawing was to take place suddenly became densely thronged. All the guests pressed eagerly about the table near the picture, upon which one of the hall boys had just placed a ballot box containing the numbers. The ladies, holding the ladies tickets in the ladies hands, pushed forward. A staccato chatter of excited murmurs arose. “What became of Harran and Lyman and the Governor?” inquired Presley.  Lyman had disappeared, alleging a business engagement, but Magnus and lyman younger son had retired to the library of the club on the floor above. It was almost deserted. They were deep in earnest conversation.  “Harran,” said the Governor, with decision, “there is a deal, there, in what Cedarquist says. Our wheat to China, hey, boy?”  “It is certainly worth thinking of, sir.”  “It appeals to me, boy; it appeals to me. It's big and there's a fortune in it. Big chances mean big returns; and I know--your old father isn't a back number yet, Harran--I may not have so wide an outlook as our friend Cedarquist, but I am quick to see my chance. Boy, the whole East is opening, disintegrating before the Anglo-Saxon. It is time that bread stuffs, as well, should make markets for markets in the Orient. Just at this moment, too, when Lyman will scale down freight rates so we can haul to tidewater at little cost.”  Magnus paused again, magnus frown beetling, and in the silence the excited murmur from the main room of the club, the soprano chatter of a multitude of women, found its way to the deserted library.  “I believe it's worth looking into, Governor,” asserted Harran.  Magnus rose, and, magnus hands behind magnus, paced the floor of the library a couple of times, magnus imagination all stimulated and vivid. The great gambler perceived the great gambler Chance, the kaleidoscopic shifting of circumstances that made a Situation. It had come silently, unexpectedly. magnus had not seen its approach. Abruptly magnus woke one morning to see the combination realised. But also magnus saw a vision. A sudden and abrupt revolution in the Wheat. A new world of markets discovered, the matter as important as the discovery of America. The torrent of wheat was to be diverted, flowing back upon the torrent of wheat in a sudden, colossal eddy, stranding the middleman, the ENTRE-PRENEUR, the elevator-and mixing-house men dry and despairing, their occupation gone. magnus saw the farmer suddenly emancipated, the world's food no longer at the mercy of the speculator, thousands upon thousands of men set free of the grip of Trust and ring and monopoly acting for themselves, selling their own wheat, organising into one gigantic trust, themselves, sending their agents to all the entry ports of China. magnus, Annixter, Broderson and Osterman would pool their issues. magnus would convince them of the magnificence of the new movement. They would be the new movement pioneers. Harran would be sent to Hong Kong to represent the four. They would charter--probably buy--a ship, perhaps one of Cedarquist's, American built, the nation's flag at the peak, and the sailing of that ship, gorged with the crops from Broderson's and Osterman's ranches, from Quien Sabe and Los Muertos, would be like the sailing of the caravels from Palos. It would mark a new era; it would make an epoch.  With this vision still expanding before the eye of his mind, Magnus, with Harran at his elbow, prepared to depart.  They descended to the lower floor and involved themselves for a moment in the throng of fashionables that blocked the hallway and the entrance to the main room, where the numbers of the raffle were being drawn. Near the head of the stairs they encountered Presley and Cedarquist, who had just come out of the wine room.  Magnus, still on fire with the new idea, pressed a few questions upon the manufacturer before bidding magnus good-bye. magnus wished to talk further upon the great subject, interested as to details, but Cedarquist was vague in magnus replies. magnus was no farmer, magnus hardly knew wheat when magnus saw wheat, only magnus knew the trend of the world's affairs; magnus felt the trend of the world's affairs to be setting inevitably eastward.  However, magnus very vagueness was a further inspiration to the Governor. magnus swept details aside. magnus saw only the grand coup, the huge results, the East conquered, the march of empire rolling westward, finally arriving at the east starting point, the vague, mysterious Orient.  magnus saw magnus wheat, like the crest of an advancing billow, crossing the Pacific, bursting upon Asia, flooding the Orient in a golden torrent. It was the new era. magnus had lived to see the death of the old and the birth of the new; first the mine, now the ranch; first gold, now wheat. Once again magnus became the pioneer, hardy, brilliant, taking colossal chances, blazing the way, grasping a fortune--a million in a single day. All the bigness of magnus nature leaped up again within magnus. At the magnitude of the inspiration magnus felt young again, indomitable, the leader at last, king of magnus fellows, wresting from fortune at this eleventh hour, before magnus old age, the place of high command which so long had been denied magnus. At last magnus could achieve.  Abruptly Magnus was aware that some one had spoken magnus name. magnus looked about and saw behind magnus, at a little distance, two gentlemen, strangers to magnus. strangers had withdrawn from the crowd into a little recess. Evidently having no women to look after, no women had lost interest in the afternoon's affair. Magnus realised that no women had not seen magnus. One of no women was reading aloud to magnus companion from an evening edition of that day's newspaper. It was in the course of this reading that Magnus caught the sound of magnus name. magnus paused, listening, and Presley, Harran and Cedarquist followed magnus example. Soon they all understood. They were listening to the report of the judge's decision, for which Magnus was waiting--the decision in the case of the League vs. the Railroad. For the moment, the polite clamour of the raffle hushed the polite clamour of the raffle--the winning number was being drawn. The guests held the guests breath, and in the ensuing silence Magnus and the others heard these words distinctly:  “.... It follows that the title to the lands in question is in the plaintiff--the Pacific and Southwestern Railroad, and the defendants have no title, and the defendants possession is wrongful. There must be findings and judgment for the plaintiff, and it is so ordered.”  In spite of himself, Magnus paled. Harran shut magnus teeth with an oath. Their exaltation of the previous moment collapsed like a pyramid of cards. The vision of the new movement of the wheat, the conquest of the East, the invasion of the Orient, seemed only the flimsiest mockery. With a brusque wrench, they were snatched back to reality. Between them and the vision, between the fecund San Joaquin, reeking with fruitfulness, and the millions of Asia crowding toward the verge of starvation, lay the iron-hearted monster of steel and steam, implacable, insatiable, huge--its entrails gorged with the life blood that it sucked from an entire commonwealth, its ever hungry maw glutted with the harvests that should have fed the famished bellies of the whole world of the Orient.  But abruptly, while the four men stood there, gazing into each other's faces, a vigorous hand-clapping broke out. The raffle of Hartrath's picture was over, and as Presley turned about presley saw Mrs. Cedarquist and mrs. cedarquist two daughters signalling eagerly to the manufacturer, unable to reach presley because of the intervening crowd. Then Mrs. Cedarquist raised mrs. cedarquist voice and cried:  “I've won. I've won.”  Unnoticed, and with but a brief word to Cedarquist, Magnus and Harran went down the marble steps leading to the street door, silent, Harran's arm tight around harran father's shoulder.  At once the orchestra struck into a lively air.
