If Poe Were Alive! 

T HERE is no doubt whatever that Edgar Allan Poe would be a con- 
tributor to WEIRD TALES if he were alive today. The brilliant 
success of WEIRD TALES has been built upon tales of the grotesque and 
terrible, such as that great American fictionist used to write; tales that 
send eery shivers up the spine; tales of the spaces between the worlds; 
weird- scientific stories that peer into the marvels of the future; goosetlesh 
tales, and tales of the supernatural; stories that are utterly strange, artfully 
written tales, that take the reader into a deathless world of the imagina- 
tion. Among the many thrilling stories in the next few issues will be; 

EXPLORERS INTO INFINITY, by Ray Cummings 

The strangest, weirdest, most original interplanetary story ever penned ; 
blazing suns, whole starry universes flash through this fascinating tale; 
giants dwindling out of unfathomable largeness — beings so big that a second 
of their time takes whole years of Earthly' measure. 

THE ARCTIC DEATH, by Wilford Allen 

Out of the North it came, that dread death that touched every living 
thing:' with a killing cold — till a great scientist went forth to fight it. 

THE ENDOCRINE MONSTER, by R. Anthony 

She dwelt alone and unharmed by a South American river, a beautiful girl, 
affable and well-liked; but those who came too near her cabin were left 
in the jungle with the life crushed out of their bodies. 

EVOLUTION ISLAND, by Edmond Hamilton 

A spawning horror was loosed on the world, threatening to wipe out all 
life upon the Earth, both animal and human — a gripping weird-science 
tale by the author of “The Metal Giants” and “The Atomic Conquerors.” 

THE BLOOD-FLOWER, by Seabury Quinn 

Here is a thrilling present-day story of lycanthropy, which shows the 
fascinating little French scientist, Jules de Grandin, in a weird adventure. 

THE CASTLE OF TAMARA, by Maria Moravsky 

A weird romance of the Caucasus Mountains, through which runs an 
eldritch thread of horror — a dramatic love-tale, replete with eery thrills. 

THE DARK CHRYSALIS, by Eli Colter 

Here we have, at last, the epic of the microbe-hunters — a scientific 
tale of gripping interest and dramatic suspense built around the 
scourge of cancer — by the author of “The Last Horror.”

Suddenly 1 Broke Away 



and Held Them Spellbound 



As I review that tense dramatic moment when I electrified that meeting, it all seems 
strange and weird to me. How had fi changed so miraculously in three months from 
a shy, diffident “yes” man to a dynamic, vigorous he-man? How had I ever dared 
give my opinion? Three months before nobody ever knew 1 held opinions! 



A LL my life I had been cursed with a shy, timid, 
self-conscious nature. With only a grammar school 
education I could never express ideas in a coherent, 
self-confident way. But one day my eye fell upon a 
newspaper article which told about a wonderful free 
book entitled “How to Work Wonders with Words" — 
a book that was causing widespread comment from 
coast to coast — a book that was being read not only 
by millionaires, but by thousands of others. It dis- 
cussed men like me and explained how we could over- 
come our handicaps. 

At first I was skeptical. I thought these defects 
were a part of my natural makeup — that I would 
never be able to overcome them. But some subtle 
instinct kept prodding me to send for that free book. 
I lost no time in sending for it. as I was positively 
amazed at being able to get cost free a book that 
made absolutely plain the secrets that most successful 
men have used to win popularity, distinction, money 
and success* 

As the weeks wore on and I absorbed the principles 
of this remarkable method, I became conscious of new 
physical and mental energy, a new feeling of aggres- 
siveness, and a resurrected personal power that , I 
never dreamed I possessed. Then came that day in 
the general meeting when the president called on- the 
assembled department heads and assistants for sug- 
gestions on the proposed new policy. 

Three months previously, the forces of indecision, 
timidity, and inability to talk in public would have 
held me to my seat. But suddenly that new power 
took possession of me 
and drove me to my 
-feet. That wonderful 
15-minute daily train- 
ing at home had taught 
me to forget myself 
and think only of my 
subject. Almost auto- 
matically the ideas 
which had heretofore 
lain dormant in a men- 
tal jumble, now issued 
with a vigor, clearness 
and enthusiasm that 
astounded me no less 
than my boss and asso- 
ciates. And I noticed 
with silent exultation 
the rapt, intent look 
on my audience as my 
story unfolded itself 
smoothly and eloquently.

IJT no, my friend,” Jules de 
Grandin shook his sleek, 
blond head decidedly and 
grinned across the breakfast table at 
me, “we will go to this so kind 
Madame Norman's tea, of a certainty. 
Yes.” 

“But hang it all,” I replied, giv- 
ing Mi’s. Norman’s note an irritable 
shove with my coffee spoon, “I don’t 
want to go to a confounded tea- 
party ! I ’m too old and too sensible to 
dress up in a tall hat and a long coat 



and listen to the vaporings of a flock 

of silly flappers. I ’ ’ 

“Mordieu, hear the savage!” de 
Grandin chuckled delightedly. “Al- 
ways does he find excuses for not giv- 
ing pleasure to others, and always 
does he frame those excuses to make 
him more important in his own eyes. 
Enough of this, Friend Trowbridge; 
let us go to the kind Madame Nor- 
man’s party. Always there is some- 
thing of interest to be seen if one but 
knows where to look for it. ’ ' 

“H’m, maybe,” I replied grudg- 
ingly, “but you've better sight than I

think you have if you can find any- 
thing worth seeing at an afternoon 
reception. ’ ’ 

T he reception was in full blast 
when we arrived at the Norman 
mansion in Tuscarora Avenue that 
afternoon. The air was heavy with 
the commingled odors of half a hun- 
dred different perfumes and the 
scent of hot-poured jasmine tea, 
while the clatter of cup on saucer, 
laughter, and buzzing conversation 
filled the wide hall and dining room. 
In the long double parlors the rugs 
had been rolled back and young men 
in frock coats glided over the pol- 
ished parquetry in company with 
girls in provocatively short skirts to 
the belching melody of a saxophone 
and the drumming rhythm of a piano. 

“ Pardicu,” de Grandin mur- 
mured as he viewed the dancers a 
moment, “your American youth 
take their pleasures with seriousness, 
Friend Trowbridge. Behold their 
faces. Never a smile, never a laugh. 
They might be recruits on their first 
parade for. all the joy they show — 
ah ! ’ ’ He broke off abruptly, gazing 
with startled, almost horrified, eyes 
after a couple whirling in the mazes 
of a foxtrot at the farther end of the 
room. “Nom d’un fromage,” he 
murmured softly to himself, “this 
matter will bear investigating, I 
v think !” 

“Eh, what’s that?” I asked, pilot- 
ing him toward our hostess. 

.“Nothing; nothing, I do assure 
you,” he answered as we greeted Mrs. 
Norman and passed toward the din- 
ing room. But I noticed his round, 
blue eyes strayed more than once to- 
ward the parlors as we drank our tea 
and exchanged amiable nothings with 
a pair of elderly ladies. 

‘ ‘ Pardon, ’ ’ de Grandin bowed stiff- 
ly from the hips to his conversational 
partner and turned toward the rear 
drawing room, “there is a gentlemen 
here I desire to meet, if you do not 



mind — that tall, distinguished one, 
with the young girl in pink. ’ ’ 

“Oh, I guess you mean Count 
Czerny, ’ ’ a young man laden with an 
ice in one hand and a glass of non- 
Volstead punch in the other paused 
on his way from the dining room. 
“He’s a rare bird, all right. I knew 
him back in ’13 when the Balkan 
Allies were polishing off the Turks. 
Queer-lookin’ duck, ain’t he? First- 
class fightin’ man, though. Why, I 
saw him lead a bayonet charge right 
into the Turkish lines one day, and 
when he’d shot his pistol empty he 
went at the enemy with his teeth ! 
Yes, sir, he grabbed a Turk with both 
hands and bit his throat out, hanged 
if he didn’t.” 

‘ ‘ Czerny, ’ ’ de Grandin repeated 
musingly. “He is a Pole, perhaps?” 

His informant laughed a bit shame- 
facedly. “Can’t say,” he confessed. 
“The Serbs weren’t asking embar- 
rassing questions about Volunteers’ 
nationalities those days, and it wasn ’t 
considered healthful for any of us to 
do so, either. I got the impression 
he was a Hungarian refugee from 
Austrian vengeance; but that’s only 
hearsay. Come along, I’ll introduce 
you, if you wish.” 

I saw de Grandin clasp hands with 
the foreigner and stand talking with 
him for a time, and, in spite of my- 
self, I could not forbear a smile at 
the contrast they- made. 

The Frenchman was a bare five feet 
four inches in height, slender as a 
girl, and, like a girl, possessed of al- 
most laughably small hands and feet.. 
His light hair and fair skin, coupled 
with his trimly waxed diminutive 
blond mustache and round, unwink- 
ing blue eyes, gave him a curiously 
misleading appearance of mildness. 
His companion was at least six feet 
tall, swarthy-skinned and black- 
haired, with bristling black mustaches 
and fierce, slate-gray eyes set beneath 
beetling black brows. His large nose 
was like the predatory beak of some 



THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW 



151 



bird of prey, and the tilt of his long, 
pointed jaw bore out the uncompro- 
mising ferocity of the rest of his vis- 
age. Across his left cheek, extending 
upward over the temple and into his 
hair, was a knife- or saber-scar, a 
streak of white showing the trail of 
the steel in his scalp, and shining like 
silver inlaid in onyx against the blue- 
black of his smoothly pomaded locks. 

What they said was, of course, be- 
yond reach of my ears, but I saw de 
Grandin’s quick, impish smile flicker 
across his keen face more than once, 
to be answered by a slow, languorous 
smile on the other’s dark counten- 
ance. 

At length the count bowed formal- 
ly to my friend and whirled away 
with a wisp of a girl, while de Gran- 
din returned to me. At the door he 
paused a moment, inclining his 
shoulders in a salute as a couple of 
debutantes brushed past him. Some- 
thing — I know not what — drew my 
attention to the tall foreigner a mo- 
ment, and a sudden chill rippled up 
my spine at what I saw. Above the 
georgette-clad shoulder of his danc- 
ing partner the count’s slate-gray 
eyes w T ere fixed on de Grandin’s trim 
back, and in them I read all the cold, 
malevolent fury with which a caged 
tiger regards its keeper as he passes 
the bars. 

“What on earth did you say to 
that fellow?” I asked as the little 
Frenchman rejoined me. ‘ ' He looked 
as if he would like to murder you. ’ ’ 

“Ha?” he gave a questioning, 
single-syllabled laugh. “Did he so? 
Obey the noble Washington’s injunc- 
tion, and avoid foreign entangle- 
ments, Friend Trowbridge; it is bet- 
ter so, I think.” 

“But look here,” I began, nettled 
by his manner, “what ” 

“Non, non,” he interrupted, “you 
must be advised by me, my friend. I 
think it would be better if we dis- 
missed the incident from our minds. 
But stay — perhaps you had better 



meet that gentleman, after all. I 
will have the good Madame Norman 
introduce you. ’ ’ 

More puzzled than ever, I followed 
him to our hostess and waited while 
he requested her to present me to the 
count. 

In a lull in the dancing she com- 
plied with his request, and the for- 
eigner acknowledged the introduction 
with a brief handclasp and an almost 
churlish nod, then turned his back on 
me, continuing an animated conver- 
sation with the large-eyed young wo- 
man in an abbreviated party frock. 

“And did you shake his hand?” 
de Grandin asked as we descended the 
Normans’ steps to my waiting car. 

“Yes, of course,” I replied. 

“Ah? Tell me, my friend, did 
you notice anything — ah — peculiar, 
in his grip ? ’ ’ 

“H’m.” I wrinkled my brow a 
moment in concentrated thought. 
“Yes, I believe I did.” 

“So? What was it?” 

“Hanged if I can say, exactly,” I 
admitted, “but — well, it seemed — 
this sounds absurd, I know — but it 
seemed as though his hand had two 
baeks — no palm at all — if that means 
anything to you. ’ ’ 

“It means much, my friend; it 
means a very great deal,” he an- 
swered with such a solemn nod that I 
burst into a fit of laughter. “Be- 
lieve me, it means- much more than 
you suspect.” 

I t must have been some two w T eeks 
later that I chanced to remark to 
de Grandin, ‘ ‘ I saw your friend, 
Count Czerny, in New York yester- 
day.” 

‘ ‘ Indeed ? ” he answered with what 
seemed like more than necessary 
interest. “And how did he impress 
you at the time?” 

“Oh, I just happened to pass him 
in Fifth Avenue,” I replied. “I’d 
been up to see an acquaintance in 
Fifty-ninth Street and was turning 



152 



WEIRD TALES 



into the avenue when I saw him driv- 
ing away from the Plaza. He was 
with some ladies.” 

‘‘No doubt,” de Grandin respond- 
ed dryly. ‘‘Did you notice him 
particularly ? ’ ’ 

‘‘Can’t say that I did, especially,” 
I answered, ‘‘but it seems to me he 
looked older than the day we met him 
at Mrs. Norman’s.” 

‘‘Yes?” the Frenchman leaned 
forward eagerly. “Older, do you 
say? Parbleu, this is of interest; I 
suspected as much ! ’ ’ 

“Why ” I began, but he 

turned away with an impatient 
shrug. “Pah!” he exclaimed petu- 
lantly. “Friend Trowbridge, I fear 
Jules de Grandin is a fool, he enter- 
tains all sorts of strange notions.” 

I had known the little Frenchman 
long enough to realize that he was 
as full of moods as a prima donna, 
but his erratic, unrelated remarks 
were getting on my nerves. “See 
here, de Grandin,” I began testily, 

“what’s all this nonsense ” 

The sudden shrill clatter of my 
office telephone bell cut me short. 
“Dr. Trowbridge,” an agitated voice 
asked over the wire, “can you come 
right over, please? This is Mrs. Nor- 
man speaking.” 

“Yes, of course,” I answered, 
reaching for my medicine case ; 
“what is it — who’s ill?” 

“It’s — it’s Guy Eckhart, he’s been 
taken with a fainting fit, and we 
don’t seem to be able to rouse him.” 
“Very well,” I promised, “Dr. de 
Grandin and I will be right over. 

“Come on, de Grandin,” I called 
as I shoved my hat down over my 
ears and shrugged into my overcoat, 
“one of Mrs. Norman’s house guests 
has been taken ill ; I told her we were 
coming.” 

“Mats oui,” he agreed, hurrying 
into his outdoors clothes.' “Is it a 
man or a woman, this sick one?” 
“It’s a man,” I replied, “Guy 
Eckhart.” 



“A man,” he echoed incredulous- 
ly. “A man, do you say? No, no, 
my friend, that is not likely. ’ ’ 

“Likely or not,” I rejoined sharp- 
ly, “Mrs. Norman says he’s been 
seized with a fainting fit, and I give 
the lady credit for knowing what 
she’s talking about.” 

“Eh bien,” he drummed nervous- 
ly on the cushions of the automobile 
seat, “perhaps Jules de Grandin real- 
ly is a fool. After all, it is not im- 
possible.” . 

“It certainly isn’t,” I agreed fer- 
vently to myself as I set the car in 
motion. 

VT'oung Eckhart had recovered 
* consciousness when we arrived, 
but looked like a man just emerging 
from a lingering fever. Attempts to 
get a statement from him met with 
no response, for he replied slowly, al- 
most incoherently, and seemed to 
have no idea concerning the cause of 
his illness. 

Mrs.. Norman was little more 
specific. “My son Ferdinand found 
him lying on the floor of his bath 
with the shower going and the win- 
dow wide open, just before dinner,” 
she explained. “He was totally un- 
conscious, and remained so till just a 
few minutes ago.” 

“Ha, is it so?” de Grandin mur- 
mured half heedlessly, as he made a 
rapid inspection of the patient. 

“Friend Trowbridge,” he called 
me to the window, “what do you 
make of these objective symptoms: a 
soft, frequent pulse, a fluttering 
heart, suffused eyes, a hot, dry skin 
and a flushed, hectic face?” 

“Sounds like an arterial hemor- 
rhage,” I answered promptly, “but 
there’s been no trace of blood on the 
boy’s floor, nor any evidence of a 
stain on his clothing. Sure you’ve 
checked the signs over?” 
“Absolutely,” he replied with a 
vigorous double nod. Then to the

young man: “Now, mon enfant, we 
shall inspect you, if you please.’’ 
Quickly he examined the boy’s 
face, scalp, throat, wrists and calves, 
finding no evidence of even a pin- 
prick, let alone a wound capable of 
causing syncope. 

“Mon Dieu, this is strange,” he 
muttered; “of a surety, it has the 
queerness of the devil ! Perhaps the 
bleeding is internal, but — ah, regard- 
ez vous, Friend Trowbridge!” 

He had turned down the collar of 
the youngster’s pajama jacket, more 
t in idle routine than in hope of discov- 
ering anything tangible, but the livid 
spot to which he pointed seemed the 
key to our mystery’s outer door. 
Against the smooth, white flesh of 
the young man’s left breast there 
showed a red, angry patch, such as 
might have resulted from a vacuum 
cup being held some time against the 
skin, and in the center of the dis- 
coloration was a double row of tiny 
punctures scarcely larger than 
needle-pricks, arranged in horizontal 
divergent arcs, like a pair of paren- 
theses laid sidewise. 

“You see?” he asked simply, as 
though the queer, blood-infused spot 
explained everything. 

“But he couldn’t have bled much 
through that,” I protested. “Why, 
the man seems almost drained dry, 
and these wounds wouldn’t have 
yielded more than a cubic centimeter 
of blood, at most.” 

He nodded gravely. ‘ ‘ Blood is not 
entirely colloidal, my friend,” he re- 
sponded.. “It will penetrate the tis- 
sues to some extent, especially if 
sufficient force is applied.” 

“But it would have required a 

powerful suction ” I replied, 

when his rejoinder cut me short : 
“Ha, you have said it, my friend. 
Suction — that is the word!” 

“But what could have sucked a 
man’s blood like this?” I was in a 
near-stupor of mystification. 



“What, indeed?” he replied grave- 
ly. “That is for us to find out. 
Meantime, we are here as physicians. 
A quarter-grain morphine injection 
is indicated here, I think. You will 
adminster the dose ; I have no license 
in America.” 

W hen I returned from my round 
of afternoon calls ne'xt day I 
found de Grandin seated on my front 
steps in close conference with Indian 
John. 

Indian John was a town character 
of doubtful lineage who performed 
odd jobs of snow shoveling, furnace 
tending and grass cutting, according 
to season, and interspersed his man- 
ual labors with brief incursions into 
the mercantile field when he peddled 
fresh vegetables from door to door. 
He also peddled neighborhood gossip 
and retailed local lore to all who 
would listen, his claim to being a 
hundred years old giving him the 
standing of an indisputable authority; 
in all matters antedating living mem- 
ory. 

“Par dieu, but you have told me 
much, mon vieux,” de Grandin de- 
clared as I came up the porch steps. 
He handed the old rascal a handful 
of silver and rose to accompany mo 
into the house. 

“Fi'iend Trowbridge,” he accused 
as we finished dinner that night, 
“you had not told me that this town 
grew up on the site of an early Swed- 
ish settlement.” 

“Never knew you wanted to 
know,” I defended with a grin. 

“You know the ancient Swedish 
church, perhaps,” he persisted. 

“Yes, that’s old Christ Church,” 
I answered. “It’s down in the east 
end of town; don’t suppose it has a 
hundred communicants today. Our 
population has made some big chang- 
es, both in complexion and creed, 
since the days when the Dutch and 
Swedes fought for possession of New 
Jersey.” 



154 



WEIRD TALES 



“You will drive me to that church, 
right away, at once, immediately?” 
he demanded eagerly. 

“I guess so,” I agreed. “What’s 
the matter now; Indian John been 
telling you a lot of fairy-tales ? ’ ’ 

“Perhaps,” he replied, regarding 
me with one of his steady, unwinking 
stares. “Not all fairy-tales are pleas- 
ant, you" know. Do you recall those 
of Chaperon Rouge — how do you say 
it, Red Riding Hood? — and Blue- 
beard ? ’ ’ 

“Huh!” I scoffed; “they’re both 
as true as any of John’s stories, I’ll 
bet. ’ ’ 

* ‘ Undoubtlessly, ’ ’ he agreed with a 
quick nod. ‘ ‘ The story of Bluebeard, 
for instance, is unfortunately a very 
true tale indeed. But come, let us 
hasten; I would see that church to- 
night, if I may.” 

C hrist church, the old Swedish 
plaee of worship, was a combined 
demonstration of how firmly adz- 
hewn pine and walnut can resist the 
ravages of time and how nearly three 
hundred years of weather can de- 
molish any structure erected by man. 
Its rough-painted walls and short, 
firm-based spire shone ghostly and 
pallid in the early spring moonlight, 
and the cluster of broken and weath- 
er-worn tombstones which staggered 
up from its unkempt burying ground 
were like soiled white chicks seeking 
shelter from a soiled white hen. 

Dismounting from my ear at the 
wicket gate of the churchyard, we 
made our way over the level graves, 
I in a maze of wonderment, de Gran- 
din with an eagerness almost childish. 
Occasionally he flashed the beam 
from his electric torch on some monu- 
ment of an early settler, bent to de- 
cipher the worn inscription, then 
turned away with a sigh of disap- 
pointment.. 

1 paused to light a cigar, but 
dropped my half-burned match in as- 
tonishment as my companion gave 



vent to a cry of excited pleasure. 
“Triomphe!” he exclaimed delight- 
edly. “Come and behold, Friend 
Trowbridge. Thus far your lying 
friend, the Indian man, has told the 
truth. Regardcz J” 

He was standing beside an old, 
weather-gnawed tombstone, once 
marble, perhaps, but appearing more 
like brown sandstone under the ray 
of liis flashlight. Across its upper 
end was deeply cut the one word : 

SAHAH 

while below the name appeared a 
verse of half-obliterated doggerel : 

Lot noiuie difturb her deathleffe fleepe 
Abote ye tombe wilde garlick keepe 
For if fhee wake much woe will boaft 
1’rayfe Faither, Sonne & Holie Goaft. 

“Did you bring me out here to 
study the orthographical eccentrici- 
ties of the early settlers ? ” I demand- 
ed in disgust. 

“Ah bah!” he returned. “Let us 
consult the ecclesiastique. He, per- 
haps, will ask no fool ’s questions. ’ ’ 
“No, you’ll do that,” I answered 
tartly as we knocked at the rectory 
door. 

“Pardon, Monsieur,” de Grandin 
apologized as the white-haired old 
minister appeared in answer to our 
summons, “we do not wish to dis- 
turb you thus, but there is a matter 
of great import on which we would 
consult you. I would that you tell 
us what 'you can, if anything, con- 
cerning a certain grave in your 
churchyard. A grave marked ‘Sarah,' 
if you please. ’ ’ 

“Why” — the elderly cleric was 
plainly taken aback — : “.I don’t 

think there is anything I can tell you 
about it, sir.. There is some mention 
in the early parish records, I believe, 
of a woman believed to have been a 
murderess being buried in that grave, 
but it seems the poor creature was 
more sinned against than sinning. 
Several children in the neighborhood 



THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW 



155 



died mysteriously — some epidemic 
the ignorant physicians failed to un- 
derstand, no doubt — and Sarah, 
whatever the poor woman’s surname 
may have been, was accused of kill- 
ing them by witchcraft. At any rate, 
one of the bei’eft mothers took venge- 
ance into her own hands, and 
strangled poor Sarah with, a noose of 
well-rope. The witchcraft belief must 
have been quite prevalent, too, for 
there is some nonsense verse on the 
tombstone concerning her ‘deathless 
sleep’ and an allusion to her waking 
from it; also some mention of wild 
garlic being planted about her. ’ ’ 

He laughed somewhat ruefully. “I 
wish they hadn ’t said that, ' ’ he add- 
ed, “for, do you know, there are gar- 
lic shoots growing about that grave 
to this very day. Old Christian, our 
sexton, declares that he can’t get rid 
of it, no matter how much he grubs 
it up. It spreads to the surrounding 
lawn, too,’’ he added sadly. 

“ Cor dieu!” de Grandin gasped. 
‘ ‘ This is of the importance, sir ! ’ ’ 

The old man smiled gently at the 
little Frenchman’s impetuosity. 

“It’s an odd thing,” he comment- 
ed, “there was another gentleman 
asking about that same tomb a few 
weeks ago; a — pardon the expression 
— a foreigner.” 

“So?” de Grandin ’s little, waxed 
mustache twitched like the whiskers 
of a nervous tom-cat. “A foreigner, 
do you say? A tall, rawboned, flesh- 
less living skeleton of a man with a 
scar on his face and a white streak 
in his hair?” 

“I wouldn’t be quite so severe in 
my description,” the other answered 
with a smile. “He certainly was a 
thin gentleman, and I believe he had 
a scar on his face, too, though I can ’t 
be certain of that, he was so very 
wrinkled.. No, his hair was entirely 
white, there was no white streak in 
it, sir. In fact, I should have said 
he was very advanced in age, judging 
from his hair and face and the man- 



ner in which he walked. He seemed 
very weak and feeble. It was really 
qiiite pitiable.” 

“Sucre nom d’un fromage vert!” 
de Grandin almost snarled. “Piti- 
able, do you say, Monsieur ? Pardieu, 
it is damnable, nothing less!” 

He bowed to the clergyman and 
turned to me. “Come, Friend Trow- 
bridge, come away,” he cried. “We 
must go to Madame Norman’s at 
once, right away, immediately.” 

W hat’s behind all this mys- 
tery?” I demanded as we left 
the parsonage door. 

He elevated his slender shoulders 
in an eloquent shrug. “I only wish 
I knew,” he replied. “Someone is 
working the devil’s business, of that 
I am sure; but what the game is, or 
what the next move will be, only the 
good God can tell, my friend.” 

I turned the car through Tunlaw 
Street to effect a short-cut, and as 
we drove past an Italian green 
grocer’s, de Grandin seized my arm. 
“Stop a moment, Friend Trow- 
bridge,” he asked, “I would make a 
purchase at this shop.. 

“We desire some fresh garlic,” he 
informed the proprietor as we en- 
tered the little store, “a considerable 
amount, if you have it. ’ ’ 

The Italian spread his hands in a 
deprecating gesture. “We have it 
not, Signor,” he declared. “It was 
only yesterday morning that we sold 
our entire supply.” His little black 
eyes snapped happily at the memory 
of an unexpected bargain. 

“Eh, what is this?” de Grandin 
demanded. “Do you say you sold 
your supply? How is that?” 

“I know not,” the other replied. 
“Yesterday morning a rich gentle- 
man came to my shop in an automo- 
bile, and called me from my store. 
He desired all the garlic I had in 
stock — at my own price, Signor, and 
at once. I was to deliver it to his 



156 



WEIRD TALES 



address in Rupleysville the same 
day.” 

“Ah?” de Grandin’s face assumed 
the expression of a cross-word fiend 
as he begins to see the solution of his 
puzzle. “And this liberal purchaser, 
what did he look like?” 

The Italian showed his white, even 
teeth in a wide grin. “It was fun- 
nay,” he confessed. “He did not 
look like one of our people, nor like 
one who would eat much garlic. He 
was old, very old and thin, with a 
much-wrinkled face and white hair, 
he ” 

“Nom d’un chat!” the Frenchman 
cried, then burst into a flood of tor- 
rential Italian.. 

The shopkeeper listened at first 
with suspicion, then incredulity, 
finally in abject terror. “No, no,” 
he exclaimed. “No, Signor; santissi- 
ma Madonna, you do make the joke ! ’ ' 
“Do I so?” de Grandin replied. 
“Wait and see, foolish one.” 

“ Santo Dio forbid!” The other 
crossed himself piously, then bent his 
thumb across his palm, circling it 
with his second and third fingers and 
extending the fore and little fingers 
in the form of a pair of horns. 

The Frenchman turned toward the 
waiting ear with a grunt of inarticu- 
late disgust. 

“What now?” I asked as we got 
under way once more; “what did 
that man make the sign of the evil 
eye for, de Grandin?” 

“Later, my friend; I will tell you 
later,” he answered. “You w r ould 
but laugh if I told you what I sus- 
pect. Pie is of the Latin blood, and 
can appreciate my fears.” Nor would 
he utter another word till we reached 
the Norman house. 

“T~\r. tkowbridge — Dr. de Gran- 
■L' din ! ’ ’ Mrs. Norman met us in 
the hall; “you must have heard my 
prayers; I’ve been ’phoning your 
office for the last hour, and they said 



you were out and couldn’t be 
reached. ’ ’ 

“What’s up?” I asked. 

“It’s Mr. Eckhart again. He’s 
been seized with another fainting fit. 
He seemed so well this afternoon, 
and I sent a big dinner up to him at 
8 o’clock, but when the maid went 
in, she found hjm unconscious, and 
she declares she saw something in 
his room ” 

“Ha?” de Grandin interrupted. 
“Where is she, this servant? I 
would speak w r ith her.” 

“Wait a moment,” Mrs. Norman 
answered ; “ I ’ll send for her. ’ ’ 

The girl, an ungainly young 
Southern negress, came into the 
front hall, sullen dissatisfaction writ- 
ten large upon her black face. 

“Now, then,” de Grandin bent his 
steady, unwinking gaze on her, 
“what is it you say about seeing 
someone in the young Monsieur Eck- 
hart ’s room, hein?” 

“Ah did see sumpin’, too,” the 
girl replied stubbornly. “All don’ 
care who says All didn’t see nothin’, 
Ah says Ah did. Ah’d just toted a 
tray o’ vittles up to Mistuh Eck- 
hart ’s room, an’ when Ah opened de 
do’, dere wuz a woman — dere wuz a 
woman — yas, sar, a skinny, black- 
eyed white woman — a-bendin’ ober 

’um an’ — an’ ” 

“And what, if you please?” de 
Grandin asked breathlessly. 

A-bitin’ ’um!” the girl replied 
defiantly. “Ah don’ care whut Mis’ 
Norman says, she wuz a-bitin’ ’um. 
Ah seen her. Ah knows w r hut she wuz. 
Ah done hyeah tell erbout dat ol’ 
Sarah woman what come up out ’er 
grave wid a long rope erbout her neck 
and go ’round bitin’ folks. Yas, sar; 
an’ she wuz a-bitin’ ’um, too. Ah 
seen her!” 

“Nonsense,” Mrs. Norman com- 
mented in an annoyed whisper over 
de Grandin’s shoulder. 

“ Grand Dieu, is it so?” de Gran- 
din explained, and turning abruptly, 



THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW 



157 



leaped up the stairs toward the siek 
man’s room, two steps at a time. 

“See, see, Friend Trowbridge,” he 
ordered fiercely when I joined him at 
the patient’s bedside. ■''Behold, it is 
the mark ! ’ ’ Turning back Eekhart ’s 
pajama collar, he displayed two in- 
cised horizontal ares on the young 
man’s flesh. There was no room for 
dispute, they were undoubtedly the 
marks of human teeth, and from the 
fresh wounds the blood was flowing 
freely. 

As quickly as possible we staunched 
the flow and applied restoratives to 
the patient, both of us working in 
silence, for my brain was too much 
in a whirl to permit the formation of 
intelligent questions, while de Gran- 
din remained dumb as an oyster. 

“Now,” he ordered as we com- 
pleted our ministrations, “we must 
back to that cemetery, Friend Trow- 
bridge, and, once there, we must do 
the thing which must be done!” 

“What the devil’s that?” I asked 
as we left the sickroom. 

“Non, non, you shall see,” he 
promised as we entered my car and 
drove down the street. 

“Quick, the crank-handle,” he de- 
manded as we descended from the 
ear at the cemetery gate, “it will 
make a serviceable hammer.” He 
was prying a hemlock paling from 
the graveyard fence as he spoke. 

We crossed the unkempt cemetery 
lawn again, and finally paused beside 
the tombstone of the unknown Sarah. 

"Attend me, Friend Trowbridge,” 
de Grandin commanded, “hold the 
searchlight, if you please.” He 
pressed his poeket flash into my hand. 

“Now ” He knelt beside the 

grave, pointing the stick he had 
wrenched from the fenee straight 
downward into the turf. With the 
crank of my motor he began hammer- 
ing the wood into the earth. 

Farther and farther the rough 
stake sank into the sod, de Grandin ’s 
blows falling faster and faster as the 



wood drove home. Finally, when 
there w r as less than six inches of the 
wicket projecting from the grave’s 
top, he raised the iron high over his 
head and drove downward with all 
his might. 

The short hair at the back of my 
neck suddenly started upward, and 
little thrills of horripilation chased 
each other up my spine as the wood 
sank suddenly, as though driven from 
clay into sand, and a low hopeless 
moan, like the wailing of a frozen 
.wind through an ice-cave, wafted up 
to us from the depths of the grave. 

“Good God, what’s that?” I asked, 
aghast. 

For' answer he leaned forward, 
seized the stake in both hands and 
drew suddenly up on it. At* his sec- 
ond tug the wood came away. “See,” 
he ordered eurtly, flashing the pocket 
lamp on the tip of the stave. For 
the distance -of a foot or so from its 
pointed end the wood was stained a 
deep, dull red. It was wet with 
blood. 

“And now forever,” he hissed be- 
tween his teeth, driving the wood in- 
to the grave once more, and sinking 
it a full foot below the surface of the 
grass by thrusting the crank-handle 
into the earth. “Gome, Friend 
Trowbridge, we have done a good 
work this night. I doubt not the 
young Eekhart will soon recover from 
his malady.” 

H is assumption was justified. Eck- 
hart.’s condition improved stead- 
ily. Within a week, save for a slight 
pallor, he was, to all appearances, as 
well as ever. . 

The pressure of the usual early 
crop of influenza and pneumonia kept 
me busily on my rounds, and 1 grad- 
ually gave up hope of getting any 
information from de Grandin, for a 
shrug of the shoulders was all the 
answer he vouchsafed to my ques- 
tions. I relegated Eekhart ’s inex- 
plicable hemorrhages and the blood- 



158 



WEIRD TALES 



stained stake to the limbo of never- 
to-be-solved mysteries. But 

2 

“/"^ood mornin’, gentlemen, ” De- 
^ tective Sergeant Costello greet- 
ed as he followed Nora, my household 
factotum, into the breakfast room, 
“it’s sorry I am to be disturbin’ your 
meal, but there’s a little case puz- 
zlin’ th’ department that I’d like to 
talk over with Dr. de Grandin, if you 
don’t mind.’’ 

He looked expectantly at the little 
Frenchman as he finished speaking, 
his lips parted to launch upon a de- 
tailed description of the case. 

“Parbleu,” de Grandin laughed, 
“it is fortunate for me that I have 
completed my breakfast, clier Ser- 
gent, for a riddle of crime detection 
is to me like a red rag to a bullfrog 
— I must needs snap at it, whether I 
have been fed or no. Speak on, my 
friend, I beseech you ; I am like 
Balaam’s ass, all ears.” 

The big Irishman seated himself 
on the extreme edge of one of my 
Heppelwhite chairs and gazed depre- 
catingly at the derby hat, he held 
firmly between his knees. “It’s like 
this,” he began. “ ’Tis one o’ them 
mysterious disappearance cases, gen- 
tlemen, an’ whilst I’m thinkin’ th’ 
young lady knows exactly where she ’s 
at an’ why she’s there, I hate to tell 
her folks about it. 

“All th’ high-hat folks ain’t like 
you two gentlemen, askin’ your par- 
don, sors — they mostly seems to think 
that a harness bull’s unyform is 
sumpin’ like a livery — like a sho- 
fur’s or a footman’s or sumpin’, an’ 
that a plain-clothes man is just a sort 
o’ inferior servant. They don’t give 
th’ police credit for no brains, y’see, 
an’ when one o’ their darters gits 
giddy an’ runs off th’ reservation, if 
we tells ’em th’ gurrl’s run away of 
her own free will an’ accord they say 
we’re a lot o’ lazy, good-fer-nothin ’ 



bums who are tryin’ to dodge our 
laygitimate jooties be castin’ mud on 
th’ young ladies’ char-ae-ters, d’ye 
see? So, when this Miss Esther Nor- 
man disappears in broad daylight— 
leastwise, in th’ twilight — o’ th’ day 
before her dance, we suspects right 
away that th’ gurrl’s gone her own 
ways into th’ best o’ intentions, y’see; 
but we dasn’t tell her folks as much, 
or they ’ll be hollerin’ to th’ commis- 
sioner fer to git a bran’ new set o’ 
detectives down to headquarters, so 
they will. 

“Now, mind ye, I’m not sayin’ th’ 
young lady mightn’t o’ been kid- 
naped^ y ’understand, gentlemen, 
but I do be sayin’ ’tis most unlikely. 
I’ve been on th’ force, man an’ boy, 
in unyform and in plain clothes fer 
th’ last twenty-five years, an’ th’ 
number of laygitimate kidnapin’s o’ 
young women over ten years of age 
I’ve seen can be counted on th’ little 
finger o’ me left hand, an’ I ain’t 
got none there, at all, at all. ” 

He held the member up for our in- 
spection, revealing the fact that the 
little finger had been amputated close 
to the knuckle. 

De Grandin, elbows on the table, 
pointed chin cupped in his hands, 
was puffing furiously at a vile-smell- 
ing French cigarette, alternately 
sucking down great drafts of its acrid 
smoke and expelling clouds of fumes 
in double jets from his narrow, aris- 
tocratie nostrils. 

“What is it you say?” lie demand- 
ed, removing the cigarette from his 
lips. ‘ ‘ Is it the so lovely Mademoiselle 
Esther, daughter of that kind Ma- 
dame Tuscarora Avenue Norman, 
who is missing?” 

“Yes, sor,” Costello answered, 
“’tis tli’ same young lady’s flew the 
coop, accordin’ to my way o’ think- 
in’.” 

“Mordieu!” the Frenchman gave 
the ends of his blond mustache a sav- 
age twist; “you intrigue me, my 



THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW 



159 



friend. Say on, how did it happen, 
and when?” 

“ ’Twas about midnight last night 
th’ alarm came into headquarters,” 
the detective replied. “Accordin’ to 
th’ facts as we have ’em, th’ young 
lady went downtown in th’ Norman 
car to do some errands. We’ve 
checked her movements up, an’ here 
they are.” 

He drew a black-leather memoran- 
dum book from his pocket and con- 
sulted it. 

“At 2:45 or thereabouts, she left 
th’ house, arrivin’ at th’ Ocean Trust 
Company at 2 :55, five minutes before 
th ’ instytootion closed for th ’ day. 
She drew out three hundred an’ thir- 
ty dollars an’ sixty-five cents, an’ left 
th’ bank, goin’ to Madame Gerard ’s, 
where she tried on a party dress for 
th’ dance which was bein’ given at 
her house that night. 

“She left Madame Gerard’s at 
4:02, leavin’ orders for th’ dress to be 
delivered to her house immeejately, 
an’ dismissed her sho-fur at th’ cor- 
ner o’ Dean an’ Tunlaw Streets, 
sayin’ she was goin’ to deliver some 
vegy tables an’ what-not to a pore 
family she an’ some o’ her friends 
was keepin’ till their old man gits let 
out o’ jail — ’twas meself an’ Clancey, 
me buddy, that put him there when 
we caught him red-handed in a job 
o’ housebreakin’, too. 

“Well, to return to th’ young lady, 
she stopped at Pete Bacigaiupo’s 
store in Tunlaw Street an’ bought a 
basket o’ fruit an’ canned things, at 

4 :30, an’ ” He clamped his long- 

suffering derby between his knees 
and spread his hands emptily before 
us. 

“Yes, ‘and’ !” de Grandin 

prompted, dropping the glowing end 
of his cigarette into his coffee cup. 

“An’ that’s all,” responded the 
Irishman. “She just walked off, an’ 
no one ain’t seen her since, sor.” 

“But — cordieu ! — such things do 
not occur’, my friend,” de Grandin 



protested. “Somewhere you have 
overlooked a factor in this puzzle. 
You say no one saw her later? Have 
you nothing whatever to add to the 
tale?” 

“Well” — the detective grinned at 
him — “there are one or two little in- 
cidents, but they ain’t of any im- 
portance in th’ case, as far as I can 
see. Just as she left Pete’s store an 
old gink tried to ‘make’ her, but she 
give him th’ air, an’ he went off an’ 
didn ’t bother her no more. 

“I’d a’ liked to seen th’ old boy, 
at that. Day before yesterday there 
was an old felly hangin’ ’round by 
the silk mills, annoyin’ th’ gurrls as 
they come off from work. Clancey, 
me mate, saw ’im an’ started to take 
im up, an’ darned if th’ old rummy 
wasn’t strong as a bull. D’ye know, 
he broke clean away from Clancey 
an’ darn near broke his arm, in th’ 
bargain? Belike ’twas th’ same man 
accosted Miss Norman outside Pete’s 
store. ’ ’ 

“Ah ? ” de Grandin ’s slender, white 
fingers began beating a devil’s tattoo 
on the tablecloth. “And who was it 
saw this old man annoy the lady, 
heinf” 

Costello grinned widely, “ ’Twas 
Pete Bacigalupo himself, sor,” he 
answered. “Pete swore he recog- 
nized th’ old geezer as havin’ come to 
his store a month or so ago in an 
autymobile an bought up all his en- 
tire stock o’ garlic. Huh! Th’ fool

“Dim et le diablc!” de Grandin 
leaped up, oversetting his chair in 
his mad haste. “And we sit here 
like three poissons d’avril — like poor 
fish — while he works his devilish will 
on her! Quick, sergeant! Quick, 
Friend Trowbridge! Your hats, your 
coats; the motor! Oh, make haste.

my friends, fly, fly, I implore you; 
even now it may be too late ! ’ ’ 

As though all the fiends of pande- 
monium were at his heels he raced 
from the breakfast room, up the 
stairs, three steps at a stride, and 
down the upper hall toward his bed- 
room. Nor did he cease his shouted 
demands for haste throughout his 
wild flight. 

“Cuckoo?” The sergeant tapped 
his forehead significantly. 

I shook my head as I hastened to 
the hall for my driving clothes. 
“No,” I answered, shrugging into 
my topcoat, “he’s got a reason for 
everything he does; but you and I 
can’t always see it, sergeant.” 

“You said a mouthful that time, 
doe,” he agreed, pulling his hat 
down over his ears. “He’s the dam- 
dest, craziest Frog I ever seen, but, 
at that, he’s got more sense than nine 
men out o’ ten.” 

“To Rupleysville, Friend Trow- 
bridge,” de Grandin shouted as he 
leaped into the seat beside me. ‘ ‘ Make 
haste, I do implore you. Oh, Jules 
de Grandin, your grandfather wasan 
imbecile and all your ancestors were 
idiots, but you are the greatest zany 
in the family. Why, oh, why, do you 
require a sunstroke before you can 
see the light, foolish one?” 

I swung the machine down the pike 
at highest legal speed, but the little 
Frenchman kept urging greater 
haste. “ Sang de Dieu, sang de Saint 
Denis, sang du diablel” he wailed 
despairingly. “Can you not make 
this abominable car go faster, Friend 
Trowbridge? Oh, ah, helas, if we are 
too late! I shall hate myself, I shall 
loathe myself — pardieu, I shall be- 
come a Carmelite friar and eat fish 
and abstain from swearing!” 

VX 7"e took scarcely twenty minutes 
’ » to cover the ten-mile stretch to 
the aggregation of tumbledown 
houses which was Rupleysville, but 
my companion was almost frothing 



at the mouth when I drew up before 
the local apology for a hotel. 

“Tell me, Monsieur,” de Grandin 
cried as he thrust the hostelry’s door 
open with his foot and brandished 
his slender ebony cane before the as- 
tonished proprietor’s eyes, “tell me 
of tin vieillard — an old, old man with 
snow-white hair and an evil face, who 
has lately come to this so detestable 
place. I would know where to find 
him, right away, immediately^ at 
once ! ’ ’ 

“Say,” the bonifaee demanded 
truculently, “where d’ye git that 
stuff? Who are you to be askin’ 

“That’ll do” — Costello shouldered 
his -way past de Grandin and dis- 
played his badge — “you answer this 
gentleman’s questions, an’ answer 
’em quick an’ accurate, or I’ll run 
you in, see?” 

The innkeeper’s defiant attitude 
melted before the detective’s show of 
authority like frost before the sun- 
rise. “Guess you must mean Mr. 
Zerny,” he replied sullenly. “lie 
come here about a month ago an’ 
rented the Hazelton house, down th’ 
road about a mile. Comes up to town 
for provisions every day or two, and 

stops in here sometimes for a ” 

He halted abruptly, his face suffused 
with a dull flush. ' 

“Yeah?” Costello replied. “Go 
on an’ say it; we all know what he 
stops here for. Now listen, buddy” 
— he stabbed the air two inches before 
the man’s face with a blunt fore- 
finger — “I don’t know viiether this 
here Zerny felly’s got a tellyphone or. 
not, but if he has, you just lay off 
tellin’ ’im we’re cornin’; git me? If 
anyone’s tipped him th’ office when 
we git to his plaee I’m eomin’ back 
here and plaster more padlocks on 
this place o’ yours than Sousa’s got 
medals on his blouse. Savvy?” 

“Come away, Sergent; come away, 
Friend Trowbridge,” de Grandin be- 
sought almost tearfully. “Bandy not

words with the cancre; we have work 
to do!” 

Down the road we raced in the 
direction indicated by the hotelkeep- 
er, till the picket fence and broken 
shutters of the Hazelton house 
showed among a rank copse of sec- 
ond-growth pines at the bend of the 
highway. 

The shrewd wind of early spring 
was moaning and soughing among the 
black boughs of the pine trees as 
we ran toward the house, and, though 
it was bright with sunshine on the 
road, there was chill and shadow’ 
about us as we climbed the sagging 
steps of the old building’s ruined 
piazza and paused breathlessly before 
the paintless front door. 

“Shall 1 knock?” Costello asked 
dubiously, involuntarily sinking his 
voice to a whisper. 

“ But no, ’ ’ de Grandin answered in 
a low voice, “what we have to do 
here must be done quietly, my 
friends. ’ ’ 

He leaned forward and tried the 
doorknob with a light, tentative 
touch. The door gave under his 
hand, swinging inward on protesting 
hinges, and we tiptoed into a dark, 
dust-carpeted hall. A shaft of sun- 
light, slanting downward from a 
chink in one of the window shutters, 
show r ed innumerable dust-motes fly- 
ing lazily in the air, and laid a bright 
oval of light against the warped 
floor-boards. 

“Huh, empty as a pork-butcher’s 
in Jerusalem,” Costello commented 
disgustedly, looking about the un- 
furnished rooms, but de Grandin 
seized him by the elbow’ with one 
hand while he pointed toward the 
floor with the ferrule of his slender 
ebony walking stick. 

“Empty, perhaps,” he conceded in 
a low, vibrant whisper, “but not 
recently, mon ami. ’ ’ Where the sun- 
beam splashed on the uneven floor 
there showed distinctly the mark of a 
booted foot, two marks — a trail of 



them leading toward the rear of the 
house. 

“Right y’are,” the detective 
agreed. “Someone’s left his track 
here, an’ no mistake.” 

“Ha!” de Grandin bent forward 
till it seemed the tip of his high- 
bridged nose would impinge on the 
tracks. “Gentlemen,” he rose and 
pointed forward into the gloom with 
a dramatic flourish of his cane, “they 
are here ! Let us go ! ” 

Through the gloomy hall we fol- 
lowed the trail by the aid of Costel- 
lo’s flashlight, stepping carefully to 
avoid creaking boards as much as pos- 
sible. At length the marks stopped 
abruptly in the center of w r hat had 
fonnerly been the kitchen. A dis- 
turbance in the dust told w r here the 
walker had doubled on his tracks in 
a short circle, and a ringbolt in the 
floor gave notice that we stood above 
a trap-door of some sort. 

“Careful, Friend Costello,” de 
Grandin warned, “have ready your 
flashlight when I fling back the trap. 
Ready? Un—deux—troisl” 

He bent, seized the rusty ringbolt 
and heaved the trap-door back so 
violently that it flew back with a 
thundering crash on the floor be- 
yond. 

The cavern had originally been a 
cellar for the storage of food, it 
seemed, and was brick-walled and 
earth-floored, without window or ven- 
tilation opening of any sort. A dank, 
musty odor assaulted our nostrils as 
we leaned forward, but further im- 
pressions were blotted out by the 
sight directly beneath us. 

White as a figurine of earven ala- 
baster, the slender, bare body of a 
girl lay in sharp reverse silhouette 
against the darkness of the cavern 
floor, her ankles crossed and firmly 
lashed to a stake in the earth, one 
hand doubled behind her back in the 
position of a wrestler’s hammerlock 
grip, and made firm to a peg in the 
floor, while the left am was extend-

ed straight outward, its wrist pin- 
ioned to another stake. Her lux- 
uriant fair hair had been knotted to- 
gether at the ends, then staked to the 
ground, so that her head was drawn 
far back, exposing her rounded throat 
to its fullest extent, and on the earth 
beneath her left breast and beside 
her throat stood two porcelain bowls. 

Crouched over her w r as the relic of 
a man, an old, old, hideously wrinkled 
witch-husband, with matted white 
hair and beard. In one hand he held 
a long, gleaming, double-edged dirk 
while with the other he caressed the 
girl ’s smooth throat with gloating 
strokes of his skeleton fingers. 

“Howly Mither!” Costello’s Coun- 
ty Galway brogue broke through his 
American accent at the horrid sight 
below us. 

“My God?” I exclaimed, all the 
breath in my lungs suddenly seeming 
to freeze in my throat. 

“ Bonjour, Monsieur le Vampire!” 
Jules de Grandin greeted nonchal- 
antly, leaping to the earth beside the 
pinioned girl and waving his walking 
stick airily. “By the horns of the 
devil, but you have led us a merry 
chase, Baron Lajos Czuczron of 
Transylvania ! ’ ’ 

The crouching creature emitted a 
bellow of Yury and leaped toward de 
Grandin, brandishing his knife. 

The Frenchman gave ground with 
a quick, catlike leap and grasped his 
slender cane in both hands near the 
top. Next instant he had ripped the 
lower part of the stick away, display- 
ing a fine, three-edged blade set in the 
cane’s handle, and swung his point 
toward the froth ing-mouthed thing 
which mouthed and gibbered like a 
beast at bay. “A-ah?” he cried with 
a mocking, upward-lilting accent. 
“You did not expect this, eh, Friend 
Blood-drinker ? I give you the party- 
of -surprize, n’est-ce-pas ? The cen- 
turies have been long, mon vieux; but 
the reckoning has come at last. Say, 



now, will you die by the steel, or by 
starvation ? ’ ’ 

. The aged monster fairly champed 
his gleaming teeth in fury. His eyes 
seemed larger, rounder, to gleam like 
the eyes of a dog in the firelight, as 
he launched himself toward the little 
Frenchman. 

“Sa-ha!” the Frenchman sank 
backward on one foot, then straight- 
ened suddenly forward, stiffening his 
sword-arm and plunging his point 
directly into the charging beast- 
man ’s distended, red mouth. A 
scream of mingled rage and pain 
filled the cavern with deafening 
shrillness, and the monster half 
turned, as though on an invisible 
pivot, clawed with horrid impotence 
at the wire-fine blade of de Grandin ’s 
rapier, then sank slowly to the earth, 
his death cry stilled to a sickening 
gurgle as his throat filled with blood. 

“Fini!” de Grandin commented 
laconically, drawing out his handker- 
chief and wiping his blade with 
meticulous care, then cutting the un- 
conscious girl’s bonds with his pock- 
et-knife. ‘ ‘ Drop down your overcoat. 
Friend Trowbridge,” he added, 
“that we may eover the poor child’s 
nudity until we can piece out a ward- 
robe for her. 

“Now, then” — as he raised her to 
meet the hands Costello and I extend- 
ed into the pit — “if we clothe her in 
the motor rug, your jacket, Sergent, 
Friend Trowbridge’s topcoat and my 
shoes, she will be safe from the chill. 
Parbleu, I have seen women refugees 
from the Boche who could not boast 
so complete a toilette!” 

"\T7ith Esther Norman, hastily . 

' * clothed in her patchwork as-

1 00KING back, one is struck with 
wonder that we know as much 
of the story as we do ; that we 
comprehend as fully as we do the 
nature of the strange doom that 
rushed out onto humanity from a 
lonely hill in southern Scotland. Had 
it not been for one small thing, the 
casual curiosity of a young student, 
that appalling invasion would re- 
main to this day quite unexplained. 
A trifle, certainly, that passing in- 
terest of a rather commonplace young 
man, but except for that interest, and 
what it led to, we would understand 
nothing of the vast drama that was 
played around and above us. 

Not that our ignorance or knowl- 
edge could have affected the out- 
come of that drama ! Beside the 
tremendous forces that, rose and 
fought and crashed, mankind was but 
a mass of tiny, frightened pigmies, 
running about beneath battling 
giants. Yet one remembers that it 
was one of those same pigmies, it was 
a single embittered, insane man who 
loosed all of that ancient terror upon 



us and caused an age-old cosmic feud 
to flare out in dreadful war, universe 
struggling with uuiverse in titanic 
combat, immense, unthinkable 

The story, as we know it, begins 
on that sultry afternoon in August 
when young Ernest Hunter came into 
the village of Leadanfoot and dis- 
mounted wearily from hi§ battered 
bicycle. A day of pedaling over the 
Scotch hills had made him regret, 
somewhat, his decision to visit Glas- 
gow on his holiday trip. One of the 
numberless students who swarm over 
the English highways each summer, 
on cycles and afoot, he began to think 
that this side-trip over the border 
was, after all, a mistake. 

But once inside the dark, cool little 
inn, with a mug of foaming cider at 
hand, these doubts fled and the world 
again seemed a very pleasant place. 
This Hunter, lengthy and stooping of 
figure, with a thin, humorous face, 
was a social type, and looked about 
now for possible company. Except 
for himself there was no one in the 
long, low room but the two men 

163 



164 



WEIRD TALES 



who stood near the open door, the 
stocky, aproned innkeeper and a 
white-whiskered, wrinkled old man 
with whom he was conversing. His 
cider finished, Hunter rose and 
lounged toward them, catching a few 
words of their talk. 

“Thunder? No!” the innkeeper 
was exclaiming. “Who ever heard 
thunder like that?” 

The other was nodding his agree- 
ment when their conversation was 
broken into by Hunter’s friendly 
voice. 

“Thunderstorm here lately?” he 
asked. “I came through a bad one 
down at Carlisle, Wednesday. A 
messy sort of thing. Lightning fired 
a house there. ” 

The host contemplated him doubt- 
fully before replying. 

“It was not a thunderstorm we 
spoke of,” he told him. “There was 
a queer thing here — I don’t just 
know — McAndrews here heard it, 
and so did I ” 

He paused, but Hunter was inter- 
ested, and questioning him further, 
found that the subject of discussion 
w r as a series of strange detonations 
that had been heard throughout the 
village on the night before, a succes- 
sion of deep-toned, rumbling explo- 
sions that seemed to come from the 
group of hills west of Leadanfoot. 
All in the village had heard the 
sounds, and most had set it down as 
distant thunder, but the innkeeper 
quite evidently disagreed. 

“Like no thunder you ever heard,” 
he assiu'ed Hunter.’ “Boom — boom 
— boom — boom — boom ! Regular, 
like a big cannon firing. I’ve heard 
enough thunder in my time, and this 
sound was not like it, not like it at 
all. Eh, McAndrews?” 

The wrinkled oldster sagely nod- 
ded agreement. 

“Maybe it was blasting you heard,” 
Hunter suggested. “Some farmer 
up there doing something of that 
kind, pei’haps?” 



For a moment the innkeeper con- 
templated him with that fine scorn 
with which the rural native regards 
a stranger ignorant of local geog- 
raphy. “Farmer up there!” he re- 
peated, in the tone with which one 
would reject an unworthy statement. 
“Why, there’s not a house through 
all those hills. Too steep they are, 
and wild. I doubt if a single soul 
has lived there for the last ten years. ’ ’ 

The aged McAndrews removed his 
pipe from his mouth to voice dissent. 
“How about the scienteefic chap- 
pies?” he asked. 

“Well, except for them,” conced- 
ed the host, somewhat discomfited, 
while the older man replaced the pipe 
and regarded him with stern gravity. 
Possibly to cover up his mistake, he 
went rapidly on with explanations 
for Hunter’s benefit. 

“Two science professors they are, 
that have a cabin on one of the hills. 
For near a year they’ve been there, 
studying the glassy forts, I hear. I 
never saw them, myself, for they get 
everything they need over at Dy- 
kirk. ’ ’ 

A term in his speech caught Hun- 
ter’s interest. “The glassy forts?” 
he repeated, interrogatively. 

“There’s some piles of old stone 
ruins on some of the hilltops around 
here,” the innkeeper explained. 
“Some of them have parts of stones 
all melted into glass. Lightning did 
it, I suppose. Around here we call 
them the glassy forts, and it’s them 
that these men are working with, dig- 
ging and such.” 

“Oh, I see,” said Hunter. More 
slowly, he continued, “Do you know, 
I’d like to see some of them if it 
wouldn’t take too long. Do you 
suppose I could, in a day?” 

“Well, you can if you’re a good 
climber,” his host informed him. 
“Lowder Hill is the nearest to here, 
and they say there’s such ruins on 
top of it. It’s not so steep, either. 
There’s another hill right next to 



THE ATOMIC CONQUERORS 



165 



Lowder, Kerachan Hill, but it’s too 
high and rough to get up and down 
in a day, hardly. It’s on Kerachan 
that the science men are staying, I 
think. You’d best try Lowder, 
though.” 

“I’ll stay here tomorrow, then,” 
Hunter told him, “and make the 
trip. I’m so infernally tired of ped- 
aling that a day of tramping will be 
a rest.” 

The prospect had intrigued the 
young student, and before retiring 
for the night he acquired enough in- 
formation to guide him on the next 
day’s trip. Also he had been fur- 
nished with a number of weird anec- 
dotes concerning the glassy forts, 
which were evidently objects of local 
superstition. 

The sun was an hour high the next 
morning when he left the inn, a small 
package of lunch in his pocket.. He 
swung quickly through the village 
and tramped steadily over stony 
roads and rough moor toward the 
dark, looming bulk of the western 
hills, whose sides were almost com- 
pletely hidden by dense forests of fir. 

Hunter had been advised to climb 
Lowder Hill from its farther side, so 
on reaching it he walked in a great 
circle around its base, through a nar- 
row, wooded valley that separated it 
from Kerachan Hill. As he passed 
along this valley, he was struck by 
its utter peace and quiet. The smal- 
ler forest creatures were frightened 
away by the sound of his coming, but 
once he glimpsed the vague dun 
shape of a deer slipping through the 
trees in the distance, and now and 
then startled groups of birds burst tip 
through the trees at his approach, 
noisily discussing hint in disparag- 
ing terms, in their flight. The busy, 
shouting, bellowing world seemed in- 
conceivably remote, in that tranquil 
spot. 

The sun swung higher and higher 
while he pushed his way forward. 
And in the world that seemed so very 



far, in Leadanfoot and London and 
New York and Peking, other men 
were pushing their way forward, in 
their particular groove in life, schem- 
ing for disks of metal and slips of 
paper, for the admiration of their 
fellows, for riches or fame or knowl- 
edge. A vast mass of tiny conspira- 
tors, each intent on his own plots, 
each sublimely confident of the im- 
portance of his especial business and 
its outcome. • 

And hidden in those quiet hills in- 
to which Hunter advanced was that 
which was to upset all of those min- 
ute conspiracies like little houses of 
cai’ds, a door through which was to 
come a menacing terror unknown to 
man, so that presently, through this 
world, and worlds above and beyond, 
would run death, and confusion, and 
an ancient dread 

2 

r 'pHE sun was near its greatest 
^ height when Hunter came to the 
farther side of Lowder Hill, and the 
rude path that twisted up that side. 
He stared at it rather doubtfully, for 
the hill seemed very steep and the 
day was almost half gone. Then, 
with a shrug, he was about to step 
forward to the path when the sound 
of a step behind him made him wheel 
in surprize. 

A strange figure was walking to- 
ward him, a small, middle-aged man 
whose clothes were dirty and torn by 
briars. He was hatless, and on his 
pink, round, spectacled face was an 
expression of dazed wonder. He 
came forward until he was within a 
few yards of the astonished Hunter, 
then stopped and regarded him 
mildly.. 

“Not Powell,” he whispered, soft- 
ly, confidentially. “Not ” 

He ceased speaking suddenly, 
looked around with a certain sur- 
prize, then sank to the ground in a 
dead faint. 



166 



WEIRD TALES 



In a moment Hunter was by the 
man’s side, applying his vagne ideas 
of first aid. He got his pocket flask 
between the man’s teeth, and a little 
brandy down his throat, which al- 
most instantly pulled him back to 
consciousness. The man lay there, 
his eyes sweeping over Hunter’s face, 
then asked, quite unexpectedly, 
“What time is it?” 

On finding that it was almost 
noon, he straightened to a sitting 
position. “I’m all right now,” he 
assured the student, motioning the 
latter to a seat on the ground beside 
him. His glance wavered about the 
scene, then came back to Hunter, 
whom he regarded intently before 
addressing him. 

“Who you are, I don’t know,” he 
began, and as Hunter started to ex- 
plain, he added, “and it doesn’t mat- 
ter. You’ve had some education, 
haven’t you? Ah, medical student! 
That makes it easier — much easier.” 
Hunter began to think that the 
man was still dizzy, delirious. 
“Hadn’t I better help you back to 
Leadanfoot?” he asked. 

“There would not be time,” the 
other answered, strangely. “I was 

going to Leadanfoot myself, for - 

But there, you do not know. There 
is time to get back, though. You and 

I. But first you should hear ” 

He caught the doubting, half-fear- 
ful expression on the young man’s 
face. “No, I’m not a madman,” he 
assured him, almost gently. “But I 
need help, badly. Need your help.” 
‘ ‘ But help for what ? ’ ’ asked Hunt- 
er. “I think if you would just go 

back with me to the village ” 

“No!” answered the other, de- 
cisively. There was a pause, in which 
the older man stared across the green 
silence of the valley with unseeing 
eyes. Suddenly he turned to the 
watching, puzzled student. “I will 
put it this way,” he began. “Sup- 



pose someone was planning to kill ev- 
ery living person in the village yon- 
der, to wipe it out utterly, would you 
try to prevent it ? ” 

At Hunter’s wondering reply he 
continued, “Of course you would. 
Now go farther still. Suppose some- 
one, something, was trying to kill ev- 
ery human being on Earth, to anni- 
hilate the world as we know it. Would 
you try to stop that, too?” 

The younger man stared at him 
blankly. “Would you?” persisted 
the other. 

“Why, yes — naturally,” answered 
the student, and the older man 
sighed. 

“It is to prevent that that I need 
your help,” he said, quietly. 

Before Hunter could comment on 
that startling statement the man 
rushed on. “I am going to tell you 
enough of the matter to help you 
understand what threatens. You will 
not think me a madman, when you 
hear! We have little time here, an 
hour perhaps, before we must start 
back. But it is enough for me to 
tell 

“You will wish to know who I am. 
Marlowe is my name, and until a 
year ago I held a position on the 
staff of the Trent Museum, in Lon- 
don. It was there that I met Powell, 
some three years ago. 

“Dr. Henry Powell he was, an 
elderly physics professor, lately re- 
tired from Cambridge. That was all 
he ever told me of his past, for even 
after we became better acquainted 
he was close-mouthed about his form- 
er career. By chance I found the 
reason for that. A friend told me 
that Powell had left Cambridge un- 
der a cloud. It seems that he had 
been working for many months in 
collaboration with a fellow professor, 
Wooding by name, on an element- 
changing experiment. You know, 
transmute uranium into radium, or 
radium into lead. Modern alchemy

they were attempting., After a year 
of work together the two .had split 
over some disagreement, each carry- 
ing on the experiment alone. Wood- 
ing was the first of the two to pub- 
lish his results, and immediately 
Powell claimed that his former part- 
ner in work had stolen his own re- 
sults. 

“There was rather a scandal over 
the matter, but an investigating 
committee ruled that Powell’s 
charges were unproved, so he was re- 
tired from the university. I never 
talked with Powell on the matter, and 
never learned the right of it, but I 
could see that the thing had embit- 
tered him greatly, so that he was 
wont to snarl viciously at all scientific 
people, and in fact, nearly all peo- 
ple, of any kind. He grated on me 
considerably, sometimes, for he was 
like an animated bottle of acid, thin- 
lipped, sardonic, sneering. But one 
thing drew us together, a common 
interest in archeology. In fact, that 
branch of knowledge was my work, at 
the museum, and Powell had taken it 
up as a sort of hobby, to occupy his 
restless mind, I suppose. We got ac- 
quainted through his visits to the mu- 
seum and had many a talk there- 
after. 

“He was intensely interested in 
the ‘vitrified forts’ of Scotland, as 
they are called. Piles of stone ruins 
on some of the Scottish hills, and 
in a few valleys, with some of the 
stones melted into glass. You’ve 
heard of them? Well, it was Pow- 
ell’s radical theory that those glassy 
streaks w r ere not made by lightning, 
as is commonly supposed, but by some 
powerful weapon or ray, striking 
from above. You will see what a 
revolution in conventional arch- 
eological thought would be the re- 
sult if he could prove that. He got 
to be a fanatic on the subject, and 
spent most of his time roaming about 
Scotland and hunting and digging in 
such ruins. 



“TUTe had been off on such a trip 
for several weeks when he sent 
me an urgent wire, from a Scotch 
village named Dykirk. He had made 
a great discovery, he said, but need- 
ed my help, and offered me a hand- 
some salary for my aid. My own 
interest was aroused by his message,- 
so I procured the necessary leave 
from the museum and went at once, 
being met by Powell when I stepped 
off the train. 

“It turned out that his discovery 
was on the summit of a hill some 
miles from Dykirk, named Keraclian 
Hill. He had had a little cottage, or 
cabin, built on the hill, and had lived 
in it for some weeks. It took us most 
of the day to get to his little home, 
so we stowed my luggage and waited 
until the next morning to inspect his 
discovery. 

“And it was really astounding. 
The summit of the hill was flat, and 
there, with a few crumbling stono 
blocks scattered about, but in the 
center of that level expanse, was a 
shallow pit, newly dug, that was cir- 
cular in shape and perhaps twenty 
feet across. At its bottom, a foot or 
so from the surface of the ground, 
lay a flat round stone, the surface of 
which was almost completely covered 
by a mass of strange characters, 
carven into it deeply. 

“It was to decipher this inscrip- 
tion that Powell needed my help, for 
I am by way of being an expert in 
hieroglyphics, cuneiform writing, and 
such. He said that he had found 
this inscription beneath a protecting 
layer of cement of some kind, and 
was afire to learn its meaning, as he 
well might be. 

“So I settled in the little cabin and 
began work that very day. To my 
surprize, I found the inscription 
quite easy to decipher, for all that 
the characters were totally strange 
and unknown. Whoever had carved 
it had placed in it, here and there, 
small pictures, symbols, giving a key 



168

for its translation purposely. Within 
a month I had translated and ar- 
ranged my translations of it, and 
found that the inscription told a 
stupendous, incredible story. 

“According to it, these ruins of 
forfs that lay scattered through Scot- 
land had been built ages before by a 
race of strange folk who had invaded 
the Earth then. And these strangers 
had come, not from another planet, 
as one might suppose, but from a 
single atom in the Earth. 

‘ ‘ This will sound incredible to 
you, as at first it did to me, but con- 
sider. We know that each atom of 
our Earth consists of a number of 
electrons revolving about a nucleus, 
and what is that but a miniature 
solar system? Just as our sun and 
its circling planets may be an atom 
in a vastly larger system, and so on 
infinitely, perhaps. The idea is not 
new, it was advanced years ago. And 
in this particular atom of the Earth, 
on its electrons, its tiny planets, 
dwelt a race proportionately tiny, the 
atomic people, I will call them. They 
had crowded over every one of their 
electron-planets, and were now grad- 
ually stifling from their ever-increas- 
ing numbers. 

“They had science, a strange sort 
of science, and now, at the time of 
their greatest need, one of their scien- 
tists announced a startling discovery. 
He had found a way by which the size 
of any object could be increased or 
decreased indefinitely, at will. And 
the secret of this was stunning in its 
very simplicity. 

“We know that the universal, all- 
pervading ether is the base of every- 
thing. Vibrations of that ether, in a 
certain octave, cause light; in a dif- 
ferent octave, radio waves; in still 
another, chemical rays. But what we 
do not know as yet, what the scientists 
of the atomic people had learned, is 
that all matter itself is but another 
vibration of that ether, in a different 
lower octave. That stone, that tree, 



you and I, all but different vibra- 
tions in the ether. And the atomic 
scientists had found that as a stone is 
simply an etheric vibration, by rais- 
ing the frequency of vibration the 
stone would be made larger, by lower- 
ing that frequency it would be made 
smaller. 

“Their method of changing that 
frequency was told by the inscription. 
They would ascertain the frequency 
of vibration of an object, then con- 
centrate on, it other artificial electric 
vibrations, much like radio waves, 
which would change the vibratory 
frequency of the object just as the 
rate of swing of a pendulum can be 
raised or lowered by a tiny force ap- 
plied to it at the correct moment. 
Thus these atomic people could make 
any object, make even themselves, 
large enough to dwarf their world or 
small enough to disappear entirely. 

“It was a chance to relieve their 
crowding numbers and they seized it 
at once. Using their discovery to 
grow in size, they burst up from their 
own atom into this world, into our 
Earth, and found that the atom that 
was their universe was an atom of a 
simple grain of sand, on Earth. Thai; 
sand-grain, though, held their world, 
so they built a great structure around 
it, in what is now Scotland, so that 
it would always be there as a refuge 
for them to flee to, in ease of need. 
That attended to, up from the atom, 
out of the sand-grain, streamed their 
people, gigantic masses of them. 

“The Earth then was savage and 
forbidding, but nothing daunted, they 
spread over its surface, began to raise 
their structures of stone, to shape this 
world to their will. It must have 
seemed to them that they were secure 
forever in this greater universe. 

“But now came disaster. Certain 
adventurous spirits among them were 
not satisfied to stop in this universe. 
They saw the sun and its attendant 
planets and realized that, this, our 
own solar system, was after all only 



THE ATOMIC CONQUERORS 



169 



an atom in a still greater universe. So 
a number of them, using the same 
method of changing size, grew again 
until they had entered the world 
above this, the universe in which ours 
is but an atom. 

“Now in that greater universe, in 
that superworld, as I shall call it, 
there was civilization, a civilization of 
beings who had advanced far beyond 
the crude semi-barbarism of the peo- 
ple of the atom. So when the atomic 
invaders entered their world, the 
superpeople knew they had come 
from beneath, from an atom, for 
they themselves had long possessed 
that power of changing size which 
the atomic people had just discov- 
ered. Although these superpeople 
promptly beat back the invaders in 
that first attack, time after time in 
the years that followed the warlike 
people of the atom persisted in at- 
tempting to enter the superworld, 
which was so much fairer than either 
their own world or this one. 

“A long while their attacks con- 
tinued until finally the patience of 
the superpeople was exhausted and 
they gathered together all their forces 
to crush these atomic invaders foi’- 
ever. They poured down from their 
greater universe to this Earth, and 
then was a battle such as was never 
known before, the people of the su- 
perworld and the people of the atom 
locked in a death-struggle, smiting 
with strange weapons, a colossal war 
raging over the shuddering Earth 
that reeled beneath them. 

“The atomic invaders could not 
stand against the mighty weapons of 
the superpeople, and soon all of them 
not slain were fleeing in dread to 
their own world, that sand-grain that 
held their universe. They sped back 
to that grain and down into it, 
dwindling in size and vanishing, un- 
til of all their number, only their' 
dead remained on Earth. 

“And now the superpeople set 
about to seal them forever within that 



atom, within that sand-grain, so that 
never again should they break out 
and carry war and death through the 
superworld. To accomplish this they 
set that grain of sand within a circle 
of perpetual electric force, a field of 
strange force within which it was im- 
possible to grow or dwindle in size, 
as the atomic people had done, by 
changing the frequency of etheric 
vibration. Thus the people of the 
atom were locked foi'ever within their 
own tiny universe. 

“This accomplished, they covered 
the sand-grain and the forces they 
placed around it, setting over them a 
great stone, on which was written the 
history of what had happened, and 
which warned whoever might find the 
stone in the future never to tamper 
with or change what had been done, 
lest they loose again the atomic in- 
vaders upon the Earth and the super- 
world alike. Having done this, the 
superpeople left the Earth to its own 
devices, and passed up into their 
own greater universe. 

“Came then, on Earth, the pain-j 
ful upward surge of changing, as- 
cending species, the long road from 
anthropoid to troglodyte to modern 
man. The structures of the atomic 
people crumbled soon, until only a 
few remnants were left. Over all 
the world it was as if their invasion 
had never been, nor did men dream 
that such people had held the Earth 
ages before themselves. And up in 
a Scottish hill, under a great stone 
that was covered by the drifting dirt 
of ages, lay a grain of sand that held 
war and death and terror, in a single 
atom of which the atomic people 
were prisoned for all time.

“C UCH was the colossal epic the in- 
^scription narrated. And it was 
so convincing that neither Powell nor 
I doubted it. But now a dispute 
arose between us. I believed that we 



170 



WEIRD TALES 



should heed the warning of the in- 
scription and not delve farther into 
the thing, lest we loose dread upon 
the world. But Powell was afire with 
curiosity and w r ould not listen. So, 
with help, we removed the great cir- 
cular stone and set it to one side. 
And beneath it, as it had foretold, 
we found the sand-grain that held 
the atomic world. 

“Under the circular stone was a 
cube of the same smooth rock, some 
six feet square. On the upper sur- 
face of this cube was set a small plate 
of smooth metal, at the center of 
which lay the sand-grain, set in the 
metal. Around this metal plate, em- 
bedded within the surface of the 
cube, was a circle of seven little 
blocks, that glowed steadily with a 
feeble purple light. In daylight the 
little blocks seemed merely purple in 
color, and it was only in darkness 
that their luminosity became appar- 
ent. Without doubt that circle of 
glowing blocks was the producer of 
the force mentioned in the inscrip- 
tion, the force that made size-chang- 
'ing impossible within their field, that 
held the atomic people prisoners in 
the sand-grain. 

“From that day onward Powell 
took me less and less into his con- 
fidence.. He had fitted up a small 
laboratory near the cabin, and began 
working there 'on some problem con- 
nected with what he had found. Once 
or twice he consulted me eoncernirig 
the meaning of certain technical 
parts of the inscription, but aside 
from thgt he told me nothing of what 
he was doing, and I decided that I 
was wasting time to stay. It was on 
the very day that I meant to tell 
Powell so, and leave, that he came 
running toward me excitedly, with 
the news that his experiment had 
succeeded. 

“And when I found the nature of 
that experiment I w r as astounded. 
He had been attempting to follow up 
the sparse details given in the in- 



scription and rediscover the method 
of changing size. And he had done 
it! He showed me the apparatus he 
had worked out, a compact black ease 
which strapped around his chest and 
which would cause everything within 
its field of action to grow or decrease 
in size. And standing there on the 
hilltop, he grew in size until he 
towered up a giant of a hundred feet, 
then dwindled until he was an inch 
in height, a tiny manikin. 

“He was exultant, and I thought 
that at last he would leave the hill- 
top, and cover the sand-grain once 
more. I pointed out to him what 
good he might accomplish in the 
world with that great power, but he 
only snarled at me and for the first 
time revealed his intention. He was 
planning to dwindle in size until he 
could enter that atomic world, to go 
down into the sand-grain, to the 
atomic universe. 

“Short of force, I used all my ef- 
forts to prevent him, for I was aghast 
at such a plan. But he went on, un- 
heeding, making his preparations for 
the trip. He dug out and removed 
the little circle of blocks around the 
sand-grain, then gradually began to 
dwindle in size until he was a tiny 
figure a few inches high, standing on 
the metal circle near the grain of 
sand. Smaller and smaller he be- 
came, until he vanished entirely from 
my sight, and I knew that he had en- 
tered the sand-grain. 

“For three days I w r atched beside 
the stone cube, waiting for his re- 
turn. It was toward evening of the 
third day that he finally came back, 
a tiny upright form on the metal 
plate that grew 7 swiftly to the man I 
knew. He had come back. 

“He had come back — but changed. 
He seemed to be filled with an im- 
mense excitement, to be spurred on 
by some hidden purpose. He gave 
small answer to my flood of ques- 
tions. He had found the atomic 
world, had been guided down into 



THE ATOMIC CONQUERORS 



171 



that particular atom of the grain by 
‘certain signs,’ a phrase which he 
did not explain. As to the people of 
the atom, he said only that there 
were many of them and that they 
were ‘different.’ More he would not 
tell me, and my fear, my misgivings, 
increased. 

“npHE night of disaster rushed up- 
on us, a week afj,er his return. 
I was asleep in the cabin while Pow- 
ell worked, as I thought, in the lab- 
oratory. Some time after midnight 
I woke and sensed that Powell was 
not in the cabin. I dressed hurried- 
ly, and found that he was not in the 
laboratory either. Instantly I knew 
where he was and hurried up to the 
hilltop, and to the pit on that hilltop 
that held the stone cube and the 
sand-grain.. 

“He was standing on the edge of 
that pit, watching intensely, but at 
the sound of my approach he wheeled 
instantly, holding a little stone cone 
in his hand, the end of which glowed 
suddenly with dull green light. 

“At the same moment I fell in a 
heap to the ground and lay there 
quite motionless, seemingly para- 
lyzed, unable to move a muscle. And 
Powell laughed. He mocked and 
taunted me and for the first time dis- 
closed the depth of his plans. He 
was going to loose once more the 
atomic invaders upon our world. He 
had gone down into their world and 
conspired with those in power there, 
promising to free them from the 
world where they were prisoners, to 
release them upon the Earth and the 
superworld. 

“First, he boasted, the atomic in- 
vaders were to strike at the world be- 
yond this, at the superworld, to stab 
out unexpectedly at their ancient en- 
emies in that greater universe, crush- 
ing them by an unlooked-for attack. 
Then, free from any possible inter- 
ference, the invading hordes would 
sweep over Earth; and he laughed 



wildly as he pictured to me the de- 
struction of the races of man and 
their works, dwelling especially on 
the fear and terror of his (Powell’s) 
enemies. For the first time I saw 
that the man was completely insane, 
an embittered maniac who secreted 
hate for all mankind as the result of 
his wrongs, real or fancied. 

“Even while he spoke, a slight 
humming sound arose from the pit. 
The humming waxed swiftly to a 
loud droning, then up from the pit 
floated a black disk, some three feet 
across and swiftly growing. Hover- 
ing a few feet above the ground, it 
continued to grow, and the droning 
became a loud booming, a tremen- 
dous rumbling thunder.. Even as I 
stared at it, lying there, I fathomed 
the cause of that rolling thunder, 
knew that it was the sudden expan- 
sion of the disk that beat out. those 
thick waves of sound. The disk grew 
until it was perhaps thirty feet 
across, then ceased expanding. It 
slid gently down toward us until it 
was nearly touching the ground, and 
I saw that it was crowded with dark 
shapes that pushed toward the rail to 
stare down at us. 

“Then down from the edge came 
a folding metal ladder, and clamber- 
ing down this ladder came three 
creatures, shapes grotesque and ter- 
rible, three of the atomic people. 

“I had thought of them as being 
somewhat human, perhaps with dif- 
ferent features or coloring, but still 
essentially human. But these things ! 
They were reptilian, saurian! In 
height they were a little under the 
human standard, and their figures 
were even roughly human in shape, 
with the head carried erect, a squat, 
powerful body, two thick, bowed low- 
er limbs, and two short arms, ending 
in cruel, curved talons. But with that 
rough travesty on the human shape, 
all resemblance ceased. To begin 
with, the things were completely cov- 
ered with thick, hard scales, like 



172 



WEIRD TALES 



those of a crocodile. Their heads 
were peaked, instead of round, with 
gaping, fanged mouths and small, 
black, glittering eyes, browless and 
lashless like the eyes of a snake. They 
were noseless and earless, and their 
only sign of clothing was a queer 
sort of metallic armor that seemed 
more designed to carry their weapons 
than as clothing. 

“Lying there motionless, regard- 
ing them with sickened horror, I saw 
the three advance to Powell, who 
greeted them with a queer gesture. 
One brought forth a tablet like a 
small slate, on which he wrote, then 
passed it to Powell, who studied it, 
then wrote in turn and handed it 
back. Evidently such writing was 
Powell’s only means of communica- 
tion with the things. For a few min- 
utes they conferred in that fashion 
with Powell, then returned to the 
disk, which immediately ascended 
from its hovering position on the hill- 
top. 

“As it rose it grew, spreading out 
swiftly in ever-expanding size, grow- 
ing until it had shut off the light of 
all the stars for a few seconds, then 
seemingly breaking up into small 
masses, cloudily disappearing. * It 
had become so large that it was in- 
visible, had passed from this uni- 
verse into that greater one. For a 
moment I wondered if its momentary 
eclipse of the stars would cause any 
star-gazer to guess at what was hap- 
pening, then realized that to any 
chance watcher of the sky it would 
seem only like a drifting cloud, if 
noticed at all. 

“Again rose the humming from 
the pit, many times louder, growing 
to an ear-splitting thunder as another 
force of the atomic people floated up 
from the pit, a great mass of tiny 
black circles, miniatures of the first 
disk, that drifted up and rose at once 
into the air, not stopping to confer 
with Powell as had the first. And as 
that mass of disks rose above the hill- 



top, the familiar droning was again 
waxing louder as another mass of 
them came up. 

“How many of the disks streamed 
up from the atom while I lay there, 
I can not guess. Their number 
seemed infinite, but my memories are 
fragmentary, disjointed. I must have 
been unconscious for a few minutes 
at least, for I remember that amid 
the rumbling thunder of the rising 
disks, as I watched Powell, who was 
gazing triumphantly at their com- 
ing, a dizzying blackness seemed to 
descend on my brain, and when con- 
sciousness returned the last mass of 
disks was rising from the pit, vanish- 
ing like the others in the sky above. 

“T Tntil now Powell had held me 

^ prisoner with the glowing cone, 
which he had placed on the ground 
before conferring with the atomic 
people, so that it held me prisoner 
without his attention. Now he picked 
it up and permitted me to re-enter 
the cabin, where he forced me to lie 
down in the bunk, then placed the 
cone again on the table in the room, 
still pointing toward me, still holding 
me a prisoner, powerless to move. 

“'Why he did not kill me outright, 
I can not say. I think it was only be- 
cause he desired someone, even a 
prostrate enemy, to whom he might 
boast of what he was doing, that he 
desired someone to know the power 
and the menace that he really was. It 
must have been so, for the next day 
he boasted for hours to me of what 
he was doing. He spoke of the great 
force of invaders I had seen, and said 
that even by that time their numbers 
and mighty weapons would have 
crushed into submission the people of 
the superworld. 

“He spoke, too, of the paralyzing 
cone that held me prisoner, a weapon 
which he had brought back from the 
atomic world, and revealed that he 
had another one on his person also. It 
was, he said, a ray that neutralized 



THE ATOMIC CONQUEKORS 



173 



the electric messages in the nervous 
system, thus wiping out the com- 
mands of the brain in that system, so 
that while reflex actions like the 
breathing of the lungs and beating of 
the heart were unaffected, the con- 
scious commands of the brain to the 
muscles were nullified, paralyzing 
those muscles. 

“All of that day, and all through 
the next night, I lay in the bunk 
without moving a muscle, save only 
an' hour in which he permitted me to 
eat, I heard him leave the cabin 
early the next morning, the second 
after the coming of the invaders, this 
very morning. Lying there, I listened 
with dull despair to the wind slam- 
ming the door of the cabin. The cone 
on the table was in the line of my 
vision and suddenly I gasped with 
hope, for at a particularly hard slam 
that cone had rolled a little way 
toward the table’s edge. I waited 
breathless. Then, just as my hope 
was beginning to die, the door 
slammed to with all the wind’s force 
behind it and the cone rolled from 
the table to the floor, breaking and 
exploding there in a flash of intense 
green light, 

“My first move was to search the 
cabin for a gun, but there was none. 
The cabin stood at the edge of the 
bare and treeless hilltop, and from 
its window I could see Powell’s head 
bobbing about in the pit of the sand- 
grain, as he prepared for the coming 
of the second force of invaders. I 
knew that he must be imprisoned or 
killed at once, but knew too that he 
carried with him another of the para- 
lyzing cones, so that I dared not rush 
him on the open hilltop. Neither 
could I remain in the cabin, so my 
only chance was to make my way to 
the nearest village and get help, or at 
least, a gun. 

“So I slipped out a rear window 
and got safely away without being 
seen by him. All of this morning it 
took me to get down the hill, and 



when I met you here I knew I should 
not have time to get to a village as I 
had planned, but must go back and 
do what I could myself. And now I 
have told you all.. Up on that hill 
Powell is awaiting the second in- 
vasion of those monsters from the 
atom, an invasion that will annihilate 
our world. If we can overpower him 
and replace the glowing blocks 
around the sand-grain, we shall have 

prevented disaster. If not But 

do you believe the story? Will you 
help me?” 

Hunter answered slowly, his brain 
whirling from the things he had 
heard. “It’s so incredible,” he be- 
gan, “biit the booming sounds you 
mentioned, they heard that in Lead- 
anfoot. It seems so queer, though 

” Suddenly he thrust a hand 

toward Marlowe. “I believe you,” 
he told him. “I want to help.” 

The other gripped his hand silent- 
ly, then glanced up at the sun. “We 
have, perhaps, four hours,” he said, 
rising. Hunter, too, jumped to his 
feet, and for a moment they looked 
together up the dark sides of Ker- 
achan Hill. 

Presently the two men were forg- 
ing steadily up that hillside. They 
spoke little and their faces were set, 
drawn. The sun was falling ever 
more swiftly toward the west, and al- 
ways their eyes measured the dist- 
ance between that descending sun 
and the horizon. 

By the time they surmounted the 
first rough heights and began their 
progress up the thinly-wooded upper 
half of the hill, the gray veils of twi- 
light were already obscuring the sur- 
rounding country. Over peaks and 
valleys, over forests and grassy fields, 
lay a strange silence, ominous, fore- 
boding.. As they toiled up toward 
the summit through the thickening 
dusk, it seemed to Hunter that the 
whole world was silent, breathless, 
tensely waiting 



174

C omplete darkness had fallen when 
Marlowe turned and made a cau- 
tioning gesture. 

“We are very near the summit 
now,” he told Hunter, in a whisper. 
“For God’s sake, go quietly.” 

Together they crept upward, 
through thick underbrush and over 
.jagged rocks, until they crouched at 
the edge of the smooth, grassy space 
that was the hill’s summit. This 
summit was not exactly level, but 
sloped down from them in a slight 
grade, and at its center Hunter saw 
the black, yawning hole Marlowe had 
mentioned, the pit that held the sand- 
grain. 

Marlowe was tugging at his sleeve. 
“Powell — down at the other edge,” 
he whispered, excitedly. 

Glancing down to that farther edge 
of the summit, Hunter saw there a 
thin, spare figure dimly outlined 
against the stars, the figure of a man 
who was gazing silently at the 
twinkling lights of a distant village. 
And over to their right, at the very 
edge of the bare summit, was the 
rough dark mass that he knew must 
be the small cabin. Again Marlowe 
twitched his sleeve. 

v “We must rush him from both 
sides,” he told Hunter. “You crawl 
around the right side of the summit 
and I will take the left, and when 
you get near enough, go for him. 
Don’t give him time to get that cone 
out.” With a whispered “good 
luck,” he wrung Hunter’s hand and 
began to creep stealthily around the 
left edge of the hilltop. 

His heart pounding violently, 
Hunter crept forward on the right 
side, toward the man at the summit’s 
edge, who still stood motionless, 
watching the distant lights. Hunter 
wondered where Marlowe was, in the 
darkness. By now he was crawling 
past the open door of the cabin, keep- 



ing close within the shadow of the 
little building. 

From that point he could glimpse, 
in the starlight, the profile of the 
man they stalked. A strong, mad 
face it was, with burning eyes be- 
neath a mass of gleaming, iron-gray 
hair, a face that was turned toward 
the south and its distant lights as 
though fascinated by them. 

Suddenly Powell laughed, and at 
the unexpected sound Hunter 
stopped short, on hands and knees. 
A bitter, mocking laughter it was, 
that sickened the listening student. 
As it ceased, the man at the hill’s 
edge raised a clenched fist and shook 
it at the distant lights. And his voice 
rang out over the silent hilltop like 
the note of a warning bell. 

“O man, take heed!” 

Even while Powell voiced that cry 
of -hate and menace, Hunter moved 
forward again. And at his first 
movement, his knee pressed down on 
a small stick that broke with the 
sound of a pistol-shot. 

Instantly Powell turned, his hand 
flashing down to his pocket and 
emerging with a small object in its 
grasp. As Hunter gathered himself 
for a swift, desperate spring, that 
object glowed out, a tiny circle of 
luminous green, and the young stu- 
dent sank back to the ground, de- 
prived of all power of motion by the 
paralyzing cone. Powell advanced 
toward him, holding the cone out- 
stretched. 

“So you escaped, Marlowe,” he 
said, and Hunter realized that in the 
darkness the man had mistaken him 
for his former prisoner. Powell was 
speaking on. “I think that I’ll stop 
your interference now, for good. Not 
that I have any personal animus 
against you, I assure you, but I can’t 
allow you to disrupt the plans I have 
made.” As he said this, mockingly, 
he carefully placed the cone on a 
small mound of earth, so that its rays 
still held Hunter paralyzed. Then he

straightened, and was reaching for 
the pistol at his belt when a dark 
figure sprang from behind, dashing 
him to earth. Marlowe ! 

The thought beat through Hunt- 
er ’s brain as he lay, unable to twitch 
a muscle, watching the combat of 
those two figures that reeled about, 
striking, kicking, twisting. But what 

was that ? What? That thin 

humming that suddenly made itself 
heard, that grew to a droning, to a 
rumbling, reverberating thunder. Out 
of the pit a dark shape was drifting 
up, a black disk that grew, grew, 
grew. 

Boom! Boom! Boom! It grew un- 
til it had attained a diameter of thir- 
ty feet, then hovered above the pit, 
near the struggling men.. As he 
glimpsed it, Marlowe cried out de- 
spairingly, and Powell’s mad laugh- 
ter flung up. And now was a sud- 
den stir at the edge of the hovering 
disk, a flurry of movement there. 
Hunter darkly glimpsed shapes that 
crowded about the disk’s edge, that 
peered at the struggling men. Did 
they mistake the two as a menace to 
themselves, did they fail to recognise 
Powell? For even as the two men 
reeled in battle toward the disk, a 
blinding shaft of blue light stabbed 
out from the disk’s edge and struck 
the struggling pair. Under that ray 
and in its light, Hunter saw the faces 
of the two men change horribly, stiff- 
en, draw, crack, and over him swept 
a breath of utter cold, an icy little 
wind that seemed to freeze his blood. 

An instant he saw Powell and Mar- 
lowe thus, staggering, reeling, fall- 
ing, then they had collapsed to a 
shapeless heap on the ground, and the 
blue ray, striking out past them, had 
touched the glowing cone on the little 
mound, which instantly exploded 
with a flash of light, releasing Hunter 
from its prisoning power. 

The blue ray -was sweeping in a 
eirele about, the hilltop now, and 
with sudden frantie fear he crawled 



through the open door of the dark 
cabin, crouching in a comer of it 
fearfully. Suddenly the ray swept 
up to the cabin, and beneath its touch 
the glass of the windows cracked 
instantly. An icy puff of air again 
swept over Hunter, in his corner, as 
the ray swept through the open door 
and hung steady for a moment. 

Its blue light illumined a little 
metal stove opposite the door, a stove 
that covered instantly with a l'ime of 
frost and ice at the ray’s touch. A 
moment the ray hung thus, steadily, 
doubtfully, then abruptly vanished, 
as though snapped out. Hunter 
sighed chokingly. 

The humming sounds began again 
outside, and his fear mastered by 
curiosity, he crept to the cracked 
window. A mass of tiny black circles 
was rising from the pit, floating up 
and growing at the same time, while 
the first disk hung to one side, watch- 
ing. The black circles rose high, ex- 
panded almost instantly to the size of 
the first, were joined by that first 
disk. 

For a minute Hunter watched the 
disks circling above, swirling about in 
an eddying mass. Then three de- 
tached from those above and sank 
down to the hilltop, hovering close 
above it and sweeping it ever and 
again with the deadly blue ray that 
eame and went across the cabin 
while he watched. The other disks, 
more than a score in number, grouped 
in a compact formation, then raced 
swiftly south. 

The vanguard of the atomic con- 
querors, loosed at last upon the world 
of man !

Tt is doubtful if we shall ever know 
-*■ the exact purpose of that first raid 
on the atomic invaders. That ques- 
tion might be solved if we knew how 
much information they had received 
from Powell regarding our Earth. 
As it is, we look on that first coming 



176 



WEIRD TALES 



as an effort, not so much to destroy 
as to disorganize, to terrorize. Doubt- 
less it was their plan to break up all 
chance of organized opposition in 
England by a series of swift and 
deadly blows, then take over the 
island at their leisure and make it 
the base of their future operations. 

Whatever their intentions, they 
passed over all northern England 
without stopping, and the world first 
became aware of their presence when 
they struck with terrific force- at 
Manchester and Liverpool, succes- 
sively. 

There is no clear, coherent account 
of their coming to Manchester. The 
survivors saw that hour of dread 
through a haze of terror, and it was 
long before all accounts were pieced 
together to make a reasonably com- 
plete story of the happenings there. 
One sees, through those horror-strick- 
en tales, a terror descending without 
warning out of the darkness, on the 
unsuspecting city beneath. No doubt 
the streets were crowded, and the- 
aters and show-windows ablaze, all 
the life and stir of early .evening. 
Then a swift gathering of dark 
shapes above, the deadly blue ray 
Hashing down on the streets, searing 
in icy path of death across the city. 

It must have been utterly incom- 
prehensible destruction to those be- 
low. Even now we scarcely under- 
stand the nature of that blue ray, the 
Cold Ray, as it is now called.. We 
know that all things in its path act- 
ed as if under the influence of ex- 
treme, unheard-of cold, absolute 
:ero. It was exactly as if the inva- 
ders had concentrated utter cold and 
burled it forth in a single stabbing 
ray. Strictly speaking, of course, 
there is no such thing as positive 
•old, only absence of heat. The 
1 heory generally accepted now is that 
in some unexplained manner the ray 
bad the power of instantly sucking 
away the heat of anything it touched. 

Certain it is that the ray was a 



terrible weapon. Beneath it, flesh 
and blood froze immediately into 
black hard lumps, metal cracked, 
trees and plants shriveled instantly. 
It is curious to note that the action 
of the ray was highly localized, that 
it could slay one man w T hile another 
man ten feet away would feel only 
a sudden breath of intense cold. 

As it swept steadily along the 
streets of Manchester that night, over- 
taking the fleeing crowds and leav- 
ing them in shapeless heaps, it must 
have seemed like the very day of 
doom to those below. They speak of 
it as enduring for hours, that time 
that the invaders hung above the 
city, while in reality the disks re- 
mained over Manchester somewhat 
less than twenty minutes. How many 
Avere slain in that time it is impos- 
sible to guess. The city, at least, was 
thrown into a wild intense panic, 
and no doubt that was the purpose of 
the invaders. That accomplished, 
they gathered together and sped 
away to the west, to Liverpool. 

The story of the massacre at Liver- 
pool is almost identical with that at 
Manchester. There too the disks 
struck down with icy death at the 
city, but one curious feature differ- 
entiates the Liverpool account. It 
seems that as the Cold Ray swept 
around the city, it crossed, ever and 
again, the city’s harbor and the sea 
outside. And for many days after- 
ward, immense icebergs of unprece- 
dented size ranged the English coast, 
born of that striking of the ocean by 
the blue ray. 

At Manchester and Liverpool, and 
even as far south as Birmingham, the 
invaders came down without warn- 
ing, striking unexpectedly, spreading 
death and dread, then racing away. 
But some time before they reached 
London, word of the attacks on the 
northern cities had been received, and 
men waited, ready for battlfe, so that 

it was over London that the atomic 

/

people and the forces of man clashed 
for the first time. 

It was the assumption of the War 
Office in London that Manchester 
and Liverpool had been attacked by 
the airplanes of some continental 
power, without the formality of a 
declaration of war. Certainly they 
did not dream of the real nature of 
the menace that was speeding to- 
ward them. 

Presently, from all the air-sta- 
tions around the city, plane after 
plane was spiraling up, while in a 
great ring around London the giant 
searchlights stabbed the night, sweep- 
ing the sky in search of the in- 
vaders. Even while the planes as- 
cended and hung in a thin line high 
above the eity, thunder was growl- 
ing, low and ominous, and lightning 
flickering across the sky. 

It was with this gathering storm 
that the disks raced down toward 
the city, never glimpsing the line of 
planes above. For a space of min- 
utes they hung motionless, surveying 
the shining, splendid metropolis. The 
streets below, temporarily deserted 
beneath the coming storm, were like 
brilliant rivers of light, connecting 
the lakes of luminescence that were 
the squares. One imagines the in- 
vader’s in the disks staring down at 
the city in amazement, if their rep- 
tilian natures possessed the power. 
As they hung there, the beam of one 
of the questing searchlights caught 
them and held them, and the stabbing 
rays of the other lights shifted to 
them at once, bathing the disks in a 
flood of white light. Then, from 
high above, the airplanes drove down 
upon them and the battle had be- 
gun. 

One can see that battle clearest, 
perhaps, through the eyes of a single 
individual, a certain young Brown- 
ell who was the pilot of a single-seat- 
er combat plane. At the first orders 
he had taken the air almost joyously, 
with the exciting thought that at 



last his training was to be tested in 
actual battle. He thrilled to the 
thought, as with the other planes he 
swooped down upon the disks. 

Down he went and down, diving 
toward a single disk that hung at 
some distance from the mass of its 
fellows,. His hands grasped the con- 
trol of the plane’s machine-gun, and 
even above the roar of the motor he 
heard the pup-pup-pup-pup of the 
gun, spraying bullets on the disk. He 
swept down onto that disk and over 
it in a great curve, passing above it 
at a height of a few yards. As he 
flashed over it, the lightning flared 
out blindingly above, and as he caught 
momentary sight of the things on the 
disk, his hands trembled on the con- 
trols. He had glimpsed a mass of up- 
turned heads, scaled and peaked, 
with fanged and gaping mouths. For 
the first time he saw the creatures of 
dread he was fighting. As he drove 
up above the battle and banked and 
circled for another swoop, his hands 
were still trembling. 

From below came the popping of 
bombs, a few of which scored hits on 
the disks, most of which plunged 
down toward the city below, misses. 
The roar of their detonation seemed 
feeble beside the crash of the thun- 
der, which was now rumbling forth 
almost continuously. Away to the 
left of the battle, two planes collided 
and dropped swiftly to earth, trail- 
ing long streamers of red flames, 
blazing comets plunging earthward 
through the upper darkness. 

And now, their first shock of sur- 
prize over, the invaders struck back, 
and the blue ray flashed up, search- 
ing out and finding the planes, 
whose wings shriveled and collapsed 
beneath its touch. Two of the disks 
had been forced down by lucky hits 
with bombs, but the others were al- 
most unscathed, and now the planes 
were falling ever more rapidly be- 
neath the Cold Ray. 



178 



WEIRD TALES 



Suddenly, from high above, a 
single plane rushed down toward 
the massed disks, in a dizzying nose- 
dive. The blue ray stabbed up 
from a dozen disks to meet it, but it 
plunged on, smashed down into one 
of the disks, and plane and disk 
whirled together down to earth, the 
latter spilling out a mass of grotesque 
figures that raced it in its fall. 

Brownell shouted hoarsely as he 
saw. From all around planes were 
diving down now, smashing squarely 
into the disks and falling with them, 
a deliberate heroic suicide on the part 
of their pilots. An immense exalta- 
tion ran through Brownell, that vast, 
forceful rapture of heroism that can 
sweep men up to titanic heights. He 
circled again, then dipped the plane’s 
nose sharply and rushed down upon 
a single disk like a falling plummet. 

Pup-pup-pup — at the last m6ment 
he clung to the gun-control. Rush of 
wind past him — flash of lights — a 
roaring in his ears — the disk was 
nearer, rushing swiftly up to him — 
nearer — nearer — crash ! 

Then plane and disk were tumbling 
down to earth together, speeding- 
down to the brilliant streets below, 
crashing down near the docks, where 
something in the wrecked disk ex- 
ploded with stunning force. 

Above, the battle was all but fin- 
ished. Only a few of the planes re- 
mained and the blue ray was search- 
ing these out, one by one. Present- 
ly the invaders held the air alone, 
nine disks remaining of the twenty 
or more that had begun the attack. 
The city below was at their mercy, 
but they did not heed it. Circling 
and forming, they massed again to- 
gether, then moved away to the 
north, seemingly daunted by the 
fierce and unexpected resistance they 
had met. They had conquered, but 
at a price that disinclined them for 
further battle at that time. 

The people in the city below waited 
tensely, but no more aerial wrecks 



whirled down upon them. And the 
ever-questing searchlights revealed 
no sign of plane or disk over the 
city. Through all London reigned a 
deathlike silence, that first moment 
of astounded silence before the hoarse 
roar of fear and rage that would roll 
through the city. Only the deep 
rumble of thunder broke the stillness. 

Across the sky the lightning flared 
again, once, twice. Then down upon 
the city swept the lashing, flooding 
rain.

I t is to young Hunter’s story that 
one must turn again for an ac- 
count of the invaders’ movements 
after that first raid. Crouched 
by the window, he saw them return- 
ing from the battle, nine scarred 
disks returning where more than a 
score had gone out. For the first time 
it struck him that possibly the forces 
of man might have checked the first 
rush of the invaders. He wondered 
intensely as to that. 

During all of that period of hours 
while the disks had been fighting and 
killing and terrorizing England, he 
had not dared to escape from the cab- 
in, for the three guardian disks still 
hung very low above the hilltop, and 
the blue ray constantly swept about, 
that summit, marking a path of 
death. The guardians were taking- 
no chances of anyone tampering with 
the sand-grain, of doing harm to 
their own world, that lay within that 
grain. 

And now, when the defeated nine 
returned, he saw that his chances of 
escape were even less. For except 
for one disk, that dropped down into 
the pit, dwindling and vanishing, 
these returned disks took up a posi- 
tion with the watchful three, hover- 
ing low over the hilltop. Now and 
then one would sweep up into the 
sky, cix-cle for a time, then return to 
its position over the summit of Kei’- 
a'chan. 



THE- ATOMIC CONQUERORS 



179 



Hunter wondered intensely what 
the mission of the disk that returned 
into the sand-grain had been. A call 
for aid, for reinforcements? The 
waiting attitude of the others seemed 
to indicate that. Dawn had come, 
and with its gray light he moved 
silently about the little cabin, finding 
food in plenty and bolting a hasty, 
uncooked meal, then returning to his 
position of observation by the win- 
dow. 

All over the world that day was 
wonder. The news of the battle over 
London, of the death that smote the 
northern cities, had flashed out over 
all the Earth, bringing surprize and 
doubt and fear to cities far away. A 
wave of terror rolled over the British 
Isles, and already the Channel was 
crowded with the shipping that bore 
away the first great crowds of the im- 
pending exodus. 

The theory of attack by a foreign 
power had collapsed, and as men ex- 
amined the crushed, mangled bodies 
found in the wreckage of the disks at 
London, they realized that Earth was 
invaded by creatures wholly diffei’ent 
from man, but superior in power. It 
was but natural that they should con- 
ceive these invaders as arriving from 
another planet, and that was the 
theory held by all. 

In every mind was the thought that 
the invaders had retired only tem- 
porarily, that they would return to 
spread terror and death again. The 
disks had been discovered, hovering 
watchfully over Kerachan Hill, and 
from all the country about that hill 
the inhabitants poured forth, chok- 
ing the roads in their frantic haste to 
escape from the vicinity. By eve- 
ning of that day, less than twenty- 
four hours after the first coming of 
the disks, it is doubtful if a single liv- 
ing person with the exception of 
Hunter remained within ten miles of 
the hill. 

It strikes one as curious that the 
invaders, during all that day, made 



no effort to destroy or kill in that 
vicinity. They simply hung above 
the hill, hovering and circling rest- 
lessly, waiting, as it seemed to Hunt- 
er. Waiting, he thought, for the re- 
turn of the messenger who had gone 
back down into the atomic world. 

Once only they struck, late in the 
day. A force of field artillery had 
been ordered down from Glasgow 
with orders to shell the hill that was 
evidently the base of the invaders. 
Men and guns and horses rattled 
south along the rough road, under 
the hot afternoon sun. High above 
them a black speck suddenly ap- 
peared in the blue, the shape of a 
watching disk that swept down to in- 
vestigate. A few ineffectual rifle- 
shots were fired as the disk sank 
down toward them, then there was a 
bolting of men into the neighboring 
fields and hedges, a plunging of 
panic-maddened horses as the dark 
shape loomed above. Then, the frosty 
blue Cold Ray, springing down from 
the disk, leaping swiftly along the 
.road in a trail of icy death, pursuing 
and exterminating the running men 
in the fields. A moment the disk hov- 
ered and turned, then swept swiftly 
back up into the blue. 

No man in that battery returned 
to Glasgow to report its fate, and 
when three planes were ordered south 
to investigate, none returned. There- 
after no more such futile attempts 
were made. 

That night there was utter dark- 
ness in every city in England, for 
strict orders were given and enforced 
that no spark of light should betray 
a city’s presence to the invaders. But 
though in all England, Europe, 
America, anxious people waited 
through the night for news of an- 
other attack, the disks of the in- 
vaders still hovered above Kerachan 
Hill, waiting, waiting. 

. In southern England masses of air- 
craft collected, the combined air- 
power of England and France, await-

ing the invaders’ return. And 
through the English roads, meeting 
and passing the sea-bound masses of 
refugees, rolled the tanks, the guns, 
the long brown masses of marching- 
soldiers. Mankind was gathering 
itself for the straggle, but through 
all those masses ran an unspoken 
thought, an unvoiced fear. What 
avail were rifles and bombs against 
the smiting ray? Or airplanes and 
dirgibles against the swift and 
mighty disks? 

On a hilltop miles away from Ker- 
aehan men lay hidden, with pow- 
erful telescopes and radio-transmit- 
ters, ready to flash word of the in- 
vaders’ movements to all the Earth. 
And all the Earth waited tensely for 
that word, w r ondering, hoping, fear- 
ing. 

The bright morning of that day 
passed, the second since the first 
night raid of the invaders.. And all 
through that morning no word came 
from the hidden watchers. Two 
hours of the afternoon had passed 
when a message finally came, short, 
concise. It said only, “Disks are 
gathering in immense force above 
Kerachan Hill and are evidently pre- 
paring to move.” 

That message, short as it was, was 
sufficient to cause the last stable 
forms of life in England to break up, 
melt away. Those crowds of people 
who had remained, hoping against 
hope, now fought their way madly 
toward the sea-coast, to escape, to 
life. Over those fleeing hordes ran a 
shout, a threat, a warning. “They 
are coming!” They called it to one 
another, autos racing through country 
villages shouted it, the mobs on the 
roads voiced it fearfully, soldiers 
resting by the wayside repeated it 
thoughtfully, looking toward the 
north. Over England, over Europe, 
over the whole world it ran, swiftly, 
terribly: 

“They are coming! They arc 
coming ! ’ ’ 



7 

A ND now the last great hour of 
Earth’s destiny was swiftly clos- 
ing down, with that massing of the 
invaders above the Scottish hills. 
Crouched beside the window of the 
cabin, Hunter watched them pouring 
up from the pit, from their atomic 
world, masses of tiny disks that grew 
with inconceivable speed to full size, 
that moved away and made room for 
the others to rise. Up, up, up, gigan- 
tic masses of the disks, countless 
hordes of the monsters they held, a 
vast force of invaders before which 
all human resistance would be vain, 
he knew. 

After that night of the invaders’ 
first attack on Earth, that night of 
his imprisoning in the cabin, he had 
watched through a day and another 
night and now well into this day, ex- 
cept for a few hours of sleep that he 
had snatched. Watching, waiting, 
fearful of -the ever-present guardian 
disks above, like them waiting, wait- 
ing. And now this flood of the disks, 
this up-springing of all their mighty 
forces. As he gazed at them now, 
floating up from the pit in dark, end- 
less masses, it seemed to him that the 
malignant spirit of Powell laughed 
again beside him. 

Boom! Boom! Boom! The rum- 
bling thunder of the expanding disks 
seemed to him like the sound of a 
mighty bell, tolling the end of the 
reign of man. Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! 

He glanced up, saw the hundreds 
of disks above spreading out in a long 
double line, in an irresistible forma- 
tion, awaiting the others that were 
still rising from the pit. But as 
Hunter watched them circling and 
forming above, the sky seemed to 
darken suddenly, the sunlight to be 
cut off, to vanish. And along the 
line of invaders above ran a quick 
start, a sudden nervous shock. 

Darker and darker grew the sky,

NE CAT 




“For this piece of work, you are no 
longer hangman and jailer,” said 
Queen Elizabeth, and there was in- 
dignation in her voice. 



F rom my earliest memory as a 
small child, I have hated cats. 
They fill me with an indescrib- 
able feeling of dread and horror that 
amotmts almost to an illness in their 
presence. Snakes I can bear, and of 
all other animals I am fond, but eats 
to me are creatures most loathsome. 

Mrs. 0 ’Flynn, my landlady, has a 
gray cat with a yellow spot on its 
head, as though the devil had brand- 
ed his servant with brimstone before 
sending it into the world. Such has 
always been my fancy of Mrs. 
O ’Flynn ’s cat. » 

But then I am queer. My friends 
— certain of them — apologize for me 
as queer. I have some fame as a 
writer of stories and they forgive me 
my queerness on that score. 

My name is Govern Ariste, a queer 
name. I have queer fancies and I 
number among my friends (those 
friends who do not apologize for me) 



queer people. Such a friend is Amir 
Das, who does not laugh at my hatred 
of cats, nor think me queer because 
of it. 

“For everything in the world, my 
friend, there is a reason,” this Amir 
Das, who is a Hindoo philosopher, 
has often told me. 

Tonight we discussed the matter 
again over our tea. Amir Das, it 
should be mentioned, is a graduate 
of Oxford, where he acquired an 
English fondness for afternoon tea. 
When he appears at my rooms before 
5 o’clock of an afternoon — and this 
is the time he most often chooses for 
his visits — it is Mrs. O’Flynn her- 
self who steps in and brews the cheer- 
ing beverage for us, after the man- 
ner that only one brought up in the 
“ould counthry” can. 

“As I have said,” the Hindoo con- 
tinued, ‘ ‘ for everything in this world 
or any other world, there is a reason. 
That is the law of all nature. For 

181

every cause there is an effect. For 
every effect there has been a cause. 

“I place my hand in that fire 
which flames on your hearth. It 
burns me and I take my hand away. 
Never will I put my hand in fire 
again. It has hurt me and I fear it. 
Cause has produced effect.. Do we 
desire knowledge? We must ever 
seek to know the causes of the effects 
we see. 

“Now this fear, this horror, you 
have for cats : when you were a baby, 
a small child perhaps, a cat fright- 
ened you?” 

“My mother says not, but that I 
cried at sight of one, even before I 
could talk, ’ ’ I told him. ‘ ‘ And she had 
always loved cats. She had five of 
the animals as pets at the time of my 
birth, but even as a baby I showed 
such signs of fright at them, she gave 
them, every one, away. We never 
had a cat afterward, 'and my dislike 
of the creatures continued as I grew 
older. ’ ’ 

“Then, my friend, your feeling 
for these animals is the unconscious 
remembrance of another life. Some- 
time, somewhere, misfortune came to 
you in the guise of a cat. We people 
of the East know these things to be 
true. 

“But you of the West, with your 
numerous schools and your much 
education, laugh at the thought that 
the ' soul may live through many 
lives, coming into different bodies, 
and acting different dramas, but 
learning each time a little bit more of 
that which it has willed to learn, and 
working all these experiences into one 
perfect plot in the end. 

“You laugh, although daily you 
see about you proof of the truth of 
these things, which my people have 
taught and known for ages. A man 
is introduced to a maiden, and with 
the meeting of their eyes he knows 
that she is the one among all others 
for whom he has been seeking. And 
she, too, meeting his ardent glance 



(for the soul looks out through the 
eyes) knows that he is the man of 
her heart. 

“Recognition leaps like a flash of 
electric flame between them. You of 
the West term it ‘love at first sight;’ 
but we of the East say ‘love, not at 
first sight, but love for each other 
many times in many lives has been 
the joy of that man and that maid..’ 
And insofar as they have loved truly 
in the past, they seek for and find 
the beloved again. Does not your 
Scripture say, ‘Love is stronger than 
the grave’? 

“Then have I not met the one I 
loved in the past,” I told him. 
“Many lives must I have loved my- 
self alone, for I have always been 
content to be a bachelor, and no wo- 
man has ever appeared to me as de- 
sirable above all other women. But 
we were speaking of cats, not love, 
my friend.” 

“We speak of reincarnation, the 
chapters of life, ’ ’ replied the Hindoo. 
“And your hatred of cats, Ariste, is 
doubtless part of a chapter now past 
— a chapter perhaps you are happier 
for not remembering. ’ ’ 

After some further talk of the 
same nature but more deeply philo- 
sophical, Amir Das left me to ponder 
his statements in the cozy firelight of 
the old-fashioned fireplace. This 
fireplace, together with Mrs. 
O ’Flynn’s tea-m'aking abilities, has 
kept me for many months a content- 
ed lodger in the warm-hearted Irish- 
woman’s house, in spite of the de- 
testable cat that she insists on keep- 
ing. 

The fiendish voice of this cat I now 
heard wailing from a distant part of 
the house. I presumed that probably 
it had been locked into some room, as 
it accompanied Mrs. O’Flynn, a 
prowling shadow, on one of her busy 
housewifely rounds. 

I watched the red fire on the 
hearth and thought of what my Hin- 
doo friend had said. I thought of

love and of eats, and holding my 
mind stilled, while I looked at the 
dancing flames, I tried to bring out 
of my memory some reason for my 
hatred of eats. 

2 

I must have dozed, for I started up 
from my seat confused and some- 
what dazed. As one who recalls the 
dim memories of a dream I remem- 
bered that I was Govern Ariste, a 

writer of stories, who lived in 

The memory of dreams dims as one 
wakes, and so did the memory of Gov- 
ern Ariste slip into the inaccessible 
places of my consciousness. 

But what matter? I, Peter By- 
field, poor young student in London 
Town, had long been given to dream- 
ing. I laughed at myself somewhat 
grimly to find that I had been enter- 
taining but one more fantastic fancy. 

J ‘ Ay ! Peter ! didst thou not dream 
so mueh, more wouldst thou accom- 
plish,” I scoffed to myself. Having 
lived for many years alone, I had 
acquired the habit of lonesome peo- 
ple who talk with themselves in lieu 
of better (or worse) company. 

The fire on the hearth was almost 
dead and I stooped to place upon it 
another fagot. Then I looked at the 
small pile of unbumed fagots by the 
hearthside, wondering how long they 
would last to keep some of the chill 
of London rain and fog out of my 
attic room. More fagots meant mon- 
ey, of which I had but little store. 

The hearth was of roughly cut 
stone and the attic room was humbly 
furnished with eot and chair and in 
one corner a table on which were 
strange crucibles and retorts, and 
above it a shelf whereon were books 
and manuscripts. But however hum- 
ble my room, it contained all the 
mysteries of life for me, save only 
one. 

That one I had met some days past 
in the queen’s hunting park, where 



unlawfully I sought for herbs and 
rocks that would help me in my stud- 
ies of alchemy. I had come upon 
this arch mystery of all, in an open 
space ' between the trees, dismounted 
beside her horse. In her hands she 
nursed a falcon with a broken wing. 

She was a tiny thing with red- 
gold curls, and in one cheek was a 
dimple that a man might not look 
upon over-long without a mad desire 
to kiss it. ' 

I, who shoxdd have fled because I 
broke the law by being in this place 
at all, stood transfixed', looking with 
heart and eyes at the vision before 
me. 

Then the maiden turned, raising 
her gaze to mine, and I saw that her 
eyes were of a blue like that of the 
sea on a calm summer afternoon. 
But more had they than color. They 
gave the man that looked into them 
a feeling of rest and harbor such as 
a voyager might have when after a 
long and w r eary journey to many 
ports, he comes at last home. 

As I looked into her eyes and she 
into mine, I knew not only that this 
was the most beautiful woman I had 
ever seen, but that she was my true 
love and that I could never care for 
any other. 1 forgot that I, although 
ambitious and the son of a noble 
father, was but a poor student, who 
might scarcely dare to love a high 
lady such as her appearance pro- 
claimed her to be. 

True, my studies were of alchemy, 
and should I find the philosopher ’s 
stone, in which men of that day be- 
lieved and foi^ which they spent long- 
years of study and search, I would 
have all power at my command. 

My father had been a noble of 
Henry Y Ill’s coui-t, but had dis- 
pleased the king and been forced to 
fine England. An adventurer, he had 
journeyed in many far countries, 
where he had studied strange sci- 
ences with stranger teachers, among 
them the Moorish teachers of Araby.,

In one of these foreign lands — I knew 
knew not where nor of what mother 
— I had been bom. 

And he had brought back to Eng- 
land with him in his old age, along 
with the small boy that was I, a 
marvelous collection of books and 
manuscripts. Some of these he had 
taught me to read. For others he 
had given me a clue to the inner 
meaning they contained. And for all 
he had inspired in me the thirst to 
understand, a thirst that had contin- 
ued with me unquenched after his 
death several years previously. 

Something I knew of the philoso- 
pher’s stone, by which base metal, 
such as lead, might be transmuted to 
gold, and by which old men had their 
old age renewed as youth. And for 
this philosopher’s stone I became 
one of the searchers, hoping with 
my experiments and the knowledge 
contained in my precious books that 
I might some day find the miracle- 
working talisman. 

Thus had my room, with its 
crucibles, retorts, books and potions 
among which I daily experimented, 
contained all the? mysteries of life for 
me, until the day I met in the royal 
park the Lady Edith Estes, attend- 
ant to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth. 

Then had I, Peter By field, taken 
back to my attic with the injured fal- 
con, whose wing I had promised to 
try to cure, the greatest and sweetest 
mystery of all — a mystery that pulsed 
in my heart like a song and that 
brought between my eyes and the 
books I would fain have studied, vi- 
sions of golden curls, a magic dimple 
and eyes like blue pooli? of heaven. 

The last mystery bid fair to put 
to rout and take the place of all the 
other mysteries whose solution I had 
so long sought. 

In my study of alchemy, I do not 
boast but say truly, I had learned 
more of physic than many physicians 
of my time. It thus happened that 
on the day I awoke from my 



strange dream of a life in which my 
name was Govern Ariste, I found 
the injured falcon apparently recov- 
ered. 

With all the skill that I possessed 
I had wound strips of cloth to bind 
the wing to the bird’s body, until the 
broken bones could grow together 
again. I had kept the restless falcon 
quiet by having it hooded all that 
time. Now I removed the hood and 
the bird flew about my room with 
wing but slightly stiff. I had made 
good my promise to the Lady Estes 
that I could cure her pet. 

Exultant that I had served my be- 
loved in even so small a thing, I 
caught the bird, hooded it again and 
chained it to my wrist. Then I went 
forth to seek its mistress. 

She had told me that I could ask 
for a certain servant at the palace, 
who in turn would call her. This I 
did and shortly found myself again 
in that radiant presence. Doffing my 
cap, I bowed low in the fashion of a 
courtier. 

My tongue, false friend, had left 
me. As at that other meeting in the 
park, I could say but a few stiff 
words, the while I told her of how it 
had been my great pleasure to cure 
so fine a bird. 

She had a purse in her hand, but 
my courtly manner must have made 
her know that I was no hireling to 
be paid with a gift of money. In- 
stead she gave me a more precious 
gift — the memory of her smile as she 
thanked me with gracious words. 

And I, having reflected well on 
the difference in station between a 
great court lady and a poor student, 
hastened to excuse myself, lest I for- 
get and throwing myself at her feet 
declare the passion I felt. 

Neither at the time she had found 
me in the park, nor now, did she 
make reference to the fact that it 
had been unlawful for me to wander 
in the royal hunting preserves. But 
any fear I might have had that 



THE BRIMSTONE CAT 



185 



she would make known her discovery 
of my presence there, had been for- 
gotten from the first glimpse of her. 

Even prison or punishment were 
well worth enduring for the X’apture 
that had become mine. So I mused 
as I turned my steps from the palace 
toward the poor tenement that held 
my attic room. 

In such a frame of mind it was 
that I came upon young Tom Smythe, 
the jailer’s son, and the cat that he 
tortured as sport for his companions. 
It was a gray cat, which later I dis- 
covered had a sulfur-colored patch 
upon its head. 

But at the time, I saw only the 
manner in which young Tom had 
tied the animal stretched out on its 
back with its four feet drawn by 
cords to four stakes, so that the boy 
might draw and quarter it, even as 
his father, Tom the hangman, had 
that day executed a poor wretch, 
sentenced to be drawn and quartered 
for treason to the crown. 

Around young Tom had gathered 
a crowd of admiring youngsters. 
Tom with a knife — who knows where 
small boys obtain the instruments for 
their devilments? — had raised his 
arm for the first stroke that would 
slit the cat’s body lengthwise. Mean- 
while, the animal yowled in an agony 
that but added to the glee of the 
spectators. 

Surely the memory of Govern 
Ariste was far from the thought of 
Peter Byfield, for I, Peter Byfield, 
on that day did not hate eats. I 
loved them, as I did all other ani- 
mals, and the sight of the tormented 
creature before me filled me with a 
great pity and a great rage at the 
young fiend who had undertaken this 
cruelty. 

With two strides I had parted the 
surprized children and seized the 
knife from the would-be executioner. 
Four strokes I made with it at the 
binding ropes, and the gray cat with 
a yellow spot upon its head bounded 



from the earth as only a frightened 
cat can and w r hisked up the roof of 
the nearest house to live eight more 
lives, fate favoring. 

Even then all might have been 
well, had not the rage of my heart 
demanded vengeance upon the per- 
son of the young rascal. The boy 
was a bully, the leader of all the lads 
of the neighborhood, but now I hum- 
bled him before the eyes of his 
frightened playmates. Right lustily 
I laid onto him, holding him across 
my knee with one hand and applying 
stout strokes with the other, until he 
wailed as loud as the cat had done. 
Nor did I heed nor care that a black 
hatred was born in the blubbering 
bully’s mind, when finally I released 
him. With short words I told him 
what measures I would take, should 
I again find him ill-treating a cat or 
any other animal. 

Then, wearied, and my thoughts 
once more turning to the vision of the 
Lady Edith Estes, I sought my lodg- 
ing, determined to work with re- 
newed effort in my search for the 
philosopher’s stone that meant wealth 
and fame and perchance the win- 
ning of my love. 

Late that night I worked, measur- 
ing and mixing new potions that 
might lead me to the elixir of life. 
As I bent to my task I was startled 
by a wailing cry from the roof of an 
adjoining house upon which my attic 
window looked out.. 

I opened the window, and a cat 
sprang into the room. It was a gray 
cat, with a yellow spot upon its head, 
a most vile and draggled-appearing 
eat, and it cried to me with plaintive 
insistence which bespoke its opinion 
that a life saved — even a cat’s life — 
w T as worth little, unless that life 
might have food and shelter. 

I gave the beast some of the gruel 
and milk that formed my simple sup- 
per. It ate and curled up on the 
hearth, purring and content. 



186 



WEIRD TALES 



Such was the manner in which I, 
Peter Byfield, came to make a com- 
panion and pet of the gray cat. 

3 

T n the day and age when Peter By- 

field rescued the gray eat, men 
held many superstitions. It was not 
well, even in that, England which was 
then coming to birth as a great na- 
tion and which allowed more freedom 
of thought and action to its inhab- 
itants than any other country, for a 
man to be too markedly different 
from his neighbors. Those who stud- 
ied alchemy might well be careful 
that they be not accused in the popu- 
lar mind as pursuing other and un- 
sanctified studies. 

Young Tom Smythe, whom Peter 
Byfield held over his knee and beat 
on the day the youth tried to draw 
and quarter the gray cat, chanced 
to fall ill of a colic the week after 
that episode. Young Tom had told 
his father, who was the chief hang- 
man of London Town, of the treat- 
ment accorded him by the alchemist. 

The elder Tom, although a brutal, 
evil fellow who could, and. did, on 
occasion beat his- son most cruelly, 
yet in this case resented the fact that 
a stranger had taken upon himself 
this parental task. He resented, 
furthermore, that the stranger had 
done this for so simple a cause as 
anger at the innocent boyish sport of 
executing a stray cat. Tom, the eld- 
er, when he heard the story, cursed 
that stranger and swore that he 
would have revenge upon him. 

When young Tom fell ill, after he 
had feasted uninvited of green apples 
stolen from a private garden, an ugly 
thought raised itself in the brain of 
his father. (Young Tom, it may be 
said, had told no one of the green 
apples.) 

Only a few days before, it had 
been the hangman’s pleasant duty to 
officiate at the last events in the life 



of a poor old woman, accused by her 
neighbors of witchcraft and of caus- 
ing a sickness among some children 
in her neighboi’hood. The wretched 
creature had been tried, tortured, 
and confessing under the torture, had 
been condemned to die as a witch. 

Tom senior had carried out the tor- 
ture which had made the victim ad- 
mit her guilt, and it had fallen to 
him, nothing loth, to tie the frantic 
woman to the stake and pile and light 
the fagots that destroyed her body 
and presumably carried her soul back 
to its master in his flaming pit. 

Now a cunning train of thought 
built itself up in Tom’s mind. A 
man of more or less mystery, a stu- 
dent of strange things, whom all his 
neighbors knew to spend long hours 
in brewing unknown compounds — for 
what devilish purpose no one knew — 
had recently shown anger against the 
hangman’s child. More, he had beat- 
en that child and threatened him, 
and the lad had fallen ill shortly 
afterward. 

This surely w T as the working of 
sorcery and the deed of one who had 
sold himself to the devil. To verify 
his suspicions, the elder Tom, who 
lived not far from the lodging of 
Peter Byfield, made inquiry among 
the neighbors of the alchemist, nor 
w r as he adverse to starting strange 
rumors about the student. 

Then it was that those who knew 
the alchemist began to spread queer 
tales of the man. They recalled that 
this Peter Byfield spent much time 
alone in his attic room, to which he 
seldom if ever invited guests. It was 
rumored that the room contained 
strange things, crucibles, retorts and 
drugs — all the paraphernalia for 
making a witch ’s brew. 

They remembered that the alchem- 
ist had never been over-neighborly, 
although he had been known to do 
such deeds of .charity as to give bread 
to the hungry. lie had even be- 
stowed money on those in need. 



THE BRIMSTONE CAT 



187 



Doubtless a man who was the ser- 
vant of Satan could easily make 
bread by black magic or even produce 
money by his sorcery. It was known 
that he had magically cured a falcon 
with a broken wing which he had 
been seen bringing home one day al- 
most dead and had later taken away 
with him apparently sound. 

Those whom Peter Byfield had 
helped in their need now began to 
pray God that they had not taken 
aid from a servant of the devil, or 
having done so innocently, that this 
would not be accounted a sin to them. 

They began to watch this man of 
mystery. And then it was that they 
discovered damning and erowning 
proof of their suspicions. 

Peter Byfield, it was learned, had 
as companion a cat — a gray cat with 
a yellow spot upon its head — -verily 
the cat that the alchemist had rescued 
from the hands of young Tom 
Smythe. 

This solved the matter completely 
and made the evidence conclusive. 
Why else would a man take pains to 
save a eat from death, were that cat 
not his familiar, his demon compan- 
ion? 

Tom, the elder, sought the judge, a 
friend of his, to whom he told his 
suspicions and the hearsay evidence 
he had gathered. 

Of all these things, meanwhile, was 
Peter Byfield happily ignorant. But 
the young alchemist undertook more 
diligently than ever the studies that 
he sought to master, spurred on by 
the vision in his lonesome young 
heart, the vision of the beautiful 
Lady Edith Estes. 

4 

A nd so it chanced on a day not 
more than two weeks after the 
day on which I rescued the cat, that 
I, Peter Byfield, unaware of the evil 
plotted against me by the hangman, 
had my experiments rudely inter- 



rupted by the entrance into my attic 
room of four armed men of the law. 
Without ceremony, I found myself 
arrested and carried to jail, accused 
of one of the most' serious charges of 
the day — witchcraft. 

The gray cat, reposing before my 
hearth in all the purring content of 
a well-fed animal, was taken as 
proof against me. Tom, the elder, 
who was among the men that arrest- 
ed me, had cunningly provided a 
sack for the cat, and it had been the 
triumph of young Tom, now some- 
what recovered from his sickness, to 
capture the animal and throw it into 
the bag. 

I found myself in a dark dungeon 
and in a most perilous position, for of 
all the crimes at that time recognized 
by law, witchcraft was accounted es- 
pecially heinous, and had as its pun- 
ishment the most terrible forms of 
death. 

Likewise, it was the most difficult 
charge of all, from which a man 
could vindicate himself., A man un- 
der suspicion of being a sorcerer 
might be — and was — tortured in the 
most brutal manner to obtain a con- 
fession. If he did not confess, he 
laid himself liable to conviction for 
that verv reason, as being protected 
by his master, the devil. 

The law dealt hardly with persons 
accused of witchcraft — all of which I 
knew. Even the image of the maid 
with the blue eyes, the golden curls 
and kiss-inviting dimple, faded from 
my thoughts, though still held deep 
in my heart, as the realization of my 
plight came upon me. 

My fears were well-founded. 
When I refused to acknowledge guilt 
of the crime of which I was accused, 
the ignorant, cruel judge, urged on 
by the brutal hangman, ordered me 
to be tortured until I should confess 
such guilt. 

First they pricked me with needles 
to find if I had on me anywhere the 
invulnerable spot. This was the spot, 



188 



WEIRD TALES 



supposed to be without feeling, where 
[ had been sealed by my master, the 
devil. 

When this torture failed, my flesh 
ever quivering at the needle’s thrust, 
they put me on the rack. However, 
I, Peter Byfield, used the strength of 
my will and refused to confess myself 
guilty of that of which I was inno- 
cent. I denied that the sickness of 
young Tom had been the result of any 
evil work on my part. 

I admitted that I was a student of 
alchemy, seeking the philosopher’s 
stone. But I maintained that I 
sought this stone, not for myself 
alone, but for the good I might do 
with it to mankind. As proof of my 
honest intention, I pointed out the 
charitable deeds I had done to those 
in need. My rescue of the gray cat, 
I explained, had been because of my 
love for dumb creatures. 

But a judge and accusers who 
could authorize and witness such tor- 
ture of a human being as the torture 
to which I was put could not under- 
stand one whose plea was that he had 
saved an animal from suffering. 

They gave me respite from the 
rack and sought other means of mak- 
ing me confess. And then it was 
that the genius of Tom, the hangman, 
invented a torture more diabolical 
than Satan himself, it would seem, 
could have devised. 

Tom’s attention had been called to 
the sack, which held the gray cat, 
by continued and frenzied caterwaul- 
ings on the part of that animal, which 
the jailer’s brutal kicks did not still. 
Putting his hand within the sack, he 
sought to bring forth my companion 
in guilt and misery. 

The cat had sharp claws, and Tom 
had been well scratched before he 
finally gave up the attempt and re- 
tied the creature in the bag. Then 
there had flashed into his mind the 
fiendish scheme for an excruciating 
torture on me, the cat’s master: 
Peter Byfield and the gray cat 



should be tied into a sack as fellows. 
So might this sorcerer’s own familiar 
spirit of evil be used to bring about 
the man’s ruin. Tom told his plan 
to the judge, who immediately saw 
its possibilities and ordered its exe- 
cution. 

Thus I found myself stripped and 
tied from the neck down in a huge 
sack, and with me as companion the 
gray cat, crazed and frantic, now 
ready to claw its erstwhile master as 
though indeed it were a demon. 

This sack was then tied by ropes to 
posts so that it hung hammock-fash- 
ion; while Tom, the hangman, swung 
it, turning me first face down and 
then on my back, as he prodded the 
cat with a rod to keep it ever moving- 
in its clawing frenzy. 

Horror of horrors, beyond the pow- 
er of words to tell! The agony of 
that torture! The screaming pain, 
as the sharp claws tore my body, al- 
ready so brutally tortured and 
racked. 

The human body can stand much, 
but the human nerves have a limit of 
endurance. And I, as Peter Byfield, 
had a sensitiveness of nerves ahead 
of my day. Otherwise, I would not 
have had the sympathy that had 
made me stoop to free a tormented 
cat in the streets. 

The tearing of that cat’s claws on 
my bare body was now the most 
frightful torture that human (say 
rather satanical) ingenuity could 
have devised. By will, almost more 
than human, I fought with myself 
that I should not confess to a crime 
I had not committed. 

Then did I beg of my torturers 
that they put me to death, for death 
— even death by the fire and stake — 
appeared to me as a haven of rest 
and peace. 

And at last, finding that I would 
not confess, they freed me from the 
sack. The judge was loth to condemn 
without a confession, but since it ap- 
peared that this could not be ob- 



THE BRIMSTONE CAT 



189 



tained, lie deliberated weightily and 
finally gave it as his opinion that 
there was sufficient criminal evidence 
for conviction. 

The very fact that I had not con- 
fessed, the judge averred, was due to 
the hardening of my heart and will 
through strength given me in my 
hour of trial by my unholy master. 

So upon me he pronounced sen- 
tence that I should on the following 
day, at high noon, lie burned at the 
stake as a warning to other witches, 
wizards and sorcerers. 

With me, condemned to share my 
fate, was the gray eat. The judge 
had noted the yellow r spot on the 
creature’s head, and with the logie of 
the day had made it another link in 
the chain of evidence that led to my 
undoing. 

This yellow spot was, doubtless, a 
smoke-spot of brimstone, said the 
judge, which had left its mark upon 
the cat when the creature came from 
the bottomless pit. Fitting, indeed, 
that the flames should return it 
thither. 

I heard my death sentence as a 
boon, granted in mercy by heaven. 
Then I was taken back to my rude 
dungeon to suffer a night of pain 
from my broken and bleeding body, 
and from my heart which said that 
never again should I stand in the 
bright glory of a May morning and 
see her, as I had first seen her — the 
fair, dear lady of my heart. 

I t was a gray tomorrow' that fol- 
lowed that gray day of torture. 
As noon approached, I was led to the 
place of execution, a public square, 
Avhile a ribald crowd followed and 
hooted me, adjuring me to call upon 
my master, the devil, to save me from 
death. 

Tom, the hangman, w 7 as to have his 
final triumph, for he it was who 
chained me to the iron stake. At my 
feet he tethered by another chain the 
brimstone-spotted cat, now somewhat 



subdued by torment. High about us 
he piled fagots, and then, everything 
being ready, approached with his 
lighted torch, while on his surly face 
was the smile of a fiend. 

Grimly I shut my eyes and prayed 
to the God of love, in whom I had be- 
lieved until that yesterday of torture, 
that he might give me strength to 
die as befitted the son of a noble 
father. 

Surely the hangman had lighted 
the fagots by now — or was he holding 
baek to prolong my agony? I waited 
to feel the breath of the flame. Al- 
most I thought my body would not 
shrink from its warm embrace, but 
would welcome its fiery kiss of death, 
as setting free a soul prisoned in a 
body that had been a dungeon of 
terrors. 

And then — perchance it were a 
delusion born of my weakness and 
pain — I heard a voice speak, staying 
my executioner. It was a voice with 
a clear, sweet tone, such a voiee as 
an angel might have, but in it was 
command that would not be denied. 

‘ ‘ Stay ! ” it commanded. ‘ ‘ What is 
this you do and w T hy is this poor man 
so condemned ? ’ ’ 

The gruff voiee of the hangman 
answered. 

‘‘He is a wizard, your ladyship. 
He cast a spell upon my child, who 
would have perished of a strange 
sickness, had we not found this man 
and put him here, where shortly the 
flames will take him back to his mas- 
ter, Satan, and his vile cat with him.” 

“Is there a cat?” asked the voiee. 
“Let me see this animal.” 

“ ’Tis beneath the fagots, your 
ladyship. ’ ’ 

“I would see it, I say.” 

There was a rustle as Tom moved 
the fagots, and perceiving that this 
must be more than delusion, I opened 
my eyes, to see what person had 
dared interfere with the course of the 
law', and whom it was the hangman 
obeyed. 



190

I gazed into the face of an angel, 
indeed. 

Little she was, with red-gold curls 
and a dimple in one cheek that a man 
might not look upon without a mad 
desire to kiss it. And her eyes — in 
the blue of them, like the blue of the 
sea on a calm summer afternoon, 
there was rest and harbor for a man’s 
soul. But more than that, there was 
such a flame of pity and indignation 
that I knew — what I had almost 
doubted — that a God of love still 
reigned in a dark age and that there 
was one human being in the world, 
besides myself, who would under- 
stand the kindness I had done a cat. 

To the lady of the curls and eyes of 
blue, Tom, the l^angman, held out the 
cat, the while telling the story of 
Peter Byfield, wizard, and his famil- 
iar who possessed this animal. 
The lady listened, looking at the 
condemned man, but the horror 
that showed in her face at the 
recital was at the hangman’s story of 
Peter Byfield’s sufferings rather than 
horror of the sorcerer himself. 

Then a strange thing happened. 
The girl stretched forth her hand as 
though she would pet the cat, and 
when the jailer would have remon- 
strated, commanded him haughtily 
and took the half-dead animal in her 
hands. 

As if by magic, the tormented 
beast ceased its struggles, and raising 
its head sought with evident fondness 
for the stroking caress of her fingers. 
Another voice — a deep, mellow voice, 
albeit that of a woman — spoke. 

“Be careful, my Lady Edith,” it 
chided, “or this hangman will accuse 
you, also, of witchcraft, when you so 
easily charm Satan’s servants.” 

“Do you look, Your Majesty,” re- 
plied the girl. “It is the cat that we 
rescued in the Royal Park a half- 
year . ago. See ! here is the brown 
spot upon its head. Remember you 
not how the dogs had the animal at 
bay and how it turned and faced 



them so pluckily? You and the Earl 
of Leicester and I came upon them, 
and the earl made quip of the fact 
that this cat wore upon its head, hair 
of the color of Your Majesty’s hair, 
that denotes in its possessor uncon- 
querable spirit, as Spanish galleons 
so lately sunk off our coasts bear 
witness for England’s unconquerable 
queen.” 

“I do remember the happening,” 
replied the second voice. “You took 
the cat and made of it your pet, but 
it has been lost some days now, as 
you say. ’ ’ 

With effort, I turned my eyes for 
a minute from the fair face that held 
them so adoringly enthralled. Then 
I saw that the other speaker was a 
woman of most royal presence.. No 
need to note the color of the hair 
which England’s virgin queen had 
made the fashion of court ladies; no 
need to hear the tiny lady-in-waiting 
address her as “Your Majesty.” I 
knew that I stood before Elizabeth, 
Queen of England, and that by 
miracle a chance had opened that 
might give me my life. 

“Mercy! in the name of God, 
mercy, Your Majesty!” I cried. “If 
this be your cat, then do not let them 
kill me for having saved its life. 
They accuse me as a dealer in witch- 
craft, but as God is my witness, I 
have done no wrong. I but saved this 
cat from the hands of the son of this 
vile hangman. The boy would have 
killed it most cruelly, had I not taken 
the beast from him. Of the lad’s 
illness, I know nothing and api guilt- 
less.” 

“Is the boy yet ill?” asked the 
queen, turning to the hangman. 

“He was most ill, Your Majesty,” 
said the man somewhat sullenly, 
“though now he seems recovered. 
But who can say how long he may 
stay thus sound, if he be under the 
spell of a wizard?” 

“This man is not a wizard. Nor 
would he hurt any lad, Your Majesty. 



THE BRIMSTONE CAT 



191 



On that I would pledge my soul,” 
said the Lady Edith, now stepping 
forward. ‘‘The guilty confess their 
crimes and he has not so done. ’ ’ 

‘‘Nay, he would not,” said the 
hangman. ‘ ‘ The devil gave him 
strength to stand even the torture of 
being in the sack with the cat. ’ ’ 

Then he told them with evil glee 
of the fiendish torment he had de- 
vised. 

The small lady-in-waiting, who 
had, since first my gaze met hers, 
comforted me with her blue eyes of 
pity, shuddered at the recital even 
more than she had before. She 
turned so white I thought she would 
swoon. 

‘‘Ah! Your Majesty!” she again 
pleaded, as the jailer finished his re- 
cital; ‘‘this man could not hurt a 
lad. He it is who healed your pet 
falcon of its broken wing. Do you 
not recall how I told you of him?” 

‘ ‘ Give us your story, my man ! ’ ’ 
commanded the queen. ‘ ‘ I remember 
the falcon, and chided the Lady 
Edith that she did not bring you to 
my presence for a fitting reward of 
your skill.” 

So commanded, I told her all my 
story — how I had studied alchemy 
and physic that would teach me to 
heal a sick bird, how I had rescued 
the cat, how the animal had come to 
me for shelter and how Tom, the 
hangman’s son, having fallen ill of 
colic during green apple season, his 
father had wrongly accused me of 
witchcraft and evil practise against 
the lad. 

Then I told her of the tortures I 
had endured, but that I had not con- 
fessed even when they put me in the 
sack with the cat. 

The Lady Edith Estes shuddered 
again and again during the narrative 
of my tortures, but the queen listened 
quietly. However, there was indig- 
nation in her voice as she asked at 
the end of my story: 

“What judge condemned you? 



And how came he to practise on you 
a torture not in accordance with our 
laws? It shall go hai’dly with this 
judge, and with you, too, man,” she 
added, addressing the hangman. “For 
this piece of work, you are no longer 
hangman and jailer, but must earn 
your living by other means than such 
zealous practises of cruelties on gen- 
tlemen. You are indeed a gentle- 
man’s son?” she queried me. 

I replied that I was and told her 
my father’s history, making much of 
the fact that coming back to England 
in the beginning of her reign, he had 
ever been a loyal . adherent of the 
crown.. 

As I talked, the Lady Edith Estes 
continued to pet the gray cat, now 
quite calmed. Then she turned be- 
seeching eyes upon the queen, be- 
seeching eyes that won from her sov- 
ereign a smile. So sweet was my lit- 
tle lady that she might even woo 
favors from members of her own sex. 
Now it seemed that the queen had 
listened to her pleading and made 
judgment thereby. 

“Serious and grievous wrong has 
been done to Peter Byfield,” said 
the queen. “I am convinced that he 
is an innocent man and therefore I 
pardon him fully and freely. Unloose 
the man,” she commanded the hang- 
man. 

Faint and weak, I had almost fall- 
en when Tom, sullen albeit abashed, 
released me. A soldier from the 
queen’s retinue supported me, while 
Her Majesty commanded that I be 
taken to the palace for treatment by 
her court physician. 

“We shall make you physician to 
our animals,” she announced. “And 
perchance if we find your story true 
and yourself worthy, we shall restore 
you to your father’s rank and title. 
What think you of that, my Lady 
Edith? Will that be reward sufficient 
for this wonderful doctor of yours, of 
whom you have talked so much since 



192 



WEIRD TALES 



the day he mended our falcon’s 
iving?” 

Bracing myself against, my faint- 
ness, I turned to make thanks to the 
Lady Edith, who had saved my life. 
And I saw in the blush on her cheek, 
which had followed the queen’s 
words, a hope that perchance there 
should be even greater reward for me 
than the queen had mentioned. 

I reached forward to raise the 
small lady’s hand to my lips. It lay 
upon the cat that she had been pet- 
ting. I touched the animal as I did 
so, and at that touch there rose in me 
such an abhorrence, such a dread 
and loathing and hatred for this 
creature through which I had suf- 
fered so much, that I staggered back 
in my weakness. I remember falling, 
falling, and then 

5 

‘ ‘ Oure, and don ’t start so, Mr. 

^ Ariste ! I ’m but come in to clear 
away the tea things.” 

So spoke the voice of my landlady, 
Mrs. O ’Flynn, waking me from a 
strange dream that I, Govern Ariste, 
had had — a dream wherein I played a 
role under the name and being of 
Peter Byfield ; a dream of such vivid- 
ness that it did not depart as most 
dreams do, but remained with me, 
clear, distinct in every detail. 

“Is that your cat that is howling 
so, Mrs. O ’Flynn ? ” I asked. 

“It is, and it may kape on its howl- 
ing, for all of me,” replied my land- 
lady. “It tried to eat up me lovely 
new singer canary, and I’m locking 
the ungrateful baste up for a lesson 
to it not to jump on the cages of tin- 
dollar birds. I know you don’t like 
the animal, Mr. Ariste, nor any eats. 
But it’s really a good crayture and 
kills many a mouse.” 

“Mice are well enough, but when 
it brings about the death of a man 
” I reflected, but aloud I mere- 



ly announced my intention of stroll- 
ing forth for a walk. 

I felt that I needed the calming ef- 
fect of the cold night air. Many sto- 
ries I have written. Writing is my 
trade. But never before had I lived 
my plot as I had tonight. 

Was it merely a fantastic idea for 
a story that had come to me, I won- 
dered. Or had I, Govern Ariste, once 
lived in the body of Peter Byficld? 
Had Peter Byfield been a real per- 
son? It had' been a real enough ex- 
perience, those several days in the 
life of the young alchemist that I had 
lived through, during the half-hour 
between the going of Amir Das and 
the coming of Mrs. O’Flynn; while 
Govern Ariste slept in his chair be- 
fore the open fire and Mrs. O ’Flynn ’s 
gray cat yowled its penance for the 
attempted massacre of a “ tin-dollar ’ ’ 
canary. 

What a tale it would make! But 
I must turn it over in my mind and 
clear my thoughts. I walked down 
the hall and stepped outside, closing 
the door on a last despairing w T ail 
from the imprisoned cat. 

The thought eame to me that I 
might be losing my mind. People 
sometimes did. . Perhaps I was hav- 
ing hallucinations, or it might be that 
my friend Amir Das had hypnotized 
me and sent me this dream to make 
me believe his strange theories of re- 
incarnation. 

Such was my thought as I walked, 
I knew not where. Suddenly my rev- 
ery was broken by a woman’s shrill 
scream. I paused and looked up a 
side street whence the cry seemed to 
come. 

There was the sound of running 
steps and a girl flung herself upon 
me, almost into my arms. 

“Help me! help me!” she cried. 

Behind her came two men of rough 
appearance. I am not tall, and I 
suppose I did not look formidable. 
The men did not stop but continued

The Story So Far 

M ilton Rhodes and his friend Bill Carter go to 
Mount Rainier to find out what caused the 
dreadful murders that are supposed to have been 
committed by a frightful “Demon" in custody of 
an “Angel" (so they are described by those who 
saw them). Rhodes suddenly disappears when he 
and Carter are among the Tamahnowis Rocks, 
and Carter is startled by a fearful scream that 
seems to issue from the very heart of the rock. 

CHAPTER 15 
THE ANGEL 

T HE scream ceased as suddenly 
as it had come. I drew my re- 
volver, snapped on the elec- 
tric light and, stooping low, looked 
into that spot where, a few moments 

w. T.— 2 



before, Milton Rhodes had so sudden- 
ly and mysteriously disappeared. 

Nothing but the unbroken rock be- 
fore me. And yet Rhodes had van- 
ished. I turned the light full upon 
the low roof, and then I exclaimed 
aloud : the entrance was there ! 

I dropped to my hands and knees 
and moved under, the pack not a lit- 
tle impeding my movements. An 
instant, and I was standing upright, 
peering into a high, narrow tunnel, 
which some convulsion of nature, in 
some lost age of the earth, had rent 
right through the living rock. 



193

WEIRD TALES 



Nothing was to be seen, save the 
broken walls, floor and roof, deep, 
eery shadows crawling and gliding as 
the light moved. The view, however, 
was a very- restricted one, for the gal- 
lery, which sloped gently upward, 
gave a sudden turn at a distance of 
only thirty feet or so. What await- 
ed me somewhere beyond that turn? 

For a few moments I listened in- 
tently. Not the faintest sound — 
nothing but the loud beating of my 
heart. What had happened to 
Rhodes? 

“Milton!” I called softly. “Oh, 
Milton!” 

No answer came. 

I grasped a projection of rock, 
drew myself up into the tunnel and 
advanced as rapidly and silently as 
possible, the light and the alpenstock 
in my left hand, the revolver in the 
right. But it was not very silently, 
what with the creepers. At times 
they grated harshly; it was as if 
spirit things were mocking me with 
suppressed, demoniacal laughter. Yet 
I could not pause to remove those 
grating shoes of toothed steel. Every 
second might be precious now. 

I drew near the turn, the revolver 
thrust forward in readiness for in- 
stant action. I reached it, and, there 
just beyond, a dark figure was stand- 
ing, framed in a blaze of light. 

It was Milton Rhodes. 

He turned his head, and I saw a 
smile move athwart his features. 

“Well, we’ve found it, Bill.!” said 
be. 

I was now drawing near to him. 

‘ ‘ That scream ! ” I said. ‘ ‘ Who 

gave that terrible scream?” 

“Terrible? It didn’t sound ter- 
rible to me,” said Milton Rhodes. 
“Fact is, Bill, I’d like to hear it 
again. ’ ’ 

“What on earth are you talking 
about?” 

“ ’Tis so.” 

“Who was it? Or what was it?” 

“Why, the angel!” he told me. 



“Where is she now?” 

“Gone, Bill; she’s gone. When 
she saw me, she fetched up, gave that 
scream, then turned and vanished — 
around that next turn.” 

“What was she like, Milton?” 

‘ ‘ I wish I could tell you ! But how 
can a man describe Venus? I know 
one thing, Bill: if all the daughters 
of Drome are as fair as this one that 
I saw, I know where all the movie 
queens of the future are coming 
from. ' ’ 

I looked at him, and I laughed. 
“Wait till you see her, Bill. Com- 
plexion like alabaster, white as Rain- 
ier ’s purest snow! And hair! Oh, 
that hair, Bill ! Like ten billion 
dollars’ worth of spun gold!” 

“And the demon?” I queried. 

“I didn’t see any demon, Bill.” 
There was silence for a little space. 
“Then,” I said, “the whole thing 
is true, after all.” 

“You mean what Grandfather 
Scranton set down in his journal — 
and the rest of it?” 

I nodded. 

“I never doubted that.” 

“At times,” I told him, “I didn’t 
doubt it. Then, again, it all seemed 
so wild and weird that I didn’t know 
what on earth to think.” 

‘ ‘ I think, ” he said with a wan 
smile, “that you know what to think 
now — now when you are standing in 
this very way to Drome, whatever 
Drome may be.” 

“Yes. And yet the thing is so 
strange. Think of it! A world of 
which men have never dreamed, save 
in the wildest romance! An under- 
ground world! Subterranean ways, 
subterranean cities, men and women 
there ’ ’ 

“ Cavernicolous Aphrodites!” said 
Milton Rhodes. 

“And all down there in eternal 
darkness!” I exclaimed. “Why, the 
thing is incredible. No wonder that 
I sometimes find myself wondering if 
I am not in a dream ! ” 



DROME 



195 



Said Milton Rhodes : 

“All that we see or seem 
Is but a dream within a dream. 

“But come, Bill,” he added, 
“don’t let this a priori stuff bowl 
you over. In the first place, it isn’t 
' n ark down there — when you get down 
far enough.” 

“In heaven’s name, how do you 
know that ? ’ ’ 

“Why, for one thing, if this sub- 
terranean world was one of unbroken 
darkness, the angel (and the demon) 
would be blind, like those fishes in 
the Mammoth Cave. But she is no 
more blind than you or I. Ergo, if 
for no other reason, we shall find light 
down there.” 

“Of course, they have artificial 
light, or ” 

“I don’t mean that. If there had 
not been some other illumination, 
this strange race (of whose very ex- 
istence science has never even 
dreamed) would have ceased to exist 
long ago — if, indeed, it ever could 
have begun.” 

“But no gleam of sunlight can ev- 
er find its way to that world. ’ ’ 

“It never can, of course. But 
there are other sources of light — 
nebulas and comets in the heavens, 
for example, and auroras, phosphorus 
and fireflies here on earth. The phe- 
nomena of phosphorescence are by no 
means so rare as might be imagined. 
Why, as Nichcl showed — though any 
man who uses his eyes can see it him- 
self — there is light inherent even in 
clouds.” 

A hh this, and more, Rhodes ex- 
plained to me, succinctly but 
clearly. 

“Oh, we’ll find light, Bill,” said 
he. 

All the same this subterranean 
world for which we were bound pre- 
sented some unpleasant possibilities, 
in addition, that is, to those concom- 
itant to its being a habitat of demons 



— and heaven only knew what be- 
sides. 

“And, then, there is the air,” I 
said. “As we descend, it will be- 
come denser and denser, until at last 
wc shall be able to use these ice-picks 
on it.” 

Rhodes, who was removing his 
creepers, laughed. 

“We will have to make a vertical 
descent of three and one-half miles 
below the level of the sea — a vertical 
descent of near five miles from this 
spot where we stand, Bill — before we 
reach a pressure of even two atmos- 
pheres. ’ ’ 

“The density then increases rapid- 
ly, doesn ’t it ? ” 

“Oh, yes. Three and a half miles 
more, and we are under a pressure of 
fbur atmospheres, or about sixty 
pounds to the square inch. Throe and 
a half miles farther down, or ten and 
one-half miles in all below the level 
of the sea, and we have a pressure 
upon us of eight atmospheres. Four- 
teen miles, and it will be sixteen at- 
mospheres. At thirty-four miles the 
air will have the density of water; at 
forty-eight miles it will be as dense 
as mercury, and at fifty miles we 
shall have it as dense as gold.” 

“That will do ! ” I told him. * ‘ We 
can never get down that far.” 

“ I have no idea how far we can go 
down, Bill.” 

“You know that we could never 
stand such pressures as those.” 

“I know that. But, as a matter of 
fact, I don’t know what the pressures 
are at those depths. Nor does any 
other man know. What I said a mo- 
ment ago is, of course, according to 
the law ; but there is something wrong 
with the law, founded upon that of 
Mariotte — as any physicist will tell 
you.” 

“What’s wrong with it?” 

“At any rate, the law breaks down 
as one goes upward, and I have no 
doubt that it will be found to do so 
as one descends below the level of the 



196 WEIRD TALES 



sea. If the densities of the atmos- 
phere decrease in a geometrical as 
the distances -from sea-level increase 
in an arithmetical ratio, then, at a 
distance of only one hundred miles 
up, we should have virtually a per- 
fectvacuum. The rarity there would 
be absolutely inconceivable. For the 
atmospheric density at that height 
would be only one billionth of. what 
it is at the earth ’s surface. 

“And what is the real density 
there?’* 

“No man knows or can know,” re- 
plied Rhodes, “until he goes up there 
to see. .But meteors, rendered incan- 
descent by the resistance they, en- 
counter, show that a state of things 
exists at that high altitude very dif- 
ferent from the one that would be 
found there if our formulae were cor- 
rect and our theories were valid. 
And so,, I have no doubt, we shall find 
it down in Drome. 

“Formulae are very well .in their 
place,” he went on, “but we should 
never forget, Bill, that they are often 
budded on mere assumption and that 
a theory is only a theory until experi- 
ment (or experience) has shown us 
that it is a fact. And that reminds 
me : do ' you know what Percival 
Lowell says about formulae?” 

I said I didn’t. 

“ ‘Formulae,’ says. the great as- 
tronomer, ‘are the anesthetics of 
thought.’ I commend that very 
highly,” Milton added, “to our fic- 
tion editors and our writers of short 
stories. ” 

“But ” 

“But me no buts, Bill,” said Mil- 
ton. “And w r hat do your scientists 
know about the interior of this old 
earth we inhabit, anyway ? Forsooth, 
but very little, Billy me lad. Why, 
they don’t even know what a volcano 
is. One can’t make a journey into 
the interior of the earth on a scratch- 
pad and' a lead-pencil, or if he does, 
we may be pardoned if we do not 
give implicit credence to all that he 



chooses to tell, us when he comes back. 
For instance, one of these armchair 
Columbuses (he made the journey in 
a machine called d 2 y by dx 2 and came 
out in China) says that he found the 
interior in a state of igneous fluidity. 
And another ? Why, he tells us that 
the w r hole earth is- as rigid as steel, 
that it is solid to the very core. ’ ’ 

‘ ‘ It seems, ’ ’ said I> ,‘ ‘ to be a case of 

“ ‘Great contest follows, and much 
learned dust 

Involves" the combatants; each claim- 
ing truth, . 

And truth disclaiming both.’ ” 

“The truth in this case is not yet 
known,” replied Rhodes, “though I 
trust that you and I r Bill,, are -fated 
to learn it.” 

He smiled a queer, wan smile. 

“Whether we are fated, also, to re- 
veal it to the" world,. our world — well, 
quien sabe?” said Milton Rhodes. 

“Then,” I remarked, my fingers 
busy removing my ice-creepers, 
“what we read about the state of 
things in the interior of the earth — 
the temperature, the pressure, the 
density — then all that is pure 

theory ? ’ ’ 

“Of course. How could it be any- 
thing else? All theory, save, that is, 
the mean density of the, earth. And 
that mean density gives us something 
to think about, for it is just a little 
more than twice that, of the surface 
materials. With all this enormous 
pressure that we hear so much about 
and the resultant increase of density 
with depth, the weight of the earth 
certainly ought to be more than only 
five and one-half time's that of a 
globe of equal" size composed of noth- 
ing but water.” 

‘ ‘ Kind of queer, all right, ’ ’ was my 
comment. 

“It is queer, all right — as the old 
lady said when she kissed the cow. 
However, as old Dante has it, ‘Son! 
our time asks thriftier using. ’ ’ ’ 

As the last, word left his lips, I 
straightened up, the toothed shoes in

my hand; ; and, as I did so, I started 
and cried : ‘ ‘ Hear that ? ’ * 

Rhodes made no answer. For some 
moments we stood there in breathless 
expectation ; but that low mysterious 
sound did not come again. 

“What was that?” I said. 

“I wish I knew. It was faint and 
— well, rather strange.” 

“It seemed to me,” I told him, “to 
be hollow — like the sound of some 
great door suddenly closing. ’ ’ 

My companion looked at me rather 
quickly. 

“Think so, Bill?” he said. “I 
thought ’twas the sound of something 
falling.” 

There was a pause, during which 
pause we stood listening and waiting ; 
but the gallery remained as silent as 
though it had never known the tread 
of any living thing. 

“Well, Bill,” said Milton Rhodes 
suddenly, “we shall never learn what 
Drome means if we stay in this spot. 
As for the creepers, I am going to 
leave mine here.” 

Milton then wrote a short note, 
which recorded little more than our 
names, the date of our great discov- 
ery and that we were going farther. 
This, carefully folded, he placed be- 
side the creepers and put a rock- 
fragment upon it. I wondered as I 
watched him whose would be the eyes 
that would discover it. Some inhab- 
itant of this underground world, of 
course, and to such a one the record 
would be so much Greek. Twas ut- 
terly unlikely that anyone from that 
world which we were leaving would 
ever see that record. I wondered if 
we should ever see this spot again. 

“And now, Bill,” said Milton, 
“down we go!” 

And the next moment we were go- 
ing — had begun our descent into this 
most mysterious and dreadful place. 



CHAPTER 16 

“ARE WE ENTERING DANTE’S 
INFERNO ITSELF?” 

II’hen Scranton came with his 

’ * weird story of Old He, I was, I 
confess, not a little puzzled by his 
and Milton’s reference to the extra- 
ordinary scientific possibilities that it 
presented. At first I could not 
imagine what on earth they meant. 
But I saw all those possibilities very 
clearly now, and a thousand more I 
imagined. I knew a wild joy, exulta- 
tion, and yet at the same time the 
wonder and the mystery of it all 
made me humble and sober of spirit. 
I admit, too, that a fear — a fear for 
which I can find no adequate name — 
had laid its palsied and cold fingers 
upon me. 

In a few moments we reached that 
spot where the angel had vanished. 
There we paused in curiosity, looking 
about; but nothing was to be seen. 
The gallery — which from this point 
swung sharply to the right and went 
down at a rather steep angle — was as 
silent as some interstellar void. 

“Bill,” smiled Milton Rhodes, “he 
is idle who might be better em- 
ployed. ’ ’ 

And he started on, or, rather, 
down. A hundred feet, however (we 
were now under the glacier) and he 
halted, turned his light full upon the 
left-hand wall, pointed and said: 
“There you are. Bill — the writing on 
the wall.” 

I pressed to his side and stood 
staring. The rock there was as 
smooth, almost, as a blackboard; and 
upon it, traced in white chalk, were 
three inscriptions, with what we took 
to be names appended to them. That 
on the right was clearly a very 
recent one — had been placed there, 
doubtless, at the most but a few days 
.since, by that “ cavemieolous Venus” 
that Milton Rhodes had seen for so 
fleeting a moment.

It was Milton’s opinion that the 
characters were alphabetical ones, 
though at first I was at a loss to un- 
derstand how they could be anything 
to him but an utter mystery. The 
letters were formed by straight lines 
only. The simplest character was 
like a plain capital T, with the ver- 
tical line somewhat elongated. And 
it was made to perform the office of 
another letter by the simple expedi- 
ent of standing it- upon its head. The 
number of cross-lines increased up to 
six — three at the top and three at the 
bottom ; and in one or two characters 
there were two vertical lines, placed 
close together. 

* 1 Evidently, ’ ’ observed Milton 
Rhodes, “this alphabet was con- 
structed on strictly scientific prin- 
ciples. ’ ’ 

For a space we stood there looking, 
wondering what was recorded in that 
writing so strange and yet, after all, 
so very and beautifully simple. Then 
Milton proceeded to place another 
record there, and, as he wrote, he 
hummed : 

“ ‘When I see a person’s name 
Scratched upon a glass, 

I know he owns a diamond 
And his father owns an ass.’ ’ 

The inscription finished, we re- 
sumed our descent. The way soon 
became steep and very difficult. 

“That Aphrodite of yours,” I ob- 
served as we made our way down a 
particularly rugged place, “must 
have the agility of a mountain-goat. ’ ’ 
“Your rhetoric, Bill, is horrible. 
Wait till you see her; you’ll never be 
guilty of thinking of a goat when 
she has your thoughts.” 

“By the way, what kind of a light 
did the lady have?” 

“Light? Don’t know. I was so 
interested in the angel herself that I 
never once thought of the light she 
carried. I don ’t know that she needs 
a light, anyway.” 

“What on earth are you talking 
about ? ’ ’ 



‘ ‘ Why, I fancy, Bill, that her very 
presence would make even Pluto’s 
gloomy realm bright and beautiful 
as the Gardens of the Hesperides. ’ ’ 

“Oh, gosh!” was my comment. 

“Wait till you see her, Bill.” 

“I’ll probably see her demon 
first. ’ ’ 

“Hello!” exclaimed Milton. 

“What now?” 

“Look at that,” said he, pointing. 
“I think we have the explanation of 
that mysterious sound, which you 
thought was like that of a great door 
suddenly closing: in her descent, she 
dislodged a rock-fragment, and that 
sound we heard must have been pro- 
duced by the mass as it went plung- 
ing down.” 

“ ’Tis very likely, but ” 

“Great heaven-!” he exclaimed. 

* ‘ What is it now ? ’ ’ 

“I wonder, Bill, if she lost her 
footing here and went plunging 
down, too.” 

I had not thought of that. And 
the possibility that that lovely and 
mysterious being lay somewhere down 
there, crushed and bleeding, perhaps 
lifeless, made me feel very sad. We 
sent the rays of our powerful lights 
down into the silent depths of the 
tunnel, but nothing was visible there, 
save the dark rock and those fearful 
shadows — fearful, what with the 
secrets that might be hidden there. 

“The answer won’t come to us, 
Bill, ’ ’ said Milton. 

“No,” I returned as we started 
down; “we must go get it.” 

The gallery at this place had an 
average width of, I suppose, ten feet, 
and the height would average per- 
haps fifteen. The reader must not 
picture the walls, the roof and the 
floor as smooth, however. The rock 
was much broken, in some spots very 
jagged. The gallery pitched at an 
angle of nearly forty-five degrees, 
which will give some idea of the 
difficulties encountered in the de- 
scent.

At length we reached what may be 
called the bottom; here the tunnel 
gave another turn and the pitch be- 
came a gentle slope. And there we 
found it, the rock-fragment, weigh- 
ing perhaps two hundred pounds, 
that the angel had dislodged in her 
descent — which doubtless had been a 
hurried, a wild one. 

“Thank heaven,” I exclaimed, 
“she didn’t come down with it!” 

“Amen,” said Milton. 

Then a sudden thought struck me, 
a thought so unworthy that I did not 
voice it aloud. But to myself I said : 
“It is passible that we may find our- 
selves, before we get out of this, 
wishing that she had.” 

If a human being, one of the very 
best of human beings even, were to 
voice his uttermost, his inmost 
thoughts, what a shameful, terrible 
monster they would call him — or her ! 

And the demon. Where was her 
demon? 

I could give no adequate descrip- 
tion of those hours that succeeded. 
Steadily we continued the descent — 
now gentle, now steep, rugged and 
difficiilt. Sometimes the way became 
very narrow — indeed, at one point we 
had to squeeze our way through, so 
closely clid the walls approach each 
other — then, again, it would open 
out, and we would find ourselves in 
a veritable chamber. And, in one of 
these, a lofty place, the vaulted roof 
a hundred feet or more above our 
heads, we made a strange discovery 
— a skeleton, quasi-human and with 
wings. 

“Are we,” I cried, “entering 
Dante’s Inferno itself?” 

A faint smile touched the face of 
Rhodes. 

“Don’t you,” he asked, “know 
what this is?” 

‘ ‘ It must be the bones of a demon. ’ ’ 

“Precisely. Grandfather Scran- 



ton, you’ll remember, wounded that 
monster, up there by the Tamahnowis 
Rocks. Undoubtedly the bullet 
reached a vital spot, and these are 
the creature ’s bones. ’ ’ 

“But,” I objected, “these are 
human bones — a human skeleton with 
wings. According to Scranton, there 
was nothing at all human about the 
appearance of that thing which he 
called a demon.” 

‘ ‘ I admit, ’ ’ said Rhodes, ‘ ‘ that this 
skeleton, at the first glance, has an 
appearance remarkably human — if, 
that is, one can forget the wings. The 
skull, I believe, more than anything 
else, contributes to that effect; and 
yet, at a second glance, even that 
loses its human semblance. For look 
at those terrible teeth. Whoever saw 
a human being with teeth like thase? 
And look at the large scapula; and 
the small hips and the dwarfish, 
though strong, nether limbs. Bat- 
likc, Bill, strikingly so.. And those 
feet : they are talons, Bill. And 
see that medial ridge on the sternum, 
for the attachment of the great 
pectoral muscles.” 

“A bat-man, then?” I queried. 

“I should say a bat-ape.” 

“Or an ape-bat.” 

“Whichever you prefer,” smiled 
Milton. 

“Well,” I added, “at any rate, we 
have a fair idea now of what a demon 
is like.” 

Little wonder, forsooth, that old 
Sklokoyum had declared the thing 
was a demon from the white man’s 
Inferno. And this creature so dread- 
ful — well, the angel had it for a com- 
panion. When Rhodes saw her, she 
was, of course, without that terrible 
attendant: undoubtedly the next 

time, though — how long would it be? 
— she would not be alone. 

“Oh, well,” I consoled myself, 
“we have our revolvers.”

CHAPTER 17 

LIKE BALEFUL EYES 

A ccording to the aneroid, this great 
chamber is about four thousand 
feet above the level of the sea; in 
other words, we had already made a 
vertical descent of some four thou- 
sand feet. We were now about as 
high above the sea as the snout of the 
Nisqually.. But what was our direc- 
tion from the Tamahnowis Rocks? So 
sinuous had been this strange subter- 
ranean gallery, my orientation had 
been knocked into a cocked hat. It 
was Milton’s belief, however, that 
we had been moving in a northerly 
direction, that we were still under the 
peak itself, probably under the great 
Emmons Glacier. I confess that I 
would not have cared to place a 
wager on the subject. Goodness only 
knew where we were, but of one 
thing there could be no doubt: we 
were there ! 

“Why,” I asked, “didn’t we bring 
a eomnass?” 

“I think,” returned Milton, slip- 
ping loose his pack and lowering it 
to the floor, “that, as it was, we had 
a case of another straw and the earn- 
ers back’s busted. Let’s take a rest 
— it ’3 twenty minutes after 1 — and a 
snack. And another thing : we 

wouldn’t know whether to trust the 
compass or not.” 

“Why so?” 

“Local attraction, Bill. Many in- 
stances of this could be given. One 
will suffice. Lieutenant Underwood, 
of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, 
found a deviation of thirteen and a 
quarter points on the summit of the 
Cobu Rock, in the Feejees — one hun- 
dred and fortv-nine degrees. The 
Island of Nairai was directlv north, 
and yet. according to the compass, it 
bore southeast-by-south one quarter 
south, whilst, placed at the foot of the 
rock, that very same compass said 
Nairai bore north ! So you see that 
that faithful friend to man, and es- 



pecially to the mariner, has in its 
friendships some qualities that are 
remarkably human. 

“Still,” Rhodes added, “I wish 
that we had brought one along. Also, 
we should have brought a manometer, 
for the aneroid will be worthless after 
we have descended below sea-level. 
Oh, well, the boiling point of water 
will give us the atmospheric pres- 
sure : under a pressure of two atmos- 
pheres, water boils at 249.5° Fahren- 
heit; under a pressure of three at- 
mospheres, at 273.3° ; four atmos- 
pheres, 291.2° ; five, 306° ; six, 318.2° ; 
seven, 329.6° ; eight, 339.5° ; and so 
on. On the summit of Rainier, it 
boils at about 185°.” 

“I wish that we were headed for 
the summit,” said I. “Eight atmos- 
pheres! When we reach that pres- 
sure — if we ever do — we’ll be ten and 
a half miles below the level of the 
sea, won’t we?” 

Rhodes nodded. 

“According to the law. But, as I 
remarked, there is something wrong 
with the law. ’Tis my belief that we 
shall be able to descend much deep- 
er than ten and one-half miles — that 
is, that the atmospheric pressure will 
permit us to do so.” 

“That qualification,” I told him, 
“is very apropos, for there is no 
telling what the inhabitants of this 
underground world will permit us to 
do or will do to us — bat-apes or ape- 
bats, humans, or both.” 

“That, of course, is very true, 
Bill.” 

“And,” said I, “we won’t need a 
manometer, or we won’t need to as- 
certain the boiling point of water, to 
know that the pressure is increasing. 
Our ear-drums will make us painful- 
ly aware of that fact.” 

“When that comes, swaller, Billy, 
swaller, and the pain will be no 
more.” 

“Swallow?” 

“Swallow,” Milton nodded. 



DROME 



201 



‘ ‘ Great Barmecide, swallow 

what 1 ’ ’ 

“Swallow the pain, Bill. For look 
you. Deglutition opens the Eustach- 
ian tube. Some of the dense air en- 
ters the drum and counteracts the 
pressure on the outside of the mem- 
brane. You keep on swallowing. The 
air in the drum becomes as dense as 
that outside ; there is no pressure 
on the membrane now — or, rather, 
the pressures are in perfect equilib- 
rium — and, presto and abracadabra, 
the pain is gone. ’ ’ 

‘ ‘ Who would have thought it ? ” 

“A gink,” said Rhodes, “going in- 
to compressed air had better think it. 
He may have his ear-drums burst in 
if he doesn ’t. ” , 

“But why does the Eustachian 
tube open only when we swallow ? ’ ’ 
“To shut from the ear the sounds 
produced in the throat and the 
mouth. If the tube were always 
open, our heads would be so many 
bedlams. ’ ’ 

“Wonderful nature!” I ex- 
claimed. 

“Oh, she does fairly well,” ad- 
mitted Milton Rhodes. 

“And I suppose,” I said, “that 
the pain in the ears experienced by 
those who ascend high mountains is 
to be explained in the same way, only 
vice versa. They, too, ought to swal- 
low.” 

“Of course. At lofty heights, the 
dense air in the drum presses the 
membrane outward. Swallowing per- 
mits the dense air to escape. One 
swallows until the pressure on the 
inside equals that of the rarefied out- 
side air, and, hocus-pocus and presto, 
the pain has evaporated.” 

“I hope,” I said, “that all our 
difficulties will be as easily re- 
solved. ” 

“Hey!” cried Milton. 

“What’s the matter now?” 

“Stop swallowing that water! 
We’ve got food sufficient for a week, 
but we haven’t got water to last a 



week or anything like it. Keep up 
that guzzling, and your canteen will 
be empty before sunset. ’ ’ 

“Sunset? Sweet Pluto! Sunrise, 
sunset or high noon, it’s all the same 
here in Erebus.” 

“You’ll say that it’s very differ- 
ent,” di’yly remai'ked Milton Rhodes, 
“if you find the fingers of thirst at 
your throat.” 

“Surely there is water in this 
place — somewhere.” 

“Most certainly there is. But we 
don’t know how far we are from that 
somewhere. . And, until we get to it, 
our policy, Bill, must be one of 
watchful conservation. ’ ’ 

A silence ensued. I sank into pro- 
found and gloomy meditation. Four 
thousand feet down. A mile deeper, 
and where should we be? The pros- 
pect certainly was, from any point of 
view, dark and mysterious enough 
to satisfy the wildest dreams of 
a Poe or a Dor6. To imagine a 
Dante’s Inferno, however, is one 
thing and to find yourself in it is 
quite another. ’Tis true, we were 
not in it yet ; but we were on our way. 

I hasten to say, though, that I had 
no thoughts of turning back. No 
such thought, even the slightest, was 
entertained for .one single moment. 
I did not blink, that was all. I be- 
lieved our enterprize was a very 
dangerous one ; I believed it was very 
probable that we should never return 
to the light of the sun. Such thoughts 
are not pleasant, are, indeed, hor- 
rible. And yet, in the very horror of 
them, I found a strange fascination. 
Yes, we might leave our bones in this 
underground world, in this very gal- 
lery even. Even so, we should have 
our own exceeding great reward. 
For ours would be the guerdon of dy- 
ing in a stranger, a more wonderful 
quest, than any science or discovery 
ever had known. A strange reward, 
and perhaps you wonder what such 
a reward can mean to a dying or a 
dead man. All I have to say is that, 



202

if you do, you know naught of that 
flaming spirit which moves the scien- 
tist and the discoverer, that such as 
you should never— indeed, can nev- 
er — seek the dread secrets of . nature 
or journey to her hidden places; 

W e rested there for exactly one 
hour. The temperature, by the 
way, was 57° Fahrenheit. When we 
resumed the descent, I was using the 
phosphorus lamp instead of the elec- 
tric one. It was not likely that even 
our electric lights would fail us; still 
there was no guessing what might 
happen, and it might be well, I 
thought, to adopt a policy of light- 
conservation also. As for the phos- 
phorus lamps, these would furnish 
light for six months. In this, they 
were simply wonderful ; but there 
was one serious drawback; the light 
emitted was a feeble one. 

The manufacture of this lamp (at 
one time used, I believe, in Paris, 
and probably elsewhere, in the maga- 
zines containing explosives) is sim- 
plicity itself. Into a glass phial is 
put a small piece of phosphorus. The 
phial is filled two-thirds full of olive 
oil, heated to the boiling point. The 
thing is hermetically corked, and 
there you are. When you wish to use 
your wonderful little pharos, you 
simply allow air to enter. The space 
above the oil becomes luminous then. 
You replace the cork, and. the phial 
remains sealed until there is occasion 
to restore the waning light, which 
you do, of course, by allowing' more 
air to enter. As has been said, such 
a phial will furnish light for a half- 
year. 

These phials of ours were set each 
in a metal frame and protected by a 
guard in such fashion that it would 
take a heavy blow to break the glass. 
When not in use, the}' were kept in 
strong metal cylinders. Of course, 
the electric light could be turned on 
at any instant. 

There were places where the gal- 



lery pitched, in a way to make the 
head swim, many spots in which we 
had to exercise every caution ; a false 
step might have spelled irrevocable 
disaster. I wondered how the angel 
had passed down those difficult plac- 
es, and many pictures of that mys- 
terious creature, as I wondered, came 
and went. Well, she had passed 
down and that without mishap. 
Where was she now? Indeed, where 
were we ourselves? 

Steadily we toiled our downward 
way. For a long distance, the gallery 
ran with but slight deviation either to 
the right or to the left, though the 
descent was much broken — I mean 
now was steep and now gentle, now 
at some angle intermediate. Rhodes 
thought that we were now moving in 
an easterly direction; it might have 
been north, east, south or west for all 
I knew. Not a trickle of water had 
we seen, not even a single drop, which 
I confess caused some unpleasant 
thoughts to flicker through my mind. 

At 5 o ’clock we were two thousand 
feet above sea-level; at half past 7, 
about half a thousand. And we then 
decided to call it a day. Nor was I 
at all sorry to do so, even though 
we might be near some strange, even 
great discovery, for I was very tired, 
and sore from the. top of my head to 
the end of my toes. I was in fair 
trim, and so was Rhodes ; but it 
would take us some time to get used 
to such work as this. 

A very gentle current of air, so 
slight that it required experiment to 
detect it, was passing down the gal- 
lery. The temperature here was 62° 
Fahrenheit. 

We had stepped before a cavity in 
the wall, and in that little chamber 
we passed the night, one holding 
watch whilst the other slept. 

My dreams were dreadful, but 
otherwise the night was as peaceful 
as any that ' .ever passed over Eden. 
Neither Rhodes nor I, during that 
strange eery vigil there in the heart 



DROME 



203 



of the living rock, heard even the 
faintest, most fleeting sound. As the 
watcher sat there waiting and listen- 
ing, whilst the minutes slowly passed, 
he found himself — at any rate, I 
know that I did — almost ■wishing that 
some pulsation would come, so heavy 
and awful was. the stillness of the 
place. x 

But a sound we were to hear. We 
had been journeying for about an 
hour and a half and had just passed 
below sea-level. In that place Rhodes 
had left the aneroid. Of a sudden 
Milton, who was leading the way, 
halted with a low, sharp interjection 
for silence. When my look struck 
him, he was standing in an attitude 
of the most riveted attention. 

' ‘ There ! ” he exclaimed. ‘ * Did you 
hear that, Bill?” 

The air had pulsed to the faintest 
sound ; now all was still again. 

“What was it?” I asked, my voice 
a whisper. 

“Don’t know, Bill. There!” 

Again that gentle pulsation 
touched the ear, and again it /was 
gone. And a strange thing was that, 
for the life of me, I could not have 
told whether it came from below or 
from behind ms. 

“There it is again!” said Rhodes. 

I flashed on my electric light, to the 
full power. 

“A whisper!” I exclaimed. “And, 
great heaven, Milton!” 

“What now, Bill ?” he asked quick- 
ly. 

“It’s something behind ns!” 

He started. He turned his light 
up the tunnel, and for some moments 
we stood peering intently. Not a 
moving thing was to be seen there, 
however — only the moving shadows. 

“Again!” said Milton Rhodes. 
“But it isn’t a whisper, Bill. And 
it didn’t come from up there.” 

“The thing,” I told him, “could 
be hiding in shadow.” 

“It’s not up there; it is ahead.” 



‘ ‘ Wherever it is, what on earth can 
it be? — what does it mean?” 

' ' That we shall learn. ’ ’ 

TT7e resumed our descent, every 
’ ’ sense, you may be sure, on the 
qui vive. The tunnel here inclined 
rather steeply; a little space, howev- 
er, and the dip was a gentle one. The 
sounds soon became ono steady, un- 
broken whisper; then a dull melan- 
choly murmur. 

Abruptly Rhodes stopped, turned 
to me, and he laughed. 

“Know now what it is, Bill?” 

This was not a moment, I thought, 
for laughter or anything like it. 

‘ ‘ Sounds like the growling of 
beasts,” I said, peering intently 
down the passage. “I wonder if the 
angel — there are two kinds of angel, 
you know — has turned loose a whole 
pack, or flock, of those demons. ’ ’ 

To my surprize and astonishment, 
Rhodes burst into outright laughter. 

“Well?” said I rather testily. 
“Why all the cachinnation?” 

“Forgive me, Bill. But it isn’t a 
pack of demons — or a flock.” 

“How on earth do you know what 
it is?” 

“It’s water.” 

“Water?” 

“Yes. H-two-O.” . 

“Water? I’m from Missouri. 
You’d better see that your revolver is 
handy. Who ever heard water make 
a shivery sound like that?” 

“You 11 see, though I think that 
you ’ll hear first. ’ ’ 

Ere long there could be no doubt 
about it : Milton was right ; it was 
the sound of falling water. 

“Must be at quite a distance,” I 
said; “sounds carry a long way in 
tubes, and that is what this tvrnnel 
is.” 

Steadily we made our way along 
and down, and, just as steadily, the 
sound increased in volume. The gal- 
lery made several sharp turns, and 
then of a sudden the sound rose from 



204 



WEIRD TALES 



a loud growl to a roar, and an ex- 
clamation burst from us. 

It were impossible to convey to the 
reader the eery effect of that sud- 
den, strange transition. One moment 
we were in the gallery; the next we 
had issued from it and stood in a 
most tremendous cavern — or, rather, 
on a ledge or shelf high up on one of 
the walls of that cavern. 

The opposite side was but dimly 
visible. The roof swept across a 
hundred feet or more above our 
heads. And the bottom? I gazed at 
the edge of the rock shelf on which 
w T e stood, out and down into that 
yawning abyss, and I felt a shudder 
run through me and on through my 
heart. The roar of the falling waters 
came from our right. We turned the 
rays of our lights in that direction, 
but nothing was visible there, save 
the dark limestone rock and Cim- 
merian blackness. 

We then moved to the edge and 
turned our lights down into those 
awful depths — to depths perhaps nev- 
er before touched by ray of light 
since time began. Far down the 
beams went plunging and farther 
still ; but we could not see the bottom. 
Bottom there was, however, for the 
water was tumbling and growling 
down there. 

I was glad to draw back from the 
edge, and I leaned against the rock 
wall and gazed upon the dark scene 
in wonder, amazement and awe. 
Rhodes joined me. 

“Well, what do you think of it, 
Bill?” 

“Milton, this is awful.” 

“It is. I have never seen a sight 
more strange and terrible.” 

“And the angel?” I queried. 

“What about her, Bill?” 

“How on earth did she make her 
way through this awful place?” 

“Why, along this ledge on which 
we are standing. There is no other 
way.” 



I glanced along that shelf, and I 
felt very sad. 

“She’s got a better head,” I told 
him, “than I have. Why didn’t we 
bring along an airplane? I wonder 
if the way lies down or up, toward 
the fall.” 

We bent over and examined the 
rock. 

“Down,” I observed. 

“Down,” Milton nodded. 

Whilst I stood there pondering 
this and wondering what was down 
there in the blackness of that fright- 
ful chasm, Rhodes moved off to the 
right and examined the ledge there. 

“And up too,” he announced. 
“Somebody or something, or both, 
has gone up toward the fall. ’ ’ 

“Great heaven, if we get caught 
between them ! ’ ’ 

“The program is becoming, inter- 
esting,” Rhodes admitted. 

For a time we stood in silence, 
then Milton said : “I suggest that we 
go up and take a look-see. ’ ’ 

I nodded. So far as I could per- 
ceive, one way was just as good — I 
mean just as bad — as the other. 

That shelf was, as a whole, not. an 
easy thing to negotiate, and some 
spots made my head swim and made 
me wish mightily that I was some- 
where else. Undoubtedly, some thou- 
sands of years in the dim and mys- 
terious past, the stream once flowed 
at this level — at any rate, that is the 
only theory that, in my opinion, will 
explain that ledge, and something we 
were soon to discover. Not that I 
ever spent much time in worrying 
about theories and hypotheses; the 
facts themselves gave me enough to 
think about, enough and to spare. 

At times the shelf would be twenty 
or thirty feet in width or even more, 
and then the going was easy enough ; 
but at other times the space would 
contract to a couple of yards, and 
then it was another story. Once or 
twice Milton Rhodes himself, an ex- 
perienced and fearless mountain- 



DROME 



205 



climber, was glad, I believe, that the 
way was no narrower. As for what 
those moments meant to me — well, I 
never posed as a mountaineer or a 
steeplejack. 

For fifteen minutes or so, I believe, 
we toiled along that terrible place, 
and then of a sudden came to the 
end. Nothing before us but the bare 
precipitous rocky wall and the black 
profundity of the chasm, and up 
above a ghostly thing crawling, 
crawling down, ever down, and filling 
the place with thunder — the fall it- 
self. Where did the water come 
from? And, a question more inter- 
esting, where did it go? 

“We must go back,” said Milton 
Rhodes. “The road to Drome does 
not lie here.” 

Scarcely had we turned when I 
started, and then I cried out sharply. 

“Look!” I said, pointing with my 
alpenstock down the cavern. “Look 
at that ! ’ ’ 

Far down the cave a light was 
gleaming, where a moment before no 
light had been. And on the instant 
another shone beside it. A second or 
two, however, and they had vanished. 

“Moving,” was Rhodes’ explana- 
tion. 

“No!” I told him. “And look! 
Again!” 

There they were — gleaming at us 
for all the world like the dim and 
baleful eyes of some waiting monster. 

CHAPTER 18 

“THAT’S WHERE THEY ARE 
WAITING FOR US!” 

F ew some moments those yellow 
eyes gleamed at us, then van- 
ished. The lids of that waiting mon- 
ster (so to speak) had elosed over 
them. 

I had watched them very closely, 
and I was sure that there had been 
no movement of the eyes themselves. 
Milton, however, was just as sure 
that they had moved. 



“To the right or to the left?” I 
queried. 

“Neither. Down,” said Rhodes. 

“Then it must have been straight 
down. ’ ’ 

“It was — behind a rock mass or 
something. ’ ’ 

We waited, watching closely, but 
those yellow eyes did not gleam again 
through that Stygian gloom. 

“Must have been at quite a dis- 
tance, ’ ’ I remarked at last. 

‘ ‘ It seems so, Bill ; and that means 
that this cavern is very straight for 
a mile or more or that it is one of 
enormous size.” 

“It may be both.” 

“It may be.. And it may be that 
those lights were not so far away as 
they appeared to be. One may eas- 
ily be deceived in such matters.” 

“We don’t know what it means,” 
I said, “but we know this: we’re 
spotted. ’ ’ 

“Oh, we’re seen, all right, Bill. 
Our every movement will be 
watched. ’ ’ 

Some minutes passed, during which 
we stood peering down the cavern 
and waiting; but no light gleamed 
forth again. Then we started back. 

“We’d better keep a sharp look- 
out,” I said suddenly. “Remember, 
a demon doesn’t have to come along 
the ledge.” 

“I have not forgotten that, Bill; 
but we are armed.” 

As I believe was made sufficient- 
ly obvious, the crossing of those 
places where the ledge narrowed to 
the width of but a couple of yards 
had been no pleasant matter; but 
during the return the thing assumed 
an aspect truly sinister. That we were 
being watched both of us regarded as 
certain. That we might at any mo- 
ment find a demon or a dozen demons 
driving at us — well, that was a pos- 
sibility which never left our thoughts 
for one single second. And, in those 
narrow places, where the ledge con- 
tracted to a mere ribbon of rock, it. 



m

was all one wanted to do to hug the 
wall and make sure of his footing. A 
frightful place, truly, in which to 
meet, even with a revolver, the attack 
of even one of those winged mon- 
sters; and we might find ourselves 
attacked by a dozen. 

It can easily be imagined, then, the 
relief which I felt when we had 
passed the last narrow spot, though, 
forsooth, we might be going toward 
something far more terrible than any 
we had left behind us. But the angel 
had gone down, and where a woman 
could go, there, I told myself in mas- 
culine pride, could we also. 

“That is,’’ I subjoined, “suppos- 
ing we do not meet ape-bats or some- 
thing more terrible. ’ ’ 

At length we stood once more at 
the mouth of the gallery. And scarce- 
ly had we stopped there when an un- 
pleasant thing flashed into my 
thoughts — which, as it was, resembled 
anything but the rainbow. 

“Great heaven!” I cried, peering 
into the tunnel, which, at the dis- 
tance of only thirty feet or so, gave 
a sudden turn to the right. 

Something could be in there, very 
close to us and yet unseen ! 

“What is it, Bill?” 

“Could those lights that we saw 
have been here? Are they waiting in 
there to dog our steps or to do some- 
thing worse?” 

Rhodes, peering into the gallery 
with a curious, half-vacuous expres- 
sion on his face, made no reply. 

“Well,” I queried, “what do you 
think of it? We could not tell where 
those lights were, how far away — 
anything. ’ ’ 

“I don’t think that they were 
here,” Milton Rhodes returned. “I 
think they were much farther down 
and on the other side” 

“On the other side? How on earth 
could anyone cross that chasm ? ’ ’ 
“We don’t know what it is like 
down there. And, of course, I don’t 
know that the lights were on the 



other side. But I believe that they 
were. ’ ’ 

A silence ensued, which at length I 
broke : 

“What is the next thing on the 
program ? ’ ’ 

“Make our way down the ledge. 
That is the only way we can go. But 
first we ’ll try a little finesse. ” 

He took a position in the mouth of 
the tunnel, one . that permitted him 
to look down the cavern. He signed 
to me to follow suit, and, when I 
stood at his side, he said : ‘ ‘ Off go the 
lights ! ’ ’ 

Off they went, and the terrible 
blackness was upon us. So terrible 
was it and so strange and fearful 
that place in which we stood, I 
actually found myself wondering if 
it would not all prove a dream. 

“Why,” I asked at last, “did we 
do this?” 

“To see if the lights will show 
again. They may think that we have 
lost heart and started back. ’ ’ 

I saw it all now: instead of our 
advancing to those mysterious beings 
somewhere down the cavern, he would 
bring them to us. 

But they did not come. They did 
not show even the faintest light. We 
waited there for many minutes, but 
nothing whatever was seen. 

“Hum!” said Rhodes at last, snap- 
ping on his light- “Wary folk, Bill, 
these Hypogeans. ’ ’ 

“And so,” I replied, “we’ll have 
to go to them.” 

‘ ‘ That ’s what we shall have to do. ’ ’ 
“Walk maybe right into a trap.” 
“It is possible,” Rhodes admitted. 
“But it is possible too that the trap 
may not prove so terrible — possible, 
indeed, that there is no trap at all. I 
tell you, I certainly would like to see 
that angel again.” 

“Then let’s go see her.” 

“That’s what we’ll do.” 

And so we started. 



DROME 



207 



A strange, indefinable dread had 
its grip upon me, and yet I was 
anxious to go, to put the thing to an 
issue. In all probability, we should 
not have far to travel. Nor, in fact, 
did we. 

The way was much like the one 
that we had traversed in the opposite 
direction. One or two spots were ev- 
en more dangerous than any we had 
found up there. And, over these 
dangerous, terrible places, where a 
false step or a slip of the foot on 
the smooth rock would have meant 
a most horrible death — along this 
airy, dizzy Stygian way, the angel 
had passed. Well, she was a brave 
angel, at any rate. 

We were descending all the while, 
sometimes at an angle that I was 
glad was no steeper. This, does not 
mean, however, that our distance 
from the bottom, of that terrible 
chasm, on our right, was decreasing. 
The sounds that came up from the 
black depths of it told plainly that 
the descent of tlie stream was as pro- 
nounced as that of the ledge we were 
following, and perhaps more so. 

“And here’s something that I 
don’t understand,’’ was my remark 
as we stopped in a particularly bro- 
ken spot : “ to say nothing of our be- 
ing below sea-level, here this stream 
has been pouring down for untold 
centuries, for how many thousands 
of years no man can even guess, and 
yet the place isn’t full. Where does 
all the water go ? ” 

“Think,” was Milton’s answer, 
“of all the rivers that, for how many 
millions of years no man can tell, 
have been running into the sea, and 
yet the sea is not overflowing. ’ ’ 

‘ ‘ I don ’t see the application of that 
to this underground world, don’t see 
how all the water — there must be 
more streams than this — can possibly 
return as vapor to the region above. ’ ’ 
“I admit,” Rhodes said, “that the 
problem is a formidable one and that, 
with our present paucity of data, we 



can not hope to solve it. Still I think 
my. suggestion sound. ’ ’ 

“But where are the openings to 
permit the escape of so enonnous — 
for enormous it must be — an amount 
of water vapor?” 

‘ ‘ There may be countless vents, 
fissures, Bill, ways of egress that man 
will never know. Whatever the ex- 
planation, there can be no doubt that 
the w r ater is going down and that this 
subterranean 'world is not full.” 
“But where does it go? Down to 
some sunless sea, perhaps, though, if 
that hypothesis of yours is a sound 
one, bathed in light, light never seen, 
in that world we have left, on land 
or sea.” 

Rhodes was a silent for a moment, 
leaning on his alpenstock. Then : 
“It is strange, truly, the descent of 
the .waters. And yet it would not, I 
believe, have been to you so very 
strange a thing had you known that 
the sea itself flows into the earth. ’ ’ 

‘ ‘ The sea itself ? ” 

Rhodes nodded. 

‘ ‘ Surely, Milton— why, the thing is 
Jules Vemesque!” 

“On the contrary, the fact has 
long been known. At Argostoli in 
the Island of Cephalonia, the sea 
flows right into the limestone rock. ’ ’* 
“Shades of Lemuel Gulliver, but 
this old ball that men call the earth 
is certainly a strange old sphere ! ’ ’ 
“How strange,” said Milton 
Rhodes, “no scientist has ever 
dreamed, though your scientist has 
thought of things far stranger than 

* “The cases are certainly not numerous where 
marine currents are known to pour continuously 
into cavities beneath the surface of th earth, but 
there is at least one well-authenticated instance 
of this sort — that of the mill streams at Argostoli 
in the island of Cephalonia. It had been lorn? 
observed that the sea water flowed into several 
rifts and cavities in the limestone rocks of the 
coast, but the phenomenon has excited litt’e at- 
tention until very recently. In J833. three of the 
entrances were closed, and a regular channel six- 
teen feet long and thr^e f'*et w ; with a fall of 
three feet, was cut into the mouth of a larger 
cavity. The sea water flowed into this canal, 
and could be followed eighteen or twenty feet be- 
yond its inner terminus, when it disappeared in 
holes and clefts, in the rock.” — George P. Marsh: 
Man and Nature .

any ever conceived by your wildest 
romancer, who, after all, Bill, is a 
pretty tam'e homo.” 

“I have an idea,” I said, glancing 
down the cavern, “ that we are going 
to find the homos here in this place 
anything but tame.” 

Milton laughed and, without any 
other answer, turned and resumed 
the descent. 

For one thing I was profoundly 
thankful : the wall ran along with- 
out any pronounced cavities or pro- 
jections in it, so that we had little to 
appi’ehend from a sudden attack on 
this our giddy way — except, or 
course^ by a demon. Had the wall 
been a broken one, any instant might 
have found us face to face with a 
band of Hypogeans, as Rhodes called 
the denizens of this subterranean 
place. 

But how long would the wall re- 
main like that? And, after all, did 
it really greatly matter? Meeting, 
sooner or later, was inevitable. ’Tis 
true, I could not conceive of a worse 
place than this, supposing the meet- 
ing to be, in any measure, an un- 
friendly one. And, from what had 
happened up there at the Tamahno- 
wis Rocks, I could not suppose that 
it would be anything else. 

This, however, was to prove simply 
another instance of how inadequate 
the imagination, when confronted 
with the reality, ■ is sometimes found 
to be, for even now we w r ere drawing 
near a place more terrible even than 
this — and that was the place where 
-we met ! 

It required but little imagination, 
though, to make us aware, and pain- 
fully so, of the extreme probability 
(regarded by ourselves as a certi- 
tude) that eyes were watching our 
every movement. But where were 
those eyes ? And what were the 
watchers? To what fearful thing— 
or could it be wonderful? — were We 
drawing near at every single moment 
now? 



Some minutes passed, perhaps fif- 
teen, perhaps more; I can not say 
how long it was. Of a sudden, how- 
ever, Rhodes, who was still leading 
the way, stopped. No. sound had es- 
caped him, and he stood there like a 
statue, peering intently straight 
ahead. 

“Look there,”, he said in a low 
voice, pointing with his alpenstock, 
“and tell me what you see.” 

I was already looking, and already 
I had seen it. But what on earth 
was that thing which I saw? 

I remained silent, gazing with 
straining eyesand wondering if I 
really saw what I thought that I did. 

“What,” asked Rhodes, “do you 
make of it?” 

“The thing is so faint. ’Tis im- 
possible, and yet, if it were not so, I 
would say that it is an arch — part of 
a bridge.” 

“Just what I thought. The thing 
is so strange, though, that I didn’t 
know whether to believe my eyes or 
not. ” 

“And so dim,” I observed, “that 
it may be nothing of the kind. A 
bridge? Now,' who on earth would 
build a bridge across this frightful 
chasm? And why?” 

“Quien sake, Bill?” said Milton 
Rhodes. 

The next moment we were moving 
toward it. 

“Look!” ejaculated Rhodes sud- 
denly. “It goes clear aeross!” 

“ Yes, ” I said, stopping and gazing 
at that strange dim mass ; “it goes 
clear across. And that’s the place, 
over there on the other side — that’s 
where they are waiting for us!” 

CHAPTER 19 

THE ANGEL AND HER DEMON 

“ T shouldn’t be a bit surprized,” 
said Milton. “Ai.d a strange 
bridge, that, truly. It looks like a 
ruin, a ruin that has not fallen.” 



DROME 



209 



It was a ruin indeed. So ruinous 
was it that I wondered how the mass 
could possibly remain intact. A short 
advance, however, and the mystery 
was solved. The hand of man had 
not builded that great arch across this 
dreadful chasm ; nature had fash- 
ioned it, there in that region of ever- 
lasting darkness. It has, Rhodes said, 
a remarkable semblance to the cele- 
brated Natural Bridge in Virginia. 

A short space, and we stood upon 
it, gazing across. Its width here was 
about sixty feet. The surface was, 
comparatively speaking, a smooth 
one, and it had a rather pronounced 
slope upward — a circumstance by no 
means conducive to security of foot- 
ing. And a feature that I noticed 
with some unpleasant misgivings was 
the diminution of width at the far- 
ther end. Just how wide it was there 
wc could not tell, what with the un- 
certain light that struggled to the 
spot ; but we saw enough to know that 
that way which we should have to 
cross was a very narrow one indeed ; 
and on either side the black chasm 
yawning to receive us. And just be- 
yond, dim and ghostly as though 
seen in a dream, stupendous columns 
rose up and were involved in the 
darkness of the lofty cavern. 

“What on earth arc those?” I 
queried. “It reminds one of a Grec- 
ian temple.” 

“Limestone pillars, no doubt,” re- 
turned Milton. 

“And it’s there,” I exclaimed, my 
voice, however, low and guarded, 
‘ * that they are waiting for us ! That 
is where those lights were.” 

* ‘ I suppose so. ’ ’ 

“They’ll wait until we get in that 
cursed narrow place, and then ” 

“And then?” 

“Well,” I told him, “we had bet- 
ter say our prayers before we start 
across.” 

Rhodes laughed. I thought, 
though, that there was a touch of the 
sardonic in his laugh. Little wonder, 



forsooth, if ’twas so, for the thing 
was fraught w r ith terrible possibili- 
ties. 

“What,” I asked, “are we to do?” 

“Cross over — if we are permitted 
to do so.” 

If we should be permitted to do so ! 

I gazed into the black profundity 
of the chasm, and felt very sad. 

“Holy Gorgons,” I said, “haven’t 
we got into a fine pickle, though?” 

“I'll tell you what we’ll do, Bill: 
you remain here, like Horatius at the 
bridge, while I explore along the 
ledge. 1 ’ 

“I don’t like it,” I told him. 
“United we stand — well, you know 
the rest of it.” 

He was silent for some moments. 
Then: “I think that we can risk it. 
Bill.” 

“Very well,” I acquiesced, shrug- 
ging my shoulders. “But I tell you 
that I don ’t like it at all. ’ ’ 

The next moment, however, he had 
turned and w r as moving down the 
ledge. I stepped back to the wall 
(upon which two inscriptions were 
traced) and waited the result with 
such composure as I could summon. 

At last Rhodes moved behind a 
projection in the wall. A moment, 
and the glow of his light had van- 
ished. ne was gone, and I was alone 
in that terrible place. 

The blackness seemed to increase, 
the shadows to thicken about me and 
grow denser. But one sound broke 
the awful silence, which sound 
seemed to have a quality tangible, 
crushing — the growl of the water in 
the abysmal depths of the chasm. 
And even that sound, as I stood there 
listening, watching, -waiting, seemed 
to change ; it seemed to sink to a mur- 
mur. then a whisper, as though evil 
spirits were hushing it to lull my sus- 
picions and even my very senses. 

What was that? I started, and 
something shot through my very 
heart, chilling and sharp as the 
needle point of an icicle. 



210 



WEIRD TALES 



Surely I had seen it. Yes ! There 
it was again, dim but unmistakable, 
there by one of the great columns — 
a single point of light, an eye staring 
at me with a greenish fire. 

Yes, there it was! Then of a sud- 
den it was gone. 

For a time I stood peering and 
waiting, the blood throbbing in my 
ears ; but it was not seen again. 

I turned and looked down the 
ledge, and I gave an exclamation that 
was one of relief and joy, for there 
was Rhodes just come into view 
around that projection in the wall. 

“What,” I asked as he drew near, 
“did you find down there?” 

“We can’t go down. The shelf is 
broken — nothing but sheer wall be- 
tween. So it’s across the bridge for 
us. ’ ’ • 

“We may never reach the other 
side.” 

And then I told him what I had 
seen. 

“And,” I asked, “didn’t Grand- 
father Scranton say that the eyes of 
the demon burned with a greenish 
fire?” 

Rhodes nodded. 

“Of course, though,” he said, 
“light has to reach them, or the eyes 
can’t shine. In absolute darkness 
they would not do so.” 

“That eye shone, though ghostly, 
for the light that reaches that spot 
is dim. And so the angel at least — 
and heaven only knows what besides 
— is waiting there with her demon!” 

“Yes, Bill; there can be no doubt 
that the eye which you saw belonged 
to a demon. The prospect is certain- 
ly a sinister one, I admit.” 

A silence ensued. Of a sudden 
Rhodes raised his voice and hallooed : 
“Hello there!” 

The answer came almost on the in- 
stant: “Hello there — hello there — 

hello there — hello — hello ! ’ ’ 

“ ’Tis only Echo, lovely Echo,” 
smiled Milton Rhodes. 

Again he raised his voice, and 



again the words were thrown back at 
him. 

“Hear that, Bill?” he cried whilst 
the echoes were still sounding. 

“I heard it.’.’ 

‘ ‘ That was no echo ! ’ ’ 

“No,” I said; “it was no echo!” 
We waited, listening intently, but 
that sound which had come with the 
echoes was not heard again. 

Rhodes drew his revolver and ex- 
amined the weapon most carefully. 
He looked at me curiously, and then 
he said: “I have no desire, Bill, to 
disguise the fact that this crossing 
may prove a most, a most — Bill, it 
may prove ” 

“You needn’t tell me,” said I. “I 
know very well what it may mean. ’ ’ 
“But we can’t turn back, Bill.” 
“No; we can’t turn back.” 

He reached out his hand and 
grasped mine. And then, without 
another word, we started. 

I had known some critical, tei'- 
rible, horrible scenes in my life ; but 
never anything like the suspense and 
mystery of those moments that now 
succeeded. What were we to see? 
What were we to meet? And, hor- 
ror of horrors, it would be in that 
place where the bridge narrowed to 
a mere ribbon — the frightful depths 
yawning on each side, almost at our 
vei’y feet. 

Well, at last we reached it. My 
head began to swim, so terrible was 
the place, and I had to stop and get 
a grip upon my nerves. Rhodes too 
paused, and for some moments we 
stood there, so near to safety and 
yet — the mockery of it! — closer than 
ever to mystery and danger and 
perhaps horror unnamable. 

“Now for it, Bill!” said Rhodes. 
“Keep your revolver ready for in- 
stant action!” 

And we started across. The place 
was so narrow that we could not 
think of walking side bv side. 
Rhodes was leading. And then it 
came — when we had taken eight or 



DROME 



211 



ten steps, when we had reached the 
most dangerous spot on that ribbon 
of rock. 

Of a sudden a dark figure, strain- 
ing at its leash, moved from behind 
one of the limestone pillars, and two 
eyes shone horribly in the light, 
burning with a greenish fire, and 
the strong rays were flashed back in 
the horrid gleam of teeth. And, be- 
side that demoniac shape, a tall fig- 
ure appeared, a figure clothed in 
white, the eyes wide and blazing, 
the face white as snow and framed 
in gleaming gold, which fell in mass- 
es about the shoulders — a figure ma- 
jestic, indescribably lovely and dread- 
ful. 

It was the angel and her demon! 

CHAPTER 20 

THE ATTACK 

npHAT strange, weird scene, like 
some terrible vision from the 
pages of Dor6, often rises before me 
—the tall white figure of the angel, 
the dark, squatting winged monster 
before her, and we two men from 
the sunlit world standing there upon 
that narrow way,, the black profund- 
ity of the chasm yawning on either 
side of us. 

The angel had indeed well chosen 
the moment. If that hideous ape- 
bat, straining at its leash, were 
loosed at us, our position, despite 
our revolvers, would be a truly hor- 
rible one. Scarce twenty-five feet 
lay between the monster and our- 
selves. In case of attack, we would 
have to drop the monster in its 
spring — and only a lucky shot could 
do that — or the result would be a 
most disastrous one. For we could 
not meet an attack there; to step 
aside or to meet the demon in a 
struggle would mean a plunge over 
the edge. 

It was indeed a critical, appalling 
scene, one in which I have no de- 
sire to see even my worst enemy 



placed. Our fate, I thought, was in 
the hands of that white-robed, white- 
faced being whom we knew as the 
angel. The dembn, however, as will 
be seen in a moment, was to take 
the matter in his own hands, if I 
may use that expression in speaking 
of that monster, for hands the thing 
had none. I can easily see how the 
demon, in the obscurity of the fog, 
had seemed to old Scranton a thing 
that had no shape. But here, the 
strong rays of our lights turned full 
upon the demon, the sight was an 
altogether different one. And a 
stranger sight surely no man had 
ever seen up there in that world 
which we had left, that world so 
near to us still, and yet it seemed so 
very far away now. It was as 
though some Circe had changed us 
into figures in some dread story of 
ancient days. And this was what 
men called the Twentieth Century, 
the golden age of science and dis- 
covery! Well, science doesn’t yet 
know everything — a fact that, I am 
sorry to say, some scientists them- 
selves are very prone to forget. 

“Heavens,” said Rhodes, keeping 
his look fixed on those figures before 
us, “isn’t she a wonderful crea- 
ture!” 

“And it,” said I, “an awful 
thing ! And I ’d wait a while before 
saying that she is wonderful. She 
may prove to be something very dif- 
ferent. ’ ’ 

The next instant I gave a cry. 
The demon had made a sudden 
strain forward. Came a sharp word 
from the angel, and that cerberus 
sank back again. But, though it 
sank back, that greenish fire in its 
eyes seemed to burn more fiercely, 
malevolently, than before. 

“I think,” I suggested, “it would 
be a good plan to move back a little, 
back to a safer, a wider spot.” 

“Move back? Never!” said Mil- 
ton Rhodes. “We are here to move 
forward, not to go back.” 



212 



WEIRD TALES 



I thought this utterly Quixotic; 
but, of course, if he didn’t want to 
go back, I couldn’t make him. And, 
if he wouldn’t step back, neither 
would I. 

“Look,” I said. “She is going 
to speak.” 

The angel raised her left hand 
and motioned to us rather vehement- 
ly, at the same time uttering some 
word — or words. 

“No mistaking that, Bill,” said 
Milton. 

“No; it is as plain as any words 
could be : ‘Go back ! ’ ” 

“I am at a loss,” said Rhodes, 
“how to answer.” 

Again the angel raised her hand; 
but she did not motion this time, 
for the demon, with a blood-curdling 
sound, deep in its throat, strained 
forward again, and so suddenly and 
strongly that the angel was drawn 
forward a step or two. A sharp 
word, however, from the angel, and 
the monster settled back, as a dog 
does after straining at its leash. 

Once more the angel fixed her 
eyes upon us — or, rather, upon Mil- 
ton Rhodes. Once more she raised 
her hand to sign to us to go back. 
But the sign was never given! 

At that instant, as the angel stood 
there with upraised hand, it hap- 
pened. 

That sound came again, only more 
horrible than before, and the demon 
sprang at us. Caught thus off her 
guard, the angel was jerked, whirled 
forward. There was a wild, pierc- 
ing cry, which rose to a scream ; but 
the winged monster paid not the 
slightest heed. It was as though the 
thing had gone mad. The angel 
went down; in an instant, however, 
she was up again. She screamed at 
the demon, but it lunged toward us, 
flapping its great hideous wings and 
dragging her after it out onto the 
bridge. Her position now -was one 
of peril scarcely less than our own. 

All this had passed, of course, 



with the quickness of thought. We 
could not fire, for fear of hitting the 
angel, right behind the demon; we 
could not move back; and we could 
not stand there and let this night- 
mare monster come upon us. In a 
second or two, if nothing was done, 
it could do so. But what could we 
do? The thought of saving our- 
selves by killing the woman — and 
the chances were a hundred to one 
that we should kill her if we fired at 
the demon — was a horrible one. But 
to stand there and be sent over the 
edge was horrible too. And the 
angel, in all probability, would be 
killed anyway; that she had not al- 
ready been jerked from the rock was 
nothing less than a miracle. Why 
didn’t she loose her hold on the 
leash ? 

These are some of the things that 
flashed through my mind — yes, even 
then. I never before knew what a 
rapid thing thought can be. Oh, 
those things that shot through my 
brain in those brief, horrible sec- 
onds! My whole life, from child- 
hood to that very moment, flashed 
before me liko the film of a cinema- 
tograph, though with the speed of 
light. I wondered what death was 
like — what it would be like some- 
where in the depths of that black 
gulf. And I wondered why the 
angel did not loose her hold on that 
leash! I didn’t know that she had 
wrapped the chain around her hand 
and that the chain had in some way 
got caught. The poor angel could 
not free herself ! 

Little wonder, forsooth, that she 
was screaming so fearfully. 

“We must risk it!” I cried. 

“Hold!” 

The next instant Milton Rhodes 
had stepped aside — yes, stepped 
right to the very edge of the rock. 
The demon whirled at him, and, as 
it whirled, one of its great wings 
struck me full across the face. I 
gave myself up for lost, but some-

how I kept my plaoe on that ribbon 
of rock. Another instant, and the 
monster would be at Milton ’s throat. 
But no ! From this dizzy position 
which he had so suddenly taken, the 
angel was no longer behind the 
demon, and on the instant Rhodes 
fired. 

Oh, that scream which the mon- 
ster gave! It struck the rock, and 
that Rhodes managed to keep his 
footing on the edge of that fearful 
place is one of the most amazing 
things that I have ever seen. But 
keep it he did, and he fired again 
and again. The demon flapped back- 
ward, jerked the angel to. her knees 
and near the edge and then suddenly 
flat on her face. The next instant 
the monster disappeared. Its wings 
were beating against the rock with 
a spasmodic, hideous sound. 

I gave a cry of relief and joy; but 
the next moment one of dismay and . 
horror broke from me. 

The monster was dragging the 
angel over the edge ! 

CHAPTER 21 
INTO THE CHASM 

/f ilton Rhodes threw himself 
-L * prone on the rock and his right 
arm around the angel’s waist. 

‘ ‘ Quick, Bill, quick ! Her arm — 
the whole weight of the monster!” 

Her sereams had ceased, but from 
her throat broke a moan, long, 
tremulous, heartrending — a sound 
to shake and rend my already quiv- 
ering nerves to enhance most dread- 
fully the indescribable horror of the 
scene and the moment. 

I could do nothing where I was, 
had to step over the prostrate forms, 
which, in my heated imagination, 
were being dragged over the, edge. 

The wings of the demon were still 
beating against the rock, the blows 
not so strong but more spasmodic — 
the sound a leathery, sickening tat- 
too. 



It will probably be remembered 
that the angel had held the demon 
with her right hand. I was now on 
the angel’s right; and, stretched out 
on the rock, I reached down over the 
edge in an effort to free her from 
that dragging monster, the black 
depths over which we hung turning 
me dizzy and faint. 

I now saw how the angel had been 
caught and that she had been 
dragged so far over the edge that I 
could not, long-armed though I am, 
reach the leash. So I grasped her 
arm and, with a word of encourage- 
ment, began to pull. Slowly we 
drew the monster up. Another mo- 
ment,. and the chain would be with- 
in the reach of my other hand. Yes, 
there. Steady, so. I had reached 
down my other hand, my fingers 
were in the very act of closing on 
the chain, when, horrors, I felt my- 
self slipping along the smooth rock 
— slipping over into that appalling 
gulf. 

To save myself, I had to let go the 
angel’s arm, and, as the chain jerked 
to the monster’s weight, an awful 
cry broke from the angel and from 
Milton Rhodes, and I saw her body 
dragged farther over. 

“Cut it, Bill, cut it!” 

“It’s a chain.” 

Rhodes groaned. 

“We must try again. Great heav- 
en, we can’t let her be dragged 
over!” 

“This horrible spot makes the 
head swim.” 

“Steady, Bill, steady,” said 
Rhodes. “Here, hold her while L 
get a grip with my other arm. Then 
I ’ll get a hold on you with my 
right.” 

“We’ll all be dragged over.” 

“Nonsense,” said Rhodes. “And, 
besides, I’ve got a hold with my feet 
now, in a crack or something.” 

A few moments, and I was again 
reaching down, Rhodes’ grip upon 
me this time. Again I laid hold on 



214 WEIRD; TALES 



the angel’s arm, and again she and 
I drew the monster up. This time, 
though, I got my other hand on the 
chain. And yet, even then, the chain 
hanging slack above my hand, the 
angel' was some time in freeing her 
own, from the fingers of which blood 
was dripping. But at last she had 
loosened the chain, ' hnd then I let 
go my hold upon it, and down the 
demon went, still flapping its wings, 
though feebly now, and disappeared 
into those black and fearful depths. 

I have no recollection of any 
sound coming up. Undoubtedly a 
sound came. Little wonder, for- 
sooth, that I did not hear it. 

A moment, and I was back from 
the edge, and Milton and I were 
drawing the angel to the safety of 
that narrow way. She sank back in 
Rhodes’ arms, her eyes closed, her 
head, almost hidden in the gleaming 
golden hair, on her shoulder. 

“She’s fainted,” said I. 

‘ ‘ Little wonder if she has, Bill. ’ ’ 

But she had not. Scarcely had he 
spoken when she opened her eyes. 
At once she sat tip, and I saw a faint 
color suffuse those snowy features. 

“Well,” said I to myself, “what- 
ever else she may be, our angel is 
human.” 

We remained there for a little 
while, recovering from the effects of 
the horrible scene through which we 
had passed, then arose and started 
for that place of safety there 
amongst the wonderful, stupendous 
limestone pillars. I was now mov- 
ing in advance, and I confess (and 
nothing could more plainly show 
how badly my nerves had been 
shaken) that I would gladly have 
covered those few remaining yards 
on all foul’s— if my pride would have 
permitted me to do so. 

Yes, there we stood, by that very 
pillar behind which the angel had 
waited for us with her demon. 
There was her lamp — lantern rather 



—dark, of - course, though not ex- 
tinguished. 

I looked at it and looked all 
around. 

“We saw two lights,” I said. 
“And yet she was waiting here 
alone .” 

“There certainly were two lights, 
Bill— two persons at least. Her com- 
panion went somewhere ; that is the 
only explanation I can think of.” 

“I wonder where,” said I, “and 
what for.” 

“Help, perhaps. You know, Bill, 
I have an idea that, if we had de- 
layed much longer, our reception 
there,” and he waved a hand toward 
the : bridge, “ would have been a 
very different one.” 

“It was interesting enough to suit 
me. And, as it is, heaven only 
knows what is to follow. ’ ’ 

The angel, standing there straight 
and still, was watching us intently, 
so strange, a look in her eyes — those 
eyes were blue: — that a chill passed 
through my heated brain, and T 
actually began, to wonder if I was 
being hypnotized. Hypnotized? And 
in this cursed spot ! . 

I turned my .lbok straight into the 
eyes of the angel, and, as I looked, I 
flung a secret curse : at that strange 
weakness of mine and called myself 
a fool for haying entertained, even 
for a fleeting moment, a thought so 
absurd. 

Rhodes had noticed, and he turned 
his look upoii me and upon the wo- 
man — this creature so indescribably 
lovely and yet with, so indefinable, 
mysterious a Sibylline something 
about her. • For some moments 
there was silence. I thought that I 
saw fear in those blue eyes of hers, 
but I could not be sure. That 
strange look, whether one of fear or 
of something else, was not all that 
I saw there ;. but I strove in vain, to 
find a name. or ,a meaning for what 
I saw. 



DROME

Science, science! This was the 
age of science, the age of the air- 
plane, the submarine, radium, tele- 
vision and radio; and yet here was 
a scene to make Science herself rub 
her eyes in amazement, a scene that 
might have been taken right out of 
some wild story or out of some myth 
of the ancient world. Well, that 
ancient world, too, had its science, 
some of which science, I fear 
(though this thought would have 
brought a pooh-pooh from Milton 
Rhodes) man has lost to his sorrow. 
And, like that ancient world, so per- 
haps had this strange underground 
world which we had entered — or, 
rather, were trying to enter. And 
perhaps of that science or some 
phases of it, this angel before us had 
fearful command. 

One moment I told myself that we 
should need all the courage we 
possessed, all the ingenuity and re- 
source of that science of which Mil- 
ton Rhodes himself was the master; 
the next, that I was letting my 
imagination overleap itself. 

My thoughts were suddenly bro- 
ken by the voice of Milton. 

* ‘ Goodness, Bill, look at her hand ! 
I forgot !” 

He stepped toward the angel and 
gently lifted her blood-dripping 
hand. The chain had sunk right in- 
to the soft wrist. The angel, how- 
ever, with a smile and a movement 
with her left hand, gave us to un- 
derstand that the hurt was nothing. 

The next moment she gave an ex- 
clamation and gazed past me down 
the pillared cavern. Instantly I 
turned, and, as I did so, I too ex- 
claimed. 

There, far off amongst the 
columns, two yellow, wrathful lights 
were gleaming, and dark hurrying 
figures were moving toward us. 



CHAPTER 22 
WHAT DID IT MEAN? 

"npHE help is coming, Bill,” said 

A Milton Rhodes. “And that re- 
minds me : I haven ’t reloaded my re- 
volver. ’ ’ 

“I would lose no time in doing 
so,” I told him. 

He got out the weapon and pro- 
ceeded to reload it. It was not. by 
the way, one of these new-fangled 
things but one of your good old- 
fashioned revolvers — solid, substan- 
tial, one that would stand hard us- 
age, a piece to be depended upon. 
And that was what we needed — 
weapons to be depended upon. 

The angel was watching Rhodes 
closely. I wondered if she knew 
what had killed her demon — knew, 
I mean that this metal thing, with its 
glitter so dull and so cold, was a 
weapon. It was extremely unlikely 
that she had, in that horrible mo- 
ment on the bridge, seen what 
actually had happened. However 
that might have been, it was soon 
plain that she recognized the revol- 
ver as a weapon — or, at any rate, 
guessed that it was. 

With an interjection, she stepped 
to Rhodes’ side, and, with swift 
pantomime, she assured us that there 
was nothing at all to apprehend 
from those advancing figures. 

“After all,” Milton said, slipping 
the revolver into his pocket, “why 
should we be so infernally sus- 
picious? Maybe this world is very 
different from our own.” 

“It seems to me,” I told him, my 
right hand in that pocket which con- 
tained my revolver, “that we have 
good cause to be suspicious. Have 
you forgotten what Grandfather 
Scranton saw up there at the 
Tamahnowis Rocks (and what he 
didn’t see) and the horrible death 
there of Rhoda Dillingham, to say 
nothing of what happened to us 
here a few minutes ago? That we 



216 



WEIRD TALES 



are not at the bottom of that chasm 
— well, I am not anxious to have an- 
other shave like that.” 

‘‘I have not forgotten, Bill. I 
have an idea, though, that those aw- 
ful tragedies up there were purely 
accidental. Certainly we know that 
the demon’s attack upon ourselves 
was entirely so.” 

‘‘Accidental? Great Scott, some 
consolation, that!” 

1 looked at Milton Rhodes, and I 
looked at the angel, who had taken 
a few steps forward and was await- 
ing those hurrying figures — a white- 
robed figure, still and tall, one love- 
ly, majestic. And, if I didn’t sigh, I 
certainly felt like doing so. 

‘‘No demon there, Bill,” observed 
Milton at last, his eyes upon those 
advancing forms. 

‘ ‘ I see none. Four figures. ’ ’ 
“Four,” nodded Rhodes. “Two 
men and two women.” 

A few moments, and they stepped 
out into a sort of aisle amongst the 
great limestone pillars. The figure 
in advance came to an abrupt halt. 
An exclamation broke from him and 
echoed and re-echoed eerily through 
the vast and gloomy cavern. It was 
answered by the angel, and, as her 
voice came murmuring back to us, 
it was as though fairies were hid- 
den amongst the columns and were 
answering her. 

But there was nothing fairylike 
in the aspect of that leader (who 
was advancing again) or his male 
companion. That aspect was grim, 
formidable. Each carried- a power- 
ful bow and had an arrow' fitted to 
the string, and at the left side a 
short, heavy sw'ord. That aspect of 
theirs underwent a remarkable 
metamorphosis, how'ever, as they 
came on toward us, w'hat with the 
explanations that our angel gave 
them. When they at last halted, a 
few yards from the spot where we 
stood, every sign of hostility had 
vanished. It was patent, how'ever, 



that they were wary, suspicious. 
That they should be so was not 
at all strange, but just the same 
there was something in their man- 
ner that I could not understand — 
something that made me resolve to 
be on my guard whatever might be- 
tide. 

The leader was a tall man, of 
sinewy and powerful frame. Though 
he had, I judged, passed the half- 
century mark, he had suffered, it 
seemed, no loss of youthful vitality 
or strength. His companion, tall 
and almost as powerful as himself, 
w'as a much younger man — in his 
early twenties. Their golden hair 
w'as bobbed, for all the w'orld like 
your truly bobbified flapper’s. The 
arms were bare, as w r ere the legs 
from midway the thigh to half-u'ay 
below the knee, the nether extrem- 
ities being incased in buskins, light 
but evidently of excellent material. 

As for the companions of the 
twain, one was a girl seventeen or 
eighteen years of age, the other a 
girl a couple of years older. Each 
had a bow' and quiver, as did our 
angel. The older of these young 
ladies had golden hair, a shade light- 
er than the angel’s, w'hilst the hair 
of the younger was white as snow'. 
At first I thought that it must be 
pow'dered, but this w r as not so. And 
as I gazed with interest and w'onder 
upon this lovely creature, I thought 
— of Christopher Columbus and Sir 
Isaac New'ton. At thirty, they had 
hair like hers. That thought, how'- 
ever, was a fleeting one. This w'as 
no time, forsooth, to be thinking of 
old Christopher and Sir Isaac. 
Stranger, more wonderful was this 
old w'orld of ours than even Colum- 
bus or Newton ever had dreamed it. 

The age of our angel, by the way, 
I placed at about twenty-five years. 
And I wondered how they could pos- 
sibly reckon time here in this under- 
ground world, a world that could 
have neither months nor years. 



DROME 



217 



The quartfct listened eagei'lv to 
the explanations given by our angel. 
Suddenly the leader addressed some 
question to Persephone, as Rhodes 
called her. And then we heard it ! 

“Drome,” was her answer. 

There it was, distinct, unmistak- 
able, that mysterious word which 
had given us so many strange and 
wild thoughts and visions. Yes, 
there it was; and it was an answer, 
I thought, that by no means put the 
man’s mind at ease. 

Drome ! Drome at last. But — 
W'hat did it mean? Drome! There, 
we distinctly heard the angel pro- 
nounce the word again. Drome ! If 
we could only have understood the 
words being spoken! But there was 
no mistaking, I thought, the manner 
of the angel. It was earliest, and 
yet, strangely enough, that Sibylline 
quality about her was now more pro- 
nounced than ever. But there was 
no mistaking her manner; she was 
endeavoring to reassure him, to al- 
lay, it seemed, some strange uneasi- 
ness or fear. I noticed, however, 
with some vague, sinister misgivings, 
that in this she was by no means as 
successful as she herself desired. 
Why did we see in the eyes of the 
leader, and in those of the others, 
so strange, so mysterious a look 
whenever those eyes were turned 
toward that spot where Milton 
Rhodes and I stood? 

However, these gloomy thoughts 
were suddenly broken, but certainly 
not banished. With an acquiescent 
reply — at any rate, so I thought it — 
to the angel, the leader abruptly 
faced us. He placed his bow and 
arrow upon the ground, slipped the 
quiver from his back, drew his 
sword— it was double-bladed. I now 
noted— from its scabbard and de- 
posited them, too, upon the ground. 
His companion was following suit, 
the two girls, who were now hold- 
ing the lights, standing by motion- 
less and silent. 



The men advanced a few paces. 
Each placed his sword hand over his 
heart, uttered something in meas- 
ured and sonorous tones and bowed 
low to us — a proceeding, I noted out 
of the corner of my eye, that not a 
little pleased our angel. 

CHAPTER 23 

THAT WE ONLY KNEW THE 
SECRET 

“VX7ell,” remarked Milton 
’ ’ Rhodes, his expression one 
of the utmost gravity, “when in 
Drome, Bill, do as the Dromans do.” 
And we returned the bow of the 
Hypogeans, w r hereupon the men 
stepped back to their weapons, 
which they at once resumed, and 
the young woman, without moving 
from the spot, inclined her head to 
us in a most stately fashion. Bow 
again from Rhodes and myself. 

This ceremony over — I hoped that 
we had done the thing handsomely 
— the angel turned to us and told 
us (in pantomime, of course) that 
we Avere now friends and that her 
heart was glad. 

“Friends!” said I to myself. 
“You are no gladder, madam, than 
I am; but all the same I am going 
to be on my guard.” 

The girls mo\ r ed to the angel and 
with touching tenderness examined 
her bleeding Avrist, which the young- 
er at once proceeded to bandage 
carefully. She had made to bathe 
the wound, but this the angel had 
not permitted — from Avhieh it Avas 
patent that there Avould be no access 
to water for some time yet. 

Our Amalthea and her companions 
now held an earnest consultation. 
Again AA r e heard her pronounce that 
word Drome. And again we saAv in 
the look and mien of the others 
doubt and uneasiness and something, 
I thought, besides. But this Avas 
for a feAV moments only. Either they 
acquiesced wholly in Avhat the angel 



218 



WEIRD TALES 



urged, or they mashed their feel- 
ings. 

I wished that I knew which it 
was. And yet had I known, I should 
have been none the wiser, forsooth — 
unless I had been cognizant of what 
it was that the angel was urging so 
earnestly and with such confidence. 
That it was something closely con- 
cerning ourselves was, of course, 
obvious. That it (or part of it) was 
to the effect that we should be tak- 
en to some place was, I believed, 
virtually certain. Not that this 
made matters a whit clearer or in 
any measure allayed my uneasiness. 
For where were we to be taken? 
And to what ? To Drome ? But 
what and where was this Drome? 
Was Drome a place, was it a thing, 
was it a human being, or what was 
it? 

Such were some of the thoughts 
that came to me as I stood there. 
But what good to wonder, to ques- 
tion, when there could be no answer 
forthcoming? Sooner or later the 
answer would be ours. And, in the 
meantime — well, more than sufficient 
unto the day was the mystery there- 
of. And, besides, hadn’t Rhodes 
and I come to find mysteries? As- 
suredly. And assuredly it was not 
likely that we would be disap- 
pointed. 

This grave matter, whatever it 
was, decided, the angel plunged in- 
to a detailed account of what had 
happened on the bridge. We thought 
that we followed her recital very 
closely, so expressive were her ges- 
tures. When she told how we had 
saved her from that frightful chasm, 
she was interrupted by exclama- 
tions, all eyes were turned upon us, 
and I felt certain in that moment 
that we were indeed friends. Still 
heaven only knew what awaited us. 
Tt was well, of course, to be san- 
guine ; but that did not mean that we 
should blink facts, however vague 
and mysterious those facts might be. 



There was a momentary pause. 
When she went on, I saw the angel’s 
lower lip begin to tremble and tears 
come into her eyes. She was de- 
scribing the death of her demon, her 
poor, poor demon. Well, as regards 
appearances, I must own that I 
would greatly prefer that hideous 
ape-bat of hers to many a bulldog 
that I have seen. The others, too, 
looked distressed. And, indeed, I 
have no doubt that we ourselves, 
had we known all about demons, 
would have been — well, at least 
troubled. Little did Milton and I 
dream that the loss of that winged 
monster might entail upon our lit- 
tle band the most serious conse- 
quences. So, however, it was, as we 
were soon to learn. 

When she had ended her account, 
the angel turned to us forthwith and 
went through an earnest and re- 
markable pantomime. She and the 
others awaited our answer with the 
most intense interest. But the only 
answer we could give her was that 
we did not understand. That panto- 
mime had been wholly unintelligible 
to Milton Rhodes and myself. I say 
wholly unintelligible; we could see, 
however, that it had something to 
do with ourselves and something to 
do with something up above; but 
everything else in it was an utter 
mystery. 

The angel went through it again, 
more slowly, moi’e carefully and 
more fully this time. But still we 
could not understand. 

“Perhaps,” I suggested, “she 
could tell us with paper and pencil. ” 

“Not a bad idea, Bill.” 

Thereat Rhodes produced pencil 
and notebook. These he gave to the 
angel, with a sign that she put it 
down in the book. She regarded the 
pencil curiously for some moments, 
tried it upon the paper, and then — 
with some difficulty and undoubted- 
ly some pain, what with her wound-

ed wrist— she began. Rhodes moved 
to her right side, I to her left. 

Yes, there could be no mistaking 
that:: she- had drawn the Tamahno- 
wis Rocks. Then she drew a crevasse 
and two figures, plainly. Rhodes and 
myself, going down into it. That 
was clear as the day. Then she.. put 
those figures that were Rhodes and 
I into the tunnel, and presto, with 
a wave of the hand, she brought 
them down to that very spot where 
we were standing. Clear again, 
lovely Sibyl. What next ? More 
figures, and more and more.; and 
were they too coming down the tun- 
nel? Yes, at^last it all was plain, at 
last we wise numskulls understood 
her. 

Were we alone ? 

Rhodes made it clear to her that 
we were. But he did not stop there ; 
he proceeded to make it clear to her 
that tee only knew the secret. She 
was some time in understanding 
this ; but when she did understand 
it, what a look was that which 
passed across her lovely Sibylline 
features! 

"Great heaven,” said I to myself, 
“lie’s gone and done it now!” 

The look was one of joy, the look 
of a soul triumphant. In a moment, 
however, it was gone; her features 
were only lovely, impassive. 

But the thoughts and the feelings 
which that strange look of hers had 
aroused were not gone. I felt a 
shudder pass to my heart. Of a 
truth, this woman was dreadful. 

I glanced at Rhodes; I thought 
that even he looked grave and 
troubled. Well, so I thought, might 
he.be! 

I said nothing, however, until the 
angel had rejoined her companions. 
Then: “There can be not the slight- 
est doubt that they look with great 
fear upon the coming of people from 
that world above, a world as mys- 
terious, I suppose, to them, as this 



subterranean world of theirs is to 
us. And, now that they know that 
they have the great secret also when 
they have you and me — well, Milton, 
old tillicum, .1 think it will indeed 
be strange if either of us ever again 
casts a shadow in the sun.” 

“It may be so, Bill,” he said 
soberly. “I did pot think of that 
when I told her. Still, who knows? 
Certainly not I. It is possible, in- 
deed probable, it seems to me, that 
We may do them, her, Bill, a harsh 
injustice. ’ ’ 

“I sincerely hope so.” 

That grave look left his face, and 
he smiled at .me, 

“And, besides, Billy me lad, 
maybe we won ’t ever want to re- 
turn to that world we have left — 
that world so full of ignorance, and 
yet so full of knowledge and science 
too; that world so cruel, and yet 
sometimes so strangely kind; that 
world so full of hate and mad pas- 
sion, and yet with ideals and aspira- 
tions so very noble and lofty. Yes, 
who knows, Bill? It is possible that 
we may not want to return.” 

Was it significant, or was it pui’ely 
casual? I could not decide. But 
Rhodes’ gaze was now on the angel. 
And, whilst I stood pondering, she 
turned and signed to us that they 
stood in readiness to proceed. 

She raised a hand and pointed 
down the cavern, . in some subtle 
manner making it clear that she was 
pointing to something far, very far 
away. 

“Drome!” she said. 

“Drome,” nodded Milton Rhodes. 

He turned to me. 

“Ready, Bill?” 

“Ready,” I told him. 

And so we started. 



Next month’s chapters describe a veritable 
Dante’s Inferno, as the Dromans and Rhodes and 
Carter penetrate through weirdly flickering phos- 
phorescent lights into a region of strange and ter- 
rible monsters, which attack them.

P AUL DUPUY, Frenchman and 
patriot, more Yankee than the 
native-born, since he took out 
naturalization papers, wears the Brit- 
ish flag in his buttonhole on Inde- 
pendence Day. 

A story hangs upon this, the story 
of a dead hero to whom the presence 
of Paul became an outrage and abomi- 
nation. And it was Brodsky who 
saved Paul from his post-mortem 
vengeance. 

The psychical investigations of 
Dr. Ivan Brodsky, and the marvel- 
ous results which he had obtained in 
his warfare against the hosts of evil, 
some of which I have previously re- 
counted, had by this time made him 
known to a large circle of those to 
whom such things as spiritual pos- 
session are facts rather than theories. 
In hospitals, in prisons, wherever we 
find pain and sin congregated, occult 
manifestations are a commonplace of

existence, though fear of ridicule de- 
bars the inmates from making any 
mention of them. It was in such in- 
stitutions that Brodsky’s reputation 
spread broadcast. But there are 
prisons for the dead as well as the 
living, as I shall show. 

Neither Brodsky nor I was greatly 
surprized when a visitor entered his 
study one evening and implored his 
aid in the unraveling of a mystery 
which had, he was convinced, a super- 
natural explanation. “At least, I 
can’t help thinking so myself, sir,” 
said the man, speaking fluently, but 
with a slight foreign accent. “Al- 
though I am not a believer in such 
things myself. ’ ’ 

Brodsky ’s brows clouded ; that was 
the stock phrase that he detested. 

“If you do not Believe in such 
things, how dare you make the sug- 
gestion that they exist?” he cried. 
“Be honest with yourself and with 
me, man, or go elsewhere. Do you 
believe in them or do you not?”

“Yes, sir, I do,” replied our vis- 
itor. “But when one makes such an 
admission one is ridiculed — it ’s 

hard ’ ’ 

‘ ‘ Humph ! ’ ’ grunted the doctor. 
“Go ahead with your story.” 

The visitor sat down and fingered 
his hat nervously. He was apparent- 
ly a man of the laboring class, to 
judge from his appearance; yet he 
showed signs of intelligence superior 
to that of most of his kind. I could 
account for his mental disturbance 
only when he had finished his story. 

“I’m a Frenchman by birth, sir,” 
he began, “and I've been seven years 
in this country. Dupuy is my name. 
I’m a naturalized citizen and proud 
of my adopted country. I learned 
my trade in Paris ; it ’s a queer trade, 
and there’s not many throughout 
the whole world follows it, so that it 
pays well, especially as it requires a 
certain amount of artistic ability, 
though less than you would suppose. 
I am a maker of wax figures for the 
waxworks theater on Fifth Street. 
You may not know the place, gentle- 
men, for people seem somehow to 
have lost interest in that form of en- 
tertain ment, though it used to be the 
craz° i ■ i vears gone by. My task is to 
model life-size wax figures of all peo- 
ple of ifrominence. We’ve got the fa- 
mous murderers, of course, and the 
presidents, and the heroes of the revo- 
lution, and all the famous kings and 
queens of England, the great soldiers 
and sailors — Wellington, Napoleon, 
Nelson ” 

“ Fan gh ! ”, said the doctor. ‘ ‘ Let 
the dead rest in their graves. Don’t 
you know that every time you set up 
an image of the dead you form a 
focus in which all that remains of his 
personality on earth concentrates? 
That commandment against making 
replicas of life in stone — which w r ould 
have included wax, my friend, had 
w r ax figures been known — was the 
wisest and most spiritual of all. Go 



“Well, sir,” said our visitor, “as I 
told you, I’m constantly at work 
fashioning these figures for Mr. Mar- 
gotson, the proprietor. We didn’t 
have any of naval officors up to a few 
w r eeks ago. But Mr. Margotson is al- 
ways looking out for something new, 
so he says to me, ‘Dupuy, let’s have 
a few' statues of naval officers of his- 
torv. Do you remember any?’ 

“‘Sure!’ said I. ‘There’s Ville- 
neuve and St. Page and ’ 

“ ‘Quit, talking French, ’ said Mr. 
Margotson. ‘What about John Paul 
Jones and Nelson?’ 

“So I set to work and made repli- 
cas of them. The one of Jones was 
fair, but the Nelson statue was first- 
rate, I did it all from his portraits, 
and there he stands in the gallery 
with one arm and one eye, and ev- 
erybody who comes in recognizes him 
at once. And that brings me to the 
point. ’ ’ 

“Ah, you’ve had trouble with 
Nelson?” cried Brodsky. 

“Mon Dku!’’ said Dupuy, lapsing 
into his native tongue as he wiped his 
forehead; “he’s trying to murder 
me.” 

The man broke off and eyed us fur- 
tively. I had long learned to keep 
guard over my face, but incredulity 
was in my heart. As for the doctor, 
he said nothing, and the man con- 
tinued : 

“It must have been a w r eek ago 
that the first thing happened. I was 
adjusting the scabbard of his sword 
— we use real swords in our scab- 
bards — and the point flew through 
and went right into my wrist — just 
missed a large artery. Look ! ’ ’ 

He held his hand up for our in- 
spection. There was a ragged cut, 
half healed, along the base of the 
hand. 

“And I’ll swear that the figure 
pushed the sword through the scab- 
bard — pushed it violently, for it cut 
clear through the leather. But I 
didn ’t catch on just then. Then, four 



222 



WEIRD TALES 



days afterward, as I was passing it, 
the thing flew from its pedestal and 
keeled me over. My head just missed 
the iron radiator by two inches. And 
I tell you it didn’t fall, it fairly 
threw itself at me. ’ ’ 

“What does Mr. Margotson say to 
that?’’ asked Brodsky. 

“He laughs at me. I don’t know 
what to do.. I ’ve half a mind to melt 
it and let Margotson discharge me; 
and yet I have my wife to think of, 
and there’s no demand for such men 
as me, the business having fallen off 
so. And if I stay there, one day the 
thing will kill me.” 

“Enough,” said Brodsky. “We’ll 
go there at once. Can we get in?” 

“I have the key,” answered the 
Frenchman, putting on his hat. 

'\X7e three left the house together. 

* ’ We caught a car on the main 
road, which ran past us one block 
away, and, half an hour later, 
stepped out at the entrance to the 
waxworks theater, which stood in 
what was now the heart of the busi- 
ness section of the city, and was, in 
consequence, almost completely de- 
serted at this hour of the evening. 
Our companion pulled out a key and 
opened a side door. We went up to 
a great hall, round which were 
ranged statues of celebrities, life-size 
figures of strikingly human aspect. 

“And yet,” mused Brodsky, stop- 
ping to regard a group of cleverly 
arranged heroes of our civil war, 
“the men who erect these think they 
have nothing more than the external 
shells. How ignorant they are of the 
psychic qualities of their actions ! In- 
deed, what da they dream of any- 
thing beyond the material? Yet this 
gallery is almost a breeding ground 
of souls. Who can measure what in- 
fluences such beings draw down to 
them? Well, at least no evil spirit 
would be attracted hither among 
these men who offered up their lives 
for their country!” 



Dupuy led the way toward an end 
of the great hall. Here I saw a 
group of figures attired in Georgian 
dress ; evidently Nelson would be 
found among these. One of them, 
however, seemed singularly incongru- 
ous and out of place. It was a short, 
thick-set man in the costume of a 
mechanic of today. It seemed to 
move; I started; then I discovered 
that it was a living man. 

“Mr. Margotson!” cried Dupuy in 
confusion. 

But the proprietor seemed still 
more confused than his assistant. He 
came forward sheepishly, and a mask 
seemed to have descended upon his 
blank face and blotted out some 
curious emotions which I had thought 
that I read there. 

“Mr. Margotson — these are two 
gentlemen who are interested in what 
I told you about the statue,” Dupuy 
stammered. 

Margotson ’s face grew black with 
rage. 

“Newspaper writers, eh?” he 
shouted. 4 4 Come to write up my 
museum, I suppose! I don’t want 
your advertising ; I ’ve got all the cus- 
tomers I want and you can’t do me 
no good. Damn your curiosity; this 
fool’s been telling you some of his 
silly yarns about the Nelson statue, 
I suppose ! ’ ’ 

This rage appeared so abnormal 
that my medical training induced me 
to examine Margotson from the 
pathological standpoint. But Brod- 
sky looked into his face steadily and 
land his hand upon his shoulder. 
Margotson ’s anger seemed suddenly 
to evaporate. 

“They’re only interested in the 
statue’s turning into flesh and blood, 
sir,” said the Frenchman. 

Unluckily these words brought 
about a return of Margotson ’s frenzy. 

“Flesh and blood? Rubbish!” he 
shouted. ‘ 'Arrant nonsense, that’s 
what you’re talking, Dupuy. What’s 
the matter with the statue? It’s a 



THE FETISH OF THE WAXWORKS

very good statue, one of the best 
you’ve made. It’s new wax — green 
wax, we call it in the trade — and it 
ought to have had time to mature, 
only the public were so crazed over 
the naval officers that I didn’t have 
time to let it lie. That’s why it’s 
hardening — because of the fumes 
from the leather factory across the 
street. They drift in here something 
terrible. That’s all that’s the matter 
with it. Look!” 

He switched on an electric light 
upon the wall behind him, and for 
the first time I saw clearly the face 
of the great English hero. There 
were the irregular, thin, homely fea- 
tures, lit by a flame of patriotic en- 
thusiasm. Yet, admirably as the 
artist had caught the inspiration of 
the painting from which he modeled 
it, there seemed something more, 
some hardly defined vein of cruelty, 
of caprice, that actually gave the 
face the property of seeming to re- 
flect a certain change of emotions, an 
instability of mind as though the 
thing possessed some conscious life. 
And the skin — surely that was the 
skin of a man, with the blood 
mantling in the flesh beneath. Du- 
puy started back with a wild cry. 

‘‘Look at him! Look! I swear I 
never put that smile upon his face,” 
he screamed. ‘‘He’s changing. He’s 
changing, I tell you. Lord preserve 
us all ! Get rid of it, Mr. Margot- 
son. ’ ’ 

“If you hand me out any more of 
that nonsense I’ll fire you on the 
spot,” shouted the enraged propri- 
etor. “You’re going daffy, Dupuy, 
that’s what’s the matter with you. 
He’s always had that smile. Exam- 
ine the wax, gentlemen; it’s hard- 
ened, that’s all.” 

With horror and repulsion I laid 
my finger on the smooth surface of 
the cheek. So lifelike did it appear 
that I could have sworn the blood 
faded out of the arterioles beneath 
the pressure, blanching the surface 



of the skin.. And yet it was of wax. 
It was not flesh and blood. But flesh 
and blood differed less from it than 
it differed from the unreal and waxen 
figures around it. It stooped half for- 
ward, it seemed instinct with slowly 
dawning vitality. And surely its ex- 
pression had changed; it had not 
smiled thus, with the cold malevo- 
lence of a conqueror, when first I had 
seen it. 

Then suddenly Margotson seemed 
transformed. As though he adapted 
his mood to suit his mind, he burst 
into a wild peal of laughter. 

“Good old Nelson!” he shouted; 
and the sounds echoed from the roof 
and rang through the hall, while for 
one dreadful moment I could have 
sworn that an answering emotion 
flitted across that waxen face. ‘ ‘ Good 
boy, Nelson! A miracle of art, Du- 
puy. I can’t tear myself away from 
watching him. I’ll raise your sal- 
ary. He makes me feel so good. He 
wants me to do something for him 
and I’ll find out what it is and do 
it.” 

“You’ve given him a body and 
he ’s getting your reason, my friend, ’ ’ 
said Brodsky, somewhat shaken by 
this unexpected outburst. 

“Come away, come away, gentle- 
men,” cried the Frenchman, pulling 
us by the arms. “He’s mad, God 
help him. I should have told you 
he’d been acting queer, but last 
night, when he laughed at me so 
much, . I thought that it was only 
overwork. He ’s as mad as a loon. ’ ’ 

We did not need to be urged, nor 
was there necessity of excuses. Mar- 
gotson had already forgotten us and 
was standing before the statue alter- 
nately capering and grimacing. 

“Now, I’ll give you my advice and 
shortly; you can follow it or not at 
your peril,” said Brodsky. “Get 
your employer home in safety and 
then slip back and chop the thing 
to pieces before a tragedy super- 
venes. No, that’s all I’ve got to say

to you except just this: give up your 
;rade and learn something that won’t 
>ring you into conflict with all these 
vital forces that hang round such 
daces. ’ ’ 

And with these words he fairly 
turled himself out of the place, leav- 
ing me to follow him as best I could. 

T think I mentioned once how 
*• sensitive the doctor always was to 
i he morbid things of life. Perhaps it 
was a certain sensibility to those in- 
visible influences which accompany 
noods and invest those places where 
any violent emotions have been at 
play. At any rate, having seen so 
nuch of the darker side of life, Brod- 
ky was strenuously insistent upon 
cleanliness and wholesomeness. 

“We’ve got to leave such tilings 
done and work in the sun,” he used 
o say. “This is our working day; 
when the night comes at last, may our 
good deeds be our protective armor 
igainst all the host of devils on the 
night shores that we shall pass 
i hrough.” 

“You believe we have to pass 
< hrough some place of purgation?” I 
asked. 

“We’ll have to clean up some- 
how, in this life or the next,” he 
answered. “We can’t get into heav- 
en with dirty fingernails.” 

So, on this occasion, I forebore to 
question him when we got home. 
Brodsky went to a closet where he 
kept many relics of his earlier life, 
md came out with a small Union 
Jack upon a moldering staff. 

“The flag of the vessel that bore 
me from Poland, where the Czar’s 
‘missaries were seeking my life,” he 
aid sadly. “To what better use can 
it be put?” 

Then he explained the mystery. 

“It is a fetish,” he said, filling his 
■tipe and puffing at it slowly. “It 
is exactly similar, in every particu- 
lar, to the idols of the West Africans 
—or, for that matter, to any idol. The 



savage makes some dreadful idol to 
worship, sacrifices to it until the 
thing becomes instinct with life and 
filled with all the passions of the 
worshipers; then a devil has been 
called into existence whose evil in- 
fluence is incalculable. I tell you, it 
was no mythical devil that the early 
Christian missionaries had to face, 
nor those of today. 

“After death the pure spirit flies 
to its appointed resting place, leaving 
its two bodies moldering behind it. 
One is that earthly body that we all 
know; the other is the soul body, the 
body of desires, a semi-conscious 
force that survives for months or 
years, according to the condition of 
the dead being. 

“Do not mistake me; this is not 
Nelson. That great admiral is un- 
conscious of this replica of him there 
in the waxworks theater. It is a 
group of emotions such as possessed 
Nelson, a man of strong feelings, yet 
not necessarily his. The warm en- 
thusiasm of the crowds that have vis- 
ited that place have focused these 
emotions, much as the burning glass 
focuses the rays of the sun. Remem- 
ber, as yet this creature is only half 
conscious. It vaguely, as in a dream, 
feels this life within itself; it is ris- 
ing toward a conscious existence. 
And that fool Margotson is the tool 
by which it means to wreak its en- 
mity upon Dupuy.” 

“But why does it hate the French- 
man so much ? ” I asked. 

“Do you not recollect Nelson’s 
motto ? ’ ’ the doctor asked : “ ‘ Hate a 
Frenchman as you would the devil?’ 
This elemental being that has attract- 
ed these emotions that made up the 
great admiral’s soul-body has neces- 
sarily the identical feeling. What 
does it know of the time that has 
elapsed, or the changes of history? 
Th.ere is the Frenchman, and it will 
have his life — by itself, if possible. 
If it can not kill him, as it tried, it 
will certainly do so th rough Margot-

son. Well, it’s none of ray business,” 
he added. ‘ ‘ I ’ve warned Dupuy. ! ’ 

And he went to bed, while I forgot 
to ask the .purpose of the Union Jack, 
which I saw him stuff into his pocket. 
But I knew that Brodsky could not 
dismiss his own responsibility so eas- 
ily. He did not undress, for from 
my room, which adjoined his own, I 
heard him pacing the floor with short, 
quick footsteps, the greater portion 
of the night.. 

I fell asleep at last, and had hard- 
ly closed my eyes two minutes, as it 
seemed, before I heard the front door- 
bell jangled violently- I started up 
in bed, filled with horrible presenti- 
ments of evil, and began to dress 
myself hurriedly. A few moments 
later Brodsky tapped loudly upon 
my door." 

“Dress yourself as quickly as you 
can,” he called. “There’s work on 
foot for both of us before the morn- 
ing.” 

As I hurried on my clothes I heard 
an agitated voice in the sitting room 
outside, which I had little difficulty 
in recognizing as that of the assist- 
ant at the waxworks theater.. My 
judgment was correct; when I 
emerged I found him seated in a 
chair in a condition of collapse, 
and Brodsky standing over him, hold- 
ing a glass of some stimulant to his 
lips. The doctor was fully dressed,' 
even to his hat, and from his pocket- 
there protruded a small corner of the 
British flag. We went out together 
without, any explanations. Luckily 
the cars ran at intervals, and we 
reached the corner of the main street. 
We clambered in; it was empty, and,- 
during the ride, I learned in broken 
ejaculations from the man the cause 
of Iiis visit. 

He had halted irresolutely at the 
entrance to the waxworks theater 
after we left him. Then he retraced- 
his steps, determined to carry out the 
doctor’s instructions as soon as he 
could get Margotson away. He saw 



his employer standing before the 
statue, regarding- it silently, . as 
though in a trance. Dupuy crept up 
to him, passing the statue of necessity 
upon the opposite side. And then he 
realized that Margotson had drawn 
the sword from the scabbard of the 
admiral and stood in such an attitude 
that Dupuy could neither advance 
nor retreat. 

At the same time he experienced a 
return of that deathly faintness that 
had possessed him on a previous oc- 
casion, as he described to us. As in 
a trance he saw Margotson advance 
stealthily toward him, while he re- 
mained incapable of resistance; then 
he recovered his senses and leaned 
aside as Margotson thrust. Running 
like the wind, he gained the street 
outside, and had presence of mind 
enough to lock the door behind him. 

“But I don’t come in,” he insist- 
ed, as we gained the side door. “No, 
sir, I’ve seen enough for tonight. I 
don’t go in.” 

It took all Brodsky’s resolution to 
persuade Dupuy to come. Without 
his presence, the doctor said, he 
•would be powerless. With him, he 
might still break this spell and bring 
back Margotson to sanity. And at 
last, very timidly, Dupuy crept in 
behind the doctor. As Brodsky un- 
locked the door the key fell from 
his fingers. 

“The key! You must find it,” he 
cried to me. “Under no circum- 
stances may you follow us without it. 
To do so may be fatal. Remember!” 
And before I had. time to answer I 
saw him spring lightly up the stair- 
way, dragging the unwilling French- 
man with him. My immediate im- 
pulse was to dash after him; then 
discipline came to my aid and — I 
stooped for the key. The night was 
dark, and it was two minutes before 
I found it. Then suddenly, from 
within, I heard wild shouts and a 
stampede. . 



226 



WEIRD TALES 



I sprang up the stairs and along 
the hall, running with sobbing breath 
and clenched fists till I gained the 
end, where I saw shadows hovering. 
Frantically I switched on an electric 
light. Then I perceived Margotson, 
his face aflame like a madman’s, 
thrusting at Brodsky with the ad- 
miral’s sword while the doctor par- 
ried him with admirable grace and 
ease. Dupuy came running up to me. 

“He rushed at me,’’ he cried, 
“with his sword drawn, and Dr. Brod- 
sky snatched a sword from Paul 
Jones’ replica and met him. Look! 
The doctor wins!” 

Like every Polish gentleman, Brod- 
sky was an adept with the foils. Cer- 
tainly a clumsy mechanic such as 
Margotson could not have expected 
to overcome him. Yet, as I watched 
the tense interchange of sword-play, 
I was amazed at the skill shown by 
Margotson. It seemed as though the 
courage and prowess of the great ad- 
miral had descended upon him. 
Twice he lunged so fiercely that the 
point grazed Brodsky's arm; then, 
with a sudden twist, he sent the 
weapon flying from the doctor’s 
hand, and rushed — not at him, but 
straight toward Dupuy. So swift 
was the impetus, he was upon us be- 
fore we could stir. And then, just 
as the blade seemed about to pierce 
the Frenchman’s heart, something 
came fluttering downwai'd over his 
head and the sword fell from Mar- 
gotson ’s hand and he stood still, his 
eyes fixed upon vacancy, his body 
immobile, while Dupuy released him- 
self from the folds of the union jack 
that Brodsky had so admirably 
thrown over him. 



“ \ nd — you think I can go back to 
my job ? ’ ’ asked Dupuy the 
next morning. 

“By all means,” answered the 
doctor. “Margotson will remember 
nothing whatever of his insanity. So 
you’d better hurry up, or he will 
want to know why you are late. You 
need not fear the statue. • It w r ill have 
resumed its natural aspect, and, in 
case any remnants of its power re- 
main, keep a small British flag in 
your buttonhole, especially on holi- 
days such as Independence Day. Yes, 
that’s your penalty, Dupuy, patriot 
as you say you are; the only alter- 
native being the destruction of the 
statue, which Margotson won’t al- 
low. And, when you can, try to get 
another occupation. 

“It was a desperate chance,” con- 
fided Brodsky to me afterward. 
“Still, one can deal with these ele- 
mental forces much as the lunatics; 
the mad impulse of national hatred 
was shattered instantly when it per- 
ceived the flag of its country. When 
Margotson wakes up upon the floor 
of the gallery he will think that he 
got drunk tire night before.” 

“But tell me,” I cried suddenly, 
“why did you make me wait till I 
found the key?” Then the solution 
came to me. “You knew our lives 
were in danger and wished to save me 
from the possibility of injury,” I 
cried. 

“Pshaw!” muttered the doctor. 
“Just accept facts and don’t put 
sentimental interpretations upon 
them.”

* N ; 'n'l! 



I THREW a piece of string into 
the grate, where presently it be- 
gan to smolder. 

Kobyssu stopped talking and 
sniffed. Although in appearance he 
is ferocious, with his little simian 
forehead, his black bushes of eye- 
brows, and his big, bristling mus- 
tache, he is in reality a fellow of 
most pleasant, even temperament. 
But it was plain that the string had 
disturbed him greatly. His cheek 
had paled, and I got a glimpse of his 
eyes as he bent forward swiftly in his 
chair and leveled them at the hearth. 
The expression in them was twofold. 
There was deep anger; there was 
equally deep horror. 

He saw the string, snatched at it, 
and cast it into the heart of the fire, 
so that it flamed instantly. 

“Pouf!” he said, waving his 
hands in front of his nose, and now 
exceedingly white. 



I was amazed, but. all I said was: 
“Sorry, I didn’t think the smell 
would worry you.” 

Kobyssu looked round his cafe, de- 
serted at this hour of the afternoon. 
He looked at the neat tables, at the 
walls, at his desk, rather with the air 
of a man who wished to assure him- 
self that he was indeed in Wardour 
Street, London, and nowhere else. 
Then he faced the fire again, his 
eyes more normal but very somber. 

“That smell of slow-burning hemp 
— it reminded me of something in 
Czergona. ’ ’ 

“But,” said I, “you often tell me 
that every memory of your native 
country is dear to you. Only yester-

country may be merely what your 
newspapers say, ‘a barren mountain 
range in mid-Europe,’ but I love ev- 
ery memory of it — except one. That 
is a memory of dreadful things. ’ ’ 

There was a table with coffee be- 
tween our chairs. He filled my cup. 

“From any country, however 
great and refined, one may get a 
memory of dreadful things, ’ ’ he said, 
defending Czergona. 

I nodded. 

“Yet these were strangely dread- 
ful.’’ He drew in his breath with a 
long hiss, staring broodingly at the 
sugar-bowl. “The odor of that 
string recalled to me the church stove 
at Raebrudafisk — so suddenly, so 
without warning, that I believed I 
was back in the past, and I felt the 
feelings of twelve years ago. Ah-h, 
I had, a shock. ’ ’ 

“What about this stove? But par- 
don, Kobyssu ; perhaps it would pain 
you to tell me? Perhaps the matter 
is personal?” 

He shook his head. 

“I was not directly concerned, I 
am thankful to say. But the story is 
too fearful a thing to relate idly over 
coffee. And you would be sorry if I 
put it in your mind. You would 
strive to forget it, and never forget 
it — no, no, I do not want to tell it.” 

But my curiosity had risen high. I 
urged Kobyssu and he yielded. 

I am punished. I wish I had not 
heard a word of the tale of the church 
stove at Raebrudafisk, which Kobyssu 
narrated in the fluent English that he 
has acquired so praiseworthily dur- 
ing recent years. 

“ 0 aebrudafisk,” he said, “is the 
village I was born in. It is on 
a hillside, in a fir wood. The church, 
which is of stone, is a quarter of a 
mile from it, up the hill. When, as 
a little boy, I was taken to church by 
my parents, the stove used to inter- 
est me very much. It was not far 
from where we sat, near the north 



wall. It was an upright iron cylinder, 
about three feet high and two feet 
in diameter, having a flat top, with a 
flap at the edge of this, which opened 
so that coal and wood could be poured 
in. A stout pipe went from the stove 
right up to" the roof and through it. 

“In summer, of course, the stove 
was not lit. In winter it was attend- 
ed to by old Uflio Vaang. He would 
start the fire some two hours before 
the morning service — and why the 
stove interested me was this: by the 
time I entered the church the flat top 
would be a glowing red, with dazzling- 
sparks appearing suddenly on it 
when specks of stuff fell there from 
the ceiling ; and the pipe would be red, 
half-w r ay to the roof, brilliant red at 
the base, duller the higher you looked 
— yet hot, you can imagine. 

“I was extremely fond of that 
stove, especially at evening service, 
when snow and darkness and wolves 
were outside the church. I yearned 
to spend the night by it, and thought 
pastor and people would be much 
more sensible to do so instead of far- 
ing down the hill, all in a bunch for 
fear of the wolves. 

“And I was a young rascal! I got 
into the habit of flicking bits of string 
on to the stove, to see them smoke and 
burst into flame. But a thrashing 
from my father and another from 
the pastor cured me of that. 

“There was a good draft to that 
stove — it had some bars low down in 
front. And old Uflio, though every- 
body warned him not to, drenched 
the fuel with oil before lighting it. 
Stove and pipe were red long before 
church -time. ’ ’ 

Kobyssu drank some coffee, and 
made a considerable pause. I knew 
he w-as hoping that some customer 
would arrive and give him a pretext 
for breaking off altogether. None 
came, however, so he shrugged his 
shoulders and proceeded. 

“Old Uflio Vaang was wonderful. 
He was completely blind. He had 



THE CHURCH STOVE 



229 



been blind since early manhood. 
With no difficulty he would find his 
own way to the church, place his 
hand on anything he required, and 
set the stove going. Dangerous work 
for a blind man, you will think, eh? 
Yet he was known to be so careful 
that, despite the matter of oil, peo- 
ple did not fear an accident. Uflio ’s 
perception was uncanny. I have 
noticed the stove fail a trifle toward 
the end of morning service, the top 
go from yellow-scarlet to crimson ; 
and Uflio, sensing the change, has 
risen from his chair and tiptoed down 
the church, and picked up a small 
tongs and opened the flap, gripping 
it at the first attempt; and, lump by 
lump, not to make a loud noise, he 
has dropped coal into the red-hot 
thing, .running no more peril of burn- 
ing himself than would a man with 
two healthy eyes. 

“Well, twelve years ago, when I 
was a swineherd of twenty, and had 
not commenced to think of London 
or even of Warsaw, old Uflio was still 
tending the stove. Naturally, I had 
lost my boyish interest in it. I never 
supposed that I should be interested 
in it again. ’ ’ 

Kobyssu paused once more. When 
he resumed, such a note of sadness 
was in his voice that I experienced a 
chill — a dread, and the first of my 
regrets at having importuned him 
for the story. I had not reckoned on 
a tragedy to a young girl, which I 
perceived looming. 

“Uflio Vaang had a daughter,” 
said he; “Djira. She was sixteen, 
pretty, bright-natured — oh, delight- 
ful. She was the old man’s only 
child, and, as-his wife was dead, all in 
the world he had to care for. I was 
not in love with Djira. I w'as think- 
ing of a girl in the next village. But 
the other young men of Raebrudafisk 
were in love with her, as, unhappily, 
was a man not young. That was Oik 
Sturl, whose age was forty, and who 
was often in prison for stealing or 



violence. He was a sullen blackguard 
ordinarily; when enraged he was the 
e vilest of brutes. 

“Of course, his chance to win 
Djira, the sweet, fresh bud, was hope- 
less. But I suppose he did not be- 
lieve this until he waylaid her one 
afternoon far from our village. Then 
she must have convinced him. Would 
she had not, poor child! poor little 
innocent! The truth infuriated him. 
He cut her throat' — there and then.” 

“Kobyssu!” 

“He did — there and then,” said 
Kobyssu, the deep anger in his eyes 
again, and his teeth glinting under 
his mustache. He clenched his fist, 
and shook it at the floor. “He did,” 
he repeated, ‘ ‘ and he did more. That 
the scent of much blood might bring 
the wolves, who would hide his crime, 
he stabbed, he hacked her little pure 
body — ah-h!” Kobyssu blew out his 
breath and drummed his fingers 
agitatedly on his knees. 

So this was what the stove, that 
Djira ’s father tended, reminded 
Kobyssu of. As it was fact, not fic- 
tion, I did not want to hear anything 
further. And yet I felt I must know 
what happened to the villain Sturl. 
I said so, and added in dismay : 
“Kobyssu! you don’t have capital 
punishment in Czergona, do you!” 

“No,” he answered, with a pecu- 
liar inflection of his voice. “The 
wolves did not get Djira,” he went 
on. “We young men of Raebrudafisk 
reached her first. For a boy saw what 
Sturl did and ran to tell us. He ran 
for his life, since Sturl had caught 
sight of him and was chasing him. 
Sturl could not overtake him, and 
turned in another direction when he 
perceived the lad would gain the vil- 
lage. 

“Yes, we went to Djira; and then 
we and the men of the whole country- 
side sought Sturl. Many among us 
vowed to slay him when we came up- 
on him, but the pastor and School- 
master Wiec, who was the magistrate 



230 



WEIRD TALES 



of the district, sternly forbade this. 

“For over two weeks, in wild 
weather of sleet and bitter winds, we 
hunted vainly, scouring woods, climb- 
ing to the niches in the mountain- 
tops, and even searching our coal 
mine, to which we thought the pierc- 
ing cold might have driven Sturl. We 
wondered how he obtained food, and 
at every step we took amid the trees 
or up the rocks we expected to dis- 
cover him dead from exposure. 

“You can conceive and pity Uflio 
this while. I consider that his lot 
was worse than Djira’s. She, the one 
earthly gladness of his blind life ; she, 
the bright, the gentle, whose lips and 
hands caressed him so lovingly, whose 
greeting woke him in the morning, 
whose voice told him the hues of the 
sky and the promise of the garden; 
she — held by a foul hand, and 
slaughtered ! That is what he had to 
think of. Small wonder that for days 
the torment made him almost insane, 
and that our womenfolk could give 
him no consolation. 

“The Sunday after the murder he 
did not go to the church, being too 
ill and weak. On the following 
Thursday, however, when there was 
an evening service, he took up his 
routine, and the stove was glowing 
when we entered the church. It was 
sad indeed to look at Uflio, in his 
usual seat, but bent and tremulous, 
with his cheeks so sunken and ghast- 
ly that he was scarcely to be recog- 
nized. Perhaps it was saddest to 
notice the coal smear's and a tiny 
gleam of oil on his hands when he 
raised them. Little Djira had al- 
ways been most careful to wipe them 
for him ere service began. 

“As I said, for over two weeks we 
searched for Sturl ; and we 
found not a trace of him. Then, at 
dawn one morning, our village was 
roused by a new alarm. The village 
of Phvamu, four miles away, where 
they find and store oil. was on fire. 



Schoolmaster Wioe wanted every 
man of us to hurry across and aid the 
Phvamu people. I had broken my 
arm two days previously — seeking 
Sturl. To witness the blaze, howev- 
er, I set out with the rest. My chirm, 
Vavik Rista, I, and a dozen others, 
took a path which went by the 
church. Although it rose steeply we 
began to cover it at a trot. We had 
gone a hundred yards past the church 
when a man, his clothes fluttering in 
rags, sprang out into the way in 
front of us, sprang as if from his 
sleep; and, trying to run before 
either of his feet was well back on 
the ground, he seemed to wrench one, 
and fell. 

“He was Sturl. Vavik and sevei'al 
more, darting forward instantly, 
reached him as he came to his knees, 
and held him! 

“ ‘Lend me a knife,’ said Vavik, 
whom Djira had shown many indica- 
tions of loving. 

“But two or three cried, ‘No, no: 
what will the pastor and School- 
master Wiee say?’ 

“Yet there were others who agreed 
with Vavik, and it was a long time 
before we could quiet them. 

“ ‘And all this while Phyamu is 
burning, and we are needed!’ cried 
someone. He pointed to the thin, 
strong ropes many were carrying to 
the scene of the fire. ‘Tie the beast 
to a tree until we come back. ’ 

“ ‘Wolves,’ objected someone else. 

“ ‘So much the better!’ shouted 
Vavik. 

“But a voice suggested leaving 
Sturl in the church, and thither we 
dragged him. 

“We bound him, meaning to let 
him lie on the floor. Seeing him 
gnash with his teeth at the ropes 
about him, and knowing him to be so 
supple that he might stretch to, and 
gnaw through, some, we gagged him 
very firmly; so that, though he was 
raging at us, the sounds he made 
were but as the hiss of the wind 



THE CHURCH STOVE

about the church. Then he. began to 
roll and to knock his head against 
the floor. 

“ ‘We must make him fast to 
something, ’ said one of us. 

“We stared around the church. 
There were no pillars, there seemed 
nothing to lash Sturl to. And then 
Hrok Nalti, the chairmaker, pointed 
to the stove. 

“ ‘Stand him on that. Tie him 
to the pipe.’ 

“We did so, fetching a ladder and 
a high bench from the vestry. We 
pressed Sturl against the pipe and 
bound. him tightly to it; and, in a 
hard spirit, for which w'e might be 
forgiven, we bound him more, than 
was necessary. We swathed and 
swathed him with rope until nearly 
all was used. With the last length, 
since he made an attempt to' beat his 
head against the pipe, we bound that 
also, passing the rope thrice across 
his brow and round the pipe, thus 
forcing the back of his skull immov- 
ably against the iron. 

“Then we hastened to Phyamu. 

“You will have observed that I 
have said ‘we’ in all this. It is right 
that I should, as I was of the party. 
But the work w y as not the sort for a 
man with a fractured arm, so that 
throughout I was an onlooker. Justi- 
fiably or not, I find relief in the 
knowledge of this. 

“We hastened, I said, to Phyamu. 

“Keeping together, for no particu- 
lar reason except that we arrived to- 
gether late, and telling none that we 
had captured Sturl, because we were 
jeered at for our tardiness, we start- 
ed to roll casks of oil into safety. I 
helped wdth one hand, and time was 
passing, when suddenly Hrok 
straightened his back and flung out 
his arms stiffly, uttering a queer, 
gurgling groan. 

“ ‘It is Sunday morning ! ’ he said. 

“It took us not a second to realize 
his meaning. We saw Sturl, a figure 



of rope, stiff and upright like some 
strange soldier, on the stove in the 
church at Raebrudafisk — Sturl incap- 
able of movement, incapable of sound 
save such as the wdnd was making. We 
saw the church door slowdy open and 
Uflio, stone-blind Uflio, appear. We 
saw him go to the- vestry, and emerge 
wdth fagots, paper, and coal. We 
saw him arrange the fuel in the stove, 
utterly unconscious of Sturl, al- 
though his fingers would approach 
to within a few inches of the wretch’s 
feet whenever he manipulated the 
flap at the top. We saw him bring 
a bottle of oil from his pocket, soak 
the fuel, and light it. 

“And then we felt the sensations 
of Sturl, the terror which seized him 
as soon as he perceived w r hat was to 
come, the leap oi hope which his 
heart would give w r hen Uflio ’s hand 
came near him, the frenzy of awful 
despair which beset him as he 
strained and strained to loosen a limb 
or to shift the gag with his tongue. 
We felt the first slight warmth to the 
soles of the feet. We felt the pipe 
against the back of the head, and 
the slow, sure heating of the pipe. . . 
We saw- and felt all these things in- 
stantaneously, as it were; and, far 
faster than we had run to Phyamu, 
we ran from it toward our church, 
all except .Vavik, who continued his 
work. ’ ’ 

“No more!” I said, standing up. 
But Kobyssu really w r as in the past 
now. He did not hear me; and, in- 
stead of walking out of earshot, I re- 
mained, dazed. 

“I was speedy of leg,” said Kobys- 
su, “and, though I could swing only 
one arm, I led the way with Hrok. 
We were not certain what time it 
was ; we believed there was no chance 
of saving Sturl; yet, in case there 
might be, we tore along. Our earli- 
est glimpse of the church showed its 
smoke blowing from the ehimney. As 
to Sturl having been discovered- — 
well, presently we made out Uflio 



232

sitting quietly by Djira’s grave, and 
the pastor and some of the women- 
folk coming up through the firs from 
the village with no sign of excite- 
ment. Still we ran, ran through the 
churchyard, ran to the church door. 
Hrok opened it, and the hot air from 
inside met me. There was a reek of 
smoldering hemp, just like that of 
the string you allowed to smolder, 
only much more powerful; and fol- 
lowing it was another reek ” 

‘ ‘ Stop ! ” I yelled ; and I shook 
Kobvssu roughly by the shoulder. 
Then I sat down, feeling indubitably 
faint. “You’d better give me a 
drink, Kobyssu, ” I said. “I might 
have stood it in print, but to hear 
yori tell it, you who were a wit- 
ness — 

“And yet,” I said, when I was re- 
covering, “I can’t help referring to 
the matter once — once only, though. 
Something strikes me as curious. You 
said that Uflio’s perception was un- 
canny. In that case I consider it 
■strange that a palpitating human 
being should have been within six 



inches and he have no inkling of the 
fact. ’ ’ 

obyssu, who had gone white 
^ again toward the finish of the 
tale, had brought a measure of 
brandy for himself, and this he 
drained before replying. 

“I will tell you,” he said, “a de- 
tail that was seen only by Hrok and 
another, who cut down the — the re- 
mains, and by me; for Hrok wiped 
the face very quickly. . . . For a 
number of years Sturl had borne on 
his left cheek a scar, a large, puck- 
ered scar that stood out from the rest 
of the flesh. Sturl ’s face, when Ilrok 
lowered him, was wrought on by the 
heat, yet some peculiar marks were 
still visible on the left cheek. They 
were littl° stripes, apparently a 
mingling c i oil and coal dust such as 
might have been made by t fingers 
of, let us say, a blind p r;on who 
sought, by feeling for the sear, to 
satisfy himself as to the identity of 
the man he had discovered on the 
stove. ’ ’ 



THE DEATH CELL 

By SAMUEL M. SARGENT, JR. 



It’s lonesome here in the dawning, 
Sitting behind the bars, 

Watching a gray moon, and gray sky, 
And gray, galactic stars. 

Tt’s lonesome waiting for footsteps 
Coming along the row, 

Lonesomer than it ever was 
The morning I’m to go. 

The scaffold’s standing and ready, 
The hammer quit last noon. 

And here I am with the gray stars, 
And gray , sky, and gray moon. 



I can not express my feelings 
Here in this cursed room, 
Listening to catch the footstep 

That sounds my coming doom. 

I can not express my feelings — 

Words couldn’t tell them all! — 
In this gray room, in this gray dawn, 
Shadowed by this gray wall. 

It’s lonesome here in the dawning, 
Sitting behind the bars, 
Watching a gray moon, and gray sky, 
And the Galaxy’s gray stars. 




“Her scream changed to a moan of agony.” 



t77?eHL 



BASSETT MORGAN 



A BOUT the stilt legs of the nipa- 
thatched hut, Paul Dakens 
jL JL looked down into a lagoon so 
clear that he could see the little 
painted fish scattering like sparks. 
Behind him in the hut the little 
brown wife of Phillips mourned her 
husband, whose funeral orgies were 
already in progress with a prodigal- 
ity of feasting and ceremony accord- 
ed a white man by the Papuan blacks 
who had murdered him. Dakens 
glanced at the woman huddled on the 
mats. At the head of the couch, 
Phillips’ pet monkey blinked solemn- 
ly as if he understood that his mas- 
ter would never return, and felt the 
fear which Dakens shared of those 
drums already tearing the forest 
gloom to tatters. 

The untimely death of Phillips had 
left unfinished that work he had 
planned with Dakens’ help of giving 
to the world their understanding of 
the natives, unless Dakens went on, 
and he was afraid. The blacks who 
feared the magic tricks of Phillips 



more than the sorcery of their own 
magician had none of that respect 
for Dakens. In his heart he knew 
that he would in all probability be 
taken and tortured. Phillips’ little 
brown wife had warned him, had 
even offered to guide him through 
the tortuous lanes of jungle trees 
bedded in black water, rank with 
the smell of walk-about grounds of 
crocodiles; yet in her eyes, limpid 
and dark as dew in the heart 
of a black orchid, he had read 
hate and a desire for vengeance 
toward Gwanoo, the chieftain whom 
Phillips had outwitted of a bride 
when he took the girl to his own hut. 

A week before, Phillips had gone 
with Gwanoo on a pig-sticking expe- 
dition. Three days, or rather nights 
later, Dakens had been wakened by 
the brown girl’s Song of Mourning, 
nor could he laugh aside her fears. 
On the following morning Gwanoo re- 
turned, seated himself on the edge of 
this lagoon and beheaded Phillips’ 
body, preparing the head as a decora- 



234 



WEIRD TALES 



tive addition to his already fine col- 
lection. 

Powerless to prevent, Dakens had 
been ill over it, enduring three days 
of racking fear while the brown wo- 
man kept guard, and he slept to 
dream of the head of his friend, the 
red hair and bushy red beard. He 
wakened frenzied and hysteric each 
time, and the brown woman plied 
him with palm -wine, a mistaken 
kindness, as he knew. 

Drink had the effect on Dakens of 
leaving his body and flesh cold, his 
brain alert and afire, and the skill 
of the surgeon he had once been al- 
ways turned him to his case of knives. 
Behind his eyelids for three days and 
nights the head of Phillips seemed 
urging him to vengeance, not to glut 
cruelty — Phillips was too fine a man 
for that — but that the fear of the 
white man might once more make it 
safe for Dakens to stay on the lagoon 
and finish the notes for which both 
men had already sacrificed years. 

Palm wine, fermenting daily, had 
not quieted his fear, but it dulled his 
power to fight that mad dream of cur- 
ing the head of Gwanoo as he had 
mummied the head of Phillips. The 
brown woman, little dreaming the 
peril she loosed, wakened and carried 
the jar of wine to Dakens. He tilted 
back his head and drank thirstily. 
The monkey swung across the hut 
and crouched at his knees, one small 
black paw on his wrist. Dakens pat- 
ted its head, then pouring wine in his 
palm, he let it drink. He heard the 
soft cry of protest from the woman, 
and in sheer perversity gave the little 
beast a second drink of wine. 

In a few minutes it was swinging 
all over the hut, then back to his lap, 
where he caught and held it, staring 
into its beady little eyes, and strange- 
ly enough his gaze held the creature, 
and between their eyes shone the 
dancing head of Phillips. 

“If I had your agility,” said Da-., 
kens whimsically, “I’d get it.” 



The brown woman called the mon- 
key in vain, and she scolded Dakens 
in quick angry native words. He had 
forgotten that she was jealous of the 
friendship between him and Phillips, 
forgotten that she was a comely lit- 
tle primitive whose lovely brown 
body shaped to feet with great pre- 
hensile toes not unlike those of the 
monkey. She was grief-stricken as 
only a primitive can be, and he real- 
ized a moment later that in her re- 
sentment at his giving wine to the 
beast, she had suddenly cast off any 
feeling of allegiance for him. 

A moment later she snatched the 
monkey and plunged into the lagoon, 
and was swimming through the clear 
water toward shore. Dakens smiled. 
Watching her brown body, sleek and 
smooth as satin in the sun-green 
water, he was conscious only of its 
symmetry, the pleasing unity of mus- 
cular strength, and the fact that she 
was running true to type, a daughter 
of the jungle, going back. 

She would, he supposed, return to 
Gwanoo, but he thought his own 
chances of escape vrere better than 
her chance for life if the sorcerer 
took her. For her own sake, Dakens 
wished she had not gone, but the 
palm wine had cured him of the 
clutch and bite and twist of fear. 
He felt aloof, primed for contempla- 
tive interest in forthcoming events, 
knowing that if the black men 
stormed the hut he had his own gun 
and need not endure torture. 

The girl had reached shore. There 
she stood on a strip of dazzling white 
coral beach, shining in brown loveli- 
ness against a mass of creamy hibis- 
cus, the heart-searching perfume of 
which came to his nostrils with the 
sea-tang. The monkey was in her 
arms, and she whispered with red lips 
against its cheek, caressing it with 
brown hands. And at that moment 
the jungle drums pulsed, a quick 
staccato probed his brain with hot 
fingers of sound. 



THE HEAD 



235 



T he heat and wine had made Da- 
kens drowsy, and again he 
wished the girl had not gone. He 
dared not sleep without her keeping 
guard. He was afraid of this somnol- 
ence caressing his flesh, stroking with 
languorous touch the strength from 
his body. The repeated drafts were 
“hitting” violently, and presently ho 
rose, found his case of surgical knives 
and began polishing them, forcing his 
mind to memories of operations he 
had accomplished in days gone by. 
Tli on as he turned his gaze toward 
the shore whence came the palpitant 
drumming quivering louder and fast- 
er as the funeral orgies got under 
way, he saw a patch of sunlight pierc- 
ing tree branches and falling in a cir- 
cle of- gold on the lagoon. In it, lit- 
tle fish swarmed to snap at insects, 
and Dakens seemed to see again the 
head of Phillips, only now the eyes 
were open, imploring, urging him to 
action. He tried to fathom the mean- 
ing, conscious that it was madness, a 
spot of sunlit water alive with gaudy 
fish, but the fantasy persisted. 

He went to the door, still staring, 
brushing his hand across his eyes, 
and as wind stirred the palms, the 
spot of light shifted toward shore; 
and following it, he saw a shining 
topaz gleam in the jungle, the fire 
where hate and superstition danced 
in black ghoul shapes about the bier 
of the dead white man. He heard the 
song, a savage sound of broken irri- 
tating rhythm, a song so old. that not 
even the singers understood its full 
significance, a song that went with 
shoreless rivers and jungle trees root- 
ed in black water stirred by scaled 
horrors with gaping jaws. 

The brown girl was gone. Dakens 
shuddered to think what might be 
happening, unless her comeliness 
earned a merciful death. He turned 
again to the spot on the lagoon, but 
the sun had moved and the water 
was in shadow, the little fish flutter- 



ing like scattered stars in a cool 
green sky. 

Then the drum-beating was abrupt- 
ly broken and a wild outcry ended 
the song. Two Paradise birds danc- 
ing in the tops of tall trees flew away 
from some disturbance. Dakens for- 
got his fear. He was staring at the 
head of Phillips hanging from a 
small black paw in a clump of dark 
foliage, its luxurious beard stirred 
by the wind, its lips tight-sewn but 
seemingly puckered in a grim smile 
as if their owner enjoyed the joke he 
had found beyond the shore of life. 

Dakens wanted to laugh with the 
head. The monkey which had loved 
Phillips had stolen his head from 
the funeral wreaths of the village 
and swung through the trees. It 
leaped down from the branches, and 
the brown girl sprang up from her 
hiding place to catch it in her arms. 
There was the sharp z-z-z-z of an ar- 
row and a cluster of falling flowers. 
The girl swayed a moment, then 
caught the monkey and raced to the 
lagoon and was swimming. She w r as 
almost to the hut when the jungle 
belched black men. Dakens snatched 
his gun and fired. A savage whirled 
and .fell, his lips at the lagoon rip- 
ples. 

The girl was swimming under 
water, a brown undulating power 
which Dakens longed to watch and 
dared not. A second and third shot 
cracked, and the black men halted, 
reluctant to change so soon their 
feast of flesh to an outflow of souls. 
The brown girl reached the hut and 
swarmed wdth incredible swiftness to 
its door, while the blacks chattered 
in consultation on shore. 

Dakens felt a wild elation at the 
crisis hurled upon him. This was 
better than brooding in the hut, wait- 
ing for death. The girl was crooning 
over the monkey, which whined in a 
small squeaky voice, and caressing 
the head of Phillips, but Dakens saw 
blood on her lips and knew she was 



236

wounded, and presently the head 
s oiled from her grasp to the mats and 
lay grinning at Dakens through 
tight-sewn lips, as if it assured him 
that he was doing well. 

He would have given a year of life, 
if he had the hope of so much, to 
fathom the smile of those dead lips 
and guess what they would have ad- 
vised. He was conscious of urging 
Phillips to tell him what to do. He 
could not withstand a siege of the 
hut. Sooner or later they would rash 
him, and he needed time and bullets 
for the woman and himself. A grim 
respect for her courage thrilled him, 
a part of his elation over the stand 
he made. She deserved a heroic end, 
a shot that would send her soul to 
seek Phillips who was waiting. Da- 
kens felt the presence of his friend. 
The head was no longer horrid; it 
was as if Phillips had come back. 

Then on shore the mass of blacks 
pai-ted and Gwanoo stood on the cor- 
al, a magnificent black giant, strong 
white teeth flashing, his head-dress 
surmounted with sw-aying plumes of 
Paradise, scarlet flowers encircling 
his oiled body. And Gwanoo boomed 
his parley. He demanded the head, 
if that were returned he would take 
his men away to the feast. If it were 
not 

The murmur of the brown girl’s 
voice translated the promise of hor- 
ror, the death by ants, by palm fiber, 
by slicing slowly, by being taken on 
‘lie crocodile walk-about grounds. 

Dakens licked his dry lips. His 
mind called, demanded of Phillips 
how he should act, if he must send on 
!he girl Phillips had loved and fol- 
low her and leave the notes garnered 
at such a cost to molder in the hut. 

“It’s your job, Phillips,” he heard 
himself whispering; “you would 
trust Gwanoo and he killed you. You 
trusted me and I don’t know what 
to do, Phillips !” 

He was scarcely conscious that, he 
spoke, until the brown girl crept to 



his feet and murmured, “Kill Gwa- 
noo, Marster, kill Gwanoo as he killed 
my white man.” 

She had seized his gun, and there 
was a sharp volley of shots, a dozen 
leaping black men and three inert 
bodies across the twisting splendor 
that had been Gwanoo, then the 
others fled. 

Dakens turned and seized the 
gourd, and throwing back his head 
emptied the wine in great gasping 
gurgles down his own throat. He 
needed it. The respite would be 
brief. Under cover of darkness they 
would return. But the moment the 
black men wore in the jungle, the girl 
was in the lagoon. Dakens saw her 
swimming back slowly, weighted by 
the body of the sorcerer, which she 
hauled up the steps and dragged in 
the door, then she touched Dakens’ 
arm and pointed. Gwanoo still lived. 

In the girl’s eyes was a gleam of 
triumph. Hating Gwanoo as she did 
for the murder of her white man, she 
showed the lust and greed of the 
primitive she was, at this chance of 
inflicting on an enemy the torture 
she had seen him visit on others. Da- 
kens saw her dax-t to the case of 
knives, and seizing the largest, sit on 
the floor and whet its blade on the 
sole of her foot, then leaning toward 
the inert Gwanoo she lifted the knife. 

Dakens leaped and caught hei* 
wrist. She was like a tiger in his 
grasp, and only that she had been 
hurt he could not have kept her from 
murder. She twisted with uixbeliev- 
able strength, and in the end turned 
her ferocity on him. He never knew 
how it happened, but as she writhed 
and bit at him with her teeth, there 
came a cry and she went limp, the 
knife-blade thrust deep in her abdo- 
men. Her scream changed to a moan 
of agony. Blood spurted oxi his 
hands, and he staggered with her to 
the heaped mats where the little 
monkey huddled, nursing the head of 
Phillips. 



THE HEAD 



237 



F rom that moment Dakens lost 
track of events. The wine, the 
strain of the last three days and 
nights, the frenzied elation of killing 
and the sight of the . life-blood of the 
brown girl spilled on the couch, 
combined to wrest reason from its 
throne. He went temporarily mad, 
with a cool deadly insanity that 
turned from the stunned Gwanoo to 
the dying woman. Between them lay 
his case of knives. A little beyond 
were other precious things, among 
them the highly prized jars of ether 
and chloroform. 

He worked with mad frenzy and 
dextrous surety of skill. The monkey 
fled to the farthest comer of the hut 
and hid. The whimpering of the lit- 
tle beast was the only audible sound 
through the afternoon. Then the 
fumes of palm wine left him and tho 
ether cleared in the wind that comes 
at sunset, and Dakens saw and real- 
ized the work of his hands, and he 
wanted to imitate the monkey, crouch 
in utter darkness and hide. 

Yet with night would come the 
horde of death from the jungle, and 
having endured so much he wanted 
to make a last stand, sell as dearly 
as he could the life of the man now 
roused from the mists of drink that 
had turned him madman. 

Why he did not then turn the gun 
on Gwanoo, he never knew. It might 
have been that the monkey crept 
presently from the shadow and came 
close to Gwanoo ’s body, reaching a 
small black paw to touch the face of 
the black sorcerer. The little brown 
girl was dead, her body wrapped in 
the mats, but the stalwart Gwanoo 
showed signs of life. One black hand 
with its heavy wristlets was lifted to 
the bandage about the brows. Hear- 
ing a moan, the monkey crept close 
and the fumbling hand found and 
fondled the little beast which snug- 
gled in the curve of Gwanoo ’s arm. 

Dakens sat at the door of the hut, 
more alert than at any time since 



Phillips’ death, and he tried to re- 
member what he had done. The ac- 
tions of the monkey puzzled him.. It 
had been fond of the brown girl and 
Phillips, never very friendly with 
Dakens, yet it clung to the body of 
the savage sorcerer. Dakens mar- 
veled at himself, wondering why he 
had extracted the bullet from Gwa- 
noo ’s brain. It lay on the table be- 
side a welter of something that he 
would not look at now that he was 
sober. For he had been very drunk. 
His hands, his body and brain had 
been controlled by the demon which 
drink roused, a demon this time that 
was that red-haired, red-bearded head 
on the mats. Dakens reached out 
and took it on his knees. 

“What was it that you made me 
do, Phillips?” he demanded of it. 
“Why did you return from that 
bourne you’ve reached and take the 
girl with you ? ’ ’ 

He realized that he talked like a 
maniac, but he could not stop. 

“Was it for love of her, the faith- 
ful little brown beauty, or jealousy 
of me? You need not have feared 
that. There’s a white girl in a white 
man’s land, waiting for me, and now 
I can’t go back.” His voice broke. 
“I can’t go back with blood-guilty 
hands. Phillips, I didn’t deserve 
this treachery. I came with you, 
stayed with you. . . If only you had 
not gone hunting with Gwanoo we’d 
have come out of this and gained hon- 
or. We had accomplished much, we 
had sacrificed these years and our 
own honorable careers to - catalogue 
these devils, and now you’ve spoiled 
the chance of ever giving the results 
of that research to the world ... as 
I said you would do when you took 
the girl first.” 

The sun, dropping behind the dark 
line of palms, cast shadow over the 
lagoon. The thunderous sunset of 
Papua seemed to growl about its soft 
panther-hide of forest. In the jungle 
the drums were beating up the tempo 



238 



WEIRD TALES 



of that old song and Dakens was 
swept on that rhythm to an interlude 
in which the years of their lives in 
the jungle unfolded before his eyes, 
and standing out from those het 
steaming months was the affection of 
Phillips for the brown girl. He saw 
it now as the one fatal mistake which 
would eventually destroy all they had 
done. Phillips had been mad about 
her. Dying, he would not rest until 
she was winging her way to his side. 
Dakens came to believe it in that 
hour. The will of the dead man had 
taken a tortuous way to manifest its 
power, but it was tangible, audible, 
as real to Dakens as the breath on 
his lips. 

Reason had no power to refute the 
thing. He no longer fought- the 
thought. His whole body, his men- 
tality, felt the will of Phillips urging 
him to some task yet unfinished. 
Then, as if answering the question 
twisting Daken’s mind, .the voice of 
Gwanoo murmured, “Water, Mar- 
ster, water.” 

Dakens leaped to his feet. This 
was no booming sound from the great 
throat of the sorcerer, but a woman’s 
murmur, the crooning words of the 
brown girl. He reached for the 
gourd of boiled and cooled water, 
and held it to the thick lips. The 
eyes beneath the head bandage 
opened, and it seemed to Dakens they 
had the same soft sheen as the girl’s 
eyes, the look of dew in the heart of 
a black orchid. 

‘ ‘ Take me . . . my people . . . my 

jungle ” it murmured again and 

again. 

Dakens shook himself, brushed his 
hand over his face, pinched the flesh 
of his arms. Stumbling from the 
restless movements of the reviving 
Gwanoo, his foot touched the head 
of Phillips, and snatching it up he 
would have placed it on the table, 
but the hands of Gwanoo reached and 
drew it beside him. The monkey 
roused and caught its claws in the 



red beard, Dakens threw up a hand 
to his lips to throttle the scream in 
his throat. 

The shadows deepened. The black 
Papuan hills smoked against the fu- 
rious crimson and amber of the sky. 
In another few minutes the light 
would die and night descend; night, 
and the bat-winged fear that 
had held him prisoner for days, 
a worse fear than before, be- 
cause the hut held unbelievable 
horror, the body of the brown 
girl in the mats and the great 
Gwanoo now reviving rapidly, call- 
ing incessantly for water, hugging 
the monkey and the head to its 
breast. 

That voice had power to bring 
Dakens with the gourd, and the last 
of his precious brandy mixed with 
water. It was as if he fed magic to 
one of those flowers which Hindoo 
fakirs raise from a seed to bud and 
bloom in the space of a few minutes. 
It was like Gwanoo ’s own magic that 
plucked an orchid from the air and 
had it turn to a snake. The sorcerer 
grew strong beyond belief. With 
staring eyes Dakens saw him lean on 
one arm, then sit upright, still caress- 
ing the monkey and the head, and the 
affection of the little animal was the 
most curious thing of all. Dakens 
felt as if he were caught in a night- 
mare. 

Then he was aware of the accelera- 
tion of the jungle song and drums. 
They were coming through the jun- 
gle, coming through the night, com- 
ing to the lagoon — and they came 
for him. His scalp prickled. He 
stood at the hut doorwav dreading 
the darkness that held Gwanoo and 
the head, clutching mentally at the 
luminence of starlight on the lagoon 
water. He saw the blacks emerge, 
thicker shadow in the gloom, saw 
torches bloom and fire flash on 
knives and wreaths of white hibiscus 
splotched by scarlet flowers that 
looked like dried blood. The torch

flare showed their betel-stained teeth, 
the bracelets of bone and metal, the 
quivering head-plumes. 

It was of no use to shoot at that 
mass, better to reserve his bullets and 
strength for their rush. He kept 
his revolver so that he might thrust it 
at any moment in his mouth, and fire. 
Too late, he wished he had dickered 
with Gwanoo to have the notes that 
he and Phillips had made sent out to 
a port. Now, they would be as much 
wasted as his life. The savages were 
in the lagoon water. On shore they 
had heaped their torches and the 
blaze lighted the clear depths where 
little fish flashed in scaled gold. Da- 
kens turned to the darkness of the hut 
and lifted the revolver. It touched 
his chin, and crept toward his lips . . . 

His scream startled the swimmers. 
From behind him, the great arms of 
Gwanoo caught and pinioned his 
wrists to his sides. He saw the torch 
flare from shore shining on the black 
face under the startling white gauze 
bandages, saw the soft dark eyes 
shining, heard the voice gentle as that 
of a woman; “Not kill, Marster . . . 
live an’ go out. . ” 

Frantic, frenzied, Dakens twisted 
in that grasp. Then the hut was 
filled with savages; and the voice of 
Gwanoo, booming with its old 
strength, commanded his warriors. 
Dakens was held in the grip of sav- 
ages while Gwanoo, leaning heavily 
on the shoulder of two black men, 
looked down at an uncovered dead 
girl on the mats. Dakens saw. His 
heart pounded in his throat as he ap- 
praised the work of his hands, the 
neat surgery, the delicate line of 
stitches under her hair. What, what 
in heaven’s name, had he done that 
day ? 

Far, far away, memory throbbed, 
tapped, rustled a sheaf of pictures, 
experiments at college, transplanting 
the brains of one dog to the head of 
another ... he had shQwn skill at 
that ... 



His eyes turned to the table where 
Gwanoo was lifting and dropping his 
surgical instruments into the black 
case, closing it and gesturing to one 
of his men to carry it. Something 
else lay there. Dakens saw with a 
surgeon’s interest paramount, the 
brain of Gwanoo. He knew, at least 
he felt the knowledge of what he had 
done, for his mind was dragged over 
a trail without his own volition. 

He was scarcely aware that they 
swung him to their shoulders and 
swam with him through the lagoon. 
He saw on shore the giant Gwanoo 
still leaning on the shoulders of his 
men, but with the head of Phillips 
clutched in one arm and the monkey 
perched on a shoulder beside the 
bandaged head of the sorcerer. Then, 
for Dakens, the lights went out. 

H e wakened in a hut. Dawn 
poured its soft light through the 
doorway. A soft murmur of women ’s 
voices droned, through his dreams. 
The Jungle song was stilled, the 
drums silent. He heard the tinkle of 
shells fringing the hut of a chieftain, 
stirred by the wind. The perfume 
of ylang-ylang wafted to his nos- 
trils. Rousing himself, Dakens saw 
women weaving flower garlands in 
the soft green shade of a Jungle clear- 
ing, and among them sat Gwanoo; 
but a Gwanoo subtly changed from 
the savage sorcerer whose look had 
power to waken fear. Gwanoo played 
with flowers. The little monkey sat 
on his knee. He leaned against a 
tree bole, and above his flower- and 
Paradise-plumed hair, in a w r reath of 
fresh garlands hung Phillips’ head. 

Dakens looked about the hut, saw 
his case of surgical instruments, and 
the black metal box wrapped in oil- 
skin which held his notes. Then he 
tried to recall the nights in the hut, 
the horror of the last day, and looked 
again at Gwanoo. The gauze band- 
age was gone. There was a scar 
across the broad forehead disappear- 



240 



WEIRD TALES 



ing into the hair. The eyes were not 
those piercing beadlike jets. The 
voice held the soft woman-tone. 

Dakens sat up, and his movement 
brought a woman into the hut. A 
moment later she had summoned 
Gwanoo, who entered and sat cross- 
legged beside Dakens, and handed 
him the box of notes. 

“Marster, you sleep long time. 
One, two, t ’ree moons you sleep. 
Now you go out.” 

Go out! Light leaped in Dakens’ 
eyes, warmth flooded his heart. Gwa- 
noo had given him a lease of life, of 
mercy, of hope. 

They fed him. The women mas- 
saged his body with lemon-scented 
oil as they had done for many days. 
They imparted the strength of their 
hands to his flesh and healed him. 
Gwanoo kept guard, a Gwanoo 
changed, a Gwanoo woman-gentle. 
The village of nipa-thatched ' huts 
was strangely devoid of men. He 
learned from their talk that the war- 
riors were hunting the contraband 
Paradise plumes and would be gone 
many days, and that he was to be 
sent out before their return. Dakens 
had lain for three months bereft of 
reason, nursed by the commands of 
Gwanoo, and at last he understood. 

Gwanoo ’s brain was left in the la- 
goon hut. The brain of the brown 
girl inhabited the head of the sorcer- 
er. Yet before he left, Dakens car- 
ried the case of knives that were the 
instruments of this magic, to where 
a long war canoe nosed the black- 
shadowed lianas looped above the 
jungle stream, and dropped it into 
the depths. Never again would he 



use his surgeon’s skill, for very fear 
of its cunning. 

Returning, he stood before the 
head of Phillips and saluted. He 
spoke not a word. The tight-sewn 
lips still grinned at the joke of it all. 

Dakens had one regret as he 
stepped into the canoe and looked for 
the last time on the magnificent Gwa- 
noo with the soft eyes of the bride 
of Phillips, that he would never know 
how the thing would end; whether 
the warrior body of the sorcerer 
would in time absorb the woman- 
brain, or the woman weaken the war- 
rior. It seemed a pity he could not 
watch that phase, but in a white 
man’s land a white girl waited, and 
there were the notes to work on and 
give to the world, the most interest- 
ing of which could not be included 
in a precise and scholarly treatise 
such as he and Phillips had planned. 

The paddles dipped. The throats 
of black men took up the jungle song, 
and floating under the dark trees, 
Dakens looked his last at the grinning 
tight-sewn lips of his friend, of Phil- 
lips who had engineered so curiously 
the release of Dakens. Ahead, the 
dark water stirred and a crocodile 
rose and opened wide jaws and 
showed its curved wicked fangs, but 
Dakens only smiled. 

Nothing had power to startle him 
now. He had come through surer 
deaths, guarded and protected by 
greater power than his owm, with 
keener cunning and more subtle wit. 
It was like the Phillips he had 
known. Phillips would have loved 
to tell such a tale. In the memory 
of Dakens, he would always be grin- 
ning, tight-lipped, a flower-wreathed, 
greatly prized head.

A Short ’Tale About an Egyptian Magician 

The Unearthly 

By DON ROBERT CATLIN 



J IM HOWARD was astonished at 
what his friend had proposed to 
do, and attempted to put him 
right. j, 

“See here, Jerry; I can tell you 
that you’ll only be making a fool of 
yourself! I happened to be present 
at that affair at the Crawfords’, and 
I saw the thing with my own eyes. 
It may, as you say, be unearthly — but 
I saw it !” 

Jerry Newman laughed at his 
friend’s fears. 

“You think you saw it,” he said 
ironically. 

Howard shrugged expressively. 
“Then, if I can’t dissuade you, I 
suppose I may as well accede to your 
request. Thursday night, voir said?” 
Jerry nodded shortly. “Yes. I’ve 
heard so blooming much about that 
Egyptian’s prowess that I am deter- 
mined to put an end to his fame once 
and for all. I met him the other day, 
and, as I have already told you, I 
told him to his face that he was a 
faker of the worst kind; and that, 
without his preparations made, he 
couldn’t duplicate his feat. In other 
words, that in a room selected by my- 
self and at a time named by me, he 
could not do what he did at the Craw- 
fords’. And I wagered an even five 
thousand dollars that he would fail 
under the conditions I have named..” 
Howard’s face showed his concern. 
“That’s going a bit strong, Jerry. 
Laugh if you wish, but I tell you that 
I saw the thing with my own eyes — 
and I was looking for flaws at the 
time. The Egyptian, Mohamet Ali, 

w. T. — 3 



will most certainly win your five 
thousand.” 

Jerry Newman waved his friend’s 
objections aside. “Your arguments 
are beside the matter at hand,” he 
said. “You’ve given me permission 
to use your studio next Thursday 
night; and I shall inform Mohamet 
Ali only at the last minute of the 
scene of his performance; which will 
make it virtually impossible for him 
to arrange any properties or stage ef- 
fects. It is my contention that with- 
out any prearrangements, the Egyp- 
tian will fail.” 

The other shrugged again as 
though to wash his hands of the mat- 
ter. He had seen Mohamet Ali 

T hursday evening came, and with 
the darkening of the skies a group 
of Jerry Newman’s closest friends 
gathered in Howard’s studio. Some 
of them had, like Jim Howard, been 
present at the demonstration at the 
Crawfords’ and all of them were cer- 
tain that their friend was to lose his 
wager. One’s eyes do not lie, you 
know; what one had seen one had 
seen! 

A few minutes after the last of the 
group had arrived, the door opened to 
admit Newman ; closely following 
him came the Egyptian, a lean, 
swarthy, yet rather handsome-looking 
fellow for all his swarthiness. At the 
Egyptian’s heels trotted an urchin 
who was quite evidently either an 
Egyptian, as was Mohamet Ali, or an 
Arab. 



241 



242 



WEIRD TALES 



“I think that you have met most 
of these gentlemen,” said Jerry, in- 
dicating the small gathering. “I’ve 
asked them to be present, as wit- 
nesses. ’ ’ 

“Quite naturally, one would wish 
witnesses,” murmured Mohamet Ali 
politely, a smile touching his mouth. 

Jerry Newman bowed. “Billy 
Weaver is the stakeholder, as you 
know, and the wager is to be paid im- 
mediately upon a satisfactory or — 
pardon me — unsatisfactory conclu- 
sion of your feat.. And now, we may 
as well ” 

The Egyptian bowed. “At your 
convenience, sirs,” he said. “If you 
will arrange yourselves ?” 

The group gathered in a semicircle. 
And then, as the Egyptian drew the 
urchin close to him and advanced to 
the center of the improvised stage, an 
almost blindingly intense blue-white 
light illuminated the room. From 
overhead came a soft fluttering, a 
faint hissing, as the huge Cooper- 
Hewitt photographic lights settled, 
down to a steady glare: 



“Pardon me for not informing you 
that the lights were to be turned on, 
Mohamet Ali,” Jerry Newman spoke 
up. “I’d almost forgotten them. 
You see,” he went on disarmingly, 
‘ ‘ the room is quite gloomy, and — well, 
you are quite aware of the fact that 
I am looking for trickery on your 
part. This studio, you see, belongs 
to friend Howard, who is a photo- 
graphic illustrator for several maga- 
zines ; and the Cooper-Hewitts are 
used to light his sets. As you may 
see for yourself, they illuminate 
every nook and corner of the studio, 
and — well, tonight your every move 
will be clearly visible!” 

“As you will,” the Egyptian ac- 
ceded smilingly. From somewhere 
about his person he drew a short, 
ugly-looking sword, and a small ball 
of twine. The sword he laid upon the 
floor. “Now, gentlemen, if you will 
follow me closely ” 



With the words he grasped the end 
of the twine and tossed the ball up- 
ward, quickly. A gasp went up from 
the little audience as they saw the 
twine seemingly vanish through one 
of the great skylights . . . indeed, the 
skylight seemed to have vanished, for 
they could see out into the heavens. 
Overhead the rolling evening clouds 
passed in stately array, and into them 
the twine disappeared. 

At a word from the Egyptian the 
small boy clutched the twine in his 
hands and began climbing upward. 
The astonished Jerry gazed open- 
mouthed as the urchin wriggled and 
squirmed his way up that twine, 
continuing on until he, too, was swept 
from sight by the low-hanging 
clouds. 

Mohamet Ali stood at the base of 
that slender ladder to the heavens. 
After a moment he called out : ‘ ‘ Come 
down ! ’ ’ 

The twine wiggled a bit, as though 
the urchin had commenced his down- 
ward flight ; then all movement 
ceased. 

Mohamet Ali was incensed. ‘ ‘ Come 
dovm ! ” he shouted. ‘ ‘ Come down ! ’ ’ 

He listened intently as if for an an- 
swer. None came. Frowning fero- 
ciously, quite obviously enraged at 
the boy’s refusal to obey him, the 
Egyptian stoopefl and seized the 
sword. 

“Spawn of Shaitan!” he snarled, 
grasping the twine in his brown 
hands. And then he, too, climbed up- 
ward. 

Chin sagging, Jerry Newsman 
watched the Egyptian follow the ur- 
chin into the clouds. Then the twine 
began to sway to and fro, violently. 
From above came w T eird shrieks, shrill 
implorings for mercy ; then they were 
drowned out by the lov'er tones of the 
Egyptian’s voice, snarling, vicious. 

An unearthly scream split asunder 
the silence in the room below; a 
scream that set on edge each nerve in 
the bodies of the watchers. 



THE UNEARTHLY 



243 



Drops of blood spattered on the 
carpet; and a moment later an arm 
fell thudding to the floor. It was 
small, slender, dark-skinned. It was 
the urchin ’s arm ! 

Followed another cry, and the 
other arm struck sickeningly beside 
the first.. Then, before the horrified 
eyes of the beholders, in quick suc- 
cession they saw the urchin's feet — 
his dismembered legs — his head — and 
then the bloody torso striking before 
them ! 

Then, from above, Mohamet Ali 
came slipping down the twine. He 
landed lightly on his feet beside the 
horrible disarray. 

“He would not obey me,” he said 
simply as he glanced about him upon 
the gathering. 

As if that ended the matter he ex- 
tended his foot and kicked the dis- 
membered body into a pile. The 
twine he grasped and, giving it a jerk 
so that it fell into his hands, rolled it 
up compactly. Then, glancing about, 
he seized a large rug from the floor 
and quickly threw the severed pieces 
of the body into it. Gathering the 
four corners, he lifted the horrible 
burden — and thmv it at the feet of 
the men who were watching him. 

The rug thudded on the floor — un- 
folded — and the urchin, miraculously 
made whole again, leaped lightly to 
his feet and salaamed deeply. 

“That is all, I think,” Mohamet 
Ali said easily. 

\ chorus of “I told you so’s” 
-**■ dinned into Jerry Newman’s 
ears. “You wouldn’t believe, Jerry 
— and it’s cost you exactly five thou- 
sand dollars!” 

A sly grin touched Jerry’s lips. 
“I haven’t lost — as yet,” he said 
slowly. 

The Egyptian ’s brows lifted. 
“Did you not see with your own 
eyes, sir?” 

Newman nodded. “Quite right, 
Mohamet Ali. I did see with my own 



eyes — but my eyes are not infallible, 
you know — and so I brought along 
an eye with me that doesn ’t lie. ’ ’ TIo 
smiled into the astounded faces of the 
little group. “All right, Harrison!” 
he called loudly. 

A door at the farther end of the 
room opened and a wiry, cigarette- 
smoking individual stalked into the 
room. In his hands he held a square, 
black wooden box, perhaps six inches 
across. 

“I’ve seen some wild things, Mr. 
Newman, in my line of work, but this 
thing tonight surely had me going 
for a while,” he grinned. 

Turning to the scowling Mohamet 
Ali, Jerry New r man explained: “This 
gentleman is Mr. Harrison, one of the 
World-Wide News-reel motion-pic- 
ture cameramen. I obtained his serv- 
ices for the evening with an idea in 
view to photograph your every action. 
Perhaps now you’ll comprehend my 
reason for choosing Howard’s studio 
— with its Cooper-Hewitt photo- 
graphic lights. Mr. Harrison has 
been ‘shooting’ your feat through a 
small hole in the wall from the ad- 
joining room. And if, as I believe, 
your demonstration has been a fake, 
the truth-telling camera-eye will 
prove it! I’ll have this roll of film 
developed tonight, and printed; and 
in the morning we’ll run the picture 
in some projection room. Perhaps, 
Mohamet Ali, you will think that I 
have taken advantage of you — but I 
warned you that I was a thorough 
skeptic, and you should have been on 
guard. And now, I think there is 
nothing more until we gather tomor- 
row morning to witness what Mr. 
Harrison has filmed.” 

The Egyptian smiled charmingly. 
“No apologies necessary, I assure 
you, Mr. Newman. One doesn’t re- 
linquish five thousand dollars without 
having, as you Westerners say, a run 
for his money.” He beamed upon 
the motion-picture cameraman. “And 
you, Mr. Harrison ; in that little 



244

black box yon hold an absolute proof 
of exactly every move my assistant 
and myself have made? Quite re- 
markable !” 

The Egyptian took the little black 
box into his hands. Idly curious in 
manner, he carried it to the nearest 
light as if to survey it more closely. 
And, somehow, his foot caught in a 
rug and he stumbled. 

The black box fell with a erash to 
the floor, and a creamy-white roll of 
film cascaded profusely from its con- 
fines. 

‘ ‘ Really, ’ ’ Mohamet Ali gasped, ‘ * I 
must apologize for my clumsiness?” 
He stooped as though to gather up the 
film. 



“That stuff’s no good now!” 
shouted the cameraman. * ‘ The light 
has ruined it!” 

“How terribly awkward of me!” 
murmured the Egyptian. 

Billy Weaver left the group and, 
facing Mohamet Ali and Jerry New- 
man, waved two certified checks. 
“What’ll I do with these, now?” he 
queried. 

Jerry Newman’s face was a mask 
as he bowed to the Egyptian. 

“Give them to Mohamet Ali,” he 
said evenly; and presently he was 
watching a magician, an assistant, 
one sword — and two certified ehecks 
for five thousand dollars each vanish- 
ing through the doorway. 



MEG MERRILIES 

By JOHN KEATS 

- (Reprint) 



Old Meg she was a gipsy 
And lived upon the moors: 

Her bed it was the brown heath turf, 
And her house was out of doors. 
Her apples were swart blackberries, 
Her currants pods o’ broom - r 
Her wine was dew of the wild white 
rose, 

Her book a churchyard tomb. 

Her brothers were the craggy hills. 
Her sisters larehen trees — 

Alone with her great family 
She lived as she did please. 

No breakfast had she many a morn, 
No dinner many a noon, 

And ’stead of supper she would stare 
Full hard against the moon. 



But every mom, of woodbine fresh 
She made her garlanding, 

And every night the dark glen yew 
She wove, and she would sing. 

And with her fingers old and brown 
She plaited mats o’ rushes, 

And gave them to the cottagers 
She met among the bushes. 

Old Meg was brave as Margaret 
Queen 

And tall as Amazon : 

An old red blanket cloak she wore ; 

A chip hat had she on. 

God rest her aged bones somewhere — 
She died full long agone! 




SKULLS 



“Bullets had failed and I was 
at the mercy of those leering 
horrors.” 



I STOOD looking back at the lit- 
tle village of Kraanstaadt. From 
the height it looked more than 
ever like a fairy-tale village, with its 
high peaked roofs and winding 
streets of stones. Even for that pic- 
turesque land of the Hartz Moun- 
tains it was delightful, a very mas- 
terpiece, and the grim old castle that 
brooded in silence over it might well 
have housed an ogre or some sleep- 
ing princess. 

Strange little land of fairy-tale! 
The very place that gave rise to so 
many stories of the “little people,” 
living in its same tenor of ways and 
filled with ancient customs that made 
one instinctively gaze into the sky 
for winged dragons, flying carpets, 
or even witches on broomsticks. 

The people were as superstitious as 
ever was mortal race.. They had 
begged me not to tramp the road to 
Kraanstaadt and had held up their 
hands in horror over my insisting on 
taking the trail through the woods. 



“No, no,” mine host of the tavern 
had cried, “be not so foolish, for 
the woods are filled with awful 
things. ' ’ And his wife, dear old soul, 
had clung to my arm with tears. 

But I was not to be turned from 
my course of action. The walk would 
take the better part of a day in the 
deep woods and give me even a better 
appetite than I already possessed. 
Besides, this was the land of ro- 
mance, and I, for one, was not to be 
cheated of that. To their arguments, 
therefore, T turned a deaf ear and 
prepared to go. The good wife final- 
ly pressed upon me a crucifix, and in 
order not to hurt her feelings I put 
its cord about my neck and the cross 
I buttoned under my shirt. I could 
feel it thei’e now, and what was more 
to my liking, could also feel the heavy 
.45 under my armpit. I was curious 
as to whether a werewolf might bow 
to the cross, but not a bit doubtful 
as to whether his animal brother 
would respect the leaden pellets from 



246

the heavy gun. So, protected both 
physically and spiritually I stood and 
looked down upon the little village, 
and then turning, I plunged into the 
wooded trail. 

I tramped until midday and then, 
at a crossroads — perhaps I should 
say erosstrails — I sat down and ate 
the lunch I had brought with me. 
The crosstrails marked the half of my 
journey, and a few more hours ■would 
find me looking down on my destina- 
tion. I lit my pipe and finally, with 
regret, I left the delightful spot and 
took the trail to the left as I had been 
directed. The other was overgrown 
with weeds, and I made a promise in 
my heart that some day it would be 
explored. 

Tramping along, I let myself be 
lulled by the soft forest air, and in 
my mind I pictured these strange 
woods, dark and forbidding as they 
were, with the actors of childish sto- 
ries half-remembered. Surely along 
the tiny trail ahead of me were walk- 
ing the children, the lost babies, and 
the old witch ’s cabin would soon 
come in sight; eagerly I looked for 
the gnomes and dwarfs, and once a 
crackling in the brush brought me 
about to scan the forest for the sign 
of the wolf of Red Riding Hood 
fame. Soon I left the trail and sat 
down by a tree. Soothed by the hum 
of insect life and the day’s heat, I soon 
fell asleep. 

It was late afternoon when I 
sprang up and gazed at my surround- 
ings. Angered at myself, I at once 
made for the path and turned down 
it, for I knew now that my sluggish 
sleep had made me late, and I was 
in no eager mood to be left wander- 
ing in woods I did not know through 
the evening and darker night. Hur- 
riedly I paced the path with no more 
thought of the elfin folk with which 
my fancy had peopled the woods 
earlier in the day. It was cold now, 
a biting wind had sprung up, and 
dusk had begun to fall silently about 



me, a fact that accelerated my speed 
in an endeavor to keep warm. 

The path ran and wound among 
the trees, and in the growing dark- 
ness these lost their charm, and in- 
stead of hidden princes changed by 
the wave of a witch ’s wand into 
towering forest giants they seemed 
more like the hideous monsters of 
some forgotten era waiting to pounce 
on the unwary traveler who strayed 
from the path. It seemed, too, that 
behind me another presence paced, 
and glancing behind me in the grow- 
ing dusk I saw a white object melt in- 
to the trees on my right. Slowly I 
picked my way, glancing about me 
as I went, and was soon rewarded by 
seeing it again, for a moment, as it 
slipped between some tree trunks. 
Then I stepped across a little glade 
and, drawing my revolver, slipped 
behind a tree trunk and waited. A 
few seconds passed, and there 
stepped into view a monstrous white 
wolf that stalked across the tiny 
space. I fired, the deepening dusk 
being lit by an orange flame as my 
revolver spat lead, and the beast 
raced into the trees with a snarl that 
told me of a hit scored.. But it hung 
grimly on, for several times I saw it 
glide through the trees, although ow- 
ing to its caution I was unable to get 
another chance to shoot. 

Then suddenly the path was 
crossed by another. I swore in my 
anger, for mine host had told me 
there was only one plaee where the 
trail was bisected by anything. Still 
here was another path well worn by 
the passing feet of a multitude for 
many years, bigger and broader than 
the one I followed. Suddenly the 
question arose in my mind: had I 
in my first few seconds of wakeful- 
ness retraced my steps? With this 
in view I examined the broad path 
before me and then turned to look 
at the one down which I had come. 
The darkness, however, had so cov- 
ered the ground that it had van- 



THE SIGN OF THE SEVEN SKULLS 



247 



ished, and look as I might about me, 
I could not discover it. 

A moaning creak drew my atten- 
tion from the ground to the air above 
my head and I started back with an 
exclamation. There, only a few feet 
from me, was erected a gibbet, and 
upon it swung a dead man. The 
wind, which was rising rapidly, 
swung him to and fro like a pendu- 
lum, and the rope moaned and com- 
plained. So intent had I been upon 
the path that I had not noticed it un- 
til that moment. Poor fellow, I re- 
flected, had he perchance left loving 
arms and eyes that wept behind him, 
or had he faced the world alone? 
Guilty or innocent., had he faced 
death bravely or gone whimpering to 
the Great Beyond ? Or had he cursed 
those who hung him? A rustle from 
his shoulder, and two little red eyes 
glaring at me turned me away shud- 
dering. Crows, birds of evil omen, 
followers of executions! An old 
poem I had heard in my boyhood 
days came back to me out of the an- 
nals of years: 

“We sha.ll sit on his breast, 

On his broad manly breast, 

And pick his eyes out, one by one.” 

I shuddered and turned down the 
broader path. Surely the old cus- 
toms of ancient days survived here 
if nowhere else. Hanging a man at 
the crossroads! My thoughts were 
brought back to earth by the cracking 
of brash to my right. Evidently the 
wolf was still there. 

npHE moon rose over the forest, and 
the clouds raced across the face 
of it in the rising gale. They took 
odd shapes; one was shaped like a 
coffin, another took the form of some 
belated specter hurrying to keep 
some dark tryst on a ruined castle’s 
battlements, and one (I remember 
that very well) changed its shape in- 
to a skull with the moon’s pale rays 
glaring through the empty sockets. 



The shadows flung on the ground by 
the passage of these clouds also had 
dire and forebidding outlines. The 
entire scene was in keeping with the 
tales of the Hartz Mountains, of 
ghosts and hobgoblins, sheeted spec- 
ters and hooded horrors and all the 
evil spawn of hell that ran through 
the tales of ancient Germany. 

I hurried onward, hoping at every 
curve or at the top of every hill to 
catch the lights of the little town 
shining upon me, but instead the 
dark forest continued on and on and 
hemmed in my path. Several hours 
must have passed this way, and it 
was very close to midnight when I 
saw, shining through the trees, a light 
to the right of the path. Here was 
shelter from the coming storm, crude 
and homely shelter no doubt, but 
shelter for all of its crudeness, and 
with a lightened heart I hurried to- 
ward it. As I approached, a broader 
beam of light showed that someone 
had entered or left, and as I met no 
one along the pathway as I hurried 
up, I concluded the person had en- 
tered. 

To my wonder, on approaching I 
found the unmistakable outlines of 
an inn. How very good it looked ! I 
pictured the warmth and coziness of 
the great room within, for I was cold 
and chilled by the night air. I paused 
with my hand on the doorknob and 
looked at the crazy little signboard 
overhead. The moon came out from 
behind the clouds and sent a broad 
ray across it; and there, arranged in 
two rows of three each with a larger 
one in the center, were seven skulls! 

After the events of the night I was 
somewhat shaken by the sight of 
those seven little emblems of mor- 
tality that grinned down upon me in 
their deathly mirth, but as the rain 
was beginning to come down in tor- 
rents, I shrugged my shoulders and 
went in. Mine host might have his 
gruesome little joke, but his fire was 
what, I craved now, and if it was 



248 



WEIRD TALES 



good, why, the .sign would be per- 
haps the center of a tale about the 
roaring fireplace. 

Slamming the door against the 
wind that pushed with a thousand 
tiny hands as though demanding ad- 
mittance, I stood inside and blinked 
the rain and darkness out of my eyes. 
The great fire roared up the fireplace, 
lighting the room with a vivid fitful 
glow and showing me the contours of 
the several guests that were gathered 
near it. Ordinary peasants and for- 
esters they all seemed to be, and mine 
host, in -white apron and cap, came 
smiling toward me. 

“Welcome, mine friend/’ he said, 
in a throaty whisper, “the storm is 
indeed a bad one and you are very 
fortunate to have made my door. ’ ’ 

While thanking him for his offers 
of assistance and hospitality I looked 
at him carefully. His throat, I 
noticed, was wrapped with a heavy 
white cloth, sure sign of a bad cold, 
and this explained his queer way of 
speaking. His eyes protruded fear- 
fully from his face, a sign of in- 
ward goiter, so I had heard; but al- 
together he was such a kindly-ap- 
pearing person that I followed him, 
with thankful heart, to the fire’s 
warmth, the others making room for 
me. 

Food there was none, so I must 
perforce content myself with the re- 
mains of my lunch, to mine host’s ut- 
ter sorrow. However, as he brought 
me some really good Rhine wine, I 
could not object. His explanation 
was that this time of year his guests 
were scarce, yet for several days he 
had had such an influx that he was 
‘ ‘ eaten out of house and home. ’ ’ As 
I had plenty of food left over, I did 
not object, and I was telling him not 
to worry himself when a scratching 
began at the door. 

The tavern-keeper crossed to it hur- 
riedly and swung it wide, admitting, 
as he did so, the great white wolf that 
had stalked me through the woods. 



“My dear little girl,” he cried, 
“thou art overly late. Surely I have 
been very lonesome without thee. 

“My dog, mein Herr,” he contin- 
ued in explanation. “Savage to some, 
yes, but to me very gentle. ’ ’ 

He stroked the great white head 
lifted to him. 

“But what is this?” he cried. 
“Ach, my little darling has been 
wounded in the shoulder ! See, mein 
Herr, see how the blood has run. Ah, 
those charcoal-burners with their 
guns! Nothing is safe, nothing.” 
And he ran for warm water and 
towels to bathe the wound. 

I believed it better to keep silent 
as to my share in the episode, and sat 
watching him. The beast whimpered 
and cried, and then, when her mas- 
ter’s back was turned she swung up- 
on me her red eyes filled with hate 
and anger. I loosened the pistol in 
its holster, for dog or no dog, the 
great creature would die did it rush 
me. However, it went to the fire’s 
opposite side, as soon as the wound 
was dressed, and there stretched out 
at full length in the heat. 

My frugal repast being now fin- 
ished, I fell to studying the differ- 
ent travelers at the inn. There 
seemed something odd about them 
that I was at first unable to place. 
Then it dawned upon me: the cos- 
tumes — even in this very old world 
they seemed out of date. The cos- 
tumes of a century or two ago. I was 
delighted. This was romance ! I 
could not see their feet on account of 
the shadows, but I pictured them as 
being incased in long hose running 
to trunks, and surely those capes in 

the corner were of a pattern; 

“Ah, you sleep!” came the inn- 
keeper’s voice. “You are tired then. 
Come, let me show you to your room, 
mine guest.” 

It was true indeed that, soothed by 
the soft gutturals and the fire’s 
glow r , I must have slept, so I allowed 
him to light a candle and show me up 



THE SIGN OP THE SEVEN SKULLS 



240 



the narrow stairs in the back of the 
great room to my bedroom. 

'T'he rain had ceased, but the 
clouds still ran across the moon, 
drawing weird and fantastic shad- 
ows across the ground. Underneath 
me I could hear the voices and an oc- 
casional creak from the crazy sign. I 
bolted my door and sat by the win- 
dow watching their queer designs. 
Sleep seemed to have left me, and 
the room was bitterly cold, yet I did 
not mind either of these things, so 
engrossed had I become in the wild 
night scene without. 

Suddenly a scratch came at the 
bedroom door, bringing my thoughts 
back with a snap to the present. The 
great white wolf or dog had followed 
me! I sprang up and made sure of 
the door-fastening, and at the soimd 
of my footsteps it padded away limp- 
ingly. Poor beast! I was sorry I 
had shot it now, but I had no inclina- 
tion to explain matters, especially in 
that narrow room. 

I went back to the windows and 
stood looking out. Suddenly the 
candle behind me started to go out. 
With an impatient oath I turned 
about. The keeper had evidently 
given me a very short one, as he 
thought I would soon be asleep, I 
thought. But no, the candle was still 
quite long, and yet it was dying slow- 
ly as if for want of oxygen. Lower 
and lower went the light, and then 
suddenly flickered and went out. 
Quickly I struck a match and went 
toward the candle, but dropped the 
match when something seized my 
arm. At almost the same instant 
something else seized my leg, and 
then I was grasped by numberless 
little hands ill the dark. 

How can I describe that fight in 
the narrow room? I was filled with 
disgust and loathing as well as hor- 
ror. Little creatures they appeared 
to be, that tried to bear me down by 
weight of numbers. I sent my fist in- 



to faces and felt teeth loosen under 
the driving blows, hurled some from 
me and heard them strike with crash- 
ing force against the sides of the 
room, and I cracked skulls with the 
butt end of my revolver. Still I was 
forced back and back, for their num- 
ber seemed legion; and then, weak 
and worn out, I was forced to the 
bed and bent back and back until I 
was flung upon it. My shirt was torn 
open in the struggle, and I bled from 
a number of tiny wounds, yet still I 
fought grimly on with horror in my 
mind, horror of these unseen foemen. 

As my back touched the bed, the 
moon sprang out from behind a cloud 
and lay in a broad beam across me. 
The tiny silver cross caught and re- 
flected the rays — and suddenly, as 
it had commenced, the attack was 
withdrawn, my foemen vanished, if 
you can call people who were never, 
not even in the moonlight, visible, 
“vanished;” and slowly, as I lay 
spent and panting on the bed, the 
candle began to glow and finally 
sprang into life. 

Slowly I staggered to my feet and 
stumbled toward the door, seeking 
the companionship of those below. 
Under my feet I fell bodies — bodies 
perfectly invisible to me even in the 
lamplight. It never occurred to me 
until later that those below should 
have heard the row going on over 
their heads, or that even the dullest 
ears should have detected the up- 
roar, to which the smashed and bro- 
ken furniture gave testimony in that 
narrow room. 

With weakened steps I made my 
way down the dim hall and narrow 
stairs, and at the last turn I saw, with 
a glad heart, the great room leap into 
sight. 

“Mine host!” I cried; “mine 
host ! ’ ’ 

But then, after I descended the few 
remaining steps with a rush, my 
words choked in my throat and I 



250 



WEIRD TALES 



staggered to the wall, where I stood 
in horror. 

The room was lit by a red glow 
that seemed to have no source. The 
fire — or for that matter any fire ev- 
er built my man — could not have 
made the awful glaring red that filled 
the entire room. It seared and 
burned into the brain, bringing out 
every detail with startling distinct- 
ness, and the travelers who now 
swung slowly around to face me 
were not human. The faces were the 
faces of those long dead — dead that 
lived — the undead of a century long 
past. Those clothes were the doublets 
and liosen of long ago ! Long wicked 
swords hung at sides, the faces (ah, 
the faces ! ) were skulls — skulls picked 
clean and white by the grave-worm 
in moldering tombs. Only the sock- 
ets were filled with that reddish glare 
of hell that pervaded the entire room. 
The innkeeper’s eyes still protruded 
from his sockets, but the bandage of 
a few hours earlier was gone and his 
neck was twisted and broken ; the 
face was that of a newly hung man 
with the horror of death still upon 
it. Under my horror-stricken scru- 
tiny the lineaments changed and it 
became a skull, a horrid grinning 
skull like the others, only the twist- 
ed neck remaining awry and the 
vertebra^ showing jagged beneath the 
leering death-mask. 

A growl brought my terror-filled 
eyes to the white wolf that sat by the 
fire. Slowly it stood up on its hind 
legs like a trained animal and then, 
hellish and terrible, a transforma- 
tion took place. The body grew to a 
greater height, the long cruel snout 
vanished, the beastlike properties 
were slowly banished one by one and 
human lines took their places until 
a girl stood glaring at me. A girl, 
a demon from hell’s darkest pits, 
with eyes of reddish hate — a were- 
wolf, one of the truly undead. 

I crouched in my corner as the 
awful faces turned toward me, and 



drew my weapon. The -werewolf 
moved toward me, its right arm dang- 
ling, and then I sent shot after shot 
into the throng, to no avail. Bullets 
had failed and I was at the mercy of 
these leering horrors.. In fear and 
horror I ran my hand up my bosom 
toward my throat and felt, beneath 
my trembling fingers, the tiny cross. 
Swiftly I tore my shirt open and 
held the emblem toward them as I 
cried, “Back, back, you fiends! Evil 
I fear not!’’ 

The wolf recoiled, and the faces of 
the others turned toward each other 
as though in whispered consultation. 
So Death took council while a mad- 
man waving a silver cross faced his 
ranks. Slowly they arose and came 
toward me and formed a hideous 
circle in front of me. The things had 
decided, I suppose, to frighten me 
into dropping the little cross, and 
then 

I felt my senses going, my hand 
was trembling and dark little motes 
began dancing before my eyes, the 
walls reeled about me, and the only 
solid substance in the universe was 
that leering crowd of death-masks 
with the white, hate-filled face of the 
fiend in girlish form that ringed me 
in. The red light seemed to glow 
and then to fade as I fought for the 
mastery of my mind; a white glow 
flooded the scene, some-where I 
seemed to hear a cock crow, and then 
as { fell I heard a shriek as of some 
baffled fiend who hears the fall of a 
curtain of safety between it and the 
victim upon which its claws have 
been so nearly laid. 

T ate afternoon had come when I 

I I opened my eyes and found my- 
self on a rude cot in entirely differ- 
ent surroundings. An old man, 
whose face was kindly, rose from the 
fire and came toward me with some 
gruel in his hands. 



THE SIGN OF THE SEVEN SKULLS

“Drink this and sleep,” he said; 
“yon are in safe hands at last, my 
friend. ’ ’ 

For several days I tarried with the 
charcoal-burner and his stalwart son 
in the rude little shelter they called 
home and drew from them the tale 
of the inn and its occupants that I 
now set down. 

For years the inn had lain on a 
well-traveled thoroughfare in the 
Hartz Mountains, and well along- in 
the Sixteenth Century had been the 
stopping place for many a noble and 
knight. Then Karl the Terrible had 
bought it and gathered about him a 
crew of murderers and slayers. He 
was credited with having traffic with 
the devil, and his only sister had sur- 
passed him in all evil, finally becom- 
ing, so the story ran, a werewolf. 

Travelers were murdered by his 
creatures and their bodies hidden in 
the cellar. Tales of screams and 
cries were circulated until it came at 
length to the baron of the district, 
one Hoerlarin of Kraanstaadt. He 
at length, with a goodly gathering of 
men-at-arms and knights, had one 
day suddenly appeared at the inn 
and captured Karl and his men. The 
sister had escaped. 

The trial had been swift and sure, 
for very little digging brought the 
bones in the cellar to light. Punish- 
ment had followed as swiftly. The 
many followers had been tied to the 



beds of the inn and burned alive in 
its conflagration; Karl was taken to 
the crossroads and hung so that all 
might see and fear; but the sister 
was never found. 

The road fell into disuse even as 
the great castle at Kraanstaadt had 
crumbled and become dark. Yet the 
ruins of the inn, blackened and 
seared by the purging fire, still con- 
tained evil qualities; and there, 
night after night, had gathered the 
evil crew for ghastly carousals. 
Karl’s body swung at the old cross- 
roads until moonrise, when he de- 
scended and joined his old compan- 
ions; and often the white form of a 
werewolf was seen as it slipped be- 
tween the tree trunks toward the den 
of hell. 

In the blackened ruins I had been 
found, for the shots of the night be- 
fore had been heard and investigated 
by the two charcoal-burners. 

Perhaps I dreamed the horror; 
perhaps the people of the Hartz 
Mountains are merely superstitious 
yokels who frighten themselves with 
needless tales of horror ; perhaps you, 
the reader of this tale, will smile ; but 
I wonder what made my hair- turn 
white and why the little marks of 
claws upon my body have never left. 
I, for one, have never gone back to 
that haunted area, and I place my 
faith upon the beliefs of the strange 
peasants of the Hartz Mountains.

A Tale of the V olga Boatmen 



THE RIVER 

By AUGUST W. DERLETH 



Paviloff, Russia, 
7 May, 1926. 

Algernon E. Downes, Esq., 

21 St. James Row, 

London, England; 

Y DEAR Mr. Downes : — 

I am writing to let you 
know that I am resigning my 
position as foreman of the men work- 
ing on the dam here at Paviloff. My 
reason for so doing is a most unusual 
one indeed, and no doubt you will 
feel obliged to discredit it — nor can I 
blame you for doing so, for even I 
am tempted to disregard the indubit- 
able evidence of my own senses — so 
bizarre are the events that have led 
up to this culmination of my efforts 
here. Let me assure you, had I 
known of what I was facing at the 
outset of this project, ,1 should never 
have entered upon any contract with 
you. 

On the twenty-fourth of February 
last your representative, Mr. Solar 
Hamilton of Oxford, arrived to con- 
fer with Mr. Randeur and myself on 
the building of the dam across the 
Volga at this point. Present at this 
meeting w r as a Professor Sergei Bour- 
sky-Maminoff, late of the University 
of Moscow', and a former pupil of 
Metchnikoff. He was here to repre- 
sent the peasants of Paviloff and the 
surrounding country. Professor Bour- 
sky-Maminofif related the story of 
peculiar superstitions strongly be- 
lieved by the peasants, and he admit- 
ted that he also believed in them, ow- 
ing, he said, to certain curious hap- 
penings bordering directly on these 
252 



superstitions. Mr. Randeur scoffed 
at him, Mr. Hamilton enjoyed himself 
immensely throughout the professor’s 
entire relation, but these tales of his 
had an odd effect upon me from the 
beginning. 

It seems that the peasants believe 
the Volga River is guarded by spirits, 
who will rise up against us if we at- 
tempt to stay the course of the river 
in any manner. You will say, as did 
Randeur, that the idea is utterly pre- 
posterous. I admit that it does sound 
preposterous. Professor Boursky- 
Maminoff warned us repeatedly to go 
and leave the river, but Randeur 
could not consider the idea. Finally 
the professor departed in anger. I 
endeavored to argue with Randeur 
and Hamilton, but both of them ridi- 
culed me. At length Mr. Hamilton 
left, saying as he w r ent that if I did 
not wish to stay he would see that an- 
other man would be sent to fill the 
vacancy. Please notify Mr. Hamilton 
to supply that other man. 

God knows w'hat prompted Ran- 
deur to do so rash a thing, but he 
built his cottage on a little knoll al- 
.most directly in the course of the 
river. Everyone feared that if the 
dam should suddenly go out, Ran- 
deur ’s cottage would go out with it. 

One day not long ago, the twenty- 
seventh of April to be exact, as Pro- 
fessor Boursky-Maminoff stood on 
this knoll rebuking Randeur for his 
rash act, and again warning him to 
watch for the river spirits, a most 
repulsive hunchback approached the 
two men, screaming at the top of his 
voice, “The boatmen sing tonight. 




THE RIVER 



253 



The boatmen sing tonight.” This in 
itself was an odd occurrence, but it 
developed that the hunchback was 
quite mad, and so Randeur again 
scoffed at what the professor said. 
The boatmen that the hunchback re- 
ferred to are the fj hosts of those slav- 
ish men, or rather, half-men, half- 
beasts, who were treated as animals 
by the nobility of Russia; the men 
forced to pull the heavily laden boats 
of the nobility up the Volga. There 
are no such boatmen now, although 
they still existed in 1917. Randeur 
questioned Professor Boursky-Ma- 
minoff and he learned that the peas- 
ants believed that whenever the boat- 
men sing it is a sign of death. The pro- 
fessor told Randeur that their singing 
had never failed to bring death. Of 
course, you can well imagine what an 
effect this had on Randeur — none at 
all. He waved it away, but ! 

On the following day Randolph 
Smith, our best patrolman, apparent- 
ly accidentally fell from the frame- 
work at the extreme outer edge of the 
dam into the swirling current below, 
and was whisked away in the space of 
a moment. I say apparently, because 
we do not know. Randeur was 
stunned for a moment, but he blamed 
it upon coincidence.. However, he 
endeavored to keep it from Professor 
Boursky-Maminoff, but the professor 
heard of it and came directly to Ran- 
deur, and again implored him to cease 
his task. But Randeur would hear 
none of it. 

Last night while the professor was 
speaking to our manager, the hunch- 
back came again, shrieking his un- 
earthly warning. And even as he 
spoke, the professor paled, and mut- 
tered that he, too, heard them chant- 
ing in the distance ; and we looked at 
the river, but there was nothing there. 

And today, Mr. Downes, the entire 
left end of the dam has gone out, the 
stronger side, wiped out completely! 
And the men have all quit, but Ran- 
deur is still there ; he is going to build 
that dam, he says ! 



Hoping that you will soon find a 
man to fill the unfortunate vacancy 
left by me, I remain, 

Very cordially and sincerely yours, 
Nemo H. Lawlor. 

R andeur saw the last of his men 
leave him, and he moved angrily 
toward the cottage. He sat there 
some time, mumbling over his charts 
and plans. After a while he came 
out and looked about him : up at the 
remainder of the dam, and at the 
river flow T ing by as peacefully as ever, 
and at the sky to see if there were 
any signs of storm; but the sky was 
clear, and away in the distance in the 
purple haze about the mountains the 
full moon was rising. And he looked 
toward the town, and there he saw 
what he dreaded to see: the dark 
figure of the mad hunchback moving 
toward him over the sand. He stood 
very quietly until the figure came up 
to him. His eyes were wide with ex- 
citement, and his straggly hair 
framed a pockmarked face; his huge 
distended nose squatted above his 
thin, bloodless lips, like a vulture 
over some half-devoured corpse; his 
lips opened and closed as he came, 
and his three remaining teeth were 
displayed in their rotting gums; his 
clothes were dirty, ragged, and he 
wore neither shoes nor stockings. The 
ungainly hump on his back stuck out 
prominently. He spoke in a nervous 
frenzy of fury. 

‘ * The boatmen chant again tonight. 
Do you hear them? Death is in the 
air. Death ! And the river seethes in 
anger, and it will rise against you to- 
night. And you are alone in the path 
of the river ! Death ! ’ ’ 

Randeur cursed him, and raised his 
hand in a 'threatening gesture. The 
hunchback sped away, and as he ran, 
he shouted, and Randeur heard the 
ominous cry echo far jn the distance. 

“Death! Death! Death!” And a 
harsh laugh sounded after it, and 
Randeur shuddered.

WEIRD TALES 



/ 



It was fifteen minutes past 10 by 
Random- ’s -watch when it started. 
Randeur did not notice the splashing 
of the waves until after some time had 
passed. Then suddenly a shutter 
banged against the side of the cot- 
tage, and he started up from his blue- 
prints and peered anxiously out into 
the night. The full moon rode high 
in the sky, and there was not even a 
fleece in the blue as far as he could 
see. But the shutter had banged ; he 
had heard it. And even as he looked 
wonderingly out, the shutter banged 
against the house-wall for the second 
time, and immediately after another 
shutter banged, and another and an- 
other, until Randeur rushed madly 
for the door, but before he reached it, 
it was flung violently open. He 
halted for a moment; then ran out, 
and, turning, looked fearfully back 
at the accursed cottage. But now all 
was silent; the shutters sagged list- 
lessly on their ill-fastened hinges, and 
the door stood half open. There was 
no hint of a breeze; the night was 
oppressively hot. 

He stared at the cottage until some 
inner sense beating upon his mind 
turned his head slowly toward the 
river. And there he saw a multitude 
of white shapes, indistinguishable, 
fantastic, ominous. And as he looked 
at them moving slowly up the river 
toward the dam, he became conscious 
of a loud sound as of the beating of 
the waves, and he saw the river rise 
and swell, and a thousand white, 
foamy waves lashed the air in fury. 
And from some far point in the dis- 
tance came the low sound of a hymn. 

Randeur listened, terror-stricken. 
And as he stared at the white shapes 
almost at the dam, his ears seemed to 
open, and he heard in mighty chorus : 

“Upward, onward, we are one!” 

Randeur clapped his hands over his 
ears so that he might not hear that 
presentiment of death, the song of 
the Volga boatmen; but the toilers 



mocked his efforts, and raised their 
voices, and sang louder, louder, loud- 
er. And the waves rose higher and 
higher, and the song increased in vol- 
ume, and Randeur stood rooted to the 
ground upon the knoll on which he 
had foolishly supposed himself to be 
safe. 

Suddenly that same inner sense 
turned his head upward so that he 
could see the right side of the dam, 
and he saw it crumble and vanish in 
the upheaval of water that followed. 
And it seemed as if his eyes were sud- 
denly opened, for he saw the spirits of 
the river pushing the water toward 
him ; and he saw, too, the moon shin- 
ing tranquilly down upon the seeth- 
ing waters before he closed his eyes 
in a vain effort to shut out the scenes 
before him. And he heard the song 
of the boatmen, rising and falling, 
ominous, terrible: 

“Upward, onward, we are one!” 

“XTo sound, did I hear during the 
might, but the river has avenged 
itself for the wrong that has been 
done to it.” The professor pointed 
to the jagged spar that was caught in 
the crotch of a giant willow that stood 
upon the knoll where a cottage had 
once been. “It is all that is left of 
everything that has been here. Death 
has come and gone.” 

And from somewhere in back of the 
crowd of peasants that gazed in silent 
awe upon the calm river came the 
voice of the mad hunchback in wild 
echo to the professor: 

‘ ‘ Death ! Death ! Death. ’ ’ 

It was the mad hunchback who 
found Randeur two days later far 
down the river among the reeds and 
rushes that grew thickly there. Ran- 
deur ’s bloated face told of the ghastly 
things he had seen; his bloodless lips 
were parted and tightly drawn; his 
hair was torn as if in a frenzy of des- 
pair; and his widely opened eyes 
stared upward in mute, nameless hor- 
ror. 



Strange Power Had This Belt 
of Human Skin 



The Girdle 



By JOSEPH McCORD 



T HE pool of mottled light on 
the table-top had drifted over 
to where Sir John’s elawlike 
fingers, emerging from the silk sleeve 
of his dressing robe, drummed slowly 
on the black oak. 

Carson, erect on the hearth rug, 
had ignored the chair indicated by 
the fingers and was filled with a sud- 
den resentment as he sensed the in- 
different weariness of their tapping. 
And this old man was Pelham’s 
father! It was all so different than 
he had pictured. There w r as no fath- 
oming the expression of that mask- 
like face with its impenetrable stare, 
settled in the cushioned depths of the 
wheel chair. 

The heels of Carson’s boots came 
together with a suggestion of mili- 
tary stiffness, and he spoke curtly: 
“I confess I don’t understand.” 

And his host replied, in a curious- 
ly dry voice: ‘‘Perhaps it is not al- 
together necessary that you should.” 
The words carried a studied cour- 
tesy, but their veiled irony was not 
lost on the officer. 

“Granted. But Pelham was my 
friend — if he was your son — and I 

am here only because he asked ” 

“Of course,” interrupted Sir 
John. “Spare me the formula, if you 
will. He’s dead. It was arranged 
you should come and tell me how well 
he died. He was to perform the same 
service for you, no doubt, had the 
circumstances been reversed. The 
Pelhams always die well. It’s in the 
breed. If you insist, however ” 



Carson choked back his resentment. 
“There were circumstances that 
make it seem necessary — and 

yet ” 

“Pray get on.” 

“Then I’ll make it short.” Car- 
son advanced a little nearer the ta- 
ble. “It was in a little hut I last 
saw him — alive. Enemy ground, 

newly occupied it was, and here was 
this hut in a small clearing. It might 
have been a woodcutter’s and it was 
empty, save for some heavier furni- 
ture. 

“Several of us were poking about 
its one room, then Pel started up a 
crazy ladder at one end leading to a 
small loft. I heard him moving 
around and scratching matches, then 
he was quiet. I walked over near 
the ladder and hailed him. 

“ ‘Nothing up here but an old 
chest,’ he came back, ‘and empty at 
that.’ Then I heard him laugh. 
‘Somebody left me a Dutch Sam 
Browne — thought the cursed thing 
was a snake — felt cold!’ 

“I heard the lid of the chest fall, 
then Pel started down into the room. 
Part-way, he turned and faced me. 
He had the end of a belt in each 
hand, holding it behind him as if he 
were going to wear it. I didn’t no- 
tice that, though. All I saw was his 
face — the way he looked.” 

“The way he looked,” prompted 
Sir John, as the younger man stared 
at him soberly. “And, pray how did 
he look?” 



255

WEIRD TALES 



Carson seemed to pull himself to- 
gether with an effort. “That’s ex- 
actly what I have to tell you. I’ll 
try to.” He seated himself on the 
edge of the table, one booted foot 
swinging nervously. “Why, it was 
his eyes, I think — yes, that’s what it 
was. There was something in them 
that shouldn’t ever be in a man’s 
eyes. You’ve seen a dog that was 
vicious and a coward — all at the same 
time. He wants to go at your throat 
and something holds him for the mo- 
ment.” He drew a long breath. “It 
was like that, ’ ’ he decided. 

Sir John was watching one of his 
visitor’s hands; it had gripped the 
edge of the table and the knuckles 
were white. The boot was motion- 
less, tense. 

“As you say, like a dog. Well?” 

At the quiet words, the younger 
man relaxed. “Yes, sir,” he agreed 
gratefully. Then : “I spoke to him, 
and he never answered. He came on 
down the ladder, slowly — still facing 
us. The others were drawing up be- 
hind me — I could feel them. We all 
watched Pel. It wasn’t that he just 
moved slowly either — it was some- 
thing different. Slinking! I think 
that’s the way to say it. And he 
watched us — never blinked. No one 
said a word. 

“When Pel’s feet hit the floor, he 
began moving toward the door — it 
had come shut. He backed to it and 
began feeling for the latch with one 
hand, holding the belt all the time. 
He kicked the door open with his heel. 

“Then I knew. we were losing him 
— if you can understand what I mean 
— knew he’d got to be saved — from 
something ! ’ ’ 

Carson’s voice was curiously 
strained. 

“I wanted to stop him — I tell you 
I did want to! I tried. I started 
for him.” 

“And the belt?” interposed Sir 
John quietly. * 

“The belt,” echoed the other man 



dully. “Oh, yes. He held it all the 
while — I just told you that.” 

“But he escaped.” 

“He did. I had scarcely moved. 
He gave a dreadful sort of cry and 
leaped out of th<? doorway — back- 
ward. We rushed it then. But he 
had made the trees and we could hear 
him crashing through the under- 
growth, as though there hadn’t been 
a boche within a hundred miles of 
us. That’s how he went.” 

T he heavy silence that followed 
was broken only by a coal falling 
in the grate. With a long sigh, Car- 
son raised his head. He fumbled a 
pack of cigarettes, thrust one be- 
tween his lips, but made no move to 
light it. 

“I am waiting,” came the voice 
from the chair. • 

“Waiting?” 

“Come, come! You tell me my son 
is dead. If I recollect , you men- 
tioned gallantry. So far, you have 
suggested desertion. The details.” 
“Oh, yes. The details. But you 
won’t believe them. One would have 
to have seen.” 

“Have the kindness.” Sir John 
leaned back wearily among his cush- 
ions and closed his eyes. 

“Well. It was the third evening 
after that — I think it was the third. 
There had been an advance, a lot of 
machine-gun w T ork. It was growing 
dark, I remember. Harvey, my ser- 
geant, came up and asked if he could 
speak to me. ‘I’ve seen Lieutenant 
Pelham,’ he whispered queerlv. 

“ ‘He’s dead?’ I said. I knew he 
was dead. 

“ ‘Yes, lie’s dead, sir,’ says Har- 
vey, ‘but there’s something queer 
about him. Will you have a look?’ 
“He led the way and I followed.” 
Carson’s voice was becoming 
strained again. Sir John leaned for- 
ward and stared steadily into his 
eyes. 



THE GIRDLE 



257 



“We came to a little open place. 
There was some light there — enough 
to see the dreadfullest group God 
ever bunched in one place ! 

“First of all, I saw Pel — sitting 
with his back against a little tree, 
chin on his knees. He was staring 
straight to the front — dead. But 

around him! Five German infantry- 
men — dead too. Dragged into a sort 
of semicircle. And they weren’t 
shot and they weren’t gassed — noth- 
ing like that. Everyone had his 
throat tom! Torn!” 

Carson leaned close to the old man ; 
his voice shrilled as he demanded, al- 
most piteously, “You hear me, can’t 
you ? ’ ’ 

“They would be — torn,” said Sir 
John Pelham very quietly. “Finish 
your story.” 

The officer pulled himself together 
with an effort. “It makes it easier, 
having you understand. I’ve seen 
men ” 

He thrust the fingers of one hand 
into the collar of his tunic, as though 
it choked him. “I’ve seen men, sir, 
meet death in a thousand ways — but 
not, not that way! And Pel wasn’t 
marked at all — I looked.” 

The father leaned forward in his 
chair, but the gesture of interest was 
not reflected in his impassive face. 
“What of the belt?” 

“He wasn’t wearing it, but the 
thing was there — lying at his feet. 
And it was coiled ! ’ ’ 

“Show it to me.” 

“Why I — yes, I took it. I don’t 
know why. I dropped it in my kit bag 
— next day I got mine. I’m just out 
of the hospital by a month. Other- 
wise I’d have been here sooner.” 
With an unexpected clutch at the 
wheels' of his chair, Sir John was close 
to the ~ table, one white .hand ex- 
tended. 

“Give it me.” 

An instant ’s hesitation, then Car- 
son slowly pulled a paper-wrapped 



object from his pocket, laid it easily 
on the table. 

“It’s in there,” he muttered. “I 
don’t like tl^e damned thing.” 

With deft fingers, the bai’onet loos- 
ened the paper, shook the contents on 
the table. 

Therfe lay the leathern belt, coiled 
compactly. In the waning light it 
was of a pale brown color, thin and 
very flexible. On the other end was 
a metal clasp, its surface cut with 
marks that might or might not have 
been characters. There was a reading 
lens lying near and Sir John used it 
to study the coiled strap. He exam- 
ined it grimly, from many angles, 
without once touching it. Finished, 
he leaned back in his chair and 
thoughtfully tapped the palm of his 
hand with the lens. 

“Captain Carson.” 

“Sir.” 

“Attend most carefully to what I 
say — follow my instructions exactly. 
Take that belt in one hand only. 
Carry it to the hearth — lay it, directly 
on the coals. When it is burned, 
quite burned, you may tell me.” 

Carson got slowly to his feet. With 
a hand that hesitated and was none 
too steady, he reached for the coiled 
belt, lifted it a few inches from the 
table. At his touch, seemingly, the 
coil loosened ; it started to unroll. He 
caught at it with both hands. 

For a fraction of a second his body 
seemed caught in a strained tension. 
Then he began backing away from 
the table, noiselessly, furtively. With 
an end of the belt in each hand, he 
shifted his eyes to Sir John and they 
glowed with a strange,' sinister light. 
From his sagging jaw came his 
tongue, licking. 

Screaming an oath, Sir John Pel- 
ham flung the reading lens with all 
his frail strength full into that dis- 
torted face. 

“Drop it!” he bawled savagely. 
“Jarvis!” 



258 



WEIRD TALES 



At the call an elderly man-servant 
came hurrying. He saw his master 
supporting himself on the arms of 
the chair, trembling with the exer- 
tion, and staring curiously at the uni- 
formed visitor. Carson was swaying 
unsteadily, one hand pressed against 
his face, blood trickling from between 
his fingers. At his feet lay the belt 
and the shattered lens. Jarvis saw 
all this and took his post near Sir 
John, waiting his orders. 

“Jarvis.” 

“Yes, sir,” said the man-servant 
evenly. 

Sir John sank back wearily. 

“The tongs, Jarvis. Fetch the 
tongs. Pick up that strap. Only the 
tongs, mind you — don’t touch it with 
your hands. So. Now lay it on the 
coals — hold it down hard.” 

The three watched the burning in 
deep silence, watched the belt writhe 
and twist in the heat, scorch with 
flame, fall in charred fragments. 

“Jarvis.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Lights, then brandy for our guest. 
You may bring things and patch that 
cut for him.” To Carson: “Sit 

down, man, and pull yourself togeth- 
er. I regret I was obliged to strike 
you, but, under the circumstances, 
you will agree it was quite necessary, 
I think.” 

“I don’t understand,” muttered 
Carson dully. He slumped weakly 
into a near-by chair. “I’m — I felt — 
I don’t know.” His voice trailed off; 
his chin sagged on his breast. 

“You don’t wish to eat, by any 
chance ? ’ ’ 

“What made you ask that? God, 
no! I couldn’t cat — I only ” 

But Jarvis was offering him the 
brandy. 



“None for me,” said Sir John 
shortly. ‘ ‘ But you may help me over 
to the far case — I am looking for a 
book.” 

I n a few moments, Jarvis had 
wheeled him back to the table and 
he was leafing the pages of a small 
book he had found. It w r as bound in 
parchment and bore evidence of great 
age. Carson shiveringly helped him- 
self to another drink, as his host 
turned the crackling pages until he 
found what he sought. Tracing the 
lines with a lean forefinger, he read 
silently for a moment, then looked 
shrewdly at his guest. 

“This may interest you, Captain. 
Read here,” and he indicated the 
place. 

Carson slowly deciphered the 
strange script of the hand-printed 
page: 

Another means wherethrough men have 
become werewolves is that they in som 
mannere gotten a belt or girdel maked of 
human skin. By an autentvke eronicle a 
yoman hadde such a girdel which he kept 
locken in a eheste secrely. It so felle on 
a day that he let the eheste unlocken and 
his Ittel sono getteth the girdel and girteth 
his midel with it. In a minute the childe 
was transmewed into a mervilously wilde 
beste but the yoman fortuned to enter the 
house and with spede he remewed the girdel 
and so cured his sone who sayde he re- 
membered naught save a ravissing apepetyt. 

The book slipped from Carson’s 
nerveless fingers. Wide-eyed he stared 
into Sir John’s impassive face. 

When he could find the words : 
“God! You never mean — you 

couldn’t mean ” 

“I was in hopes,” mused the old 
man, “you know I was quite in hopes 
you would feel hungry.”

CHAPTER 25 

THE BATTLE OF THE ISTHMUS 

“rp HE battle ? ’ ’ said I. ‘ 4 That 
8 means, Delius, that your peo- 
JL pie have taken our advice 
and intend to fight for their lives in 
real earnest. Glad to hear it. ’ ’ 

“But we are not glad, Solitarians. 
The slaughter will be great — a neces- 
sity, it is true, but a most painful 
and sorrowful one. Yet the queen 
has decided upon instant and unstint- 
ed action, and those Elders who at- 
tended her council have approved her 
decision. Within an hour of her 
landing in Nadir the order was given 
and our forces set in motion, but not 
until we were despatched to your aid. 
We wirelessed you, but received no 
response. 

“Things are moving rapidly to the 
great crisis of our history. Though 
the Barbarians will have to go with- 
out Megalof, they are led by skilled 
generals, and are in overpowering 
numbers, and they intend to force 
the passage of the Isthmus of Cardi- 
ac, even at the cost of countless lives. 
Once they are masters of that strip 
of land between our two greatest 
continents, our civilized cities and 



plains, right up to the defenses of 
the Ridged Hills, are at their mercy. 
Ostrong, who would have us retire to 
the Hills at once, has been asked to 
resign from the council.” 

- “Resign! Only that and nothing 
more?” I cried. “The old scoundrel 
ought at least to be given penal servi- 
tude. ’ ’ 

Delius shook his head calmly. 

“I don’t know exactly what penal 
servitude is, but it is doubtless some- 
thing dreadful. We do not share 
your ideas of revenge, remember. Wo 
have virtually dismissed Ostrong 
from authority, but more than that 
we can not do. He acted according 
to his own judgment, and we think 
he was wrong, and that’s the end of 
it. A man of his proud spirit will 
suffer greatly from his sense of fail- 
ure.” 

“You Jovians are the limit,” said 
I. “All the same, I shall be very 
much surprized, from what I saw of 
Mr. Ostrong, if this is the end of it. 
I think there is quite a lot of natural, 
earthly malice about the old bird. ” 

“About the isthmus,” put in Mark. 
“You people, by virtue of the Heat 
Ray, are supreme on the water, 
though you don’t use it much. Can’t 
you sweep the isthmus from both 
sides, with rays from sea vessels ? ’ ’ 

‘ ‘ The shores w r e can keep that way, 
but the effective range of the Blue 
Ray is too short to reach half-way 
across the neck of land. And the 
Barbarians have lately used some 
great engines for throwing stones and 
baskets of flowing Green Fire,” re-

plied Oberon. “Machines on the lev- 
er and spring principle. By these 
things they have sunk some of our sea 
fleet, and even destroyed one of our 
airships. ’ ’ 

“Sounds interesting,” said Mark, 
yawning. ‘ ‘ But me for a good sleep. 
Wake me when we get there.” 

Dandy and I were just as sleepy, 
and while the airship sped on over 
forest and sea and plain, flying 
straight as an arrow to its mark, we 
went off into deep slumber. After 
our rough-and-tumble experiences in 
Malador, after a spell of short days 
and nights, it was quite easy. We 
were becoming used to the unusual , 
hardened to anything. 

They w T oke us when Nadir was in 
sight and the two vessels were sw r oop- 
ing clown to the landing area in the 
City of Spires. We had crossed the 
isthmus and the belt of smoking con- 
flict. As our speed slackened we 
threw open the doors and the busy 
sounds of life came up to us — the 
purr of traffic, the songs of fearless 
birds. And with the sounds, when 
we landed, came the faint, sweet 
perfume of flowers and blossoming 
fruit. 

“If they don’t fight 'for this, they 
deserve all they are likely to get!” 
was my unspoken comment. 

Delius smiled. 

“ It is very easy to read some kinds 
of thought,” he observed. “Have no 
fear for us, now that the queen has 
assumed command. Your advice, too, 
will be readily welcomed, more espec- 
ially since you risked your lives in 
saving her. You will find our Elders 
and scientists eager to work with you. 
It may be, as our wisest teachers are 
saying, that you strangers from an- 
other planet, have been sent by the 
Great Power of the universe to pre- 
serve our race in its horn' of peril.” 

“Steady with the bouquets!” I 
protested. “We have only handed 
you common sense. And here we 
are. ’ ’ 



We stepped out of the ship to meet 
a quiet, well-behaved, but neverthe- 
less very eager ci’owd of Jovian dig- 
nitaries and officers, among whom 
was the queen. Every few minutes 
swift motor vehicles, laden with re- 
charged ray-projectors, dashed out of 
the city to the battle line, fifty miles 
away. 

“ Already, Solitarians, ’ ’ said 
Queen Briseis, looking rather tender- 
ly at Mark, I fancied, ‘ ‘ we have acted 
upon some of your ideas and hints. 
Our war cars are holding back the 
Barbarians, and our warships of the 
water and air are attacking them. 
Within the last hour some of our 
chemists have manufactured an ex- 
plosive mixture that acts upon con- 
cussion. A hundred of what you call 
‘bombs’ are now ready, and thou- 
sands of our skilled workers are pro- 
ducing more. You shall see the fight 
for yourselves, for your presence will 
encourage our forces against the 
reckless bravery of the enemy. ’ ’ 

So, after much-needed refreshment 
and a bath in aromatic water from 
the municipal supply, we boarded an 
aerial warship for the isthmus. Our 
vessel carried a couple ef Heat Ray 
projectors and fifty of the new shells. 

“It like old times is,” said Prince 
Danda. “We might almost be back 
on Earth — setting out in airships to 
upon the foe drop bombs. It very 
homelike is!” 

T'n a few minutes we were hovering 
-*■ above the Isthmus of Cardiac, 
hanging high in air, surveying the 
scene through the transparent metal 
walls of our vessel. We were looking 
down upon the greatest battle in all 
the history of Jupiter. 

It was a strange sight. The isthmus 
was a narrow neck of land between 
two great continents and two great 
oceans. To east and west stretched 
land; to north and south, as far as 
the eye could see, a glittering expanse 
of water. Across this narrow, all-im- 



THE STAR SHELL 



261 



portant strip, the fight raged. From 
eastward poured the Barbarians, a 
surging flood of rough, sinewy, prim- 
itively armed humanity. The west- 
ward end of the isthmus was held by 
the civilized Jovians, equipped with 
weapons far superior, but in numbers 
far less. 

It wasn’t a bit like France or 
Flanders or the Dardanelles. There 
were no lines of trenches, no dugouts, 
no shell-holes, no wire entanglements, 
no bursting shells, no humming air- 
planes. 

There were rows of isolated forts — 
rows of low, white domes — from each 
of which flashed the deadly Blue 
Rays. Against and between these 
domed forts the flood of Barbarians 
pressed. They were reckless to the 
verge of frenzy, flung themselves for- 
ward as though perfectly careless of 
life. Already, behind their front, lay 
three rows of the forts, captured or 
destroyed, and only two rows re- 
mained. Green Fire smoked all across 
the isthmus, was carried forward by 
thousands of men in little braziers, 
was hurled at the forts by huge cata- 
pults. In and out of the line of forts, 
assisting their effect, dashed the war- 
cars, opposing the Blue Ray to the 
Green Fire. From each side of the 
isthmus, sea vessels kept the shores 
elear, and airships, armed like our 
own, save for the bombs, swooped low, 
plowing lanes of death across the 
savage hordes with their burning 
rays. But though the advancing Bar- 
barians fell by thousands, tens of 
thousands pushed the front ranks on. 

“Never have they fought like this 
before,” said Delius, who had come 
with us. “They are enraged that we 
are withstanding them so stubbornly 
after their many victories. If we can 
not hold them back till the frenzy 
passes, I fear we are lost. ’ ’ 

“Your race is paying for its past 
weakness,” said Mark. “You have 
given way before them so often that 



they have come to think themselves 
invincible. ” 

“Anyhow, we will try the effect of 
our sort of fighting now,” I said. 
“Put us across the isthmus slowly, 
Delius.” 

Just as I spoke, a whirling mass 
of fire, shot from a gigantic throwing- 
machine, caught one of the low- 
swooping airships. The shock caused 
the vessel to turn turtle, and she fell 
to the ground, green flames curling 
round her. 

“We are too high for that danger, 
but not too high to avenge the loss,” 
cried Dandy, hurling out the first 
bomb. “Ah, that most surprizing 
is!” 

We had not yet witnessed the effect 
of the new explosive, nor were we pre- 
pared for the result of the Jovian 
chemists ’ first venture, though we 
knew its action would have to be 
strong to overcome the greater grav- 
itation of the big planet. 

It was strong. There was first a 
blinding flash of light that seemed to 
scorch our eyes, then a huge upheav- 
al of the ground, a volcanic burst of 
smoke, and then a quiver of the air, a 
roar of noise that shook the airship 
in every bolt and plate, and made 
our ear-drums throb with intense 
agony. 

And when the smoke cloud blew 
away in the gale, there was a shell- 
hole big enough to bury a dozen 
houses. Hundreds of dead Barbar- 
ians lay around the edge of the jag- 
ged pit, and three of the catapults 
were smashed to fragments. 

“It knocks T. N. T. into a cocked 
hat!” I shouted. “This stuff will 
win the war.” 

“But it is terrible, awful, nerve- 
racking,” said Delius, shuddering 
and closing his eyes. “The butch- 
ery — the slaughter!” 

“It is now or never — their lives or 
yours — civilization or barbarism, ’ ’ 
said Mark. “Ready, Harry? Then

overboard with the steel pills — dose, 
one every ten minutes. Let go ! ’ ’ 

And across the isthmus we sailed, 
dropping down our rain of death. 

CHAPTER 26 

OSTRONG’S VENGEANCE 

r T''wicE we crossed the Isthmus of 
^ Cardiac, dropping our bombs in- 
to the smoking battle line, and before 
the last shell had torn up the tortured 
ground the battle was won. Civiliza- 
tion had triumphed on Jupiter at 
last. 

After the sudden scare of the first 
explosion, the Barbarians rallied 
gamely, rushing forward more fran- 
tically than before, shooting flights 
of arrows into the sky in vain rage, 
but they could not stand the repeat- 
ed shocks. Their lines broken, their 
catapults destroyed, hundreds of 
them blown to bits with every shell- 
burst, and the swooping airships 
sweeping the fierce Blue Rays over 
them ceaselessly, they gave way at 
last, lost their nerve, and throwing 
down their weapons as they went, 
trampling underfoot the officers who 
would have stayed them, ran away in 
headlong panic. The eivilized Jo- 
vians roused for once to energetic ac- 
tion, pursued the struggling hordes 
by air and land, and we dropped our 
last bomb in the thickest part of the 
beaten mob. 

Then we went back for another 
supply, and dropped fifty more shells 
amongst the routed savages. At 
least, it ought to have been fifty: 
counting them, I only made it forty- 
nine. 

When the pursuit eeased, the Bar- 
- barians had been driven wholly elear 
of the disputed neck of land. The 
Isthmus of Cardiac was safe in eivil- 
ized keeping, aixd the city Nadir, the 
lovely city of sweet gardens and 
tapering spires, was once more secure. 

My story of the next few days must 
be rather short and serappv. It isn’t 



so easy to live all the time in the lime- 
light, so to speak, and it’s rather em- 
barrassing to sing one’s own praises, 
even at second hand. As I said, one 
evening, when we three were alone 
for a few minutes: “Snakes and 

tigers, Mark! We are now and for- 
ever the Big Noise here. If we 
weren’t extremely modest, and the 
Jovians weren’t really civilized, our 
heads would be bulging like bal- 
loons ! ’ ’ 

“And if wo weneaa’t kept so busy 
as well, Harry. I know you two are 
about sick of it all, and ready for 
home, but you will have to grin and 
bear with your Jovian V. C.’s and 
O. B. E. ’s a little longer. For .one 
thing , as Jupiter and the Earth have 
moved in their orbits since we ar- 
rived, they are not in a good position 
for the return journey. If we start 
at a wrong time, or in too great a 
hurry, we might not be able to stop, 
or to reach the Earth — we might drop 
into the sun and be frizzled up. And 
there is Norden to consider. He is a 
problem. He says he won’t return, 
and we can hardly compel him. Nor 
caii we leave him here. Then there is 
our work — the completion of the 
•isthmus defenses, the casting of the 
big guns, the starting of the small- 
arms factory. Besides all this, I’m 
simply reveling in interesting discov- 
eries, soaking up science from our 
learned friends. And you must ad- 
mit that they are making us very 
comfortable. ’ ’ 

‘ ‘ Especially the queen, ’ ’ I grinned. 
“Wed, if you want to stay here, we 
certainly can’t go without you. All 
the same, the novelty is wearing off, 
and we are feeling a bit homesick for 
the Earth. These folks are all right 
in their way — they can ’t do too much 
for us because we happened to come 
along and give them a helping hand 
— but, after all, we are out of our 
element here. We have not tasted 
meat for a week, nor had a smoke, 
nor seen a policeman, nor read a 



THE STAR SHELL 



263 



newspaper, nor played any sort of 
game. When you blow the engine 
whistle, Markie boy, we shall have our 
tickets ready!” 

“Norden is indeed a problem,” re- 
marked Prince Danda. “It me an- 
noys that he is at liberty, as well as 
old Ostrong. They much together 
are, and often with the Barbarian 
prisoners are confabbing. They plan 
mischief, I much fear..” 

“It’s plain the old chap has never 
forgiven us for bucking up his race 
to fight and win, ’ ’ said I. ‘ ‘ He would 
rather stick to the old tradition that 
it is more civilized to die in innocence 
than to live in forcible triumph. We 
must watch him.” 

“But what can he do, or Norden 
either ? ’ ’ asked Mark. 

We didn’t know, we couldn’t 
imagine. We were destined to find 
out later to what depths of evil a per- 
verted virtue may descend. 

In the meantime we had a feast of 
enjoyable experiences, even while we 
cast longing thoughts across the black 
void to the distant little planet of our 
birth — the twinkling little star we 
saw but now and then in the evening 
twilight, through brief rifts in the 
heavy clouds that enwrapped giant 
Jupiter. 

Though the Jovians were so ex- 
tremely scientific and civilized, their 
home lives were simple. They had 
very little personal luxury, and dur- 
ing the whole of our stay on the plan- 
et we never saw any signs of poverty 
amongst our hosts. Everyone worked 
at something, everyone seemed to 
, have enough to eat, drink and wear, 
and the public services of lighting, 
heating, water supply, transport, san- 
itation and amusement were wonder- 
fully efficient. Strikes were un- 
known. 

I have told you of their natural- 
color pictures. We were shown mar- 
velous glimpses of scenery on the 
scene, and later, in their express 



airships, we were shown the scenery 
itself. 

I could write pages and pages of 
description of the lovely river valleys, 
the sandy shores and rocky coasts, the 
ranges of forest-clad hills, the vast 
deserts, the regions of bubbling gey- 
sers and fiery volcanos, that diversi- 
fied the surface of Jupiter, but you 
might not be as interested in the 
reading of them as we were in see- 
ing them. Even we grew tired of 
travel, of sight-seeing, and presently 
we had something else to think about. 

Delius took Mark aside one eve- 
ning, very mysteriously, and after 
they had had a long conversation, my 
chum came over to Dandy and me, 
looking rather red in the face. Wc 
didn’t need to put our question into 
words. 

“I shall have to tell you two what 
Delius has been saying,” poor old 
Mark jerked out, “so I may as well 
get it over. It’s about the queen 
and Ostrong — and me. It seems old 
Ostrong had his eyes on the queen — 
thought he was going to marry her, 
in fact. She turned him down, of 
course, being a sensible woman. The 
mischief is ” 

“That she has taken a fancy to you 
instead, and you don’t altogether dis- 
like the idea,” I finished for him. 

“I’m afraid that’s the size of it,” 
admitted Mark. “At least, as to the 
first item. You can leave me out of 
this, if you please. It puts us in an 
awkward position. Osti’ong has his 
knife into us now for more reasons 
than one. We ought to be off home 
before the mischief goes any farther, 
for even. I — well, even if I wanted to 
marry Briseis, the thing’s impossible. 
She is much older than I am, the dif- 
ference between our races is enor- 
mous, and the council would not al- 
low it. They have actually had meet- 
ings and discussed the whole business 
in all its bearings. Ugh ! ” 

“Cheer up, old pal,” I said. “It 
isn’t everybody who jumps several 



264 



WEIRD TALES 



hundred million miles to find his 
queen! It is hard lines not to be al- 
lowed to become a king, but I agree 
with our friends that the idea is pre- 
posterous. Fact is, we had better 
leave. ’ ’ 

“That also do I think,” added 
Prince Danda. “My people in India 
will for me be looking soon.” 

“I have told Delius we shall go,” 
said Mark, with a sigh. “The Star 
Shell is quite repaired, ready fitted 
and fully provisioned. As I told you 
a few days ago, it is the positions of 
the Earth and Jupiter that do not 
make the journey suitable or safe at 
present. I am going into the details 
with their astronomical experts to- 
morrow. It may be necessary to wait 
a couple of months for the chance of 
starting the trip with any degree of 
certainty. ’ ’ 

We had to let it go at that, but the 
thought was disturbing, and not one 
of us slept well that night. 

npHE guest house that had been 
placed at our disposal was a nice 
little bungalow sort of building in the 
suburbs of Nadir, where, after dark- 
ness fell, there w r as scarcely a sound 
to break the restful peace of the 
night. In the long sleeping apart- 
ment we each had hammocks in cur- 
tained recesses. I had dozed off for 
the third time when a sudden tap- 
ping at the metal window roused me 
with a jerk. I pressed the switch 
that made the metal sheets transpar- 
ent, and another that flooded the big 
room with light. 

Professor Norden was at the win- 
dow, beckoning, apparently in a state 
of considerable excitement. I threw 
on a few rags, roused the others and 
let him in. 

“No time to lose if you want to 
help!” he cried, anxiously. “He’s go- 
ing to destroy it ! ” 

“Destroy what, Norden ? Who?” 
asked Mark, roughly. 

The fellow had kept out of our way 



persistently since our return from 
Matador and the Red Forest. 

“The Shell! The Star Shell!” the 
professor shouted, in a sort of frenzy. 
“Ostrong. Wanted me to assist him. 
Afterward he was going to give you 
another space-ship, one that would 
come to grief when on the way back 
to Earth. He has some of the prison- 
ers helping him. I couldn’t do it, so 
I came to warn you. Quick ! I have a 
car waiting. ’ ’ » 

“Better telephone the authorities 
fii’st,” I suggested. 

‘ ‘ I have already done so, ’ ’ cried the 
professor. ‘ * Come, there is no time to 
waste. ’ ’ 

Half asleep yet, and taken off our 
guard by his manner, we rushed out 
of the house and followed Norden in- 
to the auto. A swift run through 
dark and silent avenues brought us 
to the aerial landing ground, the 
professor talking fast and furiously 
all the way. He was a clever scoun- 
drel. 

As we stepped out of the auto, at 
the base of the Star Shell, we thought 
we were ready for any emergency. 
We expected to find a fight going on 
between the aero guards and Barbar- 
ian prisoners. 

All was quiet, black and still and 
eery as night, but as our feet touched 
the ground a swarm of dark figures 
rose up and materialized out of every 
dense shadow. In a few minutes, in 
spite of our struggles, we were all 
helpless in the grasp of sinewy Bar- 
barians. An increasing crowd of the 
menacing prisoners gathered round. 
From another car, which had followed 
ours, Ostrong stepped alone. The 
glare of the solitary electric lamp 
that lit the open space gleamed odd- 
ly on his mop of silver-gray hair. He 
smiled grimly-, and lost no time get- 
ting to the point. 

“You ai-e indeed wonderful beings, 
Solitarians, but the end of your in- 
terference has come at last. You 
have misled my people. You have 



THE STAR SHELL 



265 



demoralized their moral nature in or- 
der to gain for them a material ad- 
vantage. If you remain alive we may 
indeed conquer the whole of our plan- 
et, but our race would lose its soul, 
would cease to be truly civilized. 
You must die, and perhaps my influ- 
ence may yet prevail. Prisoners, do 
your work. ’ ’ 

Our captors pushed us toward the 
Star Shell, Norden with us, in spite 
of his protests and struggles. They 
crowded upon us, each man carrying 
a block of some dark substance. 
Whilst some held us rigidly, others 
built up these blocks into a roughly 
circular wall around both us and the 
Shell. The wall grew as if by magic, 
built by hundreds of willing hands. 
Soon it was up to our waists, and 
then those who were holding us freed 
themselves and vaulted over. We 
could not follow, for everywhere we 
met the points of swords and spears. 
And still, in silence and semi-dark- 
ness, the wall grew. Norden shouted 
angry questions, but no one ans- 
wered him.. 

“What’s the idea, Ostrong?” 
asked Mark, quietly. 

“It is quite simple, Solitarian,” 
was the old man’s reply. “This wall 
is built of blocks of the green metal, 
collected from the battlefield by the 
prisoners, at my suggestion. Present- 
ly we shall set it blazing, and soon 
after sunrise nothing will remain of 
you and your space-ship but a heap 
of smoldering embers. There is no 
escape; you can receive no help.” 

CHAPTER 27 

THE STAR SHELL STARTS 
FOR HOME 

“ Y>tit why am I here?” screamed 
the professor, in terrified rage. 
“I am no friend of these others. I 
have not helped them; I have helped 
you in all your plans. But for me, 
you would not have lured them here 



so easily. Let me come out! — let me 
out ! ’ ’ 

“Shut up, you miserable bound- 
er,” said I. “You have been a tool 
for the old villain, and now he has 
no further use for you. That’s all.” 

“You speak truly, Solitarian,” ob- 
served Ostrong, smiling. “One uses 
dangerous tools at times, but one 
throws them away afterward. I have 
quite done with Mr. Norden. Jupiter 
will be well rid of you all.” 

“And of me, especially, Elder,’.’ 
added Mark, “though I doubt 
whether the queen will tolerate your 
existence after this night.” 

“At any rate, stranger, she will 
never look at you again,” was the 
vindictive reply of the old man. 
“Light the fires, Barbarians! You 
will be revenged on the worst enemies 
of your race, and I shall see the end 
of those who would corrupt the soul 
of my people. Light the fires ! In a 
few minutes they will be beyond all 
help, even if the whole city be roused 
to try and save them. Light the 
fires!” 

Those were the last words we heard 
spoken by an inhabitant of Jupiter. 
The crowd of Barbarians had gone 
about their work eagerly, but grimly 
silent, and in the same grim silence 
they kindled sparks and set the green 
metal blazing in a score of places. 
With lightning rapidity the flames 
spread, curling in bright green waves 
over the encircling wall, pouring in 
greet! cascades between the loosely 
piled blocks. Volumes of green smoke 
rose lazily to the dark sky. 

We were cut off from everything 
by a ring of smoke and flame. Pale 
green tongues of fire came reaching' 
inward, licking up the dry herbage, 
greedily stretching out toward us 
and the Shell. The affair was well 
planned, well carried out. Before 
long, we knew, from what we had 
seen of the radio-flaming of the Green 
Metal, everything within that terrible 
circle would be utterly consumed. 



266 



WEIRD TALES 



“We had better jump through it 
and die fighting, ’ ’ said I, in despera- 
tion. 

“That I think also,” said Dandy. 
“I am ready.” 

Norden, in a frenzy of she'er ter- 
ror, groveled on the ground at the 
base of the Shell , moaning and groan- 
ing. We took no notice of him. 

‘ ‘ There is a better way out, though 
it is a risky one, ’ ’ said Mark. 
“Ostrong did not calculate every- 
thing. Into the Shell with you all!” 

It was now getting so uncomfort- 
ably hot, and the smoke so pungent, 
that we lost no time hopping up the 
stairs. Mark was the last. On the 
threshold of the doorway lie stopped. 

“We can’t leave Norden down 
there, you chaps, can we? He will 
have to come along and take his 
chance with us.” 

So back we went for the professor, 
all of us coughing with the smoke, 
and smarting from the rain of sparks 
that swirled around us. Norden was 
not grateful; he was too scared to 
move. When we insisted, he yelled, 
screamed, cried that the Star Shell 
was a death-trap, struggled like a 
madman. Finally, I gave him a tap 
on the head to keep him quiet, and 
we carried him bodily up the steps. 

Just at the top he recovered, had 
another fit, and fought us with the 
ferocity of a wild beast.. As fast as 
he got an ami or a leg at liberty, he 
clung to the doorway like a limpet. 
And all the time we wrestled with 
him, the ring of Green Fire grew 
hotter, the flames higher. 

At last we forced him in, 'and 
whilst Dandy and I held him down, 
Mark closed the air-tight double 
doors. Tt was like shutting ourselves 
in an oven. 

“We can’t delay our start very 
long,” said Mark, mopping his brow, 
“or we shall be cooked alive. All the 
same, we can’t start just yet.” 

“Why not?” we asked. 

“Because we must wait for sun- 



rise. Supposing we started in the 
dark— we should be going right away 
from home, flying out into the awful 
void of outer space beyond the orbit 
of Jupiter. No; we must wait till 
the sun comes up.” 

“If our glass windows can stand 
the heat without cracking,” said I. 
“Whew! If we can stand it.” 

Dandy, his brown skin glistening 
with perspiration, kept a tight lip. 
Professor Norden, still in the grip of 
fear, went on groaning. Mark stud- 
ied his registers. He announced that 
we had enough air in the cylinders 
for the long trip — no more, no mar- 
gin for much delay. 

The Shell grew hotter, more sti- 
fling. The windows were squares of 
leaping and flickering green radiance. 
The padding of the inner walls was 
uncomfortably warm to the touch. I 
began to feel dizzy, sickly, limp as 
a boiled rag. 

“It won’t bcr dawn for twenty 
minutes,” said Mark, consulting his 
watch. “The metal of the Shell 
must be nearly red-hot now. It will 
be a race against time — a race be- 
tween the rising temperature and the 
rising sun. Before the Shell reaches 
white heat, we must go, at any risk. 
Be ready.” 

The horror of that next twenty 
minutes will remain in my memory 
as long as I live. Often, on hot sum- 
mer nights, I wake up, bathed in 
perspiration, crying out to Mark to 
“let her go!” 

To the subdued murmur of the en- 
circling fire was now suddenly added 
a few faint, fresh sounds, and now 
and then, mingling with the leaping 
green glare, came stray flashes of blue 
light. 

We knew what that meant. The fire 
had been seen in the city, and the 
queen had sent to our assistance. 
Our attackers were themselves being 
attacked. 

“But I am afraid it is too late,” 
said Mark. “We shall not be able to 



THE STAR SHELL

stay much longer. If the ther- 
mometer rises ten more degrees, I 
shall cut off the gravitation of Jupi- 
ter, and then it may be good-bye to 
the giant planet forever!” 

"Ten degrees!” groaned Dandy. 
"Already I cooked am!” 

I was too far gone to utter a word. 

We waited, lying about in helpless 
misery. Only Mark, upheld by his 
clear brain and strong will, kept on 
his feet. His hands rested on the 
fateful little levers that would hurl 
the Star Shell into the black abyss 
between the worlds ; he had eyes only 
for the thermometer and the wateh on 
the table before him. 

"The sun is rising!” he cried at 
last. "You can't see it for the heavy 
clouds, but I know it’s there. A lit- 
tle longer, so that it may get higher 
in the sky, and then we are off. 
Seven degrees.” 

I had no sensations save for a fieree 
craving for a breath of cool, fresh 
air. 

"Nine degrees!” said Mark, warn- 
ingly.. 

At that moment, with a wild yell, 
Professor Norden sprang to his feet 
and rushed to the door, throwing his 
weight on the opening lever. 

"Air! Air!” he shouted. "Let me 
have air!” 

"Hold him, you two,” cried Mark. 
"Keep him fast. We are off!” 

It is wonderful how you can find 
strength and activity in a crisis. We 
collared Norden and hung on to him 
like leeches. He fought with the 
ferocity of a wildcat, but after a ter- 
rible two minutes we pulled him 
away from the door and got him 
down. Then we tied him, hands and 
feet. And as we got up, panting, 
exhausted, Mark pushed over the 
starting lever. Once more, owing to 
Professor Norden, the Star Shell was 
shot into space at an unchosen mo- 
ment. 

An extra blast of heat grilled up, 
a roar of sound engulfed us, we 



seemed pressed into the floor by tons 
of weight, and then, in a deathly 
silence, a silence as sudden as the 
outbreak of the tempest of sound, we 
all fainted clean away. 

The Star Shell had left Jupiter, 
had passed through that heavy atmos- 
phere, was out in the vacancy of 
space, was shooting, with a velocity 
unthinkable, sunward and Earth- 
ward. But would our journey’s end 
be the fiery cauldron of the glowing 
sun, or the dear, familiar planet of 
our birth? 

CHAPTER 28 

NORDEN ’S FINAL TREACHERY 

'\X7'hen, thoroughly bruised, sha- 
* ’ ken and trembling, stiff and 
sore all over, we came to our senses 
one by one, the Star Shell was mil- 
lions of miles away from Jupiter. 
The vast globe of the skv was deep- 
black, crusted with the many-colored 
stars and circled with the shining 
band of the Milky Way. Below us 
shone Jupiter, already dwindling in 
size, and above us glowed the sun, 
glaring unshadedly across the terrible 
void.. 

Mark, consulting his indicators, 
shook his head. 

"When I cut off the gravitation of 
Jupiter,” he said, “the etheric pull 
drove us away from the planet. Now 
we arc going in his direction, the at- 
traction of the sun himself is increas- 
ing our velocity. The pointer on the 
dial is again invisible. How many 
million miles an hour we are going I 
can not even guess. ’ ’ 

“Seems to me you will have to 
slip in the reverse clutch, then,” I 
ventured. "Put on Jupiter’s pull 
again and try to slow down before 
we overshoot our mark. I don ’t want 
to explore the sun. I have seen quite 
enough of the solar system to satisfy 
my curiosity for a long time.” 

"I have already done that, Har- 
ry, and yet we got such a flying start 



268 



WEIRD TALES 



that the speed doesn’t seem to be 
checked at all. We must be half-way 
across the zone of the asteroids al- 
ready — and you had better pray we 
don’t hit one. And there’s Mars — to 
westward — and there’s the Earth and 
its moon. One thing I am pleased 
with — we are heading more nearly 
straight for home than I dared to ex- 
pect.” 

‘ ‘ Then nothing is there that we can 
do but wait?” asked Prince Danda 
Singh. 

“Nothing. Later, I shall be able to 
tell you more definitely what our 
chances are. Better let Norden loose 
now; he won’t be likely to do any 
more harm.” 

We untied the treacherous profes- 
sor and helped him to his feet. He 
was white with fear, and the first 
symptoms of space-sickness were grip- 
ping him. He smiled weakly. 

“I’m sorry, gentlemen,” he said. 
“I’ve been a very poor sort of friend, 
but I beg you to believe that I am 
sorry. I must have been mad. Let 
bygones be bygones.” 

“We shall trust you as far as we 
can see you, and not an inch farther, 
Norden,” said I. “When we get 
back — if ever we get back — there 
must be a reckoning with you.” 

And then the pangs and nausea of 
space-sickness claimed us all for 
awhile, and we forgot everything else 
in the deadly agony of that inde- 
scribable malady. When, hours later, 
it passed, and we began to recover, 
' we had reached the orbit of Mars. 
The needle was showing as a quiver- 
ing blur on the indicator dial. An- 
other nine or ten hours, at gradually 
lessening speed, should see us some- 
where near the Earth, and our fate 
would be decided. 

Now that we were nearing home, 
my thoughts went back, rather long- 
ingly, rather regretfully, to the giant 
planet -we had been obliged to leave 
so suddenly. In spite of our hair- 
raising experiences there, I felt a 



sense of loss, a twinge of sorrow, at 
departure. 

I should have liked to see more of 
that wonderful world of vast con- 
tinents and silvery seas, of dense 
clouds and terrific storms. I found, 
now that I had left them, that I had 
grown to like its civilized people, 
their gentleness, their good nature, 
their marvelous science. I wanted to 
know how the long fight between 
them and the Barbarians would go 
on in the years to come. Above all, 
I wanted to see the city Nadir again 
— to look on its forest of tapering 
spires, its smooth roads busy with 
traffic, its gay gardens gorgeous with 
flowers and bloom, sweet with scent 
and musical with the songs of fear- 
less birds. 

It was some slight satisfaction, in- 
deed, to remember that we had been 
helpful in the war, that we had res- 
cued Queen Briseis from the hands 
of Megalof, and that the Battle of 
the Isthmus had been fought and 
won. 

If we reached the Earth safely, I 
said to myself, it would almost be 
worth while trying to make the great 
journey again. Almost! 

At last came the critical moment. 
We gathered round Mark, who had 
his hands on the controlling levers. 
He had to check our speed by cutting 
off and putting on, in turns, the at- 
tractions of the Earth and moon and 
sun, and so endeavor to bring the 
Shell into the atmosphere at the right 
angle. 

“I think we shall do it, but it will 
be touch and go with us,” said Mark. 
“I have her down to a few thousand 
miles an hour, and I hope to dive in- 
to the air in the same direction as the 
rotation of the Earth. That will less- 
en the jar for us — as a fielder, you 
know, in catching a fast one, lets his 
hands travel the same way as the 
ball.” 

“Where shall we land?” asked 
Norden, strangely meek. 



THE STAR SHELL 



269 



“Impossible to say,” replied Mark. 
“We are approaching the night side 
of the Eai’th. “Hold on, all of you. 
A few more, minutes will settle every- 
thing for us. We are dropping fast. 
No — yes ! The speed is falling. Hur- 
rah! We are home!” 

The Star Shell plunged into the 
Earth’s atmosphere as he spoke. The 
scream of its passage nearly deafened 
us, the heat caused by the swift fric- 
tion gave us another Turkish bath. 
But the resistance of the air quickly 
reduced our speed, and it was quite 
gently that we dropped into the sea. 

We knew we had fallen into the 
sea, for our progress was suddenly 
stopped, and a froth of boiling wat- 
er, heated by the glowing metal walls 
of the Shell, hissed all around us. 
Then we went up again on the re- 
bound, and after a few more plunges 
the great projectile lay rolling on the 
surface aimlessly as a floating cork. 

Seized in the grip of some strong 
force, it was carried forward, turning 
over and over, grounded raspingly, 
was lifted again, and left, motionless 
at last, above low water mark. A con- 
stant noise, like the regular booming 
of heavy guns, filled our ears. 

The door happened to be upper- 
most.. We flung it open eagerly and 
crawled out upon the top of the Shell. 
One glance told us where we had hit 
the homeward trail. 

Tim Shell lay on the coral shore of 
a tiny atoll. The sound we heard -was 
the roar of the surf on the bar. 

“We have fallen on a Pacific is- 
land,” -said Mark. “Uninhabited, 
apparently. I shall have to take our 
bearings and see if we are anywhere 
near a regular steamer route.” 

The island was in shape like a 
broken hoop. It was a ring of coral 
rock, interrupted in one place only, 
a curve of coral and yellow sand 
fringed with palms. Here and there, - 
thickening out, it bore clusters of 
tropical trees. On the bar, where the 
ring was broken, the surf boiled and 



roared, and all along the outer edge 
of the reef the heavy Pacific swell 
boomed and crashed incessantly. 
Within the reef lay the lagoon, a blue 
lake of still water, calm as a pond.’ 
It was a picture, an artist’s dream. 

“Might have been a worse place 
for landing,” said I. “You- have 
done fine, Mark. You might have 
dropped us in the middle of Africa, 
or at the North Pole! It will do us 
good to have a lazy holiday here.” 

Mark didn’t seem very enthusi- 
astic. 

“It, looks pretty enough, Harry, 
but it may be hundreds of miles out 
of the beaten track. We may not see 
a ship for months — years. And we 
have to see if there is a spring on the 
island, or whether the vegetation de- 
pends on the rain.” 

We made the circuit of the atoll, 
from the gap in the reef to the other 
side of it and back again. We found 
coconut palms and a few stunted 
breadfruit trees, but not a trace of 
water. Not even a drop of moisture 
lay in the hollows of the coral rocks 
above high tide. 

Taking our position as well as he 
could with the instruments in his 
possession, Mark announced that he 
feared we were at least a hundred 
miles from any regular steamer 
route. 

‘ ' Snakes and tigers ! ’ ’ said I. * ‘ The 
middle of Africa would have been 
better after all. This is about as bad 
a fix as we have been in yet. Ma- 
rooned on a solitary atoll, without a 
boat, and with nothing to drink -when 
we have finished our supply of w r ater 
from Jupiter!” 

“I wish I had never seen you, nor 
your accursed invention!” cried 
Norden. 

“Nobody asked you to join us, pro- 
fessor,” said Mark, in a chilly tone. 

‘ ‘ Go away and grouch by yourself, if 
you want to keep out of trouble.” 

Although the outlook was black 
enough, we three, after what we had 



270 



WEIRD TALES 



gone through, were not easily de- 
pressed. It was, indeed, rather diffi- 
cult, standing on that tree-fringed 
curve of rock and sand between the 
thunder of the surf and the calm of 
the lagoon, bathed in sunshine under 
a sky of flawless blue, to give way to 
complete despair. 

But when three days passed with- 
out a drop of rain, without a sail 
breaking the monotony of the great 
circle of the sea, and our water sup- 
ply was nearly gone, the charm of^the 
lovely isle began to fade. 

To keep our minds busy, we talked 
over our plans in case we were res- 
cued. We knew it would be extreme- 
ly difficult to convince the world of 
the truth of our story, but we thought 
that if we could get the Star Shell 
safely home, and Mark could produce 
his calculations and formulas before 
competent scientific men, we might be 
believed in time. Much depended 
upon those precious documents, and 
on the J ovian photographs and curios 
that were snugly stored in the Shell. 

T t was shortly after daybreak on the 
A fourth day, as we three were 
standing on the highest point of the 
reef — Norden had wandered away by 
himself — that the end came. 

"A ship!” cried Dandy, huskily. 
“A small ship, full of sail! Here 
coming ! ” 

Following the direction of his 
pointing finger, we saw a sehooner 
bearing down upon the island, her 
sails silhouetted upon the rosy glow 
of the dawn. 

We shook each other’s hands, 
danced, croaked — our throats were ' 
too dry to shout — and waved our hats 
in the abandon of relief. We were 
saved. 

‘‘Our good hick holds out right to 
the end,” said Mark. ‘‘We shall evi- 
dently have to die in our beds, of old 
age, no matter what happens. Hullo ! 
What’s Norden doing?” • 



The professor had evidently seen 
the ship before we had, for he was 
already on the shore, running, and 
nearly at the Shell. We did not move, 
for we were too far away to stop him, 
whatever mischief he might be plan- 
ning. Long before we could reach 
him, he would be safely inside our 
precious vehicle. 

‘‘The treacherous hound means to 
leave us — to steal the Shell — to make 
a journey on his own account,” said 
I. ‘ ‘ It will be suicide, for he can not 
work the vessel himself, nor is it pro- 
visioned now.” 

Utterly helpless, we stood and 
watched the last act in the life-drama 
of the wonderful Star Shell. 

Norden reached it, climbed up, and 
stood in the open doorway for a mo- 
ment, holding out a round, black ob- 
ject at arm’s length for us to see. The 
faint sound of his husky voice, his 
cackling laughter, came to us on the 
sea breeze, mingled with the thunder 
of the surf. 

The climax was sudden, unexpect- 
ed. Norden appeared to stumble, 
tried to recover his footing, lurched 
backward, and disappeared into the 
Shell. Instantly a blaze of light 
burst out, vivid even in the sun- 
shine, a cloud of smoke arose, and a 
bang of fierce explosive sound shook 
the air. Then the gale blew the 
cloud away, and where the Shell had 
lain was merely a great hole in the 
sand. 

‘‘That was a Jovian bomb,” said 
I. ‘‘You remember that one was 
missing in the great battle. Norden 
must have stolen it. What he intend- 
ed to do we shall never know now. 
Perhaps he was going to blow us all 
up with it later. Anyhow he has only 
done himself in, praise be.” 

“Only?” asked Mark. 

“Oh, the Star Shell! You can 
build another one, old fellow.” 

“With all my papers and formu- 
las, the results of years of work, 



THE STAR SHELL 



271 



blown to fragments? With all the 
proofs of our voyage destroyed ? I’m 
afraid, Harry, that our first trip to 
the stars *is also our last.” 

A boat was now putting off from 
the schooner. 

“And what shall we say to these 
people? How shall we explain the 
explosion — and our presence here ? ’ ’ 

‘ ‘ J ust tell them the truth, Harry, ’ ’ 
said Mark, wearily.. ‘ ‘ They will want 



to know what ship we have been 
wrecked in, they will be firmly con- 
vinced that what they saw was the 
detonation of a floating mine. But 
tell them the truth — they won’t be- 
lieve it.” 

And they didn’t: nor does the 
world. 

But we three know. 

Mark is working hard again, and 
some day, perhaps . . . Perhaps! . . . 



[THE END] 



WEIRD STORY REPRINT 

No. 20 

The Lady of the Velvet Collar 

By WASHINGTON IRVING 



O N A stormy night, in the tem- 
pestuous times of the French 
revolution, a young German 
was returning to his lodgings, at a 
late hour, across the old part of Paris. 
The lightning gleamed, and the loud 
claps of thunder rattled through the 
lofty narrow streets — but I should 
first tell you something about this 
young German. 

Gottfried Wolfgang was a young 
man of good family. He had studied 
for some time at Gottingen, but being 
of a visionary and enthusiastic char- 
acter, he had wandered into those 
wild and speculative doctrines which 
have so often bewildered German stu- 
dents. His secluded life, his intense 
application, and the singular nature 
' of his studies, had an effect on both 
mind and body. His health was im- 
paired; his imagination diseased. He 



had been indulging in fanciful specu- 
lations on spiritual essences, until, 
like Swedenborg, he had an ideal 
world of his own around him. He 
took up a notion, I do not know from 
what cause, that there was an evil in- 
fluence hanging over him; an evil 
genius or spirit seeking to ensnare 
him and insure his perdition. Such 
an idea working on his melancholy 
temperament produced the most 
gloomy effects. He became haggard 
and desponding. His friends discov- 
ered the mental malady preying upon 
him, and determined that the best 
cure was a change of scene; he was 
sent, therefore, to finish his studies 
amidst the splendors and gayeties of 
Paris. 

Wolfgang arrived at Paris at the 
breaking out of the Revolution. The 
popular delirium at first caught his 



272 



WEIRD TALES 



enthusiastic mind, and he was cap- 
tivated by the political and philoso- 
phical theories of the day, but the 
scenes of blood which followed 
shocked his sensitive nature, disgust- 
ed him with society and the world, 
and made him more than ever a re- 
cluse. He shut himself up in a soli- 
tary apartment in the Pays Latin, the 
quarter of students. There, in a 
gloomy street not far from the mon- 
astic walls of the Sorbonne, he pur- 
sued his favorite speculations. Some- 
times he spent hours together in the 
great libraries of Paris, those cata- 
combs of departed authors, rummag- 
ing among their hoards of dusty and 
obsolete works in quest of , food for 
his unhealthy appetite. He was, in a 
manner, a literary ghoul, feeding in 
the charnel-house of decayed litera- 
ture. 

Wolfgang, though solitary and re- 
fuse, was of an ardent temperament, 
'nit for a time it operated merely 
upon his imagination. He was too 
shy and ignorant of the world to 
nake any advances to the fair, but 
he was a passionate admirer of female 
oeauty, and in his lonely chamber 
would often lose himself in reveries 
on forms and faces which he had seen, 
>.nd his fancy would deck out images 
of loveliness far surpassing the 
.’eality. 

While his mind was in this excited 
.and sublimated state, a dream pro- 
duced an extraordinary effect upon 
aim. It was of a female face of tran- 
eendent beauty. So strong was the 
mpression made, that he dreamed of 
t again and again. It haunted his 
houghts by day, his slumbers by 
light ; in fine, he became passionately 
namored of this shadow of a dream. 
This lasted so long that it became one 
of those fixed ideas which haunt the 
minds of melancholy men, and are at 
imes mistaken for madness. 

Such was Gottfried Wolfgang, and 
ueh his situation at the time I men- 
tioned. He was returning home late 



one stormy night, through some of the 
old and gloomy streets of the Marais, 
the ancient part of Paris. The loud 
claps of thunder rattled among the 
high houses of the narrow streets. He 
came to the Place de la Greve, the 
square where public executions are 
performed. The lightning quivered 
about the pinnacles of the ancient 
Hotel de Ville, and shed flickering 
gleams over the open space in front. 
As Wolfgang was crossing the square, 
he shrank back with horror at finding 
himself close by the guillotine. It 
was the height of the Reign of Ter- 
ror, when this dreadful instrument of 
death stood ever ready, and its scaf- 
fold was continually running with the 
blood of the virtuous and the brave. 
It had that very day been actively 
employed in the work of carnage, and 
there it stood in gium array, amidst a 
silent and sleeping city, waiting for 
fresh victims. 

Wolfgang’s heart sickened within 
him, and he was turning shuddering 
from the horrible engine, when he be- 
held a shadowy form, cowering as it 
were at the foot of the steps which 
led up to the scaffold. A succession 
of vivid flashes of lightning revealed 
it more distinctly. It was a female 
figure, dressed in black. She was 
seated on one of the lower steps of 
the scaffold, leaning forward, her face 
hid in her lap; and her long dishev- 
eled tresses hanging to the ground, 
streaming with the rain which fell in 
torrents. Wolfgang paused. There 
was something awful in this solitary 
monument of wo. The female had 
the appearance of being above the 
common order. He knew the times to 
be full of vicissitude, and that many 
a fair head, which had once been pil- 
lowed on down, now wandered house- 
less. Perhaps this was some poor 
mourner whom the dreadful ax had 
rendered desolate, and who sat here 
heartbroken on the strand of exist- 
ence, from which all that was dear 



THE LADY OP THE VELVET COLLAR 



273 



to her had been launched into 
eternity. 

He approached, and addressed her 
in the accents of sympathy. She 
raised her head and gazed wildly at 
him. What was his astonishment at 
beholding, by the bright glare of the 
lightning, the very face which had 
haunted him in his dreams. It was 
pale and disconsolate, but ravishingly 
beautiful. 

Trembling with violent and con- 
flicting emotions, Wolfgang again ac- 
costed her. He spoke something of 
her being exposed at such an hour of 
the night, and to the fury of such a 
storm, and offered to conduct her to 
her friends. She pointed to the guil- 
lotine with a gesture of dreadful sig- 
nification. 

“I have no friend on earth!” said 
she. 

“But you have a home,” said 
Wolfgang. 

“Yes — in the grave!” 

The heart of the student melted at 
the words. 

“If a stranger dare make an of- 
fer,” said he, “without danger of be- 
ing misunderstood, I would offer my 
humble dwelling as a shelter; myself 
as a devoted friend. I am friendless 
myself in Paris, and a stranger in the 
land; but if my life could be of serv- 
ice, it is at your disposal, and should 
be sacrificed before harm or indignity 
should come to you.” 

There was an honest earnestness in 
the young man’s manner that had its 
effect. His foreign accent, too, was 
in his favor ; it showed him not to be 
a hackneyed inhabitant of Paris. In- 
deed, there is an eloquence in true 
enthusiasm that is not to be doubted. 
The homeless stranger confided her- 
self implieity to the protection of the 
student. 

He supported her faltering steps 
across the Pont Neuf, and by the 
place where the statue of Henry the 
Fourth had been overthrown by the 
populace. The storm had abated, and 



the thunder rumbled at a distance. 
All Paris was quiet; that great vol- 
cano of human passion slumbered for 
awhile, to gather fresh strength for 
the next day’s eruption. The student 
conducted his charge through the an- 
cient streets of the Pays Latin, and 
by the dusky walls of the Sorbonne, 
to the great dingy hotel which he in- 
habited. The old portress who ad- 
mitted them stared with surprize at 
the unusual sight of the melancholy 
Wolfgang with a female companion. 

On entering his apartment, the stu- 
dent, for the first time, blushed at the 
scantiness and indifference of his 
dwelling. He had but one chamber — 
an old-fashioned salon — heavily 
carved, and fantastically furnished 
with the remains of former magnifi- 
cence, for it was of those hotels in the 
quarter of the Luxembourg Palace 
which had once belonged to nobility. 
It was lumbered with books and pa- 
pers, and all the usual apparatus of 
a student, and his bed stood in a re- 
cess at one end. 

• % 

When lights were brought, and 
Wolfgang had a better opportunity 
of contemplating the stranger, lie was 
more than ever intoxicated by her 
beauty. Her face was pale, but of 
a dazzling fairness, set off by a pro- 
fusion of raven hair that hung clus- 
tering about it. Her eyes were large 
and brilliant, with a singular expres- 
sion approaching almost to wildness. 
As far as her black dress permitted 
her shape to be seen, it was of perfect 
symmetry. Her whole appearance 
was highly striking, though she was 
dressed in the simplest style. The 
only thing approaching to an orna- 
ment which she wore, was a broad 
black band round her neck, clasped 
by diamonds. 

The perplexity now commenced 
with the student how to dispose of the 
helpless being thus thrown upon his 
protection. He thought of abandon- 
ing his chamber to her, and seeking 
shelter for himself elsewhere. Still

he was so fascinated by her charms, 
there seemed to be such a spell upon 
his thoughts and wenses, that he could 
not tear himself from her presence. 
Her manner, too, was singular and 
unaccountable. She spoke no more 
of the guillotine. Her grief had 
abated. The attentions of the student 
had first Avon her confidence, and 
then, apparently, her heart. She was 
evidently an enthusiast like himself, 
and enthusiasts soon understand each 
other. 

In the infatuation of the moment, 
Wolfgang avowed his passion for her. 
He told her the story of his mysteri- 
ous dream, and how she had possessed 
his heart before he had even seen her. 
She was strangely affected by his re- 
cital, and acknowledged to have felt 
an impulse toward him equally un- 
accountable. It was the time for wild 
theory and wild actions. Old preju- 
dices and superstitions were done 
away ; everything was under the 
sway of the “Goddess of Reason.” 
Among other rubbish of the old times, 
the forms and ceremonies of marriage 
began to be considered superfluous 
bonds for honorable minds. Social 
compacts wer« the vogue. Wolfgang 
was too much of a theorist not to be 
tainted by the liberal doctrines of the 
day. 

“Why should we separate?” said 
he. “Our hearts are united; in the 
eye of reason and honor we are as 
one. What need is there of sordid 
forms to bind high souls together?” 

The stranger listened with emotion ; 
she had evidently received illumina- 
tion at the same school. 

“You have no home nor family,” 
continued he; “let me be everything 
to you, or rather let us be everything 
to one another. If form is necessary, 
form shall be observed — there is my 
hand. I pledge myself to you for- 
ever.” 



“Forever?” said the stranger, sol- 
emnly. 

“Forever!” repeated Wolfgang. 
The stranger clasped the hand ex- 
tended to her: “Then I am yours,” 
murmured she, and sank upon his 
bosom. 

T he next morning the student left 
his bride sleeping, and sallied 
forth at an early hour to seek more 
spacious apartments, suitable to the 
change in his situation. When he re- 
turned, he found the stranger lying 
with her head hanging over the bed, 
and one arm thrown over it. He 
spoke to her, but received no reply. 
He advanced to awaken her from her 
uneasy posture. On taking her hand, 
it was cold — there was no pulsation — 
her face was pallid and ghastly— in 
a word, she was a corpse. 

Horrified and frantic, he alarmed 
the house. A scene of confusion en- 
sued. The police was summoned. 

As the officer of police entered the 
room, he started back on beholding 
the coi’pse. 

“Great heaven!” cried he; “how 
did this woman come here?” 

“Do you know anything about 
her?” said Wolfgang, eagerly. 

“Do I?” exclaimed the police offi- 
cer; “she was guillotined yester- 
day.” 

He stepped forward, undid the 
black collar round the neck of the 
corpse, and the head rolled on the 
floor! 

The student burst into a frenzy. 
“The fiend! the fiend has gained pos- 
session of me!” shrieked he; “I am 
lost forever.” 

They tried to soothe him, but in 
vain. He was possessed with the 
frightful belief that an evil spirit had 
reanimated the dead body to ensnare 
him. He went distracted, and died in 
a madhouse. 



G0 — 




F ROM time to time, in letters to The Eyrie, readers have affirmed that 
it is impossible for hair to turn white overnight from a sudden dread- 
ful shock; that there are no nerves in the hair-follicles, and therefore a 
sudden fright can turn hair white only at the roots. The nerves touching 
the hair-roots (say these readers) can cause the hair to turn white at the 
base, and grow out white, but the hair that is already grown out can’t pos- 
sibly turn white. 

However, the belief that hair can turn white from a sudden shock is so 
universal that we asked Dr. W. A. Evans, well-known writer on medical sub- 
jects and former Chicago health commissioner, to settle the question for our 
readers, bearing in mind Byron’s lines in The Prisoner of Chillon: 

“My hair is gray, but hot with years; 

Nor turned it white 
In a. single night, 

As men’s have grown from sudden fears.” 

Dr. Evans quotes from Pusey’s The Care of the Skin and Hair (page 
169) : “Grayness is often influenced by emotional and other mental trials, 
particularly those that are prolonged, and it is not an uncommon occurrence 
to see it develop rapidly from grief, severe business anxiety or other con- 
ditions of intense mental strain. That grayness sometimes occurs suddenly 
is a general impression which I believe is correct. It is difficult to under- 
stand the mechanism of its sudden production: but some of the most unro- 
mantic and reliable scientific obsei’vers have recorded cases of it.” 

That seems to settle the case in favor of those writers of weird stories 
who let their story-people’s hair turn white overnight, “as men’s have grown 
from, sudden fears.,” Pusey, says Dr. Evans, is an authority. 

Writes Jack Conroy, of Hannibal, Missouri: “Three months ago, while 
waiting for a train in an isolated railroad station, I picked up a copy of the 
August Weird Tales and was thunderstruck by the transformation. All of 
the tales possessed a distinct literary quality and three of them are good 
enough to be chosen by O’Brien for his Best Short Stories. I refer to The 
Woman of the Wood by A. Merritt, The Whistling Monsters by B. Wallis, and 
The Monster-God of Mamurtli by Edmond Hamilton. The two succeeding 
numbers have not been entirely as good, but good enough to surpass any 
other magazine in the field. The Bird of Space and its sequel were excel- 
lent,, and Across Space captivates the interest. Your poetry is chosen with

discrimination, and all in all you may say to the other publishers in the 
words of Shelley’s Ozymandias: ‘Look on my works, ye mighty, and de- 
spair ! ’ There is one discordant note, however : the drawings to illustrate the 
text are bad.” 

William Bradford, of Cleveland, Ohio, writes to The Eyrie: “The first 
story I ever read in Weird Tales was Out of the Lone/ Ago, by Seabury 
Quinn. Since then I have bought every issue. Jules de Grandin is one of 
your most interesting and entertaining characters. Sometimes the plots are 
a little far-fetched, but the story is always told in such style, with occasional 
humor and scientific theories mixed into the mystery, which carry the interest 
to the last word. In fact, I have not yet found a story in Weird Tales that 
did not have its good points, and this fact reflects much credit upon your 
judgment in weeding out the uninteresting stories. I appreciate Weird Tales 
because I can begin a story, confident that it has something in it, and that I 
won’t lose interest and throw it away before finishing it.” 

Mrs. F. C. Harris, of Lakewood, Ohio, writes: ‘‘The quality of your 
magazine is improving steadily. The Metal Giants, The Star Shell and The 
Grinning Mummy are my choice for the three best stories in the December 
issue. ’ ’ 

W rites Alice M. Huffman, of Indianapolis: “I am a constant reader of 
Weird Tales and enjoy the stories immensely as I consider them a relief 
from the monotony of the humdrum stories featured by most other magazines. 
I really can’t say which type of stories I like best in your magazine, but I 
think the scientific stories are great. I certainly enjoy all the stories of Jules 
de Grandin and the tales of strange beasts. ’ ’ 

Harry Levin, of Cleveland, Ohio, writes to The Eyrie: “While waiting 
for the car this morning I bought the latest Weird Tales. It contains a story 
which I think is the best that has been published for the last two years. It is 
a knockout. The Metal Giants by Edmond Hamilton is the story I mean. 
Give us more stories by Hamilton.” 

“Your last two numbers are just about the best I have ever read,” 
writes R. K. Barnes, of Vassar, Michigan. “The Metal Giants was immense. 
I am especially fond of scientific and astronomical stories, but as a whole I 
enjoy Weird Tales all the way through. Without doubt I find it the most 
interesting magazine on the news stands today. But why publish ‘Weird 
Story Reprints’ when your own modern writers have the older ones out- 
classed ? ’ ’ 

Writes Jack Snow, of Dayton, Ohio: “There is no mistaking the finest 
story in the December Weird Tales. It is The Metal Giants, by Edmond 
Hamilton. The author has a gift accorded to few writers — that of relating 
an imaginative scientific tale with sincerity and not with the usual hackneyed 
artificiality to be found in -character and action of such stories.” 

Carl Ballard, of Danville, Virginia, writes to The Eyrie: “The stories 
I like are pseudo-scientific stories, devil-worship, black magic, tales of rein- 
carnation and stories of the gods of old, Osiris, Isis, Pan, Jupiter, etc. I do 
not care much for ghost stories. When is Munn going to give us that sequel 
to The Werewolf of Ponkert in which he promised us the Black Master would 
come back?” 

J. R. Walsh, of East Orange, New Jersey, asks: “Have any of your 
authors ever been in that hot -bed of witchcraft, Abyssinia? Do they know of 
the wailing spirit called Bouda? Metamorphosis happens to be a capital 
crime in Abyssinia, and also in Italian Somaliland. One sees strange things

in those lands. Mr. H. Warner Munn might find real food for horror-tales 
in this locality. ” 

Sophie Wenzel Ellis, of Little Rock, Arkansas, writes to The Eyrie: “The 
happiest days of the month for me are those immediately following the first, 
when I am reading Weird Tales. In my clipping file of short stories there 
are more distinctive stories from your magazine than any other. Why do 
you not select a group of your best stories and issue them in book form? I 
should like to see you publish more stories of the sort which is exquisitely 
fanciful, such as The Woman of the Wood, by Merritt; The Moon Bog and 
The Outsider, by Lovecraft ; and The Dreamer of Atlanaat, by Price. ’ ’ 

Scott G. Williamson, of Los Angeles, expresses his ideas in verse : 

* 

“There was a time when life grew humdrum and I found 
A little magazine where thrilling tales abound. 

When reading in this book it seems that we are whirled 
Through endless space into another unknown world. 

A book that helps us when our lagging spirit fails, 

And re-a wakes the joy of living, is Weird Tales.” 

To the writer of the most helpful and constructive letter sent to The 
Eyrie discussing the stories in this issue, Weird Tales will send Seabury 
Quinn’s original typescript of The Man Who Cast No Shadow, which i 
the cover-story for this issue. The typescript will be autographed by the 
author. 

Readers, your favorite story in the December issue was The Metal Giants. 
by Edmond Ilamilton. This story has three times as many votes as its near- 
est competitors, The Grinning Mummy, by Seabury Quinn, and part two of

The Man Who Cast No Shadow 

( Continued from page 162) 



young lady, Dr. de Grandin, sor?” 
Detective Sergeant Costello asked re- 
spectfully, leaning forward from the 
rear seat of the car. 

“Wait, wait, my friend,” de 
Grandin replied with a smile. ‘ ‘ When 
our duties are all performed I shall 
tell you such a tale as shall make 
your two eyes to pop outward like a 
snail’s.. First, however, you must go 
with us to restore this jpauvre enfant 
1o her mother’s arms; then to the 
headquarters to report the death of 
that sale bete. Friend Trowbridge 
will stay with the young lady for so 
long as he deems necessary, and I 
shall remain with him to help. Then, 
this evening — with your consent, 
Friend Trow r bridge — you will dine 
with us, Sergent, and I shall tell you 
all, everything, in total. Death of my 
iife, what a tale it is! Parbleu, but 
you shall call me a liar many times 
before it is finished ! ’ ’ 

J ules de grandin placed his demi- 
tasse on the tabouret and refilled 
his liqueur glass. “My friends,” he 
began, turning his quick, elfish smile 
first on Costello, then on me, “I have 
promised you a remarkable tale. 
Very well, then, to begin.” 

He flicked a wholly imaginary fleck 
of dust from his dinner jacket sleeve 
and crossed his slender, womanishly 
ana 11 feet on the hearth rug. 

“Do you recall, Friend Trow- 
bridge, how we went, you and I, to 
l he tea given by the good Madame 
Norman? Yes? Perhaps, then, you 
will recall how at the entrance of the 
ballroom I stopped with a look of as- 
1 onishment on my face. Very good. 
At that moment I saw that which 
made me disbelieve the evidence of 
my own two eyes. As the gentleman 
we later met as Count Czerny danced 



past a mirror on the wall I beheld — 
parbleu! what do you suppose? — the 
reflection only of his dancing part- 
ner! It was as if the man had been 
non-existent, and the young lady had 
danced past the mirror by hei’self. 

“Now, such a thing was not likely, 
I admit; you, Sergent, and you, too, 
Friend Trowbridge, will say it was 
not possible ; but such is not the case. 
In certain circumstances it is pos- 
sible for that which we see with our 
eyes to cast no shadow in a mirror. 
Let that point wait a moment; we 
have other evidence to consider first. 

“When the young man told us of 
the count’s prowess in battle, of his 
imcomparable ferocity, I began to be- 
lieve that which I had at first disbe- 
lieved, and when he told us the count 
was a Hungarian, I began to believe 
more than ever. 

“I met the count, as you will re- 
member, and I took his hand in mine. 
Parbleu, it was like a hand with no 
palm — it had hairs on both sides of 
it! You, too, Friend Trowbridge, 
remarked on that phenomenon. 

“While I talked with him I man- 
aged to maneuver him before a mir- 
ror. Morbleu, the man was as if he 
had not been; I could see my own 
face smiling at me where I knew I 
should have seen the reflection of his 
shoulder ! 

“Now, attend me: The Surete Gen- 
eral — what you call the Police Head- 
quarters — of Paris is not like your 
English and American bureaus. All 
facts, no matter however seemingly 
absurd, which come to that office are 
carefully noted down for future ref- 
erence. Among other histories I have 
read in the archives of that office was 
that of one Baron Lajos Czuczron of 
Transylvania, whose actions had once 
been watched by our secret agents. 



THE MAN WHO CAST NO SHADOW 



279 



“This man was rich and favored 
beyond the common run of Hun- 
garian petty nobles, but he was far 
from beloved by his peasantry. He 
was known as cruel, wicked and im- 
placable, and no one could be found 
who had ever one kind word to say 
for him. 

“Half the countryside suspected 
him of being a loup-garou, or were- 
wolf, the others credited a local leg- 
end that a woman of his family had 
once in the olden days taken a demon 
to husband and that he was the off- 
spring of that unholy union. Ac- 
cording to the story, the progeny of 
this wicked woman lived like an or- 
dinary man for one hundred years, 
then died on the stroke of the century 
unless his vitality teas renewed by 
drinking the blood of a slaughtered 
virgin! 

“Absurd? Possibly. An English 
intelligence office would have said 
‘bally nonsense’ if one of its agents 
had sent in such a report. An Ameri- 
can bureau would have labeled the 
report as being the sauee-of-the-ap- 
ple; but consider this fact: in six 
hundred years there was no single 
record of a Baron Czuczron having 
died. Barons grew old — old to the 
point of death — but always there 
came along a new baron, a man in 
the prime of life, not a youth, to take 
the old baron’s place, nor could any 
say when the old baron had died or 
where his body had been laid. 

“Now, I had been told that a man 
under a curse — the werewolf, the 
vampire, or any other thing in man’s 
shape who lives more than his allotted 
time by virtue of wickedness — can 
not cast a shadow in a mirror; also 
that those accursed ones have hair in 
the palms of their hands. Eh bien, 
with this foreknowledge, I engaged 
this man who called himself Count 
Czerny in conversation concerning 
Transylvania. Parbleu, the fellow 
denied all knowledge of the country. 



He denied it with more force than 
was necessary. ‘You are a liar, 
Monsieur le Comte,’ I tell him, but I 
say it to myself. Even yet, however, 
I do not think what I think later. 

“Then came the case of the young 
Eckhart. He loses blood, he can not 
say how or why, but Friend Trow- 
bridge and I find a queer mark on 
his body. I think to me, ‘If, per- 
haps, a vampire — a member of that 
accursed tribe who leave their graves 
by night and suck the blood of the 
living— -were here, that would ac- 
count for this young man’s condition. 
But where would such a being come 
from ? It is not likely. ’ 

“Then I meet that old man, the 
one you call Indian John. He tells 
me much of the history of this town 
in the early days, and he tells me 
something more. He tells of a man, 
an old, old man, who has paid him 
much money to go to a certain grave 
— the grave of a reputed witch — in 
the old cemetery and dig from about 
it a growth of wild garlic. Garlic, I 
know, is a plant intolerable to the 
vampire. He can not abide it. If it 
is planted on his grave he can not 
pass it. 

“I ask myself, ‘Who would want 
such a thing to be, and why?’ But 
I have no answer; only, I know, if a 
vampire have been confined to that 
grave by planted garlic, then liber- 
ated when that garlic is taken away, 
it would account for the young Eck- 
hart ’s strange sickness. 

“Tiens, Friend Trowbridge and I 
visit that grave, and on its tombstone 
we read a verse which makes me be- 
lieve the tenant of that grave may be 
a vampire. We interview the good 
minister of the church and learn that 
another man, an old, old man, have 
also inquired about that strange 
grave. ‘Who have done this?’ I ask 
me; but even yet I have no definite 
answer to my question. 

“As we rush to the Norman house 
to see young Eckhart I stop, at an

Italian green grocer’s and ask for 
fresh garlic, for I think perhaps 
we can use it to protect the young 
Eckhart if it really is a vampire 
which is troubling him. Parbleu , 

some man, an old, old man, have what 
you Americans call ‘cornered’ the 
available supply of garlic. ' Cordieu 
I tell me, ‘this old man, he constantly 
crosses our trail! Also he is a very 
great nuisance.’ 

“The Italian tell me the garlic was 
sent to a house in Rupleysville, so I 
have an idea where this interfering 
old rascal may abide. But at that 
moment I have greater need to see 
our friend Eckhart than to ask 
further questions of the Italian. Be- 
fore I go, however, I tell that shop- 
keeper that his garlic customer has 
the evil eye. Parbleu, Monsieur Gar- 
lic-Buyer, you will have no more deal- 
ings with that Italian! He knows 
what he knows. 

“When we arrive at the Norman 
house we find young Eckhart in 
great trouble, and a black serving 
maid tells of a strange-looking woman 
who bit him. Also, we find tooth- 
marks on his breast. ‘The vampire- 
woman, Sarah, is, in very truth, at 
large,’ I tell me, and so I hasten to 
the cemetery to make her fast to her 
grave with a wooden stake, for, once 
he is staked down, the vampire can 
no longer roam. He is finished. 

“Friend Trowbridge will testify 
he saw blood on the stake driven into 
a drave dug nearly three hundred 
years ago. Is it not so, mon ami 9” 

I nodded assent, and he took up his 
narrative : 

“Why this old man should wish to 
liberate the vampire-woman, I know 
not; certain it is, one of that grisly 
guild, or one closely associated with 
it, as this ‘Count Czerny’ undoubted- 
ly was, can tell when another of the 
company is in the vicinity, and I 
doubt not he did this deed for pure 
malice and deviltry. 



WEIRD TALES 



281 



“However that may be, Friend 
Trowbridge tells me he have seen the 
count, and that he seems to have 
aged greatly. The man who visited 
the clergyman and the man who 
bought the garlic was also much older 
than the count as we knew him.. ‘Ah 
ha, he is coming to the end of his 
century, ’ I tell me; ‘now look out for 
devilment, Jules de Grandin. Cer- 
tainly, it is sure to come.’ 

“And then, my Sergent, come you 
with your tale of Mademoiselle Noi’- 
man’s disappearance, and I, too, 
think perhaps she has run away 
from home voluntarily, of her own 
free will, until you say the Italian 
shopkeeper recognized the old man 
who accosted her as one who has the 
evil eye. Now what old man, save 
the one who bought the garlic and 
who lives at Rupleysville, would that 
Italian accuse of the evil eye? Par- 
dieu, has he not already told you the 
same man once bought his garlic? 
But yes. The case is complete. 

“The girl has disappeared, an old, 
old man has 'accosted her ; an old, old 
man who was so strong he could over- 
come a policeman ; the count is near- 
ing his century mark when he must 
die like other men unless he can se- 
cure the blood of a virgin to revivify 
him. I am more than certain that 
the count and baron are one and the 
same and that they both dwell at 
Rupleysville. Voila, we go to Rup- 
leysville, and we arrive there not one 
little minute too soon. N’est-ce-pas,

“Sure,” Costello agreed, rising 
and holding out his hand in farewell, 
“you’ve got th’ goods, doc. No mis- 
take about it.” 

To me, as I helped him with his 
coat in the hall, the detective con- 
fided, “An’ he only had one shot o’ 
licker all evenin’! Gosh, doc, if one 
drink could fix me up like that I 
wouldn’t care liow much prohibition

Atomic Conquerors 

( Continued f rom page 180) 

until it seemed to be obscured by a 
mass of small dark clouds, clouds that 
drew together, fused, condensed. 
Smaller and smaller grew that mass 
of blackness, the sunlight pouring 
down around its edges. And now 
it was descending, dropping swiftly 
down toward the massed disks above, 
dropping down until it showed itself 
as not a single mass, but as several, 
dropping down until he saw that it 
was five black disks, five that raced 
toward the line of other disks above. 
Wonder filled him, and a dawning 
comprehension. These were disks 
returning from the superworld, he 
saw, dwindling down until they en- 
tered our own universe — but how 
came it that only five returned? 
Five, of the mighty thousands Mar- 
lowe had seen, that had attacked the 
superworld! Were they messengers? 

He saw the five race toward the 
hundreds above, saw them hang with 
those hundreds for a space of min- 
utes, then confusion seemed to run 
through the massed disks above, that 
were suddenly swooping back down 
to the hilltop. As they sank down to 
the summit, their numbers darkened 
the sky, and he saw, without under- 
standing, a mass of their number that 
seemed to grow smaller, that 
dwindled and vanished within the 
pit. Another mass did likewise, and 
another. They were returning to 
their own atom! And now Hunter 
understood, at last. 

The five were — survivors! 

Their attack on the superworld had 
failed — they were in retreat — retreat 
from — but look! Look! 

The sky above was again darken- 
ing, even more intensely than before. 
Even as the disks of the invaders 
dwindled and sank with frantie haste 
into the pit, the darkness above was 
compressing, contracting, resolving

into a myriad of dark, long shapes, 
shapes that swooped swiftly down up- 
on the disordered disks above. Long, 
black, fishlike hulls, utterly different 
from the disks of the atomic people. 
As they came down upon the disks, 
flashes of violent lightning flickered 
from the fish-hulls, striking disk after 
disk, sending them down in whirling 
masses of bursting flames. 

It was the superpeople, Hunter 
knew, pursuing the atomic invaders 
from their own greater world, where 
the attack of their mighty fleet of 
disks had failed. 

From the few disks that stood to 
the terrible attack of the superpeo- 
ple, the blue Cold Ray sprang out 
sullenly, but at its first appearance 
the circling, swooping hulls vanished 
entirely from view. Then from all 
the air around the disks, flash on 
flash of lightning stabbed at them. 
The superwarriors had made them- 
selves invisible. 

In panic haste the last few disks 
sank down toward the pit and the 
lightning ceased abruptly. It was as 
though the desire of the attacking 
superpeople was only to force the 
atomic invaders back down into their 
own universe. The last few disks 
dwindled, diminished, vanished into 
the pit, into the sand-grain, and the 
last humming sound ceased. The in- 
vaders had been swept from the 
Earth. Running out from the cabin, 
Hunter saw that the pit was empty 
of them, and he shouted aloud. 

Abruptly the long narrow shapes 
of the hulls reappeared above, swoop- 
ing swiftly down upon the hilltop. 
And with a sudden sense of nearing 
peril, Hunter fled down the hillside, 
sinking to the ground when his stiff 
limbs could carry him no farther. 
Above, the black hulls were clustered 
thickly around the hilltop, and the 
droning of a machine of some sort 
reached him, then a sudden sharp 
tapping of metal on metal. 

Within a space of minutes the

hulls suddenly swung up from the 
summit and hovered momentarily, 
circling. And from one of their 
number, beneath the rest, swung sus- 
pended a glistening globe of shining 
metal, a ball some three feet in thick- 
ness. Even as the awed Hunter com- 
prehended that the superpeople had 
sealed the sand-grain within that 
shining metal sphere, from all the 
gathered hulls above, flash after flash 
of terrific lightning stabbed down to- 
ward the hilltop, with a splitting 
crash, and beneath Hunter the 
ground heaved and swayed. He stag- 
gered to his feet, glimpsed the edge 
of a narrow, deep abyss in the hill- 
top created by that blasting force, 
then saw the ball of metal whirling 
down into this abyss, holding within 
it the atomic world, forever.. Again 
flashed down the lightning, and be- 
neath him was a gigantic rumbling, 
a grinding and crashing, as the 
abyss closed, prisoning the ball with- 
in its incalculable depths. 

Hunter sank again to the ground, 
his brain turning dizzily. He saw 
vaguely the dark hulls sweeping back 
up toward the zenith, dimly saw one 
of them that swooped down close 
above him and hung for a moment as 
if in curiosity, and from the side of 
this a score of faces peered down 
at him, faces not unhuman in shape, 
but unhuman in the high and un- 
troubled serenity that lay on them, 
faces that seemed to look down at 
him with a calm benevolence, an 
amused but kindly pity. 

Then that last hull, too, drove up 
toward the zenith, and all gathered 
there, expanding, growings darken- 
ing the skies once more, bringing twi- 
light that deepened into blackness, a 
blackness that hung for a moment, 
then broke up, dimmed, vanished. 

Standing there on the hillside, 
Hunter raised tremulous hands to- 
ward the sunlit sky, as if in grati- 
tude, as if in prayer.

S unset illumined Leadanfoot with a 
glory of orange and crimson light 
when Hunter reached the village. He 
walked slowly down the silent, desert- 
ed street, and sat down wearily on a 
bench in front of the inn. With an 
uncertain smile he remembered his 
conversation with the innkeeper, and 
wondered .where the man was now. 

And, too, with a flash of sudden 
pity, he remembered Marlowe, and 
their toiling race up the hill. A kind- 
ly, honest man he had seemed, one 
who had probably lived a life of se- 
rene content in his quiet .museum be- 
fore fate dragged him into the whirl- 
pool of cosmic war. A war that he 
had striven to prevent, however pow- 
erlessly. And, more somberly, Hunt- 
er thought of the other man, of Pow- 
ell. Well, it was over now, and what 
could one say of the dead? 

As it was, he thought, with those 
two dead, he was the only man on 
Earth to know what had really hap- 
pened. Those others, those millions 
in the world outside, they would be 
wondering, doubtful, puzzled, yet 
thankful, too. Well, soon he would 
be getting back to that world, to 
tell them what he knew. 

But just now he wanted to sit in 
the quiet, deserted village, breath- 
ing its peace after his two nights and 
days of nightmare fear and terror. 
Just now he wanted to sit and listen 
to little, trivial sounds, the wind that 
whispered in his ears, the crickets in 
the long grass

The Brimstone Cat 

( Continued f rom page 192) 

toward us, and one of them raised his 
hand, in which there was a heavy 
club. 

Another of my queer friends is 
Hari Tosuki, the Japanese wrestler. 
Prom him I once learned something 
of ju-jitsu. Now that knowledge 
stood me in good stead. I threw the 
man with the club, felling him with 
a catch that broke his arm and 
knocked him senseless. Then I grap- 
pled with the other villain — an ugly, 
evil creature, powerful but with a 
misshapen back, as I discovered when 
I finally had him down. 

Meanwhile, the girl, instead of 
fainting or crying out again, had fled 
down the street. She came back, just 
as I was reflecting with some pride 
that I had done credit to Hari, my 
teacher. With her were two big 
policemen.. 

They put handcuffs on our assail- 
ants and the girl told her story, while 
one of the policemen made notes for 
the charge that should be entered 
against the thugs. 

The girl had been on an errand in 
this part of the city, where she was 
a stranger. The errand had de- 
tained her much later than she ex- 
pected, and in the dusk she had lost 
her way. The two ruffians had held 
her up, and, infuriated when they 
found that she had but a few cents in 
her pocketbook, had attempted fur- 
ther outrage. She had broken away 
and fled down the side street, coming 
upon me. 

As she told her story, I looked at 
her for the first time. Or was it the 
first time ? She was a tiny thing with 
red-gold curls and a dimple in one 
cheek that made my heart pound 
madly with a desire to kiss it. Her 
eyes w r ere of a clear blue like that of 
the sea on a calm summer afternoon 
and as I looked into them I knew

why Govern Ariste had never found 
other women fair. 

I had been as a voyager who sails 
on a long journey, seeking he knows 
not what, until on a clear day he 
comes to a bay of calm blue water 
that is his harbor and his home. 

As I looked into her eyes, I saw 
recognition of me leap into her own. 

“My name is Govern Ariste, and I 
am sure I have met you before,’' I 
told her. “May I call a taxi and take 
you home?” 

“And I have met you, although I 
do not recall where,” she replied. 
“Your name is an odd one but I do 
not seem to remember it.” 

“I have always wished for a com- 
fortable, sensible name,” I .confided, 
“such a name as Peter. 1 ’ 

“Peter would suit you much bet- 
ter,” she agreed. “My name is Edith 
Montgomery. I live with my father, 
who will be much worried at my late 
return. I shall be very glad to have 
you take me home.” 

I hailed a passing taxi. As we 
climbed into it, the police patrol 
drove up and a big policeman led the 
deformed ruffian toward it. The man 
turned and cursed me, the cause of 
his misfortune; and in his evil face, 
now under the strong light of the 
machine’s headlight, I saw distinctly 
the brutal features of Tom, the hang- 
man of London Town. 

But I had other things to think of 
than hangmen. A May morning in 
the hunting park of good Queen Bess 
or a taxicab in a dark city street — 
when a man finds romance, what mat- 
ters the setting? The rapture is the 
same. 

In some way — I can not remember 
the details — we reached my lady’s 
home. She left me with a sweet- 
spoken good-bye and an invitation to 
call on the morrow and receive her 
father’s thanks, after she had told 
him the story of her unpleasant ad- 
venture. 

Somehow — I can not remember the

I. Santschi, Glenellyn, Dl; 



details — I reached again this room in 
Mrs. 0 ’Flynn’s house, where the 
damnable eat has now ceased its 
caterwauling. 

I have written this story — what a 
story! — as best I might, when a vis- 
ion ever comes between me and my 
typewriter, the vision of the sweet- 
est, fairest face in the world. What 
hair ! what eyes ! and what a bewitch- 
ing mouth! And her blush! Yes, 
she blushed at the look I gave her 
when I hade her good-night. Once 
before I have seen her blush, when I 
raised her hand to my lips and 
touched the body of the brimstone 
cat 

Or did I? Was my dream of 
Peter Byfield a story only ? Ah ! the 
story I am about to live is real 
enough, hut was the other chapter 
real? Have the doors of the past 
opened to give me a glimpse of a 
chapter of life now gone but to be 
continued in a new setting? 

Amir Das would say so, and there 
are others who so believe. Amir Das 
has told me in our discussions that 
the philosopher’s stone, which the 
alchemists of old sought, is the pow- 
er that some few men in East and 
West seek today — the power where- 
by soul and spirit conquer all earth- 
ly things. One who finds this pow- 
er is never horn on earth again as 
mere man. Thus teach the sages of 
the East. He has lived through all 
the chapters of life that were allotted 
to him in the beginning. 

I have not found the philosopher’s 
stone, but I have found something 
dearer to me than my owa life. 

Did Peter Byfield live? T do not 
know. But two things I do know. 
One of them is that some day, and 
that a day not long distant, I shall 
marry the lady of my heart — the girl 
of the red-gold curls and the eyes 
that are my doors to heaven. The 
other? 

The other is that I shall always 
hate cats.
