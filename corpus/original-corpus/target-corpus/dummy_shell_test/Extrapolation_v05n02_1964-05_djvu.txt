FROM THE LAUNCHING PAD 


With this issue we complete five years of publication, and, at 
least teaq)orarily, are in the black. 

The Executive Council has approved our request for a conference 
next year. The topic proposed is *'Science>Fiction as an Index to 
Popular Attitudes Toward Science,” but as yet the members of the 
panel have not been- selected. Since I will be in England until after 
September 1, nothing will be made final until early fall. This is 
an indirect way of asking for your suggestions<>oincluding your own 
participation on the panel. 

In the December issue, I hope to give some brief report on 
recent and pertinent British publications that may not have been 
reviewed or publicized here as much as they should be. 

A final items I wonder whether or not Extrapolation might 
begin to do two things next years first, conqsile some kind of list 
of "work in progress” in the field; and second, publish an aimual 
bibliography of both articles and books in the field. Again, sug- 
gestions and volunteers. One phase of this might well be the 
annual index of the stories and novels themselves.

GEOIGE ELIOT, SCIENCE FICTION, 


AND FANTASY^ 


Bernard J, Paris 


When I was first asked to speak to the Conference on Science Fiction, 

I intended to confine myself to George Eliot’s use of science in her novelSo 
But as I thought about the topic of the Conference“>=Science<=Fiction versus 
Science in Fiction^^I found myself becoming more and more concerned with 
the relation between George Eliot, Science-Fiction^ and Fantasy o It was 
necessary to introduce Fantasy Into the discussion because, as I hope to 
show., we need all three of these terms for a meaningful comparison. 

In his remarkable essay, "Stages in the Development of the Sense of 
Reality," Sandor Ferenczi argues that in early childhood we e^erience 
delusions of omnipotence in which consciousness and wish are the supreme 
realities. And that the pressure of our frustrations, if it does not drive 
us into some form of escape, forces us into a mature acceptance -of a limit- 
ing external world, Ferenczi holds that "the replacement (to which we are 
compelled by esqierience) of the childhood megalomania by the recognition 
of the power of natural forces conq>oses the essential content of the 
development of the ego,"^ Even in adulthood, of course, we retain a nos- 
talgia for our early feelings of omnipotence; and this nostalgia, strangely 
enough, often finds expression in our use of science, which normally is so 
closely associated with the reality principle. When Ferenczi himself, near 
the end of his essay, wanders into speculations about future discoveries ^ 
concerning "the phylogenesis of the reality- sense," he quickly relates his 
own extrapolations of the possible to the persistence of childish cravings 
for power and warns that we must always distinguish between the wish to 
know and the reality of knowledges 

The impetuous curiosity to know everything that has just seduced 
me into enchanted vistas of the past, and led me to bridge over 
the yet unknowable by the help of analogies, brings me back to 
the starting-point of these considerations s to the theme of the 
acme and decline of the feeling of omnipotence. Science has to 
repudiate this illusion, or at least always to know when she is 
entering the field of hypotheses and fancies, (p. 238) 

Ferenczi immediately launches into a discussion of the fairy tale as the 
antithesis of science and the reality principle; and as I reread this 


lo This paper served as Professor Paris’s point of departure when he led 
the discussion at the December, 1963, Conference in Chicago,

passage, after having been asked to speak to this group, I could not help 
being struck by how many of the motifs which Ferenczi ascribes to the 
fairy tale are also found in science fiction. Also, I could not help won=> 
dering if science fiction serves a psychological function similar to that 
which Ferenczi gives the fairy tales 

In fairy°°tales, on the contrary, [Ferenczi proceeds] phantasies 
of omnipotence are and remain the dominating ones. Just where 
we have most humbly to bow before the forces of Nature, the fairy° 
tale comes to our aid with its typical motives. In reality we are 
weak, hence the heroes of fairy»tales are strong and unconquerable; 
in our knowledge we are cramped and hindered by time and space, 
hence in fairy~tales one is immortal, is in a hundred places at the 
same time, sees into the future and knows the past. The ponder<° 
ousness, the solidity, and the impenetrability of matter obstruct our 
way every moments in the fairy=>tale, however, man has wings, his 
eyes pierce the walls, his magic wand opens all doorSo,ooA man may 
live in perpetual fear of attacks from dangerous beasts and fierce 
foes; in the fairy-tale a magic cap enables every transformation 
and makes us inaccessible, , 

Thus the fairy-tale, through which grown-ups are so fond of 
relating to their children their own unfulfilled and repressed 
wishes, really brings the forfeited situation of omnipotence to a 
last, artistic presentation, (pp, 238-239) 

If the fairy-tale presents artistically our longings for, and perhaps 
secret convictions of, omnipotence, fiction such as George Eliot’s is the 
artistic presentation of sober science, of our mature awareness of reality. 
At the heart of Eliot's view of the human condition is a strong sense of 
the disparity between the inward and the outward, between desire and 
reality, consciousness and the world, Eliot attributed the timelessness 
of Greek tragic drama to its insistence upon the inevitability and uni- 
versality of the collision between the individual and the generals "They 
had the same essential elements of life presented to them as we have, and 
their art symbolized these in grand schematic forms. The Prometheus re- 
presents the ineffectual struggle to redeem the small and miserable race 
of man, against the stronger adverse ordinances that govern the frame of 
things with a triumphant power, Eliot's sense of the divorce between 
man and his world came to her through the impingement of the scientific 
cosmology and epistemology upon her early religious beliefs, but, as her 
remarks on Greek tragedy suggest, she soon came to see the sense of di- 
vorce as something which men of all ages have somehow experienced, Eliot 
strikes us as mature not only in her awareness of reality, but also in 
her refusal to flee from the pain of knowledges "The highest 'calling 
and election*," she proclaimed, "is to do without opium and live through 
all our pain with conscious, clear-eyed endurance,

Science is present in Bliot's fiction not so much in its specific 
findings and technological consequences as in its basic principles, its 
fundamental philosophy. The principles of the positivistic cosmology and 
epistemology constitute the most general lavs of Eliot's fictional worlds; 
they are the presuppositions which govern every phase of her thought and 
which shape her vision of human nature and the hu m a n condition. The 
fates of Eliot's characters grow out of the inevitsble workings of the 
cosmic process; but they are equally determined by whether the character 
y ppraarhea reality in s Subjective, egocentric-, childish way or objectively, 
scientifically, maturely. In her review of Buskin's Modern Painters , 

Eliot directly advocated the application of science's objective ^proach 
to every phase of lifes 'TThe truth of infinite value that he [Buskin] 
teaches is real ism» «- the doctrine that all truth and beauty are to be at- 
tained by a humble and faithful study of nature, and not by substituting 
vague forms, bred by imagination on the mists of feeling, in place of 
definite, substantial reality. The thorough acceptance of this doctrine 
would remould our life.”^ 

For George Eliot, realistic fiction is that which is based upon the 
author's experience and observation, which is imaginative in that on the 
basis of the known it fills in unapparent facts, and which conforms in 
action and character to the laws of human and physical nature. The 
novel, for Eliot, was an instrument of discovery, as her letter to Dr. 

Joseph Frank Payne testifiesg Imy writing," she e]q>lained, "is simply a 
set of egqperiments in life--an endeavour to see what our thought and 
emotion may be capable of--what stores of motive, actual br hinted as 
possible, give promise of a better after which we may strive--what gains 
from past discipline we must strive to keep hold of as something more 
sure than shifting theory" ( Letters . VI, 216-17). Eliot's theory of 
fiction reminds one of the definition of science fiction which Bobert 
Heinlein draws from Beginald Bretnors "science fiction [is that sort of 
fiction] in which the author shows awareness of the nature and ioqjortance 
of the human activity known as the scientific method, shows equal aware- 
ness of the great body of human knowledge already collected through that 
activity, and takes into account in his stories the effects and possible ^ 
future effects on human beings of scientific method and scientific fact."

George Eliot would not reject this as a description of her own art. 

But is this a definition of what science fiction is, or of what it should 
be? Supposing that science fiction is what it should be, it must be 
pointed o.ut immediately that George Eliot's fiction is much more con- 
cerned than is science fiction with the intact of science upon the psychic 
life of man, upon man's image of himself and his demand for a sense of 
religious, orientation in the cosmos. This brings us, of course, to a 
well-known weakness of science fiction, one which greatly limits its 
literary potentialities g science fiction does not, and cannot by its 
very nature, create great characters and deal with the complexities of 
man's emotional life. 

Even so, it may well seem that science fiction has more in common 
with the realistic novels of George Eliot than it does with fairy tales: 

I suspect that it has much in common with both. Kingsley Amis, who likes 
science fiction but has no use for fantasy, insists that science fiction 
always aims to do justice to the laws of natures "while science fiction... 
maintains a respect for fact or presumptive fact, fantasy makes a point 
of flouting these; for a furniture of robots, space-ships, techniques, 
and equations it substitutes elves, broomsticks, occult powers, and in- 
cantations," Science fiction, despite its belief in the ability of man 
to create his destiny through the power of the scientific intelligence, 
cannot be accused of wishing away problems, as does the fairy-tale. In- 
deed, the problems which have come and are likely to come from a scienti- 
fic, technological civilization form the subject matter of much of the 
best science fiction, which is clearly an important form of social criti- 
cism. It could be argued, however, that science fiction's joyous grap- 
pling with social problems, which seem in it to be the only really im- 
portant problems, may be a flight from the self, from the coiq>lexities of 
emotional life, to the relatively simpler world of external difficulties. 
Also, one suspects that the possible horrors of science are often less 
inq>ortant than the possible powers of science, and that a stiff dose of 
ugly probabilities is the price that we willingly pay for a hint of 
glorious possibilities. 

Is the science in science fiction a psychological cover for its 
fairy-tale qualities? Can we permit ourselves, that is, to indulge in 
the fairy-tale motifs of science fiction because they are disguised as 
extrapolations of the possible or are surrounded by q good bit that is 
unpleasant? I have in mind people who reject fantasy but like science 
fiction; others may have less need to justify their flirtations with the 
belief that mind is the master of time, space, and matter. It cannot be 
denied, of course, that much science fiction reveals the dominance in the 
psyche not of the pleasure principle, but of deep and terrifying anxie- 
ties about the fqture. At the saaie time, however, such fiction seeks to 
escape the uncertainties of thehman condition; it seeks to master the 
future by knowing it. Does it not reveal the same "iiiq>etuous curiosity

to know everything" that seduced Ferenczi into bridging over "the yet 
unknowable by the help of analogies"? I am sure that often it also re= 
veals informed foresight, a quality which, under the name of "vision," 
George Eliot valued highlyo 

Science fiction, then, is separated from the fairy tale and allied 
to fiction such as George Eliot's by its attempt to do justice to the 
laws of nature; and it is separated from truly mature fiction such as 
George Eliot's and allied to the fairy-tale by its self-indulgence, its 
use of science to transcend realityo "Often," writes Kingsley Amis, "I 
think that part— and I mean part— of the attraction of science-fiction lies 
in the fact that it provides a field which, while not actually repugnant 
to sense and decency, ^allows us to doff that mental and moral best be- 
haviour with which we feel we have to treat George Eliot and James and 
Faulkner, and frolic like badly brought-up children among the mobile 
jellyfishes and unstable atomic piles" (p. 113).

A POETIC PRECURSOR OF BELLAMY'S "LOOKING BACKWARD" 


Ben W. Fuson 


Ei^ht year” before the Julian West of Edward Bellamy's now=famed 
Utopian science-fiction classic awoke from his sleep* a Missouri lawyer 
allegedly did the same; like West, he recorded "a century hence" his 
observations of the 1980's, but he did it, mercifully, in just twenty- 
one 8-line stanzas of pleasantly rocking-horse anapaestic meter. This 
poem occupied pages 7-13 in Paxton's now rare volume, A Century Renee 
^nA Poems (Kansas City, Mo. s Ramsey, Millett & Hudson, 1S80, 

np«)T remaining 25 poems are lackluster "remains" of a midwest 
Genteel -Tradition versifier, but the title poem intriguln^y anticipates 
o/ima oi Bellaffly's forecasts and observations, and is worth preserving. 
Incidentally, the book's dark green cover has a title stamped In gold 
featuring a "flying-saucer" wingless air machine aloft in the clouds, 
with three propellers, and the numeral "1991" (sic) proudly displayed 
on its hulll Here's the poem by our Platte City, Mo., lawyer: 


A CENTURY HENCE 


I. PROPHETIC VISIONS 

If we could lock down the long vista of ages. 

And witness the changes of time-- 
Or draw from Isaiah's mysterious pages, 

A key to his visions sublime. 

We'd gaze on the picture with pride and delight. 
And all its magnificence trace- - 
Give honor to man for his genius and might. 

And glory to God for his grace. 


II. PROGRESS 

Behold, what astonishing progress appears, 

In literature, science and wealth. 

Within the past era, of one hundred years. 

Of energy, virtue and health. 

And now let us view the bright glories this land 
In the next hundred years shall possess— 
When genius and science, with industry's hand. 
This country and people shall bless. 


III. THE SEVEN SLEEPERS 


We've all read the mythical story of old» 

How seven young sleepers withdrew. 

And hid in a cavern, where, weary and cold, 
j3xey slept a whole century throughi?= 

Than rose to return to their whole habitation. 
But found it dismantled and hoary; 

Their kindred were dead, and the new generation 
Refused to give heed to their story. 


IV, MY TRANCE 

And I, too, have slept a whole century through. 
And rising, go forth through my land; 

I seek for my home, and at length find the place 
But all is so strange and so grand; 

My cottage, that stood on the hill, is no more; 

A mansion now covers the ground; 

I pass up the yard, and approach to the door. 

But none to receive me is found. 


V. THE GARDEN 

I go to the garden<°*=>in wonder I'm lost: 

The fruits of all countries are there: 

The fig and the date are not hurt by the frost— 
The orange is luscious and fair. 

Each month brings renewal of all kinds of fruits 
The tropical flowers grow wild; 

The birds of the south and the African brutes 
Find the climate congenial and mild. 


VI. THE FLYING FEMALE 

In deep meditation I wandered alone. 

And lifted my gaze to the sky; 

And lot in the heavens a bright object shone. 
Approaching from regions on high: 

As an angel it hovered, then drop't by my side: 

"Who are you?" I asked and retreated: 

She folded her pinions and sweetly replied: 

"Your hostess; come in and be seated." 

VII. RELATIVES 

No words can express my surprise when I learned 
This lady possessed my om name; 

She told me I'd hear, when her husband returned. 
He, too, %K)uld relationship claim. 

By different lines, they their pedigree traced. 
Through four generations to me; 

And my portrait the walls of the gallery graced. 
Where all of my race I could see. 


VIII. THE DAGUERRBAN ART 


He turned to the hallj and my likeness selected. 

Mid pictures enchantingly bright; 

She told me photography now was perfected. 

And colors were painted by light. 

These pictures surpassed, in their scope and design. 
The paintings of masters of art; 

Their colors were such as no art could combine. 

And nature alone could impart. 


IX. RAIN PRODUCED 

She that my mind was bewildered and dazed. 
And guided me forth to the green; 

"And now," she observed, as to teaven ahe gazed, 
"Mot a cloud in the sky can be seen; 

And yet I will bring, in the course of an hour, 
A thunder°cloud, lightning and rain; 

And languishing nature, refreshed by the shower. 
Will smile in soft beauty again.” 


X. SUNSHINE 

She stepped to a rod, that extended on high^ 

And touched it with magical crafts- 
The gathering vapors grew thick in the sky. 

And poured out a copious draught. 

She again touched the rod, and the sun, from his path. 
Looked down with exhilarant ray; 

All nature rejoiced in the life-giving bath. 

And mountain and meadow were gay. 


XI. ACCLIMATURS 

We walked through the nutmeg and cinnamon bowers. 
By statues and beautiful fountains. 

Mid shrubbery, fruit trees and tropical flowers. 

By streamlets and miniature mountains-- 
Saw birds, of rich plumage, from Borneo's isle. 
And humming birds brought from Brazil; 

While songsters from Europe, the Ganges, and Nile, 
Glad nature's rich orchestra fill. 



XII. SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS 


The lady e;q>lained that, as science progressed, 

Man ruled upon sea and in air,>° 

That stonns were forbidden^-the sea kept at rest. 

And seasons made fruitful and fair; 

That flowers and animals, far away reared. 

Were acclimated here and grew wild; 

And a motor, much stronger than steam, had appeared. 
Yet cheap, economic and mild. 


XIIIo ATMOSPHERIC SHIP 

"And look," she exclaimed, as she lifted her face, 
"There, now in the sky is a ship; 

As swift as an eagle it moves to its place; 

Tis my husband returned from his trip," 

He stepped from the vessel, as near us it came. 
And dropped upon wings from above: 

He knew, from my portrait, my kinship and name. 

And hailed me in tenderest love. 


XIV, AERIAL VOYAGE 

He told of his visit to Paris and Rorae>- 
Of his flight over England and Spain; 

He found in his travels, no land like his home. 
No place where he wished to remain. 

He spoke of his trip to the banks of the Nile, 
To cities now crumbling to dust>> 

Of China, Japan and Australia's isle. 

Where all are in ruin and rust. 


XV. DESOLATION IN THE EAST 

He noted and wept, for the rapid decay. 

Of lands of the date and the lime. 

Where ignorance, vice and oppression held sway. 

And men sought a happier clime. 

But when he had passed o'er the isles of the ocean. 
And reached California's strand. 

His spirit was filled with a thrilling emotion, 

Of pride for his own happy land. 



XVIo VIEW FROM THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS 


He rested on top of the high Rocky Mountains, 

And turned for a view of the West; 

The land was a garden, with forests and fountains-- 
A home for the free and the blest. 

He turned to the East, and a picture more bright. 
Never rose in the poet's sweet dream; 

The land was an Eden of love and delight. 

With mountain and valley and stream. 


XVII. THE WHOLE CONTINENT OURS 

In the midst, at St. Louis, the Capitol loomed. 

With lofty and glittering steeple-*- 
The seat of a Nation, where freedom first bloomed. 
Containing a billion of people. 

"And now," he exclaimed, "the whole Continent's ours. 
From Panama, North to the polet 
For naught but the ocean can fetter our powers, 

Or give to us less than the whole I" 


XVIII. INVENTIONS 

As we walked to the house, my companions reported. 
That roads through the land were not found. 

That men, on light wings, in the atmosphere sported. 
Or walked, as they pleased, on the ground. 

With the new motive power, one man could do more 
Than fifty, without it, could do; 

So people were able to add to their store. 

And be generous, noble and true. 


XIX. TELEPHONE 

An order for supper, by telephone, now. 

Had scarcely been made, by my host. 

When in sprang a servant, I cannot tell how. 

With coffee, ham, biscuit and toast. 

He'd come from St. Louis, three hundred miles out. 
With dishes delicious and rare; 

There were venison, and turkey, and salmon, and trout. 
With pine-apple, orange and pear. 


36 


XX, ARTIFICIAL LIGHT 

vniea supper was ended, I found it still light; 

I looked for a lanqp, and found none; 

I stepped to the door, and looked forth on the night. 
And lot every house had a sun. 

Above me in splendor, surpassing the moon, 

A disk, in the heavens gave light; 

And neighboring orbs gave the brightness of noon, 

And scattered the darkness of night. 


XXI, CONCLUSION 

By reflectors, the light of these beacons was cast. 
On parlor, and chamber, and hall; 

And candles and laiqis were consigned to the past. 
And light, like the air, was for ell. 

Now worn by the scenes of the day, 1 need rest. 

And find it in slumber elysian; 

But rise in the morning, perplexed and distressed; 
T'was all but a beautiful vision. 


Color photogri^>hy, artificially induced rain, controlled weather to 
support exhibits of tropical plants and animals, new power sources, in- 
dividual human flight ability (with 'pinions*')* menus by telephone, 
diffused city-illumination devices (not yet rivalled by our stadium tower 
lights?)— our Platte City attorney's forecasting tempers science-fiction 
fantasy with extrapolative logic. His political vision of St. Louis as 
the capital city of a United States covering "from Panama, north to the 
Pole" with a population of one billion may now seem Jingoistic and 
macabrely Malthusian, but he set his sights highi Paxton's poem deserves 
its niche, however tiny, in the bibliographies of Science-Fiction and 
Utopias.

THB INTIRPLAY OF SCIBNCS AND FICTIONS THE CANALS OF MARS 

William B« Johaaon 
Thomas 0. Clareson 


Because of the importance of space°>f light to science-fiction and the 
long tradition of the voyage to the moon, it may seem naive to call atten- 
tion to the role astronomical findings have had in shaping the modem 
genre. Yet to do so in terms of the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries provides a classic exaople of the interplay between scientific 
speculation and the literary imagination, 

Beginning perhaps in 1846 when Dr. Galle of Berlin "found" the planet 
Neptune as a result of the mathematical calculations given him by Leverrier, 
the attention of the magazines and the embryonic science-fiction genre 
turned Increasingly toward outer space, toward the planetary system. An 
increasing number of articles in such periodicals as Atlantic Month]^ dur- 
ing the 1860 's and 1870 's give their attention to "the present state of 
knowledge" regarding individual planets, as well as the nature of the 
great meteoric and cometary action which reached a climax with Haley's 
Comet in 1907. One indication of the way in which astronomy took hold of 
the popular imagination can be seen in Garrett P. Serviss' becoming 
identified throughout the country as "the New York Sun 's astronomer" dur- 
ing the 1880's. Most important, however, beginning in the 1880's Mars 
becomes the focal point of speculation until not only does it command the 
popular press but also, by World War I, becomes the umaj^ destination of 
any interplanetary voyage. 

Within the genre itself, let alone the popular magazines, the evidence 
of such novels as Nark Wick's To Mars Via the Moon (1911),* which was 
dedicated to Percival Lowell and which reads in its early chapters like a 
textbook and then like a mystical tract, emphasizes that Mars became the 
focal point as the result of a single events Giovanni Schiaparelli's an- 
nouncement in 1877 that he had discovered canal i on Mars. The resultant 
controversy changed--and was changed— science-fiction. 

As Mark Hillegas has pointed out, Schiaparelli at least at first 
thought of the canali as "grooves" in the red planet's surface, but.the 
word was translated as canals, with all the resultant implications. In

1879 during the next opposition^ he found that some of the ’’canals” had 
parallel counterparts running their full lengtho Percival Lovell con- 
firmed these observations in the same year, though he did not then publish 
in the popular press©^ Indeed, during the 1880*s in the American perio- 
dicals at least, the controversy merely simmers in essentially repor- 
torial articles© (Schiaparelli’s own writing was not published until 
1894o) But the potential seems Implicit in the speech Charles A© Young 
made in 1885 upon his retirement as AAAS president when he wondered 
whether or not those xnapping Mars’ surface "have not gone into a little 
more elaborate detail than the circumstances warrant,” and referred to 
wide and irreconcilable differences ”in minor points©” 

In order to make the most of the implications of the canal i © the 
writers needed a theory that would lend authority to the assumption of 
Intelligent life on Mars© Camille Flamraarion had suggested the possi- 
bility as early as 1873 simply because he could not imagine a planet as 
a ”vast and useless desert” when ”on earth the smallest drop of water is 
peopled with myriads of animalcules©©©” The theory, however, came from 
John Fiske, whose Cosmic Philosophy (1874) advanced the concept of nec- 
essary and progressive development© In its final form the theory insisted 
that the entire universe was governed by a parallel evolution® Thus Mars, 
as an older world, necessarily had an advanced civilization© Interest- 
ingly, many theosophical e£ al© writers took refuge in the idea; like 
Louis Po Gratacap, they knew The Certainty of a Future Life on Mars (1903)« 
Even H© G« Wells presented a Martian who was aF least vaguely humanoid© 

The props were in place for the oppositions of 1892 and 1907© In 
1892 Harvard University and the Flagstaff -Lovell Observatories backed 
expeditions to Peru; in 1907, to Chile© Professors William H© Pickering 
and David Todd, leaders of the e 3 q>editions of the respective institutions, 
could not reach agreement upon what they had seen, but they did acknowledge 
the possibility of life on Mars© Although in Britain the greater furor 
can^ with the opposition of 1892, in America it came later© As Darwin 
found his champion in Huxley, so Schiaparelli and his canals found theirs 
in Percival Lowell© Beginning in the popular press with his articles in 
Atlantic in 1895 which were to form the basis of his first book. Mars 
(1895), and continuing through his second book. Mars and Its CanaJLs (!l907)© 
insisted the canals represented the irrigation system used by an advanced 
race to maintain a dying world© In 1909 he maintained he observed new 
canals that must have been constructed since his last observations in 1907© 

A kind of frenzy entered the controversy as early as 1892 with the 
sudden obsession to communicate with Mars© (In 1964 one cannot help but 
infer that the entire affair, but this communication especially, repre- 
sented another expression of the cosmic loneliness of the fin de siecle) 
Nicola Tesla received electrical impulses in 1899 that could have ori- 
ginated ’’only on Mars,” while, ironically, William H© Pickering, the 
severest opponent of the canals, proposed in 1909 that the United States

should spend ten million dollars to build a system of mirrors with which 
to signal the ilartians. Another plan called for giant cut-outs to be laid 
upon a desert. 

One of Lowell’s good friends, whose novels had been serialized in 
Cosmopolitan , wrote a non-fiction article for that magazine after he had 
read Mars and Its Canals. In ”The Things That Live on Mars,** H. G, Wells 
suggested that Martianss 

will probably have heads and eyes and backboned bodies, and 
since they must have big brains, because of their high intelli<* 
gence, and since almost all creatures with big brains tend to 
have them forward in their heads near their eyes, these Martians 
will in all likelihood be larger in size than humanity, two and 
two-thirds the mass of a man perhaps. XLIV (March 1903), 240-241. 


Another friend of the two men, who had written about the canals almost 
as much as Lowell and who had destroyed giant Martians by deluging them 
with water from their canals in his Edison’s Conquest of Mars (1899), a 
sequel to Wells’ War of the Worlds, made perhaps the best judgment of the 
entire controversy. After recalling that in August 1877 Asaph Hall had 
discovered the twin moons of Mars, Garrett P. Serviss concluded: 

...the moons of Mars, having once been discovered, were after- 
ward seen with comparatively small telescopes, the canals heve 
never been seen with the great glass at Washington, and dhly 
three or four observers besides Schiaparelli have ever seen them. 


Thus he wrote in 1889, but certainly by his later writing he helps 
to prove that the canals of Mars exist at least in the cosmography of the 
literary imagination.

magazine refuting Lowell's "Gross errors, calculated to mislead 
even the educated and well informed...." 

"Are the Canals of Mars Illusions?" Scientific American , XC (March 12, 

1904) , 219. 

On the basis of an experiment with a group of schoolboys who, 
when instructed to copy a carefully lighted diagram of Mars 
on which the canals had been omitted, actually drew canals in 
(because of light and dark regions next to each other), the 
author concludes that the canals are Illusions. 

"Canals of Mars Photographed," Scientific American, XCIII (August 5, 

1905) , 107. 

The author lauds Lampland's successful photogri^>hing of Mars 
claiming it to be a feat of "astronomical importance" and does 
a plausible job of knocking the bottom out of Itfwell's theory.

American , C (June 5, 1909), 423. 

Description and criticism of Todd's plan to sionitor the air

The writer disclaims the logic of Prof. Pickering's proposal to 
spend $10,000,000 to build a system of mirrors with which to 
signal Mars; the article also provides an outline of Lowell's 
Martian theory and criticisms of it. 



"More About Signalling to Mars," Scientific Ameri can« C (May 15, 

1909), 371. 

More suggestions about »ays to coamunicate with Mars including a

preliminaries before any attempt at signalling is made. 

"The Dying Planet»Mars," Harpar * s Weekly . LV (October 21, 1911), 33. 

Taking into account seasons, atmospheric pressure and tempera- 
ture, the author asserts that "the phenomena j»f Mors, now under 
the observation of earth's astronomers, are the last manifesta- 
tions of a dying life." 

"The Evidence of Life on Marss A Single Mathematical Proof that the 
Canals are not due to Natural Ca u ses, " Scientijfj[^ American , 

XCVII (October 26, 1907), 287, 291. 

This article, signed by A. Mathematician (who is probably Lowell), 
demonstrates by the mathematical theory of probability that be- 
cause the "canals" are ao regular, there is only one case in 24 
million that they could have occurred naturally. 

"Why the Dwellers of Mars do not Make War," Current Literature , 

XLII (February, 1907), 211-14.

ready occurred on Mars, since it is an older planet. Mars has 
already lost most of its oceans; the oceans of the earth are 
disappearing. He further speculates that "a high type of life 
is probable on Mars," although it may have by the present time 
died out,

After taking into account "recent geological discovery relat- 
ing to the distribution of land and water on our earth," Peal 
concludes that the canals are tide-channels through which the 
water on the planet flows from pole to pole during solar tideso
