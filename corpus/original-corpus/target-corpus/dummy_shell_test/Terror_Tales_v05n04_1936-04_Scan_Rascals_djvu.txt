by clearing skin irritants 
out of the blood 


kill YOUR dates 

D uring the years following the begin- 
ning of adolescence — from about 13 to 25, 
or even longer — many young people have to 
fight pimples. 

Important glands develop and final growth 
takes place during this time. This causes dis- 
turbances throughout the body. The skin be- 
comes oversensitive. Waste poisons in the blood 
irritate this sensitive skin. Pimples break out. 
Many doctors prescribe Fleischmann’s Yeast 
for the correction of these adoles- 
cent pimples. It clears the skin 
irritants out of your blood. Then 
pimples disappear! 

Eat Fleischmann’s Yeast 3 
times a day, before meals — plain, 
or in a little water — until yoxir 
skin is entirely clear. Start today.

No. Is ARTHUR LEO ZAGAT 

T O BE in character, I presume, I 
should be a weazened ancient, 
stooped and long-bearded and wild- 
eyed. Robed in black, I should pen weird 
tales of terror and despair by the mid- 
night luminance of a wick woven from a 
murdered maiden's hair, molded in a 
candle pressed from the fat of long-dead 
cadavers. A bat should soar on silent 
wings about my head and an owl perched 
on my shoulder should hoot eadi time I 
lay down my quill to quaff a gory draught 
from a grinning skull. 

Unfortunately, I am not Hke that CWIdroi 
do not ran sbri^ng from tbe sight of my grisly 
visage, of my eyes of evil. Dogs do not howl as 
I prowl Ilgbtless graveyards on silent, ghoalish 
feet. 

I am really quite human. . . ,

ductor of a humorous coliunn in the Weekly I

mitted, even now, to tell the nature of what we 
did, but there are certain s^e-slimed subter- 
ranean tunnels in that strife-torn land, certafii 
groves ringed around by gloomy arborage — 
No I Perhs^ you may deeij^er in my tales, like 
kernels in diii^ nutshells oi fiction, the incred- 
ible things I saw.

New York suddenly became a mine of ma-

When yoop kidneys are dogged and your

but gff cents at any modem drag store. It s one

world drip slowly, one by one, and Mie by one I 
pass on to yon the chili prk^es that scamper 
tny spine as 1 hear them, the brisfUog neck-hairs 
o£ ancestral fear. 

How much of truth is there in these ancient 
myths ? Frankly, I do not know. But I do know 
that those who tell me of them bdie« in them 
utterly. I loiDw by Ae dread Jn their eyes, by 
the grey film of fear that underlies the twown 
or yellow or swarthy tan of their alien counte- 
nances. For Ac moment, at least, I ^re that 
dread, that fear. ... 

Once> not long ago, I saw Death. I «aw him 
stalk— a mbty shimmer of grey, tolf-seen dra- 
peries — down a tong, dim hospital ward. I 
saw the deep, dark sockets in his skull, wh^ 
tbwe were no eyes, seardh the tovs of white, 
moaning beds — for me! I saw lua bony hand 
reach out to take me. . . . 

But, minutes before, my bed had been ex- 
changed for that of another, across the aisle. 
And so It was another whom Death took. It was 
anotheFs corpse about whidi the nurses drew 
the white screens that have one meaning only, 
in a hospital ward. , , . 

I wonder if Death has discovered his mis- 
take. When he does, will he come for me — to- 
night perhaps? Is that ^raping I hear really 
a mouse gnawii^ in the wall, or Hie rasp of 
Death’s skeleton fingers on my door panel . . .? 

Or have I been stricken off Deaths books 

forever? Arthur Leo Zagat

Priestess of Miirdeif 


Bij Artkur Leo Zagat 

(Author of "Death Lives at Our House” etc.) 

A thin^ of terror lurked in hiding — waiting to work 
its ghastly evil upon heautiful Leila MonroyJ . . . Was 
her lover in truth the monster who sought herf Was 
it lovely Eve, her best friend? Or were Leila’s 
darkest suspicions correcP — could it he that she, 
herself, changed periodically into the thing 
of horror and death that haunted that stricken 
countryside

T he house was full of whispers. 
LeBa Mooroy, patlieticaHy small iu 
the huge, wii^-sMed easy chair, 
fumbled at her throat. A sob was trying 
to rise there, knotting her musdes with a 
. sort of phjracal pain. 

The house was ftdl of whispers. The 


ancient fannliouse that always had been 
her home was an abo(^ of brooding dread, 
a place of dark despair. The groaning of 
the old timbers’ drying fibers seemed ter- 
ribly loud in the oppressive silence. They 
came from the very walls about Leila; 
from the age-darkened rafters overhead: 
from the ominous gloom of the entrance 
hallway that somehow repelled tlie living- 
room Hffht; from the broad staircase

TERROR TALES 


twisting upward out of that foyer to ap- 
pallingly empty obscurity above. 

The house was full of whispers, shred- 
ding Leila’s frayed nerves with terrible 
reminders of her day’s long agony. Just 
such a place of muted, ominous sounds 
had the courtroom been. Unshed tears, 
through the anguished hours, had blurred 
its crowded benches ; and the only reality 
had been the gaunt, suffering figure of her 
grey-faced father in the prisoner’s dock. 
But the whispers had been inescapable. 
All day they had hissed at her, as they 
were hissing now: mutterings of horror 
as witness after witness had damned Jus- 
tin Monroy with husked tales of brutal, 
unutterably savage killing; gasps of out- 
rage when Leila herself gave halting testi- 
mony that she had been with her father, 
here in this room, all the fatal hour be- 
tween the time when Shean Rourke had 
last been seen alive and the time when 
Foster Corbett had found his hacked and 
mangled corpse beneath the poplars divid- 
ing the two farms. 

Whispers had met the exhausted girl — 
whispers of tight-lipped condemnation — 
when at last she had stumbled down from 
the witness chair ; and the farmer-women’s 
Sunday silks had rustled, self-righteously, 
drawing away from the defiling touch of 
the girl who, hostile eyes said, had lied 
desperately to save a blood-guilty slayer. 

Whispers, whispers, whispers — seething 
out of the pulsating silence as the stony- 
faced jury marched back into their box. 

And then the whispers had become a 
soundless scream searing Leila’s breast 
as the dreadful verdict soughed from the 
foreman’s tight throat. 

“Murder! While insane !” 

Insane! The recollection flung Leila 
Monroy up out of her chair, held her 
rigid in distress. Insane ! The word hissed 
within her skull, hissed from the stark 
vacancy in which she was so utterly alone 
with terror and despair. Slithering foli- 


age, stirred by a swiftly rising wind, hissed 
it at her from the terrible outer night. 
Insane ! 

Insane I The kindly, tender old man to 
whose gnarled hand she had clung as the 
brown clods thudded on the drab wood of 
her mother’s coffin; the hard-working, 
weatherbeaten oldster who had been fath- 
er and mother to her through so many 
years — a madman! Her father! From 
whose veins came the blood surging now 
so darkly in her veins. 

Leila quivered. Tremors ran through 
the long, delicate curves of her slim form. 
The tiny oval of her small-featured coun- 
tenance blanched with a new dismay. His 
blood in her veins! What if that blood 
were tainted with a foul lust to kill, with 
an stavistic urge to tear with fang and 
claw, to rend human flesh and taste the 
warm, salt-sweet tang of human life-fluid 
on smacking, gory lips? What if she had 
not really drowsed that halt-hour whose 
lapse fatally had invalidated her testi- 
mony? Had she run, instead, ravening 
by his side while a fearful heritage of 
homicidal madness blotted memory from 
her soul as the alienists said it had blot- 
ted recollection from Justin Monroy’s ? 

A BRUPTLY the light within was paled 
by a blue blaze glaring in through the 
window on which her unseeing stare was 
fixed, by lightning that split the sky’s 
black vault with a jagged and blazing frac- 
ture. Thunder blast became to the shocked 
girl the devastating roar of an enormous 
beast that leaped on the house, that bat- 
tered it, that shook it in huge jaws whose 
slaver was driving rain. Storm tumult 
howled about the old walls, crashed 
through the empty rooms, drowned out 
tlw whispers that had tortured Leila, 
drowned out the whispers in her harried 
brain. Almost, after the first terrific on- 
slau^t, she was grateful for the fury

that woid4 «o loiter let her hear those 
whispei5. 

But it could not drown her dreadful 
thoughts. 

“Np," she moaned. "Merciful Lord, 
no!" as she had mc^ned when Justin 
Monroy’s suave attorney had elicited from 
the bald-pated alienist glib testimony that 
had saved his client from the death-chair 
— ^and condemned him to a living hell. 
“Nol It be true." 

"I ootdd have done nothing else," the 
lawyer lad answered her reproaches af- 
terward. “It was your father’s ax Foster 
Corbett found buried in the dead man's 
chest. 'Ypuf father's footprints were 
traced ottt of the trampled mess around 
the corpse surf across the meadow to your 
back porch. There was the old boundary 
line feud between your father and his 
neighbor, his threats that if Foster Corbett 
or his oon Stanley or his farm hand, 
Shean Rourice, stej^ed on Monroy land 
they would regret it. Against that we had 
only your won! that he was seated in the 
rown with you all evening. And on cross- 
examination you admitted that you had 
fallen asteep.” 

The wind pounded against the door as 
their fists had pounded, coming to accuse 
Dad of the awful deed. Foster Corbett, 
triumphant at last over his ancient ad- 
versary. Stan Corbett — 

Leila'*s pale lips writhed. Stanl In his 
arms she had known happmess, against 
her lips his lips had thrilled. Defiant of 
the enmity between their fathers they had 
loved. If State Trooper Stanley Corbett 
had fired his gun into her heart, he could 
no more cruelly have slain that love than 
he had by sayir^ to her father, "You're 
under arrest, Mr. Monroy.” 

Rain lashed against the window in a 
spasm of new fury. The world was ablaze 
with a flickering dectric flare that spilled 
bluely on the tossing poplars marching 
along the tree-marked boundary between 


the two farms. It was ju* there that 
Shean Rourke’s corpse — Somethii^ 
moved stealthily — vague and black — 
among the wind-bent trunks 1

was it? Who prowled the storm-drenched

prey? Stalking her? Icy fingers clutched 
Leila Monroy’s throat, chill priddes 
tickled her spine. Hi$ blood-thirst still 
unslaked, inflamed by bis terrible crime 
for which Dad unjustly had been con- 
demned to terrible expiation, the murderer 
was creeping up on her. On her 1 

An ancient legend of whispered terror 
trailed a slimy speculation across her fear. 
A name breathed with shudders of appre- 
hension by the gaffers clustering around 
the cberry-bellied stove in the village. The 
Monster of West Cliff! The traditional 
phantom that was reputed to haunt the 
stony precipice whose sheer rampart rose 
behind the fertile plain along which, from 
north to south, lay the three neighboring 
farms of the Corbetts, the Monroys and 
the Stars! Often of late he had bear 
seen stalking the dark belt of primeval 
forest cloaking the base of th^ cliff, the 
elusive, appalling wraith, it was said, of 
an Indian chief whose tribe had been 
massacred by the plain's first settlers. 
Stalking the ages, waiting for a chance 
at gruesome revaige. Every accident, 
every unexplained disaster of the country- 
side was ascribed to him. Was it he who — 

OTORM-BLAZE arched the heavens 
once more, exploding into momentary 
existence the tempest-tormented trees, the 
downpour-beaten pasture between. They 
were deserted, vacant as the house itself. 
Nothing — no one was anywhere in sight. 
The prowling shadow had been an illu- 
sion, a figment of her anguished brain.- 
Wait! Wait! The iitu^ned sight had 


12 


TERROR TALES 


recalled something to Leila. An incident 
of the fateful night that she had utterly 
forgotten till now, till it was too late. The 
girl groaned, beat her breast in bitter self- 
condemnation. 

Stepping to this very window, that eve- 
ning, to pull down its shade, she had seen, 
or thought she had seen, Foster Corbett 
dodging behind the tool shed just visible 
left of the house. She had said nothing 
to her father, fearing to excite him, fear- 
ing to jeopardize the reconciliation for 
which she and Stan plotted. The terrible 
events following had obliterated the mat- 
ter from her memory. Utterly, till now. 
How could she have forgotten it, its 
astounding implication? The murder-axe, 
whose blood-smeared helve had shown no 
fingerprints, had come from that very 
shed! 

Perhaps it was not yet too late. Per- 
haps if she told her story — 

Shrill sound sliced across the thought. 
It stopped, spurted again. Rrrring — 
rrrring — rrring. It whirled Leila around 
to it. Rrrring — rrring — rrring. The tele- 
phone ! Three rings, the Monroy signal ! 
Who could be phoning her. Stan? In- 
credible! Eve Starr, perhaps? Eve, her 
neighbor and closest female friend, calling 
to extend sympathy, consolation. Like Eve 
to remain loyal when every one else 
shunned her. 

Rrrring — rrring — Leila, flinging across 
the room, into the hallway’s dimness, 
jerked the receiver from its hook. 

“Hello.” 

“Lock your doors,” a hoarse, unrecog- 
nizable voice grated without preamble. 
“Lock your windows.” A voice choked, 
coarsened by some inexplicable terror. 
“Don’t let any one in. Not any — ” 

The telephone was suddenly dead, with 
the flat, inanimate deadness of a line from 
which the humming life of its current has 
gone. Dead ! Had the storm blown down 


a frail wire or had some human hand cut 
it? Some human hand, just too late to 
stop the husked warning? 

Some human hand! Icy terror one* 
more struck at Leila Monroy. The hand 
of some one who even now crept up on 
the house. Then she was moving, had 
flung herself to the great front door, was 
thrusting into its socket the heavy bolt 
clamped to its sturdy oak. 

The back door was already locked, she 
remembered. The windows! Old-fash- 
ioned shutters creaked out of recesses in 
their embrasured sides to the frantic pull 
of her trembling hands, were also bolted. 
She rushed in frenzied haste through din- 
ing room, through kitchen, clicking on 
light as she went, light from which sliad- 
ows fled that were black, sinister silhou- 
ettes waiting around comers, behind 
doors, to spring upon her. The lower 
floor was at last a blaze of light, was a 
locked and barred fortress against what- 
ever menace threatened. The lower floor — 

But there was the upstairs yet, the up- 
stairs that was blacker, as Leila’s dilated 
pupils stared up into its mystery, because 
of the luminescence about her. No longer 
was it the warm, familiar bedroom floor of 
the old house but a precinct of stygian 
gloom haunted by some darkness-shrouded 
threat. 

The girl’s small fingers tightened on 
the newel post to which she clung, tight- 
ened till the blood was driven from them 
and they were grey, trembling splotches 
against the lustrous patina of the wood. 
It was only the dark, up there, of which 
she was afraid. Over and over she told 
it to herself. It was only because of the 
dark that she had that hint of evil lurking 
just beyond the stairhead, of monstrous 
evil crouched just beyond the range of 
her vision, haunched and waiting to pounce 
upon her. There was nothing more in 
the corridor above, Leila assured herself, 
than shadows like the eerie phantoms that 


PRIESTJESS OF MURDER 


13 


had fled from the lights she had turned 
on. 

Nothing? A shriek sliced down to her, 
the h%h, shrill scream of a wom^ in 
deadly taror. 

It checked off, faded into vague thump- 
ings as of a fierce struggle, into the thud 
of a storm-tossed brandr against the build- 
ing wall, It came again! 

^INY muscles twitched in Leila’s 
cheeks. Insensate, humorless laughter 
sounded in her fluttering throat. It was 
the wind that had screamed from up there, 
tightening her scalp with fear. It must 
have been the wind. No one could pos- 
sibly be op there. 

Bui she was afraid. Afraid to go «p 
there and look. Afraid of the storm and 
the dark. 

A sharp crackle jerked her around- 
She stared wide-eyed at the entrance door. 
Fool ! That had been only the splintering 
of a gale-riven brandi — It came again. 
Unmistakable this time. The crunch of 
a heel on the gravel pathway outside ! 

A foot thudded on the porch just be- 
yond the door and unseen fingers rattled 
the door knob. Through a crashing peal 
of thunder the terrified girl heard a threat- 
ening, hoarse bellow. Swneone was just 
the other side of the sturdy portal. Some 
one — The killer I The mad killer, seeking 
her! 

He bellowed again, pounded wild fists 
on the wood. The great panel shuddered 
under flie berserk attack. Its hinges 
creaked. The furious pounding piled a 
fr^izied terror on her fear of the storm 
and the dark. Realization pierced her 
that only five feet of air, two indies of 
wood, sqsarated her from the monstrous 
creature that had made of Shean Rourke 
a mangled horror. It twisted her about, 
sent her hurtling headlong up the stairs 
that a moment before dread bad barred 
to her, sent her dashing dirou^ the light- 


less corridor in instinctive flight to tlie 
fancied sanctuary of her own bedroom. 

Her hand clutched the knob of its door, 
swung her to it Franctically she thrust 
open the panel, slammed it shut behind 
her, leaned back against it, gasping, quiv- 
ering. 

Rain lashed against the window pane, 
threshed on the roof above her. Dulled 
by distance, the savage pounding on the 
door below beat about Leila as though 
tangible blows buffeted her. Momentarily 
the lightning had ceased. The chamber 
was obliterated by tar-barrd daricness. A 
feeling grew on Leila dial she was not 
alone here. 

Leila Monroy whimpered, stabbed blind- 
ly at the light-switch she knew jutted from 
the wall to her right. The small room 
sprang into sight A dishevelled appari- 
tion stared at her from her dresser mir- 
ror, russet wedth of hair tumbling about 
her now pallid face, mouth twisting and 
livid, grey eyes dark with the frenzy of 
her terror. She pulled her gaze from it, 
saw the bed — 

Crumpled on its scarlet-flecked counter- 
pane lay the contorted body of a girl. 
Blue-black hair veiled her face, but where 
a pink frock had been cruelly tom away, 
lurid fingermarks on a white throat 
showed the manner of her death. Her 
death — there was no motion, no movement 
at all in the awful stillness of the pathetic 
figure. The exposed, blanched breast 
stirred with not the slightest breath, 

“Eve,” Leila whimpered, unable to do 
no more than stare aiul whimper. 
“Eve ...” 

Forgotten the tumult of the storm, the 
battering at the entrance door. Forgotten 
everything but the horror that burst with- 
in her skull. But she had no memory of 
Eve’s arrival. No m^ory . . . 

Time must have dropped out of her 
consciousness. Time owHigh for her to 


14 


TERROR TALES 


have summoned the girl, to have lured 
her up here ! Time enough — for her own 
hands to have clenched on her friend's 
throat, to have pressed, pressed, until life 
no longer throbbed beneath her throttling 
fingers ! 

CHAPTER TWO 

The Phantom in the Treei 

TT SEEMED to Leila Monroy that she 
^ could feel, in her icy palms, memory 
of the soft flesh’s slow crumple beneath 
their lethal construction. Once she had 
hated Eve, when the girl quite openly had 
tried to win Stan Corbett away from 
her. That jealous hatred had passed away 
with her own triumph and they had been 
friends again. Had it passed ? Had it not 
rather sprung to sinister existence with the 
blood madness inherited from the father 
they had led away to a padded cell ? 

Darkness smashed down as the light 
w’ent out. The window was momentarily 
a blue oblong, flickering with the electric 
radiance of lightning. 

“Leila !” A voice came up to her. “Open 
up. It’s Stan, Leila. Stan !” 

Stan ! He had come for her as he had 
come for her father. He had come to 
drag her, shrieking, to the same chamber 
of horrors where Justin Moore had agon- 
ized. 

He would have to catch her first! If 
she were mad she would avail herself of 
a lunatic’s cunning. From a window at 
the end of the passage rain-spout clamps 
made an easy ladder to the ground. Tlie 
storm would hide her, she would bury 
herself in the woods — Leila got the 
door open behind her, flung out into the 
hall. 

Thunderous crash of the portal below 
met her, and the tempest’s howl, blasting 
in through the house. The sound whirled 


her startled glance in its direction. The 
stairs were in darkness. 

Stan’s feet thudded on the steps, com- 
ing up. 

Lightning glimmer threw Stan’s climb- 
ing shadow against the wall, made visible 
the face of a crouching figure. It was 
the grizzled, distorted face of Foster Cor- 
bett ! Of Stan’s own father I Waiting for 
his son with a revolver uplifted in his 
hand! 

“Stan!” Leila screamed. “Look out. 
He’s— ’’ 

A shout drowned her out, a blast of 
bestial fury. Somewhere a shot blazed, 
and then the world crashed in on her. She 
fell headloi^ into a limbo of whirling, 
coruscating sparks. She felt herself lifted 
in powerful arms, felt herself thrown over 
a heaving shoulder. Shouts, shots, echoed 
about her, a gibbering chatter of apelike 
defiance. Rain drenched her, an icy gale 
pounded at her. Oblivion claimed her. 

A T LAST Leila dared to lift her lids, 
bit by slow bit. She blinked. Dark- 
ness was about her, strangely mottled 
with glancing fragments of silvery light. 
Darkness, and glistening, dank rock above 
her. The earthy smell of a tomb in her 
nostrils. 

She was, it dawned on her, in a shallow 
cave. The luminous flecks dancing about 
her were splotches of moonlight shifting 
through the leaves of high trees. A cave ! 
Trees ! This must be West Cliff, then. 

Leila thrust herself up to a sitting pos- 
ture as terror sliced her. Was this the cave 
of the Monster? But there wasn’t any 
Monster, she thought. There was only 
the criized slayer who had hacked Shean 
Rourke with an ax, who had throttled 
Eve Starr, who had crouched with lethal 
gun to shoot down Stan Corbett. Not 
any phantom Monster! Not Justin Mon-

toy either, nor Leila hwself. Foster 
Corbett! 

For a moment Leila forgot her pain, 
her danger, in the jubilance of that revela- 
tion. Dad was no maniac killer, nor was 
she. It was Foster Corbett who had 
schemed with the cunning of the insane to 
slay and pfece the blame for his crime on 
the man he hated. Foster Coi1>ett who 
had dragged a second victim to Leila Mon- 
roy’s bed so that the daughter should be 
doomed t© the same terrible fate to which 
he had condemned the father. Foster Cor- 
bett who, losing all hold on r^on, had 
haunched in th© storm-battered corridor, 
waiting to kill his own son! 

Had he? Had he added filicide to the 
role of his crimes? A sliot had blazed 
across her scream of warning just before 
the madman had whirled to attack her! 


If Stan had fired edtl, tmaniac could not 
have moved so sw scljftllt had been fifed 
at Stan, then, h, t M itself in his 
breast? In the le areaof the man ste

TERROR TALES 


Helpless? Leila Monroy’s lip snarled 
up from her tiny teeth. She was suddenly 
a creature of the wilds. The desperate 
courage of hopelessness entered into her, 
the feral cunning of wilderness’s small 
beasts who will fight, must fight, when 
escape from their persecutors has become 
no longer possible. She stooped, snatched 
handfuls of jagged stones from the cave 
floor, flitted to its entrance, silent as a 
cloud. 

T EILA peered out and down, slyly cau- 
tious. There he was I Like a huge, 
black spider clinging to the splattered, bare 
precipice. Working his way up, indomita- 
bly, slowly by the necessity of finding 
handholds, footholds, in the bare, sheer 
rock face. Hidden now by a pool of 
stygian shadow, revealed now by frag- 
ments of leaf-splintered moonlight. In- 
exorably climbing to add her to the dread- 
ful list of his victims. 

Distorted by the eerie light he was 
somehow unhuman, somehow a monster 
of primitive evil, spewed out of the past. 
And Leila Monroy, the weak thing he 
hunted, was primitive, too. Primitive and 
pitiless. Her hand flew back, arced for- 
ward. A stone left it — and struck fair on 
the skull of the maniac! The crunch of 
its landing came up to her, sickened her, 
but she flung another stone and another. 
A dark splotch apf>eared on his forehead, 
and then the man let go his holds, plunged 
down, a black, sprawling figure, crashed 
terribly in the underbrush below. 

A thrill of triumph ran through Leila, 
a hot thrill of triumph that was a torrid 
flame boiling in her blood. Her laugh, 
bubbled up in the dark silence of the for- 
est. A shrill, thin cacchination of black 
laughter, spilling from her gaping throat, 
rioting out in the rain-washed night. 

It was horrifying! Her throat clamped 


on it. She checked it, icy with loathing 
of the savagery that had inspired it, quiv- 
ering with revulsion at the thing she had 
become. She had killed a man and laughed 
with joy at the deed. She, Leila Monroy ! 
Qiff and forest, whirled about her in a 
sudden vertigo. The hot flush of joy at 
Corbett’s thumping fall, the jubilant 
laughter, were these the reactions of san- 
ity ? Soaring glee at killing — only a luna- 
tic could feel it, only a homicidal maniac. 

“Murder! While insane!” What if the 
incredible acts she had ascribed to Foster 
Corbett were fetid illusions of her own 
darkened mind? What if she were, in- 
deed, the lunatic slayer and he a good 
neighbor trying to save her from herself, 
the victim of her mania? What if her 
hand, that had slain him, was gory already 
with the blood of Eve Starr and of Stan ! 

No! Not Stan! That, at least, was 
clear to her even in her bewilderment. If 
Stan were slain she could not have slain 
him. There was the test. Only a madman 
would kill his own son. Corbett or she. 
She or Corbett. If Stan were alive, she 
was the maniac. If he were dead — 

If he were dead — the thought slashed at 
her like a sword. That she should hope 
for his death — her Stan! Broad-shoul- 
dered, upstanding, frank -eyed. No! Rath- 
er that she be condemned to the eternal 
perdition of raving madness, rather that 
she take a knife and slice it across her 
own throat. . . . Bullets do not always 
kill! Was he lying thqre, wounded, des- 
perately wounded, suffering? Not dead 
but bleeding to death while she dallied 
here, delaying the aid that might save him ? 

Leila licked dry lips with a trembling 
tongue. She was down on her knees on 
the narrow ledge that made a sort of 
porch to the caye. She swung over it, 
was scrambling for footing against the 
sheer wall of the rock, was inching down 
that perilous descent, while weakness was 


PRIESTESS OF MURDER 


17 


Kke water in her limbs, while pain was a 
network of agony meshing her frail form. 

“Stan 1”- 

His name was a pra 3 ?er on her lips as 
she attained the cliff’s foot at last, as she 
sent one shuddering glance at the still 
mound, blacker against black, that her 
missies had flung there. “Stan I” 

She plunged into the thicket. 

A TWISTED root caught Leila’s foot, 
^ pounded her headlong into the mire. 
She lay as she fell, heaving in great 
breaths of the dank air to her tortured 
lungs, fighting for strength to rise, to go 
on. The forest silence closed in on her, a 
black pall of soundlessness. 

Not altogether soundless. A vague, 
ominous slither threaded it. It lifted Lei- 
la’s head with a jerk, despite the darts of 
agony shooting through her at even that 
slight effort. It pulled her burning stare 
through the tree-boles that were grotesque 
giants reaching writhing arms down to 
pluck her from her miry bed. 

And then her scalp suddenly tightened. 

It drifted almost silently toward her; 
wraithlike, phantasmal. ... A vagrant 
beam caught it full — and a scream formed 
in Leila’s breast, tore her constricted 
throat, died at her lips. 

The phantom of Eve Starr was gliding 
toward her between the ebon trees. Eve 
Starr, whose corpse Leila had seen con- 
torted in awful death on the gore-stained 
counterpane of her own bed ! 

CHAPTER THREE 

A Dreamiand of Dread 

T EILA MONROY’S blood jelled with- 
^ in her veins. Supernal terror 
■queezed her heart as the apparition's 
ghastly approach held her eyes with the 
tppalled but helpless stare of a reptile- 
ludnated bird. 


And a twig snapped beneath Eve Starr’* 
feet! 

The sharp crackle of dried wood break- 
ing beneath the pressure of a careless foot, 
so little a thing to save one from blither- 
ing madness ! It forced reason into Leila’s 
shuddering terror, stung her to sanity with 
the realization that this was not a disem- 
bodied ghost advancing toward her 
through the obscurity of the fear-filled 
wood, that it was flesh and blood, that it 
was — 

“Eve!” Leila moaned, finding strength 
somehow to stand up. “Eve!” 

Startled, the dusky-haired girl swung 
around to her, fright distorting her blood- 
less countenance. 

“Who’s there?” she gasped. “Who is 
it ?” Her eyes were bumed-out coals, dark 
horror pitting the blanched whiteness of 
her visage. “Who — ?” 

“It’s Leila, hon. Leila Monroy.” 

“Leila !” Stark terror in that gusted ex- 
clamation. “Leila !” 

Her hand went up to her throat — ^to the 
blue bruises that splotched its whiteness, 
the marks of throttling fingers. Of whose 
fingers ? Leila Monroy knew that she must 
ask the terrible question, though she was 
terrified of what the answer might be. 

“Eve,” she blurted. “Eve! Who did 
that to you? Who? Was it I? Was it I, 
Eve?” 

“Leila !” Eve hadn’t heard her. “Don’t 
touch me.” Or had she heard and was 
this the awful answer to the momentous 
question? “Keep away.” 

The girl whirled, dashed away. 

Started to dash away. She stumbled, 
went to her knees, snatched for support 
at the rattling withes of a low bush, 
swayed there in pitiful weakness. She was 
feeble, so feeble. The cold and the damp 
of the woods would kill her before morn- 
ing if she were left here alone. 

“Eve,” Leila said, not moving, not dar- 
ing to move. “I won’t hurt you." Al-

^ keep just ahead of bw, just beyond 
reach. She was a flitting, staggering form 
just ahead of Leik, always just ahead, 
dwayv just about to drop, but somdiow 
kecfmg <m i^r feet, somehow maintain- 
ing a httle ^>ace between them. The rea- 
son for her riiase slid away from Lrik. 
She knew emly that she must catch the 
luminous wraith she pursued, knew onty 
tliat rile most keep going through the 
nightmare blackness of the impeding for-

sson was upon Her — 

A denser grouping of stygian tree- 
trunis swallowed Eve for an insUait. Leila 
phu^d thrm^ them — st<^|>ed. Had 

disappeared. She wasn’t anywhere in 
s^t, and there was no sound to tell where 
she had gone. 

Had she, after, been pursuing a phan- 
tom created hy her own mad brain? Was 
rile doomed forever to wander m a dream- 
land of dr^id in which siis would be un- 
able to distinguish the from the un- 
real? Doomed forever— see, these very 
trees seemed instinct with a baleful life. 
They semed to be closh^^ in on h^. 

One of them aur movii^, was coming 
toward her with a slow, iidmitely evil de- 
liberatiott. It couldn’t be moving! She 
was imagunng it. How could a tree move ? 

It wasn't a tree. It was a bent, massive 
%ure of a man ; huge, browless head set 
neckires on gargauiriuan shoulders ; 
iHonzed, naked torso gleaming eeri^ in 
the moonlight j IMe, pi^-like e 3 fes Row- 
ing redty out of an imbeciUc, droding 
countenance. It was the Mon^r of the 
Qiff! 

But she had killed the Monster. No, 
fliat was {’Foster Corbett she had killed. 
This Monster didn’t exist. It was a fig- 
ment of Her kns^narion, this bestial thing 
that crept inexord»ly toward her. It 
wasn’t there at all and she wouldn’t 
run from it. If she didn't run from it it 
would vanish smd she would be sane again. 
She must not be afraid of it. She must 
not be afraid of the big-muscled arms that 
seemed to reach out for her, of the stubbed 
and fearful talons. 

That closed on her arms with a sud- 
den, fearful pain diat told her the thing 
was real. That told her too late diat it 
was rcjU. 

Ldla screamed, hut tfie shrill cry of lier 
terror and her ^ony was drowned by the 
ferocious, overwhelming roar of the Moa-

6ter. Towering over her, he slammed her 
against the shaggy, unyielding bark of a 
giant tree behind her, trying to crush her, 
it seemed, into the very heart of the quiv- 
ering timber, driving breath from her so 
that she could scream no longer. 

She could not scream, but she could 
flail desperate fists against the steel-hard 
thews of his giant arms. The beast laughed 
at her puny efforts — chatteringly, gibber- 
ingly. His black-lipped mouth opened to 
display yellow, rotted fangs, a cavity in 
which the flesh was not red but a hideous 
black. 

Leila writhed, jerked free. Almost 
jerked free. The Monster’s knee came 
up, thrust excruciatingly into the softness 
of her abdomen, pinned her helpless 
against the rough tree-bark behind that 
cut through her flimsy dress and stabbed 
her with countless tiny points. Pinned her 
helpless, so that one of his bestial paws 
released its grip and flew to the neckline 
of her frock. It tore downward, as the 
seamed, hairless countenance mowed with 
insensate, obscene glee. 

“Pretty,” the thing chattered. “Pretty,” 
and his leathery palm fumbled at Leila’s 
breast, rasped it with a lewd caress. “Cal- 
ban likes.” 

rpHE girl’s hand spatted against the in- 
durated cheek, her toes banged at the 
Monster’s shins. He squealed like a stuck 
pig and his fingers flew to her throat, 
clutched it, constricted. 

Leila’s lungs pumped unavailingly, fight- 
ing for air they could not find. The brutal 
digits tightened still more, till the girl 
thought they must cut right through the 
flesh, must squeeze clear through her 
neck. Knives stabbed and twisted within 
her chest, invisible fingers gouged at her 
eyes. The glaring, ferocious visage of 
her tormentor vanished in a great, roaring 
blackness. 

Through which she seemed to hear a 


high, piercing whistle. 'The roaring in her 
skull was drowned in the blast of Cal- 
b^'s feral roar. The whistle came again, 
and Leila crashed to the ground as the 
terrible grip on her throat, the pinning 
thrust of the bestial knee, were released. 

Leila wallowed in her distress, while 
somewhere above her a tumultuous sound 
crashed momentarily and died away. She 
pulled air into the sore agony of her 
lungs. 

“Leila,” Stan cried, somewhere above 
her. 

It wasn’t Stan. It couldn’t be Stan. 
Stan was l 3 nng dead in the old house that 
had suddenly become an abode of horror. 
Stan had bled to death there because she 
had not been able to get to him in, time to 
save him. 

“Leila, darling 1” 

Hands were tugging at her, were roll- 
ing her over. Stan’s hands. His dear 
face was looking down at her, anxiety 
clouding his eyes. Stan’s face . . . 

“Leila! Speak to me. Leila!” 

The girl sat up. He was dishevelled. 
His trooper’s uniform was gashed, tom 
by the tearing brambles of the forest, 
and there was a livid weal across his 
tanned cheek that a lashing tendril had 
mbde. But he was alive. It was Stan who 
had saved her, at the last possible moment, 
from an awful death. 

“Stan! What — how did you get here? 
How ....?” 

“I was knocked out, there in your 
house, I came to, heard the back door 
close. I rushed out there and saw you 
vanishing into the woods. I’ve been hunt- 
ing for you . . . 

“Then wasn’t . . . 

“Don’t talk now,” Stan silenced her. 
“You’re hurt, exhausted. When I get you 
home, get you warm, you can tell me all 
about it.” 

He was tender, solicitous. He loved her 
•tiil. Leila nestled in his arms, thrilling

to his strengtfi, thrilling to tlie feel of his 
heart beating ^inst her own. She would 
(^yey him, she wo«ld keep qniet ior a few 
mititJtes. If started to talk, if ^ told 
him that it had been Eve be had seen, 
not her, she would have to tell him the 
rest. 

She would have to tel! him that the 
girl hi his arms bad killed his father. How 
could she tel! him that? How could she? 

The black trees of the forest slid by, 
nistling in the night. Leila whimpered. 
“Hush, darling/' Stan murmured. “We’ll 
soon be out of this. We’ll soon be where 
it’s warm and light.” 

Light. Would there ever be light again 
in her dark soul? Daricer than ever now. 
Thought burred through Leila’s aching 
brain. Stan had been attacked in the 
house, had been Imecked unconscious. 
That was evident. Foster Corbett must 
have done that, Iyit% in ambush. Ttien 
Leila must be san& 

But Eve Starr's actions bad confirmed 
tlie awftd speculation that it was Leila 
who had attacked her. Leila, in whose 
mind no m^ory remained of the terri- 
ble deed. That proved her insane. 

There wasn’t any answer. There c»uld- 
n’t be any answer, because she didn’t 
know tow much of her experiences was 
real, bow much she had forgotten, how 
modi she tod imagined. The Monster, 
for instance. Stan’s comii^ had saved 
her fr«n him, but Stan didn’t seem to 
kjiow anything about him. Had that 
lecherous attack been only her own mad- 
ness? Had her own mamac fingers tom 
the clothes from her shoulders; clamped, 
tightening, about her own throat? 

Or had Stan’s call, his ttocshing 
approach, frightened the brute away be- 
fore the trooper could see him ? 

Over Stan’s shoulder Leila saw a 
shadow move, high up on the bough of a 
tree. It liaunched, came sprawling down; 


great aims fialKng; spread, spatuiate 
talons clawing for Stan’s throat I 

CHAPTER POWt 

Masur oi dw Moaitn* 

66CTAN 1” Leila Monroy shrieked and 

‘^contorted in his arms, driving her 
forehead against bis chest. This instan- 
taneous inspiration of her terror was the 
only thing that could have saved her 
lover. It imbalanced him, sent him reeling 
backward, and the downdropping mon- 
ster missed his mark. 

The brute crashed down into the under- 
brush, was m^entarily tangled in the 
whipping leaves, in that instant Leila 
slipped from Stan’s hold as the trooper 
recovered his footing and reached for his 
hollered gua. Calban bdlowed, soared 
frcHn the ground. His stoggy arm lashed 
ahead of him with a cotoa’s lightning- 
like lash, sU'uck Stan’s gun-wrist, pound- 
ed the weapon from it Its metallic gieain 
sliced into the underbru^ and the antag- 
onists came t^ether with a thud of fiesh 
against fie^ that was thunderous to the 
terrifiai girl. 

Stan’s fists pumped, two flashing i«s- 
tons, into Calban’s taut belly. The mon- 
ster’s* muscle-bulging arms damped 
around the trooper in a rib-cracking 
clinch. They swayed, black and gigantic 
in the eerie fore^ light and from the taut 
straining agony erf that cdinch burst an 
appalling cacaphony of bestial sounds, 
of growls and vicious snarls. 

A shrill, piercing squeal forced by un- 
endurable pain frem a strong man’s Ups 
galvanized Leila into action. She dre^ped 
to her knees, searching frantically in the 
meshed, baffling underbrush for Stan’s 
gun. The tumult of that eerie battle in- 
creased, behind her, A chattering, mind- 
less scream signalled that Stan had got 
heme a telling blow. 


PRIESTESS OP MURDER

“Run, Leila,” the man yelled. “Get 
iway. I can’t — hold him.” 

The girl twisted, saw Calban, momen- 
tarily driven away from Stan, closing in 
again. Her lover met the renewed attack 
by a ferocious uppercut exploding from 
a crouch. His fist landed on the monster’s 
jaw with the blast of a rifle shot, his other 
fist crashed against the brute’s chest. The 
devastating blows might have been Ricks 
of a fly’s wings for all the effect they had. 
Calban was not even staggered. His huge 
paw closed on Corbett’s neck, engulfing 
it with its vast span. His swarthy other 
hand drove for the man’s groin. 

Somehow a thick stick was in Leila’s 
hand and she was hurling herself, shrill- 
ing primitive fury, at the monster. Her 
improvised club pounded against Calban’s 
forehead. He roared, with anger rather 
than pain, and the hand that was reaching 
for Stan’s groin flicked sidewise instead. 

It struck Leila in midair, catapulted 
her backward, crashing her into the 
threshing cushion of a bush. Jarred and 
half-stunned, she saw Calban’s attack 
focus again on Stan, saw her lover swept 
from his feet, saw him lifted high above 
the grisly creature’s head by straining 
arms shaggy with a beast's black hair. 

The terrible tableau etched itself on 
Leila’s mind. The gorilla-like brute; his 
bestial ferocity the more horrible for the 
fact that he was no beast but a man de- 
graded, obscenely decadent; poised mo- 
mentarily motionless as he gathered his 
forces for the throw that would smash 
Stan to a pulp. Above his head Stan was 
as motionless — rigid and helpless in the 
gigantic grip of Calban’s leathery hands 
at armpit and crotch, his face contorted 
and pallid, his eyes staring in agony. 

T70R an eternal moment that awful 
pause persisted. And then the lurid 
gleam of Calban's beady, savage eyes 
flared more redly and the muscles in his 


huge arms writhed snakelike beneath their 
hairy skin, and Leila knew that in the next 
instant they would sweep downward. 

From somewhere a whistle shrilled, 
high and piercing, through the quivering 
terror of the woods. It came again, the 
strange high sound that once before 
Leila had heard through black clouds of 
death swirling about herself. It froze Cal- 
ban to an astounding paralysis, leashed 
him as though it were a chain writhing 
about his savage limbs. Leila could almost 
see the death-thought seep unwilling from 
the black and terrible frame. 

Calban’s protest was a grisly roar blast- 
ing through the black forest aisles. The 
huge arms bent, slowly, reluctantly, let- 
ting Stan down. 

The trooper twisted abruptly, freed 
himself from Calban’s loosening grip. He 
thudded to the ground, sprang erect, snarl- 
ing ... . 

But the monster was gone, had fJunged 
away into the veiling thickets. For 
minutes the lovers heard the threshing of 
his huge, evil body moving away, and 
then a sinister silence close about them. 
A silence sinister because it cloaked not 
only the ravening man-beast, but another 
mysterious entity, a lurking, invisible be- 
ing who was master of the Monster, 
whose whistling command the brute 
obeyed even in the height of his frenzy. 
Twice Leila had heard the weird whistle, 
twice it had saved her. 

Not her, but Stan! It had been at Stan’s 
approach that the ravening human hound 
had been called away tliat first time, it 
had been Stan whose deadly peril had 
just now been averted. If it were not for 
Stan — 

“God!” the youth groaned. “Who is 
he? Where did he come from?” He pulled 
a trembling hand across his bruised fore- 
head above his glazed, unseen eyes, 
swayed with exhaustion. “Why did he 
quit, just when he was about to slam me

loss of blood he had fainted once more.

shadowed aisles, not knowing where she

that she bad herself iodtod it from toe 
ktside. 


PRIESTESS OF MURDER

Unhqjed for safety, tantalizingly 
offered at the last moment, was snatched 
away. Leila whirled to meet the fate from 
which she had fled. 

Silver of the setting moon sluiced an 
empty field. No one, nothing, was there. 
She had outdistanced her invisible pur- 
suer, had left him behind in the forest. 

Or had he fooled her as she had 
thought to fool him? Had he left her flee- 
ing blindly through the woods while he 
turned back to pounce upon and destroy 
the lover she had planned to save by her 
rejected sacrifice? 

Something moved, there in the ribbon 
of darkness that was the forest-edge 
across the fields. Something moved and 
came lumbering out into the brooding 
lunar luminance. A two-headed, grotesque 
monster, it came slowly, inexorably out of 
the shadows. Gelid fingers clutched Leila’s 
throat. What nightmare thing was this, 
what awful spawn of the dark forest? 

The porch floor heaved beneath her 
feet, threw her back against the paint- 
peeled door. It wasn’t there ! She fell 
backward through it, fell against a warm, 
feminine figure. 

“What’s the matter?” Eve Starr ex- 
claimed. “Where have you been?” 

“Dose the door,” Leila screamed. 
"Close it.” Somehow she was on her feet 
again, had her hand on the wood of the 
portal. She threw a single terrified glance 
through the opening — 

And checked the closing panel. Nearer 
and distinct now in the silvery light, she 
saw what it was that had come out of the 
woods. Saw Stan’s lolling, pallid face. 
Saw that he was leaning heavily on the 
shoulder of another man. Of — her blood 
was a black flood in her veins — of Foster 
Corbett! Of his grizzled father who she 
thought lay dead at the foot of West 
Qiff’s high parapet! 

She knew now who was Calban’s mas- 
ter. She knew now whose high, shrill 


whistle it was that had twice drivoi the 
monster from his prey — ^to save Stan 
Corbett-

Leila Monroy twisted to her, fell back 
in astonishment. The girl whom last she 
had seen with a few shreds of torn cloth- 
ing fluttering from her lacerated, almost 
naked form was fully dressed, her hair 
carefully arranged, no signs of the wild 
night about her. 

“I saw your lights come on, after the 
storm and I came over to see if anything 
was the matter. I found — ” 

Eve cut off as stumbling feet pounded 
on the boards outside the door, as Foster 
Corbett staggered in with his grey-faced, 
limp burden. 

“Stan! Mr. Corbett! In the name of 
all that’s holy what’s been going on here?” 

"Never — mind — now,” the older man 
grunted. “Help me.” 

Leila jumped to his side. Eve. To- 
gether the three lifted Stan from his wav- 
ering legs, carried him in to the living 
room where, hours ago, Leila had cringed 
from the whispered lash of fancied voices 
and laid the youth on the couch there. 
Stan groaned, his lids flickered open. 

“Where — where — Dad !” His eyes 
lighted up. "Leila 1 You — ^you’re both 
here. Both all right ?” 

“Fairly all right, son,” the old man an- 
swered. 

There was a black bruise on his brow, 
another on his check. His clothing was

he had fallen, his shoes were packed with

“We'll do. But you need a doctw. I’ll

“No.” Stan sboved himself up to a 
sitting position and Leila winced as his 
face twitetod wit^ the pain of the effort. 
“No. I'm kind of frayed at the edges, 
but I’B tart. Tm Itae Eve. I wutt to know 
wltfd this ta all atawt.” 

Leila started to spesdt, but the old man 
beat her to it. 

“We’d an fike to know that, Stan. Sup- 
pose you give us your story first” 

He was starting wrong end to, Leila 
thought There was a reason for that. 
He was conoeating sometiikig. Of course 
he was concealing something. He was Cal- 
ban’s master. Kc was die moving force 
behind aU the terrible evente of Ae night 
and he wanted first to hear how much 
the others know before he ceacocted his 
own stery to fit. She w8irido*l interfere. 
She’d keep quiet and give hia rope eimugh 
to liang himself, and then . . . 

But Stan was tafidng. "I tried to get to 
Leila, after the Iwti, but she was gone by 
the time I managed to shore through the 
crowd. I saw Eve though, told ho* to t^ 
Leila I'd come to her as soon as my tour 
of duty was over. 

"The storm eaug^ me as 1 came up ffte 
road. Leila’s lights were all on. Z heard 
a sere«n from the house, and she didn’t 
answer when I knocked on the door. That 
scared me. I went frantic started to batter 
down tte door. The lights weat out Just as 
it gave way. I ploughed in, yefiiz^ for her. 
The lightning showed me she wasn’t on 
the lower floor. I started up the stak-s. I 
heard her scream again. A shot jabbed 
me. It seared across my ribs, jolted me 
off balance. 

"I guess I must have gone down on my 
head and knodced myself out, because ffM 
noct thing I knew, it seemed a long time 


after, I heard the door dose ami ^w her 
nmmi^ into &e woods.” 

Leila's eyes Sicked to Eve. The girl 
was listening open-mouthe<^ did. not in- 
terrupt to correct Stan’s misapprehension. 
That was queer. Queer as her evident ig- 
norance of all tlmt had happased to her, 
or had seemed to have- ham^ened to her. 
If she had lain,. a]^)at«ntly dead, on the 
bed above, if she had run, screatmng in 
terror of Leila herself, ffiroi^ the woods, 
how couki she be so nea^ dres^d, so 
uadtatmibed? The awful di^bt of her 
own reason closed in once more on Leita 
with ks nameless fear. 

“Tinaeceuntably ttie brute chipped me, 
and — and I fainted again from loss of 
Wood,” Stan fitirehed. ‘Then you were 
bending over me. Dad, Mfere hrfpii^ me 
up."^ 

“How about you, Leila?” Fortw Cor- 
bett tamed to her. “What’s your end of 
the story?” 

TTIS eyes bored into her, and in their 
rheumy depths she saw littie light* 
of triumph crawl. If she answered, she 
must convict herself—of ^eer, incredible 
madness. Of madness! How coidd she 
tell of filing Eve apparaidy dead, of the 
strange scene of her terror in the woods, 
when the girl hersdf was so calm, so tm- 
perturbed, so evidently ignorant of it 
that? How could confess to the at- 
tack on Stan’s father? 

Her month opened, dosed again. She 
swayed, put out a gro|mig hand to the 
arm of a chair to keep hw-sdf fn»i fall- 
ing. And Eve (ame to her rescue ! 

“Can’t yon s« how weak she is, Mr. 
Corbett,” the dark-haired girl indignandy 
exdained as she jumped to Leila’s ude 
ami hdped her into the diair. “She can’t

“But we’ve got to get at the bottom of

taken charge of the aituatloa in order to 
co\'ec up his own guilt? "How come you 
were out there in die woods at this time

window to try and see k she were alone

some one among them just at the spot 
where we found Shean Rourke, a dark, 
crouching figure watching the Monroy 
house. There was som«hing ksdescrih-

oil me diat perhaps we had been all wroig 
aboot Justin^s beiri^ Rourice’s murderer,

kitchen porch, was sliding into a window 
up there. 

‘T knew that because of ray own warn- 
ing- Letk wonld not open the door to me. 
By the time I got her to understand, the 
prowler woidd catch her, would kill her. 
My orfly course was to go after him the 


way he had entered, try to ca^ him be- 
fore be did any dems^e. 

"The sfl»m redoubled in violeiice and 
I am an- man. R tetJc me hours, it 
seemed,, before I managed to get to tiv:‘ 
house, before I managed to climb tip to 
diat snudl, slanting roof. I heard a muf- 
fled scream from icsnk as I gcA into toe 
room up toere, heard a damnal^ paadc- 
motilum: gmng an. The room was pitdi 
bkde and a minute passed before 1 found 
toe- door sxtd got out into the halt 

“Just as I did so, the door crashed in 
behtw. 1 twisted to the stskway, ht^d 
some c«ie shout down there as he came in, 
could not make out the words. Then I 
recc^nized Stan's voice, and in the same 
instant some one screamed behind me. 

“Some one scre^uned and a bkxk form 
surged at me from somewhere behind, 
struck me. The blow j<^ted my finger that 
was preseiflg the trigger e£ tl% gun and 
fired the shot. I whipped around, m time 
to see that same dark, gfrotesque form 
pounce on Leila and carry her ofiF. I 
shouted, did not dare shoot for of 
hitting her. 

“The invader hurtled along the corridor, 
dived kU:o a room at the very end. I went 
after Win, yeHing for Stan.” 

“I was out, dad, and didn’t hear you.” 

“So 1 know now. That rowi door was 
jammed, and by the time I opened it the 
chamber was empty. But the window was 
open and torough it I saw the kidnaper 
vanishing into the wood, Leila on his 
shoulder. I saw that he must have climbed 
down a rainspout that passed the window, 
but I didn't dare follow that way. 

“The head of the back stairs, however, 
was at this end of the corridor. I ran 
down them, out through the back door 
^ain, across the fields and into the forest 
where I had seen the fellow vanish. 

“In the storm I couldn’t trail him. I 
shouted, fired off my gun in the hope 
Leila woidd respond. In vaki. Then the 


26 


TERROR TALES 


storm was over, as suddenly as it had 
begun. The clouds started to break. Moon- 
light, sifting through, showed me tram- 
pled bushes, shreds of a girl’s clothing 
caught on briars. I followed that trail, 
reached the face of West Cliff. Just above 
where the spoor ended I saw the mouth 
of a cave, thought I sensed movement 
within it. Possibly, I thought, my shots 
had scared the kidnaper away and Leila 
was alone up there. I started to climb 
up to it. Suddenly rocks started to fly 
down at me. One struck me on the head. 
I felt myself falling, struck and lost con- 
sciousness.” 

TT FITTED, Leila thought, his story 
■*' fitted. Was it the truth or a tissue of 
lies? Somehow it explained everything 
too patly, everything except who the Mon- 
ster was and where he had come from, 
except the mystery of Eve Starr’s weird 
part in the dreadful night. Eve’s face 
was an expressionless mask, her unfath- 
omable eyes fixed on Corbett’s seamed, 
horribly tired countenance. 

“When I came to I heard the sounds 
of struggle, far-off. A pile of dead leaves 
had cushioned my fall, I wasn’t badly 
hurt. I staggered to my feet, ploughed 
tlirough the woods, and found Stan, 
knocked out.” 

Or had he come on that scene just a 
little earlier, in time to whistle off Calban, 
in time to send the Monster ravening 
after her through the woods. Was he 
playing still for a chance to get her alone, 
to finish her? The speculation wrenched 
a groan from the bemused girl. 

“Leila !” Eve exclaimed. “You’re white. 
You look as though you were going to 
faint, ni get you some water.” 

She was out of the room as her sen- 
tence ended. The kitchen door swung 
closed behind her. 

“Leila,” Foster Corbett spun to her. 


“What do you know of Eve's actions to- 
night? Have you seen her?” 

A scream sliced across her amazing 
question, a scream from behind the kitdi- 
en door. Corbett slewed around. Gun in 
hand, he hurled himself across the room, ‘ 
pounded that door open. The brick-walled 
room beyond was starkly, gruesomely va- 
cant, but the back door was just slam- 
ming shut and from beyond it a thin, high 
wail of infinite terror told where Eve had 
vanished. 

“He’s got her, now,” the old man 
yelled. “I was wrong. Come on, Stan!” 
And then he, too, was gone into the grisly 
night. 

CHAPTER SIX 

Monster at Play 

T EILA MONROY came up out of her 
chair, fighting the intangible but cloy- 
ing threads of her weakness, fighting a 
giddy nausea that whirled within her skull 
and tweaked at the pit of her stomach. 
Through that dizzy whirlpool she saw 
Stan’s vague form dart past her, lurched 
to follow it. The room seemed to whirl 
about her as she moved, there was a wall 
where the door should be, a wall into 
which she jolted. 

Half-stunned, she pawed at the parti- 
tion, found the door away from which 
she had reeled in her vertigo, reeled 
through. The kitchen, a place of black, 
threatening shadows, danced about her. 
She staggered across it, stabbed at the 
outer door, missed it, pulled in an agoniz- 
ing breath and tried again. 

This time Leila contrived to grab the 
doorknob as it went by and steadied her- 
self by it. Gripping the jamb with her 
other hand, she fought to get the porta! 
open, succeeded. 

Something lay, a black, unmoving bulk, 
on the porch outside. Stan! It must be

Stan, her bemidered >ald»ed at her 
and she went to her knees beside it. Sbe 
pij^ed. at it, her ^durred visimi stiH re* 
fumg to clear. . . . 

The bo^ cfone suddei^ alire. R^led 
over. The apdit^, ferodous v»ag^ of 
die Monster glared at her, Uack 
curling aw^ from jreMow fangs la a 
strange, jabbering laugh of bestial tri- 
umph. 

A scream sUced her throat and then 
Calhan's gigantic arms flawed around her, 
crushing her to him, crudung. her ribs, 
clamping tha^ scream to sileaoe ia her 
breathless lue^. He surged to his fed, 
bringing her with him as though she 
had no weight at all. He lid'ched beck 
into the house with her. 

Throi^k the kitchen, the Uric^ room, he 
ploughed, chudding lewd glee. Into the 
foyer he sliouldered., the piggish little 
eyes under his beetling brows lurid with 
an obscene light, his calloused, rasping 
fingers writhing as though with sane, vile 
life of thek own on her shrinking, quiv- 
ering flesh. Leila’s larynx swells! once 
more with, a shriric, but Celban caught her 
intention by some unhuman second-sight 
ami gagged her— -j^ged her horriMy with 
the pressure of his slobbering, evU lips 
on hers in a kiss of ulrimate horror. 

Crushed .thus in the visehke cradle of 
the beast-man's arms, ga^ed thus by his 
insuflfierable caress, Leila knew that he 
was carrying her up the broad stairs to 
the passage above. To the passage where 
her own room was, her onmt bed — 

No doubt now, no doubt at ^1, of what 
the brute-man intended. 

No doubt of what he intended or of 
what had happened. He l^d been waiting 
outside, had grabbed Eve and— killed her, 
probably. Foster Corbett had taken ad- 
vantage of the girl’s one cry to get out of 
the way hunself, to get Stan out of the 
way — and had sent back his creature to 
finish off Leila. Stan’s unlocked for pres- 


oice time and tsne again had interfered 
with his macaber jdans, but SSan was out 
of the ymy now »id Lrila was in Cal- 
ban’s power, being carried up to the room 
where the mght's horror had begun and 
now would' be consummated. 

Calban was m the- room, thrusting the 
doew sl^ with a doKtrouB foot as he 
passed thrm^ iL twisting to the bed with 
a swift surety that told of curious famili- 
arity with its loc^ion. Even in that ter- 
rible moment Leila noted that, noted that 
her white s^n'ead was rumpded and blood- 
flecked, that the indenmtion of a contorted 
figure w^ stifi visible on it Then Cal- 
ban had flm^ her shmnii^y down on the 
bed, had pihned her to it with a digging, 
cruel knee as he tore avidly at what was 
left of her clothing. 

“Pre^,” he jabbered, as he had jab- 
bered before in the forest. “Pretty. Cat- 
ban likes.” 

He pai^d to ^oat over the quivering 
beauty his violating paws had revealed. 
“Calban likes very much.” 

Leila’s tortured eyes fled from the evil 
antietp^m of his thlc^-Hpped, drooling 
mouth, slid past the musdes of his terri- 
ble arms. Her hopeless gare ^id akmg 
the walls of h^ fauniUar room that now 
was a ceil of n»dness and despair, reached 
the door. It was evening! Slowly, silent- 
ly, it was oponing and white fingers jo^ed 
its edge. 

The girl’s heart leaped. 

“Please,” she whimpered pulling her 
gaze back to her tormentor. “Please, Cal- 
ban, let me go.” At all costs she must 
distract his attentiwi, keep him from no- 
tiedng the advent of her rescuer. “111 
pay you. I’ll give you lots of money, 
jewels. ...” 

The Monster gibbered his mindless 
laugh. “Calban no want money, jewels. 
Calban want pretty wanan, white, soft 
flesh of pretty woman. Ijke this — ” 

And suddenly he leaped away from her, 


28 


•reRROR TALES 


leaped to the center of the room and 
whirled to the opening door. Some sixth 
sense had warned him of danger. . . . 

CTAN jumped into the room, a long 
^ carving knife in his hand that must 
have come from the kitchen below. 

"Leila!” he yelled. "Run, jump out of 
the \\ indow. I can hold him long enough !” 

Calban roared, plunged at him. Stan 
met the attack with a darting slash of the 
knife, caught the Monster across the 
knuckles. The beast-man’s other fist 
crashed against the trooper’s shoulder, 
slaTiimed him against the wall. Leila 
screamed, started up from the bed. 

Calban twisted to her. A flick of his 
long arm pounded her back to the creak- 
ing mattress. Stan rebounded from the 
wall, sliced at Calban. The giant sprang 
backward, avoiding the rush, dropped to 
the floor and rolled toward the trooper. 

Leila was out of the bed, was darting 
once more toward the window. Black 
digits closed on Stan’s ankles, heaved 
upward. The trooper was flung high into 
the air. He twisted Hthely, came down on 
his feet, crouched to. meet his snarling ad- 
versary’s lunge. Calban's juggernaut rush 
swerved at the last instant and the girl 
felt the impact of his fists once more, 
blasting her headlong away from at- 
tempted escape. She sprawled, brought up 
thumping against the wall. 

Stan ducked forward, slashed a long 
cut across the other’s leathery cheek. Cal- 
ban squealed, more in rage than pain, 
and exploded into a swift blur of action 
which Leila’s eyes could not follow nor 
Stan avoid. Suddenly that whirling bat- 
tle was static, terribly static, 

Stan hung from the giant’s tight clutch 
on his wrists, hung from arms stretched 
horizontally out from his shoulders in that 
terrific grip. Crucified on an invisible 
cross, the trooper’s body was a taut 
arc of suffering, his face a fish-belly 


white, sweat-wet mask of hideous tor- 
ture. 

A low moan squealed from his rigid 
throat, squealed into sound. "Get out — 
Leila — ^your chance ...” gurgled into a 
nondescript gust of agony as Calban’s 
gargantuan span of whipcord muscle 
widened to crack the bone-jointures in his 
shoulders with the gruesome power of its 
living torture-rack. 

Leila’s way to the door was clear as 
long as Calban held the straddle-legged 
pose he must to continue his grisly tor- 
ment of her lover. This was her chance 
to escape. 

She shoved away from the W'all to 
which that last fierce buffet had flung her, 
came up to her feet. Came up to her feet 
with the light bedroom chair in her hands, 
leaped toward Calban and pounded the 
improvised weapon down on his head. 

The chair splintered, smashed. Calban 
let Stan drop and whirled to Leila, He 
was laughing, actually he was laughing! 

“She-devil,” his twitching Ups spewed. 
“Calban like you that way.” His hands 
lashed out, his fingers dug into the girl’s 
shoulder, sent fiery agony darting through 
her twisting, almost nude body. “Calban 
like woman that can fight, but can’t play 
now. Must finish with man first. Tear 
arms out, legs, like fly’s wings.” 

“No,” Leila screamed. “No. Leave him 
alone. Do what you want with me, but 
leave him alone.” 

^ALBAN’S simian visage was distorted 
by his yellow-toothed, imbecilic grin. 
“Calban do what he like with both.” She 
was helpless, infantile in his great hands 
as he flung her once more on the bed, as 
he ripped the sheets into strips and lashed 
her ankles, her wrists ; lashed them tight- 
ly, cruelly, pulling the knots with sadistic 
violence. The rough edges of the tom 
linen cut into her shrieking flesh, were 
scarlet-edged with oozing blood. 


PRI^r^ OF MURDER 


29 


On the floor behind the sava^ giani a 
Img fodder ran through Stan Corbett^s 
crunip^ itame, and be was crawling, 
«ra\K4ing as a stepped-upoii l^tle might in 
wtuxn life was yet ^te eKtinct. But 
unhke fl»t b^tle the man moved with a 
definite purpose^ A yard beyoid his sh^- 
h^, UooiUess hand lay the knife he had 
dropped. A yard — to his anguish en- 
feeSed body d»t yaid was an infinite ds- 
ta!cee. But if he could reach that knife . . . 

Leila, seeing, stoppered in her throat 
the momjs of her own agony sought to 
wrench from her and contrived a question 
to hold Calban long enough for Stan to 
succeed. 

"What will your master say if you harm 
him? Your master doesn’t want you 
to . . . 

"Cdban have no master,” the brute 
roM’ed, rage flaring into Ws little eyes. 
"No cmc tell Calban what must or must 
not do." Dismay pierced Leila as he 
twisted away from her, as he lurched 
toward Stan, whose scrabbling fingera 
were still mdies away from the Inirfe. 
"No one ..." 

The whistle shrilled in, the whistle that 
twice before had saved Stan. A vague 
figure blotted the window’s dim rectangle. 

"Mr. Corbett," Leila screamed, ‘lie’s 
killing Stan. Calban's killing ..." 

CHAPTER SBVm 

A Bargain with the Rend 

TT WASN’T Foster Corbett who came 
■■■ surging in tlirough the aperture. It 
was Eve t Astoundingly it was Eve. “Cal- 
ban I’’ she yelled. 

The whisfle hadn’t stopped the monster 
this time. He was lifting the lacerated, 
almost unconscious man from the floor 
by one hand, and his ofl\er was at Stan’s 
diroat! 

"Calban!" Eve cried again. "Stop it I" 


The g^nt ^msed. Over the limp^ lolling 
frame of his vidam he ghoed at the dark- 
haired ghiy his face a gargoyiesqiK, de- 
nuxniac visage. 

"No," he chattered. “Calban will not 
be cheated any more. Calbaa will- tdll the 
man, and take the woman, your ties 
w-ill net stop him ^^aiu." 

"Calban! I ^ not lie to you." Gro- 
tesque, hideeua, this cofloquy between the 
slim, daridy-beauti-ful girl whom Leila 
Monroy had known all her Kfe, and tire 
beetle-browed, barrel-chested savage who 
was an atovism from the very dawn of 
time. “It was you who foigot our bar- 
gain and tried to force from me what I 
promised would be yours when you fin- 
ished the task I set you. If you hadn’t 
attacked me, choked me — 

Oh Godt It was blasphemous even to 
think his name in the presence of that 
woman! 

"You — ^you fiend,” Lefla burst out. 
"You brwigtrt him here to kill me. You — ’’ 

Eve’s glance flicked to her, and it ^ung 
Leila aa if &e evil in it were a barbed 
whiplash of frozen sted. 

"Shut up!” she hissed. “You don’t 
count, now," 

Then she was concaitrating on the 
giant. 

“Calban," she pleaded, “tet him go. Let 
him live." 

Lurid %ht-we^ms crawled siuisteriy in 
the brute’s small eyes, “No,” he gnintwi, 
and his throtdmg fillers started again to 
close, bit by cruel bit, on Stan's throat 
“No. You want him, and you’ll never 
give yourself to Calban while he lives.” 

“Tlmt’s it, is it?" Eve’s cry was ab- 
ruptly a hollow whisper of defeat. "That’s 
what I must pay to save him ? Here, then, 
Calban. Htre!" 

Her hands flew to her throat, her fin- 
gers fiT’ '^led at the high, lacy collar tliat 
veiled it. Then the flimsy silk was rip- 
ping; as those white lands tore down 


30 


TERROR TALES 


through it; ripping away from her chest, 
the creamy, heaving rounds of her de- 
sirous breasts, the taut, quivering hollow 
of her abdomen. The shredded fabric slid 
down the long line of her thighs, reached 
the floor, and she threw out her arms to 
the beast-man in an abandon of seduc- 
tion noisome as the uttermost depths of 
Hell, and glorious as Heaven itself. Glori- 
ous because, whatever the woman was, 
whatever evil had driven her, she de- 
scended now into Hades to save the man 
she loved ! 

The man she loved! In that moment 
the whole story was clear to Leila. Eve 
loved Stan and — 

Calban whimpered. He let his victim 
fall. He lumbered; uncouth, shaken by 
the tempest she had aroused within him; 
to the naked, alluring form of the tempt- 
ress, luminous-seeming in the moonlight 
glow. His black arms slid around that 
voluptuous form. . . . 

By some accident of the inscrutable 
fates, Stan had dropped right atop the 
knife he so futilely had struggled to reach. 
His twitching, bloodless hand closed on 
its hilt. . . . 

Eve moaned, shudderingly, as Calban’s 
shaggy arms enfolded her — That moan 
seemed to explode in Stan with a sudden, 
spasmodic strength. He lifted to his knees, 
flung the knife. . , . 

Point first, it was a silver flash streak- 
ing the moonlight, and then it was a black 
excrescence, quivering from the middle 
of Calban’s back. Blood spurted. . . . 

The monster squealed with the sudden 
pain. His great hands gripped the woman 
they had been fondling, flung her from 
him in a paroxysm of rage. She catapulted 
into the wall. The crackling thud of 
crushing bone sickened Leila. . . . 

And then the bound girl was screaming 
in terror for her lover as the wounded 
beast-man whirled and plunged ferocious- 
ly at the trooper, who was swaying on his 


knees, was toppling over from the effort 
alone of throwing that knife. Calban’s 
writhing fingers closed on Stan. . . . 

Thunder crashed in the room. It was 
the thunder of Foster Corbett’s gun. blaz- 
ing from the doorway. Long, orange-red 
jets of flame seared across the room. Cal- 
ban’s great form jolted to the impacts of 
the lethal lead, once, twice. He collapsed 
like a ripped meal sack, rolled over near 
his intended victim, quivered and was still. 

Foster Corbett came in. He was mud- 
covered, from head to foot A blue bruise 
blotched the seamed gray of his face and 
one trouser leg flapped, grotesquely some- 
how in two disjointed halves. 

But the man’s old, tired eyes glowed 
with a strange satisfaction. 

“You gals sure can play hell,” he 
growled, “when you get to fighting over 
a boy.” He picked up the knife and 
sliced Leila’s lashings, then bent to his 
son’s flaccid form. 

“Is — is he — ?” Leila dared not finish 
the question, but Corbett understood and 
answered it. “No. He’s just knocked out 
and he's coming out of it now. He’ll be 
all right by noon, I imagine, right enough 
to stand up with you in front of the par- 
son and — ” 

“He wouldn’t marry me, now,” Leila 
moaned. “He wouldn’t marry the daugh- 
ter of a madman.” 

“Madman, hell,” Corbett grunted, 
swinging around to Eve’s crumpled, 
moaning body. His gnarled fingers 
probed the girl’s hurts with a curious ten- 
temcss. Then, “I’m afraid you’re through, 
Eve,” he said. “Maybe things will be a 
little better for your soul, where it’s going, 
if you tell Leila yourself. ...” 

White lips moved in face that was 
agony incarnate. 

“Yes . . . I . . . swore you , . . never 
would have . . . Stan. Calban . . . imbecile 
living caves . . . West Qi£E . . . everybody 
thought . . . monster. I , . . made friends

A gush of blood burbled from her lips, 
she writlied to a sitting position, threw 
out her arms. “Forgive me, Stan.” 

And then there wasn’t an Eve Starr 
any more. Only a pitiftd, nude corpse, 
slumped in a corner of the dreadful room.

Tke DEVIL’S EMISSARY 



Sinisterly handsome, 
was the stranger who 
brought a secret gift to 
the girl whose dark beauty matched 
his own . . . Whence had he come? 
To what dank place would he soon return — bringing his victim? 


Frances Bra^ Mklciletoii 
(Author of "Death’t Pagm idocktry" ftej. 


A ll day long I had been hoping 
against hope that young Philip 
Rice would reach Palo Alto Plan- 
tation House by supper time. For a full 
year we had heard nothing from him, 
had almost ^ven up any expectation of 
32 


ever hearing from him j^in. So my old 
heart was set fluttering a bit by that per- 
emptory knock, and I went to the door 
myself. Birt when I reached it old Jude 
had already opened it. I caught a glimpse 
of Bob Shane, the only taxi driver in the 


THE DEVIL’S EMISSARY 


33 


county, as he hurried down the graveled 
walk toward the gate. Only a glimpse, 
for he was almost out of sight behind the 
jasmine bushes, and my old eyes had been 
drawn as by a magnet to the stranger who 
stood in the doorway, looking into the 
gathering shadows of the hall. 

I can’t describe him. He was tall and 
slender and dark, with a face of free, wild 
beauty. His eyes were black — that black 
which is a total absence of light, and when 
they looked at me I was lost in them com- 
pletely, filled with that insane desire 
which comes to some men on the sum- 
mits of high places — ^the desire to hurl 
oneself over the parapet to the ground be- 
low. For with all his beauty and grace, 
there was about him something dreadful, 
sometliing terrifying. 

“If you will pardon this intrusion — ” 
the stranger began. And his voice matched 
the rest of him. It was low and vibrant. 
At the sound of it I felt an icy hand close 
hard around my heart. “I bring a — me- 
mento — ^from young Philip Rice,” the 
voice was continuing. “I left him — down 
south there.” 

He made a curious gesture with his 
long, slender, beautiful hands. Never had 
I seen such hands as his, so sensitive, so 
capable. I am an old man and shocks are 
bad for me. I stood there gasping. 

A ND then, quite unexpectedly, he 
smiled, and I knew at once that my 
fears were foolish. I could see that he 
was just an extraordinarily handsome 
man who was asking hospitality at a door 
which for more than a hundred years had 
refused hospitality to none. 

“Come in,” I begged, in confusion. 
“The place is crowded, and I’m afraid I 
must put you in Sherburne Rice’s room — ” 

1 spoke hesitantly, for we never use 
that room at all. It has been called a 
haunted room ever since Sherburne Rice 
the Second hurled a man out of it and 


down the north stairway to the death, of 
a broken neck in the garden. But this 
was All Hallow’s Eve, when all of us 
gather to celebrate tbe date of the house’s 
building. Every room but that was full, 
and I was imwilling to thrust so strange 
a guest upon any of my kin. 

He smiled queerly. 

‘T am sure I shall be at home there,” 
he said. “My name is Minos Dis, and I 
come from a strange, far country. As I 
said, I have brought a remembrance from 
your kinsman, Philip Rice.” 

“For me?” I asked. 

I admit my voice was eager. Young 
Philip had occupied the limelight at the 
family gathering last year. He was an 
explorer, with an already brilliant and 
bewilderir^ history in spite of his youth. 

Again the stranger smiled that strange, 
haunting, extraordinary smile. 

“I do not know yet for whom it is in- 
tended,” he answered, and his voice, 
though low and very, very quiet, had 
something dreadful in it, some hint of 
doom unthinkable. “I have come to 
learn.” 

“And is Philip — ” 

He made a slight gesture with one per- 
fect hand. It silenced me as if those slen- 
der fingers had dosed around my throat. 

“I shall tell you all — presently,” was 
all he said. 

I myself led the way upstairs to Sher- 
burne Rice’s room. I did it reluctantly, 
but I could see nothing else to do. And 
yet, somehow, as I opened the door into 
that orderly but long disused room, I felt 
that there was a certain significance, a 
certain fitness, in ushering that man into 
that particular room. I could not umler- 
stand why I should feel so, but I did. I 
saw to his comfort and left him there — in 
that feared and haunted room. 

And as I walked away, through the dim 
old hallway toward the stairs, the man’s 
strange and foreign sounding name kept 


34 


TERROR TALES 


echoit^ through my mind. It had, some- 
how, a faint familiarity. Minos. . . . 
Had that not been the name of a fabled 
king of Crete? 

A strai^e name; and a strange man 
who laid claim to it, surely. But then, 
our hoi»se has Icmg been used to strange- 
ness and to heartbreak and to dread. It 
is an cdd house, a pioneer house, built 
solidly and substantially of brick. There 
are heavy iron bars at windows. 
There is a huge pantry behind the kildien 
and a deep cistern under the floor. And m 
its time its people have been thankful for 
tlKse thinga. For Palo Alto has a dark 
and flame-shot history. They say that 
pirate gold built it, and that pirate and 
huecaneers tried tg raid it in the old days. 
And it is certain that k withstood a siege 
in 'thirty-six by Santa Ana’s men, and a 
grim and furious battle fought up and 
down hs stairways in 'sixty-five. And, 
more heroic still, when one of its women 
was marooned there in the flood of 'ninety 
nine, she fought off the hungry, drirfc- 
crazed blacks and saved herself and her 
two baby girls from horror indescribable. 
A strong, hard breed, tfiose children of 
fearfully remembered Sherburne Rice, 
who come back, each thirty-first of Oc- 
tober, which is the date ifl the cornerstone, 
to celebrate the building of our bouse. 

COMETIMES strange things h^pen, 
^ yet something always brii^ us to- 
gether again, tiio very fascinaticm, per- 
haps, of the autre and the unpredictable. 
And our very terror urges us to make of 
it a very festive occasion, even riotous, 
with all the Hallowe’en trappings, and 
old wine brought up from the cdlar where 
Rodney Rice’s wife was once walled up 
alive. ... At least we are always glad 
to see each other^ and we always make 
a volant effort to be gay, with games and 


dancing and laughter. . . . But we were 
not gay this year . . . . 

It was dusk when I found Patricia Rice 
standing alone on the wide front gal- 
lery, watching the darkness inarch down 
the turgid river. And I knew she was 
thinking of that time thirty-six years ago 
when the high ground the house stands 
on was an island in a forty-mile-wide 
sweep of muddy, swirling water — and shft 
stood tliere alone . . . Patricia is an old 
woman now, a grave and sensitive and 
understanding woman, and, some people 
say, a little psychic at times. 

She spoke without looking at me. 

‘T don’t like it, Jerry. Something is 
going to happen, and it’s always queer 
things that ha|:^^ in this house . . . 
awful things. . . .” 

“You’re thinking of the old days,” I 
told her. 

“It isn't that, altogether. I can — fed^ 
something. 1 have as eerie a feeling as 
when I carried my babies into the burial 
vault out yonder to escape those mad- 
dened blacks. ... Of course, I do 
ways remember too n:iuch when I come 
here, Jerry. I can’t forget that I stood 
guard beside the bones of Sherburne Rice, 
the Pirate, and Sherburne Rice, the Ter- 
rible, of Reconstnrction days. I can't 
forget that it was the negroes’ terror of 
those very bones that saved me and my 
babies. But I lived through horror 
too. . . . And I had to (dll two men. . . . 
It does something to you, Jerry, g^ves you 
a cert^ power. . . . And I tell you 
something horrible is hovering over us, 
something more horrible than anything 
that has happened yet. . . 

“I wish young Philip Rice was on his 
way,” I grumWed uneasily. “It's been so 
long. . , 

But r couldn’t go on. And for a while 
we stood in silence, we who are old and 
who remember such strange things. As 
for Philip. . . . 


THE DEVIL’S EMISSARY 


35 


TTE HAD come to «s that year for the 
first time. Not one of us had ever 
seen him before. He had just got back 
then from an exploring trip into the heart 
of South America, somewhere where 
white men had never been before. He had 
tried to fly over an inaccessible jungle, he 
explained, but the plane had crashed. He 
had come down in the outskirts of a city 
as yet unknown to white men, a bewilder- 
ingly lovely deserted city. His eyes grew 
rapt as he talked about it ; he seemed to 
be lost in memories. His own enthusiasm 
fired even our earth-bound imaginations. 
He made us feel that place — its unimag- 
inable splendor, its beauty, its vastness, its 
unthinkable antiquity. And as he talked, 
he seemed to me to be the very quintes- 
sence of the Rices, to be possessed of all 
their charm, their beauty, their love of 
adventure and their valor, without those 
darker qualities for which so many of 
them have been famed. I loved the boy, 
and I hated the way his eyes were held 
by Moma Lane. 

A tribe of Indians — Mayas — lived near 
the city, he told us, but they never entered 
it except for religious ceremonies, and 
even then they barred him out. So he 
had to explore it by stealth, taking his 
life in his hands at every venture within 
its sacred walls. He had stiunbled all by 
accident upon a Mayan treasure house. 
The natives would have killed him if they 
had known. 

For these Mayas had a rabid dread of 
white men. Around their fires at night 
they told strange old legends of the Con- 
quistadors, horrifying tales of pillage and 
torture and enslavement. There would 
never be another invasion of white men 
into their land, they swore. Yet, para- 
doxically, they had welcomed Philip, of- 
fered him membership in their tribe, made 
of him a sort of reincarnation of their 
Fair God. And I could understand that, 
looking at him down the table. He was 


one of those fortunates whom people love 
at sight. 

Certainly our whole family fell in love 
with him that night. And he? Well, he 
fell in love with Moma Lane, the step- 
daughter of one of our many cousins. 
She was one of those fair girls whose 
beauty seems to shine, to dazzle men’s 
eyes. And she was captivated with Philip 
— or with the things he stood for. Their 
eyes were locked together while he told 
his tale. She was breathless, eager. And 
she begged him to go back! 

“But you must,” she cried. “Don’t you 
see? You brought nothing out with you. 
You have no proof of your discovery. 
Go back ! Get pictures and specimens, and 
astonish the world. . , . Bring me a 
Mayan amulet, Phil!" 

Philip laughed and shook his head. He 
knew the danger, you see. If he, having 
been a sort of god among the Mayas 
before his escape, should now return. . . . 
It made me shiver even to guess at his 
punishment. Besides, the Mayas had been 
in the habit of sacrificing the incarnations 
of their gods. That old, puzzling, heathen 
idea that the essence of the human god 
must go back at stated times to keep the 
godhead strong was one of the funda- 
mentals of their religion. No one knew 
that better than Philip. . . , 

Yet he did return to his Mayan city. 
We heard about it later, and the news 
had made my heart sink as if under 
leaden weights. I am an old man, and I 
had loved that boy. 

And now some one had come wlio 
claimed to bring us news of him. But 
how weird and strange a messenger ! Yes, 
I believed with Patricia tliat something 
was going to happen. Something dread- 
ful. Something far worse than merely 
strange. . . . 

I^OT one of the darkies would go to 
Sherburne Rice’s room to summon 


36 


TERROR TALES 


our strai^r guest to supper. They made 
various plausible-seeming excuses, but I 
understood. They were afraid. So I 
climbed the weary stairs myself, stairs 
that had been tracked with human blood 
these many tunes. My liand tremUed a 
little as I knocked on Sherburne Rice’s 
door. 

That strange, weirdly melodious voice 
bade me enter, but I did no more than 
open the door. The stranger stood bare- 
headed in the lamplight. The unearthly 
beauty of him struck me with new force. 
My ey^ were so lost in that compelling 
gaze of his that I was barely conscious 
of the box he held between his hands — 
not a large tox but extraordinary, like 
everythit^ else about him. It had tlie look 
of having been made of a single opal; yet, 
impossible as that seemed, I know that I 
thought nothing of it at the time. 

He shook his head slowly at mention 
of supper, be^ed to be excused. -He 
would join us later, he said. And such 
was the sprfi he had me under that I 
cQuW inakE no protest, though deep down 
in me was an almost paralyzing fear. A 
guest who wmdd not eat our salt or brealt 
our bread with us — was not that a gurat 
truly to be feared ? 

But as I turned away from titat hated 
room, a queer choked-off cry jerked my 
thoi^hts away. Terror lent me strength. 
I hurried to Patricia’s door and jericed 
it open and lunged inside. She was stand- 
ing by the hearth in the full light of the 
tall white candles on the mantel. Her 
face was ghastly wHte, and she held both 
hands to her tiiroat. Her eyes, had tiiat 
supernatural look they sometimes have. 

As I cried out at her in terror she low- 
ered Iter hands and turned to loc^ at me. 
Slowly her eyes regained their sanity. 
She swallowed hard. 

“I thought for an instant that — some- 
thing — had me by the throat — ^was throt- 
tling me . . she whispered shakily. “I — 


I don’t know. ... If Sherburne Bice is 
walking — it might be a ghastly business, 
Jerry. It would be like liira to want to 
avenge his kinsman if — ” Her voice died 
in a hoarse rattle in her throat. 

I got Patricia downstairs someliow. 

A DREARY buriness, that ^aipper. One 
of our sudden northers struck the 
^ace just as the meal was served. Before 
the fires could be built up to give adequate 
warmth the house was staridy cold. We 
were all shivering when we came to the 
loaded table. And the wind was crying 
in a bmishee’s dirge through the leaves 
of the live oaks, keoiing under the eaves, 
aioimd the cornices of the old house. A 
hound down in the quarters li fted his voice 
in the eerie howling that tells you death 
is passing. And the negroes moved on 
noiseless feet, their dark skins grey, their 
eyes wild, their hands a-quivcr with ter- 
ror. And I could think of nothing but 
young Philip Rice, whose infatuation for 
an empty-headed girl had sent him into 
what must have been unthinkable fKril — 
and of the stranger who claimed to a>me 
from lum — mid of the cool-eyed, smiling 
Moma Lane who sat acnoss tiie table from 
me. . . . 

We old folks sat about the fire in the 
back parlor after supper, and listenal to 
the shrieks of the rising wind, and told 
tales under our breatlj of the bloody deeds 
of Shelburne Rice the buc^aam’ and of 
his grandscai, Sherburne Rice the Second. 

And while we whispered of past terrors 
and bloody deeds, the young pet^le danced 
in the big front parlor, bobbed for apples, 
looked in mirrors, and had their fortunes 
tc^. But their attempts at gaiety were 
futile. The b%ht of tlte stranger's pres- 
ence was on them too. 

It was midnight when the strainer came 
into the dim temjdight of the room wliere 
we were wmting. The box I had seen in 
the haunted room iq>stairs was in his 


THE DEVIL’S EMISSARY 


37 


hands. It seemed to me that a little chilly 
wind, not bom of the shrieking norther 
outside, came in with him. And the far 
away howling of the dog had now become 
an anguished, maddened whine of fright. 

The music in the front room ceased. 
The young people crowded in witii us 
and sank down upon stools and cushions 
around the fire. Morna Lane’s eager, 
piquant face stood out startlingly iu the 
soft light. I could not keep my old eyes 
away from her, she seemed so excited, 
so avid for the news that was coming. 
And suddenly I knew that I hated her. 
And the stranger stood in the wide door- 
way between the parlors and looked at us 
with his unfathomable eyes. 

^t'YT’OU all knew Philip Rice,” he stated 
quietly in his grave, deep, organ- 
toned voice. “He was kin to you?” 

Some few of us murmured in assent. 
Philip had been kin to all of us, except 
to Moraa Lane. 

“He went back to the village in the 
jungle,” the sonorous voiced rolled on. 
“He must have known that death awaited 
him there, yet he was driven by a force 
he could not resist.” 

He paused, and the silence was abso- 
lute except for the soft crackle of the 
fire, and tlie wind, and the howling dog. 

“He went back. Even then he might 
have escaped his doom if he had been 
careful, for he had friends among the 
Mayas. They are a remnant of a once 
highly civilized and mighty race, as yet 
uncontaminated by intermarriage with 
other breeds. Their great stone city is 
an amazing place. You would marvel at it 
if I could make you see it. Where did 
the stones in its walls come from? They 
are huge and expertly cut. But what force 
brought them from their distant quarry, 
what force lifted them to their destined 
places in the towering walls? No man 
knows. Unthinkable wisdom, those long 


dead Mayas must have had, unthinkable 
riches. Their ancient treasure house would 
make the richest treasury in your world 
look like a beggar’s pittance. Gold and 
strangely wrought ornaments and glow- 
ii^ gems. Why did Philip Rice persuade 
the Mayan girl who loved him to take him 
there ? That place was holy. He knew it. 
What untumable force could have sent 
him there?” 

His black eyes moved from face to 
face, and I saw men and women sway 
backward as his eyes moved over them 
even as a field of grain sways when a 
wind blows over it. 

“He took something exceedingly pre- 
cious from that treasure house,” the 
stranger said, very quietly. And his eyes 
came to rest on the opalescent box be- 
tween his hands. 

I saw Moma Lane lean forward, just a 
trifle, as if to see it better. But her face 
was inscrutable. I could make nothing 
of it. Could she have cared for Philip 
and still betray no sign, now that he must 
be dead ? 

“The Mayan girl loved him with a self- 
less, undemanding love. She helped him 
do the thing that he desired to do. She 
showed him a secret pass through the 
hills. Because she loved him. Savage 
women are like that sometimes .... 
women to whom love is everything, even 
though the loved one lias no thought for 
them — as Philip certainly had none for 
her. His thought was all for the white 
girl who had sent him back. He was 
mad to get for her the bauble she de- 
manded. And it was only through the 
native girl that he could get it — so he took 
it and started home — alone. And he 
might have escaped, for the Mayas made 
no attempt to pursue him. They but sent 
a messenger after him with the severed 
hand of the girl who had helped him. 
‘Come back and burn,’ their message said, 
‘or we burn the woman instead,’ He did 


38 


TERROR TALES 


not hesitate. He went back. And they 
gave his body to their gods.” 

■pATRICIA screamed. I think the rest 
did too. I couldn’t. My breath stuck 
in my throat. I was beyond the relief 
of any outcry. I was stuni^. 

The stranger watched us with his re- 
lentless eyes, tlwase eyes that were black 
with the blackness that is total absence of 
light. He lifted the priceless box that 
was neither large nor »nall, the box that 
seemed to be made of a single fire-tinted 
opal, in his perfect hands. 

‘'This I bring back from the jungle/' he 
cried, a pulse throbbir^ in his voice as 
the sacrificial drums must have throbbed 
in tile jungle while Philip died. “It is 
meant for some one Itere. To whom does 
it belong?” 

It was beautiful, that box. It glowed 
Ml tmbeJievable glory in the ligtit of the 
leaping fire. No rainbow in the world 
could ever have shown such colors, colors 
that wrkhed and burned Mid faded and 
burned ^ain. ‘ 

But we drew t«ck frwn it in horror. It 
was accursed For all its beauty it was 
stained with another oolor that did not 
show. The color of Philip's blood. 

“It belongs to one of you,” the stranger 
said, inexorably. 

I saw Morna Lane lean forward sud- 
denly. She gasped, as a swimmer might 
gasp on tlie brink of an icy plunge. Her 
hand reached out, drew back, reached out 
again. She tried to speak, and could not. 
The stranger gave her a long, still look 
from his fathomless eyes. 

“It is yours then?” he asked, and his 
voice was husky and filled with deep vi- 
bratioiw like die music that comes from 
the strings of a bass viol. 

Still she could not speak. But she nod- 
ded, jerkily, and swallowed hard; and her 
outstretched fingers clenrfied and un- 


clenched and clenched again in a spasm 
of desire. 

He laid that lovely, priceless thing with- 
in their grasp. He turned, slowly, and 
walked away, his head bent, like a man 
who was very tired, into the front parlor 
and across it into the hall. I watdied him 
climb the stair slowly and sadly and yet 
with an air of duty done. When he had 
passed from sight, my eyes came bad« to 
that room of silence. Only one of the 
group liad moved. Morna Lane was gone. 
The rest sat still, white-faced, silent- 
stricken. . . . 

TN the morning I went with weary plod- 
ding feet to call our stranger guest to 
br^kfast. It was late in the morning 
then, but only a few of the kin had come 
downstairs, and they looked as if th^^ 
had not slept. The wind still bowled. The 
hound was silent. Oid Jude Imd whis- 
pered to me with tangled, stammering 
tongue that during the niglit die dog had 
died of terror. 

My old hand shorfc as I knocked on 
the door of Sherburne Ri^’s room. There 
was no answer, and, shaking as in a chill, 
I pushed the door open. There was no 
one in that haunted room. There was no 
sign that any one had ever been in it. 
Nothing seemed to have been touched. 
Even the bed was undisturbed. Even as 
be had refused to eat at our table, so, it 
seemed, he had refused to sleep beneatli 
our roof. 

Slowly, painfully, I stumbled down the 
stair. Never had I felt so old and helpless 
and dismayed. Patricia took my arm in 
the lower hall, and for the first time in 
my life I was glad of a woman's help. 
Swnehow she got me to the telephone. 
After what seemed hours of fumblii^ I 
got Bob Shane, the taxi driver, on the 
wire. When had he taken the stranger 
back to town? 


THE DEVIL’S EMISSARY

“But I never brought nobody out to 
Palo Alto,” he bawled in exasperation. 
“Nobody at all. Old Jude must’ve gone 
plum’ loco. I brought out a small package 
that come by express, an’ I left it with 
that old dumb nigger at the door. What’s 
the matter with the old hellion — any- 
how?” 

I couldn’t answer him. The receiver 
dropped from ray nerveless hand. I was 
sick, but there was something I had to 
do. 

“That box — ” I gasped to Patricia. 
“Quick! We’ve got to find out what was 
in that box — ” 

“Morna isn’t down yet,” Patricia ob- 
jected. “Most of the young folks aren’t. 
Up late last night, you know — ” 

“It makes no difference,” I mumbled. 
"We’ve got to find out, Patricia. I tell 
you, we’ve got to find out !” 

I saw her own face whiten. I don’t 
know whether her thougiit was the same 
as mine. I never did know, for we never 
talked about it afterward. But she helped 
me back upstairs and down the hall to the 
room that was Moma l^e’s. 

She didn’t answer when we knocked, 
and her door was locked. I had to send 
for some of the men to break it down. 
And then I wished I could have left it 


locked till judgment day. I can never get 
that picture from before my eyes. 

The opaline box lay on the night table 
by the bed. It was open and empty. 
Morna lay cold and quiet in her bed. 
Her white hands still gripped the wrist 
of a severed brown hand that clutched 
her throat, in a desperate, futile effort to 
wrench it away — a brown hand that had 
once been part of a Mayan maid who had 
loved and aided Philip Rice. And Moma's 
face .... That is what I would almost 
be willing to give my immortal soul to 
forget. But forget I cannot. 

And even as we stared, spellbotind with 
horror, the brown fingere relaxed their 
grip, the hand fell to the pillow and lay 
still, its work well done 

“Sherburne Rice — ” Patricia was bab- 
bling h3f6terically, over and over. “The 
vegeance of Sherburne Rice — ” 

But I was not so sure. I stood there 
thinking of the strange man who called 
himself Minos Dis, the man who ate not 
and slept not in our house — the man 
whom Bob Shane had not been able to 
see. And I remembered then that Dis is 
another name for Pluto, the god of the 
nether world, and that Minos was one of 
the judges who rendered judgments there. 
Perhaps .... But how could it be other- 
wise? The wan was Death.

in love wife Eileen ; but when he came to 
see her he would often just sit there, star-

sister. Eileen couldn't understand him, 
but for some reason she was afraid of of'- 
fending him by showing her uneasiness. 

She looked at the clock. It was just 


seven o’clock in the. evening — early for 
callers, even in Blairfteld. 

Quick footsteps sounded on the back 
porch and the kitchen door banged open. 
John O’Marra stood there for a moment, 
breathing quickly. 

“Hello, John.” The girl's hands went

to her hair, then smoothed the apron over 
her slim hips. ‘T wasn’t expecting you this 
evening.” 

“Didn’t come to see you this time, 
Eileen.” John O’Marra made a quick 
nervous jerk with his head. “Where’s 
your dad?” 

“In the living room.” A look of sudden 
alarm spread over the girl’s face. "What’s 
happened? What’s wrong?” 

“Plenty I” 

John O’Marra went through the small 
dinii^ room of the Gannon home with 
Eileen at his heels. Paddy Gannon, Eil- 
een’s father, big and barrel-chested with 
black hair that showed no sign of grey, 
was sitting beside a table lamp reading 
his paper. His wife, frail but bright-look- 
ing, was knitting at the other side of the 
table. Mr. Gannon raised his eyes, looked 
at John O’Marra’s face and let his paper 
drop to the floor. 

"Trouble, eh, Johnny?” 

“Yes, sir. A cave-in. Eddie Dwyer is 
trapped.” 

“A cave-in.” Paddy Gannon’s voice 
became a growl. "How could that hap- 
pen? I looked that tunnel over just be- 
fore sundown. There’s something very 
dirty going on, Johnny.” 

He stamped out into the hall and got his 
hat. 

Eileen went over and stood close to her 
mother. The two women watched with 
fearful eyes as Paddy Gannon opened 
the drawer of the living room table, took 
out a white brassard, and slipped it on his 
left arm. 

As they started out John O’Marra said, 
"I've got to get Father Doyle, Mr. Gan- 
non. ril see you at the shaft.” 

“Is there a doctor there?” 

“Yes, sir. One of the boys got Dr. 
Akers.” 

The noise of Paddy Gannon’s small car 
joined that of John O’Marra’s for a mo- 


ment behind the house. Then they both 
roared out of the driveway. 

llJTiS. GANNON tightened her arm 
around Eileen’s waist. "Trouble, 
Eileen, darlin', trouble. Black days are 
upon us. Working the mines in the dead 
of the night, sneaking the coal out in 
trucks that don’t turn on their engines un- 
til they reach the bottom of the hill. 
Fights with the cc«npany men. Now this 
secret society. The Silents they call them- 
selves. Secret societies breed trouble. 
This is the third accident in two weeks. 
It seems as if a curse has been put on 
the Blairfield mines — ” 

Eileen interrupted her mother. 
"Where’s Nancy?” 

Her mother blinked once or twice. 
“Nancy went out right after dinner. I 
suppose she’s over at the Crowley’s house. 

. . . Eileen, have you noticed anything 
strange about Nancy of late ? Sometimes 
the child frigjitens me.” 

Eileen’s bright blue eyes looked into 
her mother’s tired grey ones and she 
caught her lip between her teeth. "Well, 
you know how girls are when they reach 
eighteen. They’re always hard to under- 
stand at that ^e.” 

"But you’re twenty-one,” Mrs. Gannon 
said. “You didn’t behave so strangely at 
her age. Sometimes — ” the woman’s voice 
dropped to almost a whisper — "some- 
times I feel that she’s not my own daugh- 
ter at all.” 

"Hush, mother.” Eileen patted the older 
woman’s shoulder. “I’m going out for a 
little while. Do you mind?” 

“Out?” Her mother glanced toward 
the window. "But it’s starting to rain. 
Where are you going ?” 

“Up to the mine.” 

"Now, Eileen — don’t go up there. You 
know your father wouldn’t like it. They 
don’t want the women up there, especially 
when there’s trouble. There will be a 


THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN 


43 


rough crowd up there — and besides you’ll 
get drenched.” 

‘‘I’ll wear my slicker and rubbers and 
mind my own business,” Eileen said, “I’ll 
keep out of their way. If you want any- 
thing before I come back Neil is upstairs 
doing his home work, isn’t he?” 

“Yes, like a good boy. But I wish you 
wouldn’t go.” 

“I won’t be long," Eileen was pulling 
on her raincoat, adjusting a soft felt hat 
so it would deflect the rain from her face 
and neck. She opened the door on a ni^t 
that was black with a wind-driven rain. . . 

There was a group of a score or so of 
men gathered armmd the mouth of the 
^aft in the Blairfleld coal mines. Coal 
oil torches flared and sent out fitful, down- 
thfust flames hi the storm wind. The ring 
of faces around the entrance to the shaft 
was picked out in red and black lights 
and shadows. Mostly men, because the 
women had b«n forbidden to come. Eddie 
Dwjrer’s mother and sisters were there, 
for it was Eddie who was trapped in the 
tunnel. Their faces were no less grimly 
expectant than those of the other watch- 
ers. Paddy Gannon and the doctor and 
priest were in the shaft with the shift that 
was trying to dig through to Eddie 
Dwyer. No word was spoken in the wait- 
ing huddle. 

Off to one side, on « slight rise made 
by a dump pile, two figures stood alone. 
The man was straight as a pine tree, 
dressed in rags, and his long snow-white 
beard was spread out on his chest by the 
wind so that it looked like a white jacket. 
The girl was slender, and she wore neither 
hat nor coat. Her black hair airled in 
the rain, and her thin dress was so wet it 
clung to her every contour, revealing a 
figure beautifully and youthfully femi- 
nine. She had a lovely elfin face with 
large eyes that seemed to tilt up gently 
at the outer comers, and her hair was 
blown back, showing tiny ears that came 


to points at the edges. There was a strange 
expression on her face as she stood there 
beside the old man, heedle^ of the ele- 
ments, watching the group around the 
shaft. She looked like a person who is 
witnessing a pageant of rare beauty. Her 
lovely lips were half parted, like a cliild’s 
in front of a Christmas tree. The old man 
just stood beside her, still and without 
expression. Standing there together they 
looked, in the weird li^t of the torches, 
like the study of an inspired sculptor. 

■piLEEN GANNON came up the hDl, 
skirted the group at the mouth of the 
mine shaft, and climbed the little rise 
to where the girl and the old man were 
standing. She seized the girl’s arm. “Nan- 
cy. What are you doing here? Standing 
in the rain widiout hat or coat! You’d 
better come home,” 

The white-bearded man turned his head 
once to look at Eileen, then looked away 
again. Nancy Gannon turned her lovely 
young face toward her sister, “Oh, Eil- 
een! Isn’t that a beautiful picture? Those 
people huddled in the rain and torch- 
light, with their faces hard with worry 
and sharp with pain — waiting, waiting. 
It is so beautiful it fills me with de- 
light, makes me want to run and leap 
and sing . . . 

“Nancy!” Her sister’s voice was brisk. 
“Eddie Dwyer is trapped in tiiere. Daddy 
is one of the men trying to get him out. 
He and the others might get cauglit in a 
cave-in before they can reach Eddie. 
You’re talking nonsense and you’ll catch 
your death of cold. Come. Come home 
with me at once.” 

“All right, Eileen,” Naticy said slowly. 
*‘But I hate to leave such a lovely s%ht. 
. . . Good night, Seamus O’Callahan. . . . 
Lovely, like the little folk gathered around 
their fire, waiting for one of their mates 
who has been trapped in the world, and 
is late in coming.” 

Eileen twitched her sister's arm. “Keep 


44 


TERROR TALES 


still, and hurry.” They had gone a dozen 
paces or so when Eileen said, “Why do 
you talk to that old hermit, Seamus O’Cal- 
lahan? Everyone knows he’s crazy. Peo- 
ple will talk if they see you with him like 
that. You’ve been told before.” 

“Seamus O’Callahan is not crazy,” 
Nancy said. “He is a gentle and kind man 
with a sensitive soul. He sees beauty with 
eyes that others lack. He talks to me until 
I, too, can see, beauty.” 

"If I tell Dad you’ve been talking to 
Seamus O’Callahan, and calling it beau- 
tiful that Eddie Dwyer got trapped in the 
cave-in, he’ll take a strap to you, even 
if you are eighteen.” 

Nancy shivered and started to walk 
faster. Her voice had a quieter, more 
normal pitch when she spoke this time. 
“I’m wet through. Let's hurry.” 

The two sisters were lying side by side 
in bed when they heard their father’s car 
come into the yard. They heard him stamp 
up the back steps into the kitchen. Mrs. 
Gannon was up, waiting for her hus- 
band, with a pot of coffee on the stove. 
The girls could hear them talking in tlie 
kitchen right below the bedroom. 

“Did you get him out?” Mrs. Gannon 
asked. 

“Yes,” Paddy Gannon rumbled. “We 
got him out — too late. Dead, he was, when 
we got to him. Too late for priest or doc- 
tor. ... I tell you, Mary, there is some- 
thing very dirty about it all. It’s not nat- 
ural. It’s like the place was bewitched. 
Three accidents without any reason or 
cause, one after tlie other. For all the 
world as if there was a black spell put 
on the place.” 

CHAPTER TWO 

Black Clouds 

•piLEEN GANNON dropped off to 
sleep to dream of the grim tableau 
at the mine. Again she saw the huddle of 
anxious, fear-ridden figures at the mouth 


of the shaft. No word or cry had been 
uttered at the shaft, but Eileen dreamed 
that somebody cried out — sharply. The 
cry came again, cut through tlie veil of 
sleep. It seemed still to echo in the quiet 
house when Eileen sat up in bed, fully 
awake. 

Nancy moved restlessly by her side, 
but did not answer when Eileen spoke to 
her. Eileen leaned close and saw her sis- 
ter’s eyes were shut, and that she breathed 
like a person in a deep sleep. This time 
the noise was a frightened wliimper, and 
it came from the next room. Eileen 
slipped out of bed and pulled on her robe. 
As she went through the door to her 
young brother’s room she switched on 
the light. 

Neil, her ten year old brother, was sit- 
ting up in bed, his eyes round discs of 
fright. He was still whimpering. 

"What is it, Neil?” 

Eileen approadied tlie boy’s bed. He 
looked at her without answering. 

Paddy Gannon came thumping into the 
room in his bare feet, wearing an old 
fashioned flannel night shirt. “What’s 
this? Was that you screaming, son?” 

"I don’t know,” the boy said slowly. 
"I don’t know if I screamed, but I was 
asleep and it was like as if somebody 
was holding a light over me. Then some- 
body slapped my face, hard, three or 
four times. Then the light seemed to go 
out and I woke up.” 

“Bad dreams!” Mr. Gannon scoffed. 
“Too much sweet stuff on your stomach.” 

“No,” the boy protested. “Somebody 
was really slapping me. I can still feel 
my face sting.” 

Eileen leaned over the boy’s bed. “Yes, 
dad. His face is red, just as if he had 
been slapped. Red and white welts.” 

“Wrinkles in the pillow,” Mr. Gannon 
rumbled. "Go back to sleep, Neil, and 
don’t let me hear any more out of you. 


THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN 


45 


You frightened 3^ur mother out of a 
sound sleep." 

The hoy put his hand gingerly to the 
side of his face, then slowly lay back. 
“Yes, sir." 

‘C’lLEEN turned and went back to her 
room. She switched on the small bed 
lamp for a ^ond. The faint smell of 
hot wax came to her nostrils. There was 
a candle in a pewter stick on the bedside 
table — purely an ornament. But there 
was a little pool of melted wax around the 
wick. The wick, when she touched it, 
was still warm. The candle was on 
Nancy’s side, within easy reach of her 
hand. "Eileen stood there looking down 
at her sister with a strange, half-fright- 
ened expression. But Nancy’s lovely faun- 
lilffi face was wreathed in an innocent 
sleep smile. The neck of her nightdress 
was Awry, ahowmg the white throat and 
the sweU of her breast. Half child, half 
woman-— all lovely. 

Slowly, shaking her head, Eileen 
crawled back into her side of their bed. 
“Nb, no. It couldn’t have= been Nancy. 
She wouldn’t have done tliat. . . . But his 
face was streaked. And that candle was 
lighted only a short while ago. Oh, no. 
Not my sister Nancy. It's unthink- 
able . . 

The next evening Nancy was not home 
for dinner and the Gannons sat down 
without her. Prom time to tune Paddy 
Gannon looked at the clock and demanded 
sourly, “Where’s Nancy? "What’s keep- 
ing her/”' 

“I don't know," Mrs. Gannon said at 
length. “She must be over at the Crow- 
Ity’s. I can't think of where dse she 
could iie.” 

Paddy Gannon finished his second cup 
of coffee and thumped his napkin down 
on the table. “I’m going after her. What 
kind of conduct does she call that ? Not 
commg trame to meals, staying out by 
herself after dark, wandering around. It 


seems you haven’t taught your second 
daughter the things she should know, 
Mary. It’s time I took a hand." He filled 
his pipe, put on his hat and coat and 
stamped out. 

“Oh, dear,” Mrs. Gannon breathed 
fearfully. “I hope .she is at Crowley’s. I 
do hope she is," 

Eileen patted her mother’s shoulders re- 
assuringly but there was a serious cast to 
her pretty face as she carried the dishes 
into the kitchen. Mr. Gannon had not yet 
returned when Paul Savage came to see 
Eileen. He was a slim, good-looking 
young man with a rather solemn expres- 
sion. He dressed mudh better than most 
of the yoimg men of Blairfield. He was 
in the- living room talking to Mrs. Gannon 
when Neil came out to the kitchen where 
his sister Eileen was putting away the 
silver. 

“That Paul Savage Is cnit in the parlor 
waiting for you,” Neil said. 

“You don’t like him, do you, Neil?” 
Eiken smiled. 

“Aw, he’s a dude. I like John O’Marra. 
Why don’t you marry Johnny O’Marra, 
Sis? He's r^ular, and he’s a big shot 
in the Silents." 

“Sshf’ Eileen put her finger to her 
lips. “You shouldn’t talk about that. You 
know it.” 

“Huh," Neil muttered. “Everybody 
knows who the Silents are. Pop’s one of 
them. That’s why he don't like a com- 
pany man like Paul Savage coming 
around to see you. He likes Johnny 
O’Marra, too.” 

“You keep still,” Eileen warned him. 
“Or you’ll get yourself in trouble." 

She took off her apron and went into 
the living room, Paul Savage rose from 
his chair. When he smiled he looked 
much younger. 

“Would you and your .nujther like to 
go to the movies?" he asked. 

“No,” Mrs. Gannon quickly, tJaen 


46 


TERROR TALES 


added. “Thank you, Paul, but I want to 
wait for Mr. Gannon. You and Eileen 
go." 

“Come out in the kitchen, Paul,” Eileen 
said. “I want to show you something.” 

^NCE in the kitchen Eileen closed the 
door and faced the young man. “Paul, 
I’m terribly worried about Nancy. That’s 
where Dad is now, out looking for her. 
I want to wait until he gets back. She’s 
been acting awfully strange of late.” 

Paul took her hand. “Eileen, why don’t 
you stop worrying about your silly sister, 
and listen to me? I want to marry you, 
Eileen.” 

“Don’t call her silly, please,” Eileen 
begged. “I’m really worried.” 

“As long as you must talk about her,” 
Paul said, “All right. People are begin- 
ning to notice that she’s — well — different. 
She’s the prettiest girl around, not count- 
ing you, of course. Yet she scares the 
fellows away because she never wants 
to do the ordinary things. She wants 
them to go out and run in the rain with 
her instead of going to the movies. She 
doesn’t talk like anybody in Blairfield. 
She could have any young man in town 
if she stopped being like that.” 

“What are people saying about her?” 
Eileen asked. 

Paul Savage shrugged. “Oh, I don’t 
listen to gossip. It’s you I’m interested 
in.” 

“You’re sweet, Paul. But I’m worried. 
. . . Oh, here’s Dad now.” 

Gannon’s car came into the yard and 
stof^d at the side of the house. The 
front door opened and Eileen and Paul 
could hear Mr. Gannon’s voice. “Well, I 
found her !” 

Mrs. Gannon said mildly, “Where have 
you been, Nancy dear?” 

“I drove all over town looking for her,” 
Paddy Gannon growled. “And where do 


you think I found her? In the grave 
yard — ^that’s where! I was driving past 
slow, thinking and worrying, and I heard 
Nancy’s laugh. I hopped the fence and 
there she was, sitting on a tombstone in 
the dark by the side of a newly filled 
grave, talking to crazy old Seamus O’Cal- 
lahan. The two of them perched there 
on a headstone, for all the world like two 
ghouls. And crazy old Seamus telling her 
mad stories about the Little Folk and the 
banshee and the leprechauns — fairy 
stories !” 

“Well, now,” Mrs. Gannon said placat- 
ingly. “There’s a great many people 
aroimd here who still believe those things, 
and you’d not call them crazy. You said 
yourself there was a black curse on the 
Blairfield mines. If there are evil spirits, 
why can’t there be — ” 

“Hold your tongue, woman 1” 

Paddy Gannon made a threatening ges- 
ture toward his wife. Nancy stood there, 
watchii^ and listening with a sort of 
pleased smile on her lovely young face. 
Mrs. Gannon made a helpless little ges- 
ture and stopped talking. 

“Haven't I troubles enough?” Gannon 
demanded. “Trouble getting the coal out. 
Trouble with accidents that don’t look like 
accidents at ail. Trouble with the com- 
pany and the men. And then my fine 
young daughter spends hgr time in the 
evening in the graveyzu’d talking to a mad 
hermit. You’re old enough to have done 
with that childish stuff, Nancy. Look at 
you. Why, you’re — you’re a woman!” 

“Old Seamus tells such lovely stories,” 
Nancy said sweetly. 

“If I catch you talking to him again 
I’ll take the strap to you !” Gannon thun- 
dered. “I’ll take the back of my hand to 
you in the public street, grown and all as 
you are." 

“No,” Nancy said softly. “Don’t beat 
me. You would be very unlucky the rest 
of your days if you were to strike me.” 


THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN 


47 


66\l^riAT kind of talk is this?” Gaa- 
non bellowed. He took three quick 
strides to pass between the table and his 
wife’s chair to reach his daughter. His 
foot caught in the electric lamp cord, 
swept the lamp off the table to crash 
heavily on the floor. In falling it had 
missed Mrs. Gannon by bare inches. 

Gannon stood there with the wrecked 
lamp at his feet and, for a second, his face 
was purple. Then the anger seemed to go 
out of him. 

“That almost hit you, Mary,” he told 
his wife. "‘I’m sorry for my clumsiness.” 

Nancy looked from her father to her 
mother and her face was calm and sweet. 

“I’m going upstairs to bed.” 

In tile kitchen Eileen Gannon turned 
to Paul Savage. “You heard it. Sitting 
on a headstone in the graveyard, listening 
to a crazy hermit tell stories. Paul, I’m 
so worried about tier. It isn’t tliat she 
herself is crazy, I’m sure. It’s just that 
some times she isn't Nancy at all. Mother 
and Dad don't Inrow how to handle her. 
I’m afraid it’s up to me.” 

“I wish I could help,” Paul said. “But 
she’s your sister. I wouldn't be much 
ure. I’m afraid.” 

Mr. Gannon came into the kitchen, 
stopped dead when he saw Paul Savage. 

“Hahl So you’re here, are you?” 

“Good evening, Mr. Gannon.” 

“I suK*ose you company men,” Gan- 
non said deliberately, “are all pleased to 
hear that Eddie Dwyer died in a cave-in.” 

“You don’t understand, Mr. Gannon," 
Paul explained. "I only work for the 
Company, but I know how they feel. They 
know 3 «)u go in there and take out coal 
and ^ip it out quietly by trucks. They 
know you have armed guards stand there 
while the men work. They could call in 
other armed guards and cause bloodshed. 
They don't, because of the men in 
Blairfield worked in the mines for yrars 
— and will work there again when things 


open up. But you work those shafts at 
your own risk. You know that, Mr. Gan- 
non.” 

“There has been a lot of mysterious 
trouble lately,” Gannon said. “I suppose 
the company doesn’t know about that, 
either ?” 

“The company doesn’t want trouble,” 
Paul insisted. “When hot-heads like John 
O'Marra get excited they blame every- 
thing on the company.” 

“Johnny O’Marra is loyal to his own 
kind,” Gannon said sharply. 

“He’s a trouble maker,” Paul answeral 
firmly. “Things are bad enough without 
men like O’Marra keeping things stirred 
up." 

“If you’re interested to know," Gannon 
said slowly. “I look with more favor on 
Johnny O’Marra than on another who 
was raised in Blairfield, and went away 
and got a fine education, and came back 
to work for the company-— against Ids 
own kind." 

“I know you mean me,” Paul said. “I 
do work for the company. So did you, 
for years, as a mine foreman. And when 
things pick up you’ll be working for them 
again — unless there is serious trouble.” 

“That’s not sol” Gannon exploded. 
“The company never intends to work 
Blairfield again, and they hate to see us 
scrape a few dollars out of it to keep 
from starving.” 

Paul Savage shrugged. “I’d keep a 
check on Johnny O’Marra, Mr. Gannon. 
He’s getting too big for his pants. Don’t 
let him get you into an 3 rthing you’ll be 
sorry for." 

From outside came the rattle of a noisy 
car coming into the driveway. 

“I think that’s John now,” Eileen said. 
“Please don’t start any unpleasaiitness.” 

John O’Marra came in tlie back door, 
said good evening to Mr. Gannon and 
Eileen, and nodded curtly to Paul Savage. 
He stood there awkwardly for a moment.

TERROR TALES 


Then his heavy black brows drew down 
and he said, “Mr. Gannon, could I speak 
to you alone ? What I have to say is ncrf: 
for the ears of company spies.” 

“Come with me,” Gannon invited. They 
left the kitchen and went into the living 
room. 

“Johnny was just one of the boys, 
working in the mine, when things were 
good,” Paul said meditatively. “Now, 
with all this trouble, he’s getting to be a 
person of consequence. The men defer 
to him and your father alike. If your 
father doesn’t watch out he’ll be taking or- 
ders from Johnny O’Marra, yet.” 

“Trouble!” Eileen put her hands to her 
temples. "The air is heavy witli it. It’s 
like watching a black cloud come rolling 
over the horizon.” She shivered. 

CHAPTER THREE 

Who Walks at Night? 

T^ANCY was sound asleep when Eileen 
^ ’ retired. The older sister stood look- 
ing at the younger girl for several mo- 
ments before putting out the light. Nan- 
cy’s face was so sweet and childishly free 
from lines. The black hair clustered 
around her temples, and the lashes curled, 
smudge-black, against the warm whiteness 
of her cheek. Eileen bent and kissed her 
sister’s forehead, very gently. In sleep, 
Nancy’s lips curved. 

Eileen stretched out beside her sister 
but sleep was reluctant to come. She 
shifted position constantly, but did it 
gently so as not to disturb Nancy. Even- 
tually she dozed off, a fitful, tense sort 
of half-oblivion instead of a sound re- 
laxed slumber. 

Suddenly she snapped out of her half- 
conscious state and sat bolt upright in 
bed. She reached over and tried to touch 
Nancy. The other half of the bed was 
empty I 

Smothering a frightened exclamation 


Eileen switched on the'bed light. Her sis- 
ter Nancy was gone ! 

Eileen sat there, hands to her temples, 
trying to think coherently. The house was 
silent as a tomb. If she started to look 
for Nancy it would wake her father and 
mother. Then, if Nancy had left the 
house, there would be a terrific scene. 
Paddy Gannon would go looking for his 
daughter, and when he found her he’d 
give her a horrible beating. Not since they 
were children had their father struck 
either of them. But Eileen knew if her 
father discovered Nancy had left the 
house, a black rage would get the best 
of him. 

Eileen covered her own face with her 
hands. "No, no. I won't wake them. I’ll 
— I’ll just wait, and pray. She’ll come 
back. She must come back. . . 

A N HOUR that dragged like a prison 
sentence — then the clatter of a car, 
a thximping on the front door. Eileen 
bounded from bed, snatched her robe and 
ran down the stairs, her heart pounding. 

“Something has happened. Something 
has happened to Nancy.” 

Her fingers groped for the light switch 
and then fumbled with the front door 
latch. She had to cling to the door jamb 
to keep from surrendering to her trem- 
bling knees and folding up on the floor. 

John O’Marra pushed in, his dark face 
pale and his eyes bright with a strange 
frightened look. “Where’s your dad?” 

“In bed,” Eileen stammered. “Is some- 
thing wrong? Did something happen 
to — ?” 

“Get him up.” 

John O’Marra’s facial muscles jerked 
as he said each word. 

“What goes on down there?” Paddy 
Gannon bellowed from the stair head. 

“It’s John O’Marra.” 

“Come down, for God’s sake,” John 
shouted. “The shaft is haunted! I saw

it with my own eyes. Joe Dixon and I 
were on the second level, waiting for the 
bucket, when all of a sudden Joe says 
in a scared voice, ‘Look!’ I looked and 
saw something white gliding toward us 
from the tunnel. Joe let a yell out of 
him and stepped back — -and fell down the 
shaft. He’s killed. I fired a shot right 
at the ghost but it just disappeared.” 

“You must be drunk — or crazy !” 

“No. I saw it. Joe saw it too — and 
that’s what made him fall. While we were 
getting Joe’s body out another one of the 
boys saw it. A white thing tliat seemed 
to float*along in the dark tunnel. None of 
the boys will go back in the shaft.” 

“I’ll get dressed and be right with you,” 
Paddy Gannon said. 

Eileen stood downstairs in the hall, 
clutching her robe around her. “What 
did it look like — this thing you saw? 
Could it have been a woman, or a girl?” 

“No. It was nothing human, I tell you. 
I fired right at it.” 

“You shot it?” Eileen’s voice was un- 
steady. “And it disappeared — where?” 

“Just disappeared,” John repeated. “In- 
to the blackness of the shaft.” 

Mr. Gannon came clumping down the 
stairs, his shoes not yet laced. He grabbed 
his hat and coat. “Haunted !” His voice 
was scornful. “You’d think you were 
bach hi the dark ages in Ireland.” 

After they had gone Eileen crept back 
upstairs to bed. She was trembling so she 
had to grasp the banister with both 
hands as she made the ascent. Once in 
her room she threw herself face down on 
the bed. 

Once more, the house was very still.- 
The pounding of her own heart boomed 
in her ears. Nancy gone. ... A white 
figure in the mine — a. ghost. . . . Joe Dixon 
hurtling to his death . . . John O’Marra 
shooting point blank at the white 
figure. . . . Nancy gone. The words and 
thoughts flooded her mind in a confused 


and terrible jumble. She was afraid as 
she had never before known fear. Not 
fear of a known thing — something tan- 
gible you see and understand and fight 
off — but a heart-chilling terror of some 
unknown menace. . . . 

VV/ HEN she awoke the sun was stream- 
ing in her window and the little clock 
on the bedside table said six. She turned 
quickly. Nancy was lying there beside 
her, breathing regularly, sleeping like a 
child. Maybe it was all a horrible dreamt 

Then she saw a red smear on the bed 
sheet that covered Nancy’s shouders. She 
drew back the covers. Nancy’s white 
nightgown was torn at tire right shoulder, 
and under the tear a crimson groove 
marred the flawless skin. Not deep, but 
raw and angry looking. It might have 
been made by the branch of a tree run 
into in the dark. It might have been 
made by the lash of a whip— or the sting 
of a speeding bullet as it grazed its mark, 
Eileen went quietly into the bathroom 
and got the iodine bottle. 

Nancy’s eyes opened as the strong an- 
tiseptic seared the red flesh of the wound. 
She looked up at her sister and smiled 
sweetly. 

“It doesn’t hurt much,” 

“Nancy!” Eileen leaned over her. 
“Where have you been darling? What 
happened to your shoulder?” 

“I have been asleep, right here beside 
you,” Nancy murmured drowsily. “And 
I had lovely dreams. Red lights in the 
dark underground, and yellow lights and 
men’s faces reflected. And one face so 
frightened the man’s soul was stamped on 
it, like the brand of a white-hot iron. It 
was lovely. . . Then she closed her eyes 
again and slept. 

Eileen threw back the covers. Nancy’s 
bare feet were bruised, and soiled with a 
thick black dirt. Like coal dust. . . . 

Gently, Eileen covered her sister and

tip'toed from the rcwMn. She had to get 
out into the air, out and walk in the ai^n- 
shine. She couldn’t talk to her mother or 
father or little bn^er about diis ev»- 
increasing fear tliat was seeping into 
her bones. She left die house and walked 
quickly, takii^ breaths, As she 

reached Blairfiel(fs main street she saw 
little groups of people standing about, 
talking excitedly. Only one or two of 
the stor^ had opened as yet, but there 
were more people on the sidewalks than 
was usual at notm. They nodded a good 
morning to Eileen as she passed, then 
turned to r«ume their fevered discus- 
sion. 

In front of the drug store there was a 
larger group. Eileen stopped and edged 
into the fringe around an old woman 
who was talking in a hi^ thin cackle, and 
holding her listeners spell-bound. The first 
sentence Eileen heard made her heart 
^and still. 

"Bewitched I Yes! You don’t believe 
it, heh ? But you must believe now. I re- 
member, sixty years «^o, when Leadville 
was bewitched. Strar^e things happened 
and men dropped dead at their work. The 
whole town soon frit the curse. Men 
were afraid to work and they couldn’t get 
any money. When they found the witeh 
they burned her. Then they could work 
again. Blairfield is bewitched. No man 
will set foot in that haunted shaft. Blarr- 
field is doomed!" 

“Doomed?' A bystander echoed the 
word stupidly. 

“Yes, ckiomed— 'to waste and die. 
Doomed, unless you find the witch." 

Eileen caught her lip between her teeth 
to stifle a cry, and walked quickly away. 
As she walked the words kept echoing in 
her mind. “Find the witch. . . . Find the 
witch I” 

The people of Blairfield were simple, 
close to the soil. Many of them were only 
one generation removed from the peas- 


ants of an old eoimtry whose lor© was 
woven around strange tales of Little Folk 
and fairies and leprechauns, handed down 
from the time of the Druids-^nd so 
strongly a part of their consciousness that 
centuries of Christianity could not eradi- 
cate it. None among them would deny in 
his own heart that certain families had a 
banshee, an evil spirit that wailed out- 
side the house three nighls running whei 
a member of that family was marked for 
death. They prayed to God, Imt over their 
shoulders their eyes were peeled and their 
ears attuned to another groups of spirits 
that recognized neither God nor man. , , . 

CHAPTER FOUR 

Dancers la the Forest 

tT^HE family was seated at the dinner 
table that night waiting for the head 
of the house to come home. Eileen’s eyes 
kept straying across the taide to study the 
face of her sister Nancy. Mrs. Gannon 
looked tired and nervous, and little ten 
year old Neil was chattering aboirt the 
topic that was the paramount subject of 
conversation in every home in Blairfield. 

“Haunted!" little Neil piped, his eyes 
round. “The mine’s haunted and nobody 
dasn’t go near it. The ghost will strike 
tlrem down dead." 

“Neil!" Eileen’s voice was not quite 
steady. “Don't go around repeating such 
nonsei'ise. Cackling old women txy to ex- 
plain everything by blaming it cm the 
spirits. You wait until Dad comes home 
and ask him." 

"But they do say that, all over town,” 
Mrs. Gantion offered. “It’s not just the 
old women. It’s the men, too. The young 
men. Johnny O’Marra was one who saw 
the apparition and he’s not a kd to be 
easily frightened.” 

“Boyl" Neil exploded. “Johnny 
O’Marra yanks out his gun and — hang! 
The old ghost—’’ 


THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN 


51 


“Neil, stop, please,” Eileen cut him 
short. Her eyes probed Nancy’s face for 
the barest sign of a reaction. She even 
engaged Nancy’s glance, switched to look 
at Nancy’s right shoulder, then back mean- 
ingfully to her sister’s face. But the play 
of glances seemed to mean nothing to 
Nancy. She just sat tlaere, her small face 
in repose, her large eyes, that slanted up 
a bit at the outer edges, dark blue pools 
of innocence. 

Paddy Gannon came into the house 
with a bang of the door and a noisy clump 
of his big boots. He marched through the 
diningroom to wash at the kitchen sink. 
Through the splash of the water his voice 
carried through to the family in the next 
room. 

"Mary, you get ready and get Neil 
ready to take the eight o’clock train for 
Reading in the morning. You’re going to 
stay with your sister for a few days.” 

“What’s that, Paddy?” Mary Gannon 
asked in a startled voice. 

“Aw, gee. Dad,” Neil protested. “I 
wanna stay here and see what happens 
about the ghost — ” 

“Oh, you do !” Mr. Gannon stamped in 
and took his place at the head of the table. 
“You’re going to Reading with your 
mother, young one. And I’ll hear no more 
of your lip.” He turned to his wife, ‘^ou 
get ready. This is no place for kids or 
women with weak hearts. Do you know 
what the whole town’s talking about ? 
Tliey’re saying the mine is haunted. It’s 
the spirits who are to blame for the trou- 
ble. I’ll show them who’s to blame ! They 
won’t go near the shaft — ^and you know 
what that means. Starvation that will 
come so quick we won’t have the strength 
to pull ourselves out of the way to die. 
Haunted it may be, by all the evil spirits 
in hell, but we’ll work it just the same. 
And there will be bad days. ... So you 
and Neil go stay with your sister.” 

"Why can’t we all go?” Mrs. Gannon 


asked plaintively. “There’s nothing here 
now but a bare living, made by sneaking 
out coal in the dead of night. Trouble, 
all the time. Secret societies and wearing 
white bands on your arms so you won’t 
shoot down your neighbor. It’s not ever 
coming back, Paddy. Blairfield is — ” 

“Cackling like the old wives in the vil- 
lage, eh ?” Gannon barked. “Do as I say. 
Eileen and Nancy can look after me and 
the house, and I’ll look after the mine, 
haunted or not. , , . Serve the food, 
Mary,” 

^T'HERE was a tension, a harsh dis- 
cordant note that seemed to vibrate in 
the air, imlike the usual harmonious home 
life of the Gannon’s. Mrs. Gannon looked 
scared, and her hands trembled visibly. 
Even little Neil appeared to sense the 
change — the sinister feeling of foreboding 
that hung in the room like a fog. His 
strident young voice was dropped to a 
hushed whisper. 

As Eileen studied the guikless smile on 
her younger sister’s face a cold chill raced 
down her spine, and the small hair 
prickled on the back of her neck. It was 
Nancy, not the talk of the haunted mine, 
who had by some strange means deliber- 
ately charged the air with an ominous 
portent — and she was enjoying the result. 
Her smile said so. 

“Nancy !” Eileen called sharply, “Don’t 
look like that. Stop it 1” 

Nancy looked at her sister and smiled 
even more sweetly. 

Eileen clenched her hands until the fin- 
gers were numb, and shut her mouth 
tight. She mustn’t let this wild spirit of 
discord that suddenly permeated the house 
draw her into its whirlpool. Why did 
Nancy delight in making people afraid? 
Eileen excused herself and went into the 
kitchen. It seemed that Nancy’s smile had 
a slightly derisive quality as she watched 
her sister leave the room.

TERROR TALES 


That evenhig Paul Savage came to call. 
Mrs. Gannon was upstairs with Neil, get- 
ting ready for their visit to Reading. Mr. 
Ganncwi had gone out, wearing the white 
brassard of tlie Silents on his arm. Nancy 
was sitting on the front steps, watching 
a full moon come up to paint the coun- 
tryside with quid<»tlver. 

Paul and Eileen sat side by side in the 
living room. Paul covered the girl's hand 
with his. 

“Eileen, wlqr do you keep putting me 
off? Is it b«:ause of O'Marra?" 

“My mind is filled with other things, 
Paul. Terrible, disturbing things. Some 
baleful influence seems to have settled 
over all of ns.” 

“I know," Paul said. 'T’ve heard the 
talk that’s going on around town. That 
the mine is haunted, and all that rot. But 
it’s dangerous talk, more powerful than 
any sensible propaganda. We know there 
aren't any ghosts in that shaft, but as long 
as people think so you’ll get no sense out 
of them. Anything is apt to result from 
a wild story like that. I even went down 
the shaft myself, looking for tlw ghost.” 

“But nobody can prove it isn’t haunt- 
ed,” Eileen said. “I know I shouldn’t be- 
lieve those fantastic stories, but there are 
a numbo’ of things I don’t want to be- 
lieve. IVe been fighting them off, reject- 
ing them- as impossible, but they persist — 
and I’m terribly worried. I can’t even tell 
you, Paul, what tliey are.” 

“It would be better if you did,” Paul 
coaxed gently. 

Eileen shook her head and ttiey sat for 
a moment or two in silence, holding hands. 
The girl started suddenly, and a dliill tre- 
mor ran through her frame. Prom some- 
where outside came a weird half human 
cry, a wail that lingered like the echo of 
a soul in torment. Eileen’s fingers locked 
around Paul’s hand. 

“What — what was that?” 


“Some dog baying at the full moon,” 
Paul smiled. 

“No.” Eileen turned a tense face 
toward Paul. “No. I heard it last night, 
too. Just Hl« that. Paul, I’ve got to tell 
somebody — ” She jumped to her feet. 
“Where's Nancy?” 

“She was outside, sitting on the front 
steps admiring the full moon,” Paul said. 
“I guess she's still there.” 

Eileen ran for the front door and flung 
it open. The moon drenched the oountiy- 
side with a wan mysterious light. The 
front steps were carpeted in its glow but 
they were empty. Nancy was not out 
there. Eileen stood by the door and called 
several times. Paul came out and stood 
by her side. Suddenly she turned to him. 

“Paul, we must find her I” She seized 
his lapels with both hands. “We must 
find Nancy.” 

“But where did she go?” Paul asked. 
“Where will we look?" 

Eileen started down the steps, digging 
Paul after her by the hand. ^'Come, quick- 
ly. We’ve got to find her. , . . Paul, where 
does old Seamus O’Calahan live? You 
know, the strange hermit ?” 

‘TJp in the woods, beyond the ridge 
some place.” Paul said. “But you don't 
tliink Nancy would be there, do you ?” 

“Oh, I don't know — but let’s try. If 
you only knew what I’m afraid of. . . .” 

tT^HEY stumbled through the woods, 
climbing the slope to the ridge where 
old Seamus O’Calahan was believed to 
live in a cave. The bright moon made 
their path easy to find, but Eileen’s haste 
made her feet unsteady. At the end of 
twenty minutes she paused to get her 
breadi and leaned weakly against Paul 
Savage. 

“It’s Nancy, Paul, dear. I can't even 
tlxink of you until I find out what’s wrong 
with her.” 

Paul patted her shoulder understand- 
ingly. “I’ll help all I can, darling.” 


THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN 


53 


A little farther on they came to a clear- 
ing, the grass silvered like the surface of 
a lake by the moonlight. Paul seized 
Eileen’s hand, held her fast. 

“Look !” 

Eileen stood there by Paul’s side in the 
sliadow of the rim of trees, and blinked 
her eyes unbelievingly at what slie saw 
in the clearing. Old Seamus O'Calahan 
was standing straight as a graven image 
in the center of the clearing, the moon 
making his long white beard a cascade of 
silver. Two figures danced around him 
in a wide circle, one following the mo- 
tions and gyrations of the other. Both 
figures were snow white. One was a beau- 
tiful young girl, nude as a nymph of tiae 
forest. The other was a great white goat. 
The goat was dancing on its hind legs, 
pawing with its front l^s as a dancer 
keeps the rhythm with his hands and 
arms. 

“Nancy!” Eileen’s voice was a choked 
whisper. 

“Yes,” Paul said slowly. “Nancy.” 

Eileen started forward but he held her 
back. “Wait,” he said. "That’s marvelous, 
barbaric — ^beautiful 1” 

Eileen tried to break away from him. 
“Paul, are you crazy, too? That’s my sis- 
ter Nancy dancing out there naked in the 
moonlight — dancing with a goat in front 
of a crazy old man. Paul, I’ve got to 
stop her.” 

“Wait.” Paul held her, his eyes gripped 
by the strange sight. Graceful as birds 
on the wing, smooth and supple as fish 
gliding in water, the goat and the girl 
danced in a smaller circle each time, clos- 
ing in around the still, erect figure of the 
old man with the silver hair and beard. 

As they watched a strange music 
seemed to come from nowhere, a lovely 
pulsing rhythm that was part of the dance 
and the moonlight, barely audible, Faint 
but clearly defined. 

“Paul!” Eileen begged. “Let me stop 


her. Don’t let her do that mad pagan 
dance there — without any clothes — in the 
moonlight.” 

Reluctantly Paul walked by Eileen’s 
side as they left the fringe of trees and 
started across the clearing. Old Seamus 
O’Calahan unfolded his arms and clapped 
his hands once. The faint music stopped. 
The great white goat dropped to all fours 
and trotted off int# the woods. Nancy 
stood there, unashamed in her natural 
state, and watched them approach. 

Eileen stood before her sister, probing 
her face. Nancy smiled. "It was beauti- 
ful,” she said. “Wasn’t it beautiful?” 

"Where are your clothes?” Eileen de- 
manded. 

“Qothes? Oh, yes.” Nancy walked, 
straight and poised as a yoimg goddess, 
to the edge of the wood where her clothes 
lay in a heap. 

Paul Savage, his eyes still filled with the 
wonder and beauty of it, touched old 
Seamus O’Calahzm on the arm. “The mu- 
sic— where was it coming from ?” 

The old white-bearded man spread his 
arms. “It is always there, all around us. 
It only grows louder when we need it.” 

Eileen, holding her sister by the hand, 
was calling, “Paul, hurry. Let's go home, 
please.” 

Paul joined the two sisters and they 
started off through the woods in the di- 
rection of home. Eileen was sobbing au- 
dibly. Nancy was walking proudly, grace- 
fully. Once, at a tight comer of the path, 
Nancy turned her head and looked up at 
Paid. She smiled sweetly, the moonlight 
showing every contour of her lovely 
young face. It was like a child’s, no more 
self-consdous than when he had seen her 
doing the naked pagan dance a short time 
l>ack. Paul looked back over his shoulder. 
The clearing was still there, like a pool 
in the moonlight. But the old man with 
the silver hair and beard was gone. Gone, 
too, was the great white dancing goat.

TBRROR TALES 


But a dark figure appeared at the far 
edge of the clearhig. A man was cutting 
across the edge of the clearing toward 
the deme woods. The moon was so bright 
Patd had no difficulty r«:ognizing John 
O’Marra’s burly figure with its charac- 
teristic truculent stride. 

“Now ^>vdiere did that bird come from ?“ 
Paul asked himself. "Was he hiding at 
the far side of ffie clearing all ffie time 
Nancy was dancing ? He must have been. 
Why should he hide, and sneak away 
after ? I think it’s about time I told Eileen 
a few things I know about that lad." 

“Hurry, Paul, please," Eileen called 
from down the path. “I’m frightened." 

■pAUL turned and hurried to catch up 
with the two sisters. They were al- 
most home when a noise on the path be- 
hind them made Paul turn to look. Com- 
ing toward them, plainly visible in the 
light of the moon, was an old woman. 
She moved quickly despite her hunched 
shoxdders and bent frame. A grey shawl 
with bng fringe covered her head and 
the upper half of her body. As she ap- 
proached made a cackling noise and 
strudc the ground before her with her 
cane. 

As the path was narrow and the old 
woman evidently in a hurry Paul stood 
aside to let her pass. The old woman 
passed him without a glance and stamped 
up even with Nancy and Eileen. 

“Ha I” Her shrill tackle awoke echoes 
in the wood. "The changeHugf" Her 
bony finger was extended toward Nancy, 
almost toucliing the girl’s face with its 
hooked nail. 

Nancy stopped walking and looked 
at the crone with a half-pitying expres- 
sion. Eileen pushed the! old woman away. 
“Go away, you crazy old idiot. Don't ever 
call my sister that name!" 

. “She is. She Is!" The old woman beat 
the ground with her stick. “I was there 


at her birth. Your mother knows she is 
a cfangeling. I have smi her with Old 
Seamus O’Calaban, laughing at tragedy, 
sitting on headstones in the graveyard- I 
saw her tonight when she danced with 
the goat in front of that old he-witch, 
Seamus O’Calahan. She’s no cliild born 
of woman. And faring bad luck and 
sudden death to them as lives with her 
and are dose to her." 

P^l Savage took some money from his 
pocket and pressed it into the old woman’s 
hand., “You didn’t see a thing. Take this 
and get good and drunk and have your- 
self some more hallucinations." 

She closed her bony talons over the 
money, held it close to her face to look, 
then shuffled off, bobbing her head. Paul 
turned to the two girls. “Let’s wait a lit- 
tle while and let her get a start Half 
crazy, lialf drunk. You mustn’t feel hurt 
at what she said, Nancy." 

“I was just thinking," Nancy said soft- 
ly. “How odd and tlirilling it would be to 
find out one was a diangeling. Not the 
cliild of mortal woman, but an ageless 
spirit that comes back to the earth every 
century or so." 

“Stop it Nancy!" Eileen’s voice was 
hoarse. “Don't talk like that. You’re be- 
ing silly. You're the natural daughter of 
your mother and mine. You’re my very 
own sister and I won’t have any crazy old 
hag calling you things like that." 

From far up the path, as if she had 
heard, came the old crone's voice, crying 
out in a brittle caclde, “Changeling — 
Changdingt” 

CHAPTER nVE 

Cdl of the Bandiee 

^HE residents of Blairfield were 
frightened. Something had happened 
to call a curse down upon them ; that was 
unanimously agreed. THie mine tlmt pirt 
food in their mouths and clothes on their

backs was haunted — ^bewitched. The curse 
was reaching out to envelop them all. 
Soon the pinch of want would be added 
to the vague apprehension of the curse of 
the mine. No more trucks rolled at night. 

Paddy Gannon talked himself hoarse at 
a meeting of the Silents but not one man 
among them would join him to enter the 
shaft. Not even Johnny O’Marra. For 
Johnny had seen the specter with his own 
eyes. The women folk backed their men. 
“Don’t go near that shaft, ’Tis cursed, 
and be sure of that !” 

And an old crone, leaning on a crooked 
stick and holding her fringed shawl 
around her bent shoulders with taloned 
bands, shuffled up and down the street, 
stopped at stores and houses. Everywhere 
she cackled the same awesome story. 

There was a changeling in their midst ! 

A thing in human form, not a child of 
woman, but a creature of the spirit world, 
walked among them daily. Posing as 
Paddy Gannon’s own daughter, it was. 
But no natural daughter at all, at all. A 
changeling ! 

Paddy Gannon heard the gossip and 
took his pretty daughter by the hand. He 
brought Nancy around to Father Doyle’s 
house and held his broad thumb on the 
priest’s bell imtil an aged housekeeper 
opened the door. 

“Is His Reverence in?” Gannon de- 
manded. “I’d like to see him, if he is.” 

“Yes.” The old housekeeper was hesi- 
tant. “I don't know — ” 

“He’ll see me, I’m sure.” 

Gannon pushed in, still holding Nancy 
by the hand. He walked into the hall and 
a gentle voice called from the front room. 

“In here, Paddy Gannon.” The shades 
were drawn and the room was in dark- 
ness. Gannon halted on the threshold. 

“Are you in the dark, Father?” 

“I’m afraid I am, Paddy Gannon,” 
Father Doyle said gently. “A few hours 
ago I lost the sight of my eyes. Dr. 


Akers was here and will be back. There 
seems to be no reason for it. But I am 
blind. Enough of that, then. Can I do 
something for you ?” 

“Blind?” Paddy Gannon’s booming 
voice dropped to a whisper. “God pre- 
serve your eyes, Father. But I’ve brought 
my daughter, Nancy. There’s a cruel ru- 
mor going around. The people are say- 
ing my daughter here is a changeling. 
What can we do to stop this terrible 
talk?” 

“Come here, my child,” Father Doyle 
said. “Can you see me in the dark? Give 
me your hand. There. You aren’t going 
to let this cruel talk make you bitter or 
envious — are you ? Because we know 
there is no such thing. There is only one 
Spirit, and that a benevolent KDne, Only 
man is cruel and wicked.” 

“Oh, I don’t mind. Father," Nancy said 
sweetly. “I think it would be thrilling to 
be a spirit, not bound by the shackles of 
this earth.” 

"All youth feels tlmt way, my child,” 
the priest said. “Now go outside, please. 
I want a word with your father.” 

After a moment the priest asked, “Has 
she left the room, Paddy Gannon?” 

“Yes, Father.” 

“She moves so lightly one might well 
believe her to be a spirit,” Father Doyle 
said with a smile in his voice. “Send her 
away, Paddy Gannon, to a good convent 
some place in the country where live and 
growing things aboimd. The good Sisters 
will know what to do to shape that nim- 
ble mind without breaking her spirit. But 
send her away, because these good people 
of Blairfield can be very cruel.” 

^T^HE word went aroimd that Paddy 
Gannon had taken his daughter Nancy 
to see the priest, to have Father Doyle 
drive out the devil that possessed her. But 
before he got there Father Doyle had 
gone blind !

TERROR TALES 


The Devil had closed the eyes of God 1 

Even on the street now, people talked 
in awed whispers. Nancy Gannon walked 
down the main street and people stopped, 
as if turned to stone, at her approach. 
Mothers pulled their little children out of 
the way as if the devil htmsdf was abroad. 
Even the d<^s seemed to sense the fearful 
isolation, and slunk out of her way. In 
the old days, they told each other, she 
would have been driven out of town as a 
witch. Maybe even burned ! 

AU of it had no effect on Nancy. She 
walked as if in a world of her own, and 
her very manner of goit^ whipped tlie 
people mto a frenzy of hate. She was no 
real daughter of Paddy and Mary Gan- 
non. She was a child of the devil — and 
the curse that held Blairfield in its grasp 
was her doing. Nancy went her way, 
smiling sweetly, a faraway look on her 
lovely elfin face. 

Eileen Gannon was tearful and more 
than a little frightened as -she talked to 
Paul Savage. “What can I do, Paul ? The 
whole town is calling Nancy a spawn of 
some evil spirit" 

“Vicious, stupid peasants!" Paul 
growled. 

“But, Paul," Eileen stammered. “She 
does such ttrat^e things you can hardly 
Uame them. She sneaks out at night and 
meets Seamus O’Calahan. She was there 
when the cave-in killed Eddie Dwyer. 
The night the ghost was seen in the shaft 
and Joe Dixon fell to his death, she was 
gone all night — and in the morniag her 
feet were bruised and black and she had 
a strange wound in her shoulder. Maybe 
this crazy old man has something to do 
with these awful events. Maybp he is in- 
fluencing Nancy to do things that are 
connected in some way with these trage- 
dies." 

“Seamus O’Calahan is a bit cradeed," 
Paul told her. “But he’s not the one to 
bring the tremble that holds this commu- 


nity in its grip right now. I’ve a theory 
of my own. And don't worry about 
Nancy. She’s a rare and lovely creature. 
Sucli grace and beauty — -to be bom and 
reared in Blairfield — ’’ 

“Stop it!" Eileen screamed. “Ever since 
you saw her dancing, naked in the moon- 
light, you’ve done nothing but stare at 
her and follow her with your eyes. Isn't 
it bad enough that my own sister is be- 
witched, but you have to fall under her 
spell 

“Eileen, you’re hysterical. I’ll show 
you — ’’ 

“Please go!” Eileen begged. “I can’t 
stand any more. Don’t come back, ever. 
You — you too, are coming under the spell. 
I can see it, feel it. Go, for keeps and 
forever. First she ^bewitched John 
O’Marra — now it’s you!" 

“You need a little rest,’’ Paul said. “I’ll 
see you tomorrow." 

“No I" Eileen slammed the door beloind 
him and leaned we^ng against the wall. 
“Never come back. There won't be any 
tomorrow.” 

Paddy Gannon was talking to a group 
of grim-faced naen at a meeting of the 
SUents. He was using strong words in a 
strong voice. Were they going to sit down 
and wait for starvation? Were they go- 
ing to let their wives and kids starve 
with good coal ready for the pick, be- 
cause some old crones had said there was 
a curse on the mine? 

“I’m going in there tonight!" he shout- 
ed. “And I’m going to get coal. And if 
there’s a man amot^g you with the guts 
of a louse, hell go with me — and the rest 
of you can stay home and tell your beads 
and starve like rats 1” 

When he climbed the hill a little later 
fifteen men were Ijehind him. Others were 
getting the trucks ; still others carried 
rifles and side-arms to stand guard while 
the shift worked. . . . 


THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN 


57 


l^ILEEN GANNON stood in her room 
with her back to the door and watched 
her sister Nancy get r^dy for bed. When 
the younger girl had retired Eileen turned 
the key in the door and began to undress. 

“You’re going to sleep beside me, aren't 
you, Eiken ?** Nancy asked. 

“Yes, of course.” Eileen tried to keep 
her voice steady. “Why not ?” 

^‘Because everyone else is afraid of me. 
Everyone in the world. Mother took Neil 
away and father won’t stay in the house. 
The people in town draw away from me 
— ^but you aren’t the least bit frightened, 
are you?” 

“Of com-se not.” Eileen was trembling. 
She got into bed and reached out to ex- 
tinguish the bed light, but halted her hand. 

“It is strange, to see fear on people’s 
faces,” Nancy said. “It gives one an ex- 
ultant thriH. . . . What would make you 
twist your face in fear, Eileen?” The 
younger sister moved close and looked 
into Eileen’s eyes. 

Eileen steded herself against showing 
any emotion. She tried to smile at her 
sister. Suddenly there came the weird, 
half-human cry she had heard on tlie two 
previous nights. It seemed to oome from 
the >'ard, outside the house. Its gliastly 
timbre swmed to run up and down her 
spine like needles as it climbed the regis- 
ter to a wail of torment. 

She sat bolt upright in bed. “What’s 
that?" 

Nancy laughed gleefully, “Your eyes 
showed fear, stark uncontrollable fear. 
Your naked terrified soul was in your 
eyes, the way a person looks when death 
stares them in the face. It is marvelous, 
thrilling." She edged close to Eileen. 
“Soon I shall see that look in your eyes 
again. I know it — soon.” 

“But tliat ^oise,” Eileen muttered. 
“That dreadful sound!” 

“That’s Ihe banshee,” Nancy shrilled. 
*\Three nights it has wailed. . , . And 


that means death!” She bounded oat of 
bed and stood on her bare toes as if 
poised for flight. Her head was thrown 
hack, her eyes alight with rapture. “The 
bMishee!” 

Eileen covered her face with her hands, 
then by sheer force of will pulled them 
away and looked at the weird tableau of 
her sister standing with outstretched arms, 
head thrown back. For a split second it 
looked to Eileen as if a huge white bat, 
wings spread, stood there instead of 
Nancy. Resolutely she got out of bed and 
approached Nancy. 

“Go back to bed, Nancy. You're hys- 
terical,” But sfie couldn’t keep her voice 
levd and the nerves in her body tingled 
so that she walked jerkily. 

Nancy lowered her Iiead and stared -at 
her sister, then, as Eileen drew close 
Nancy’s arms came out toward her, went 
around Eileen’s shoulders. Tense and 
shaken, Eileen went a little limp. As she 
sagged she felt Nancy’s fingers slide up 
and close around her throat. 

Through a haze she heard Nancy’s 
voice. “I have heard the banshee call. 
I must go. . . 

When Eileen recovered from her faint 
Nancy was gone. 

CHAPTER SIX 

Death ia a Nymph 

pAUL SAVAGE responded at once to 
EileMi’s frantic teIq>hone call. As he 
drew up to the front of the house in his 
small car Eileen was standing on the 
porch. She ran down the steps and seized 
Paul’s arm in her two hands. “Nancy has 
gone again. We must find her!” 

“Do you know where she went?” 

“No. But let’s try the mine. Paul, she 
acted like a mad persott. We must find 
her and bring her back.” 

“All right.” Paul started the car. “But 
it’s dangerous to be sneaking around the 


58 


TERROR TALES 


mine at this hour of the night. The men 
are working up there and they’ll shoot on 
sight.” 

'T know it,” Eileen said in hushed 
tones. “She only had her nightgown on. 
If she goes up there they might think it 
has something to do with the ghost that 
is supposed to be haunting it. They might 
kill her in the darkness before they see 
who it is. Hurry, please. You know how 
excited they all are.” 

“Right.” Paul Savage guided his car 
out of the village and up the hill to the 
dark shaft of the Blairfield mine. He 
took a short cut over a bumpy road as 
they neared the top of the rise. As they 
bounced around a curve his headlights 
picked out something that flashed white 
in the darkness. He stood on his brakes. 
“What was that?” 

“It was Nancy,” Eileen gasped. “I’m 
sure it was. Over there by that wooden 
shack.” 

Paul Savage took a flashlight from the 
pocket of the car and got out. “Come 
on,” he told Eileen. “That shack is an 
air vent to number one tunnel. We’ll soon 
see if that was Nancy.” 

The two left the car and ran across 
the field to the little wooden shack. It 
was unlocked and Paul directed the beam 
of his flashlight inside as he swung the 
door open. The grating that covered the 
hole inside was leaning against the wood- 
en side of the little shanty. 

“Don’t tell me,” Paul said slowly. “She 
couldn’t have gone down that vent !” 

“She must have!” Eileen insisted. “I 
saw her come in here.” 

Paid knelt and played his light down 
the vent, a hole about four feet in diam- 
eter, roughly shored with heavy planking. 
“There are footholds in this thing,” he 
said. “But I still can’t imagine — ” 

“She went down there!” Eileen insist- 
ed. “She’s gone down there where the 
men are working. They’ll see her white 


nightgown in the dark and shoot her. 
Paul, we’ve got to go down and find her.” 

“I’m another one they don’t want 
around here,” Paul said ruefully. “They’d 
think I was spying for the company and 
give me the business — but here goes. I’ll 
go down first and give you a light.” 

He switched tlie light off and let him- 
self down the vent, feeling with hands 
and feet for the iron footholds that had 
been driven into the shoring. The vent 
sloped off around hard rock and was nar- 
rower at that point. Then it widened 
again. Eventually his feet struck hard 
surface. He flashed his light again and 
saw that he was n^r the end of a tunnel. 
Above him he could hear Eileen’s prog- 
ress down the vent shaft. He played the 
light for her and the two of them stood 
in the tunnel, black as the coal it sired, 
except for Paul’s flashlight. 

“She must have gone this way,” Paul 
said. “Come on,” 

^HERE was a narrow gauge track 
along the floor of the tunnel and the 
footing was imcertain so Paul kept the 
light on the ground before them. They 
approached a bay and Paul stopped sud- 
denly. "Did you hear flut noise?” 

“Yes. What was h?” Eileen’s voice 
was a hushed whisper. 

"The men are working number three 
vein, the next below on this shaft,” Paul 
told her. "It’s about one hundred and 
fifty feet down. The vein below that is 
flooded because the pump hasn’t been kept 
going. They must have stopped working, 
because the lift bucket isn’t moving.” 

“But that noise,” Eileen repeated. “It 
seemed to come from right ahead in the 
tunnel.” 

“I know,” Paul said. “And nobody is 
working up on this level. Maybe it’s 
Nancy. Come on.” He led her out to 
the bay and around the shaft. There was 
no indication that a score of men were 


THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN 


59 


working right below them. The vein ran 
off at a tangent on the other side of the 
bay. Eileen stuck close to Paul and walked 
with one hand extended, touching his 
back. 

“It smells very unpleasantly/' she said. 
“Almost gagging.” 

“They are working without the exhaust 
blowers to dean out the foul air,” Paul 
told her. “Clean air comes down the shaft 
but even at best it’s hard to exhaust the 
had air. These men are taking chances — 
but it’s diat or starve, that’s why my sym- 
pathies — ” He stopped talking and his 
frame stiffened. Standing bdiind him 
with her hand touching his back, Eileen 
knew from his abrupt tenseness that they 
had suddenly come upon something in 
that dark underground tunnel. He stood 
there with the light directed straight in 
front of him. Eileen moved so she could 
see around him. He tried to stop her by 
an upfiung arm, but she had already seen. 

Propped tip against the wall of the vein 
in a half sitting posture was big Paddy 
Gannon, Eileen’s father. He was still as 
the black-hewn wall behind him and his 
eyes were wide open and staring — star- 
ing up at them. Paul held the light on 
the man, sitting there so limp and stiD, 
like a collapsed figure in a wax museum. 

“Dad 1” Eileen was on her knees before 
him. “What’s happened? What'^s wrong?” 

“Hold the light.” Paul gave the girl 
the flashlight and moved her gently to one 
side. He knelt beside the slumped form 
of big Paddy Gannon, and felt for a 
pulse. Then he placed liis ear against 
Gannon’s chest and listened for a heart- 
beat. But he knew from the touch of him 
that P^idy Gannon was dead. His flesh 
was already cold clay, although rigor 
mortis had not yet set in. He put bis 
hand behind Gannw's shoulders in an ef- 
fort to straighten the grotesque figure. 
His hand felt something wet and sticky. 
As he pulled it away and looked at it in 


the flashlight’s beam he saw it was cov- 
ered with blood. Eileen saw it too. She 
let out a pitiful litde cry and dropped the 
light. 

Paul turned quickly and reached for her 
in the dark to catch her as she fell. She 
went limp in his arms. Gently, he low- 
ered her to the ground and began to fum- 
ble around for the flashlight, but it dudcd 
his groping fingers. 

Paul straightened up and his fingers 
were unsteady as he probed his pockets 
for matches. There was no warning 
sound, but suddenly a light seemed to 
flash at the back of his head. The dark- 
ness spun before liim in a dizzy cone. He 
could feel hhnsdf falling, losing con- 
sciousness. It was as If the roof of the 
vein had fallen in on him. As he slipped 
into oblivion his last thought was, “So 
this is what a cave-in is like. . . /’ 

t'lLEEN regained her senses slowly. 

Size was coughing and gagging and 
the darkness was around her like a tiiick 
black blanket. She began to stru^le to 
her feet as she remembered the events 
just before she had fainted. She was in 
the coal vein with Paul, looking for 
Nancy — and they had found her father, 
dead. And there had been blood on Paul’s 
hand as he pulled it away from her fa- 
ther’s body. She snapped alert. Utter and 
complete silence esaept for the regular 
drip of water somewhere. 

“Paul!” She callal quietly at first. 
Then, as the only response was the 
choked-off echo of her own frightened 
voice, she called again, louder. Still no 
response and she screamed his name again 
and again, only to have it beat back at 
her like the mocking taunt of a hundred 
fiends hidden in the blackness. Her head 
turned, first one way, then another, try- 
ing to make out some object. In one di- 
rection she thought she caught the flicker 
of a light. 


60 


TERROR TALES 


She stumbled over the rough floor of 
the tunnel toward the gleam of l^ht. The 
narrow-gauge track tore one shoe off but 
she stumbled on, unheeding. The tunnel 
made a turn and her hands fumbled along 
the rocky wall, following it. Then she 
came upon the light. And she stood, 
frozen with horror, her senses refusing 
to accept the scene. 

Standing in the middle of the tunnel 
was her sister Nancy, still clad only in 
her white nightgown. Nancy was holding 
a coal oil torch in her left hand, holding 
it aloft so its yellowish flame licked at the 
roof of the vein. And in her right hand 
Nancy gripped a long knife — and its 
bright blade was smeared red with blood 1 

“Nancy !” 

Nancy came toward her sister slowly, 
holding the torch out before her. In its 
dancing light Eileen could see Nancy’s 
face plainly. It had a strange expression, 
one of almost childish delight. And her 
voice, when she spoke, was like the 
pleased gurgle of a little girl. 

“Ah, you are afraid. I can see it now. 
Your face is all knotted and your eyes — 
they stare so. They stare like my father’s 
eyes stared when he knew he was dying. 
All life is dull until the moment of death. 
Then comes the thrill — the only real thrill 
in the world. The thrill of meeting 
death !” 

Eileen tried to speak but her tongue 
was numb. She tried to pray, but her 
mind was in the throes of a terrible agony 
that blotted out all reason. “Nancy is 
mad!” Voices shrieking inside her said. 
“She is not your sister. She is a fiend in- 
carnate. She killed your father with that 
awful gleaming, red-smeared knife. She 
can kill because she has no soul. She is a 
fiend — and now she is going to kill you. 
She is going to plunge that knife, still 
smeared with your father’s blood, into 
you. . . . Just so she can see your eyes 
when you die!” 


Her knees gave way and she knelt help- 
lessly before the slim young girl who 
smiled like a child but held a murderous 
knife upraised. 

“Don’t pray, Eileen,” Nancy said soft- 
ly. “It will do no good. I do not like 
prayers. They are the meanings of weak 
mortals. Maybe, when you die, you will 
become a spirit, as I am a spirit. You 
will be happier.” 

Nanc)^s face took on the reddish glow 
of the torch and the crimson smear on the 
bright knife seemed reflected in her eyes. 
She moved closer. Eileen tried to shut 
her eyes but a strange fascination held 
them wide and staring. Before their ter- 
rified stare Nancy’s figure appeared to 
float toward her like a wraith — a mur- 
derous specter, red-stained with human 
gore. 

CHAPTER SEVEN 

Hell Underground 

pAUL SAVAGE struggled back to con- 
sciousness with the strange feeling 
that somebody was calling his name, far 
off. His head vibrated with pain and 
when he touched the back of it with his 
fingers he felt a large swelling, cut across 
the top. He remembered thinking he had 
been struck by a cave-in, but he was not 
hemmed in by rock or soil. He felt about 
him in the pitch blackness, then called 
Eileen’s name. There was no answer. His 
head spun and breathing was difficult. 
Standing erect Paul braced himself and 
took a deep breath. 

Smoke 1 

The unmistakable pungent smell of 
smoke permeated the foul air of the vein 
tunnel. In the blackness it was even more 
terrifying. It rolled about him until he 
thought he could see it in the dark; he 
could taste its oily yellow stench and feel 
his aching eyes smart with it. 

Eileen was somewhere in that tunnel. 


THE GIRL WHO LOVED PAIN 


61 


She had been lying there in a faint when 
the blow he believed to be a cave-in had 
felled him. Scrambling, liolding small 
paper matches in his fingers, he found 
the fiashliglrt. 

Eileen was gone. Tlie crumpled form of 
Paddy Gannon was there, eyes still wide 
and staring, but the girl was gone. The 
flashlight showed drifting, slow coiling 
clouds of smoke. Somewhere in the iil- 
fated shaft there was a fire. 

Calling the girl’s name Paul hurried 
toward the far end of the vein tumiel. 
Ahead was a curve and beyond it voices. 
He rounded the curve and came upon a 
scene like a picture of an ancient human 
sacrifice. 

Eileen knelt, head bowed on the floor 
of tlie tunnel. Before her, holding the 
torch and die uplifted knife, was Nancy. 
The expression on Nancy's face was sheer 
rapture. She was staring at Eileen’s face 
with a gleeful concentration. She did not 
look up at Paul’s arrival. He started to 
shout, tlien checked himself. Nancy in 
this mood was dangerous. The knife in 
her hand was red with blood. 

“Put down the knife, Nancy," he said 
quietly. *‘We must go. The shaft is on 
fire. It is burning and we must go.” 

Nan(^ took a backward step. “Fire! 
Beautiful red flames, lighting the fright- 
ened faces of men — -inen trapped by fire !" 

“Fire is more beautiful than the knife," 
Paul stalled, inching close. “Give me the 
knife, Nancy. We will go and watch the 
fire.” The yellow smoke was getting 
dense in the close tunnel, seeping in, clos- 
ing around them like fog. Nancy started 
to hand Paul the knife. A voice behind 
him snarled: 

“Give it to him point first! Plunge it 
in his throat, Nancy. Watch his eyes as 
he dies!” Paul whirled to see John 
O’Marra, standing in the tunnel right be- 
hind hinC a flashlight in his left liand and 
a club in his right. By the light of Nancy's 


torch Paul could see the murderous light 
in John’s dark eyes. Paul swung his arm 
quicldy and threw his own flashl^ht. 
John O’Marra was too close to duck, but 
hie right hand swung the dub just as the 
flashlight struck him between the eyes. 
Paul dived and lodced both hands around 
John O'Marfa 's right wrist 

T^ILEEN was trying weakly to get to 
her feet The smoke was Winding 
and gagging her. The torch Nancy held 
was losing its glare in a pall of creeping 
smoke. Paul hunched his shoulders and 
held O’Marra with botli arms while Jolin 
hammered his face and head witfi his free 
hand. Paul’s head came down and he 
dosed his jaws on O’Marra's right wrist. 
He bit down until he felt O’Marra’g flesh 
give, felt the bone in his teeth, John 
O’Marra gave a scream of agony and 
tried to free his arm. He let go of the 
club and thrashed around like a wounded 
tiger. Paul could taste warm blood in his 
mouth. Suddenly he unclenched his jaws 
and smashed with both hands at the face 
writhing before him in the smoke. As 
John O’Marra went down, Paul drove his 
heel in his face, kicked him savagely, 
ruthlessly until the man went limp on the 
ground. 

“Eileen !" 

"Yes." The girf's answer was a choked 
sob. 

“The fire is in the shaft. We must go 
through it to reach the vent we came in 
by. Give me your hand." 

Nancy suddenly came to life at the 
word fire. She darted past them, holding 
the torch aloft. She disappeared down 
the tunnel and around the curve. Paul 
tied his handkerchief around Eileen’s 
nose and mouth and began to lead her 
back along the tunnel. 

Near the bay where the main shaft 
went down, the smoke was thickest. The 
fire was dovm below, where the men were 


62 


TERROR TALES 


working, but the lift bucket seemed out 
of order. Its cable was silent. Only black- 
ness and the oily smoke showed in the 
beam of Paul’s light. A down draft at 
the main shaft forced the smoke out in 
smothering billows and drove it along the 
vein. Paul held his breath, gripped 
Eileen’s hand and pulled her after him. 

Paul’s eyes were almost blinded and 
his lungs were bursting when the open- 
ing of the vent showed in his flashlight’s 
beam. He pushed Eileen up the crude 
ascent. She was so weak he had to sup- 
port her weight on his shoulders at each 
step. The air became clearer. He could 
breathe. Climbing, fighting for breath, 
they made the surface, toppled out of 
the little wooden shack and fell forward 
on the ground, side by side. 

CHAPTER EIGHT 

“Burn the Witchl” 

T IKE a flash of lightning word hit 
Blairfield. Lights went on in houses as 
the awful news was shouted from one to 
the other. “Trouble at the mine!” 

The curse had struck again at the little 
band of men who had defied it to scratch 
a little coal from the bowels of the earth. 
On foot and in tinny old cars, the frantic 
parade wound up the hill to the mine. 
Torches flared and the crowd gathered. 
They could not go too close, for foul 
black smoke rolled in great billows from 
the mouth of the shaft. 

Fire! 

Some of the men who had been working 
on the shift gasped out the story. With- 
out warning the first stench of smoke had 
smitten them. Without the usual precau- 
tions, it was every man for himself, with 
no facilities for fighting the fire or even 
determining the source. The men on the 
second level were suffocated before they 
could claw their way to freedom. Some 
got up in the bucket, but the vengeful 


yellow and black smoke drove back all 
who tried to reach the others. Ten men, 
trapped in that veritable hell, while their 
friends and families wailed and prayed 
and screamed outside the mouth of the 
shaft. 

Somebody raised an agonized cry, 
“Look!” 

Nancy Gannon and old Seamus O’Cal- 
ahan stood on the rise to one side of the 
shaft. Their forms and faces were plainly 
visible in the dancing torchlight. The old 
man’s face was devoid of expression but 
the girl’s was registering sheer ecstasy. 

“The changeling!” 

“Her standing there, bubbling with joy, 
while her own father is in that pit of 
hell I” 

“He’s not her own father. She’s no 
child of the world. She’s the devil’s spawn 
and the cause of our grief !” 

“She's a witch!” 

The grief-maddened mob poured its 
emotion toward this fresh target. The 
men and women began to call insults and 
threats. Nancy turned toward them and 
smiled. 

Somebody called. “If we’d driven her 
out of town we’d have been spared this 
curse.” 

“Drive her out now !” 

“Burn her. Burn the witch !” 

Old Seamus O’Calahan stood between 
the girl and the onrushing mob, his arms 
outspread. “No. Don’t harm the child. 
She’s done no wrong !” 

The old man was trampled underfoot 
and great red stains showed on his silver 
beard in the jumping light of the torches 
as they swept him down to the ground. 
The girl backed away, slowly at first, then 
she turned and began to run, throwir^ 
over her shoulder a look like a young doe 
in the forest being harried by a pack of 
dogs. 

The part of the crowd that held back 
at first leaped in, their emotions whipped 


THE Gffil WHO LOVED PAIN 


63 


fey the ■chase. They spread out, their 
torches ttraking crazy jumpiag flaxes ai 
they raa. They c^ed blood-ctjrdltng 
threats and goaded themselves by shriel^ 
ing words of abuse. The blood lust of 
the bust was upon them. The pent-up 
fear and anger of days was finding its 
vent. They closed in behind the rtmning 
fir], snarling like mad dogs . • * . 

pAUL SAVAGE and Eileen Gannon 
lay about two hundred yards from 
the mouth of the main shaft. For some 
minutes their labored and tortured breath- 
ing was the only sound either uttered. 
Then Paid ssid, “You all right, Eileen?” 

“Yes,” she answered. “I’m feeling a 
little sick and my eyes burn. Paul, I can^ 
understand it all.” 

"I’ve been working on all this trouble 
at the mine,” Paul told her in gasping 
breaths. "Old Seamus O'Calahan had 
nothing to do with H, any more than 
Nancy did. I can explain it all to you if 
want to listen." 

“Yes, yes. But not now. Wliat are 
they doing around the mouth of the shaft? 
Why are they all running like that?” 

“It must be the fire,” Paul said. “There 
must be men trapped down there,” 

Nancy was running with mouth open 
now, her eyes staring wildly. The mob 
snarling at her heels shrieked insane -ex- 
ultation as her gait faltered. Her fleet 
young legs were trembling, near exhaus- 
tion. Ahead was a small clump of woods. 
She ran, stumHing toward it. The pur- 
soing mob fatmed and scrambled after 
her. She was trai^jod. The litrie knoll 
ended in an ^rupt precipice with a sheer 
drop of more than a hundred feet. She 
would have to stop at its edge. Then they 
would get trer. 

The torches moved down more slowly 
as the pursuers closed in. They advanced 
oa the little fiogers of laud raised above 
the surpoanding terrain, the trap the 


huxu^d doe was too frightened to see. 
They moved in relentlessly, right to the 
edge of the cliff. A rabbit, a small, pure 
white rabbit, look«l at them with wide 
bewildered eyes. But there was no sign 
of the girl. It was as if she had disap- 
peared from the face of the earth .... 

Eileen and Paul Savage searched the 
faces of the crowd, looking for Nancy. 
People paid no attention to them. No 
explanation of the chase was given. They 
did not ask. They just kept locdciag, half 
fearfully through the crowd. Then some- 
body told Eileen that her father was one 
of those who had been trapped in the 
mine, probably smothered. At the mention 
of her father’s name the horrible scene in 
the mine tunnel rushed back to flood tlie 
girl's senses. She slipped to the ground 
in a dead faint. When slie opened her 
eyes Paul had carried her back a little 
way from the crowd around the smoking 
shaft. 

"I've been woridng on this thing for 
weeks,” he told her. "It won't make you 
feel any better, now that your father is 
gone, but the curse that had all these peo- 
ple frantic was a deliberate frame-up. 
Johnny O’Marra had made a deal with a 
mob who wanted to take take over this 
mine and bootleg coal. But they knew 
they'd never take it from the Blairfield 
crowd by force. He framed this stuff, 
those accidents. He used poor, strange 
Nancy, even started this fire. But the fire 
got out of band. I don't think he meant 
it to. I guess he'll never come out now.” 

was afraid it was really bewitched," 
Eileen said. “And I v'as afraid that 
Nancy and old Seamus O’Calahan had 
something to do with it.” 

*He had nothing to do with it,” Paul 
told her, "And O’Marra just used 
Nancy.” 

“Paul, do you think she killed Dad?” 
Eileen whispered. 

“No. I’m sure O’Marra did it. Your 


64 


TERROR TALES 


father must have discovered John was re- 
sponsible for the dirty work. Nancy must 
have come upon them just as he killed 
your father. O’Marra knew Nancy was 
strange, so he gave her the knife to 
frighten us away.” 

“But she looked so horrible,” Eileen in- 
sisted. “She was going to kill me.” 

“I don’t think so,” Paul said. “She 
just wanted to see fear in your eyes. Let’s 
go home. Nancy is probably there by now, 
calm as anyone.” 

T>UT Nancy was not home when they 
^ got there. She was never seen again. 
The last anyone had seen of her was when 
she had fled, frightened before the mob, 
into that little patch of woods. 

Three days later Eileen was getting 
ready to leave Blairfield for good. She 
was coming out of a store in the village 
when an old woman stopped her. The 
same old crone who had called Nancy a 
changeling. The hag bobbed her head and 
cackled. “Did you hear about Mrs. Dow- 
ney ?” 

Eileen shrank back, then asked civilly, 
“What about Mrs. Downey?” 

“A little white rabbit came out of the 
woods and hopped right into her kitchen 
It must have been good luck, because Mrs. 


Downey, childless these sixteen years, just 
had a baby girl. And she not knowing or 
expecting one. I was there when it was 
bom. A pretty little girl with big blue 
eyes that slant up at the outside corners.” 

“That’s — very nice, I’m sure.” Eileen 
hurried on to where Paul was waiting in 
his car. 

“What's the matter?” Paul asked. "You 
look as if you’d just seen a ghost.” 

“I’m afraid if I stay here I will,” she 
said. “Paul, drive as fast as you can, 
and as far as you can. There are some 
things I’ll never be able to understand, 
and I don’t think I want to — and never, 
never talk to me about anything that hap- 
pened here, just as long as I live.” 

"Still brooding about Nancy?” 

She gave him a long, searching look. 
“No. I’ve stopped brooding about Nancy. 
It’s hard to explain — ^but Nancy is off 
my conscience now. I don’t feel that Pm 
responsible for her any more.” 

Paul breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank 
goodness that’s cleared up.” 

Eileen shook her head. “No. It isn’t, 
and it never will be. But there are some 
things I don’t want to understand — and 
that’s one of them.” 

Paul nodded. “Amen.”

HER SUITOR FROM HELL

(Author of ” Attic of Terror," etc.) 



Sequestered in their swamp-land home, Ralph Payne and his beautiful 
young wife desired strong, comely children. But that was before their 
splendid bodies began to turn into 
horrid travesties of human form 
which could never produce such off- 
spring . . . 


S ometimes at night, when a high 
moon glints on the surface of that 
dark pool where first I encountered 
the shrinking death, doubt and terror 
cleave my brain with their dagger-strokes, 
and I despair of ever regaining my normal

physique and health. Sometimes in my 
sleep I seem to feel again the hideous 
torpidity of mind, the loathsome human 
fluidity of bone and muscle, that rendered 
me an inert jellyfish shrunken to the 
proportions of a child. But science yet 
may save me. . . . 

We were celebrating my thirtieth birth- 
day, here at the old Louisiana plantation 
where our family, the Paynes, have lived 
for a century past. On every hand the 
grounds are guarded by a barrier of for- 
bidding swamps through which a hard 
road leads to various plots of high land 
now cultivated by adsite tenants, oece 
tilled by my grandfatliw’s bkek slaves. 
During the year since Grace and I were 
married the old manor house had been 
modernzed in varions ways, and foremost 
among improvements was a gleaming, 
white-tiled outdoor swimming pool de- 
signed to take the curse off torrid summer 
days. 

When the scorching sus had drojqjed 
behind a surrounding wail of nmss-draped 
ej'press trees, Grace proposed a coding 
dip. Akhoi^ our guest. Doctor Hemerich 
Koop» made some small objection, socm we 
coaxed him into a bathing suit and led him 
to the brink of the inviting basin. Grace 
ran to the end of the spring-board, her 
deli«tely molded form poised as lightly 
as a mocking bird’s upon a swaying bough. 
Arcing through the air m a clean dive 
that setrt drops sparkling upward^ she rose 
to the surface laughing and called : 

"Come in I It’s delightful I” 

Then, her face sobered as she floated 
there regarding the two of us with 
thoughtfrri eyes. 

T SENSED the comparison she was 

msdfing vid knew the reason. Doctor 
Koc^, whom I bad en^doyed, ostetsibly 
to manage a small |»ivate hospital tq>on 
tfte jrfantation for the benefit of tenant 
families, but actually to safeguard the 


health of my bride, was one of her school- 
day lovers- whose doglike devotion had en- 
dured through adolescent years. As one 
of an adoring dozen she had given liis 
aspirations no serious thought until, with 
college behind Iiim and a profitable pro- 
fession ahead, he proposed marriage and 
she told him it could not be. 

With disarming candor she had con- 
fessed that wanted a husband whose 
physique would match her own bodily 
health and strei^tii; because she desir-ed 
numerous cWldren and there must be no 
heredity taints that might prevent tise 
growth of tall sons and love^ daughters. 

Koop's years numbered the same as 
mine, but I stood six feet two in my 
stoddngs and tipped the scales at two 
hundred weight. He was a scrawny man 
of five feet four and a childhood injury 
had left his back sK^tiy huitthed. Be- 
neath his bulging brow dwelt a brain 
whose keenness mine probably never 
would attain, although I did weQ enough 
at managing tlie estate. 

Hemerich Koop also guessed the tenor 
of ■ lier thoughts. Srailir^, he said 
heartily : 

“What a gorgeems pair of animals you 
are! In with you, Ralph, and have your 
fun. I’ll sit and watch.” 

With die sense of something akki to 
pity r plunged, sympathizing with the 
hopelessness of his pli^it, yet selfishly 
glad in the knowledge that liis foodoeas 
for Gr^se would result in especially watch- 
ful care. That meant a great deal to a 
young couple expecting to raise a family 
in tlie depths of a swamp forty miles 
from tlie nearest dty. 

It meMit more than that to me, five 
minutes latw, when a monstrous face was 
thrust out of a dump of shrubbery a few 
yards away and the idiot, Pedro, begaa 
smarling obscene Spanish oaths which 
frightened Grace into a fit of trembling 
hysteria.

Following a final g^st of vile curses 
Pedro hurled some curiously shaped ob- 
ject which splashed into the pool near 
where Grace dung to me. Then he scut- 
tled into the swamp before I could call 
a servant to catch him. 

I held my wife in my arms, sitting upon 
a bench beneath the pergola, while Koop 
ran to the house for his small black bag. 
Returning, he gave her a sedative. Be- 
tween us we strove to calm her fears, in- 
sisting that the half-wit’s outburst was 
meaningless, but still terrified she cried: 

“He has grown more boldl It has a 
dreadful meaning! That old crone, Zell 
Mendez, is slowly goading him to the 
point of murder. They mean to kill you, 
Ralph, because of the accident that 
crippled him.” 

I laughed the idea aside, but even Hem- 
erich Koop’s dark-browed face betrayed 
deep concern. Uneasily, he said : 

“All the tenants talk of the threats Zell 
Mendez makes against you. They fear 
her curses. Superstitiously, they believe 
that she is in league with the devil. Some- 
times, I wonder. Sorcerers have per- 
formed strange deeds which science can- 
not fathom.” 

“For God’s sake, Koop!” I exclaimed. 
“You don’t mean that you believe in such 
twaddle ?” 

He smiled, grimly. “Not as witchcraft. 
If that’s what you’re thinking. But we 
live in a swamp, Ralph, and I must con- 
fess that some of the secrets of swamp 
herbs and poisons handed down from one 
generation of voodoo practitioners to 
another have not yet been solved by the 
medical profession. Did you read, last 
spring, of the man in Bay St. Louis whose 
stature is slowly shrinking? Who has 
been dwarfed to the size of a child from 
a height of six feet ? Not only is he said 
to be suffering from a curse, but similar 
cases have been recorded in Barbados and 


in Porto Rico. It makes one wonder — ” 

Angrily, I seized the bottle of brandy 
he had brought from the house and gulped 
a steadying drink. Grace said, tearfully: 

“Why should she blame you, that old 
old witch, for an accident that was un- 
avoidable ? Three people swore that Pedro 
Mendez darted out of the brush, squarely 
in front of your car — ” 

“Forget it, dear,” I said, inwardly shud- 
dering at the recollection of a stunning 
impact, the sickening crunch of flesh un- 
der heavy wheels, the screams of the 
stricken idiot when my speeding roadster 
felled him. “Doctor Koop did everything 
pyossible for the poor fellow. And neither 
Pedro’s curses, nor his mother’s, will 
mend his crooked legs nor harm us.” 

Hemerich Koop was looking toward the 
glassy surface of the pool. 

“What did he throw at you when he 
was swearing there? 1 saw something 
queer splash — ” 

“I’ll see.” Standing on the brink I 
scrutinized the white bottom, saw a small 
blue bottle lying in the deep end exuding 
an inky cloud. “There it is. I’ll fetch it 
up.” 

I dived. The immersion cooled my ex- 
cited blood instantly. But, even as I en- 
joyed the pleasant sensation, blighting 
f«ir struck home. Cooled met I felt 
chilled to the bone! My limbs seemed 
frozen. Neither arms nor legs would func- 
tion. In a state of complete paralysis I 
glided to the bottom. The air in my lungs 
slowly raised me to the top but I hung 
face downward, helpless. By no force of 
will could I command the movement of 
a single muscle. 

When my tortured lungs rebelled and 
I could no longer forestall the gasp which 
filled them with water in a drowning flood, 
I heard Grace’s shrill cry of alarm echo 
as from a great distance. Then a Uack 
coma enfolded me.

^T'HE time which foibwed was marked 
hy vagufr peria^ of light and dark- 
ness. OccasiotKdfy, I realised that I lay 
in a hospital bed, tiiat a doctcH' and a nurse 
came and wet^ that I had sot drowned 
but was alive. 

and nights passed like a blur cd 
delirium, studded with moments of ex- 
cruciating agony, broken by terrifying 
dreaiaM ta which tiie idiot’s face ^>peared 
tft leer at me as I suffered there, while he 
gibbered of escape from pain through u3e 
of some drug contained in a small 

beetle ef hellish midn^ht blue. At last, 
after an eternity o£ nameless terror, there 
came a |:^se ef clear consciousness, yet 
so weak had my strange illness left me 
that I could not raise my heavy eyelids 
and, perforce, without a sign of life lay 
listening to the voices of Doctor Koop and 
Grace. 

“He is wasting away to death!” My 
vrife’s anguished tone was sharp with 
grief. “It is Zell Mendez’s curse I RaljA 
is doomed. You cannot save him.’* 
“Now, now, my dear,” the doctor 
chided. “Don’t give up hope so easily. 
He lives! And while there’s life there’s 
hope aplenty. If only I could tell — ” His 
voke thinned on a troubled note. 
“Whedier this queer shrinkage is die re- 
stdt of a drug— or something, worse — 
“You’ve said that before 1” There was 
near frenzy in Grace’s cry “You, too, be- 
lieve it is a curse 1 That oH Zell Mendez 
has bewitched him — ” 

“Nonsense!” Koop snapped sharply. 
“Of course it must be the work of a drug. 
But, unfortunately, the small blue bottle 
which Pedro tlffew into the swimmmg 
pool had quite emptied itself brfoie I 
w»ent back to recorer it Ana^is of water

voice. “I’ve pl^ded with her, but riie only 
laughs, showing her yellow hag's teetli in 
a gloating snarl, calling down still more 
terrible oirses upon poor Ralph’s head. 
Oh, will he ever be conscious again? Or 
trill he die ?” 

Try as I might I could not opm my 
ey« nor give any sign that life was bura- 
more brightly within me, that all was 
not lost Grace came to the bedside. I' 
felt the warm towh of he:r fingers opon 
my cold and fiiuxtd hand In Iter stifled 
sob Acre was a note of sheer horror,, tlie 
reason for which I did not then compre- 
hend. 

“Somehow you rau^; stop this horrible 
thing, Heuierich !“ she exclaimed. “At any 
cost. Call in specialists to aid you, use 
every resource that money can buy, before 
it is too late.” 

“My dear Grace,” Hemerich Koop said, 
“money won’t help, nor can any specialist, 
r am doing my best to infiti«icfr the out- 
come of this peculiar sekure and no one 
could do more.” 

His words cheered me as I lay there a 
motionless, helpless hulk, for I knew the 
keenness of his brain, his thoroughness in 
seeking the solution of difficulties. If only 
he could contrive to ease the worries widi 
which Grace was besieged. 

They left the room together. I heard 
door open and close. Then, for hours 
it seemed, I was plagued ly visions of 
vicious faces leering. The tmwholesotne 
countenance of old Zell Meadez loomed 
above the foot of my bed, six^^g^e-toothed,. 
wild-eyed, stringy grey hair straggling 
across her leathv cheeka. I tkou|^t the 
l»t^ett Bps mouthed venomous curses over 
and over, and never in life or death would

her son. 

Pedro's magltgnant visage tormeftted

A moron at best, he was and

pimply. His forehead sloped straight 
away in line with a long, pointed nose, 
and his chin receded obliquely to form a 
snouted face like a hog’s. After my car 
had smashed his legs and left them but 
flopping clubs upon which he stumped 
about with the aid of two canes, Pedro’s 
appearance was enough to frighten women 
and children. His witless tongue forever 
drolled profane obscenity. 

Lying there in my torpid state, seeming 
to hear the foul threats he voiced, sud- 
denly I was obsessed with fear for Grace. 
What if the idiot sought to vent his spleen 
upon her? Alone in our big house, save 
for black servants, she would prove easy 
prey for him. The thought shocked me 
into wakefulness. My eyes snapped open, 
they widened with consternation, and my 
jaw hung loose at sight of the ugly face 
peering through an open window near my 
bed. 

tipEDRO-l” I gasped. "Is it you? Did 
I hear you talking?’' 

"I meant every word of it," he whis- 
pered, shrilly. “And why not? Now, 
you’re no better than me." 

"Filthy beast!’’ I rasped, weakly. “If 
I hear that you’ve so much as looked at 
Grace I’ll horsewhip you. And should 
you attempt to molest her I’ll break your 
back with my two hands.” 

"Y-a-ah! Your hands! Look at ’em, 
and tell me how much breakin’ they can 
ever do. You’ll never get off that bed 
alive. Don’t you know that your finish is 
all planned?” 

Pedro loosened the screen and swung it 
aside. I thought he intended to clamber 
in and murder me but a streak of stub- 
bornness kept me from calling aloud for 
help. With all the force of my will I 
strove to lift the hands he mentioned so 
contemptuou.sly, but could not. Pow'er- 
less as a babe, I demanded hoarsely : 


“What do you want? What do you 
mean to do ?” 

Pedro grinned, his eyes shining redly 
like two mirrors of hate. His subdued 
laughter jangled. 

“I’ll do everything I said — ^after you’re 
dead. She won’t listen till you're gone. 
But now that you look worse than me, 
your pretty wife’ll let me love her once 
you’re out of the way.” 

A red haze of hate suffused my brain 
and for a space I could not see clearly. 
Then the spasm passed and I found him 
leaning through the aperture, balancing a 
tiny blue bottle upon his palm. 

“Take it!” Pedro invited. “Quick 
death, easy death, without any pain. Ma 
wanted me to slip it into your grub, to 
make sure you die. But ’tain’t worth the 
risk. You’re dyin’ now. Take it, yourself, 
so your wife’ll quit cryin’ about you and 
listen to me.” 

“Get out!” I raged. "Go away from 
that w’indow before I yell for help. I'll 
have you shot — ” 

Pedro drew back hurriedly. 

“That ain't no way to act,” he com- 
plained, “after I came to do you a favor. 
Here! I’ll leave the bottle in this comer. 
Nobody’ll see it and you'll want it soon.” 
He re fastened the screen. 

After a long, gloating look at me Pe- 
dro disappeared. A low-flung shaft of 
light from the setting sun glinted upon 
the blue bottle and I stared, fascinated, 
wondering if in truth I might soon want 
the poison. 

Why had the idiot said : “Now that you 
look worse than me. . . ?” I remembered 
Doctor Koop’s comment concerning a 
strange “shrinkage” that puzzled him. Did 
he mean my skin, the wasting of my flesh ? 
I shuddered at thought of freakish hu- 
man skeletons I had seen, struggled in a 
blinding effort to gain control of my limbs, 
almost succeeded. 

After 1 had fallen back, gasping, upon 


70 


TERROR TALES 


the psilow a harrowing i&ir possessed me. 
Something was horribly wroi^! I must 
get up and away 1 To Grace. . . . 

What the ensuing effort to rise rost me 
in mental strain and mortal agony cmly 
God can realize. If there be such a thing 
as actual power of mind over matter, then 
it was that which, in the end, gave me 
emnmand of my musdes again. Striving 
to the point of deadly nausea, beset in 
every joint by dreadful pains which nearly 
drove me mad, at last 1 fcMxed myself to 
a sittit^ position, swung my legs down 
frmn the bed. Clinging to the white iron 
framework I made an effort to stand, 
although at first my knees buckled miser- 
ably. 

Dimly, I perceived the door of a closet 
across the room. On hands and knees I 
crawled to it, seeking a robe or other 
covering for my nakedness. I reached for 
the knob three times and failed, before I 
could draw myself erect. Swa 3 dng there, 
I found inside a suit of my dothes which 
Grace must have brought as a childish 
means of bolstering hope that cme day I 
would wear them home. Draggmg gar- 
ments from the hooks I crawled back to 
tte bed again. After a grueling ordeal of 
rising and seating myself, I drew on the 
dark grey trousers and maiKtged to stand. 
Dazedly I stared down at their absurd 
length, noting that the legs were at least 

0 foot toe longi Fumbling in the pockets 

1 found a familiar purse. Yes, indulntabty 
they were mine. Turning a little, then, 
I caught a glimpse of my reflectioi in the 
glass of a window that was closed. A cry 
of horror burst across my lips at sight of 
the revolting figure there darkly revealed. 

A dvrarfted and hairless monstrosity! 
My bald skull bulked far too large for the 
scrawny neck and stunted frame which 
supported it. Deepset eyes were gloomy 
ca'vems beneath my brow. My nearly 
fleshless jaws were those of a Death’s 
head, lips p^er thin and dghtly drawn. 


My broad shoulders- had narrowed and 
were bunched like those of a deformed 
child. My long and powerful legs were 
shrunken to si»ndling, bony shanks from 
which the last vestige of strength was 
swiftly ebbing. 

Staring at the odious reflected sliape I 
felt my reason sway. Locsii^ a render- 
ing screen I toppled upon tlie floor and 
sank into a bottomless abyss of blackness 
in which my sufferings were extinguished 
with the appalling slowness of creeping 
death. 

"DUT I lived. When next I knew tViat 
death’s groping clutch had missed me, 
it was to find myself again reposing in 
the hospital bed. Tbe voices I heard, and 
the ^xjken words, dispelled an awful 
lethargy which gripped my brain but did 
not break the drains of weakness that 
shackled my leaden limbs. 

“Ah, God ! I can’t bear to look at him.” 
It was my wife’s despairing cry. “No 
curse has done this! It fs the poison.” 
I listened to her muffled sobs of horror. 

Doctor Hemerich Koop was spealdug 
but I could not distinguish the things he 
said. When my eyes -flicked open I saw 
that he held Grace in his arms and was 
whispering with lips pressed close against 
her golden hair. She broke away and 
whirled to face him, her cheela flushed 
with anger and dismay. 

“You dare say such things to me! 
While Ralph Res dying — ” 

“As well say ‘dead,’ my dear, for soon 
he shall be. And even though I were to 
keep him alive, would you not choose me, 
small and ugly though I am, in prefer- 
ence to the jellylike thing which was once 
a man ? Ah ! He is watching us ! See him 
quivering there like a viscous blob upon 
the sheet.” 

“You demon 1” Grace screamed in 
chattering frenzy. "Not Zell Mendez — 
but you 1 You did this — ” 


HER SUITOR FROM HELL 


71 


“And why not? He stole your love 
from me.” 

“As though I ever could have loved a 
hunched and evil creature!” 

“I am a man !” Koop thumped his nar- 
row chest proudly. *T am active and 
strong. My brain is fine. Look, now, at 
the one who thought himself superior. Is 
not Ralph Payne a disgusting sight? He 
little resembles that ‘father of tall sons 
and lovely daughters’ of whom you 
boasted.” 

Grace approached on laggard feet and 
stood beside my bed. Tears streaming, 
she touched my torpid arm, my bony face, 
crying bitterly: 

“1 love him ! His soul lives despite the 
ruin you’ve made of his magnificent body. 
Oh, what have you done to him? What 
blight have you wrought?” 

Doctor Koop came near and hatred 
glowed in his eyes as he grinned down at 
me. 

“It was a master stroke,” he bragged. 
“The strategy of using Zell Mendez and 
her half-wit spawn as pawns in my little 
game. For days on end she voiced her 
threats to all she met, after the accident. 
There are fifty witnesses to swear that 
she contemplated the murder of Ralph 
Payne and made Pedro help her plan it. 
Now, both are jailed, accused of poison- 
ing your husband by contaminating the 
swimming pool, and no one ever shall 
hear of the clever operation that I per- 
formed upon his throat.” 

Grace stared, and so did I, my powers 
of speech paralyzed as yet although my 
tongue curled and twisted in an effort to 
talk. 

“You operated on Ralph ? Why ?” My 
wife’s eyes were round with terror. “Oh, 
tell me what you've done to him. Is there 
no cure?” 

“I could cure him — ^but at a price you 
may not wish to pay. Another might, if 
be were skilled in the science of the glands 


and knew what I have done. Prevailing 
upon Pedro Mendez to hide nearby and 
toss a bottle of common poison into the 
pool after frightening you, I let Ralph 
drink of drugged liquor from a bottle I 
brought, knowing that we’d have to rescue 
him from his dive. The numbing effect 
of the drug I used is instantaneous. That 
gave me an excuse to bring him here to 
the hospital. With only a simple-minded 
Cajun girl to help I planted a globule of 
metallic compound at the base of the para- 
thyroid gland where it would immediately 
create sufficient pressure to halt the 
gland’s functioning. The result, as you 
see. was swift decalcification of his bones, 
a shrinking of stature, a wasting of flesh. 
He is like a thing of rubber and jelly, 
now. as death approaches.” 

“But he could be cured?” Grace plead- 
ed. “Oh, say that he can be saved 1” 

“Of course. By removal of the pres- 
sure. and with proper treatment, in a mat- 
ter of months he might regain his normal 
size and health. But who shall grant him 
that boon, my dear?” 

“You shall! Hemerich! You say you 
love me. You must be kind. Restore him. 
We’ll forgive and forget. Stop this mad- 
ness and use your skill to make him a 
man again.” 

“You heard my terms. I mentioned a 
price — ” Koop’s smile was lecherous. He 
seized Grace in his arms and sought her 
lips. “The price is yourself — ^mine for al- 
ways. And you must answer now I” 

■j^EVER shall I forget the play of tor- 
turing emotions that swept over my 
dear wife’s face as she fought to submerge 
her revulsion, to find the courage to en- 
dure an odious ordeal. She gasped : 

“What do you mean — ^for always ? Not 
after he is well?” 

“If I grant him life,” Koop said, harsh- 
ly, “it must be without you, and he shall 
never know. At best, his mind might not 


72 


TERROR TALES 


be restored cwnpletely. It do rso 
harm to make certain of that.” 

Coerprehoiding his horrible intention 
to render me a witless hulk endowed witii 
life, Grace tfcrew herself upon her knees 
and {beaded piteously. Roughly, Koop 
thrust her suppHont hands aside. 

"If I only wanted you now, I’d take 
you. It most be of your own free will and 
f<M- always.” 

Again, weakening, he bis skhmy 
arms about her and pressed his r^aisive 
lips to hers. Grace tore hetsdf free, she 
strode him wkh her open palm, and 
dropped in a sd^ng hc^ upon die bed 
beside me. 

"Let me die wkh Ralph !” ^e moaned. 
"Don’t touch nse. Only let me — ” 

Hemerich Koop’s swarthy face paled 
greyly. I knew, then, that he had ex- 
pected victory. Failure seeraed to drive 
him mad. 

“Die? Never, you fool! I’ll keep the 
pair of you alive so long as the spark can 
be held within your rotting bodies! You 
shall endure the same operation, Grace, 
mid in tum sh^ become as he is. Bones 
of rubber and flesh of jdly, while your 
brain melts in harrowing helplessness. 
If you love him so, you shall lie beside 
him and dream of the ecstasies that you 
win know no more.” 

Springing upon Grace, Koop bound her 
hands ivith a towel, likewise her ankles. 
Dashing out of the room he returned with 
a hypodermic fringe and plunged the 
needle into her arm. Soon my wife’s 
froiaied stru^les ceased. Removing lier 
bonds Koop leaned across motionless 
body and peered into my startmg eyes. 

“You know! I can read the suffering 
there 1 Both mast live to suffer endlessly. 
White I watdi over you day by day and 
laugh at two steong lovers wJao eoi^ted

His har^ mirth echoed in the room. 
He opened the door and called. 


“Addie ! Cenne here !” 

A dull-eyed Cajun girl appeared, fear 
written large upon her stupid features. 
Koop exclaimed: 

“The lady is sick. You must help me 
operate !” 

He carried Grace out. The girl cast a 
frightened look at me. I thought her lips 
moved in settndtess pky, that she felt an 
urge to render aid, btrt stark terror held 
her captive and she foBowed Koop obedi- 
ently. 

Once more I set my mind to the task of 
making the fie^ (^y. If only I cotald 
move, roll off the bed, crawl to the room 
where Grace lay helpless beneatli his heH- 
hands. This time I coedd not. My 
greatest effort served only to elevate ragr 
head a triffing way. But in that brief in- 
stant a downward glance encompassed 
my shrunken legs and I groaned in trem- 
bling horror. The two limbs lay coiled 
awry i^on the sheet like rubber tubes in 
which no semWance of bone remaiaed. 
Koop had spoken truly. I was but a jd- 
lylike blob of slowly liquefying matter 
that was scarcely flesh. The shock seemed 
to disintegrate i»y brain and conscious- 
ness faded. 

^RACE was lying upon a bed which 
had been moved into the room before 
I awalsened. Some one had turned me 
upon my side so that I might sec her there 
when the toqior lifted. A white bandage 
encircled her throat and lier eyes were 
wide and starii^. Both wrists and ankles 
were caught dose to the irem frasnew'ork 
by broad straps to her prisoner. Her 
quiverkig lips formed a whispered query : 

“Ralph! Can you hear me? Can you 
speak?” 

For long moments I fou^ the rigidity 
of throat mitsdes, then croaking worda 
grated across my dry t«:th. 

“Yes, I he*u-. Oh, God! I see — ” 

"He operated on me ! Soon I shall

as ymi orsl” The dread sent«ice of doom 
gushed out of her very soul, a gulp of 
anguish. 

“How long?” 1 gasped. 

“A week, he sa»^ before the gland is 
aeriou^ affected. Oh, there is ao 
hope—” 

Koop's voice sounded at the doorway. 
His hateful vis^e was framed there, 
grinning. 

“Oh, yes there is, my dear. I might yet 
reconsider — within the week, you de- 
cide that life with me is preferable to liv- 
ing putrescence,” 

I found the strength to curse him, to 
utter threatening prophecies of retribu- 
tion. Doctor Koop only smiled. 

“You have revived considerably, as a 
result of treatment last m'ght while you 
were unconscious, I want you stronger — 
that you may suffer morel While you lie 
there, waiting, watching.” 

He stepped away to Grace’s bed, threw 
back the coverlid, tore her gown away. 
Lust gleamed in his hot eyes but hunger 
for vengeance and the will to torture pre- 
vailed. He turned aside, muttering: 

“fVatchmffI Seeing her lovely form 
shrivel and shrink. There’ll be wrinkles 
and bony angles where you knew curves 
and tender maiden’s flesh. Love will be 
smothered in revulsion as you watch each 
other disintegrate and become two 
dwarfed, disgusting thills with only 
brain cells hvir^.” 

Kocp went out, saying as he departed : 
"Soon the treatment will make you rav- 
enously hungry, Payne. In an hour or so 
rU bring you food and feed you with my 
own hands. For you must Kve! To see 
and suffer. . .’’ His brittle lad^bter edioed 
from a distance. 

Grace was weeping. I could think (rf 
no cheering thing to say. Stupefied, I lay 
resigned to the inevitable. But soon I 
experienced a faiat soisation oi hfe, of 
tkodatiei^ in the atm which ky cnisfaed 


beneath my body. Koop’s remark flashed 
across my mind. “You will be stroi^r. 
The treatment last night — ” Hepe flared 
faintly. Strong enough to move, to crawl, 
to exhaust the last famt spark of life force 
seeking aid for Grace? 

I thoi^ht of our isolated positiem in 
ffie swamp, then remembered the tele- 
phone. But the instrument in the outer 
oflice might as well have . been miles 
away. Feverishly, my frantic brain strug- 
^ed with the problem of what mi^tt be 
done if 1 found some vntige strength 
restored. My wandering gare paused at 
ffie nearest window. An ktea sprat^ into 
being. 

“Grace I” I exclatm^l. “There may be 
a fighting diance. If you could free an 
arm or leg. Try it!” 

Pitifully, she looked at me and shook 
her head, but I urged frantically: 

“Try! Twist and try I” 

Grace began to writhe, to ti^ and 
struggle. Faint moans of pain escaped 
her ti^t'drawn lips as the straps cut 
skin and flesh. At last, said: 

“I've one foot loose. But, R^ph, I can't 
do any niwe.” 

“Plant your heel against the wall,” I 
cried. “Push hard! Force your bed 
against mine, and shove me nearer to the 
window. It’s ojily a matter of inches — ” 

Grace succeeded in doing wliat I asked. 
Our beds collided and the impulse of her 
thrust skidded my cot against tlie window 
sill, rolling me upon my back as I made 
a desperate effort in that direction. Ly- 
ing there, then, I tried to move my hands, 
found new life m tlie finger tips but none 
in my arms. Slowly, gropii^ly, nails 
scratching at the bed linen and mind sav- 
^ely intent upon aeoimplishment, I 
draped one hand in fractional jerks 
across the sheet onto the window ledge, 
and seized ffie tiny bottle that Pedro 
Mendes had hidden there. 

The trivial mtucukr feat that fc^owed 


74. 


TERROR TALES 


exhausted me more than I can express. 
With the prize precariously clutched be- 
tween thumb and forefinger I worked 
my hand back by the power of fingertips 
alone until it reached my body. Three at- 
tempts I made to raise that left arm and 
failed. Then, like a crawling worm, I 
made it creep across my chest until it met 
the other. In a little while, when the cold 
sweat of weakness beaded my brow and 
nearly all my strength was spent, with 
my right hand I laid the vial in Grace’s 
palm. Her fingers closed upon it. 

•'What—” 

“It means escape,” I exdaimed. “Hide 
41 !” 

"I don’t understand.” 

Her eyes sought nune. I rolled my 
head and whispered: 

"It is poison.” 

rjOCTOR HEMERICH KOOP came 
^ later, bearing a well laden tray. His 
forecast was correct I knew the pangs 
of hunger but the viands he carried inter- 
ested me less than the bottle of wine. 
Placing the food upon a table, he turned 
to smile at Grace and said : 

“You’ve hurt yourself struggling. One 
strap was poorly fastened. Why not agree 
to my proposals and have them all off?” 

My wife looked up at him long and 
moodily. One could scarcely recognize 
her voice when, chokingly, she said: 

“I can’t bear itl To be Hke him! Oh, 
Godl I can’t — " 

“You mean — ” Doctor Koop leaned 
above her, eagerly. “That you have 
counted the cost of hopeless love for the 
thing that he has become ?” 

“My love is dead!” she stormed, hj^- 
terically. “I was faithful, I was true. But 
Ralph Payne is gone! There remains 
only . . . that!” She swung her eyes 
toward me and quickly looked away. 

Koop exclaimed ; “Then youTl come to 
me? Oh, this Is glorious.” 


Awkwardly, in his haste, he fumbled at 
the straps which bound her. Casting them 
aside he caught Grace in his arms and 
helped her to arise. 

“My dear one. My lovely one,” he 
gloated. “Always I’ve watched you, 
wanted you. And now you are mine !” 

With a shuddering sigh Grace pushed 
his pawing hands aside, forced a shrill 
laugh, crying: 

"Yours I shall be, but don’t ever call it 
love. It’s the price I must pay.” 

“Have it your own way,” he snapped. 
“So long as you do pay.” 

“Don’t be angry,” Grace pleaded. “I 
am upset and unnerved. Perhaps a littie 
of that wine — ” 

He snatclied up the bottle, smiling 
again. 

"Of course. It’s just the thing T’ 

Pouring two glasses he raised one and 
turned to me in mock salute. 

“Now, Ralph Payne, you’ll have sane- 
thing more to watch. Here’s to greater 
suffering.” 

Grace lowered the glass from her lips, 
face white as death, exclaiming : 

"Drink your toast to me! Have I not 
deserved it?” 

Koop’s countenance split m an evil 
grin. 

“You’re improving, my dear ! Wc’U get 
along famously.” 

Grace took his glass, half emptied, and 
gave him hers. 

“The better to seal our bargain, Hemer- 
ichl” she cried, and a laugh like an echo 
from hell rattled upon her bloodless lips. 

Koop tossed off the drink at a gulp. He 
started violently. A terrible tremor shook 
his scrawny frame from head to foot. 
Collapsing, he screamed : 

” Poison!^

T he road went suddenly over a 
high narrow trestle spanning the 
gorge. We held our breath while 
negotiating it And then we saw the lights 
of our destination. 

Groff Hall! Private residence, hotel or 
whatever it might be, it perched like an 
eagle’s nest high on the crags, with the

rounding it. Eerie location indeed, with

these wild lightless defiles, slashed and 
broken, storm-swept by rain and wind

turned, and then we came to the small 
rocky top, with the two-story rambling 
stone structure before us. The lights of 
its windows were blurred yellow blobs 
through the torrential rain. Whatever 
sort of place it was, it had to be our rest-

go no further. 

I pulled up under a porte-cochere. Our 
radiator was boiling again; the engine 
was knocking violently when I shut it oif. 

‘T’ve Iiad enough,” I said as I climbed 
from the car. “Wherever we are — here 
we stay.” 

If I had known ! 

“Good evening, sir. 

The voice by its very unexpectedness, 
was horribly startling. Edith, my sister, 
gasped, with a faint, suppressed cry. I 
whirled to find a man standing at my el- 
bow. In the dimness, here under the porte- 
cochere roof, I could see him as a tall 
figure, broad and burly. He was without 
hat and outer coat; evidently seeing our 
approaching headlights as we toiled up 
the grade, he had come out to greet us. 

“Oh,” I said. “How do you do? My 
sister and I — we’re lost. You — we hoped 
this was a hotel — our car’s running bad- 
ly — we’re hungry.” 

He turned with a queer, stooping ges- 
ture as though peering at Edith. He said ; 

“I’m Dr. Emil Groff.” A heavy, gut- 
tural, foreign voice, but there was a dig- 
nified suavity about it. “A hotel?” he 
said. “Well — not just that. But you are 
welcome. Come in. The young lady must 
be cold.” 

He left us standing on the threshold 
of the open door while against my protes- 
tations he carried in our two suitcases. 
We saw a dim hallway with electric lamps 
heavily shaded. A tall, brown-haired 
young woman in a maid’s uniform stood 
watching us. 

And suddenly there was the distant 
sound of a girl’s laughter, instantly 
checked. It echoed through the silent in- 
terior ; and there was about it so eerie a 
quality that Edith and I stared at each 
other wordlessly, and the maid, whirlii^ 
at the soimd, hurried instandy away. 

Dr. Emil Groff came with our suitcases. 

“Most horrible night, my friends. | 


shall put your car away later. We’re 
short-handed tonight. My nurse is on 
holiday, and my man went to Chattanooga 
for supplies. I fear the storm may keq) 
him away for tonight.” 

What was this place? A hospital? A 
madhouse? I saw this Dr. Groff now as 
a man of perhaps forty. A burly six-foot 
fellow, with a head of close-clipped black 
hair — a smooth-shaven face of rugged, 
somewhat handsome features. He stood 
fingering a black eyeglass ribbon that 
hung around his neck; his dark gaze, 
from deep-set eyes under heavy black 
brows, seemed appraising me. 

“Oh — yes,” I said awkwardly. “It cer- 
tainly is a bad night.” 

I told him our name — Baker; and that 
we were traveling from Florida to Chi- 
cago. He listened, with a very queer, 
grave smile faintly pulling at his mouth; 
and abruptly he interrupted me. 

"Well, I am honored that you came 
here, Mr. Baker. We shall make you 
comfortable — this storm, no one could 
travel these mountains a night like this.” 
His gaze clung to Edith's dark, slim 
beauty. He added, “We are glad to have 
you, my dear young lady. We will do 
everything possible to make you happy.” 

A madhouse, here in this wild, lonely 
mountain fastness? This man — himself 
one of the inmates? Thoughts may run 
wild very fast . . . Edith took an invol- 
untary step backward as though his 
words were physically repelling, and she 
flung me a startled, questioning glance. 

Then before I could speak, he had 
turned to me. "I understand you, Mr. 
Baker.” His lowered voice and his bulk 
momentarily exduded Edith who was a 
few feet from us. “Your sister needs — 
attention? Later we will discuss the de- 
tails.”

biack and white umform again sending 
near ua. I ^mmered: 

“Wi^» — we don’t want to intrude, Dr. 
Groff. I reafly thought this was a ho- 
tel — '* 

My one wild wish then was to get Edith 
out of here, storm or no storm. 

“Hotd?" he said. “Well — ^yes, you 
might call it that. Of course your stay 
will be brief — supper only, perhaps, if the 
storm dimimshes. When my man returns 
I will ha^ him fix your car. He is a very 
good mechanic.’' 

The maid said, “Shall I take tliem up- 
stairs, Dr, Groff?” 

“Yes, Millie. Just temporary rooms. 
They may leave after supper. ITl bring 
up their hj^ge.’* 

The maid touched Edith’s arm. 

“Come, miss.” She said it gently but 
firmly, as one would talk to a child. 

And again Groff was leaning close to 
me. 

“Naturally they don’t like the idea of 
permaaeney. That's almost always the 
case.” 

Edith, the patient to be humored upon 
her admittance here! I smiled with re- 
lief. 

“Look h^e,” I said, “you’ve got us all 
wrong, Dr. Groff. Is this a ho^ital? I 
didn’t realize it. I assure you there’s 
nothing wrong with my sister.” 

Certainly this fellow was no madman. 
He saw that Edith could not hear me 
now — that I could not possibly be talking 
for her benefit He looked startled, and 
disappointed. 

He said, ‘T did not understand you. 
It is so almost impossible for any one to 
arrive here by chance.” 

“But we did,” I said, and smiled. A 
sudden v^ue hostility had come to him. 
His gaze had an appraising suspicion in 
it I addfed, '*Wc won't intrude further.” 

His BosptcicMi seemed to vanish. “No 
inb’sstcm,” Ite said. “This is Groff Hatf. 


We receive patients who are — depressed. 
Melancholic, shall I say? My treatment 
has proven very efficacious. There is hap- 
piness here,”' 

Certainly nothing very sinister, for all 
its weird morbidness. I said, “I s:^ — 
well then, if we might have lodging until 
the storm is past.” 

“Of course,” he agreed. “My charges 
are reasonable and we have plenty of 
room — Oh, my wife. Dr, Agatha Groff. 
This is Mr. Baker and bis sister. Not 
patients — they were lost in the storm.” 

A woman in bladt load approached us. 
Despite my polite endeavor to smile as 
I took her extended hand, an inward 
shudder swept me. The woman was of 
indeterminate age, certainly older than 
her stalwart husband — ^ little, hunched, 
thick-set figure no taller than my shoul- 
der, gorilla.-like, with long thick arms. 
He dress was stiff black taffeta, wkh 
white ruching around her short neck 
where her head set down between wide 
hunched shoulders. The dress gave an 
incongruous air of primness, carried also 
by her black hair, streaked with grey, 
primly parted in tlie middle, plastered 
down and rolled into a knot at the back. 

But it was her face that most startled 
me. Sharp, hatchet feattires ; and for all 
her smile new, there was so intent a 
malevolence in her face that I caught my 
breath. 

“Mr. Baker? You are welccane — ” 

She bad the same guttural accent as 
her husband. Her hand gripping mine 
was like a roughened, scaly daw. Then 
she turned to where Edith stood gajAig. 

“You are welcome, my dear.” Her 
little glittering eyes seemed feasting on 
Edith's dark slhn beauty; die sucked in 
her breath with an audfele hiss. “Wl^, 
my dear child — you are beautiful— 4>eau- 
tiful — ” 

We presently followed the maid up- 
stairs. Edith grilled my arm.

TERROR TALES 


"We'll go right after supper!" 

"Yes!” 

NOISE of the storm was far 
more apparent up here on the second 
floor. The slap and pound of the rain on 
the roof was audible. Gusts of wind, as 
though this were a tropical hurricane, 
rattled the old building from end to end. 
A dim upper hallway confronted us, with 
ft number of bedrooms opening from it 

The maid turned to a dosed door al- 
most at the head of the staircase. She 
said, "This will suit you, Mr. Baker. 
Two connecting rooms. Tliere is plenty 
of choice. We have only two other pa- 
tients just now.” 

She had a quiet dignity, this maid. An 
intelligent-looking, handsome girl of about 
twenty. Wliat could have been her dark 
ftnd tragic history, tliat made her a part 
of this wild place? I have often wondered. 

“Other patients?” I said. "We’re not 
patients. We’re leaving right after sup- 
per.” 

As though the storm were hurlipg de- 
fiance at my words, there came a sudden 
sizzling lightning flash, and a crack of 
thunder with it. The lurid glare showed 
through a window at the distant end of 
tfie hall. The electric lights of the house 
simultaneously vanished, so that for that 
bisant I saw the figures of Edith and the 
maid painted green-white, and the de- 
crepit hallway an inferno of glare. Then 
the hall lights flickered on again. The 
thunder rolled away into the distance like 
ft grumbling, retreating giant. 

Edith gasped, "Good heavens, that was 
dose.” 

"We have bad storms in these moun- 
tains sometimes,” the maid said. She 
stood with her hand on the bedroom 
door ; her gaze on Edith. "You’re going 
after supper? You’re not — sick?” 

"No,” Edith said, and tried to smile, 
"I’m not” 

From one of these upper bedrooms, 


near us now, again came that eerie chill- 
ing burst of laughter. So close to us — 
it seemed two girls laughing behind one 
of these closed doors. Laughter so queer, 
so wildly, unnaturally strange that to the 
listener there could not seem any quality 
of mirth in it, but only horror. I saw the 
maid stiffen ; she took an involuntary step 
toward the sound. Then she changed her 
mind and swung on us. 

"You’re going right after supper?" 
She was breathless, with furtive lowered 
voice. On the nearby stairs, Dr. Groff 
was starting up with our suitcases. 

“You do tliat,” the maid added swifdy. 
“You — never mind tlie storm — ^you get 
your sister out of here — " 

"Yes,” I agreed. I gripped her shoul- 
der as I bent toward her. "Millie, tell 
me — ” 

A bedroom door diagonally across the 
hall burst open. From it two young girls 
came running. The hall light shone on 
their slim pink-white beauty, their bodies 
clad in brief filmy undergarments, their 
hair wildly flowing. They staggered to- 
gether into the hall, clinging to each oth- 
er, wildly laughing in a paroxysm of ma- 
cabre mirth. Then they saw Millie as she 
sprang for them. 

"We want Mrs. Groff I” they screamed. 
"Where is Mrs. Groff. Isn’t it time?” 

Millie was struggling with them. "No, 
not time yet! You go back. You shouldn’t 
have done that You stop it.” 

She shoved them back into the roan, 
and banged the door on them. But their 
wild screaming laughter still sounded. 
Edith and I stood frozen. Gruesome, un- 
holy laughter. What was this gliastly 
thing ?

inscrutable, ignoring that brief wild ap- 
pearance of the two laughing girls. In 
the hall he had murmured a few words 
to Millie, with a glance at the nearby 
door behind which the girls now were si- 
lent. I caught a fragment of the maid’s 
answer : 

“ — locked them in.” 

Then Dr. Groff had come to our door. 
“Supper will be ready presently. Come 
down soon.” 

He left us ; he and the maid descended 
the stairs. 

Edith stood shuddering. I took a look 
around the two small bedrooms. They 
were meagerly but comfortably furnished. 
Each had a single window, and a door to 
the hall ; and there was a connecting door 
between them. I peered from one of the 
windows. Solid blackness, with only the 
wild rage of the storm. But I could see 
enough to realize that there was a sheer 
drop from these windows, down into the 
canyon upon the brink of which the house 
was perched. 

“Those girls — ” Edith murmured, when 
I went back to her. 

Whatever this macabre mystery, I could 
see no sense of talking about it. Heaven 
knows, Edith was frightened enough. 

"I’ll get us out of here right after sup- 
per,” I said. 

Then we heard a car arriving. Not the 
manservant from Chattanooga, for as we 
silently moved out to the head of the 
stairs, the visitors were visible down in 
the lower hall. Dr. Groff and Millie, 
greeting a party of three. Two men and 
a girl. One of the men was elderly ; grey- 
haired. He seemed ill ; he stood a mo- 
ment, th«i Millie brought a chair in 
which he sat down while the other man 
talked with Dr. Groff. This other man 
was young — in his thirties doubtless ; a 
stalwart fellow, with smooth black hair. 
The girl had taken off her hooded cloak. 
The hall light gleamed on her pale-gold 


tresses. She was small, no older than 
Edith, and extremely beautiful. 

I thought suddenly of the way Dr. 
Groff’s deformed hag of a wife had stared 
at the dark slim beauty of Edith. Was 
this new arrival another possible victim? 

An aura of wealth was upon these three 
latest visitors. They came upstairs in a 
moment. At the staircase head they 
turned down the hall in the other direction 
so that they did not pass our door, but the 
girl’s voice floated to us : 

"You’re not too tired, father?” 

We were presently ready to go dowm 
to supper. As we started, it seemed that 
amid all the noises of the outside storm 
I heard footsteps, pattering away in the 
upper hall. 

“Edith ! Wait here a minute !” 

The dim lull was empty; but ten feet 
or so beyond the locked door where Millie 
had shoved the two girls, the hall turned 
a right angle to the left, into anotlier wing 
of the building. I ran there. The hall 
beyond the angle was almost dark. Thirty 
feet from me, it seemed that I saw a 
shadow — blob of dark, indistinguishable 
shape disappearing into a doorway. 

' I ^rilS section of the hall was heavily 
carpetal. I padded noiselessly .for- 
ward into the deepening darkness. It 
wasn’t a doorway into which the sliadow 
had plunged, but the top of a steep flight 
of descending back stairs. Solid black- 
ness. But down at the bottom there was 
a vertical slit of light which marked a 
door. The slit was narrowing; the door 
evidently just being closed by whoever 
it was I had been following. The door 
stopped, ajar, and abruptly I heard dim 
voices. They were muffled, blurred by 
the confined space and the sounds of the 
storm ; but I caught fragments of the 
words. 

“You — Ludvig — what are you doing?”

"The Forrests. The old man, and Rolf 
Forrest, his nephew. And the old man’s 
dau^iter came — " 

It was Emil Groff talking ; I felt sure 
of tliat. 

Then Ludvig said, “His daughter I I 
saw her-'-palfi hut somehow glowing- 
like burnished gcJd." 

“Ludvig! Stop that, you fool! You’B 
get us into troubte with your devitisb— “ 
“You talk Eke fftat to mel Emil, you 
dare talk like that!” 

“Yes, I do. li’a going to stojp; I tell 
you. These two damnable girisf—when 
they die— that's the end. We’ll have no 
nuMn in this houseT' 

“Get ns into trouble!’' There was a 
wild cadthog fellah. This Ludvig, whose 
authority Emil now was challenging — 
was this a nKuuac, nr something near it ? 

“Get us mto trouble? Worse than your 
muiders, Emil? Worse than — " 

^’^^ese’s Wg money fn that, you focd. 
These Fosre^ are rich- It’s be^ care- 
fully pknoed, so there is no daii^r to us 
in it This young fellow, Rolf Forrest — " 
“You — go to hell,” Ludwig suddenly 
rasped. “You can’t control me s you’ll do 
what I teM you, as you always have. Who 
owns tins building? Whose mcm^ set 
yon in business here?” Again that wild 
chuckl'mg laughter. “You dare to tell me 
what I shall dol It's pl^sure, Emil. 
What is life without pleasure?” 

It seemed suddenly that they were scuf- 
fling. The door at the foot of these back 
stairs clicked closed as one cd dietn 
bun^)ed against it; and the sounds were 
shut from me. With my heart pottnd- 
ing, I went back to Edith. A maniac 
loose here? Thus Ludvig, lurking here, 
never showing himself, intent only on hts 
lust for scmie weird, fentastlc pleasure? 

Edith was still at our bedroom door. 
“Jack, what was it?” 


“Nothing,” I said. "Swne one may 
have been up here — went down the back 
stairs — I didn’t see anybody — ” 

In a minute or tw'o vrt left tlic room. 
Muffled, eerie laughter was coming again 
from the bedroom in whidi the two girls 
were locked. In spite of ourselves we 
stood a moment, shudderingly listening 
to it Then we desceitded the front stair- 
case. In the front lower hall Mrs. Groff 
came forward to meet us. 

"Ah, my dear children — ^you are ready ? 
Come in to supper.” 

She stood in her prim black taffda, 
smiling at tis ingratiatingly. Hideous lit- 
tle woman. A travesty of wonianhood, 
like a grinning fanale gargoyle. I won- 
dered then if my reyolted impressioiw of 
her were not inspired by the mere mis- 
fortune of her deformed, physical ugli- 
ness. Certainly she seemed trying to be 
pleasant. She fed us akmg the back lower 
hall, to the dining room where a dozen 
broad tables stood devoid qf setting. 

“You have very few patients just now,” 
I said, 

“Yes — only two — ^Millie serves them in 
their room. And a party of three who will 
dine with you.” 

The table, here in a corner of the din- 
ing room, was set for six. The Forrests 
came now; and when the introductions 
were over, Mrs. Groff said, “My hus- 
band — he expected to be your host — ^but 
he is detained — ’* 

My thoughts leaped. He was stiff hav- 
ing troubte with Ludvig? Why was- there 
no mention of this Ludvig? 

Mrs. Groff added, “But Dr. Groff will 
join you presently. As for me, I must 
hdp MilHe— ” She smiled her grimace 
upon us all. She saM, “This terrible 
storm — we will do our best for you — ” 

She moved off to the kitchen, and Mil- 
lie served ns. Five of us, with one empty 
chair like a spectre in our midst. We 
were, in truth, a strange little gathering. 


LAUGH AND DIE! 


83 


Old Mr. Forrest — a man with the aura 
of wealth and the blight of illness so ob- 
viously upon him. Rolf Forrest, his 
nephew — stalwart, darkly handsome fel- 
low, with an arrogant swagger that wealth 
had doubtless given him. 

And Anne Forrest. To her, most of 
my interest went. She was sitting beside 
me — hair of pale gold — faultless com- 
plexion — a face beautiful as a cameo. 
Beautiful as Edith. Amazing contrast, 
these two girls — the dark, slim Latin 
beauty of Edith, inherited from our 
mother; and this Anne, like a little fra- 
gile flower of the north. 

T NEED not detail our conversation 

during the meal. It was strained, 
awkward, as though each of us might be 
engrossed with thoughts that could not 
be voiced. Edith and I told the mis- 
adventures which had landed us there. 
And the others explained that old Mr. 
Forrest had come here for his health — a 
nervous depression which had come upon 
him from overwork in Nashville. 

“I shall be lonely here,” he said som- 
berly. 

“But only for a week or two, uncle,” 
Rolf Forrest said. “Then you’ll be so 
well we’ll come and get you and take 
you back.” 

Anne Forrest spoke hardly a word. 
But when the meal was nearly over, at 
a moment when the others were talking 
with Edith, she suddenly leaned toward 
me. And I caught her agitated murmur, 
“I must — see you alone tonight — please 1” 

“Yes,” I murmured. 

I had for the time, forgotten that Edith 
and I were leaving tonight. I admit I 
was attracted with a singular swiftness 
to the fragile golden beauty of Anne For- 
rest. Whatever menace was here in this 
sinister household, certainly it was di- 
rected at this other girl, not at Edith. And 
her whisper now was appealing. 

She added, “You and your sister — I — 


I’m frightened — I must talk to you — ” 

Rolf Forrest was saying, "Yes, we ex- 
pected — ^Anne and I — to go back to Nash- 
ville tonight. But the accursed bridge is 
down — no way of getting out of here — 
for anybody — not till daylight.” 

It brought a gasp from Edith, and it 
snapped me to alertness. Marooned here. 

“Why,” I said, "nobody told us thj-t. 
My sister and I were leaving tonight.” 

Young Forrest shrugged. 

"Not a chance. You came over that 
bridge — you know, the one like a trestle, 
nearly falling down of its own weight— r” 
He gestured. "Just down the cliff a hun- 
dred feet or so. That lightning flash ! 
Lord, we’d only just gotten over the 
bridge when the lightning hit it 1” 

He laughed. I suppose it was quite a 
normal laugh, but it sent a shudder over 
me as though any form of laughter in this 
mysterious house must carry horror. 

“That bridge,” he added, “just slid 
sidewise and fell.” 

I looked to Anne for confirmation, and 
she nodded. Mrs. Groff was approaching, 
helping Millie with the dessert. 

"My husband has just been to verify 
the wreck of the bridge,” she said. “It 
is down. On foot, one might get around 
the canyon to the other road by daylight, 
but it is many miles.” 

Marooned here. With the pale-gold 
beauty of Anne Forrest beside me, I own 
that at that moment it did not seem so 
horrible a catastrophe. 

If I had known I I would have taken 
Edith and Anne and run out on foot to 
huddle through the night among the black, 
storm-swept crags — if I had known !

” Edith said. 

“We’ll take turns keeping awake,” I

TERROR TALES 


agreed. “Jttst aa a matter of precaution. 
But don’t let’s get too tense over it.” 

I laugbed slwrtly; and I was startled 
to see Edith flash me a look, as thougli 
to her too, the sound of laughter here was 
frightening. 

"Mysterious damn jdaee,” I added. 
“MeianchoHa patients! That's morbid 
enough for anybody — but I don’t see any 
danger to us.*' 

I said it lightly enough, but the things 
I Imew that Edith didn't know, again 
leaped at me. Tlie luihing Ludvig. A 
third member of this Groff family? The 
One who held the purse strings, a lustful 
fiend who must not be seen by us visitors 
—or even mentioned. Demoniac with his 
desires unspeakable, so tudeous that even 
Enifl Groff was revolted at th^n — afraid 
of ^he c»ftaequent^. Yet Emil himself, 
had beea—ond perhaps was now — en- 
gaged in mttrder. And I thought of the 
appeal of Anne Forrest, Something 
was threatening her, so that in her terror 
she had aj^ealed to me, a strMiger. 

I had had no opportunity yei of seeing 
Anae alone. After supper we had all gone 
into a elieerless little siltii^ room. It was 
by then laearly nine o’clock. We sat for 
perhaps half an hour, discussing the storm 
which stlH was raging. Queer storms, 
these of the Tonuefisee mountains. The 
lightning bolt which had demolished the 
ramshackle brid^ was the last. No more 
had €ome. But the wind was still high, 
and the min was still a torrent. 

It seemed that Anne was watching an 
opportunity to talk to me alone, but could 
not find it. Then her father seemed tired. 
They w:nt to their bedrooms, with the 
hunchback Ihtle Mrs. Groff escorting 
them to be sure they were comfortable; 
and Edith and I totlowed. 

At the top of the stairs as we all said 
goodnight; R seemed that Anne flashed 
me a glpnce, but whatever her meaning, 
I could not determine it. 


■"You caai sleep if you like,” Edith was 
saying. “And I’m staying here with you — 
not iti my room.” 

We sat together in one of the bedrooms. 
We had closed and locked the hall doors 
of both rooms; and left tlie connecting 
door betwttn thesn <^)en. The hotise had 
goite almost immediately silent. There 
was up here on this floor with us, as far 
as we knew, only the two girls iodced m 
the bedroom diagonally across the hall; 
and the Forrests, who had three adjacent 
bedrooms on this upper hall just beyond 
the front staircase. 

Those two girls whose unholy laughter 
was so shocking to hear — I sat wondering 
whether Millie had taken their supper ; 
if any attention were being paid to them. 
They were silent now — a silence that 
somehow seined more ominous even than 
their blood-cWUing laughter. 

T^e Groffs and Millie were downstairs, 
so far as 1 knew ; perhaps their bedrooms 
were down there. Emil Groff liad not 
appeared. And that Ludwig — 

I found that I was doaing, with drifting 
thoughts. If only I were anned. Some 
weapon — but I had none, save a very in- 
effectual pea-knife. But I mustn’t mention 
it to Edith. Tomorrow I would see Anne 
again — 

That hndvig — would he be roaming the 
house now? 

Tlie thotaght sna|^)ed me into alertness. 

“What is it, Jack?*’ 

"Nothing, Edith, Hadn’t you better lie 
down on the bed ? I’ll stay awake," 

“No. I’m all right here." 

Abruptly the small electric bulb in the 
ro(Mii was ejrtmguished. We were plunged 
into darioiess. 

"Jackr 

"Sit still,” I murmured, “Probably it’ll 
come on in a minute,” 

But it did not. AU through the stonn 
the lights of the bouse had been waverii^; 
but now It seemed permanent. 


LAUGH AND DIE! 


85 


^T’HE darkness crowded us — frightened, 
against all reason. I could hear Edith’s 
terrified breathing ; her hand reached out 
and gripped my arm. 

“Oh— Jack!” 

“E^sy,” I said. “There was a stump 
of candle on the table. I guess the lights 
up here in these mountains are never very 
dependable.” 

I fumbled and found the candle ; lighted 
it. Even its wavering, tiny yellow glow 
was reassuring. Then a startling thought 
hit me. The light was out in our adjoining 
room. The storm, during the last half 
hour, had seemed rapidly abating. The 
rain had ceased ; the wind was still strong, 
but noticably less than before ; and outside 
our windows now there was fitful moon- 
light. Queer, that having weathered the 
storm, the lights would go out now. Were 
they out all over die house, or just in our 
two rooms? Had someone pulled out a 
fuse, to plunge us, and all the house per- 
haps, into darkness? 

I went to the bedroom door, with 
Edith’s gaze upon me. 

“What is it. Jack?” 

“Just want to see if the lights are out 
in the hall.” 

The little hall was solidly dark. Evi- 
dently every light in the house was ex- 
tinguished. And there was a new silence 
here now — a black, empty silence, with 
the rattle of rain on the roof missing — 
and the surge of the wind almost gone, so 
that now the silence was blank, unnatural. 
I stood, straining my hearing. Was that 
a dim, choking sound of laughter? 

I turned to Edith. 

“Those girls,” I said softly, “laughing 
again.” 

Was it laughter? Or something else 
now ? On impulse I crossed diagonally to 
the door on the other side of the hall. 
Behind me, Edith stood framed in our 
doorway, by the candlelight. 

I reached the other doorway. Laughter? 


It was soft, eerie. A choked laughter? I 
bent with my ear to the wooden panel. 
And I heard a blur of confused sounds. 
The thump of the girls moving about. 
And queerly gruesome sounds of their 
suppressed voices. Giggles ... A laugh, 
choking into a sob. . . A thump, with a 
revolting, giggling little scream. . . . 

With wild rtmning thoughs I straight- 
ened, to return to Edith. And frozen. I 
stood tense, with dilating nostrils. What 
was this I was smelling? A drift from 
under the girls’ door. A faint, weird 
smell, of which I had suddenly become 
aware. A stench? A perfume? Inde- 
finable— 

I went back to Edith; closed our bed- 
ro<mi door, and locked it. 

“The/re in there,” I said. “Just the 
same — laughing — poor little devils — 
maniacs — ” 

There must have been some look on my 
face that stopped her questioning. I .did 
not meet her gaze. 

“Lie down, Edith,” I added. "The night 
will seem interminable if you just sit 
there.” 

“I’m all right.” 

Half an hour. It did indeed seem an 
eternity as I sat alone with my question- 
ing thoughts. Beside me, fn a little wood- 
en rocker with a bed pillow behind her, 
Edith was dozing. 

And suddenly in the silence I heard a 
tap on our bedroom door. &3ft. Furtive. 
Edith sat up, staring at me wordlessly. 
The tap came again. 

“Don’t open it,” Edith warned as I 
rose. 

At the door I said softly : 

“Who is it ? What you want ?” 

“Mr. Baker. Oh, please — ” Anne’s 
voice. I jerked open the door and she 
came in like a white^ darting wraith, the 
light of the candle she was carrying paint- 
ing her head and neck with its yellow 
glow.

TERROR TALES 


‘Tfow — Edith gasped ; and as I 
snatdied the candk, Anne ran to Edith 
with a Httie xxy. 

“Oh — Tve been so lightened — I had 
to come to yoo. When the lights went 
out a while ago—I j«st txjnldn’t stand its — 
I had to come — 

She -was 'rfi^nng mth coM and terror ; 
Edith led her to the bed, and sat there 
with arms aromid her. 

"What is it, dear? You’re frightened? 
WeH of course — ^this ghastly house.*’ 

TtiST a girl terrified at being alone in 
this weird |^ac^ so ttiat she was Jm- 
pelkd to seek protection from us strangers, 
even though her father and cousin were 
here with her? Edith’s glance questioned 
me. I said gently ; 

“I couldn’t make any oppfsrtunity to 
talk with you. I thought, tomorrow — ” 

*'TtfinDrr4Sw may— may be too late,” she 
gasped. tOi, I suppose it’s just my silly 
fears. This — thra ghasdy house, as you 
say. Btit I was afraid, even before Rolf 
brought father and me up here.” 

My mind flung back to that altercation 
I had heaid at the foot of the stairs just 
before supper. Emil Groff, and the mys- 
terious Ludwig. **These Forrests are 
rich. It’s all been carefully plaimed." 

“Your cousin Rolf brou^t you up 
here?” 1 demanded. 

“Yes. Father was taken ill — a sort of 
nervous breakdown. Depressed — threat- 
ened with wbat they call melancholia. 
Then Rolf found this jfece. He came up 
here to inspect it. Tb^ — ffiey cure people 
here who have melancholia — ” She sucked 
in her breath. “Depressed insanity — that’s 
what th^ call it when it gets worse. And 
Rolf Kiid that die cure here was wonderful 
and he persuaded father to come.” 

I^e a Kttle light in distant darkness, 
I began to understand. 

“Your father is rich?” I said gently. 

She stared. “Yes.” And she added wiffi 


a stark note of terror in her voice : 
'You’re guessing what Fm thinking. It’s 
only ray imagination maybe, but I — I've 
always been alraid of Rolf. He wants to 
marry me— I don’t love him — ” 

"Afraid for yourself?” I inuimured. 
“No. Afaaid for father. My father said 
he’d never let Rolf marry me. And tiiere's 
the business — the inheritance. Rolf is 
general manager now, but father doesn’t 
like his work. They— they qtiarrded a 
few weeks ago, and fatlier threatened to 
have Rolf leave dte busineK — and to 
change liis will niayte,” 

Murder for a price 1 So that was what 
Emil Groff was after { “Big money in it — 
no danger to us — ^all carefully plannetb— ” 
This place, a murder house — ^where one 
might bring his intended victim to be 
killed I A little of this grewsome, sinfeter 
mysfory — one angle of it at least — now 
seemed plain. 

I said s%viffly'. 

“Is your father sleejHag alone now ?” 
“Yes. He has one bedroom — ^Rolf's is 
adjoining with a door between them. Mine 
is n^t to Rolf’s.** 

“No door between you and Rolf?” 
“No. And I got terrified — just think- 
ing. Oh, wliat are you going to do?" 

I had seized one of the candles. 

“^Vake your father up,” I said. “We’ll 
have to plan some way lo guard him.” 

In truth, I had no plan, save that I 
could not let tl^at old man sleep in there 
alone now. If only I had a weapon! I 
saw now so many adversaries, tonight in 
this sinister household! Emil Groff, in- 
tent upon murdering this victim — aided, 
no doubt, by liis malevolent gargoyle wife. 
And Rolf Forrest, here to see the murder 
accomplished, and to take the body back 
home with Dr. Groff’s death certificate. 

And the lurking, fiendish Ludvig — 
what part would he play in this ? 

Both the girls were clinging to me. I 
said: 


LAUGH AND DIEI 


87 


“We’ll figure out some excuse to guard 
your father. We’ll tell him you got too 
frightened to stay alone. Then Edith and 
I will stay with you and him — ’’ 

They followed me, clinging to me as I 
opened our door and raised the candle 
to light the dark and silent hallway. It 
was only fifty feet to the bedroom of 
Anne’s father. We passed the front hall 
stairs. No sound. The wavering little 
light from my candle shone partly down 
the stairs, with solid blackness in the lower 
hall. 

“This is your father’s door, Anne?” 

“Yes—” 

I rapped softly. I said softly: 

“Mr. Forrest — oh, Mr. Forrest, wake 
up.” 

The silence was wnlnous. Ghastly. Ter- 
rifying. The old door rattled slightly as 
though from a puff of wind behind it. I 
turned its knob and shoved; but it did 
not yield ; it was locked on the inside. 

“Anne, you call him,” Edith murmured. 

“Father! Father, dear — ” 

No answer, though I rapped again, 
much louder. It was loud enough now 
to arouse Rolf. I turned to the adjacent 
door. 

“This Rolf’s?” 

“Yes.” 

I thumped. 

“Rolf Forrest? Let me ini This is 
Jack Baker. Let me in!” 

No answer. I turned the knob. The 
unlocked door went inward with my shove 
and I burst .into the room with the girls 
behind me. It was unlighted, save by an 
eerie shaft of moonlight from the window, 
and now, the light of my candle. The bed 
had not been occupied. Rolf Forrest was 
not here. To one side was the closed com- 
mimicating door to the bedroom of Anne’s 
father. I dashed to it; turned its knob. 
It swung and I went through. 


A GUST of wind met me, extinguishing 
my candle. The window was wide 
open, with moonlight streaming in, and a 
blast of the night air. Anne’s father lay 
in the bed, with the covers to his chin. He 
seemed to be peacefully sleeping. I bent 
over him. Pallid face in the moonlight. 
Behind me the girls were shuddering. 

I said, “Mr. Forrest, wake up.” I 
shook him insistently, with a wave of dis- 
may sweeping me because I knew it was 
futile. Then I swung. “You girls step 
back. He — he's fainted, I guess. ’•* 

Anne gave a little cry, and Edith drew 
her back. Both of them knew what I 
meant. 

Dead. He lay here, unbreathing. I 
jerked down the window sash — I saw out- 
side that sheer drop of a hundred feet or 
more down to the little canyon of the 
mountain torrent. Then I turned back to 
the bed. Dead, unquestionably. Yet, so 
far as I could tell, no mark of violence on 
him. No blood. No wound. No sign even 
tliat the bedclothes liad been rumpled. No 
contortion of the face, nor the muscles of 
the limbs as one who dies by poison. 

What had done this ? What mysterious 
agency of murder was this, to leave a 
peaceful unmarked corpse which Rolf 
Forrest could take back to Nashville and 
offer for autopsy perlmps, secure that no 
evidence of murder would exist ? As 
though to answer my unspoken question, 
it seemed now that despite the opened 
window and the blast of night air, there 
was a vague smell in the room. A stench? 
A perfume? Indefinable — 

“Dead,” I said gently. The two hor- 
rified girls were staring at me from the 
communicating doorway. I shoved them 
back into Rolf’s room, and closed the door 
on the moonlit scene of death. “We were 
too late, Anne.” 

And what were we to do now? So 
many lurking adversaries here — 

The hall door of Rolf’s little bedroom 


88 


TERROR TAI£S 


still was open. And abruptly all three of 
us stood here in the dim moonlight, frozen 
with a new surge of horror. From out- 
side in the hall there came the sound of 
drs^ing. A slow, labored scraping on the 
hall floor — a sound so grewsomely hor- 
rible that I stood transfixed, lioldkig the 
two juddering girls, and with my breath 
seeming to stidc in my throat, my Kps 
dry. . . . 

The sound stopped. Came again. A 
little louder, as though nearer. Tiny 
muffled thumps, mingled with a dragging 
scrape. Something out there in the hall, 
dragging itself toward «s? 

I was hardly aware that I had moved 
to the door; stood virith the girls huddling 
against me so that we crowded the door- 
way wUh the moonlit room behind us. 
The distant hall was blank darkness, from 
out of whkh the sound was coming. The 
moonlight scrawled past us and laid its 
wan pallid glow on the hall floor in a 
little patch just before our door. Tlie 
blackness was a wall beyond it. Ghasfly, 
approaclung dragging tlmmps, there in 
the blackness. . . . 

With a rush of terror so shocking to 
my senses tliat the grisly scene swam and 
blurred before n-ie, I saw, down by the 
flaer, a head appear. A head of straggling 
long brown hair, \vild and tangled. A 
disembodied head? A face, livid whiter 
contorted with mortal agony — smeared 
with blood — wild ^ring eyes — a mouth 
with parted life like a crimson smear — 

MilGe! For all the noisome horror, I 
was consefous of ray recognition. The 
Groff maid — her disembodied head, hob- 
bling here? No, there was a ghastly throat 
now — and wliite shoulders with the brown 
hair tangled on them. Another dragging, 
labored hitch — I saw now her pitiful body, 
lying on the flow, emerging into the 
moonlight patch as slowly she dragged 
herself, hitchittg on one elbow. 

I tried tb shove Edith and Anne belnnd 


me, but like me they were staring with 
shocked, whirling senses. Millie dragging 
herself here in death agony — lier throat 
a crimson gash, with tlie blood stream- 
ing — draining — 

She saw me now. Her hand tried to 
gesture ; her ^spiiig dying breath, choked 
with blood, was andible — and I was aware 
that I had flung off tlie girls and was 
bending over her. 

“Millie—” 

“He’s — dead. I ju^ fcamd him mur- 
dered — his tltroat cut — like mine. Oh and 
I' — loved him— so much — ” 

“Millie ? Who's dead ? Who murdered 
him ?” 

Her head Iiad faflcn now. The blood 
rattled in her throat. Then other words 
came: 

“He — murdered him — and did for me — 
just now. He’ll murder everybody. He 
is—” 

The words rattled off into the lant 
choldng agony of her death. Her whole 
body twitched for a moment; then lay 
still, her white citeek the floor 

with a spreading crimson stain under if.

in the hall, with slashed throat. And 
some one else was murdered, Millie hod 
said. Some one whose body Millie had 
found lying somewhere here in the dark — 
some man Millie loved. Who was it? 
The fiendish Ludvig? Dr. Emil Groff? 
Or — Rolf Forrest? And who had mur-

turning him into a raging madman so tliat 
now^ he would not stop until he had mur- 
dered us all! 

And I was unarmed. I seized the pallid, 
trcmMing Anne and Edith, shoved them 
through the doorway of the room Anne 
had !teen occupying. It had no cortimuni- 
catii^ door into at^ other room. It was 
smj^, compact. Its single window over- 
looked a sheer drop into the canyon — 
no chance of an assailant coming through 
the window. Barricaded in here we would 
be s^e — 

The bed was a smaU, narrow iron affair. 

A weapon for me? 

Edith gasped: 

“What are you doing?'’ 

“A weapon. Help me.” « 

I tumbled the bedding to the floor. 
Snatched off the mattress. Lifted out the 
spm^s. A jerk, and I had detached from 
its slot one of the iron side rails of the 
frame. It was nearly «evcn feet long; with 
it I could crack tlie head of any orre or 
anything that came near me. 

A frenzied panic for action was upon 
me. I turned to the girls. 

“You lode yourselves in here. There’s 
a telephone near the foot of ffie stairs. 
I’m gping to call for help — the police in 
the nearest to\vn. I won’t be a minute! 
We’ll barricade ourselves in here — ’’ 

Or siiouM we run from the house, out 
to the wind-swept crags? More danger- 
ous inside, or ocrtside? Who could say-— 
yet to me then it seemed that we would 
be safer locked in this room than in the 
open moonlit wildness outside. 

“You lock the door,” I reiterated. 
“Don’t open it unless you hear my voice.” 

They nodded wordlessly. I stood with 
the iron bedrail in my hand, listening as 
they Icwked the door. This silent house! 
The grisly corpse of Millie lay at my feet. 
Brooding black silence everywhere. 
Amazing silence. Edith and Anne had 
screamed at the horrible sight of the dying 


Millie; and certainly I had made enough 
clatter snatching apart the bed. Yet the 
house stood unaroused ; darkly silent. 
Where were all its other occupants ? Two 
maniac girls, still locked, doubtless, in 
their bedroom, up here at the other end of 
the hall. But Rolf Forrest? Mrs. Groff? 
Emil Groff — and Ludvig? One of them, 
Millie had said, was murdered. But the 
others? Where were they now, that my 
commotion had not aroused them? Had, 
they vanislied, like spectres? Or, like Siil- 
lie, were tliey all lyir^ here somewhere — 
murdered? All but one! And that one, 
somewhere here, was lurkiflg. . . . 

From the stairs I could see faint shafts 
of moonlight now dimly illumining the 
lower hall. No one — nothing down there ? 
I stood on the stairs with tlie heavy bed- 
rail poised, straining my hearii^ as 
though by force of wffi I could penetrate 
the silence and hear this monstrous ad- 
versary. At the bottom of the steps I 
stood peering. Wan, eerie patches of 
moonliglit by the windows — and so many 
shadows everywhere, each of which might 
hold the lurking monster. 

There was a little moonlight glow by 
the wall telephone. Witli every muscle 
alert, I went there, rested the heavy iron 
bar beside me and lifted the receiver. Un- 
canny silence of the instrument, like the 
uncanny silence of the house. No buzz 
of current ; no distant operator’s inquiring 
voice. 

And then I saw the cut wires, dangling 
under the box. The fiend had been here. 

I could send no call for h^p. With a 
deepened sense of terror I seized the bed- 
rail and fled back up the stairs. At the 
door of Anne’s room, I rapped. I called 
sliarply : 

"It’s Jack — let me in — " 

And as the words were still echoing, I 
felt my heart contract as though as icy 
hand were clutchihg it. Silence. A silence

TERROR TALES 


so fraught with horrible import that it 
whirled and blurred my senses. 

“Edith! Anne! Let me in! Edith! 
Answer me, Edith — ” 

Silence so horrible. I pounded the door ; 
rattled its ktrob. Then I stepped back- 
ward, half stumbling over the gruesome 
body of Millie — and I lunged with the 
heavy bedrail. The wooden casement that 
held the lock, smashed inward. The door 
swung and 1 went with it. 

^HE little moonlit bedroom was empty. 

The window, locked on the inside, 
was undisturbed, But Edith and Anne 
wwe gone. 

A stark panic descended upon me in 
that terrible moment so that I lunged and 
flung aside the heap of bedding, shoved 
wildly at the bureau as though by some 
diabolic necromancy the two girls might 
still be here, though at a -glance I had 
seen they were not. . . . 

And then I saw where they had gone. 
A panel of the wall showed a narrow 
slit — a. slidir^ door here, which when 
closed was undiscemable. But it was not 
quite closed now. A doorway to some 
descending secret lair? I shoved my fin- 
gers into the vertical opening; the panel 
slid sidewise and I launched myself 
through, brandishing the bedrail. 

I was merely in the adjoining bed- 
room — a duplicate of Anne’s, with a white 
iron bed unmade; moonlight through the 
closed window. No one here. I stooped, 
hurriedly searching. No one. Nothing. 
The room’s single door was ajar; it ad- 
mitted me back into the hall, only a few 
feet from Millie’s body. 

So great a terror was on me now that 
I was hardly conscious of rational reas- 
oning. Where had the fiend taken them? 
Somewhere in this ghastly house — Lud- 
vig, lusting for pleasure; lusting for the 
white beauty of young womanhood. The 
room up here in which the two maniac 


girls were confined ? Had the fiend taken 
Edith and Anne there? Had the maniac 
girls come out and lured them ? 

I dashed to that other door. It still 
was locked. I listened, with ear to its 
panel. No sound! There was only my 
own panting breath and thumping heart. 
With the bedrail, I burst in the door. 

Ghastly scene. Disheveled room of these 
maniac girls. Filmy garments strewn and 
scattered. A place of lusting pleasure, 
mute now with death . . . Death every- 
where in this house. A gust of wind from 
the open window met me. And there was 
enough moonlight glow so that I stood 
gaping at the silent, tragic scene. The 
two maniac girls were here, white bodies 
scantily clothed, hair down. One was 
sprawled on tlie floor with arms up on 
the all of the open window. The other 
was beside her, one arm over her com- 
panion's hip. 

Both of them dead. Unmarked by 
violence. For a moment I stood transfixed, 
peering down at them so pallid in the 
moonlight. And I saw now their slim 
bodies revealed by death to be wasted to 
thinness. Pitiful little creatures. Maniacs 
only with this strange lusting spell which 
had been upon them. Pinched thin cheeks 
under the rouge — bodies in life consumed 
by the fire of their lusts so that now, in 
death, they seemed only pallid wraiths 
of womanhood. And on botii; the con- 
torted faces there was a frozen grimace, 
as though even in death they were trying 
wildly to laugh. 

In that shocked moment, I saw also a 
curious aspect to these death postures. A 
sort of stretching of the necks — gaping, 
stretching mouths—as though the one at 
the window, realizing that death was upon 
her, had staggered here, flung up the sash ; 
and then fallen, and on the floor had again 
reached upward, stretching with her 
mouth for the air too late to save her. 


LAUGH AND DIE! 


91 


Afid the odier, -weaker, had seemed to 
have been dragging herself — 

My mind flung back. That stench? 
That perfume? Indefinable — 

It was here now, widening my nostrils. 
The room was permeated with it, clinging, 
saturating tins carpet, these draperies. For 
all the wind from tlie opened window, I 
smelled it now more strongly than ever 
before. And with every breath I was 
conscious of a Itttle heady thrill to tny 
senses. Gruesome lethal breaths that 
s«med to hold a lure as I suck©! them 
in — a wild pleasure of the senses that 
could only end in death. 

I gathered my wits. Edith and Anne 
were not here. I searched the room — 
peered along the walls for some loose 
panel. And tlten, brandishing the iron 
b^rail, futilely, for there seemed nothing 
but the dead remaming in this terrible 
house, I fled back to the hall. The right- 
angle turn to the left was here, I dashed 
around it. Was that a moving sliape, off 
there m the distaiKe along the Iiall? I 
went with a wild run. No — it was nothing 
but my memory of that shadow I had 
pursued here just before supper. 

I found myself at the head of the back 
stairs. The A)or at the bottom was partly 
open now, with a little moonlight glwing 
behind it. Cautiously I descended. 
Stopped to listen. Only silence here. 

At the iKittom, I shoved the door, But 
it bumped something on the other side- 
something which partly yielded to my 
shov«. The door moved wider, with a 
dim scraping on the floor behind it. Like 
Millie, dragging herself — 

Like MiUie. I pushed myself through 
the door-opening. I was in a small, back 
lower hall with a nearby window ad- 
mitting moonlight. Something was here 
on the floor at my feet — I had shoved and 
moved it vdien I pushed the door. 

Like Millie, Tlw huddled ]5ody of Emil 
Gfoff was lying here, weltering frwn a 


ghastly crimson slash that almost severed 
the throat. 

This charnel house of death. I rose 
erect. I think vaguely I may liave heard 
a sound behind me but it was engulfed 
by a crash on ray sloiU. Tho world seemed 
to split with a roar and a burst of bril- 
liant light so that I was conscious only 
that the faedrail was clattering from my 
hand as 1 fell. 

CHAPTER FIVE 

Orgy of Death 

VWlTH all my senses faded, there was 
for me nothing but a blank abyss of 
empty, soundless darkness. Death itself 
may be like that. But presently, after 
some nameless interval, I was aware that 
I was alive. Dimly conscious, I could 
feel myseli lying on die floor, -with rope 
lashing my -wrists beliiod me and wrapped 
around my ankles. 

My senses faded again, but I struggled 
this time to hold a little something w'hicli 
was Me. In the blackness there w^as the 
sound of a panting breath. The fiend was 
here; I could feel fingers tying the rope 
at my ankles. The fabric of garments 
brushed me. And I could hear the breath- 
ing that was the swift triumph of a frenzy 
aboirt to be consummated. 

Then I was being carried- Half car- 
ried, half dragged, with head and 
shoulders raised and my legs trailing on 
the floor as this gibbering adversary 
tugged and panted with my six-foot bulk. 

And sight dimly was coming to me. 
Vague moonlight. This was the narrow 
back hallway along which I was being 
dragged. A door opened. I -was jerked 
through, tumbled to what seemed the soft- 
ness of a rug. Strange smell here. A 
perfume? Distinctly a perfume now. 
Exotic, aromatic smell, like some powerful 
incense burning here. 

I heard the door slam closed. And at 


92 


TERROR TALES 


my appearance, there had seaned the dim 
blurred sound of a girl’s terrified cry. 
Edith ? Anne ? Memory of them snatched 
my senses to greater alertness. I was 
conscious of a throbbing pain at the back 
of my head; my hair wet and matted, 
doubtless with blood. But the horrible 
weakness was leaving me ; strength 
coming back to my limp muscles ; all my 
confused senses sharpening, clarifying. 

I was in a dimly candlelit apartment, 
draped and shrouded. Heavily carpeted; 
soft chairs ; couches ; wall rugs and hang- 
ings, great splashes of red and black 
velvet. Macabre interior. Paintings on 
the walls, with the flickering candelight 
vaguely disclosing their voluptuous 
nudities. . . . 

A guttural voice at my ear said : 

“Oh, you are not dead. That I hoped.” 

A grim, gibbering chuckle — unlioly 
laugh that had nothing of mirth in it but 
only horror. “Then you sit here and 
watch. You will enjoy this, before you 
die — ” 

I saw above me the leering, malevol- 
ently vile face of Mrs. Groff. Gargoyle 
woman fiend, with her bent thick body, 
like a gorilla of amazing strength. The 
prim black taffeta dress was blood-soaked 
now. She stood shaking, trembling with 
the frenzy of murderous, demoniac 
triumph. 

“You sit here and watch. Beside 
him — ” 

T FELT myself being propped up like a 

bent bundle on the floor, with cushions 
behind me. Another figure was here. 
Ghastly shape, sagging here beside me. I 
turned my head to regard it. Rolf For- 
rest. He sagged here, propped by cush- 
ions so that he could not fall but slumped 
with dangling head against his chest. 
Grisly companion. His face was livid, 
blood-streaked ; blood welled from a 
wound in his side — a great slash which 


had ripped his shirt half from him, ex- 
posing his crimsoned flesh. De^d? No, 
he was still breathing, faint gasping 
breaths of unconsciousness. 

Swift disclosures. No more than half 
a minute had passed since I was flung 
into this I’oom. I heard again that girl's 
cry — and with senses at last fully clari- 
fied, I saw across the long apartment in 
shadows beyond the candlelight, a broad 
couch of black and red drapes. Edith and 
Anne were huddling there. Unharmed, 
save by the extremity of tlieir terror, they 
crouched clinging to each other ; di- 
sheveled, with hair tumbling to their 
shoulders and their clothing half tom 
from them. 

The thick gargoyle shape of Mrs. Groff 
swung away from me, and then came 
back. Maniacal glittering eyes ; gibbering 
unholy laughter ; hideous face so frenzied 
now that it was contorted beyond sem- 
blance of either woman or man so that 
it was only a monster. 

“You two will watch — that will be 
pleasure indeed for us all. Him I did 
not mean to kill — ^not just yet, but he 
nuide me with his %hting — ” 

She leered down at me and young For- 
rest ; then like a gorilla, she swayed away. 
At the wall, where now she stopped for 
a m<Knent, I saw a row of huge upright 
steel cylinders, each tall as a naan, with 
a pressure-gage on top. She opened their 
valves now. In the sudden silence I could 
hear the gas hissing out to mingle with 
the perfume of the incense which drifted 
in a lazy cloud from a brazier on the 
table. 

Then she was at the couch, where Edith 
and Anne lay, pawing at them with quiv- 
ering hands. 

“Oh, you are afraid of me? Little 
beautiful ones — you, so slim and dark — 
and you, pale like white gold — ” 

I tugged frantically, futilely at ray 
bonds. Beside me the dying Rolf twitched 


tAUGH A?^ DIE! 


93 


and Anne shcank back before her claw- 
a litde, as though he too were spurred to 
frenaied eflort. Edith now was scream- 
ing as the vile Img pawed her. 

*Trou are afraid of met You want me 
not to toudi youl But ^is is pleasure, 
little ones. Tlie smgil of pleasure will be 
with us in a moment. You hear it hiss? 
Can’t yoa begin to snidl it now? You 
fed its caress'? You must laugh now and 
be happy. It ts the smell ®f laughter — the 
intoxieadon of Imaghter — the thrill of 
doing -everythmg yrair senses bW you to 
do — and laughing — femghk^— ” 

Raging maniac now. And as I panted, 
jerking at the ropes that lasted me, I 
could fed niy nos^s diiatiug. . . . That 
little heady thrill to my senses with every 
bre^Ir. ... I choked bade a grim laugh. 
Godl Why coaid I laugh wliea horror 
tingled every fiber of me! 

Then the en>oked, gorilla-hag's voice 
rose louder : 

“I^tenl He laughed! We must all 
laughl” Abruptly the caressing tone 
turned to rage* “And stiU you resist me? 
Yon will not lose your seises to the 
pleasures tliat are coming? Because I am 
a woman?” 

Suddeidy the claw-like liands swept up 
to her head. The primly parted liair was 
snatidied away to become a wig, wildly 
flung across the room. This demoniac 
fiend — ^not a woman. I saw his bullet 
head of close-clipped black hair ; and iiow 
with clawing hands he tore away the 
taffeta waist aiid wliite ruching so that 
from under it lus muscular hairy chest 
seemed to burst out, freed of its pinching 
garment. 

“See, my beautiful dear ones — ” He 
stood swaying before the couch, gorilla 
now indeed in every physical aspect. 
“See? The woman you thought m^ is 
gone — Mrs. Groff — gone — never existing, 
I am Ludvig — master of pleasure — master 
of laughter — " 


T>UT the girls were screaming again as 
he readied to dutdi them, Ludvig! 
My half drugged sens« whirled with 
complete realization. This chamal house 
of death — ^we, the living — ^the only sur- 
vivors now — were all gathered here in 
this room of lust. Ludvig! Eftiil Groff’s 
older brother, who masqueraded always 
as the wife of Dr. Emil Groff, to give a 
greater semblance of respectability to this 
supposed sanitorium — to give him also 
a greater freedom wtffi the young girl 
patients who had been admitted here — 
until with the spell of lusting laughter 
upon them, he could dlsdose himself as 
a man. 

TUe^ diabolic sted cylinders? Com- 
pressed oxygen! Diltrted in the air, as 
norraahy we Iweathe h, oxygen is life- 
giving. I think, ill the case of Anne’s 
father,, nstlung but pure oxygen was used, 
We later found the tubes under his bed, 
leading it from tanks at a distant part of 
the house. He had gone to sleep, perhaps 
with a sedative. His window had been 
ordered closed against the storm — and 
then tlift oxygen had been introduced. 

Strange device for murder. An oyw"- 
stimuLHon of the heart, whidi in the old 
man's case, Emil Groff had known would 
certainly kill Irim quickly. And from the 
blood and tissues of sudi a murdered vic- 
tim, the over-charge of pure oxygen 
quickly wiU evapomte so tiiat no autopsy 
can discover the cause of death. 

Unique murder plot. Etnil Groff doubt- 
less had been successful with it many 
times. But the half-mad Ludvig was not 
interested. What diabolic other gases he 
mixed with the oxygen to create in his 
girl victims the lust that enslaved them, 
has never been disclosed, 

I had almost overheard the murder of 
Emil, for unquestionably that quarrel at 
the foot (rf the back stairs had led Ludvig 
to an impulsive slashing of his younger 


94 


TERROR TALES 


brother’s throat. For Litdvig then, the 
die was cast. Whatever vestige of rea- 
son he had ever possessed must have been 
swept into maniacal frenzy then, with his 
brother lying weltering before him, so 
that Ludvig saw only that he must kill 
every one here. With me, perhaps his 
most feared antagonist still alive — ^and 
Edith and Anne still with me — ^his twist- 
ed brain must have told him to hide the 
evidence of the gas, so that he crept 
through the wall panel with which most 
of these rooms were equipped, opened old 
Mr. Forrest’s window, and verified that 
the old man was dead. 

And with each ghastly murder Lud- 
vig’s frenzy was telling him that he was 
nearing undisturbed possession of Anne 
and Edith. The culmination of his unholy 
lusts now was at hand. The dim candle- 
lit room here had once been a storeroom 
back of the kitchen — equipped by Ludvig 
for the lair of his orgies. And he was 
laughing now, with his triumph so near. 

"You feel it now, little white beauties? 
You breathe its thrill? Intoxicating pleas- 
ure — ” 

And I could feel it now, more over- 
whelming with every breath. A thriUing, 
exultant pound of my heart. A wild sense 
of power. Desires stirring in me — an in- 
toxication of the senses — a falling away 
of shackles of restraint which always be- 
fore had been upon me and my animal 
desires — 

God! Was I laughing? Was that 
Edith’s wild laiigh of intoxication ringing 
out mingled with her half-choked screams 
of horror? I saw the hideous monstrous 
form of the half clothed Ludvig reaching 
across the couch — the white, intoxicated, 
shuddering girls — 

ITH all the pounding wildness of 
my new-found strength, still the 
THE 


damnable rope was holding me. My 
lunges bumped the Wood-soaked body of 
Rolf Forrest. He slumped against me. 
His contorted face twitched — not quite 
dead, for the oxygen was bringing a last 
little strength to hold death away a mo- 
ment Icmger. 

And what was this ? Rolf’s almost va- 
cant eyes imploring me? A little twitch 
at my lashed wrists behind me! His dy- 
ing, twitching fingers with a little stimu- 
lated strength in tltem, plucking at my 
bonds! His numbing brain with death 
creeping into it, still could direct his 
twitching fingers — 

Then the death rattle was in his throat ; 
a shudder swept him — a twitching, and 
then he slumped and fell forward on his 
face and lay motionless. 

I jerked and found that my arms were 
free. I fumbled at my ankles, tast off the 
last of the rope and sprang erect. Ludvig 
did not see me as I bounded the twenty 
feet across the heavy red carpet. He was 
sprawled . forward on the couch, laugii- 
ing, pawing. 

With a last bound, like a pouncing ani- 
mal I was on him — ^lifting his hideous, 
vile little body with all the amazing power 
of my intoxicated strength, so that I 
shook him as though he were a gigantic 
rat and whirled and pounded his gargoyle 
head aginst the nearest of the steel cyl- 
inders. Pounded— and laughed with my 
own wild unholy laughter until his head 
cracked — and I cast him dead upon the 
floor. 

“Edith! Anne — come — ” 

With my arms around them, we ran, 
slamming the door upon the ghastly 
room. And up in the house I wrapped 
their shuddering bodies in blankets, and 
we sat through the night, waiting for the 
dawn.

close-spaced eyes, which were bright and 
ophidian in their fixity. His wrists and 
hands, covered with tlie dry scales and 
thrusting from his pajama sleeves, were 
like broad-headed serpents nesting in the 
bed linen. 

Mary Bellam had told Stanley that-her 
Uncle John Bellam, owner of Bellam’s 
Greater Circus, was recovering from a 
skin disorder, but the warning had not 
prepared the. young lawyer for anything 
like this. He must have shuddered, for 
Mary’s warm hands tightened reassur- 
ingly upon his arm. 

“Mary has chosen well.” The words 
hissed from Bellam’s lips. His cold eyes 
moved slowly from Stanley’s polished 
shoes to the strong breadth of his shoul- 
ders, the firm set of his well-slaaped head. 
Bellajn moved one hand, the long, scaled 
fingers coiling palmward, and the brown 
hair prickled along the back of Stanley’s 
necl<. "I wish you both great happiness.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Bellam !” Impulsively, 
Stanley’s right hand thrust forward and 
he took another step toward the bed ; then 
horror chilled him as Mary clutched fran- 
tically at his arm. 

“Stan! No!” Her voice was a terri- 
fied wail. 

“Don’t touch me !” John Bellam re- 
coiled with the swiftness of a serptent. 
“You might — ” Abruptly, his thin body 
relaxed. "Sorry to frighten you, but 
we’re not sure about — ^this.” His right 
hand slid across his chest, moving with 
the slow grace of a reptile. “Bellam’s 
Greater Circus specializes in giant py- 
thons and boas. I have always loved 
snakes. Since this happened a month ago, 
I’ve wondered if handling the big snakes 
could have — ” 

He stopped as the door behind Stanley 
and Mary opened. 

Stanley turned, and gulped as a squat, 
misshapen man waddled into the room. 
The man’s big eyes, bulging almost level 


with jutting brows, slid over him, then 
flicked to the bed. He was strangely 
nervous and frightened. 

“You call, Misser Bdla’?” His voice 
was a throaty croak. 

“No.” Bellam’s tongue darted out to 
moisten pale lips. “Mr. Austin, this is 
Shagar. He was my snake-man until a 
maddened python attacked him.” Bellam’s 
glittering eyes seemed to mock the squat 
figure beside the bed. “Shagar hates 
snakes. Oddly, he believes I am becom- 
ing a giant python.” Bellam’s rustling 
chuckle made Stanley’s scalp tighten. “I 
believe Shagar hates me for — ” 

“I — ^I — ” Shagar’s gnarled fingers 
clasped nervously. His bulging eyes 
darted fearfully about the room, and Stan- 
ley saw terror in their colorless depths. 
“I hate snake! I no hate you, Misser — ” 
“Enough.” Bellam’s hand lifted, a 
scaled reptile rearing its broad, flat head. 
“Mary, you, Elbert Weiss and Shagar are 
circus folks; you have cared for me in 
spite of this. Therefore I shall make ar- 
rangements to leave each of you a third 
interest in Bellam’s Greater Circus. I shall 
be dead within the week.” 

“Uncle John!” Stanley felt Mary’s slim 
body quiver against him. 

“You shotddn’t permit yourself, Mr. 
Bellam, to — ” he began uncomfortably. 

“I shan’t.” Bellam’s bright eyes slitted, 
and Stanley felt a chill feeling that was 
half fear creep through his veins. “I 
regret dying, a human, and tamely in 
bed.” Bellam’s glittering eyes seemed to 
stare through and beyond the three be- 
side the bed. “I’d prefer the swift death 
of the jungle — ^the stunning impact of a 
lightning thrust from overhanging branch- 
es — the anasthesia of fear! Then coil 
after coil of steel-cabled body — ” - 
“Please!” Near-hysteria sharpened 
Mary’s voice. 

"Your pardon, Mary.” Suddenly Bel-

lam’s voice was mild and lulling. “Where 
is Elbert, Shagar?” 

“He — he go see dog.” The snake-man’s 
twisted body seemed to shrink. 

“Dog?” 

“Something ketch dog back of cottage.” 
Shagar said, squirming nervously, his 
bulging eyes wide with terror. “It — it 
squeeze dog — dead.” His voice dropped 
to a terrified whisper. “It kill like big 
python t” 

“Python!” Breath whistled shrilly from 
Bellam’s slitted nostrils. Soul-wracking 
fear froze his thin, scaled features, and 
his voice was the voice of a damned be- 
ing. “Merciful God, have I already — ” 

“Hello, everybody !” 

The nasal voice came from behind Stan- 
ley. He swung about and saw a well-built 
man of about thirty standing in the open 
doorway. The newcomer was tall and 
muscular, and his sleek hair glistened in 
the afternoon light coming from the open 
front door at the end of the hall. 

“Oh, pardon me.” His black eyes ap- 
praised Stanley. “Didn’t know we had 
company.” 

“Mr. Weiss, this is Stan — Stanley Aus- 
tin,” Mary said, and clung tightly to Stan- 
ley’s arm. 

“Congrats and all that, Stan. You’re 
lucky.” The pressure of Weiss’ hand upon 
Stanley’s was quick and strong. “Next 
Thursday, so Mary says. She’s a prize, 
but I’m warning you — ^you’re marrying 
into a circus crowd. Of course, I’m not 
really one of the family, but — ” 

“Certainly you are, Elbert!” said Bel- 
lam as his pale lips bared long, fanglike 
teeth in a fond smrle. “You’ve been with 
me for years, and you’ll share equally 
with Mary and Shagar in the Circus after 
I’m gone. We — ” 

“Thanks, Mr. Bellam. But let’s not 
talk about your — going.” Weiss stepped 
to the bed, clasping long-fingered hands 
behind his back. His black eyes darted 


to Shagar’s twisted figure. “Shagar told 
you about the dog, eh ?” 

“Elbert! Is it true? Was the animal 
really — ” Bellam had risen to a sitting 
position and his close-spaced eyes were 
filled with stark terror. 

“It was.” Weiss’ eyes lifted from Bel- 
lam’s scaled body, and Stanley saw his 
lips tighten. “The dog was crushed — ap- 
parently by a huge snake; but that, of 
course, is impossible. A boa, anaconda or 
a python couldn’t live in this mouittain 
climate. It — ” He snapped long fingers. 
“I almost forgot. We’re going to have 
more company. I saw Herman Kelley’s 
big red car coming up the road. He’s 
probably after Bellam’s Circus again. Con- 
solidating Kelley’s and Bellam’s would 
make the biggest combination in — ” 

“If that scoundrel — ” Bellam’s slitted 
eyes were flaming with hate. 

“Hi! Anybody home?” The big voice 
boomed through the cottage. The screen 
door banged and heavy feet stamped 
toward the bedroom. "Hi, Elbert ! You 
get puttier and puttier, Mary ! Hi, John !” 

Stanley didn't have to be told that the 
heavy-jowled giant barging into the bed- 
room was Herman Kelley, owner of Kel- 
ley’s Shows. 

“Heard you was sick, John, so I come 
to see you.” Kelley’s big feet slapped the 
floor toward the bed. His little, piggish 
eyes swept Stanley from head to foot. 
Mary introduced them. "Glad to know 
any guy Mary knows.” Kelley grinned 
and turned to the bed. "Now, John — ” 
“Herman Kelley !” The words spat 
from Bellam’s lips. He drew away from 
the rival show owner like a snake settling 
to strike. “If you’ve come up here to — ” 
“Easy, John,” said Kelley, spreading a 
beefy hand. "My show’s playing Maxton, 
four miles over the hills. I heard you was 
sick, so I come over to — ” Abruptly, Kel- 
ley’s heavy jaw dropped and he backed

away from the bed. “Holy cats, John! 
Yon got acales like a snake !” 

“Uncle John has malignant eczema.” 
Mary spc^e kid^naafly as she left Stan- 
ley Md moved toward the bed, her curly 
bkmd head high. “He is m no condition 
to discuM — ” 

“Okay. ^cay. It — it just gimme a 
turn seeing them scales.” Kdley mopped 
at his beefy face with a pur^-edged 
handkenchief. “I— I been catching hell 
with snakes latdy. Bought some boas and 
pythons from a busted show and the 
damn' worms been driving me nats. The 
biggest python got away in Maxton.” 

"Got away!” Mary screamed in a way 
that made Stanley's teeth dick together. 
“Then the dog was — ” 

“You — you’re bunting for the snake?” 
The wwds pushed from Stanley’s tight 
throat. The crushed dog — ^perhaps a 
crushed liuman nex^— His eyes sought 
Mary’s trim blond figure, and a shudder 
rippled through his body. 

“Hunting it, heWf’ Kelley snorted. “I 
should delay the show and waste a thou- 
sand bucks for a fifty-dollar worm! The 
damn* thing can’t live in these mountaoie. 
It brfongs to the guy who finds it I” 

Then a grin split Kelley’s red face, yet 
his keen little eyes watched Bellani’s every 
move. “How ’bout five grand over my 
last offer for Bellam’s Cireus? You’re 
laid up and there ain't no telling how — ” 

“Get outJ” Bellam’s sharp hiss drove 
the larger man back. Kelley barged to 
the door, then stopped, turned and leveled 
a diick finger. 

“You might jest's well sell me the show, 
John,'’ he boomed, pigKke eyes narrowed. 
“I'il get it — sooner or later!” 

'Ilieu Kelley was gone, his heavy feet 
pounding out of the cottage. 

tfiTpHERE'S the dpg;'* 

Elbert Weiss, slightly ahead of 
Stanley Austin and Shagar, pointed 


through the thin growth of pines and un- 
derbrush in the narrow ^-alley behind the 
mountain cottage. Two strides of Stan- 
ley’s long legs brought him beside Elbert. 
Shagar waddled at the lawyer’s heels. 

Directly before the three men a shape- 
less bundle of brownish-gray fur huddled 
upon the needle-carpeted ground Bright 
afternoon sun sifted through the trees and 
splashed the ghastly object with shafts of 
l^ht. 

Elbert moved toward the thing. Stan- 
ley follow^. 

He could hear Shagar waddling behind 
him. ITte twisted snake-man was mutter- 
ing viciously beneath his breath. They 
reached the crushed carcass, and a strange 
mingfing of nausea and fear gripped Stan- 
ley Austin. 

Tlie animal had been a well-developed 
German poEce dog. Now it was but a 
horribly shapeless mass ©f blood-dotted 
fiir. A throaty croak made Stanley’s scalp 
tighten before he realized the sound was 
coming frexn Shagar. The crippled snake- 
man was staring down at the crushed dog, 
his bulging eyes glazed with horror. 

“Python do that.” A shudder twitched 
Shagar's squat, misshapen body. “ 'Most 
do me like that. Misser Bella' watch. 
Laugh like he glad I hurt. He been 
punch snake, make him mad. He hate 
me.” Shagar's croaking voice went shrill. 
“He like to kill me. Misser Bella’ talk 
to snake, tell him to squeeze me. Snake 
talk to him, hiss. Misser Bella’ always 
half-sndce. He be all snake quick! He 
ketch me — do me like — that ! He squeeze 
me — squeeze more people like — ” 

"Nonsense, Shagar!” Elbert Weiss’ 
laugh was strained. He wetted his lips 
nervously, “Forget the crazy stuff.” He 
seemed fordbly tq tear his black eyes 
from the dog’s crushed body. “We've got 
to get that python. You take the other 
side of the vaHey. You know what to do. 
Stanley, you'd better go to the little clear- 


EMBRACE OF THE PYTHON

ing about a quarter -mile down the valley. 
If the python comes near you, sing out. 
Shagar and I’ll be witli you in two min- 
utes. I’m going up the valley and work 
back. We ought to have a few more men, 
but — Well, let’s go.” 

Elbert stalked off through the trees, 
heading toward the left. 

Still muttering, Shagar waddled past 
the dog's carcass and headed across the 
valley. Stanley could hear him slipping 
on the pine needles after his twisted fig- 
ure had disappeared behind the trees. The 
young lawyer started down the valley, his 
muscular fingers tight about the short club 
he had picked up near the cottage. 

Elbert had said the python would be 
unlikely to measure over eighteen feet, 
and it would undoubtedly be sluggish, 
half-dormant. Yet — 

A tight smile touched Stanley’s firm 
lips as he moved forward cautiously, 
brown eyes probing the trees and brush 
about him. 

The pines thinned and disappeared after 
he had walked a few moments. Stanley 
was coming into a small, irregular clear- 
ing, rimmed with the scrubby trees and 
underbrush. Afternoon sunlight made the 
place look almost cheery, yet strange 
thoughts thrust into Stanley’s mind. 

Was John Bellam actually being trans- 
formed into a reptile ? Were those ghastly 
scales upon his skin but a forerunner of 
the horror to come? Had Bellam, as Sha- 
gar charged, deliberately prodded the py- 
thon into attacking the snake-man? Could 
the strangely reptilian circus owner actu- 
ally talk with snakes, speak their hissing 
language? Had the police dc^ been at- 
tacked by tlie python that liad escaped 
from Kelley’s Shows, or had it been 
crushed by — ^John Bellam — whose thin, 
scaled body was snakelike in its — ■ 

A derisive laugh burst from Stanly’s 
lips. 

He was letting the queer happenings 


break his nerve. The whole thing was 
sane enough — just a skin disease, a crip- 
pled and half-mad snake-man and an es- 
caped python. Yet — 

Underbrush rustled nearby, and every 
muscle in his bbdy snapped taut. His fin- 
gers went white about the short club. 
Bleak with a sudden, almost numbing 
fear, his brown eyes probed between the 
surrounding trees. A slight movement 
caught his eyes, then a small bird darted 
up from the ground. The lawyer relaxed, 
and grunted as he realized that the mus- 
cles of fais jaws ached. 

Resolutely, he started to whistle, but he 
stopped as he recalled reading somewhere 
that reptiles were peculiarly steceptible to 
shrill noises. 

Damn circuses and snakes! After he 
and Mary were married — 

Sudden horror held Stanley motion- 
less, and the abrupt poimding of his heart 
all but drowned the shrill scream ringing 
in the narrow, wooded valley. 

It was the terrified scream of a man in 
the maddening throes of infinite agony. 
It came again. 

Stanley stood rigid. The cry was com- 
ing from the r^t side of the valley. It 
knifed his eardrums again, dien stopped, 
choking short with a gurgling moan. For 
a moment the valley was gripped in awful 
silence. Then Stanley heard a heavy body 
breaking through the brush to his left. 

“Shagar! Weiss!” His voice sounded 
queer — shrill in his ears. He broke into 
a stumbling run toward the sound, his 
fingers glued to the short club in his right 
hand. Swaying tree branches plucked at 
his clothing. Underbrush whipped at his 
legs. Yet he stumbled on, the horrible cry 
still echoing in his brain. 

After a few moments he stopped, every 
faculty concentrated on listening. The 
noise of breakii^ brush had ceased, and 
there was no sound but the throb of blood 
in his ears, the eerie whisper of wind in 


100 


TERROR TALES 


the trees about him. He moved forward 
cautiously, his aching eyes probing the 
brush. 

A shapeless mass upon the ground some 
distance ahead drew his gaze like a mag- 
net. Cold horror swelled in his brain, 
waves of *ausea swept over him and the 
dread certainty that the shape was human 
grew in his mind. Gritting hie teeth to 
steady jerking nerves, he forced himself 
toward the ghastly shape. 

It was a man — a man whose body was 
crusted into a mocking travesty of a 
human form. There were no definable 
outlines to the horribly shapeless mass. It 
was but a ghastly huddle of crushed flesh, 
bone and btood-soaked clothing. 

Controlling himself with an effort, 
Staidey forced himself to examine the 
thing. It was Shagar, the crippled snake- 
man. Shad’s features were bloated. His 
colorless eyes had burst from their sockets 
— horrible globes pendant from red veins 
and muscles. Trickles of blood streaked 
his cheeks. His mouth was fixed in a 
grimace of agony. The side of his head 
was bruised. His body was a blood-seep- 
ing pulp. John Bellara’s mad words 
flashed into Stanley’s diilled mind as he 
stared down at the crushed snake-man. 

‘The stunning impact of a lightning 
thrust from overhanging branches, the 
anesthesia of fear! Then coil after coil 
of steel-cabled body — ” 

Stanley spun, his right fist white about 
the short dub, a>ld prickles racing along 
his spine. 

OOI^ETHING had moved in the trees 
^ behind him. He heard it again, then 
saw the figure of a man coming through 
the underbrush. 

“Stanly I Shagar !” cried Elbert Weiss. 
He broke from the trees and ran toward 
Stanley, his face deathly pale. "My God, 
Stanleyl I’m glad you’re unhurt! 1 
heard — 


He saw Shagar’s crushed body behind 
the young lawyer and his black eyes went 
wide, filled with horror. 

"It — it — ^got Shagar! I was afraid it 
was you. I — ” He raked sweat from his 
forehead with shaking fingers. “I — ” 

He stopped, froze into an attitude of 
listening, then Stanley heard some one 
l^owing through tlie brush toward them. 

“Hil ElbertI Shagar!” shouted Her- 
man Kelley’s big voice. In a moment the 
heavy-jowl«i showman came into sight, 
his b% body crashing toward them. 
"Heard a gosh-awful screech aud thought 
mebbe I'd better see what's what. You got 
any id«i what—" 

Then Kelley saw Shagar's pulped body. 

“Holy God !" His voice was but a hoarse 
croak. "The pytlion — ” 

“Your python!" Elbert Weiss’ voice 
was brittle. 

"My python, hell! I give the snake to 
John!" Kelley whipped about with sur- 
prising swiftness and gripped Stanley 
Austin's arm. "You \vas a witness, Aus- 
tin! You got to say I give the snake to 
John! I ain’t responsible for — this!” His 
bulging eyes fought clear of Shagar’s 
crushed figure, 

“How'd you happen to come up here?” 
Swift tljoughts clicked in Stanley's mind. 

"You can’t pull me in on this!" roared 
Kelley, big hands clenching. “I left the 
cottage, stopped at the store and talked a 
bit.” 

"Miss Mary come in and I left, started 
across the valley in my car. Then I heard 
the screech and come up and — ’’ 

"You saw Mary Bellam at the store!" 
'The words exploded from Stanley's lips. 

“Sure. She musta come down after 
something. It ain’t but a half-mile from 
the cottage to — " Kelley stalled, bulging 
eyes following Stanley as the young law- 
yer whipped past him, moving with a 
swift, ground-eatihg stride. "What— 
Where you — ’’ 


EMBRACE OF THE PYTHON 


101 


"To tlie cottage!” Stanley flung the 
words over his shoulder. "John Bellam’s 
up there alone, and Mary’s out where that 
python can attack her 1” 

He increased his pace to a run, heard 
Kelley and Weiss pounding after him. 

Reaching the cottage, Stanley crossed 
the front porch, legs stiff, cold horror 
gnawing at his heart. The place was quiet 
with a queerly sinister silence. Kelley and 
Weiss burst from the trees about the cot- 
tage and trotted toward the porch. 

"Mary ! Mr. Bellam !” 

The silent, empty cottage seemed to 
engulf Stanley’s call. There was no an- 
swering sound. He pushed through the 
open doorway, striding toward the door 
to the Bellam’s room. He heard Weiss 
and Kelley on the front porch. 

Bellam’s room door was open, and Stan- 
ley saw the bed at the first glance. It 
was empty, the covers thrown back. There 
was no sign of Bellam’s thin, scaled fig- 
ure. Mad thoughts churned in Stanley’s 
mind. 

"We got to get together on this thing, 
Elbert I” Kelley’s bull voice drifted in 
from the porch, Weiss’ nasal tones an- 
swered. 

"It's now a case of getting — ” Weiss 
stopped, then his voice was shrill and 
high. "There’s Mary now, coming up 
tlie — ” 

Stanley reached the front door as the 
car neared the cottage. Kelley and Weiss 
were running toward the road. Mary Bel- 
lam seemed lost behind the wheel of the 
big sedan. Her blue eyes went big and 
frightened as she braked the car to a stop. 
Weiss and Kelley crowded to the opened 
left window. Stanley strode across the 
porch, ran toward the car. 

"Why did you leave Mr. Bellam?” El- 
bert Weiss was reaching for the door 
handle. Stanley caught his arm and pulled 
him away. 

"You heard me give the damn’ snake to 


John, Mary !” Kelley’s big head was thrust 
through the opened window. "You got 
to witness.” Stanley’s muscular hand 
upon his shoulder stopped him. The 
yotmg lawyer pulled Kelley away from 
the car. 

"Take it easy, you two!” 

"Stan! Something terrible has hap- 
pened!” Mary’s slim hands were warm on 
Stanley’s wrist. "Uncle John sent me to 
the store for cigars. Something has hap- 
pened to him! Tell me, Stan!” 

She pushed the car door open and 
stepped to the road, frightened eyes seek- 
ing the cottage door. 

"Bellam’s gone!” blurted EIb«t Weiss, 
long fingers clasping nervously. "The py- 
thon killed Shagar!” 

"Oh !” Mary swayed against Stanley. A 
dry sob choked in her throat. 

"Weiss,” said Stanley as his arm tight- 
ened about Mary’s quivering shoulders, 
"suppose you take the car and notify the 
Sheriff and coroner.” 

"Coroner, hell 1” bellowed Kelley. "We 
don’t want law in this yet! We’ll find 
Bellam and the python, then holler cop. 
ril get a gang of show-hands.” 

Before either Stanley or Weiss could 
stop him, Kelley was in the Bellam sedan 
and had it swinging about, heading down 
the valley in a cloud of dust. 

"Why, the dirty — ” Burning anger 
flamed in Elbert Weiss’ black eyes as he 
stared at the speeding car. 

A deep frown creased Austin’s broad 
forehead and his lips tightened grimly as 
he watched the sedan disappear around a 
turn. 

Herman Kelley was after Bellam’s 
Greater Circus. He had been in the valley 
when Shagar screamed. Could the beefy 
showman have planned to murder all but 
one of Bellam’s heirs before killing Bel- 
lam himself, then buy the show from the 
survivor ? Kelley didn’t want the police — 
yet. Could that mean he was using his 


102 


TERROR TALES 


supposed trip to Maxton £or show-hands 
as atover for another murder? Was John 
Bellam alive, or had Kelley watched the 
cottage, waited untU Bdlam was alone, 
then — 

“Elbert ! Austin !” 

TTie faint cry was coming from the 
narrow valley behind the mountain cot- 
tage, ^d the eerie tones seemed to pluck 
with chill fingers at Stanley’s nerves. 

"It — it’s Uncle John!” Mary Bellam’s 
clutching fingers dug into Stanley’s arm. 

Elbert^ Weiss was already running 
toward the sound. Stanley started after 
him, Mary dragging at his arm, and as 
they sped toward the narrow, wooded val- 
ley behind die cottage, a dread certainty 
grew in Starfey’s mind. Each one of 
these strange happenings was but part of 
a mad plan. Each incident was leading to 
a hideous, death-filled climax. 

“Mr. Bellam!” 

He heard Elbert Weiss running through 
the brush ahead. Mary was stumbling, 
panting at hife side. 

“Stanley! Elbert!” 

John Bellam’s shrill cry came from 
di^tiy to the left. Stanley clianged his 
course, foUowii^ Elbert Weiss, helping 
Mary through the entangling underbrush. 

Then they saw the tliin, pajama-clad 
figure of John Bellam ahead through the 
trees, and Stanley thought of a horrible, 
half-reptile creature wandering in the 
wooded valley. 

T^HEY reached the circus owner, and 
again revulsion swept over Stanley 
Austin as he looked at the dry, scale-like 
flakes of dead cuticle on Bellam’s skin. A 
queer tightening came into the young law- 
yer’s body. 

“Something has happened to Shagar!” 
Bellani’s narrow head thrust forward — as 
he hissed the words the head of a scaled 
reptile upon a thin, upright body. “I 
heard him scream ! It was like his scream 


when he was attacked by tlie python!” 
Bdkm pawed at his narrow forehead, and 
the dry rasp of scales sent prickles of 
horror through Stanley’s tight scalp. “Cir- 
cus £dks feel death.” Bellam’s ophidian 
eyes were unnaturally bright and uiiwink- 
iug. “I knovif Shagar is dead!” His thin 
body swayed, a queer, sinuous movement. 
“Take me to his body.” 

Stanley Austin felt the hair rising upon 
his head. 

Bellam had sent Mary away from the 
cottage. He had been alone. He hated 
Shagar, had — according to the crippled 
snake-man — prodded a python into attack- 
ing him before. BcIImi could have slipped 
from the cottage, crossed the valley and 
— Stanley shuddered. Shagar liad said 
Bellam was half-snake, could talk the hiss- 
ing language of serpents. Shagar had pre- 
dicted his own death in the crushing coils 
of a snake! He had said that Bellam 
would be that serpent. Had the crippled 
snake-man possessed some horrible, secret 
knowledge about John Bellam? Had he 
been crushed because of that knowledge ? 

“Take me to Shagar.” 

John Bellam’s tlim figure weaved in a 
loathswne, serpentine movement. His 
sharp tongue licked pale lips avidly. A 
queer, hungry gleam burned in his un- 
winking eyes. His cold, fixed stare fas- 
tened upon Elbert Weiss. 

“Take me to Shagar, Elbert,” he com- 
manded hissingly. 

Weiss lifted muscular shoulders in an 
expressive shrug, turned and started off 
through the trees, heading for the spot 
where Stanley had found the crippled 
snake-man’s horribly crushed body. 

Muscles hard with a strange tautness, 
Stanley followed. Mary walked at his 
side, her trembling hands clutching his 
arm. 

The sinking sun painted darkening 
shadows in the narrow vaHey. A slight 
evening breeze had started, and faint, 


EMBRACE OF THE -PYTHON 


103 


eerie whispers drifted through the trees-— 
Stanley stopped, warned by something 
he could not define. Quickening blood 
pumped in his ears. His lips felt parched 
and dry. His right hand clenched — then 
he remembered he had dropped his short 
club near the cottage. Beside him, Mary 
Bellam stood stiffly, her frightened breath 
shrill in his ears. He could feel her slim 
figure trembling against him. His bleak 
eyes probed the trees ahead. Then the 
something which had warned him became 
apparent. Elbert Weiss and John Bel- 
lamys thin, pajama-clad figure were no- 
where in sight. No sound came from the 
trees and brush ahead. 

Slowly, Stanley moved forward, fingers 
knotted into hard fists. Mary walked at 
his side, held silent by his tenseness. As 
they passed a low mass of brush Stanley 
heard a furtive rustle behind him. 

Chilled breath stopped in his throat. 
The skin of his back crawled with sud- 
den, numbing horror, and John Bellam’s 
strange words flashed into his mind. 

“The stunning impact of a lightning 
thrust from overhanging branches, the 
anesthesia of fear! Then coil after coil 
of steel-cabled body — ” 

Instinctively he pushed Mary away 
from him and svmng about, his fists knot- 
ted. Half-way around he was aware of 
a vague something lashing out from the 
brush. A smashing weight crashed into 
the side of his head. 

Lights flamed within his skull. Mary’s 
terrified scream reached his ears, seem- 
ing to come from an incredible distance. 
A sable pall tightened about him. 

Something hard and round encircled his 
body, yet he couldn’t move, couldn’t 
scream the terror swelling in his lungs. 
Merciful unconsciousness engulfed him. 

CTANLEY AUSTIN became aware of 
a strange, acrid smell, a nerve-tighten- 
ing odor that had a rank, corrosive qual- 


ity about it. It was somehow unutterably 
slimy and unclean. Then abruptiy he 
knew what it was — the nauseous stench 
of reptiles ! 

His eyes snapped open and a startled 
cry ruslied to his lips, and stopped. He 
was gagged, bound hand and foot, and 
lying upon the rough stone floor of a 
large cave. To his right, he could see 
Mary Bellam’s slim figure. The girl was 
also bound, and a gag bit into the soft 
flesh of her cheeks. She was unconscious, 
her eyes closed. 

Still dazed by the blow upon his head, 
Stanley looked about him. 

Farther toward the back of the cavern 
was a queer structure of heavy beams and 
coils of heavy, hawser-like rope. He saw 
a powerful hydraulic jack. The shadowy 
figure of a man was crouched behind the 
crude machine. Stanley’s eyes swept past 
the man, drawn irresistibly toward the 
back of the cave, then the noisome gag 
between his teeth flung back the scream of 
horror that tried to burst from his tight 
lungs. 

The dusky shadows at the back of the 
cavern held the coiled bulk of a giant 
python ! 

He could see the sinuous coils of its 
huge, scaled body, the blynt triangle of its 
head. Its eyes made tiny points of light 
in the shadows. It seemed dormant. Yet 
there was a certain pulsing of life about 
the giant bulk. 

Stanley’s eyes swung back to the 
crouched shape of the man, the crude ma- 
chine, and the hideous solution of the 
whole mad scheme burst like a blinding 
flame within his brain. He knew now the 
purpose of the ropes and beams, knew the 
identity of the kneeling man. 

A ghastly vision of Shagar’s crushed 
body swam before his eyes. He knew now 
why he and Mary had been brought to 
this cavern. 

Frantically, he tried to burst free of the 


104 


TERROR TALES 


ropes about his wrists. Warm blood 
crawled upon his skin as the rough hemp 
bit into his flesh. 

He saw now that a man’s head thrust 
above the coils of hawser-Hke rope be- 
tween the heavy beams. The features 
were all but obscured by the thick folds of 
a gag, yet Stanley knew who it was — 
John Bellam! 

Stanley threw every ounce of his 
strength into straining against the ropes, 
but they held fast. A groan of despair 
forced from his tiglit lips. 

Warned by the sound, the figure 
crouched beltmd the machine straightened, 
turned. Stanley knew his identic before 
he rose. It was Elbert Weiss. 

^‘Wdll. Well. Mary’s brave lover is 
awake.” A hacking laugh rasped from 
Weis* leering mouth. “KeUey ^id his 
show-l^ds \^1 find plenty whai they 
come back.” 

Weiss bent, released the big hydraulic 
jack, and the thick ropes about Bellam’s 
thin figure loosened. He pulled the sliape- 
less mass that had been Bellam’s body 
from the madiine, flung it over his shoul- 
der and stalked toward the front of the 
cave. “Ttey’ll find Bellam and you 
crashed by the 'python’ and they’ll find 
Mary’s body in the coils of my prize 
beauty ?” He jerked his head tovrard the 
rear of the cave. “I will own Bellam's 
Circus. In a few months Kelley and I 
will consolidate — the Greatest and Big- 
gest Siiow <m Earth, and I'll own half of 
it!” 

Chuckling throatily, Weiss strode out 
of the cave, carrying Bellam’s crushed 
figure. 

Stanley tore at the ropes about his 
wrists, a rising sense of defeat beating at 
his mind. Bellam was already dead, 
crushed in the liydraulic maeWne. He and 
Mary would be next. Grinding his teeth 
into the wadded cloth in his moutti, Stan- 


ley tried to push the gag free, tried to 
shout. Then he heard Weiss returning. 

“It's my turn now. Miss Bellam!” 

Weiss stalked to Mary’s bound figure 
and stared down at her, black eyes flam- 
ing with mad hate. Mary's eyes snapped 
open, filled with terror as she saw him. 

“You’ve looked on me as a bum and a 
common circus Imnd ever since I’ve been 
wth Bellam’s, You’ve always avoided me, 
but you can’t now.” Weiss’ voice dripped 
venom. “Within ten minutes, you’ll be 
dead and I’ll own Bellam’s Show. Shagar 
was easy. He died without a struggle in 
my machine, but I’m saving the live snake 
for you. Miss Bellam! I’ll watch and 
laugh as It crushes you. Your lover can 
watch too, but he won't laugh. He’ll be 
fighting the ropes in my mechanical py- 
thon I After you two are dead, I'll put 
you and the python in the vaJley for Kel- 
ley and his men to find. I'll be at the 
other end of the valley, hunting for you.” 

Picking the girl from the floor, Weiss 
carried her to the back of the cavern, 
dropped her upon the coiled python and 
stepped back, a mad, snarling laugh bub- 
Wing from his lips. 

The huge serpent’s angry hiss filled the 
cave, and Stanley’s eyes widened with hor- 
ror as he saw the deadly mottled body 
sliding about Mary, enfolding her in its 
ghastly embrace. 

The young lawyer exploded in a mad 
effort to burst the ropes about his hands, 
dropped back aS his tortured muscles re- 
belled under the strain. The pj'thon had 
looped two coils about Mary's slim fig- 
ure, one about her waist, the other abotrt 
the fresh plumpness of her breasts. The 
girl was paralyzed with terror — the anes- 
thesia of fear. 

Stanley tried to jerk erect, and a sharp 
projection of rock beneath him gouged 
into his pressing hands, cutting the flesh. 
Abruptly, he stiffened and new hope 
flashed into his mind. Feverishly, he

latruned his bound wrists on the sliarp 
rock, and a sob caught in his throat as 
the benrp snagged on the projection. In 
less than a raimite several strands of the 
rope had parted. 

Weiss was standing near the pjrthon, 
unholy ndcrest glraming in hfe black eyes 
as he watched the snake cotlitig about the 
girl. The serpent’s mottled body wtis 
waving slowly about Mary. One coif 
had trapped her anWes, another cMitracterf 
aboul tier thighs. Even as Stanfey stared, 
tlie ^rthoR looped anodier ceil about the 
girl’s shoulders, and he could see steel- 
cahled mtsdes crawling breath the rep> 
tifs mettled skin as it tightened about ks 
terrified ptey. 

Cbogesled biood darkened Stanly’s 
face as he put every atom of hh> strength 
into the effort of freeing his- hands. HoT' 
roo-peot breath ewdled hia. lungs, 

Di‘mn by sheer despair, he atramed at 
the ropes. Flesh and bone threatened to 
give under the strain; (iien sdirupdy 
something mapped. He idt the weakened 
heo^ dadien^ about tns wrists. Madly 
he clawed free of the bomk, lurched to 
his ieeL 

W«ss span and irurlcd his tall figure at 
Stanley as the latter stinnbfed tow^-d 
Mary Bellani. The young lawyer met his 
rush with a flying right fist that barbed 
squarely on Weiss' mouth. The mad killer 
swung his feet in a vicious kick that raised 
skin from Stanle/s shins. Stanley’s 
right fist stabbed at Weiss’ face again, 
connected, and a sharp, grinding pain shot 
up to the lawyer’s right sfiouTder, as he 
felt hot blood gush over his knurides. 
Weiss shot toward tlie ba^ of the cave 
as thouglt catapulted, his muscular body 
squirming as he tried to keep his balance. 
He smashed into the rock wall and 
dropped to the floor, still squirming. 

Stenley lunged for the hissing python 
— Weiss* statement ckmoring in his 


brain. A man could handle tlie big snake ! 
Ks stiff fingers toudied the reptile, and 
the scafy feel of its body sent waves of 
horror through his Ihfte figure. Tearing 
frantically at the engulfing coils, he freed 
Mary's holders, stabbed at the reptile’s 
weaving bead witli bloody hands. Slug- 
giridy, it tried to trap him in its mottled 
coils. 

He foug^Jt free, tore the slimy body 
from about Mary as ^eer terror and 
horror gave added stret^th to his 
mosdes. The girl was unconscious. 

Stardey putted her free, caugbt lier lia^ 
figure in bis suuis and stumbled toward 
the mouth of the cave, die angry hiss of 
the sfoggkh python eehoit^ in his ears. 
A qoidc gianced showed him Elbert 
Weiss ndling over, trying to get to his 
feet, but Stanley strode on, Mary Bellam 
mhtsarms. 

The sound of underbrush bfeaWog in 
the woods nearby stopped him at the cave 
mouth and in a second he saw Herman 
Kelley’s big bulk plowing through the 
bushes toward the cave. Six thick-shoul- 
cfered Ipirities buret from the woods be- 
hind the big show-owner. All M them 
carried ropes and eltdis. 

“Hi, Stan! I broo^ tiw boys! We’ll 
find that — " 

A slrriil, maddening scream burst from 
the cave oiouth — the scream of a num 
faced by un^)eakab!e horror — and Stan- 
ley thou^t of E&ert Weiss, almost help- 
less. The young lawyer shuddered. 

“What the — ” 

Kelley stared at Mary’s bound figure, 
hfs piglike ^es wide. 

“Get your men in the cave, Kelley!” 
Stanley worked at the gag and ropes about 
Mary Bellam's white flesli. “Try to save 
both of the snakes in there. Come up to 
the cottage after you are througli. I’ll 
wtplain the whole thing to the coroner ami 
the police.’’

Gordon Uais laughed at until she disappeared mysteriously from his 
very arms; only to reappear, after he was doomed and helpless, in a

tlirough, too, from many hidden places, 
and it was, to me, a cry from the heart 
of China. 

I waited, there in the sitting room of 
Liu Ti, for him to tell me why he had 
asked me to come. I’d have come to him 
around the world, and he knew it. For 


forty years my father had been his friend, 
and his father’s friend, in China. Liu Ti 
and my father had been blood-brothers, 
had mingled their blood from cuts in their 
strong right forearmsv 

I, too, knew China. I had spent all of 
my boyhood and most of my young man-

hood there, and had learned to love it. 

“It is a dangerous thing I am asking 
you to do, Gordon Bais,” said Liu Ti. 

I didn’t answer. I looked at his niece, 
gorgeous Liu Mei, and knew that it had 
to do with her. Did she know my secret, 
this Liu Mei? Did Kwan Tao know it? 
Kwan Tao, the dusky, stalwart young 
Chinese who stood beside her ? I doubted 
it. I had never told it to a soul, though 
Liu Mei must have read it in my eyes. 
We had been children together, had almost 
grown up together. Her father had mar- 
ried one of Liu Ti’s sisters, and her fath- 
er had been an American. In the eyes of 
her world and mine, she was an Eurasian, 
neither Chinese nor “foreign”. I looked 
at her and thought of how cruel people 
could be to one another. 

"In the veins of my niece,” said Liu 
Ti, almost in a whisper, "runs the proud 
blood of kings.” 

She was the most gorgeous woman I 
have ever seen. Her hair and eyes were 
black and she bad the delicate beauty which 
must have been that of Kwan Yin, God- 
dess of Mercy, when she had been a 
mortal, walking the earth. 

"I am ready to do anything, old friend,” 
I said to Liu Ti. 

"I know. There has always been a bond 
between us, and between thee and Liu 
Mei. You played together as children. 
Now, Gordon Bais, take her away and 
cherish her!” 

I gasped in amazement. I think my sur- 
prise must have made me look ridiculous. 

"But Kwan Tao, to whom you have 
promised her — ” 

“It can not come to pass, just now. 
Gordon, a shadow of which I can give 
you but the slightest hint hangs over the 
houses of Liu and Kwan. It means death I 
It whispers in the wind across the win- 
dows. It sighs in the fog. It moans in the 
sounds from the river. Take her away 


with you, quickly. For you, an American, 
it may be possible.” 

I looked at Liu Mei. Just to meet her 
eyes had countless times caused my heart 
almost to stop beating. She didn’t smile. 
Her lips were white, and terror was in 
her face — as it was in the eyes of Liu Ti, 
and Kwan Tao. 

There were beads of sweat on the fore- 
head of Liu Ti, and he was of the old 
school, one of those whose faces did not 
cliange, even under torture f 

"If 7 asked you, Gordon,” said Liu Mei 
herself. 

"Anything, Runt,” I said, "you know 
that.” Fd called her “Runt” when we 
had been brats together in Canton. “But 
what of Kwan Tao ?” 

I looked at her fiance, trying to figure 
it out Liu Ti spoke again. 

“It is better you did not know. Liu 
Mei knows little, which she may tell you 
when she is safely away with one who 
loves her. Later, perhaps, Kwan Tao — ” 

The weirdness of Chinatown, of China 
transplanted, chilled me. Again I was 
conscious of the dismal foghorns, of the 
creepy mist that swathed the windows, of 
the strange music from the heart of China- 
town. 

“Nobody will bother a foreigner, be- 
hind whom is the threat of the foreign 
police,” said Liu Ti. “You will go forth 
unmolested. It will be thought that be- 
cause all of the blood in her veins is not 
Chinese, I have <ast her out, to become a 
member of her father’s people.” 

I could see the scheme then, and it 
seemed mad; yet, perhaps, the only one 
that might work. And I knew something 
of the frightful fury of nameless “shad- 
ows” in Chinatown. 

“I shall guard her, until I have word 
from you, as though she were my sister 
— which, almost, she is.” 

“It was knowing this that made me 
send for you. I have never asked before.” 


A BRIDE FOR DEATH 


109 


Liu Mel, tali for a Chinese girl, dressed 
in Occidental garb, came to me then, smil- 
ing a little, and gave me her hand. How 
soft it wasl It made me think of a beat- 
ing heart, a bird’s heart perhaps, beating 
in the palm of the bird’s captor. And 
after Liu Mei came Kwan Tao, with a 
firm handshake whidi said more than 
any words he could have irttered. 

^HE beating of my own heart almost 
suffocated me as I stepped into the 
Iiallway with Liu Mei. And there was 
sorrow, too, that was deeper than the wells 
of Shallaja!. I would have given my life 
for girl. I could understand the gr^t 
love, defying all prejudice, all conventions, 
which must have bound this girl’s father 
to her mother. And now both were dead, 
and Liu Mei dwelt in the house of her 
unclC) aiid bore his name. 

She put her liand on my arm as we 
walked to tlte electric elevator, Liu Ti*s 
establislnnent, combination office and resi- 
dence, was of five stories, and the stairs 
were almost never used for travel between 
floors. 

It suffocated me, almost, to stand in the 
tiny elevator with Liu Mei. Surely she 
must Imow, and lier eyes told me that she 
did ; that she knew she might never men- 
tion it. I would never dare. And because 
I would never dare I blurted out : 

^T’ve always loved you, Liu Mei. My 
greatest desire is for your happiness.” 

She was very close to me then, and 
her hand was still on my arm. Her per- 
fume was in my nostrils, like the radiant 
ghost of herself that might go with me 
always. Her eyes told me that she had 
always known. Was it fancy, or did I see, 
deep down in their depths, some hint of 
love returned? I shook my head, in the 
shock of the near revelation, to drive away 
the image of tlie happiness that might have 
been ours were it not for the insurmount- 
aWe barriers of blood. 


“Tliere will never be another, Liu Mei,” 
I said. 

I pressed the button for the first floor, 
and the cage started down. Liu Mei, as 
we passed tlie fourth floor, reached out her 
hand and turned off the light in the cage. 
I was alone in the dark with the woman 
of all women, whom I loved, and for a 
moment, as the <age went creaking down, 
the knowledge hdd me paralyzed. 

I had looked at my watch, from force 
of habit, when we had entered the cage. 
Ten minutes after eleven at night. By 
eleven-thir^ I would have taken Liu Mei 
to safety. Then I must bear my own 
strange cross in patience until she was 
taken from me foKver. 

Her hand had dropped from my arm, 
as though she were afraid of what I might 
do in my madness, and I locked my lips 
tightly on whatever else desperation might 
have made me say. 

The first floor was just below us. I 
snapped on the light again, mustered a 
smile, and turned to lead her forth when 
the cage stopped. 

I couldn’t believe my eyes. The cage 
hadn’t stopped moving, I would have 
sworn to.tliat, but Lfu Md was not with 
me! She had vanished, out of a moving 
elevator, as though she had turned to fog 
and eddied out through the grills into the 
shaft. 

Nor was that all. Five stalwart men in 
hideous devil masks had taken her place. 
I stared at them in amazement. It couldn’t 
be — ^yet it was. Somewhere along the 
route from the fifth floor to the first Liu 
Mei had vanished and the five had taken 
her place. And the cage hadn’t stopped 
moving. It had been magic. 

“Where is she?” I demanded in shrill, 
frightened Cantonese. 

“Gone I” said one. “And it is an order 
that the meddling foreigner be punished, 
so that never again will he be tempted to 
meddle.” 


110 


TERROR TALES 


The speaker pressed the button again, 
and the cage started to ascend. They 
stopped it between the third and fourth 
floors. As we went up I snapped a glance 
at my watch. It said eleven-thirty! The 
cage, bearing Liu Mei and myself, had 
been twenty minutes descending ! 

The speaker turned out the light. I must 
have been paralyzed with fear and sur- 
prise, for I didn’t even offer resistance. 
In the dark the hands of the “devils” 
began upon me. Their feet came into 
use, too. They kicked me. They clawed 
me. They battered away at me. They 
ripped clothing from me with their knives. 

Finally, when it seemed I could stand 
the agony no longer, something heavy 
struck the top of my head. The cage 
was filled with shooting stars as the bot- 
tom seemed to fall out of it, dropping me 
headlong into the shaft, where I struck to 
find oblivion, black as the deepest night. 

When I regained consciousness I was 
sprawled outside the elevator on the 
ground floor. The outer door, of course, 
was closed. Fog seeped through under it, 
to be absorbed by the lights. I was alone 
in a building filled with echoes and hor- 
ror. My hellish assailants were gone. 

I staggered to my feet. My head was 
splitting. I ached in every bone and mus- 
cle. I vras a six-footer who should have 
been able to put up a terrific battle, but the 
five had handled me with ease, giving me 
the most brutal beating any man had ever 
had to take. 

The seeming miracle of the twenty- 
minute descent, the vanishing of Liu 
Mei, the appearance of the five, did not 
puzzle me as it might have any one who 
did not know the potentialities of Chinese 
master mummers as I did. 

I didn’t leave, though, as the five, or 
those who had sent them, must have ex- 
pected. They did not know my feeling 
for Liu Mei, which would have sent me 
Into the pit itself. 


I rang for ffie elevator again. I 
crawled into it, wondering what sort of 
hell would breathe its brimstone into it 
this time, and went back to the fifth floor. 
The door to the apartment of Liu Ti was 
open. I crossed the threshold my terror 
mounting. 

There was nobody here but Liu Ti, and 
what I might have said to him would never 
now be said. He was dead. He hung by 
a silken cord from a beam of his living 
room. His face was a mask of horror. 
His bulging eyes stared right at me, as 
though he said: 

"By the bond which existed between 
yovr father and me, Gordon Bais, I com- 
mand you to stand by my niece and her 
betrothed until the end!" 

CHAPTER TWO 

Tiny Shoes 

''^ERY carefully and reverently I cut 
’ the cord which hung Liu Ti to the 
beam and lowered him to the floor. I had 
closed the outer door. Then I now went, 
systematically, through all the rooms. Not 
another soul was in the place, living or 
dead. Yet he had had a sister here, a 
wife, and a brother. Now all were gone. 

And I, by virtue'^f being my father’s 
son, was a part of this family! I had been 
spared, I knew, because I was not Chi- 
nese. But if I did not refrain from med- 
dling, my recent captors had said, and 
had provtti by their manhandling, my 
white blood would not save me from their 
sinister designs. Right now, I could have 
sworn, scores of eyes were watching me, 
studying me, waiting — 

The family of Liu Ti was gone. He 
at least, would never know if I went out, 
this very minute, into the street, and left 
Chinatown never to return. What had I 
to do with the Chinese? Maybe, in the 
final analysis, I loved that part of Liu

Mei which was of my own race. Maybe 
I was blinded by my love of Oiina, where 
I had spent so many years. Maybe, wlien 
my own pec^le looked upon love between 
the races with revclsion, they were r^ht. 
Maybe — Well, if I went away now I was 
safe. They had safd so. If I st^»ed, the 
beating I had taken would be horribly 
littfe compared to what ^y could do to 
me. 

But, Lla Mei's father had been white, 
and ray own father’s friend, I knew what 
my dad, if he had been Iivlog> would have 
done. And i knew what my own heart 
dictated. I stooped over Liu Ti, then, aad 
whirred: 

"They won’t get away with it, oM- 
titnw," I said. **Not while I’m 

Hp couldn't hear me, of course — or 
could he? His face didn't diai^e ex- 
pre^on, but somehow I knew th^ he 
knewh--had, perhaps, known from the be- 
gimiang. 

belb, the love between Mei and 
me xvas the sort of thft^ whidi ndgbl de- 
vefbp between a*^ boy and girt vdio, 
rear^ tt^ether, had never been allowed 
to know what the outside wortd thiJu^t 
of what it cruelly cafied "mfcced love". It 
was just that, nothing more. To me she 
was a Chinese, and the sooner I forgot 
about her, the better. But even as these 
traitorous thoughts went through my 
brain, like black U^tning flashes, I seemed 
to see Liu Mei standing befons me, her 
eyes calm, filled with the bnowkdge of 
the ages, as th^ stared into mine and 
said: 

‘Tt isn’t like you, Gordon !" 

And it wasn’t. Why should human be- 
ings draw back from one another be- 
cause of race, or color, or rel^on? 

I knew then that nothing wouW ever 
change me, not even when the time came, 
as it pBobably would, when I would be put 
to torture for my meddling. 

Without a backward glance I hurried 


from the room of Liu Ti and into the 
hallway I had last traversed with Liu Mei. 

"Somewhere between the fourth ftooi 
and the fi^rst," I told myself, "the strange 
thing happened; I must find which floor, 
ril start with the fourth." For it was 
there that Liu Mei, afraid of being spied 
upon, had turned out the ligjit. 

I went down in the devator. It pleased 
me to defy the enemy tn thfs much at 
least. I sti^ped at the fourth floor and 
got out, shutting the door behind me. I 
was in another hallway, brilliantly Itghted. 
I began to move along it, my eyes study- 
ing every inch of space. I had the feeling 
that somehow Liu Mei woidd drop some- 
thing dial would let me know, that would 
point the way to the place I might find 
her. But there was notHng. I went back 
to the elevator. 

I hadn’t seen a soul, and the echoes of 
my own footfalls had taken on sinister 
meaning in the deserted hallway. They 
seemed to be shouting to me to go bsrck, 
to run, fo cease trying to pry into the 
dark secrets of Chinatown. 

I started to open the elevator door, but 
it would not open. My heart stopped for 
a moment. Since I had left the cage, 
some one had signaled for it, and it had 
^ne~down or up. Viciously I jabbed 
the button — and lieard the whirring of the 
cage from below. There was something 
horrible in that whirring. What would I 
see when I opened the door of the cage? 
Who had signaled it ? Had that one known 
what I was doing? ^es watched me 
now ; I loiew it. They would watch me 
as long as I was in Qimatown, and wher- 
ever I went out of Qiinatown, until the 
tortuous Chinese minds were satisfied that 
the affair of Liu Ti and Kwan Tao and 
Liu Mei had been settled accordhig to the 
rdenttess Chinese code. 

The cage stopped at my floor. I yanked 
open the door. I don’t know what I ex- 
pected to find, certainly not what I did 


112 


TERROR TALES 


find : Liu San, brother of Liu Ti, standing 
in a corner of the cage, rigidly erect, his 
black eyes staring into mine. 

There was the haft of a knife sticking 
out of his left breast. His right hand 
was clutched about the haft. Cold chills 
raced along my spine. He was dead. He 
had to be dead, with the knife in him like 
that. But why did he stand upright ? And 
why was he in the cage now, when it had 
been empty the last time I had seen it. 
Or had it? The last three words were 
almost a cry of terror. Had he been there 
with me, during my recent descent from 
the fifth floor to the fourth? If he had, 
I hadn't known it; 3ret I knew it was 
possible. 

I would have screamed, but knew it use- 
less. A hundred murders could have been 
committed here, and none outside the 
wiser — as long as the victims were Chi- 
nese. A white man, disappearing, would 
be sought. 

I stepped into the cage, which quivered 
a little, and touched the body of Liu San. 
Instantly it toppled sidewise, crashing 
stiffly to the floor. The corpse was already 
rigid. 

Had this body been sent to me as a 
warning? I didn’t know, but I did know 
that some one listened — ^many some ones 
— and watched. I shouted, knowing that 
my words went ringing up and down the 
shaft, and out through the grills at all 
five floors: 

“So help me God, I’ll bring every one 
responsible for this to justice — and I’ll 
slay them with my bare hands if any harm 
comes to Liu Mei.” 

Of course it was foolish. No sooner 
had I shouted, the echoes ringing all 
through the empty building, than I knew 
just how foolish it was. On the hallway 
of the floor above me I could hear the 
scuffling of sandaled feet. On the floor 
below I could hear it, too. All through 
the building. 


I slammed the door, dropped down to 
the next floor. And this time I left the 
door open, so that only by cwning to this 
floor could any one use the elevator. And 
I’d be in the hallway, where I could see 
whoever approached. I was fighting mad, 
and more frightened than I had ever been ; 
for Liu Mei, mostly, I told myself, and 
didn’t fool myself at all. I remembered 
the kiss and caress of' Chinese knives, 
and knew that I would feel them again. 

Liu Mei, perhaps, was feeling them 
now I 

I searched this hallway, too, and found 
nothing. Then I went back to the ele- 
vator. No one had approached it, for re- 
peatedly I had looked back, to make sure. 

I started to step into the cage. 

The body of Liu San had vanished. In 
its place reposed the dead body of Liu 
Ti’s sister, around her neck the mate of 
the cord which had strangled Liu Ti ! The 
elevator had become an instrument of hell- 
ish black magic. Two people had been 
slain in it within the last fifteen minutes, 
or slain elsewhere and dumped into it for 
me to find, by some means I couldn’t even 
guess at. 

I was like an automaton, geared to run 
a certain distance in a straight line. I 
couldn’t, wouldn’t turn back, or change 
my course in one iota, come hell or high 
water. I dropped down to the second floor, 
still seeking the trail of Liu Mei. 

This had to be the last floor, for I had 
come to on the first floor to find Liu Mei 
missing. 

I stepped fearfully over the supine body 
of Liu Ti’s sister, into the hallway. And 
almost at once, like eyes of cats blinking 
in the dark, I saw the shoe. It was a tiny 
shoe, and I recognized it at once. One 
of Liu Mei’s, set with the brilliants that 
peeped forth so alluringly from under the 
hem of her gown when she walked. 

It seemed to call to me, beseechingly. 

It seemed to plead. 


A BRJDE FOR DEATH 


113 


It seemed to threaten, to challenge me. 

It took all of my courage to walk down 
the hallway to that single shoe, to stare 
down at it. It rested on its side at the 
top of a flight of stairs. It was Liu Mei’s 
shoe, without a doubt. She had kicked it 
off for me to find or had she? Maybe her 
captors had left it there, to lead me to 
destruction. What would happen to me 
if I picked it up and went with it down 
the stairs? Those stairs, strangely, were 
ominously black, filled with ebon fore- 
boding of disaster to come. 

The whole building seemed to have 
fallen silent to listen — to what? To the 
beating of my own terrified heart? 

I wouldn’t take the black stairs. They 
led down to the first floor. I’d take the 
elevator, stubbornly, as I had taken it 
hitherto. This time I expected to find 
that some other horror had developed in 
my absence. 

But no. The door of the cage was still 
open, and the sister of Liu Ti still 
sprawled supine on the floor. 

I started to shut the door when the cry 
came — shrill, piercing, filled with agony, 
and with terror. 

"Gordon! Gordon Bais !’’ 

The cry came from the depth of that 
black stairwell, whence steps led down into 
God knew what. That it had been the 
voice of Liu Mei I knew for a certainty, 
as I raced for the stairs. 

And scarcely had the echoes of my 
footfalls started in the liallway again, than 
it came once more, with something added : 

“Gordon I Go back ! Go back ! Don’t 
fol— ’’ 

And there it broke short off, and I knew 
that a hand had closed tightly over her 
mouth — z. dirty hand, a grimy Chinese 
hand, like the hands which had beaten me, 
smelly hands, hands which it were sacri- 
l^e to use upon the person of Liu Md. 
If I could get my hands on the fellow who 
had stopped her ! Even for touching her, 


I would tear his heart out with steely finr 
gers. I didn’t realize she had warned me 
back until I had plunged headlong into 
the black stairwell — to be swallowed by a 
darkness redolent with the odor of in- 
cense and Liu Mei’s perfume. 

I saw her, then, vanishing into the hall- 
way on the first floor, around the comer 
of the stairwell below, carried backward, 
upright, in the big arms of two huge men 
whose faces I could not see, but which I 
knew were devil-masked. 

Something struck me at the base of 
the skull, and I rolled down the rest of 
the stairs, numb from the blow but know- 
ing as I rolled that my attacker was right 
behind, coming to strike me ^in. 

I hit the bottom and fought for the 
strength to meet him when he reached me. 

CHAPTER THREE 

Where Is Uu Mei? 

WHOLE body, as I dragged stub- 
bomly to my feet, seemed to be made 
of lead. My arms were unbearaWe bur- 
dens, my legs were almost too heavy to 
drag under me. My neck was stiff, almost 
immovable, as I twisted it, by great effort 
of will, to face the man who came down 
tlie stairs behind me. 

A Chinese, of course, and a huge one, 
wearing a devil’s mask. I couldn’t have 
handled him, man for man, had I been 
in full possession of my faculties, and he 
unarmed. As matters stood I was on my 
feet, but out, helpless, and he carried a 
club in both hands. He wore the queue, 
most unusual in a modern Chinese, and 
it looked like a snake above his mask. 

His teeth were showing in a snarl, or a 
grimace of murderous amusement. He 
was like something out of a nightmare. I 
raised my hands, or tried to, to ward off 
the blow he was sending at my ^IL But 
my tends wouldn’t move, and the blow 


114 


TERROR TAIBS 


landed. It landed with a dull sound, as 
though he had struck the head of a drum, 
and I scarcely felt it at all. 

That one thing told me how close I 
was to death. He had brought the chib 
down whh both hands. I had tried to pull 
my head out of the way. I think the blow 
was a glancing one. It must have been, 
else it would have driven my head down 
into my shoulders. 

He came at me, striking again. My right 
shoulder . . . well, I think it was almost 
broken by that first blow. I had no de- 
fense whatever, except my wits. 

And a certain knowledge of Cantonese. 
Now I used the latter knowledge, and 
heard sing-song words burble madly 
through my lips— -lips that felt diick as 
untanned leather. T^e figure of the Chi- 
nese danced before my eyes, until there 
seemed to te two of him, as I ^oke the 
words; 

must get to liu Mei. She has done 
nothing. What w31 they do to her?’' 

His answer was so strange that for a 
long moment I did not understand him. 

“You know the ancient Cantonese cus- 
tom of the broken urn?” 

Um?" I repeated. “What has 
Liu Mei to do with urns?” 

“This,” he answered, falling back a lit- 
tle because I had managed to lift my left 
foot against him, to keep him from getting 
too close. “That a Chinese husband ex- 
pects his wife ft come to him, as for^gn- 
ers call it, *idean'. If he finds it is not 
so, he «ends her back to her fafter, on a 
rattling cart, a broken urn swinging 
below — a broken urn surrounded by bits 
of metal that dink.*’ 

The hoiTor it drove most of the 
numbness out of me, then and there. . I 
loved the -Chinese, always had, the bad 
whh the good, but had never been able to 
thifdc of thdr heartlessness to women 
without a shudder of revulsion. 

"But Lilt Hei can not thus be sent 


back!" Again that horrible rattling in my 
throat which I could scarcely recc^ize 
as my own voice speaking Cantonese. 
"There is no finer, more suitable woman 
anywhere.” 

"That is true,” he said, "at the moment. 
But when we have finished whh her — " 

He left it there, and I knew the full 
meaning of his horrible, fang-showing 
grimace. Uu Mei was to be given to 
these monsters. She was being taken away 
to that fate even as we spoke. Afteni-ard 
Kwan Tao, being a Chinese, could no 
more have taken her to wife than he could 
have denied his belief in gods and devils 
on the rivers of his native land. It wasn’t 
the first time a fragile, delicate Chinese 
woman had been given to a mob. 

And here was I, numb with hurt, un- 
able to stop this imspealable hoiTor, and 
Liu Mei already gone. Nothing had hap- 
pened to her so far only because her cap- 
tors must first make sure of me. They 
had no desire for "foreign” police to 
break in ou them. 

I cried out in agony. I was a desperate, 
savage man at that moment, who couldn’t 
be hurt any more. Whether I loved Liu 
Mei or not, I'd have gone to help her, be- 
cause she was a woman, and lier captors 
blood-mad brutes. 

My desperation lent power to my bands, 
my feet. I lunged at my attacker, with my 
head down, like a footbfdl player smash- 
ing the line. Again his club crashed 
down on me. This time I took most of 
the t^rific blow <m my shoulderbbdes, 
but almost intolerable pain shot through 
my entire body, Then my head crashed 
into the man’s stomach. He was tdcen by 
surprise by a form of attack new to him 
and went violently backward to the floor, 
striking his head with a sickening thud. 
The club rolled from his hands. 

I saw it and resolved tliat, whatever 
happened to Liu Mei, none of it wotdd 
be because of this man at my feet. 


A BRIDE FOR DEATH 


115 


I picked up the dub. I remembered 
the blows which had crashed against my 
skull. ... I Must have been mad, a beast 
in my own right. 

With all my power I smashed the club 
down on his head, just as he lifted it 
from the floor. As it struck the top of 
his skull, I felt the club sink in, or the 
wood give, and his head dropped back 
soddenly upon the floor. 

Something red and sinuous, like a crim- 
son snake, crept out from his mask, slug- 
gislily crawling. 

Still with the dub in my hand, I whirled 
and ran, sluggishly, along the way those 
two had gone with Liu Mei, I scarcely 
realized that the blood from my own 
wounds was streaming down my cheeks 
until I tasted its salt on my lips. 

Another flight of stairs led down into 
darkness. ... I didn’t hesitate. 

T CRASHED down those stairs, and 

from that moment on what happened 
was a kind of blur. There were masked 
men on the stairs, and I struck at them 
savagely, with all my power. I felt the 
club crack against skulls, cheeks, against 
bodies. I rammed the end of It into bel- 
lies, but I allowed none of this to stay 
my headlong plunge down those stairs. 

It w'as dark, that basement, where I 
struck the bottom of the stairs, but far 
ahead of me I saw a faint glow of light, 
and I knew that I was somewhere in the 
labyrinth under Chinatown — ^that maze of 
tunnels and passageways which no white 
man ever sees. 

There were men behind me, but they 
feared my bloody, swinging club. Be- 
sides, I was mouthing weird cries which 
sounded insane even to me — and Chinese 
have dread respect for the insane. 

Knowing this the inspiration came to 
pretend insanity, to keep it up until the 
last. If they’d realize that, insane or not, 

"^as aiming directly at the freeing of 


Liu Mei they would know I was not mad, 
but if I acted fast enough they wouldn’t 
have time to think. 

I came to that glow of fight It was a 
tunnel mouth, and in the tunnel I dashed 
to the first turnii^;. Even here I could see 
that it led to another basement, and a 
vast room outfitted with gaudy lavishness. 
The room was filled with coolies, scores 
of them, standing, facing their master 
with becoming servility, masked heads 
bowed. 

There was one man on a dais, a man 
in gorgeous robes, with a black cap on 
his head, topped by a red coral button. 
He wore the five-strand beard of venerable 
wisdom, and there was no smile on his 
lips, nor mask upon his face. Bound, 
gagged, fastened to a column which up- 
held the roof, stood Kwan Tao. He was 
struggling with hie bonds. His eyes were 
shooting flames. 

I stared at him as I ran. He was naked 
to the waist, and his torso was a mass of 
blood. Kwan Tao had been beaten with 
the bamboo until his skin and flesh had 
been shredded. His chest was crimson and 
dripping and horrible. It made me think 
of the ghastly "death of a thousand cuts 
...” but I know Kwan Tao wasn’t think- 
ing of those wounds, those ghastly wounds 
which would have killed a white man. 

Standing between two coolies, before 
the man on the dais, was Liu Mei. 

Her face was deadly white, but she 
stood proudly erect, like a soldier. I saw 
the lips of the man on the dais, and they 
were moving, but what the man said I 
couldn’t make out. Yet I was close enough 
to have heard. 

I saw the lips of Liu Mei move in an- 
swer. I saw her head thrown back, as 
though she flung defiance into the face 
of the seated man. His face was twisted 
into bestial lines as he listened. But why 
couldn’t I hear what was being said ? Had 


116 


TERROR TALES 


something happened to my senses as Ihe 
result of the beatings I had taken ? 

The whole thing was utterly weird. It 
was tiice watching a silent motion picture, 
and hearing not even the machine which 
ran it. Yet all of these people were alive, 
unless I were looking into a vart mirror, 
which seemed impossible. 

The man on the dais suddenly rose, 
shot out his hand and slapped Liu Mei 
twice, once -on either side of the face, so 
hard that I thought her head would be 
knod»d from her shouidets, I knew that 
^e acrcMned, for I could see her moutii 
open, but I teard no sound. The Chinese 
master stood there in his wrath, and I 
knew that he heaped that wrath upon this 
woman who defied Win. 

Her uncle, his sister — Mid God knew 
who rfse — had already paid the penalty for 
something. I had seen two— a, sister and 
a brother of Liu Ti— and knew some of 
the answer. When any Chinese tribunal 
sentenced a man to death, his whole fam- 
ily dial with him. for what good did it 
do "'to destroy the tiger Mid spare die 
cute?” 

Only Kwaa Tao they had spared, for 
the moment at least; kit in the end lie 
would go the same way. Just now, tliougli, 
they wished hhn to know to the full the 
huntihation to be visited upon Liu Mei. 

T HAD the m^t terrible feeling, as I 

hurled ojyseif toward this ghastly tab- 
leau, that I was a man in a nightmare, 
with someiMie I loved in dangw and my 
own feet rooted to the ground so that I 
could not move, while death raixd upon 
me from the rear. 

It was like swimming in glue, for- 
ward march, because of my weakness. My 
feet drammed against the tunnel floor, but 
seemed to talce me forward not at all. My 
club was altnost too heavy to hold. I 
had to clutch it with all the strength of 
my two hands. 


I wondered if Lm Mei didn't know I 
was here, trying my best to get to her — 
if only that I might ^ay her myself, to 
save her from what the monsters would 
do to her. Did she guess? As tiiough in 
answer to my thought she turned and 
looked dired:1y at me. I thought her right 
hand lifted, palm toward me, as though 
she would order me to get back, to save 
myself. 

But she couldn't, possibly, liave seen me. 
I knew that instantly, and yet in some 
strange fashion she must have known I 
was there, trying my best to reach her. 

I whirled. There where hideously 
masked faces all around me. Qiinese 
blocking my retreat had I wished to re- 
treat They didn't offer to touch me again. 
They merely laughed, horrible cackling 
laughter which shodc their bodies witli 
their gliouUsh glee — and they were laugh- 
ing at me. 

I whirled, burled myself forward again. 
I struck something;, an invisible mysterious 
something, in fidl stride, and it knocked 
mo flat on my back, stunning me again. 
I almost lost my clUb . . . and all around 
me they laughed and chattered. I scram- 
bled to my feet, felt in the air for what- 
ever it was that had knocked me down. 

My hands came in terrifying contM:t 
with an expanse of spotlessly clean glass, 
of such dimensions that it sliut me in the 
tunnel entirely — ^yet let me see the hwror 
of tbe room b^'ond! 

CHAPTER FOUR 

HfiS B4ow 

IlffANY tilings were made plain to me 
in that one agonizing moment. I 
knew, or guessed, sometiiing of what must 
have happened. Coming down in the ele- 
vator, Liu Mei and I had passed a floor 
just after some sort of wflatHe. drug, hid- 
den in the odor of meense perhaps, had 


A BRIDE FOR DEATH 


117 


been blown through the grill. It had in- 
stantly rendered both of iis inanimate. 
The cage had automatically stopped at the 
ground floor, where I had been taken out. 

Then the enemy on the other floor had 
pressed the signal, and the cage had gone 
back up, bearing Liu Mei, helpless, un- 
conscious of what was happening to her, 
into the hands of her enemies. 

I had awakened in the cage again, and 
had been beaten horribly because I was too 
numb and stupid from the drug to fight 
back. 

Why had the Chinese gone about their 
work in so elaborate a fashion, when a 
single knife thrust would have done for 
me and left Liu Mei in their hands? 
There seemed, at the moment, just one ex- 
planation, the one I had given myself. 
They played with me to keep me from 
going out and bringing the white police. 
And they didn’t kill me solely because 
they dldn‘’t know for sure that I hadn’t 
told police to come looking for me if I 
didn’t reappear in a certain length of 
time. 

And this glass in the tunnel, shutting 
me off from the room beyond. I could 
imagine why it was there. Not for my 
personal and special confounding, but so 
that enemies of this imholy group, or peo- 
ple who doubted its power, might see what 
the monsters were capable of doing. 

I couldn’t go forward. The tunnel be- 
hind me was packed with Chinese. 

Knowledge of my plight drove me mad. 
In a few moments something terrible 
would happen to Liu Mei. I had to reach 
her. 

I think desperation must have given me 
the strength of many men. I stepped back 
from that expanse of glass. I felt my 
biceps bulge. Power, unimaginable power, 
seemed to swell and distend my every 
nerve and muscle. 

The world whirled. 

The tunnel spun. 


I hurled myself at that glass. I didn’t 
feel my hurts. It was as though my anger 
had nullified my agony. Sweat dripped 
from me, the salty sweat of a cornered 
brute beast. 

My chib crashed against that glass with 
all the power I had. As it did, every face, 
and every mask, in the room beyond was 
turned toward me. Liu Mei turned, and 
her hand went to her mouth. Her eyes 
were big with terror. 

A great jagged star showed in the glass. 
I felt someone hurl himself at me from 
behind. I spun, swung instinctively, lifted 
my aim a little, and crashed my stick in 
the man’s mouth. It must have knocked 
out every tooth m his head. He turned a 
back somersault into the press behind him. 

But I didn’t even wait to see him strike 
among his fellows. 

• I whirled back to the glass again, seiz- 
ing the split seconds left before the enemy 
behind overpowered me. The first crash 
of my bludgeon against the glass had 
sounded like the crack of doom. 

The second was even worse, for slivers 
of glass broke free and clattered into the 
tunnel in jagged shards, while others fell 
in the rown beyond. Berserk now, un- 
stoppable, desperate with terror, I swung, 
and swung again. 

I smashed through. The opening was 
small, but I stepped back and hurled my- 
self through it, just the same. Jagged 
points like a thousand swords struck me, 
caught at my clothing, ripped my flesh, I 
was sobbing and cursing. 

I would reach Liu Mei. I would free 
Kwan Tao. 

T STAGGERED to my knees beyond the 

glass, turning a little, to see the smaller 
Chinese coming through the glass after 
me. 

I paused just a moment to crack down 
on the skulls of the first two. I did not 
spare my strength, and there were other 


118 


TERROR TALES 


spfaffers of crimson on the glass when I 
again sw’ung back to the occupimts of 
that hateful room. My enemies in the 
tunnel, aghast that one man could be so 
murderously destructive, and drawn back. 

NcfW I could hear the voices of die men 
in the room I had so violently and madly 
entered. 

The man on the dais : 

“Sdze the ^rl 1 Take her to the room 
beyond! Half the coolie with her, the 
other half here to slay this meddler f" 

The coolies divided as though they had 
alreaffy been instructed. Kwan Tao, a 
bleeding Iwrror, tugged witliout cessation 
at his fionds. The man on the dais scarce- 
ly moved, nor did the expression on his 
face change. 

CooRes jumped between the girl and me. 
Through their ranks I saw the others, 
bearing the girt to the other room. I had 
no trouble gu^sing what woufd happen 
there. 

But no damned coolies could keep me 
from reaching her! 

I swung into that first group with all 
njy desperate ftrry. One went down with 
a smashed ^tll. I heard the man on the 
dais 

"The first man to break ground before 
I bid him, dies by my hand!" 

I snapped a glance over my right shoul- 
der. The man on the dais gripped a snub- 
nosed automatic in his ri^t hand. 

Anotlier -Chinese v’tut down. Despera- 
tion drove the other coolies as they stood 
shoulder to shoulder to fight me off. There 
were stiH more a>ming through the glass 
behind me, I knew. But I didn't take 
time to turn. 

I swept die heavy end of that club 
along the faces of my enemies, not to 
land solidly, but to graze ant} maim and 
smash. The effect was horrible, the now 
bloody masks askew. 

It was like running the end of a stick 
along a picket fence, save that tire result 


was bloody horror. And I cried out 
^riHy, all the tfme. I saw the door be- 
yond them open. Liu Mei cast one de- 
spairing look over her shoulder at me as 
the coolies bore her into that room, out 
of which a faint light came. Then she 
was gone, and die smiridng coolies with 
her, and hell had never spawned a fury 
such as I became. 

I swung again— -and missed completely. 

And this was the reason. The man 
on the dais had said’: 

“Enough! Let him try to reach Irer 
now. You are too iate^ Gordon Bais. By 
the time you could rip down tliat door — ’’ 

He di^'t have to finish it. I hurled 
myself toward the door, but my mind was 
not on tliat objective. It held a picture of 
the automatic gripped on the knee of the 
master of all this horror. I couldn't reach 
him. Bullets woirid travel too fast. His 
eyes would be following every move I 
now made. I had his location fast fixed 
in my mind. I must make no slightest 
error of judgment. And I did not. Al- 
most at the door, I whirled like a dervish, 
and the blunt-ended club sped from my 
hands with aH my power, and with all the 
skill that sometimes comes to a man in 
a desperate place. 

It went like a shot, directly for the chest 
of the man on the dais. His moQth opened 
to scream. But the sound never got out. 
His right hand Italf swung toward me, 
but he didn’t have time to pull the trigger. 

The bhint dub struck him in the dhest, 
and bones and cartdage must have given 
back before the hurtling projectile. The 
man toppled badeward from his dais. I 
was right behind my strange weapon of 
offense, while the cooKes, slow thinkers 
almost incapable of executing anytititig 
without the command of some superior, 
stared at me like so many yellow statues. 

Only their ^es moved. 

I grasped the unconscious tealer by the 
throat, yanked him to fiis feet. 


A BRIDE FOR DEATH 


119 


I shook him. I had to bring him to. I 
grabbed at his automatic, held it in my 
right hand, so that its muazle menaced the 
wall of coolies who now surrounded me. 

"Make one move against me,” I said 
hoarsely, "and ITl twist this man’s head 
from his shoulders!” 

They knew I meant it, and this man 
was their rice, their living, their master. 
No move was made by any one. The man 
was coming around. 

"Where is the key to that room?” I de- 
manded. "If I don’t get it I’ll still kill 
this monster!” 

Nobody spoke. The unconscious man 
couldn’t. 

Kwan Tao still stru^Ied with his 
bonds. I snapped at the nearest coolie, in 
whose belt was a knife. 

"Loose his gag! Cut his bonds!” 

]^0 COOLIE had ever obeyed a mas- 

* ter more quickly. Kwan Tao stepped 
free. His face, his whole body, had been 
so harshly tortured that it was next to 
impossible to recognize him. 

"Where is the key, Kwan Tao?” I de- 
manded. 

"On his left wrist, hidden under the 
sleeve.” 

I found it, fastened by a thong. I 
yanked it free, breaking the thong, but 
only after it had cut deeply into the man’s 
flesh. I dragged him to the door. I com- 
manded Kwan Tao to hold him there. . . 

"If anything has happened to her,” I 
said, "this man will wish to God he had 
never been born!” 

Kwan Tao didn’t answer me. He 
merely stared. His lips worked spasmodi- 
cally. His face was a gargoylesque red 
mask. 

"Take this gat,” I snapped again, "and 
see that the coolies don’t follow us into 
the room.” 

I twisted the key in the lock. The door 
ojEiened protestingly. From inside it, driv- 


ing me to madness, came sounds which 
were like, a woman’s moans of terror. 
Then words in shrill Cantonese, in Liu 
Mei’s voice : 

“Turtles, sons of turtles, eggs of tur- 
tles 1 How dare you lay hands on a daugh- 
ter of kings!” 

And one voice making answer : 

"Daughter of kings, true, but damned 
to eternity by mingling with the blood of 
a barbarian! Even your ancestors would 
say that what befalls you will be less than 
you deserve!” 

Then I was inside, with Kwan Tao be- 
side me, dragging the man I had all but 
slain. And what a tableau met my eyes. 
Liu Mei, backed against a far wall, much 
of her upper garments tom away. Her 
head was back, her shoulders were stiff 
with pride. Her right hand held a knife, 
poised, its point aimed at her own heart. 

The masked coolies were closing on her 
in a tight semi-circle, like hyenas to the 
kill. 

"Drop it, Liu Mei,” snapped some one. 
"Out, you curs, back with your own !” 

The crimson Kwan Tao was the 
spokesman. Liu Mei dropped the knife. 
The Chinese slunk past us like beaten 
mongrels. 

Kwan Tao, while relief began to surge 
through me, shut the door, locked it, put 
his back against ft. 

Kwan Tao grinned, a savage, red grin. 

The man he had dragged in with him 
had vanished! Maybe he had been play- 
ing dead. Maybe, well, the fact remained 
that between the second Kwan Tao 
shoved him against the wall, and closed 
the door, the man had snapped into con- 
sciousness, and had slipped out behind 
Kwan Tao. 

Kwan Tao hadn’t closed the door. 

It had been closed from outside, and 
all three of us were prisoners! 

"We bimgled it,” said Kwan Tao, "but 
maybe it is just as well.” 


120 


HBRROR TALES 


He stared at Liu M«, as I did. Hef 
face wouM never be whiter. She had 
plainly been through hell, I wanted to 
ask her what had happened. Chinese are, 
to us, brutally frank. Kwan Tao asked 
her before I could : 

“Those coolies ? Did they—” 

“Have coolies ever, in all our history,” 
asked Liu Mei bitterly, “failed to take ad- 
\'antage of women captives?” 

She didn’t mince words. I saw the fece 
of Kwan Tao change as no torture had 
ever been able to make it change. No 
Chinese of his station cotdd possibly ig- 
nore the “law of the broken nfn.” 

I broke in on tlie grim, impas^He 
thing that had come between Kwan Tao 
and the woman both of us loved. 

“Will some one kindly tell me the 
meaning of all this?” 

“1 will,” said Kwan Tao, “and I must 
hurry, for we have little time.” 

“Little time?” I repeated. 

“Yes, for even now the snaky tendrils 
of the yellow smoke comes into this cKam- 
ber from the room of hell beyond.” 

The flowery language of the high-bom 
Chinese did not desert him even now, I 
whirled, and saw the yellow snioke; yel- 
low tentacles of it, coming in through the 
keyhole, making one think of an inept 
smoker trying to blow rings. 

I choked. It already had me by the 
throat. 

CHAPTER HVE 

Chineje Blank Watb 

rU TI,” said Kwan Tao, speaking 
very rapidly, “wished me to take 
Liu Mei in marriage. I wished it, too, 
proud to have for wife the dau^ter of 
Chinese kings. But the tong said no. Lhi 
Ti (^fied the tong. They thr^tened us 
^ with death i^ Liu Ti persisted in his 
defiance. Liu Ti thought you might help. 


This is the result. And now, my two good 
friends, here we are, altogether, with but 
a few minutes of life left to us.” 

He didn't go toward Liu Mei. I knew 
that centuries of tradition held him apart 
from her. Modern America would have 
ridden, in its youth, over any such barrier 
as convention had reared between these 
two, especially when the fault was not 
with Liu Mei. 

Kwan Tao spoke to her. 

“I loved you from the bottom of my 
heart, Liu Ti.” 

“I know.” Her voice was harsh. “But 
if we were to escape from this pit, you 
would never again so much as touch my 
hand.” 

He didn't nod ; he couldn't. He didn’t 
shake his head. There was no answer he 
could give, because Liu Mei had already 
given it. 

"I love you, too, Liu Mei, have always 
loved you,” I said. 

One might as well speak truly on the 
brink of the grave, where there was noth- 
ing to win or lose, 

“I loved 3 rou both,” said Liu Mei, 
speaking as one already dead. “And now 
I die, alone. It is so unutterably lonely.” 

I didn’t tell them, even if there had 
been time, what had befallen their people. 
They must have guessed anythow. They 
knew their own kind. 

I whirled on Kwan Tao. 

“Go to her, Tao,” I choked. “Take her 
in your arms. What can it matter now, 
when death is so close?” 

He looked at her and did not move. In 
the ear of my mind I could hear a creaky 
cart on the streets of Canton, with a tin- 
kling, broken urn swinging below it. I 
could see Liu Mei, white o| face, sitting 
on that cart, jeered at by multitudes along 
the narrow, muddy streets. 

The thought almost broke my heart. 

I started toward Liu Mei, and couldn’t 
make it. My feet didn’t work properly. 


A BRIDE FOR DEATH 


121 


I staggered, almost falling, away over to 
the right. The wall was jumping at me. 
I couldn’t lift my arms, to ward it off. 
It struck me in the face, knocking me flat. 
I rolled to my side, looked at Kwan Tao. 
He was staring, his face a mask of agony, 
at Liu Mei. But he hadn't taken a step 
toward her. 

Now he swayed, like a tree in a hurri- 
cane, as the drug which was slaying all 
three of us got in its deadly work. 

I got to my feet, finally, and it was like 
lifting a mighty weight. I slid against the 
wall, trying to shove myself toward Liu 
Mei. She was watching me, and her eyes 
thanked me. It must liave hew terrible, 
to a delicately nurtured woman, to die Uke 
this, with two men who knew what a 
dreadful thing bad happened to her. 

X fina% reached her. 

I put n^ arm around it. It was like 
tryir^ to lift an arm of lead. I sagged 
against Hie wall. A yellow film now 
sttetdiBd between Kwan Tao and me, 
through which he seemed still to sway. 
His eyes were still fixed on Liu Mei. 

I thought he was talking, but there was 
a ringing in my ears, so that I was none 
too sure. 

"Daughter of kings! Blood of kings!” 
I tliougbt he was saying. “Defiled by 
dregs from die rbttenest gutters of China- 
town! How can I—” 

1 turned to Liu l^ei. 

"It wouldn’t matter to me, darling,” I 
whispered, my whisper a sobbing kind of 
gasp. “I know you coalAi’t help it. I 
would tjdce you in my arms, hold you 
forever, and we’d both forget.” 

She whispesed back. 

"How good it is to know that, Gordon 
Bais, on the brink of the Eastern 
Heaven.” 

Shb, like Kwan Tko, used the flowery 
speech in a crisis. She was all Chinese, 
save that her coloring was almost as light 


as my own. She, to me, was an American 
girl. 

I tried to hold her more tightly. But 
both of us were swaying, and I was trying 
to grip the smooth cold wall with the 
fingernails of my free liand. I felt the 
nails slide along the stone j I heard them, 
like a thin screaming in my ears. These 
weird impressions told me that hashish, 
at least in part, was in the yellow smoke 
which destroyed us. 

There was nothing ahead of us but 
death. 

I turned to face Liu Mei. Maybe, by 
slapping her, by shaking her head, I could 
keep her awake. Soon the enemy would 
open the door. Then, perhaps, I could 
hurl her out, save her. 

But, God help me 1 I couldn't manage 
my hands and arms. All my strength 
could not lift them. I couldn't even take 
my arm from about the proud, graceful 
shoulders of Liu Mei. 

VVe were all three doomed. This was 
the end. 

I swayed. We swayed together, and I 
tiunk Liu Mei held me up, once or twice, 
when I would have fallen. My eyes 
seemed to bulge as I looked at that locked 
door, so that the thin tendrils of yrilow 
smoke became as large full-bodied py- 
thons — yellow, hideous, nightmare py- 
thons, shoving their coifs through a Gar- 
gantuan keyhole to quest for the three 
of us. 

I tiled again to tell Liu Mei that it 
didn’t matter. But now no words would 
pass my lips. My vocal cords would no 
longer serve me. 

^T^iHEN, unaccountably, I was down on 
the floor, on my belly: I couldn’t 
rise again. I couldn’t wriggle my fingers. 
Beside me Liu Mei was standing with her 
feet wide apart, proudly trying to die 
erect. 

The yellow film was everywhere. 


122 


TERROR TALES 


Kwan Tao still stood, weaving, sway- 
ing, looking at liu Mei. 

She must have been looking at him, too. 

But she preferred me, I was sure of 
that. 

It was something to take with me into 
the Hereafter, where our heavens would 
not cross, and we should never meet 
again. Unless the white of Liu Mei came 
to my heaven. 

How silly it was 1 But the yellow smoke 
caused it. 

And then my heart seemed to stop beat- 
ing for a moment. I was losing Liu Mei. 
Perhaps I had never had her. Her love, 
yes, a strange kind of love, but part of 
my life. Now the two of them, Kwan Tao 
and Liu Mei, staggering, almost falling, 
were moving toward each other. 

I saw them meet. 

His hands, by some superhuman power 
which I did not share, because I could not 
move mine at all, went out to her. They 
caught her left arm, drew the hand 
through his elbow. They stood side by 
side with this strange Chinese handclasp 
— which was the signal of foregiveness, 
of dose harmony of souls. 

And then, though both knew American 
kisses, because both had known the free- 
dom of American schools, they were both 
all China. 

They were rubbing their cheeks togeth- 
er, because the true Chinese did not kiss. 

They locked in each other’s arms. 
Then they fell, as a tree falls, and though 
I saw them strike the hard floor, I did not 
hear them, because of the ghastly roaring 
in my ears. 

They fell, sprawled supine, but held 
fast in each other’s arms, and my spirit 
writhed in agony as they fell. For I knew 
that in those last minutes both had for- 
gotten there had ever been such a one as 
Gordon Bais. 

1 took that awful, strange agony, with 
me into abysmal darkness, where there 


was nothing but the Niagara-like roaring 
in my ears. 

Darkness, through which shot long ten- 
drils of yellow smoke, engulfed me. 

T REGAINED consciousness in an ele- 
vator that was moving. Strange and 
horrible and unearthly it seemed. My last 
memory liad been of Kwan Tao and Liu 
Mei, falling side by side in the room of 
the yellow smoke, forgetting all about me. 

And here I was in a moving elevator. 
My hand was on the control. The cage 
was dropping. 

Save that Liu Mei was not here, I 
might just have entered it with her. But 
what hell there had been between ! 

My dazed, drugged wits began to come 
back. I noted the passing floors. I was 
dropping from the third to the second. I 
jammed the control, to stop the car at the 
ground floor. I ran out. I was crazy, I 
suppose, but it couldn’t end like this. I 
had to find Kwan Tao and Liu Mei. 

I screamed. I went racing through the 
corridor, down the stairs, heading for the 
tunnel where Miu Lei, Kwan Tao and I 
had suffered. 

I smashed headon against a wall where 
the door leading down had been. 

There was nothing. Just a smooth 
wall, with no sign that a stairway had 
ever existed here. I banged against that 
panel, shouting. I couldn’t have broken 
it down with a battering ram. The echoes 
of my cries, and my pounding, ran eerily 
all through the bouse. 

That was all. No other soiwids. 

Wild with terror, I raced back to the 
elevator. 

Half an hour later I had scoured that 
building from top to bottom, and had 
found not fwie living soul. Nor a dead 
body. And this, at the last, was the result 
of my madness: 

I had found no trace of Liu Mei or 
Kwan Tao, no hint that Liu Mei’s uncle 


A BRIDE FOR DEATH 


123 


had ever even lived here. Every trace of 
the things which had happened here had 
vanished. 

I found nothing. I satisfied mysetf that 
I was alone in this place that had become 
a mausoleum of dreadful mystery. I bat- 
tered against that mystery and could find 
no answer. I tried to find ways down into 
the warrens, and only cold blank panels 
met my every attempt, 

I was beatwi, whipped. 

I’d get officers. 2 dashed to the outer 
door, the only one in this place that wasn’t 
locked. I raced out, looking along the 
street for police. 

The door clicked shut, and locked, be- 
hind me. 

I couldn’t get back in. I banged against 
that door untS I broke my knnddes. I 
cried out Liu Mei’s name, and Kwan 
Tao’s. 

I sobbed with futile rage and despair. 

This was, I knew, the end. 

Nobody hi all Chinatown, throughout 


which my cries and battering must have 
been pla&ily heard, gave the slightest sign, 
until almost an hoftr of madness had 
passed. 

Then an old, a very old, Chinese gen- 
tleman came to me, looked up and said : 

"It is futile for the foreigner to batter 
his head against the stones. The dead 
must bury their dead. The past is gone. 
Nothing can be regained. The task of 
the Kving Is to forget quickly. In your 
place, my young friend, I should go back 
to my own. For never again will you see 
any of tb<»e you knew so well — no, not 
even though your police tear Chinatown 
into shreds.” 

It took a long time to convince me, but 
he did it, finally, and I went home, stag- 
gering like a drunken man, while fingers 
of yellow mist seemed eternally to be 
striking the lobes of my brain, pushing 
them a^inst the inside of my skull. 

Out of it all, I thought crazily, the yel- 
low smoke, at least, would be always with 
me.

THE BLACK CHAPEL 



J OE SEITZ had nsen from puddler to the control cab of the big ladle in less 
than three years. A hard worker, Joe Seitz was, and the hearth foreman had 
had his eye on him from the first. Before the first year was out he had seen 
that Joe was put in charge of furnace No. 12, and the only reason Joe hadn't risen 
steadily from that time onward was due to no fault of Joe's. It just happened 


that, at the time, there was no job open to 

There was a pause in the puddler boss’s 
upward progress that lasted almost two 
years. That two years strained Joe Seitz’s 
patience to the limit — and beyond. 

But Seitz had never workw anywhere 
but in the steel mills. He didn’t know 
anything else. He had to stick — ^but there 
was nothing to keep him from advancing 
up and away from the furnaces. Nothing, 
that is, except the fact that Ben Grady 
had the job he was in line for — and in 
two years’ time Ben never gave a sign of 
slipping, never made a mistake, never 
missed a day’s work. It was maddening. 

Joe Seitz went on a three weeks’ drunk 
to see if he couldn’t think of something 
to do about it. His brain was sli^gish 
and dull when he was sober. Only his 
motor-sensory system worked efficiently, 
seemingly, without the stimulant of alco- 
hol. But liquor loosened his imagination, 
gave him ideas. He emerged from the 
drunk with a fully-hatched scheme for 
removing Ben Grady from his path. 

Once in a while the big ladle got stuck 
right in the middle of the mill. It always 
happened when there was a full load in 
it — ^the weight of the molten metal in the 
huge cauldron making the accident more

likely to occur. There was a slight dent 
on the girder the conveyor traveled on, 
and the bump sometimes sprung a dog in 
the cut-off mechanism so that the circuit 
to tlie motor was broken. When tluit hap- 
pened, the man in tlie control cab had to 
walk out on tlie girder until he was di- 
rectly over the huge vat of boiling metal 
in order to re-set the cut-off dog. 

The mill did not have a night shift. 
Business was dull, and Seitz had no diffi- 
culty in avoiding the nightwatchman when 
he came to put his |Jan into operation. 
The plan was very simple. All Seitz did 
was to crawl out on the girder and grease 
it thoroughly at the spot that would be 
directly over the ladle the next time the 
dog slipped. . . . 

It did. Ben Grady died horribly, and 
Joe got his job. 

Ben had screamed, when his foot 
slipped on the grease Seitz had put on 
the girder. He had screamed again as his 
body plunged down through space into 
the ladle of white-hot molten metal. Joe 
Seitz remembered those screams. He was 
afraid that he would remember — and at 
intervals seem to hear them in all their 
brain-twisting horribleness — until he died. 


Lately it had been getting 
«t|r time the iadle {let^d the nhfldle ai

coiid look dowtt iitto the rat from

his tQwa .body |d«nging into that lash- 
ir^ fury of ^ea soup. He tried to teH 
himself that it was a mercifid death. 

That didn’t help ai^. Wfaawver the 
ladle reached the wl^re it used to 
get ^uck occaBionaUy, Joe could hear B«a 
Grady scream. The ladle didn’t get sftick 
any fnore. Bqo^s death had r^ulted hi 
the repair of tiiat dent in the gicd'er. 
Sonjething like that usually had to hz^jpen 
in ^ mSl b^ore a piece of maclimery

scream — ^the screams got louder eveay day.
