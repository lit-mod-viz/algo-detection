Publisher's Announcement

When the proposition of giving the Plot Robot and Genie to the liter»
my world was ﬁrst mnsidered, it was undersmod by The Gagnon Com
pany that the expense involved was to be conﬁned to the manufacture of
the original Plot Robot and Index for the General Formula, which although
easily adaptable to the creation of plot outlines for the love story melov
drama, will also with variation supply the necessary outline for any type
of story.

Despite the fact that the initial index book and robot were enthusir
astically received by bath professional and amateur writers who have
substantiated their endorsements by hundreds of glowing testimonial letters,
there was an immediate demand made upon us for special supplementary
formulas by those authors who are limited by their preference or by special!
ized markets, in the types of stories they wish to write. There were the
writers for the “pulps” who asked for a special formula and index for
ActionIAdventure and DetectivevMysbery stories. Other authors who
write novels and contribute to both “pulp" and "slick" magazines requested
a special index and formula for Romance without Melodrama. Motion
picture studio writers and a great many magazine writers also expressed
the desire for a comedy formula and index.

The Gagnon Company found itself confronted with the necessity of
investing mauy‘etimes the original outlay which was contemplated, in
order to satisfy the demands of those who are engaged in a literary pﬂr
fession. It therefore became necessary for us to further contract the
services of Mr. Hill and his vast collection of material accumulated over a
period of years, and which required untiring effort and intensive research,
with a staff of able assistants.

Notwithstanding the large and additional expense involved, The
Gagnon Company resolved to demonstrate its faith in the literary profession
and its profound interest in this marvelous work by proceeding to com!
plate the entire series of supplementary formulas and index books to meet
the popular demand. Like Mr. Hill, we believe that these Genie books
will shortly be recognized as a modem encyclopedia and reference work
which will be necessary in every Writer’s- library.

Respectfully,
ERNEST E. GAGNON.
