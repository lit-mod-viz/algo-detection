PLOT GENIE ROMANCE

The Nine Operations

Operation Number 1 (1 turn) supplies The Lover.

Operation Number 2 (1 turn) supplies The Beloved'Locale

Operation Number 3 (1 turn) supplies The Rival.

Operation Number 4 (1 turn) supplies The Love Obstacle.

Operation Number 5 (1 turn) supplies The Supporting Character.

Operation Number 6 (I cum) supplies Traits of Supporting
Character.

Operation Number 7 (I turn) supplies Eﬂort to Win.

Operation Number 8 (1 turn) supplies Threatened defeat.

Operation Number 9 (1 turn) supplies How love is lost or won,

?,It {will be observed that we have lists of both male and female lovers,
beloveds and rivals; It goes without: saying that if the author selects a
lover from the male list, he must take a rival from the male list: and a be'
loved from the female list, and vice versa.

In order that there be no confusion, special attention is directed to
Operation Number ‘3, which calls for a supportmg character. While there
are 180 numbers on the Robot disc, there are only ten of these supplemen'
tary or contributing characters which appear on page 80. Therefore, in
choosing these characters we observe only the last digit in the number
which the GenierRobot shows us through. the slot. For instance if he
gives us Number ’77, we would take supporting character '7; or if the num’
her is 180, we would take supporting character 10; if the number should be
64, we would choose supporting character 4 and so on.

Inasmuch as we also have three lists of character attributes or traits
beginning on page 81, it is necessary to observe a special rule in order to
determine which of the three lists we are to use. It is as follows:

If the number ends with 1 take list 1..
If the number ends With 2 take list 2.
If the number ends with 3 take list 3.
If the number ends with 4 take list; 1.
