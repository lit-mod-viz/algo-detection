Breaking Up The Old Associations

The "association of ideas" means nothing to the Plot Genie. The mention
of a cattle ranch does not suggest a cowboy, much less a cattle rustler, to him.
Nor does a mining camp suggest the prospector.

In glancing over six plot synapses which the Genie developed in thixty
minutes, I ﬁnd that it has placed a savage in a coliseum, a publisher cm a farm,
a bypnotist in a jungle, a baroness in a bowery, a chemist on the Amazon
River, and an acrobat in the South Sea Islands.

Nevertheless, any one of these six plot stru
developed into a story for either, novel or set”
indeed.

I contend that the idea of an author moping around in a trance While he
waits for a story—inspiration, is utterly absurd. Everything that ever did
happen, that is taking place, or that will occur in this world, was, is, or will
be nothing else than a combination of dramatic situation, character and back—
ground, The number of plot elements is known and limited. The nature
and proportion of those Which are used in the story formula, the order in
which they are introduced, and the reaction which results from the mixture,
is What provides an unlimited number 0f plots.

With the aid of the P10: Genie one does not have to wait for a rare ﬂash
of inspiration for a story. The Genie will provide a tomplete plot framework
