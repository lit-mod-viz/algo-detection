taken jealousy,” “Murderous adultery," ”Involuntary criminal love," and
"The loss of a loved one,"

In “Deception" conﬁdence is outraged.

Here is an example: One Week before Christmas a little tenement child
sees a lovely vase in a shop window. She longs to buy it for bat muther’s
Christmas gift. She enters the store and timidly inquires the price of the vase.

“More than you can pay," gruffly answers the shopkeeper.

The child holds out ﬁve pennies and says, “If I bring you ﬁve more. win
you let me have it?”

The shopkeeper winks at his assistant and answers. “Sure."

All that week. the child tries in every way to exam ﬁve pennies. Every
time shapasses the window she admires the lovely vase; Christmas Eve: a
kind neighbor gives the girl ﬁve pennies for running an errand. She is over-
joyed and as she hurries along she visualizes her mother's delight on Christmas
morning
