CONCLUSION 133

some dramatic situation subordinate to the dominant
one, but, none the less real; the turns and changes of
the general action will affect him in some particular
way, and the consequences, to him, of each vicissitude.
of each effort, of each act and dénouement, contribute
to the spectatot's ﬁnal impression. If the Third Actor,
for instance, be a Disputed Object, it becomes neces-
sary to take into account his ﬁrst and his last posses-
sor, the diverse relations which he has successively had
with them, and his own preferences. If he appear as
Inspirer or Instigator, we must consider (aside from
his degree of consciousness or unconsciousness, 01
frankness or dissimulation, and of Will proper) thc
perseverance which he brings to his undertaking; if he
be unconscious, the discovery which he may make of
his own unconsciousness; if he be a deceiver,
the discoveries which others may make of his dis-
simulation (“others” here meaning perhaps a single
character, perhaps the spectator). These re-
marks also apply to the “Instrumental” role; and
not alone these remarks, but those also which concern
the “Object,” are applicable to the Role-Lien.

I have already observed that this last role, and the
tﬁple hypostasis of the Third Actor, may be repro-
duced in numerous exemplars within one play. On the
other hand, two, three, or all four of them may be
fused in a single ﬁgure, (Lien-Instrumental, Object-
Instigator, Instrument—Lien—Object, etc), combinations
which present themselves, like the combinations of the
Situations, already considered, in varied array. Some-
times the hero who unites in himself these divers roles
plays them simultaneously— perhaps all of them
toward an individual or group, perhaps one or
several of them toward an individual or group, and
another role wherein these roles mingle, toward
some other individual or group; sometimes these var-
ious roles will be successively played toward the
