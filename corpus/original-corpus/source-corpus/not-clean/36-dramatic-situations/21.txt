FIRST SITUATION
SUPPLICATION

(The dynamic elements technically necessary are :—
a Persecutor, a Suppliant and a Power in authority,
whose decision is doubtful).

Among the examples here offered will be found
those of three slightly differing classes. In the ﬁrst,
the power whose decision is awaited is a distinct
personage, Who is deliberating; shall he yield, from
motives of prudence or from apprehension for those
he loves, to the menaces of the persecutor, or rather,
from generosity, to the appeal of the persecuted? In
the second, by means of a contraction analogous to
that which abbreviates a syllogism‘ to an enthymeme,‘
this undecided power is but an attribute of the persecu-
tor himself,—-a weapon suspended in his hand; shall
anger or pity determine his course“! In the third
group, on the contrary. the suppliant element is divided
between two persons, the Persecuted and the Interces-
sor, thus increasing the number of principal char-
acters to four.

These three groups (A, B, C) may be subdivided as
follows:

A (1)—Fugitives Imploring the Powerful for Help

‘Syllogism: A reckoning all together, d reasoning; to bring

at once before the mind; to infer; conclude. As “Every virtue
is laudable; kindness is a virtue; therefore kindness is laudable.”

Enthymeme: An argument consisting of only two propositions;
an antecedent and its consequent; a syllogism with one premise
omitted; as “We are dependent, therefore we should be humble."
