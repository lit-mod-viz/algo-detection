FOURTH SITUATION 29

altogether. Let us, for the moment, amuse ourselves
by counting some of those which have been forgotten.

A father’s death avenged upon the brother of the
avenger. Upon his sister. Upon his mistress (or, in
the case of a feminine avenger, upon her lover, for
each of the cases enumerated has its double, according
to the sex of the avenger). Upon his wife. Upon his
son. Upon his daughter. Upon his paternal uncle.
Upon his maternal uncle. Upon his paternal or mater—
nal grandfather; his paternal or maternal grand-
mother.’ Upon half-brother or half-sister. Upoﬁ a
person allied by marriage (brother-in-law, sister-in-
law, etc.) or a cousin. These numerous variations may
of course be successively repeated for each casez—the
avenging of a brother, a sister, a husband, a son, a
grandfather, and so on.

By way of variety, the vengeance may be carried out,
not upon the person of the criminal himself, but upon
some one dear to him (thus Medea and Atreus struck
Jason and Thyestes through their children), and even
inanimate objects may take the place of victims.
