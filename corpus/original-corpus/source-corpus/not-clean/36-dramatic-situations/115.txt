110 THIRTY—SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

Wlth any other tie, however weak, or even leave nothing
in its place, and a play of the type of Situation V, with
all its terrors, will still remain. Attempt, on the con-
trary, to curtail the other interest, the enmity—to
soften the vengeance—and to substitute any other
element of diﬁ'erence or leave their place unﬁlled, and
what will remain of tragic emotion? Nothing.

We have, then, reason to conclude that love—an ex-
cellent motif for comedy, better still for faree—sweet
or poignant as it may be in stories read in solitude,
of which we can fancy ourselves hero or heroine, love
is not, in reality, tragic, despite the virtuosity which
has smetimes succeeded in making it appear so, and
despite the prevalent; opinion of this age of emtomania,
which is now approaching its end.
