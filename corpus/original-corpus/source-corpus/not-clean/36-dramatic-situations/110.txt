TWENIY-EIGHTH SITUATION I ' 105

(Rochard, 1910); all fairy-plays, since the “Zéim” of
Gozzi. In ﬁne, a sort of steeple-chase process adapts
itself to this situation, but the chase is not one in which
several rival steeds and riders engage; throughout its
course but a single couple enters upon it, to end at the
shining goal with the usual somersault.

C (1)—Marriage Forbidden on Account of the
Young Woman’s Previous Betrothal to Another:—
“Il Re Pastore” by Metastasio; and other pieces without

D (l)—A Free Union Impeded by the Opposition
of Relatives:—"Le Divorce” (Bourget, 1908); “Les

(2)—Family Affection Disturbed by the Parents-
in-Lawz—“Le Roman d'Elise” (Richard, 1885); “Le
Poussin" (Guiraud, 1908).

E—By the Incompatibility of Temper of the
Lovers:—“Montmartre” (Frondaie, 1911). “Les Anng
du Divorce" (Biollay) belongs both to E and to D 2.

F—Love—but enough of this! What are we doing,
co-spectators in this hall, before this pretended situation?
Upon the stage are our two young people, locked in
close embraces or conventionally attitudinizing in purely
theatrical pom. What is there in all this worth remain-
