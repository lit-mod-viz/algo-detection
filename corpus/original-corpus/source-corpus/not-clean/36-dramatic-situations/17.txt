12 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIbNS

Unter den Linden or beneath the electric‘ﬁights of the
Boulevards; as it was in the ages of "fan’s hand-to-
hand struggle with the wild beasts ofwvood and moun-
taiii, and as it will be, indubitably, 1n the most inﬁnite-
ly distant future, since it is with these thirty-six emo—
tions—no more—that we color, nay, we comprehend,
cosmic mechanism, and since it is from them that our
theogonies and our metaphysics are, and ever will be,
constructed; all our dear and fanciful “beyonds;"—-
thirty~six situations, thirty-six emotions, and no more.

It is, then, comprehensible that in viewing upon the
stage the ceaseless mingling of these thirty-six emo-
tions, :1 race or nation arrives at the beginning of its
deﬁnite self—consciousness; the Greeks, 111deed,began
their towns by laying the foundations of a theater. It
is equally natural that only the greatest and most com-
plete civilizations should have eyplwed their own partic-
ular conception of the drama, and that one of these
new conceptions should be revealed by each new evolu-
tion of society, whence ariées the dim but faithful ex-
pectation of our own age, waiting for the manifestation
of its own drainatic ideals, before the cenotaphs of an
art wh1ch has long been, apparently for commercial
reasons, almost non-existent.

In ﬁne, after having brought together all these dra-
matic “points of view,” we shall see, as in a panorama,
the great procession of our race, in characteristic
motley costumes: —Hindu kings in their chariots,
Chinese gallants playing their mandores, nude heroes
of Hellas, legendary knights, adventurers of sword and
cape, golden-tressed princesses, nymphs sparkling with
gems, shy maids with drooping eyelashes, famed
courtesans, chaste Athenian virgins, priestly confes-
sors, chattering gossips, gurus expounding religious
ideas, satyrs leaping upon goats’ feet, ugly slaves,
peris, horned devils in disguise, lisping Tartaglias, gar-
rulous Graciosos, Shakespearian clowns, Hugoesque
