26 THIRTY—SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

of our Third Situation we might evoke him at every
step, this'villain and his profound schemes which not
infrequently make us smile. Don Salluste in “Ruy-
Bias,” Iago in “Othello," Guanhumara in “Burgraves,”
Homodei in “Angelo," Mahomet in the tragedy of that
name, Leontine in “Heraclius,” Maxime in “La Tragedie
de Valentinien," Emire in “Siroés,” Ulysses in
“Palamedes.”

C—Professional Pursuit of Criminals (the coun-
terpart of which will be found in the Fifth Situation,
Class A) :—“Sherlock Holmes” (Comm Doyle) ;
“Vidocq” (Bergerat, 1910); “Nick Carter” (Busson
and Livet, 1910).

Frequently used though this situation has been in
our day, many an ancient case awaits its rejuvenes-
cence, many a gap is yet to be ﬁlled. Indeed, among
the bonds which may unite avenger and victim, more
than one degree of relationship has been omitted, as
well as the majority of social and business ties. The
list of wrongs which might provoke reprisal is far from
being exhausted, as we may assure ourselves by enum-
erating the kinds of offenses possible against persons
or property, the varying shades of opinion of opposing
parties, the different ways in which an insult may take
effect, and how many and what sort of relationships
may exist between Avenger and Criminal. And these
questions concei'n merely the premises of the action.

To this we may add all the turns and bearings, slow
or instantaneous, direct or tortuous, frantic or sure,
which punishment can take, the thousand resources
which it offers, the points at which it may aim in its
deadly course, the obstacles which chance or the
defendant may' present. Next introduce various
secondary ﬁgures, each pursuing his own aims, as in
life, intercrossing each other and crossing the drama—
and I have sufﬁcient esteem for the reader's capabili-
ties to develop the subject no further.
