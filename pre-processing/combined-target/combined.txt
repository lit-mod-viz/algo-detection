who going marry mercedes girtons voice dropped something like awe
mercedes tesoro

carmen tickled death
said something mercedes paid little attention well thunder guanamans good earnest arent rest life guess muttered girton strange solemnity come upon
silence followed little heavy comfortable silence two men understand perfectly
hemmett thinking pleasantly luck come old friend girton thrice started humming little native lovesong thrice caught self stopped

went perfectly solid altara stared gentle astonishment girton smiled suppose there connection two thing
rious new big employer labor influencing employee vote ferrata doubt hemmett said slowly
although whole industrial boom rather queer mind
almost thing queer likely come
see happening minute steve
guanamas new factory furnishing million dollar worth supply every month european army thatjuld made cheaply bought cheaply united state carried europe cheaply theyre made say
thats fact isnt cried girton
well although never given much serious thought last week unquestionably fact
ive infernally busy tobacco business ive never considered matter recently fact certain european nation paying need stuff made
well matter money flow fac tory start time

began time canita argosy
confounded pacifist went air decided harbor needed fort big enough defend two panama canal jammed sen ate
fact whole business think seemed begin
long halfminute gazed gloom
stephen said hemmett suffering native tendency hookworm late year
body putting something got altogether ive wondering without mentioning ever since realized altara elected without reason world electing steve particu larly since infernal radical party got majority senate well president
whats bosh
there nothing suppose girton laughed shortly
queer per sisted
factory crop ping suddenly
national engine work must seventy eighty million dollar worth capital least
concern anyway ostensibly mighty corporation partly native organized purpose turning perfect form turbine engine
must mean busi ness steve
theyve bought hundred acre point opposite fort paid tremendous price land
theyre employing thousand men yes walled
fifteenfoot fence whole place guard every gate
every man shop sworn secrecy hemmett said mildly theyre manufacturing engine device still dead secret patent yet issued several country
isnt necessarily criminal even bit odd

wish see senor girton send gentleman said briefly
man departed return another native guanama thirty second later
visitor stranger small slim immaculate linen proceeded straight girton smiling bowing extended envelope
senor altara president senor purred
answer convey backed away girton whis tling softly switched one electric light set little tropical fern jar elbow
whistling still ripped envelope drew official sheet said even continued whistle read stopped whistling

stephen girton looked
back tell ive resigned said bitterly
want door instead kicked edge terrace quick
dont like face mad little whiteclad man vanished
hemmett laughed annoyedly
childish steve maybe snorted exsecretary
wasnt job
plenty money know
idea thing way infernal thanklessness whole proposition queemess hemmett nodded
thats impressed first said
yesterday novedades editorial possibility new cabinet mentioned impos sibility getting secretary war guanama could even continue work stopped little butler approaching
senor enrico ricoro nounced
see senor together girton hemmett gazed butler
rich ricoro latter asked
tobacco ricoro senor send hemmett directed alone directed puzzled little smile old friend
thats queer est thing day isnt call
supposed ricoro deadly enemy class ever since mess tried merge tobacco interest girton muttered
cant two week ago gave interview effect ricoro combine would never touch psst ricoro ugly grunting little guanaman millionaire past every penny wealth tied tobaccoleaves ego swollen several time normal size oily bowing person beamed pleasure unutterable
held hand girton hemmett shook wonderingly
drew another wicker chair proffered case really remarkable cigar
rubbed hand happily lunged business moment unusual performance guana man commercial circle savor orient thing
astonish come chuckled
pero one make mistake yes
thing fool ish
forgive consider forgiven ricoro hemmett said curiously
pardon argosy
social call business visit permit since come home senor ricoro said engaging smile growing even broader
sit terrace survey city wonderful
speak time pleasant little business matter better yet
say might depend business matter certainty chuckled amia ble gentleman
senor think find pleasant
come permission buy extensive tobacco interest ably con ducted buy cash senor ricoro went smoothly
fence senor
know know plantation cost perhaps one million half dollar united state theyve paying dandy terest two million said girton
reason senor come pay cold cash say two million quarter said surprising ricoro
shall paper drawn evening conclude deal may call morning explosion dynamite center terrace might startled little little
ricoro absolutely tobaccopoor garded ready cash ricoro scorned splendid holding two year ago
steve girton kicked hemmetts foot darkness
hemmett said simply nix comprehend senor ricoro inquired
nice offer dont think well accept
one thing talking actual spotcash senor cried ricoro
ten morning national bank guanama money shall handed gold wish aha
another thing dont care sell
tobaccoland valuable ever tariff united state change going val uable still offer enough nearly two million onehalf said ricoro
yes whats idea girton rasped
somebody found gold plantation tobacco going join highcostofliving performer way dont sus pect
simply prospered wish increase holding senor ricoro waited silently giving vague impression feeling wounded hemmett girton conversed wordless telepathic fashion come men known understood many long trying year
ricoro seeking course give affair aspect ordinary big business proposition
yet intelligent tenyearold boy conversant gua naman affair must known well something else
clairvoyant might able delve ricoros brain find answer certainty mained holding worth two onehalf million ricoro held value hemmett girton
youve sprung suddenly first glance look good ricoro said hemmett
trust mag nates used slinging million around like cigar
frank say offered three million accept evening
weve week think week senor well
native drew deep disappointed breath
american
excellent senor say echoed
still hoped close evening
handsome offer senor darned handsome make one suspicious girton smiled utter candor
there something ductively lovely wouldnt close truck gold street
thats weve lived year guanama final senor evening rate evening slipped remarkable millionaire bounced foot shrugged shoulder disgustedly quickly smiled
evening hemmett asked sharply
evening particular one
pay crazy price bacco ricoro spreading palm deprecat ingly retreated behind bland smile
trick peculiarly guanaman bafflingly chinese
mean anything world nothing
case seemed indicate unduly suspicious inoffensive millionaire whose sole desire make richer smile persisted long enough convince ricoro done talking business made perfunc tory remark nothing particular took leave
street heard hum departing motor
hemmetts grin quizzical asked blaze make steve nothing unless whelming trust coming buy tobacco country ricoro heard borrowed enough corner supply get couldnt borrow two half million one lump know mused girton token know country well doubt there one man beside esteemed fatherjjnlaw able hand sum cash perhaps two minute smoked pondered
there something behind offer hemmett announced
something immediate connection tobacco business sound silly isnt steve
result living long guanama suppose thought queer election queer thing evening
there reason every thing happens little old world boy there visible reason anybody wanting take tobaccoland fifty sixty per cent actually worth
hence reason invisible moment steve girton late secretary war leaned back chair chuckled little
hemmett might bristling sus picion affair could quite understand girton bristle
one hour back stephen become engaged adorable girl entire universe one state rather hard bristle intangible thing
think youre ned said quietly enough
think ricoro brainstorm kind belief guanama monopolize earth tobacco market
actually dqife form little group wealthy men make pool two million half voice trailed
third time minute hemmetts little butler
william jones announced time
see senor jones hemmett echoed rather loudly
jones hush girton said quietly
thats argosy
mystery jones ned must name william
thats chap landed last month living whole floor new hotel ever since fellow ride around big white car brought ive heard
earth want find girton laughed
joiiess form appeared lighted doorway moved toward
hemmett switched another light two examined jones shook hand
well dressed conventional feature might anything prosperous small tradesman head corporation
seemed faculty looking like absolutely definite type crowd occurred girton one would passed fifty time without knowing existed
yet queer assured ring voice said gentleman pleasure making acquaintance great
bring news news hemmett said
news indeed smiled jones
leave guanama
chapter iii

one explanation capable holding water
fifteen second back known ridiculously confident fashion ushering guanama done much make
delivered self bowed dropped chair laughed quite happily yes mad fast enough

hemmett jones laughed
leave think steamer sail one morrow please jones girton asked amusedly

bramin street
foot plodding
instinct turned foot pathway porch
stinct caused hand fumble familiar doorknob without knocking instinct led across threshold

due hunger within hunger burned

otherwise tragedy swear true
black pool boarded shall never find solace sound sleep con ralph milne farley slid foot foremost stygian water strange story tinue dream thing swamp dark thing took life friend martin aylethorp
time knew peace
thats mockery
friend martin slump period wrote living invited east sole reason thought wed find soothing tranquil lity home
cottage near mill brook outside concord
martin rea soned would enjoy tramping prioh ards wood fall new england countryside take mel low beauty conducive easing shattered nerve
recall preparation coming seems like grim joke
careful rigging room insure quiet even sent town noiseless portable place regular typewriter
martin arrived late gust sick man
tall mally lean figure emaciated eye sunken behind spec tacles smile remembered habitual upon countenance seemed drowned inward melan choly
smoked much held cigarette gray spiral rose tip unevenly trembling hand
best conceal con cern changed appearance
working novel try ing hold librarian job dur ing day
gathered completely done lately found impossible continue short story work
amazing creative effort man martin peculiar temperament drained dry sucked vitality though night given visit vampire suc cubus rather writing
isnt bad comparison martin aylethorp wrote weird fiction
wrote intensely theory mine writing fantasy took author work field
person certainly seemed good proof contention
best
carefully avoided topic conversation might relate work
show recent stuff
locked away reference book magazine
allow speak book
coaxed resting argued bullied notion getting outdoor exercise interspersed plenty sleep
week gradually augented menu meal time encouraged eat
worked
time september passed regained mal attitude health back par
incidentally self gained six pound
soon proposed series daily hike local wood
martin took idea firt time learned boy often spent summer rela tives concord
seemed eager health improved revisit famil iar landmark
although cottage year amazed unsuspected secret countryside uncovered
soon acting guide played meekly following visitor local shrine
physical wellbeing increased normal interest correspond ingly rearoused
within several week talking story plot end month literally champing bit eager get back harness tale
although held long could insisted allowed use typewriter daily jaunt filled talk proposed work plan story
hike interest converged disastrously
one morning breakfast came room yanked chair
come urged
sun high going little ploring jaunt
asked
havent covered local showplace yet
showplace replied smiling
secret
ill wager there spot youve never seen mile away
bottomless pool doubt said
kind place
martin assumed look melodra matic grimness
called bottomless pool whispered whats gag
serious
swamp south prichards wood
remem ber gang explored one summer stayed kid
strange place george graf warned stay away told wed
grownup ever spoke called place bottomless pool
mentioned walden pond concord place thoreau wrote nature study know said bottomless
lie hollow hill nei ther inlet outlet yet water always fresh
spring subter ranean river cause doubt glacier created queer freak hereabouts
said govern ment engineer came walden take sounding spot pond deeper longest soundingwires
thats meant bottomless pool said one prichards wood similar
well warning whetted interest spot see
kid like guess
got together fishline gang could lay hand tied together lead weight one end
lowered sluggish black pool swamp
never struck bottom
well sort scared creepy place took warning seriously
never gone back
last summer concord gradually lost track boy
hear something letter sam dewey disappearing swamp following year
sam lad suggested take sound ings
course dont think dis appearance anything interest bottomless pool although might
foolhardy george graf warning hinted something people fallen
listened sort tepid interest
martin seemed genuinely enthusiastic
let take look place urged
really weird spot ive got hunch there story somewhere
rose obediently put boot
solitary wandering avoided mucky wooded depth old swamp humor guest acceded request struck south soon reached swamp edge
rprfe swamp awful
limb dead tree interred sun light wan ghost beam haunted murky avenue morass
rotten log slimy creeper covered slough quick sand bog floun dered martin heel
instinct boyhood guided aright avoided gray bubbling patch deeper ooze
remarked voicing amazement year place seemed unchanged
first physical difficul tie encountered impressed
gradually however waded deeper dark swamp became aware le tangible thing
place looked like death smelled death rottenness decay
moss fungoid growth clung gray treetrunks bloated toadstool reared pulpy death head fat stemmed neck rising ooze
bubbling swampjuices beneath boot silent kind sound rather noise seemed intensify silence time part
wind hanging branch saw neither bird animal depth
still life soon struck rickety old fence wound seemingly haphaz ard manner lower swamp
strange story martin beckoning turned followed meandering wooden line came willow tree bent ground
deep dark shade ancient bough lay bottomless pool
small barely six foot across black
jet black water motion le
pool like large blinking eye odious green scum filming pupil
thats highly fantastic comparison something pool pearance inspired thought
strange somehow unnatu ral
wasnt right small pool swamp certainly thing looked evil natural formation ive ever seen
martin stood looking depth moment
water black murmured strange presence lence human voice always hushed
water black ink said
dipped one hand pool brushing scummy froth cupping ebon drop see
water black decayed matter gave veined appear ance striated dark green rill

asked martin
nodded

wouldnt sure reaction
set ting story

staring silent water wondered generating impulse turn run away
nerve bad
hastily averted gaze

martin shouted
really spoke normal tone voice contrast previous hushed mur murs shout

martin leaped forward grabbed
tremendous tug hurled back bank
water coursed body warm blood scalded deep wound side

martin swore softly daubed iodine cut beneath shirt swore loudly pain
neither ready comment sud denly martin turned head darted edge pool

another lizard larger first rose surface pool
bobbed seemed beckon
martin scowled deeply pointed hookgashed side growled single word bait
bait
bait
lizard
snorted disgustedly
way home marveled incident
argued changed dry garment debated bandaged side mused luncheon speculated wildly long afternoon
martin ever imaginative dozen fantastic theory
fished depth bot tomless pool
hook
thing lived pool
maybe thing
somethings fished men
boy hadnt george graf bottomless pool hinted disappearance
hadnt sam dewey vanished near swamp
something pool set trap men putting lizard hook using wire line
bot tomless pool led inner earth life
thus martin expressed halfseriously
offered obvious ply
hook line used fisherman
fallen water
perhaps lizard accidentally impaled upon hook risen surface died brought line
grabbed got hooked snag entangling line end water pulled pool
second lizard saw
martin insinuated gently
silent
martin grave moment fore continuing
remember boy fishing pickerel assabet
boat rocked
nine time smart fisher man
hooked big pickerel day pickerel hooked
gave uncomprehending glance
asked
line got wrapped around foot fish pulled boat laughed
graver tone went fish wanted catch fisherman tangle line
take bot tomless pool example
meant capture whoever whatever fish ing grab lizard bait allow drag toward pool
pull line attach wire windlass rope
let hook
sudden release might precipitate fisherman board water tangle
quickly winding windlass haul fellow surface
thats absurd began
there fisherman bottomless pool cant besides hooked side feel evening
interjected martin sar castically

spent midnight hour typewriter taking note story
neither however spoke bottomless pool
next day awoke slight fever

martin assuring self utterly helpless announced going walk
like interview old timer around place told
myth
forget remark made know tried laugh interest
secretly much disturbed
dream pleasant bottomless pool figured rather prominently

seemed almost unnaturally interested per son temperament greatly influenced imaginative concept
left purported mission investigation spent long day dozing dreaming
late afternoon returned greeted brusquely went room

poor father concluded page science question answer department conducted benefit reader per tinent query modern scientific fact
space limited undertake answer three question letter
hood correspondence received make impractical also promise immediate answer every case
however question general interest receive careful attention
organic compound editor science question answer surprised day find chemical formula cane sugar milk sugar seems little odd since different sweetening power
little chemistry ive always understood different substance must differ ent formula
gloucester virginia
study sugar related com pound belongs realm organic chemistry compound carbon
incredibly numerous compound containing carbon due latter remarkable ability hook almost anything chain ring formation
sugar basically foimula given put together different way resulting difference taste appearance chemical activity
atom general sugar molecule arranged merely chance could different combination
dozen known however
organic chemistry formula mean nothing
simply indicate pro portion weight carbon hydrogen oxygen
true indication compo sition organic chemist us structural formula show exactly molecule put together
show change position atom sugar quite different
typical example common alcohol formula methyl ether poisonous
look chemist structural formula see different
alcohol methyl ether difference hooking make difference tween liquid drunk one cannot besides many differ nces
phenomenon sleep editor science question answer sleeping explained
brain sleep heart lung
brooklyn
phenomenon sleep lately much clarified
intensive biochemical search revealed rhythm life
pulsates much like wave
pulsation period activity rest
activity drive body chemical process one direction toward fatigue
state characterized presence excess phosphate blood
complete cycle organic organism must rest
allows chemical process reverse prepare stretch activity
fortunately however nature pro vided heart lung different system rest period brain muscle bodj cell general
necessary animal ganism cannot survive extended period rest heart lung stomach
organ work rest pulsate rapidly
heartbeat heart rest fraction second
breath lung take short nap total amount rest day time heart give body lie sleep
canal mar editor science question answer discussion canal mar
isnt definitely known whether
one would think easily observed phenomenon would settled long ago
madison wisconsin
strange say authenticity martian canal proved
shiaparelli vho admittedly sharpeyed announced saw fine line marking mar called canali unfortunately italian word far suggestive transposed english
shiaparelli meant channel manmade canal
since bi time discussion waxed furious
famous astronomer corroborated discovery
equally famous one denied existence
lately becoming gen erally credited regular numerous marking occur shiaparelli lowell claimed see
experiment conducted laboratory indicate human eye mind tendency connect faint spot marking wholly imaginary straight line
case viewing mar tele scope image hazy best
literally take conscious straining eye distinguish even larger marking
socalled canal limit visibility may subjective imagined rather objective seen
photography failed reveal mythical canal
claim made justifiably der best condition eye sensitive photographic plate still positive evidence either side
perhaps sure check grossing question man find way traverse space explore mar
filterable virus editor science question answer ive noticed filterable virus called living liquid farley story recently
science fiction aside truly alive
san francisco calif
strictly speaking answer probably
filterable virus seem quality subtle poison living matter
seems disease like mosaic disease tobacco plant silkworm jaundice produce lethal substance able interfere metabolism healthy tissue
unlike culture germ virus filterable finest porcelain filter indicating must colloidal composition
whatever sub stance reinfect tissue disease produced composed germ microorganism know present
either potency due credibly tiny living organism matched size larger molecule superpowerful poison undetect able quantity poison mass pro toplasm unthinkably greater mass

hidden wonder hugo gernsback greatest source wonder see indeed know hidden going known progress long tortuous road future
contemplate world let say year ago day caveman truth must beoome apparent yet often overlooked appreci every manmade work modern skyscraper intricate chronometer today existence year ago integral part
raw material today
nothing added wealth earth last year possible exception falling meteorite
yet humanity time nothing race animal emerging long sojourn savagery
every thing spell civilization today hidden ancestor
safe presume always thus call modern today hidden many thing ancestor hidden year ago
true last iso year thing revealed human race year preceding epoch even yet scratched surface possibility nature come anywhere near limit progress
immeasurable treasure surrounding treasure power treasure foodstuff treasure necessary lifebut use know get
late hundred year ago people england well pennsylvania burning wood winter keep warm always done yet built house right top coal vein assumed form rock
took humanity year arrive point burned rock found would give heat
course sound ludicrous today yet foolish insist must burn coal order make steam turn used run turbine turn dynamo produce current light electric lamp
process lose exactly available power energy turned light rest escape heat loss
untold source power lying right door yet unaware
key unlock secret atomic power instance every single pebble backyard could turned enough heat light power keep house supplied year come
course havent got key yet hidden
yet need far atomic power
prob ably scientist suspected many year jnany source power surrounding yet harnessed
instance gravitation pressure light electric energy come direct sun addition radiant heat vast source power yet little understood
take generation steady plodding discover hidden source power
one instance probably become tremendous factor future socalled cosmic ray recently discovered professor milliken
know practically nothing yet little seen suspect terrific power day tapped benefit humanity
source energy created difference tempera ture around never tapped
recently french man proposed unique plan whereby tremendous amount power taken ocean simply taking advantage small variation temperature existing sea level little distance surface
tremendous source solar heat tide wind others although known might well hidden away yet sense make use
yet offer enough power supply need entire planet
fabulous wealth made coming generation tap hidden unused source power add natural resource without ever fearing least deplete source
coal oil stance day give whereas solar heat tide radiant heat force keep giving energy literally million year come
made machine would enable look right wall colony house
could see life lived hear obtain harmony sight sound
human termite foreword latter part april visit new york entertained tae evening mr hugo gernsback
done honor dinner home instead formal surroundings one great metropolitan hotel
dinner three dis cussed various phase social life new york
admitted city charm personally care live amid constant din con fusion
gernsback laughed said come see frequently
everytime come secure idea several story admit replied
example large block conversation stenographer hand tained conversation
time must admit idea story original
hard thing get new idea
one absolutely ori ginal idea make story possible host pond ered moment walked library picked book
idea story
book white ant maurice maeterlinck
tell ter mite suggests conduct individual ant may con trolled cen tral intelligence mitary one large animal
gernsback halfseriously suggested life may way human may controlled central intelli gence
felt may count individual different part world often thing almost much life greater part made possible previous effort worker may knowingly laid foundation achievement
therefore due appreciation work sciencefiction dedicated mau rice maeterlinck author white ant david keller
time
example went elisha gray alexander gra ham bell working independently arrived simultaneously idea telephone submitted invention patent office hour
darwin charles buell announced different part globe conclusion regarding natural selec tion practically time
let read part book fifteen minute read sat easy chair closed eye
finally said take book read
big story
give one idea
work detail yes replied good deal time ready typewriter
written white heat fin ished le two week
gernsback kind enough say best science fiction story
quite naturally lieves could written without idea
editor way nfortu nately true
edi
conceited enough feel even idea needed write story
keller infers editor could never written human ter mite even though idea
editor cheer fully admits
matter fact author could written marvelous story keller editor
least way one story came written

day tje take pleasure presenting lieve keller greatest work far
story cause furore endless discussion seems certain
embrace tremend ous subject incidentally enters realm yet little understood even foremost scientist
may sure greatest mystery surround even permeate body solved next hundred year
instance maeterlinck asks book white ant intelli gence governs body
cut finger ignorant person say start healing
process healing mean instant breach made skin innumerable thousand nute white body called corpuscle immediately rush breach start fighting germ enter opening new cell built immediately close breach
neither human intelligence human anything process time within human body
know intelligence evidently directs thing intelli gence one know
whether little understood socalled soul something else owe know
indeed impossible mem bers entire human race must considered simply separate cell great organism
fused homogeneous body nothing intervening air separate
may true could illustrated many way
war instance quite often change entire nation overnight magic also change lifetime habit ideal people almost quickly
religion fanaticism passion similar evidence transmission entire nation nation many instance idea without visible com munication individual
thing may explained purely logical natural reasoning without resorting supernatural indeed author pointed memorable work
certainly work commend earnest tention every thinking questioning person
human termite question scientific world solved men souderman trained laborer world unknown willing sacrifice everything obtain answer one mystery life
something souderman uch worker
price paid great
everything abandoned
lifetime spent attain one little fact
yet men feel attainment one addition store human knowledge sufficient reward sacrifice
suppose one man spent life time cancer cell merely studying actually living
would think nothing else waking hour dream sleep
month month year year would become intimate enemy middleaged
cer cell would become separate race living crea tures parasitic enemy mankind
would learn history folklore tradition
cancer race would slowly reward effort allowing glimpse separate intelli gence comparable human specie
time would pas might old age would come still secret prevention would remain mystery
last resort would deliberately inoculate cer cell make body laboratory could make last final effort gain insight soul individual cell group telligence cancer mass
others would con sider insane recluse introverted study year unfortunate dying disease spent year study
yet even death bed might whisper great truth would make human race free parasite kill one every four reach age forty
surely man would die happy thought contributed one fact would make life race happier
great sacrifice
every generation produce one voluntary victim

poor fellow wonderful linguist hated bug kind made hundred phono graph record let study comfort house cape town
odd

soudermans question felt last would able tell whether termite able think
action pointed intellectual pro ce
course fabre think felt observation would made change opinion
course instinct may become complicated possible man intelligence simply composed million complicated automatic instinctive act
learned language termite
least thought
remember said philologist cape town simply knew language know language ant
poor fellow went wild
said believed oldest language world parent tongue human speech
isolated root word estab lished derivation finally wrote glossary com posed five hundred word
wanted
made hundred record promised would finance book ready publish went back work determined learn use new language soon possible
experimented least two year
example took sharp auger bored hole one inch wide wall house acoustophone attached
able look house hear house note reaction opening hole
usual number soldier came formed solid ring around side hole
worker came either dropping globule quid cement small piece sand
within hour opening closed
order given
supreme mentality realize danger close opening giving order
procured ice machine literally froze tried freeze small portion wall
ther mometer wall result
termite simply rushed large mass fermenting mould spot spite effort kept temperature point could live
intelligence instinct
would bore detailed study experiment
last came definite conclusion
termite nervous system
able understand certain sound originate certain sound
sound used way resemble speech least served mean communication
sociability conversation seemed consist mainly order
power issued order million occupant one termitary said yes sir obeyed

termitary two language
one simple used giving order
vastly complicated imper fectly understood soldier worker apparently used mean communication tween intelligence different colony house
johanson hated insect
naturally could stand thought ant crawling came termite colony give credit staying two week

mean command language spoken warrior lab orers rather language used central intelligence talking
surely know heart least enough could make phonographic record perhaps better still teach philologist could make written language
another idea developed course next year
feel work cut short incomplete without effort made actually find see one thing whatever might call head actual intellectual force behind animal call giant termite
feel something might learned one actually captured
knowledge superior perhaps compromise might reached
first idea good one replied old scientist
work done need repeated
many year life spent endeavor learn peculiar language
one repeated work would simply time wasted
easy matter make phonograph record could also teach
perhaps enlist aid real linguist work grammar vocabulary
think
regard second sugges tion open interesting possibility
course realize left africa way felt one know secret convinced giant termite going could stop
killed johanson
course would call coincidence feel tremendous effort gigantic intellect preserve secrecy
tried imagine thing looked like failed
perhaps one could located captured look impos sible
course could drill termi tary blast dynamite thus might get bottom animal might would result death
perhaps psychic found everything would confess actually found nothing
might like thing call soul
think soul autopsy room dissecting table trace
thought gray mass round convolution shaped like brain man would like without body
could live
naturally could capture entire colony transplant
someone know undertake problem determining actual central intelligence giant termite really
know danger shrewd vast intelligence ability bide time adjust change external
cannot even guess look like ever conquered chapter first invasion tell nothing like trying said adam fry bluntly
nothing complished without primary effort

abaris grotesque feature stood abruptly seemed almost fair allie lane father mixture color glowed green red hue
great eye bored mine deeply felt sudden panic seize
ignorant man earth seen power jupiter greatest powerful planet universe abaris word booming spoken reached mind
thought strange grotesque being could converse language mental process
yes admitted reluctantly
seen

throat rattled mirthfully
stared awed
hoh hoh hoooah mind throbbed force booming mental laugh
lowly worm shot tube pointing straight minded could destroy entire world one little globule radium mean asked sudden desire learn could concerning strang er aweinsipiring power
abaris said evenly sar casm jupiter far superior worm comparison
people still clinging tail jupiter already mastered mathematics
dur ing year followed developed present state jupiter mastered many science one brings world
radium
mastered radium form therefore master universe life well said didnt destroy earth powerful
get earth planet jupiter man earth said amused though enjoying mental conversation immense taking great pride vast knowledge people take life without cause even though life reptile kill friend
queried earnestly
held two white people friend unhurt physically mental belongs jupiter
intention doubtful leaped beside eloli feeble mind refers allie lane
killed instantly felt unable think anything ment stared fascinated feature confronted

sentinel surface informed coming long reached
intention harming unless entered crater thats hung skeleton scare away inquired
think grinning skull would make run skeleton anything earth tends frighten away living abaris declared non chalantly
even dog run bone kind step higher intellectually dog youre bragging cuss arent abaris shot back contempt sarcasm
youve misinformed status human race world
could think better way frighten man jupiter many way frighten man like call

hard believe
living thing exist long enough
dont sound possible thats one failing men earth abaris said evenly
think every thing come within scope derstanding impossible
jupiter long ago achieved immortality
abaris second command great jupiter explain lowly creature vastly important fact interplanetary travel could tell might inform fellow earth actually performed
wise ill call liar said false show bravado
far harm come abaris informed sand suffered permanent physical injury
could afford hold chin meet equal term grotesque frogman jupiter
anyhow unreal mechanical freak
well tell truth world never learn secret jovian man earth abaris thought vibration seemed say
might say day scientist may evolve medium interplanetary travel jupiter intend shorten period time eventually try visit
welcome youre giving lot credit saying due abaris remarked grin
glad come around
make feel better know little intelligent crawling worm suddenly chamber brightened brilliance powerful ray
small sphere spin ning rapidly glowing luminously shot restless fro far end chamber
sound made instinctively turne several second
eye returned abaris two human companion gone
vanished apparently thin air short second eye wan dered around brilliantly lighted chamber

sphere continued back forth move ment dashed quickly sand side
close range discovered body tinged luminous glow seen lining body abaris allie lane father
sand seemed stunned
breathing lung functioned laboriously
sand cried shaking shoulder

whether camphor would serve place powerful spirit ammonia know imagine joy lid sud denly fluttered lip parted
camphor fume actually brought faint powerful ray abaris deadly weapon thrown

chapter sand recovers resently sand stood erect
look around several second evi dently get bearing
watched nervously
abaris meant said mentally sand belonged jupiter knew looked sand eye
like fath omless abyss eye glowed like sulphurous fire
pupil grown seemed disappear rim entirely
seemed trance held allie lane father eye staring straight ahead without apparently comprehensive power
held brace strange hypnotism probably forced allie father slightest bid ding froglike creature sand truly longed jupiter
resigned whatever fate might store could hope cooperation sand
spoke merely stared blankly although certain understood word
lip moved answer word formed throat
seemed stricken dumb
suddenly began attempt converse strange mental telepathy jovians try might ceived response
doomed man unless abaris would restore normal self
shook arm
think said pointing opening abaris come chamber doubtless vanished better find allie lane father hope get alive
know shes alive dont sand appeared made attempt speak heard ally name mentioned merely stared dumbly
rate believed understood said
nudged trembled touch
get allie father without critter knowing whispered ear might able point way
get ill strike toward stovepipe well send telegram los angeles asking help
afraid well need couple bombing plane san pedro get mess grabbed arm hustled toward circular shaft leading chamber
came readily enough loosened pressure arm stood stock still
seemed power whatever leg moved hustled along
per hap grip strange influence held would soon vanish thought
present remained embrace physically mentally
entered open shaft leading chamber highpitched musical note became audible
wondered movement sound mysterious warning
continued luminous tunnel glittered posit priceless gem musical note rose higher higher seemed tax sense hearing uttermost
questioningly turned sand
one trembling hand chafing temple thumb forefinger
sound gradually became wail ilke metallic scream heard entering cave led chamber
suddenly became aware sand broken influence held
frenzied scream leaped aside away
gazed wonder man crouched like beast bay
expected momentarily spring throat
finally recognized became controlled assured jovians sight
first question allie lane
really seen wanted know suffering brain fever
really alive beautiful ever
assured
lord gasped shuddering
noise would drive man insane yes whispered softly ought thank bringing sens believ shrill sound actually responsible recovery
mean asked blankly
dont know big chief freak bounced jumping onto platform dont remember anything seen dreamed ive seen allie lane alive said dis consolately
well explained high chief call name abaris didnt like idea getting familiar allie knocked cold
thought killed might wanted
thought goner he got hell nerve exploded face twitching terrible rage glow green made almost grotesque abaris
ive loved allie lane life ive found nothing death stop havent found yet sand reminded radium pool softly
shes somewhere tunnel
think ought get soon
devil going leave
abarisll probably take allie think get away quick inquired
dont know yet said
well soon find perhaps several hundred foot picked way hugging gemstudded wall along tunnel though allie lane entered chamber
overhead small ball light flitted occasionally illuminating entire passageway
encountered several smaller passageway branching main shaft continued along wider thoroughfare
become jovians
wondered slowly edged way along wall
thing seemed mark existence great underground maze tunnel cavern deep death valley persistent highpitched musical note smashed eardrum unending viciousness
underground search tresently footstep led circular chamber somewhat larger one abaris come
great room illuminated darting light posed unit rapidly revolving machinery emanated highpitched musical note
motioned sand halt studied appa ratus

one tube ran cylinder central manifold tached larger tube fairly sputtered glow force similar powerful great vacuum tube
audible even noise created rapid whirl peculiar machine came steady rhythmic throb centrifugal pump
throb sound heard stood first time rim looking crater containing radium pool
light floated spinning machinery
made little bright spot luminous green formed drafty atmosphere like lantern ing swung rapidly murky fog
turned sand standing behind staring shoulder intently watching motion machinery darting light
beginning believe abaris whis pered ear
devil actually drain ing world unknown radium deposit

perhaps thought figure worthwhile believing would eventually lose net work underground vista tunnel chamber die result
grim outlook best one thing assur ance abaris jovians intention harming seriously
hand neither would way aid
certain
eventually became somewhat accustomed inky blackness tunnel able make form
staring straight ahead discovered accepted small circular hole came faint luminosity
made rapidly could although extremely cautious fearful lest step one bottomless abyss felt existed underground world
edged way along tunnel per hap quarter mile eventually came circular light seen
surprised found science wonder story trance exit another chamber
proached carefully knowing might lie ahead
intention exposing ire abaris could help

chapter vii escape
tto cry softly hard believe robert know wouldnt lie seem impossible

let look please dear allie walked faltering step huge mirror hanging wall stared hand wandering softly feature
sand walked side peered dium reflector
reflection witnessed caused leap aside
first time saw face since radioactive quality radium restored youth

breathing hard excitement twinkle joy anticipation formed crow foot science wonder story side eye
seemed suddenly joy ous man forgetful sinister danger hovered
would happen wondered abaris suddenly came upon secret love tryst sand sweetheart
would fly sudden rage destroy terrible invisible weapon shot green pencil thin ray killed instantly
sat silently sand thought love happiness thought danger death
presently heard sound like scraping foot
sand shrank close tunnel wall semidarkness
fear fled however allie came chamber followed father
lane appeared close range man forty
hair black eye gray penetrating
carriage man prime life full power vigor eye flashed searched ally room nervously
sand got foot walked slowly lighted chamber
lane stopped abruptly surveyed incredulous stare
suddenly stepped swiftly sand side hand met firmly
given hope ever seeing bob said clear voice tingled citement
indeed pleasure
sure allie glad thanks lane sand returned
long time ive struggled hard meet ing
youve faired well condition allie weve got get away frog faced freak
tell know way well start like bob lane said admiringly
always want first get started
let sit talk
terribly afraid well find hard get however ive gone lot sand whispered
little wouldnt amount much maybe bob lane interjected frown
one time know
much like get back home friend cant see definite way escape
ill cooperate fullest ally sake three walked softly ally silken couch sat allie close sand arm waist
heard faint sound issuing tunnel led lane chamber
held breath fear
abaris jovians coming upon scene
blood pound listened hand cupped behind ear magnify sound
sound came breathed easier
turned three ally room
lane speaking voice muffled tone reached
allie explained came
bob saying wont count
strange people claim planet jupiter came solely purpose obtaining great supply radium
seems exhausted supply planet
delicate instrument abaris say scientist discovered earth contained great deposit metal
henceforth set get life planet depends upon existence
abaris fails mean perhaps entire population jupiter wiped unless heavenly body found contain deposit devil ever get sand asked interestedly
lane story coming bob lane continued softly
sound quite impossible fact abaris henchman left jupiter great spherical machine similar sphere probably saw way
sphere capable interstellar travel propelled radium process known mechanic ready minute return jupi ter greater stock metal
long time pumping radium earth sending jupiter small sphere controlled guided unknown source power
abaris say deposit exhausted cylinder pump bringing last drop radium existing earth abaris expects halt pump soon enter interplanetary sphere departure jupiter
said accompany planet unable escape allie resigned self whatever fate store
must admit abaris good would certainly like get back people hold animosity except course appearance rest kind horrifying
become adapted environment yet must naturally rebel spirited away glorious world perhaps regarded jupiter much manner looked upon strange animal
sometime suspected abaris grotesque way exceptionally fond allie
wanted nothing
every wish granted consent appear ing multitude unless submit placed strange power
word forced undergo hypnotism reason able learn
see stood platform throne chamber
allie told one exit underground world guarded constantly either jovians grotesque deathdealing mechanical guard shape cactus tree arm like octopus
chanical jovians seem power radium pool creature lacking mental faculty
unless controlled living hand helpless
jovians really genius form
seen series sphere throne room large hall center
large sphere jupiter miniature orbit
small sphere moon good abaris explained
able watch progress radium sphere shoot way toward jupiter
large sphere show passage plainly
explanation jovian object scientific genius getting goal
let consider possibility escape
plan may able use listened intently plan possible action lane outlined sand
ally father plained certain time guard avenue escape would changed mechanical jovians tentaclelike arm controlled remote central would put place
lane explained previous located source control mechanical men therefore perhaps position disconnect controlling system suspend activity
sounded like excellent plan thought would possible steal near central control apparatus tempt disconnect
surely jovians must maintain constant guard delicate important apparatus
hand may feel need view fact allie lane father long accepted harmless
rate sand approved plan decided attempt escape would made time lane give low whistle would meet ally chamber providing course way clear
lane forefinger drew invisible outline show ing tunnel
sand watched closely absorbed information
meanwhile shot rapid glance around cham ber entirety part guard
several time heart jumped heard sound softly broke stillness cavern sound failed bring expected gro tesque jovians
sand standing center room allie lane arm
kissed endear ingly
ally father paced floor nervously
sud denly lane stopped pacing faced daughter lover
opened lip say something thought better turned half away
swung around presently though decided question confronting spoke softly
allie word nervous tense reached
love
bob dont dear well life father answered
sand turned look lane puzzled
suppose lane returned marry bob
would good thing face whatever confronts would marry father allie said half whisper barely caught
forget dear minister back kansa city father smiled
ive waited long time allie sand put holding ally shoulder looking eye lovingly
marry robert said eye shining happy tear
father perform ceremony caught
ccvascinated watched procedure followed forgetting duty guard whose hand must rest life happy three
eye attention allie whis pered failed notice abaris sud denly come entrance chamber standing silently regarding trio
lane saying pronounce man wife beheld abaris towering form stood menacingly inside room

shrank back darkness tunnel fearful lest discovered
hiding place however could see entire cham ber
though struck terrific force sand lane spun around faced abaris
allie emitted fearful little cry shrank back wall
abaris tube pointed menacingly knew speaking peculiar mental telepathy
word flew able catch learned could receive wave vibration unless tube pointing directly
suddenly heard sand word angrily informed abaris allie become wife man business chamber
feature twitched growing anger spoke hand clenched
frogface heard shout ive search allie lane forty year
found become wife anyone else take away alive eloli bride jupiter man earth caught thunderous vibration abaris tube waved spasmodically direc tions
thought powerful carried crouched
allie lane wife cried sand hotly
die go planet crazy freak yes abaris lane put weakly shaking one palsied
allie man wife
science wonder story cannot take away
law humanity
abaris froglike beak opened closed resounding snap
expected momentar ily bring play terrible invisible ray death
skinny tubelike leg held bar relshaped body admirably thought watched hiding place
seemed like stilt unjointed except hip around draped narrow breech cloth goldedged purple
body glistened oilily around bald misshapen head rested thin metal band glowing luminously green
antenna tube waved angrily
eloli go abaris jupiter abaris thundered vibration reaching sharply
shuddered force powerful thought wave
jupiter specimen many planetarial being
scientist would like study specimen aborigine planet
therefore three accompany jupiter
eloli come bride jove would die abaris lane parried dejectedly
earth could adapt self environment seem understand man earth abaris vibration said jupiter accomplished immortality
death jupiter
come voluntarily shall forced resort method lay hidden terror watched sand face
anger feature twisted fury
could help attempt attack huge jovian commander stood fore
could gladly would gone chamber
suddenly heard dismal hooting behind abaris gradually grew nearer
watched opening tunnel behind pecting momentarily see follower enter room
two abreast came body shining freshly applied oil loin covered shimmering breechcloth
unlike abaris wore band around huge head
like soldier line broke center abaris huge body stood like pivot singlefiled around wall circular cham ber
shot quick glance sand
stood bellig erently watching
allie crept arm buried head bosom
lane stared floor downcast utterly jected
first beheld lane pressed flashing eye strong power ful body figured upon cooperation dire moment
perhaps thought realized unlike sand utter futility objecting demand jovians
sand different mettle
slowly moved allie behind faced abaris
jovians lined around cham ber wall stood apparently attention
made move interfere
abaris ordered remain inactive relying upon power combat force three human submission
frogface sand shouted insultingly abaris
call dog well settle right
afraid crazy light even rather die submit abaris throat cackled peculiar laugh
owlish eye stared unblinking lid
sand approached sinister steadiness crouched ready spring bulllike throat giant
stared fearfully
end thought abaris tilted huge head look upon insignificant antagonist
glanced around chamber froggish jov ians
continued stand silently atten tion
chapter viii

sand grunted strained hard hold abaris flexible arm prevent bringing play terrible weapon seemed concealed suckerlike tip end
seemed like conflict two great force man beast terrible battle premacy like good evil angel demon
radium pool thrilled great heroism sand heart swelled pride loyal friendship
slowly edged way toward chamber keeping well wall closer view struggle
uneven seemed sand thought better two phys ically
could hope win unequal combat unarmed terrible green death ray abaris
white man plane tarial beast
greater contrast could imag ined
muscle sand neck bulged labored hold tough flexible arm abaris
jovians skinny leg unjointed stiltlike kicked spasmodically poor protection sand powerful limb
better point vantage watched struggle
two would win terrible battle physical force
suddenly abaris gave great heave cast sand clear barrellike body
sand held bull dog tenacity onto writhing arm jovian leader struggling vainly pre vent abaris aiming pencilthin emerald ray destruction
abaris shot terrible ray jovian near vanished entirely puff acrid smoke
ray struck one huge chair crumbled
combat felt would like wrestling match due fact seemed impossible abaris rise stilt like leg
much favor sand

studied abaris bestial feature see accepting terrific throttling receiv ing
owlish orb gleamed flaming red stared bestially sand set feature terrible power burning man brain
cast quick glance allie
recovering faint father side
behind fluttering lid allie looked struggling figure thrashing chamber floor

slowly slowly dominating power abaris overcame struggling physical force sand
gradually eased terrible grip jovians writhing arm steadily abaris bringing suckerlike tip toward antag onist
realizing waning strength sand made desperate effort tear eye blaz ing relentless orb abaris turning head side
struggle would physical strength command could check gradual domination brainpower slowly surely smothering submission
presently sand muscle relaxed finally terrific power abaris dominating swept core brain overpowering
cursed softly hid face hand second
sand head dropped one side powerful arm hung limply
blood streamed no trils caused tremendous physical effort
caught glimpse eye head fell
stark unseeing eye
body shuddered convulsively slipped inertly chamber floor
abaris hoisted erect two jovians tube waving victoriously cackling laugh throat
allie lane screamed father stroked shaking head gently abaris strode wobbling like duck toward

abaris thought killed outright brought play terrible ray
great mental power alone completely subdued
slowly hand stole butt gun

thought maddened brain suddenly dashed tunnel gun hand blocked abatis passage toward allie father
felt terrible urge kill spill blood whatever coursed vein frogfaced beast
stop abaris shouted hysterically
stop

emerald green liquid poured hole ran owlish eye
rapidly slug hurled gun jovians instantly grasp sig nificance
abruptly entire chamber seemed alive thin green ray played deadly precision around
abaris suddenly ill effect six slug passing head made weak attempt lift tentaclelike arm
effort brought
made leap late

chamber floor seemed rush fell heavily
several second lay full command faculty unable move muscle
head swam feeling hurled space terrific speed

great hissing sound reached ear heard loud earsplitting shriek
looked overhead fissure earth filtered soul gladdening sun light

chapter distant heavenly body previous consideration dealt travel beyond realm attrac tion earth paramount
mat ters regard real purpose journey space complete separation earth reaching distant heavenly body
first let briefly view stellar universe viewed standpoint spatial navigation future realm travel
must therefore change enlarge mental look
wish regard entire cosmos world hitherto seemed world earth home narrowest sense
earth alone
else bound gravity future station space even moon must also reckoned part narrow home uni verse belonging realm earth
small distance earth moon kilometer compared distance space
hundredth distance nearest planet venus mar
sphere would made moon orbit around earth could easily find room inside sun
first unit space consider beyond earth solar system various planet belonging
eight principal planet earth one together numerous heavenly body

planet mercury nearest sun follow venus earth

accord ingly venus mar along moon direct neighbor earth
heavenly body permanently bound sun power mass attraction compelled constantly revolve cen tre elliptical path

greater home universe solar system
realm indeed tremendous size even light though hurry space speed kilo meter second take eight hour cross directly
yet tiny world compared incomprehensible extent universe many heavenly body fixed star heated even gaseous state send greeting shining ray
even nearest alpha cen tauri lightyears away time far diameter whole solar system
others however much farther hundred thousand light year
already extinguished fixed star nearer eternal darkness empty space could never see
already apparent trav elling distant heavenly body take account belonging solar sys tem
technique travelling manner distant travel space would take place would gen eral free orbit heavenly body whose paramount field attraction trip take place
within realm sun mar fig showing sun orbit four minor planeft
mercury venus earth mar
indicates also relative dis tances orbit fore must move around latter always sort free orbit become subject gravity plunge sea fire
certainly need pay special heed point long remain narrower realm earth world solar sys tem
thdse revolves sun free orbit speak time body belong ing
earth whose speed science wonder story meter second also revolves moon present would revolve future station space moon station satel lites earth
body going around sun attraction thereby loses direct effect iveness
called stable condi tion floating regard sun
space ship pass nar rower region attraction one heavenly body revolving around sun would travel around sun free orbit
example question trip earth distant planet basis said course indepen dent path also time departure earth must chosen space ship arrives point orbit planet visited approxinuitely time point passed planet
hfc
showing effect body rotating aun change velocity
speed body earth accelerated withdraw sun new orbit
speed retarded approach form new orbit
ship thus brought region traction planet visited possi bility open either circling free orbit satellite often desired descending
case planet blanket air like earth landing method already con sidered landing earth hohmanns land ing manoeuver use decreasing ellipsis
blanket air earth posse miss ing landing effected recoil braking making force operates ship work opposite direction direction fall descent
order journey within solar system another heavenly body successfully getting free one would necessary change orbital motion would previously acquired around sun along original planet assistance propelling force
thereby would enter independent orbit sun serving intermediary orbit join orbit planet
according law celestial mechanic purpose original orbital motion must altered according location goal must accelerated ship away sun retarded approach sun
finally soon desired heavenly body reached independent motion con necting orbital path must changed ship must take relation new planet order carry manoeuver cir cling landing
return trip would take place way
accordingly clear course distant trip planetary space repeated change condition motion necessary
must time effected propulsion artificial power therefore require penditure fuel
expenditure according hohmanns calculation least orbit original planet visited cut connecting orbital path ship merely touched
event nec essary amount fuel considerable
still greater amount must added planet visited circled actually landed upon directly
amount fuel needed fact increase mass planet accordingly power attraction
understood considered ascending starting return trip requires considerable expenditure energy ready known ascent earth
furthermore braking landing must done mean propulsion recoil braking absence suitable atmosphere result tremendous increase neces sary fuel
moreover fuel must taken along trip earth least first visit remote planet could count beforehand able secure fuel needed return trip
chapter start surface earth commence trip directly surface earth overcome gravity would necessary also lift whole supply fuel
according previous mark demand extraordinary expenditure work
case hand least efficiency fuel available amount necessary taken along would accordingly make great part total weight ship con struction would hardly possible
visit heavenly body could undertaken directly earth surface mean fuel known would circum navigation moon purpose closer observation nature surface especially side always turned away earth
course could imprisoned moon circle often desired word ship move tangentially orbit planet leaf take path brings tangent orbit new planet energy required would minimum
editor problem space flying free orbit like satellite moon
amount fuel needed undertaking would much greater normal ascent earth practical limit gravity
spatial station basis spatial travel condition would considerably vorable however oberth proposes fuel depot constructed floating proper height earth constantly circling free orbit serve starting point trip instead earth
case slight expenditure work would needed entirely free earth ship would cordingly need loaded fuel nec cessary ascent earth
little would need taken along would required distant trip
since depot result free orbital tion would weightless fuel could simply placed amount freely floating point space
protected ray sun even oxygen hydrogen could kept definitely solid state
supplying would managed constant travelling space ship back forth
might earth moon
former case fuel least far consists liquefied oxygen hydrogen could produced great power plant operated heat tropical ocean
moon would especially advantageous base max valier suggests
mass accordingly force attraction much smaller earth would greatly lessen expenditure work needed cent therefore carrying fuel
certainly presupposes necessary raw material actually present moon least water even form ice
latter would electrolytically decomposed oxygen hydrogen required energy ing provided solar power plant
unfortunately probability great
case however could use moon also hohmann suggests start ing point spatial travel accordingly make fuel depot
spite many advantage plan oberths proposal freely floating depot seems favorable complete lease field attraction terrestrial region including moon would demand con siderably smaller expenditure energy
indeed standpoint economy energy would doubtless advantageous establish depot one several million kilometer earth especially fuel transported earth
shall nevertheless transfer station space making latter thereby base travelling already supplied equipment necessary
especially important part equipment would giant telescope
thanks unlimited efficiency would make po sible first examine minutely distance region travelled stellar world
furthermore space ship could kept constant observation large part trip frequently whole
mean light signal shown ship pointed time could communication least one side
thus spatial station aside many duty already mentioned would able initiate real travel universe also serve operating base spatial journey
accessibility neighboring planet ohmann thoroughly investigated problem visiting heavenly body
cording result expressed terrestrial chro nology trip earth venus would last day mar
round trip includ ing circumnavigation venus mar relatively slight distance eight million kilometer could performed year half
visiting venus landing upon cluding stay month together trip back quite year would required
let assume journey commence according previous observation spatial station final release field gravity earth would require little energy
return take place directly sur face earth energy need used
one descend merely brak ing air resistance
let weight trans ported two person together provision needed entire trip apparatus quired observation purpose
hohmann calculates space exploring ship ready start provided fuel necessary trip way must weigh approximately follows previously mentioned round trip including circumnavigation landing venus mar ton per cent fuel first landing moon ton venus ton mar ton
first three case per cent two percent entire weight ship would fuel
expulsion speed meter second earth assumed
clear construction ship carry rocket propulsion fuel making per cent entire weight would present considerable tech nical difficulty manufacture could hardly succeed present
accordingly moon larger heavenly body next could present question visit including science wonder story landing
however could best approach near planet circumnavigate without however landing
still hope course time aid principle sectional construction may finally succeed even technical mean known today construct ing space rocket even execute landing neighboring planet
fig showing two way body travel one planet another
first way shown left easier body leaf planet tangent orbital path travel sqi approach orbit next planet tangent path
smallest amount power required
second method shown right body forced cross orbit one planet get
would necessary calculation path take space badly done
method take greater amount power first body forced travel away sun therefore overcome greater distance sun gravitational pull
doubtless exhaust possibility seem offered spatial navigation pres ent state science
difficulty would far greater confront visit distant planet solar system
merely route travelled far longer hitherto considered
since planet greatly different distance sun earth reaching field gravity sun play considerable part
attraction would overcome energy
ample travel away sun ascend must overcome pull exactly manner travel away earth
shown previously mentioned change orbital speed sun necessary distant travel planetary space
wished descend one planet tremendous amount fuel would prove necessary especially case jupiter saturn
consequence enormous mass posse powerful field gravity
reaching fixed star extreme moteness alone make impossible consider ation
distant world affirm must time remain confined region earth neighboring planet
succeed creasing repulsion speed recoil action beyond amount perhaps meter second thus far reckoned highest practically tainable find possibility storing great amount energy small space situation would entirely different
chemist future develop propelling material far surpassing fect already known
even conceivable time shall succeed making technically serviceable using propel space ship tremendous amount energy confined matter energy whose existence already know
perhaps shall also find method using purpose electrical phenomenon cathode radiation way attain tremen dous increase repulsion speed electrical influence
might lastly come question suitable use sun radiation radium decomposition etc
certainly natural possibility future investi gator inventor still plentifully available respect
success result could visit actually set foot many faroff world yet view measurable distance starry heaven
ancient dream mankind
would ful fillment use
certainly science would make extraordinary gain
certain judg ment possible today regarding practical value
little know even nearest neighbor among heavenly body
moon still part region earth narrower home universe distant heavenly body one best known
cold covering air without higher form life
gigantic mass rock floating space fissured inhospitable rigid death world past
considerably le knowledge regard ing body next best known moon neighboring planet mar
comparison knowledge planet knowledge mar considerable
mar aged world though nearly old moon
mass therefore force attraction much le earth
indeed covering air yet far le density earth
surface air pressure certainly considerably lower even highest mountain top
apparently posse water
fairly large part may frozen mean temperature seems much earth even place martian equatorial belt comparatively high tem peratures determined
thinness atmosphere difference tem perature day night great
strangest discussed martian observation phenomenon socalled martian canal even though recently often regarded merely optical illusion really know nothing
problem space flying rate already know mar offer enough clue able form final judgment whether planet inhab ited intelligent creature creature
would hardly habitable person earth chiefly rarity mosphere
therefore would offer spatial navi gation extremely interesting object investiga tion scientific standpoint
whether landing would practical value well cannot recognized today certainty
hardly appears likely however
another matter second neighboring planet venus splendid shining heavenly body known morning star evening star size mass therefore force gravity prevailing surface slightly le earth
also covering air doubtless similar though somewhat deeper denser
unfortunately venus hard observe earth always appears near sun therefore visible twi light
accordingly still entirely uncertain rotation axis
period proximately earth twentyfour hour widely assumed venus earth would marked resemblance
therefore planet may mot reasonably count finding condition life similar earth even suspicion always covered cloud prove cor rect
even earth highly veloped life plant animal time part water filling ocean still form vapor
certainly heavenly body known venus offer greatest like lihood suited occupation thereby coming question future goal travel
since also nearest planet might well enticing object spatial navigation
mercury still nearer sun offer even le favorable condition observation venus
smallest planet cover ing air probably extremely thin surface apparently similar moon
reason especially closeness sun solar radiation nine time strong earth extremely unfa vorable temperature condition must prevail
mercury would accordingly hardly invit ing place visit
although considering previously men tioned planet possible arrive fairly probable result far know insufficient purpose case distant jupiter saturn uranus neptune
indeed able determine dense covering air
question nature surface planet however still entirely uncertain
jupiter saturn densely enveloped condensa tion product cloud sort apparently see real surface
case uranus neptune extreme remoteness prevents exact servation
concerning value goal space travel difficult say anything
yet merely cir cumstance determined case planet relatively low average density earth lead con clusion different physical condition must exist earth
alone must greatly lessen expectation visit
still would perhaps possible satellite planet especially jupiter would offer comparatively favor able prospect
one thing absolutely certain mass consequent force field gravity planet tremendously greater earth would make visiting acceleraton middle deceleration
total distance covered direction demotion fig
speed curve showing method acceleration decel eration going point
body uniformly accelerated rest reach maximum speed halfway uniformly decelerated come rest traordinarily difficult especially case jupiter saturn
regarding finally various body longing solar system reasonably certain today could hardly derive special prac tical benefit visit
see therefore may timistic advantage expected member solar system
thus far certainly know far little let thought free rein respect
might well world prove entirely worthless
hand perhaps would find many fertile soil plant animal possibly sort entirely odd strange
might even gigantic size like existing earth
indeed incredible might find even human being similar creature maybe even po sessing civilization different even older ative planet
even highly probable life distant planet case exists another level earth

keep swallowing
air drum becomes dense outside pressure membrane rather pressure perfect equilib rium presto abracadabra pain gone

phos phorus lamp would furnish light six month
simply wonderful one serious drawback light emitted feeble one
manufacture lamp one time used believe paris probably elsewhere maga zines containing explosive sim plicity
glass phial put small piece phosphorus

bridge
earth would build bridge across frightful chasm

go clear aeross yes said stopping gazing strange dim mass go clear across
thats place side thats waiting chapter angel demon shouldnt bit surprized said milton
aid strange bridge truly
look like ruin ruin fallen drome ruin indeed
ruinous wondered mass could possibly remain intact
short advance however mystery solved

angel indeed well chosen moment
hideous ape bat straining leash loosed position despite revolver would truly hor rible one
scarce twentyfive foot lay monster self
case attack would drop monster spring lucky shot could result would disastrous one

next instant gave cry
demon made sudden strain forward

move forward back weird tale thought utterly quixotic course didnt want back couldnt make
wouldnt step back neither would
