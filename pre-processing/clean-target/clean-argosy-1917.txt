who going marry mercedes girtons voice dropped something like awe
mercedes tesoro

carmen tickled death
said something mercedes paid little attention well thunder guanamans good earnest arent rest life guess muttered girton strange solemnity come upon
silence followed little heavy comfortable silence two men understand perfectly
hemmett thinking pleasantly luck come old friend girton thrice started humming little native lovesong thrice caught self stopped

went perfectly solid altara stared gentle astonishment girton smiled suppose there connection two thing
rious new big employer labor influencing employee vote ferrata doubt hemmett said slowly
although whole industrial boom rather queer mind
almost thing queer likely come
see happening minute steve
guanamas new factory furnishing million dollar worth supply every month european army thatjuld made cheaply bought cheaply united state carried europe cheaply theyre made say
thats fact isnt cried girton
well although never given much serious thought last week unquestionably fact
ive infernally busy tobacco business ive never considered matter recently fact certain european nation paying need stuff made
well matter money flow fac tory start time

began time canita argosy
confounded pacifist went air decided harbor needed fort big enough defend two panama canal jammed sen ate
fact whole business think seemed begin
long halfminute gazed gloom
stephen said hemmett suffering native tendency hookworm late year
body putting something got altogether ive wondering without mentioning ever since realized altara elected without reason world electing steve particu larly since infernal radical party got majority senate well president
whats bosh
there nothing suppose girton laughed shortly
queer per sisted
factory crop ping suddenly
national engine work must seventy eighty million dollar worth capital least
concern anyway ostensibly mighty corporation partly native organized purpose turning perfect form turbine engine
must mean busi ness steve
theyve bought hundred acre point opposite fort paid tremendous price land
theyre employing thousand men yes walled
fifteenfoot fence whole place guard every gate
every man shop sworn secrecy hemmett said mildly theyre manufacturing engine device still dead secret patent yet issued several country
isnt necessarily criminal even bit odd

wish see senor girton send gentleman said briefly
man departed return another native guanama thirty second later
visitor stranger small slim immaculate linen proceeded straight girton smiling bowing extended envelope
senor altara president senor purred
answer convey backed away girton whis tling softly switched one electric light set little tropical fern jar elbow
whistling still ripped envelope drew official sheet said even continued whistle read stopped whistling

stephen girton looked
back tell ive resigned said bitterly
want door instead kicked edge terrace quick
dont like face mad little whiteclad man vanished
hemmett laughed annoyedly
childish steve maybe snorted exsecretary
wasnt job
plenty money know
idea thing way infernal thanklessness whole proposition queemess hemmett nodded
thats impressed first said
yesterday novedades editorial possibility new cabinet mentioned impos sibility getting secretary war guanama could even continue work stopped little butler approaching
senor enrico ricoro nounced
see senor together girton hemmett gazed butler
rich ricoro latter asked
tobacco ricoro senor send hemmett directed alone directed puzzled little smile old friend
thats queer est thing day isnt call
supposed ricoro deadly enemy class ever since mess tried merge tobacco interest girton muttered
cant two week ago gave interview effect ricoro combine would never touch psst ricoro ugly grunting little guanaman millionaire past every penny wealth tied tobaccoleaves ego swollen several time normal size oily bowing person beamed pleasure unutterable
held hand girton hemmett shook wonderingly
drew another wicker chair proffered case really remarkable cigar
rubbed hand happily lunged business moment unusual performance guana man commercial circle savor orient thing
astonish come chuckled
pero one make mistake yes
thing fool ish
forgive consider forgiven ricoro hemmett said curiously
pardon argosy
social call business visit permit since come home senor ricoro said engaging smile growing even broader
sit terrace survey city wonderful
speak time pleasant little business matter better yet
say might depend business matter certainty chuckled amia ble gentleman
senor think find pleasant
come permission buy extensive tobacco interest ably con ducted buy cash senor ricoro went smoothly
fence senor
know know plantation cost perhaps one million half dollar united state theyve paying dandy terest two million said girton
reason senor come pay cold cash say two million quarter said surprising ricoro
shall paper drawn evening conclude deal may call morning explosion dynamite center terrace might startled little little
ricoro absolutely tobaccopoor garded ready cash ricoro scorned splendid holding two year ago
steve girton kicked hemmetts foot darkness
hemmett said simply nix comprehend senor ricoro inquired
nice offer dont think well accept
one thing talking actual spotcash senor cried ricoro
ten morning national bank guanama money shall handed gold wish aha
another thing dont care sell
tobaccoland valuable ever tariff united state change going val uable still offer enough nearly two million onehalf said ricoro
yes whats idea girton rasped
somebody found gold plantation tobacco going join highcostofliving performer way dont sus pect
simply prospered wish increase holding senor ricoro waited silently giving vague impression feeling wounded hemmett girton conversed wordless telepathic fashion come men known understood many long trying year
ricoro seeking course give affair aspect ordinary big business proposition
yet intelligent tenyearold boy conversant gua naman affair must known well something else
clairvoyant might able delve ricoros brain find answer certainty mained holding worth two onehalf million ricoro held value hemmett girton
youve sprung suddenly first glance look good ricoro said hemmett
trust mag nates used slinging million around like cigar
frank say offered three million accept evening
weve week think week senor well
native drew deep disappointed breath
american
excellent senor say echoed
still hoped close evening
handsome offer senor darned handsome make one suspicious girton smiled utter candor
there something ductively lovely wouldnt close truck gold street
thats weve lived year guanama final senor evening rate evening slipped remarkable millionaire bounced foot shrugged shoulder disgustedly quickly smiled
evening hemmett asked sharply
evening particular one
pay crazy price bacco ricoro spreading palm deprecat ingly retreated behind bland smile
trick peculiarly guanaman bafflingly chinese
mean anything world nothing
case seemed indicate unduly suspicious inoffensive millionaire whose sole desire make richer smile persisted long enough convince ricoro done talking business made perfunc tory remark nothing particular took leave
street heard hum departing motor
hemmetts grin quizzical asked blaze make steve nothing unless whelming trust coming buy tobacco country ricoro heard borrowed enough corner supply get couldnt borrow two half million one lump know mused girton token know country well doubt there one man beside esteemed fatherjjnlaw able hand sum cash perhaps two minute smoked pondered
there something behind offer hemmett announced
something immediate connection tobacco business sound silly isnt steve
result living long guanama suppose thought queer election queer thing evening
there reason every thing happens little old world boy there visible reason anybody wanting take tobaccoland fifty sixty per cent actually worth
hence reason invisible moment steve girton late secretary war leaned back chair chuckled little
hemmett might bristling sus picion affair could quite understand girton bristle
one hour back stephen become engaged adorable girl entire universe one state rather hard bristle intangible thing
think youre ned said quietly enough
think ricoro brainstorm kind belief guanama monopolize earth tobacco market
actually dqife form little group wealthy men make pool two million half voice trailed
third time minute hemmetts little butler
william jones announced time
see senor jones hemmett echoed rather loudly
jones hush girton said quietly
thats argosy
mystery jones ned must name william
thats chap landed last month living whole floor new hotel ever since fellow ride around big white car brought ive heard
earth want find girton laughed
joiiess form appeared lighted doorway moved toward
hemmett switched another light two examined jones shook hand
well dressed conventional feature might anything prosperous small tradesman head corporation
seemed faculty looking like absolutely definite type crowd occurred girton one would passed fifty time without knowing existed
yet queer assured ring voice said gentleman pleasure making acquaintance great
bring news news hemmett said
news indeed smiled jones
leave guanama
chapter iii

one explanation capable holding water
fifteen second back known ridiculously confident fashion ushering guanama done much make
delivered self bowed dropped chair laughed quite happily yes mad fast enough

hemmett jones laughed
leave think steamer sail one morrow please jones girton asked amusedly
