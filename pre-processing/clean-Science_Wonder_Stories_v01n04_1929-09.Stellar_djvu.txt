hidden wonder hugo gernsback greatest source wonder see indeed know hidden going known progress long tortuous road future

nothing added wealth earth last year possible exception falling meteorite
yet humanity time nothing race animal emerging long sojourn savagery
every thing spell civilization today hidden ancestor

day tje take pleasure presenting lieve keller greatest work far
story cause furore endless discussion seems certain
embrace tremend ous subject incidentally enters realm yet little understood even foremost scientist
may sure greatest mystery surround even permeate body solved next hundred year
instance maeterlinck asks book white ant intelli gence governs body
cut finger ignorant person say start healing
process healing mean instant breach made skin innumerable thousand nute white body called corpuscle immediately rush breach start fighting germ enter opening new cell built immediately close breach
neither human intelligence human anything process time within human body
know intelligence evidently directs thing intelli gence one know
whether little understood socalled soul something else owe know
indeed impossible mem bers entire human race must considered simply separate cell great organism
fused homogeneous body nothing intervening air separate
may true could illustrated many way
war instance quite often change entire nation overnight magic also change lifetime habit ideal people almost quickly
religion fanaticism passion similar evidence transmission entire nation nation many instance idea without visible com munication individual
thing may explained purely logical natural reasoning without resorting supernatural indeed author pointed memorable work
certainly work commend earnest tention every thinking questioning person
human termite question scientific world solved men souderman trained laborer world unknown willing sacrifice everything obtain answer one mystery life
something souderman uch worker
price paid great
everything abandoned
lifetime spent attain one little fact
yet men feel attainment one addition store human knowledge sufficient reward sacrifice
suppose one man spent life time cancer cell merely studying actually living
would think nothing else waking hour dream sleep
month month year year would become intimate enemy middleaged
cer cell would become separate race living crea tures parasitic enemy mankind
would learn history folklore tradition
cancer race would slowly reward effort allowing glimpse separate intelli gence comparable human specie
time would pas might old age would come still secret prevention would remain mystery
last resort would deliberately inoculate cer cell make body laboratory could make last final effort gain insight soul individual cell group telligence cancer mass
others would con sider insane recluse introverted study year unfortunate dying disease spent year study
yet even death bed might whisper great truth would make human race free parasite kill one every four reach age forty
surely man would die happy thought contributed one fact would make life race happier
great sacrifice
every generation produce one voluntary victim

naturally made short work first acoustophone fooled
made study cement used building able make fairly good imitation cov ered apparatus
guess thought part colony house least try eat
followed long day study
realized life long enough search especially came interpretation new language enlisted help
poor fellow wonderful linguist hated bug kind made hundred phono graph record let study comfort house cape town
odd
even tell record told new language would like see could isolate obtain meaning
conclusion reached two year tonishing useful reaching final conclusion
working independently able isolate certain sound idea action accompanying sound saw need actually seeing little fellow
made undertake special study physic light ray

could look different part colony house
could see life lived normal condition

soudermans question felt last would able tell whether termite able think
action pointed intellectual pro ce
course fabre think felt observation would made change opinion
course instinct may become complicated possible man intelligence simply composed million complicated automatic instinctive act
learned language termite
least thought
remember said philologist cape town simply knew language know language ant
poor fellow went wild
said believed oldest language world parent tongue human speech
isolated root word estab lished derivation finally wrote glossary com posed five hundred word
wanted
made hundred record promised would finance book ready publish went back work determined learn use new language soon possible
experimented least two year
example took sharp auger bored hole one inch wide wall house acoustophone attached
able look house hear house note reaction opening hole
usual number soldier came formed solid ring around side hole
worker came either dropping globule quid cement small piece sand
within hour opening closed
order given
supreme mentality realize danger close opening giving order
procured ice machine literally froze tried freeze small portion wall
ther mometer wall result
termite simply rushed large mass fermenting mould spot spite effort kept temperature point could live
intelligence instinct
would bore detailed study experiment
last came definite conclusion
termite nervous system
able understand certain sound originate certain sound
sound used way resemble speech least served mean communication
sociability conversation seemed consist mainly order
power issued order million occupant one termitary said yes sir obeyed
faced new problem
whence came order
constituted initiating force

watched result visual apparatus
soldier came guard opening instantly worker came liquid cement
course hole repair resulting confusion
waited day repeated experiment
confusion
third day reaction
attaching acoustophone carefully bored hole colony house
order given gave
new sound introduced
soldier worker obeyed closed hole
novelty
someone learned order duplicated consequently order inside changed worker instructed pay attention old form
went another termitary gave original order
response
gave new order two day obeyed third day provoked reaction
see anything odd
seemed supreme intelligence first termitary communicated news complication supreme intelligence second colony house
went one mile away result hundred mile difference
chapter iii great discovery ttoi worked game chess thing ruled colony house
would live receiver acoustophone ear specially ingenious invention learned talk termitary changed voice exact duplication tone used insect
gradually dawned upon two language used
one issuing order dare say
communication supreme intelli gences various colony house
idea dawned upon went rushing cape town
growing old time spend isolated working
surprise johanson cape town rived conclusion namely two language
stupi fied idea felt almost impossible put word blurted thought tongue loosened lover hour spoke though touched divine fire
talked matter day conclusion
termitary two language
one simple used giving order
vastly complicated imper fectly understood soldier worker apparently used mean communication tween intelligence different colony house
johanson hated insect
naturally could stand thought ant crawling came termite colony give credit staying two week
left
work accomplished dur ing two week placed threshold great discovery
ceased worry lesser language

thus slowly establishing new individual mentality hoped conquer world
amazing conversation remained silent

another idea developed course next year
feel work cut short incomplete without effort made actually find see one thing whatever might call head actual intellectual force behind animal call giant termite
feel something might learned one actually captured
knowledge superior perhaps compromise might reached
first idea good one replied old scientist
work done need repeated
many year life spent endeavor learn peculiar language
one repeated work would simply time wasted
easy matter make phonograph record could also teach

ill cooperate fullest ally sake three walked softly ally silken couch sat allie close sand arm waist
heard faint sound issuing tunnel led lane chamber
held breath fear
abaris jovians coming upon scene
blood pound listened hand cupped behind ear magnify sound
sound came breathed easier
turned three ally room
lane speaking voice muffled tone reached
allie explained came
bob saying wont count
strange people claim planet jupiter came solely purpose obtaining great supply radium
seems exhausted supply planet
delicate instrument abaris say scientist discovered earth contained great deposit metal
henceforth set get life planet depends upon existence
abaris fails mean perhaps entire population jupiter wiped unless heavenly body found contain deposit devil ever get sand asked interestedly
lane story coming bob lane continued softly
sound quite impossible fact abaris henchman left jupiter great spherical machine similar sphere probably saw way
sphere capable interstellar travel propelled radium process known mechanic ready minute return jupi ter greater stock metal
long time pumping radium earth sending jupiter small sphere controlled guided unknown source power
abaris say deposit exhausted cylinder pump bringing last drop radium existing earth abaris expects halt pump soon enter interplanetary sphere departure jupiter
said accompany planet unable escape allie resigned self whatever fate store
must admit abaris good would certainly like get back people hold animosity except course appearance rest kind horrifying
become adapted environment yet must naturally rebel spirited away glorious world perhaps regarded jupiter much manner looked upon strange animal
sometime suspected abaris grotesque way exceptionally fond allie
wanted nothing
every wish granted consent appear ing multitude unless submit placed strange power
word forced undergo hypnotism reason able learn

small sphere moon good abaris explained
able watch progress radium sphere shoot way toward jupiter
large sphere show passage plainly
explanation jovian object scientific genius getting goal
let consider possibility escape
plan may able use listened intently plan possible action lane outlined sand
ally father plained certain time guard avenue escape would changed mechanical jovians tentaclelike arm controlled remote central would put place
lane explained previous located source control mechanical men therefore perhaps position disconnect controlling system suspend activity
sounded like excellent plan thought would possible steal near central control apparatus tempt disconnect
surely jovians must maintain constant guard delicate important apparatus
hand may feel need view fact allie lane father long accepted harmless
rate sand approved plan decided attempt escape would made time lane give low whistle would meet ally chamber providing course way clear
lane forefinger drew invisible outline show ing tunnel
sand watched closely absorbed information
meanwhile shot rapid glance around cham ber entirety part guard
several time heart jumped heard sound softly broke stillness cavern sound failed bring expected gro tesque jovians
sand standing center room allie lane arm
kissed endear ingly
ally father paced floor nervously
sud denly lane stopped pacing faced daughter lover
opened lip say something thought better turned half away
swung around presently though decided question confronting spoke softly
allie word nervous tense reached

abaris froglike beak opened closed resounding snap
expected momentar ily bring play terrible invisible ray death
skinny tubelike leg held bar relshaped body admirably thought watched hiding place

antenna tube waved angrily
eloli go abaris jupiter abaris thundered vibration reaching sharply

therefore three accompany jupiter
eloli come bride jove would die abaris lane parried dejectedly
earth could adapt self environment seem understand man earth abaris vibration said jupiter accomplished immortality
death jupiter
come voluntarily shall forced resort method lay hidden terror watched sand face
anger feature twisted fury

could gladly would gone chamber
suddenly heard dismal hooting behind abaris gradually grew nearer
watched opening tunnel behind pecting momentarily see follower enter room
two abreast came body shining freshly applied oil loin covered shimmering breechcloth
unlike abaris wore band around huge head
like soldier line broke center abaris huge body stood like pivot singlefiled around wall circular cham ber
shot quick glance sand
stood bellig erently watching
allie crept arm buried head bosom
lane stared floor downcast utterly jected

perhaps thought realized unlike sand utter futility objecting demand jovians
sand different mettle
slowly moved allie behind faced abaris
jovians lined around cham ber wall stood apparently attention
made move interfere
abaris ordered remain inactive relying upon power combat force three human submission
frogface sand shouted insultingly abaris
call dog well settle right
afraid crazy light even rather die submit abaris throat cackled peculiar laugh
owlish eye stared unblinking lid
sand approached sinister steadiness crouched ready spring bulllike throat giant
stared fearfully

suddenly abaris gave great heave cast sand clear barrellike body
sand held bull dog tenacity onto writhing arm jovian leader struggling vainly pre vent abaris aiming pencilthin emerald ray destruction
abaris shot terrible ray jovian near vanished entirely puff acrid smoke

owlish orb gleamed flaming red stared bestially sand set feature terrible power burning man brain
cast quick glance allie
recovering faint father side
behind fluttering lid allie looked struggling figure thrashing chamber floor

chapter distant heavenly body previous consideration dealt travel beyond realm attrac tion earth paramount
mat ters regard real purpose journey space complete separation earth reaching distant heavenly body
first let briefly view stellar universe viewed standpoint spatial navigation future realm travel
must therefore change enlarge mental look
wish regard entire cosmos world hitherto seemed world earth home narrowest sense
earth alone
else bound gravity future station space even moon must also reckoned part narrow home uni verse belonging realm earth
small distance earth moon kilometer compared distance space
hundredth distance nearest planet venus mar

others however much farther hundred thousand light year
already extinguished fixed star nearer eternal darkness empty space could never see
already apparent trav elling distant heavenly body take account belonging solar sys tem
technique travelling manner distant travel space would take place would gen eral free orbit heavenly body whose paramount field attraction trip take place

certainly need pay special heed point long remain narrower realm earth world solar sys tem
thdse revolves sun free orbit speak time body belong ing
earth whose speed science wonder story meter second also revolves moon present would revolve future station space moon station satel lites earth
body going around sun attraction thereby loses direct effect iveness
called stable condi tion floating regard sun
space ship pass nar rower region attraction one heavenly body revolving around sun would travel around sun free orbit
example question trip earth distant planet basis said course indepen dent path also time departure earth must chosen space ship arrives point orbit planet visited approxinuitely time point passed planet
hfc
showing effect body rotating aun change velocity
speed body earth accelerated withdraw sun new orbit
speed retarded approach form new orbit
ship thus brought region traction planet visited possi bility open either circling free orbit satellite often desired descending
case planet blanket air like earth landing method already con sidered landing earth hohmanns land ing manoeuver use decreasing ellipsis
blanket air earth posse miss ing landing effected recoil braking making force operates ship work opposite direction direction fall descent
order journey within solar system another heavenly body successfully getting free one would necessary change orbital motion would previously acquired around sun along original planet assistance propelling force
thereby would enter independent orbit sun serving intermediary orbit join orbit planet
according law celestial mechanic purpose original orbital motion must altered according location goal must accelerated ship away sun retarded approach sun
finally soon desired heavenly body reached independent motion con necting orbital path must changed ship must take relation new planet order carry manoeuver cir cling landing
return trip would take place way
accordingly clear course distant trip planetary space repeated change condition motion necessary
must time effected propulsion artificial power therefore require penditure fuel
expenditure according hohmanns calculation least orbit original planet visited cut connecting orbital path ship merely touched
event nec essary amount fuel considerable
still greater amount must added planet visited circled actually landed upon directly
amount fuel needed fact increase mass planet accordingly power attraction
understood considered ascending starting return trip requires considerable expenditure energy ready known ascent earth
furthermore braking landing must done mean propulsion recoil braking absence suitable atmosphere result tremendous increase neces sary fuel
moreover fuel must taken along trip earth least first visit remote planet could count beforehand able secure fuel needed return trip
chapter start surface earth commence trip directly surface earth overcome gravity would necessary also lift whole supply fuel
according previous mark demand extraordinary expenditure work
case hand least efficiency fuel available amount necessary taken along would accordingly make great part total weight ship con struction would hardly possible
visit heavenly body could undertaken directly earth surface mean fuel known would circum navigation moon purpose closer observation nature surface especially side always turned away earth
course could imprisoned moon circle often desired word ship move tangentially orbit planet leaf take path brings tangent orbit new planet energy required would minimum
editor problem space flying free orbit like satellite moon
amount fuel needed undertaking would much greater normal ascent earth practical limit gravity
spatial station basis spatial travel condition would considerably vorable however oberth proposes fuel depot constructed floating proper height earth constantly circling free orbit serve starting point trip instead earth
case slight expenditure work would needed entirely free earth ship would cordingly need loaded fuel nec cessary ascent earth
little would need taken along would required distant trip
since depot result free orbital tion would weightless fuel could simply placed amount freely floating point space
protected ray sun even oxygen hydrogen could kept definitely solid state
supplying would managed constant travelling space ship back forth
might earth moon
former case fuel least far consists liquefied oxygen hydrogen could produced great power plant operated heat tropical ocean
moon would especially advantageous base max valier suggests
mass accordingly force attraction much smaller earth would greatly lessen expenditure work needed cent therefore carrying fuel
certainly presupposes necessary raw material actually present moon least water even form ice
latter would electrolytically decomposed oxygen hydrogen required energy ing provided solar power plant
unfortunately probability great
case however could use moon also hohmann suggests start ing point spatial travel accordingly make fuel depot
spite many advantage plan oberths proposal freely floating depot seems favorable complete lease field attraction terrestrial region including moon would demand con siderably smaller expenditure energy
indeed standpoint economy energy would doubtless advantageous establish depot one several million kilometer earth especially fuel transported earth
shall nevertheless transfer station space making latter thereby base travelling already supplied equipment necessary
especially important part equipment would giant telescope
thanks unlimited efficiency would make po sible first examine minutely distance region travelled stellar world
furthermore space ship could kept constant observation large part trip frequently whole
mean light signal shown ship pointed time could communication least one side
thus spatial station aside many duty already mentioned would able initiate real travel universe also serve operating base spatial journey
accessibility neighboring planet ohmann thoroughly investigated problem visiting heavenly body
cording result expressed terrestrial chro nology trip earth venus would last day mar
round trip includ ing circumnavigation venus mar relatively slight distance eight million kilometer could performed year half
visiting venus landing upon cluding stay month together trip back quite year would required
let assume journey commence according previous observation spatial station final release field gravity earth would require little energy
return take place directly sur face earth energy need used
one descend merely brak ing air resistance
let weight trans ported two person together provision needed entire trip apparatus quired observation purpose
hohmann calculates space exploring ship ready start provided fuel necessary trip way must weigh approximately follows previously mentioned round trip including circumnavigation landing venus mar ton per cent fuel first landing moon ton venus ton mar ton
first three case per cent two percent entire weight ship would fuel
expulsion speed meter second earth assumed
clear construction ship carry rocket propulsion fuel making per cent entire weight would present considerable tech nical difficulty manufacture could hardly succeed present
accordingly moon larger heavenly body next could present question visit including science wonder story landing
however could best approach near planet circumnavigate without however landing
still hope course time aid principle sectional construction may finally succeed even technical mean known today construct ing space rocket even execute landing neighboring planet
fig showing two way body travel one planet another
first way shown left easier body leaf planet tangent orbital path travel sqi approach orbit next planet tangent path
smallest amount power required
second method shown right body forced cross orbit one planet get
would necessary calculation path take space badly done
method take greater amount power first body forced travel away sun therefore overcome greater distance sun gravitational pull
doubtless exhaust possibility seem offered spatial navigation pres ent state science
difficulty would far greater confront visit distant planet solar system
merely route travelled far longer hitherto considered
since planet greatly different distance sun earth reaching field gravity sun play considerable part
attraction would overcome energy
ample travel away sun ascend must overcome pull exactly manner travel away earth
shown previously mentioned change orbital speed sun necessary distant travel planetary space
wished descend one planet tremendous amount fuel would prove necessary especially case jupiter saturn
consequence enormous mass posse powerful field gravity
reaching fixed star extreme moteness alone make impossible consider ation
distant world affirm must time remain confined region earth neighboring planet
succeed creasing repulsion speed recoil action beyond amount perhaps meter second thus far reckoned highest practically tainable find possibility storing great amount energy small space situation would entirely different
chemist future develop propelling material far surpassing fect already known
even conceivable time shall succeed making technically serviceable using propel space ship tremendous amount energy confined matter energy whose existence already know
perhaps shall also find method using purpose electrical phenomenon cathode radiation way attain tremen dous increase repulsion speed electrical influence
might lastly come question suitable use sun radiation radium decomposition etc
certainly natural possibility future investi gator inventor still plentifully available respect
success result could visit actually set foot many faroff world yet view measurable distance starry heaven
ancient dream mankind
would ful fillment use
certainly science would make extraordinary gain
certain judg ment possible today regarding practical value
little know even nearest neighbor among heavenly body
moon still part region earth narrower home universe distant heavenly body one best known
cold covering air without higher form life
gigantic mass rock floating space fissured inhospitable rigid death world past
considerably le knowledge regard ing body next best known moon neighboring planet mar
comparison knowledge planet knowledge mar considerable
mar aged world though nearly old moon
mass therefore force attraction much le earth
indeed covering air yet far le density earth
surface air pressure certainly considerably lower even highest mountain top
apparently posse water
fairly large part may frozen mean temperature seems much earth even place martian equatorial belt comparatively high tem peratures determined
thinness atmosphere difference tem perature day night great
strangest discussed martian observation phenomenon socalled martian canal even though recently often regarded merely optical illusion really know nothing
problem space flying rate already know mar offer enough clue able form final judgment whether planet inhab ited intelligent creature creature
would hardly habitable person earth chiefly rarity mosphere
therefore would offer spatial navi gation extremely interesting object investiga tion scientific standpoint
whether landing would practical value well cannot recognized today certainty
hardly appears likely however
another matter second neighboring planet venus splendid shining heavenly body known morning star evening star size mass therefore force gravity prevailing surface slightly le earth
also covering air doubtless similar though somewhat deeper denser
unfortunately venus hard observe earth always appears near sun therefore visible twi light
accordingly still entirely uncertain rotation axis
period proximately earth twentyfour hour widely assumed venus earth would marked resemblance
therefore planet may mot reasonably count finding condition life similar earth even suspicion always covered cloud prove cor rect
even earth highly veloped life plant animal time part water filling ocean still form vapor
certainly heavenly body known venus offer greatest like lihood suited occupation thereby coming question future goal travel
since also nearest planet might well enticing object spatial navigation
mercury still nearer sun offer even le favorable condition observation venus
smallest planet cover ing air probably extremely thin surface apparently similar moon
reason especially closeness sun solar radiation nine time strong earth extremely unfa vorable temperature condition must prevail
mercury would accordingly hardly invit ing place visit
although considering previously men tioned planet possible arrive fairly probable result far know insufficient purpose case distant jupiter saturn uranus neptune
indeed able determine dense covering air
question nature surface planet however still entirely uncertain
jupiter saturn densely enveloped condensa tion product cloud sort apparently see real surface
case uranus neptune extreme remoteness prevents exact servation
concerning value goal space travel difficult say anything
yet merely cir cumstance determined case planet relatively low average density earth lead con clusion different physical condition must exist earth
alone must greatly lessen expectation visit
still would perhaps possible satellite planet especially jupiter would offer comparatively favor able prospect
one thing absolutely certain mass consequent force field gravity planet tremendously greater earth would make visiting acceleraton middle deceleration
total distance covered direction demotion fig
speed curve showing method acceleration decel eration going point
body uniformly accelerated rest reach maximum speed halfway uniformly decelerated come rest traordinarily difficult especially case jupiter saturn
regarding finally various body longing solar system reasonably certain today could hardly derive special prac tical benefit visit
see therefore may timistic advantage expected member solar system
thus far certainly know far little let thought free rein respect
might well world prove entirely worthless
hand perhaps would find many fertile soil plant animal possibly sort entirely odd strange
might even gigantic size like existing earth
indeed incredible might find even human being similar creature maybe even po sessing civilization different even older ative planet
even highly probable life distant planet case exists another level earth
