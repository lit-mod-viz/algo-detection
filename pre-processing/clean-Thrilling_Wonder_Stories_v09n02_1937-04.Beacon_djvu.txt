space limited undertake answer three question letter
hood correspondence received make impractical also promise immediate answer every case
however question general interest receive careful attention
organic compound editor science question answer surprised day find chemical formula cane sugar milk sugar seems little odd since different sweetening power
little chemistry ive always understood different substance must differ ent formula
gloucester virginia
study sugar related com pound belongs realm organic chemistry compound carbon
incredibly numerous compound containing carbon due latter remarkable ability hook almost anything chain ring formation
sugar basically foimula given put together different way resulting difference taste appearance chemical activity
atom general sugar molecule arranged merely chance could different combination
dozen known however
organic chemistry formula mean nothing
simply indicate pro portion weight carbon hydrogen oxygen
true indication compo sition organic chemist us structural formula show exactly molecule put together
show change position atom sugar quite different
typical example common alcohol formula methyl ether poisonous
look chemist structural formula see different
alcohol methyl ether difference hooking make difference tween liquid drunk one cannot besides many differ nces
phenomenon sleep editor science question answer sleeping explained
brain sleep heart lung
brooklyn
phenomenon sleep lately much clarified
intensive biochemical search revealed rhythm life
pulsates much like wave
pulsation period activity rest
activity drive body chemical process one direction toward fatigue
state characterized presence excess phosphate blood
complete cycle organic organism must rest
allows chemical process reverse prepare stretch activity
fortunately however nature pro vided heart lung different system rest period brain muscle bodj cell general
necessary animal ganism cannot survive extended period rest heart lung stomach
organ work rest pulsate rapidly
heartbeat heart rest fraction second
breath lung take short nap total amount rest day time heart give body lie sleep
canal mar editor science question answer discussion canal mar
isnt definitely known whether
one would think easily observed phenomenon would settled long ago
madison wisconsin
strange say authenticity martian canal proved
shiaparelli vho admittedly sharpeyed announced saw fine line marking mar called canali unfortunately italian word far suggestive transposed english
shiaparelli meant channel manmade canal
since bi time discussion waxed furious
famous astronomer corroborated discovery
equally famous one denied existence
lately becoming gen erally credited regular numerous marking occur shiaparelli lowell claimed see
experiment conducted laboratory indicate human eye mind tendency connect faint spot marking wholly imaginary straight line
case viewing mar tele scope image hazy best
literally take conscious straining eye distinguish even larger marking
socalled canal limit visibility may subjective imagined rather objective seen
photography failed reveal mythical canal
claim made justifiably der best condition eye sensitive photographic plate still positive evidence either side
perhaps sure check grossing question man find way traverse space explore mar
filterable virus editor science question answer ive noticed filterable virus called living liquid farley story recently
science fiction aside truly alive
san francisco calif
strictly speaking answer probably
filterable virus seem quality subtle poison living matter
seems disease like mosaic disease tobacco plant silkworm jaundice produce lethal substance able interfere metabolism healthy tissue
unlike culture germ virus filterable finest porcelain filter indicating must colloidal composition
whatever sub stance reinfect tissue disease produced composed germ microorganism know present
