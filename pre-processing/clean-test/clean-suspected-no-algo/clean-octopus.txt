vanamees lean spare face olive pallor
long black hairsuch one see saint evangelist preraphaeliteartists hung ear
presley remarked pointed beardblack fine growing hollow cheek

presley took careful note surprised toobserve certain new look vanamees deepset eye
remembered nowthat morning vanamee singularly reserved
