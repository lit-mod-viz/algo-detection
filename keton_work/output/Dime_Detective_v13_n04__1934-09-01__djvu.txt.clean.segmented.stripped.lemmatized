i laugh 
-PRON- canot blame -PRON- for want to stick close to the police

i canot blame -PRON- dean for be frightened 
but -PRON- doesnot need protection 
the murder syndicate be purely business 
-PRON- leave alone those who run with the police 
-PRON- be out for easy money 
but see mortimer doran and -PRON- good friend ramsey 
mortimer doran do shake hand with vee brown

ramsey shrug -PRON- shoulder 
but how many get these note and be payingor wait to see what happen 
well say brown -PRON- have seven letter 
surely the syndicate will not know that all of the seven man have come to the police 
some one of -PRON- will receive a later note indicate the payoff 
yes yes say mortimer doran 
but what of this present threat 
some poor devil tonight 
must -PRON- sit idly by and wait until a man be murderedhorribly murder 
since -PRON- canot prevent crime let -PRON- sit down and wait for -PRON- to happen say vee brown take every step as i outline -PRON- -PRON- grin at doran 
the district attorney look at ramsey 
everyone be cover -PRON- ask 
everyone eye widen 
so the suggestion come from brown then 
well i can account for every name on -PRON- listeven the one supply by the government raise -PRON- eyebrow 
the federal authority be in this 
certainly 
ramsey snap 
the department of justice be peculiar that way 
-PRON- donot like the united state mail be use for threat of murder extortion or even blackmail 
will -PRON- wait here mr doran 
brown ask 
doran say as -PRON- move toward the door -PRON- place be at -PRON- office 
i just want to let -PRON- know and see if -PRON- have any suggestion as to whom the victim may be 
hardly say brown 
and with a smile wait willing to bet there will be no murder tonight do everything to prevent -PRON- 
hell say melrose 
if -PRON- flunk out on this the syndicate be throughwashe up after the last fiasco a wonder brown -PRON- doesnot take a crack at -PRON- attempt -PRON- life 
-PRON- do say brown 
-PRON- do 
and with the curve lip and flippant air that always annoy -PRON- and i find -PRON- quite amusing 
-PRON- see i shoot -PRON- agent right through the center of the ear mouth hang open 
-PRON- start to speak then didnot 
but -PRON- look over -PRON- shoulder as the three man leave the door have hardly close when mortimer doran return alone 
that be true about wallace then 
-PRON- think the murder syndicate send -PRON- sure of -PRON- say vee 
now tell mewhy do ramsey cart melrose around with -PRON- stroke -PRON- chin look to see that the hall door be very nearly lead -PRON- to this murderer before 
between -PRON- and -PRON- i think melrose have receive another threat or learn something vee brown frown a shrewd man -PRON- say 
if -PRON- can make a sucker out of ramsey well and good 
and rub -PRON- chin -PRON- may have something up -PRON- sleeve 
the reward be fairly big 
doran nod 
ludwig be one of the first to be find nail a cool twentyfive thousand to -PRON- yesterday and a newspaper jump -PRON- another ten 
-PRON- rub at -PRON- forehead wish -PRON- would cut -PRON- out -PRON- see -PRON- not a question of money a question of money with teddy melrose 
-PRON- make no bone about that hesitate hold -PRON- hand on the doorknob finally blurt out like this vee 
teddy melrose have be see a lot of gertrude la palatin lately 
dime detective magazine yes thin eyebrow raise see -PRON- tather well know that yon and -PRON- and suddenly clap a hand down on shoulder a fine girl and -PRON- be a fine fellow and and say vee 
certainly -PRON- manner didnot invite further talk on that subject 
but that didnot deter mortimer doran 
and woman will talk 
-PRON- pause then go on hurriedly 
not that i think -PRON- would or that -PRON- hear anything from -PRON- to talk about 
but i be wonder if ramsey put melrose on -PRON- 
and -PRON- be think say brown that -PRON- would rather have the head of this murder syndicate catch by the office than by ramsey 
anything else voice be abrupt 
doran stiffen then smile 
nothing else along that lineexcept that teddy melrose be a very engaging man 
brown grin yon worry about -PRON- or -PRON- office 
go home and sleep 
and sleep say the with some poor devil about to fee crucify donot think there will be any poor devil murder like that tonight 
the police certainly should be able to prevent -PRON- 
-PRON- donot know the intend victimthat true 
but -PRON- should know the hire assassin tonight hope -PRON- be right 
god i hope -PRON- be right mortimer doran say with feeling be do that could be do 
good night 
the murder syndicate mortimer doran have go brown turn to -PRON- 
teddy melrose eh 
pal have pick strange company become a sort of stool pigeon for ramsey 
-PRON- know 
pal tell -PRON- -PRON- be go to play -PRON- along as hot on this thing as -PRON- be as anxious to get the head of the murder syndicate 
and melrose know -PRON- way around 
after all -PRON- interest may be in the reward nothing bad about teddy melrose 
i meet -PRON- in well day sell investment now and i understand that consider condition -PRON- s do well 
nothing bad and nothing good about -PRON- brown agree 
and suddenly pal hasnot be around 
oh come 
vee i tell -PRON- flat 
-PRON- save -PRON- life of course but -PRON- put -PRON- in the position of need that life save then practically blame -PRON- for be there know 
brown be irritate 
-PRON- name and picture in all the paper the hero of the city 
shoot big boy wallace to death while -PRON- hold a machine gun 
i feel like a fool 
i donot know why but feed that the head of the murder syndicate be laugh at -PRON- have make a fool out of -PRON- 
but how -PRON- 
i donot know how 
i switch the subject 
about this death tonight what make -PRON- feed -PRON- happen 
brown hesitate then hurst out with a fiend dean and quite capable of nail a live man to a wall 
but -PRON- hasnot act himselfat least alone hire other 
first -PRON- be just by pass along the name of the victim through rossimire the jewder and the name of the criminal -PRON- have pick for the job 
later perhaps -PRON- make direct contact with -PRON- murderersmaybe through wallace maybe by phone certainly keep himsdf unknown to -PRON- the point dean 
there be hundred thousand of man in new york red friday city who will shoot a man to death for a price stick a knife in -PRON- toss -PRON- from a cliff beat -PRON- to death 
but just how many of these criminal would nail a live man to a wall 
a man have get to be more than a criminal to do that get to be pretty vicious 
right 
a degenerate a madman and the occasional fiend who take pleasure in inflict horrible torture 
i believe -PRON- leader of the murder syndicate be such a man a man with a hate of -PRON- fellowman 
now how be -PRON- go to find man to kill like that 
certainly not just by chance get to use professional talent know criminal 
brown pause 
and such professional fiendishness be rare 
everyone who would do such an actevery professional criminal i mean who may be know to the head of this murder also know to the police 
wallace be one of -PRON- and -PRON- be dead 
a glance over the police record locate other prison record find -PRON- more 
so -PRON- be able to make up a list of thirtythree know criminal who would not be above crucify a victim 
-PRON- run down that list have be at -PRON- ever since loudon be find so murder in -PRON- own house 
six of -PRON- be dead eleven in prison four deport four in state hospital for the insane 
that leave eight 
of those eight three have be locate out of the state and the other five have be shadow day and night 
oh not say the list be complete but -PRON- seem to -PRON- thatin hunt out man for -PRON- purpose criminal that be know and who will go to the length -PRON- demandsthis murder fiend will pick one of those man 
there -PRON- be dean 
-PRON- have thousand to choose from for murder but -PRON- s limited when -PRON- come to nail live human being to wall 
if -PRON- approach these man or if any one of these man try to actwhy -PRON- will get -PRON- tonight and -PRON- think this murder syndicate leader be one of these remain five 
no say brown donot 
i think -PRON- s a man who have start from scratch 
well know in the underworld of course but not suspect as a criminal 
a man who suddenly see the idea conceive the murder racket and understand the fear and terror create in other victim of -PRON- extortion by such horrible murder 
i may be wrong but i donot think so 
-PRON- take more than a criminal mind to kill even an enemy like that 
so i donot think murder will take place tonight 
even if -PRON- donot know the victim -PRON- may know and so have shadow the prospective murderer have hardly finish when the phone rang 
i go across to the table and lift -PRON- 
the voice be even steady slightly sarcastic and unnatural 
be this vee brown the great detective 
no i say 
but the voice say this be the murder syndicate 
after a silence i stammer thethe head of the murder syndicate 
-PRON- may call -PRON- that but i be all of -PRON- 
the murder syndicate 
put that toy detective on if -PRON- s there 
brown be already at the phone have take -PRON- from -PRON- hand pull -PRON- close to listen 
this be vee brown talking 
-PRON- voice be calm even quiet the voice laugh -PRON- be even a pleasant laugh have call to return -PRON- very kind favor 
-PRON- favor 
certainly 
-PRON- be evidently one of those rare bighearted person who do an enemy a good deed dismiss -PRON- from -PRON- mind 
i meanabout wallace 
big boy wallace 
live -PRON- would have do -PRON- a lot of harm 
-PRON- be too careful for -PRON- to kill so -PRON- be kind of -PRON- dime detective magazine to do -PRON- for -PRON- 
-PRON- see -PRON- know who i really be 
so -PRON- send -PRON- to -PRON- to be kill 
yes 
the murder syndicate go on easily 
-PRON- be rather amusing quite a gambler 
i really didnot know which one of -PRON- would die 
-PRON- hardly matter do -PRON- 
with wallace dead -PRON- couldnot tell -PRON- with -PRON- dead wallace wouldnot have -PRON- to tell 
-PRON- chuckle now 
but i like the way -PRON- turn out 
i would have have to pay wallace a rather large sum of money for kill -PRON- 
as -PRON- be i get wallaoe kill for nothing 
how could -PRON- be sure i wouldnot take -PRON- alive 
the little lady would assure -PRON- of that and i say impetuous nature 
-PRON- see tell -PRON- -PRON- would be in the closet a moment pause 
and do -PRON- know i half suspect -PRON- would be there just fool enough to improve on -PRON- plan sorry i wasnot there to see -PRON- 
but the paper give a most vivid account 
-PRON- make a man out of -PRON- while i make sap out of -PRON- 
-PRON- be as if brown think aloud 
exactly now i wish to return the favor let -PRON- know where to find the body 
yes know have seven letter from -PRON- client and -PRON- have spend week try to think as i would think 
the man professional criminal suit for -PRON- particular job 
and gruffly well -PRON- be right 
most criminal be fool that s why i work unknown 
-PRON- make thing difficult for -PRON- 
have i -PRON- attention 
yes vee say in a low voice as if -PRON- be afraid the man would hang up listen quite carefully 
good 
but -PRON- forgot mr vee brown that there be hundred thousand right in the city who will knock a man on the head for a very few dollar and deliver -PRON- at a certain place 
oh i abhor the physical end of long i nail up mymy advertisement and -PRON- s ready for exhibitiontonight head jar back and so do mine 
who be -PRON- 
where be -PRON- 
-PRON- be a hosiery salesman from illinois with a wife and three small child 
so i pick -PRON- 
why 
why 
business 
the paper will make -PRON- a higger storymore picture 
the wife and child -PRON- know 
and -PRON- client will be more impressed 
but -PRON- be only the beginning 
now the one big splurge 
the murder syndicate will strike once more strike at one of the big name of die cityand so collect a fortune 
but this man

what good do the note do then 
-PRON- know -PRON- didnot come to the police dean but the man the syndicate demand money know how many of know -PRON- think -PRON- statement to the paper just an attempt to cover -PRON- own inefficiency 
-PRON- own inefficiency 
mortimer doran say 
perhaps -PRON- be right 
so the murderer call -PRON- on the telephone call cleary of the clarion too 
there be a leak brown say 
this murder syndicate know of -PRON- sudden interest in a certain type of criminal and be therefore smart enough to avoid contact with any of -PRON- 
of course -PRON- may be possible to trace the man or man who deliver the victim to the shack but there be thousand who would do that for a few hundred dollarsnot know the truth of course 
tomorrow when -PRON- do learn the truthwell -PRON- hardly possible that -PRON- will be anxious to talk and impossible that -PRON- know who the man be who hire -PRON- 
but -PRON- the leak that interest -PRON- 
if -PRON- could trace that leak 
hell 
mortimer doran be jar into animation talk like a child 
-PRON- know as much about police business as i do and a damn sight more 
-PRON- must have use a hundred man in look up those record trail man send wire all over the country 
brown nodded call to wong to stop the car lean out and buy a paper from a boy who be bellow extra -PRON- snap on the dome light

for there spread across the whole front page of the clarion be a picturea photograph of the frightful thing i have see two short hour before 
red friday vee brown say finally so cleary have a cameraman with -PRON- 
-PRON- telephone in -PRON- story and the lad rush back with the plate even before geary notify the police

-PRON- be to gather the sensational 
and to -PRON- -PRON- see dean the inhuman monster -PRON- call mad see to -PRON- that the advertising value of hishis murder be fully take advantage of 
and there s no way to find -PRON- 
this from doran as -PRON- stop before -PRON- house 
only one i can think of now vee answer absently 
locate a house where this tap the front page of the kept and frame and well have -PRON- murder monster 
doran stand at the curb and look at vee 
by godl -PRON- say not try to be funny 
brown shake -PRON- head 
no 
any man who could treat another human so with money the only motive must have the type of brain that would glory in keep such a reminder of -PRON- act 
and suddenly ride hell out of -PRON- in the paper but i think the little salesman from illinois do not die in vain 
i think -PRON- death will lead to the murder syndicate 
how

-PRON- have a visitor 
-PRON- be an excited nervous little man who have inherit money and live out on long island 
-PRON- name be seymour brentwood and -PRON- look every letter of the name 
-PRON- be talk when i come into the room hope the thing not a joke mr brown 
i hope one of the neighbor wouldnot perpetrate such a joke 
yeti come to -PRON- becausewell i didnot want -PRON- name toss about in the press 
-PRON- wifes a steven -PRON- know 
the massachusetts steven 
-PRON- family wouldnot like -PRON- a bit 
do -PRON- show -PRON- to -PRON- wifeanyone 
no i didnot 
though the room be not warm the man rub great bead of perspiration from -PRON- head a ghastly joke though 
i have just read -PRON- paper when the note come 
brown have pass the note to -PRON- and i be read -PRON- 
dear mr brentwoodyou have already read in -PRON- morning paper of the unfortunate and horrible death of janie francis stacey in the shack on staten island 
if -PRON- will examine the post mark on this envelope -PRON- will note that the letter be receive in the united state post office several hour before the dead body be find 
-PRON- have be select by to pay the sum of twentyfive thousand dollar in cash or meet the same unpleasant fate 
therefore -PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to get together that amount in bill of small denomination before noon on saturday the fourteenth of the present month 
on that date -PRON- will receive in the first mail full instruction as to how to turn this money over to the murder syndicate 
the paper no doubt have also inform -PRON- that on the night of friday the thirteenth a very prominent citizen will die 
on the morning of the fourteenth -PRON- will receive a letter tell -PRON- who this man be and the post mark of this letter will convince -PRON- that the dead man be alive and well the very moment that letter to -PRON- be receive by the united state post office 
-PRON- have appeal to the police 
but -PRON- have plan -PRON- death and nothing can save -PRON- 
if after this man die and -PRON- read the letter -PRON- be not convinced that -PRON- demand must be meet -PRON- can give -PRON- but one more demonstration 
that isto nail -PRON- own living body to a wall 
red friday -PRON- see the point donot -PRON- 
dean 
just as i say 
but why doesnot the murder syndicate mail the letter sooner if -PRON- want to convince -PRON- victim the police canot protect the man 
good old stupid dean 
vee ignore -PRON- agitated visitor 
the thing be simple 
if -PRON- know the victim -PRON- could very easily protect -PRON- 
only the murder syndicate know the victim until after the crie have be commit 
-PRON- have lay -PRON- plan pick -PRON- victim and be sure enough to name -PRON- in a letter before -PRON- be kill or even take by -PRON- 
partly conceit dean but mostly good business 
-PRON- be rather horrify for those threaten to know that when that letter be write the victim be alive and well 
also -PRON- impress -PRON- with the murder inevitability 
-PRON- do the same thing at the time of ludwig death turn to the nervous little man not a joke mr from -PRON- -PRON- say seriously 
-PRON- cross the room and lay both -PRON- hand on the man shoulder 
-PRON- be fortunate in come to -PRON- 
i can save -PRON- life and i can save -PRON- money 
-PRON- must not tell what be in this letter to anyone not anyone 
vee fold the letter and put -PRON- in -PRON- pocket 
if -PRON- obey that simple instruction i promise -PRON- -PRON- will be quite safe 
but -PRON- saythe letter say hethis man go to the police and 
-PRON- point at pocket if -PRON- notice the envelope that contain the letter -PRON- slightly blur but the post mark be sixthirty 
i put a magnify glass on -PRON- 
-PRON- see dean vee half throw at -PRON- 
the very fact that this murder syndicate can convince -PRON- victim that -PRON- letter be write some hour before the body be find strike -PRON- with a sort of awe a terror 
and of course -PRON- believe that the murdered man be not only know to the police but have seek police protection 
even such a stouthearte citizen as mr brentwood feel the influence 
brentwood stammer feel -PRON- a duty to come not afraid mr that 
-PRON- laugh be shrill and false 
but -PRON- wife -PRON- know 
-PRON- familythe steven 
good god 
to be nail to a wall like that the -PRON- stop -PRON- 
certainly 
brown nodded 
-PRON- be in an enviable position mr brentwood 
upon -PRON- action from now on until the night of the thirteenth rest the life of a man perhaps the life and happiness of many menbut at least the life of the one mention in this letter 
yes yes 
but i donot quite understand 
bent shoulder straighten slightly 
if -PRON- didnot get word -PRON- get the tone of -PRON- voiceone of respect admirationand -PRON- like -PRON- 
and that s even nobler say brown 
do this for the good of -PRON- city and not fully understand -PRON- 
-PRON- promise 
-PRON- will do nothing 
act as -PRON- always act 
-PRON- take hand 
good 
dean take mr brentwood out the back entrance through the court and see -PRON- safely in a cab 
i get brentwood as far as the door when -PRON- turn jerk -PRON- arm free make a couple of false start and finally get the word out want to do what i can mr brown 
but i must think of -PRON- wife may draw the money from the bank 
-PRON- will look like good faith 
that mr brentwood be -PRON- own business 
i shall treat -PRON- visit confidentially as -PRON- request when -PRON- come in 
but if -PRON- do as i say act -PRON- normal self and donot go around talk there will be no murder syndicate to pay dime detective magazine the money to on the morning of saturday the fourteenth 
when i get back to the apartment vee brown be rub -PRON- hand hum softly have to go back downstairs again 
dean 
to let in mr wiley 
-PRON- donot know -PRON- eh 
a broker do business with -PRON- 
-PRON- see -PRON- s about build age general appearance just a chance that the apartment be watch and brentwood be spot come in 
and -PRON- want this wiley to come in the back and go out the front as brentwood 
not exactly 
i want -PRON- to go out the front as wiley 
if -PRON- s shadow -PRON- will know -PRON- s a broker who have do business with -PRON- before -PRON- be a full half hour later a that wiley have come and go 
after see -PRON- out the front entrance i return to brown with the information that a man have slip around the comer and follow wiley in a taxi

i want to have a word with -PRON- in private after mr doran and inspector ramsey leave 
teddy eyebrow go up fish eye stare

mortimer doran do most of the talking have visitor downtown 
inspector ramsey be kind enough to call -PRON- in 
brown let -PRON- read the letter mortimer doran hold out 
there be nine of -PRON- 
-PRON- be all the same copy of letter 
only the amount differ think there would be more than that doran say think the murder syndicate with this threat about the thirteenth be go into -PRON- wholesale 
maybe -PRON- have ramsey cut in 
maybe other man who get the same note be scare stiff 
take these man here 
ramsey tap the letter 
all of -PRON- well fix and the amount well within -PRON- mean 
-PRON- may be like that with many other and -PRON- intend to pay or just to sit tight and see what happen on the thirteenth 
and with a half sneer mr doran tell -PRON- -PRON- have get thing sew up brown so nothing will happen on the thirteenth 
perhaps i have 
-PRON- be to let mr doran know for certain today i understand right 
-PRON- have any caller 
anyone with a letter come straight to -PRON- 
hardly 
brown smile 
but like to interview the man who come to see -PRON- get a list of -PRON- name 
ramsey give -PRON- to vee 
everything open and above board -PRON- dope eh be expect a tip 
indeed have the tip but expect something else later in the day 
and turn to doran sorry -PRON- speak of this 
in a way i mean -PRON- to be confidential 
well doran saidand well again have to say something right 
melrose speak for the second time give -PRON- quite red friday a sendoff mr brown

something like that 
early afternoon edition 
brown look at doran 
doran shuffle -PRON- foot look toward the ceiling 
then -PRON- suddenly bluster yes i give -PRON- out 
what the hell could i do 
the place be lousy with reporter 
i have to say something 
and damn -PRON- 
brown give -PRON- -PRON- way in this case let -PRON- run thing to suit -PRON- get to make good 
or -PRON- will take -PRON- out of -PRON- hide friday the thirteenth 
well i donot blame -PRON- 
so7 face shoot forward 
why have to drag in the leader of the murder syndicate of course go out and get -PRON- 
not exactly say vee and that twist little smile be in one comer of -PRON- mouth wonot go out and get -PRON- sit down and let -PRON- come to -PRON- didnot like -PRON- 
but teddy melrose stay behind after -PRON- leave 
the door be hardly closed when vee come back into the living room and stand face melrose 
melrose -PRON- say the racket 
melrose smile down at the diminutive detective all right -PRON- say 
miss la palatin say -PRON- speak to -PRON- 
and do -PRON- approve 
broad shoulder shrug 
not exactly 
i think -PRON- be premature disclose -PRON- suggestion 
suggestion echo brown 
and then -PRON- mean threat mean exactly what i saidsuggestion 
-PRON- be in a position to send miss la palatin to prison 
-PRON- know that melrose stiffen be quite aware of that then say brown be quite aware of this 
i be very fond of miss la palatin 
a moment pause 
maybe more than just fond of -PRON- 
i want to impress -PRON- melrose 
-PRON- blackmail miss la palatin open -PRON- mouth about -PRON- pastand get -PRON- kill -PRON- eh 
-PRON- eye widen 
by god 
i believe -PRON- would 
believe -PRON- 
a blackmailer should teddy right hand swung quickly 
-PRON- be a hard blow but not particularly well timed 
brown be always quick but now -PRON- only move -PRON- head 
the fist whiz by harmlessly 
melrose grunt jar back 
-PRON- have not seenneither have gun that be there now in hand plant hard into -PRON- stomach sorry mr melrose say brown but nature have not gift -PRON- with great physical strength 
i wouldnot try another blow 
melrose grinnedactually grin 
and -PRON- wasnot a bad grin 
put up the gun -PRON- say lose -PRON- head 
and when the gun disappear with a single quick motion there 
i can talk better not a blackmailer and didnot like the word 
but i see -PRON- point 
miss la palatin can withdraw from -PRON- little understanding any time -PRON- wish and need have no fear that ill ever talk 
to -PRON- -PRON- be simply business 
what do -PRON- want out of -PRON- want money 
the crime have be of a ghastly nature 
i be shocked and horrify like anyone else 
but not a fool 
i want only one thing out of -PRON- 
-PRON- lean forward now want money all i can getall the traffic will bear 
i want money 
there -PRON- be 
if -PRON- donot want miss la palatin in -PRON- get -PRON- out of itcome in -PRON- 
what about ramsey 
what about -PRON- 
melrose fairly fling the word at brown 
-PRON- think dime detective magaxii -PRON- s use -PRON- and will drop -PRON- when the break come if i donot drop -PRON- first do ramsey know -PRON- see this man 
-PRON- know that i see a man and -PRON- know that i think i recognize that man stall ramsey along 
-PRON- smile ostensibly try to stir up -PRON- memory look for the face i see nod 
so that s -PRON- why -PRON- didnot want -PRON- to see -PRON- alone not accountable to ramsey 
melrose sort of stiffen 
nor to any man 
but if -PRON- want to work with -PRON- willing 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- that through miss la would finally convince -PRON- i be rightand then through -PRON- be the good way to work -PRON- 
i see the man 
i know who -PRON- be up to -PRON- to trap -PRON- or get a confession out of -PRON- 
i canot do that 
fitzpatrick eh 
that seem unbelievable 
maybe -PRON- do say melrose 
but that s the man i see fire the shot through the window that kill ulrich rossimire 
take -PRON- or leave -PRON- 
-PRON- can have all the glory as long as i get the money 
and after a bit when brown do not answer at once call miss la palatin off if -PRON- want not a blackmailer never make trouble for -PRON- 
brown shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- donot know that girl -PRON- say never quit never lie down on the job 
well melrose say be -PRON- with -PRON- 
-PRON- eye narrow 
remember miss la palatin give -PRON- word that get the moneyall of -PRON- 
brown extend -PRON- hand look straight at melrose misjudge -PRON- i guess 
yes -PRON- have -PRON- word 
-PRON- get the moneyall of -PRON- 
melrose hold the hand a moment finally drop -PRON- how will -PRON- work -PRON- 
have -PRON- watch 
no not exactly 
-PRON- mustnot make -PRON- suspicious give -PRON- plenty of rope until next friday night 
watch -PRON- then when -PRON- go to shudder be quite visible tell -PRON- brown there be time when scared 
-PRON- donot need to be too close to the police 
the murder syndicate know that 
-PRON- would be sheer bravado to strike at -PRON- 
melrose twist up -PRON- face 
bravado or not -PRON- wouldnot do -PRON- much good if i be deadlike that on a wall 
there be more talk 
brown saying -PRON- would work -PRON- out and melrose continually come back to the question of money 
and when -PRON- speak of money -PRON- speak of those who have rob -PRON- 
when -PRON- be go brown say -PRON- see -PRON- too not just greed 
dean 
the man want desperately to regain -PRON- lose place in the world 
and this passion of -PRON- to start over to strut the city again may help -PRON- a lot 
if -PRON- go to ramsey ramsey with the paper at -PRON- heel would make the arrest and try to beat the truth out of fitzpatrick 
-PRON- donot think -PRON- be fitzpatrick get an open mind 
brown stroke -PRON- chin 
-PRON- see -PRON- quite possible that the leader of this murder syndicate be not at the house that night and do not fire the shot through the window 
fitzpatrick may have do that yet not be the leaderand not even know who the leader be 
-PRON- donot think fitzpatrick capable of how can -PRON- tell what a man be capable of 
i donot know what capable of -PRON- 
look at -PRON- this way dean 
this leader be a shrewd man and -PRON- know that gertrude la palatin be very close to -PRON- 
the moment -PRON- meet -PRON- red friday wouldnot -PRON- suspect that i suspect -PRON- 
grant that fitzpatrick be this man would -PRON- believe -PRON- a mere coincidence that -PRON- meet 
would -PRON- have dinner with -PRON- or kill -PRON- 
i cry out suddenly 
would -PRON- 
brown shake -PRON- head 
would -PRON- kill -PRON- when -PRON- be know shed be with -PRON- that give to -PRON- tiie very proof i seek 
no -PRON- wouldnot kill -PRON- dean 
but if -PRON- isnot this leader then pal may learn something 
for if melrose tell the truththen fitzpatrick be pay by the murder syndicate to commit murder off to washington worried about -PRON- of course but that s not good logic 
reason tell -PRON- -PRON- s safe safe than -PRON- s ever be 
and -PRON- be go didnot tell -PRON- the same thing that -PRON- tell brown -PRON- didnot tell -PRON- anything at all 
thing be so utterly jumble 
and that s how thing stand if -PRON- do stand at all when brown call -PRON- up from washington and say -PRON- would have to wait over until monday as the man -PRON- want to see be out of the capitol for the weekend 
-PRON- be monday night when -PRON- come back and tuesday night pal have dinner with -PRON- in the apartment there be nothing new to tell about fitzpatrick 
on the level vee -PRON- tell -PRON- seriously donot know if -PRON- s onto -PRON- or not but -PRON- do seem to enjoy -PRON- 
and when vee frowned donot mean just -PRON- company as if -PRON- be laugh inside at something 
-PRON- lean forward then have a date with -PRON- for dinner and the theater on thursday 
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- couldnot possibly see -PRON- have a very important engagement 
-PRON- have 
i pop that out 
how do -PRON- look when -PRON- say -PRON- voice be quiet but -PRON- black eye flash 
-PRON- be smile 
just smile and nodding at -PRON- almost as if -PRON- be confidential 
brown get up and pace the room 
if -PRON- s in this thing the man a fool to act like that to say what -PRON- do 
and after a pause fitzpatrick never be a fool 
the monster strike a atmosphere of tenseness and horror hang over the entire city 
at least -PRON- seem that way to -PRON- 
i know i didnot sleep much and when i do wake up with a start bathe in perspiration with a picture in -PRON- mind that only long pacing of the room and numerous cigarette would erase 
the paper keep the thing on the front page 
if the murder syndicate want advertising -PRON- certainly get -PRON- 
such a threat such a menace have never hang over the city before 
there be numerous picture of jame francis stacey -PRON- wife and child 
and vee brown 
i have trouble get -PRON- even to make a semblance of act on the case 
but i do persuade -PRON- to go and interview personally every man who have come to the police with a letter a waste of time 
dean -PRON- argue 
but -PRON- be right get to do -PRON- 
-PRON- would seem strange to the head of this murder syndicate if i didnot and make -PRON- suspect that i have a visitor of -PRON- but what can -PRON- visitor do to help that the other canot lot dean 
a whole lot 
somehow this monster know who go to the police and who doesnot 
-PRON- lay off those who do 
and i donot want -PRON- to lay off -PRON- little friend seymour brentwood 
that be early in the week and brown dime detective magazine have not tell -PRON- why -PRON- go to washington nor could i think out the reason 
pal call -PRON- up every night and twice during the day 
-PRON- promise brown that 
-PRON- be still go with fitzpatrick and be now thoroughly convinced that -PRON- be not only not the head of the murder syndicate but have nothing to do with -PRON- 
thursday night and the paper still carry the storythe distress of the widowthe loss of an adore husband and worship father 
as a matter of fact brown tell -PRON- stacey be neither a good husband nor a good father 
-PRON- neglect -PRON- family 
-PRON- be half clothe and half feed 
-PRON- make a good salary but -PRON- spend plenty when -PRON- come on to the city 
-PRON- like to run around the reason -PRON- wasnot miss 
-PRON- be nothing for -PRON- to disappear from -PRON- hotel for day at a time 
i daresay some dame pick -PRON- up deliver -PRON- over to the boy who finally bring -PRON- to staten island 
-PRON- lean forward suddenly 
do -PRON- know what i do in washington 
no 
i say eagerly 
and then if -PRON- be go to tell -PRON- go ahead if -PRON- be just go to talk around thing why go to tell -PRON- 
dean 
i go to see the postoffice authority the big gun 
do -PRON- know what i want 
dean 
and when i didnot go back to the death of ludwig loudon 
-PRON- be kill well after midnight 
the next morning several prospective client of the murder syndicate receive letter say that loudon would die and those letter be postmark early in the evening before -PRON- death 
with stacey -PRON- be different 
the letter be not only post long after -PRON- be take but four to six hour before -PRON- be find 
with the next victim the murder syndicate have promise to send -PRON- letter while the man be alive and free 
-PRON- see the point 
i confess that i didnot stroke -PRON- chin 
well if i could have one of those letter in -PRON- hand name the prominent man to be murder while the victim be still free i could prevent -PRON- murder 
not only prevent the murder but catch the murder syndicate right in the commission of -PRON- crime 
but how vee 
i be puzzle 
the letter be never deliver until the next morning 
the victim of the extortion donot get -PRON- until long after the man be deadand find 
no -PRON- uncle sam do 
-PRON- be in the united state post office what i go to washington about 
i want just one of those letter name this prominent manbefore -PRON- be take and kill 
but how brentwoodj 
seymour brentwood 
i want that letter as soon as -PRON- be receive in the post office 
see dean 
if i have the name of the next prominent victim to be nail up and have -PRON- before the crime take place i donot have to go out and find the monster who run this murder syndicate 
i can wait until -PRON- come to -PRON- wait with the prominent victim 
-PRON- grin crookedly the postal authority do -PRON- what i ask -PRON- 
brown nodded 
but let -PRON- tell -PRON- 
i talk to a big manhis name would surprise -PRON- 
-PRON- listen lift -PRON- phone talk to several people 
finally -PRON- turn to -PRON- 
-PRON- say have -PRON- letter mr brown have -PRON- five minute after -PRON- be receive at any post office 
no ifs and but dean 
a straight statement 
but if the victim be already take accord to letter -PRON- would be alive and well 
and -PRON- couldnot have take -PRON- now forget this be to be a prominent man 
if -PRON- be miss any length of time the family would be worry -PRON- business associate red friday and the police would be notify not a sure thing 
but i think the murder syndicate will run true to form this time -PRON- big knockover 
the payoff -PRON- have tell mortimer doran 
no one no one but -PRON- 
-PRON- wonot have any leak this time 
but the government may vee grin one thing about the federal governmentthey donot have leak 
i be assure of that but i didnot need to be 
-PRON- see dean -PRON- be as much interested in this case as i be 
-PRON- frown the one thing i didnot like didnot like at all really a oneman job 
and with a nod when i would have cut in twoman job for want -PRON- of course no good without an audience dean 
but -PRON- insist on have an operator with -PRON- 
there be nothing to do about that meet -PRON- and -PRON- wouldnot ask for a well man glance at the clock 
almost one -PRON- say and -PRON- havenot hear from pal 
and the phone rang 
there -PRON- be 
no coincidence eh 
-PRON- lift the phone and i see -PRON- face change 
-PRON- say yes then yes again in a low voice 
i lean forward listen 
-PRON- be the same rough voice disguise very unnaturalthe head of the murder syndicate 
so there -PRON- have the picture mr brown 
the little lady have disappear 
but donot worry about -PRON- yet 
really i havenot time to bother with -PRON- nowbut i will after tomorrow night afraid -PRON- didnot exercise any too good judgment as to -PRON- company 
melrose -PRON- know be not overcareful about -PRON- friend 
-PRON- may have introduce -PRON- to a most undesirable acquaintance 
be -PRON- alivenow voice be hollow 
oh yes quite alive 
disturb perhaps mentally for -PRON- must guess what -PRON- curiosity andassociation with -PRON- have bring -PRON- 
but indeed alive not simply go to kill -PRON- 
-PRON- will be interesting 
i have never experiment with woman 
i wonder if -PRON- take -PRON- as wellor should i say as badlyas man 
what do -PRON- say 
and when brown do not answer yes i be go to nail -PRON- up conscious and shriek for -PRON- to find 
-PRON- kill -PRON- man spoil -PRON- plan almost ruin everythinginclude -PRON- reputation for protect those who aid -PRON- 
now -PRON- have bring -PRON- out into the open make -PRON- work alone 
if that s what -PRON- wanthow do -PRON- like -PRON- make -PRON- a promiseye a promise 
-PRON- will be the first to see -PRON- body nail there like the other 
brown didnot speak 
i guess -PRON- couldnot 
and by the way have a policehunt if -PRON- do i will know and act at once go up first 
-PRON- intend to go through with the other tomorrow night 
a voice speak close to -PRON- ear i know -PRON- be for i see -PRON- lip move 
but -PRON- didnot sound like -PRON- voice not a bit like -PRON- have i ever disappoint -PRON- client 
-PRON- lose -PRON- thousand of dollar mr brown 
this time i will get million 
first -PRON- prominent man then -PRON- famous actress a little ashamed of -PRON- mr brown 
i pride -PRON- on be a businessman 
yet this -PRON- all have -PRON- weakness 
a bit childish eh 
just hate of -PRON- perhaps 
though i set -PRON- up as a syndicate afraid i be human after all 
and brown break loose 
human 
-PRON- curse and threaten 
just a beast there be a false sort of laugh over the wire 
and i think -PRON- be a cool calculating killer 
-PRON- hardly believe -PRON- with such conceit as yoursbut i think -PRON- be in love with the girl 
dime detective magazii and suddenly if -PRON- make one move out of -PRON- house one move on the public street put -PRON- up at once 
there be the click of the receiver and vee drop into a chair 
-PRON- be on -PRON- foot almost at once though call apartment speak to the maid

-PRON- tell the girl not to worry about -PRON- that shed be away for a day or so 
by god someone must have hold a gun to -PRON- head

and -PRON- wasnot the maid call the police that -PRON- fear but someone from outside call pal and the maid say -PRON- didnot know where -PRON- be 
-PRON- grab -PRON- arm look wildly at -PRON-

there be to be an add attraction to tonight little performance 
besides allison brackenbridge -PRON- be also add the famous actress gertrude la palatin to -PRON- list the usual courtesy show the gentle sex will be miss on this occasion

there be no one there but the squeakyvoice blonde and -PRON- eminent banker a setup a oneman job 
by god dean -PRON- could murder both of -PRON- and take -PRON- time about -PRON- 
i donot think -PRON- even think the secretary be on 
-PRON- shoulder move as -PRON- look up at a house and -PRON- duck quickly into an alley 
-PRON- canot afford to be see by the people in the house behind and have the police on -PRON- brown say as -PRON- seek a particularly dark corner and climb the fence drop to the stone yard of the place -PRON- seek 
vee i ask -PRON- what do brackenbridge say girl 
-PRON- let -PRON- in 
be -PRON- willing to help the police by wait and not so fast dean 
in the first place -PRON- werenot let in 
-PRON- come by a cellar window 
-PRON- chuckle slightly 
-PRON- have be feel and act -PRON- once more ever since the letter with the news pal be alive 
-PRON- enter at a most embarrassing moment for mr brackenbridge 
a most compromising situation to put -PRON- mildly 
damn -PRON- 
dean -PRON- think -PRON- be detective look for divorce evidence and try to buy usoff 
-PRON- be almost relieved when -PRON- find -PRON- only want to prevent -PRON- murder 
would -PRON- help 
red friday -PRON- will 
i could see head nod as -PRON- reach the back door 
when -PRON- get think and recall what -PRON- have hear about this killer -PRON- agree 
-PRON- enthusiasm be not great admit 
but -PRON- can have a look at -PRON- -PRON- set the stage 
brown lock the back door carefully behind -PRON- 
-PRON- pass through the kitchen pantry dining room and so to the living roomand allison brackenbridge 
-PRON- be a banker 
-PRON- couldnot have be more of a banker if -PRON- have be make up to play the part 
cold steady eye an extra chin slightly bald and skin as pink and white as a babys 
and the blond doll 
-PRON- be just thata blond doll 
-PRON- keep powder -PRON- face fix -PRON- lip and mutter -PRON- god this be terrible 
but -PRON- cast furtive question speculative blue eye at the banker 
-PRON- be wonderingwa this the end of the sugar 
should -PRON- make a scene blame -PRON- put on an act 
but -PRON- wasnot sure wasnot go to make any mistake and keep to the safety of -PRON- god 
this be terrible say mr brackenbridge be begin to weaken 
i hope -PRON- doesnot mess thing up 
for -PRON- own sake i hope -PRON- doesnot 
brown be very grave 
certainly -PRON- would spread -PRON- name all over the paper have to stick -PRON- out anyway and if -PRON- wonot play -PRON- game then and turn to the banker -PRON- know the paper mr brackenbridge 
murder monster trap in love nest 
allison brackenbridge stop -PRON- 
stop -PRON- 
brackenbridge toy with the thick black ribbon that drop down from -PRON- glass 
how will -PRON- action prevent such a scandal 
for one thing say brown willing to go to bat for -PRON- 
-PRON- receive threat from the murder syndicate 
but i never get so much as a line have no idea of such a thing know 
but this be -PRON- story now 
-PRON- didnot wish to alarm -PRON- family so say nothing to -PRON- but come straight to -PRON- 
-PRON- have be act under -PRON- advice ever since 
-PRON- say collin rent this place 
very well the paper canot do much about that already use the phone and try to get collin the butler know that 
-PRON- be rather important 
then collin call -PRON- at -PRON- club at least -PRON- think -PRON- be collin 
-PRON- have to see -PRON- at once -PRON- seem excited 
-PRON- come here to -PRON- house meet -PRON- here beforething to do with the banktime -PRON- must not be disturb 
and there -PRON- be 
a gun in -PRON- back a wave of -PRON- hand toward halley and rescue squad 
but -PRON- doesnot sound convincing 
the paper collin be not important to the paper and the paper wonot take a chance on a libel suit 
yes the girl cut in 
what about memy reputation 
-PRON- say brown will leave immediately after thethe end of the murder syndicate 
-PRON- wonot be question wonot even be in -PRON- see to that 
and after thatwhat 
-PRON- half jerk -PRON- head toward the banker 
after smile at imagine a penthouse over on park avenue sure -PRON- more sensibleand safe 
there be no reason why thing should change between -PRON- and mr brackenbridge 
of course hell be rather pleased and thankful that -PRON- be help too help -PRON- as well as the police 
i daresay -PRON- reward will be more than generous 
-PRON- be say what a little wonder -PRON- be 
oh ally 
the girl walk over dime detective magazine curl an arm around the banker neck 
-PRON- didnot meannot the ring i look atnot the one from of course do -PRON- for -PRON- 
yes yes 
allison brackenbridge stretch up -PRON- hand and pat the back of -PRON- as if -PRON- be tap a desk at a board meeting be think something like that 
but the house should be surround by police the man could be arrest before -PRON- even get up the step 
-PRON- go over all that 
brown shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- want to be certain 
besides with the place surroundedso many man man who may talk to the paper about -PRON- and miss vaugne 
but i bring in mr condon 
good shoot in the city 
maybe i redden i donot know 
brown always kid -PRON- about -PRON- shooting 
but allison brackenbridge come to -PRON- foot and shake hand with -PRON- 
so that s settle 
brown seem very confident very sure go through -PRON- again then take -PRON- place 
-PRON- canot tell when or how hell come 
and a stage director get ready to shoot -PRON- picture be never more particular than vee 
the stage be set girl and the banker be to stay alone in the large living room both window shade tightly draw 
there be a small door that lead to the main hall fold door with huge heavy drape that lead to the dining room 
these door be open but the curtain tightly draw 
then there be another set of fold door that give onto the front room that overlook the street these also sport two heavy curtain which brown draw tightly 
there -PRON- be 
brown explain the whole situation and seem satisfied 
if the trap be a natural for this murderer -PRON- trap for -PRON- be a natural too 
i donot know how hell come but lock the door of the front room which lead to the hall so -PRON- wonot disturb -PRON- right three will be hide behind the curtain in the front room 
that make mr brackenbridge perfectly safe 
but suppose mr brackenbridge interrupt -PRON- should not come alone 
what then get to come alone 
now mr brackenbridge -PRON- and miss vaugne must spend -PRON- evening as -PRON- would ordinarily spend -PRON- 
since like -PRON- at the table with -PRON- back to the curtain so that the man must face usperhaps -PRON- may be do a little writing 
miss vaugne will sit there by the diningroom curtain and read under the lamp 
halley say -PRON- think a little conversation may be well 
brown hesitate shake -PRON- head 
no 
the murder syndicate wonot know how long -PRON- have be just like that 
-PRON- canot look in the window 
-PRON- see -PRON- may come right to the front door and ring the bell -PRON- may enter by the cellar window as -PRON- do 
-PRON- may even have be here before and have a key make 
yesi know 
light conversation would be better more natural perhaps 
but -PRON- too much to ask of -PRON- 
if -PRON- man listen and hear -PRON- would find the unnatural strained theatrical note in -PRON- and be suspicious 
no i donot think either one of -PRON- could put that over 
brown take one more look about the room 
brackenbridge sit behind the flat desk 
miss vaugne drop rather awkwardly into the chair beneath the lamp and open a book 
all right 
vee nodded 
now well leave -PRON- and watch from behind the curtain 
i look down at -PRON- watch 
-PRON- be exactly twenty minute of ten when -PRON- push the curtain aside and step friday hind -PRON- 
i see both halley and vee reach for -PRON- gun and i see brown grin as i clumsily pull mine from -PRON- pocket 
halley take up a position right in the center where the curtain part 
brown hesitate raise a hand as if to tap halley on the shoulder then change -PRON- mind go to the end nearer the door that lead to the hall 
-PRON- motion to -PRON- to take the other end 
so -PRON- be set three man 
two of -PRON- steady cool use to danger and meet that danger quickly and with the assurance of long experience

once when that curtain sway from -PRON- move foot -PRON- jar up with a start put -PRON- hand to -PRON- mouth sit so on the edge of the chairthen with a queer little giggle fall back in the chair 
brackenbridge didnot speak either 
-PRON- bend over the paper before -PRON- make queer design on -PRON- i think 
but -PRON- eye be ever raise glue -PRON- upon the curtain as if -PRON- would stare right through -PRON- thickness and assure -PRON- that -PRON- be still there 
several time i straighten get sort of stiff

brown snap 
and as brackenbridge open -PRON- mouth as if to speak again or scandal lip go tight 
-PRON- glare at the curtain a moment

-PRON- smile and nod 
-PRON- be as if -PRON- suddenly realize that -PRON- life depend on brown on -PRON- behind the curtain

i play -PRON- along take pal into -PRON- confidence on the promise -PRON- wouldnot squawk to -PRON- and work the snatch 
but why 
i ask 
because -PRON- would trust -PRON- come here for -PRON- 
and put the finger on -PRON- 
-PRON- would have work too i guess 
yes tonight -PRON- ring -PRON- up tell -PRON- to give -PRON- the work leave the body in the apartment and -PRON- would take care of -PRON- later 
fitzpatrick nod grimly have be here when -PRON- come 
brown grin shove out -PRON- hand 
maybe -PRON- just as well johnny that i didnot shoot -PRON- to death 
but there s no reward for -PRON- plan to send that money to wife in illinois 
-PRON- lip ourve into that little crooked smile buy -PRON- a well husband 
-PRON- stop start to hum look at pal a song there kida real one 
-PRON- go like buy -PRON- a well husband purchase another man chuck evan and joe gett be just a couple of smart guystwo of a kindwho happen to get catch up in the same brain storm 
but when the shooting and shouting die -PRON- didnot take either one long to see that smarty vs smarty can end in a draw as well as a win and blast hell out of anybodys by carl clausen -PRON- look up as the door creak and reach for -PRON- gun be smoke -PRON- aftersupper cigarette by the gas log and look at flossie -PRON- wife through a hole in the newspaper which -PRON- be ostensibly read 
-PRON- have fall into the habit of observe -PRON- surreptitiously of late in a detached sort of fashion as if -PRON- be a specimen present to -PRON- for classification 
once upon a time mr evan have love -PRON- in the possessive way in which man cherish thing hard win 
like -PRON- other dime detective magazine a fitting answer rise to -PRON- lip but extralegal activity -PRON- represent a definite quantity of effort -PRON- have take -PRON- from another by the right of conquest 
the other man be joe gett 
chuck scrutinize flossie through the hole the paper 
-PRON- be mend a run in a silk stocking by the light of the bridge lamp 
-PRON- lip be too red -PRON- hair too platinum 
these be the obvious detail 
-PRON- evoke no thought of censure 
chuck like -PRON- woman vivid 
what irk -PRON- be the knowledge that the sudden tender curve of -PRON- lip as -PRON- bend forward at -PRON- task be for -PRON- 
mr evan be not give to selfanalysis so -PRON- merely wonder what a goodlooke broad like flossie could see in a gorilla like joe gett and -PRON- smile mysteriously behind the newspaper as -PRON- toy with the idea of what -PRON- mean to do to that simian this night presently -PRON- lay the paper down and glance at -PRON- wristwatch 
guess ftt be go over to the -PRON- say 
-PRON- have make this remark threesometime four and occasionally fivenight a week for the past year hut tonight -PRON- inject an extra note of casualness in the statement 
the be a poolroom where man of -PRON- kind congreg eat and discuss way and mean 
the four fleabitten pool table be an excuse to permit the police to collect the license fee 
in the rear room one could buy anything from a hypodermic needle to a gat 
wish -PRON- would go up to the storage and get -PRON- fur coat flossie say without raise -PRON- eye from the stocking glaced and all ready 
the paper say -PRON- go to be cold tomorrow 
-PRON- mean that joint way up on amsterdam and -PRON- demand 
all right never mind -PRON- retort 
there be once -PRON- would have run -PRON- ragged for -PRON- a thought flash into a secret and hidden chamber of -PRON- tortuous mind -PRON- keep -PRON- peace 
-PRON- consult -PRON- watch again and compare -PRON- with the clock on the mantel 
unknown to flossie -PRON- have set both ahead half an hourfor purpose of -PRON- own 
why donot -PRON- phone -PRON- and tell -PRON- to deliver -PRON- -PRON- ask 
because tonight saturday night 
-PRON- wonot make delivery after eight but -PRON- be open till midnight 
all right -PRON- grumble get -PRON- go down on die automatic elevator chuck evan smile to -PRON- 
amsterdam and be way uptown far from where -PRON- mean to be early in the evening 
-PRON- would provide -PRON- with an additional link in the cleverly construct chain which be to be -PRON- alibi for die evening 
mr evan never depend upon friend for -PRON- alibis 
-PRON- be essentially the lone wolf type and never deliver -PRON- into the hand of another friend or enemy 
-PRON- alibi be a more subtle one 
the man -PRON- intend actually to rub out be not joe gett but anotherone manuel cortez 
the setup be as follow mr gett have recently essay to terminate the existence of mr cortez by spray -PRON- with lead from a cruising cabriolet but the body of mr cortez own hack have be reinf arc with bulletproof steel for just such an eventuality so manuel have merely take to -PRON- bed with a slight wound in the thigh 
both mr gett and mr cortez have swear to get mr cortez and mr gett as soon as the former be able to be about again and the florist ajacent to columbus circle be place tentative order with jersey nursery in anticipation of the event 
automatic alibi per se 
chuck evan have nothing against manuel cortez beyond the fact that -PRON- do not belong to that branch of the human race know as nordic of which mr evan -PRON- be a conspicuous member 
mr cortez have merely single -PRON- out for -PRON- special attention by be an enemy of mr gett and get -PRON- in the way of joe getts slug 
-PRON- be a situation for which mr evan have wait in -PRON- patient way ever since -PRON- have verify -PRON- suspicion of flossie and joe 
technically there be no reason why chuck evan and joe gett should be on the out 
each control -PRON- own definite racket and neither have be know to encroach on the other 
ostensibly -PRON- be the good of friend 
-PRON- have even be know now and then to join force in discreet warehouse robberie when -PRON- respective supply run short 
once or twice -PRON- have appear in court with as plausible alibis for each other as the legal machinery require 
to the world chuck evan and joe gett be just a couple of guy try to get along in adjoin neighborhood by observe the rule of the game 
all this make excellent stagesetting for what mr evan mean to do which be simply to call on manuel cortez after dark and finish what mr gett have begin 
the police of course would not suspect -PRON- of so fall a purpose since there seem no reason on earth why -PRON- should shoot mr cortez 
and with -PRON- customary attention to detail mr evan have lay out the evening activity 
emerge from the apartment house in which -PRON- live -PRON- go directly to the -PRON- find present there among other joe gett in person as -PRON- have know -PRON- would 
as -PRON- be the unwritten rule at the to check one gun at the counter before gain admission to the room at the rear 
mr evan surrender -PRON- automatic pistol and lay -PRON- on the shelf behind the cash register in the small compartment which carry -PRON- name 
next to -PRON- in a compartment similarly mark lie mr getts 
both pistol be standard type of the most recent and popular make thirtyeight caliber and except for -PRON- maker number alike as a pair of identical twin 
but mr evan know that to an expert on ballistic the projectile that issue from -PRON- be under a powerful magnifying glass as different as be a pea from a pearl 
therefore when mr evan deposit -PRON- gun on the shelf -PRON- lay -PRON- in mr gett compartment and place where -PRON- own should have be 
-PRON- be one of those little for which mr evan be justly famous 
in the back room immediately thereafter card be produce 
chuck play stud with mr gett and a satellite win in the course of time fortytwo dollar be restless 
after an hour play -PRON- arise intimate that the game be too slow for -PRON- and that -PRON- have business elsewhere 
chuck do not inquire where for -PRON- know very well where joe be go 
-PRON- have even arrange that mr gett should be there 
joe gett go to the shelf behind the cash register to get -PRON- gun 
-PRON- be about to do what mr evan have doneswitch weaponswhen in pick up -PRON- own from from mr evan compartment -PRON- note by a slight scratch on the butt of -PRON- that -PRON- have already be do for -PRON- 
-PRON- glance over -PRON- shoulder at the dutchman but that worthy be deeply immersed in a copy of candid confession 
-PRON- also wink at -PRON- own image in the flyspecked mirror over the head as -PRON- replace the pistol where -PRON- dime detective magazine have fotmd -PRON- and jack tip the one mr evan have intend -PRON- should 
as -PRON- go out -PRON- hum a gay little tune from a gay little movie 
immediately -PRON- set about throw a monkey wrench into mr evans elaborate machinery 
chuck -PRON- leave the almost at once 
in the holster under -PRON- left armjnt be pistol 
with -PRON- customary caution -PRON- have check on that little matter with the maker number 
-PRON- too be in a pleasant jocular mood 
saunter down the street to the local cinema house -PRON- engage the brunette cashier in conversation to impress -PRON- presence on -PRON- mind 
after chat pleasantly with -PRON- for some moment mr evan buy a ticket go within and drop into a seat near one of the fire exit 
-PRON- have already see the picture at matinee that afternoon 
now -PRON- stay just long enough to assure -PRON- that the program have not be change in any essential detail so that -PRON- would be able to discourse upon -PRON- intelligently should such be necessary 
then watch -PRON- chance -PRON- step across the aisle when the usher head be turn and depart quietly leave a very small piece of wood in the crack of the doornot thick enough to cause a draft but sufficient to keep the latch from catch and lock the door 
the exit open on an alley and this in turn lead into a side street once in this street mr evan work fast 
dive into the near subway -PRON- board an express train and ride downtown 
the place where -PRON- get off have be sing in jwetry and prose a shocking place where yellow man -PRON- say do unspeakable thing in unspeakable way 
where the elevated roar along a street that have be in turn a quiet lover lane a stately turnpike an artery of commerce a cruising ground of sailor on furlough and courtesan on high heel and the theme of a ribald song 
-PRON- be now but a sad place of rescue mission with no one to rescue pawnshop when there be little to pawn secondhand store cheap coffee house and cheap cinema 
why manuel cortez choose to live in tin neighborhood have always be a mystery to chuck 
-PRON- be make plenty of money 
-PRON- fastidious to the point of felinity -PRON- shudder at the odor that assail -PRON- 
-PRON- come to this region rarely and then only to confer with one maurice klopfel a pawnbroker about the marketing of such trinket as come -PRON- way in the routine of business 
pass mr place of business now in the shadow of the opposite side of the street -PRON- glance hurriedly through the grimy window 
mr klopfel be not in sight and the door lead into the little room at the rear be dose a sure sign that -PRON- be in conference 
that the conferee be joe gett mr evan have not a doubtfor -PRON- himsdf have see to -PRON- that mr gett get a telephone message from 
mr klopfel anent a certain trifle in the way of diamond set in platinum which could be have for the proverbial song 
mr gett hobby be bauble at cantata price 
-PRON- distribute -PRON- among -PRON- feminine friend at random and not always wisely 
mr evan have not the slight doubt that the trifle in question a bracelet be destinedin mr gett imaginationto adorn the slender wrist of -PRON- flossie after -PRON- -PRON- have be somewhere inter could of course have shoot mr gett forthwith but aside from the risk of arrest and conviction there be other reason why this be inexpedient 
mr gett be popular with -PRON- mob also -PRON- be a power in politic in -PRON- neighborhood as mr evan be in -PRON- 
automatic alibi in these day of investigation and tammany disfavor one have to forget personal desire and work for the common good 
the home of manuel cortez be a threestory walkup 
in -PRON- palmy day when the bouwerie be in the stately turnpike stage -PRON- have be the abode of gentry 
on the left brownstonebuttress of the stoop recline a headless nubian lion on the right what be leave of -PRON- twin 
mr evan reconnoiter for a moment to assure -PRON- that the coast be clear 
then -PRON- walk softly through the alley insert a jimmy under the sash of the rear window and presently find -PRON- in a kitchen smell strongly of garlic fry olive oil and wine 
the combination make mr evan slightly nauseate 
-PRON- pause dizzily draw out -PRON- flashlight and make -PRON- way upstairs guide by an overlying motif of iodoform 
the odor lead -PRON- straight to mr cortez sick room 
that gentle latin be sit up in bed read little caesar by the light of a shaded bridge lamp and chew bettelnut -PRON- look up as the door creak and reach for -PRON- gun but -PRON- be too slow 
two spurt of flame stab the semidarkness of the room and -PRON- shuffle off -PRON- coil with the gentle little shiver 
mr evan leave forthwith 
as -PRON- depart by the kitchen window -PRON- drop joe getts pistol in a bed of chrysanthemum that by some miracle grow under -PRON- 
to have leave the weapon in the room with the remain of mr cortez would have be too crude 
among the flower -PRON- would appear that the assassin have lose -PRON- by accident 
as -PRON- walk quickly to the near subway entrance -PRON- draw off the old pair of glove -PRON- have be wear for the occasion and throw -PRON- into the gutter 
there would be no fingerprint on the gun except when -PRON- get back to the cinema house -PRON- pause peer through the crack of the door of the fire exit until the usher be elsewhere 
then -PRON- slip within and slide into the near vacant seat 
the whole thing have take less than threequarter of an hour 
-PRON- see the program to the end chat with the brunette cashier on -PRON- way out then take the west side subway to the fur store in amsterdam avenue near street

the door as -PRON- expect be firmly lock 
oakley turn to the window 
each be crisscross by heavy iron bar set into massive frame 
the blind be draw 
oakley be half around the building when -PRON- pause at another door 
the lock on the first entrance have be of a formidable flatkey variety recently add but this be an ordinary type slender steel pick probe into -PRON- and slide bade the bolt 
with brixey at -PRON- side -PRON- step into darkness tinge with a faint animal odor 
-PRON- flash -PRON- pocket light through several door and see chair and blackboard 
these be classroom and of no interest to oakley 
at the end of the corridor -PRON- find a lock door 
again a tumbler mechanism defy -PRON- 
the lab be protect like a vault 
nevertheless -PRON- try -PRON- pick 
-PRON- be squeak in the lock when brixey say suspiciously smell smoke 
oakley straighten 
so do somewhere outside a cry sound 
the second time -PRON- be oakley begin to move quickly 
long stride carry -PRON- along the corridor as -PRON- thrust open swinging door 
-PRON- stop short with red light glare in -PRON- face 
-PRON- be look into a classroom which -PRON- have pass by on -PRON- way to the inner entrance of the research laboratory

oakley slip past the corner 
-PRON- be in -PRON- car and start up when brixey fold down beside -PRON- 
the tire ground in the gravel as the roadster swerve toward the distant gate hope oakley observe as -PRON- twist into a boulevard that none of the student sight -PRON- and start trail -PRON- put that fire out in a jiffy 
the only damage do be a postponement of -PRON- burglarious activity come back archie

-PRON- death will leave sandwell without income hence -PRON- anxiety

strong financial reason oakley murmur for want -PRON- daughter to remain safe and prosperous 
-PRON- turn to the next report dope on on both corpse identical 
hand and foot of anderson and brook severely freeze 
this in -PRON- balmy climate in each a large vein in the thigh have be open apparently after death for very little blood flow 
in each a needle puncture unusually large over heart pierce to right auricle but this be not cause of death 
in each case blow on head sufficiently violent to cause unconsciousness but not death 
carbon dioxide content of lung very high death due to suffocation 
since the thigh vein be open after death suffocation could not have take place inside the trunk unless the man be put into trunk suffocate remove operate upon then return to trunk 
this be unlikely since in that case man must have be bring to lee home alive then kill and operation perform there 
indication be that both man be murder in some strange fashion elsewhere then bring to lee home and put into trunk 
both death occur night of 10th exact time uncertain 
archie ask oakley of -PRON- assistant see if -PRON- can get any response from doctor biological laboratory at st vincent college 
brixey take up the telephone as oakley unfold yet another report 
death an delivery dope on be in store room of lee home 
servant can not say when -PRON- be bring out hut think -PRON- be follow dinner on the 10th 
property of norman brenner 
at on the 10th the coastwise trucking company of los angele receive a telephone call from a man who say -PRON- be dr norman brenner address that of lee home 
-PRON- wish a truck to come and pick up two trunk 
one be to be drive to national express company depot in santa barbara 
the other be to -PRON- take to freight depot in hollywood and ship collect to san francisco 
the expressman call at the lee home next morning 
-PRON- pick up the trunk which be to go to santa barbara 
-PRON- stay local express office until truck leave on regtdar run that night 
trunk never reach santa 
barbara because of accident on roosevelt highway 
-PRON- be doubtless the murderer intention to go to santa barbara and ship the trunk out of there to confuse trace -PRON- 
accident upset this plan 
the other trunk to be take to hollywood freight office be not pick up by the express truck 
reason the trunk be not crate 
trunk may be ship as be by express but be not accept for freight shipment unless crate 
killer evidently do not know of this regulation 
result trunk contain dead body of vernon brook be leave at the lee home 
brixey put down the telephone 
no answer from the lab -PRON- assert 
that probably mean the fire be put out and nobody go into the lab oakley assert and take up the report on doctor brenner 
no information available concern dr experiment 
-PRON- work have be finance with fund donate by the college mid by the reason for secrecy not explain 
brenner have indicate -PRON- intention of go away for a few day rest but tell no one where -PRON- be go or when 
accord to servant at lee house leave in -PRON- own car late on evening of 10th about nothing about -PRON- in newspaper 
police be search for -PRON- quietly no public alarm issue flight and continued absence say brixey would seem to indicate guilt 
-PRON- must not forget oakley remind -PRON- that -PRON- have two purpose in this case 
one be to locate faith lee 
the other be to save claire kent from ruinous scandal the outer office come a commoidon

so -PRON- s hire -PRON- have -PRON- demand 
-PRON- chauffeur get kill in a cockeyed way and -PRON- doesnot know anything about itso why do -PRON- need a private detective 
to save -PRON- from be trample on by a rhino name oakley answer no reason for drag -PRON- into the case and ruin -PRON- career and go to see that -PRON- let -PRON- alone -PRON- answer if -PRON- can grasp -PRON- heave close

if anderson didnot drive that car back himselfwho do tell -PRON- 
somebody who know what happen to -PRON- 
somebody who s hold out and try to slide from under 
somebody who s mix right into the middle of these killing and try to play oakley spring to -PRON- foot -PRON- snap get the hell out of here before i bounce -PRON- out blink go all right -PRON- rumble 
when i see -PRON- again oakley have a warrant for -PRON-

presently -PRON- be send the car up a steep winding road 
at the end of an hour -PRON- approach a neat little town sit at the edge of a sparkle mountain -PRON- draw into a parking space before an impressive stucco hotel at the edge of the water 
with cherry morris at -PRON- side -PRON- stride into the lobby and of the desk clerk -PRON- inquire this la hacienda

-PRON- never the clerk begin to protest but the crisp crinkle of a twentydollar bill in -PRON- hand change -PRON- frown to an obliging smile 
oakley step behind the desk look rapidly through an index of registration card 
-PRON- lift one from the read the name of doctor norman brenner and say ah the blue timestamp on the card -PRON- study closely 
doctor brenner -PRON- ask arrive here at about twelve thirty on the night of the tenth

be -PRON- in or out at the moment 
in go up oakley declare unannounced 
-PRON- go up to the sixth floor 
oakley knock at a door the number of which correspond with that record on the registration card 
-PRON- be open by a middleaged man with a tired face and rumple hair 
-PRON- be clothe in a blue bathrobe and red slipper and regard -PRON- curiously 
doctor norman brenner yes 
-PRON- be come in say oakley 
-PRON- enter the room of the man for whom the los angele police be search at that very moment 
oakley bolt the door 
doctor norman brenner look amazed then indignant then trouble 
what do -PRON- want 
information oakley say crisply a private detective be wise to answer -PRON- question 
need i add that the case involve murder and -PRON- be suspect 
what nonsense be this 
brenner exclaim gesture to cherry who sit down cross exquisite leg and poise a needlepointed pencil above -PRON- stenographer notebook 
oakley signal brenner to a chair lean dose and proffer the small slip of paper on which the name and location of the hotel be write 
ever see that before 
yes -PRON- writing pencil make hieroglyph in -PRON- notebook as the word be uttered 
-PRON- give that slip to faith lee 
yes 
look here 
why the devil be -PRON- ask question 
oakley snap 
answer -PRON- 
-PRON- be on what be commonly call a spot 
doctor brenner 
very shortly a bull name be go to grab -PRON- and -PRON- will find -PRON- an unpleasant experience 
if -PRON- want a square deal talk nowtell -PRON- where i can find faith lee and why -PRON- kill two man name brook and anderson 
brenner swallow 
why i donot know what -PRON- be talk about 
surely oakley press -PRON- read the paper 
-PRON- know of the death of anderson and both body be find in trunk bear -PRON- initial 
-PRON- trunk 
-PRON- mean miss chauffeur and director 
newspaper 
i havenot look at one since i come up here 
oakley sit back 
this -PRON- opine be go to be difficult for -PRON- as well as for -PRON- 
i tell -PRON- frankly get to turn up a murderer in a hurry in order to save -PRON- from the very unpleasant legal consequence of a rash act go to do -PRON- no matter who get the chair go to talk dime detective magazine talk startle -PRON- so that i can hardly think doctor brenner exclaim in dismay 
the less thinking and the more remembering -PRON- do the well 
oakley snap 
now answer -PRON- question 
what time do -PRON- leave -PRON- home on the night of the tenth not sure of the exact time 
i finish work at the lab drive home have dinner go to -PRON- room and lie down 
i be very tired and unintentionally fall asleep 
when i awake i pack and leave 
when 
-PRON- be past ten 
what -PRON- be say oakley state be that -PRON- be asleep at the time the murder be evidently commit 
that i must point out be no alibi at the truth -PRON- drive straight here 
certainly 
-PRON- take an uncommonly long time about -PRON- a very slow and cautious driver 
an ordinary driver would have reach here in half the time -PRON- take 
perhaps but i come directly 
-PRON- give that slip with the address of this hotel on -PRON- to faith lee before -PRON- leave 
yes late that afternoon 
why 
so -PRON- could get in touch with -PRON- if necessary 
where be -PRON- when -PRON- leave the house 
in -PRON- bedroom i suppose 
-PRON- suppose speak through the door to say goodbye but there be no answer and i assume -PRON- be sleep 
-PRON- didnot telephone an express company 
-PRON- didnot go to -PRON- laboratory on the campus of st vincent college after -PRON- leave the house 
no say firmly doctor bren ner force to the conclusion that either -PRON- be entirely innocent of what happen or -PRON- be lie with amazing facility tell the truth 
-PRON- would say so in any case oakley go on relentlessly 
the big point be this 
the man who commit these murder be see leave miss house after dark on the night of the tenth carrying miss lee apparently unconscious in -PRON- arm 
-PRON- drive directly to -PRON- biological laboratory and go impossible 
doctor brenner blurt the only person who have key to that laboratory 
there be no other in existence 
none 
i always carry -PRON- in -PRON- vest pocket 
here -PRON- be 
-PRON- lift two flat key from -PRON- vest pocket each a duplicate of the other 
oakley take -PRON- 
these key be on -PRON- person when -PRON- lay down after dinner 
yes 
-PRON- be still there when -PRON- awoke 
yes 
oakley sigh shouldnot like to face if i be -PRON- with a story as weak as that 
now listen 
i want to know the exact nature of -PRON- secret experiment in the biological laboratory 
-PRON- experiment say doctor norman brenner be devoted to restore the dead to life 
oakley sit up 
cherry morris pencil pause 
-PRON- glance at each other as though doubt the man sanity 
doctor brenner merely look at -PRON- 
-PRON- mean to tell -PRON- oakley ask death on delivery -PRON- that a conservative college and the have advanced fund to -PRON- for experiment in resurrect the dead do 
doctor eye light 
-PRON- may sound fantastic to -PRON- 
as a matter of fact there be nothing startling about -PRON- 
i have succeed several time in restore dead body to life 
human 
oakley blurt 
no 
in -PRON- experiment i have use dog cat and rabbit 
oakley take a breath and say please explain 
certainly 
i be not the only man work on these experiment 
-PRON- may have read of those conduct by doctor robert cornish who be once a member of the staff of the university of institute of experimental biology 
-PRON- be conduct -PRON- experiment until recently in a building on the university campus 
the publicity give -PRON- work lead to -PRON- being ask to remove -PRON- 
i have maintain strict secrecy about -PRON- own work in order to proceed unmolested 
hmmmf doctor cornish and i both use teeterboard for simulate the circulation of blood once the dead heart begin function again 
a solutionsaturate with oxygen contain the heart stimulant adrenalin and the liver extract heparin and some blood from which the coagulate substance fibrin have be remove be introduce into the circulatory system through the thigh vein the thigh vein 
oakley repeat 
yes 
circulation be then restore by rock the dead body on the teeterboard massage -PRON- and blow into the mouth to stimulate respiration 
-PRON- experiment doctor brenner continue be base on groundwork do by doctor george washington crile of cleveland thirty year ago and also on experiment conduct at the mayo clinic in twentynine 
doctor albert solomon hyman of the witkin foundation for the study and prevention of heart disease in manhattan develop another method which i adoptedthat of prod the dead heart into action by electric impulse 
in this case a resuscitation apparatus call a hymanotor be use 
a hollow goldplate needle be thrust into the right auricle of the heart oakley swallow 
what 
and through the bore of the needle an insulate electric wire be insert to complete the circuit 
a generator supply the current and in six case out of ten the heart action start again if -PRON- have not be suspend for more than twelve minute ask pointedly and this method have never be use on human 
doctor cornish say brenner try last year to revive a man who be dead five hour of heart diseaseuse oxygen and the teeterboard but no injection and fail 
i determine not to attempt to resurrect human until the technique of bring low animal back to life be perfect for an excellent reason which be 
when blood stop flow through the brain for even a short time a chemical change take place in the brain cell 
the animal i revive be live in a coma as a result of this action 
month or year may pass before the mental facility be completely restore to normal 
a human revive after an hour of death may live an idiot or go mad or exist in a coma 
until that difficulty can be overcome in some way -PRON- have no associate in -PRON- experminent have have several none now explain the technique to a number of dime detective magazine person swear -PRON- to secrecy about the work 
i have personally of course conduct every experiment in the laboratory and have take care that no one else ever touch -PRON- apparatus 
-PRON- have oakley insist never attempt to resurrect a dead human 
never 
yet naturally i do not intend to devote -PRON- life to resurrect dead mongrel 
-PRON- great aim be to be enable to bring life back to man and woman who have die of hemorrhage shock asphyxiation and heart paralysis 
then the scientist eye gleam brilliantly then i will have achieve one of the most astounding miracle of modem science oakley study the intense gleam in the doctor eyesand shiver 
one more question 
doctor brenner 
do -PRON- kill anderson and brook 
certainly not very well then 
do -PRON- attempt to restore -PRON- to life after -PRON- have be kill 
no 
oakley sigh and signal cherry morris to transcribe no more of the conversation 
listen to -PRON- doctor brenner 
i want -PRON- to stay herehere in this room from now on go out telephone 
have -PRON- meal bring up 
watch -PRON- 
and in case -PRON- be find here by the policeyou havenot see -PRON- 
understand that 
yes but all 
oakley strode out thrust into -PRON- pocket the key of doctor laboratory 
trunk number three stop -PRON- roadster near the biological research laboratory on the campus of st vincent college 
cherry accompany -PRON- to the big door 
the pungent smell of charred wood be in the air but no one be about 
after a precautionary moment of listen oakley slide a key into the lock 
white light splash upon -PRON- as another car draw up behind the roadster 
the long brixey unfold from -PRON- and walk with another man across gritting gravel 
that -PRON- oke 
i start as soon as -PRON- phone get mr sandwell and here -PRON- be 
sidney sandwell ask anxiously have -PRON- no word from faith 
none unfortunately oakley answer turn the key want -PRON- here because this be the first real lead -PRON- have find point to what may have happen to -PRON- 
brixey gasp where what 
oakley step in and thumb a light switch 
gleam bulb glare down upon strange apparatus 
-PRON- note the teeterboard mention by doctor brenner bent glass tube support by clamp on standard electrical meter a handbellow attach to a cupshape rubber inhalator like a small gasmask 
observe oakley invite the device use to bring the dead back to life 
-PRON- continue tour of the laboratory bring -PRON- to a huge white enameled case in one comer 
-PRON- open one door and feel stinging cold flow outcold that bit to the very bone of the hand -PRON- insert into the interior 
in rack testtube inside rest culture of bacilli and jar contain animal tissue in alcohol 
-PRON- eye glint as -PRON- shut the queer refrigerator and go on 
a door on the opposite side of the laboratory open into a hallway which connect with adjoin room 
oakley lead the procession discover two wire cage contain mongrel who gaze about stupidly as if drunk 
and observe oakley say cadaver death on delivery return to life by the magic of science 
gaze intently at sidney sandwell -PRON- ask have -PRON- ever have reason to doubt -PRON- sanity a most difficult question to answer would -PRON- oakley press consider -PRON- capable of deliberately kill human in order to provide -PRON- with specimen for -PRON- experiment in resurrection good god 
sandwell blurt 
-PRON- canot suspect -PRON- of that 
oakley retort can suspect anyone of anything without half try 
i ask -PRON- that last question because -PRON- seem very likely though not certain that doctor brenner have do exactly that human in order to revive -PRON- eye glitter 
think about -PRON- 
for year doctor brenner have work on these secret experiment 
-PRON- have successfully revive low animal 
-PRON- technique may be advance farther than -PRON- admit 
-PRON- great aim have be to perfect -PRON- so that in certain case human may be revive from death 
for -PRON- most important experiment -PRON- would need human subject would -PRON- not 
corpse oakley continue while brixey stare and cherry morris shudder not too long dead 
dead in fact only a few minute 
obviously such cadaver be rarely available for scientific experiment 
the only solution of the problem of supply be doctor brenner must make -PRON- own corpse 
see the logic of -PRON- 
oakley go on firmly

-PRON- be about ten pace apart and obviously have be plant 
six of these cedar there be no more no less 
dime detective magazine why six 
seven cedar be the name boldly inscribe over the gate 
and i recall that the stationery of -PRON- client captain john temple which bear the message summon -PRON- to this north jersey country estate be likewise engrave seven cedar 
yet the number of cedar be a definite six mind instantly and inevitably inquiredwa the seventh cedar 
after drive through die arch gate and circle the lawn i park in a court to the left of the house 
i be but a minute or so late temple have ask -PRON- to call at six oclock 
at -PRON- knock the door of the house be open by a bald old bullethead who immediately strike -PRON- as an a tough one 
-PRON- thin leatherbrown face be seam and pit 
a scar the full width of -PRON- forehead be deep and frightful 
a batter old customer from somewhere east of arabia i decide probably a hindu fellow back away from -PRON- bow awkwardly with which crablike progress -PRON- lure -PRON- into a gunroom on the right of the hall 
there i find captain temple in the company of a young collegian in creamy flannel 
this young man be pace the floor with such morbid preoccupation that -PRON- do not notice -PRON- entrance

and remember -PRON- be to serve dinner for seven promptly at seven 
rokh back from the room 
as -PRON- eye follow -PRON- i become more and more convinced that the fellow should have be stevedore around singapore rather than butlere in new jersey 
once -PRON- be go temple be all business 
-PRON- look at -PRON- watch snap -PRON- shut with a dick and say a deal to tell -PRON- in less than an hour conroy 
will -PRON- sit down 
-PRON- want legal advice i presume 
i query take a chair 
nothing like that -PRON- say just want -PRON- as a witness to a showdown due during the evening at this house 
naturally i be bewilder showdown on what issue 
an affair of mystery conroy 
and if tag -PRON- rightly the villain of the piece will dine with -PRON- at seven 
and -PRON- role will be 
merely to size -PRON- up temple say 
keep -PRON- eye open and -PRON- reason pliable suppose to have a judicial mind so i want -PRON- reaction -PRON- be get along complain young arkle 
-PRON- jerk fretfully toward -PRON- again plow a hand through -PRON- shock of reddish hair less than an hour -PRON- know 
right 
briefly here the situation conroy 
from now on voice drive like the piston of an engine 
three year ago one septimus cedar a seventh son be honeymoon in the south sea 
-PRON- bride be approach on the dark deck one night by a lascar sailor who whisper to -PRON- a warning 
the lady though startle be incredulous 
-PRON- refuse to believe the terrible crime which the whispering lascar impute to -PRON- husband septimus cedar 
see that -PRON- warning be in vain the lascar beg -PRON- not to speak of -PRON- 
and do -PRON- 
i ask 
-PRON- do not 
otherwise -PRON- would have bring -PRON- husband wrath heavily on the man head 
the seventh cedar just what warning do the lascar whisper i inquire to the bride of septimus cedar 
for the last minute i have be stare thoughtfully out a window regard those evenly space six cedar 
and still ponder on that misnomer over the arched gateway seven cedar 
then i see that -PRON- host and client john temple be pull a bell cord 
in response the bald old bullethead of an east indian come sidle into the room 
rokh temple say to -PRON- the gentleman would like to know just what word of warning -PRON- speak on a dark deck in the south sea to the bride of septimus cedar that -PRON- be rokh who have pass that warning shock -PRON- 
yet i hadnot miss -PRON- pedigree far after all 
instead of a singapore stevedore the man be a lascar sailor 
-PRON- answer bluntly in surprisingly glib english say to lady -PRON- be bis fifth when -PRON- tire of -PRON- -PRON- will push -PRON- into deep pit 
-PRON- be so with the other 
do the lady believe -PRON- prompt temple 
-PRON- do not believe -PRON- master 
what become of -PRON- rokh 
-PRON- maid -PRON- tell -PRON- the lady be downstairs right away master 
that quite stagger -PRON- 
-PRON- mean to say i gasp that let the lady speak for -PRON- temple cut in 
come 
temple lead -PRON- out of the gunroom and across the hall to a spacious library 
-PRON- have be there barely a minute when a slim and pretty woman in -PRON- upper thirty i judge join -PRON- 
-PRON- be a brunette of grace and charm and i like -PRON- at once 
-PRON- be plain that temple do too 
ah here -PRON- be alicia 
-PRON- move quickly almost eagerly to -PRON- and take both -PRON- hand 
in the next short second of time i glimpse a new temple 
-PRON- irongray grimness be for that instant sweep away 
-PRON- be like a courtier ardent greet -PRON- lady love 
yet when -PRON- turn about -PRON- be again -PRON- old stony self 
alicia this be mr conroy -PRON- attorney 
conroy this be miss carterall -PRON- skip the formality and be get along wth -PRON- come impatiently from bud arkle 
and i suddenly realize how nervously impatient -PRON- all be 
i be -PRON- 
most of all be this slim dark lady whose fingertip be now touch -PRON- own 
those finger be icy 
-PRON- poise be too rigid to be natural 
i know that -PRON- be labor under some grave tension 
-PRON- be right 
let -PRON- be get on with -PRON- mr conroy -PRON- say 
know then that although i have choose to assume -PRON- maiden name actually i be the divorce wife of septimus cedar 
that forthrightness help to collect -PRON- wit 
to collect -PRON- further i try to imagine that -PRON- be a witness in court and the interview attorney 
-PRON- be cruise with -PRON- husband some three year ago be -PRON- i ask 
yes -PRON- say 
and do a lascar sailor warn -PRON- as follow -PRON- be -PRON- fifth when -PRON- tire of -PRON- -PRON- will push -PRON- into a deep pit 
-PRON- be so with the other 
yes mr conroy 
temple be place a chair for -PRON- 
-PRON- sit on the edge of -PRON- not at all restfully 
-PRON- be not dressed for a dinner party 
temple in fact have mention that two of the guest would walk directly here from a nearby golf course 
i now ask what of importance follow the incident of the warning miss carterall little while later -PRON- say -PRON- ioe dime detective magazii go ashore on an island 
i be walk with -PRON- husband in the moonlight up a jungle path toward a cliff overlook the sea 
suddenly the dark mouth of a pit loom directly in front of -PRON- 
i feel mr grip tighten on -PRON- arm 
-PRON- face be change 
-PRON- be terrible 
i know that the warning be truethat -PRON- mean to push -PRON- into that pit voice raise as -PRON- say that end in a note of almost wild hysteria 
i could see now the scar of pain in -PRON- eye and faint dark circle beneath -PRON- 
one know at once that a trail of tragedy lie behind -PRON- 
young arkle all this while be stand by fret fume 
since -PRON- be barely more than a callow collegian i couldnot quite see where -PRON- figure 
as for temple -PRON- be stand at elbow like a stocky gibralter -PRON- knotty fist clench 
and so what do -PRON- do i manage to inquire be terrify -PRON- say break away and run into the jungle 
-PRON- come after -PRON- shout 
i run frantically on through the dark 
-PRON- never catch -PRON- 
-PRON- do not thank god 
this answer come fervently from john temple 
temple -PRON- resume the testimony week later -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be pick up by a tramp freighter call in to trade with native at a far end of that same island a small island by the way until recently uncharted somewhere between the fijis and the tongas 
hit the high spot wonot -PRON- beg arkle half past six -PRON- temple say be a supernumerary on the tramp 
alicia have suffer frightful exposure have endure fever be at time delirious 
i make -PRON- -PRON- business to take -PRON- to a hospital in honolulu 
later as -PRON- convalesce there -PRON- tell -PRON- what -PRON- have now tell -PRON- 
and what do -PRON- do set out to find septimus cedar 
a rage storm be hide within the calm with which captain temple speak 
-PRON- go first i suggest to the place -PRON- last see -PRON- 
yes 
and find the pit 
-PRON- be a good hundred foot deep 
anyone push into -PRON- would surely be kill 
but i have -PRON- lower on a rope to -PRON- bottom 
i didnot want to ask the next question 
think of -PRON- make a cold spot form at the base of -PRON- spine 
nothing be there temple offer to -PRON- immeasurable relief 
yet for that there be an obvious reason 
a tunnel of sort lead from the bottom of the pit and break into daylight at the base of a marine cliff 
the tunnel be merely a wavewashed crevice through the faulty rock 
at every high tide the sea surge through -PRON- although at low tide the bottom of the pit be dry 
-PRON- point be clear enough 
a high tide swirl into the pit bottom twice a day would recede tend to suck all light object such as shell and bone with -PRON- 
week and month of such hydraulic action would swab the pit clean 
by what excuse i question do septimus cedar in turn with each of five wife visit the island 
-PRON- have a bamboo bungalow at the place temple say 
-PRON- keep a caretaker there an old clubfoote derelict by the name of hargis 
what become of hargis -PRON- find the body of hargis abe in the bamboo bungalow 
the indication lead -PRON- to believe that -PRON- have die of fever 
and cedar 
be last see in those part by rokh 
captain temple clap -PRON- hand vigorously 
in a moment rokh appear 
hot on the trail of the mystery the seventh cedar temple explain soon find rokh 
-PRON- testimony strike -PRON- as sincere and -PRON- match come ft to mr conroy as briefly as possible have the only seagoe launch at palika rokh say 
-PRON- response come so quickly that -PRON- may have be rehearse 
where i want to know be palika the difference 
bud arkle complain 
if -PRON- must know palika be a village on an island separate by about a tenhour deepwater cruise from bungalow 
get along rokh continue 
four time mr ce1 dar -PRON- charter -PRON- launch to go with very new wife to this very pretty island 
-PRON- have very nice bungalow there 
each time -PRON- get there -PRON- tell -PRON- go back to palika 
-PRON- say maybe -PRON- live there little while with new wife 
always next time i see -PRON- at palika -PRON- have another new wife 
five plenty nice wife -PRON- take to this very pretty island 
naturally -PRON- get suspicious eh rokh 
temple prompt 
so when -PRON- beach -PRON- there with -PRON- fourth bride -PRON- do a bit of spy 
instead of head out to sea on -PRON- return trip to palika -PRON- prowl up through the jungle to see what -PRON- could see 
rokh nod -PRON- bald brown head vigorously 
and what do -PRON- see see mr cedar push wife into pit 
so what do -PRON- do then put to sea for palika 
-PRON- report the murder there 
i ask severely 
when rokh shake -PRON- head temple come quickly to -PRON- rescue no police force at palika -PRON- say 
then -PRON- try to make -PRON- understand that rokh have live too long amongst savage to concern -PRON- with the uxoricide of a nordic 
and what a man do with -PRON- own property a wife by the eastern code be a man property be not vitally business 
-PRON- be however convince that the same fate have befall the other three wife of septimus cedar 
-PRON- know that -PRON- have taxi -PRON- all to the island and never see -PRON- again 
new be i able to find anyone who ever see -PRON- again temple say put in a year at -PRON- 
be -PRON- sure -PRON- ever exist 
i be eye the lascar suspiciously 
quite sure of -PRON- temple say 
many of the palika native see septimus cedar on each of the five occasion when -PRON- embark from there with a wife 
gravely and sympathetically i face alicia carterall cedar 
-PRON- be stare straight ahead -PRON- face pallid from the shock of these recollection 
john temple stand with a brawny hand on -PRON- shoulder 
dinner for seven at seven oclock temple have say 
-PRON- here in the room be only four 
three more therefore be due 
i turn brusquely toward rokh 
so while -PRON- werenot set the law on this man cedar -PRON- do summon up enough human decency to warn -PRON- fifth wife 
later -PRON- escape the clutch of cedar and be rescue by -PRON- present master 
in the meantime after -PRON- vain pursuit of -PRON- wife what do septimus cedar do 
-PRON- bring -PRON- baggage down to the beach and say -PRON- go back to palika 
-PRON- go back to palika 
on the way there -PRON- knock -PRON- overboard with capstan bar and go on alone 
temple nod confirmation 
palika fisherman pick rokh up half drown 
-PRON- launch be find beach just around a headland from palika 
cedar disappear bag and baggage 
-PRON- be never seenuntil alicia and i spot -PRON- not long ago in new york 
-PRON- be live in new york then 
i ask 
dime detective magazine yes 
i hadnot buy this country place then 
in fact i buy -PRON- for the sole reason that the man -PRON- think be septimus cedar live directly across the road leave -PRON- gasping 
yet in one illuminate flash i see strategy 
-PRON- be challenge cedar 
every time the man fare forth from -PRON- house -PRON- must see this onewith -PRON- bold suggestion of a miss seventh cedar have six mature cedar plant by a forester temple explain 
that i think would at least get a rise out of -PRON- 
-PRON- mean that -PRON- deny -PRON- s septimus cedar 
stoutly 
that be i ring up -PRON- house from a pay station and ask for septimus cedar 
this be the house of leonard landren the man -PRON- answer 
no such person as septimus cedar have ever be here 
be -PRON- sure -PRON- the same man 
alicia be sure of -PRON- 
-PRON- hasnot see -PRON- yet but -PRON- s manage to see -PRON- many time 
have be -PRON- wife -PRON- should be competent to identify -PRON- 
what about rokh 
rokh also positively identify landren as cedar temple say 
have -PRON- accuse the man 
i ask 
temple shake -PRON- head 
in court or out of -PRON- -PRON- say -PRON- would simply deny -PRON- be cedar 
then the case against -PRON- would fall flat 
and even if identify i think the case against cedar would be weak 
-PRON- assault on alicia be not commit but merely contemplate 
-PRON- allege murder of the first three wife be not witness 
as to the fourth the only witness be rokh 
rokh would make none too convince a witness 
aside from all that be the matter of jurisdiction 
new jersey court be not concern with south sea murder 
temple admit all that 
alicia want to leave the entire busine alone -PRON- say 
in fact -PRON- insist on -PRON- until a new development force -PRON- to act 
and that 
i inquire 
be that septimus cedar be about to take to -PRON- a sixth bride temple announce gravely a local girl just out of school and sowell -PRON- just canot let -PRON- happen say -PRON- wonot bud arkle bark savagely whack a fist into -PRON- other palm see -PRON- in hell first damn -PRON- 
at last i be able to catalogue arkle 
the boy be of course either a kinsman or a close friend of the sixth bridetobe 
when i bluntly ask -PRON- which the question confuse -PRON- 
temple answer quickly for -PRON- close friend conroy 
-PRON- go to school together 
so then i know that arkle be a disappointed sweetheart 
a neighborhood romance no doubt with -PRON- bud just ripen when along have come the dash and muchmarrie septimus cedar to spoil everything 
-PRON- can see -PRON- own position conroy temple say could hardly go to the girl or -PRON- parent with -PRON- evidence in -PRON- present form 
i see that clearly 
yet alicia be determine to save this young girl 
eve marland from tie up with cedar 
the man be twice the girl age but -PRON- fascinate -PRON- 
since -PRON- would deny the identity -PRON- would do no good merely to warn the girl 
so alicia suggest that -PRON- frighten -PRON- away 
i try that with a row of six cedar and a misnomer on the gate but -PRON- produce no result 
so next confide in bud arkle 
so -PRON- plot to meet landren and miss seventh cedar land as though by accident on a golf course 
there bud introduce -PRON- as a friend 
i cultivate the acquaintance until -PRON- be mature enough to warrant invite -PRON- to dinner 
except for the contradiction of six cedar and the name over -PRON- gate have the man any reason to suspect -PRON- as a challenger 
none at all 
i have keep rokh out of sight 
and alicia with -PRON- maid only arrive this afternoon 
just then the mantel clock strike seven due now temple say 
fve invite -PRON- for dinner tonight 
septimus cedar and -PRON- sixth 
i ask 
then i hear the front door ring eerily through the house 
there -PRON- be john temple say grimly 
try to compose -PRON- alicia 
rokh show -PRON- in 
dinner for seven go to confront the man who unless -PRON- be absurdly astray -PRON- have last encounter on the occasion of be bat overboard with a capstan bar 
and here among -PRON- alicia carterall sit wait with such strained tension that -PRON- be all bind to share -PRON- 
septimus cedar -PRON- know do not expect to see -PRON- here 
nor have -PRON- see -PRON- at all since -PRON- have break away from -PRON- at the death pit 
i move to the hall arch spy past the drape there 
i want a look at the fellow face at the first instant of -PRON- contact with rokh 
if guilty surely such a startling encounter would surprise -PRON- into make some move or exclamation which would give -PRON- away 
when -PRON- distinctly fail to do so i be almost ready to drop the case against leonard landren 
-PRON- look rokh straight in the eye without even a flush 
well here -PRON- be eve -PRON- say easily to the pretty young girl who enter with -PRON- 
with a nonchalance not overdone -PRON- toss -PRON- golf cap to the lascar and say miss marland and mr landren 
and not late i hope 
as rokh come back toward -PRON- portiere -PRON- follow -PRON- 
i get out of the way just in time 
then i take a post from which i could size up the man at -PRON- first sight of alicia 
-PRON- i see be brace as for a blind shock 
-PRON- be seat directly in front of and face the hall arch 
the caller be bind to see -PRON- first of all when -PRON- enter the room 
-PRON- do see -PRON- 
but again -PRON- fail to flush 
-PRON- permit -PRON- eye to rest upon -PRON- for a moment impersonally then quite calmly at ease -PRON- look about for temple 
hello buddy 
and how do -PRON- do mr temple 
those greeting come from eve marland 
this girl seem even young than i have be lead to believe 
temple make the good of -PRON- introduce -PRON- to alkia carterall 
then -PRON- present -PRON- 
in alicia landren seem to take no more interest than be the due of any pretty woman 
a single glance at landren and one could understand why the girl have find -PRON- attractive 
-PRON- be not only finely build and handsome but -PRON- have the way of a man who have be everywhere and know everything 
one of -PRON- guest i hear john temple say have not arrive 
-PRON- shall not however wait long 
landren drop easily into a chair beside alicia 
-PRON- live hereabout miss carterall 
-PRON- face -PRON- smile pleasantly 
which show i think that -PRON- could not possibly be the rogue -PRON- want 
after push four wife into a pit surely no human could thus face a fifth who have escape -PRON- 
in this encounter -PRON- be the woman dime detective magazine who be agitate 
no i live in new york -PRON- say and look so upset that i go to -PRON- rescue an old settler here in sussex county be -PRON- mr landren landren laugh 
not i never settle long in one spot 
be here though nearly a year 
rather like -PRON- out into the hall and find rokh 
see here i say 
be that the fellow -PRON- know in the south sea as septimus cedar 
-PRON- be the man rokh say 
-PRON- hit -PRON- here knock -PRON- off boat 
return to the library i find eve and arkle still pair while landren be engage by some question of that give -PRON- a chance for a whisper aside with alicia

i ask 
-PRON- nod quickly be positive 
-PRON- be i presume wait for the seventh guest 
a half dozen time between seven oclock and seven thirty john temple look at -PRON- watch and frown 
who i keep wonder be this person for whom -PRON- wait 
at seven thirty temple say to rokh ring -PRON- up rokh and find out if -PRON- s come 
the lascar go out 
-PRON- return in about three minute and report that -PRON- have be unable to call the belate guest because the telephone be out of order wait no long temple say 
-PRON- offer an arm to eve marland 
without bat an eye leonard landren offer -PRON- to alicia who by the record of testimony have be -PRON- fifth wife 
-PRON- be game enough to take -PRON- though plainly -PRON- loathe the man 
temple and eve marland lead the way into the hall follow by landren and alicia 
the leftover arkle and -PRON- go next while rokh bring up the rear 
in the dining room -PRON- find a table set for seven 
there be no light other than candle align from end to end of the table 
each candle stick i note be shape like the bole of a tree and have the look and smell of red cedar 
there be seven of these candlesyet only six of -PRON- be light 
no apology be make for the unlighted candle 
there -PRON- be -PRON- could make of -PRON- what -PRON- would 
john temple take the head of the table place eve at -PRON- left and alicia at -PRON- right i be direct to the far end 
landren be place next to alida 
-PRON- position be such that the unlighted candle stand squarely before -PRON- 
on the other side of the table place be set for three 
two of these position be occupy by eve marland and bud arkle 
-PRON- do not sit next to each other though 
between -PRON- be an empty chairthe place presumably of the unarrived guest 
this vacant seat be directly across from landren with the unlighted candle directly between 
an odd arrangement surely yet a polite guest could hardly question -PRON- nor do temple refer to -PRON- 
all the while i know -PRON- be pose an insidious challenge before landren bafflingly compose direct a lively chatter at alicia 
-PRON- draw from -PRON- barely more than oneword response while eve have no well luck with arkle feel lowspirite eve say across the table 
tell -PRON- a funny story leonard and cheer -PRON- up 
landren know funny story and how to tell -PRON- 
-PRON- take a ready command of the conversation through three course serve awkwardly by rokh 
the lascar when not engage take a post directly back of the empty chair 
there -PRON- would stand with -PRON- bald bullet head incline forward and -PRON- eye fix in a baleful stare at landren 
seventh cedar ally -PRON- touch the deep scar on -PRON- forehead 
and landren face -PRON- with no visible disconcertion 
with apparently perfect innocence -PRON- face the unlighted candle the empty chair and rokh 
nor do the presence of alicia at -PRON- side in any way upset the man aplomb 
i be arouse to envy at the way in which -PRON- serve -PRON- pretty compliment 
there be a false note somewhere though 
and at last i place -PRON- 
-PRON- be that landren be too compose 
-PRON- be ignore the evident tension of alicia 
an innocent man i decide would note that -PRON- would perhaps make some comment on -PRON- or at least -PRON- would permit -PRON- to guide the flow of -PRON- chatter 
eve by now have notice -PRON- 
-PRON- know something be afoot be look askance now and then from one to another of -PRON- 
and that i realize be a natural reaction of innocence 
innocence would feel the tension in the air and be subdue by -PRON- 
-PRON- subdue eve marland 
yet landren quite ignore -PRON- 
suddenly i know that landren be guilty as satan -PRON- 
-PRON- be septimus cedar as alicia say 
rokh be stare steadily at -PRON- now across the empty chair and the unlighted candle 
which remind -PRON- that i didnot yet know for whom the empty chair have be provide 
hastily i review the testimony of rokh of alicia and of temple 
most of the character involve be assemble here 
be one of -PRON- absent 
there be and after a moment of thought i place -PRON- 
what about that old clubfoote caretaker hargis 
but hargis be dead 
temple -PRON- have find -PRON- dead 
even so do the chair signify hargi confront landren in line with the unlighted candle well along in account of a tiger hunt the bell of the front door rang shrilly 
-PRON- cut raucously in on recital and -PRON- be force to pause while temple say to rokh there -PRON- be at last 
well better late than never 
show -PRON- in rokh 
the lascar withdraw 
step into the front hall -PRON- close the diningroom door behind -PRON- 
then -PRON- go forward to the main entrance of the house 
-PRON- hear -PRON- open the door hear the faint hum of -PRON- voice as -PRON- greet a caller 
-PRON- come back along the hall conduct the visitor toward -PRON- 
-PRON- could not see but -PRON- could hear 
what -PRON- hear be a limping clump tread 
certain indication that this caller progress under the handicap of some pedal affliction 
-PRON- come bump along down the hall with an uneven cadence as would a man with a wooden leg or a club foot 
hargis 
of course not for hargis be dead breathless i almost forget to watch landren 
when i do look -PRON- way -PRON- seem to be no mare than mildly curious 
certainly there be no moist bead on -PRON- forehead 
clump clump 
the step reach the very door of -PRON- room 
then -PRON- be let down ridiculously 
the lame visitor turn to one side down a narrow hall which i know lead to the study 
in a moment rokh come in alone 
who be -PRON- rokh 
temple ask 
man come to fix telephone 
do i only imagine that a smile of derision form for an instant on the lip of landren 
be the man laugh in -PRON- sleeve at this futile trap set by temple 
i think i could read defeat on -PRON- host face 
have -PRON- play -PRON- last card i see -PRON- shrug -PRON- strong broad shoulder then -PRON- eye meet and now as temple weaken alicia seem to grow more determined 
the resolution of -PRON- slim trim shoulder the set of -PRON- lip assure -PRON- that -PRON- do not mean to give up marriage with eve marland be due within the dime detective magazine weekunless alicia carterall and john temple succeed in reveal the true identity of a monstrous murderer 
the man with the club foot over -PRON- procession back to the library be in different order 
alicia take possession of john temple while eve follow with -PRON- fiance 
the old woman manage that in a frantic effort to hold a council of war 
when i reach the library alicia have -PRON- host and client aside in an alcove 
i could see that -PRON- be insist upon some move to which -PRON- object 
suddenly temple beckon to -PRON- leave -PRON- say in a sotto voice but to accuse the devil to -PRON- face 
-PRON- idea now be to take -PRON- into the study alone and give -PRON- until midnight to get out of the state forever 
in that case -PRON- promise not to tell the fact to eve and -PRON- family 
i agree that the kind thing -PRON- could do would be to let the girl think landren merely a hound deserter 
but alicia object 
-PRON- want to accuse landren be sure -PRON- could do -PRON- more effectively than anyone else 
while -PRON- argue rokh take the issue quite out of -PRON- hand 
-PRON- voice startle -PRON- 
turn quickly -PRON- see that -PRON- be address not landren but eve marland 
-PRON- be -PRON- sixth the lascar say to eve 
when -PRON- tire of -PRON- -PRON- will push -PRON- into a deep pit 
-PRON- be so with the other 
rokh bow caress the scar on -PRON- forehead and fix a steady gaze on landren 
then while -PRON- be all still gasp -PRON- back from the room 
landren gape after -PRON- 
then -PRON- turn with an assure smile and ask of temple be -PRON- screwy 
eve after a moment of speechless shock exclaim -PRON- isnot at all funny 
leonard 
i donot like -PRON- 
i want -PRON- to take -PRON- home 
alicia go to -PRON- beseechingly 
please be warn -PRON- say -PRON- hear that same warning and didnot believe -PRON- 
i be as loyal and trust as -PRON- be now 
and yet later -PRON- try to push -PRON- into a pit 
i think the girl would scream 
but -PRON- seem to freeze on -PRON- lip as -PRON- shrink away from alicia and clung close to arm 
if -PRON- a joke i donot like -PRON- at all -PRON- say faintly be -PRON- wife alicia insist 
-PRON- right name be septimus cedar expression have be amusedly tolerant 
now -PRON- become a bit impatient like eve -PRON- say 
if this be a joke -PRON- doesnot wash down a bit 
-PRON- arm go around the girl go home leonard 
-PRON- take -PRON- arm and urge -PRON- toward the door 
but landren didnot retreat 
if there s music -PRON- say with a shrug to alicia face -PRON- 
do -PRON- really think someone else know -PRON- be -PRON- husband septimus cedar perfectly wild 
eve protest 
please sit down wonot -PRON- 
alicia urge -PRON- gently 
-PRON- must hear what i have to say 
do eve landren -PRON- second prefer to stand the girl say 
-PRON- be perfectly sure i see that landren be impeccable -PRON- story alicia speak directly to eve in a tone infinitely gentle and compassionate 
-PRON- will know i tell the truth -PRON- say because of what -PRON- cost -PRON- 
when i be through a man who have honor -PRON- with an offer of -PRON- namfe will forever despise -PRON- 
i have tell -PRON- only part of the truth 
when -PRON- hear the rest of -PRON- -PRON- will know -PRON- for a cheat and hate -PRON- 
the seventh cedar beyond doubt -PRON- be refer to john temple 
i see a blank astonishment grow now on face 
beyond any doubt -PRON- have be ask alicia to marry -PRON- all of these past three year 
now embody in -PRON- warning to eve -PRON- be tell -PRON- why -PRON- have refuse 
when septimus cedar meet and marry -PRON- alicia say be a trapeze performer in an australian circus by summer 
winter i have bit part in a stock company 
soon after -PRON- marry -PRON- mr cedar put -PRON- up at a honolulu hotel and go away on business 
-PRON- be scout for new pearl bed -PRON- say 
at a bamboo bungalow which -PRON- keep on an almost desert island -PRON- come upon a fugitive thief 
-PRON- recognize the man as guy affere a trust officer who once abscond from new york with a large fortune in cash 
guy affere 
immediately i remember the case 
the man have abscond year ago with more than a million dollar and have never be find 
eve be still highchinne and hostile toward alicia and landren be still half tolerant and half impatient but alicia have -PRON- ear anyway 
arkle temple and i move close 
to one side i glimpse rokh as -PRON- peer from behind the drapery at the hall arch 
-PRON- husband alicia say accost ffie fugitive by -PRON- right name 
affere an old man with a misshapen foot at first deny the identity 
but after a few night of heavy drinking -PRON- admit -PRON- be affere 
what of -PRON- 
-PRON- only crime be larceny and from here -PRON- could not extradite -PRON- 
in any case the cash be safely bury on the island 
to get -PRON- for -PRON- -PRON- husband take pain to woo the confidence of affere 
-PRON- befriend the old cripple who be in ill health from a succession of fever and half mad from lonely brooding 
-PRON- tell affere to make -PRON- at home at the bungalow 
if anyone chance to stop by -PRON- could call -PRON- hargis thg caretaker 
landren interrupted 
do i understand -PRON- inquire without heat that when -PRON- say -PRON- husband septimus cedar -PRON- refer to -PRON- do alicia say keep -PRON- gaze on eve 
eve be the color of chalk 
to -PRON- landren whisper crazy dear 
but let hear -PRON- out 
night of drink there with affere alicia say disclose to -PRON- husband the reason for the old man insane brooding 
safely aflight and use a new name affere have marry a young blond girl at san diego california 
forty year -PRON- junior -PRON- have marry -PRON- for -PRON- money with the idea of spend -PRON- with a choose lover 
old affere find that out when -PRON- file suit for divorce and half -PRON- estate on a trumpedup charge 
-PRON- didnot dare fight the suit because -PRON- would expose -PRON- a fugitive to the scrutiny of the court 
so -PRON- run off take all -PRON- cash with -PRON- to south america 
-PRON- be during that period of -PRON- career that a street car crush -PRON- foot maim -PRON- for life 
three time later in -PRON- wandering -PRON- again marry each time to a young girl 
-PRON- second be a chilena at iqueque -PRON- third a russian in the slavic colony at shanghai -PRON- fourth be a kanaka girl from the island of maui 
the chilena probably play fair with -PRON- alicia say 
but the old man be jealous of -PRON- young friend 
-PRON- be bitter in a state of mind to imagine infidelity 
-PRON- next the shanghai russian be a tartar 
-PRON- try to poison -PRON- 
affere find -PRON- out and leave -PRON- for the kanaka on maui where again -PRON- imagine infidelity which do not exist 
-PRON- end up half crazy with bitterness at -PRON- husband bamboo refuge on the island 
dime detective magazine there in -PRON- drinking bout with -PRON- husband -PRON- constantly heap imprecation against -PRON- four desert wife should have throttle -PRON- all -PRON- would rage 
if i werenot a coward and a cripple go back and do -PRON- now ordeal of this recital be take a terrific toll from alicia 
-PRON- halt -PRON- for a moment during which i try to picture the mentality of affere as -PRON- rot amongst the weed of -PRON- bitterness on that island 
one night in -PRON- cup alicia say -PRON- offer to give all of -PRON- money to the man who would do -PRON- for -PRON- 
-PRON- husband be interested 
-PRON- lead the discussion on 
immediately -PRON- see a way to deceive the old manhe see a way to make -PRON- appear that the four woman be murder when really there be no violence at all 
-PRON- first idea be to go away and return in a suitable time with fake news account tell of four separate homicide 
now -PRON- bargain with affere through many night of drinking 
finally -PRON- get the name and address of the four woman 
but affere be sharp enough to see the news account could be fake 
so -PRON- would not trust -PRON- four woman must be bring to the island one by one and kill before eye 
affere a coward would -PRON- have no contact with the crime 
-PRON- would merely watch from a distance 
then -PRON- would pay the price 
eve marland by now be grip with horror 
one small white fist be push against -PRON- lip 
landren stand with -PRON- arm around -PRON- keenly attentive 
what strike -PRON- most forcibly be the revelation that the four wife be not after all but -PRON- husband alicia resume pretend to agree 
one of the approach to the bamboo bungalow be a path beside which be a deep pit 
the plot finally hatch be this as the agent arrive in turn with each wife -PRON- would lead -PRON- toward the bungalow along that path 
affere would be watch from the bungalow 
a certain signal would signify that -PRON- see the couple come 
then in each case the agent would topple the victim into the pit 
-PRON- throat be dry when i ask but surely -PRON- miss carterall didnot agree to lend -PRON- to any such monstrous deception -PRON- shoot a pleading glance toward john temple think i be lend -PRON- only to the saving of four life hand be on -PRON- shoulder 
of course alicia -PRON- say gently 
i could see now why -PRON- have refrain from tell -PRON- of these horror before 
though -PRON- motive at the time be honest later knowledge of the fact have shame -PRON- 
-PRON- bare -PRON- now only as a last bitter resort to warn eve marland 
affere give -PRON- husband four letter one to each wife 
each letter say -PRON- be side and die and for the woman to come come fast enough -PRON- say bitterly for -PRON- each want -PRON- money 
-PRON- husband then go to honolulu where i have be all this while 
-PRON- tell -PRON- about the plan but entirely distort -PRON- motive for pretend to comply 
-PRON- be a very persuasive man 
miss marland 
and i be infatuate with -PRON- as -PRON- be now 
-PRON- method of pretend to comply be this -PRON- would go in turn to san diego iqueque shanghai and maui 
without accost any of -PRON- -PRON- would observe each woman who have work on the stage would prepare a costume and makeup for each one 
the motive -PRON- give -PRON- for pretend to comply be that if -PRON- refuse then affere would seek another agent 
ha would entrust those errand of murder to the first beachcomber who come along 
the seventh cedar and in the end -PRON- offer would be accept 
so why not make -PRON- think the crime have be consummate 
what harm would there be in deceive -PRON- 
-PRON- husband glib and convincing make -PRON- think -PRON- a fine chivalrous crusade 
for pay affere would give -PRON- husband the cash fortune which would then be send anonymously to the new york trust company from which -PRON- have be embezzle -PRON- see every end of justice would be serve a moment -PRON- be all breathless 
a instead of be absurdly fantastic the thing now be really begin to seem neatly plausible 
yet landren choose to exclaim amazing -PRON- dear young lady 
as i understand the first four wife be only the fifth be -PRON- and -PRON- double for the victim at each murder 
-PRON- vein of sarcasm be plain enough 
alicia ignore -PRON- face eve 
-PRON- do -PRON- -PRON- say 
four time from a distance the rheumy eye of affere see -PRON- push into the pit 
but a swing have be erect in -PRON- in each case unbeknownst to affere 
as an extrapeze artist -PRON- be easy for -PRON- to catch the swing then to lower -PRON- on a rope to the bottom 
from there i crawl through the tunnel to the beach hide under the cliff until -PRON- husband have a chance to pick -PRON- up 
do -PRON- deceive affere on all four occasion 
i ask 
-PRON- think -PRON- do but probably -PRON- didnot 
or maybe affere simply welch on the bargain 
anyway -PRON- decline to turn over the money 
i be at nukualofa when -PRON- happen 
but when -PRON- husband return to -PRON- -PRON- do not admit the failure 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- have receive the money from affere and have ship -PRON- anonymously to the rightful owner 
for what reason would -PRON- tell -PRON- that 
to keep -PRON- from write letter of warn to the four threaten wife 
if i do that i would start a hornet nest buzz 
affere would soon have visitor 
-PRON- would no longer be a private mark for -PRON- husband who still hope to get the money 
after a while alicia tell -PRON- begin to worry about affere 
-PRON- be now just a broken old cripple sick and die on a lonely island 
i have conspire to deceive -PRON- so now i think of -PRON- and pity -PRON- 
i insist that -PRON- take -PRON- supply of food and medicine 
when -PRON- husband agree i mistake -PRON- motive for kindness 
actually -PRON- merely want to stalk that bury fortune once again 
-PRON- go 
this time i be in -PRON- true character 
rokh do not recognize -PRON- as the nordic blonde the iqueque chilena the shanghai slav or the brown kanaka -PRON- have transport on early occasion 
think -PRON- a fifth wife -PRON- warn -PRON- statement of i could no longer doubt any part of the story 
-PRON- make testimony match perfectly with reach the island -PRON- say -PRON- leave rokh on the beach with -PRON- boat and climb to the hilltop bungalow 
there -PRON- find affere dead in bed 
-PRON- have succumb to fever 
toward the last however -PRON- apparently have make a desperate effort to gather up -PRON- loot and get away 
how do -PRON- gather that 
i ask 
because -PRON- see all of the longburied money right there on the table 
septimus cedar try to explain away the lie -PRON- have tell -PRON- about the return of the money 
disgusted i refuse to listen to -PRON- protestation 
as i leave the bungalow -PRON- take -PRON- arm to guide meit be darkand as -PRON- argue -PRON- move along that jungle dime detective magazine path toward the cliff 
suddenly i see the pit 
this time there be no swing or rope in -PRON- 
and i feel -PRON- husband grip tighten on -PRON- arm 
-PRON- intend to kill -PRON- so that -PRON- could take the money without -PRON- be know 
soyou escape 
landren ask evenly of alicia 
now please let -PRON- 
tin have be rather exhaust -PRON- know 
-PRON- direct a weary smile first at temple then at arkle then at -PRON- 
-PRON- return -PRON- with frigid stare 
john hand be still rest lightly on shoulder 
-PRON- must have tell -PRON- that the new light -PRON- have throw on the matter make no difference 
nor be eve marland less loyal to the man who call -PRON- landren 
what flash through -PRON- own lawyer mind be this there be really nothing on landren even if -PRON- bait -PRON- into admit -PRON- be cedar 
cedar have murder no one 
more and more -PRON- be clear that all -PRON- could hope for be to make eve marland see that -PRON- be cedar 
please take -PRON- home leonard -PRON- say now 
and alicia beseech -PRON- please be convince 
i be -PRON- wife 
-PRON- canot look at -PRON- and deny -PRON- 
but landren couldand do 
then -PRON- permit eve to draw -PRON- toward the door 
alicia follow still protest courageously 
very well -PRON- say 
-PRON- be brazen enough to face -PRON- 
but could -PRON- face the four wife of affere 
that challenge -PRON- into stop 
be -PRON- go to pull -PRON- out of a hat come derisively from landren 
alicia say in a breathless rush to eve a test -PRON- canot face 
i dare -PRON- to try 
i mean i dare -PRON- to look at -PRON- as i be make up to deceive affere eye be like saucer 
alicia say in a trunk upstairs i have all four of those costume 
-PRON- maid be there to help -PRON- make up afraid to -PRON- say tensely to eve 
-PRON- have i guess some ace in the hole afraid -PRON- challenge evidence in those four character which -PRON- can not face 
and -PRON- know -PRON- 
-PRON- word fire -PRON- imagination 
and to landren -PRON- give no choice 
if -PRON- withdraw now -PRON- would seem to retreat in poor order from new and vital evidence see -PRON- through eve -PRON- sigh 
and -PRON- may as well make -PRON- comfortable 
when -PRON- have induce eve to sit down alicia carterall leave -PRON- 
-PRON- hear -PRON- run up the step tb -PRON- room 
the seventh cedar a remarkably short time alicia come down make up to represent the first of four wife 
i be disappoint for the deception be not particularly effective 
the san diego woman have be describe as a blonde and alicia have have no time to treat the blackness of -PRON- own hair 
-PRON- have overcome that drawback partially by conceal -PRON- hair under a jaunty yatching cap -PRON- wear white duck trouser and a middy blouse and be smoke a cigarette 
-PRON- lip and cheek be red and -PRON- have do something to -PRON- eyebrow 
-PRON- would be fair if -PRON- have moonlight -PRON- say 
when -PRON- turn off all the light except one dim yellow globe in a far comer the deception be slightly improve 
like a manikin alicia pose before landren turn so that -PRON- see each profile 
-PRON- hobby be boat -PRON- remember -PRON- remind landren 
-PRON- be in this dress -PRON- see -PRON- so -PRON- copy -PRON- that so 
the seventh cedar -PRON- know landren say to eve really begin to believe -PRON- s sincere and that -PRON- have -PRON- confuse with someone else 
-PRON- maid have the next costume ready and be down again quickly alicia say 
be patient please 
-PRON- hurry out and up die stair 
as -PRON- wait in the gloom i speak in an undertone to temple 
this be no part of -PRON- program -PRON- be not -PRON- say 
and i canot see -PRON- object 
a chilena a russian and a kanaka i be think would be brunette 
therefore alicia -PRON- a brunette would be better fit for those part 
with stage experience and a maid to help -PRON- -PRON- could make quick change 
when alicia appear before -PRON- as the chilena -PRON- be much more convincing 
over -PRON- head be a crimson mantilla -PRON- fold push back just far enough to show -PRON- fine ebon hair 
this hair be now centerparte 
the end of the mantilla hang forward over -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- dress have a laced bodice and a short wide skirt and in this hand at hip -PRON- whirl like a dervish before landren 
-PRON- be -PRON- scream -PRON- remind -PRON- softly which help most to deceive affering 
-PRON- remember how i always scream when -PRON- push -PRON- into the pit 
like this 
alicia scream earsplittingly 
-PRON- be enough to curdle one blood 
if landren lose color -PRON- couldnot blame -PRON- 
for so do all of -PRON- 
then in a flash alicia be go a little while alicia appear before -PRON- as the shanghai russian 
this time -PRON- look weirdly wicked 
-PRON- wear long jade earring 
the slave bracelet on -PRON- wrist be coil silver serpent and -PRON- slim figure be tightly gown in anklelength satin 
-PRON- paint face be dapple with round black spot 
a feather fan half hide -PRON- as -PRON- weave sinuously in the gloom before landren 
do -PRON- remember -PRON- challenge what a time -PRON- have duplicate these 
-PRON- shake the twin bracelet before the eye of landren 
that shanghai girl have wheedle -PRON- out of affere 
fail to duplicate -PRON- -PRON- pose as a collector and actually buy the original from the girl 
later as i straggle in -PRON- grasp by the pit one of -PRON- come off and fall on the path 
see there next day by affere -PRON- be compelllngly convincing 
take -PRON- away leonard 
eve marland plead 
-PRON- be cling as loyally as ever to arm 
please 
but there s only one more model i believe landren say 
so let see -PRON- through 
would -PRON- mind get do with -PRON- quickly 
miss carterall shall get do with -PRON- quickly enough alicia promise and leave -PRON- 
that last be tweenact interval be solemn and silent 
i -PRON- be anything but confident 
alicia have parade in three character without as far as i could tell make any impression upon landren 
at last the fourth and final model appear before -PRON- 
this time -PRON- be really convincing 
here as real as life seem to be a chocolateskinne kanaka 
i be amazed that alicia could have so transform -PRON- thus swiftly 
nor have -PRON- depend much on ornament or property of costume 
-PRON- dress be a simple house frock 
-PRON- head and arm be bare 
bare and as brown as india 
no wonder -PRON- stare 
the model pose for a long minute before landren then quite suddenly the light come on 
instantly landren be on -PRON- foot 
one single word be shock from dime detective magazine that be -PRON- name the model say 
and the voice be not then the truth flash 
instead of come down -PRON- alicia have send -PRON- maid 
and the maid not only look like the kanaka bride of guy affere but -PRON- be that very girl 
suddenly alicia still dressed as the shanghai vampire appear beside -PRON- kanaka maid 
septimus cedar know -PRON- name of course -PRON- say to eve although i have not mention -PRON- 
only for a brief moment do the surprise shatter defense 
but -PRON- be long enough 
eve have see -PRON- face in that moment and hear -PRON- one speak word 
-PRON- have give -PRON- away 
expect to see a mere imitator sudden sight of the real article have prove too much for -PRON- 
-PRON- have slip -PRON- mask and i could only marvel at the genius of the thrust 
-PRON- far outshine any which have be offer by temple 
what a fine foundation have be lay in the deliberate parade of three spurious character 
then when -PRON- have -PRON- smugly off guard alicia have bowl -PRON- over with the real thing be try to right -PRON- with eve 
but eve be back away from -PRON- 
-PRON- be disillusion 
that one peep behind the mask have be enough 
instantly -PRON- be through forever with landren 
gaze at -PRON- with a grow horror -PRON- take the ring from -PRON- finger 
when -PRON- hold -PRON- toward -PRON- -PRON- decline to take -PRON- 
-PRON- fall with a tinkle to the floor 
when landren step toward -PRON- arm futilely outstretche -PRON- own foot crush -PRON- 
then voice boom decisively 
rokh please show mr cedar to the gate 
not merely to the door rokh but to the gate 
septimus cedar turn on -PRON- heel and leave the room 
rokh follow 
-PRON- go out the front door and -PRON- hear -PRON- bang shut behind -PRON- 
then possibly half a minute later i think i hear some sort of cry out there 
i wasnot sure though 
those with -PRON- be too engrossed to hear anything at all 
the maid have go upstairs 
eve be cry while bud arkle vainly try to comfort -PRON- 
john temple be speak earnestly aside with alicia 
light a cigar i puff -PRON- thoughtfully 
after a while i try to join temple and alicia but there i find three to be a crowd 
so i stroll across the hall to the gunroom 
once more three make a crowd for i find eve and bud seat on a bench the girl weeping on the boy shoulder

the door be slam 
an instant later from beyond that close portal -PRON- voice ring out in a shrill agonized shriek of terror 
as suddenly as -PRON- have break out -PRON- stop 
there be a moment of ghastly silence follow by a dull thud 
a minute later the door be open again 
from -PRON- place on the floor zeph could see that the other room be light and -PRON- recall that big jack have tell kicker to bring candle from the store 
zeph move onto -PRON- side so -PRON- could see well 
in the orange rectangle of the door a tower black figure be outline for a moment 
then jack killifer flashlight in hand strode up to the man on the floor 
-PRON- roll zeph over on -PRON- face and examine the clothesline bond on -PRON- wrist then -PRON- ankle 
apparently satisfy -PRON- straighten up 
now maybe i can get some sleep -PRON- growl and stride from the room 
zeph try to picture what have happen behind that dose door only a few indian trick minute before 
with a shudder -PRON- come to the conclusion that killifer in -PRON- blind rage have strangle the girl with the yellow hair 
that shriek of terror still echo in ear 
the girl have tell -PRON- that -PRON- be in no immediate danger because these two killer hope to use -PRON- as a guide if -PRON- should become necessary to take to the wood 
but -PRON- couldnot count on that 
and -PRON- realize also that there be a slim chance that the girl with the yellow hair have not be kill yet 
if -PRON- be still alive something have to be do to save -PRON- 
-PRON- press -PRON- tooth together until -PRON- jaw ache 
-PRON- utter helplessness be agonize 
-PRON- have to get rid of -PRON- bond -PRON- tell -PRON- over and over 
and -PRON- lie there on the floor -PRON- mind grope frantically for some possible mean of accomplish this 
by push with -PRON- bind hand -PRON- finally manage to jerk up to a sit position 
that be a help 
-PRON- could now look out the window with -PRON- broken pane 
not more than a third of the glass be leave 
gradually a thoughtful smile cross -PRON- long face 
one eyebrow lift almost imperceptibly -PRON- nod slowly as if to confirm the idea that have flash into -PRON- head 
inch by inch -PRON- wriggle to the wall to the window 
by stretch -PRON- be just able to reach the sill 
-PRON- hook -PRON- chin over -PRON- 
-PRON- pull -PRON- slowly up get -PRON- forehead onto the sill and give a quick push 
-PRON- be on -PRON- foot 
lean forward -PRON- examine the window as well as -PRON- could in the dim hght 
then by rock from heel to toe -PRON- move across the short distance and back up to the break pane 
-PRON- bend backward shove out -PRON- bind wrist as far as finally -PRON- find what -PRON- neededa splinter of glass that still stick in the frame 
slowly and painfully -PRON- begin to saw the rope against -PRON- 
-PRON- stop often to listen 
but no sound come from the front room 
-PRON- cut -PRON- again and again -PRON- could feel the warm blood on -PRON- palm 
at last zeph detect that the soft rope be yield 
a moment later -PRON- have free -PRON- hand 
swiftly -PRON- bend over and remove the bond from -PRON- ankle 
-PRON- stretch -PRON- cramp limb to restore circulation wipe the blood away with -PRON- handkerchief tiptoe zeph cross the kitchen to the door lead to the front room 
-PRON- place -PRON- ear close to the panel and listen 
from beyond come a faint snoring mingle with heavy breathing 
zeph smile to -PRON- 
-PRON- captor exhaust from -PRON- long drive be sleep 
-PRON- would be easy now for -PRON- to make -PRON- escape -PRON- realize 
yet -PRON- give that scarcely a passing thought 
-PRON- be not in -PRON- nature to retreat when -PRON- have a chance to capture the enemy 
and there be the girl 
perhaps -PRON- be already beyond any help but until -PRON- be certain of -PRON- death -PRON- mean to use every mean in -PRON- power to save -PRON- 
-PRON- recrosse the kitchen slowly open the back door 
outside -PRON- pause to look around for a few second 
-PRON- be grow light have to work fast 
circle the house at some distance -PRON- reach the big sedan park at the front 
carefully -PRON- raise the hood that cover the powerful engine 
in the deep shadow which envelop -PRON- -PRON- could see nothing but -PRON- grope finger find a wire and -PRON- give -PRON- a jerk 
one by one -PRON- remove half a dozen section of the ignition cable 
then -PRON- lower the hood into place again 
retrace -PRON- step zeph pass the dime detective magazine rear of the tumbledown farmhouse keep go 
from time to time -PRON- hurl one of the piece of wire into the underbrush 
temporarily at least -PRON- have block any swift dash for freedom by automobile 
as soon as -PRON- have put a considerable distance between -PRON- and the house zeph increase -PRON- pace 
-PRON- head down the narrow weedchoked lane by which -PRON- have arrive a few hour earlier 
half a mile down -PRON- angle off from the roadway into the underbrush 
a little farther and the tree and ground growth thin out into a small rocky clearing 
zeph smile grimly 
-PRON- hadnot forget the lay of the land around grider lake 
briskly -PRON- set to work 
the light be increase rapidly as -PRON- set about gather a pile of dry branch 
when -PRON- have enough -PRON- stoop low and presently be fan a tiny blaze into life 
-PRON- add fuel until -PRON- have a sizable fire then make -PRON- way into the surround thicket and return with an armful of green twig 
these -PRON- add to the flame 
as the fire swiftly turn into a heavy smudge -PRON- stand watch -PRON- for a few moment 
-PRON- nod an expression of satisfaction on -PRON- lean face as the smoke climb upward in the still air 
from -PRON- pocket -PRON- take out -PRON- handkerchief stain with blood from -PRON- lacerate wrist which -PRON- fasten to a sapling near the smoky fire 
something else go with the handkerchief a little later 
and then -PRON- glide from the clearing back into the wood and head toward the farmhouse where killifer and dell be sleep 
conceal behind a thick clump of underbrush zeph look across the open field toward the dilapidated structure 
-PRON- be daylight now and -PRON- could see the place plainly 
there be no sign of life about -PRON- as yet 
the killer must still be sleep squat on -PRON- heel 
-PRON- be ready to watch and wait with the patience of the indian who have once roam this timbere wilderness 
-PRON- first impulse on slip -PRON- bond have be to go for help 
but if -PRON- go for help there be the possibility that either killifer or dell may wake up go into the kitchen discover -PRON- have escape 
in that case zeph figure -PRON- would lose no time make a getaway 
when -PRON- find -PRON- car have be put out of commission -PRON- would probably take to the wood on foot 
zeph wasnot enough of a woodsman to follow a trail of that kind 
hardly anybody could 
if jack killifer and kicker dell be to be capture and -PRON- murderous career bring to an end -PRON- couldnot let -PRON- out of -PRON- sight 
that be why zeph squat there in the underbrush that be why -PRON- frequently turn and gaze with thoughtful eye back toward the spot where -PRON- have build the fire 
the sun climb high 
still there be no sign of life in the crumble building across the clearing 
the smoke from -PRON- fire no longer mount toward the sky and zeph estimate that -PRON- have be wait there in the brush for a couple of hour 
-PRON- be about to shift -PRON- position and relieve -PRON- cramp muscle when a sudden shrill cry break upon the morning air 
at the same instant a figure burst from the front door of the farmhouse 
-PRON- be the yellowhaired girl 
-PRON- stumble over the stoop start run across the open field toward the wood 
and the huge killifer be close behind -PRON- 
then -PRON- trip sprawl forward with arm fling wide 
instantly indian trick killifer be upon -PRON- 
-PRON- yank -PRON- upright 
-PRON- scream a frenzied bloodchilling sound fill with stark fear 
jack kill -PRON- 
i didnot help -PRON- get away 
for sake jack fist cut off -PRON- frantic plea 
-PRON- catch -PRON- on the side of -PRON- head and again -PRON- go tumble into the dirt and stubble of the field a pitiful crumple heap on the brown ground 
zeph start forward -PRON- eye blaze with rage 
but suddenly -PRON- halt glide swiftly behind a conceal tree trunk 
kicker dell pistol in hand have appear from the house and be stand on the stoop 
-PRON- run toward killifer who be lift the limp form of the yellowhaired babe better get the hell out of here 
kicker cry

how about -PRON- take -PRON- along killifer growl ainot do with -PRON- yet 
-PRON- get -PRON- stuff together and get the bus start 
kicker dell nod turn and hurry back towards the farmhouse 
killifer carry the unconscious girl make for the sedan 
a grim smile twist mouth with clench hand -PRON- back into the wood until -PRON- be sure -PRON- could not be see 
then -PRON- slip through the brush as fast as -PRON- could go 
-PRON- circle the clearing till -PRON- be at the rear of the house 
cast caution aside -PRON- dash to the back door 
noiselessly -PRON- step into the kitchen 
the door to the front room be open and -PRON- see kicker dell bend over a suitcase which -PRON- be close 
-PRON- gun lie on the floor beside -PRON- 
slowly and silently zeph ease forward to the doorway into the front room 
and as -PRON- step across the sill the ancient floorboards creak straighten up and whirl in a single movement 
and then zeph be upon -PRON- 
a tangle mass of arm and leg -PRON- crash to the floor 
over and over the two man roll hand find face the finger clutch for -PRON- eye 
but only for a brief moment 
zeph twist sideways bring -PRON- knee up and send the cursing pant kicker hurtle from -PRON- 
outside a car door slam 
zeph scramble to -PRON- foot 
kicker be only on -PRON- knee when zeph pounce upon -PRON- again 
the tall man arm shoot around body beneath the armpit and before the killer realize what be happen -PRON- be pull upright 
as killifer a gun in each hand burst through the doorway zeph have draw kicker close to -PRON- gun come up but -PRON- hesitate 
-PRON- pal be an unwilling and curse shield between those ugly weapon and -PRON- target 
the big killer face turn livid with rage 
-PRON- eye become shoot with blood and the nostril of -PRON- thick nose quiver

-PRON- take a step and almost collapse 
and then -PRON- know that one of the slug that rip into the body of kicker dell have pass on through into -PRON- own groin 
with an effort zeph reach the doorway 
there -PRON- pause support -PRON- against the frame 
-PRON- look out into the farmyard 
fifty foot away be a still figure stretch upon the ground the lifeless finger clutch a pair of gun
