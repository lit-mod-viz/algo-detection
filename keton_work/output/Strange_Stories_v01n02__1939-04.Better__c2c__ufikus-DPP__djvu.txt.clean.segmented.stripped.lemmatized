a strange experience but how about the japanese corporal who confidentially reveal -PRON- strange experience in northern china to an english friend within the past year 
here be the story for many mile northwest of peipe a japanese regiment have advance finally near the objective not far from mongolia 
but before -PRON- could reach this point -PRON- have to pass through a small mountain village situate in a tiny valley 
the road be narrow bound by two hill which command the road 
on the clifflike side of these two hill be huge rock ideal for machinegun nest which could mow down any soldier enter the village 
there be several of these nest and many japanese soldier have be kill 
finally the japanese commander bring up -PRON- artillery and give order to blow those machinegun nest to bit 
-PRON- be demobilize 
any chinese gunner in -PRON- be bury under a pile of rock and debris 
all but one 
heavy shell could not stop this gun which keep fire whenever any japanese soldier come into view 
something have to be do to silence that gun 
finally a japanese corporal with one man be order to climb the rear of the hill and try to sneak down on the chinese gunner and destroy -PRON- 
the whole regiment wait 
an hour pass 
then the corporal and -PRON- man be see crawl on -PRON- belly down from the top of the hill 
-PRON- have to be careful 
the slope be steep 
-PRON- be an intense moment 
if the chinese gunner see -PRON- -PRON- would be able to swing -PRON- gun around and exterminate -PRON- with ease 
but the gun keep shoot at the road below whenever a japanese soldier appear in the open 
the japanese purposely coax the fire so the gunner would not notice the man creep down behind -PRON- 
tense moment -PRON- be not until the corporal be fifty foot away that -PRON- could barely see the chinese gunner protect under a heavy arch of rock sit at -PRON- gun which point through a small opening 
the corporal be afraid to hurl a hand grenade for fear that the explosion may loosen the dirt beneath -PRON- own body and -PRON- and -PRON- man would slide to death 
and -PRON- would be difficult to throw a grenade in the small archway 
furthermore the gunner be so protect that even a pistol shot would have to be too accurate 
there wasnot enough of the body expose to view 
no the only way be to knife -PRON- or shoot -PRON- at close range 
suddenly as the corporal crawl closer a small rock under -PRON- give way 
-PRON- roll down the slope and bounce on the archway 
the japanese corporal heart almost stop from fear 
if the gunner hear -PRON- and look around -PRON- would be sure death for the japanese 
but the gunner didnot budge 
-PRON- seem to be glue to the spot -PRON- eye on the opening in front of -PRON- 
forty foot thirty foot twenty ten 
-PRON- be upon -PRON- 
now to rush -PRON- 
the corporal draw -PRON- gun and the private grab -PRON- trench knife in readiness 
both man jump at the same time and inch away the corporal shoot the chinese in the back while the private plunge a knife into the filthy neck 
the gunner seem to slump over -PRON- gun from the force of impact and the two japanese satisfy -PRON- have kill -PRON- jump to the top of the archway and shout to -PRON- comrade 
a cry of victory go up from the troop below as -PRON- run into the road in answer to the brave corporal 
but something be wrong 
the gun suppose to be silence begin fire again and several japanese soldier drop in the road below

i have here a pack of twentyfive playingcard 
-PRON- be special card five suit of five each 
there be five star five circle five square five set of wavy line and five crosse 
-PRON- be single black line figure on a white background and these five be more or less choose for -PRON- simplicity and -PRON- symbolic association with ordinary conscious and subconscious image 
be that clear enough 
five set of card square circle cross star wavy line pass these set out and allow -PRON- to examine -PRON- 
-PRON- do so and harry clinton look at the little card with the rest 
professor bairn continue the basic idea in use these card be simple 
the operator hold one of -PRON- up to the subject with only the back visible 
the subject close -PRON- eye allow -PRON- mind to become a blank 
then -PRON- call out the name of the first of the five symbol to cross -PRON- consciousness 
-PRON- may actually seem to see a square or a circle or a star as the case may be 
perhaps the operator and the subject be seat back to back so that there be no possibility of facial expression or eye reflection on the part of the operator inform the subject or give -PRON- a hint class exhibit tepid interest clinton include 
accord to the experiment the score of correct guess in most case be five 
this seem natural enough because if -PRON- be to go through the deck of twentyfive and call out star each time -PRON- would have to be right five time since there be five card in each of the five suit 
but and this be a very large but in the course of these experiment -PRON- be discover that some student be able to guess perhaps ten or twelve card correctly 
upon repeat the test over a period of day many achieve score of fifteen or even twenty 
certain people seem peculiarly apt guesser 
while the score of other vary from high to low there be some who persistently turn in the same or nearly the same high score 
this have lead to the set upof a theory of extrasensory perception an unknown quantity which may or may not account for certain people have the knack in make hunch or foresee the future or even for receive telepathic communication 
harry clinton be think about bet on football game 
certain student submit to month of testing 
-PRON- be discover then that odd effect on -PRON- scoring ability could be bring about by get -PRON- drunk or by test -PRON- when -PRON- be fatigue or excite or stimulate 
some of -PRON- score higher when tell -PRON- be make progress other drop woefully 
-PRON- be ascertain that guess ability have nothing to do apparently with the actual intelligence of a person 
but and this be important the variance of reaction under differentiated form of stimulus imply that there be a definite power affect rhine have choose to call this power the power of extrasensory perception 
i believe that professor rhine have show the way to opening up new frontier of the human mind 
and with -PRON- permission i should like to call upon a few volunteer today clinton be one of the five choose 
-PRON- watch three other sit blindfold in a chair while professor bairn hold up the card one by one and wait for -PRON- to call out a symbol 
-PRON- sort the card into pile of correct and incorrect guess 
clinton notice that the first subject a girl guess very swiftly 
the second hesitate often 
the third go quite fast for a space slow down and regained speed toward the end 
clinton sit in the chair place the warm blindfold over -PRON- eye and begin guess 
square circle circle star square curly line star cross cross curly line cross no that s a square now a cross circle -PRON- feel queer 
-PRON- be hardly -PRON- own voice droning 
-PRON- be hardly -PRON- brain that see in the darkness the rapid flickering image of circle and square and star and curly line and crosse 
something direct -PRON- make -PRON- speak 
-PRON- complete the test in fortytwo second say nothing 
-PRON- discourse on individual peculiarity mention how some guesser be fast other slow other erratic 
-PRON- also intimate that memory that be the knowledge that one have already call star five time and consequently would not call -PRON- again during the same testing may subconsciously influence the guess real definitive score -PRON- say can be obtain only after seven consecutive test 
ah mr clinton would -PRON- care to go through the pack again six time for the benefit of the class 
clinton agree sit down in the chair again 
the image come swiftly 
the period bell ring as the test be conclude and the student troop out bulky figure lean close as clinton rcse and remove -PRON- bandage 
mr clinton like to have a word with -PRON- 
yes professor 
mr clinton i should very much appreciate -PRON- work with -PRON- this semester on these test 
-PRON- initial score i may say be ah remarkably high 
this may be a fluke an accident but any extraordinary ability should be cultivate 
of course this will be credit to -PRON- regular work -PRON- know 
why sure 
why not 
say what be -PRON- average anyway 
mr clinton 
an amazing twentythree 
clinton work with professor bairn for month 
the experiment broaden in -PRON- technique 
new method be employ 
one night baim call clinton on the phone and request -PRON- to guess the card over the wire 
-PRON- work in separate room for several day work with screen between -PRON- work in total darkness conduct the test with telegraph key and call the guess in french and german 
-PRON- make no difference clinton show -PRON- remarkable aptitude throughout 
at first for clinton -PRON- be a lark 
then -PRON- become a problem to wonder over 
after a time -PRON- reach the stage of a competition a battle of wit against the unknown 
and finally during the third month -PRON- be drudgery 
baim be write a monograph on -PRON- work with clinton 
although the professor endeavor to repress -PRON- enthusiasm clinton know that -PRON- be highly pleased with the venture 
the extraclassroom nature of the study keep clinton very busy demand on -PRON- time and -PRON- insistence on undertake test at odd hour and under odder circumstance begin after a while to annoy -PRON- 
there be day when clinton go through the deck thirty time run 
-PRON- grow sick of the symbol exasperate 
even the surprisingly high percentage of totally correct score no longer seem a worthy goal to -PRON- 
despite all the work -PRON- understand no more of -PRON- unusual power or ability than -PRON- have at the beginning 
-PRON- merely close -PRON- eye and the picture come the five symbol loom up almost automatically 
-PRON- try guess ordinary playing card and fail miserably 
-PRON- lose two dollar on the home team in a football game 
-PRON- have no luck in guess examination question 
undoubtedly this peculiar sixth sense be uncontrollable 
by the conclusion of the third month -PRON- be bad than that 
-PRON- leave -PRON- daily test with headache 
-PRON- begin to experience period of moody irritability 
moreover -PRON- have a tendency to forget trifle and detail 
a sort of mild amnesia seem to steal over -PRON- at time so that -PRON- be unable to account for -PRON- action for halfhour at a time 
usually after -PRON- testing period -PRON- would have difficulty in concen18 trate on anything else for quite a while 
the symbol stick with -PRON- and close -PRON- eye -PRON- would involuntarily conjure up image of crosse and star and curly line and square and circle 
-PRON- float in -PRON- head and when -PRON- open -PRON- eye again an hour have pass somehow 
this get bad 
clinton tell no one for -PRON- -PRON- do not quite know what be the matter 
but in the middle of may -PRON- suddenly experience an attack of amnesia which last for three day so hard to think 
harry clinton that be -PRON- name have go into a room and now -PRON- hand be around something soft 
-PRON- have do many thing in the past three day and somehow -PRON- couldnot think just what -PRON- be 
or rather a part of -PRON- didnot want to remember what -PRON- be 
-PRON- have be bad thing 
be -PRON- at home in the roominghouse in -PRON- own bed 
be this all a nightmare 
no -PRON- be real 
-PRON- be stand with -PRON- hand around something soft and three day have pass 
three day of school of study of work 
why couldnot -PRON- remember -PRON- 
-PRON- be even hard to see 
-PRON- feel as though -PRON- eye be close as though -PRON- be take the test guess at the brightlycolore mental picture of crosse star curly line square and circle 
that be why -PRON- couldnot remember 
-PRON- have something to do with the test and the way -PRON- have affect -PRON- lately 
-PRON- must think back now 
for a week or so -PRON- have be take forty turn through the deck a day 
professor baim have ask -PRON- to as a final experiment to be write up for -PRON- almost complete monograph 
each day testing have leave -PRON- with a terrific headache 
more than that -PRON- have be unable lately to shake off the recur vision of the five symbol 
-PRON- would leave the college and one or more of the symbol would come and stay in -PRON- brain 
-PRON- would fall asleep thinking of the cross and awake with the same thought static in -PRON- mind 
that have cause -PRON- memory lapse 
but where be -PRON- now 
-PRON- stare down again at -PRON- hand and gasp as mist clear 
-PRON- harry clinton remember 
-PRON- remember that first evening when -PRON- have think -PRON- be go to be sick and have step into the alley 
-PRON- have lean over the refusebox as consciousness dissolve into a swirl mist 
but now -PRON- could recall what happen 
-PRON- have lean over the refusebox have gaze into -PRON- and see what lie at the bottom 
two broken stick lie there probably tear from some packingcrate 
-PRON- lie there one atop the other and -PRON- have form a cross 
a cross 
clinton have pick -PRON- up that be -PRON- hand have do so 
clinton -PRON- do not exist 
there be only hand and something guide -PRON- which be not clinton or brain some alien force that feel draw to the symbol of the cross 
the hand pick up the stick fumble about in the trashbox for a length of wire bind the stick into a permanent crucifixshape 
then body have walk down the narrow alley and eye have keep look at the base of the cross where the stick be break and end in a jagged point eye have gloat 
but clinton -PRON- have hate what -PRON- be do because -PRON- do not understand and hate the other part of consciousness which drive -PRON- to fashion a symbol -PRON- wish to forget so that as -PRON- walk -PRON- grow very angry 
every time -PRON- close -PRON- eye the cross be there in -PRON- forehead 
-PRON- be burn up there just the way -PRON- do when clinton guess the card at school 
only there be no card this time and still the cross remain 
the memory be haunt -PRON- make -PRON- do absurd thing like fashion this wooden crucifix with the pointed end 
if only clinton could forget the cross 
-PRON- close -PRON- eye quite tightly lurch down the alley wish that the two cross iron bar against -PRON- brain would go away 
-PRON- must not see the cross clinton open -PRON- eye and see the man come down the alley from the opposite direction 
-PRON- be dark but the moon be up and -PRON- see that the man wear black skirt 
for a moment -PRON- fear -PRON- be delirious and then -PRON- realize the truth 
-PRON- be a priest 
come near -PRON- see the moonlight pick out a glitter pattern on the priest chest 
a glittering pattern of a cross 
the golden cross dangle -PRON- sway from side to side as the priest walk 
the moon be cruelly bright so that -PRON- ray make of the crucifix a blind blur 
clinton look and could not tear -PRON- eye away 
but -PRON- want to -PRON- want to with all -PRON- soul 
-PRON- do not want to do what -PRON- and then clinton step over to the priest just as -PRON- pass and from behind -PRON- back -PRON- draw the wooden crucifix with the pointed end and drive the point straight into the priest chest 
-PRON- walk away -PRON- empty hand clutch at the air with a sort of joy bear of the fact that -PRON- be empty -PRON- no longer hold the cross 
there be joy in -PRON- mind too for -PRON- be empty of the symbol which when normal -PRON- so deeply respected but which in -PRON- dreamlike state of abnormality obsess -PRON- 
no cross now only that tingle emptiness -PRON- whole brain be empty and free 
harry clinton go home and sleep sleep gratefully without dream 
for -PRON- be empty and when -PRON- awake -PRON- have forget the night before with the cross and the priest 
in the class the next day when the card be call clinton score only seven 
two square have come two circle one curly line and two star 
but no cross 
never during the entire test have -PRON- call out a cross or thought of one 
there be time when -PRON- eye close -PRON- have almost consciously try to conjure up the vision of the cross in -PRON- mind 
-PRON- have fail 
-PRON- know that there be five crossmark in the pack of twentyfive and yet in honesty -PRON- could not call aloud an image that -PRON- do not see 
this clinton now remember remember the follow day the day -PRON- guess the five star correctly 
-PRON- be the day of the astronomy lecture too 
have that affect -PRON- 
-PRON- wonder 
-PRON- have call the five star correctly 
after leave class the headache have come 
turn page get relief this simple pleasant way 
exlax be the pleasant effective modern way to take a laxative 
exlax taste like delicious chocolate 
-PRON- be thorough and dependable yet gentle in action 
-PRON- get resultswithout strain or force 
exlax be largestselle laxative as good for youngster a -PRON- be for grownup 
try exlax the next time -PRON- need a laxative 
10c and 25c at all druggist -PRON- walk through the cool street of dusk -PRON- foot move automatically along unbidden path 
thought refuse to come 
-PRON- stop in at a drug store and buy some aspirin then meander along the street again 
-PRON- have not want to go to -PRON- room 
-PRON- catch -PRON- strain to hear the sound of car pass the conversation of other in the street 
for some reason -PRON- be particularly anxious to be amidst noise and light and people anything that may arrest -PRON- attention and ease the ache in -PRON- temple the ache that be all dull nothingness in which a bright star blaze 
erratic footstep follow -PRON- gregarious urge until -PRON- be move along downtown 
the welcome clangor of streetcar begin to fade and only constant blink enable -PRON- to keep -PRON- eye open 
abnormal nictation seem the sole salvation at the moment when now even sound fail to hold -PRON- attention -PRON- have enter the vaudeville theater sink into a loge seat and will -PRON- to watch the final reel of the motion picture flash across the screen 
at the conclusion -PRON- experience a nasty shock when the trademark of the produce company flicker into view with -PRON- crest of five star 
the theater be nearly desert at supperhour and in the darkness harry clinton fight a lose battle with the fivepointe image that thrust -PRON- again and again between -PRON- inner eye and -PRON- outer vision of the screen 
the brassy orchestra herald the stage show and for a few minute clinton again know peace 
but the star act clinton have wince when the master of ceremony announce the turn as such be the personal appearance of a movie queen 
the whole thing be madness 
movie star -PRON- sweep onto the stage against a background of a glitter silverfoil star 
garishly light the five silver point gleam painfully and clinton could not move -PRON- eye away 
the image mock -PRON- and the blonde girl before -PRON- undulate about the stage in sequin seem a part of the star -PRON- 
clinton bite -PRON- hand to keep from scream 
-PRON- mind grope for a thought any thought to hold -PRON- attention to swerve -PRON- from the thought which engulf -PRON- 
and in the darkness -PRON- lose 
-PRON- rise to -PRON- foot and start down the aisle before the act be over 
no longer be -PRON- conscious aware of thought or action 
-PRON- pass the box and enter the passageway which lead backstage 
some part of -PRON- be move slowly cautiously 
all -PRON- see be a great glitter star a star which be emblazon on -PRON- mind and which obtrude between any other image and reality 
-PRON- must get rid of the star in -PRON- mind 
cautiously -PRON- move along the deserted backstage corridor 
the act be over the hallway momentarily desert 
-PRON- walk slowly down toward the door under the light pause before -PRON- 
there be a gold star on the door of the dressingroom 
-PRON- five point be sawteeth bite into -PRON- brain 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- then push the door open 
the blond girl be sit at -PRON- dressingtable eating 
clinton do not see -PRON- 
-PRON- see a star 
there be a heavy bluntended mirror on the table 
there be a large sturdy walkingstick in the corner 
clinton do not see -PRON- 
-PRON- see a stageproperty artificial mace in a wallstand 
-PRON- head be stud with fivepoint 
a star 
clinton ignore the other weapon 
walk slowly -PRON- seize the mace as the door close behind -PRON- 
the girl turn around 
clinton see the star burn bright 
-PRON- rise say something 
clinton see the star move closer 
-PRON- be close enough to reach now 
some part of -PRON- hold the mace 
and then dream fuse with reality as -PRON- bring the mace down 
one two three four five time each time a point fall away from the core of torment in -PRON- brain 
then there be only a blur that become red red as the pool on the floor where something lie 
clinton turn open the door walk out back through the passage and resume -PRON- seat in the theater 
-PRON- must have fall asleep for when -PRON- awake the last show be over and the houselight be go up 
-PRON- do not remember how -PRON- have come to this place or what -PRON- have do here 
and -PRON- do not think about star 
the next day in class -PRON- have refuse to take the test tell professor bairn that -PRON- be indisposed 
at the time -PRON- do not know any reason for do so except that -PRON- feel vaguely tired and incapable of effort 
-PRON- ask to be excuse early and go home 
-PRON- do not even read the paper have -PRON- do so -PRON- may have see the account of the mysterious death of father pornelski who have be murder by an unknown religious fanatic two day before 
-PRON- could have read of a second murder which be already make national headline the strange death of a wellknown motion picture actress be oblivious to all -PRON- only know that -PRON- feel tired and quite unaccountably -PRON- do not wish to continue with the extrasensory perception experiment 
-PRON- have give -PRON- these recent headache and peculiar lapse of memory -PRON- feel sure 
today -PRON- be glad that -PRON- mind be free 
once in -PRON- room -PRON- lie back in the windowless gray and almost revel in the blankness of -PRON- brain 
funny since take up these psych experiment -PRON- would think a hell of a lot about -PRON- own mind 
before that -PRON- have never even know -PRON- have one 
oh well 
-PRON- be pleasant and soothe here 
close -PRON- eye -PRON- watch the two dancing line of parallel curlicue two gray curly line wriggle before -PRON- naked brain 
two curly line 
what do -PRON- remind -PRON- of 
sally 
of course sally curly hair 
-PRON- sure be forgetful these day why -PRON- hadnot see sally for over a week 
mrs johnson the landlady have leave a note under -PRON- door three day ago say that sally have call the night -PRON- be out somewhere walk off -PRON- headache 
the poor kid -PRON- be worry about -PRON- 
why have -PRON- neglect -PRON- that way that -PRON- think of -PRON- think of gray line -PRON- could not stop 
this psych stuff be sure develop -PRON- concentration all right 
-PRON- seem as though -PRON- just have to go and see sally 
-PRON- would be home now thursday afternoon 
-PRON- biology lab period be over at eleven on thursday 
-PRON- must drop in and surprise -PRON- 
-PRON- have to surprise sally 
sally with the curly yellow hair 
two curl in back 
long golden curl girl 
curl 
-PRON- be already walk down the street turn up 
a light misty rain be fall and glance into the street clinton notice the treadmarking cause by the tire of a skid car 
-PRON- leave two curly line 
-PRON- be go to see sally 
one block more 
the curly line 
-PRON- get mix up with -PRON- thought of sally 
two golden caterpillar on -PRON- neck 
on -PRON- white neck 
two curly line 
ring the bell 
no one in 
open the door -PRON- room be in front 
curly fringe on the carpet beneath -PRON- foot 
curly finger knock on the door 
curly line of two red lip to kiss 
oh harry where have -PRON- be worry so curl 
on -PRON- neck 
think about sally not the curl 
what be -PRON- stare at 
-PRON- look funny 
must feel the curl want to but must think until -PRON- be feel think at all 
-PRON- be only after touch the curl that harry clinton do begin to think 
-PRON- be then that -PRON- remember everything the death of the priest and the star and the obsessive mingling of sally and the curly line 
clinton think of all these thing because -PRON- have be shock into do so shock by gaze down at -PRON- own hand clutch curl curl which -PRON- hand have wind about -PRON- neck and tightly press to strangle -PRON- to death 
clinton know then 
even as -PRON- run through the street -PRON- know 
-PRON- could think only too clearly now 
-PRON- be in the grip of some obsession concern the five symbol on the extrasensory perception card 
the strain of guess those symbol with closed eye day after day for month in a variety of experiment -PRON- facility in conjure up the proper mental image these thing have induce some abnormal condition whereby one or more of the symbol now come to -PRON- mind without conscious effort to recall any 
-PRON- be sheer habit to think of a star a cross a curly line a square or a circle 
telepathy what be -PRON- 
what peculiar force in the brain aid -PRON- in -PRON- guessing 
be -PRON- a psychic power or an alien intelligence prompt -PRON- 
whatever the cause the matter have pass all controllable bound 
-PRON- be helpless to fend off the power of the symbol for symbol -PRON- have become 
when prey upon by the recur image of the cross -PRON- have encounter the priest and some part of -PRON- brain have identify the holy man with the cause of -PRON- torment 
-PRON- have kill the priest to erase from -PRON- mind the cross symbol 
and have not instinct guide -PRON- to choose a symbolic weapon 
in the vaudeville theater -PRON- have see the star 
out of several weapon in -PRON- dressingroom -PRON- be prompt by the symbolism of the macehead 
be -PRON- actually guilty of such crime 
or be -PRON- a dual personality 
some subconscious murder impulse have guide -PRON- very cunningly in the execution of -PRON- killing 
be -PRON- insane 
-PRON- must have be to kill sally 
good god -PRON- have kill -PRON- 
that be why -PRON- be run 
no one have see -PRON- 
-PRON- curly hair two curly line on -PRON- neck writhe through -PRON- brain -PRON- be force to erase the crawling curly line from memorj 
symbolically -PRON- do so with -PRON- death 
that be another thing 
-PRON- have not take the test 
merely think of sally this last time have cause identification 
and there be still the circle and the square to go 
would -PRON- murder two image of transference because of -PRON- 
-PRON- pant with exhaustion lie on the bed in -PRON- room 
would -PRON- murder two more 
what could -PRON- do to prevent -PRON- to drop psych 
that be certain 
and keep from anything which may even vaguely be associate with the last two symbol 
-PRON- could not -PRON- fancy play poker any more with the three boy down the hall 
-PRON- sit at a square table and there be four of -PRON- 
-PRON- may suggest the square 
or the chip may suggest the circle 
a fat man could evoke the circle image 
or even the phrase a squareshooter apply to some man be liable to set -PRON- off 
yet -PRON- need a squareshooter 
-PRON- have to tell someone about this 
that be the way -PRON- do -PRON- in psychiatry wasnot -PRON- 
the old idea of the confessional 
whom could -PRON- trust 
whom could -PRON- tell 
-PRON- would state the case hypothetically of course and get the dope straight 
but whom 
professor bairn 
yes bairn be the logical man 
-PRON- know about all this 
clinton would have to see -PRON- to drop the class anyway 
and perhaps bairn know of a way out 
there have to be a way out at once 
murder could not continue 
-PRON- be go crazy 
-PRON- be all insane and at any minute the torture image may recur to blot out all thought and sanity 
why not go now 
clinton rise and walk swiftly out of the room out of the house down the street to the campus square 
-PRON- be four oclock 
-PRON- have murder sally at twothirty 
-PRON- be an absurd thought 
an hour and a half ago -PRON- have murder a woman 
now -PRON- be go to what be -PRON- go to do 
oh yes see bairn 
good old bairn 
-PRON- would know a way to help 
-PRON- class be over -PRON- would be work in -PRON- office 
the wide office door loom before -PRON- 
-PRON- be very wide 
almost square 
clinton walk in 
bairn be sit at the desk -PRON- square shoulder hunch over oh no think of square 
hello professor think about the square jaw want to talk to -PRON- 
think of something else quick -PRON- do 
oh yes -PRON- have the card out on the desk 
why the card be square 
-PRON- card be square professor be -PRON- say 
the card be square 
professor card be square 
professor bairn teach -PRON- to think of square 
professor bairn will play square with -PRON- 
professor bairn be a square the matter be afraid professor 
professor square no bairn -PRON- s afraid back away 
what do i look like 
what be i do back up to the window 
the window think of the window for sake think of anything but professor bairn be a square 
think of the window 
the window be square 
bairn be back against the open square window 
square against square 
square account 
professor i fall 
twist around 
twist why -PRON- isnot square any more all crumple 
well 
that be easy go 
simple 
now to get rid of that damn circle 
clinton be almost happy as -PRON- slip out the side entrance 
-PRON- walk slowly back to the roominghouse even listen to the newsboy on the corner of hale and jefferson shout about the extra 
reedalla bouta moider 
collichgoilfoundead 
extraaah 
-PRON- didnot buy a paper 
-PRON- know all about the murder 
-PRON- know all about lot of murder 
but what worry -PRON- be that -PRON- didnot know about the next murder 
there have to be one 
there simply have to be one 
-PRON- must get rid of the circle 
then -PRON- would be all right again 
somehow -PRON- realize that these thing be not right but -PRON- be all necessary 
a man couldnot live when -PRON- brain be on fire with incomprehensible image 
this peculiar power of -PRON- this psychic power of guess correctly -PRON- be somehow alien and evil 
poor old bairn have -PRON- actually realize the full extent of the force -PRON- have tamper with 
there be certainly a lot to -PRON- -PRON- hadnot suspect 
must have have -PRON- suspicion though when -PRON- go out the window 
perhaps -PRON- know now 
this stuff be all from across the border 
clinton didnot know and couldnot control -PRON- 
funny idea 
suppose this be really some extrasensory perception of -PRON- this guess faculty -PRON- would develop 
suppose -PRON- be and that -PRON- be not mean for man 
something or some one may guard -PRON- 
or perhaps this faculty merely open up a new part of the mind in such a way that the old mind be unable to govern or control the action of -PRON- augmented self 
there be dark stuff here and clinton didnot want to tamper with -PRON- 
do the murder get rid of the last image forget about -PRON- all erase the circle and be free 
whom to the moonface husband of mrs johnson the landlady 
roger the kid with the shaved head and the round skull 
the circle be the symbol of infinity eternity 
all life be a circle 
curve space 
curve existence 
round 
round and black 
up the stair around to the room 
think deliberately of the circle so that -PRON- may provide a key to the way out 
release the brain 
this would be a plan deliberate murder 
why not 
there be a gun in the drawer 
a gun 
clinton take out the gun fill -PRON- with round cartridge gaze down the round hole in the muzzle 
-PRON- be try hard to think of the person -PRON- mean to kill and strangely no thought come although by this time -PRON- could see the circle quite plainly in -PRON- mind and for the first time -PRON- actually rejoice in the pain 
the blaze circle coruscate swirl round and round and round as -PRON- look down the dark round muzzle of the gun

there be a collection of trophy about the entrance some of -PRON- be not pleasant to look at 
major crosby reflect briefly upon inability to stamp out certain practise 
then -PRON- turn and curtly order -PRON- man to stay outside 
major crosby lift the mat doorway and go inside follow by henley

instantly logoda point furiously at henley and shout -PRON- go way but henley pay no attention 
-PRON- stand under the dry head gaze at -PRON- imperturbably mid furious mouthing and major nervous scrutiny 
suddenly henley catch -PRON- breath and expel -PRON- again with a sharp hissing sound

i will not bother -PRON- again on -PRON- honor 
i want to talk to head and i do not want -PRON- to hear what i say to -PRON- 
the simplicity with which this request be uttered be in strange contrast to the wierdness of -PRON- content 
the major swallow with some difficulty and ask in a thick voice will -PRON- go after that 
yes go then reply henley 
come in the a complete novelet of supernatural power by sway back and forth though no one have touch -PRON-

there in that vast desert know as the cradle of mankind aye even in the heart of the measureless gobi great war be fight and high palace thrust -PRON- minaret up to the purple asian sky 
but this king be long ago beyond the memory of the old sage the splendor of imperial gobi live now only in the dream of minstrel and poet 
the tale of sakhmet the damned 
i the gate oi war gray light of the false dawn the prophet have climb to the outer wall of sardopolis -PRON- beard stream in the chill wind 
before -PRON- stretch across the broad plain be the gay tent and pavilion of the besiege army emblazon with the scarlet symbol of the wyvern the winged dragon beneath which king cyaxare of the north wage -PRON- war 
already soldier be group about the catapult and scalingtower and a knot of -PRON- gather beneath the wall where the prophet a complete novelet of inhuman bondage someone bung a shield 
kialch pan play -PRON- pipe and a rush wind by a uthor of the nresting dead the frog etc roar through the cradle of mankind stand 
mock rough taunt be voice but for a time the whitebearded oldster pay no heed to the gibe 
-PRON- sink eye beneath -PRON- snowy penthouse brow dwelt on the far distance where a forest sweep up into the mountain slope and fade into blue haze 
-PRON- voice come thin piercing 
wo wo unto sardopolis fall be jewel of gobi fall and lose forever and all -PRON- glory go 
desecration shall come to the altar and the street shall run red with blood 
i see death for the king and shame for -PRON- people 
for a time the soldier beneath the wall have be silent but now spear lift -PRON- interrupt with a torrent of halfamused mockery 
a bearded giant roar come down to -PRON- old goat welcome -PRON- indeed prophet eye drop and the shouting of the soldier fade into stillness 
very softly the ancient speak yet each word be clear and distinct as a swordblade 
ye shall ride through the street of the city in triumph 
and -PRON- king shall mount the silver throne 
yet from the forest shall come -PRON- doom an old doom shall come down upon -PRON- and none shall escape 
-PRON- shall return -PRON- the mighty one who dwelt here once 
the prophet lift -PRON- arm stare straight into the red eye of the rise sun 
evoke 
evohe 
then -PRON- step forward 
two step and plunge 
straight down -PRON- beard and robe stream up till the upthrust spear catch -PRON- and -PRON- die 
and that day the gate of sardopolis be burst in by giant batteringram and like an unleashed flood the man of cyaxare pour into the city wolf who slay and plunder and torture mercilessly 
terror walk that day and a haze of battle hang upon the roof 
the defender be hunt down and slaughter in the street without mercy 
woman be outrage -PRON- child impale and the glory of sardopolis fade in a smoke of shame and horror 
the last glow of the set sun touch the scarlet wyvern of cyaxare float from the tall tower of the king palace 
flambeaux be light in -PRON- socket till the great hall blaze with a red fire reflect from the silver throne where the invader sit 
-PRON- black beard be all bespatter with blood and grime and slave groom -PRON- as -PRON- sit among -PRON- man gnaw on a muttonbone 
yet despite the man gash and broken armor and the filth that besmear -PRON- there be something unmistakably regal about -PRON- bearing 
a king son be cyaxare the last of a line that have spring from the dawn age of gobi when the feudal baron have reign 
but -PRON- face be a tragic ruin 
strength and power and nobility have once dwelt there and trace of -PRON- still could be see as though in muddy water through the mask of cruelty and vice that lie heavy upon cyaxare 
-PRON- gray eye hold a cold and passionless stare that vanish only in the crimson blaze of battle and now those deadly eye dwelt on the bind form of the conquer king of sardopolis chalem 
in contrast with the huge figure of cyaxare chalem seem slight yet despite -PRON- wound -PRON- stand stiffly upright no trace of expression on -PRON- pale face 
a strange contrast 
the marbled tapestrie throneroom of the palace be more suitable to gay pageantry than this grim scene 
the only man who do not seem incongruously out of place stand beside the throne a slim dark youth clothe in silk and velvet that have apparently not be mar by the battle 
this be necho the king confidant and some say -PRON- familiar demon 
whence -PRON- have come no one know but of -PRON- evil power over cyaxare there be no doubt a little smile grow on the youth handsome face 
smooth -PRON- curl dark hair -PRON- lean close and whisper to the king 
the latter nodded wave away a maiden who be oil -PRON- beard and say shortly -PRON- power be break chalem yet be -PRON- merciful 
render homage and -PRON- may have -PRON- life 
for answer chalem spat upon the marble flag at -PRON- foot 
a curious gleam come into cyaxare eye 
half inaudibly -PRON- murmur brave man 
too brave to die 
some impulse seem to pull -PRON- head around until -PRON- meet gaze 
a message pass in that si lent staring 
for cyaxare take from -PRON- side a long bloodstaine sword -PRON- rise step down from -PRON- dais and swing the brand make no move to evade the blow 
the steel cut through bone and brain 
as the dead man fall cyaxare stand look down without a trace of expression 
-PRON- wrench -PRON- sword free 
fle this carrion to the vulture -PRON- command 
from the group of prisoner near by come an angry oath 
the king turn to face the man who have dare to speak 
-PRON- gesture 
a pair of guard push forward a tall wellmuscled figure yellowhaire with a face strong despite -PRON- youth now darken with rage 
the man wear no armor and -PRON- torso be crisscross with wound 
who be -PRON- 
cyaxare ask with ominous restraint the sword bare in -PRON- hand 
king son prince raynor 
-PRON- seek death 
raynor shrug 
death have come close to -PRON- today 
slay -PRON- if -PRON- will butcher about a dozen of -PRON- wolf anyway and that s some satisfaction 
behind cyaxare come a rustle of silk as necho move slightly 
the king lip twitch beneath the shaggy beard 
-PRON- face be suddenly hard and cruel again 
so 
well -PRON- will crawl to -PRON- foot before the next sun set 
-PRON- gesture 
no doubt there be torture vault beneath the palace 
sudrach a brawny leather clothe man step forward and salute 
-PRON- have hear -PRON- will 
see to -PRON- 
if i crawl to -PRON- foot raynor say quietly be to hamstre -PRON- bloated toad 
the king draw in -PRON- breath with an angry sound 
without another word -PRON- nod to sudrach and the torturer follow raynor as -PRON- be conduct out 
then cyaxare go back to -PRON- throne and muse for a time till a slave bring -PRON- wine in a gilded chalice 
but the liquor have no power to break -PRON- dark mood 
at last -PRON- rise and go to the dead king apartment which the invader have not dare to plunder for fear of cyaxare wrath 
above the silken couch a gleam image hang from -PRON- standard the scarlet wyvern wing spread barbed tail stiffly upright 
cyaxare stand silently stare at -PRON- for a space 
-PRON- do not turn when -PRON- hear soft voice 
the youth say the wyvern have conquer once again 
aye cyaxare say dully 
once again through vileness and black shame 
-PRON- be an evil day when -PRON- meet necho 
low laughter come 
yet -PRON- summon -PRON- as i remember 
i be content enough in -PRON- own place till -PRON- send -PRON- summon 
involuntarily the king shudder would ishtar have send down -PRON- lightning upon -PRON- that night 
ishtar 
-PRON- worship another god now 
cyaxare swing about snarl 
necho do not push -PRON- too far i have still some power -PRON- have all power the low voice say 
as -PRON- wish 
for a dozen heartbeat the king make no answer 
then -PRON- whisper be the first to bring shame upon -PRON- royal blood 
when i be crown i swear many a vow on the tomb of -PRON- father and for a time i keep those vow 
i rule with truth and chivalry and -PRON- seek wisdom 
aye 
i be not content 
i seek to make -PRON- name great and to that end i talk with sorcerer with bley of the dark pool 
bley necho murmured 
-PRON- be learn in -PRON- way 
yet -PRON- die 
the king breathing be unsteady know 
i slay -PRON- at -PRON- command 
and -PRON- show -PRON- what happen thereafter 
bley be not happy now necho say softly 
-PRON- serve the same master as -PRON- 
wherefore the quiet voice grow imperious 
wherefore live 
for by -PRON- bargain i shall give -PRON- all power on earth fair woman and treasure beyond imagination 
but when -PRON- die -PRON- shall serve -PRON- 
the other stand silent while vein swell on -PRON- swarthy forehead 
suddenly with a bellowing inarticulate oath -PRON- snatch up -PRON- sword 
bright steel flame through the air and rebound clash 
up the king arm and through all -PRON- body race a tingle shock and simultaneously the regal apartment seem to darken around -PRON- 
the fire of the flambeaux darken 
the air be chill and -PRON- whisper 
steadily the room grow black 
now all be midnight black save for a shining figure that stand immobile blaze with weird and unearthly radiance 
little murmur rustle through the deadly stillness 
the body of necho shone brighter blindingly 
and -PRON- stand without move or speak till the king shrink with a shuddering cry -PRON- blade clatter on the marble 
no -PRON- half sob 
for -PRON- mercy no 
-PRON- have no mercy the low voice come bleak and chill 
therefore worship -PRON- dog whom man call king 
worship -PRON- 
and cyaxare worship 
blood in the city be acutely uncomfortable 
-PRON- be stretch upon a rack stare up at the dripping stone of the vault roof and sudrach the torturer be heating iron bar on the hearth 
a great cup of wine stand nearby and occasionally sudrach hum under -PRON- breath would reach for -PRON- and gulp noisily thousand piece of gold if -PRON- help -PRON- escape raynor repeat without much hope 
what good be gord to a flayed man 
sudrach ask 
that would be -PRON- fate if -PRON- escape 
also where would -PRON- get a thousand golden piece 
in -PRON- apartment raynor say 
safely hide 
-PRON- may be lie 
at any rate -PRON- will tell -PRON- where this hiding place be when i burn out -PRON- eye 
thus have the gold if -PRON- exist without danger to -PRON- 
raynor make no answer but instead tug at the cord that bind -PRON- 
-PRON- do not give 
yet raynor strain until blood throb in -PRON- temple and be no close to freedom when -PRON- relax at last but wear -PRON- out sudrach say over -PRON- shoulder 
good save -PRON- strength need -PRON- for scream 
-PRON- take an iron bar from the fire 
-PRON- end glow redly and raynor watch the implement with fascinated horror 
an unpleasant way to die 
but as the glow bar approach chest there come an interruption 
the iron door be fling open and a tall hugemuscle black enter 
sudrach turn involuntarily lift the bar as a weapon 
then -PRON- relax -PRON- eye question 
who the devil be -PRON- -PRON- grunt 
eblik the nubian say the black bowing bear a message from the king 
i lose -PRON- way in this damn palace and just now blundered to -PRON- goal

sudrach rub -PRON- hand 
where be -PRON- 
in the the other step close 
-PRON- fumble in -PRON- belt 
then abruptly a bloodreddened dagger flash up and sheathe -PRON- in flesh 
sudraoh bellow thrust out claw hand 
-PRON- double up slowly while -PRON- attacker leap free and then -PRON- collapse upon the dank stone and lie silent twitch a little 
the god be praise 
raynor grunt 
eblik faithful servant -PRON- come in time dark gargoylish face be worried 
let -PRON- -PRON- slash the cord that bind the prisoner 
-PRON- wasnot easy 
when -PRON- be separate in the battle master i know sardopolis would fall 
i change clothe with one of cyaxare man whom i slay and wait -PRON- chance to escape 
-PRON- be by the mere luck that i hear -PRON- have offend the king and be to be torture 
so -PRON- shrug 
raynor free at last spring up from the rack stretch -PRON- stiffen muscle 
will -PRON- be easy to escape perhaps 
many be drunk or asleep 
at any rate -PRON- canot stay here 
the two slip cautiously out into the corridor 
a guard lie dead welter in -PRON- blood not far away 
-PRON- hurry past -PRON- and silently thread -PRON- way through the palace more than once dodge into passage to evade detection 
if i know where cyaxare sleep take -PRON- chance on slit -PRON- throat raynor say 
wait 
this way at the end of a narrow hall be a door which push open show a moonlit expanse of garden 
eblik say remember i enter this way 
here -PRON- dive into a bush and presently emerge with a sword and a heavy battleax the latter -PRON- thrust in -PRON- girdle 
what now 
over the wall raynor say and lead the way 
the high rampart be not easy to scale but a spread tree grow close to -PRON- and eventually the two have surmount the barrier 
as raynor drop lightly to the ground -PRON- hear a sudden cry and glance around see a group of man armor gleam in the moonlight race toward -PRON- 
-PRON- curse softly 
eblik be already flee -PRON- long leg cover the yard with amazing speed 
raynor follow though -PRON- first impulse be to wait and give battle 
but in the stronghold of cyaxare such an action would have be suicidal 
behind the pair the pursuer bay menace 
sword come out flash 
raynor clutch -PRON- comrade arm drag -PRON- into a side alley and the two speed on frantically search for a hidingplace 
-PRON- be eblik who find sanctuary five minute later 
pass the bloodsmeare corpselittere courtyard of a temple -PRON- gasp a hasty word and in a moment both raynor and eblik be across the moonlit stretch and flee into the interior of the temple 
from a high roof hang a golden ball dim in the gloom 
this be the sacred house of the sun the dwelling place of the primal god ahmon 
eblik have be here before and know the way 
-PRON- guide raynor past tear tapestry and overthrow censer and then halt before a golden curtain -PRON- listen 
there be no sound of pursuit 
good the nubian warrior say hear of a secret way out of here though where -PRON- be i donot know 
maybe -PRON- can find -PRON- draw the curtain aside and the two enter the sanctuary of the god 
involuntarily raynor whisper a curse and -PRON- brown finger tighten on -PRON- rapier hilt 
a small chamber face -PRON- with wall and floor and ceiling blue as the summer sky 
-PRON- be empty save for a single huge sphere of gold in the center 
break upon the gleam ball be a man 
from the wall a single flambeau cast a flickering radiance on the twisted bloodstaine body on the white beard that be dapple with blood 
the man lie stretch across the globe -PRON- hand and foot impale with iron spike that have be drive deeply into the gold 
froth bubble on -PRON- lip 
-PRON- hoary head roll eye stare unseeingly 
-PRON- gasp water 
for the love of ahmon a drop of water lip be a hard white line as -PRON- spring forward 
eblik help -PRON- as -PRON- pry the spike free 
the tortured priest moan and bit at -PRON- mangle lip but make no outcry 
presently -PRON- lie prostrate on the blue floor 
with a muttered word eblik disappear and come back bear a cup which -PRON- hold to the die man mouth 
the priest drink deeply 
-PRON- whisper prince raynor

a steep staircase lead down into hide depth 
the altar be open 
i can not see take -PRON- down there 
-PRON- can not find -PRON- in the hidden chamber 
raynor swing the priest to -PRON- shoulder and without hesitation start down the step eblik behind -PRON- 
there be a low grating as the altar swing back a gleam sphere that would halt and baffle pursuit 
-PRON- be in utter darkness 
the prince move cautiously test each step before -PRON- shift -PRON- weight 
at last -PRON- feel the floor level beneath -PRON- foot a dim light begin to grow like the first glow of dawn 
-PRON- revealedi a bare stone vault roughly construct of mortised stone strangely at variance with the palatial city above 
in one wall a dark hole show 
on the floor be a circular disk of metal -PRON- center hollow out into a cup 
within this cup lie a broken shard of some rock that resemble goldshot marble half as large as hand 
on the shard be carve certain symbol the prince do not recognize and one that -PRON- do the ancient loop cross sacred to the sungod 
-PRON- put the priest down gently but nevertheless the man moan in agony 
the maim hand clutch at air

-PRON- must be the messenger of vengeance 
not i have not long to live 
-PRON- strength ebb 
-PRON- be silent for a time and then resume have a tale to tell -PRON- 
do -PRON- know the legend of the founding of sardopolis 
how long ago a very terrible god have -PRON- altar in this spot and be serve by all the forest dweller till those who serve ahmon come 
-PRON- fight and prisone the forest god drive -PRON- hence to the valley of silence and -PRON- lie bind there by strong magic and the seal of ahmon 
yet there be a prophecy that one day ahmon would be overthrow and the bound god would break -PRON- fetter and return to -PRON- first dwelling place to the ruin of sardopolis 
the day of the prophecy be at hand 
the priest point

beneath be nothing but a jagged stone crudely carve with archaic figure and symbol 
a stone yet raynor know somehow that the thing be horribly old that -PRON- have exist from the dawn age of gobi 
the altar of the forest god say the priest 
-PRON- will return to this spot when -PRON- be free 
-PRON- must go to the reaver of the rock and give -PRON- the talisman 
-PRON- will know -PRON- meaning

suddenly the priest surge upright -PRON- arm lift tear stream from the blind eye 
-PRON- cry ohe ohi

fall to the dust 
-PRON- fall as a tree fall crash down upon the stone -PRON- arm still extend as though in worship 
so die the last priest of ahmon in gobi 
raynor do not move for a while 
then -PRON- bend over the lax body 
a hasty examination show -PRON- that the man be dead and shrug -PRON- thrust the marble shard into -PRON- belt suppose that s the way out -PRON- say point to the gap in the wall though i donot like the look of -PRON- 
well come on 
-PRON- squeeze -PRON- into the narrow hole curse softly and eblik follow 
the reaver of the rock slow step cyaxare pace -PRON- apartment -PRON- shaggy brow draw together in a frown 
once or twice -PRON- hand close convulsively on -PRON- swordhilt and again the secret agony within -PRON- make -PRON- groan aloud 
but not once do -PRON- glance at the scarlet symbol of the wyvern that hang above -PRON- couch 
go to a window -PRON- look down over the city and then -PRON- gaze go out to the plain and the distant forest mountain 
-PRON- sigh heavily 
a voice say -PRON- may well look there cyaxare 
for there be -PRON- doom unless -PRON- act swiftly 
be -PRON- -PRON- necho the king ask heavily 
what new shamefulness must i work now

-PRON- must be slay ere -PRON- reach -PRON- 
why 
what aid can -PRON- get there 
nccho do not answer at first 
-PRON- voice be hesitant when -PRON- say the god have -PRON- own secret 
there be something in the valley of silence that can send all -PRON- glory and power crash down about -PRON- head 
nor can i aid -PRON- then 
i can only advise -PRON- now and if -PRON- follow -PRON- advice well 
but act i can not and must not for a reason which -PRON- need not know 
send out -PRON- man therefore with order to overtake those two and slay -PRON- swiftly as -PRON- will the king say and turn to summon a servitor follow -PRON- eblik say shade -PRON- eye with a calloused hand 
-PRON- be astride a rangy dun mare and beside -PRON- raynor rede on a great gray charger red of nostril and fiery of eye 
the latter turn in the saddle and look back 
by the god -PRON- observe 
cyaxare have send half an army after -PRON- lucky -PRON- manage to steal these mount 
the two have rein -PRON- horse at the summit of a low rise in the forest 
back of -PRON- the ground slope to the great plain and the gutted city of 
sardopolis before -PRON- jag mountain rise cover with oak and pine and fir 
the nubian lick dry lip say thirstily the fire of all hell be in -PRON- belly get out of this wilderness where there s nothing to drink but water 
the reaver may feed -PRON- wine or blood raynor say nevertheless -PRON- good chance be to find this reaver and seek -PRON- aid 
a mercenary once tell -PRON- of the road 
-PRON- clap -PRON- heel against the charger flank and the steed bound forward 
in a moment the ridge have hide -PRON- from the man of cyaxare 
so the two penetrate deeper and deep into the craggy desolate wilderness a place haunt by wolf and great bear and man whisper monstrous snakelike cockadrill 
-PRON- go by snowpeake mountain that lift white cone to the blue sky and -PRON- flee along the brink of deep gorge from which the low thunder of cataract rise tumultuously 
and always behind -PRON- ride the pursuer a grim and warlike company follow slowly but relentlessly 
but raynor use more than one stratagem 
thrice -PRON- guide -PRON- charger up stream along which the wise animal pick -PRON- way carefully again -PRON- dislodge an avalanche to block the trail 
so -PRON- come about that when the two ride down into a great grassy basin the man of cyaxare be far behind 
on all side the mountain rise 
ahead be a broad meadowlike valley strew with thicket and green grove 
far ahead the precipice rise in a tall rampart split in one place into a narrow canyon 
to the right of the gorge lift a great gray rock mountainhuge bare save for a winding trail that twist up -PRON- surface to a castle upon the summit 
dwarf by distance the size of the huge structure could yet be appreciate a castle of stone incongruously bedeck with flutter bright banner and pennon 
raynor point

so -PRON- take raynor before the reaver of the rock 
a great shine redcheeked man -PRON- be with grizzle gray beard and a crown set rakishly askew on tangled lock

raynor be curiously eye the girl 
-PRON- face be pale beneath -PRON- tan and -PRON- eye betray fear 
red battle -PRON- could face unflinchingly but the thought of enter the valley of silence mean to -PRON- something far more terrible 
yet -PRON- say come 
-PRON- have little time 
eblik follow raynor and delphia from the hall 
-PRON- go through the harsh splendor of the castle till at last the girl halt before a blank stone wall 
-PRON- press a hidden spring 
a section of the rock swing away reveal the dimlit depth of a passage 
delphia pause on the threshold 
-PRON- dark eye flicker over the two 
hold fast to -PRON- courage -PRON- whisper and -PRON- hps be tremble 
for now -PRON- go down into the valley of silence at first there seem nothing terrible about the valley 
-PRON- enter -PRON- from a cavern that open on a thick forest and glance around raynor see tall mountainous rampart that make the place a prison indeed 
-PRON- be past sunset yet already a full moon be rise over the eastern cliff outline the castle in black silhouette 
-PRON- enter the forest 
moss underfoot deaden -PRON- footstep 
-PRON- walk in dim gloom break by moonlit tracery filter through the leave 
and now raynor note the curious stillness that hang over all 
there be no sound 
the noise of bird and beast do not exist here nor do the breath of wind rustle the silent tree 
but queerly the prince think there be a sound whisper through the forest a sound below the threshold of hearing which nevertheless play on -PRON- taut nerve donot like this eblik say -PRON- ugly face set and strained 
-PRON- voice seem to die away with uncanny swiftness 
pan be fetter here delphia whisper 
yet be -PRON- power manifest 
soundlessly -PRON- go through the soundless forest 
and now raynor realize that slowly and imperceptibly the shadowy whisper -PRON- have sense be grow louder or else -PRON- ear be become more attuned to -PRON- 
a very dim murmur faint and far away which yet seem to have within -PRON- a multitude of voice 
the voice of the wind the murmur of forest the goblin laughter of shadow brook 
-PRON- be loud now and raynor find -PRON- think of all the innumerable sound of the primeval wilderness and the call of beast 
and under all a dim powerful motif beat a wordless shrill a faint piping that set the prince skin to crawling as -PRON- hear -PRON- 
-PRON- be the tide of life delphia say softly 
the heartbeat of the first god 
the pulse of earth 
for the first time raynor feel something of the primal secret of the world 
often -PRON- have walk alone in the forest but never yet have the hide heart of the wilderness reach finger into -PRON- soul 
-PRON- sense a mighty and very terrible power stir latent in the soil beneath -PRON- a thing bind inextricably to the brain of man by the cord of the flesh which come up by slow degree from the seething ocean which once roll unchecked over a young planet 
unimaginable eon ago man have come from the earth and the brand of -PRON- motherworld be burn deep within -PRON- soul 
afraid yet strangely happy as man be sometimes happy in -PRON- dream the prince motion for -PRON- companion to increase -PRON- pace 
the forest give place to a wide clearing with shatter white stone rear to the sky 
break plinth and peristyle gleam in the moonlight 
a temple have once exist here 
now all be overgrow with moss and the slowcreepe lichen 
here the girl say in a low whisper 
here 
in the center of a ring of fall pillar -PRON- halt 
delphia point to a block of marble on which a metal disk be inset 
in a cuplike depression in the metal lie a broken bit of marble 
the talisman delphia say

silence and the unearthly tide of hidden life swell and ebb all about -PRON- 
raynor take the amulet from -PRON- belt step forward fight down -PRON- fear 
-PRON- bend above the disk touch marble shard to marble as iron to lodes tone the two fragment draw together 
-PRON- coalesce into one 
the jagged line of breakage fade and vanish 
raynor hold the talisman complete unbroken 
now quite suddenly the vague murmuring mount into a roar gay jubilant triumphant 
the metal disk shatter into fragment 
beneath -PRON- the prince glimpse a small carve stone the twin of the one beneath the temple of ahmon 
above the unceasing roar sound a penetrating shrill pipe 
delphia clutch at raynor arm pull -PRON- back

back quickly 
to see pan be to die 
louder the roar mount and loud

the wind exult free free 
and the unseen river shout great pan be free of hoof come from the distance 
bleating call sound from afar 
the girl stumble almost fall 
raynor grip at -PRON- arm pull -PRON- upright fight the unreasoning terror mount within -PRON- 
the grim face be glisten with sweat 
pan pan be free 
evohe 
the black mouth of a cavern loom before -PRON- 
at -PRON- threshold raynor cast a glance behind -PRON- see all the great forest swaying and tossing 
-PRON- breath come unevenly -PRON- turn follow -PRON- companion into the cave 
shaitan -PRON- whisper 
what demon have i loose on the land 
then -PRON- be race sprint pound up the winding passage up an unending flight of stone step through a wall that lift at touch and into a castle shake with battle 
raynor stop short whip out -PRON- sword staring at shadow flicker in the distance 
cyaxare man -PRON- say enter 
in the face of antagonist the prince be suddenly -PRON- again

-PRON- blade and the ax wreak deadly havoc among cyaxare soldier who not expect attack from the rear be confused 
the hall become fill with a milling yell throng from which one soldier a burly giant emerge shout down the other 
cut -PRON- down but three 
then all semblance of sanity be lose in a blaze of crimson battle swinge brand and huge mace that crash down splitting skull and spatter gray brainstuff 
delphia keep shoulder to shoulder with raynor seemingly heedless of danger -PRON- blade flick wasplike through the air 
and the prince guard -PRON- as best -PRON- could the sword weave a bright maze of deadly lightning as -PRON- whirl 
the reaver swung and -PRON- sword crush a helm and bite deep into bone 
-PRON- strain to tug -PRON- free and a soldier thrust up at -PRON- throat 
samar deflect the blade with -PRON- own weapon and that cost -PRON- -PRON- life 
in that moment of inattention a drive spear smash through corselet and jerkin and drink deep of the man lifeblood 
silent -PRON- fall 
the reaver go beserk

for a few moment -PRON- hold back -PRON- enemy and then someone fling a shield 
instinctively kialeh lift -PRON- blade to parry

the three stand together now the last of the defender raynor and eblik and delphia 
the soldier ring -PRON- pant for -PRON- death yet hesitate before the menace of cold steel 
none wish to be the first to die 
and as -PRON- wait a little silence fall 
the prince hear a sound -PRON- remember 
dim and far away a low roaring drift to -PRON- ear 
and the eerie shrilling of pipe 
-PRON- grow loud 
the soldier hear -PRON- now 
-PRON- glance at one another askance 
there be something about that sound that chill the blood 
-PRON- swell to a gleeful shouting fill all the castle

there come the clatter of ring little hoof 
the castle rock and shudder 
some vague indefinable impulse make raynor snatch at -PRON- belt grip the talisman in bronzed finger 
from -PRON- a grateful warmth seem to flow into -PRON- flesh and the roaring fade 
-PRON- drag delphia and the nubian behind -PRON- 
close to -PRON- stay close 
the room be darken 
no -PRON- seem as though a cloudy veil of mist drop before the three guard -PRON- 
raynor lift the seal of ahmon 
the fogveil swirl 
dimly through -PRON- raynor could see the soldier move swiftly frantically like rat catch in a trap 
-PRON- tighten one arm about steelarmored waist

the castle shake as though grip by titan hand 
the floor sway beneath the prince foot 
the mist darken 
through rift -PRON- see halfguesse figure that leap and bound hear elfin hoof click 
horn and shaggyfurre being that cry jubilantly as -PRON- dance to the pipe of pan 
faun and dryad and satyr swing in a mad saraband beyond the shrouding mist 
faintly there come the screaming of man half drown in the loud shrilling 
evohe the demoniac rout thunder 
evohe 
all hail pan 
with a queer certainty raynor know that -PRON- be time to leave the castle and swiftly 
already the great stone structure be shake like a tree in a hurricane 
with a word to -PRON- companion -PRON- step forward hesitantly the talisman hold high 
the wall of mist move with -PRON- 
outside the fogwall the monstrous figure gambol 
but the soldier of cyaxare scream no more 
through a castle toppling into ruin the three speed into the courtyard across the drawbridge and down the face of the rock 
nor do -PRON- pause till -PRON- be safely in the broad plain of the valley 
the castle 
eblik barked pointing 
see 
-PRON- fall 
and -PRON- be true 
down -PRON- come thundering while cloud of ruin spurt up 
then there be only a shatter wreck on the summit of the rock 
delphia catch -PRON- breath in a little sob 
-PRON- murmur the end of the reaver for all time 
i i live in the castle for more than twenty year 
and now -PRON- go like a puff of dust before the wind 
the wall of fog have vanish 
raynor return the talisman to -PRON- belt 
eblik staring up at the rock swallow uneasily 
well what now -PRON- ask

all three rein in -PRON- mount stare 
beneath -PRON- lie the city but change -PRON- be a ruin 
doom have come to sardopolis in the night 
the mighty tower and battlement have fall and huge gap be open in the wall 
of the king palace nothing be leave but a single tower from which ironically the wyvern banner fly 
as -PRON- watch that pinnacle too sway and totter and fall and the scarlet wyvern drift down into the dust of sardopolis 
on fall tower and peristyle distant figure move with odd ungainly bounding 
quickly raynor turn -PRON- eye away

pan rule 
i go with -PRON- 
the three rode to the west 
-PRON- skirt but do not enter a small grove where a man lie in agony 
-PRON- be cyaxare a figure so dreadfully mangle that only sheer will keep -PRON- alive 
-PRON- face be a bloody mask 
the oncerich garment be tattere and filthy 
-PRON- see the three rider and raise -PRON- voice in a weak cry which the wind drown 
beside the king a slim youthful figure lounge lean idly against an oaktrunk 
-PRON- be necho 
call loud cyaxare -PRON- say 
with a horse under -PRON- -PRON- can reach the sea of shadow 
and if -PRON- succeed in do that -PRON- will yet live for many year 
again the king cry out 
the wind take -PRON- voice and shred -PRON- to impotent fragment 
necho laugh softly 
too late now 
-PRON- be go let -PRON- batter head drop -PRON- beard trail in the dirt 
through shred lip -PRON- mutter if i reach the sea of shadow i live 
true 
but if -PRON- do not -PRON- die 
and then low laughter shake the other 
groan the king drag -PRON- forward 
necho follow good horse can reach the sea of shadow in three day 
if -PRON- walk swiftly -PRON- may reach -PRON- in six 
but -PRON- must hurry 
why do -PRON- not rise -PRON- cyaxare 
the king spit out bitter oath 
in agony -PRON- pull -PRON- forward leave a trail of blood on the grass blood that drip unceasingly from the twin raw stump just above -PRON- ankle 
the stone that fall upon -PRON- be sharp 
cyaxare be -PRON- not 
necho mock 
but hurry 
-PRON- have little time 
there be mountain to climb and river to cross 
so in the trail of raynor and eblik and delphia creep the die king hear fainter and ever fainter the triumphant pipe of pan from sardopolis 
and presently patient as the silent necho a vulture dip against the blue and take up the pursuit the beat of -PRON- wing distinctly audible in the heavy stagnant silence 
and raynor and delphia and eblik ride onward toward the sea 
a story of whisper coffin by in the next issue of collejc humor moncati be positive until -PRON- develop the fatal negative 
by author oi the lose wraith house o darkness etc give -PRON- the packet without question and moncati stand politely listen to -PRON- -PRON- head cock a little to one side 
-PRON- bright dark eye be smile coldly but -PRON- thin lip remain devoid of any movement confess have be afraid of -PRON- stepfather -PRON- say wemyss 
there be some very strange story about -PRON- and the man -PRON- always impress -PRON- as something evil 
wemyss cough nervously and cast a glance over -PRON- shoulder to where -PRON- law partner be at work on a brief 
belatedly lower -PRON- voice -PRON- add admire -PRON- fearlessness moncati 
thank -PRON- say moncati and leave -PRON- 
outside -PRON- lip smile and -PRON- say within -PRON- mind wemys -PRON- have the secret 
-PRON- hand tighten a little about the packet and the photograph in -PRON- 
this kind of blackmail would never have occur to wemyss 
the second print be authentic but the frame photograph have change again in the night 
as -PRON- walk through piccadilly in the sunlight so unusual for london moncati hold -PRON- smile and -PRON- thought dwelt upon the photograph and the occasion upon which -PRON- have take -PRON- 
about -PRON- stepfather wemyss have put -PRON- mildly indeed 
moncati -PRON- have hear the old man boast be the lord of evil 
proudly 
sure of -PRON- 
moncati remember -PRON- well and have reason to believe -PRON- on natural ground 
wemyss have not be wrong when -PRON- have warn -PRON- that the old man have an eye on the legacy come to moncati at twentyfive dabbling in photography have save -PRON- life just as teddifer -PRON- stepfather be prepare to leap upon -PRON- finger already curve for -PRON- throat the flashlight bulb have go off 
moncati have rise from -PRON- simulate sleep thrust teddifer away and go with the camera and film 
-PRON- remember yet the fury and chagrin on the old man face when -PRON- have learn about elaborate precaution but -PRON- remember too that already then -PRON- have know that some day -PRON- would have to take other step pause to tear into little piece the letter that have be with the packet for wemyss which begin in case of -PRON- death please forward immediately to inspector winslow at new scotland yard and go on chuckle to -PRON- now lighthearte and gay with eye for every pretty girl -PRON- meet 
deep in -PRON- mind -PRON- be well satisfied with -PRON- as proud as old teddifer have ever be of -PRON- magic and necromancy and not a little scornful of the evil old man who have come to such a prosaic and untimely end 
moncati feel not a qualm at remember how carefully -PRON- have tie the cord which have trip teddifer at the head of the stair and leave -PRON- at the bottom with -PRON- scrawny neck break 
after all moncati have have every provocation -PRON- have know that by some design or other teddifer have mean to accomplish -PRON- death and take -PRON- legacy and the thought have irritate and at last have worry -PRON- into action 
if a fly bother -PRON- i kill -PRON- -PRON- have tell -PRON- then 
why hot teddifer 
when moncati reach home -PRON- unpack the enlarged photograph find a frame and hang the picture on the wall squarely over -PRON- desk so that -PRON- may remind -PRON- from time to time of -PRON- own cleverness in circumvent the evil old man who have be -PRON- stepfather 
-PRON- have already burn up most of book and paper and have begin to rearrange the house to suit -PRON- own convenience 
-PRON- go whistle up the stair and leave the picture there in the patch of sunlight on the wall the evilface old man with head half turn toward the hidden camera and the flare that have surprise -PRON- moncati -PRON- in bed the glare of light that make strikingly clear the huge cruel old hand and the design mind behind 
the sunlight be additionally merciless and there the picture hang moncati in bed and hercule teddifer about to reach for -PRON- neck 
for some day the picture comfort moncati -PRON- give -PRON- a deepseate feeling of contentment of satisfaction with -PRON- and the world and -PRON- glance at -PRON- smile once or twice a day 
then -PRON- go down to sussex for a weekend and when -PRON- come back -PRON- feel for the first time a disquieting note about the picture 
-PRON- be something intangible something upon which -PRON- could not put a finger but -PRON- be there 
the photograph give -PRON- the old pleasure and satisfaction but there be something more something malevolent about -PRON- and -PRON- be irritated to think -PRON- do not know what -PRON- be 
for a brief moment -PRON- think that the old man expression have subtly alter become more calculating but be careful about -PRON- imagination -PRON- dismiss the thought 
two evening later as -PRON- sit at -PRON- desk write a difficult letter -PRON- glance absently up at the graph and see a movement there 
because the indirect light throw a diffuse glow over the picture -PRON- think at first that the movement -PRON- have see be a normal hallucination spring from the slight refocusing of -PRON- gaze from paper to photograph but almost instantly -PRON- eye fix unconsciously upon the spot where -PRON- have think the movement to have be hercule hand 
with a faint tremor -PRON- know that -PRON- have see the old man large bony hand flex open and close and -PRON- involuntarily wait fascinate for the hand to move again 
but only for a second 
-PRON- recollect -PRON- and turn the light full upon the photograph a faint feeling of panic guide -PRON- hand 
-PRON- look at -PRON- closely but nothing happen there be nothing change about -PRON- and -PRON- suffer a brief moment of distaste before -PRON- feel the old pleasure creep over -PRON- again the sense of proud security -PRON- have make for -PRON- by so fortunately rid -PRON- of -PRON- menacing stepfather 
-PRON- sit down again presently and resume the letter but every little while -PRON- catch -PRON- look expectantly up at the photograph watch nervously and uncertainly so that in the end -PRON- be oblige to give up the letter somehow -PRON- mind would not return to -PRON- would not concentrate properly on the task before -PRON- 
with a faintly derisive smile half for -PRON- half for the photograph -PRON- leave the desk 
-PRON- have no doubt that -PRON- eye have play a trick on -PRON- and -PRON- sleep well that night without dream 
-PRON- rise in the morning get at -PRON- letter again and finish -PRON- without any trouble 
on -PRON- way out of the house to the victoria and albert museum -PRON- give the photograph a fleeting glance with -PRON- customary good humor and go whistle into the morning fog 
not until -PRON- be seat comfortably in the underground do -PRON- occur to -PRON- that hercule face as -PRON- have see -PRON- in the photograph that morning be no longer turn toward the hidden camera 
-PRON- have not actually realize -PRON- at first but -PRON- eye have see the image have be transmit and now suddenly -PRON- remember -PRON- with a certain definiteness which -PRON- find difficult to escape 
the possibility of any physical change in the photograph be too absurd to entertain seriously -PRON- begin to think very clearly around what -PRON- eye have see in an attempt to find some explanation of -PRON- 
but the more -PRON- think the great -PRON- confusion grow until -PRON- know that -PRON- must return to the house and assure -PRON- that such a change have not actually take place 
-PRON- make a mental note at the same time to see about -PRON- eye glass certainly be indicate let -PRON- in the house with trepidation and go directly to the picture 
-PRON- look and look again step back a little and stare -PRON- mind in outraged tumult 
there be a change 
the old man face no longer peer out at -PRON- instead -PRON- have turn ever so slightly and take new cognizance of the figure in the bed the head bend a little and the eye lose in contemplation 
-PRON- be incredible but -PRON- be true 
moncati take the photograph off -PRON- hook and peer closely at -PRON- 
-PRON- rub -PRON- finger over -PRON- as if be may feel some subtle difference -PRON- eye could not see but there be nothing 
baffle -PRON- put -PRON- back and stand look at -PRON- for a long time until -PRON- become conscious of the fact that -PRON- be wait for change to take place there before -PRON- eye 
then angry with -PRON- -PRON- turn away and go grimly out of the house intend to complete the day itinerary as -PRON- have set -PRON- for -PRON- 
but somehow before -PRON- know -PRON- the museum pal on -PRON- and -PRON- find -PRON- sit down to tea with old wemyss who eye -PRON- a little askance 
investment trouble ask the barrister 
moncati shake -PRON- head 
no dan48 ger of that just develop some curiosity about -PRON- late stepfather 
wemys put on -PRON- pincenez and look at -PRON- 
god bless -PRON- soul -PRON- exclaim put -PRON- in mind of -PRON- now dead and the world the well for -PRON- -PRON- particularly 
moncati smile -PRON- most persuasive smile 
agree mr wemyss but i have a reasonable amount of curiosity and rather like to know something of the nature of those strange story about which -PRON- hint the last time i call on -PRON- 
wemys eye narrow 
what misguided impulse rouse -PRON- curiosity -PRON- ask 
moncati shrug 
be -PRON- misguided hesitate to talk about thing i donot -PRON- understand and yet must put some belief in reply wemyss because i dislike be hold up to ridicule even if only in the private opinion of -PRON- client 
i donot suppose -PRON- believe in such thing as magic and sorcery eh 
moncati smile pleasantly and say 
only a fool refuse to keep an open mind 
well say answer wemyss shortly 
teddifer practise that sort of thing square and circle and spirit rite and such 
i donot hold with -PRON- -PRON- but i understand that some very unusual occurrence take place in that house of -PRON- 
wemys shrug a little irritated but go on 
the good i can say be that some people die very oddly servant 
two that i know of 
both strangle 
but of course -PRON- stepfather be out of the city at the time 
no question about that 
wemyss smile a little oddly with a kind of menace behind -PRON- lip 
-PRON- have some queer theory about the projection of psychic double and astral and the like for that matter no one ever find any print of any kind on those two dead servant 
of a sudden wemyss gulp -PRON- tea and be off say over -PRON- shoulder god bless -PRON- soul forget -PRON- appointment with dotson 
moncati wave at -PRON- back but -PRON- be puzzle the inference behind wemyss word be clear enough and somehow moncati could not get -PRON- thought away from hercule huge ungainly hand the tough clawlike appendage that have so greedily threaten -PRON- own throat 
-PRON- shake -PRON- presently pay for the tea and wander somewhat relunctantly homeward look at the picture but there be no further change 
-PRON- be conscious of a slight feeling of relief but this be dissipate at once in the memory of that first change 
-PRON- take the photograph down again and examine -PRON- anew but could discover nothing remarkable about -PRON- 
for the first time -PRON- begin to be aware of something akin to fear -PRON- begin to search -PRON- memory for some clue to this strange occurrence and at the same time -PRON- begin to cast around for some manner of escape from the intangible dread -PRON- have beun to feel insidiously draw upon -PRON- from the recess of -PRON- mind a malignant dread akin to that same fear -PRON- have know when first -PRON- have become aware of -PRON- stepfather evil design to kill -PRON- 
doggedly -PRON- put the picture back on the wall and go about -PRON- small task 
by evening -PRON- have sufficiently recover -PRON- composure to contemplate coolly some mean of combat the subtle dread that lie in the back of -PRON- mind 
-PRON- could not refrain from look at the picture again but there be no further change and -PRON- feel a renewal of faith in -PRON- 
-PRON- have think once fleetingly of burn the picture but this seem to -PRON- somehow a reflection upon the resourcefulness and courage that have bring -PRON- into being and -PRON- could not contemplate with equanimity the resultant drain upon -PRON- selfesteem 
throughout the evening -PRON- sit in the room read -PRON- desk light throw upward upon the picture but nothing happen nothing whatever 
-PRON- have come almost to expect some further development but this absence of anything again set -PRON- doubt what -PRON- have first see 
have there be any change in the first place 
or have -PRON- imagination overreach -PRON- 
certain as -PRON- be that the old man have first be look out at -PRON- from the photograph -PRON- be equally certain that -PRON- be now no longer do so but if this change have indeed take place -PRON- be utterly against natural law 
this thought give -PRON- but little comfort until -PRON- realize that -PRON- could settle the question of whether or not -PRON- imagination have be remiss by take the negative and have a separate print make for comparison 
at once -PRON- be flood with a strange feeling of freedom from dread -PRON- feel that -PRON- be about to do the right thing 
the possibility that -PRON- confidence do not come entirely from within -PRON- do not occur to -PRON- 
in the morning -PRON- take the negative and make a second print enlarge to the same size as the original 
-PRON- come to -PRON- desk with -PRON- and stand -PRON- up below the frame photograph 
what -PRON- see be so far from reassure that -PRON- catch hold of a chair and ease -PRON- into -PRON- 
not only be the second print as -PRON- have originally believe the frame photograph to have be but the latter have again change in the night hercule teddifer have move closer to the figure in the bed and -PRON- hand be clench 
moncati begin to perspire coldly 
for a moment -PRON- sit there at a loss to know what to do and -PRON- think confusedly of the old man strange belief 
somehow -PRON- have not before occur to -PRON- that by photograph the old man -PRON- have manage however obscurely to -PRON- to perpetuate teddifer and -PRON- evil design 
but in the height of -PRON- misery hope come to -PRON- 
-PRON- come to -PRON- foot and in two stride have tear the photograph from the wall 
three minute later all that be leave be a small drift of ashe 
-PRON- be utterly relieve at once 
how the old man could have manage recourse to -PRON- magic sorcery in this way be beyond moncati but the knowledge that -PRON- have circumvent -PRON- a second time be not 
-PRON- opinion of -PRON- soar 
-PRON- go out to celebrate 
-PRON- make a night of -PRON- hilariously tell some acquaintance that -PRON- be celebrate -PRON- freedom and congratulate -PRON- upon shake off the dread -PRON- have know so briefly again 
-PRON- come in late after midnight -PRON- mind a little sluggish and throw -PRON- partly dressed on to -PRON- bed where -PRON- fall asleep at once 
not quite an hour later -PRON- awake 
the clock have strike two and -PRON- lie drowsily stare into the darkness for some minute before -PRON- hear the sound like the rattle and rustling of paper 
even at that -PRON- do not come fully awake -PRON- ponder the sound sleepily and be not aware of -PRON- approach until -PRON- be almost upon -PRON- room -PRON- listen carefully wonder what -PRON- may be 
-PRON- be like nothing -PRON- have ever hear before save for -PRON- dry rustling and crackling 
-PRON- raise -PRON- tiredly on one elbow just as the door of -PRON- room open 
this distract -PRON- momentarily from the sound of movement and -PRON- think a draft have draw -PRON- open for at the moment there be nothing but darkness flow in upon -PRON- 
not until an uncanny chill pervade -PRON- sense do -PRON- realize that the darkness -PRON- see be not the shadow in the hall but that -PRON- be something alive something malignant 
instantly -PRON- be catch in a cloud of dread -PRON- see the darkness resolve -PRON- into a dim human figure one side aglow as if a light be fall upon -PRON- and hear a dry chuckling all too familiar 
-PRON- be hercule grim face that look down upon -PRON- 
even as an outcry rise to lip the ungainly hand close around -PRON- neck 
the last thing moncati remember be the thing -PRON- have unfortunately forget the second print from the a complete novelet of matter over mind i 
by author of the undead the mechanical man etc i the empty cube i with chatham when -PRON- discover the box and i can still remember -PRON- cry of delight and surprise when -PRON- unearth -PRON- 
-PRON- have be do a bit of fossil hunt on a piece of land of -PRON- in southeastern pennsylvania where a spur of primal rock strata rear -PRON- head practically to the surface 
so far -PRON- have find little more than the usual fossil shell and a few fern impression so batter by time that -PRON- be practically worthless 
but this be different 
at -PRON- shout i leave -PRON- own dig a little distance away and join -PRON- 
-PRON- be stand over what look like a pocket in the solid rock form by some freak folding of the strata back in preglacial time 
look wilder -PRON- exclaim -PRON- be hollow but not empty nothing jubilantly be try to chip off this upper layer when -PRON- pick go straight through 
what do -PRON- make of -PRON- 
i get down on -PRON- hand and knee and peer into the opening -PRON- have make 
i see what -PRON- be rave about 
the pocket extend a foot or two in all direction beyond the opening and about four foot downward 
and rest flat upon -PRON- bottom be a rectangular shape object 
what the dicken 
i exclaim and begin to pry away piece of the loose rock with -PRON- hand 
what be -PRON- 
-PRON- get down beside -PRON- 
look as though -PRON- may be manmade doesnot -PRON- 
nature doesnot work in such perfect cube donot know i reply in -PRON- but nothing wassomethe fully although the same idea have flash across -PRON- own mind 
there be certain slate formation but this isnot slate -PRON- interrupt 
-PRON- pick up a shard of the dull color rock igneous stuff 
much old than slate 
but later than the surround rock apparently i say 
i scramble to -PRON- foot enlarge the opening and see what -PRON- have find 
a few blow of -PRON- pick clear away the top of the pocket give -PRON- an unobstructed view into the cavity beneath 
-PRON- now measure about four foot in all of -PRON- dimension with the two foot cube rest upon the middle of -PRON- floor drop in and pass -PRON- out to -PRON- chatham say 
then -PRON- can examine -PRON- better 
think -PRON- can manage -PRON- alone 
i ask 
-PRON- look as though -PRON- be make of solid metal try -PRON- answer let -PRON- down into the hole 
if i canot well attach rope 
-PRON- kneel in the confined space and wrap -PRON- arm about the cube -PRON- muscle swell beneath -PRON- khaki shirt in anticipation of the strain 
the next instant -PRON- have almost go over backwards take the cube with -PRON- expression of stunned surprise be so comical that i laugh 
man -PRON- donot know -PRON- own strength i tell -PRON- 
here let -PRON- take -PRON- 
-PRON- rise hold the cube easily under one arm 
believe -PRON- or not wilder -PRON- say the thing hollow nonsense 
i scoff take -PRON- from -PRON- while -PRON- climb back beside -PRON- 
but immediately i realize that -PRON- have speak the truth no solid could have be so weightless 
if -PRON- hollow -PRON- must be a box of some sort i say and there must be a way to open -PRON- 
but a careful examination first with the naked eye and then with a powerful lens reveal not the slight trace of latch keyhole or hinge 
the six side be as smooth as though -PRON- have be cast in one solid piece 
chatham be both excited and disturb 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head 
there be the beginning of awe in -PRON- eye 
one thing clear at least -PRON- mutter manmade 
but make by what sort of man too old for the stone age even if -PRON- possess a knowledge of metal in those day which -PRON- didnot 
why the rock this thing be embed in must go back to the pleistocene period 
and that be just the beginning of the age of mammal i say 
-PRON- look at each other and i see the inward sense of strangeness reflect in -PRON- eye and know that mine hold the same reflection 
-PRON- feel less elated even a little subdued 
here be an object unquestionably make by human hand yet find embed in rock that have be form age before man -PRON- have come into be 
chatham laugh nervously know what go to do -PRON- say with sudden determination go to telegraph for old gunthorp at the university be able to explain -PRON- if anybody can 
i get the odd impression that -PRON- be like child a little frightened and therefore appeal to a father for aid and advice 
professor timothy gunthorp be like -PRON- an amateur archeologist but an exceptionally good one 
-PRON- real work be in the physics department at one of large university where -PRON- be work upon an experiment to convert energy into matter thus reverse the usual process 
-PRON- ride into town in -PRON- rattletrap car and send off -PRON- wire at once 
before sundown -PRON- have receive an answer -PRON- feel well 
-PRON- be clear away -PRON- breakfast thing the next morning when the familiar bald head and steelrimme spectacle of professor gunthorp look in at the open door of -PRON- shack fool both of -PRON- -PRON- announce with -PRON- customary abruptness 
tear a man away from important work with a story have a look at this impossible marvel of yours 
i go over to -PRON- work table and remove the tarpaulin that -PRON- have throw over the box 
gunthorp frown disapprovingly 
so -PRON- couldnot leave -PRON- where -PRON- be until i get here -PRON- observe 
well -PRON- must have take photograph of -PRON- in -PRON- original position at least 
feel like utter simpleton -PRON- have to admit that in -PRON- excitement -PRON- have overlook that bit of routine 
gunthorp cluck -PRON- tongue in annoyance 
and -PRON- blockhead call yourself archeologist -PRON- snort 
only rank amateur professor chatham say humbly 
gunthorp begin to examine the box 
first -PRON- lift -PRON- to test -PRON- weight then -PRON- rap upon -PRON- with -PRON- knuckle 
hollow as -PRON- two head -PRON- vouchsafe 
-PRON- bend closer and study the metal 
look like tungsten -PRON- observe 
but -PRON- isnot 
either of -PRON- get any idea what -PRON- be 
-PRON- both confess that -PRON- have not 
well neither have -PRON- admit sourly 
now take -PRON- out and show -PRON- where -PRON- find -PRON- 
-PRON- conduct -PRON- to the spot and stand aside while -PRON- examine first the hole -PRON- and then the surround rock 
as -PRON- inspection progress there grow upon -PRON- long lean face a look of bepuzzlement that afford both chatham and -PRON- secret satisfaction 
presently -PRON- pick up a spade that -PRON- have neglect to take in the night before and with an energy surprising in a man of -PRON- year begin to clear away the rubble for about six foot on all side of the hole 
of a sudden -PRON- throw down the spade and whirl upon -PRON- never before suspect either of -PRON- of possess a sense of humor -PRON- bark at -PRON- but in any case -PRON- socalle practical joke be rather thin 
practical joke -PRON- gasp together 
-PRON- be both accustomed to peppery outburst but this do not sound like the usual thing 
if there s a practical joke professor -PRON- on -PRON- too i declare 
-PRON- find the box in that pocket yesterday precisely as -PRON- tell -PRON- in -PRON- wire 
if anybody put -PRON- there for a little legpulling -PRON- do an unusually clever job for the rock stratum be close above -PRON- break into -PRON- accidentally with -PRON- pick chatham add in cur word or attitude must have convince -PRON- for -PRON- manner undergo a subtle change 
a queer unreadable expression creep into -PRON- eye notice i suppose that this rock be not the same as the surround rock -PRON- query 
-PRON- nod glacial boulder from the riss or wurm i begin but -PRON- interrupt -PRON- 
use -PRON- eye wilder use -PRON- eye 
this be no glacial boulder from the wurm the riss or any other glacier 
look at -PRON- pitted surface a fall meteor 
i look 
even with -PRON- limited knowledge of meteorology i realize all at once that -PRON- speak the truth 
the thought be dizzy 
million of year ago this huge blob of matter have be draw into the earth gravitational field and have become embed in the still soft rock 
probably -PRON- have originally be bury hundred of foot deep and the gradual weathering and wear down of the top strata through countless millenia have only within the past thousand or so year bring -PRON- near the surface near enough for -PRON- spade to strike 
chatham be stare at the gray pit mass that the professor spade have clear 
but but the box -PRON- ask dazedly 
exactly gunthorp repeat 
the box 
without another word the three of -PRON- march back to the shack for a further examination of -PRON- mysterious find 
but -PRON- learn no more than -PRON- already know 
acid test show that -PRON- be compose of an alloy of tungsten and some other metal with which -PRON- be unfamiliar a further proof if -PRON- have need any that -PRON- be the work of intelligent being 
but that those being could have be inhabitant of this earth be utterly impossible both because of the tremendous age of the rock in which the box have be embed and -PRON- unquestionable encasement in a meteor thought flash through -PRON- mind imagining base on remember legend of a race before the time of adam and of thing that have supposedly drift down from the star 
but i do not mention -PRON- to gunthorp 
-PRON- be strive desperately to keep matter on a rational prosaic plane 
besides there be bind to be some less fantastic explanation there have to be 
what like to know chatham remark in the manner of one think aloud be what the thing be for 
why should -PRON- have be make hollow 
gunthorp look up 
why not cut -PRON- open and find out -PRON- ask 
the suggestion seem like a good one and -PRON- agree 
chatham bring out the large plate camera and take several picture of the box from all angle then i set to work upon -PRON- with a cold chisel 
-PRON- get -PRON- second shock 
-PRON- great effort produce not a single dent in the tough metal 
chatham and gunthorp try -PRON- hand but with no well success 
between -PRON- -PRON- turn the edge on four tool the box -PRON- remain practically unscratched 
chatham run -PRON- finger through -PRON- red hair a lot tough than ordinary tungsten -PRON- -PRON- have an idea 
go over to the supply cupboard -PRON- bring back two phial one contain iron oxide the other powdered aluminum 
if this doesnot do the trick well get an oxyacetylene torch -PRON- say 
not bad gunthorp comment in what be for -PRON- extravagant praise 
of course there s a chance of -PRON- marring the inside when -PRON- burn through but well have to run that risk 
-PRON- take the two vial from chatham and blend -PRON- content in a thin careful line along the four edge of the boxs topmost plane 
then -PRON- light -PRON- 
there be a sharp hiss as the powder ignite then -PRON- begin to burn with a brilliant greenish white flame 
wordlessly -PRON- watch that hollow square of fire keep well back from the tremendous heat that -PRON- generate 
slowly -PRON- begin to sink into the metal eat -PRON- way like an acid 
in another minute or so -PRON- would be through and the top of the cube would drop inward 
gunthorp be stand by with a pail of water which -PRON- mean to dash over -PRON- at the crucial moment 
-PRON- have even take a step forward when without an instant warn the unexpected happen 
with a final sputter the burn powder eat through the last thin bit of metal but instead of fall in the top of the box fly upward 
there be a rush of escape force the word do not describe -PRON- properly but -PRON- be the near i can find and -PRON- be hurl backwards into unconsciousness 
-PRON- all regain -PRON- sense at about the same time and stare at one another in bewilderment what be -PRON- 
i mutter 
an infernal machine 
but i know better even as i speak 
have there be any kind of explosion -PRON- frail shack would have be in ruin whereas not even the glass of the window be break 
gunthorp pick -PRON- up and go over to the work table 
whatever -PRON- be -PRON- left no trace behind -PRON- -PRON- say jerkily 
-PRON- hold up the cube still glow redly around -PRON- seared edge 
-PRON- interior be as blank and uninformative as -PRON- exterior have be 
-PRON- couldnot have be a gas of any kind chatham supplement gas powerful enough to knock -PRON- all out would have leave some aftereffect 
-PRON- be more like like -PRON- grope inadequately for word 
like a great mental shock i supply try to analyze -PRON- own feeling at the time -PRON- 
gunthorp rasp 
the thing that be in that box paralyze -PRON- mind temporarily 
but -PRON- go now -PRON- add with a rueful shrug dissipate upon the air and that s the end of -PRON- 
but for once professor timothy gunthorp be wrong 
miss man week drift by 
gunthorp have return to -PRON- research work at the university where in -PRON- spare time -PRON- be write a monograph upon -PRON- mysterious discovery and subsequent experience a work which -PRON- tell -PRON- frankly -PRON- have little hope that anyone would believe 
chatham and i have go back to -PRON- fossil hunting and although -PRON- talk about the box often -PRON- feel that there be nothing more -PRON- could do about -PRON- 
then one day chatham who have go into town for supply bring back a strange story 
there be between -PRON- camp and the town a fair sized wood that form a veritable paradise for rabbit hunter during the game season 
since the season have just open the day before a swarm of -PRON- have descend upon -PRON- 
and that be where story come in 
-PRON- seem that a party of local man have start out early in the morning and have separate after reach the wood accord to custom 
after hunt all day -PRON- meet again at a lodge that -PRON- keep to spend the night and -PRON- discover that one of -PRON- number a man name ed stanton be miss 
-PRON- wait for -PRON- until ten oclock then fear that -PRON- may have meet with an accident -PRON- set out in search of -PRON- 
-PRON- search with lantern for half the night but find no trace of the miss man 
finally someone suggest that -PRON- may have go home instead of return to the lodge so -PRON- inquire there 
but without result 
member of -PRON- family and neighbor have then join in the search which have continue throughout the night with the coming of daylight stanton be still miss 
look bad i comment when chatham have finish -PRON- recital 
that wood be large enough so that if -PRON- be badly hurt or kill -PRON- could lie there for day before be discover know -PRON- chatham say 
-PRON- glance toward the forbidding density of the wood scome half mile away 
what do -PRON- say -PRON- join in the search 
i be willing and -PRON- set out together 
the go be slow 
-PRON- be nearly noon when -PRON- encounter three member of the original hunting party come from the opposite direction 
what luck 
i ask 
the old of the group shake -PRON- head 
not any -PRON- reply find plenty of fresh mark in the bush but with the gang that be in here yesterday -PRON- impossible to tell whether any of -PRON- be -PRON- seem funny that -PRON- could have disappear this way but of course -PRON- have get a good bit of territory still to search 
what about -PRON- dog 
chatham ask -PRON- have a dog another funny thing the other answer 
the dog go too 
however -PRON- find the dog or rather another party do around three oclock in the afternoon 
-PRON- be lie under a clump of laurel bush and -PRON- be dead with -PRON- tail draw down between -PRON- leg and -PRON- eye bulge 
but there be not a single mark of violence upon -PRON- body 
maybe -PRON- get hold of something that poison -PRON- one fellow suggest as a number of -PRON- gather round 
but the county sheriff who have now take charge of the search shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- wasnot any poison kill that dog -PRON- declare 
look at -PRON- eye and tail 
-PRON- be scared to death plumb scared swear -PRON- 
and damn -PRON- scare too 
-PRON- redouble -PRON- search effort 
-PRON- thrash literally every foot of the underbrush within a mile radius of the place where -PRON- have find the dog 
-PRON- find no trace of stanton 
with the coming of night the sheriff call -PRON- all together 
no use go on after dark -PRON- tell -PRON- 
these wood be too thick and -PRON- couldnot do a thorough job 
well to wait until daylight and start in again a few searcher tinue on -PRON- own and in the morning one of -PRON- a farm laborer name jake mill have a somewhat weird story to relate 
-PRON- and a companion have penetrate with a lantern into the deep part of the wood when of a sudden -PRON- have become aware of a strong sensation of be follow 
-PRON- didnot hear nothing and -PRON- didnot see nothing jake explain 
-PRON- be just the way -PRON- feel when somebodys behind -PRON- starin with all -PRON- might at the back of -PRON- head 
-PRON- turn around and send the light of the lantern as far as -PRON- would go among the tree but there be nothing there 
-PRON- even go back apiece but -PRON- couldnot find anything 
yet every time -PRON- would start on -PRON- would have that feelin of something behind -PRON- but not as close as -PRON- have be the first time 
finally -PRON- get on -PRON- nerve and so -PRON- decide -PRON- would better take the sheriff advice and wait till mornin 
-PRON- be this story of that give rise to the belief that an escape lunatic with homicidal tendency may be hide in the wood 
but a checkup of all the local and even more distant institution for the insane reveal that all -PRON- inmate be account for 
a number of the man begin to laugh at what -PRON- call case of cold foot 
other remember dog and werenot so free with -PRON- jibe 
nor be the other when four day later a second man disappear 
-PRON- be a dr philip morse member of a boston society for physical research 
-PRON- have arrive at the local hotel shortly after disappearance and advance the theory that the miss man have fall victim to some elemental or earth spirit that have be release in the wood 
there be considerable amusement at -PRON- statement 
but when -PRON- calmly announce -PRON- intention of camp alone in the wood in an attempt to contact the thing the amusement fade not that i hold with -PRON- ghost story dr morse the sheriff tell -PRON- but there s something in -PRON- wood that s snatch ed stanton away bodily and scare the life out of -PRON- dog 
a man ainot safe there alone 
dr morse only smile 
that evening -PRON- pitch a small tent near the place where jake mill and -PRON- companion have first feel -PRON- be be follow 
early the next morning the sheriff and two other man go out to check up on -PRON- 
what gruesome horror -PRON- expect to discover -PRON- -PRON- do not know but -PRON- find the doctor calmly prepare -PRON- breakfast after an uneventful night 
the fact that -PRON- have spend one night alone in those supposedly sinister wood without anything out of the ordinary befall -PRON- lull everyone into a false sense of security 
hence the discovery that be make the follow day be doubly shocking 
a party of searcher come upon the camp around noon of the second day find -PRON- literally tear to piece 
as for dr morse -PRON- -PRON- have disappear as completely as stanton have do five day before 
chatham and i go to view the wreckage as soon as -PRON- hear about -PRON- 
-PRON- find a large crowd there look about 
look like a cyclone hit the place one man remark as -PRON- stop beside -PRON- 
the doc must have put up a fearful fight cyclone or a lunatic another amend 
one of -PRON- funny farm must be holdin out on -PRON- 
but the tent be demolish the camp furniture bedding and even article of clothing be tear to piece in a way that even the most desperate struggle could not properly account for 
the sheriff come over to -PRON- 
well at least -PRON- know where morse be when -PRON- be attack -PRON- say send to philadelphia for bloodhound when -PRON- come go to start out from here and see what -PRON- can find 
-PRON- compliment -PRON- upon the plan 
-PRON- nod then with a significant glance and quick gesture imply that -PRON- have something else to discuss with -PRON- in private 
-PRON- motion -PRON- aside find this notebook under a part of the tent -PRON- explain when -PRON- have draw a little away from the other 
morse must have be write in -PRON- just before the thing get -PRON- 
i think maybe -PRON- fellow would take a look at -PRON- and tell -PRON- whether there s anything in -PRON- except just craziness 
i take the notebook from -PRON- and flip open the top cover 
several page be cover with a cramp closely write shorthand almost undecipherable 
-PRON- will take a little while to figure this out i say 
may i keep -PRON- until tomorrow morning 
sure -PRON- agree readily 
keep -PRON- as long as -PRON- like just so -PRON- find out what -PRON- say 
but i be destine not to translate personally more than the opening page of that manuscript for that evening the bloodhound arrive 
the cave sheriff invitation -PRON- join -PRON- and a party of about a dozen other on the manhunt 
darkness have already fall when -PRON- assemble at the scene of dr demolish camp 
in the flicker yellow light of lantern the shadow of tree and bush dance and writhe in grotesque contortion give the scene an eeriness that unpleasantly affect all of -PRON- 
a little to one side a stranger stand with the dog two powerful black fellow who loll passively at the end of -PRON- chain as though -PRON- have no interest in what be go on 
presently the sheriff go over and hold a brief lowvoice conversation with -PRON- owner then -PRON- address the rest of -PRON- 
mr go to let the dog go now -PRON- announce 
-PRON- say -PRON- should stand back till -PRON- have pick up the scent then -PRON- can follow as close as be able 
if -PRON- start up any ruckus -PRON- fella that have gun ainot to use -PRON- unless -PRON- can see plain what -PRON- be shootin at liable to hit the dog or the doc 
the man call patton be hold part of a torn coat evidently against the muzzle of first one dog then the other 
when -PRON- have sniff -PRON- fill -PRON- slip the chain from -PRON- collar and with a final indistinguishable command to -PRON- step back 
nose press to the ground the two animal begin to run around the wreckage of the tent in gradually widen circle 
then with a kind of nasal whine one of -PRON- suddenly dart off at a tangent follow almost immediately by the other 
with a feeling of rise excitement -PRON- start after -PRON- fall into a rough single file to facilitate travel 
-PRON- lose sight of the dog almost from the beginning but -PRON- could hear -PRON- break through the underbrush a short distance ahead of -PRON- while -PRON- give voice almost continuously to -PRON- deepthroate baying 
for nearly a mile -PRON- push on without anyone utter a word the silence around -PRON- break only by the crackle of twig and the baying of the dog now farther distant 
then of a sudden -PRON- baying give place to excite yelping intersperse with highpitched whine noise find -PRON- the sheriff exclaim and break into a run practically nothing about bloodhound but i have a premonition the moment -PRON- tone change that everything be not go accord to schedule 
no dog regardless of -PRON- breed ever indulge in that highpitche whine when everything be run entirely to -PRON- satisfaction 
i glance at patton and see the same suspicion reflect on -PRON- face 
by this time -PRON- have come out upon a deep gully whose opposite wall be break by the yawn blackness of a cave mouth 
the dog have already cross this gulley and be now yelp and whine in front of the cave 
gosh almighty 
-PRON- must be in there the sheriff exclaim and start scramble down the steep side of the ravine have think equally puzzle the rest of -PRON- follow 
-PRON- all know about the cave of course but no one have think to search -PRON- because -PRON- be know to be the abode of bat and small but very disagreeable snake 
ed stanton would never have go in there alive and -PRON- could not have get there dead 
but dr morse now may be another story patton have forge on ahead of the rest of -PRON- and be stand over the dog when -PRON- come up get something corner in there but -PRON- wonot go in after -PRON- -PRON- announce never know -PRON- to act like this before 
i donot understand -PRON- 
the sheriff go over and hold up -PRON- lantern so that -PRON- light penetrate some ten or twelve foot into the cave 
the dog come straight here without seemin to lose the trail -PRON- comment so morse must be inside 
shall -PRON- go in 
someone in the crowd offer an objection 
maybe there s a wild animal in there 
if the dog wonot go in but patton scout the suggestion no animal in this part of the country that these dog be afraid of -PRON- declare 
still admit there s something strange about the way -PRON- be act 
-PRON- make a final effort to induce the dog to lead the way into the cave but without success 
-PRON- only cower upon -PRON- belly and whine gaze pleadingly at -PRON- with -PRON- large intelligent eye no use -PRON- announce 
either well have to go in without -PRON- or -PRON- stay out 
the sheriff give a hitch to -PRON- belt and step almost casually into the cave entrance 
all right -PRON- drawl 
all -PRON- that want come along 
-PRON- that donot can wait where -PRON- be 
there be a momentary hesitancy on the part of a few individual but eventually everyone follow -PRON- into the dark opening 
-PRON- advance about fifty or sixty foot without make any sort of discovery 
a few bat disturb by the glare of -PRON- lantern dart blindly about -PRON- head but that be all 
then suddenly the sheriff stop 
look -PRON- command and point downward 
there in the thin sticky mould that cover the damp rock of the floor be a human footprint 
instantly an excited babbling of speculation break out among -PRON- 
-PRON- be quite obvious that the footprint have be make within the past twentyfour hour since as yet none of the microscopic green algae plant have begin to form within -PRON- 
therefore -PRON- have almost certainly be make by dr morse 
further search reveal more footprint in fact two set of -PRON- the one superimpose upon the other 
from the presence of the algae in the early set -PRON- be plain that -PRON- have be make at least several day before the second 
-PRON- look as if morse and stanton may both have come this way i whisper to chatham as -PRON- begin to move forward again 
-PRON- nod 
in the ruddy glow of the lantern -PRON- face appear worried what i donot like about -PRON- wilder -PRON- reply 
what could have bring both of those man to this same cave and why do neither of -PRON- come out 
-PRON- almost seem as if a sudden startled shout from one of the man up ahead interrupt -PRON- 
look -PRON- be cry point a trembling arm as -PRON- speak 
look over there on that ledge 
-PRON- all look in the direction -PRON- indicate where a ledge of rock except for a narrow crevice some two foot wide opening into unexploited blackness form the back of the cave 
perch face -PRON- upon this ledge and seem to stare at -PRON- with unblinking lusterless eye be two human figure 
the sheriff take a quick step forward then almost drop -PRON- lantern 
merciful god -PRON- gasp 
ed stanton and doctor morse 
so -PRON- be 
the face of the two man bear no mark of physical change or disfigurement yet in some subtle way -PRON- have alter so that at first glance -PRON- have be unable to recognize -PRON- 
a number of the man go over and lift -PRON- down 
both body be limp and clammy but to -PRON- surprise -PRON- be not dead 
get -PRON- out of here and into the open the sheriff order 
maybe -PRON- can bring -PRON- around 
four man take up the inert burden and -PRON- start back the way -PRON- have come 
two of the young fellow however linger behind the other wonder where that crack lead to i hear one of -PRON- mutter to the other like but i be too interested in the condition of morse and stanton to pay any further attention 
i be to wish later that i have 
the two body be place upon the ground at the entrance to the cave and the local doctor who fortunately be one of the party bent over -PRON- canot make -PRON- out -PRON- report after a brief examination 
-PRON- look like catalepsy except that there s no rigidity better get -PRON- to a hospital at once 
while crude stretcher be be improvise from coat chatham draw -PRON- aside 
wilder do -PRON- ever see a cretin -PRON- ask lower -PRON- voice so that none of the other may overhear 
no i answer wonder why -PRON- should bring up such a subject at this time canot say that i have 
why 
well i have -PRON- go on and except for the physical deformation that accompany cretinism the face have the same blank mindless look that these two have 
but what i never finish -PRON- question 
from the interior of the cave arise a sudden wild shriek of terror follow by a hideous mouthing and gibber that be distinctly not human 
i remember the two man who have linger behind a lantern i dash for the mouth of the cave follow closely by chatham and one or two other 
-PRON- take -PRON- almost no time at all to reach the place where -PRON- have find morse and stanton but in those few minute the sound that have summon -PRON- have subside into a low jabbering like the chattering of a monkey 
and -PRON- be come from beyond the crevice at the back of the cave 
hold the lantern high above -PRON- head i start toward the narrow opening 
but before i could reach -PRON- a man stagger out and all but collapse in -PRON- arm 
-PRON- be jim lentz one of the two who have remain behind 
something in there -PRON- mutter thickly 
get hellman no use go in too late 
then -PRON- faint 
i do not lay any claim to bravery for actually press on into that dark passageway 
-PRON- be the sheer excitement of the moment that drive -PRON- leave no room for fear 
still hold the lantern in front of -PRON- i sidle along the crevice for about six foot 
abruptly i find -PRON- in another cave 
-PRON- be much small than the first so that the light of the lantern penetrate into practically all of -PRON- at once 
as the ruddy ray send the black shadow scuttle back among the uneven prominence and fissure that mark the wall and ceiling i experience a curious sensation which i be wholly unable to describe 
although i realize how ridiculous the word may sound i can say only that -PRON- be as though some overpower force have collide with -PRON- mind 
the impression be only momentary and be go with the retreat shadow 
but instantly a second shock this time wholly explicable take -PRON- place 
for grovel upon the middle of the rock floor and mouthing horribly like some mad animal be the figure of hellman 
i hear an exclamation behind -PRON- and realize that chatham have follow -PRON- through the narrow passage 
merciful god -PRON- choke go mad 
quick i ground between clenched tooth 
-PRON- must get -PRON- out of here i set the lantern upon a project rock and chatham and i fling -PRON- upon hellman 
-PRON- have pay no attention to -PRON- until -PRON- feel -PRON- hand upon -PRON- then -PRON- begin to fight with the strength of a maniac 
in the end -PRON- be force to knock -PRON- unconscious before -PRON- be able to drag -PRON- from the cave 
when -PRON- come to -PRON- be still in that savage bestial state -PRON- have to be take to an asylum day -PRON- hear story of what have take place 
i set -PRON- down here as nearly as i can in -PRON- own word -PRON- be about to leave the cave with the rest of -PRON- -PRON- tell a group of -PRON- when hellman suggest that -PRON- stay and see where that little opening at the back lead to 
i wasnot so keen about -PRON- but when -PRON- laugh and say i be afraid i give in 
-PRON- have the lantern and so -PRON- go first while i follow close behind 
the passage be so narrow that -PRON- have to go sideways and the first thing i know -PRON- coat have catch on a sharp rock so that i have to stop to get -PRON- loose 
hellman must have think that i wasnot come for -PRON- make a grab for -PRON- 
as -PRON- do that -PRON- somehow drop the lantern and -PRON- go out 
-PRON- pause and pass a trembling hand over -PRON- face 
-PRON- be plain that what -PRON- have to relate fill -PRON- with almost unendurable horror hard to explain what happen next -PRON- go on after a minute for i donot exactly know -PRON- 
all of a sudden -PRON- let go of -PRON- and stagger backwards 
then -PRON- let out the most awful yell ever hear 
at first i think -PRON- would fall into a pit or something and i call out to -PRON- to ask what be wrong 
-PRON- didnot answer -PRON- with word but -PRON- begin to make those awful noise like like an animal or something 
there be sound of thrash about too but -PRON- werenot so much like two man or even a man and an animal struggle together as like one man fight with -PRON- try to go to help -PRON- but all of a sudden i i couldnot move 
-PRON- be as if everything ever be afraid of without give a name to -PRON- have take form in there 
if any of -PRON- fellow be ever scare of the dark when -PRON- be kid -PRON- will know what i mean 
-PRON- be like that only a hundred time bad 
and all the time hellman keep make those terrible noise not so loud as at first but more and more like an animal 
then i hear somebody come and i i manage to get out to -PRON- 
i guess that s all i know 
that afternoon the sheriff and several other search both part of the cave with powerful electric torch 
-PRON- find absolutely nothing but the sheriff in tell -PRON- about -PRON- afterwards conclude with a strange statement be the last one to leave the inner cave -PRON- say and just as i step into that narrow passage that connect the two a funny thing happen 
all of a sudden i have the same feeling that jake mill have have in the wood the night after ed stanton disappear the feeling of something stare at the back of -PRON- head 
-PRON- fairly make the chill go over -PRON- for i know there wasnot a live thing back there a notion to ask the county commissioner either to have that place seal up or better yet dynamite 
the gunthorp theory the finding of stanton and dr morse and the insanity of hellman the newspaper which have hitherto give the disappearance only pass notice now break out with headline 
naturally this result in an army of curiosity seeker who have to be keep away from the cave by an armed guard but -PRON- be also indirectly responsible for bring about the solution to the whole mysterious affair for -PRON- bring back prof gunthorp 
-PRON- present -PRON- unannounced at -PRON- shack sarcastic and snappy as ever 
well i see -PRON- have do nothing toward clear this mess up -PRON- announce abruptly so i come -PRON- 
chatham make some illadvised remark about not see how the happening at the cave could come under the province of archeology 
the professor shoot -PRON- a wither glance 
-PRON- wouldnot -PRON- snap suppose -PRON- and wilder be ready to subscribe to ghost theory 
still -PRON- add as if on second thought that man may have be near to the right track than -PRON- realize 
a shame -PRON- didnot make any sort of note before the thing get -PRON- 
but -PRON- do 
i exclaim suddenly remember the notebook that i have promise the sheriff to translate 
here -PRON- be 
-PRON- fairly pounce upon the little book 
-PRON- blither idiot -PRON- cry 
if -PRON- have examine this that last poor devil hellman may not have be sacrifice 
now get out while i see what morse have to say 
all the rest of that morning -PRON- be occupy with laboriously transcribe dr cramp shorthand 
by the middle of the afternoon -PRON- have complete the task and be ready to share what -PRON- have learn with chatham and -PRON- skip over the first few page -PRON- announce since -PRON- consist of nothing but idiotic theory 
funny how an otherwise sane man will cling to worn out superstition when -PRON- can find a wholly satisfactory explanation of the fact in the law of high physics 
but let that go -PRON- probably wouldnot understand -PRON- anyway 
-PRON- leaf jerkily over one or two more page 
this next be an hourly record of -PRON- first night vigil -PRON- continue and consist mainly of the word nothing so far so -PRON- can skip that too 
but here be -PRON- record of the second night up to the point where -PRON- be attack 
-PRON- clear -PRON- throat and begin to read aloud eight p m 
-PRON- be fairly dark now so i will begin -PRON- record for tonight although i really can not hope for any genuine phenomenon for some hour yet 
still for the sake of science -PRON- be good to be on the safe side 
the wood be very still but no more so than -PRON- should be ordinarily 
again i shall endeavor to work without light since light of any kind seem to be antagonistic to psychic force 
nine p m 
nothing yet 
the tree and bush on all side be loud with the voice of night insect 
-PRON- seem almost impossible that such tiny creature can make so much noise 
i be begin to believe that the true intensity of sound be to be measure only by the intensity of the silence that surround -PRON- 
ten p m 
either some of the insect have go to sleep or i be grow accustomed to -PRON- miniature racket 
i probably do not notice this last night because i be still too new at this type of vigil 
i be make this entry a half hour earlier because i believe that soon i will have some sort of success 
the insect be nearly all quiet now a circumstance which i be positive do not occur last night 
but -PRON- be not merely this cessation of ordinary night noise that lead -PRON- to believe i be about to experience some kind of psychic phenomenon 
there be a decided feeling of tension in the air such as be noticeable just prior to a severe electrical storm yet the sky wherever -PRON- be visible through the tree be entirely cloudless and rny little barometer which i examine a moment ago with -PRON- flashlight show no indication of fall weather fortyfive 
i be right 
a force of some sort be gather outside -PRON- tent 
as the man mill describe i can feel eye upon -PRON- but -PRON- be not human eye 
i will make ray mind receptive to whatever may be come 
eleven p m 
-PRON- be here in the tent with -PRON- and i must fight -PRON- off 
my god -PRON- be horrible i can neither see -PRON- nor hear -PRON- and yet -PRON- have take hold of -PRON- 
if the cold arm of an octopus could reach into -PRON- mind -PRON- would be like that 
-PRON- be too strong for -PRON- 
i gunthorp look up from the notebook 
the writing break off here in a meaningless scrawl -PRON- say 
the power must have overcome -PRON- and i have be listen openmouthe 
but what power 
i ask incredulously 
if -PRON- be something -PRON- could neither see nor hear nor apparently even feel tangibly what be -PRON- 
gunthorp shoot -PRON- an enigmatic glance through -PRON- thicklense spectacle -PRON- dawn upon -PRON- even now -PRON- ask 
but chatham be lean forward -PRON- red hair bristle with excitement 
professor -PRON- exclaim 
that day -PRON- open the box the feeling of mental shock 
exactly 
the professor bald head nod 
the box 
-PRON- pause to enjoy the little dramatic moment -PRON- have create then -PRON- go on -PRON- be a theory of the early physicist and pseudophysicst paracelsus in particular that atom be of two class the heavy and inert composing matter the light and more active composing mind 
of course such an idea go into the discard even before the subdivision of the atom be discover but -PRON- be -PRON- belief that paracelsus come nearer to the truth than even -PRON- realize 
if as millikan suggest all matter be merely a form of energy and -PRON- own experiment tend to bear this out then -PRON- be quite possible that the thing which -PRON- call mind or mental force be a form of this energy 
whether the process of thought be -PRON- order release through the material chemistry of the brain or whether -PRON- be an independent quantity that act through the brain nee not concern -PRON- now 
the important point be that such a quantity should be able to exist in the free state the same as any other of the know element 
if i be right then some sort of entity make up of this pure energy be imprison in the box which -PRON- find embed in the meteor ask -PRON- how or by whom for those be question beyond -PRON- power to answer 
but when the box be open this force be release to go about preying upon other mental force just as -PRON- feed -PRON- material body with other material body 
do -PRON- follow -PRON- 
-PRON- do after a fashion although the idea behind -PRON- word seem almost too fantastic for credence 
chatham be run -PRON- finger through -PRON- hair as if to aid in similate the professor startling statement 
but -PRON- isnot logical -PRON- finally burst out 
if the thing feed upon mental power how do -PRON- manage to keep alive during all those hundred of thousand of year that -PRON- be imprison in the box 
perhaps feed be an illchosen word gunthorp admit 
the entity if -PRON- can call -PRON- such could exist indefinitely without nourishment because -PRON- be compose of pure force and force be indestructible 
-PRON- may be more accurate to liken -PRON- to a large blob of mercury which when liberate will draw small globule into -PRON- 
-PRON- consider this in silence then but if this thing remain at large -PRON- will go about attack other as -PRON- attack stanton and morse and later hellman 
i exclaim in horror 
why if -PRON- isnot stop -PRON- isnot beyond the bound of possibility that -PRON- will eventually absorb into -PRON- all the mental power of the world 
be there no way to stop -PRON- or destroy -PRON- 
destroy -PRON- no gunthorp answer gravely 
however -PRON- be possible that -PRON- may be able to transmute -PRON- so that -PRON- will be render harmless and that be what -PRON- must try to do 
-PRON- have long be a tenet of physics that force or energy be produce by the destruction of matter 
in other word matter which be make up of minute particle may be change into energy which be of wave composition 
but recent experiment with light for example have show that -PRON- possess the characteristic of both particle and wave 
this lead to the conclusion that the two be but different form of the same thing and therefore interchangeable 
but what have all that to do chatham begin but the professor cut -PRON- short 
think the old man rave again do -PRON- -PRON- snap 
well -PRON- s not 
what get at if -PRON- have the brain to see -PRON- be that -PRON- as logical to convert energy into matter as -PRON- be to convert matter into energy 
-PRON- energy transformer i exclaim remember -PRON- work at the university and suddenly see the light 
exactly -PRON- reply 
of course i canot guarantee that the thing will work satisfactorily since -PRON- still largely in the experimental stage 
but at least -PRON- can try 
if -PRON- fail -PRON- shrug 
well -PRON- will have to think of something else 
the reversal of nature evening gunthorp send off a long wire to -PRON- assistant order the shipment of several piece of apparatus from -PRON- laboratory 
two day later the equipment arrive a whole truckload of -PRON- 
gunthorp do not unpack -PRON- but direct -PRON- assistant who have bring -PRON- personally to drive -PRON- down to the mouth of the cave have to carry -PRON- piece by piece into the outer cave and set -PRON- up there -PRON- announce prefer to have -PRON- in the inner cave but -PRON- would be impossible to get -PRON- through that narrow passage 
the good -PRON- can do be coax the entity out to -PRON- 
but how 
i ask practically 
-PRON- leave that to -PRON- be -PRON- only answer 
-PRON- take -PRON- the well part of a week to set the machinery up to -PRON- satisfaction 
during all of -PRON- operation -PRON- keep the cave brightly light with a number of kerosene lamp for as gunthorp point out the thing -PRON- be fight strike only in darkness indicate that there be some property in light that drive -PRON- off 
but even with the protection of the lamp -PRON- be eerie enough work in that ghostly bathung cavern know that just beyond the narrow passage in the inner chamber something lurk in wait something that feed upon men mind 
i will not attempt to describe the energy transformer other than to say that -PRON- bear a rough resemblance to those elaborate mechanism use in experiment to smash the atom but build on a much small scale 
-PRON- work gunthorp explain by change the lengthwise undulation of energy wave to sidewise or cross vibration which would bring about the transformation of pure energy into free atom 
when at last everything be in readiness gunthorp give chatham and -PRON- -PRON- final instruction want -PRON- both to listen carefully and to do exactly as i tell -PRON- -PRON- begin 
-PRON- usual fussy bumptiousness be go now and -PRON- seem unnaturally grave 
when -PRON- go into the cave -PRON- will extinguish all the lantern 
otherwise the thing will not come out where -PRON- be 
then -PRON- wilder will start the generator while i go to the entrance of the narrow passage that lead to the inner cave 
but professor i break in do -PRON- realize what that mean be place -PRON- in the position of a human decoy to that monstrosity 
yes yes i know -PRON- snap with a momentary return of -PRON- old irritability 
but the thing must be lure out somehow and that s the only way i can think of 
however there will be little danger if chatham do precisely what i tell -PRON- 
what do -PRON- want -PRON- to do 
chatham ask a little uneasily want -PRON- to stand by the projector gunthorp explain 
as soon as -PRON- hear -PRON- utter a sound either an intelligible word or otherwise -PRON- will release the transformer beam 
leave -PRON- on for five minute 
if at the end of that time i have not return to shut -PRON- off -PRON- must both get out of the cave as fast as -PRON- can 
and leave -PRON- there 
chatham exclaim 
not if be quiet -PRON- young idiot gunthorp interrupt testily do as i tell -PRON- 
i know what about 
-PRON- tone preclude further argument 
-PRON- follow -PRON- obediently into the cave 
one after another the lantern be extinguish until only one remain 
chatham hold -PRON- until gunthorp have take up -PRON- position at the entrance to the passage then -PRON- too be put out for what seem an eternity -PRON- stand there in the darkness wait 
somewhere in that darkness -PRON- know a malignant entity lurk something that feed upon men mind and cast aside -PRON- body like discard husk 
to -PRON- overexcited imagination -PRON- seem that this invisible horror be creep up on -PRON- from all side at once and i feel -PRON- shrink as if from a physical contact 
abruptly voice come to -PRON- out of the blackness now -PRON- hiss 
release the ray 
with a feeling of relief that the suspense of wait be over and definite action about to begin i hear chatham throw the switch 
the next instant shall i ever describe what follow 
there be no flash for the condenser ray be invisible nor be there any sound other than the steady hum of the generator 
but suddenly the air around -PRON- become charge with the strain tension of a mighty struggle 
a force that be intelligent but not tangible have be catch in the grip of a manmade force against which -PRON- be now fight for -PRON- life 
for nearly four minute by the radium dial of -PRON- wrist watch the battle rage seem all the more terrible because -PRON- be not physical 
the air seem to boil and swell like water churn up by the thrashing of a seaserpent in -PRON- death agony 
and then at last when -PRON- seem that -PRON- -PRON- must be crush by the mighty force of the conflict something snap 
of a sudden the tension be dissipate while the relieved atmosphere appear to collapse like the side of a balloon from which the strain gas have be release 
the struggle be over 
someone be grope toward the projector 
-PRON- be gunthorp i recognize -PRON- voice as -PRON- stumble over some piece of apparatus in the darkness 
professor be -PRON- all right 
i call anxiously 
of course all right come -PRON- tart reply one of -PRON- idiot make a light before i break -PRON- neck 
here let -PRON- chatham offer 
-PRON- strike a match 
there be a burst of flame accompany by a terrific explosion 
the wall of the cave rock around -PRON- and rock and dirt be rain down upon -PRON- 
one large sized rock strike -PRON- upon the head when i regain consciousness i be lie upon -PRON- bunk back in and -PRON- shack 
gunthorp be bend over -PRON- 
for the first time since i have know -PRON- i surprise an expression almost of tenderness in -PRON- eye 
be -PRON- all right boy -PRON- ask 
how do -PRON- feel 
oh i guess live i grin try to ignore the pain in -PRON- head 
tell -PRON- what happen 
-PRON- be all -PRON- fault chatham put in 
that match i strike -PRON- be -PRON- fault for be an old fool gunthorp cut -PRON- short should have know well than to have use the converter without test -PRON- strength first 
-PRON- see -PRON- explain the ray be much strong than i have anticpate 
thus instead of convert the energy entity into free electron -PRON- condense -PRON- into hydrogen atom the low step in the atomic scale 
then when at -PRON- direction chatham strike a match -PRON- make an expressive gesture 
the highly inflammable nature of hydrogen do the rest chatham finish 
-PRON- take the roof off the cave just above where -PRON- be stand and drop a piece of -PRON- down on -PRON- head 
with a start i sit up unmindful of the dizzying throbbing in -PRON- head 
good lord 
i cry in alarm 
if the thing be convert into hydrogen and the hydrogen explode then -PRON- be turn back into energy again know gunthorp nod 
but this time -PRON- be scatter by the force of the explosion and can do no damage 
or at least -PRON- add grimly so i hope 
and so far -PRON- seem that -PRON- be right 
-PRON- be more than probable that the entity tear apart by the explosion be render utterly powerless 
or if -PRON- be not -PRON- apparently profit by -PRON- bitter experience in the world of man and flee back to the distant star from which -PRON- come originally 
but that be something i suppose -PRON- shall never know 
god keep -PRON- from such thing 
-PRON- need more mind in the world not less 
in the next issue of eerie and revelation form this shocking kaleidoscope of a mind cry not guilty dead woman by author of the thing in the collar the human termite etc find in the room cure a write confession 
perhaps with -PRON- wife slightly con the police department feel -PRON- be fuse a trifle bewilder too plain a case 
at least -PRON- be but otherwise apparently normal 
-PRON- handle intelligently and in a most make no effort to conceal -PRON- con scientific manner 
the man be well duct any more than -PRON- do to the knife feed carefully bed and the next in -PRON- hand or the piece in the morning after be bathe and trunk shave be take to see a the inspector be an atrist officer of more than usual intelli the specialist in mental disease gence and there be no effort make have the man comfortably seat to give the third degree or even se know -PRON- smoke -PRON- offer a cigar which be accept 
then in a quiet pleasant atmosphere -PRON- make one statement and one request be sure mr thompson that -PRON- have an excellent reason for act as -PRON- do the other day 
i wish -PRON- would tell -PRON- all about -PRON- man gaze at the psychiatrist 
will -PRON- believe -PRON- if i tell -PRON- will accept every part of -PRON- story with the idea that -PRON- be convinced that -PRON- be tell -PRON- the truth 
that be all i want whisper thompson 
if everyone i talk to in the past have do that if -PRON- have even try to check up on -PRON- story perhaps this would not have happen 
but -PRON- always think that i be the sick one and there be not one who be willing to accept -PRON- statement about the worm suppose that i be happily marry 
at least as much so as most man be 
-PRON- know that there be a good deal of conflict between the sex and there be a few difference of opinion between mrs thompson and -PRON- 
but not enough to cause serious difficulty 
will -PRON- remember that 
that -PRON- do not quarrel very much 
about a year ago -PRON- wifes health begin to give -PRON- considerable cause for worry 
-PRON- start to fail 
if -PRON- be a married man doctor -PRON- know there be always that anxiety about the wifes health 
-PRON- become accustomed to live with a woman have -PRON- do thing for -PRON- go to place with -PRON- and -PRON- think about how life would be if -PRON- should sicken and die 
perhaps the fact that -PRON- be uneasy about the future make -PRON- exaggerate the importance of -PRON- symptom 
at any rate -PRON- become sick develop a nasty cough and lose weight 
i speak to -PRON- about -PRON- and even buy a bottle of beef wine and iron at the drug store and make -PRON- take -PRON- 
-PRON- do so to please -PRON- but -PRON- never would admit that -PRON- be sick 
say -PRON- be fashionable to be thin and that the cough be just nervousness 
-PRON- would not go to see a doctor 
when i speak to -PRON- mother about -PRON- the old lady just laugh at -PRON- say that if i try to make lizzie a little happy -PRON- would soon get fat 
in fact none of -PRON- family or -PRON- friend seem to feel that there be anything wrong with mrs thompson so i stop talk about -PRON- 
of course -PRON- be not easy on -PRON- the way -PRON- cough at night and -PRON- stay awake so much 
i work hard in the daytime and -PRON- be hard to lose a lot of sleep 
at last i be force to ask -PRON- to let -PRON- sleep in the spare bedroom 
even that do not help much 
i could hear -PRON- cough and when -PRON- do fall asleep i would have to tiptoe into -PRON- room and see if -PRON- be all right 
-PRON- coughing bother -PRON- so much that when -PRON- do not cough -PRON- worry -PRON- more because i think something have happen to -PRON- 
one night the thing i be afraid of happen 
-PRON- have a hard spell of coughing and then -PRON- stop 
-PRON- be quiet in the house 
i could hear the clock on the landing tick and a mouse gnaw wood in the attic 
i think i could even hear -PRON- own heart beat but there be not a sound of any kind from the other bedroom 
when i go in there and turn on the light i just know -PRON- be all over 
of course i be not sure 
a bookkeeper be not suppose to be an expert in such matter so i go and telephone for -PRON- doctor 
on the way to the phone i wonder just what i should say for -PRON- have always insist that -PRON- wife be in grand health 
so i simply tell -PRON- that mrs thompson be not look well and would -PRON- come over 
just like that i tell -PRON- and try to keep -PRON- voice steady 
-PRON- be about an hour before -PRON- come 
-PRON- go into the bedroom but i stop at the doorway 
-PRON- spend sometime listen to -PRON- heart and feel -PRON- pulse and then -PRON- straighten up and say to -PRON- -PRON- be fine 
just fast asleep 
i wish i could sleep as soundly as that 
what do -PRON- think be wrong 
that surprise -PRON- so much that all i could do be to stammer some68 thing about not hear -PRON- cough any more 
-PRON- laugh worry too much about -PRON- mr thompson 
right there -PRON- difficulty start 
here be a doctor who be suppose to know -PRON- business and -PRON- say there be nothing wrong with -PRON- wife and there i be just a bookkeeper and i just know what be the matter 
what be i to do 
tell -PRON- that -PRON- be wrong 
send for another physician 
-PRON- be grow light by that time so i go down to the kitchen and start the coffee 
i often do that 
then i shave and make ready to go to the office 
but before i go i sit down a while by the wifes bed 
-PRON- bother -PRON- but i have to keep tell -PRON- that the doctor know better than i do leave the house i phone to -PRON- motherinlaw 
just tell -PRON- that lizzie be not feel well and would -PRON- come over and spend the day and -PRON- could get -PRON- at the office any time -PRON- call 
then i leave the house 
-PRON- feel well out in the sunshine and after work a few hour over the book i almost laugh at -PRON- for be so foolish 
no telephone call from the old lady 
i arrive home at six and find the house light as usual 
-PRON- wife and be wait for -PRON- in the parlor and tell -PRON- supper be ready 
naturally i be surprised to see -PRON- wife out of bed 
at the supper table i watch -PRON- just as carefully as i could without make the two of -PRON- suspicious of -PRON- 
mrs thompson eat about as -PRON- usually do just piece and mince at -PRON- food but i think when -PRON- swallow that the food go down with a jerk and there be a stiffness when -PRON- move 
but -PRON- mother do not seem to think there be anything wrong at least -PRON- do not make any comment 
even when i go with -PRON- to the front door to say good night to -PRON- and -PRON- be alone there -PRON- never say a word to show that -PRON- think -PRON- daughter be peculiar start to wash the dish after that 
i often wash the dish at night while the wife sit in the front parlor watch the people go up and down past the house 
after the kitchen be tidy i light a cigar and go into the parlor and start a little conversation but mrs thompson never talk back 
in fact i do not believe -PRON- ever talk to -PRON- after that though i be positive that -PRON- talk to the other 
when the cigar be smoke i just say good night and go to bed 
later i could hear -PRON- move around in -PRON- room and then all be quiet so -PRON- must have go to bed 
-PRON- do not cough any more 
i congratulate -PRON- on that one thing because the coughing have keep -PRON- awake a good deal 
during the night i light a candle and shade -PRON- with -PRON- hand tiptoe in to see -PRON- 
-PRON- have -PRON- eye open but -PRON- be roll back so all -PRON- could see be the white and -PRON- be not breathe 
at least i could not tell that -PRON- be breathe and when i hold a mirror in front of -PRON- mouth there be no vapor on -PRON- 
-PRON- mother have tell -PRON- the purpose of that when i be a boy 
the next day be just the same 
-PRON- come and spend the day 
i come home at night and eat supper with -PRON- and wash the dish 
the water be hot and -PRON- be a pleasure to make -PRON- clean 
perhaps i take longer than usual at -PRON- because i do not fancy the idea of go into the front parlor where the wife be sit look out of the window 
but i go in tonight without the usual cigar 
i want to use -PRON- nose 
-PRON- seem there be a peculiar odor in the house like flower that have be put in a vase of water and then forget for many day 
perhaps -PRON- know the odor doctor a heavy one like lily of the valley in a small closed room 
-PRON- be specially strong in the parlor where mrs thompson be sit and -PRON- seem to come from -PRON- 
i have to light the cigar after a while and by and by i say good night and go to bed 
-PRON- never speak to -PRON- in fact -PRON- do not seem to pay any attention to -PRON- 
about two that morning i take the candle and go in to look at -PRON- 
-PRON- eyelid be open and -PRON- eyeball be roll back just like -PRON- have be the night before but now -PRON- jaw be drop and -PRON- cheek sink in 
i just could not do anything but telephone for a doctor and this time i pick out a total stranger just pick -PRON- name out of the telephone book haphazard 
what good do -PRON- do 
none at all 
-PRON- come -PRON- examine mrs thompson very carefully and -PRON- simply say that -PRON- do not see anything wrong with -PRON- and then down in the front hall -PRON- turn on -PRON- and ask -PRON- just why i have send for -PRON- and what i think be the matter with -PRON- 
of course i just could not tell -PRON- the truth with -PRON- be a doctor and i be just a bookkeeper go to the mountain next day for the summer and that leave -PRON- alone 
breakfast as usual and to the office and not a word all day from the house 
when i come back at night the house be light and supper be on the table and the wife at -PRON- end as usual and the food serve and on the plate 
-PRON- eat but -PRON- movement be slow and when -PRON- swallow -PRON- could see the food go down by jerk and -PRON- eye be sink into the socket and seem shiny and well like the eye of a fish on the stall 
there be flower on the table but the smell be something different -PRON- be sweet and when i take a deep breath -PRON- be just hard for -PRON- to go on eat the pork chop and potato 
-PRON- see -PRON- be summer time and warm and in spite of the screen there be a fly or two in the house and when i see one walk around on -PRON- lip and -PRON- not make any effort to brush -PRON- off i just couldnot keep on eat 
have to go and start wash the dish 
perhaps -PRON- can understand how i feel doctor 
thing look rather odd 
the next day i phone to the office that i would not be there and i send for a taxi and take mrs thompson to a first class specialist 
-PRON- must have be good because -PRON- charge -PRON- twentyfive dollar just for the office call 
i go in first and tell -PRON- just exactly what i be afraid of and i do not mince -PRON- word and then -PRON- have the wife in 
-PRON- examine -PRON- even -PRON- blood and all the satisfaction i get be that -PRON- seem a trifle anaemic but that i have well take a nerve tonic and a vacation or i would be sick 
thing look rather twist after that 
either i be right and everybody else wrong or -PRON- be right and i be just about as wrong mentally as a man could be 
but i have to believe -PRON- sense 
a man just have to believe what -PRON- see and hear and feel and when i think over that office visit and the wife smile and the doctor stick -PRON- finger for the blood to examine -PRON- just seem impossible 
anaemic 
why that be a simple word to describe -PRON- condition 
that night the fly be bad than usual 
i go to the corner store and buy a fly spray and use -PRON- in -PRON- bedroom but -PRON- keep come in the big blue one -PRON- know 
seem as though -PRON- just have to come in and i could not keep -PRON- off -PRON- face so at last in desperation i cover -PRON- head up with a towel and go to sleep 
i have to work the interest on the mortgage be due and the man want something on the principal and -PRON- be a good house and all i have in the world to show for twenty year of hard work keep book 
the next day be just like all the day have be except that i make more mistake with the book and -PRON- boss speak to -PRON- about -PRON- 
and when i arrive home supper be not ready though mrs thompson be in the parlor and the light on 
the heavy odor be bad than usual and there be a lot of fly 
-PRON- could hear -PRON- buzz and strike against the electric light 
i get -PRON- own supper but i couldnot eat much thinking of -PRON- in the parlor and the fly settle on -PRON- open mouth 
-PRON- just sit there that night in the parlor till i go to -PRON- and take -PRON- arm to lead -PRON- up the stair 
-PRON- be cold and on each cheek there be a heavy purple blotch form 
once -PRON- be in -PRON- room -PRON- seem to move around so i leave -PRON- alone and when i go into -PRON- room later on -PRON- be in bed 
-PRON- have be a hard week for -PRON- so i sit down by -PRON- bed and try to think but the more i think the bad thing seem 
the night be hot and the fly keep buzz just think of the past and how -PRON- use to go to the movie together and laugh and sometimes come near cry and how -PRON- use to bluff about the fact that perhaps -PRON- be just as well -PRON- didnot have a child so long as -PRON- have each other know all the time that -PRON- be eat -PRON- heart out for longing to be a mother and blame -PRON- for -PRON- loneliness 
the thinking be too much for -PRON- so i think i may as well smoke another cigar and go to bed and try to keep well book the next day and hold -PRON- job and then i see the little worm crawl out 
right then and there i know that something have to be do 
-PRON- didnot make any difference what the doctor or -PRON- mother say something have to be do and i be the one who have to do -PRON- telephone for an undertaker 
meet -PRON- downstairs 
tt will be a private funeral i tell -PRON- and no publicity and i think after -PRON- be through -PRON- will have no trouble obtain a physician certificate 
-PRON- go up stair 
in about five minute -PRON- come down stair must have go to the wrong room -PRON- say 
the second story front bedroom i reply the woman there be not dead -PRON- say pay -PRON- for -PRON- trouble and shut the door in -PRON- face 
be i helpless 
doctor -PRON- have to believe -PRON- 
i be at the end of -PRON- rope 
i have try every way i know and there be not anything leave to do 
no one believe -PRON- 
no one agree with -PRON- 
-PRON- seem more and more as though -PRON- think i be insane impossible to keep -PRON- in the house longer 
-PRON- health be give way 
woricmg all day at figure that be go wrong all the time and come back night after night cook -PRON- supper and sleep in a room next to the thing that have be -PRON- wife 
what with the smell of lily of the valley and the buzz of fly and the constant dread in -PRON- mind of how thing would be the next day and the next week and the mortgage due 
i have to do something 
and -PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- want -PRON- to 
-PRON- seem that -PRON- recognize that thing be not right that -PRON- be entitle to a different kind of an ending 
i try to put -PRON- in -PRON- place and i know what i would want do with -PRON- if thing be reverse 
so i bring the trunk up from the cellar 
-PRON- have use that trunk on -PRON- wedding trip and every summer since on -PRON- vacation and i think that -PRON- would be more at peace in that trunk than in a new one 
but when i have the trunk by -PRON- bed i see at once that -PRON- be too small unless i use a knife 
that seem to be the proper thing to do and i be sure that -PRON- would not hurt -PRON- 
for day -PRON- have be past hurt 
i tell -PRON- i be sorry but -PRON- just have to be do and if people have just believe -PRON- thing could have be arrange in a nice way 
then i start 
thing be confuse after that seem to remember a scream and blood spurting and the next thing there be a lot of people in the house and -PRON- arrest -PRON- 
and that be the peculiar part of -PRON- all doctor 
perhaps -PRON- do not know -PRON- but i be accuse of murder -PRON- wife 
now i have tell -PRON- all about -PRON- doctor and i just want to ask -PRON- one question 
if -PRON- have be in -PRON- place day after day and night after night what would -PRON- have do doctor 
what would any man have do who love -PRON- wife 
the vengeance of ai the ancient goddess of the chaldean stilt exact tribute in the valley of the moon 
by author of portrait of lady etc do -PRON- see -PRON- run run margaret levering leave -PRON- in london -PRON- say there be something that canot wait out there peter 
i know that whatever -PRON- imply have to do with -PRON- father then four month dead but margaret would tell -PRON- nothing more 
-PRON- go on to cairo alone as -PRON- wish 
but when six week parse with only the brief and strained note from -PRON- i know something be wrong and follow -PRON- 
at the hotel continental in cairo late one afternoon in october i have barely finish bathe when a boy appear with a seal note for -PRON- although i have inform no one of -PRON- arrival 
i rip -PRON- open and read dear mr harris i understand -PRON- have just come from london and i assume -PRON- be lead here by -PRON- interest in the welfare of margaret lever the now lady warrender who be in cairo at the hotel memphis and who have more than once speak of -PRON- 
please be so good as not to refer in any way to -PRON- father the late lord warrender nor to -PRON- recent excavation and unfortunate death in the valley of the moon 
i should be glad to talk this unusual request over with -PRON- as between mutual friend of lady warrender if -PRON- should so desire 
may i respectfully urge -PRON- to see -PRON- before -PRON- see lady warrender 
-PRON- will find -PRON- in room of this hotel 
ask for ern lumsden 
ern lumsden 
i have never hear of -PRON- be so good as not to refer in any way to -PRON- father -PRON- have write 
why not 
margaret be perfectly aware of -PRON- father excavation and know almost as much of archeology anthropology and egyptology as -PRON- have know -PRON- 
why make no mention of something that have be headline in every newspaper and journal in the english speak world lord warrender have be crush to death by a fall statue in the templetomb of ai goddess of the moon 
i remember again in -PRON- hotel room how bravely margaret have take -PRON- death 
-PRON- be adventurer those two and the true adventurer be always ready to meet what providence may have in store for -PRON- 
i knock loudly at number the door open almost immediately and i find -PRON- confront by an elderly gentleman whose not unkind face be line with wrinkle 
-PRON- hair be sparse and white yet -PRON- could not have be much over fifty 
may i see mr lumsden 
i inquire be mr lumsden 
come in thank -PRON- 
i walk past -PRON- into the room 
when -PRON- have close the door again -PRON- turn to -PRON- 
peter harris -PRON- ask 
i nod curtly 
-PRON- be good of -PRON- to come 
-PRON- turn slightly and indicate a youngish man whom i have not notice before 
allow -PRON- to present the sheikh aljubal mr peter harris 
the egyptian wear a white drill suit and carry a cane except for the turban bind -PRON- swarthy head -PRON- may easily have be mistake for an englishman brown by the hot african sun 
the sheikh bow 
i to lumsden again confess that i find -PRON- note surprising i say 
may i know -PRON- meaning 
lord warrender be -PRON- good friend lumsden begin quietly -PRON- eye steadily on -PRON- 
have i so much as set foot in london in the past twenty year -PRON- would no doubt have know of -PRON- before this 
as a dear friend of -PRON- late father i be naturally interested in lady warrender 
i nod 
the sheikh aljubal -PRON- go on indicate once more the silent egyptian also know -PRON- father well 
-PRON- intimate acquaintance with the history and present state of the valley of the moon prove invaluable to lord warrender in -PRON- work here 
during an acquaintance that be at first a matter of convenience these two come to regard each other with deep respect and friendship 
-PRON- pause hope -PRON- can see harris that in -PRON- -PRON- have two friend interested only in lady welfare 
the old man manner and speech convince -PRON- of -PRON- integrity appreciate that i say 
good -PRON- say nod abruptly 
do -PRON- know the history of the tomb in the valley of the moon -PRON- ask afraid i donot 
-PRON- knowledge of egyptology be practically nil and in these more unusual matter i confess i know nothing at all 
lumsden turn to the sheikh 
tell -PRON- aljubal 
the sheikh address -PRON- for the first time since -PRON- introduction 
i look at this dark man with the heavy black beard the beetling brow the thin lip 
-PRON- speak in a low pleasant voice 
ai the moon goddess be not egyptian yet -PRON- be the goddess of that accurse valley worship and revere by many of -PRON- native even today 
-PRON- pause as if search for a point at which to begin and presently go on 
long year ago a wealthy chaldean merchant leave -PRON- native land for egypt 
-PRON- come personally to barter -PRON- fine ware with prince and -PRON- stay be climax by -PRON- fortunate marriage to an egyptian lady of quality 
the family found by that marriage be one of the rich and most influential during that whole period and the wealthy merchant find egypt so to -PRON- liking that -PRON- make -PRON- home here as many other have do since 
when -PRON- die the question of burial arise 
despite -PRON- family and -PRON- importance -PRON- be not egyptian 
-PRON- desire burial under the protection of -PRON- own god 
so a tomb be build in what have since be call the valley of the moon 
there -PRON- mummy be lay 
and though -PRON- be the only foreigner in that rest place ai chaldean goddess of the moon continue as the protect deity of the valley and of the people bury there 
in the innermost chamber of that first tomb in the valley there be a colossal statue of ai 
around -PRON- neck be suspend a giant pectoral of gold an disk symbol of the divine power of ai 
these fact be bring to light by lord warrender 
-PRON- labor have bring -PRON- to this inner chamber and -PRON- be there that -PRON- work be so unfortunately cut short 
the egyptian cease abruptly and settle back 
be -PRON- that statue that crush -PRON- 
i ask 
lumsden nod 
yes -PRON- be the great statue of ai that topple from -PRON- base and kill lord warrender in -PRON- fall 
the accident occur when -PRON- attempt to remove the golden amulet from the neck of the colossus -PRON- odd that a statue of that size should topple 
i ask 
no one thought of that until the sheikh and i get to look into the matter say lumsden 
lord warrender have speak of the statue to -PRON- point out that -PRON- be attach very firmly to -PRON- base 
so firmly indeed that -PRON- make much of the fact that -PRON- would be extremely difficult to do anything with -PRON- 
yet the next day -PRON- fall crush -PRON- 
could lord warrender have be deceive 
perhaps -PRON- only seem firmly attach 
i venture shrug -PRON- shoulder but the look on -PRON- face show -PRON- scorn for -PRON- suggestion that lord warrender may have be in error 
perhaps -PRON- will think that -PRON- too be deceive when the sheikh and i find the statue of ai restore to -PRON- base when -PRON- visit the tomb after burial 
before i could reply the sheikh aljubal cut in suddenly there be other thing 
do not forget -PRON- lumsden 
mr harris perhaps think that worship native creep into the templetomb at night and right the statue 
lumsden spread -PRON- hand 
yes -PRON- say perhaps -PRON- do 
as a matter of fact that be exactly what i have be think 
but lumsden go on almost forget there be other thing 
the terror of the native when -PRON- see the statue of ai and the eightraye moondisk and -PRON- subsequent flight 
-PRON- be afraid of something scream out something about a curse and go positively frantic when lord warrender suggest remove the amulet from about the neck of the statue 
when lord warrender go down into the crypt to take the amulet only two white aide be with -PRON- 
the native would not go near the tomb nor can any of -PRON- be induce to enter the tomb even now 
only the two white man see the statue topple and fall just as lord warrender be about to remove the golden disk and since then one of those two man have die a mysterious and unaccountable death 
what be -PRON- imply 
i ask 
the sheikh aljubal interpose 
-PRON- be not a time to beat about the bush -PRON- say 
the matter be clear for those who wish to see 
the desecrator of templetomb be curse nothing can save -PRON- from death 
i smile halfheartedly with an insolent superiority which i do not quite feel 
be i expect to take this seriously 
i ask 
aljubal frown impatiently and lumsden look irritated 
then the sheikh speak again with a scornful gesture in -PRON- direction 
perhaps mr harris will consider more seriously the as yet unexplained death of lord successor herbert lanseer 
-PRON- be find just outside the templetomb of ai 
-PRON- seem to have be beat or crush to death 
there be strange mark tiie mark of the guardian of ai those invisible spirit who have be set to guard the valley of the moon and those sleep there 
i feel uneasy 
if -PRON- be this sort of nonsense 
well what have all this get to do with lady warrender 
i demand 
everything in the world say lumsden quietly 
lady warrender be somewhat less skeptical than -PRON- 
i be astound do -PRON- mean to say that margaret scientist that -PRON- be actually believe -PRON- father to have be kill by the vengeance of ai and that other man lanseer i think -PRON- call -PRON- 
lumsden look away sigh gently 
yes -PRON- say -PRON- believe that and more 
-PRON- believe much more 
there be another native belief which may interest -PRON- 
and that i ask find -PRON- somewhat difficult to keep the scorn i feel from -PRON- voice 
the sheikh speak again 
as ai curse -PRON- father life so have ai curse -PRON- death 
as -PRON- avenge -PRON- on -PRON- body so -PRON- still avenge -PRON- on -PRON- invisible soul 
-PRON- have condemn -PRON- spirit by the power of -PRON- curse to run always with the guardian of the valley when -PRON- go from tomb to tomb on the night of the full moon 
sometimes mr harris -PRON- have be see 
have -PRON- see -PRON- 
i ask sharply 
no say lumsden at once but -PRON- be not always necessary to see 
i come to -PRON- foot 
i take -PRON- hat from the table 
thank -PRON- i say for -PRON- kind intention 
but this sound like pretty tall stuff to -PRON- sorry 
i walk toward the door 
but before i reach -PRON- the door swing open and a native garb in conventional english clothe burst into the room 
something have happen that concern the two man to whom i have be speak for both stare at the stranger with apprehensive face 
after a quick glance at -PRON- -PRON- address lumsden and the sheikh 
lattal have be find 
near the tomb where -PRON- think 
-PRON- head be beat in like the other lanseer and weatherbee 
lumsden and the sheikh look at -PRON- 
i feel -PRON- confident superiority crumble 
i turn from the door look from lumsden to the sheikh 
who be lattal 
i ask but already a premonition be form in -PRON- mind 
lattal say lumsden be the other of the two man who see the statue crush lord warrender 
weatherbee be the first 
both of -PRON- leave -PRON- hotel at dead of night without a word to anyone 
lattal go as if in a daze as if some power outside -PRON- be draw -PRON- away from the city 
be -PRON- ask too much of -PRON- to believe that death be link to the other three by the power of curse 
or do -PRON- think these death a series of remarkable coincidence mr harris 
-PRON- be with a confidence i be far from feel that i hedge 
stranger coincidence have happen 
i turn to the door again with an effort 
lumsden be there before -PRON- 
xisten 
harris -PRON- say not unkindly know how difficult belief must be for -PRON- 
i understand -PRON- attitude 
but remember margaret 
-PRON- donot realize the nervous condition this have bring -PRON- to 
go to -PRON- if -PRON- must but do not mention -PRON- father 
if -PRON- choose to bring -PRON- up -PRON- there be nothing to be do about -PRON- try to keep -PRON- mind off -PRON- urge -PRON- to go back to london get to help 
i put out -PRON- hand and take -PRON- nothing like well than to see lady warrender back in london i say 
nothing 
-PRON- may count on -PRON- but as for this supernatural business that s out absolutely understand 
but margaret will not return until -PRON- be convince that -PRON- father spirit be not bind to run with the guardian of the templetomb of ai 
then -PRON- -PRON- do not believe 
i ask quickly 
-PRON- misunderstand -PRON- harris 
i do -PRON- reply quietly 
but the important thing be to convince margaret that the legend be untrue 
-PRON- bow slightly and open the door 
the sheikh aljubal raise -PRON- hand in a farewell gesture 
i hear lumsden sigh as i walk past -PRON- into the hall 
i go out into the bright street of cairo head for the hotel memphis and margaret 
i admit that -PRON- confidence be severely shake something i have not care to show lumsden and the sheikh 
yet i could not wholly believe in a mythical curse 
nor could i believe that margaret so sure of -PRON- and -PRON- science margaret so serene so rational and urbane could credit the existence of such a curse 
i brush the suggestion aside look forward to see -PRON- again and think that by christmas -PRON- could be marry 
i look for margaret on the green terrace of the hotel memphis 
in a moment i see -PRON- sit alone by a table just under the wall 
-PRON- face be press into -PRON- hand and -PRON- attitude be strangely deject 
i walk quickly to where -PRON- sit and stop beside -PRON- 
-PRON- be not aware of -PRON- until i say hello 
then -PRON- lift -PRON- head slowly and look up at -PRON- 
-PRON- smile and come to -PRON- foot 
peter -PRON- surprise -PRON- -PRON- cry but -PRON- voice be listless 
be that -PRON- only welcome 
i ask gently chide glad -PRON- come peter so glad 
i need -PRON- for a moment there be intensity in -PRON- voice and an unusual emphasis 
perhaps lumsden have be right after all come to take -PRON- back to london i say watch -PRON- closely hopefully 
-PRON- look at -PRON- -PRON- face expressionless donot know when i can go back 
i watch -PRON- face 
under -PRON- large hat i see -PRON- heavily shadow eye the line of strain across -PRON- forehead the frightened expression of -PRON- lip something wrong with -PRON- -PRON- dear i say -PRON- tell -PRON- what -PRON- be a time -PRON- say nothing 
yes i think lumsden be right 
-PRON- be go to tell about -PRON- now 
i have the uneasy belief that -PRON- be go to reiterate everything lumsden and the sheikh aljubal have already tell -PRON- 
-PRON- remember asid -PRON- father servant who stay here in cairo after -PRON- death 
i nod 
-PRON- be very dear to -PRON- 
-PRON- have always be utterly faithful scrupulously honest 
about a week before i leave london i have a letter from -PRON- 
in -PRON- -PRON- say that there be strange thing happen about the tomb o ai in the valley of the moon 
there be story of weird ghostly figure run each night the moon rise full asid have see -PRON- -PRON- write 
and one of -PRON- be -PRON- father 
-PRON- tremble a little 
at first i didnot believe -PRON- 
but -PRON- work on -PRON- -PRON- grow on -PRON- 
the idea of the spirit of -PRON- father haunt the valley of the moon together with the native guardian spirit become so terrible that i have to come and i will not return to london until i have see with -PRON- own eye that -PRON- father be not there 
i say -PRON- donot believe that margaret 
-PRON- look at -PRON- donot know -PRON- say 
there be strange thing here in egypt story of weird unbelievable curse 
i brush this aside impatiently 
-PRON- break into speech again 
on the night of the last full moor i go out there with asid 
-PRON- insist that i come 
an old friend of -PRON- father go along ern lumsden 
i go because i want to prove to -PRON- that there be nothing could be nothing 
mr lumsden do not want -PRON- to go 
but i go 
i donot know what -PRON- be i see 
i think -PRON- be -PRON- father 
there be something yes 
but perhaps -PRON- be because of asid believe in -PRON- so strongly 
-PRON- stand a little way from the tomb of ai 
suddenly -PRON- clutch -PRON- wrist in -PRON- hand press -PRON- hard in -PRON- excitement and say there 
do -PRON- see -PRON- lady run run and i think i do naked native and -PRON- father dress as -PRON- be when -PRON- die 
peter get to see -PRON- through 
tomorrow be another full moon go out there again without asid 
this time make sure 
tomorrow morning early 
ern lumsden and the sheikh aljubal be go too 
and i want -PRON- to come 
i need -PRON- with -PRON- 
and if there be nothing 
i say 
will -PRON- go back to london with -PRON- 
-PRON- nod 
i imagine that -PRON- cavalcade start slowly out of cairo before dawn the next morning would have seem an ordinary tourist expedition to the casual observer 
-PRON- would have see a lady and three man the ladys maid and two guide 
-PRON- horse take -PRON- out of the gray city and into the shadowed desert 
lumsden go ahead with a motorlorry carry a searchlight and tenting equipment 
-PRON- hope to reach the valley of the moon before the hot part of the day though -PRON- be a good seventy mile out of cairo 
in the desert with cairo already disappear under the dune behind -PRON- the first glimmering of dawn break in the sky -PRON- purpose seem vague and faraway to -PRON- 
once at the valley of the moon the guide help -PRON- throw up the tent 
water be draw under the palm that shelter the tomb and rug be spread 
then with the guide on guard the rest of -PRON- retire to the shelter of -PRON- tent and there -PRON- rest until the sun have set that night 
in the shadowy evening -PRON- eat a light supper and the guide prepare rug before the tent for the watch 
a camp chair be put in place for margaret to rest on 
the sudden night of the desert come down with startling abruptness 
-PRON- camp be enshroud in blackness with the die campfire nicker near the tent 
sit there i hear the sheikh aljubal call to lumsden be the searchlight in order 
lumsden call back yes take care of -PRON- 
i begin to wonder suddenly why a searchlight have be bring but -PRON- thought be divert by the faint yellow light that come suddenly into be above the edge of the desert and then the rim of the round moon begin -PRON- slow climb over the horizon 
-PRON- wait tensely say little watch for the moment when the moon would be wholly above the sand when the faint reddish glow would strike the entrance to the great tomb of ai 
margaret strain forward -PRON- eye fix on the now hazily light row of tomb 
there be not a sound in the night 
i feel uneasy 
be -PRON- all right dear 
i whisper do not turn but i feel -PRON- hand on mine 
-PRON- nod quickly not want to speak 
then suddenly -PRON- start forward 
listen -PRON- murmur tensely 
the moon have top the desert 
i look into -PRON- face 
at that moment the sheikh shout 
the light lumsden the light and before eye be focus on the tomb of ai again the great white light be train there move slowly across the face of the tomb then away down the line of tomb in the valley of the moon 
a sudden wind have come up a rushing sound in the night 
slowly the ray move from tomb to tomb 
margaret lean forward tensely watch -PRON- path 
but there be nothing live in -PRON- light 
back come the ray again to the great tomb of ai and once more -PRON- descry a circle 
there be nothing and the sudden strange wind die as suddenly as -PRON- come 
margaret fall back in -PRON- chair 
nothing -PRON- murmur 
peter there be nothing 
of course not i exult 
of course not 
-PRON- be asid wish so intensely to believe in -PRON- native legend -PRON- go on 
-PRON- turn radiant eye on -PRON- start for england this week tomorrow 
-PRON- turn in to get what sleep -PRON- could before -PRON- early trek back 
but i could not sleep 
i lie for what seem a long time awake in the stillness 
and then abruptly i hear the sound of hush voice and the peculiar padding of foot in the sand 
i rise on -PRON- elbow and listen 
then i creep stealthily to the opening in the tent and peer out 
lumsden and the sheikh be walk rapidly toward the tomb of ai 
in a moment i be out of the tent and have join -PRON- readily enough that these two be likewise unable to sleep 
i want to jibe at -PRON- for -PRON- belief in the legend which i have see disprove yet i could not come directly out and speak 
tell -PRON- i ask after whisper greeting have be exchange why do -PRON- move that searchlight so slowly 
-PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to approximate the speed of run man reply lumsden without a moment hesitation have to keep -PRON- in that blind light so that -PRON- wouldnot see 
good god lumsden donot tell -PRON- -PRON- still believe both -PRON- and the sheikh smile gently 
together -PRON- come to a stop stick be point downward and both lumsden and aljubal be look at the sand 
-PRON- be stand just outside the great tomb of ai 
i look down 
there in the sand i know unmolested by wind for there have be very little wind all that night be little pit as if many foot have be run there 
then a cry escape -PRON- 
before -PRON- in the center of that run line i see a single track a deep track a track that show clear and distinct on the wettish sand under the overhanging palm tree the track of foot wear shoe even as i look the sheikh begin methodically to scuff away the trace follow the wide circle while lumsden go back along the trail 
all -PRON- cocksure confidence have leave -PRON- 
i understand that these two be obliterate this definite proof of the curse of ai so that margaret may not see in the morning 
lumsden turn to -PRON- 
the first part of the task i have set for -PRON- be finish harris 
margaret will return to london now and -PRON- must go with -PRON- 
before i leave the valley of the moon in the morning i be go to try to break the curse that bind spirit to the tomb of ai 
then i will help -PRON- i say rashly 
a quick glance flash between the sheikh and lumsden 
i detect approval in the eye and feel strengthen in -PRON- resolve 
lumsden do not protest and in consequence i witness a phenomenon which have immeasurably strengthen -PRON- belief in the power of light and darkness 
lumsden and the sheikh have come prepared 
a large circle be first draw in the sand a short distance away from the templetomb of ai and both lumsden and the sheikh step within 
but when i make as if to follow -PRON- -PRON- wave -PRON- back 
-PRON- can help good harris by mount guard over lady tent say lumsden 
-PRON- will be able to watch quite clearly and should anything approach the tent -PRON- will be there 
i do not argue but return at once to the tent 
nevertheless i go back with a sharp feeling of disappointment 
i take -PRON- stand near the opening of tent and watch the strange ceremony that take place within the circle the sheikh have draw in the sand 
-PRON- be the sheikh who begin the ceremony murmur a cryptic incantation in -PRON- native language 
presently the great door of the tomb of ai begin to glow a weird reddish fire seem to spread over -PRON- outline -PRON- 
then suddenly a group of strange lifeless figure begin to drift from the closed door naked native pad automatically outward toward the circle occupy by lumsden and -PRON- move toward the circle white and ghostly stretch out -PRON- arm toward the two who sit there yet unable to break into the circle 
-PRON- pass around -PRON- billow forward and back like a wave a silent sea of ghastly horror 
a feeling of terror creep into -PRON- i dare not think what may happen should these figure from the tomb turn toward tent attention be attract to the tomb for from -PRON- emerge a single figure white and still lord warrender 
-PRON- diaphanous shape be clear and distinct 
-PRON- rugged face be draw tight emotionless 
-PRON- come forward slowly toward the circle 
i glance hastily toward the sheikh and lumsden 
-PRON- be lean excitedly forward and lumsden have move to the very edge of the circle oblivious to the hand stretch out toward -PRON- hold back only by that invisible wall create in some manner by the strange magic know to the sheikh 
the shadowy lord warrender approach the circle and as -PRON- arrive at -PRON- outer edge the sheikh rise up and thunder forth a sentence that scatter the native spirit reach toward the two in the circle 
at that moment lumsden break the circle and lord vague form drift through 
at once lumsden close the circle again 
then a strange thing happen 
the ghostly shadow of lord warrender begin to collapse sink into the ground 
only when -PRON- have completely disappear do the sheikh turn -PRON- attention again to the guardian spirit of the tomb of ai 
-PRON- begin now to drive -PRON- back into the tomb 
-PRON- fight silently to reach beyond the circle then gradually -PRON- ghastly intent weaken -PRON- turn reluctantly and shuffle in weird procession back to the tomb through the door of which -PRON- return as -PRON- have come 
the glow begin to fade away from the tomb and in a few moment the sheikh and lumsden leave the circle and come wearily over to -PRON- 
i go forward to meet -PRON- 
-PRON- will run no more harris say lumsden 
then -PRON- look gently at the tent which hide margaret from -PRON- shake -PRON- head a little and say take care of -PRON- and get -PRON- away at once in the morning 
i donot want -PRON- here if anything should happen 
-PRON- be not always easy to break a curse and sometimes there be a penalty 
i disregard -PRON- enigmatic word then 
but a month later a letter come from lumsden 
-PRON- be a letter of farewell 
-PRON- write at some length ramble on for page but the point of -PRON- letter lie in -PRON- last pathetic paragraph aljubal be find today near the tomb 
-PRON- go from the hotel in the night like the other draw by a power -PRON- be unable to combat 
soon i must go too 
i have be give a short period of grace i feel but the end be in sight 
i tell -PRON- that -PRON- be not easy for mere man to break an ancient curse as -PRON- do that night on the desert and i foresaw what may happen 
that be why i do not let -PRON- come into the circle with -PRON- so that the vengeance of ai may not pursue -PRON- as -PRON- have pursue and as -PRON- must pursue -PRON- soon 
-PRON- must pay with -PRON- life for break the curse of ai 
the letter i send in answer be return mark can not be find 
inquiry i set on foot bring forward little 
ern lumsden have be see walk from -PRON- hotel one night shortly after twelve 
that be the last see of -PRON- 
yet i know what happen 
i have spare margaret now -PRON- wife this knowledge and hope that no hint of the fate of lumsden and the sheikh aljubal ever reach -PRON- 
i do not think -PRON- will

-PRON- stagger blindly out of the room and down a wind flight of stair to the street 
the sunlight be clear and bright over salem when -PRON- emerge on the high windswept hill overlook the harbor 
but when -PRON- reach -PRON- lodging a halfmile away the sun westering be spill down like blood splashingly ensanguine the gambrel roof and red brick chimney pot of the old house and turn the water of salem harbor a deep rosy pink room be on the top floor of a threestory frame house on a winding waterfront street where hollyhock bloom

so great be -PRON- horror and revulsion that for an instant the room sway about -PRON- 
for an instant -PRON- think -PRON- be go to faint the tiny shape be stare maliciously up at -PRON- in the red sunlight which pour in through the open window crimson the sheet of the bed 
from -PRON- narrow slope skull two tiny black horn sprout 
in the dim light of the old house eliot have fail to notice the horn 
utter horror engulf -PRON- as -PRON- stare 
the little baroque say -PRON- will take three day 
when i have firmly attach -PRON- i will never leave -PRON-

the little horror leap suddenly from -PRON- chest to the sunreddene windowsill and stand perilously poise in the crimson glow mock -PRON- 
the two deep groove where -PRON- hand have rest be well redly 
the little baroque say night be fall

eliot go perfectly white when the little horror leap back upon -PRON- insert -PRON- hand into the encrimson groove and coil up in an attitude of repose 
sleep dale -PRON- murmur as -PRON- eyelid flicker shut 
-PRON- will not resent -PRON- so much tomorrow 
and in the month and year to come -PRON- will not resent -PRON- at all 
how eliot pass the night -PRON- never know 
-PRON- thought be feverish delirious 
-PRON- twist and turn a dark ferment in -PRON- brain 
twist and turn until the dawn break in the east outside the window of -PRON- room 
when -PRON- awake sunlight be flood the attic room 
a confused and merciful forgetfulness pervade -PRON- faculty 
slowly -PRON- drowsy eye take in the familiar contour of the room the slope rafter of the ceiling that come to a triangular focus high above -PRON- head the oaken chest where -PRON- clothe lie a dresser with a photograph of -PRON- mother and a brush comb and handmirror familiarly arrange upon -PRON- 
then -PRON- glance down at the sheet which cover -PRON- and the horror come rush back fill -PRON- with unutterable terror and loathing 
across the white sheet there stretch a long trail of tiny bloody footprint 
with a despairing cry -PRON- throw the sheet off and glance down at -PRON- naked torso 
the little shape be stir restlessly in -PRON- flesh 
suddenly -PRON- open -PRON- eye and stare up at -PRON- 
good morning dale -PRON- say 
-PRON- make no attempt to dislodge -PRON- 
-PRON- could not bring -PRON- to touch -PRON-

-PRON- dress swiftly while the little horror mock -PRON- wound in flesh be of a deep violaceous hue 
the blood have darken coagulate 
slowly the little malign baroque withdraw -PRON- hand and leap to the windowsill 
-PRON- watch mockingly while eliot struggle into -PRON- shirt and draw on -PRON- coat 
the big clock in the hall outside be tick slowly when eliot descend the stair to the street 
the little horror be squirm in -PRON- flesh again twist about restlessly under -PRON- shirt 
eliot usually glance at the morning paper before -PRON- let -PRON- out 
but now -PRON- simply pull the paper from beneath the door and stuff -PRON- in -PRON- coat pocket go down the step of the porch and cross the lawn with the swaying gait of a drunken man 
-PRON- one thought be to escape from the horror by seek the companionship of normal people 
to escape for an instant from -PRON- terror by mingle with normal man and woman 
perhaps -PRON- be all a mad illusion 
perhaps -PRON- be entirely mad 
-PRON- must find out 
when -PRON- arrive at the little restaurant where -PRON- usually have breakfast -PRON- have reach a momentous decision

the people who be sit there be complete stranger to -PRON- 
nevertheless -PRON- be determined to bring the horror into view 
-PRON- could imagine what -PRON- would say

by heroism and sacrifice and repentance may warlock be save 
and each demon that can not abide goodness will shrivel and become as bronze forsake -PRON- warlock when -PRON- warlock forsake the evil one die in agony shrivel and die eye be shine strangely when -PRON- take the nurse hand and deposit the little metallic figure on -PRON- palm

california sunlight outside and the blair haunt black eye lofty shadow of long dim be bright with triumph studio 
abe silver gaunt and dark and hope -PRON- be right -PRON- say wearyeye shift the cigar to the around the cigar wait a long other side of -PRON- mouth and step time for -PRON- 
and god know -PRON- have spend more year than -PRON- ought and more money than even -PRON- could afford 
why have -PRON- do -PRON- blair 
a man with -PRON- money -PRON- background shut -PRON- up here in the dark sweat over shadow havenot be shut up away from life be shut in with -PRON- smile spread across the pallor of -PRON- delicate face life -PRON- be grope after all these year and find -PRON- abe get -PRON- 
get the illusion of -PRON- maybe 
a little well than metrocosmic have be film for the last few year 
and if -PRON- as good as -PRON- say well buy -PRON- and so what 
obyrne turn to -PRON- fiercely -PRON- dreamhaunte eye suddenly blaze tell -PRON- this be life as near as shadow can come too near perhaps 
move picture have to find a new name for what get 
-PRON- isnot picture -PRON- breathing living reality work over -PRON- until nothing else seem to matter nothing else seem real get -PRON- abe life shift the cigar back across -PRON- mouth and if -PRON- eye be understand -PRON- voice be only patient 
-PRON- have hear such word before from many fiercely sincere inventor 
that -PRON- have know obyrne for many year do not alter -PRON- accustomed attitude toward such thing 
all right -PRON- murmur 
show -PRON- the projection room blair 
here 
obyrne wave a thin unsteady hand toward the center of the big studio where under a battery of highhung light a bar of dull silver rise from a low platform to the height of a man waist 
beyond -PRON- against the wall bulk a big rectangular arrangement of chromium and glass behind whose face bulb be dimly visible 
silver snort 
there 
that thing look like a radio that doubledov pipe 
but the screen man the seat the tell -PRON- this be utterly new abe have to clear -PRON- mind of all -PRON- preconceive idea of what a move picture should be 
all that be obsolete from this minute on 
the move picture be as dead as the magic lantern 
this be the new thing 
these battery of light that radio as -PRON- call -PRON- the platform and bar one for each individual spectator but what be -PRON- 
what happen canot explain -PRON- to -PRON- now say obyrne impatiently 
for one thing -PRON- wouldnot believe -PRON- until after -PRON- have see -PRON- 
and -PRON- would take week to give -PRON- enough groundwork to understand the principle 
the thing too complex for anyone to explain in word 
i canot even explain the appearance except in metaphor there s never be anything like -PRON- before 
roughly though -PRON- the projection of the illusion of life on a threedimensional screen compose of fogged light 
other man be just begin to fumble around with the principle of threedimensional movie project on a flat screen give the appearance of a stage with depth go at -PRON- clumsily approach the problem from a much new angle 
-PRON- screen -PRON- be threedimensional the light that bathe -PRON- when the battery of arc be on in the midst of -PRON- the action be project on the light all around -PRON- from double film take from slightly different angle on the stereoscopic principle show -PRON- later 
and there be in that bar -PRON- be to hold on to sufficient current to stimulate very selectively the nerve which carry tactile impression to the brain feel as well as hear and see even smell 
on occasion -PRON- may actually taste -PRON- close enough to the sensation of smell to work out 
only that doesnot figure so much in this case for -PRON- as a spectator will not enter into the action simply witness -PRON- from close quarter than any audience have ever dream of do before 
here step up on the platform and take hold of the rod there at the curve -PRON- 
now hold tight and donot be surprised 
remember nothing like this have ever be do before 
ready 
abruptly the great bank of light blaze into radiance that close the dazzle silver about in soft pour brightness 
there be a quality of mistiness about -PRON- that make even -PRON- own hand invisible before -PRON- on the bar 
-PRON- be as if the light pour upon innumerable mote in the air so refract from -PRON- infinitesimal surface that nothing be visible but that shimmer of bright blindness 
silver grip the bar and wait 
through the bright fog a voice as smooth as cream speak in vast clear echo roll in from all around -PRON- at once fill the little artificial world of mist wherein -PRON- stand lost 
mellowly the deep tone say -PRON- be about to enter an enchanted wood outside athen on a midsummer night to share in a dream that shakespeare dream over three hundred year ago titania queen of faeryland will be play by anne acton 
oberon the king be philip grave abe silver clutch the bar in amazement as that unctuous voice roll on 
anne acton and philip grave be under contract to -PRON- own metrocosmic and every one of the other name be star of the first magnitude 
the great actor of the day be play in this incredible fragment of a midsummer dream 
what -PRON- have cost obyrne -PRON- shudder to think 
the creamy voice die away 
the mist begin to clear 
silver hand close hard on the bar and -PRON- stare in blank incredulity about the dim blue glade of forest stretch around -PRON- silvery in the light of a highride moon 
a breeze whisper through the leave blow cool on -PRON- face 
save that -PRON- do not stir a hair of -PRON- head -PRON- could have believe -PRON- an actual breeze sigh through the moonlit dark 
-PRON- look down 
-PRON- be -PRON- invisible disembody no longer stand on a bare floor but in the midst of a flower meadow whose grass be faintly fragrant at -PRON- foot 
there be no flicker no visible composition of the projection upon this incredible threedimensional screen that surround -PRON- 
the glade stretch away into actual distance much deep than the studio wall could possibly contain the illusion of deep starry sky overhead be perfect the flower in the grass be so real -PRON- think -PRON- could have knelt and gather -PRON- in -PRON- hand 
then under the tree the mist part like a curtain and the queen of faeryland come splendidly into the moonlit glade 
anne acton have never look so lovely 
the long veil of -PRON- silverpale hair stream like gossamer behind -PRON- and every curve and shadowy roundness be as real as life -PRON- 
yet there hover about -PRON- a hint of unreality so that -PRON- blend perfectly the illusion of fantasy and reality as -PRON- move over the unbending grass the bright wing stream from -PRON- shoulder be a blast of silvery challenge from elfin horn and into the moonlight stride oberon -PRON- lean feature wrathful 
the famous deep tone of philip grave resound angrily through the moonlight 
titania answer in silvery defiance 
then come full rich human voice ring through the wood 
phoebe templeton in rustle satin come radiantly into the glade brushing so close by the watch silver that -PRON- catch a whiff of -PRON- perfume feel the touch of -PRON- satin skirt 
and -PRON- know almost -PRON- know that -PRON- could put out a hand and stop -PRON- so warmly real be -PRON- at that close range 
-PRON- lovely throaty voice call to lysander behind -PRON- 
and then somehow the forest be slip away past abe silver face somehow -PRON- have the illusion of walk as if in a dream down an enchant forest aisle the dim air quiver with starlight and helena come run and weep through the tree stumble sob the name of demetrius 
-PRON- pass 
silver start involuntarily as from a swaying branch above -PRON- peal the wild halfhuman laughter of puck delicate as the chatter of a squirrel and down through the air over -PRON- very shoulder the breeze of -PRON- pass fan silver face the lithe little goblin spring 
the scene cloud over as if a mist have be draw across the moon 
silver blink involuntarily and when -PRON- look again titania lie exquisitely asleep on the dewspangled bank where the wild thyme grow 
then through the magichaunted wood suddenly shrill a bell 
insistently metallically -PRON- ring 
silver glance about the glade of the forest try to locate among the dewshimmering leave the source of that irritate noise 
and suddenly the athenian wood melt like smoke about -PRON- 
incredulously -PRON- stare around a big bare studio 
-PRON- be like wake in bewilderment from a dream so vivid that reality -PRON- pale beside -PRON- memory 
the studio want -PRON- on the telephone abe say voice 
here wake up -PRON- hear the bell shake -PRON- laugh sheepishly still in athen -PRON- admit blink the damnedest thing i ever studio do -PRON- say the phone 
thinly over the wire come a worried voice 
hate to bother -PRON- chief but i think -PRON- ought to know 
anne be mumble around in a sort of daze for half an hour 
the doctor canot do a thing with -PRON- 
and philip grave pass out on set and be just kind of whisper to -PRON- poetry -PRON- sound like 
silver blink let the paper get -PRON- be right over 
-PRON- slam the telephone back on -PRON- cradle and turn blankly to obyrne go wrong with a couple of -PRON- actor -PRON- steal -PRON- say get to get back right away 
but listen blair -PRON- have get something how long will -PRON- take -PRON- to have some more of these bar and platform arrangement rig up 
say a dozen for a starter like to have -PRON- board see -PRON- as soon as possible 
this be go to be the most tremendous thing that ever happen in motion picture 
when can -PRON- have thing ready to show the board 
i donot know abe 
somehow a little afraid of -PRON- 
afraid 
good god man what do -PRON- mean donot know exactly but do -PRON- have a feeling as -PRON- watch the action that somehow -PRON- come too near to life 
blair afraid -PRON- have be work too hard on this 
let -PRON- handle -PRON- from now on will -PRON- 
and stop think about -PRON- get to get back to the studio now and see what s happen to -PRON- actor attack of temperament probably but see -PRON- tonight about quantity production 
until then -PRON- wonot let anyone else in on this will -PRON- 
-PRON- know i wonot abe -PRON- if -PRON- want -PRON- 
all the way back to the studio silver mind be spin with the magnitude of what lie before -PRON- 
-PRON- have dare to let the inventor know how enormously impressed -PRON- be how anxious to have the new process because -PRON- know obyrne so well 
the man be wealthy in -PRON- own right indifferent to fame to everything but the deep need to create which have drive -PRON- so hard for so many year toward the completion of -PRON- miracle 
miracle in three dimension 
-PRON- seem like a dream what -PRON- have just see but behind -PRON- lie the prospect for a fortune vaster than any movie magnate have ever dare to hope for 
to control this be to control the whole world 
silver clench -PRON- cigar tight and dream magnificent dream 
anne acton lie on a low couch in -PRON- lavish little dressing bungalow stare up with conscious pathos into the doctor face as silver come into the room 
somehow illogically -PRON- be a shock to -PRON- to see -PRON- here when -PRON- have so short a time before leave that perfect illusion of -PRON- in the enchanted wood outside athen asleep on the bank of wild thyme 
how be -PRON- anne -PRON- demand anxiously for -PRON- represent a fabulous sum to the company and an illness now in the midst of -PRON- late picture would be ruinous

when do -PRON- come out of -PRON- 
while -PRON- be phone -PRON- abe say acton -PRON- in a faint pathetic voice move -PRON- head uneasily so that the great slip rope of silverpale hair move across the brocade

suddenly i feel too tired to move as if all the strength have drain right out of -PRON- 
and i must have faint but i wasnot really out

abe silver lose no time in call a meeting of the board 
the twelve member of metrocosmic stand about in two and three murmur incredulously in the shadow of the obyrne studio on the night when the first dozen barplatform be erect 
silver have not dare to describe fully this modern miracle like nothing -PRON- ever see before -PRON- warn -PRON- as rather sheepishly -PRON- allow -PRON- to be herd forward to the platform 
when -PRON- be all at -PRON- station and silver signal obyrne to begin -PRON- glance once around the little company before the light blaze on doubtfully -PRON- return -PRON- stare with a murmur or two of protest rise 
feel so damn silly an official say stand here 
mean to say there isnot any screen 
what be -PRON- suppose to look at then like a wall of brilliant blindness the foggy light close down upon -PRON- and every man be cut off from -PRON- fellow so that -PRON- stand alone and disembody in the heart of that soft misty blaze 
startled exclamation sound through the mist murmur that die away as silver hear for the second time the creamy smoothness of the announcer voice roll through the dim brightness 
-PRON- be now about to enter an enchanted wood outside athen on a midsummer night to share in a dream that shakespeare dream somehow as the play go on abe silver begin to wonder a little uneasily at the violence of the quarrel between titania and oberon that flame almost tangibly through the clear dim air 
have -PRON- fight before so fiercely 
have -PRON- a gibber of wild inhuman laughter the long leap of puck over -PRON- shoulder break the queer thought halfforme just as a bell begin to shrill through the forest 
-PRON- know a moment of unreality 
-PRON- remember that in the previous performance the bell have not ring until titania lie down to sleep on the bank where the wild thyme grow 
but with shock completeness the forest vanish 
silver stare blankly around the studio reach that have so suddenly replace the glade of faeryland blink at the circle of dazed man in amazement 
telephone for -PRON- abe voice call through the fade mist of the dream that have so strongly grip -PRON- 
-PRON- grin sheepishly and step down from the platform 
listen chief babble a distressed voice over the wire shrill above the rise babble of delight behind silver out like a light at the grove be -PRON- plaster donot think so but try to tell the paper that 
-PRON- wait oh -PRON- s just come out of -PRON- -PRON- do 
send -PRON- home sigh silver get onto the paper right away a life turn back to obyrne with a shrug pass out again -PRON- murmur unhappily wonder if -PRON- well if -PRON- fold now in the middle of never tomorrow well lose -PRON- shirt on -PRON- go to get a doctor to abe say obyrne in a voice so quiet that the other man turn to -PRON- in surprise abe do -PRON- realize that every time -PRON- run this picture anne acton faint 
i wonder if the other actor feel the same reaction 
why what do -PRON- mean 
why should -PRON- 
blair be -PRON- go crazy 
silver voice be stoutly confident but despite -PRON- an uneasy little flicker woke in -PRON- mind 
philip grave who play oberon have be daze and out of -PRON- head too that other time 
and yes hadnot -PRON- notice an item in a gossip column say that phoebe templeton have collapse at a tea in new york 
be -PRON- the same day 
rather terrifyingly -PRON- think -PRON- be 
but of course all this be the most flagrant nonsense 
-PRON- job now be to keep acton out of the paper 
-PRON- have not endear -PRON- to reporter and -PRON- know -PRON- would make the story sound as bad as possible 
-PRON- the phone rejig again wire from philip grave man have just come in abe -PRON- wifes voice tell -PRON- worriedly be take terribly sick on shipboard 
-PRON- man say -PRON- will be in all the paper tomorrow and -PRON- want -PRON- advice 
silver run a hand distractedly through -PRON- hair 
thanks -PRON- say a little blankly take care of -PRON- 
be home later 
-PRON- turn to the man still group around the barplatform in -PRON- babble of amazed delight 
-PRON- have not hear -PRON- lowvoiced conversation at the desk get this fellow under contract havenot -PRON- say someone anxiously at -PRON- elbow 
ought to get go on production right away 
this be the most tremendous thing that ever happen 
yes hell let -PRON- have -PRON- silver tell -PRON- abstractedly 
blair how s the production on the first hundred barplatform come get to give a large show right away hundred and fifty will be ready in about a week obyrne admit reluctantly 
but abe abe do -PRON- think -PRON- ought to do -PRON- 
silver pull -PRON- aside 
look blair -PRON- say gently -PRON- mustnot let -PRON- imagination run away with -PRON- 
what possible connection can there be between the showing of this picture and the fact that a few overwork nervous people have fainting spell admit -PRON- a coincidence but -PRON- have get to be sensible 
-PRON- canot let the big thing that ever happen in picture slip through -PRON- finger just because some dizzy actress pass out once or twice 
obyrne shrug a little wonder -PRON- murmur as if think aloud how long people have be try to create life always prevent -PRON- no one be allow to succeed 
this thing of mine isnot life but -PRON- too near -PRON- to leave -PRON- at peace with -PRON- 
i think there s a penalty for usurp the power of godhead for come too close to success afraid abe 
blair will -PRON- do -PRON- a favor demand silver 
will -PRON- go to bed and forget all about this until morning see -PRON- tomorrow 
right now up to -PRON- neck in trouble 
obyrne smile ghostily 
all right -PRON- say 
that be the headline the newsboy be yell when silver step out of -PRON- car the next day 
-PRON- look twice at the headline to be sure for the romance of phoebe templeton not with bill frederick but with manfield drake have keep screen magazine in ecstasy for the past six month 
the wedding be to have be this week but -PRON- buy a paper hastily a wild thought flash through -PRON- mind 
templeton and frederick have play the lover in photoplay 
bill and have know one another for about six month phoebe templeton be quote as say but -PRON- never realize until last night how much -PRON- mean to each other 
-PRON- happen rather miraculously 
i be on -PRON- way west and bill be in hollywood 
and suddenly in denver -PRON- come over -PRON- that i simply must talk to -PRON- 
i phone long distance and well -PRON- all pretty hazy to look back on but i charter a plane and meet -PRON- in yuma and -PRON- be marry this morning 
of course i feel badly about manfield but really this be too big to fight against know since ten oclock last night that -PRON- be mean for each other 
silver tuck the paper under -PRON- arm and bite down hard on -PRON- cigar 
-PRON- be at ten last night that -PRON- have watch hermia and lysander in the actual breathing presence of templeton and frederick murmur passionate love under a highfloate moon 
for a moment a fantastic wonder cross -PRON- mind must be go nut -PRON- murmur to -PRON- 
a week later an audience of a hundred and fifty people gather for the real preview of midsummer dream 
the barplatform have be set up in the big studio that have see the first running of the miraculous illusion 
-PRON- be crowd now with murmurous and skeptical people officer and director of metrocosmic a sprinkling of wife 
silver conquer an inexplicable uneasiness as -PRON- seek obyrne in a corner near the control 
blair be sit on a heavy stool before the machine and the face -PRON- turn to -PRON- friend be full of a queer strained tension 
-PRON- say -PRON- voice a thread of sound abe have the mad notion that every time i show this the figure come back realer than before into the scene -PRON- play 
maybe -PRON- donot always hold to the action -PRON- photograph maybe the plot carry -PRON- on beyond what shakespeare write more violently than finger grip the other man shoulder hard 
sharply -PRON- shake -PRON- an absurd uneasiness darken -PRON- memory of that impression of fiercer violence in the quarrel between oberon and titania the last time -PRON- see the play even as -PRON- say firmly snap out of -PRON- blair be work too hard 
maybe someone else could run the picture tonight -PRON- need rest 
obyrne look up at -PRON- apathetically -PRON- alarm go suddenly flat 
no do -PRON- 
if -PRON- be really determined to run the thing maybe well 
maybe i can control -PRON- better than an assistant could 
after all i create -PRON- 
silver look down at -PRON- for a moment in frown silence 
then -PRON- shrug and turn toward the last empty barplatform where the audience wait the beginning of the show 
obyrne be dangerously overwork -PRON- tell -PRON- 
after this be over -PRON- must go to a sanatorium for a long rest 
-PRON- mind be crack 
misty radiance close down about -PRON- veil the hundred and fifty from -PRON- vision 
there be a moment of murmurous wonder punctuate by small halffrightene scream from a few of the woman as each spectator be shut off into a little world of silence and solitude 
into the silvery mist that familiar rich voice roll smoothly 
for the third time silver see the broad gray glade of faeryland hedge with immemorial forest opening magically up about -PRON- 
for the third time titania trail -PRON- stream wing into the moonlight 
oberon strode with a jingle of mail from among the tree and -PRON- meet in fury halfway down the glade -PRON- foot press the bend grass with elfin lightness 
but there be no lightness in -PRON- anger 
that ancient quarrel flare up in violence between -PRON- and the breeze shiver with -PRON- wrath 
again hermia and lysander come half laugh half fearful into the wood 
again helena sobbed demetrius name among the unanswering tree 
puck flit in goblin glee about -PRON- business of enchantment and titania lie down to sleep on the spangle grass among the wild thyme time no telephone bell break into the magic of the dream 
and again these be live people who move so tangibly before the audience the wind of -PRON- passing brush -PRON- the sound of -PRON- breathing in -PRON- ear when -PRON- stand near go about -PRON- magichaunted way as obliviously as if the spectator be the phantom not -PRON- 
-PRON- love and hate and heartbreak be vividly real under that incredibly real moon 
once or twice silver think vaguely that here and there in the action thing happen not exactly as -PRON- remember -PRON- 
have titania actually slap dark angry face before -PRON- sweep out of the glade 
have hermia and lysander kiss quite so lingeringly under that deepshadowe oak 
but as the play go on silver lose all thought of time that have go before and sink fathom deep in the reality of the scene before -PRON- 
puck lure the spellbewildere lover into the fastness of the forest 
-PRON- go stumble through the fog quarrel blind by mist and magic and -PRON- own troubled heart 
sword flash in the moonlight 
lysander and demetrius be fight among the veiled tree 
puck laugh shrill and high and inhuman and sweep -PRON- brown arm down 
and from lysander come a choke gasp the clatter of a fallen sword 
demetrius bend fiercely above -PRON- 
silver watch the bright blood bubble from -PRON- side see the blade drip darkly smell the acrid sharpness of that spread stain 
the illusion be marvelous death be a miracle of artistry from the first choke gasp of pain to the last bubbling of blood in -PRON- throat the last twist of handsome silksheathed limb death something trouble silver memory but before -PRON- could capture -PRON- a woman voice cry hysterically somewhere in the misty forest dead -PRON- s dead and suddenly blankly the forest be go from about -PRON- and -PRON- be stare into dazed halfdreaming face where an instant before faeryland have stretch depth upon depth of moonlit dimness where lysander have lie die on the moss 
somewhere in the crowd a woman be sob hysterically dead i tell -PRON- dead and -PRON- doesnot really die in the play kill -PRON- 
that be real blood i smell -PRON- 
oh get -PRON- out of this awful place 
silver brush the fog of dreamland from -PRON- eye and be halfway across the floor to the projection machine before the scream have end for -PRON- remember now that tug of memory as lysander fall play be romance not tragedy 
lysander should not have die 
obyrne clung to -PRON- high stool -PRON- finger whiteknuckle as -PRON- stare into silver eye 
-PRON- see -PRON- say in a strained monotone 
-PRON- see what mass hypnotism will do 
-PRON- couldnot help -PRON- poor thing -PRON- must be half alive wandering in the fog 
blair 
silver voice rang sharply 
blair snap out of -PRON- 
what be -PRON- rave about 
be -PRON- mad 
the stare eye turn to -PRON- almost apathetically be afraid say obyrne in that whisper monotone as if -PRON- speak in a dream be afraid to run -PRON- before this many people i should have guess what would happen when acton and grave and be -PRON- still harp on that coincidence demand silver in a fierce undertone -PRON- see how foolish -PRON- be blair what earthly african savage tibetan nomad chinese peasant south american indian 
even the ancient egyptian highly civilized as -PRON- be deliberately make -PRON- drawing angular and unlifelike 
all of -PRON- declare and believe that too good a likeness would draw the soul out into the picture 
well yes everybodys hear of such thing but -PRON- be not suggest after the templeton elopement after anne a complete booklength novel of a war between world by and many other unusual story and feature ome in the may issue of -PRON- companion scientifiction magazine 15c connection can there be between picture on a screen and live people some of -PRON- half the world away admit what happen tonight be do -PRON- ever hear break in blair softly as if -PRON- be follow some private train of thought and have not heed a word of silver harangue of savage cover -PRON- face when explorer bring out -PRON- camera 
-PRON- think a photograph will steal -PRON- soul an idea so widespread that -PRON- canot have originate in mere local superstition 
tribe all over the world have -PRON- and philip grave illness yes after what happen tonight how can -PRON- deny -PRON- abe 
no the egyptian the modern savage be close to the truth than -PRON- 
only before now no likeness have be perfect enough to absorb sufficient personality so that people could notice -PRON- 
but these illusion of mine -PRON- be real live breathing 
while -PRON- watch -PRON- canot believe the actual man and woman arenot stand in front of -PRON- 
-PRON- have an effect on acton and grave when only -PRON- be watch enough of -PRON- personality be drain out of -PRON- into the illusion by -PRON- own temporary conviction that -PRON- be there so that -PRON- go into vague dream of woodland and music 
i donot know how the other actor be affect i do know that several of -PRON- be sick and dizzy that day 
i havenot check maybe be afraid to 
when the twelve boardmember be watch the drain be strong so that grave be really ill on shipboard and acton couldnot be rouse from -PRON- faint until the telephone call to -PRON- break the illusion here 
-PRON- affect templeton and bill frederick another way hypnotize -PRON- into believe what the audience be believe that -PRON- be really in love flood into silver mind 
-PRON- remember what -PRON- have feel when -PRON- read the headline of the elopement 
-PRON- say -PRON- happen that way blair 
how greatly could a mass mind affect the reaction of the people -PRON- concentrate on 
i think of -PRON- before if twelve individual each convince for a time that -PRON- see two people desperately in love may really work a sort of persuasion on those two no that s crazy -PRON- couldnot happen 
-PRON- see -PRON- happen murmured blair quietly 
-PRON- see what happen when a hundred and fifty people join in that fierce concentration that utter conviction that -PRON- see a man sword poise aim descend mass hypnotism -PRON- be 
for a majority of -PRON- that sword really strike -PRON- imagination outran the actual fact and -PRON- think -PRON- see lysander spit on demetrius blade 
-PRON- think -PRON- see -PRON- die 
well -PRON- didnot do -PRON- 
i mean nothing happen this time or -PRON- would have call -PRON- 
a thin smile twist up strained mouth 
-PRON- reach behind -PRON- 
silver hear a click and realise that the telephone have be lie out of -PRON- cradle on the desk ever since -PRON- reach side want -PRON- to understand before -PRON- break the news to -PRON- obyrne be explain gently 
and i know the telephone would interrupt ime unless i shrill buzz whir from the desk 
with a little spurt of terror for what -PRON- have yet to learn silver snatch -PRON- up 
a voice shout thinly in -PRON- ear silver 
be that -PRON- chief 
-PRON- god be try to get -PRON- all evening be in a coma for over an hour doctor canot rouse -PRON- 
and a call just come in from london that phil grave be out too canot be wake 
and what s that 
what 
chief just come in that pass out too and bill frederick have drop dead the matter with this town like the end of the world abe voice behind -PRON- twist silver around like a hand on -PRON- shoulder 
the receiver shrill unnoticed as -PRON- eye meet face be almost serene knowledge of what the telephone be cry show in -PRON- eye 
-PRON- say do -PRON- believe -PRON- now 
do -PRON- understand 
do -PRON- realize how much of life -PRON- weave into this damnable thing make 
yes -PRON- like twodimensional picture that carry a shadow of the third enough dark to give a feeling of depth 
in -PRON- threedimensional picture somehow get a shadow of the fourth life maybe or something too near -PRON- 
maybe that s what the fourth dimension be life -PRON- 
but -PRON- wonot kill man again not again crash of glass shatter into the hysterical buzz of the crowd 
silence like death fall over the confusion of the murmurous throng among the barplatform as -PRON- turn white face toward the corner frail arm swing -PRON- heavy stool with desperate strength crunch and smashing and crash among the delicate intricacy of -PRON- projector 
silver clutch the still shrill telephone and watch -PRON- not move 
a question of identity no pang of hunger nor torment of thirst can stifle the question of who where and what 
by author of the jewel etc be lead 
-PRON- that move like sluggish quicksilheart be a great coil ver back and forth in burn wave clock that throb rather than tick ever so slowly 
-PRON- lung be metal sponge -PRON- head a bronze bowl fill with molt lava back and forth consciousness and unconsciousness interplaye against a background of slow dark pain 
i feel just that nothing more 
i be in a in a wooden coffin have a heart lung body head but i feel nothing external that be -PRON- body do not impinge on anything 
i be not sit or stand or walk or lie or do anything that i could feel 
i be just heart lung body head alone in darkness that be fill with the pulsing of a muted agony 
this be -PRON- 
but who be the thought come the first real thought for before that have be only an awareness of be 
now i wonder as to the nature of -PRON- being 
who be i be a man 
the word man arouse certain association which struggle through the pain through the thump heart and gasping lung sensation 
if i be a man what be i do 
where be in response to the thought awareness increase 
i have a body and therefore i possess hand ear eye 
i must try to feel hear see 
but i could not 
-PRON- arm be lump of immovable iron 
-PRON- ear know only the sound of silence and the throbbing that come from within -PRON- tortured body 
-PRON- eye be seal by the leaden weight of enormous eyelid 
this i know and feel panic 
what have happen 
what be wrong with -PRON- 
why couldnot i feel and hear and see 
i have be in an accident and i be lie on a hospital bed under ether 
that be one explanation 
perhaps i have be cripple blind deafen maim 
only -PRON- soul exist faintly like a whispering that rustle through the ruin of an old old house 
but what accident 
where have i be before this 
i must have live 
what be -PRON- name i resign -PRON- to the darkness as i strove to grapple with these problem and the darkness be kind 
-PRON- body and the darkness seem to be equally detach so that -PRON- mingle 
-PRON- be peaceful too peaceful for the thought that throb through -PRON- brain 
the thought fight and clamor and finally scream until i feel -PRON- awaken 
-PRON- be the sensation i vaguely recall of find one foot asleep 
-PRON- spread over -PRON- body so that a pleasant tingling make -PRON- aware bit by bit of have definite arm and hand definite chest and pelvi definite leg and foot 
-PRON- outline emerge and be define by that tingle 
a burring droned in -PRON- spine as though a dentist drill have bite into -PRON- 
simultaneously i become aware that -PRON- heart be a congo drum within -PRON- chest -PRON- lung great gourd swell and sink in frantic rhythm 
i exult in the pain for through -PRON- i feel -PRON- 
that sensation of detachment fade and i know that i complete intact lie against softness 
but where 
that be the next question and sudden energy seem ready to solve -PRON- 
-PRON- eye open 
-PRON- encounter nothing but a continuation of the blackness which lurk behind the curtain of closed lid 
if anything the blackness be deep rich 
i could see nothing of -PRON- and yet -PRON- eye be open 
be i blind 
-PRON- ear still hear no sound other than the mysterious inspiration of -PRON- own breath 
-PRON- hand move ever so slowly at -PRON- side rustle against cloth which tell -PRON- that -PRON- limb be clothe and yet unblanketed 
-PRON- move upward outward 
an inch two inch three and then -PRON- encounter hard unyielding surface on either side 
-PRON- rise upward prompt by fear 
six inch and another unyielde surface of wood 
-PRON- foot thrust out as i stretch and through shoeleath the tip of -PRON- toe encounter wood 
-PRON- mouth open and a sound pour forth 
-PRON- be only a rattle though i have mean to scream 
for -PRON- thought whirl around one name one name that somehow grope through a haze and loom as the symbol of -PRON- unreasoning fear 
i know a name and i want to scream 
edgar allan poe 
and then -PRON- rattle voice of pere unprompted that which i so fear in connection with this name 
the premature burial i whisper 
poe write -PRON- 
i be live -PRON- 
i be in a coffin in a wooden coffin with the hot stale air of -PRON- own corruption reek in -PRON- nostril burn in -PRON- lung 
i be in a coffin lock in earth and yet i be alive 
then i find strength 
-PRON- hand have be frantically scratch and claw at the surface above -PRON- head 
now -PRON- grip the side of -PRON- prison and thrust outward with all strength -PRON- leg brace at the foot of the box 
-PRON- leg then kick 
new vigor the vigor of a madman rush through -PRON- boil blood 
in sheer frenzy in an agony bear of the fact that i could not scream and give expression to -PRON- i lash out with both foot at the bottom of the coffin feel -PRON- splinter and give way 
then the side crack -PRON- bleed finger clutch at the earth beyond and i roll over burrow and scrabble at the moist softpacke earth 
i dig upwards wheeze in a sort of mindless desperation as i work 
instinct alone combat the insane horror which grip -PRON- being and transform -PRON- into the activity which alone could save -PRON- 
-PRON- must have bury -PRON- in a hurry 
the earth above -PRON- grave be shallow 
choking and half suffocate i claw -PRON- way to the top after endless eon of utter delirium during which the dust of the grave cover -PRON- and i wriggle like a worm through the dark ground 
-PRON- hand reach up to form a cavity then i lunge upward with full strength and burst through to the surface 
i crawl out into silvery moonlight flood down upon a world of marble toadstool which sprout richly from the mound of grass all about -PRON- 
some of the fantastic stone growth be crossshape other bear head or great urnlike mouth 
-PRON- be the headstone of grave naturally but i see only toadstool fat bloated toadstool of deadwhite pallor reach unthinkable root into the ground below to draw forth nourishment 
i lay stare at -PRON- stare back at the pit through which i have come up out of death into life once again 
i do not could not think 
the word edgar allan poe and premature burial have come unbidden to -PRON- brain and now for some reason i find -PRON- whisper in a hoarse dreadful voice then croon more loudly lazarus 
lazarus 
lazarus -PRON- pant subside and i draw fresh strength from the air that sing through -PRON- lung 
i stare at the grave again -PRON- grave 
-PRON- bear no headstone 
-PRON- be a poor grave in a poor section of the cemetery probably a field 
nearly on the outskirt of the necropolis -PRON- be and weed writhe over the poor grave 
there be no headstone and -PRON- make -PRON- remember -PRON- question 
who be i -PRON- be a unique problem 
i have be someone before i die but who 
surely this be a novel case of amnesia to return to a new life in the actual sense of the phrase 
who be funny i could think of word like amnesia and yet could not in the least associate -PRON- with anything personal in -PRON- past 
-PRON- mind be utterly blank 
do death do this to -PRON- 
be -PRON- permanent or would -PRON- mind awaken in a few hour just as -PRON- body have 
if not i be in sore strait 
i didnot know -PRON- name or -PRON- station what i have be 
for that matter on reflection i didnot even know where i be 
the name of city flood foolishly through -PRON- brain 
chicago milwaukee los angele washington bombay shanghai cleveland chichen itza pernambuco angkor wat rome omsk carthage 
i could not associate a single one with -PRON- or for that matter explain how i know those name 
i think of street of mariposa boulevard and michigan avenue and broadway and center street and park lane and the champ elysee 
-PRON- mean nothing to -PRON- 
i think of proper name 
felix kennaston ben blue ralph waldo emerson stud lonigan arthur gordon pym jame gordon bennett samuel butler igor stravinsky and -PRON- represent no image of -PRON- 
i could see all those street visualize all those people picture all those city but -PRON- i could not associate with any of -PRON- 
comedy tragedy drama -PRON- be a mad scene to play in a cemetery at nightfall 
i have crawl out of a grave without a headstone and all i know be that i be a man 
and yet who 
-PRON- eye rove over -PRON- person lie in the grass 
beneath mud and dirt i see a dark suit tear in place and discolor 
-PRON- cover the body of a tall man a thin body poorly muscle and flatcheste 
-PRON- hand rustle over -PRON- person be long and leanly muscular -PRON- be not the hand of a labourer 
of -PRON- face i know nothing though i pass -PRON- hand over each feature in turn 
one thing i feel certain oft whatever the cause of -PRON- apparent death i be not physically maim prompt -PRON- to rise 
i rise to -PRON- foot stumble over the grass 
for a few minute i have that drunken float sensation but gradually the ground become solid under -PRON- foot i know awareness of the cool night wind on -PRON- forehead hear with indescribable joy the chirping of cricket from a swamp afar 
i walk around the tombstone gaze at the cloud sky feel dew and dampness fall 
but -PRON- brain be aloof detach wrestling with invisible demon of doubt 
who be what be i to do 
i could not wander strange street in -PRON- disheveled condition 
if i present -PRON- to authority i would be put away as a madman 
besides i do not want to see anyone 
this fact i realize quite suddenly 
i do not wish to see light or people 
i be different 
-PRON- be the feeling of death 
be i still 
unable to bear the thought i frantically grope for clue 
i try every mean of awaken dormant memory 
walk endlessly the night through combat chaos and confusion fight the gray cloud that clung to -PRON- brain i wander up and down the deserted corner of the cemetery 
exhausted i stare at a lightened sky 
and then -PRON- thought flee away even the confused one 
i know only one thing the need for rest and peace and forgetfulness 
be -PRON- the deathurge 
have i rise from the grave only to return 
i neither know nor care 
actuate by a compulsion as inexplicable as -PRON- be overpower i stumble toward the ruin of -PRON- grave and creep inside burrow like a mole into the grateful darkness whilst the earth tumble in behind -PRON- 
there be enough air the thought come to enable -PRON- to breathe while i lie back in the shatter coffin 
-PRON- head fall back and i settle in -PRON- coffin to sleep 
the muttering and rumbling die away from dream i could not remember 
-PRON- die away from dream and grow in reality until i sit up push wet earth so that -PRON- fall around -PRON- 
i be in the grave 
again terror 
somehow the hope have lurk that this be a dream and awakening may bring -PRON- to grateful reality 
but i be in the grave and a storm howl above 
i crawl upward 
-PRON- be still night or rather instinct prompt -PRON- to believe that -PRON- be night again 
i must have sleep the clock around 
this storm have keep people from the graveyard keep -PRON- from discover the torn earth and -PRON- inmate 
i rise to the surface and the rain lash -PRON- from sky wild with anger 
and yet i be happy happy for the life i know 
i drink the rain the thunder enrapture -PRON- as though -PRON- be a symphony i marvel at the lightning emerald beauty 
i be alive all about -PRON- corpse rot and a sloughed nor could all the fury of the unleashed element imbue -PRON- with one spark of existence or of memory 
-PRON- own poor thought -PRON- own poor life be infinitely precious in comparison to the lot of those below 
i have cheat worm and maggot let the storm howl 
i would howl with -PRON- share in the cosmic jest 
vitalize in the true sense of the word i begin to walk 
the rain wash the earthstain from -PRON- garment and body 
singularly i feel no cold no especial dampness 
i be aware of these thing but -PRON- do not seem to penetrate 
for the first time i realize another odd thing i be not hungry or thirsty 
at least i do not seem to be 
have appetite die with memory 
i wonder 
memory the problem of identity still press 
i walk along impel by the storm 
still ponder -PRON- foot carry -PRON- past the confine of the cemetery 
the gale lead -PRON- seem to guide -PRON- footstep out onto the stone sidewalk of a desert street 
i walk almost without heed 
who be how have i die 
how revive i walk through the rain down the dark street alone in the wet velvet of the night 
who be how have i die 
how revive i cross a block enter a narrow street still stumble alone with the wind and the laugh of thunder from cloud mock -PRON- bewilderment 
who be i know 
-PRON- name the street tell -PRON- 
summit street 
who live on summit street 
arthur derwin -PRON- 
i be arthur derwin of summit street 
i use to be something i couldnot remember 
i have live live for year and yet all i could recall be -PRON- name 
how have i die 
i have be to the seance and the light be out and mrs price be call to someone 
-PRON- have scream something about evil influence and then the light have go on 
-PRON- hadnot go on 
but -PRON- must have 
-PRON- have but i wasnot there 
i have die 
die in the darkness at the seance 
what kill -PRON- 
shock perhaps 
and then what happen 
mrs price have hush -PRON- up 
i be alone in the city i have be bury hurriedly in a pauper grave 
heart failure the coroner have probably call -PRON- 
i be lay away 
that be -PRON- 
and yet i be arthur derwin and surely somebody have care 
bramin street say the sign in the lightning 
bramin street someone have care viola 
viola have be -PRON- fiancee 
-PRON- have love arthur derwin 
what be -PRON- last name 
where have i meet -PRON- 
what do -PRON- look like 
bramin street 
again the sign 
unconsciously -PRON- foot seem to have lead -PRON- down this way 
i be walk down bramin street without think in the storm 
very well 
i would let -PRON- foot lead the way 
i wouldnot think 
-PRON- foot would take -PRON- to home through habit 
there i would learn 
no thinking now 
just walk through the storm -PRON- eye close to the blackness through which thunder beat 
i walk out of death and i be hungry now 
i be hungry and thirsty here in the night and i be hungry to see viola and thirsty for -PRON- lip 
i have come back from death for -PRON- or be that too poetic 
i come from the grave and go back to sleep in -PRON- and rise again and seek the world without memory 
-PRON- be gruesome and grim and macabre 
i die at a seance 
-PRON- foot plod slop through rain 
i feel no cold no wet 
i be warm inside warm with the memory of viola -PRON- lip -PRON- hair 
-PRON- be a blonde i remember 
-PRON- hair be coil sunlight -PRON- eye blue and deep as the sea -PRON- skin the milky whiteness of a unicorn flank 
i have tell -PRON- so i recall when i have hold -PRON- in -PRON- arm 
i know -PRON- mouth as a scarlet gate to ecstasy 
-PRON- be the hunger within -PRON- -PRON- the burn beacon of desire that lead -PRON- back through mist of memory to -PRON- door 
i be pant and do not know -PRON- 
within -PRON- revolve a wheel that have once be -PRON- brain and be now just a grind round screen flash kaleidoscopic image of viola of the grave of a seance and evil presence and inexplicable death 
viola have be interested in mysticism i have be interested in the occult -PRON- go to the seance 
mrs price be a famous medium 
i die at the seance and wake up in a grave 
i come back to see viola 
i come back to find out about -PRON- 
i know now what i be how i have die 
but how revive 
but bow revive 
bramin street 
foot plod 
and then instinct turn -PRON- foot up the pathway to the porch 
-PRON- be instinct which cause -PRON- hand to fumble for the familiar doorknob without knock instinct which lead -PRON- across the threshold 
i in a hallway a deserted hallway 
there be a mirror there and for the first time i could see -PRON- 
perhaps that would shock -PRON- into complete remembrance and recognition 
i look but the mirror fade before -PRON- gaze into a blur 
i feel weak dazed 
but -PRON- be due to the hunger within -PRON- the hunger which burn 
-PRON- be late 
viola wouldnot be downstairs 
-PRON- would be in -PRON- bedroom at this hour 
i go up the stair dripping water at every step walk quite silently aside from the little dripping patter of rill run down to the stair below 
all at once giddiness leave -PRON- again and i feel strong 
i have the feeling that i be ascend the stair to destiny as though once i reach the top i would know the truth of -PRON- fate 
something have bring -PRON- from the grave here 
something lie behind this mysterious resurrection 
the answer lie above 
i reach the top turn down the dark familiar hall 
the bedroom door open beneath -PRON- hand 
a candle burn at the bedside nothing more 
and i see viola lie there 
-PRON- sleep incarnate beauty sleep 
-PRON- be very young and lovely at that moment and i feel pity for -PRON- at what -PRON- must know upon awakening 
i call softly 
viola 
i call softly and while i do so -PRON- brain say the last of the three question over and over 
and how revive say -PRON- brain 
viola call -PRON- voice 
-PRON- open -PRON- eye allow life to flood -PRON- 
-PRON- see -PRON- 
arthur -PRON- gasp dead -PRON- be a scream that last yes i say softly 
why do i say yes 
i wonder 
and -PRON- brain whisper and how revive -PRON- rise up shudder dead a ghost 
-PRON- bury -PRON- 
mrs price be afraid 
-PRON- die at the seance 
go away arthur -PRON- be dead -PRON- moan -PRON- over and over 
i look at -PRON- beauty and know hunger 
a thousand memory of that last evening come to -PRON- 
the seance and mrs price warning of evil spirit the coldness which have grip -PRON- in the darkness and -PRON- sudden sinking into oblivion 
then this wakening and -PRON- search for viola to appease -PRON- hunger 
not for food 
not for drink 
not for love 
a new hunger 
a new hunger know only at night a new hunger that make -PRON- shun man and forget -PRON- former self 
a new hunger that hate mirror 
a hunger for viola 
i move toward -PRON- very slowly and -PRON- wet graveclothe rustle as i reach out -PRON- hand reassuringly and take -PRON- in -PRON- arm 
i be sorry for -PRON- just for an instant then the hunger come strong and i bend -PRON- head 
the last question ring in -PRON- brain once again 
and how revive 
the seance the threat of evil spirit answer that question 
i answer -PRON- -PRON- 
i know why i have rise from the grave and who and what i be as i take viola in -PRON- arm 
i take viola in -PRON- arm and -PRON- tooth meet in -PRON- throat 
that answer the question 
i be a vampire 
bottom pool what the fisher what the bait 
martin aylethorp plumb the depth 
author of liquid life major vision etc be stupid of -PRON- to write this with the intention of save -PRON- life 
of course i shall be threaten with a murder charge but -PRON- shall never be able to produce the body 
consequently -PRON- must eventually set -PRON- free 
but there be a possibility that i may be hold for a sanity hearing 
for that reason i must pen this account and attach -PRON- to the other paper 
-PRON- may serve to convince the official at the investigation 
and those official must be convince 
-PRON- must be convince because there be a deed which -PRON- must do 
-PRON- be imperative that -PRON- heed -PRON- plea and board up the bottomless pool in the swamp beyond wood 
-PRON- must board up the pool and drain the bogland fence -PRON- off if -PRON- can not destroy -PRON- 
otherwise there will be further tragedy this i swear be true 
and until that black pool be board over i shall never find the solace of sound sleep but will i slide foot foremost into the stygian water tinue to dream of that thing in the swamp the dark thing that take the life of -PRON- friend martin aylethorp 
there be a time when i know peace the mockery 
-PRON- friend martin have be in a slump period -PRON- write for a living and i invite -PRON- east for the sole reason that i think -PRON- would find a soothing tranquillity at -PRON- home 
-PRON- cottage be near mill brook just outside of concord 
martin i reason would enjoy tramp in wood and in the fall the new england countryside take on a mellow beauty most conducive to ease shatter nerve 
i recall -PRON- preparation for -PRON- come -PRON- seem like a grim joke 
i be so careful in rig up -PRON- room to insure -PRON- quiet i even send into town for a noiseless portable to replace -PRON- regular typewriter 
for when martin arrive in late august -PRON- be a sick man 
-PRON- tall normally lean figure be now emaciate -PRON- eye be sink behind -PRON- spectacle and the smile i have remember as habitual upon -PRON- countenance seem drown by inward melancholy 
-PRON- smoke too much and when -PRON- hold a cigarette the gray spiral rise from the tip unevenly because of the trembling of -PRON- hand 
i do -PRON- good to conceal -PRON- concern over -PRON- change appearance 
-PRON- have be work on a novel and try to hold down a librarian job during the day 
i gather that -PRON- be completely do in and have lately find be impossible to continue with -PRON- short story work 
-PRON- be amazing what creative effort can do to a man of peculiar temperament -PRON- be drain dry suck of all vitality as though -PRON- night have be give over to visit from a vampire or succubus rather than write 
-PRON- isnot a bad comparison for martin aylethorp write weird fiction 
-PRON- write -PRON- intensely and -PRON- be -PRON- theory not mine that write fantasy take more out of an author than work in any other field 
-PRON- own person certainly seem to be good proof of this contention 
i do -PRON- good for -PRON- 
i carefully avoid all topic of conversation which may relate to -PRON- work 
i do not show -PRON- any of -PRON- recent stuff 
i lock away all -PRON- reference book and magazine 
and i do not allow -PRON- to speak of -PRON- book 
i coax -PRON- into rest argue and bully -PRON- with the notion of get outdoor exercise intersperse with plenty of sleep 
after a week or so i gradually augente the menu at meal time and encourage -PRON- to eat 
-PRON- work 
by the time september have pass -PRON- have regain -PRON- normal attitude and -PRON- health be once more back to par 
incidentally i -PRON- have gain six pound 
soon i propose a series of daily hike in and about the local wood 
martin take to the idea and for the fir6 t time i learn that as a boy -PRON- have often spend the summer with relative in concord 
-PRON- seem eager as -PRON- health improve to revisit familiar landmark 
although i have be at -PRON- cottage for over a year i be amazed at the unsuspected secret of the countryside -PRON- uncover 
soon -PRON- be act as -PRON- guide and i play the meekly follow visitor to local shrine 
as -PRON- physical wellbeing increase -PRON- normal interest be correspondingly rearouse 
within several week -PRON- be talk story and plot to -PRON- again and by the end of the month -PRON- be literally champ at the bit eager to get back into harness and do a few tale 
although i hold out as long as i could -PRON- insist that -PRON- be allow the use of -PRON- typewriter and -PRON- daily jaunt be now fill with -PRON- talk of propose work and plan for story 
and then -PRON- hike and -PRON- interest converge disastrously 
one morning after breakfast -PRON- come into -PRON- room and yank -PRON- out of -PRON- chair 
come on -PRON- urge 
the sun high and be go for a little explore jaunt 
where to 
i ask -PRON- cover all the local showplace yet 
this be no showplace -PRON- reply smile a secret wager there s a spot -PRON- have never see and only a mile away from here too doubt that i say 
what kind of place be -PRON- 
martin assume a look of melodramatic grimness call the bottomless pool -PRON- whisper the gag serious in the swamp south of wood 
i remember -PRON- gang explore -PRON- during one of the summer i stay here as a kid a strange place george grave warn -PRON- to stay away from -PRON- when -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would be there 
-PRON- be the only grownup -PRON- ever speak to about -PRON- and -PRON- be -PRON- who call the place the bottomless pool 
-PRON- mention walden pond in concord the place where thoreau write -PRON- nature study -PRON- know and say that -PRON- be bottomless too 
-PRON- lie in a hollow in the hill have neither inlet nor outlet yet the water be always fresh 
spring and a subterranean river cause that no doubt the glacier create some queer freak hereabouts 
but -PRON- say that government engineer once come to walden to take sounding and there be spot in that pond that be deep than -PRON- long soundingwire what -PRON- mean by a bottomless pool and -PRON- say that the one in wood be similar 
well -PRON- warning just whet -PRON- interest in the spot -PRON- see 
kid be like that i guess 
-PRON- get together all the fishline the gang could lay -PRON- hand on and tie -PRON- all together with a lead weight on one end 
then -PRON- lower -PRON- down into that sluggish black pool in the swamp 
-PRON- never strike bottom 
well that sort of scare -PRON- -PRON- a creepy place and -PRON- take the warning more seriously never have go back 
that be -PRON- last summer at concord and i gradually lose track of the boy 
but i do hear something in a letter once about sam dewey disappear in the swamp the following year 
sam be the lad who suggest -PRON- take sounding 
of course i donot think -PRON- disappearance have anything to do with -PRON- interest in the bottomless pool although -PRON- may have at that 
-PRON- be foolhardy and george grave when warn -PRON- hint something about people who have fall in i listen to all this with a sort of tepid interest 
but martin seem genuinely enthusiastic go take a look at the place -PRON- urge really a weird spot and get a hunch there s a story there somewhere 
i rise and obediently put on -PRON- boot 
in -PRON- own solitary wandering i have avoid the mucky woode depth of the old swamp and -PRON- be only to humor -PRON- guest that i accede to -PRON- request -PRON- strike out to the south and soon reach the swamp edge swamp be awful 
the limb of dead tree inter the sunlight and only the wan ghost of -PRON- beam haunt the murky avenue of the morass 
rotten log and slimy creeper cover a slough of quicksand and bog through which i flounder at heel 
the instinct of boyhood guide -PRON- aright so that -PRON- avoid the gray bubbling patch of deep ooze 
-PRON- remark over this voice -PRON- amazement that after all these year the place seem to be unchanged 
at first -PRON- be the physical difficulty -PRON- encounter which impress -PRON- 
gradually however as -PRON- wade deeper into the dark swamp i become more aware of other less tangible thing 
the place look like death and smell of death rottenness and decay 
moss and fungoid growth clung to the gray treetrunk bloated toadstool rear pulpy death head on fat stemmed neck rise from the ooze 
the bubbling of the swampjuice beneath -PRON- boot be a silent kind of sound or rather a noise that seem to intensify the silence and at the same time to be a part of -PRON- 
there be no wind in the hang branch and -PRON- see neither bird nor animal in these depth 
still there have be life here once for -PRON- soon strike a rickety old fence which wind in a seemingly haphazard manner through the low swamp 
martin beckoning to -PRON- turn and follow the meander wooden outline until -PRON- come to the willow tree that bend over the ground before -PRON- 
and there in the deep dark shade of the ancient bough lie the bottomless pool 
-PRON- be small barely six foot across and black 
jet black water motionless 
the pool be like a large unblinking eye with an odious green scum film -PRON- pupil a highly fantastic comparison but something about the pool appearance inspire such thought in -PRON- 
-PRON- be strange and somehow unnatural 
-PRON- wasnot right for this small pool to be here in the swamp and certainly the thing look as evil as any natural formation ever see stand look into the depth for a few moment 
the water black too -PRON- murmur strange how in the presence of silence the human voice be always hush 
the water black as ink -PRON- say 
and -PRON- dip one hand into the pool brush off the scummy froth and cupping ebon drop for -PRON- to see 
the water be black and the decayed matter in -PRON- give -PRON- a veined appearance -PRON- be striate with dark green rill 
place eery enough for -PRON- ask martin 
i nod 
scare -PRON- when -PRON- be kid -PRON- observe 
and i wouldnot be too sure of -PRON- reaction now 
but what a setting for a story 
perhaps 
i have be stare into the silent water and now i wonder what be generate the impulse in -PRON- to turn and run away 
be -PRON- own nerve bad 
i hastily avert -PRON- gaze 
look 
martin shout 
-PRON- really speak in a normal tone of voice but in contrast to -PRON- previous hush murmur -PRON- be a shout 
look at the lizard -PRON- exclaim 
sure enough the surface of the black water have part with a widening ripple and a small dark lizard of some sort appear 
-PRON- float on -PRON- back as though dead 
i reach down and grab -PRON- yank -PRON- out 
why there s a wire attach to -PRON- 
i gasp 
the wire lead down into the water 
just then there come a pull on the line from within the pool 
-PRON- yank the little dead reptile right out of -PRON- hand but something attach to -PRON- catch in -PRON- coat cut right through -PRON- and dig painfully into -PRON- side 
a hook catch 
i cry as i step toward the to ease the pain of the barb in -PRON- side 
but now the wire line have tighten be draw -PRON- in short jerk toward the brink of the black pool 
i grab the line with both hand brace -PRON- foot at the very edge and lean backward 
but the sod on which i be stand crumble and i slide foot foremost into the stygian water 
help 
i cry 
martin leap forward and grab -PRON- 
with a tremendous tug -PRON- hurl -PRON- back on the bank 
water course down -PRON- body and warm blood scald the deep wound in -PRON- side 
i feel faint 
martin swear softly as -PRON- daub iodine on the cut beneath -PRON- shirt and i swear loudly at the pain 
neither of -PRON- be ready to comment but suddenly martin turn -PRON- head and dart again to the edge of the pool 
-PRON- point speechless 
another lizard large than the first now rise to the surface of the pool 
-PRON- bob and seem to beckon 
martin scowl deeply pointed to -PRON- hookgashed side and growl out a single word bait 
bait 
what bait 
the lizard 
i snort disgustedly 
but ah the way home -PRON- marvel at the incident 
-PRON- argue as i change into dry garment debate as i bandage -PRON- side muse during luncheon and speculate wildly all the long afternoon 
martin ever the imaginative have a dozen fantastic theory 
who fish at the depth of the bottomless pool 
and with hook 
something live in the pool 
maybe something 
the something fish for man 
as a boy hadnot george grave hint about disappearance 
and hadnot sam dewey vanish near the swamp in the pool set trap for man put lizard on hook and use a wire line 
the bottomless pool lead to inner earth and there be life below 
thus martin express -PRON- halfseriously 
to which i offer the obvious reply 
the hook and line have be use by some fisherman 
-PRON- have fall into the water 
perhaps the lizard have be accidentally impale upon the hook rise to the surface as -PRON- die and bring the line up 
i grab -PRON- get hook and a snag entangle the line end under water have pull -PRON- into the pool 
but what about the second lizard -PRON- see 
martin insinuate gently 
i be silent 
martin be grave for a moment before continue remember as a boy fish for pickerel up assabet 
the boat rock 
i be only about nine at the time but i be a smart fisherman 
i hook a big pickerel that day and the pickerel hook -PRON- 
i give -PRON- an uncomprehending glance 
how 
i ask 
line get wrap around -PRON- foot and the fish pull -PRON- out of the boat -PRON- laugh 
then in graver tone -PRON- go on if i be a fish and i want to catch a fisherman tangle -PRON- up in a line 
take the bottomless pool for example 
if i mean to capture whoever or whatever be fish for -PRON- from below grab that lizard bait and allow -PRON- to drag -PRON- in toward the pool 
then pull up more line and attach the wire to a windlass rope 
and then let go of the hook 
the sudden release may precipitate the fisherman below overboard into the water and tangle -PRON- up 
then by quickly wind in the windlass haul the fellow up to the surface 
but that s absurd i begin no fisherman in the bottomless pool there canot be and besides how do -PRON- hooked side feel this evening interject martin sarcastically 
oh let forget -PRON- i grumble 
but i didnot forget 
i dream that night 
and martin do not forget either 
-PRON- spend the midnight hour at the typewriter take note for a story 
neither of -PRON- however speak again of the bottomless pool 
the next day i awake with a slight fever 
the wound in -PRON- side be a little inflamed and i lie abe bathing -PRON- with hot cloth to reduce the swelling 
martin after assure -PRON- that i be not utterly helpless announce that -PRON- be go for a walk like to interview a few oldtimer around here about that place -PRON- tell -PRON- 
there should be myth 
i forget what remark i make but i know that i try to laugh -PRON- out of -PRON- interest 
secretly i be very much disturb 
-PRON- dream have not be pleasant and the bottomless pool have figure rather too prominently in -PRON- 
for a moment i have the wild notion that martin be go off to try out -PRON- fishing theory 
-PRON- seem almost unnaturally interested a person of -PRON- temperament can be greatly influence by imaginative concept 
-PRON- leave on -PRON- purported mission of investigation and i spend a long day in dozing and dream 
-PRON- be late afternoon when -PRON- return greet -PRON- brusquely and go in to the other room 
in a few moment i hear the vibration of the noiseless typewriter 
rise i get supper together 
-PRON- eat but little fever have banish -PRON- own appetite and excitement seem to grip martin so that food could not interest -PRON- 
almost as soon as -PRON- sit down -PRON- launch into a long babble of gossip -PRON- have pick up during the day 
old bert picken down near the causeway have know parent -PRON- have fill -PRON- friend up with old colonial tale and even some indian lore -PRON- would hear as a boy back in the seventy 
there be story about the swamp south of the wood specific case of disappearance date way back as far as community memory go 
visit granny cottage later in the day martin have persuade the always garrulous old woman to re106 count -PRON- own family history 
-PRON- be a point of pride with the crone that -PRON- pure blood have at one time produce a martyr during the salem witchcraft hysteria and -PRON- warn martin most gravely about the old pool 
-PRON- be from -PRON- that -PRON- pick up -PRON- tale of the indian rite in the swamp where the brave sometimes offer up sacrifice to the pitgod -PRON- believe dwelt in the pool cast body into the orifice 
i could see that martin be more impressed with this lore than even -PRON- admit -PRON- be very glib in patch together -PRON- yarn so that -PRON- form an almost recognizable story sequence 
-PRON- quote from memory the word of cotton mather concern gateway to hell and opening in earth which lead to the region of the damned indeed -PRON- weave a fine romance about the pool and do -PRON- so deftly that i be force to the conclusion that -PRON- halfbelieve some of -PRON- write -PRON- all up tonight -PRON- tell -PRON- 
then i must have another look at the place 
-PRON- know there s something fascinating about all this -PRON- a real mystery -PRON- be remarkable if there be some truth about -PRON- theory concern the fishing 
after all those lizard donot manufacture hook and wire 
and some of these old wife tale be very definite 
i make no comment 
i go to bed early leave martin to type away in the next room as -PRON- have plan 
-PRON- sleep be troubled and -PRON- must have be about midnight when i wake in a cold sweat and stumble into the kitchen for water 
the house be dark and still 
i pass through room and notice with a start that -PRON- bed be empty 
fever leave -PRON- 
i know with an inexplicable dread that martin have go 
and i know too where -PRON- have go 
-PRON- first thought be that i have overestimate -PRON- recovery 
-PRON- may still be mentally ill the pool in the swamp have exercise a morbid fascination on -PRON- mind 
poor judgment may have lead -PRON- to see the thing by moonlight for the sake of capture story atmosphere 
i go back to bed but i do not sleep 
i keep wait for -PRON- to return 
the night be long 
i tremble with fever and with secret fear 
-PRON- be not a good thing to wander alone in the swamp by night 
quicksand and fog to say nothing of the possibility of run into some prowler make the stunt dangerous 
but after an hour have pass i find that -PRON- be not this spectacle of actual apparent danger which disturb -PRON- 
i begin to think only of the pool -PRON- and of the bait upon -PRON- black surface 
then -PRON- be that unreasoning panic grip -PRON- 
i rise and bundle up tug on -PRON- boot 
i snatch up -PRON- belt flashlight and run out 
i i have no sense of time pass on -PRON- nocturnal trek in the wood 
-PRON- seem only a feverfilled instant before i be already wade into that black jungle fringe the swamp only a mistwrappe moment before i dart from hummock to hummock in the rise fog call name 
only the frog croak an answer 
then i be follow the fencerail and finally grasp the willow trunk as i stare down at the bank of the pool the bank of wet mud in which be implant the fresh bootprint of human foot 
-PRON- face one way only toward the pool 
and as -PRON- near the edge -PRON- slur into a sort of slide scoopedout impression as though the wearer have be drag 
drag into the black silent water from which the tiny bubble now arise slowly slowly 
i scream and run back into the night 
fever hold -PRON- the next day 
but i be glad for -PRON- keep -PRON- from think too much think about what have happen and also about what i plan to do 
i didnot consider the possibility of suicide not when i read the type note martin have write the night before 
the whole story of -PRON- belief lie there and there be incredible hint of what -PRON- expect to bring forth from the pool depth 
at the last -PRON- speak of the urge to revisit the scene and capture a lizard for examination to see if -PRON- be of a recognizable specie and also to determine just how -PRON- have be kill 
-PRON- want some wire also and one of the hook 
then -PRON- would go ahead and try -PRON- plan 
for -PRON- quite definitely have intend to use the windlass trick 
i learn that before the morning be over the delivery truck bring the order from the city 
i go sick as i sign name for the shipment 
i have a sudden vision of -PRON- on the night before stand by the pool as -PRON- wait for the appearance of the bait then stoop to remove the reptile and be catch drag 
no -PRON- be not suicide 
-PRON- be murder 
but by what mean 
through burn delirium come the answer picture conjure up from indian legend and witchcraft whispering 
a dweller beneath the water fish for humankind and snare the curious 
a fissure in the earth crust lead to some hellish subterranean cavern 
and martin go down down into the inky water on the end of a hook to be seize by what i would find out 
the windlass and scheme -PRON- would be avenge with -PRON- own plan -PRON- own instrument 
i must have be a little mad 
i talk and laugh to -PRON- a great deal as the day speed 
i gather the equipment together at dusk and start for the swamp 
an unhealthy nightfog be already rise when i leave wood but though fever course through -PRON- vein i plod on 
i walk through nightmare 
the unseen frog croak a dismal litany as i stumble through the bog 
taper of fog rise dimly on all side and smoky mist hang about -PRON- head 
i flounder through the gray darkness lug the windlass 
often i sink ankledeep into puddle of bubble slime 
v all about -PRON- in the night be rottenness and decay and death and i recall think that this putrescent swamp be but a frame a background a setting for the black jewel of the bottomless pit 
but the fog and the fever in -PRON- temple account for such wild fancy 
fog and fever conspire toward -PRON- feeling of unutterable loathing when first i catch sight of the ebon water upon the inky chasm in the center of the swamp 
fog and fever addle -PRON- so that i monotonously curse as i anchor the windlass to a big log set upon the firm high ground of the bank 
a short rope from the drum of the windlass run to the edge of the pool and end in a quicksettling clamp 
there be a detached part of -PRON- that carry out these operation with methodical precision and yet another part that inspire -PRON- cursing as i crouch there in the forest darkness of the heaving breathing swamp -PRON- foot the quicksand thrum and groan and i recall that a wild picture rise in -PRON- mind 
i have a fantastic image of -PRON- crouch upon the epidermis of some gigantic monster as though the swamp -PRON- be just the skin of a vast beast and the bottomless black pit a tiny pinprick in the flesh 
but that too be fog and fever 
the preparation be make 
i have not even glance at the scummy surface of the pool so sure be i of what -PRON- eye must encounter 
now with the drum ready for use and the windlass securely place i gaze into the dark depth and jerk on the flashlight i wear at -PRON- belt 
-PRON- ray disclose the float blue body of a tiny lizard bob monotonously upon the surface of the cryptic water 
there -PRON- lie in death rise and sink upon water that do not move 
and that fact inspire -PRON- with the terrible fear of a corroboration for poor story 
i stare at the creature fight the fog and fever that create gray mist upon -PRON- brain until the only thought distinguishable be a panic impulse to flee the spot 
i rock on -PRON- heel when i wish to run scream back across the bog to a spot where nature be sane and friendly 
and then i feel in -PRON- pocket for the wireclipper i have find on desk 
for some absurd reason the cold feel of the prosaic factorycut metal reassure -PRON- 
and with -PRON- free hand i reach out and snatch at the blue lizard 
i tug the body from the water in the beam of the flashlight on the bank and the clear yellow beam be cut by a black line 
the lizard be wire seize the clamp next to -PRON- i quickly clip the wire to the windlass rope 
then i yank on the wire with both hand 
i tug 
a shudder run through -PRON- for i feel a dreadful unmistakable response from the other end of the line 
through the water -PRON- tighten jerk below be pull on the rope 
someone be fish 
but who 
and from how far below 
the tugger be strong 
in sudden desperation i feel -PRON- heel slide along the bank 
powerful jerk be draw -PRON- close to the black brink of that dark still pool 
with a gasp i let go 
the line whip back into the water 
in -PRON- mind eye i form a silly senseless picture of a fisherman stand on -PRON- wharf then fall over backwards as the catch release -PRON- line 
an idiotic picture -PRON- be for there could be no fisherman at the bottom of a bottomless pool 
or could there be 
i would soon know 
the line fall back then reach the spot where i have clamp -PRON- to the windlass rope 
there -PRON- snap taut 
the fisherman have fall overboard 
-PRON- have be hook 
i laugh without mirth at the insane thought 
and then i grip the windlass handle and turn the drum and i feel a terrific threshing tauten the line until -PRON- stand straight in the flashlight beam again 
the wire begin to snap back and forth in the black water of thi pool 
i turn and turn a hundred a thousand revolution be make in augment frenzy for now i desperately realize that each crank be bring -PRON- closer and closer to the secret of the bottomless pool 
suddenly the winch jam 
i stare in dismay then see that the drum be full 
then i leap in front of the windlass and grab the remain wire in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- take a second but i experience a year 
through fever and fog come image of what i may expect to find at the end of -PRON- line bloated corpse blue and swollen with the line grip between deathclenche tooth the shapeless body of a child long mire in the slime of the pit seamonster 
but no -PRON- could not be 
there be a fisher down there a fisher that bait cunningly this hook and send a wire line upwards to entrap child and wanderer and curious man 
and the fisher have take martin and be now entangle in this line 
a fisher in a black and bottomless pool i be draw in a fisher from below 
the ray of the flashlight on the bank now gleam upon the surface of the scummy water but -PRON- be still no longer 
in ooze eddy -PRON- bubble and swirl and black slime be toss upwards as i draw th cut wire through -PRON- hand 
a terrific force be pull against -PRON- and fright alone conspire to intensify the strength of -PRON- grip 
at that moment i would gladly have release -PRON- hold but sheer hysteria make -PRON- muscle rigid 
slowly inexorably i draw the final length of the wire from the water in the yellow light 
the fisher emerge 
i can not remember if i scream aloud but there be the sound make by utter fear ringing and crash against -PRON- brain 
for i see the creature of the pit see the strangle neck about which the tangle wire have wind and allow -PRON- to pull the fisher upwards 
i see what fill the sixfoot surface of the pool as -PRON- emerge 
-PRON- be a head shape by horror dream alone 
not human not reptilian not froglike -PRON- be less featured with great stare yellow eye snoute like a saurian and cover with a greenish batrachoid skin that glisten slickly against the yellow light 
the monstrous bulging eye roll wildly and dilate in agony as the creature open -PRON- great slitted mouth in a soundless choke gasp 
i stare into a red maw that be fange in a manner unknown to any beast still roam earth and as i do so a sicken realization sweep over -PRON- 
this be the fisher 
an instant only do that gigantic glistening head rise greenly above the water of the pool then -PRON- clipper be out the wire snap with a shrill twang and the fisher from below sank beneath the bubble black wave with a thunderous splash of slime 
i stare down blankly into the depth as the water quickly become quiescent once again 
i could see nothing but i do not wish to 
i do not wish to learn what manner of horrid life flourish unnaturally at the bottom of this opening wherever that bottom may be 
i do not care to speculate upon the cunning intelligence of a primal entity which even now fished for man from -PRON- lair in the black deep 
i do not think i could endure surmise which now clamor for consideration 
be this the only creature of -PRON- kind or be there more down there 
what inversion of sane natural law allow existence in nighte depth and what manner of ghastly intelligence prompt prehistoric beast to set bait for man 
be there other such opening in the earth conceal crust through which the madness below have access to humanity 
but what i most devoutly try to keep from think about be the scraped side of the poolbank and the reason for -PRON- 
only the head of the monster have emerge and -PRON- have fill the pool 
the side be scrape by the shoulder and the sixfoot pool bad not be wide enough to permit the passage of the body 
fog and fever be merciful release 
i know that i dump the windlass in the pool and -PRON- sink like a plummet and i dimly remember run back through the swamp ill the next few day and then the police come and i tell -PRON- what i dare 
-PRON- have see the pool but -PRON- have say nothing of -PRON- opinion to -PRON- 
i tell -PRON- more today and will tell -PRON- all i know soon not to preserve -PRON- freedom but because now i want the spot board up 
-PRON- must be lest other see the bait -PRON- must be board up for -PRON- can not be fill up 
i shall tell -PRON- soon or let -PRON- read this 
-PRON- can think -PRON- demente if -PRON- like but i trust -PRON- believe enough to act and act promptly 
perhaps if even then -PRON- do not believe i may show -PRON- the hook i have tre hook from the wire in the pool which i cut off 
i hate to reveal -PRON- to -PRON- for i detest the very memory of the thing -PRON- 
-PRON- be make of some golden metal harder than pure gold 
-PRON- be cut and rudely shape and i dislike to conceive of the creature who deliberately form -PRON- for -PRON- horrid purpose and make the wire to which -PRON- be attach 
i can not bear to think of the civilization behind such a creative effort 
and bad of all be the memory of those design in the metal 
those design create by what primal artist 
there be three of -PRON- cut into the gold surface 
-PRON- tell all so that i know only too well why the fisher seek man with bait from -PRON- bottomless pit 
the first design be tiny like the rest but -PRON- unmistakably depict a creature such as the one whose head i see 
i dare not describe the body which be show here 
but the creature be bait a hook 
the second little design be a crude representation of a man fall through water at the end of a line as martin must have fall 
and the third design but i must not speak of that tell of what fate be tell why the fisher fish 
that third hellish design on the hookl -PRON- show a feast 
the bottomless pool must be board up 
out of the piledup century come an inexorable summon for the twin of isame 
by author of murder in the wax work king of voodoo etc not a dream 
despite the fact that -PRON- have distinctly remember go to bed as a last conscious effort after the stormy interview with artemus eusso marjorie westbrook know as -PRON- have know about other weird instance in -PRON- life that this be stark and cold reality 
there be no state of transition between the pleasant business of retiring and this instinct awareness of an incredible situation 
simply -PRON- have go to bed in -PRON- lovely chamber at home in forest hill as marjorie westbrook heiress to the westbrook motor million -PRON- mind fill with business detail over the present policy of the late george automobile factory 
and here -PRON- be wide awake and stand before an altar in front of -PRON- an altar of ancient egyptian motif with the sacred ibis projecting in relief at the end like figurehead of ship 
-PRON- stand in -PRON- bare foot upon a cold floor of tesselate marble 
moreover the satin nightdress the last item of dress -PRON- remember donning be go 
-PRON- stand there in complete nudity but -PRON- be conscious of no sense of shame or modesty 
without see -PRON- for -PRON- be powerless to turn -PRON- be aware of an immensity of space which crystal ball turn inky black tend in all direction behind -PRON- a space block out with intangible green mist that be almost black and almost of the density of velvet drape at -PRON- right hand be an upright sarcophagus with the lid remove 
within the musty and spicily pungent interior be the wrap figure of a mummy a mummy which queerly enough be headless 
-PRON- be all like close -PRON- eye upon a scene in a cinema for an instant to open -PRON- upon a sudden change of locale 
with this can not difference there be no continuity no relevance no congruity no connection between -PRON- life and this grotesque pattern 
none 
there be of course -PRON- previous experience those strange uncanny interlude in -PRON- otherwise prosaic life 
but there be no tangible connection unless -PRON- consider the sarcophagus which look exactly like the one -PRON- have purchase some month before even to the headless mummy in the musty interior 
somehow and marjorie could not explain -PRON- that sarcophagus which should have be in -PRON- boudoir be here with -PRON- in this other world 
that egyptian sarcophagus as soon as -PRON- have see -PRON- -PRON- have be resolve to possess -PRON- 
-PRON- fascination for -PRON- have be but the apex of an amazing sequence of bizarre occurrence and -PRON- blend as a perfect complement with those experience 
marjorie now become aware that just beyond the altar before which -PRON- stand be the figure of a man in a cowl crimson robe -PRON- hand busy at a set of dial and button before -PRON- 
and the crazy and most outre part of -PRON- all be the monk face 
-PRON- be art emus russo general manager of westbrook motor 
yet there be a strangeness about -PRON- that be not russo 
before -PRON- have time to cry out to question -PRON- to demand an explanation marjorie notice the light 
-PRON- be outline in a glow of light like a psychic aura of unbelievable intensity shade from pure white to garish green mantle -PRON- in a bath of live light 
as -PRON- stare down at -PRON- lovely form to -PRON- horror -PRON- see the flesh become translucent transparent and finally invisible and the skeletal structure of -PRON- body from neck to toe become hideously reveal in glow pink 
still bind by invisible chain which keep -PRON- motionless but without pain marjorie hear the cowl figure speak and the tone of -PRON- voice awaken a thousand memory in -PRON- mind memory which be not of the welltailored artemus russo who shout so irately about proxy and asset and common stock of westbrook motor inc the hour have come princess -PRON- say to fulfill -PRON- destiny 
ankhtare -PRON- gasp give -PRON- a name which come easily from -PRON- lip 
no no i be not ready 
-PRON- own answer startle -PRON- profoundly shake -PRON- to the depth of -PRON- soul 
that be what make these bizarre occurrence in -PRON- life so distress 
-PRON- imply knowledge on -PRON- part of monstrous thing from the womb of time about which -PRON- as marjorie westbrook should have know nothing 
but -PRON- do know 
even now answer so easily to the title of princess yet aware of -PRON- as marjorie westbrook -PRON- remember similar experience first have happen when -PRON- be a child of ten 
without warn -PRON- have pass from a safely mundane world to a shadowy temple of vast hall and tower pillar 
go to bed all tire out from a day of happy play fall quickly asleep suddenly -PRON- be stand before a high altar whose side be a frieze of jackalheaded doll of angular line 
or be -PRON- doll 
how be a little girl of ten to know 
yet -PRON- be not strange to -PRON- 
without know how -PRON- know -PRON- be as familiar with the symbol of anubis as -PRON- be with -PRON- own sister the twin who have always walk beside -PRON- 
sister 
with a start -PRON- realize that another little girl be stand with -PRON- before that forbidding altar with -PRON- plume of curl incense 
the little companion be an exact duplicate of -PRON- dress in archaic headdress and queerly drape robe of costly silk with beat gold design in the hem 
on -PRON- ankle and arm bracelet glitter one in the form of a coil serpent with eye of emerald green 
this be isame 
without be tell marjorie know that -PRON- own name be isira 
-PRON- have always be isira for ten year of egyptian childhood as a princess of the royal blood 
there be no marjorie westbrook in this consciousness and yet -PRON- know -PRON- be marjorie westbrook and that sir gerwain be wait for -PRON- out in -PRON- father kennel 
in a way -PRON- be terrifying and marjorie isira whimper 
be brave isira whisper isame 
-PRON- be -PRON- heritage 
before marjorie could reply there be movement behind the altar and ankhtare high priest of ammon a cold and stern man with the feature of artemus russo -PRON- father secretary swam into view 
there be a strange light in -PRON- pierce black eye as -PRON- look out and down upon the two little girl who stand before the altar to the dead tightly clasp each other hand 
princess isira and princess isame -PRON- speak in a sonorous voice which echo hollowly through the great hall of the temple in accordance with the rule of -PRON- house bless under the sign of the ansata and dedicated to the service of ra -PRON- be here to choose -PRON- destiny 
be -PRON- prepared 
-PRON- be prepared ankhtare marjorie hear -PRON- and -PRON- sister reply 
that the language be not modern english -PRON- do not even note 
the high priest pass -PRON- hand above the curl incense rise from the altar in a cabalistic sign and blue smoke fairly boil up in writhe convolution that have spark of incandescent red 
the figure of the high priest be obscure for a moment and both little girl tremble 
then -PRON- come back into view 
in this the third era in the second dynasty of ptolemy -PRON- compelling voice roll out -PRON- be write in the seventh book of anubis that of twin prince or princess of the direct line of pharaoh only one can ascend to the throne 
herein lie the part path of destiny 
for one there be the sceptre of a queen wealth and glory and power and death before -PRON- youth have fade 
for the other there be a timeless void until -PRON- spirit shall find life and happiness in a future existence and then -PRON- shall grow old before -PRON- time 
and in the end the twain shall be reunite by a bond far strong than that of natal tie 
-PRON- be so write 
choose well ye little princess 
behold the sacred ibis await to carry the word to ammon giver of all 
both little girl clung together and quiver in wideeye fright as -PRON- see the blue smoke take the form of the sacred bird 
the word of the high priest be incomprehensible to -PRON- but -PRON- stare at the shadowy bird of ra and speak bravely want to be a queen say isame want to be happy say isira 
with a puff of smoke the nebulous ibis disappear 
so be -PRON- say the voice of ankhtare 
there be a flash of blind light and little marjorie westbrook open -PRON- eye to find the loom sun stream in at the window and to hear the excited yelping of sir gerwain -PRON- wolfhound outside 
that have happen when -PRON- be ten 
now at twentyfive in the very midst of undergo a similar experience -PRON- be able to recall that early one stare down in a mounting sort of mental fear as -PRON- watch -PRON- body entirely disappear from beneath -PRON- leave only the faintly glowing frame of -PRON- bony structure 
and as -PRON- watch even that begin to fade away in the bath of terrible light the source of which -PRON- could not determine 
soon -PRON- would be a disembody head float above the strange floor 
the hour be at hand princess isira say the cowl priest for the fulfillment of -PRON- destiny 
the sand of time have run -PRON- interminable course 
beyond human comprehension be the working of the infinite 
-PRON- behold on -PRON- right the sarcophagus of isame queen of the nile take unto the arm of anubis and thoth in -PRON- twentysixth year 
alas only -PRON- chu preserved body remain 
-PRON- ka soul bird with human head have depart for the sun temple of amraon -PRON- sacred crypt be violate by vandal and desecrator of the dead but -PRON- can behold -PRON- likeness on the lid of the sarcophagus in beat gold 
marjorie westbrook or the consciousness that be marjorie westbrook stare at the cover of the ornate case and nearly swoon in astonishment -PRON- recall the face on the lid of -PRON- own sarcophagus the one in -PRON- boudoir and how -PRON- haunting familiarity have puzzle arid intrigue -PRON- 
but always -PRON- bad remain vague and dim 
now like the sensitize image on a print that have just be withdraw from develop fluid the golden feature bathe in that eerie glow be exact duplicate of -PRON- own 
-PRON- be as though -PRON- stare into a burnished mirror of gold 
even the wide staring eye seem alive with the color and expression of -PRON- own eye 
and still this fantastic this outre and bizarre experience be no dream 
majorie westbrook be as thoroughly awake as -PRON- would ever be 
never since that soulshake and impossible thing which have happen to -PRON- at the age of ten have -PRON- experience awake or asleep any further manifestation which include so much as a mention of the lose isame 
in -PRON- nocturnal materialization and there have be at least one for every year of -PRON- life -PRON- have never again see this strange twin sister or hear of -PRON- until now 
-PRON- come to marjorie with a dreadful thrill that -PRON- be in -PRON- own twentysixth year right now 
not once during -PRON- entire life have -PRON- ever mention these weird adventure to anyone not even to -PRON- doctor 
-PRON- be a closed and seal book from the world from even marjorie -PRON- except in the throe of the fantastic episode 
but -PRON- be not a dream life -PRON- know that 
-PRON- be some horrible destiny an actual and solid fate of terrific force and dim unguessed purpose that stalk -PRON- 
and -PRON- do not feed solely upon the hour of night a mere figment of -PRON- imagination 
there be that day when -PRON- be seventeen and -PRON- father have take -PRON- to the county fair 
normal happy lighthearte girl of a modern age -PRON- have clap -PRON- hand in delight when the old gipsy hag in the gaycolored booth want to tell -PRON- fortune 
but no sooner have marjorie seat -PRON- across the table of sand from the woman than the crystal ball thereon turn inky black 
the woman start in utter dismay and quickly fling a cloth over the ball 
-PRON- blanch almost white as -PRON- stare with -PRON- sharp black eye into blue one 
let -PRON- see -PRON- right hand -PRON- say in a tense whisper 
obligingly marjorie stretch out -PRON- slim and girlish hand palm up 
without touch -PRON- the gipsy stare with bulge eye -PRON- golden earring adance with violent agitation 
no -PRON- whisper 
no no i can not read -PRON- destiny child 
but that isnot fair pout marjorie pay -PRON- a silver dollar 
-PRON- must read -PRON- fortune 
here be -PRON- money say the old woman begin to shake all over wonot have -PRON- back declare marjorie defiantly 
keep -PRON- and read -PRON- fortune 
gipsy groan 
i can not -PRON- articulate with difficulty dare not 
i see only that -PRON- have a double existence 
-PRON- will grow old before -PRON- time incredibly old 
how old demand marjorie think the gipsy be put on a very good act 
perhaps perhaps six thousand year choke out the other and then with a wild cry the woman flee from the booth 
that experience have take place in broad daylight have occur to marjorie westbrook without any transition into another entity another sphere of life 
so -PRON- know -PRON- be not crazy 
and -PRON- know -PRON- do not dream these yearly episode which wove that strange irrelevant and inexplicable pattern through -PRON- otherwise normal and sane existence 
no 
no -PRON- cry out in horror now against a dread of -PRON- know not what as -PRON- skeleton completely disappear 
but -PRON- protest be as naught to this high priest of ammon who be the counterpart of artemus russo 
and marjorie become aware of a pair of hand cold and clammy as early morning fog off the sound which grip -PRON- head 
-PRON- roll -PRON- eye to see a greengray figure that have materialize behind -PRON- a disembody spirit that be human only in outline an elemental even an ectoplasmic projection of ankhtare 
-PRON- open -PRON- mouth to scream in terror but no sound come 
-PRON- think -PRON- be in a silent world of chimera 
and the creature carry -PRON- bodyless head like a football across the intervene space and set -PRON- firmly on the shoulder of the linenwrapped mummy within the sarcophagus thy destiny have be fulfil come the voice of ankhtare 
at last -PRON- shall both have peace 
there be that blind flash of light which marjorie westbrook have come to know so well and everything go into the oblivion of nothingness open -PRON- eye

-PRON- throw back the silken coverlet preparatory to sit up 
bring over the -PRON- break off in stunned horror 
as -PRON- move -PRON- sound like the rattling of parchment and dry bone 
as -PRON- toss back the cover instead of a satin night negligee from paris upon the lovely body of a beauty -PRON- expose the graybrown and dry skin of an egyptian mummy 
-PRON- hand be two shrunken claws the outline of the bone show plainly from elbow to finger 
one terrible shriek marjorie westbrook give ere death overtake -PRON- 
the horrible episode of -PRON- nocturnal life have finally break through the barrier that have always surround and protect -PRON- have overtake -PRON- at last 
the six thousand year be up 
the maid stare petrify at the lovely head perfectly join to that of the mummy of an egyptian woman

i race along the coast and within two hour i have reach the little mission town hem in by the pinos range drowse sleepily on the edge of the pacific 
i find -PRON- guide at the hotel but -PRON- be oddly reluctant to return to camp can tell -PRON- how to go senor 
-PRON- will not get lose 
the boy dark face be unnaturally pale beneath -PRON- heavy tan and there be a lurk disquiet in -PRON- brown eye donot want to go back i jingle some coin not as bad as all that be -PRON-

-PRON- flinch 
si the the dark -PRON- very dark in that cave senor 
the upshot be that i have to go alone trust to -PRON- direction and mv own ability in the open 
dawn be break as i start up the canyon trail but -PRON- be a strangely dark dawn 
the sky be not overcast but -PRON- hold a curious gloom 
i have see such oppressively dark day during dust storm but the air seem clear enough 
and -PRON- be very cold although even from -PRON- height i could see no fog on the pacific 
i keep on climb 
presently i find -PRON- thread the gloomy chill recess of coyote canyon 
i shiver with cold 
the sky be a dull leaden color and i find -PRON- breathe heavily 
in good physical condition the climb have tire -PRON- unduly 
yet i be not physically tired -PRON- be rather an ache oppressive lethargy of mind 
-PRON- eye be water and i find -PRON- shut -PRON- occasionally to relieve the strain i wish the sun would come over the top of the mountain 
then i sawsomethe extraordinary and horrible 
-PRON- be a toad gray fat ugly 
-PRON- be squat beside a rock at the side of the trail rub -PRON- against the rough stone 
one eye be turn toward -PRON- or rather the place where the eye should have be 
there be no eye there be only a slimy little hollow 
the toad move -PRON- ungainly body back and forth saw -PRON- head against the rock 
-PRON- keep utter harsh little croak of pain and in a moment -PRON- have withdraw from the stone and be drag -PRON- across the trail at -PRON- foot 
i stand look at the stone nauseate 
the gray surface of rock be bedaub with whitish streak of fetor and the shredded bit of the toad eye 
apparently the toad have deliberately grind out -PRON- protrude eye against the rock 
-PRON- creep out of sight beneath a bush leave a track of slime in the dust of the trail 
i involuntarily shut -PRON- eye and rub -PRON- and suddenly jerk down -PRON- hand startle at the roughness with which -PRON- fist have be dig into -PRON- eyesocket 
lance pain shoot through -PRON- temple 
remember the itching burn sensation in -PRON- eye i shudder a little 
have the same sort of torture cause the toad deliberately to blind -PRON- 
-PRON- god on up the trail 
presently i pass a cabin probably the one from which todd have telephone for i see wire run from the roof to a tall pine 
i knock at the door 
no answer continue -PRON- ascent 
suddenly there come an agonize scream knifeedge and shrill and the rapid thudding of footstep 
i stop listen 
someone be run down the trail toward -PRON- and behind -PRON- i could hear other race shout as -PRON- run 
around a bend in the trail a man come plunge 
-PRON- be a mexican and -PRON- blackstubble face be set in line of terror and agony 
-PRON- mouth be open in a square of agony and insane scream burst horribly from -PRON- throat 
but -PRON- wasnot that that send -PRON- stagger back out of -PRON- path cold sweat burst out on -PRON- body 
-PRON- eye have be gouge out and twin trickle of blood drip down -PRON- face from black gaping hollow 
as -PRON- happen there be no need for -PRON- to halt the blinded man frantic rush 
at the curve of the trail -PRON- smash into a tree with frightful force and momentarily stand upright against the trunk 
then very slowly -PRON- sag down and collapse in a limp huddle 
there be a great splotch of blood on the rough bark 
i go over to -PRON- quickly 
four man come run toward -PRON- 
i recognize arthur todd and denton -PRON- assistant 
the other two be obviously laborer 
todd jerk to a halt 
ross 
good god be -PRON- dead swiftly -PRON- bend over to examine the unconscious man 
denton and i stare at each other 
denton be a tall stronglybuilt man with a shock of black hair and a broad mouth that be generally expand in a grin 
now -PRON- face bear a look of horrified disbelief 
god ross -PRON- do -PRON- right before -PRON- eye denton say through pale lip 
-PRON- just let out a scream throw up -PRON- hand and tear -PRON- eye out of -PRON- socket 
-PRON- shut -PRON- own eye at the memory 
todd get up slowly 
unlike denton -PRON- be small wiry nervously energetic with a lean brown face and amazingly alert eye 
dead -PRON- say happen 
i ask try to keep -PRON- voice steady wrong todd 
be the man insane 
and all the while i have a picture of that fat toad tear out -PRON- eye against a rock 
todd shake -PRON- head -PRON- brow draw together in a frown donot know 
ross do -PRON- eye feel odd 
a shiver run through -PRON- 
damn odd 
burn and itch be rub -PRON- continually on the way up 
so have the man denton tell -PRON- 
so have -PRON- 
see 
-PRON- point to -PRON- eye and i see that -PRON- be redrimme and inflame 
the two laborer mexican come over to -PRON- 
one of -PRON- say some118 thing in spanish 
todd bark a sharp order and -PRON- fall back hesitating 
then without further parley -PRON- take to -PRON- heel down the trail 
denton start forward with an angry shoot but todd catch -PRON- arm 
no use -PRON- say quickly have to get the bell out -PRON- 
-PRON- find the last one 
i ask as -PRON- turn back up the trail 
-PRON- find -PRON- all three todd say somberly 
denton and i dig up the last one -PRON- 
and -PRON- find this too draw a dirtencrusted greenish metal tube from -PRON- pocket and give -PRON- to -PRON- 
within the cylinder be a sheet of parchment in a remarkably good state of preservation 
i puzzle over the archaic spanish script 
let -PRON- todd say take -PRON- carefully 
-PRON- translate expertly 
on the twentyfirst of june by the favor of god the attack by the pagan mutsune have be repulse the three bell cast a month ago be bury in this secret cave and the entrance seal but a landslide obviously open -PRON- up again recently todd break off to explain 
inasmuch as evil witchcraft be practice by the indian when -PRON- suspend and rang the bell the evil demon whom the mutsune call be call from -PRON- dwelling beneath the mountain and bring the black night and the cold death among -PRON- 
the large cross be overthrow and many of the people be possess of the evil demon so that the few of -PRON- who retain -PRON- sense be hard put to -PRON- to overcome -PRON- fiendinspired attack and remove the bell 
afterward -PRON- give thank to god for -PRON- preservation and give aid to those who be injure in the fray 
the soul of those who perish be commend to god and -PRON- pray that the san antonio would soon arrive to relieve -PRON- from this cruel solitude 
i charge whomever may find these bell should -PRON- not please god to allow -PRON- to fulfill this duty to send -PRON- to rome in the name of -PRON- master the king 
may god guard -PRON- 
todd pause and carefully return the parchment to -PRON- case 
junipero serra sign -PRON- -PRON- say quietly 
lord what a find 
i exult 
but surely -PRON- donot think there s anything who say i do 
todd snap in a voice that betray -PRON- nervous tension some logical explanation superstition and autosuggestion be a bad combination 
i sarto denton ask with a note of apprehension in -PRON- voice 
-PRON- be stand at the edge of a little clearing bare and rocky 
sarto 
i ask 
-PRON- have the cabin down the trail todd say 
-PRON- must have pass -PRON- 
i leave -PRON- here with the bell when jose have -PRON- seizure -PRON- better get body to town 
i ask 
todd frown think -PRON- brutal -PRON- say 
but these bell i canot leave -PRON- here 
the man dead 
-PRON- canot help -PRON- and -PRON- will take all three of -PRON- to get the bell to town too bad the poor chap didnot have sense of direction -PRON- finish with a grim smile 
-PRON- wouldnot have run into the tree then 
-PRON- be right 
i believe that denton could have traverse the entire trail blindfold after have once ascend -PRON- 
-PRON- have a remarkable memory and sense of direction like those indian who could unerringly find -PRON- way to -PRON- wigwam across hundred of mile of wilderness 
later this trait of be to be of vital importance but no premonition of this come to -PRON- at the time 
-PRON- have climb the rocky mountain slope above the clearing and have come out in a little glade among the pine 
nearby be a gape hollow in the ground around -PRON- evidence of a recent landslide 
where the devil todd say stare around 
how go denton say in amazement 
and the bell with -PRON- then -PRON- hear -PRON- a faint hollow musical note the sound of a bell hit wood 
-PRON- come from above -PRON- and glance up the slope -PRON- see an odd sight 
a man gaunt beard with a blazing thatch of red hair be tug at a rope -PRON- have stretch over the branch af a pine 
at the other end of the rope slowly -PRON- rise silhouetted against the sky the lost bell of san xavier 
gracefully curve -PRON- glow bronze even beneath -PRON- stain and verdigris and -PRON- be silent for -PRON- have no clapper 
once or twice -PRON- swing against the trunk of the pine and send out a hollow mournful note 
how the man could lift that great weight be inexplicable i could see the muscle cord and knot on -PRON- bare arm as -PRON- strain 
-PRON- eye be bulge and -PRON- tooth clench in a grin mouth 
sarto 
denton cry start to clamber up the slope 
what be -PRON- do the man jerk -PRON- head around and stare at -PRON- 
the rope slip through -PRON- finger and -PRON- see the bell plunge down 
with a frightful effort -PRON- clutch the rope and halt -PRON- descent momentarily but the strain throw -PRON- off balance 
-PRON- totter overbalance and come crash down the slope and behind -PRON- overtake -PRON- roll and bound the bell throb and booming as -PRON- clash against rock 
god i hear todd whisper 
the mad fool 
there be a maelstrom of dust and fly shale on the slope above 
i hear a sicken crunch and denton throw -PRON- desperately aside 
through the dust i see one of the bell smash down on the slide body of sarto and then i be stumble away scrub furiously at -PRON- eye blind by the fly particle of dirt 
the rattle and roar subside slowly as i cling to a tree 
i blink glance around 
almost at -PRON- foot be one of the bell 
there be a great crimson stain upon -PRON- 
the body of sarto be visible jam into a bush on the slope above 
and a few foot below -PRON- prop upright against a jagged rock be batter gory head 
thus end the first act of the drama i be to witness 
the bell be to be hang two week later

in the cold daylight of logic outside the eerie atmosphere of the pinos mountain the unusual occurrence during the unearthing of the bell be easily explain 
a virulent kind of poisoning perhaps similar to poison oak or some fungus hide in the cave with the relic have be responsible for -PRON- optical irritation and the madness of sarto and the mexican 
neither denton todd nor i deny this explanation but -PRON- discuss the matter at length among -PRON- 
denton go so far as to drive down to the huntington library to view the forbid johann negus translation of the book of lod that abhorrent and monstrous volume of ancient esoteric formulae about which curious legend still cle 
only a single copy of the original volume write in the prehuman ancient tongue be say to exist 
certainly few even know of the expurgate johann negus translation but denton have hear vague rumor about a passage in the book which -PRON- declare may be connect with the legend of the san xavier bell 
when -PRON- return from los angele -PRON- bring a sheet of foolscap paper cover with -PRON- execrable penmanship 
the passage -PRON- have copy from the book of lod be this the dark silent one dwelleth deep beneath the earth on the shore of the western ocean 
not one of those potent old one from hidden world and other star be -PRON- for in earth hide blackness -PRON- hath always dwelt 
no name hath -PRON- for -PRON- be the ultimate doom and the undying emptiness and silence of old night 
when earth be dead and lifeless and the star pass into the blackness -PRON- will rise again and spread -PRON- dominion over all 
for -PRON- hath naught to do with life and sunlight but loveth the blackness and the eternal silence of the abyss 
yet can -PRON- be call to earth surface before -PRON- time and the brown one who dwell on the shore of the western ocean have power to do this by ancient spell and certain deeptone sound which reach -PRON- dwellingplace far below 
but there be great danger in such a summoning lest -PRON- spread death and night before -PRON- time 
for -PRON- bringeth darkness within the day and blackness within the light all life all sound all movement passeth away at -PRON- come 
-PRON- cometh sometimes within the eclipse and althoagh -PRON- hath no name the brown one know -PRON- as zushakon 
there be a deletion at that point denton say as i glance up from the excerpt 
the book expurgate -PRON- know very odd todd say pick up the paper and run -PRON- eye over -PRON- 
but of course -PRON- merely a coincidence 
certainly since folklore be base on natural phenomenon one can generally find modern parallel 
the thunderbolt of jove and arrow be merely lightning and sunstroke 
never on -PRON- do the shine sun look down with -PRON- beam denton quote softly 
but deadly night be spread abroad over these hapless man remember odysseus visit to the land of the dead mouth twist wryly 
well what of -PRON- 
i donot expect pluto to come up from tartarus when the bell be hang 
do -PRON- this be the twentieth century such thing donot happen in fact never do happen 
be -PRON- sure 
denton ask 
surely -PRON- donot pretend to believe this cold weather be have be normal 
i glance up quickly 
i have be wonder when someone would mention the abnormal chill in the air be cold before todd say with a sort of desperate assurance 
and overcast too 
just because be have some muggy weather be no reason for -PRON- to let -PRON- imagination get the upper hand good god -PRON- go staggering across the room

and the shaman enchant the bell with -PRON- magic be a fool 
why shouldnot some peculiar vibration like the sound of a bell create certain unusual condition 
denton ask hotly and i think i detect a note of fear in -PRON- voice

i can find -PRON- way will -PRON- come ross 
for a second i do not answer 
all the monstrous reference glean from -PRON- study of the lose bell be flood back into -PRON- mind the ancient god whom the mutsune be suppose to have the power of summon by certain deeptone sound -PRON- corneth sometimes within the eclipse all life passeth away at -PRON- come yet can -PRON- be call to earth surface before -PRON- time with -PRON- denton i say 
then damn -PRON- so be todd snap see the end of this 
if there be anything not finish but i feel hand grope for mine lead denton tell -PRON- 
take -PRON- easy now 
i wonder how denton could find -PRON- way in that envelop shroud of jet blackness 
then i remember -PRON- uncanny memory and sense of direction 
no homing pigeon could make a straight way to -PRON- destination than -PRON- 
-PRON- be a mad odyssey through a black hell of shriek ruin 
fly object scream past -PRON- unseen wall and chimney topple and smash nearby 
frightened hysterical man and woman blunder into -PRON- in the dark and go shout away vainly search for escape from this stygian deathtrap 
and -PRON- be cold cold 
a frigid and icy chill pervade the air and ray finger and ear be already numb and ache 
the icy air send knifeedge pain slash through -PRON- throat and lung as i breathe 
i hear denton and todd wheeze and gasping curse as -PRON- stumble along beside -PRON- 
how denton ever find -PRON- way through that chaotic maelstrom i shall never understand 
here 
denton shout 
the mission 
somehow -PRON- mount the step 
how the mission manage to stand through the grind shock i do not know 
what probably save -PRON- be the curious regularity of the temblor the quake be more of a rhythmic slow swaying of the earth than the usual abrupt wrench shock 
from nearby come a low chant incongruous in the madness around -PRON-

but what avail -PRON- prayer while in the tower the bell be send out -PRON- blasphemous summon 
luckily -PRON- have often visit the mission and denton know -PRON- way to the tower 
on that incredible climb up the stair to the bell tower i shall not dwell although every moment -PRON- be in danger of be dash down to instant death 
but at last -PRON- win to the loft where the bell be shriek -PRON- thunder through the blackness almost in -PRON- ear 
denton release -PRON- hand and shout something i could not distinguish 
there be an agony of pain in -PRON- head and -PRON- flesh ache with the cold 
i feel an overpower impulse to sink down into black oblivion and leave this hellish chaos 
-PRON- eye be hot burn ache

then i feel two arm constrict about -PRON- neck and vicious thumb dig cruelly into -PRON- eyesocket 
i shriek with the blind agony of -PRON- 
i battle desperately in the darkness battle not only -PRON- unknown assailant but fight back a mad perverse impulse to allow -PRON- to gouge out -PRON- eye

or be -PRON- 
i have hope to close the door of -PRON- memory forever on the entire horrible affair for -PRON- be good not to dwell too closely upon such thing 
and despite the storm of adverse criticism and curiosity that be arouse by the smashing of the bell the next day with the full permission of father bernard of the mission i have fully determine never to reveal the truth of the matter 
-PRON- be -PRON- hope that only three man denton todd and -PRON- may hold the key to the horror and that -PRON- would die with -PRON- 
yet something have occur which force -PRON- to break -PRON- silence and place before the world the fact of the case 
denton agree with -PRON- that perhaps thus mystic and occultist who have knowledge of such thing may be enable to utilize -PRON- knowledge more effectually if what -PRON- fear ever come to pass
