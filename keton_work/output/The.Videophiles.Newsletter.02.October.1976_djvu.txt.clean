Tliis fools your set, which in trying to make a proper color picture out of a black and >dtiie one, only manages to make a sneared, "sparkly" inage.

Mare else sends along the following re: editing out commercials: I haro fouid tlat with just a little patienw, it's not really that Iiard to edit out and bridge slides (the art cards that occasionally pop between Uk: program and a cotsercial). for 1>est results, note the tome the station goes to tlicir ccciaercial break, let Ow recorder roll for a few noro seconds, rewind it and cue it (by trial and error) to exact point right before the eomricrcial begins, and stop the nadiinc.

(sort of) I have racked my brain in an attempt to come up with suggested guidelines for trading, selling, lending and what not, of our tapes. There are so many combinations of possible arrangements involving varied types of material, that suggesting comprehensive guidelines now seems to me to be either impossible or of no real service to you Having said that, I offer the following: On a straight hour for hour trade of material taped off the air, each party should use his own tape, pay his own postage, and make no charge. Two half hours should be considered the same as one hour long show. The difference in effort is not worth quibbling over If one person lends out a tape for viewing and return, the lendee should pay postage and packing both ways. As to taping off the air for someone who offers no similar service in return well, folks, it's up to you. personally, have little time for this and would probably not do it, and go to the trouble of dropping out commercials, for less than an hour, As to sending someone a tape in order to allow it to be copied or copying it yourself and sending it off, can't help but feel that the nature of the material involved comes into play. I would hope that we could keep fees on this to a minimum, and try to let the desire to share overcrane the urge to profit. There are at least identifiable types of material that we will be dealing with: Regular current network shows Example: This weeks episode of This catagory would also include network reruns, such as Sanford and Son which is on in the morning five days a week. Syndicated Reruns Examples: Greenacres, The Avengers, and The Munsters, which are available to local stations, but are only being run in certain parts of the country at any one time. Syndicated Shows Examples: Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, and Monty Python, which arc not reruns, but arc still only being shown in certain parts of the country. Syndicated Movies Examples: Bogart, Charlie Chan, and Frankenstien movies being shown somewhere or other most of the time. These of course are more desirable if the commercials are out. Pay-Cable Material Examples: First run movies, special events, and 'otherwise available off the air, which are shown on Home Box Office, Warner Star Cable, some other pay cable system or on systems in hotels. 16mm film/tape Available Examples: Any show such as those in catagories or which are currently available, but which were not taped off the air. Rather they were produced by turning film into a cassette tape by use of special equipment. 16mni film/tape Not Available Examples: Amos and Andy, Life of Riley or any tape made from a film of a show which is no longer on the air in syndication or otherwise. 16mm film/tape (Movie) Available Examples: King Kong, or any film available in catagories or but which was produced from a 16mni print, rather than off the air. 16min film/ tape (Movie) Not Available Examples: Obscure films, "porno" titles, silent movies, or whatever that is not available off the air in any of the above catagories. Off the Air How Unavailable Examples: Recordings made by you early ta pesters of specials, shows, aerials, variety shows, and whatever that were current at the time but which by their nature are not li)cely to ever be rerun. The News or a beauty contest would be other good examples. Many of the shows in catagories and will fall into this catagory as time goes on. Prerecorded Material. This could be almost anything. It is expected that Sony will soon be bringing this sort of thing out in the Betamax format. It is already available on cassettes that are played on tape equipment. Of course, there are others: home movie type tapes that you make yourself, tapes of local live events that become catagory material the instant they are over, and who knows what all. But, the point of all this is to say that it would seem that items in catagories and and, to a lesser extent, those in catagories and are common enough that they should be considered of nearly equal value for trading purposes. But, the others, particularly those in catagories and should command a price of some sort, not only because of their relative rarity, but also because a certain investment was required to obtain them in the first place. As among ourselves I offer no suggested prices at this time, but I hope we will be able to counteract somewhat the big time bootleg tape dealers who will be on the scene someday just as surely as you are reading these words. A word on The condition or quality of your reception should also have a bearing on the value of your tapes. I would welcome any suggestion re: a quality standard that we could all refer to. This should include such things as clarity of picture, commercials, momentary interference, and, in the case of movies, the quality of the print shown by the station. like to say a word in defense of commercials. Naturally you don't want them in the middle of Gone With The Wind. But with respect to current network shows, I feel that they have a certain historical value, and as we all know (pack rats that we are) it is the throw away culture of today that is so highly sought after tommorrow. I hope to have a word for archivists next issue. Da you start a Botomax Vlrtoo Cassette the sarae vay as I do?

Who am Well a year old staff director for one of the legislative staffs of the Florida House of Representatives. I have large comic book collection Carl Barks, etc.), but am relatively inactive in that now. I also have something of an original art collection which includes Barks, Frazetta, and quite a few pieces by Knerr (The Katzenjaramer Kids). My Betaraax is plugged into a Muntz projection-type the heart of which is a Sony Trinitron. I am primarily interested in trading for my wants with serious collectors who can afford to engage in an expensive hobby like this one. I will do my best to accommodate you so long as it is within reason. We can trade Guides, want lists, lists of our collections, or any way you would like to handle it. Naturally, there are too many of us to work with all at the same time, but is my hope that we can form some sort of loose network and each find others with whom we can most easily cooperate axtd benefit from. Personal In addition to the specific episodes listed at the left, and the Hitchcock show mentioned earlier, I am looking for virtually anything that the British actress Hazel Court appeared in. I do not as yet know her full credit so there may be many. Films of particular interest would be! Devil Girl From Mars, The Raven and The Man Who Could Cheat Death In addition would be very interested in any local talk show or what not that features Mamie Van Doren or the famous fan dancer Sally Rand, would also be interested in Miss Van film: The Private Lives of Adam and Eve arc of course many others. But these are the siiand^ ready to commit time, tape or ready cash to. Help me if you canl I have a particularly close acquaintance who also has an insatiable lust for certain films. She assures me that she is ready to place cash on the barrel head, or whatever else may be agreed to in order to hold in her own two little hands Betamax video tape cassettes containing the following Destry Rides Again (!Il)« The Bobo Arsenic and Old Lace Tom Jones Adventures in Wonderland Tales of Hoffman Harat/Sade (with Peter Sellers) (She doesn't even care if they have commercials in 'em) One of my more local contacts is: Ralph Plumb, 89th Ave. North, St. Petersburg, Florida Ralph has a way of calling people on the phone no matter where in the country they may live. He has just been hooked up to Home Box Office, and says ho would like to hear from you. Would appreciate any suggestions you might have as to the future of this little venture. am not looking to going into a major business by any means, but could entertain the notion of selling advertising space, or of duplicating your contributions from camera ready copy, as I have already done in this issue. All of your letters and comments are welcome! Keep in mind that pages are primarily directed at users of tape cassette decks. However, much of what Joe has to say is of interest to all of us. Many thanks, Joe! According to list there are enough of us to set iq) an exchange program for U-Matic users. For few issues I will be providing you readers with a couple of pages dealing with our format. To begin with wo really need to contact some people who have access to Home Box Office or Ivamer Cable because there is a great deal of prograjiming there that cannot be received otherwise. I have an idea that I think will work. If wo make up enough fliers about war exchange organization and leave them at various video sales outlets wo might contact new people in urban areas. I notice that on our list there are no people from San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York/Boston. These are areas we definitely need to ccmplete our growing organization. I propose that we all send Jim to cover printing and distributing costs. This Stanpea-Addressed aivelope thing just will not cover his effort. If we have the money to afford this sophisticated equipment we can certainly afford to help Jim out in his duplicating and filing costs. better to solve our problems before they happen so send him money as soon as possible. thought we would discuss ma^zines available that ncaild be of interest to us. The first (and best) is has only been out four ronths now and is by far the closest geared to of video equipment. It only costs per year or for three years.

That price is for charter so you should get on the ball and send them some money at Third Ave. New York, They still have back issues available and I receomend that you purchase them all because there is so much information concerning video there. ^fcmorcx publishes a free publication entitled Soon. Scan is technical in content and siaall in size, but it is free. The latest issue discussed basic playback systems and monitors vs. receivers.

Jim is in Chicago with a U-Matic. dropped my subscription after two years also because of Videography but if you live in the midwest it is a must to subscribe if only for a schedule of things going c« there.

Incidentally, we're looking for someone who has both cassette formats. If you know anyone who has a and Betamax tell him that we'll give him a free year's subscription. Someone soncplace must exist becaase we exist. Right? Future articles from me will discuss technical publications (which require sifting in order to find senjething applicable, but there is always sennething dealing with home video use) and the many fine books that deal with consumer and indepedent video. I did want to mention this time that there are minute U-Matic tapes available. They are manufactured in Switzerland by and are Cobolt energized Nbst places sell them for anything from to each. Box Hutchinson. Kansas sells them for only plus shipping which runs about for used ray one tape over and over as a test and it stills functions perfectly. No head-gunming or janning.

Cramer is offering for only in quantities of They list for and are A at West Street. New York is selling used video tape (Sony, ^l and Fuji) for per minute cassette, which sounds just too good.
