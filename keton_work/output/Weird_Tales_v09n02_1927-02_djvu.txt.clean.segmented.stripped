name address city mention this magazine when answering advertisements no my friend jules de grandin shook his sleek blond head decidedly and grinned across the breakfast table at me we will go to this so kind madame tea of a certainty
yes
but hang it all i replied giving note an irritable shove with my coffee spoon donot want to go to a confounded teaparty i m too old and too sensible to dress up in a tall hat and a long coat and listen to the vaporings of a flock of silly flappers
i mordieu hear the savage de grandin chuckled delightedly
always does he find excuses for not giving pleasure to others and always does he frame those excuses to make him more important in his own eyes
enough of this friend trowbridge let us go to the kind madame party
always there is something of interest to be seen if one but knows where to look for it maybe i replied grudgingly but youve better sight than i think you have if you can find anything worth seeing at an afternoon reception he reception was in full blast when we arrived at the norman mansion in tuscarora avenue that afternoon
the air was heavy with the commingled odors of half a hundred different perfumes and the scent of hotpoured jasmine tea while the clatter of cup on saucer laughter and buzzing conversation filled the wide hall and dining room
in the long double parlors the rugs had been rolled back and young men in frock coats glided over the polished parquetry in company with girls in provocatively short skirts to the belching melody of a saxophone and the drumming rhythm of a piano
pardicu de grandin murmured as he viewed the dancers a moment your american youth take their pleasures with seriousness friend trowbridge
behold their faces
never a smile never a laugh
they might be recruits on their first parade for all the joy they show ah he broke off abruptly gazing with startled almost horrified eyes after a couple whirling in the mazes of a foxtrot at the farther end of the room
nom dun fromage he murmured softly to himself this matter will bear investigating i think eh whats that
i asked piloting him toward our hostess nothing nothing i do assure you he answered as we greeted mrs norman and passed toward the dining room
but i noticed his round blue eyes strayed more than once toward the parlors as we drank our tea and exchanged amiable nothings with a pair of elderly ladies
pardon de grandin bowed stiffly from the hips to his conversational partner and turned toward the rear drawing room there is a gentlemen here i desire to meet if you do not mind that tall distinguished one with the young girl in pink
oh i guess you mean count czerny a young man laden with an ice in one hand and a glass of punch in the other paused on his way from the dining room a rare bird all right
i knew him back in when the balkan allies were polishing off the turks duck ainot he
firstclass fightin man though
why i saw him lead a bayonet charge right into the turkish lines one day and when hed shot his pistol empty he went at the enemy with his teeth yes sir he grabbed a turk with both hands and bit his throat out hanged if he didnot
czerny de grandin repeated musingly
he is a pole perhaps
his informant laughed a bit shamefacedly say he confessed
the serbs werenot asking embarrassing questions about volunteers nationalities those days and it wasn t considered healthful for any of us to do so either
i got the impression he was a hungarian refugee from austrian vengeance but thats only hearsay
come along introduce you if you wish
i saw de grandin clasp hands with the foreigner and stand talking with him for a time and in spite of myself i could not forbear a smile at the contrast they made
the frenchman was a bare five feet four inches in height slender as a girl and like a girl possessed of almost laughably small hands and feet
his light hair and fair skin coupled with his trimly waxed diminutive blond mustache and round unwinking blue eyes gave him a curiously misleading appearance of mildness
his companion was at least six feet tall swarthyskinned and blackhaired with bristling black mustaches and fierce slategray eyes set beneath beetling black brows
his large nose was like the predatory beak of some bird of prey and the tilt of his long pointed jaw bore out the uncompromising ferocity of the rest of his visage
across his left cheek extending upward over the temple and into his hair was a knife or saberscar a streak of white showing the trail of the steel in his scalp and shining like silver inlaid in onyx against the blueblack of his smoothly pomaded locks
what they said was of course beyond reach of my ears but i saw de quick impish smile flicker across his keen face more than once to be answered by a slow languorous smile on the others dark countenance
at length the count bowed formally to my friend and whirled away with a wisp of a girl while de grandin returned to me
at the door he paused a moment inclining his shoulders in a salute as a couple of debutantes brushed past him
something i know not what drew my attention to the tall foreigner a moment and a sudden chill rippled up my spine at what i saw
above the georgetteclad shoulder of his dancing partner the counts slategray eyes ere fixed on de trim back and in them i read all the cold malevolent fury with which a caged tiger regards its keeper as he passes the bars
what on earth did you say to that fellow
i asked as the little frenchman rejoined me
he looked as if he would like to murder you
ha he gave a questioning singlesyllabled laugh
did he so
obey the noble injunction and avoid foreign entanglements friend trowbridge it is better so i think
but look here i began nettled by his manner what non non he interrupted you must be advised by me my friend
i think it would be better if we dismissed the incident from our minds
but stay perhaps you had better meet that gentleman after all
i will have the good madame norman introduce you
more puzzled than ever i followed him to our hostess and waited while he requested her to present me to the count
in a lull in the dancing she complied with his request and the foreigner acknowledged the introduction with a brief handclasp and an almost churlish nod then turned his back on me continuing an animated conversation with the largeeyed young woman in an abbreviated party frock
and did you shake his hand de grandin asked as we descended the normans steps to my waiting car
yes of course i replied
ah
tell me my friend did you notice anything ah peculiar in his grip i wrinkled my brow a moment in concentrated thought
yes i believe i did
so
what was it
hanged if i can say exactly i admitted but well it seemed this sounds absurd i know but it seemed as though his hand had two baeks no palm at all if that means anything to you
it means much my friend it means a very great deal he answered with such a solemn nod that i burst into a fit of laughter
believe me it means much more than you suspect
i must have been some two eeks later that i chanced to remark to de grandin i saw your friend count czerny in new york yesterday
indeed he answered with what seemed like more than necessary interest
and how did he impress you at the time
oh i just happened to pass him in fifth avenue i replied been up to see an acquaintance in street and was turning into the avenue when i saw him driving away from the plaza
he was with some ladies doubt de grandin responded dryly you notice him particularly say that i did especially i answered it seems to me he looked older than the day we met him at mrs yes the frenchman leaned forward eagerly
older do you say
parbleu this is of interest i suspected as much why i began but he turned away with an impatient shrug
pah he exclaimed petulantly
friend trowbridge i fear jules de grandin is a fool he entertains all sorts of strange notions
i had known the little frenchman long enough to realize that he was as full of moods as a prima donna but his erratic unrelated remarks were getting on my nerves
see here de grandin i began testily all this nonsense the sudden shrill clatter of my office telephone bell cut me short
dr trowbridge an agitated voice asked over the wire can you come right over please
this is mrs norman speaking
yes of course i answered reaching for my medicine case what is it whos ill its guy eckhart hes been taken with a fainting fit and we donot seem to be able to rouse him
very well i promised dr de grandin and i will be right over
come on de grandin i called as i shoved my hat down over my ears and shrugged into my overcoat one of mrs house guests has been taken ill i told her we were coming
mats oui he agreed hurrying into his outdoors clothes
is it a man or a woman this sick one a man i replied guy eckhart man he echoed incredulously man do you say
no no my friend that is not likely
likely or not i rejoined sharply mrs norman says hes been seized with a fainting fit and i give the lady credit for knowing what shes talking about
eh bien he drummed nervously on the cushions of the automobile seat perhaps jules de grandin really is a fool
after all it is not impossible
it certainly isnot i agreed fervently to myself as i set the car in motion
eckhart had recovered consciousness when we arrived but looked like a man just emerging from a lingering fever
attempts to get a statement from him met with no response for he replied slowly almost incoherently and seemed to have no idea concerning the cause of his illness
mrs norman was little more specific
my son ferdinand found him lying on the floor of his bath with the shower going and the window wide open just before dinner she explained
he was totally unconscious and remained so till just a few minutes ago ha is it so de grandin murmured half heedlessly as he made a rapid inspection of the patient
friend trowbridge he called me to the window what do you make of these objective symptoms a soft frequent pulse a fluttering heart suffused eyes a hot dry skin and a flushed hectic face
sounds like an arterial hemorrhage i answered promptly but theres been no trace of blood on the boys floor nor any evidence of a stain on his clothing
sure youve checked the signs over
absolutely he replied with a vigorous double nod
then to the young man now mon enfant we shall inspect you if you please quickly he examined the boys face scalp throat wrists and calves finding no evidence of even a pinprick let alone a wound capable of causing syncope
mon dieu this is strange he muttered of a surety it has the queerness of the devil perhaps the bleeding is internal but ah regardez vous friend trowbridge
he had turned down the collar of the youngsters pajama jacket more in idle routine than in hope of discovering anything tangible but the livid spot to which he pointed seemed the key to our mysterys outer door
against the smooth white flesh of the young mans left breast there showed a red angry patch such as might have resulted from a vacuum cup being held some time against the skin and in the center of the discoloration was a double row of tiny punctures scarcely larger than needlepricks arranged in horizontal divergent arcs like a pair of parentheses laid sidewise
you see he asked simply as though the queer bloodinfused spot explained everything
but he couldnot have bled much through that i protested
why the man seems almost drained dry and these wounds wouldnot have yielded more than a cubic centimeter of blood at most
he nodded gravely
blood is not entirely colloidal my friend he responded
it will penetrate the tissues to some extent especially if sufficient force is applied
but it would have required a powerful suction i replied when his rejoinder cut me short ha you have said it my friend
suction that is the word
but what could have sucked a mans blood like this
i was in a nearstupor of mystification
what indeed he replied gravely
that is for us to find out
meantime we are here as physicians
a quartergrain morphine injection is indicated here i think
you will adminster the dose i have no license in america hen i returned from my round of afternoon calls next day i found de grandin seated on my front steps in close conference with indian john
indian john was a town character of doubtful lineage who performed odd jobs of snow shoveling furnace tending and grass cutting according to season and interspersed his manual labors with brief incursions into the mercantile field when he peddled fresh vegetables from door to door
he also peddled neighborhood gossip and retailed local lore to all who would listen his claim to being a hundred years old giving him the standing of an indisputable authority in all matters antedating living memory
par dieu but you have told me much mon vieux de grandin declared as i came up the porch steps
he handed the old rascal a handful of silver and rose to accompany mo into the house
trowbridge he accused as we finished dinner that night you had not told me that this town grew up on the site of an early swedish settlement
never knew you wanted to know i defended with a grin
you know the ancient swedish church perhaps he persisted
yes thats old christ church i answered down in the east end of town donot suppose it has a hundred communicants today
our population has made some big changes both in complexion and creed since the days when the dutch and swedes fought for possession of new jersey
you will drive me to that church right away at once immediately he demanded eagerly guess so i agreed the matter now indian john been telling you a lot of fairytales perhaps he replied regarding me with one of his steady unwinking stares
not all fairytales are pleasant you know
do you recall those of chaperon rouge how do you say it red riding hood and bluebeard huh
i scoffed both as true as any of stories bet
undoubtlessly he agreed with a quick nod
the story of bluebeard for instance is unfortunately a very true tale indeed
but come let us hasten i would see that church tonight if i may hrist church the old swedish plaee of worship was a combined demonstration of how firmly adzhewn pine and walnut can resist the ravages of time and how nearly three hundred years of weather can demolish any structure erected by man
its roughpainted walls and short firmbased spire shone ghostly and pallid in the early spring moonlight and the cluster of broken and weatherworn tombstones which staggered up from its unkempt burying ground were like soiled white chicks seeking shelter from a soiled white hen
dismounting from my ear at the wicket gate of the churchyard we made our way over the level graves i in a maze of wonderment de grandin with an eagerness almost childish
occasionally he flashed the beam from his electric torch on some monument of an early settler bent to decipher the worn inscription then turned away with a sigh of disappointment paused to light a cigar but dropped my halfburned match in astonishment as my companion gave vent to a cry of excited pleasure
triomphe he exclaimed delightedly
come and behold friend trowbridge
thus far your lying friend the indian man has told the truth
regardcz he was standing beside an old weathergnawed tombstone once marble perhaps but appearing more like brown sandstone under the ray of liis flashlight
across its upper end was deeply cut the one word while below the name appeared a verse of halfobliterated doggerel lot noiuie difturb her deathleffe fleepe abote ye tombe wilde garlick keepe for if fhee wake much woe will boaft 1rayfe faither sonne holie goaft
did you bring me out here to study the orthographical eccentricities of the early settlers i demanded in disgust
ah bah he returned
let us consult the ecclesiastique
he perhaps will ask no fool s questions
no youll do that i answered tartly as we knocked at the rectory door
pardon monsieur de grandin apologized as the whitehaired old minister appeared in answer to our summons we do not wish to disturb you thus but there is a matter of great import on which we would consult you
i would that you tell us what you can if anything concerning a certain grave in your churchyard
a grave marked sarah if you please
why the elderly cleric was plainly taken aback donot think there is anything i can tell you about it sir
there is some mention in the early parish records i believe of a woman believed to have been a murderess being buried in that grave but it seems the poor creature was more sinned against than sinning
several children in the neighborhood died mysteriously some epidemic the ignorant physicians failed to understand no doubt and sarah whatever the poor womans surname may have been was accused of killing them by witchcraft
at any rate one of the beieft mothers took vengeance into her own hands and strangled poor sarah with a noose of wellrope
the witchcraft belief must have been quite prevalent too for there is some nonsense verse on the tombstone concerning her deathless sleep and an allusion to her waking from it also some mention of wild garlic being planted about her
he laughed somewhat ruefully wish they hadn t said that he added for do you know there are garlic shoots growing about that grave to this very day
old christian our sexton declares that he canot get rid of it no matter how much he grubs it up
it spreads to the surrounding lawn too he added sadly
cor dieu de grandin gasped
this is of the importance sir the old man smiled gently at the little impetuosity an odd thing he commented there was another gentleman asking about that same tomb a few weeks ago a pardon the expression a foreigner
so de grandin s little waxed mustache twitched like the whiskers of a nervous tomcat foreigner do you say
a tall rawboned fleshless living skeleton of a man with a scar on his face and a white streak in his hair wouldnot be quite so severe in my description the other answered with a smile
he certainly was a thin gentleman and i believe he had a scar on his face too though i can t be certain of that he was so very wrinkled
no his hair was entirely white there was no white streak in it sir
in fact i should have said he was very advanced in age judging from his hair and face and the manner in which he walked
he seemed very weak and feeble
it was really qiiite pitiable
sucre nom dun fromage vert de grandin almost snarled
pitiable do you say monsieur pardieu it is damnable nothing less
he bowed to the clergyman and turned to me
come friend trowbridge come away he cried
we must go to madame at once right away immediately hats behind all this mystery
i demanded as we left the parsonage door
he elevated his slender shoulders in an eloquent shrug only wish i knew he replied
someone is working the devils business of that i am sure but what the game is or what the next move will be only the good god can tell my friend
i turned the car through tunlaw street to effect a shortcut and as we drove past an italian green grocers de grandin seized my arm
stop a moment friend trowbridge he asked would make a purchase at this shop
we desire some fresh garlic he informed the proprietor as we entered the little store a considerable amount if you have it
the italian spread his hands in a deprecating gesture
we have it not signor he declared
it was only yesterday morning that we sold our entire supply
his little black eyes snapped happily at the memory of an unexpected bargain
eh what is this de grandin demanded
do you say you sold your supply
how is that know not the other replied
yesterday morning a rich gentleman came to my shop in an automobile and called me from my store
he desired all the garlic i had in stock at my own price signor and at once
i was to deliver it to his address in rupleysville the same day
ah de face assumed the expression of a crossword fiend as he begins to see the solution of his puzzle
and this liberal purchaser what did he look like
the italian showed his white even teeth in a wide grin
it was funnay he confessed
he did not look like one of our people nor like one who would eat much garlic
he was old very old and thin with a muchwrinkled face and white hair he nom dun chat the frenchman cried then burst into a flood of torrential italian
the shopkeeper listened at first with suspicion then incredulity finally in abject terror
no no he exclaimed
no signor santissima madonna you do make the joke do i so de grandin replied
wait and see foolish one
santo dio forbid
the other crossed himself piously then bent his thumb across his palm circling it with his second and third fingers and extending the fore and little fingers in the form of a pair of horns
the frenchman turned toward the waiting ear with a grunt of inarticulate disgust
what now
i asked as we got under way once more what did that man make the sign of the evil eye for de grandin
later my friend i will tell you later he answered
you ould but laugh if i told you what i suspect
pie is of the latin blood and can appreciate my fears
nor would he utter another word till we reached the norman house tkowbridge dr de granl din mrs norman met us in the hall you must have heard my prayers been phoning your office for the last hour and they said you were out and couldnot be reached up
i asked
mr eckhart again been seized with another fainting fit
he seemed so well this afternoon and i sent a big dinner up to him at oclock but when the maid went in she found hjm unconscious and she declares she saw something in his room ha de grandin interrupted
where is she this servant
i would speak ith her
wait a moment mrs norman answered i ll send for her
the girl an ungainly young southern negress came into the front hall sullen dissatisfaction written large upon her black face
now then de grandin bent his steady unwinking gaze on her what is it you say about seeing someone in the young monsieur eckhart s room hein
ah did see sumpin too the girl replied stubbornly
all don care who says all didnot see nothin ah says ah did just toted a tray o vittles up to mistuh eckhart s room an when ah opened de do dere wuz a woman dere wuz a woman yas sar a skinny blackeyed white woman abendin ober um an an and what if you please de grandin asked breathlessly
um the girl replied defiantly
ah don care whut mis norman says she wuz abitin um
ah seen her
ah knows hut she wuz
ah done hyeah tell erbout dat ol sarah woman what come up out er grave wid a long rope erbout her neck and go round bitin folks
yas sar an she wuz abitin um too
ah seen her
nonsense mrs norman commented in an annoyed whisper over de shoulder
grand dieu is it so de grandin explained and turning abruptly leaped up the stairs toward the siek mans room two steps at a time
see see friend trowbridge he ordered fiercely when i joined him at the patients bedside
behold it is the mark turning back eekhart s pajama collar he displayed two incised horizontal ares on the young mans flesh
there was no room for dispute they were undoubtedly the marks of human teeth and from the fresh wounds the blood was flowing freely
as quickly as possible we staunched the flow and applied restoratives to the patient both of us working in silence for my brain was too much in a whirl to permit the formation of intelligent questions while de grandin remained dumb as an oyster
now he ordered as we completed our ministrations we must back to that cemetery friend trowbridge and once there we must do the thing which must be done
what the devils that
i asked as we left the sickroom
non non you shall see he promised as we entered my car and drove down the street
quick the crankhandle he demanded as we descended from the ear at the cemetery gate it will make a serviceable hammer
he was prying a hemlock paling from the graveyard fence as he spoke
we crossed the unkempt cemetery lawn again and finally paused beside the tombstone of the unknown sarah
attend me friend trowbridge de grandin commanded hold the searchlight if you please
he pressed his poeket flash into my hand
now he knelt beside the grave pointing the stick he had wrenched from the fenee straight downward into the turf
with the crank of my motor he began hammering the wood into the earth
farther and farther the rough stake sank into the sod de grandin s blows falling faster and faster as the wood drove home
finally when there as less than six inches of the wicket projecting from the graves top he raised the iron high over his head and drove downward with all his might
the short hair at the back of my neck suddenly started upward and little thrills of horripilation chased each other up my spine as the wood sank suddenly as though driven from clay into sand and a low hopeless moan like the wailing of a frozen wind through an icecave wafted up to us from the depths of the grave
good god whats that
i asked aghast
for answer he leaned forward seized the stake in both hands and drew suddenly up on it
at his second tug the wood came away
see he ordered eurtly flashing the pocket lamp on the tip of the stave
for the distance of a foot or so from its pointed end the wood was stained a deep dull red
it was wet with blood
and now forever he hissed between his teeth driving the wood into the grave once more and sinking it a full foot below the surface of the grass by thrusting the crankhandle into the earth
gome friend trowbridge we have done a good work this night
i doubt not the young eekhart will soon recover from his malady is assumption was justified condition improved steadily
within a week save for a slight pallor he was to all appearances as well as ever
the pressure of the usual early crop of influenza and pneumonia kept me busily on my rounds and gradually gave up hope of getting any information from de grandin for a shrug of the shoulders was all the answer he vouchsafed to my questions
i relegated eekhart s inexplicable hemorrhages and the blood158 stained stake to the limbo of mysteries
but mornin gentlemen de tective sergeant costello greeted as he followed nora my household factotum into the breakfast room sorry i am to be disturbin your meal but theres a little case puzzlin th department that like to talk over with dr de grandin if you donot mind he looked expectantly at the little frenchman as he finished speaking his lips parted to launch upon a detailed description of the case
parbleu de grandin laughed it is fortunate for me that i have completed my breakfast clier sergent for a riddle of crime detection is to me like a red rag to a bullfrog i must needs snap at it whether i have been fed or no
speak on my friend i beseech you i am like ass all ears
the big irishman seated himself on the extreme edge of one of my heppelwhite chairs and gazed deprecatingly at the derby hat he held firmly between his knees like this he began
tis one o them mysterious disappearance cases gentlemen an whilst thinkin th young lady knows exactly where she s at an why shes there i hate to tell her folks about it
all th highhat folks ainot like you two gentlemen askin your pardon sors they mostly seems to think that a harness bulls unyform is sumpin like a livery like a shofurs or a footmans or sumpin an that a plainclothes man is just a sort o inferior servant
they donot give th police credit for no brains ysee an when one o their darters gits giddy an runs off th reservation if we tells em th gurrls run away of her own free will an accord they say were a lot o lazy bums who are tryin to dodge our laygitimate jooties be castin mud on th young ladies charaeters dye see
so when this miss esther norman disappears in broad daylightleastwise in th twilight o th day before her dance we suspects right away that th gurrls gone her own ways into th best o intentions ysee but we dasnot tell her folks as much or they ll be hollerin to th commissioner fer to git a bran new set o detectives down to headquarters so they will
now mind ye not sayin th young lady mightnot o been kidnaped understand gentlemen but i do be sayin tis most unlikely been on th force man an boy in unyform and in plain clothes fer th last twentyfive years an th number of laygitimate kidnapins o young women over ten years of age seen can be counted on th little finger o me left hand an i ainot got none there at all at all
he held the member up for our inspection revealing the fact that the little finger had been amputated close to the knuckle
de grandin elbows on the table pointed chin cupped in his hands was puffing furiously at a vilesmelling french cigarette alternately sucking down great drafts of its acrid smoke and expelling clouds of fumes in double jets from his narrow aristocratie nostrils
what is it you say lie demanded removing the cigarette from his lips
is it the so lovely mademoiselle esther daughter of that kind madame tuscarora avenue norman who is missing
yes sor costello answered tli same young ladys flew the coop accordin to my way o thinkin
mordieu the frenchman gave the ends of his blond mustache a savage twist you intrigue me my friend
say on how did it happen and when
twas about midnight last night th alarm came into headquarters the detective replied
accordin to th facts as we have em th young lady went downtown in th norman car to do some errands checked her movements up an here they are
he drew a blackleather memorandum book from his pocket and consulted it
at or thereabouts she left th house arrivin at th ocean trust company at five minutes before th instytootion closed for th day
she drew out three hundred an thirty dollars an sixtyfive cents an left th bank goin to madame gerard s where she tried on a party dress for th dance which was bein given at her house that night
she left madame at leavin orders for th dress to be delivered to her house immeejately an dismissed her shofur at th corner o dean an tunlaw streets sayin she was goin to deliver some vegy tables an whatnot to a pore family she an some o her friends was keepin till their old man gits let out o jail twas meself an clancey me buddy that put him there when we caught him redhanded in a job o housebreakin too
well to return to th young lady she stopped at pete store in tunlaw street an bought a basket o fruit an canned things at an he clamped his longsuffering derby between his knees and spread his hands emptily before us
yes and de grandin prompted dropping the glowing end of his cigarette into his coffee cup
an thats all responded the irishman
she just walked off an no one ainot seen her since sor
but cordieu such things do not occur my friend de grandin protested
somewhere you have overlooked a factor in this puzzle
you say no one saw her later
have you nothing whatever to add to the tale
well the detective grinned at him there are one or two little incidents but they ainot of any importance in th case as far as i can see
just as she left store an old gink tried to make her but she give him th air an he went off an didn t bother her no more a liked to seen th old boy at that
day before yesterday there was an old felly hangin round by the silk mills annoyin th gurrls as they come off from work
clancey me mate saw im an started to take im up an darned if th old rummy wasnot strong as a bull know he broke clean away from clancey an darn near broke his arm in th bargain
belike twas th same man accosted miss norman outside store
ah de grandin s slender white fingers began beating a devils tattoo on the tablecloth
and who was it saw this old man annoy the lady heinf costello grinned widely twas pete bacigalupo himself sor he answered
pete swore he recognized th old geezer as havin come to his store a month or so ago in an autymobile an bought up all his entire stock o garlic
huh
th fool dago said he wouldnot a gone after th felly for a hundred dollars said he had th pinkeye or th evil eye or some such thing
them wops sure do bum me up dim et le diablc de grandin leaped up oversetting his chair in his mad haste
and we sit here like three poissons davril like poor fish while he works his devilish will on her
quick sergeant
quick friend trowbridge
your hats your coats the motor
oh make haste my friends fly fly i implore you even now it may be too late as though all the fiends of pandemonium were at his heels he raced from the breakfast room up the stairs three steps at a stride and down the upper hall toward his bedroom
nor did he cease his shouted demands for haste throughout his wild flight
cuckoo
the sergeant tapped his forehead significantly
i shook my head as i hastened to the hall for my driving clothes
no i answered shrugging into my topcoat got a reason for everything he does but you and i canot always see it sergeant
you said a mouthful that time doe he agreed pulling his hat down over his ears the damdest craziest frog i ever seen but at that hes got more sense than nine men out o ten
to rupleysville friend trowbridge de grandin shouted as he leaped into the seat beside me
make haste i do implore you
oh jules de grandin your grandfather wasan imbecile and all your ancestors were idiots but you are the greatest zany in the family
why oh why do you require a sunstroke before you can see the light foolish one
i swung the machine down the pike at highest legal speed but the little frenchman kept urging greater haste
sang de dieu sang de saint denis sang du diablel he wailed despairingly
can you not make this abominable car go faster friend trowbridge
oh ah helas if we are too late
i shall hate myself i shall loathe myself pardieu i shall become a carmelite friar and eat fish and abstain from swearing
7e took scarcely twenty minutes to cover the tenmile stretch to the aggregation of tumbledown houses which was rupleysville but my companion was almost frothing at the mouth when i drew up before the local apology for a hotel
tell me monsieur de grandin cried as he thrust the hostelrys door open with his foot and brandished his slender ebony cane before the astonished proprietors eyes tell me of tin vieillard an old old man with snowwhite hair and an evil face who has lately come to this so detestable place
i would know where to find him right away immediately at once say the bonifaee demanded truculently where dye git that stuff
who are you to be askin do costello shouldered his way past de grandin and displayed his badge you answer this gentlemans questions an answer em quick an accurate or run you in see
the innkeepers defiant attitude melted before the detectives show of authority like frost before the sunrise
guess you must mean mr zerny he replied sullenly
lie come here about a month ago an rented the hazelton house down th road about a mile
comes up to town for provisions every day or two and stops in here sometimes for a he halted abruptly his face suffused with a dull flush
yeah
costello replied
go on an say it we all know what he stops here for
now listen buddy he stabbed the air two inches before the mans face with a blunt forefinger donot know viiether this here zerny fellys got a tellyphone or not but if he has you just lay off tellin im were cornin git me
if anyones tipped him th office when we git to his plaee eomin back here and plaster more padlocks on this place o yours than got medals on his blouse
savvy
come away sergent come away friend trowbridge de grandin besought almost tearfully
bandy not words with the cancre we have work to do
down the road we raced in the direction indicated by the hotelkeeper till the picket fence and broken shutters of the hazelton house showed among a rank copse of secondgrowth pines at the bend of the highway
the shrewd wind of early spring was moaning and soughing among the black boughs of the pine trees as we ran toward the house and though it was bright with sunshine on the road there was chill and shadow about us as we climbed the sagging steps of the old buildings ruined piazza and paused breathlessly before the paintless front door
shall knock
costello asked dubiously involuntarily sinking his voice to a whisper
but no de grandin answered in a low voice what we have to do here must be done quietly my friends
he leaned forward and tried the doorknob with a light tentative touch
the door gave under his hand swinging inward on protesting hinges and we tiptoed into a dark dustcarpeted hall
a shaft of sunlight slanting downward from a chink in one of the window shutters show ed innumerable dustmotes flying lazily in the air and laid a bright oval of light against the warped floorboards
huh empty as a in jerusalem costello commented disgustedly looking about the unfurnished rooms but de grandin seized him by the elbow with one hand while he pointed toward the floor with the ferrule of his slender ebony walking stick
empty perhaps he conceded in a low vibrant whisper but not recently mon ami
where the sunbeam splashed on the uneven floor there showed distinctly the mark of a booted foot two marks a trail of them leading toward the rear of the house
right yare the detective agreed left his track here an no mistake
ha de grandin bent forward till it seemed the tip of his highbridged nose would impinge on the tracks
gentlemen he rose and pointed forward into the gloom with a dramatic flourish of his cane they are here let us go through the gloomy hall we followed the trail by the aid of flashlight stepping carefully to avoid creaking boards as much as possible
at length the marks stopped abruptly in the center of hat had fonnerly been the kitchen
a disturbance in the dust told here the walker had doubled on his tracks in a short circle and a ringbolt in the floor gave notice that we stood above a trapdoor of some sort
careful friend costello de grandin warned have ready your flashlight when i fling back the trap
ready
he bent seized the rusty ringbolt and heaved the trapdoor back so violently that it flew back with a thundering crash on the floor beyond
the cavern had originally been a cellar for the storage of food it seemed and was brickwalled and earthfloored without window or ventilation opening of any sort
a dank musty odor assaulted our nostrils as we leaned forward but further impressions were blotted out by the sight directly beneath us
white as a figurine of earven alabaster the slender bare body of a girl lay in sharp reverse silhouette against the darkness of the cavern floor her ankles crossed and firmly lashed to a stake in the earth one hand doubled behind her back in the position of a wrestlers hammerlock grip and made firm to a peg in the floor while the left am was extend162 ed straight outward its wrist pinioned to another stake
her luxuriant fair hair had been knotted together at the ends then staked to the ground so that her head was drawn far back exposing her rounded throat to its fullest extent and on the earth beneath her left breast and beside her throat stood two porcelain bowls
crouched over her as the relic of a man an old old hideously wrinkled witchhusband with matted white hair and beard
in one hand he held a long gleaming doubleedged dirk while with the other he caressed the girl s smooth throat with gloating strokes of his skeleton fingers
howly mither
county galway brogue broke through his american accent at the horrid sight below us
my god
i exclaimed all the breath in my lungs suddenly seeming to freeze in my throat
bonjour monsieur le vampire
jules de grandin greeted nonchalantly leaping to the earth beside the pinioned girl and waving his walking stick airily
by the horns of the devil but you have led us a merry chase baron lajos czuczron of transylvania the crouching creature emitted a bellow of yury and leaped toward de grandin brandishing his knife
the frenchman gave ground with a quick catlike leap and grasped his slender cane in both hands near the top
next instant he had ripped the lower part of the stick away displaying a fine threeedged blade set in the canes handle and swung his point toward the froth ingmouthed thing which mouthed and gibbered like a beast at bay he cried with a mocking upwardlilting accent
you did not expect this eh friend i give you the partyof surprize the centuries have been long mon vieux but the reckoning has come at last
say now will you die by the steel or by starvation the aged monster fairly champed his gleaming teeth in fury
his eyes seemed larger rounder to gleam like the eyes of a dog in the firelight as he launched himself toward the little frenchman the frenchman sank backward on one foot then straightened suddenly forward stiffening his swordarm and plunging his point directly into the charging beastman s distended red mouth
a scream of mingled rage and pain filled the cavern with deafening shrillness and the monster half turned as though on an invisible pivot clawed with horrid impotence at the wirefine blade of de grandin s rapier then sank slowly to the earth his death cry stilled to a sickening gurgle as his throat filled with blood
fini de grandin commented laconically drawing out his handkerchief and wiping his blade with meticulous care then cutting the unconscious girls bonds with his pocketknife
drop down your overcoat
friend trowbridge he added that we may eover the poor childs nudity until we can piece out a wardrobe for her
now then as he raised her to meet the hands costello and i extended into the pit if we clothe her in the motor rug your jacket sergent friend topcoat and my shoes she will be safe from the chill
parbleu i have seen women refugees from the boche who could not boast so complete a toilette
esther norman hastily clothed in her patchwork assortment of garments wedged in the front seat between de grandin and me we began our triumphant journey home
an would ye mind tellin me how ye knew where to look for th continued on page back one is struck with wonder that we know as much of the story as we do that we comprehend as fully as we do the nature of the strange doom that rushed out onto humanity from a lonely hill in southern scotland
had it not been for one small thing the casual curiosity of a young student that appalling invasion would remain to this day quite unexplained
a trifle certainly that passing interest of a rather commonplace young man but except for that interest and what it led to we would understand nothing of the vast drama that was played around and above us
not that our ignorance or knowledge could have affected the outcome of that drama beside the tremendous forces that rose and fought and crashed mankind was but a mass of tiny frightened pigmies running about beneath battling giants
yet one remembers that it was one of those same pigmies it was a single embittered insane man who loosed all of that ancient terror upon us and caused an ageold cosmic feud to flare out in dreadful war universe struggling with uuiverse in titanic combat immense unthinkable the story as we know it begins on that sultry afternoon in august when young ernest hunter came into the village of leadanfoot and dismounted wearily from hi battered bicycle
a day of pedaling over the scotch hills had made him regret somewhat his decision to visit glasgow on his holiday trip
one of the numberless students who swarm over the english highways each summer on cycles and afoot he began to think that this sidetrip over the border was after all a mistake
but once inside the dark cool little inn with a mug of foaming cider at hand these doubts fled and the world again seemed a very pleasant place
this hunter lengthy and stooping of figure with a thin humorous face was a social type and looked about now for possible company
except for himself there was no one in the long low room but the two men who stood near the open door the stocky aproned innkeeper and a whitewhiskered wrinkled old man with whom he was conversing
his cider finished hunter rose and lounged toward them catching a few words of their talk
thunder
no the innkeeper was exclaiming
who ever heard thunder like that
the other was nodding his agreement when their conversation was broken into by friendly voice
thunderstorm here lately he asked came through a bad one down at carlisle wednesday
a messy sort of thing
lightning fired a house there
the host contemplated him doubtfully before replying
it was not a thunderstorm we spoke of he told him
there was a queer thing here i donot just know here heard it and so did i he paused but hunter was interested and questioning him further found that the subject of discussion as a series of strange detonations that had been heard throughout the village on the night before a succession of deeptoned rumbling explosions that seemed to come from the group of hills west of leadanfoot
all in the village had heard the sounds and most had set it down as distant thunder but the innkeeper quite evidently disagreed
like no thunder you ever heard he assiued hunter
boom boom boom boom boom regular like a big cannon firing heard enough thunder in my time and this sound was not like it not like it at all
eh the wrinkled oldster sagely nodded agreement
maybe it was blasting you heard hunter suggested
some farmer up there doing something of that kind peihaps
for a moment the innkeeper contemplated him with that fine scorn with which the rural native regards a stranger ignorant of local geography
farmer up there he repeated in the tone with which one would reject an unworthy statement
why theres not a house through all those hills
too steep they are and wild
i doubt if a single soul has lived there for the last ten years
the aged removed his pipe from his mouth to voice dissent
how about the scienteefic chappies he asked
well except for them conceded the host somewhat discomfited while the older man replaced the pipe and regarded him with stern gravity
possibly to cover up his mistake he went rapidly on with explanations for benefit
two science professors they are that have a cabin on one of the hills
for near a year theyve been there studying the glassy forts i hear
i never saw them myself for they get everything they need over at dykirk
a term in his speech caught interest
the glassy forts he repeated interrogatively some piles of old stone ruins on some of the hilltops around here the innkeeper explained
some of them have parts of stones all melted into glass
lightning did it i suppose
around here we call them the glassy forts and its them that these men are working with digging and such
oh i see said hunter
more slowly he continued do you know like to see some of them if it wouldnot take too long
do you suppose i could in a day
well you can if youre a good climber his host informed him
lowder hill is the nearest to here and they say theres such ruins on top of it not so steep either another hill right next to lowder kerachan hill but its too high and rough to get up and down in a day hardly on kerachan that the science men are staying i think best try lowder though stay here tomorrow then hunter told him and make the trip so infernally tired of pedaling that a day of tramping will be a rest
the prospect had intrigued the young student and before retiring for the night he acquired enough information to guide him on the next days trip
also he had been furnished with a number of weird anecdotes concerning the glassy forts which were evidently objects of local superstition
the sun was an hour high the next morning when he left the inn a small package of lunch in his pocket
he swung quickly through the village and tramped steadily over stony roads and rough moor toward the dark looming bulk of the western hills whose sides were almost completely hidden by dense forests of fir
hunter had been advised to climb lowder hill from its farther side so on reaching it he walked in a great circle around its base through a narrow wooded valley that separated it from kerachan hill
as he passed along this valley he was struck by its utter peace and quiet
the smaller forest creatures were frightened away by the sound of his coming but once he glimpsed the vague dun shape of a deer slipping through the trees in the distance and now and then startled groups of birds burst tip through the trees at his approach noisily discussing hint in disparaging terms in their flight
the busy shouting bellowing world seemed inconceivably remote in that tranquil spot
the sun swung higher and higher while he pushed his way forward
and in the world that seemed so very far in leadanfoot and london and new york and peking other men were pushing their way forward in their particular groove in life scheming for disks of metal and slips of paper for the admiration of their fellows for riches or fame or knowledge
a vast mass of tiny conspirators each intent on his own plots each sublimely confident of the importance of his especial business and its outcome
and hidden in those quiet hills into which hunter advanced was that which was to upset all of those minute conspiracies like little houses of caids a door through which was to come a menacing terror unknown to man so that presently through this world and worlds above and beyond would run death and confusion and an ancient dread sun was near its greatest height when hunter came to the farther side of lowder hill and the rude path that twisted up that side
he stared at it rather doubtfully for the hill seemed very steep and the day was almost half gone
then with a shrug he was about to step forward to the path when the sound of a step behind him made him wheel in surprize
a strange figure was walking toward him a small middleaged man whose clothes were dirty and torn by briars
he was hatless and on his pink round spectacled face was an expression of dazed wonder
he came forward until he was within a few yards of the astonished hunter then stopped and regarded him mildly
not powell he whispered softly confidentially
not he ceased speaking suddenly looked around with a certain surprize then sank to the ground in a dead faint
in a moment hunter was by the mans side applying his vagne ideas of first aid
he got his pocket flask between the mans teeth and a little brandy down his throat which almost instantly pulled him back to consciousness
the man lay there his eyes sweeping over face then asked quite unexpectedly what time is it
on finding that it was almost noon he straightened to a sitting position all right now he assured the student motioning the latter to a seat on the ground beside him
his glance wavered about the scene then came back to hunter whom he regarded intently before addressing him
who you are i donot know he began and as hunter started to explain he added and it doesnot matter had some education havenot you
ah medical student
that makes it easier much easier
hunter began to think that the man was still dizzy delirious
i better help you back to leadanfoot he asked
there would not be time the other answered strangely was going to leadanfoot myself for but there you do not know
there is time to get back though
you and but first you should hear he caught the doubting halffearful expression on the young mans face
no not a madman he assured him almost gently
but i need help badly
need your help
but help for what asked hunter think if you would just go back with me to the village no answered the other decisively
there was a pause in which the older man stared across the green silence of the valley with unseeing eyes
suddenly he turned to the watching puzzled student will put it this way he began
suppose someone was planning to kill every living person in the village yonder to wipe it out utterly would you try to prevent it at wondering reply he continued of course you would
now go farther still
suppose someone something was trying to kill every human being on earth to annihilate the world as we know it
would you try to stop that too
the younger man stared at him blankly
would you persisted the other
why yes naturally answered the student and the older man sighed
it is to prevent that that i need your help he said quietly
before hunter could comment on that startling statement the man rushed on am going to tell you enough of the matter to help you understand what threatens
you will not think me a madman when you hear
we have little time here an hour perhaps before we must start back
but it is enough for me to tell you will wish to know who i am
marlowe is my name and until a year ago i held a position on the staff of the trent museum in london
it was there that i met powell some three years ago dr henry powell he was an elderly physics professor lately retired from cambridge
that was all he ever told me of his past for even after we became better acquainted he was closemouthed about his former career
by chance i found the reason for that
a friend told me that powell had left cambridge under a cloud
it seems that he had been working for many months in collaboration with a fellow professor wooding by name on an elementchanging experiment
you know transmute uranium into radium or radium into lead
modern alchemy they were attempting after a year of work together the two had split over some disagreement each carrying on the experiment alone
wooding was the first of the two to publish his results and immediately powell claimed that his former partner in work had stolen his own results
there was rather a scandal over the matter but an investigating committee ruled that charges were unproved so he was retired from the university
i never talked with powell on the matter and never learned the right of it but i could see that the thing had embittered him greatly so that he was wont to snarl viciously at all scientific people and in fact nearly all people of any kind
he grated on me considerably sometimes for he was like an animated bottle of acid thinlipped sardonic sneering
but one thing drew us together a common interest in archeology
in fact that branch of knowledge was my work at the museum and powell had taken it up as a sort of hobby to occupy his restless mind i suppose
we got acquainted through his visits to the museum and had many a talk thereafter
he was intensely interested in the vitrified forts of scotland as they are called
piles of stone ruins on some of the scottish hills and in a few valleys with some of the stones melted into glass heard of them
well it was radical theory that those glassy streaks ere not made by lightning as is commonly supposed but by some powerful weapon or ray striking from above
you will see what a revolution in conventional archeological thought would be the result if he could prove that
he got to be a fanatic on the subject and spent most of his time roaming about scotland and hunting and digging in such ruins had been off on such a trip for several weeks when he sent me an urgent wire from a scotch village named dykirk
he had made a great discovery he said but needed my help and offered me a handsome salary for my aid
my own interest was aroused by his messageso i procured the necessary leave from the museum and went at once being met by powell when i stepped off the train
it turned out that his discovery was on the summit of a hill some miles from dykirk named keraclian hill
he had had a little cottage or cabin built on the hill and had lived in it for some weeks
it took us most of the day to get to his little home so we stowed my luggage and waited until the next morning to inspect his discovery
and it was really astounding
the summit of the hill was flat and there with a few crumbling stono blocks scattered about but in the center of that level expanse was a shallow pit newly dug that was circular in shape and perhaps twenty feet across
at its bottom a foot or so from the surface of the ground lay a flat round stone the surface of which was almost completely covered by a mass of strange characters carven into it deeply
it was to decipher this inscription that powell needed my help for i am by way of being an expert in hieroglyphics cuneiform writing and such
he said that he had found this inscription beneath a protecting layer of cement of some kind and was afire to learn its meaning as he well might be
so i settled in the little cabin and began work that very day
to my surprize i found the inscription quite easy to decipher for all that the characters were totally strange and unknown
whoever had carved it had placed in it here and there small pictures symbols giving a key for its translation purposely
within a month i had translated and arranged my translations of it and found that the inscription told a stupendous incredible story
according to it these ruins of forfs that lay scattered through scotland had been built ages before by a race of strange folk who had invaded the earth then
and these strangers had come not from another planet as one might suppose but from a single atom in the earth
this will sound incredible to you as at first it did to me but consider
we know that each atom of our earth consists of a number of electrons revolving about a nucleus and what is that but a miniature solar system
just as our sun and its circling planets may be an atom in a vastly larger system and so on infinitely perhaps
the idea is not new it was advanced years ago
and in this particular atom of the earth on its electrons its tiny planets dwelt a race proportionately tiny the atomic people i will call them
they had crowded over every one of their electronplanets and were now gradually stifling from their everincreasing numbers
they had science a strange sort of science and now at the time of their greatest need one of their scientists announced a startling discovery
he had found a way by which the size of any object could be increased or decreased indefinitely at will
and the secret of this was stunning in its very simplicity
we know that the universal allpervading ether is the base of everything
vibrations of that ether in a certain octave cause light in a different octave radio waves in still another chemical rays
but what we do not know as yet what the scientists of the atomic people had learned is that all matter itself is but another vibration of that ether in a different lower octave
that stone that tree you and all but different vibrations in the ether
and the atomic scientists had found that as a stone is simply an etheric vibration by raising the frequency of vibration the stone would be made larger by lowering that frequency it would be made smaller
their method of changing that frequency was told by the inscription
they would ascertain the frequency of vibration of an object then concentrate on it other artificial electric vibrations much like radio waves which would change the vibratory frequency of the object just as the rate of swing of a pendulum can be raised or lowered by a tiny force applied to it at the correct moment
thus these atomic people could make any object make even themselves large enough to dwarf their world or small enough to disappear entirely
it was a chance to relieve their crowding numbers and they seized it at once
using their discovery to grow in size they burst up from their own atom into this world into our earth and found that the atom that was their universe was an atom of a simple grain of sand on earth
thai sandgrain though held their world so they built a great structure around it in what is now scotland so that it would always be there as a refuge for them to flee to in ease of need
that attended to up from the atom out of the sandgrain streamed their people gigantic masses of them
the earth then was savage and forbidding but nothing daunted they spread over its surface began to raise their structures of stone to shape this world to their will
it must have seemed to them that they were secure forever in this greater universe
but now came disaster
certain adventurous spirits among them were not satisfied to stop in this universe
they saw the sun and its attendant planets and realized that this our own solar system was after all only an atom in a still greater universe
so a number of them using the same method of changing size grew again until they had entered the world above this the universe in which ours is but an atom
now in that greater universe in that superworld as i shall call it there was civilization a civilization of beings who had advanced far beyond the crude semibarbarism of the people of the atom
so when the atomic invaders entered their world the superpeople knew they had come from beneath from an atom for they themselves had long possessed that power of changing size which the atomic people had just discovered
although these superpeople promptly beat back the invaders in that first attack time after time in the years that followed the warlike people of the atom persisted in attempting to enter the superworld which was so much fairer than either their own world or this one long while their attacks continued until finally the patience of the superpeople was exhausted and they gathered together all their forces to crush these atomic invaders foiever
they poured down from their greater universe to this earth and then was a battle such as was never known before the people of the superworld and the people of the atom locked in a deathstruggle smiting with strange weapons a colossal war raging over the shuddering earth that reeled beneath them
the atomic invaders could not stand against the mighty weapons of the superpeople and soon all of them not slain were fleeing in dread to their own world that sandgrain that held their universe
they sped back to that grain and down into it dwindling in size and vanishing until of all their number only their dead remained on earth
and now the superpeople set about to seal them forever within that atom within that sandgrain so that never again should they break out and carry war and death through the superworld
to accomplish this they set that grain of sand within a circle of perpetual electric force a field of strange force within which it was impossible to grow or dwindle in size as the atomic people had done by changing the frequency of etheric vibration
thus the people of the atom were locked foiever within their own tiny universe
this accomplished they covered the sandgrain and the forces they placed around it setting over them a great stone on which was written the history of what had happened and which warned whoever might find the stone in the future never to tamper with or change what had been done lest they loose again the atomic invaders upon the earth and the superworld alike
having done this the superpeople left the earth to its own devices and passed up into their own greater universe
came then on earth the painj ful upward surge of changing ascending species the long road from anthropoid to troglodyte to modern man
the structures of the atomic people crumbled soon until only a few remnants were left
over all the world it was as if their invasion had never been nor did men dream that such people had held the earth ages before themselves
and up in a scottish hill under a great stone that was covered by the drifting dirt of ages lay a grain of sand that held war and death and terror in a single atom of which the atomic people were prisoned for all time was the colossal epic the inscription narrated
and it was so convincing that neither powell nor i doubted it
but now a dispute arose between us
i believed that we should heed the warning of the inscription and not delve farther into the thing lest we loose dread upon the world
but powell was afire with curiosity and ould not listen
so with help we removed the great circular stone and set it to one side
and beneath it as it had foretold we found the sandgrain that held the atomic world
under the circular stone was a cube of the same smooth rock some six feet square
on the upper surface of this cube was set a small plate of smooth metal at the center of which lay the sandgrain set in the metal
around this metal plate embedded within the surface of the cube was a circle of seven little blocks that glowed steadily with a feeble purple light
in daylight the little blocks seemed merely purple in color and it was only in darkness that their luminosity became apparent
without doubt that circle of glowing blocks was the producer of the force mentioned in the inscription the force that made impossible within their field that held the atomic people prisoners in the sandgrain
from that day onward powell took me less and less into his confidence
he had fitted up a small laboratory near the cabin and began working there on some problem connected with what he had found
once or twice he consulted me eoncernirig the meaning of certain technical parts of the inscription but aside from thgt he told me nothing of what he was doing and i decided that i was wasting time to stay
it was on the very day that i meant to tell powell so and leave that he came running toward me excitedly with the news that his experiment had succeeded
and when i found the nature of that experiment i as astounded
he had been attempting to follow up the sparse details given in the inscription and rediscover the method of changing size
and he had done it
he showed me the apparatus he had worked out a compact black ease which strapped around his chest and which would cause everything within its field of action to grow or decrease in size
and standing there on the hilltop he grew in size until he towered up a giant of a hundred feet then dwindled until he was an inch in height a tiny manikin
he was exultant and i thought that at last he would leave the hilltop and cover the sandgrain once more
i pointed out to him what good he might accomplish in the world with that great power but he only snarled at me and for the first time revealed his intention
he was planning to dwindle in size until he could enter that atomic world to go down into the sandgrain to the atomic universe
short of force i used all my efforts to prevent him for i was aghast at such a plan
but he went on unheeding making his preparations for the trip
he dug out and removed the little circle of blocks around the sandgrain then gradually began to dwindle in size until he was a tiny figure a few inches high standing on the metal circle near the grain of sand
smaller and smaller he became until he vanished entirely from my sight and i knew that he had entered the sandgrain
for three days i atched beside the stone cube waiting for his return
it was toward evening of the third day that he finally came back a tiny upright form on the metal plate that grew swiftly to the man i knew
he had come back
he had come back but changed
he seemed to be filled with an immense excitement to be spurred on by some hidden purpose
he gave small answer to my flood of questions
he had found the atomic world had been guided down into that particular atom of the grain by certain signs a phrase which he did not explain
as to the people of the atom he said only that there were many of them and that they were different
more he would not tell me and my fear my misgivings increased night of disaster rushed upon us a week afjer his return
i was asleep in the cabin while powell worked as i thought in the laboratory
some time after midnight i woke and sensed that powell was not in the cabin
i dressed hurriedly and found that he was not in the laboratory either
instantly i knew where he was and hurried up to the hilltop and to the pit on that hilltop that held the stone cube and the sandgrain
he was standing on the edge of that pit watching intensely but at the sound of my approach he wheeled instantly holding a little stone cone in his hand the end of which glowed suddenly with dull green light
at the same moment i fell in a heap to the ground and lay there quite motionless seemingly paralyzed unable to move a muscle
and powell laughed
he mocked and taunted me and for the first time disclosed the depth of his plans
he was going to loose once more the atomic invaders upon our world
he had gone down into their world and conspired with those in power there promising to free them from the world where they were prisoners to release them upon the earth and the superworld
first he boasted the atomic invaders were to strike at the world beyond this at the superworld to stab out unexpectedly at their ancient enemies in that greater universe crushing them by an unlookedfor attack
then free from any possible interference the invading hordes would sweep over earth and he laughed wildly as he pictured to me the destruction of the races of man and their works dwelling especially on the fear and terror of his enemies
for the first time i saw that the man was completely insane an embittered maniac who secreted hate for all mankind as the result of his wrongs real or fancied
even while he spoke a slight humming sound arose from the pit
the humming waxed swiftly to a loud droning then up from the pit floated a black disk some three feet across and swiftly growing
hovering a few feet above the ground it continued to grow and the droning became a loud booming a tremendous rumbling thunder
even as i stared at it lying there i fathomed the cause of that rolling thunder knew that it was the sudden expansion of the disk that beat out those thick waves of sound
the disk grew until it was perhaps thirty feet across then ceased expanding
it slid gently down toward us until it was nearly touching the ground and i saw that it was crowded with dark shapes that pushed toward the rail to stare down at us
then down from the edge came a folding metal ladder and clambering down this ladder came three creatures shapes grotesque and terrible three of the atomic people had thought of them as being somewhat human perhaps with different features or coloring but still essentially human
but these things they were reptilian saurian
in height they were a little under the human standard and their figures were even roughly human in shape with the head carried erect a squat powerful body two thick bowed lower limbs and two short arms ending in cruel curved talons
but with that rough travesty on the human shape all resemblance ceased
to begin with the things were completely covered with thick hard scales like those of a crocodile
their heads were peaked instead of round with gaping fanged mouths and small black glittering eyes browless and lashless like the eyes of a snake
they were noseless and earless and their only sign of clothing was a queer sort of metallic armor that seemed more designed to carry their weapons than as clothing
lying there motionless regarding them with sickened horror i saw the three advance to powell who greeted them with a queer gesture
one brought forth a tablet like a small slate on which he wrote then passed it to powell who studied it then wrote in turn and handed it back
evidently such writing was only means of communication with the things
for a few minutes they conferred in that fashion with powell then returned to the disk which immediately ascended from its hovering position on the hilltop
as it rose it grew spreading out swiftly in everexpanding size growing until it had shut off the light of all the stars for a few seconds then seemingly breaking up into small masses cloudily disappearing
it had become so large that it was invisible had passed from this universe into that greater one
for a moment i wondered if its momentary eclipse of the stars would cause any stargazer to guess at what was happening then realized that to any chance watcher of the sky it would seem only like a drifting cloud if noticed at all
again rose the humming from the pit many times louder growing to an earsplitting thunder as another force of the atomic people floated up from the pit a great mass of tiny black circles miniatures of the first disk that drifted up and rose at once into the air not stopping to confer with powell as had the first
and as that mass of disks rose above the hilltop the familiar droning was again waxing louder as another mass of them came up
how many of the disks streamed up from the atom while i lay there i can not guess
their number seemed infinite but my memories are fragmentary disjointed
i must have been unconscious for a few minutes at least for i remember that amid the rumbling thunder of the rising disks as i watched powell who was gazing triumphantly at their coming a dizzying blackness seemed to descend on my brain and when consciousness returned the last mass of disks was rising from the pit vanishing like the others in the sky above
tntil now powell had held me prisoner with the glowing cone which he had placed on the ground before conferring with the atomic people so that it held me prisoner without his attention
now he picked it up and permitted me to reenter the cabin where he forced me to lie down in the bunk then placed the cone again on the table in the room still pointing toward me still holding me a prisoner powerless to move he did not kill me outright i can not say
i think it was only because he desired someone even a prostrate enemy to whom he might boast of what he was doing that he desired someone to know the power and the menace that he really was
it must have been so for the next day he boasted for hours to me of what he was doing
he spoke of the great force of invaders i had seen and said that even by that time their numbers and mighty weapons would have crushed into submission the people of the superworld
he spoke too of the paralyzing cone that held me prisoner a weapon which he had brought back from the atomic world and revealed that he had another one on his person also
it was he said a ray that neutralized the electric messages in the nervous system thus wiping out the commands of the brain in that system so that while reflex actions like the breathing of the lungs and beating of the heart were unaffected the conscious commands of the brain to the muscles were nullified paralyzing those muscles
all of that day and all through the next night i lay in the bunk without moving a muscle save only an hour in which he permitted me to eat i heard him leave the cabin early the next morning the second after the coming of the invaders this very morning
lying there i listened with dull despair to the wind slamming the door of the cabin
the cone on the table was in the line of my vision and suddenly i gasped with hope for at a particularly hard slam that cone had rolled a little way toward the tables edge
i waited breathless
then just as my hope was beginning to die the door slammed to with all the winds force behind it and the cone rolled from the table to the floor breaking and exploding there in a flash of intense green light my first move was to search the cabin for a gun but there was none
the cabin stood at the edge of the bare and treeless hilltop and from its window i could see head bobbing about in the pit of the sandgrain as he prepared for the coming of the second force of invaders
i knew that he must be imprisoned or killed at once but knew too that he carried with him another of the paralyzing cones so that i dared not rush him on the open hilltop
neither could i remain in the cabin so my only chance was to make my way to the nearest village and get help or at least a gun
so i slipped out a rear window and got safely away without being seen by him
all of this morning it took me to get down the hill and when i met you here i knew i should not have time to get to a village as i had planned but must go back and do what i could myself
and now i have told you all
up on that hill powell is awaiting the second invasion of those monsters from the atom an invasion that will annihilate our world
if we can overpower him and replace the glowing blocks around the sandgrain we shall have prevented disaster
if not but do you believe the story
will you help me
hunter answered slowly his brain whirling from the things he had heard so incredible he began biit the booming sounds you mentioned they heard that in leadanfoot
it seems so queer though suddenly he thrust a hand toward marlowe believe you he told him want to help
the other gripped his hand silently then glanced up at the sun
we have perhaps four hours he said rising
hunter too jumped to his feet and for a moment they looked together up the dark sides of kerachan hill
presently the two men were forging steadily up that hillside
they spoke little and their faces were set drawn
the sun was falling ever more swiftly toward the west and always their eyes measured the distance between that descending sun and the horizon
by the time they surmounted the first rough heights and began their progress up the thinlywooded upper half of the hill the gray veils of twilight were already obscuring the surrounding country
over peaks and valleys over forests and grassy fields lay a strange silence ominous foreboding
as they toiled up toward the summit through the thickening dusk it seemed to hunter that the whole world was silent breathless tensely waiting omplete darkness had fallen when marlowe turned and made a cautioning gesture
we are very near the summit now he told hunter in a whisper
for sake go quietly
together they crept upward through thick underbrush and over jagged rocks until they crouched at the edge of the smooth grassy space that was the hills summit
this summit was not exactly level but sloped down from them in a slight grade and at its center hunter saw the black yawning hole marlowe had mentioned the pit that held the sandgrain
marlowe was tugging at his sleeve
powell down at the other edge he whispered excitedly
glancing down to that farther edge of the summit hunter saw there a thin spare figure dimly outlined against the stars the figure of a man who was gazing silently at the twinkling lights of a distant village
and over to their right at the very edge of the bare summit was the rough dark mass that he knew must be the small cabin
again marlowe twitched his sleeve
we must rush him from both sides he told hunter
you crawl around the right side of the summit and i will take the left and when you get near enough go for him give him time to get that cone out
with a whispered good luck he wrung hand and began to creep stealthily around the left edge of the hilltop
his heart pounding violently hunter crept forward on the right side toward the man at the summits edge who still stood motionless watching the distant lights
hunter wondered where marlowe was in the darkness
by now he was crawling past the open door of the cabin keeping close within the shadow of the little building
from that point he could glimpse in the starlight the profile of the man they stalked
a strong mad face it was with burning eyes beneath a mass of gleaming irongray hair a face that was turned toward the south and its distant lights as though fascinated by them
suddenly powell laughed and at the unexpected sound hunter stopped short on hands and knees
a bitter mocking laughter it was that sickened the listening student
as it ceased the man at the hills edge raised a clenched fist and shook it at the distant lights
and his voice rang out over the silent hilltop like the note of a warning bell man take heed
even while powell voiced that cry of hate and menace hunter moved forward again
and at his first movement his knee pressed down on a small stick that broke with the sound of a pistolshot
instantly powell turned his hand flashing down to his pocket and emerging with a small object in its grasp
as hunter gathered himself for a swift desperate spring that object glowed out a tiny circle of luminous green and the young student sank back to the ground deprived of all power of motion by the paralyzing cone
powell advanced toward him holding the cone outstretched
so you escaped marlowe he said and hunter realized that in the darkness the man had mistaken him for his former prisoner
powell was speaking on think that stop your interference now for good
not that i have any personal animus against you i assure you but i canot allow you to disrupt the plans i have made
as he said this mockingly he carefully placed the cone on a small mound of earth so that its rays still held hunter paralyzed
then he straightened and was reaching for the pistol at his belt when a dark figure sprang from behind dashing him to earth
marlowe the thought beat through hunter s brain as he lay unable to twitch a muscle watching the combat of those two figures that reeled about striking kicking twisting
but what was that what
that thin humming that suddenly made itself heard that grew to a droning to a rumbling reverberating thunder
out of the pit a dark shape was drifting up a black disk that grew grew grew
boom
boom
boom
it grew until it had attained a diameter of thirty feet then hovered above the pit near the struggling men
as he glimpsed it marlowe cried out despairingly and mad laughter flung up
and now was a sudden stir at the edge of the hovering disk a flurry of movement there
hunter darkly glimpsed shapes that crowded about the disks edge that peered at the struggling men
did they mistake the two as a menace to themselves did they fail to recognise powell
for even as the two men reeled in battle toward the disk a blinding shaft of blue light stabbed out from the disks edge and struck the struggling pair
under that ray and in its light hunter saw the faces of the two men change horribly stiffen draw crack and over him swept a breath of utter cold an icy little wind that seemed to freeze his blood
an instant he saw powell and marlowe thus staggering reeling falling then they had collapsed to a shapeless heap on the ground and the blue ray striking out past them had touched the glowing cone on the little mound which instantly exploded with a flash of light releasing hunter from its prisoning power
the blue ray was sweeping in a eirele about the hilltop now and with sudden frantie fear he crawled through the open door of the dark cabin crouching in a comer of it fearfully
suddenly the ray swept up to the cabin and beneath its touch the glass of the windows cracked instantly
an icy puff of air again swept over hunter in his corner as the ray swept through the open door and hung steady for a moment
its blue light illumined a little metal stove opposite the door a stove that covered instantly with a lime of frost and ice at the rays touch
a moment the ray hung thus steadily doubtfully then abruptly vanished as though snapped out
hunter sighed chokingly
the humming sounds began again outside and his fear mastered by curiosity he crept to the cracked window
a mass of tiny black circles was rising from the pit floating up and growing at the same time while the first disk hung to one side watching
the black circles rose high expanded almost instantly to the size of the first were joined by that first disk
for a minute hunter watched the disks circling above swirling about in an eddying mass
then three detached from those above and sank down to the hilltop hovering close above it and sweeping it ever and again with the deadly blue ray that eame and went across the cabin while he watched
the other disks more than a score in number grouped in a compact formation then raced swiftly south
the vanguard of the atomic conquerors loosed at last upon the world of man tt is doubtful if we shall ever know the exact purpose of that first raid on the atomic invaders
that question might be solved if we knew how much information they had received from powell regarding our earth
as it is we look on that first coming as an effort not so much to destroy as to disorganize to terrorize
doubtless it was their plan to break up all chance of organized opposition in england by a series of swift and deadly blows then take over the island at their leisure and make it the base of their future operations
whatever their intentions they passed over all northern england without stopping and the world first became aware of their presence when they struck with terrific force at manchester and liverpool successively
there is no clear coherent account of their coming to manchester
the survivors saw that hour of dread through a haze of terror and it was long before all accounts were pieced together to make a reasonably complete story of the happenings there
one sees through those horrorstricken tales a terror descending without warning out of the darkness on the unsuspecting city beneath
no doubt the streets were crowded and theaters and showwindows ablaze all the life and stir of early evening
then a swift gathering of dark shapes above the deadly blue ray hashing down on the streets searing in icy path of death across the city
it must have been utterly incomprehensible destruction to those below
even now we scarcely understand the nature of that blue ray the cold ray as it is now called
we know that all things in its path acted as if under the influence of extreme unheardof cold absolute ero
it was exactly as if the invaders had concentrated utter cold and burled it forth in a single stabbing ray
strictly speaking of course there is no such thing as positive old only absence of heat
the heory generally accepted now is that in some unexplained manner the ray bad the power of instantly sucking away the heat of anything it touched
certain it is that the ray was a terrible weapon
beneath it flesh and blood froze immediately into black hard lumps metal cracked trees and plants shriveled instantly
it is curious to note that the action of the ray was highly localized that it could slay one man hile another man ten feet away would feel only a sudden breath of intense cold
as it swept steadily along the streets of manchester that night overtaking the fleeing crowds and leaving them in shapeless heaps it must have seemed like the very day of doom to those below
they speak of it as enduring for hours that time that the invaders hung above the city while in reality the disks remained over manchester somewhat less than twenty minutes
how many avere slain in that time it is impossible to guess
the city at least was thrown into a wild intense panic and no doubt that was the purpose of the invaders
that accomplished they gathered together and sped away to the west to liverpool
the story of the massacre at liverpool is almost identical with that at manchester
there too the disks struck down with icy death at the city but one curious feature differentiates the liverpool account
it seems that as the cold ray swept around the city it crossed ever and again the citys harbor and the sea outside
and for many days afterward immense icebergs of unprecedented size ranged the english coast born of that striking of the ocean by the blue ray
at manchester and liverpool and even as far south as birmingham the invaders came down without warning striking unexpectedly spreading death and dread then racing away
but some time before they reached london word of the attacks on the northern cities had been received and men waited ready for battlfe so that it was over london that the atomic people and the forces of man clashed for the first time
it was the assumption of the war office in london that manchester and liverpool had been attacked by the airplanes of some continental power without the formality of a declaration of war
certainly they did not dream of the real nature of the menace that was speeding toward them
presently from all the airstations around the city plane after plane was spiraling up while in a great ring around london the giant searchlights stabbed the night sweeping the sky in search of the invaders
even while the planes ascended and hung in a thin line high above the eity thunder was growling low and ominous and lightning flickering across the sky
it was with this gathering storm that the disks raced down toward the city never glimpsing the line of planes above
for a space of minutes they hung motionless surveying the shining splendid metropolis
the streets below temporarily deserted beneath the coming storm were like brilliant rivers of light connecting the lakes of luminescence that were the squares
one imagines the invaders in the disks staring down at the city in amazement if their reptilian natures possessed the power
as they hung there the beam of one of the questing searchlights caught them and held them and the stabbing rays of the other lights shifted to them at once bathing the disks in a flood of white light
then from high above the airplanes drove down upon them and the battle had begun
one can see that battle clearest perhaps through the eyes of a single individual a certain young brownell who was the pilot of a singleseater combat plane
at the first orders he had taken the air almost joyously with the exciting thought that at last his training was to be tested in actual battle
he thrilled to the thought as with the other planes he swooped down upon the disks
down he went and down diving toward a single disk that hung at some distance from the mass of its fellows
his hands grasped the control of the planes machinegun and even above the roar of the motor he heard the of the gun spraying bullets on the disk
he swept down onto that disk and over it in a great curve passing above it at a height of a few yards
as he flashed over it the lightning flared out blindingly above and as he caught momentary sight of the things on the disk his hands trembled on the controls
he had glimpsed a mass of upturned heads scaled and peaked with fanged and gaping mouths
for the first time he saw the creatures of dread he was fighting
as he drove up above the battle and banked and circled for another swoop his hands were still trembling
from below came the popping of bombs a few of which scored hits on the disks most of which plunged down toward the city below misses
the roar of their detonation seemed feeble beside the crash of the thunder which was now rumbling forth almost continuously
away to the left of the battle two planes collided and dropped swiftly to earth trailing long streamers of red flames blazing comets plunging earthward through the upper darkness
and now their first shock of surprize over the invaders struck back and the blue ray flashed up searching out and finding the planes whose wings shriveled and collapsed beneath its touch
two of the disks had been forced down by lucky hits with bombs but the others were almost unscathed and now the planes were falling ever more rapidly beneath the cold ray
suddenly from high above a single plane rushed down toward the massed disks in a dizzying nosedive
the blue ray stabbed up from a dozen disks to meet it but it plunged on smashed down into one of the disks and plane and disk whirled together down to earth the latter spilling out a mass of grotesque figures that raced it in its fall
brownell shouted hoarsely as he saw
from all around planes were diving down now smashing squarely into the disks and falling with them a deliberate heroic suicide on the part of their pilots
an immense exaltation ran through brownell that vast forceful rapture of heroism that can sweep men up to titanic heights
he circled again then dipped the planes nose sharply and rushed down upon a single disk like a falling plummet at the last m6ment he clung to the guncontrol
rush of wind past him flash of lights a roaring in his ears the disk was nearer rushing swiftly up to him nearer nearer crash then plane and disk were tumbling down to earth together speedingdown to the brilliant streets below crashing down near the docks where something in the wrecked disk exploded with stunning force
above the battle was all but finished
only a few of the planes remained and the blue ray was searching these out one by one
presently the invaders held the air alone nine disks remaining of the twenty or more that had begun the attack
the city below was at their mercy but they did not heed it
circling and forming they massed again together then moved away to the north seemingly daunted by the fierce and unexpected resistance they had met
they had conquered but at a price that disinclined them for further battle at that time
the people in the city below waited tensely but no more aerial wrecks whirled down upon them
and the everquesting searchlights revealed no sign of plane or disk over the city
through all london reigned a deathlike silence that first moment of astounded silence before the hoarse roar of fear and rage that would roll through the city
only the deep rumble of thunder broke the stillness
across the sky the lightning flared again once twice
then down upon the city swept the lashing flooding rain
i is to young story that one must turn again for an account of the invaders movements after that first raid
crouched by the window he saw them returning from the battle nine scarred disks returning where more than a score had gone out
for the first time it struck him that possibly the forces of man might have checked the first rush of the invaders
he wondered intensely as to that
during all of that period of hours while the disks had been fighting and killing and terrorizing england he had not dared to escape from the cabin for the three guardian disks still hung very low above the hilltop and the blue ray constantly swept about that summit marking a path of death
the guardians were takingno chances of anyone tampering with the sandgrain of doing harm to their own world that lay within that grain
and now when the defeated nine returned he saw that his chances of escape were even less
for except for one disk that dropped down into the pit dwindling and vanishing these returned disks took up a position with the watchful three hovering low over the hilltop
now and then one would sweep up into the sky cixcle for a time then return to its position over the summit of hunter wondered intensely what the mission of the disk that returned into the sandgrain had been
a call for aid for reinforcements
the waiting attitude of the others seemed to indicate that
dawn had come and with its gray light he moved silently about the little cabin finding food in plenty and bolting a hasty uncooked meal then returning to his position of observation by the window
all over the world that day was wonder
the news of the battle over london of the death that smote the northern cities had flashed out over all the earth bringing surprize and doubt and fear to cities far away
a wave of terror rolled over the british isles and already the channel was crowded with the shipping that bore away the first great crowds of the impending exodus
the theory of attack by a foreign power had collapsed and as men examined the crushed mangled bodies found in the wreckage of the disks at london they realized that earth was invaded by creatures wholly diffeient from man but superior in power
it was but natural that they should conceive these invaders as arriving from another planet and that was the theory held by all
in every mind was the thought that the invaders had retired only temporarily that they would return to spread terror and death again
the disks had been discovered hovering watchfully over kerachan hill and from all the country about that hill the inhabitants poured forth choking the roads in their frantic haste to escape from the vicinity
by evening of that day less than twentyfour hours after the first coming of the disks it is doubtful if a single living person with the exception of hunter remained within ten miles of the hill
it strikes one as curious that the invaders during all that day made no effort to destroy or kill in that vicinity
they simply hung above the hill hovering and circling restlessly waiting as it seemed to hunter
waiting he thought for the return of the messenger who had gone back down into the atomic world
once only they struck late in the day
a force of field artillery had been ordered down from glasgow with orders to shell the hill that was evidently the base of the invaders
men and guns and horses rattled south along the rough road under the hot afternoon sun
high above them a black speck suddenly appeared in the blue the shape of a watching disk that swept down to investigate
a few ineffectual rifleshots were fired as the disk sank down toward them then there was a bolting of men into the neighboring fields and hedges a plunging of panicmaddened horses as the dark shape loomed above
then the frosty blue cold ray springing down from the disk leaping swiftly along the road in a trail of icy death pursuing and exterminating the running men in the fields
a moment the disk hovered and turned then swept swiftly back up into the blue
no man in that battery returned to glasgow to report its fate and when three planes were ordered south to investigate none returned
thereafter no more such futile attempts were made
that night there was utter darkness in every city in england for strict orders were given and enforced that no spark of light should betray a citys presence to the invaders
but though in all england europe america anxious people waited through the night for news of another attack the disks of the invaders still hovered above kerachan hill waiting waiting
in southern england masses of aircraft collected the combined airpower of england and france await180 ing the invaders return
and through the english roads meeting and passing the seabound masses of refugees rolled the tanks the guns the long brown masses of marchingsoldiers
mankind was gathering itself for the straggle but through all those masses ran an unspoken thought an unvoiced fear
what avail were rifles and bombs against the smiting ray
or airplanes and dirgibles against the swift and mighty disks
on a hilltop miles away from keraehan men lay hidden with powerful telescopes and radiotransmitters ready to flash word of the invaders movements to all the earth
and all the earth waited tensely for that word ondering hoping fearing
the bright morning of that day passed the second since the first night raid of the invaders
and all through that morning no word came from the hidden watchers
two hours of the afternoon had passed when a message finally came short concise
it said only disks are gathering in immense force above kerachan hill and are evidently preparing to move
that message short as it was was sufficient to cause the last stable forms of life in england to break up melt away
those crowds of people who had remained hoping against hope now fought their way madly toward the seacoast to escape to life
over those fleeing hordes ran a shout a threat a warning
they are coming
they called it to one another autos racing through country villages shouted it the mobs on the roads voiced it fearfully soldiers resting by the wayside repeated it thoughtfully looking toward the north
over england over europe over the whole world it ran swiftly terribly they are coming
they arc coming a now the last great hour of destiny was swiftly closing down with that massing of the invaders above the scottish hills
crouched beside the window of the cabin hunter watched them pouring up from the pit from their atomic world masses of tiny disks that grew with inconceivable speed to full size that moved away and made room for the others to rise
up up up gigantic masses of the disks countless hordes of the monsters they held a vast force of invaders before which all human resistance would be vain he knew
after that night of the invaders first attack on earth that night of his imprisoning in the cabin he had watched through a day and another night and now well into this day except for a few hours of sleep that he had snatched
watching waiting fearful of the everpresent guardian disks above like them waiting waiting
and now this flood of the disks this upspringing of all their mighty forces
as he gazed at them now floating up from the pit in dark endless masses it seemed to him that the malignant spirit of powell laughed again beside him
boom
boom
boom
the rumbling thunder of the expanding disks seemed to him like the sound of a mighty bell tolling the end of the reign of man
boom boom boom he glanced up saw the hundreds of disks above spreading out in a long double line in an irresistible formation awaiting the others that were still rising from the pit
but as hunter watched them circling and forming above the sky seemed to darken suddenly the sunlight to be cut off to vanish
and along the line of invaders above ran a quick start a sudden nervous shock
darker and darker grew the sky continued on page vhe for this piece of work you are no longer hangman and jailer said queen elizabeth and there was indignation in her voice rom my earliest memory as a small child i have hated cats
they fill me with an indescribable feeling of dread and horror that amotmts almost to an illness in their presence
snakes i can bear and of all other animals i am fond but eats to me are creatures most loathsome
mrs flynn my landlady has a gray cat with a yellow spot on its head as though the devil had branded his servant with brimstone before sending it into the world
such has always been my fancy of mrs flynn s cat
but then i am queer
my friends certain of them apologize for me as queer
i have some fame as a writer of stories and they forgive me my queerness on that score
my name is govern ariste a queer name
i have queer fancies and i number among my friends those friends who do not apologize for me queer people
such a friend is amir das who does not laugh at my hatred of cats nor think me queer because of it
for everything in the world my friend there is a reason this amir das who is a hindoo philosopher has often told me
tonight we discussed the matter again over our tea
amir das it should be mentioned is a graduate of oxford where he acquired an english fondness for afternoon tea
when he appears at my rooms before oclock of an afternoon and this is the time he most often chooses for his visits it is mrs oflynn herself who steps in and brews the cheering beverage for us after the manner that only one brought up in the ould counthry can
as i have said the hindoo continued for everything in this world or any other world there is a reason
that is the law of all nature
for every cause there is an effect
for every effect there has been a cause place my hand in that fire which flames on your hearth
it burns me and i take my hand away
never will i put my hand in fire again
it has hurt me and i fear it
cause has produced effect
do we desire knowledge
we must ever seek to know the causes of the effects we see
now this fear this horror you have for cats when you were a baby a small child perhaps a cat frightened you
my mother says not but that i cried at sight of one even before i could talk i told him
and she had always loved cats
she had five of the animals as pets at the time of my birth but even as a baby i showed such signs of fright at them she gave them every one away
we never had a cat afterward and my dislike of the creatures continued as i grew older
then my friend your feeling for these animals is the unconscious remembrance of another life
sometime somewhere misfortune came to you in the guise of a cat
we people of the east know these things to be true
but you of the west with your numerous schools and your much education laugh at the thought that the soul may live through many lives coming into different bodies and acting different dramas but learning each time a little bit more of that which it has willed to learn and working all these experiences into one perfect plot in the end
you laugh although daily you see about you proof of the truth of these things which my people have taught and known for ages
a man is introduced to a maiden and with the meeting of their eyes he knows that she is the one among all others for whom he has been seeking
and she too meeting his ardent glance for the soul looks out through the eyes knows that he is the man of her heart
recognition leaps like a flash of electric flame between them
you of the west term it love at first sight but we of the east say love not at first sight but love for each other many times in many lives has been the joy of that man and that maid
and insofar as they have loved truly in the past they seek for and find the beloved again
does not your scripture say love is stronger than the grave
then have i not met the one i loved in the past i told him
many lives must i have loved myself alone for i have always been content to be a bachelor and no woman has ever appeared to me as desirable above all other women
but we were speaking of cats not love my friend
we speak of reincarnation the chapters of life replied the hindoo
and your hatred of cats ariste is doubtless part of a chapter now past a chapter perhaps you are happier for not remembering
after some further talk of the same nature but more deeply philosophical amir das left me to ponder his statements in the cozy firelight of the oldfashioned fireplace
this fireplace together with mrs abilities has kept me for many months a contented lodger in the warmhearted house in spite of the detestable cat that she insists on keeping
the fiendish voice of this cat i now heard wailing from a distant part of the house
i presumed that probably it had been locked into some room as it accompanied mrs oflynn a prowling shadow on one of her busy housewifely rounds
i watched the red fire on the hearth and thought of what my hindoo friend had said
i thought of love and of eats and holding my mind stilled while i looked at the dancing flames i tried to bring out of my memory some reason for my hatred of eats
i must have dozed for i started up from my seat confused and somewhat dazed
as one who recalls the dim memories of a dream i remembered that i was govern ariste a writer of stories who lived in the memory of dreams dims as one wakes and so did the memory of govern ariste slip into the inaccessible places of my consciousness
but what matter
peter byfield poor young student in london town had long been given to dreaming
i laughed at myself somewhat grimly to find that i had been entertaining but one more fantastic fancy
ay peter didst thou not dream so mueh more wouldst thou accomplish i scoffed to myself
having lived for many years alone i had acquired the habit of lonesome people who talk with themselves in lieu of better or worse company
the fire on the hearth was almost dead and i stooped to place upon it another fagot
then i looked at the small pile of unbumed fagots by the hearthside wondering how long they would last to keep some of the chill of london rain and fog out of my attic room
more fagots meant money of which i had but little store
the hearth was of roughly cut stone and the attic room was humbly furnished with eot and chair and in one corner a table on which were strange crucibles and retorts and above it a shelf whereon were books and manuscripts
but however humble my room it contained all the mysteries of life for me save only one
that one i had met some days past in the queens hunting park where unlawfully i sought for herbs and rocks that would help me in my studies of alchemy
i had come upon this arch mystery of all in an open space between the trees dismounted beside her horse
in her hands she nursed a falcon with a broken wing
she was a tiny thing with redgold curls and in one cheek was a dimple that a man might not look upon overlong without a mad desire to kiss it who shoxdd have fled because i broke the law by being in this place at all stood transfixed looking with heart and eyes at the vision before me
then the maiden turned raising her gaze to mine and i saw that her eyes were of a blue like that of the sea on a calm summer afternoon
but more had they than color
they gave the man that looked into them a feeling of rest and harbor such as a voyager might have when after a long and eary journey to many ports he comes at last home
as i looked into her eyes and she into mine i knew not only that this was the most beautiful woman i had ever seen but that she was my true love and that i could never care for any other forgot that although ambitious and the son of a noble father was but a poor student who might scarcely dare to love a high lady such as her appearance proclaimed her to be
true my studies were of alchemy and should i find the philosopher s stone in which men of that day believed and foi which they spent longyears of study and search i would have all power at my command
my father had been a noble of henry couit but had displeased the king and been forced to fine england
an adventurer he had journeyed in many far countries where he had studied strange sciences with stranger teachers among them the moorish teachers of araby in one of these foreign lands i knew knew not where nor of what mother i had been bom
and he had brought back to england with him in his old age along with the small boy that was a marvelous collection of books and manuscripts
some of these he had taught me to read
for others he had given me a clue to the inner meaning they contained
and for all he had inspired in me the thirst to understand a thirst that had continued with me unquenched after his death several years previously
something i knew of the philosophers stone by which base metal such as lead might be transmuted to gold and by which old men had their old age renewed as youth
and for this philosophers stone i became one of the searchers hoping with my experiments and the knowledge contained in my precious books that i might some day find the miracleworking talisman
thus had my room with its crucibles retorts books and potions among which i daily experimented contained all the mysteries of life for me until the day i met in the royal park the lady edith estes attendant to her majesty queen elizabeth
then had peter by field taken back to my attic with the injured falcon whose wing i had promised to try to cure the greatest and sweetest mystery of all a mystery that pulsed in my heart like a song and that brought between my eyes and the books i would fain have studied visions of golden curls a magic dimple and eyes like blue pooli of heaven
the last mystery bid fair to put to rout and take the place of all the other mysteries whose solution i had so long sought
in my study of alchemy i do not boast but say truly i had learned more of physic than many physicians of my time
it thus happened that on the day i awoke from my strange dream of a life in which my name was govern ariste i found the injured falcon apparently recovered
with all the skill that i possessed i had wound strips of cloth to bind the wing to the birds body until the broken bones could grow together again
i had kept the restless falcon quiet by having it hooded all that time
now i removed the hood and the bird flew about my room with wing but slightly stiff
i had made good my promise to the lady estes that i could cure her pet
exultant that i had served my beloved in even so small a thing i caught the bird hooded it again and chained it to my wrist
then i went forth to seek its mistress
she had told me that i could ask for a certain servant at the palace who in turn would call her
this i did and shortly found myself again in that radiant presence
doffing my cap i bowed low in the fashion of a courtier
my tongue false friend had left me
as at that other meeting in the park i could say but a few stiff words the while i told her of how it had been my great pleasure to cure so fine a bird
she had a purse in her hand but my courtly manner must have made her know that i was no hireling to be paid with a gift of money
instead she gave me a more precious gift the memory of her smile as she thanked me with gracious words
and having reflected well on the difference in station between a great court lady and a poor student hastened to excuse myself lest i forget and throwing myself at her feet declare the passion i felt
neither at the time she had found me in the park nor now did she make reference to the fact that it had been unlawful for me to wander in the royal hunting preserves
but any fear i might have had that she would make known her discovery of my presence there had been forgotten from the first glimpse of her
even prison or punishment were well worth enduring for the that had become mine
so i mused as i turned my steps from the palace toward the poor tenement that held my attic room
in such a frame of mind it was that i came upon young tom smythe the jailers son and the cat that he tortured as sport for his companions
it was a gray cat which later i discovered had a sulfurcolored patch upon its head
but at the time i saw only the manner in which young tom had tied the animal stretched out on its back with its four feet drawn by cords to four stakes so that the boy might draw and quarter it even as his father tom the hangman had that day executed a poor wretch sentenced to be drawn and quartered for treason to the crown
around young tom had gathered a crowd of admiring youngsters
tom with a knife who knows where small boys obtain the instruments for their devilments had raised his arm for the first stroke that would slit the cats body lengthwise
meanwhile the animal yowled in an agony that but added to the glee of the spectators
surely the memory of govern ariste was far from the thought of peter byfield for peter byfield on that day did not hate eats
i loved them as i did all other animals and the sight of the tormented creature before me filled me with a great pity and a great rage at the young fiend who had undertaken this cruelty
with two strides i had parted the surprized children and seized the knife from the wouldbe executioner
four strokes i made with it at the binding ropes and the gray cat with a yellow spot upon its head bounded from the earth as only a frightened cat can and hisked up the roof of the nearest house to live eight more lives fate favoring
even then all might have been well had not the rage of my heart demanded vengeance upon the person of the young rascal
the boy was a bully the leader of all the lads of the neighborhood but now i humbled him before the eyes of his frightened playmates
right lustily i laid onto him holding him across my knee with one hand and applying stout strokes with the other until he wailed as loud as the cat had done
nor did i heed nor care that a black hatred was born in the blubbering bullys mind when finally i released him
with short words i told him what measures i would take should i again find him illtreating a cat or any other animal
then wearied and my thoughts once more turning to the vision of the lady edith estes i sought my lodging determined to work with renewed effort in my search for the philosophers stone that meant wealth and fame and perchance the winning of my love
late that night i worked measuring and mixing new potions that might lead me to the elixir of life
as i bent to my task i was startled by a wailing cry from the roof of an adjoining house upon which my attic window looked out
i opened the window and a cat sprang into the room
it was a gray cat with a yellow spot upon its head a most vile and draggledappearing eat and it cried to me with plaintive insistence which bespoke its opinion that a life saved even a cats life as worth little unless that life might have food and shelter
i gave the beast some of the gruel and milk that formed my simple supper
it ate and curled up on the hearth purring and content
such was the manner in which peter byfield came to make a companion and pet of the gray cat the day and age when peter byfield rescued the gray eat men held many superstitions
it was not well even in that england which was then coming to birth as a great nation and which allowed more freedom of thought and action to its inhabitants than any other country for a man to be too markedly different from his neighbors
those who studied alchemy might well be careful that they be not accused in the popular mind as pursuing other and unsanctified studies
young tom smythe whom peter byfield held over his knee and beat on the day the youth tried to draw and quarter the gray cat chanced to fall ill of a colic the week after that episode
young tom had told his father who was the chief hangman of london town of the treatment accorded him by the alchemist
the elder tom although a brutal evil fellow who could and did on occasion beat his son most cruelly yet in this case resented the fact that a stranger had taken upon himself this parental task
he resented furthermore that the stranger had done this for so simple a cause as anger at the innocent boyish sport of executing a stray cat
tom the elder when he heard the story cursed that stranger and swore that he would have revenge upon him
when young tom fell ill after he had feasted uninvited of green apples stolen from a private garden an ugly thought raised itself in the brain of his father
young tom it may be said had told no one of the green apples
only a few days before it had been the hangmans pleasant duty to officiate at the last events in the life of a poor old woman accused by her neighbors of witchcraft and of causing a sickness among some children in her neighboihood
the wretched creature had been tried tortured and confessing under the torture had been condemned to die as a witch
tom senior had carried out the torture which had made the victim admit her guilt and it had fallen to him nothing loth to tie the frantic woman to the stake and pile and light the fagots that destroyed her body and presumably carried her soul back to its master in his flaming pit
now a cunning train of thought built itself up in mind
a man of more or less mystery a student of strange things whom all his neighbors knew to spend long hours in brewing unknown compounds for what devilish purpose no one knew had recently shown anger against the hangmans child
more he had beaten that child and threatened him and the lad had fallen ill shortly afterward
this surely as the working of sorcery and the deed of one who had sold himself to the devil
to verify his suspicions the elder tom who lived not far from the lodging of peter byfield made inquiry among the neighbors of the alchemist nor as he adverse to starting strange rumors about the student
then it was that those who knew the alchemist began to spread queer tales of the man
they recalled that this peter byfield spent much time alone in his attic room to which he seldom if ever invited guests
it was rumored that the room contained strange things crucibles retorts and drugs all the paraphernalia for making a witch s brew
they remembered that the alchemist had never been overneighborly although he had been known to do such deeds of charity as to give bread to the hungry lie had even bestowed money on those in need
doubtless a man who was the servant of satan could easily make bread by black magic or even produce money by his sorcery
it was known that he had magically cured a falcon with a broken wing which he had been seen bringing home one day almost dead and had later taken away with him apparently sound
those whom peter byfield had helped in their need now began to pray god that they had not taken aid from a servant of the devil or having done so innocently that this would not be accounted a sin to them
they began to watch this man of mystery
and then it was that they discovered damning and erowning proof of their suspicions
peter byfield it was learned had as companion a cat a gray cat with a yellow spot upon its head verily the cat that the alchemist had rescued from the hands of young tom smythe
this solved the matter completely and made the evidence conclusive
why else would a man take pains to save a eat from death were that cat not his familiar his demon companion
tom the elder sought the judge a friend of his to whom he told his suspicions and the hearsay evidence he had gathered
of all these things meanwhile was peter byfield happily ignorant
but the young alchemist undertook more diligently than ever the studies that he sought to master spurred on by the vision in his lonesome young heart the vision of the beautiful lady edith estes
a nd so it chanced on a day not more than two weeks after the day on which i rescued the cat that peter byfield unaware of the evil plotted against me by the hangman had my experiments rudely interrupted by the entrance into my attic room of four armed men of the law
without ceremony i found myself arrested and carried to jail accused of one of the most serious charges of the day witchcraft
the gray cat reposing before my hearth in all the purring content of a wellfed animal was taken as proof against me
tom the elder who was among the men that arrested me had cunningly provided a sack for the cat and it had been the triumph of young tom now somewhat recovered from his sickness to capture the animal and throw it into the bag
i found myself in a dark dungeon and in a most perilous position for of all the crimes at that time recognized by law witchcraft was accounted especially heinous and had as its punishment the most terrible forms of death
likewise it was the most difficult charge of all from which a man could vindicate himself a man under suspicion of being a sorcerer might be and was tortured in the most brutal manner to obtain a confession
if he did not confess he laid himself liable to conviction for that verv reason as being protected by his master the devil
the law dealt hardly with persons accused of witchcraft all of which i knew
even the image of the maid with the blue eyes the golden curls and kissinviting dimple faded from my thoughts though still held deep in my heart as the realization of my plight came upon me
my fears were wellfounded
when i refused to acknowledge guilt of the crime of which i was accused the ignorant cruel judge urged on by the brutal hangman ordered me to be tortured until i should confess such guilt
first they pricked me with needles to find if i had on me anywhere the invulnerable spot
this was the spot supposed to be without feeling where had been sealed by my master the devil
when this torture failed my flesh ever quivering at the needles thrust they put me on the rack
however peter byfield used the strength of my will and refused to confess myself guilty of that of which i was innocent
i denied that the sickness of young tom had been the result of any evil work on my part
i admitted that i was a student of alchemy seeking the philosophers stone
but i maintained that i sought this stone not for myself alone but for the good i might do with it to mankind
as proof of my honest intention i pointed out the charitable deeds i had done to those in need
my rescue of the gray cat i explained had been because of my love for dumb creatures
but a judge and accusers who could authorize and witness such torture of a human being as the torture to which i was put could not understand one whose plea was that he had saved an animal from suffering
they gave me respite from the rack and sought other means of making me confess
and then it was that the genius of tom the hangman invented a torture more diabolical than satan himself it would seem could have devised attention had been called to the sack which held the gray cat by continued and frenzied caterwaulings on the part of that animal which the jailers brutal kicks did not still
putting his hand within the sack he sought to bring forth my companion in guilt and misery
the cat had sharp claws and tom had been well scratched before he finally gave up the attempt and retied the creature in the bag
then there had flashed into his mind the fiendish scheme for an excruciating torture on me the cats master peter byfield and the gray cat should be tied into a sack as fellows
so might this sorcerers own familiar spirit of evil be used to bring about the mans ruin
tom told his plan to the judge who immediately saw its possibilities and ordered its execution
thus i found myself stripped and tied from the neck down in a huge sack and with me as companion the gray cat crazed and frantic now ready to claw its erstwhile master as though indeed it were a demon
this sack was then tied by ropes to posts so that it hung hammockfashion while tom the hangman swung it turning me first face down and then on my back as he prodded the cat with a rod to keep it ever movingin its clawing frenzy
horror of horrors beyond the power of words to tell
the agony of that torture
the screaming pain as the sharp claws tore my body already so brutally tortured and racked
the human body can stand much but the human nerves have a limit of endurance
and as peter byfield had a sensitiveness of nerves ahead of my day
otherwise i would not have had the sympathy that had made me stoop to free a tormented cat in the streets
the tearing of that cats claws on my bare body was now the most frightful torture that human say rather satanical ingenuity could have devised
by will almost more than human i fought with myself that i should not confess to a crime i had not committed
then did i beg of my torturers that they put me to death for death even death by the fire and stake appeared to me as a haven of rest and peace
and at last finding that i would not confess they freed me from the sack
the judge was loth to condemn without a confession but since it appeared that this could not be tained lie deliberated weightily and finally gave it as his opinion that there was sufficient criminal evidence for conviction
the very fact that i had not confessed the judge averred was due to the hardening of my heart and will through strength given me in my hour of trial by my unholy master
so upon me he pronounced sentence that i should on the following day at high noon lie burned at the stake as a warning to other witches wizards and sorcerers
with me condemned to share my fate was the gray eat
the judge had noted the yellow spot on the creatures head and with the logie of the day had made it another link in the chain of evidence that led to my undoing
this yellow spot was doubtless a smokespot of brimstone said the judge which had left its mark upon the cat when the creature came from the bottomless pit
fitting indeed that the flames should return it thither
i heard my death sentence as a boon granted in mercy by heaven
then i was taken back to my rude dungeon to suffer a night of pain from my broken and bleeding body and from my heart which said that never again should i stand in the bright glory of a may morning and see her as i had first seen her the fair dear lady of my heart
i was a gray tomorrow that followed that gray day of torture
as noon approached i was led to the place of execution a public square avhile a ribald crowd followed and hooted me adjuring me to call upon my master the devil to save me from death
tom the hangman as to have his final triumph for he it was who chained me to the iron stake
at my feet he tethered by another chain the brimstonespotted cat now somewhat subdued by torment
high about us he piled fagots and then everything being ready approached with his lighted torch while on his surly face was the smile of a fiend
grimly i shut my eyes and prayed to the god of love in whom i had believed until that yesterday of torture that he might give me strength to die as befitted the son of a noble father
surely the hangman had lighted the fagots by now or was he holding baek to prolong my agony
i waited to feel the breath of the flame
almost i thought my body would not shrink from its warm embrace but would welcome its fiery kiss of death as setting free a soul prisoned in a body that had been a dungeon of terrors
and then perchance it were a delusion born of my weakness and pain i heard a voice speak staying my executioner
it was a voice with a clear sweet tone such a voiee as an angel might have but in it was command that would not be denied
stay it commanded
what is this you do and hy is this poor man so condemned the gruff voiee of the hangman answered is a wizard your ladyship
he cast a spell upon my child who would have perished of a strange sickness had we not found this man and put him here where shortly the flames will take him back to his master satan and his vile cat with him
is there a cat asked the voiee
let me see this animal
tis beneath the fagots your ladyship would see it i say
there was a rustle as tom moved the fagots and perceiving that this must be more than delusion i opened my eyes to see what person had dared interfere with the course of the law and whom it was the hangman obeyed
i gazed into the face of an angel indeed
little she was with redgold curls and a dimple in one cheek that a man might not look upon without a mad desire to kiss it
and her eyes in the blue of them like the blue of the sea on a calm summer afternoon there was rest and harbor for a mans soul
but more than that there was such a flame of pity and indignation that i knew what i had almost doubted that a god of love still reigned in a dark age and that there was one human being in the world besides myself who would understand the kindness i had done a cat
to the lady of the curls and eyes of blue tom the langman held out the cat the while telling the story of peter byfield wizard and his familiar who possessed this animal
the lady listened looking at the condemned man but the horror that showed in her face at the recital was at the hangmans story of peter sufferings rather than horror of the sorcerer himself
then a strange thing happened
the girl stretched forth her hand as though she would pet the cat and when the jailer would have remonstrated commanded him haughtily and took the halfdead animal in her hands
as if by magic the tormented beast ceased its struggles and raising its head sought with evident fondness for the stroking caress of her fingers
another voice a deep mellow voice albeit that of a woman spoke
be careful my lady edith it chided or this hangman will accuse you also of witchcraft when you so easily charm servants
do you look your majesty replied the girl
it is the cat that we rescued in the royal park a halfyear ago see here is the brown spot upon its head
remember you not how the dogs had the animal at bay and how it turned and faced them so pluckily
you and the earl of leicester and i came upon them and the earl made quip of the fact that this cat wore upon its head hair of the color of your hair that denotes in its possessor unconquerable spirit as spanish galleons so lately sunk off our coasts bear witness for unconquerable queen do remember the happening replied the second voice
you took the cat and made of it your pet but it has been lost some days now as you say
with effort i turned my eyes for a minute from the fair face that held them so adoringly enthralled
then i saw that the other speaker was a woman of most royal presence
no need to note the color of the hair which virgin queen had made the fashion of court ladies no need to hear the tiny address her as your majesty
i knew that i stood before elizabeth queen of england and that by miracle a chance had opened that might give me my life
mercy in the name of god mercy your majesty
i cried
if this be your cat then do not let them kill me for having saved its life
they accuse me as a dealer in witchcraft but as god is my witness i have done no wrong
i but saved this cat from the hands of the son of this vile hangman
the boy would have killed it most cruelly had i not taken the beast from him
of the lads illness i know nothing and api guiltless
is the boy yet ill asked the queen turning to the hangman
he was most ill your majesty said the man somewhat sullenly though now he seems recovered
but who can say how long he may stay thus sound if he be under the spell of a wizard
this man is not a wizard
nor would he hurt any lad your majesty
on that i would pledge my soul said the lady edith now stepping forward guilty confess their crimes and he has not so done
nay he would not said the hangman
the devil gave him strength to stand even the torture of being in the sack with the cat
then he told them with evil glee of the fiendish torment he had devised
the small ladyinwaiting who had since first my gaze met hers comforted me with her blue eyes of pity shuddered at the recital even more than she had before
she turned so white i thought she would swoon
ah
your majesty she again pleaded as the jailer finished his recital man could not hurt a lad
he it is who healed your pet falcon of its broken wing
do you not recall how i told you of him
give us your story my man commanded the queen
i remember the falcon and chided the lady edith that she did not bring you to my presence for a fitting reward of your skill
so commanded i told her all my story how i had studied alchemy and physic that would teach me to heal a sick bird how i had rescued the cat how the animal had come to me for shelter and how tom the hangmans son having fallen ill of colic during green apple season his father had wrongly accused me of witchcraft and evil practise against the lad
then i told her of the tortures i had endured but that i had not confessed even when they put me in the sack with the cat
the lady edith estes shuddered again and again during the narrative of my tortures but the queen listened quietly
however there was indignation in her voice as she asked at the end of my story what judge condemned you
and how came he to practise on you a torture not in accordance with our laws
it shall go haidly with this judge and with you too man she added addressing the hangman
for this piece of work you are no longer hangman and jailer but must earn your living by other means than such zealous practises of cruelties on gentlemen
you are indeed a gentlemans son she queried me
i replied that i was and told her my fathers history making much of the fact that coming back to england in the beginning of her reign he had ever been a loyal adherent of the crown
as i talked the lady edith estes continued to pet the gray cat now quite calmed
then she turned beseeching eyes upon the queen beseeching eyes that won from her sovereign a smile
so sweet was my little lady that she might even woo favors from members of her own sex
now it seemed that the queen had listened to her pleading and made judgment thereby
serious and grievous wrong has been done to peter byfield said the queen am convinced that he is an innocent man and therefore i pardon him fully and freely
unloose the man she commanded the hangman
faint and weak i had almost fallen when tom sullen albeit abashed released me
a soldier from the queens retinue supported me while her majesty commanded that i be taken to the palace for treatment by her court physician
we shall make you physician to our animals she announced
and perchance if we find your story true and yourself worthy we shall restore you to your fathers rank and title
what think you of that my lady edith
will that be reward sufficient for this wonderful doctor of yours of whom you have talked so much since the day he mended our falcons iving
bracing myself against my faintness i turned to make thanks to the lady edith who had saved my life
and i saw in the blush on her cheek which had followed the queens words a hope that perchance there should be even greater reward for me than the queen had mentioned
i reached forward to raise the small ladys hand to my lips
it lay upon the cat that she had been petting
i touched the animal as i did so and at that touch there rose in me such an abhorrence such a dread and loathing and hatred for this creature through which i had suffered so much that i staggered back in my weakness
i remember falling falling and then oure and don t start so mr ariste i m but come in to clear away the tea things
so spoke the voice of my landlady mrs flynn waking me from a strange dream that govern ariste had had a dream wherein i played a role under the name and being of peter byfield a dream of such vividness that it did not depart as most dreams do but remained with me clear distinct in every detail
is that your cat that is howling so mrs flynn i asked
it is and it may kape on its howling for all of me replied my landlady
it tried to eat up me lovely new singer canary and locking the ungrateful baste up for a lesson to it not to jump on the cages of tindollar birds
i know you donot like the animal mr ariste nor any eats
but its really a good crayture and kills many a mouse
mice are well enough but when it brings about the death of a man i reflected but aloud i merely announced my intention of strolling forth for a walk
i felt that i needed the calming effect of the cold night air
many stories i have written
writing is my trade
but never before had i lived my plot as i had tonight
was it merely a fantastic idea for a story that had come to me i wondered
or had govern ariste once lived in the body of peter byficld
had peter byfield been a real person
it had been a real enough experience those several days in the life of the young alchemist that i had lived through during the halfhour between the going of amir das and the coming of mrs oflynn while govern ariste slept in his chair before the open fire and mrs flynn s gray cat yowled its penance for the attempted massacre of a tindollar canary
what a tale it would make
but i must turn it over in my mind and clear my thoughts
i walked down the hall and stepped outside closing the door on a last despairing ail from the imprisoned cat
the thought eame to me that i might be losing my mind
people sometimes did
perhaps i was having hallucinations or it might be that my friend amir das had hypnotized me and sent me this dream to make me believe his strange theories of reincarnation
such was my thought as i walked i knew not where
suddenly my revery was broken by a womans shrill scream
i paused and looked up a side street whence the cry seemed to come
there was the sound of running steps and a girl flung herself upon me almost into my arms
help me help me she cried
behind her came two men of rough appearance
i am not tall and i suppose i did not look formidable
the men did not stop but continued continued on page martin leahy the story so far ilton rhodes and his friend bill carter go to mount rainier to find out what caused the dreadful murders that are supposed to have been committed by a frightful demon in custody of an angel so they are described by those who saw them
rhodes suddenly disappears when he and carter are among the tamahnowis rocks and carter is startled by a fearful scream that seems to issue from the very heart of the rock scream ceased as suddenly as it had come
i drew my revolver snapped on the electric light and stooping low looked into that spot where a few moments w before milton rhodes had so suddenly and mysteriously disappeared
nothing but the unbroken rock before me
and yet rhodes had vanished
i turned the light full upon the low roof and then i exclaimed aloud the entrance was there i dropped to my hands and knees and moved under the pack not a little impeding my movements
an instant and i was standing upright peering into a high narrow tunnel which some convulsion of nature in some lost age of the earth had rent right through the living rock
nothing was to be seen save the broken walls floor and roof deep eery shadows crawling and gliding as the light moved
the view however was a very restricted one for the gallery which sloped gently upward gave a sudden turn at a distance of only thirty feet or so
what awaited me somewhere beyond that turn
for a few moments i listened intently
not the faintest sound nothing but the loud beating of my heart
what had happened to rhodes
milton
i called softly
oh milton
no answer came
i grasped a projection of rock drew myself up into the tunnel and advanced as rapidly and silently as possible the light and the alpenstock in my left hand the revolver in the right
but it was not very silently what with the creepers
at times they grated harshly it was as if spirit things were mocking me with suppressed demoniacal laughter
yet i could not pause to remove those grating shoes of toothed steel
every second might be precious now
i drew near the turn the revolver thrust forward in readiness for instant action
i reached it and there just beyond a dark figure was standing framed in a blaze of light
it was milton rhodes
he turned his head and i saw a smile move athwart his features
well weve found it bill said be
i was now drawing near to him
that scream i said
who gave that terrible scream
terrible
it didnot sound terrible to me said milton rhodes
fact is bill like to hear it again
what on earth are you talking about
tis so
who was it
or what was it
why the angel he told me
where is she now
gone bill shes gone
when she saw me she fetched up gave that scream then turned and vanished around that next turn
what was she like milton
i wish i could tell you but how can a man describe venus
i know one thing bill if all the daughters of drome are as fair as this one that i saw i know where all the movie queens of the future are coming from
i looked at him and i laughed
wait till you see her bill
complexion like alabaster white as rainier s purest snow
and hair
oh that hair bill like ten billion dollars worth of spun gold
and the demon
i queried didnot see any demon bill
there was silence for a little space
then i said the whole thing is true after all
you mean what grandfather scranton set down in his journal and the rest of it
i nodded never doubted that
at times i told him didnot doubt it
then again it all seemed so wild and weird that i didnot know what on earth to think
i think he said with a wan smile that you know what to think now now when you are standing in this very way to drome whatever drome may be
yes
and yet the thing is so strange
think of it
a world of which men have never dreamed save in the wildest romance
an underground world
subterranean ways subterranean cities men and women there cavernicolous aphrodites said milton rhodes
and all down there in eternal darkness
i exclaimed
why the thing is incredible
no wonder that i sometimes find myself wondering if i am not in a dream said milton rhodes all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream
but come bill he added let this a priori stuff bowl you over
in the first place it isnot ark down there when you get down far enough
in heavens name how do you know that why for one thing if this subterranean world was one of unbroken darkness the angel and the demon would be blind like those fishes in the mammoth cave
but she is no more blind than you or ergo if for no other reason we shall find light down there
of course they have artificial light or donot mean that
if there had not been some other illumination this strange race of whose very existence science has never even dreamed would have ceased to exist long ago if indeed it ever could have begun
but no gleam of sunlight can ever find its way to that world
it never can of course
but there are other sources of light nebulas and comets in the heavens for example and auroras phosphorus and fireflies here on earth
the phenomena of phosphorescence are by no means so rare as might be imagined
why as nichcl showed though any man who uses his eyes can see it himself there is light inherent even in clouds
a hh this and more rhodes explained to me succinctly but clearly
oh well find light bill said he
all the same this subterranean world for which we were bound presented some unpleasant possibilities in addition that is to those concomitant to its being a habitat of demons and heaven only knew what besides
and then there is the air i said
as we descend it will become denser and denser until at last wc shall be able to use these icepicks on it
rhodes who was removing his creepers laughed
we will have to make a vertical descent of three and onehalf miles below the level of the sea a vertical descent of near five miles from this spot where we stand bill before we reach a pressure of even two atmospheres
the density then increases rapidly doesn t it oh yes
three and a half miles more and we are under a pressure of fbur atmospheres or about sixty pounds to the square inch
throe and a half miles farther down or ten and onehalf miles in all below the level of the sea and we have a pressure upon us of eight atmospheres
fourteen miles and it will be sixteen atmospheres
at thirtyfour miles the air will have the density of water at fortyeight miles it will be as dense as mercury and at fifty miles we shall have it as dense as gold
that will do i told him
we can never get down that far
i have no idea how far we can go down bill
you know that we could never stand such pressures as those know that
but as a matter of fact i donot know what the pressures are at those depths
nor does any other man know
what i said a moment ago is of course according to the law but there is something wrong with the law founded upon that of mariotte as any physicist will tell you wrong with it
at any rate the law breaks down as one goes upward and i have no doubt that it will be found to do so as one descends below the level of the sea
if the densities of the atmosphere decrease in a geometrical as the distances from sealevel increase in an arithmetical ratio then at a distance of only one hundred miles up we should have virtually a perfectvacuum
the rarity there would be absolutely inconceivable
for the atmospheric density at that height would be only one billionth of what it is at the earth s surface
and what is the real density there no man knows or can know replied rhodes until he goes up there to see but meteors rendered incandescent by the resistance they encounter show that a state of things exists at that high altitude very different from the one that would be found there if our formulae were correct and our theories were valid
and so i have no doubt we shall find it down in drome
formulae are very well in their place he went on but we should never forget bill that they are often budded on mere assumption and that a theory is only a theory until experiment or experience has shown us that it is a fact
and that reminds me do you know what percival lowell says about formulae
i said i didnot
formulae says the great astronomer are the anesthetics of thought
i commend that very highly milton added to our fiction editors and our writers of short stories
but but me no buts bill said milton
and hat do your scientists know about the interior of this old earth we inhabit anyway forsooth but very little billy me lad
why they donot even know what a volcano is
one canot make a journey into the interior of the earth on a scratchpad and a leadpencil or if he does we may be pardoned if we do not give implicit credence to all that he chooses to tell us when he comes back
for instance one of these armchair columbuses he made the journey in a machine called by dx and came out in china says that he found the interior in a state of igneous fluidity
and another why he tells us that the hole earth is as rigid as steel that it is solid to the very core
it seems said to be a case of great contest follows and much learned dust involves the combatants each claiming truth and truth disclaiming both
the truth in this case is not yet known replied rhodes though i trust that you and i bill are fated to learn it
he smiled a queer wan smile
whether we are fated also to reveal it to the world our world well quien sabe said milton rhodes
then i remarked my fingers busy removing my icecreepers what we read about the state of things in the interior of the earth the temperature the pressure the density then all that is pure theory of course
how could it be anything else
all theory save that is the mean density of the earth
and that mean density gives us something to think about for it is just a little more than twice that of the surface materials
with all this enormous pressure that we hear so much about and the resultant increase of density with depth the weight of the earth certainly ought to be more than only five and onehalf times that of a globe of equal size composed of nothing but water
kind of queer all right was my comment
it is queer all right as the old lady said when she kissed the cow
however as old dante has it son our time asks thriftier using
as the last word left his lips i straightened up the toothed shoes in my hand and as i did so i started and cried hear that rhodes made no answer
for some moments we stood there in breathless expectation but that low mysterious sound did not come again
what was that
i said wish i knew
it was faint and well rather strange
it seemed to me i told him to be hollow like the sound of some great door suddenly closing
my companion looked at me rather quickly
think so bill he said thought twas the sound of something falling
there was a pause during which pause we stood listening and waiting but the gallery remained as silent as though it had never known the tread of any living thing
well bill said milton rhodes suddenly we shall never learn what drome means if we stay in this spot
as for the creepers i am going to leave mine here
milton then wrote a short note which recorded little more than our names the date of our great discovery and that we were going farther
this carefully folded he placed beside the creepers and put a rockfragment upon it
i wondered as i watched him whose would be the eyes that would discover it
some inhabitant of this underground world of course and to such a one the record would be so much greek
twas utterly unlikely that anyone from that world which we were leaving would ever see that record
i wondered if we should ever see this spot again
and now bill said milton down we go
and the next moment we were going had begun our descent into this most mysterious and dreadful place
scranton came with his weird story of old he i was i confess not a little puzzled by his and reference to the extraordinary scientific possibilities that it presented
at first i could not imagine what on earth they meant
but i saw all those possibilities very clearly now and a thousand more i imagined
i knew a wild joy exultation and yet at the same time the wonder and the mystery of it all made me humble and sober of spirit
i admit too that a fear a fear for which i can find no adequate name had laid its palsied and cold fingers upon me
in a few moments we reached that spot where the angel had vanished
there we paused in curiosity looking about but nothing was to be seen
the gallery which from this point swung sharply to the right and went down at a rather steep angle was as silent as some interstellar void
bill smiled milton rhodes he is idle who might be better employed
and he started on or rather down
a hundred feet however we were now under the glacier and he halted turned his light full upon the lefthand wall pointed and said there you are
bill the writing on the wall
i pressed to his side and stood staring
the rock there was as smooth almost as a blackboard and upon it traced in white chalk were three inscriptions with what we took to be names appended to them
that on the right was clearly a very recent one had been placed there doubtless at the most but a few days since by that cavemieolous venus that milton rhodes had seen for so fleeting a moment
it was opinion that the characters were alphabetical ones though at first i was at a loss to understand how they could be anything to him but an utter mystery
the letters were formed by straight lines only
the simplest character was like a plain capital with the vertical line somewhat elongated
and it was made to perform the office of another letter by the simple expedient of standing it upon its head
the number of crosslines increased up to six three at the top and three at the bottom and in one or two characters there were two vertical lines placed close together
evidently observed milton rhodes this alphabet was constructed on strictly scientific principles
for a space we stood there looking wondering what was recorded in that writing so strange and yet after all so very and beautifully simple
then milton proceeded to place another record there and as he wrote he hummed when i see a persons name scratched upon a glass i know he owns a diamond and his father owns an ass
the inscription finished we resumed our descent
the way soon became steep and very difficult
that aphrodite of yours i observed as we made our way down a particularly rugged place must have the agility of a mountaingoat
your rhetoric bill is horrible
wait till you see her youll never be guilty of thinking of a goat when she has your thoughts
by the way what kind of a light did the lady have
light know
i was so interested in the angel herself that i never once thought of the light she carried
i don t know that she needs a light anyway
what on earth are you talking about why i fancy bill that her very presence would make even gloomy realm bright and beautiful as the gardens of the hesperides
oh gosh was my comment
wait till you see her bill probably see her demon first
hello exclaimed milton
what now
look at that said he pointing think we have the explanation of that mysterious sound which you thought was like that of a great door suddenly closing in her descent she dislodged a rockfragment and that sound we heard must have been produced by the mass as it went plunging down
tis very likely but great heaven he exclaimed
what is it now wonder bill if she lost her footing here and went plunging down too
i had not thought of that
and the possibility that that lovely and mysterious being lay somewhere down there crushed and bleeding perhaps lifeless made me feel very sad
we sent the rays of our powerful lights down into the silent depths of the tunnel but nothing was visible there save the dark rock and those fearful shadows fearful what with the secrets that might be hidden there
the answer wonot come to us bill said milton
no i returned as we started down we must go get it
the gallery at this place had an average width of i suppose ten feet and the height would average perhaps fifteen
the reader must not picture the walls the roof and the floor as smooth however
the rock was much broken in some spots very jagged
the gallery pitched at an angle of nearly fortyfive degrees which will give some idea of the difficulties encountered in the descent
at length we reached what may be called the bottom here the tunnel gave another turn and the pitch became a gentle slope
and there we found it the rockfragment weighing perhaps two hundred pounds that the angel had dislodged in her descent which doubtless had been a hurried a wild one
thank heaven i exclaimed she didnot come down with it
amen said milton
then a sudden thought struck me a thought so unworthy that i did not voice it aloud
but to myself i said it is passible that we may find ourselves before we get out of this wishing that she had
if a human being one of the very best of human beings even were to voice his uttermost his inmost thoughts what a shameful terrible monster they would call him or her and the demon
where was her demon
i could give no adequate description of those hours that succeeded
steadily we continued the descent now gentle now steep rugged and difficiilt
sometimes the way became very narrow indeed at one point we had to squeeze our way through so closely clid the walls approach each other then again it would open out and we would find ourselves in a veritable chamber
and in one of these a lofty place the vaulted roof a hundred feet or more above our heads we made a strange discovery a skeleton quasihuman and with wings
are we i cried entering inferno itself
a faint smile touched the face of rhodes you he asked know what this is
it must be the bones of a demon
precisely
grandfather scranton youll remember wounded that monster up there by the tamahnowis rocks
undoubtedly the bullet reached a vital spot and these are the creature s bones
but i objected these are human bones a human skeleton with wings
according to scranton there was nothing at all human about the appearance of that thing which he called a demon
i admit said rhodes that this skeleton at the first glance has an appearance remarkably human if that is one can forget the wings
the skull i believe more than anything else contributes to that effect and yet at a second glance even that loses its human semblance
for look at those terrible teeth
whoever saw a human being with teeth like thase
and look at the large scapula and the small hips and the dwarfish though strong nether limbs
batlikc bill strikingly so
and those feet they are talons bill
and see that medial ridge on the sternum for the attachment of the great pectoral muscles batman then
i queried should say a batape
or an apebat
whichever you prefer smiled milton
well i added at any rate we have a fair idea now of what a demon is like
little wonder forsooth that old sklokoyum had declared the thing was a demon from the white mans inferno
and this creature so dreadful well the angel had it for a companion
when rhodes saw her she was of course without that terrible attendant undoubtedly the next time though how long would it be she would not be alone
oh well i consoled myself we have our revolvers
a ccording to the aneroid this great chamber is about four thousand feet above the level of the sea in other words we had already made a vertical descent of some four thousand feet
we were now about as high above the sea as the snout of the nisqually
but what was our direction from the tamahnowis rocks
so sinuous had been this strange subterranean gallery my orientation had been knocked into a cocked hat
it was belief however that we had been moving in a northerly direction that we were still under the peak itself probably under the great emmons glacier
i confess that i would not have cared to place a wager on the subject
goodness only knew where we were but of one thing there could be no doubt we were there why i asked we bring a eomnass think returned milton slipping loose his pack and lowering it to the floor that as it was we had a case of another straw and the earners backs busted take a rest it twenty minutes after and a snack
and another thing we wouldnot know whether to trust the compass or not
why so
local attraction bill
many instances of this could be given
one will suffice
lieutenant underwood of the wilkes exploring expedition found a deviation of thirteen and a quarter points on the summit of the cobu rock in the feejees one hundred and fortvnine degrees
the island of nairai was directlv north and yet according to the compass it bore one quarter south whilst placed at the foot of the rock that very same compass said nairai bore north so you see that that faithful friend to man and especially to the mariner has in its friendships some qualities that are remarkably human
still rhodes added wish that we had brought one along
also we should have brought a manometer for the aneroid will be worthless after we have descended below sealevel
oh well the boiling point of water will give us the atmospheric pressure under a pressure of two atmospheres water boils at fahrenheit under a pressure of three atmospheres at four atmospheres five six seven eight and so on
on the summit of rainier it boils at about wish that we were headed for the summit said eight atmospheres
when we reach that pressure if we ever do well be ten and a half miles below the level of the sea wonot we
rhodes nodded
according to the law
but as i remarked there is something wrong with the law
tis my belief that we shall be able to descend much deeper than ten and onehalf miles that is that the atmospheric pressure will permit us to do so
that qualification i told him is very apropos for there is no telling what the inhabitants of this underground world will permit us to do or will do to us batapes or apebats humans or both
that of course is very true bill
and said we wonot need a manometer or we wonot need to ascertain the boiling point of water to know that the pressure is increasing
our eardrums will make us painfully aware of that fact
when that comes swaller billy swaller and the pain will be no more
swallow
swallow milton nodded
great barmecide swallow what swallow the pain bill
for look you
deglutition opens the eustachian tube
some of the dense air enters the drum and counteracts the pressure on the outside of the membrane
you keep on swallowing
the air in the drum becomes as dense as that outside there is no pressure on the membrane now or rather the pressures are in perfect equilibrium and presto and abracadabra the pain is gone
who would have thought it gink said rhodes going into compressed air had better think it
he may have his eardrums burst in if he doesn t
but why does the eustachian tube open only when we swallow to shut from the ear the sounds produced in the throat and the mouth
if the tube were always open our heads would be so many bedlams
wonderful nature
i exclaimed
oh she does fairly well admitted milton rhodes
and i suppose i said that the pain in the ears experienced by those who ascend high mountains is to be explained in the same way only vice versa
they too ought to swallow
of course
at lofty heights the dense air in the drum presses the membrane outward
swallowing permits the dense air to escape
one swallows until the pressure on the inside equals that of the rarefied outside air and hocuspocus and presto the pain has evaporated hope i said that all our difficulties will be as easily resolved
hey cried milton the matter now
stop swallowing that water got food sufficient for a week but we havenot got water to last a week or anything like it
keep up that guzzling and your canteen will be empty before sunset
sunset
sweet pluto
sunrise sunset or high noon its all the same here in erebus say that its very different diyly remaiked milton rhodes if you find the fingers of thirst at your throat
surely there is water in this place somewhere
most certainly there is
but we donot know how far we are from that somewhere
and until we get to it our policy bill must be one of watchful conservation
a silence ensued
i sank into profound and gloomy meditation
four thousand feet down
a mile deeper and where should we be
the prospect certainly was from any point of view dark and mysterious enough to satisfy the wildest dreams of a poe or a dor6
to imagine a inferno however is one thing and to find yourself in it is quite another
tis true we were not in it yet but we were on our way
i hasten to say though that i had no thoughts of turning back
no such thought even the slightest was entertained for one single moment
i did not blink that was all
i believed our enterprize was a very dangerous one i believed it was very probable that we should never return to the light of the sun
such thoughts are not pleasant are indeed horrible
and yet in the very horror of them i found a strange fascination
yes we might leave our bones in this underground world in this very gallery even
even so we should have our own exceeding great reward
for ours would be the guerdon of dying in a stranger a more wonderful quest than any science or discovery ever had known
a strange reward and perhaps you wonder what such a reward can mean to a dying or a dead man
all i have to say is that if you do you know naught of that flaming spirit which moves the scientist and the discoverer that such as you should never indeed can never seek the dread secrets of nature or journey to her hidden places rested there for exactly one hour
the temperature by the way was fahrenheit
when we resumed the descent i was using the phosphorus lamp instead of the electric one
it was not likely that even our electric lights would fail us still there was no guessing what might happen and it might be well i thought to adopt a policy of lightconservation also
as for the phosphorus lamps these would furnish light for six months
in this they were simply wonderful but there was one serious drawback the light emitted was a feeble one
the manufacture of this lamp at one time used i believe in paris and probably elsewhere in the magazines containing explosives is simplicity itself
into a glass phial is put a small piece of phosphorus
the phial is filled twothirds full of olive oil heated to the boiling point
the thing is hermetically corked and there you are
when you wish to use your wonderful little pharos you simply allow air to enter
the space above the oil becomes luminous then
you replace the cork and the phial remains sealed until there is occasion to restore the waning light which you do of course by allowing more air to enter
as has been said such a phial will furnish light for a halfyear
these phials of ours were set each in a metal frame and protected by a guard in such fashion that it would take a heavy blow to break the glass
when not in use the were kept in strong metal cylinders
of course the electric light could be turned on at any instant
there were places where the gallery pitched in a way to make the head swim many spots in which we had to exercise every caution a false step might have spelled irrevocable disaster
i wondered how the angel had passed down those difficult places and many pictures of that mysterious creature as i wondered came and went
well she had passed down and that without mishap
where was she now
indeed where were we ourselves
steadily we toiled our downward way
for a long distance the gallery ran with but slight deviation either to the right or to the left though the descent was much broken i mean now was steep and now gentle now at some angle intermediate
rhodes thought that we were now moving in an easterly direction it might have been north east south or west for all i knew
not a trickle of water had we seen not even a single drop which i confess caused some unpleasant thoughts to flicker through my mind
at clock we were two thousand feet above sealevel at half past about half a thousand
and we then decided to call it a day
nor was i at all sorry to do so even though we might be near some strange even great discovery for i was very tired and sore from the top of my head to the end of my toes
i was in fair trim and so was rhodes but it would take us some time to get used to such work as this
a very gentle current of air so slight that it required experiment to detect it was passing down the gallery
the temperature here was fahrenheit
we had stepped before a cavity in the wall and in that little chamber we passed the night one holding watch whilst the other slept
my dreams were dreadful but otherwise the night was as peaceful as any that ever passed over eden
neither rhodes nor during that strange eery vigil there in the heart of the living rock heard even the faintest most fleeting sound
as the watcher sat there waiting and listening whilst the minutes slowly passed he found himself at any rate i know that i did almost wishing that some pulsation would come so heavy and awful was the stillness of the place
but a sound we were to hear
we had been journeying for about an hour and a half and had just passed below sealevel
in that place rhodes had left the aneroid
of a sudden milton who was leading the way halted with a low sharp interjection for silence
when my look struck him he was standing in an attitude of the most riveted attention
there he exclaimed
did you hear that bill
the air had pulsed to the faintest sound now all was still again
what was it
i asked my voice a whisper know bill
there
again that gentle pulsation touched the ear and again it was gone
and a strange thing was that for the life of me i could not have told whether it came from below or from behind ms there it is again said rhodes
i flashed on my electric light to the full power whisper
i exclaimed
and great heaven milton
what now bill he asked quickly something behind ns
he started
he turned his light up the tunnel and for some moments we stood peering intently
not a moving thing was to be seen there however only the moving shadows
again said milton rhodes
but it isnot a whisper bill
and it didnot come from up there
the thing i told him could be hiding in shadow not up there it is ahead
wherever it is what on earth can it be what does it mean
that we shall learn resumed our descent every sense you may be sure on the qui vive
the tunnel here inclined rather steeply a little space however and the dip was a gentle one
the sounds soon became ono steady unbroken whisper then a dull melancholy murmur
abruptly rhodes stopped turned to me and he laughed
know now what it is bill
this was not a moment i thought for laughter or anything like it
sounds like the growling of beasts i said peering intently down the passage wonder if the angel there are two kinds of angel you know has turned loose a whole pack or flock of those demons
to my surprize and astonishment rhodes burst into outright laughter
well said i rather testily
why all the cachinnation
forgive me bill
but it isnot a pack of demons or a flock
how on earth do you know what it is water
water
yes
water from missouri better see that your revolver is handy
who ever heard water make a shivery sound like that
you see though i think that you ll hear first
ere long there could be no doubt about it milton was right it was the sound of falling water
must be at quite a distance i said sounds carry a long way in tubes and that is what this tvrnnel is
steadily we made our way along and down and just as steadily the sound increased in volume
the gallery made several sharp turns and then of a sudden the sound rose from a loud growl to a roar and an exclamation burst from us
it were impossible to convey to the reader the eery effect of that sudden strange transition
one moment we were in the gallery the next we had issued from it and stood in a most tremendous cavern or rather on a ledge or shelf high up on one of the walls of that cavern
the opposite side was but dimly visible
the roof swept across a hundred feet or more above our heads
and the bottom
i gazed at the edge of the rock shelf on which stood out and down into that yawning abyss and i felt a shudder run through me and on through my heart
the roar of the falling waters came from our right
we turned the rays of our lights in that direction but nothing was visible there save the dark limestone rock and cimmerian blackness
we then moved to the edge and turned our lights down into those awful depths to depths perhaps never before touched by ray of light since time began
far down the beams went plunging and farther still but we could not see the bottom
bottom there was however for the water was tumbling and growling down there
i was glad to draw back from the edge and i leaned against the rock wall and gazed upon the dark scene in wonder amazement and awe
rhodes joined me
well what do you think of it bill
milton this is awful
it is
i have never seen a sight more strange and terrible
and the angel
i queried
what about her bill
how on earth did she make her way through this awful place
why along this ledge on which we are standing
there is no other way
i glanced along that shelf and i felt very sad got a better head i told him than i have
why didnot we bring along an airplane
i wonder if the way lies down or up toward the fall
we bent over and examined the rock
down i observed
down milton nodded
whilst i stood there pondering this and wondering what was down there in the blackness of that frightful chasm rhodes moved off to the right and examined the ledge there
and up too he announced
somebody or something or both has gone up toward the fall
great heaven if we get caught between them the program is becoming interesting rhodes admitted
for a time we stood in silence then milton said suggest that we go up and take a looksee
i nodded
so far as i could perceive one way was just as good i mean just as bad as the other
that shelf was as a whole not an easy thing to negotiate and some spots made my head swim and made me wish mightily that i was somewhere else
undoubtedly some thousands of years in the dim and mysterious past the stream once flowed at this level at any rate that is the only theory that in my opinion will explain that ledge and something we were soon to discover
not that i ever spent much time in worrying about theories and hypotheses the facts themselves gave me enough to think about enough and to spare
at times the shelf would be twenty or thirty feet in width or even more and then the going was easy enough but at other times the space would contract to a couple of yards and then it was another story
once or twice milton rhodes himself an experienced and fearless climber was glad i believe that the way was no narrower
as for what those moments meant to me well i never posed as a mountaineer or a steeplejack
for fifteen minutes or so i believe we toiled along that terrible place and then of a sudden came to the end
nothing before us but the bare precipitous rocky wall and the black profundity of the chasm and up above a ghostly thing crawling crawling down ever down and filling the place with thunder the fall itself
where did the water come from
and a question more interesting where did it go
we must go back said milton rhodes
the road to drome does not lie here
scarcely had we turned when i started and then i cried out sharply
look
i said pointing with my alpenstock down the cavern
look at that far down the cave a light was gleaming where a moment before no light had been
and on the instant another shone beside it
a second or two however and they had vanished
moving was rhodes explanation
no
i told him
and look
again
there they were gleaming at us for all the world like the dim and baleful eyes of some waiting monster ew some moments those yellow eyes gleamed at us then vanished
the lids of that waiting monster so to speak had elosed over them
i had watched them very closely and i was sure that there had been no movement of the eyes themselves
milton however was just as sure that they had moved
to the right or to the left
i queried
neither
down said rhodes
then it must have been straight down
it was behind a rock mass or something
we waited watching closely but those yellow eyes did not gleam again through that stygian gloom
must have been at quite a distance i remarked at last
it seems so bill and that means that this cavern is very straight for a mile or more or that it is one of enormous size
it may be both
it may be
and it may be that those lights were not so far away as they appeared to be
one may easily be deceived in such matters
we donot know what it means i said but we know this were spotted
oh were seen all right bill
our every movement will be watched
some minutes passed during which we stood peering down the cavern and waiting but no light gleamed forth again
then we started back better keep a sharp lookout i said suddenly
remember a demon doesnot have to come along the ledge have not forgotten that bill but we are armed
as i believe was made sufficiently obvious the crossing of those places where the ledge narrowed to the width of but a couple of yards had been no pleasant matter but during the return the thing assumed an aspect truly sinister
that we were being watched both of us regarded as certain
that we might at any moment find a demon or a dozen demons driving at us well that was a possibility which never left our thoughts for one single second
and in those narrow places where the ledge contracted to a mere ribbon of rock it was all one wanted to do to hug the wall and make sure of his footing
a frightful place truly in which to meet even with a revolver the attack of even one of those winged monsters and we might find ourselves attacked by a dozen
it can easily be imagined then the relief which i felt when we had passed the last narrow spot though forsooth we might be going toward something far more terrible than any we had left behind us
but the angel had gone down and where a woman could go there i told myself in masculine pride could we also
that is i subjoined supposing we do not meet apebats or something more terrible
at length we stood once more at the mouth of the gallery
and scarcely had we stopped there when an unpleasant thing flashed into my thoughts which as it was resembled anything but the rainbow
great heaven
i cried peering into the tunnel which at the distance of only thirty feet or so gave a sudden turn to the right
something could be in there very close to us and yet unseen what is it bill
could those lights that we saw have been here
are they waiting in there to dog our steps or to do something worse
rhodes peering into the gallery with a curious halfvacuous expression on his face made no reply
well i queried what do you think of it
we could not tell where those lights were how far away anything donot think that they were here milton rhodes returned think they were much farther down and on the other side on the other side
how on earth could anyone cross that chasm we donot know what it is like down there
and of course i donot know that the lights were on the other side
but i believe that they were
a silence ensued which at length i broke what is the next thing on the program make our way down the ledge
that is the only way we can go
but first we ll try a little finesse
he took a position in the mouth of the tunnel one that permitted him to look down the cavern
he signed to me to follow suit and when i stood at his side he said off go the lights off they went and the terrible blackness was upon us
so terrible was it and so strange and fearful that place in which we stood i actually found myself wondering if it would not all prove a dream
why i asked at last did we do this
to see if the lights will show again
they may think that we have lost heart and started back
i saw it all now instead of our advancing to those mysterious beings somewhere down the cavern he would bring them to us
but they did not come
they did not show even the faintest light
we waited there for many minutes but nothing whatever was seen
hum said rhodes at last snapping on his light wary folk bill these hypogeans
and so i replied have to go to them
that s what we shall have to do
walk maybe right into a trap
it is possible rhodes admitted
but it is possible too that the trap may not prove so terrible possible indeed that there is no trap at all
i tell you i certainly would like to see that angel again
then lets go see her what well do
and so we started
a strange indefinable dread had its grip upon me and yet i was anxious to go to put the thing to an issue
in all probability we should not have far to travel
nor in fact did we
the way was much like the one that we had traversed in the opposite direction
one or two spots were even more dangerous than any we had found up there
and over these dangerous terrible places where a false step or a slip of the foot on the smooth rock would have meant a most horrible death along this airy dizzy stygian way the angel had passed
well she was a brave angel at any rate
we were descending all the while sometimes at an angle that i was glad was no steeper
this does not mean however that our distance from the bottom of that terrible chasm on our right was decreasing
the sounds that came up from the black depths of it told plainly that the descent of tlie stream was as pronounced as that of the ledge we were following and perhaps more so
and heres something that i donot understand was my remark as we stopped in a particularly broken spot to say nothing of our being below sealevel here this stream has been pouring down for untold centuries for how many thousands of years no man can even guess and yet the place isnot full
where does all the water go think was answer of all the rivers that for how many millions of years no man can tell have been running into the sea and yet the sea is not overflowing
i don t see the application of that to this underground world donot see how all the water there must be more streams than this can possibly return as vapor to the region above admit rhodes said that the problem is a formidable one and that with our present paucity of data we can not hope to solve it
still i think my suggestion sound
but where are the openings to permit the escape of so enonnous for enormous it must be an amount of water vapor
there may be countless vents fissures bill ways of egress that man will never know
whatever the explanation there can be no doubt that the ater is going down and that this subterranean world is not full
but where does it go
down to some sunless sea perhaps though if that hypothesis of yours is a sound one bathed in light light never seen in that world we have left on land or sea
rhodes was a silent for a moment leaning on his alpenstock
then it is strange truly the descent of the waters
and yet it would not i believe have been to you so very strange a thing had you known that the sea itself flows into the earth
the sea itself rhodes nodded
surely milton why the thing is jules vemesque
on the contrary the fact has long been known
at argostoli in the island of cephalonia the sea flows right into the limestone rock
shades of lemuel gulliver but this old ball that men call the earth is certainly a strange old sphere how strange said milton rhodes no scientist has ever dreamed though your scientist has thought of things far stranger than the cases are certainly not numerous where marine currents are known to pour continuously into cavities beneath the surface of th earth but there is at least one wellauthenticated instance of this sort that of the mill streams at argostoli in the island of cephalonia
it had been lorn observed that the sea water flowed into several rifts and cavities in the limestone rocks of the coast but the phenomenon has excited litte attention until very recently
in three of the entrances were closed and a regular channel sixteen feet long and thre with a fall of three feet was cut into the mouth of a larger cavity
the sea water flowed into this canal and could be followed eighteen or twenty feet beyond its inner terminus when it disappeared in holes and clefts in the rock
george marsh man and nature any ever conceived by your wildest romancer who after all bill is a pretty tame homo have an idea i said glancing down the cavern that we are going to find the homos here in this place anything but tame
milton laughed and without any other answer turned and resumed the descent
for one thing i was profoundly thankful the wall ran along without any pronounced cavities or projections in it so that we had little to appiehend from a sudden attack on this our giddy way except or course by a demon
had the wall been a broken one any instant might have found us face to face with a band of hypogeans as rhodes called the denizens of this subterranean place
but how long would the wall remain like that
and after all did it really greatly matter
meeting sooner or later was inevitable
tis true i could not conceive of a worse place than this supposing the meeting to be in any measure an unfriendly one
and from what had happened up there at the tamahnowis rocks i could not suppose that it would be anything else
this however was to prove simply another instance of how inadequate the imagination when confronted with the reality is sometimes found to be for even now we ere drawing near a place more terrible even than this and that was the place where we met it required but little imagination though to make us aware and painfully so of the extreme probability regarded by ourselves as a certitude that eyes were watching our every movement
but where were those eyes and what were the watchers
to what fearful thingor could it be wonderful were we drawing near at every single moment now
some minutes passed perhaps fifteen perhaps more i can not say how long it was
of a sudden however rhodes who was still leading the way stopped
no sound had escaped him and he stood there like a statue peering intently straight ahead
look there he said in a low voice pointing with his alpenstock and tell me what you see
i was already looking and already i had seen it
but what on earth was that thing which i saw
i remained silent gazing with straining eyesand wondering if i really saw what i thought that i did
what asked rhodes do you make of it
the thing is so faint
tis impossible and yet if it were not so i would say that it is an arch part of a bridge
just what i thought
the thing is so strange though that i didnot know whether to believe my eyes or not
and so dim i observed that it may be nothing of the kind
a bridge
now who on earth would build a bridge across this frightful chasm
and why
quien sake bill said milton rhodes
the next moment we were moving toward it
look ejaculated rhodes suddenly
it goes clear aeross
yes i said stopping and gazing at that strange dim mass it goes clear across
and thats the place over there on the other side thats where they are waiting for us shouldnot be a bit surprized said milton a strange bridge that truly
it looks like a ruin a ruin that has not fallen
it was a ruin indeed
so ruinous was it that i wondered how the mass could possibly remain intact
a short advance however and the mystery was solved
the hand of man had not builded that great arch across this dreadful chasm nature had fashioned it there in that region of everlasting darkness
it has rhodes said a remarkable semblance to the celebrated natural bridge in virginia
a short space and we stood upon it gazing across
its width here was about sixty feet
the surface was comparatively speaking a smooth one and it had a rather pronounced slope upward a circumstance by no means conducive to security of footing
and a feature that i noticed with some unpleasant misgivings was the diminution of width at the farther end
just how wide it was there wc could not tell what with the uncertain light that struggled to the spot but we saw enough to know that that way which we should have to cross was a very narrow one indeed and on either side the black chasm yawning to receive us
and just beyond dim and ghostly as though seen in a dream stupendous columns rose up and were involved in the darkness of the lofty cavern
what on earth arc those
i queried
it reminds one of a grecian temple
limestone pillars no doubt returned milton
and its there i exclaimed my voice however low and guarded that they are waiting for us that is where those lights were
i suppose so wait until we get in that cursed narrow place and then and then
well i told him we had better say our prayers before we start across
rhodes laughed
i thought though that there was a touch of the sardonic in his laugh
little wonder forsooth if twas so for the thing was fraught ith terrible possibilities
what i asked are we to do
cross over if we are permitted to do so
if we should be permitted to do so i gazed into the black profundity of the chasm and felt very sad
holy gorgons i said we got into a fine pickle though tell you what well do bill you remain here like horatius at the bridge while i explore along the ledge donot like it i told him
united we stand well you know the rest of it
he was silent for some moments
then think that we can risk it
bill
very well i acquiesced shrugging my shoulders
but i tell you that i don t like it at all
the next moment however he had turned and as moving down the ledge
i stepped back to the wall upon which two inscriptions were traced and waited the result with such composure as i could summon
at last rhodes moved behind a projection in the wall
a moment and the glow of his light had vanished ne was gone and i was alone in that terrible place
the blackness seemed to increase the shadows to thicken about me and grow denser
but one sound broke the awful silence which sound seemed to have a quality tangible crushing the growl of the water in the abysmal depths of the chasm
and even that sound as i stood there listening watching waiting seemed to change it seemed to sink to a murmur then a whisper as though evil spirits were hushing it to lull my suspicions and even my very senses
what was that
i started and something shot through my very heart chilling and sharp as the needle point of an icicle
surely i had seen it
yes there it was again dim but unmistakable there by one of the great columns a single point of light an eye staring at me with a greenish fire
yes there it was
then of a sudden it was gone
for a time i stood peering and waiting the blood throbbing in my ears but it was not seen again
i turned and looked down the ledge and i gave an exclamation that was one of relief and joy for there was rhodes just come into view around that projection in the wall
what i asked as he drew near did you find down there
we canot go down
the shelf is broken nothing but sheer wall between
so its across the bridge for us
we may never reach the other side
and then i told him what i had seen
and i asked grandfather scranton say that the eyes of the demon burned with a greenish fire
rhodes nodded
of course though he said light has to reach them or the eyes canot shine
in absolute darkness they would not do so
that eye shone though ghostly for the light that reaches that spot is dim
and so the angel at least and heaven only knows what besides is waiting there with her demon
yes bill there can be no doubt that the eye which you saw belonged to a demon
the prospect is certainly a sinister one i admit
a silence ensued
of a sudden rhodes raised his voice and hallooed hello there
the answer came almost on the instant hello there hello there hello there hello hello tis only echo lovely echo smiled milton rhodes
again he raised his voice and again the words were thrown back at him
hear that bill he cried whilst the echoes were still sounding heard it that was no echo no i said it was no echo
we waited listening intently but that sound which had come with the echoes was not heard again
rhodes drew his revolver and examined the weapon most carefully
he looked at me curiously and then he said have no desire bill to disguise the fact that this crossing may prove a most a most bill it may prove you neednot tell me said know very well what it may mean
but we canot turn back bill
no we canot turn back
he reached out his hand and grasped mine
and then without another word we started
i had known some critical teirible horrible scenes in my life but never anything like the suspense and mystery of those moments that now succeeded
what were we to see
what were we to meet
and horror of horrors it would be in that place where the bridge narrowed to a mere ribbon the frightful depths yawning on each side almost at our veiy feet
well at last we reached it
my head began to swim so terrible was the place and i had to stop and get a grip upon my nerves
rhodes too paused and for some moments we stood there so near to safety and yet the mockery of it closer than ever to mystery and danger and perhaps horror unnamable
now for it bill said rhodes
keep your revolver ready for instant action
and we started across
the place was so narrow that we could not think of walking side bv side
rhodes was leading
and then it came when we had taken eight or ten steps when we had reached the most dangerous spot on that ribbon of rock
of a sudden a dark figure straining at its leash moved from behind one of the limestone pillars and two eyes shone horribly in the light burning with a greenish fire and the strong rays were flashed back in the horrid gleam of teeth
and beside that demoniac shape a tall figure appeared a figure clothed in white the eyes wide and blazing the face white as snow and framed in gleaming gold which fell in masses about the shoulders a figure majestic indescribably lovely and dreadful
it was the angel and her demon strange weird scene like some terrible vision from the pages of dor6 often rises before me the tall white figure of the angel the dark squatting winged monster before her and we two men from the sunlit world standing there upon that narrow way the black profundity of the chasm yawning on either side of us
the angel had indeed well chosen the moment
if that hideous apebat straining at its leash were loosed at us our position despite our revolvers would be a truly horrible one
scarce twentyfive feet lay between the monster and ourselves
in case of attack we would have to drop the monster in its spring and only a lucky shot could do that or the result would be a most disastrous one
for we could not meet an attack there to step aside or to meet the demon in a struggle would mean a plunge over the edge
it was indeed a critical appalling scene one in which i have no desire to see even my worst enemy placed
our fate i thought was in the hands of that whiterobed whitefaced being whom we knew as the angel
the dembn however as will be seen in a moment was to take the matter in his own hands if i may use that expression in speaking of that monster for hands the thing had none
i can easily see how the demon in the obscurity of the fog had seemed to old scranton a thing that had no shape
but here the strong rays of our lights turned full upon the demon the sight was an altogether different one
and a stranger sight surely no man had ever seen up there in that world which we had left that world so near to us still and yet it seemed so very far away now
it was as though some circe had changed us into figures in some dread story of ancient days
and this was what men called the twentieth century the golden age of science and discovery
well science doesnot yet know everything a fact that i am sorry to say some scientists themselves are very prone to forget
heavens said rhodes keeping his look fixed on those figures before us she a wonderful creature
and it said an awful thing and i d wait a while before saying that she is wonderful
she may prove to be something very different
the next instant i gave a cry
the demon had made a sudden strain forward
came a sharp word from the angel and that cerberus sank back again
but though it sank back that greenish fire in its eyes seemed to burn more fiercely malevolently than before think i suggested it would be a good plan to move back a little back to a safer a wider spot
move back
never said milton rhodes
we are here to move forward not to go back
i thought this utterly quixotic but of course if he didnot want to go back i couldnot make him
and if he wouldnot step back neither would look i said
she is going to speak
the angel raised her left hand and motioned to us rather vehemently at the same time uttering some word or words
no mistaking that bill said milton
no it is as plain as any words could be go back am at a loss said rhodes how to answer
again the angel raised her hand but she did not motion this time for the demon with a bloodcurdling sound deep in its throat strained forward again and so suddenly and strongly that the angel was drawn forward a step or two
a sharp word however from the angel and the monster settled back as a dog does after straining at its leash
once more the angel fixed her eyes upon us or rather upon milton rhodes
once more she raised her hand to sign to us to go back
but the sign was never given
at that instant as the angel stood there with upraised hand it happened
that sound came again only more horrible than before and the demon sprang at us
caught thus off her guard the angel was jerked whirled forward
there was a wild piercing cry which rose to a scream but the winged monster paid not the slightest heed
it was as though the thing had gone mad
the angel went down in an instant however she was up again
she screamed at the demon but it lunged toward us flapping its great hideous wings and dragging her after it out onto the bridge
her position now was one of peril scarcely less than our own
all this had passed of course with the quickness of thought
we could not fire for fear of hitting the angel right behind the demon we could not move back and we could not stand there and let this nightmare monster come upon us
in a second or two if nothing was done it could do so
but what could we do
the thought of saving ourselves by killing the woman and the chances were a hundred to one that we should kill her if we fired at the demon was a horrible one
but to stand there and be sent over the edge was horrible too
and the angel in all probability would be killed anyway that she had not already been jerked from the rock was nothing less than a miracle
why didnot she loose her hold on the leash these are some of the things that flashed through my mind yes even then
i never before knew what a rapid thing thought can be
oh those things that shot through my brain in those brief horrible seconds
my whole life from childhood to that very moment flashed before me liko the film of a cinematograph though with the speed of light
i wondered what death was like what it would be like somewhere in the depths of that black gulf
and i wondered why the angel did not loose her hold on that leash
i didnot know that she had wrapped the chain around her hand and that the chain had in some way got caught
the poor angel could not free herself little wonder forsooth that she was screaming so fearfully
we must risk it
i cried
hold
the next instant milton rhodes had stepped aside yes stepped right to the very edge of the rock
the demon whirled at him and as it whirled one of its great wings struck me full across the face
i gave myself up for lost but how i kept my plaoe on that ribbon of rock
another instant and the monster would be at milton s throat
but no from this dizzy position which he had so suddenly taken the angel was no longer behind the demon and on the instant rhodes fired
oh that scream which the monster gave
it struck the rock and that rhodes managed to keep his footing on the edge of that fearful place is one of the most amazing things that i have ever seen
but keep it he did and he fired again and again
the demon flapped backward jerked the angel to her knees and near the edge and then suddenly flat on her face
the next instant the monster disappeared
its wings were beating against the rock with a spasmodic hideous sound
i gave a cry of relief and joy but the next moment one of dismay and horror broke from me
the monster was dragging the angel over the edge f ilton rhodes threw himself prone on the rock and his right arm around the angels waist
quick bill quick her arm the whole weight of the monster
her sereams had ceased but from her throat broke a moan long tremulous heartrending a sound to shake and rend my already quivering nerves to enhance most dreadfully the indescribable horror of the scene and the moment
i could do nothing where i was had to step over the prostrate forms which in my heated imagination were being dragged over the edge
the wings of the demon were still beating against the rock the blows not so strong but more spasmodic the sound a leathery sickening tattoo
it will probably be remembered that the angel had held the demon with her right hand
i was now on the angels right and stretched out on the rock i reached down over the edge in an effort to free her from that dragging monster the black depths over which we hung turning me dizzy and faint
i now saw how the angel had been caught and that she had been dragged so far over the edge that i could not longarmed though i am reach the leash
so i grasped her arm and with a word of encouragement began to pull
slowly we drew the monster up
another moment and the chain would be within the reach of my other hand
yes there
steady so
i had reached down my other hand my fingers were in the very act of closing on the chain when horrors i felt myself slipping along the smooth rock slipping over into that appalling gulf
to save myself i had to let go the angels arm and as the chain jerked to the monsters weight an awful cry broke from the angel and from milton rhodes and i saw her body dragged farther over
cut it bill cut it a chain
rhodes groaned
we must try again
great heaven we canot let her be dragged over
this horrible spot makes the head swim
steady bill steady said rhodes
here hold her while get a grip with my other arm
then i ll get a hold on you with my right all be dragged over
nonsense said rhodes
and besides got a hold with my feet now in a crack or something
a few moments and i was again reaching down rhodes grip upon me this time
again i laid hold on the angels arm and again she and i drew the monster up
this time though i got my other hand on the chain
and yet even then the chain hanging slack above my hand the angel was some time in freeing her own from the fingers of which blood was dripping
but at last she had loosened the chain hnd then i let go my hold upon it and down the demon went still flapping its wings though feebly now and disappeared into those black and fearful depths
i have no recollection of any sound coming up
undoubtedly a sound came
little wonder forsooth that i did not hear it
a moment and i was back from the edge and milton and i were drawing the angel to the safety of that narrow way
she sank back in rhodes arms her eyes closed her head almost hidden in the gleaming golden hair on her shoulder fainted said little wonder if she has bill
but she had not
scarcely had he spoken when she opened her eyes
at once she sat tip and i saw a faint color suffuse those snowy features
well said i to myself whatever else she may be our angel is human
we remained there for a little while recovering from the effects of the horrible scene through which we had passed then arose and started for that place of safety there amongst the wonderful stupendous limestone pillars
i was now moving in advance and i confess and nothing could more plainly show how badly my nerves had been shaken that i would gladly have covered those few remaining yards on all fouls if my pride would have permitted me to do so
yes there we stood by that very pillar behind which the angel had waited for us with her demon
there was her lamp lantern rather dark of course though not extinguished
i looked at it and looked all around
we saw two lights i said
and yet she was waiting here alone there certainly were two lights bill two persons at least
her companion went somewhere that is the only explanation i can think of wonder where said and what for
help perhaps
you know bill i have an idea that if we had delayed much longer our reception there and he waved a hand toward the bridge would have been a very different one
it was interesting enough to suit me
and as it is heaven only knows what is to follow
the angel standing there straight and still was watching us intently so strange a look in her eyes those eyes were blue that a chill passed through my heated brain and actually began to wonder if i was being hypnotized
hypnotized
and in this cursed spot i turned my lbok straight into the eyes of the angel and as i looked i flung a secret curse at that strange weakness of mine and called myself a fool for haying entertained even for a fleeting moment a thought so absurd
rhodes had noticed and he turned his look upoii me and upon the woman this creature so indescribably lovely and yet with so indefinable mysterious a sibylline something about her
for some moments there was silence
i thought that i saw fear in those blue eyes of hers but i could not be sure
that strange look whether one of fear or of something else was not all that i saw there but i strove in vain to find a name or a meaning for what i saw
science science
this was the age of science the age of the airplane the submarine radium television and radio and yet here was a scene to make science herself rub her eyes in amazement a scene that might have been taken right out of some wild story or out of some myth of the ancient world
well that ancient world too had its science some of which science i fear though this thought would have brought a poohpooh from milton rhodes man has lost to his sorrow
and like that ancient world so perhaps had this strange underground world which we had entered or rather were trying to enter
and perhaps of that science or some phases of it this angel before us had fearful command
one moment i told myself that we should need all the courage we possessed all the ingenuity and resource of that science of which milton rhodes himself was the master the next that i was letting my imagination overleap itself
my thoughts were suddenly broken by the voice of milton
goodness bill look at her hand i forgot he stepped toward the angel and gently lifted her blooddripping hand
the chain had sunk right into the soft wrist
the angel however with a smile and a movement with her left hand gave us to understand that the hurt was nothing
the next moment she gave an exclamation and gazed past me down the pillared cavern
instantly i turned and as i did so i too exclaimed
there far off amongst the columns two yellow wrathful lights were gleaming and dark hurrying figures were moving toward us help is coming bill said a milton rhodes
and that reminds me i haven t reloaded my revolver would lose no time in doing so i told him
he got out the weapon and proceeded to reload it
it was not by the way one of these newfangled things but one of your good oldfashioned revolvers solid substantial one that would stand hard usage a piece to be depended upon
and that was what we needed weapons to be depended upon
the angel was watching rhodes closely
i wondered if she knew what had killed her demon knew i mean that this metal thing with its glitter so dull and so cold was a weapon
it was extremely unlikely that she had in that horrible moment on the bridge seen what actually had happened
however that might have been it was soon plain that she recognized the revolver as a weapon or at any rate guessed that it was
with an interjection she stepped to rhodes side and with swift pantomime she assured us that there was nothing at all to apprehend from those advancing figures
after all milton said slipping the revolver into his pocket why should we be so infernally suspicious
maybe this world is very different from our own
it seems to me i told him my right hand in that pocket which contained my revolver that we have good cause to be suspicious
have you forgotten what grandfather scranton saw up there at the tamahnowis rocks and what he didnot see and the horrible death there of rhoda dillingham to say nothing of what happened to us here a few minutes ago
that we are not at the bottom of that chasm well i am not anxious to have another shave like that have not forgotten bill
i have an idea though that those awful tragedies up there were purely accidental
certainly we know that the demons attack upon ourselves was entirely so
accidental
great scott some consolation that looked at milton rhodes and i looked at the angel who had taken a few steps forward and was awaiting those hurrying figures a whiterobed figure still and tall one lovely majestic
and if i didnot sigh i certainly felt like doing so demon there bill observed milton at last his eyes upon those advancing forms
i see none
four figures
four nodded rhodes
two men and two women
a few moments and they stepped out into a sort of aisle amongst the great limestone pillars
the figure in advance came to an abrupt halt
an exclamation broke from him and echoed and reechoed eerily through the vast and gloomy cavern
it was answered by the angel and as her voice came murmuring back to us it was as though fairies were hidden amongst the columns and were answering her
but there was nothing fairylike in the aspect of that leader who was advancing again or his male companion
that aspect was grim formidable
each carried a powerful bow and had an arrow fitted to the string and at the left side a short heavy sword
that aspect of theirs underwent a remarkable metamorphosis however as they came on toward us what with the explanations that our angel gave them
when they at last halted a few yards from the spot where we stood every sign of hostility had vanished
it was patent however that they were wary suspicious
that they should be so was not at all strange but just the same there was something in their manner that i could not understand something that made me resolve to be on my guard whatever might betide
the leader was a tall man of sinewy and powerful frame
though he had i judged passed the halfcentury mark he had suffered it seemed no loss of youthful vitality or strength
his companion tall and almost as powerful as himself was a much younger man in his early twenties
their golden hair was bobbed for all the world like your truly bobbified flappers
the arms were bare as ere the legs from midway the thigh to below the knee the nether extremities being incased in buskins light but evidently of excellent material
as for the companions of the twain one was a girl seventeen or eighteen years of age the other a girl a couple of years older
each had a bow and quiver as did our angel
the older of these young ladies had golden hair a shade lighter than the angels whilst the hair of the younger was white as snow
at first i thought that it must be powdered but this as not so
and as i gazed with interest and wonder upon this lovely creature i thought of christopher columbus and sir isaac at thirty they had hair like hers
that thought however was a fleeting one
this was no time forsooth to be thinking of old christopher and sir isaac
stranger more wonderful was this old world of ours than even columbus or newton ever had dreamed it
the age of our angel by the way i placed at about twentyfive years
and i wondered how they could possibly reckon time here in this underground world a world that could have neither months nor years
the quartfct listened eageilv to the explanations given by our angel
suddenly the leader addressed some question to persephone as rhodes called her
and then we heard it drome was her answer
there it was distinct unmistakable that mysterious word which had given us so many strange and wild thoughts and visions
yes there it was and it was an answer i thought that by no means put the mans mind at ease
drome drome at last
but did it mean
drome
there we distinctly heard the angel pronounce the word again
drome if we could only have understood the words being spoken
but there was no mistaking i thought the manner of the angel
it was earliest and yet strangely enough that sibylline quality about her was now more pronounced than ever
but there was no mistaking her manner she was endeavoring to reassure him to allay it seemed some strange uneasiness or fear
i noticed however with some vague sinister misgivings that in this she was by no means as successful as she herself desired
why did we see in the eyes of the leader and in those of the others so strange so mysterious a look whenever those eyes were turned toward that spot where milton rhodes and i stood
however these gloomy thoughts were suddenly broken but certainly not banished
with an acquiescent reply at any rate so i thought it to the angel the leader abruptly faced us
he placed his bow and arrow upon the ground slipped the quiver from his back drew his sword it was doublebladed
i now noted from its scabbard and deposited them too upon the ground
his companion was following suit the two girls who were now holding the lights standing by motionless and silent
the men advanced a few paces
each placed his sword hand over his heart uttered something in measured and sonorous tones and bowed low to us a proceeding i noted out of the corner of my eye that not a little pleased our angel remarked milton rhodes his expression one of the utmost gravity when in drome bill do as the dromans do
and we returned the bow of the hypogeans hereupon the men stepped back to their weapons which they at once resumed and the young woman without moving from the spot inclined her head to us in a most stately fashion
bow again from rhodes and myself
this ceremony over i hoped that we had done the thing handsomely the angel turned to us and told us in pantomime of course that we avere now friends and that her heart was glad
friends said i to myself
you are no gladder madam than i am but all the same i am going to be on my guard
the girls mo ed to the angel and with touching tenderness examined her bleeding avrist which the younger at once proceeded to bandage carefully
she had made to bathe the wound but this the angel had not permitted from avhieh it avas patent that there avould be no access to water for some time yet
our amalthea and her companions now held an earnest consultation
again heard her pronounce that word drome
and again we in the look and mien of the others doubt and uneasiness and something i thought besides
but this avas for a moments only
either they acquiesced wholly in avhat the angel urged or they mashed their feelings
i wished that i knew which it was
and yet had i known i should have been none the wiser forsooth unless i had been cognizant of what it was that the angel was urging so earnestly and with such confidence
that it was something closely concerning ourselves was of course obvious
that it or part of it was to the effect that we should be taken to some place was i believed virtually certain
not that this made matters a whit clearer or in any measure allayed my uneasiness
for where were we to be taken
and to what to drome but what and where was this drome
was drome a place was it a thing was it a human being or what was it
such were some of the thoughts that came to me as i stood there
but what good to wonder to question when there could be no answer forthcoming
sooner or later the answer would be ours
and in the meantime well more than sufficient unto the day was the mystery thereof
and besides hadnot rhodes and i come to find mysteries
assuredly
and assuredly it was not likely that we would be disappointed
this grave matter whatever it was decided the angel plunged into a detailed account of what had happened on the bridge
we thought that we followed her recital very closely so expressive were her gestures
when she told how we had saved her from that frightful chasm she was interrupted by exclamations all eyes were turned upon us and i felt certain in that moment that we were indeed friends
still heaven only knew what awaited us
tt was well of course to be sanguine but that did not mean that we should blink facts however vague and mysterious those facts might be
there was a momentary pause
when she went on i saw the angels lower lip begin to tremble and tears come into her eyes
she was describing the death of her demon her poor poor demon
well as regards appearances i must own that i would greatly prefer that hideous apebat of hers to many a bulldog that i have seen
the others too looked distressed
and indeed i have no doubt that we ourselves had we known all about demons would have been well at least troubled
little did milton and i dream that the loss of that winged monster might entail upon our little band the most serious consequences
so however it was as we were soon to learn
when she had ended her account the angel turned to us forthwith and went through an earnest and remarkable pantomime
she and the others awaited our answer with the most intense interest
but the only answer we could give her was that we did not understand
that pantomime had been wholly unintelligible to milton rhodes and myself
i say wholly unintelligible we could see however that it had something to do with ourselves and something to do with something up above but everything else in it was an utter mystery
the angel went through it again more slowly moie carefully and more fully this time
but still we could not understand
perhaps i suggested she could tell us with paper and pencil
not a bad idea bill
thereat rhodes produced pencil and notebook
these he gave to the angel with a sign that she put it down in the book
she regarded the pencil curiously for some moments tried it upon the paper and then with some difficulty and undoubtedly some pain what with her ed wrist she began
rhodes moved to her right side i to her left
yes there could be no mistaking that she had drawn the tamahnowis rocks
then she drew a crevasse and two figures plainly
rhodes and myself going down into it
that was clear as the day
then she put those figures that were rhodes and i into the tunnel and presto with a wave of the hand she brought them down to that very spot where we were standing
clear again lovely sibyl
what next more figures and more and more and were they too coming down the tunnel
yes atlast it all was plain at last we wise numskulls understood her
were we alone rhodes made it clear to her that we were
but he did not stop there he proceeded to make it clear to her that tee only knew the secret
she was some time in understanding this but when she did understand it what a look was that which passed across her lovely sibylline features
great heaven said i to myself gone and done it now
the look was one of joy the look of a soul triumphant
in a moment however it was gone her features were only lovely impassive
but the thoughts and the feelings which that strange look of hers had aroused were not gone
i felt a shudder pass to my heart
of a truth this woman was dreadful
i glanced at rhodes i thought that even he looked grave and troubled
well so i thought might hebe i said nothing however until the angel had rejoined her companions
then there can be not the slightest doubt that they look with great fear upon the coming of people from that world above a world as mysterious i suppose to them as this subterranean world of theirs is to us
and now that they know that they have the great secret also when they have you and me well milton old tillicum think it will indeed be strange if either of us ever again casts a shadow in the sun
it may be so bill he said soberly did pot think of that when i told her
still who knows
certainly not it is possible indeed probable it seems to me that we may do them her bill a harsh injustice sincerely hope so
that grave look left his face and he smiled at me and besides billy me lad maybe we won t ever want to return to that world we have left that world so full of ignorance and yet so full of knowledge and science too that world so cruel and yet sometimes so strangely kind that world so full of hate and mad passion and yet with ideals and aspirations so very noble and lofty
yes who knows bill
it is possible that we may not want to return
was it significant or was it puiely casual
i could not decide
but rhodes gaze was now on the angel
and whilst i stood pondering she turned and signed to us that they stood in readiness to proceed
she raised a hand and pointed down the cavern in some subtle manner making it clear that she was pointing to something far very far away
drome she said
drome nodded milton rhodes
he turned to me
ready bill
ready i told him
and so we started
next months chapters describe a veritable inferno as the dromans and rhodes and carter penetrate through weirdly flickering phosphorescent lights into a region of strange and terrible monsters which attack them
frenchman and patriot more yankee than the nativeborn since he took out naturalization papers wears the british flag in his buttonhole on independence day
a story hangs upon this the story of a dead hero to whom the presence of paul became an outrage and abomination
and it was brodsky who saved paul from his postmortem vengeance
the psychical investigations of dr ivan brodsky and the marvelous results which he had obtained in his warfare against the hosts of evil some of which i have previously recounted had by this time made him known to a large circle of those to whom such things as spiritual possession are facts rather than theories
in hospitals in prisons wherever we find pain and sin congregated occult manifestations are a commonplace of this is the sixth of a series of stories each complete in itself dealing with dr ivan brodsky the surgeon of soule existence though fear of ridicule debars the inmates from making any mention of them
it was in such institutions that reputation spread broadcast
but there are prisons for the dead as well as the living as i shall show
neither brodsky nor i was greatly surprized when a visitor entered his study one evening and implored his aid in the unraveling of a mystery which had he was convinced a supernatural explanation
at least i canot help thinking so myself sir said the man speaking fluently but with a slight foreign accent
although i am not a believer in such things myself
brodsky s brows clouded that was the stock phrase that he detested
if you do not believe in such things how dare you make the suggestion that they exist he cried
be honest with yourself and with me man or go elsewhere
do you believe in them or do you not
yes sir i do replied our visitor
but when one makes such an admission one is ridiculed it s hard humph grunted the doctor
go ahead with your story
the visitor sat down and fingered his hat nervously
he was apparently a man of the laboring class to judge from his appearance yet he showed signs of intelligence superior to that of most of his kind
i could account for his mental disturbance only when he had finished his story a frenchman by birth sir he began and been seven years in this country
dupuy is my name a naturalized citizen and proud of my adopted country
i learned my trade in paris it s a queer trade and theres not many throughout the whole world follows it so that it pays well especially as it requires a certain amount of artistic ability though less than you would suppose
i am a maker of wax figures for the waxworks theater on fifth street
you may not know the place gentlemen for people seem somehow to have lost interest in that form of entertain ment though it used to be the craz vears gone by
my task is to model lifesize wax figures of all people of ifrominence got the famous murderers of course and the presidents and the heroes of the revolution and all the famous kings and queens of england the great soldiers and sailors wellington napoleon nelson fan gh said the doctor
let the dead rest in their graves you know that every time you set up an image of the dead you form a focus in which all that remains of his personality on earth concentrates
that commandment against making replicas of life in stone which ould have included wax my friend had ax figures been known was the wisest and most spiritual of all
go well sir said our visitor as i told you constantly at work fashioning these figures for mr margotson the proprietor
we didnot have any of naval officors up to a few eeks ago but mr margotson is always looking out for something new so he says to me dupuy lets have a few statues of naval officers of historv
do you remember any
sure said villeneuve and st page and quit talking french said mr margotson
what about john paul jones and nelson
so i set to work and made replicas of them
the one of jones was fair but the nelson statue was firstrate i did it all from his portraits and there he stands in the gallery with one arm and one eye and everybody who comes in recognizes him at once
and that brings me to the point
ah youve had trouble with nelson cried brodsky
mon dku said dupuy lapsing into his native tongue as he wiped his forehead trying to murder me
the man broke off and eyed us furtively
i had long learned to keep guard over my face but incredulity was in my heart
as for the doctor he said nothing and the man continued it must have been a eek ago that the first thing happened
i was adjusting the scabbard of his sword we use real swords in our scabbards and the point flew through and went right into my wrist just missed a large artery
look he held his hand up for our inspection
there was a ragged cut half healed along the base of the hand
and swear that the figure pushed the sword through the scabbard pushed it violently for it cut clear through the leather
but i didn t catch on just then
then four days afterward as i was passing it the thing flew from its pedestal and keeled me over
my head just missed the iron radiator by two inches
and i tell you it didnot fall it fairly threw itself at me
what does mr margotson say to that asked brodsky
he laughs at me
i donot know what to do
i ve half a mind to melt it and let margotson discharge me and yet i have my wife to think of and theres no demand for such men as me the business having fallen off so
and if i stay there one day the thing will kill me
enough said brodsky go there at once
can we get in have the key answered the frenchman putting on his hat three left the house together
we caught a car on the main road which ran past us one block away and half an hour later stepped out at the entrance to the waxworks theater which stood in what was now the heart of the business section of the city and was in consequence almost completely deserted at this hour of the evening
our companion pulled out a key and opened a side door
we went up to a great hall round which were ranged statues of celebrities lifesize figures of strikingly human aspect
and yet mused brodsky stopping to regard a group of cleverly arranged heroes of our civil war the men who erect these think they have nothing more than the external shells
how ignorant they are of the psychic qualities of their actions indeed what da they dream of anything beyond the material
yet this gallery is almost a breeding ground of souls
who can measure what influences such beings draw down to them
well at least no evil spirit would be attracted hither among these men who offered up their lives for their country
dupuy led the way toward an end of the great hall
here i saw a group of figures attired in georgian dress evidently nelson would be found among these
one of them however seemed singularly incongruous and out of place
it was a short thickset man in the costume of a mechanic of today
it seemed to move i started then i discovered that it was a living man
mr margotson cried dupuy in confusion
but the proprietor seemed still more confused than his assistant
he came forward sheepishly and a mask seemed to have descended upon his blank face and blotted out some curious emotions which i had thought that i read there
mr margotson these are two gentlemen who are interested in what i told you about the statue dupuy stammered
margotson s face grew black with rage
newspaper writers eh he shouted
come to write up my museum i suppose
i donot want your advertising i ve got all the customers i want and you canot do me no good
damn your curiosity this fools been telling you some of his silly yarns about the nelson statue i suppose this rage appeared so abnormal that my medical training induced me to examine margotson from the pathological standpoint
but brodsky looked into his face steadily and land his hand upon his shoulder
margotson s anger seemed suddenly to evaporate only interested in the statues turning into flesh and blood sir said the frenchman
unluckily these words brought about a return of margotson s frenzy
flesh and blood
rubbish he shouted
arrant nonsense thats what youre talking dupuy the matter with the statue a very good statue one of the best youve made new wax green wax we call it in the trade and it ought to have had time to mature only the public were so crazed over the naval officers that i didnot have time to let it lie why its hardening because of the fumes from the leather factory across the street
they drift in here something terrible all thats the matter with it
look
he switched on an electric light upon the wall behind him and for the first time i saw clearly the face of the great english hero
there were the irregular thin homely features lit by a flame of patriotic enthusiasm
yet admirably as the artist had caught the inspiration of the painting from which he modeled it there seemed something more some hardly defined vein of cruelty of caprice that actually gave the face the property of seeming to reflect a certain change of emotions an instability of mind as though the thing possessed some conscious life
and the skin surely that was the skin of a man with the blood mantling in the flesh beneath
dupuy started back with a wild cry at him
look
i swear i never put that smile upon his face he screamed changing changing i tell you
lord preserve us all get rid of it mr margotson
if you hand me out any more of that nonsense fire you on the spot shouted the enraged proprietor going daffy dupuy thats whats the matter with you always had that smile
examine the wax gentlemen its hardened thats all
with horror and repulsion i laid my finger on the smooth surface of the cheek
so lifelike did it appear that i could have sworn the blood faded out of the arterioles beneath the pressure blanching the surface of the skin
and yet it was of wax
it was not flesh and blood
but flesh and blood differed less from it than it differed from the unreal and waxen figures around it
it stooped half forward it seemed instinct with slowly dawning vitality
and surely its expression had changed it had not smiled thus with the cold malevolence of a conqueror when first i had seen it
then suddenly margotson seemed transformed
as though he adapted his mood to suit his mind he burst into a wild peal of laughter
good old nelson he shouted and the sounds echoed from the roof and rang through the hall while for one dreadful moment i could have sworn that an answering emotion flitted across that waxen face
good boy nelson
a miracle of art dupuy
i canot tear myself away from watching him raise your salary
he makes me feel so good
he wants me to do something for him and find out what it is and do it given him a body and he s getting your reason my friend said brodsky somewhat shaken by this unexpected outburst
come away come away gentlemen cried the frenchman pulling us by the arms mad god help him
i should have told you hed been acting queer but last night when he laughed at me so much i thought that it was only overwork
he s as mad as a loon
we did not need to be urged nor was there necessity of excuses
margotson had already forgotten us and was standing before the statue alternately capering and grimacing
now give you my advice and shortly you can follow it or not at your peril said brodsky
get your employer home in safety and then slip back and chop the thing to pieces before a tragedy supervenes
no thats all got to say to you except just this give up your rade and learn something that wonot ring you into conflict with all these vital forces that hang round such daces
and with these words he fairly turled himself out of the place leaving me to follow him as best i could think i mentioned once how sensitive the doctor always was to he morbid things of life
perhaps it was a certain sensibility to those invisible influences which accompany noods and invest those places where any violent emotions have been at play
at any rate having seen so nuch of the darker side of life brodky was strenuously insistent upon cleanliness and wholesomeness got to leave such tilings done and work in the sun he used say
this is our working day when the night comes at last may our good deeds be our protective armor igainst all the host of devils on the night shores that we shall pass hrough
you believe we have to pass hrough some place of purgation
i asked have to clean up somehow in this life or the next he answered
we canot get into heaven with dirty fingernails
so on this occasion i forebore to question him when we got home
brodsky went to a closet where he kept many relics of his earlier life md came out with a small union jack upon a moldering staff
the flag of the vessel that bore me from poland where the missaries were seeking my life he aid sadly
to what better use can it be put
then he explained the mystery
it is a fetish he said filling his tipe and puffing at it slowly
it is exactly similar in every particular to the idols of the west africans or for that matter to any idol
the savage makes some dreadful idol to worship sacrifices to it until the thing becomes instinct with life and filled with all the passions of the worshipers then a devil has been called into existence whose evil influence is incalculable
i tell you it was no mythical devil that the early christian missionaries had to face nor those of today
after death the pure spirit flies to its appointed resting place leaving its two bodies moldering behind it
one is that earthly body that we all know the other is the soul body the body of desires a semiconscious force that survives for months or years according to the condition of the dead being
do not mistake me this is not nelson
that great admiral is unconscious of this replica of him there in the waxworks theater
it is a group of emotions such as possessed nelson a man of strong feelings yet not necessarily his
the warm enthusiasm of the crowds that have visited that place have focused these emotions much as the burning glass focuses the rays of the sun
remember as yet this creature is only half conscious
it vaguely as in a dream feels this life within itself it is rising toward a conscious existence
and that fool margotson is the tool by which it means to wreak its enmity upon dupuy
but why does it hate the frenchman so much i asked
do you not recollect motto the doctor asked hate a frenchman as you would the devil
this elemental being that has attracted these emotions that made up the great admirals soulbody has necessarily the identical feeling
what does it know of the time that has elapsed or the changes of history is the frenchman and it will have his life by itself if possible
if it can not kill him as it tried it will certainly do so th rough son
well its none of ray business he added
i ve warned dupuy
and he went to bed while i forgot to ask the purpose of the union jack which i saw him stuff into his pocket
but i knew that brodsky could not dismiss his own responsibility so easily
he did not undress for from my room which adjoined his own i heard him pacing the floor with short quick footsteps the greater portion of the night
i fell asleep at last and had hardly closed my eyes two minutes as it seemed before i heard the front doorbell jangled violently i started up in bed filled with horrible presentiments of evil and began to dress myself hurriedly
a few moments later brodsky tapped loudly upon my door
dress yourself as quickly as you can he called work on foot for both of us before the morning
as i hurried on my clothes i heard an agitated voice in the sitting room outside which i had little difficulty in recognizing as that of the assistant at the waxworks theater
my judgment was correct when i emerged i found him seated in a chair in a condition of collapse and brodsky standing over him holding a glass of some stimulant to his lips
the doctor was fully dressed even to his hat and from his pocketthere protruded a small corner of the british flag
we went out together without any explanations
luckily the cars ran at intervals and we reached the corner of the main street
we clambered in it was empty andduring the ride i learned in broken ejaculations from the man the cause of iiis visit
he had halted irresolutely at the entrance to the waxworks theater after we left him
then he retracedhis steps determined to carry out the doctors instructions as soon as he could get margotson away
he saw his employer standing before the statue regarding it silently as though in a trance
dupuy crept up to him passing the statue of necessity upon the opposite side
and then he realized that margotson had drawn the sword from the scabbard of the admiral and stood in such an attitude that dupuy could neither advance nor retreat
at the same time he experienced a return of that deathly faintness that had possessed him on a previous occasion as he described to us
as in a trance he saw margotson advance stealthily toward him while he remained incapable of resistance then he recovered his senses and leaned aside as margotson thrust
running like the wind he gained the street outside and had presence of mind enough to lock the door behind him
but i donot come in he insisted as we gained the side door
no sir seen enough for tonight
i donot go in
it took all resolution to persuade dupuy to come
without his presence the doctor said he would be powerless
with him he might still break this spell and bring back margotson to sanity
and at last very timidly dupuy crept in behind the doctor
as brodsky unlocked the door the key fell from his fingers
the key
you must find it he cried to me
under no circumstances may you follow us without it
to do so may be fatal
remember
and before i had time to answer i saw him spring lightly up the stairway dragging the unwilling frenchman with him
my immediate impulse was to dash after him then discipline came to my aid and i stooped for the key
the night was dark and it was two minutes before i found it
then suddenly from within i heard wild shouts and a stampede
i sprang up the stairs and along the hall running with sobbing breath and clenched fists till i gained the end where i saw shadows hovering
frantically i switched on an electric light
then i perceived margotson his face aflame like a madmans thrusting at brodsky with the admirals sword while the doctor parried him with admirable grace and ease
dupuy came running up to me
he rushed at me he cried with his sword drawn and dr brodsky snatched a sword from paul jones replica and met him
look
the doctor wins
like every polish gentleman brodsky was an adept with the foils
certainly a clumsy mechanic such as margotson could not have expected to overcome him
yet as i watched the tense interchange of swordplay i was amazed at the skill shown by margotson
it seemed as though the courage and prowess of the great admiral had descended upon him
twice he lunged so fiercely that the point grazed arm then with a sudden twist he sent the weapon flying from the doctors hand and rushed not at him but straight toward dupuy
so swift was the impetus he was upon us before we could stir
and then just as the blade seemed about to pierce the heart something came fluttering downwaid over his head and the sword fell from margotson s hand and he stood still his eyes fixed upon vacancy his body immobile while dupuy released himself from the folds of the union jack that brodsky had so admirably thrown over him nd you think i can go back to my job asked dupuy the next morning
by all means answered the doctor
margotson will remember nothing whatever of his insanity
so youd better hurry up or he will want to know why you are late
you need not fear the statue
it ill have resumed its natural aspect and in case any remnants of its power remain keep a small british flag in your buttonhole especially on holidays such as independence day
yes thats your penalty dupuy patriot as you say you are the only alternative being the destruction of the statue which margotson wonot allow
and when you can try to get another occupation
it was a desperate chance confided brodsky to me afterward
still one can deal with these elemental forces much as the lunatics the mad impulse of national hatred was shattered instantly when it perceived the flag of its country
when margotson wakes up upon the floor of the gallery he will think that he got drunk tire night before
but tell me i cried suddenly why did you make me wait till i found the key
then the solution came to me
you knew our lives were in danger and wished to save me from the possibility of injury i cried
pshaw muttered the doctor
just accept facts and donot put sentimental interpretations upon them
the seventh symphony the next story in this series will be published in weird tales next month
ke 4r we pressed sturl against the pipe and bound him tightly to it
nl
i a piece of string into the grate where presently it began to smolder
kobyssu stopped talking and sniffed
although in appearance he is ferocious with his little simian forehead his black bushes of eyebrows and his big bristling mustache he is in reality a fellow of most pleasant even temperament
but it was plain that the string had disturbed him greatly
his cheek had paled and i got a glimpse of his eyes as he bent forward swiftly in his chair and leveled them at the hearth
the expression in them was twofold
there was deep anger there was equally deep horror
he saw the string snatched at it and cast it into the heart of the fire so that it flamed instantly
pouf he said waving his hands in front of his nose and now exceedingly white
i was amazed but all i said was sorry i didnot think the smell would worry you
kobyssu looked round his cafe deserted at this hour of the afternoon
he looked at the neat tables at the walls at his desk rather with the air of a man who wished to assure himself that he was indeed in wardour street london and nowhere else
then he faced the fire again his eyes more normal but very somber
that smell of slowburning hemp it reminded me of something in czergona
but said you often tell me that every memory of your native country is dear to you
only yesterday you quoted some absurd proverb to a czerg the howl of a wolf in his homeland is more comforting than the lowing of his cattle in a foreign land
it is a true proverb
my country may be merely what your newspapers say a barren mountain range in but i love every memory of it except one
that is a memory of dreadful things
there was a table with coffee between our chairs
he filled my cup
from any country however great and refined one may get a memory of dreadful things he said defending czergona
i nodded
yet these were strangely dreadful he drew in his breath with a long hiss staring broodingly at the sugarbowl
the odor of that string recalled to me the church stove at raebrudafisk so suddenly so without warning that i believed i was back in the past and i felt the feelings of twelve years ago i had a shock
what about this stove
but pardon kobyssu perhaps it would pain you to tell me
perhaps the matter is personal
he shook his head was not directly concerned i am thankful to say
but the story is too fearful a thing to relate idly over coffee
and you would be sorry if i put it in your mind
you would strive to forget it and never forget it no no i do not want to tell it
but my curiosity had risen high
i urged kobyssu and he yielded
i am punished
i wish i had not heard a word of the tale of the church stove at raebrudafisk which kobyssu narrated in the fluent english that he has acquired so praiseworthily during recent years aebrudafisk he said is the village i was born in
it is on a hillside in a fir wood
the church which is of stone is a quarter of a mile from it up the hill
when as a little boy i was taken to church by my parents the stove used to interest me very much
it was not far from where we sat near the north wall
it was an upright iron cylinder about three feet high and two feet in diameter having a flat top with a flap at the edge of this which opened so that coal and wood could be poured in
a stout pipe went from the stove right up to the roof and through it
in summer of course the stove was not lit
in winter it was attended to by old uflio vaang
he would start the fire some two hours before the morning service and why the stove interested me was this by the time i entered the church the flat top would be a glowing red with dazzlingsparks appearing suddenly on it when specks of stuff fell there from the ceiling and the pipe would be red halfw ay to the roof brilliant red at the base duller the higher you looked yet hot you can imagine was extremely fond of that stove especially at evening service when snow and darkness and wolves were outside the church
i yearned to spend the night by it and thought pastor and people would be much more sensible to do so instead of faring down the hill all in a bunch for fear of the wolves
and i was a young rascal
i got into the habit of flicking bits of string on to the stove to see them smoke and burst into flame
but a thrashing from my father and another from the pastor cured me of that
there was a good draft to that stove it had some bars low down in front
and old uflio though everybody warned him not to drenched the fuel with oil before lighting it
stove and pipe were red long before church time
kobyssu drank some coffee and made a considerable pause
i knew he was hoping that some customer would arrive and give him a pretext for breaking off altogether
none came however so he shrugged his shoulders and proceeded
old uflio vaang was wonderful
he was completely blind
he had been blind since early manhood
with no difficulty he would find his own way to the church place his hand on anything he required and set the stove going
dangerous work for a blind man you will think eh
yet he was known to be so careful that despite the matter of oil people did not fear an accident
uflio s perception was uncanny
i have noticed the stove fail a trifle toward the end of morning service the top go from yellowscarlet to crimson and uflio sensing the change has risen from his chair and tiptoed down the church and picked up a small tongs and opened the flap gripping it at the first attempt and lump by lump not to make a loud noise he has dropped coal into the redhot thing running no more peril of burning himself than would a man with two healthy eyes
well twelve years ago when i was a swineherd of twenty and had not commenced to think of london or even of warsaw old uflio was still tending the stove
naturally i had lost my boyish interest in it
i never supposed that i should be interested in it again
kobyssu paused once more
when he resumed such a note of sadness was in his voice that i experienced a chill a dread and the first of my regrets at having importuned him for the story
i had not reckoned on a tragedy to a young girl which i perceived looming
uflio vaang had a daughter said he djira
she was sixteen pretty brightnatured oh delightful
she was the old mans only child and ashis wife was dead all in the world he had to care for
i was not in love with djira
i was thinking of a girl in the next village
but the other young men of raebrudafisk were in love with her as unhappily was a man not young
that was oik sturl whose age was forty and who was often in prison for stealing or violence
he was a sullen blackguard ordinarily when enraged he was the vilest of brutes
of course his chance to win djira the sweet fresh bud was hopeless
but i suppose he did not believe this until he waylaid her one afternoon far from our village
then she must have convinced him
would she had not poor child poor little innocent
the truth infuriated him
he cut her throat there and then
kobyssu
he did there and then said kobyssu the deep anger in his eyes again and his teeth glinting under his mustache
he clenched his fist and shook it at the floor
he did he repeated and he did more
that the scent of much blood might bring the wolves who would hide his crime he stabbed he hacked her little pure body ahh
kobyssu blew out his breath and drummed his fingers agitatedly on his knees
so this was what the stove that djira s father tended reminded kobyssu of
as it was fact not fiction i did not want to hear anything further
and yet i felt i must know what happened to the villain sturl
i said so and added in dismay kobyssu you donot have capital punishment in czergona do you
no he answered with a peculiar inflection of his voice
the wolves did not get djira he went on
we young men of raebrudafisk reached her first
for a boy saw what sturl did and ran to tell us
he ran for his life since sturl had caught sight of him and was chasing him
sturl could not overtake him and turned in another direction when he perceived the lad would gain the village
yes we went to djira and then we and the men of the whole countryside sought sturl
many among us vowed to slay him when we came upon him but the pastor and schoolmaster wiec who was the magistrate of the district sternly forbade this
for over two weeks in wild weather of sleet and bitter winds we hunted vainly scouring woods climbing to the niches in the mountaintops and even searching our coal mine to which we thought the piercing cold might have driven sturl
we wondered how he obtained food and at every step we took amid the trees or up the rocks we expected to discover him dead from exposure
you can conceive and pity uflio this while
i consider that his lot was worse than she the one earthly gladness of his blind life she the bright the gentle whose lips and hands caressed him so lovingly whose greeting woke him in the morning whose voice told him the hues of the sky and the promise of the garden she held by a foul hand and slaughtered that is what he had to think of
small wonder that for days the torment made him almost insane and that our womenfolk could give him no consolation
the sunday after the murder he did not go to the church being too ill and weak
on the following thursday however when there was an evening service he took up his routine and the stove was glowing when we entered the church
it was sad indeed to look at uflio in his usual seat but bent and tremulous with his cheeks so sunken and ghastly that he was scarcely to be recognized
perhaps it was saddest to notice the coal smears and a tiny gleam of oil on his hands when he raised them
little djira had always been most careful to wipe them for him ere service began
as i said for over two weeks we searched for sturl and we found not a trace of him
then at dawn one morning our village was roused by a new alarm
the village of phvamu four miles away where they find and store oil was on fire
schoolmaster wioe wanted every man of us to hurry across and aid the phvamu people
i had broken my arm two days previously seeking sturl
to witness the blaze however i set out with the rest
my chirm vavik rista and a dozen others took a path which went by the church
although it rose steeply we began to cover it at a trot
we had gone a hundred yards past the church when a man his clothes fluttering in rags sprang out into the way in front of us sprang as if from his sleep and trying to run before either of his feet was well back on the ground he seemed to wrench one and fell
he was sturl
vavik and seveial more darting forward instantly reached him as he came to his knees and held him
lend me a knife said vavik whom djira had shown many indications of loving
but two or three cried no no what will the pastor and schoolmaster wiee say
yet there were others who agreed with vavik and it was a long time before we could quiet them
and all this while phyamu is burning and we are needed cried someone
he pointed to the thin strong ropes many were carrying to the scene of the fire
tie the beast to a tree until we come back
wolves objected someone else
so much the better shouted vavik
but a voice suggested leaving sturl in the church and thither we dragged him
we bound him meaning to let him lie on the floor
seeing him gnash with his teeth at the ropes about him and knowing him to be so supple that he might stretch to and gnaw through some we gagged him very firmly so that though he was raging at us the sounds he made were but as the hiss of the wind about the church
then he began to roll and to knock his head against the floor
we must make him fast to something said one of us
we stared around the church
there were no pillars there seemed nothing to lash sturl to
and then hrok nalti the chairmaker pointed to the stove
stand him on that
tie him to the pipe
we did so fetching a ladder and a high bench from the vestry
we pressed sturl against the pipe and bound him tightly to it and in a hard spirit for which we might be forgiven we bound him more than was necessary
we swathed and swathed him with rope until nearly all was used
with the last length since he made an attempt to beat his head against the pipe we bound that also passing the rope thrice across his brow and round the pipe thus forcing the back of his skull immovably against the iron
then we hastened to phyamu
you will have observed that i have said we in all this
it is right that i should as i was of the party
but the work as not the sort for a man with a fractured arm so that throughout i was an onlooker
justifiably or not i find relief in the knowledge of this
we hastened i said to phyamu
keeping together for no particular reason except that we arrived together late and telling none that we had captured sturl because we were jeered at for our tardiness we started to roll casks of oil into safety
i helped wdth one hand and time was passing when suddenly hrok straightened his back and flung out his arms stiffly uttering a queer gurgling groan
it is sunday morning he said
it took us not a second to realize his meaning
we saw sturl a figure of rope stiff and upright like some strange soldier on the stove in the church at raebrudafisk sturl incapable of movement incapable of sound save such as the wdnd was making
we saw the church door slowdy open and uflio stoneblind uflio appear
we saw him go to the vestry and emerge wdth fagots paper and coal
we saw him arrange the fuel in the stove utterly unconscious of sturl although his fingers would approach to within a few inches of the wretchs feet whenever he manipulated the flap at the top
we saw him bring a bottle of oil from his pocket soak the fuel and light it
and then we felt the sensations of sturl the terror which seized him as soon as he perceived hat was to come the leap oi hope which his heart would give hen uflio s hand came near him the frenzy of awful despair which beset him as he strained and strained to loosen a limb or to shift the gag with his tongue
we felt the first slight warmth to the soles of the feet
we felt the pipe against the back of the head and the slow sure heating of the pipe
we saw and felt all these things instantaneously as it were and far faster than we had run to phyamu we ran from it toward our church all except 
vavik who continued his work
no more
i said standing up
but kobyssu really as in the past now
he did not hear me and instead of walking out of earshot i remained dazed was speedy of leg said kobyssu and though i could swing only one arm i led the way with hrok
we were not certain what time it was we believed there was no chance of saving sturl yet in case there might be we tore along
our earliest glimpse of the church showed its smoke blowing from the ehimney
as to sturl having been discovered well presently we made out uflio sitting quietly by grave and the pastor and some of the womenfolk coming up through the firs from the village with no sign of excitement
still we ran ran through the churchyard ran to the church door
hrok opened it and the hot air from inside met me
there was a reek of smoldering hemp just like that of the string you allowed to smolder only much more powerful and following it was another reek stop i yelled and i shook kobvssu roughly by the shoulder
then i sat down feeling indubitably faint better give me a drink kobyssu i said might have stood it in print but to hear yori tell it you who were a witness and yet i said when i was recovering canot help referring to the matter once once only though
something strikes me as curious
you said that perception was uncanny
in that case i consider it strange that a palpitating human being should have been within six inches and he have no inkling of the fact obyssu who had gone white again toward the finish of the tale had brought a measure of brandy for himself and this he drained before replying will tell you he said a detail that was seen only by hrok and another who cut down the the remains and by me for hrok wiped the face very quickly
for a number of years sturl had borne on his left cheek a scar a large puckered scar that stood out from the rest of the flesh
sturl s face when ilrok lowered him was wrought on by the heat yet some peculiar marks were still visible on the left cheek
they were littl stripes apparently a mingling oil and coal dust such as might have been made by fingers of let us say a blind ron who sought by feeling for the sear to satisfy himself as to the identity of the man he had discovered on the stove
by lonesome here in the dawning sitting behind the bars watching a gray moon and gray sky and gray galactic stars lonesome waiting for footsteps coming along the row lonesomer than it ever was the morning to go
the scaffolds standing and ready the hammer quit last noon
and here i am with the gray stars and gray sky and gray moon
i can not express my feelings here in this cursed room listening to catch the footstep that sounds my coming doom
i can not express my feelings words couldnot tell them all
in this gray room in this gray dawn shadowed by this gray wall lonesome here in the dawning sitting behind the bars watching a gray moon and gray sky and the gray stars
her scream changed to a moan of agony
a the stilt legs of the nipathatched hut paul dakens looked down into a lagoon so clear that he could see the little painted fish scattering like sparks
behind him in the hut the little brown wife of phillips mourned her husband whose funeral orgies were already in progress with a prodigality of feasting and ceremony accorded a white man by the papuan blacks who had murdered him
dakens glanced at the woman huddled on the mats
at the head of the couch phillips pet monkey blinked solemnly as if he understood that his master would never return and felt the fear which dakens shared of those drums already tearing the forest gloom to tatters
the untimely death of phillips had left unfinished that work he had planned with dakens help of giving to the world their understanding of the natives unless dakens went on and he was afraid
the blacks who feared the magic tricks of phillips more than the sorcery of their own magician had none of that respect for dakens
in his heart he knew that he would in all probability be taken and tortured
phillips little brown wife had warned him had even offered to guide him through the tortuous lanes of jungle trees bedded in black water rank with the smell of walkabout grounds of crocodiles yet in her eyes limpid and dark as dew in the heart of a black orchid he had read hate and a desire for vengeance toward gwanoo the chieftain whom phillips had outwitted of a bride when he took the girl to his own hut
a week before phillips had gone with gwanoo on a pigsticking expedition
three days or rather nights later dakens had been wakened by the brown girls song of mourning nor could he laugh aside her fears
on the following morning gwanoo returned seated himself on the edge of this lagoon and beheaded phillips body preparing the head as a decora234 tive addition to his already fine collection
powerless to prevent dakens had been ill over it enduring three days of racking fear while the brown woman kept guard and he slept to dream of the head of his friend the red hair and bushy red beard
he wakened frenzied and hysteric each time and the brown woman plied him with palm wine a mistaken kindness as he knew
drink had the effect on dakens of leaving his body and flesh cold his brain alert and afire and the skill of the surgeon he had once been always turned him to his case of knives
behind his eyelids for three days and nights the head of phillips seemed urging him to vengeance not to glut cruelty phillips was too fine a man for that but that the fear of the white man might once more make it safe for dakens to stay on the lagoon and finish the notes for which both men had already sacrificed years
palm wine fermenting daily had not quieted his fear but it dulled his power to fight that mad dream of curing the head of gwanoo as he had mummied the head of phillips
the brown woman little dreaming the peril she loosed wakened and carried the jar of wine to dakens
he tilted back his head and drank thirstily
the monkey swung across the hut and crouched at his knees one small black paw on his wrist
dakens patted its head then pouring wine in his palm he let it drink
he heard the soft cry of protest from the woman and in sheer perversity gave the little beast a second drink of wine
in a few minutes it was swinging all over the hut then back to his lap where he caught and held it staring into its beady little eyes and strangely enough his gaze held the creature and between their eyes shone the dancing head of phillips
if i had your agility said da kens whimsically get it
the brown woman called the monkey in vain and she scolded dakens in quick angry native words
he had forgotten that she was jealous of the friendship between him and phillips forgotten that she was a comely little primitive whose lovely brown body shaped to feet with great prehensile toes not unlike those of the monkey
she was griefstricken as only a primitive can be and he realized a moment later that in her resentment at his giving wine to the beast she had suddenly cast off any feeling of allegiance for him
a moment later she snatched the monkey and plunged into the lagoon and was swimming through the clear water toward shore
dakens smiled
watching her brown body sleek and smooth as satin in the sungreen water he was conscious only of its symmetry the pleasing unity of muscular strength and the fact that she was running true to type a daughter of the jungle going back
she would he supposed return to gwanoo but he thought his own chances of escape vrere better than her chance for life if the sorcerer took her
for her own sake dakens wished she had not gone but the palm wine had cured him of the clutch and bite and twist of fear
he felt aloof primed for contemplative interest in forthcoming events knowing that if the black men stormed the hut he had his own gun and need not endure torture
the girl had reached shore
there she stood on a strip of dazzling white coral beach shining in brown loveliness against a mass of creamy hibiscus the heartsearching perfume of which came to his nostrils with the seatang
the monkey was in her arms and she whispered with red lips against its cheek caressing it with brown hands
and at that moment the jungle drums pulsed a quick staccato probed his brain with hot fingers of sound he heat and wine had made dakens drowsy and again he wished the girl had not gone
he dared not sleep without her keeping guard
he was afraid of this somnolence caressing his flesh stroking with languorous touch the strength from his body
the repeated drafts were hitting violently and presently ho rose found his case of surgical knives and began polishing them forcing his mind to memories of operations he had accomplished in days gone by
tli on as he turned his gaze toward the shore whence came the palpitant drumming quivering louder and faster as the funeral orgies got under way he saw a patch of sunlight piercing tree branches and falling in a circle of gold on the lagoon
in it little fish swarmed to snap at insects and dakens seemed to see again the head of phillips only now the eyes were open imploring urging him to action
he tried to fathom the meaning conscious that it was madness a spot of sunlit water alive with gaudy fish but the fantasy persisted
he went to the door still staring brushing his hand across his eyes and as wind stirred the palms the spot of light shifted toward shore and following it he saw a shining topaz gleam in the jungle the fire where hate and superstition danced in black ghoul shapes about the bier of the dead white man
he heard the song a savage sound of broken irritating rhythm a song so old that not even the singers understood its full significance a song that went with shoreless rivers and jungle trees rooted in black water stirred by scaled horrors with gaping jaws
the brown girl was gone
dakens shuddered to think what might be happening unless her comeliness earned a merciful death
he turned again to the spot on the lagoon but the sun had moved and the water was in shadow the little fish fluttering like scattered stars in a cool green sky
then the drumbeating was abruptly broken and a wild outcry ended the song
two paradise birds dancing in the tops of tall trees flew away from some disturbance
dakens forgot his fear
he was staring at the head of phillips hanging from a small black paw in a clump of dark foliage its luxurious beard stirred by the wind its lips tightsewn but seemingly puckered in a grim smile as if their owner enjoyed the joke he had found beyond the shore of life
dakens wanted to laugh with the head
the monkey which had loved phillips had stolen his head from the funeral wreaths of the village and swung through the trees
it leaped down from the branches and the brown girl sprang up from her hiding place to catch it in her arms
there was the sharp of an arrow and a cluster of falling flowers
the girl swayed a moment then caught the monkey and raced to the lagoon and was swimming
she as almost to the hut when the jungle belched black men
dakens snatched his gun and fired
a savage whirled and fell his lips at the lagoon ripples
the girl was swimming under water a brown undulating power which dakens longed to watch and dared not
a second and third shot cracked and the black men halted reluctant to change so soon their feast of flesh to an outflow of souls
the brown girl reached the hut and swarmed wdth incredible swiftness to its door while the blacks chattered in consultation on shore
dakens felt a wild elation at the crisis hurled upon him
this was better than brooding in the hut waiting for death
the girl was crooning over the monkey which whined in a small squeaky voice and caressing the head of phillips but dakens saw blood on her lips and knew she was wounded and presently the head oiled from her grasp to the mats and lay grinning at dakens through tightsewn lips as if it assured him that he was doing well
he would have given a year of life if he had the hope of so much to fathom the smile of those dead lips and guess what they would have advised
he was conscious of urging phillips to tell him what to do
he could not withstand a siege of the hut
sooner or later they would rash him and he needed time and bullets for the woman and himself
a grim respect for her courage thrilled him a part of his elation over the stand he made
she deserved a heroic end a shot that would send her soul to seek phillips who was waiting
dakens felt the presence of his friend
the head was no longer horrid it was as if phillips had come back
then on shore the mass of blacks paited and gwanoo stood on the coral a magnificent black giant strong white teeth flashing his headdress surmounted with swaying plumes of paradise scarlet flowers encircling his oiled body
and gwanoo boomed his parley
he demanded the head if that were returned he would take his men away to the feast
if it were not the murmur of the brown girls voice translated the promise of horror the death by ants by palm fiber by slicing slowly by being taken on lie crocodile walkabout grounds
dakens licked his dry lips
his mind called demanded of phillips how he should act if he must send on he girl phillips had loved and follow her and leave the notes garnered at such a cost to molder in the hut your job phillips he heard himself whispering you would trust gwanoo and he killed you
you trusted me and i donot know what to do phillips he was scarcely conscious that he spoke until the brown girl crept to his feet and murmured kill gwanoo marster kill gwanoo as he killed my white man
she had seized his gun and there was a sharp volley of shots a dozen leaping black men and three inert bodies across the twisting splendor that had been gwanoo then the others fled
dakens turned and seized the gourd and throwing back his head emptied the wine in great gasping gurgles down his own throat
he needed it
the respite would be brief
under cover of darkness they would return
but the moment the black men wore in the jungle the girl was in the lagoon
dakens saw her swimming back slowly weighted by the body of the sorcerer which she hauled up the steps and dragged in the door then she touched dakens arm and pointed
gwanoo still lived
in the girls eyes was a gleam of triumph
hating gwanoo as she did for the murder of her white man she showed the lust and greed of the primitive she was at this chance of inflicting on an enemy the torture she had seen him visit on others
dakens saw her daxt to the case of knives and seizing the largest sit on the floor and whet its blade on the sole of her foot then leaning toward the inert gwanoo she lifted the knife
dakens leaped and caught hei wrist
she was like a tiger in his grasp and only that she had been hurt he could not have kept her from murder
she twisted with uixbelievable strength and in the end turned her ferocity on him
he never knew how it happened but as she writhed and bit at him with her teeth there came a cry and she went limp the knifeblade thrust deep in her abdomen
her scream changed to a moan of agony
blood spurted oxi his hands and he staggered with her to the heaped mats where the little monkey huddled nursing the head of phillips rom that moment dakens lost track of events
the wine the strain of the last three days and nights the frenzied elation of killing and the sight of the lifeblood of the brown girl spilled on the couch combined to wrest reason from its throne
he went temporarily mad with a cool deadly insanity that turned from the stunned gwanoo to the dying woman
between them lay his case of knives
a little beyond were other precious things among them the highly prized jars of ether and chloroform
he worked with mad frenzy and dextrous surety of skill
the monkey fled to the farthest comer of the hut and hid
the whimpering of the little beast was the only audible sound through the afternoon
then the fumes of palm wine left him and tho ether cleared in the wind that comes at sunset and dakens saw and realized the work of his hands and he wanted to imitate the monkey crouch in utter darkness and hide
yet with night would come the horde of death from the jungle and having endured so much he wanted to make a last stand sell as dearly as he could the life of the man now roused from the mists of drink that had turned him madman
why he did not then turn the gun on gwanoo he never knew
it might have been that the monkey crept presently from the shadow and came close to gwanoo s body reaching a small black paw to touch the face of the black sorcerer
the little brown girl was dead her body wrapped in the mats but the stalwart gwanoo showed signs of life
one black hand with its heavy wristlets was lifted to the bandage about the brows
hearing a moan the monkey crept close and the fumbling hand found and fondled the little beast which snuggled in the curve of gwanoo s arm
dakens sat at the door of the hut more alert than at any time since phillips death and he tried to remember what he had done
the actions of the monkey puzzled him
it had been fond of the brown girl and phillips never very friendly with dakens yet it clung to the body of the savage sorcerer
dakens marveled at himself wondering why he had extracted the bullet from gwanoo s brain
it lay on the table beside a welter of something that he would not look at now that he was sober
for he had been very drunk
his hands his body and brain had been controlled by the demon which drink roused a demon this time that was that redhaired redbearded head on the mats
dakens reached out and took it on his knees
what was it that you made me do phillips he demanded of it
why did you return from that bourne youve reached and take the girl with you he realized that he talked like a maniac but he could not stop
was it for love of her the faithful little brown beauty or jealousy of me
you need not have feared that a white girl in a white mans land waiting for me and now i canot go back
his voice broke canot go back with bloodguilty hands
phillips i didnot deserve this treachery
i came with you stayed with you
if only you had not gone hunting with gwanoo wed have come out of this and gained honor
we had accomplished much we had sacrificed these years and our own honorable careers to catalogue these devils and now youve spoiled the chance of ever giving the results of that research to the world as i said you would do when you took the girl first
the sun dropping behind the dark line of palms cast shadow over the lagoon
the thunderous sunset of papua seemed to growl about its soft pantherhide of forest
in the jungle the drums were beating up the tempo of that old song and dakens was swept on that rhythm to an interlude in which the years of their lives in the jungle unfolded before his eyes and standing out from those het steaming months was the affection of phillips for the brown girl
he saw it now as the one fatal mistake which would eventually destroy all they had done
phillips had been mad about her
dying he would not rest until she was winging her way to his side
dakens came to believe it in that hour
the will of the dead man had taken a tortuous way to manifest its power but it was tangible audible as real to dakens as the breath on his lips
reason had no power to refute the thing
he no longer fought the thought
his whole body his mentality felt the will of phillips urging him to some task yet unfinished
then as if answering the question twisting mind the voice of gwanoo murmured water marster water
dakens leaped to his feet
this was no booming sound from the great throat of the sorcerer but a womans murmur the crooning words of the brown girl
he reached for the gourd of boiled and cooled water and held it to the thick lips
the eyes beneath the head bandage opened and it seemed to dakens they had the same soft sheen as the girls eyes the look of dew in the heart of a black orchid
take me my people my jungle it murmured again and again
dakens shook himself brushed his hand over his face pinched the flesh of his arms
stumbling from the restless movements of the reviving gwanoo his foot touched the head of phillips and snatching it up he would have placed it on the table but the hands of gwanoo reached and drew it beside him
the monkey roused and caught its claws in the red beard dakens threw up a hand to his lips to throttle the scream in his throat
the shadows deepened
the black papuan hills smoked against the furious crimson and amber of the sky
in another few minutes the light would die and night descend night and the batwinged fear that had held him prisoner for days a worse fear than before because the hut held unbelievable horror the body of the brown girl in the mats and the great gwanoo now reviving rapidly calling incessantly for water hugging the monkey and the head to its breast
that voice had power to bring dakens with the gourd and the last of his precious brandy mixed with water
it was as if he fed magic to one of those flowers which hindoo fakirs raise from a seed to bud and bloom in the space of a few minutes
it was like gwanoo s own magic that plucked an orchid from the air and had it turn to a snake
the sorcerer grew strong beyond belief
with staring eyes dakens saw him lean on one arm then sit upright still caressing the monkey and the head and the affection of the little animal was the most curious thing of all
dakens felt as if he were caught in a nightmare
then he was aware of the acceleration of the jungle song and drums
they were coming through the jungle coming through the night coming to the lagoon and they came for him
his scalp prickled
he stood at the hut doorwav dreading the darkness that held gwanoo and the head clutching mentally at the luminence of starlight on the lagoon water
he saw the blacks emerge thicker shadow in the gloom saw torches bloom and fire flash on knives and wreaths of white hibiscus splotched by scarlet flowers that looked like dried blood
the torch flare showed their betelstained teeth the bracelets of bone and metal the quivering headplumes
it was of no use to shoot at that mass better to reserve his bullets and strength for their rush
he kept his revolver so that he might thrust it at any moment in his mouth and fire
too late he wished he had dickered with gwanoo to have the notes that he and phillips had made sent out to a port
now they would be as much wasted as his life
the savages were in the lagoon water
on shore they had heaped their torches and the blaze lighted the clear depths where little fish flashed in scaled gold
dakens turned to the darkness of the hut and lifted the revolver
it touched his chin and crept toward his lips his scream startled the swimmers
from behind him the great arms of gwanoo caught and pinioned his wrists to his sides
he saw the torch flare from shore shining on the black face under the startling white gauze bandages saw the soft dark eyes shining heard the voice gentle as that of a woman not kill marster live an go out
frantic frenzied dakens twisted in that grasp
then the hut was filled with savages and the voice of gwanoo booming with its old strength commanded his warriors
dakens was held in the grip of savages while gwanoo leaning heavily on the shoulder of two black men looked down at an uncovered dead girl on the mats
dakens saw
his heart pounded in his throat as he appraised the work of his hands the neat surgery the delicate line of stitches under her hair
what what in heavens name had he done that day far far away memory throbbed tapped rustled a sheaf of pictures experiments at college transplanting the brains of one dog to the head of another he had skill at that his eyes turned to the table where gwanoo was lifting and dropping his surgical instruments into the black case closing it and gesturing to one of his men to carry it
something else lay there
dakens saw with a surgeons interest paramount the brain of gwanoo
he knew at least he felt the knowledge of what he had done for his mind was dragged over a trail without his own volition
he was scarcely aware that they swung him to their shoulders and swam with him through the lagoon
he saw on shore the giant gwanoo still leaning on the shoulders of his men but with the head of phillips clutched in one arm and the monkey perched on a shoulder beside the bandaged head of the sorcerer
then for dakens the lights went out wakened in a hut
dawn poured its soft light through the doorway
a soft murmur of women s voices droned through his dreams
the jungle song was stilled the drums silent
he heard the tinkle of shells fringing the hut of a chieftain stirred by the wind
the perfume of ylangylang wafted to his nostrils
rousing himself dakens saw women weaving flower garlands in the soft green shade of a jungle clearing and among them sat gwanoo but a gwanoo subtly changed from the savage sorcerer whose look had power to waken fear
gwanoo played with flowers
the little monkey sat on his knee
he leaned against a tree bole and above his flower and hair in a reath of fresh garlands hung phillips head
dakens looked about the hut saw his case of surgical instruments and the black metal box wrapped in oilskin which held his notes
then he tried to recall the nights in the hut the horror of the last day and looked again at gwanoo
the gauze bandage was gone
there was a scar across the broad forehead disappear240 ing into the hair
the eyes were not those piercing beadlike jets
the voice held the soft womantone
dakens sat up and his movement brought a woman into the hut
a moment later she had summoned gwanoo who entered and sat crosslegged beside dakens and handed him the box of notes
marster you sleep long time
one two ree moons you sleep
now you go out
go out
light leaped in dakens eyes warmth flooded his heart
gwanoo had given him a lease of life of mercy of hope
they fed him
the women massaged his body with lemonscented oil as they had done for many days
they imparted the strength of their hands to his flesh and healed him
gwanoo kept guard a gwanoo changed a gwanoo womangentle
the village of nipathatched huts was strangely devoid of men
he learned from their talk that the warriors were hunting the contraband paradise plumes and would be gone many days and that he was to be sent out before their return
dakens had lain for three months bereft of reason nursed by the commands of gwanoo and at last he understood
gwanoo s brain was left in the lagoon hut
the brain of the brown girl inhabited the head of the sorcerer
yet before he left dakens carried the case of knives that were the instruments of this magic to where a long war canoe nosed the blackshadowed lianas looped above the jungle stream and dropped it into the depths
never again would he use his surgeons skill for very fear of its cunning
returning he stood before the head of phillips and saluted
he spoke not a word
the tightsewn lips still grinned at the joke of it all
dakens had one regret as he stepped into the canoe and looked for the last time on the magnificent gwanoo with the soft eyes of the bride of phillips that he would never know how the thing would end whether the warrior body of the sorcerer would in time absorb the womanbrain or the woman weaken the warrior
it seemed a pity he could not watch that phase but in a white mans land a white girl waited and there were the notes to work on and give to the world the most interesting of which could not be included in a precise and scholarly treatise such as he and phillips had planned
the paddles dipped
the throats of black men took up the jungle song and floating under the dark trees dakens looked his last at the grinning tightsewn lips of his friend of phillips who had engineered so curiously the release of dakens
ahead the dark water stirred and a crocodile rose and opened wide jaws and showed its curved wicked fangs but dakens only smiled
nothing had power to startle him now
he had come through surer deaths guarded and protected by greater power than his owm with keener cunning and more subtle wit
it was like the phillips he had known
phillips would have loved to tell such a tale
in the memory of dakens he would always be grinning tightlipped a flowerwreathed greatly prized head
a short tale about an egyptian magician the unearthly by was astonished at what his friend had proposed to do and attempted to put him right j see here jerry i can tell you that youll only be making a fool of yourself
i happened to be present at that affair at the crawfords and i saw the thing with my own eyes
it may as you say be unearthly but i saw it jerry newman laughed at his friends fears
you think you saw it he said ironically
howard shrugged expressively
then if i canot dissuade you i suppose i may as well accede to your request
thursday night voir said
jerry nodded shortly
yes heard so blooming much about that prowess that i am determined to put an end to his fame once and for all
i met him the other day and as i have already told you i told him to his face that he was a faker of the worst kind and that without his preparations made he couldnot duplicate his feat
in other words that in a room selected by myself and at a time named by me he could not do what he did at the crawfords
and i wagered an even five thousand dollars that he would fail under the conditions i have named face showed his concern going a bit strong jerry
laugh if you wish but i tell you that i saw the thing with my own eyes and i was looking for flaws at the time
the egyptian mohamet ali w will most certainly win your five thousand
jerry newman waved his friends objections aside
your arguments are beside the matter at hand he said given me permission to use your studio next thursday night and i shall inform mohamet ali only at the last minute of the scene of his performance which will make it virtually impossible for him to arrange any properties or stage effects
it is my contention that without any prearrangements the egyptian will fail
the other shrugged again as though to wash his hands of the matter
he had seen mohamet ali hursday evening came and with the darkening of the skies a group of jerry closest friends gathered in studio
some of them had like jim howard been present at the demonstration at the crawfords and all of them were certain that their friend was to lose his wager eyes do not lie you know what one had seen one had seen
a few minutes after the last of the group had arrived the door opened to admit newman closely following him came the egyptian a lean swarthy yet rather handsomelooking fellow for all his swarthiness
at the heels trotted an urchin who was quite evidently either an egyptian as was mohamet ali or an arab think that you have met most of these gentlemen said jerry indicating the small gathering asked them to be present as witnesses
quite naturally one would wish witnesses murmured mohamet ali politely a smile touching his mouth
jerry newman bowed
billy weaver is the stakeholder as you know and the wager is to be paid immediately upon a satisfactory or pardon me unsatisfactory conclusion of your feat
and now we may as well the egyptian bowed
at your convenience sirs he said
if you will arrange yourselves the group gathered in a semicircle
and then as the egyptian drew the urchin close to him and advanced to the center of the improvised stage an almost blindingly intense bluewhite light illuminated the room
from overhead came a soft fluttering a faint hissing as the huge photographic lights settled down to a steady glare pardon me for not informing you that the lights were to be turned on mohamet ali jerry newman spoke up almost forgotten them
you see he went on disarmingly the room is quite gloomy and well you are quite aware of the fact that i am looking for trickery on your part
this studio you see belongs to friend howard who is a photographic illustrator for several magazines and the cooperhewitts are used to light his sets
as you may see for yourself they illuminate every nook and corner of the studio and well tonight your every move will be clearly visible
as you will the egyptian acceded smilingly
from somewhere about his person he drew a short uglylooking sword and a small ball of twine
the sword he laid upon the floor
now gentlemen if you will follow me closely with the words he grasped the end of the twine and tossed the ball upward quickly
a gasp went up from the little audience as they saw the twine seemingly vanish through one of the great skylights indeed the skylight seemed to have vanished for they could see out into the heavens
overhead the rolling evening clouds passed in stately array and into them the twine disappeared
at a word from the egyptian the small boy clutched the twine in his hands and began climbing upward
the astonished jerry gazed openmouthed as the urchin wriggled and squirmed his way up that twine continuing on until he too was swept from sight by the lowhanging clouds
mohamet ali stood at the base of that slender ladder to the heavens
after a moment he called out come down the twine wiggled a bit as though the urchin had commenced his downward flight then all movement ceased
mohamet ali was incensed
come dovm he shouted
come down he listened intently as if for an answer
none came
frowning ferociously quite obviously enraged at the boys refusal to obey him the egyptian stoopefl and seized the sword
spawn of shaitan he snarled grasping the twine in his brown hands
and then he too climbed upward
chin sagging jerry newsman watched the egyptian follow the urchin into the clouds
then the twine began to sway to and fro violently
from above came eird shrieks shrill implorings for mercy then they were drowned out by the lover tones of the voice snarling vicious
an unearthly scream split asunder the silence in the room below a scream that set on edge each nerve in the bodies of the watchers
drops of blood spattered on the carpet and a moment later an arm fell thudding to the floor
it was small slender darkskinned
it was the urchin s arm followed another cry and the other arm struck sickeningly beside the first
then before the horrified eyes of the beholders in quick succession they saw the urchins feet his dismembered legs his head and then the bloody torso striking before them then from above mohamet ali came slipping down the twine
he landed lightly on his feet beside the horrible disarray
he would not obey me he said simply as he glanced about him upon the gathering
as if that ended the matter he extended his foot and kicked the dismembered body into a pile
the twine he grasped and giving it a jerk so that it fell into his hands rolled it up compactly
then glancing about he seized a large rug from the floor and quickly threw the severed pieces of the body into it
gathering the four corners he lifted the horrible burden and thmv it at the feet of the men who were watching him
the rug thudded on the floor unfolded and the urchin miraculously made whole again leaped lightly to his feet and salaamed deeply
that is all i think mohamet ali said easily chorus of told you sos dinned into jerry ears
you wouldnot believe jerry and its cost you exactly five thousand dollars
a sly grin touched lips havenot lost as yet he said slowly
the egyptian s brows lifted
did you not see with your own eyes sir
newman nodded
quite right mohamet ali
i did see with my own eyes but my eyes are not infallible you know and so i brought along an eye with me that doesn t lie smiled into the astounded faces of the little group
all right harrison he called loudly
a door at the farther end of the room opened and a wiry cigarettesmoking individual stalked into the room
in his hands he held a square black wooden box perhaps six inches across seen some wild things mr newman in my line of work but this thing tonight surely had me going for a while he grinned
turning to the scowling mohamet ali jerry new man explained this gentleman is mr harrison one of the worldwide motionpicture cameramen
i obtained his services for the evening with an idea in view to photograph your every action
perhaps now youll comprehend my reason for choosing studio with its cooperhewitt photographic lights
mr harrison has been shooting your feat through a small hole in the wall from the adjoining room
and if as i believe your demonstration has been a fake the truthtelling cameraeye will prove it have this roll of film developed tonight and printed and in the morning well run the picture in some projection room
perhaps mohamet ali you will think that i have taken advantage of you but i warned you that i was a thorough skeptic and you should have been on guard
and now i think there is nothing more until we gather tomorrow morning to witness what mr harrison has filmed
the egyptian smiled charmingly
no apologies necessary i assure you mr newman
one doesnot relinquish five thousand dollars without having as you westerners say a run for his money
he beamed upon the motionpicture cameraman
and you mr harrison in that little black box yon hold an absolute proof of exactly every move my assistant and myself have made
quite remarkable the egyptian took the little black box into his hands
idly curious in manner he carried it to the nearest light as if to survey it more closely
and somehow his foot caught in a rug and he stumbled
the black box fell with a erash to the floor and a creamywhite roll of film cascaded profusely from its confines
really mohamet ali gasped i must apologize for my clumsiness
he stooped as though to gather up the film
that stuffs no good now shouted the cameraman
the light has ruined it
how terribly awkward of me murmured the egyptian
billy weaver left the group and facing mohamet ali and jerry newman waved two certified checks
i do with these now he queried
jerry face was a mask as he bowed to the egyptian
give them to mohamet ali he said evenly and presently he was watching a magician an assistant one sword and two certified ehecks for five thousand dollars each vanishing through the doorway

old meg she was a gipsy and lived upon the moors her bed it was the brown heath turf and her house was out of doors
her apples were swart blackberries her currants pods o broom her wine was dew of the wild white rose her book a churchyard tomb
her brothers were the craggy hills
her sisters larehen trees alone with her great family she lived as she did please
no breakfast had she many a morn no dinner many a noon and stead of supper she would stare full hard against the moon
but every mom of woodbine fresh she made her garlanding and every night the dark glen yew she wove and she would sing
and with her fingers old and brown she plaited mats o rushes and gave them to the cottagers she met among the bushes
old meg was brave as margaret queen and tall as amazon an old red blanket cloak she wore a chip hat had she on
god rest her aged bones somewhere she died full long agone
bullets had failed and i was at the mercy of those leering horrors
i looking back at the little village of kraanstaadt
from the height it looked more than ever like a fairytale village with its high peaked roofs and winding streets of stones
even for that picturesque land of the hartz mountains it was delightful a very masterpiece and the grim old castle that brooded in silence over it might well have housed an ogre or some sleeping princess
strange little land of fairytale
the very place that gave rise to so many stories of the little people living in its same tenor of ways and filled with ancient customs that made one instinctively gaze into the sky for winged dragons flying carpets or even witches on broomsticks
the people were as superstitious as ever was mortal race
they had begged me not to tramp the road to kraanstaadt and had held up their hands in horror over my insisting on taking the trail through the woods
no no mine host of the tavern had cried be not so foolish for the woods are filled with awful things
and his wife dear old soul had clung to my arm with tears
but i was not to be turned from my course of action
the walk would take the better part of a day in the deep woods and give me even a better appetite than i already possessed
besides this was the land of romance and for one was not to be cheated of that
to their arguments therefore turned a deaf ear and prepared to go
the good wife finally pressed upon me a crucifix and in order not to hurt her feelings i put its cord about my neck and the cross i buttoned under my shirt
i could feel it theie now and what was more to my liking could also feel the heavy under my armpit
i was curious as to whether a werewolf might bow to the cross but not a bit doubtful as to whether his animal brother would respect the leaden pellets from the heavy gun
so protected both physically and spiritually i stood and looked down upon the little village and then turning i plunged into the wooded trail
i tramped until midday and then at a crossroads perhaps i should say erosstrails i sat down and ate the lunch i had brought with me
the crosstrails marked the half of my journey and a few more hours would find me looking down on my destination
i lit my pipe and finally with regret i left the delightful spot and took the trail to the left as i had been directed
the other was overgrown with weeds and i made a promise in my heart that some day it would be explored
tramping along i let myself be lulled by the soft forest air and in my mind i pictured these strange woods dark and forbidding as they were with the actors of childish stories halfremembered
surely along the tiny trail ahead of me were walking the children the lost babies and the old witch s cabin would soon come in sight eagerly i looked for the gnomes and dwarfs and once a crackling in the brush brought me about to scan the forest for the sign of the wolf of red riding hood fame
soon i left the trail and sat down by a tree
soothed by the hum of insect life and the days heat i soon fell asleep
it was late afternoon when i sprang up and gazed at my surroundings
angered at myself i at once made for the path and turned down it for i knew now that my sluggish sleep had made me late and i was in no eager mood to be left wandering in woods i did not know through the evening and darker night
hurriedly i paced the path with no more thought of the elfin folk with which my fancy had peopled the woods earlier in the day
it was cold now a biting wind had sprung up and dusk had begun to fall silently about me a fact that accelerated my speed in an endeavor to keep warm
the path ran and wound among the trees and in the growing darkness these lost their charm and instead of hidden princes changed by the wave of a witch s wand into towering forest giants they seemed more like the hideous monsters of some forgotten era waiting to pounce on the unwary traveler who strayed from the path
it seemed too that behind me another presence paced and glancing behind me in the growing dusk i saw a white object melt into the trees on my right
slowly i picked my way glancing about me as i went and was soon rewarded by seeing it again for a moment as it slipped between some tree trunks
then i stepped across a little glade and drawing my revolver slipped behind a tree trunk and waited
a few seconds passed and there stepped into view a monstrous white wolf that stalked across the tiny space
i fired the deepening dusk being lit by an orange flame as my revolver spat lead and the beast raced into the trees with a snarl that told me of a hit scored
but it hung grimly on for several times i saw it glide through the trees although owing to its caution i was unable to get another chance to shoot
then suddenly the path was crossed by another
i swore in my anger for mine host had told me there was only one plaee where the trail was bisected by anything
still here was another path well worn by the passing feet of a multitude for many years bigger and broader than the one i followed
suddenly the question arose in my mind had i in my first few seconds of wakefulness retraced my steps
with this in view i examined the broad path before me and then turned to look at the one down which i had come
the darkness however had so covered the ground that it had ished and look as i might about me i could not discover it
a moaning creak drew my attention from the ground to the air above my head and i started back with an exclamation
there only a few feet from me was erected a gibbet and upon it swung a dead man
the wind which was rising rapidly swung him to and fro like a pendulum and the rope moaned and complained
so intent had i been upon the path that i had not noticed it until that moment
poor fellow i reflected had he perchance left loving arms and eyes that wept behind him or had he faced the world alone
guilty or innocent had he faced death bravely or gone whimpering to the great beyond or had he cursed those who hung him
a rustle from his shoulder and two little red eyes glaring at me turned me away shuddering
crows birds of evil omen followers of executions
an old poem i had heard in my boyhood days came back to me out of the annals of years we shall sit on his breast on his broad manly breast and pick his eyes out one by one
i shuddered and turned down the broader path
surely the old customs of ancient days survived here if nowhere else
hanging a man at the crossroads
my thoughts were brought back to earth by the cracking of brash to my right
evidently the wolf was still there moon rose over the forest and the clouds raced across the face of it in the rising gale
they took odd shapes one was shaped like a coffin another took the form of some belated specter hurrying to keep some dark tryst on a ruined castles battlements and one remember that very well changed its shape into a skull with the moons pale rays glaring through the empty sockets
the shadows flung on the ground by the passage of these clouds also had dire and forebidding outlines
the entire scene was in keeping with the tales of the hartz mountains of ghosts and hobgoblins sheeted specters and hooded horrors and all the evil spawn of hell that ran through the tales of ancient germany
i hurried onward hoping at every curve or at the top of every hill to catch the lights of the little town shining upon me but instead the dark forest continued on and on and hemmed in my path
several hours must have passed this way and it was very close to midnight when i saw shining through the trees a light to the right of the path
here was shelter from the coming storm crude and homely shelter no doubt but shelter for all of its crudeness and with a lightened heart i hurried toward it
as i approached a broader beam of light showed that someone had entered or left and as i met no one along the pathway as i hurried up i concluded the person had entered
to my wonder on approaching i found the unmistakable outlines of an inn
how very good it looked i pictured the warmth and coziness of the great room within for i was cold and chilled by the night air
i paused with my hand on the doorknob and looked at the crazy little signboard overhead
the moon came out from behind the clouds and sent a broad ray across it and there arranged in two rows of three each with a larger one in the center were seven skulls
after the events of the night i was somewhat shaken by the sight of those seven little emblems of mortality that grinned down upon me in their deathly mirth but as the rain was beginning to come down in torrents i shrugged my shoulders and went in
mine host might have his gruesome little joke but his fire was what i craved now and if it was good why the sign would be perhaps the center of a tale about the roaring fireplace
slamming the door against the wind that pushed with a thousand tiny hands as though demanding admittance i stood inside and blinked the rain and darkness out of my eyes
the great fire roared up the fireplace lighting the room with a vivid fitful glow and showing me the contours of the several guests that were gathered near it
ordinary peasants and foresters they all seemed to be and mine host in white apron and cap came smiling toward me
welcome mine friend he said in a throaty whisper the storm is indeed a bad one and you are very fortunate to have made my door
while thanking him for his offers of assistance and hospitality i looked at him carefully
his throat i noticed was wrapped with a heavy white cloth sure sign of a bad cold and this explained his queer way of speaking
his eyes protruded fearfully from his face a sign of inward goiter so i had heard but altogether he was such a kindlyappearing person that i followed him with thankful heart to the fires warmth the others making room for me
food there was none so i must perforce content myself with the remains of my lunch to mine hosts utter sorrow
however as he brought me some really good rhine wine i could not object
his explanation was that this time of year his guests were scarce yet for several days he had had such an influx that he was eaten out of house and home
as i had plenty of food left over i did not object and i was telling him not to worry himself when a scratching began at the door
the tavernkeeper crossed to it hurriedly and swung it wide admitting as he did so the great white wolf that had stalked me through the woods
my dear little girl he cried thou art overly late
surely i have been very lonesome without thee
my dog mein herr he continued in explanation
savage to some yes but to me very gentle
he stroked the great white head lifted to him
but what is this he cried
ach my little darling has been wounded in the shoulder see mein herr see how the blood has run
ah those charcoalburners with their guns
nothing is safe nothing
and he ran for warm water and towels to bathe the wound
i believed it better to keep silent as to my share in the episode and sat watching him
the beast whimpered and cried and then when her masters back was turned she swung upon me her red eyes filled with hate and anger
i loosened the pistol in its holster for dog or no dog the great creature would die did it rush me
however it went to the fires opposite side as soon as the wound was dressed and there stretched out at full length in the heat
my frugal repast being now finished i fell to studying the different travelers at the inn
there seemed something odd about them that i was at first unable to place
then it dawned upon me the costumes even in this very old world they seemed out of date
the costumes of a century or two ago i was delighted
this was romance i could not see their feet on account of the shadows but i pictured them as being incased in long hose running to trunks and surely those capes in the corner were of a pattern ah you sleep came the innkeepers voice
you are tired then
come let me show you to your room mine guest
it was true indeed that soothed by the soft gutturals and the fires glow i must have slept so i allowed him to light a candle and show me up the narrow stairs in the back of the great room to my bedroom rain had ceased but the clouds still ran across the moon drawing weird and fantastic shadows across the ground
underneath me i could hear the voices and an occasional creak from the crazy sign
i bolted my door and sat by the window watching their queer designs
sleep seemed to have left me and the room was bitterly cold yet i did not mind either of these things so engrossed had i become in the wild night scene without
suddenly a scratch came at the bedroom door bringing my thoughts back with a snap to the present
the great white wolf or dog had followed me
i sprang up and made sure of the doorfastening and at the soimd of my footsteps it padded away limpingly
poor beast
i was sorry i had shot it now but i had no inclination to explain matters especially in that narrow room
i went back to the windows and stood looking out
suddenly the candle behind me started to go out
with an impatient oath i turned about
the keeper had evidently given me a very short one as he thought i would soon be asleep i thought
but no the candle was still quite long and yet it was dying slowly as if for want of oxygen
lower and lower went the light and then suddenly flickered and went out
quickly i struck a match and went toward the candle but dropped the match when something seized my arm
at almost the same instant something else seized my leg and then i was grasped by numberless little hands ill the dark
how can i describe that fight in the narrow room
i was filled with disgust and loathing as well as horror
little creatures they appeared to be that tried to bear me down by weight of numbers
i sent my fist into faces and felt teeth loosen under the driving blows hurled some from me and heard them strike with crashing force against the sides of the room and i cracked skulls with the butt end of my revolver
still i was forced back and back for their number seemed legion and then weak and worn out i was forced to the bed and bent back and back until i was flung upon it
my shirt was torn open in the struggle and i bled from a number of tiny wounds yet still i fought grimly on with horror in my mind horror of these unseen foemen
as my back touched the bed the moon sprang out from behind a cloud and lay in a broad beam across me
the tiny silver cross caught and reflected the rays and suddenly as it had commenced the attack was withdrawn my foemen vanished if you can call people who were never not even in the moonlight visible vanished and slowly as i lay spent and panting on the bed the candle began to glow and finally sprang into life
slowly i staggered to my feet and stumbled toward the door seeking the companionship of those below
under my feet i fell bodies bodies perfectly invisible to me even in the lamplight
it never occurred to me until later that those below should have heard the row going on over their heads or that even the dullest ears should have detected the uproar to which the smashed and broken furniture gave testimony in that narrow room
with weakened steps i made my way down the dim hall and narrow stairs and at the last turn i saw with a glad heart the great room leap into sight
mine host
i cried mine host but then after i descended the few remaining steps with a rush my words choked in my throat and i staggered to the wall where i stood in horror
the room was lit by a red glow that seemed to have no source
the fire or for that matter any fire ever built my man could not have made the awful glaring red that filled the entire room
it seared and burned into the brain bringing out every detail with startling distinctness and the travelers who now swung slowly around to face me were not human
the faces were the faces of those long dead dead that lived the undead of a century long past
those clothes were the doublets and liosen of long ago long wicked swords hung at sides the faces
ah the faces were skulls skulls picked clean and white by the graveworm in moldering tombs
only the sockets were filled with that reddish glare of hell that pervaded the entire room
the innkeepers eyes still protruded from his sockets but the bandage of a few hours earlier was gone and his neck was twisted and broken the face was that of a newly hung man with the horror of death still upon it
under my horrorstricken scrutiny the lineaments changed and it became a skull a horrid grinning skull like the others only the twisted neck remaining awry and the vertebra showing jagged beneath the leering deathmask
a growl brought my terrorfilled eyes to the white wolf that sat by the fire
slowly it stood up on its hind legs like a trained animal and then hellish and terrible a transformation took place
the body grew to a greater height the long cruel snout vanished the beastlike properties were slowly banished one by one and human lines took their places until a girl stood glaring at me
a girl a demon from hells darkest pits with eyes of reddish hate a werewolf one of the truly undead
i crouched in my corner as the awful faces turned toward me and drew my weapon
the werewolf moved toward me its right arm dangling and then i sent shot after shot into the throng to no avail
bullets had failed and i was at the mercy of these leering horrors
in fear and horror i ran my hand up my bosom toward my throat and felt beneath my trembling fingers the tiny cross
swiftly i tore my shirt open and held the emblem toward them as i cried back back you fiends
evil i fear not the wolf recoiled and the faces of the others turned toward each other as though in whispered consultation
so death took council while a madman waving a silver cross faced his ranks
slowly they arose and came toward me and formed a hideous circle in front of me
the things had decided i suppose to frighten me into dropping the little cross and then i felt my senses going my hand was trembling and dark little motes began dancing before my eyes the walls reeled about me and the only solid substance in the universe was that leering crowd of deathmasks with the white hatefilled face of the fiend in girlish form that ringed me in
the red light seemed to glow and then to fade as i fought for the mastery of my mind a white glow flooded the scene somewhere i seemed to hear a cock crow and then as fell i heard a shriek as of some baffled fiend who hears the fall of a curtain of safety between it and the victim upon which its claws have been so nearly laid ate afternoon had come when i i i opened my eyes and found myself on a rude cot in entirely different surroundings
an old man whose face was kindly rose from the fire and came toward me with some gruel in his hands
drink this and sleep he said yon are in safe hands at last my friend
for several days i tarried with the charcoalburner and his stalwart son in the rude little shelter they called home and drew from them the tale of the inn and its occupants that i now set down
for years the inn had lain on a welltraveled thoroughfare in the hartz mountains and well along in the sixteenth century had been the stopping place for many a noble and knight
then karl the terrible had bought it and gathered about him a crew of murderers and slayers
he was credited with having traffic with the devil and his only sister had surpassed him in all evil finally becoming so the story ran a werewolf
travelers were murdered by his creatures and their bodies hidden in the cellar
tales of screams and cries were circulated until it came at length to the baron of the district one hoerlarin of kraanstaadt
he at length with a goodly gathering of and knights had one day suddenly appeared at the inn and captured karl and his men
the sister had escaped
the trial had been swift and sure for very little digging brought the bones in the cellar to light
punishment had followed as swiftly
the many followers had been tied to the beds of the inn and burned alive in its conflagration karl was taken to the crossroads and hung so that all might see and fear but the sister was never found
the road fell into disuse even as the great castle at kraanstaadt had crumbled and become dark
yet the ruins of the inn blackened and seared by the purging fire still contained evil qualities and there night after night had gathered the evil crew for ghastly carousals body swung at the old crossroads until moonrise when he descended and joined his old companions and often the white form of a werewolf was seen as it slipped between the tree trunks toward the den of hell
in the blackened ruins i had been found for the shots of the night before had been heard and investigated by the two charcoalburners
perhaps i dreamed the horror perhaps the people of the hartz mountains are merely superstitious yokels who frighten themselves with needless tales of horror perhaps you the reader of this tale will smile but i wonder what made my hair turn white and why the little marks of claws upon my body have never left for one have never gone back to that haunted area and i place my faith upon the beliefs of the strange peasants of the hartz mountains
a tale of the olga boatmen by paviloff russia may algernon downes esq st james row london england mr downes i am writing to let you know that i am resigning my position as foreman of the men working on the dam here at paviloff
my reason for so doing is a most unusual one indeed and no doubt you will feel obliged to discredit it nor can i blame you for doing so for even i am tempted to disregard the indubitable evidence of my own senses so bizarre are the events that have led up to this culmination of my efforts here
let me assure you had i known of what i was facing at the outset of this project should never have entered upon any contract with you
on the twentyfourth of february last your representative mr solar hamilton of oxford arrived to confer with mr randeur and myself on the building of the dam across the volga at this point
present at this meeting as a professor sergei bourskymaminoff late of the university of moscow and a former pupil of metchnikoff
he was here to represent the peasants of paviloff and the surrounding country
professor bourskymaminofif related the story of peculiar superstitions strongly believed by the peasants and he admitted that he also believed in them owing he said to certain curious happenings bordering directly on these superstitions
mr randeur scoffed at him mr hamilton enjoyed himself immensely throughout the professors entire relation but these tales of his had an odd effect upon me from the beginning
it seems that the peasants believe the volga river is guarded by spirits who will rise up against us if we attempt to stay the course of the river in any manner
you will say as did randeur that the idea is utterly preposterous
i admit that it does sound preposterous
professor warned us repeatedly to go and leave the river but randeur could not consider the idea
finally the professor departed in anger
i endeavored to argue with randeur and hamilton but both of them ridiculed me
at length mr hamilton left saying as he ent that if i did not wish to stay he would see that another man would be sent to fill the vacancy
please notify mr hamilton to supply that other man
god knows what prompted randeur to do so rash a thing but he built his cottage on a little knoll almost directly in the course of the river
everyone feared that if the dam should suddenly go out randeur s cottage would go out with it
one day not long ago the twentyseventh of april to be exact as professor bourskymaminoff stood on this knoll rebuking randeur for his rash act and again warning him to watch for the river spirits a most repulsive hunchback approached the two men screaming at the top of his voice the boatmen sing tonight
the boatmen sing tonight
this in itself was an odd occurrence but it developed that the hunchback was quite mad and so randeur again scoffed at what the professor said
the boatmen that the hunchback referred to are the fj hosts of those slavish men or rather halfmen halfbeasts who were treated as animals by the nobility of russia the men forced to pull the heavily laden boats of the nobility up the volga
there are no such boatmen now although they still existed in randeur questioned professor bourskymaminoff and he learned that the peasants believed that whenever the boatmen sing it is a sign of death
the professor told randeur that their singing had never failed to bring death
of course you can well imagine what an effect this had on randeur none at all
he waved it away but on the following day randolph smith our best patrolman apparently accidentally fell from the framework at the extreme outer edge of the dam into the swirling current below and was whisked away in the space of a moment
i say apparently because we do not know
randeur was stunned for a moment but he blamed it upon coincidence
however he endeavored to keep it from professor bourskymaminoff but the professor heard of it and came directly to randeur and again implored him to cease his task
but randeur would hear none of it
last night while the professor was speaking to our manager the hunchback came again shrieking his unearthly warning
and even as he spoke the professor paled and muttered that he too heard them chanting in the distance and we looked at the river but there was nothing there
and today mr downes the entire left end of the dam has gone out the stronger side wiped out completely
and the men have all quit but randeur is still there he is going to build that dam he says hoping that you will soon find a man to fill the unfortunate vacancy left by me i remain very cordially and sincerely yours nemo lawlor andeur saw the last of his men leave him and he moved angrily toward the cottage
he sat there some time mumbling over his charts and plans
after a while he came out and looked about him up at the remainder of the dam and at the river flow ing by as peacefully as ever and at the sky to see if there were any signs of storm but the sky was clear and away in the distance in the purple haze about the mountains the full moon was rising
and he looked toward the town and there he saw what he dreaded to see the dark figure of the mad hunchback moving toward him over the sand
he stood very quietly until the figure came up to him
his eyes were wide with excitement and his straggly hair framed a pockmarked face his huge distended nose squatted above his thin bloodless lips like a vulture over some halfdevoured corpse his lips opened and closed as he came and his three remaining teeth were displayed in their rotting gums his clothes were dirty ragged and he wore neither shoes nor stockings
the ungainly hump on his back stuck out prominently
he spoke in a nervous frenzy of fury
the boatmen chant again tonight
do you hear them
death is in the air
death and the river seethes in anger and it will rise against you tonight
and you are alone in the path of the river death randeur cursed him and raised his hand in a threatening gesture
the hunchback sped away and as he ran he shouted and randeur heard the ominous cry echo far jn the distance
death
death
death
and a harsh laugh sounded after it and randeur shuddered
it was fifteen minutes past by random s watch when it started
randeur did not notice the splashing of the waves until after some time had passed
then suddenly a shutter banged against the side of the cottage and he started up from his blueprints and peered anxiously out into the night
the full moon rode high in the sky and there was not even a fleece in the blue as far as he could see
but the shutter had banged he had heard it
and even as he looked wonderingly out the shutter banged against the housewall for the second time and immediately after another shutter banged and another and another until randeur rushed madly for the door but before he reached it it was flung violently open
he halted for a moment then ran out and turning looked fearfully back at the accursed cottage
but now all was silent the shutters sagged listlessly on their illfastened hinges and the door stood half open
there was no hint of a breeze the night was oppressively hot
he stared at the cottage until some inner sense beating upon his mind turned his head slowly toward the river
and there he saw a multitude of white shapes indistinguishable fantastic ominous
and as he looked at them moving slowly up the river toward the dam he became conscious of a loud sound as of the beating of the waves and he saw the river rise and swell and a thousand white foamy waves lashed the air in fury
and from some far point in the distance came the low sound of a hymn
randeur listened terrorstricken
and as he stared at the white shapes almost at the dam his ears seemed to open and he heard in mighty chorus upward onward we are one
randeur clapped his hands over his ears so that he might not hear that presentiment of death the song of the volga boatmen but the toilers mocked his efforts and raised their voices and sang louder louder louder
and the waves rose higher and higher and the song increased in volume and randeur stood rooted to the ground upon the knoll on which he had foolishly supposed himself to be safe
suddenly that same inner sense turned his head upward so that he could see the right side of the dam and he saw it crumble and vanish in the upheaval of water that followed
and it seemed as if his eyes were suddenly opened for he saw the spirits of the river pushing the water toward him and he saw too the moon shining tranquilly down upon the seething waters before he closed his eyes in a vain effort to shut out the scenes before him
and he heard the song of the boatmen rising and falling ominous terrible upward onward we are one sound did i hear during the might but the river has avenged itself for the wrong that has been done to it
the professor pointed to the jagged spar that was caught in the crotch of a giant willow that stood upon the knoll where a cottage had once been
it is all that is left of everything that has been here
death has come and gone
and from somewhere in back of the crowd of peasants that gazed in silent awe upon the calm river came the voice of the mad hunchback in wild echo to the professor death death death
it was the mad hunchback who found randeur two days later far down the river among the reeds and rushes that grew thickly there
randeur s bloated face told of the ghastly things he had seen his bloodless lips were parted and tightly drawn his hair was torn as if in a frenzy of despair and his widely opened eyes stared upward in mute nameless horror
strange power had this belt of human skin the girdle by pool of mottled light on the tabletop had drifted over to where sir elawlike fingers emerging from the silk sleeve of his dressing robe drummed slowly on the black oak
carson erect on the hearth rug had ignored the chair indicated by the fingers and was filled with a sudden resentment as he sensed the indifferent weariness of their tapping
and this old man was father
it was all so different than he had pictured
there as no fathoming the expression of that masklike face with its impenetrable stare settled in the cushioned depths of the wheel chair
the heels of boots came together with a suggestion of military stiffness and he spoke curtly confess i donot understand
and his host replied in a curiously dry voice it is not altogether necessary that you should
the words carried a studied courtesy but their veiled irony was not lost on the officer
granted
but pelham was my friend if he was your son and i am here only because he asked of course interrupted sir john
spare me the formula if you will dead
it was arranged you should come and tell me how well he died
he was to perform the same service for you no doubt had the circumstances been reversed
the pelhams always die well in the breed
if you insist however carson choked back his resentment
there were circumstances that make it seem necessary and yet pray get on
then make it short
carson advanced a little nearer the table
it was in a little hut i last saw him alive
enemy ground newly occupied it was and here was this hut in a small clearing
it might have been a woodcutters and it was empty save for some heavier furniture
several of us were poking about its one room then pel started up a crazy ladder at one end leading to a small loft
i heard him moving around and scratching matches then he was quiet
i walked over near the ladder and hailed him
nothing up here but an old chest he came back and empty at that
then i heard him laugh
somebody left me a dutch sam browne thought the cursed thing was a snake felt cold heard the lid of the chest fall then pel started down into the room he turned and faced me
he had the end of a belt in each hand holding it behind him as if he were going to wear it
i didnot notice that though
all i saw was his face the way he looked
the way he looked prompted sir john as the younger man stared at him soberly
and pray how did he look
carson seemed to pull himself together with an effort exactly what i have to tell you try to
he seated himself on the edge of the table one booted foot swinging nervously
why it was his eyes i think yes thats what it was
there was something in them that shouldnot ever be in a mans eyes seen a dog that was vicious and a coward all at the same time
he wants to go at your throat and something holds him for the moment
he drew a long breath
it was like that he decided
sir john was watching one of his visitors hands it had gripped the edge of the table and the knuckles were white
the boot was motionless tense
as you say like a dog
well
at the quiet words the younger man relaxed
yes sir he agreed gratefully
then spoke to him and he never answered
he came on down the ladder slowly still facing us
the others were drawing up behind me i could feel them
we all watched pel
it wasnot that he just moved slowly either it was something different
slinking
i think thats the way to say it
and he watched us never blinked
no one said a word
when feet hit the floor he began moving toward the door it had come shut
he backed to it and began feeling for the latch with one hand holding the belt all the time
he kicked the door open with his heel
then i knew we were losing him if you can understand what i mean knew hed got to be saved from something voice was curiously strained wanted to stop him i tell you i did want to
i tried
i started for him
and the belt interposed sir john quietly
the belt echoed the other man dully
oh yes
he held it all the while i just told you that
but he escaped
he did
i had scarcely moved
he gave a dreadful sort of cry and leaped out of th doorway backward
we rushed it then
but he had made the trees and we could hear him crashing through the undergrowth as though there hadnot been a boche within a hundred miles of us how he went he heavy silence that followed was broken only by a coal falling in the grate
with a long sigh carson raised his head
he fumbled a pack of cigarettes thrust one between his lips but made no move to light it am waiting came the voice from the chair
waiting
come come
you tell me my son is dead
if i recollect you mentioned gallantry
so far you have suggested desertion
the details
oh yes
the details
but you wonot believe them
one would have to have seen
have the kindness
sir john leaned back wearily among his cushions and closed his eyes
well
it was the third evening after that i think it was the third
there had been an advance a lot of machinegun ork
it was growing dark i remember
harvey my sergeant came up and asked if he could speak to me seen lieutenant pelham he whispered queerlv dead
i said
i knew he was dead
yes lies dead sir says harvey but theres something queer about him
will you have a look
he led the way and i followed voice was becoming strained again
sir john leaned forward and stared steadily into his eyes
we came to a little open place
there was some light there enough to see the dreadfullest group god ever bunched in one place first of all i saw pel sitting with his back against a little tree chin on his knees
he was staring straight to the front dead
but around him
five german infantrymen dead too
dragged into a sort of semicircle
and they werenot shot and they werenot gassed nothing like that
everyone had his throat tom
torn
carson leaned close to the old man his voice shrilled as he demanded almost piteously you hear me canot you they would be torn said sir john pelham very quietly
finish your story
the officer pulled himself together with an effort
it makes it easier having you understand seen men he thrust the fingers of one hand into the collar of his tunic as though it choked him seen men sir meet death in a thousand ways but not not that way
and pel wasnot marked at all i looked
the father leaned forward in his chair but the gesture of interest was not reflected in his impassive face
what of the belt
he wasnot wearing it but the thing was there lying at his feet
and it was coiled show it to me
why i yes i took it
i donot know why
i dropped it in my kit bag next day i got mine just out of the hospital by a month
otherwise have been here sooner
with an unexpected clutch at the wheels of his chair sir john was close to the table one white hand extended
give it me
an instant s hesitation then carson slowly pulled a paperwrapped object from his pocket laid it easily on the table in there he muttered donot like tle damned thing
with deft fingers the baionet loosened the paper shook the contents on the table
therfe lay the leathern belt coiled compactly
in the waning light it was of a pale brown color thin and very flexible
on the other end was a metal clasp its surface cut with marks that might or might not have been characters
there was a reading lens lying near and sir john used it to study the coiled strap
he examined it grimly from many angles without once touching it
finished he leaned back in his chair and thoughtfully tapped the palm of his hand with the lens
captain carson
sir
attend most carefully to what i say follow my instructions exactly
take that belt in one hand only
carry it to the hearth lay it directly on the coals
when it is burned quite burned you may tell me
carson got slowly to his feet
with a hand that hesitated and was none too steady he reached for the coiled belt lifted it a few inches from the table
at his touch seemingly the coil loosened it started to unroll
he caught at it with both hands
for a fraction of a second his body seemed caught in a strained tension
then he began backing away from the table noiselessly furtively
with an end of the belt in each hand he shifted his eyes to sir john and they glowed with a strange sinister light
from his sagging jaw came his tongue licking
screaming an oath sir john pelham flung the reading lens with all his frail strength full into that distorted face
drop it he bawled savagely
jarvis
at the call an elderly manservant came hurrying
he saw his master supporting himself on the arms of the chair trembling with the exertion and staring curiously at the uniformed visitor
carson was swaying unsteadily one hand pressed against his face blood trickling from between his fingers
at his feet lay the belt and the shattered lens
jarvis saw all this and took his post near sir john waiting his orders
jarvis
yes sir said the manservant evenly
sir john sank back wearily
the tongs jarvis
fetch the tongs
pick up that strap
only the tongs mind you donot touch it with your hands
so
now lay it on the coals hold it down hard
the three watched the burning in deep silence watched the belt writhe and twist in the heat scorch with flame fall in charred fragments
jarvis
yes sir
lights then brandy for our guest
you may bring things and patch that cut for him
to carson sit down man and pull yourself together
i regret i was obliged to strike you but under the circumstances you will agree it was quite necessary i think donot understand muttered carson dully
he slumped weakly into a nearby chair
i felt i donot know
his voice trailed off his chin sagged on his breast
you donot wish to eat by any chance what made you ask that
god no
i couldnot cat i only but jarvis was offering him the brandy
none for me said sir john shortly
but you may help me over to the far case i am looking for a book
i a few moments jarvis had wheeled him back to the table and he was leafing the pages of a small book he had found
it as bound in parchment and bore evidence of great age
carson shiveringly helped himself to another drink as his host turned the crackling pages until he found what he sought
tracing the lines with a lean forefinger he read silently for a moment then looked shrewdly at his guest
this may interest you captain
read here and he indicated the place
carson slowly deciphered the strange script of the handprinted page another means wherethrough men have become werewolves is that they in som mannere gotten a belt or girdel maked of human skin
by an autentvke eronicle a yoman hadde such a girdel which he kept locken in a eheste secrely
it so felle on a day that he let the eheste unlocken and his ittel sono getteth the girdel and girteth his midel with it
in a minute the childe was transmewed into a mervilously wilde beste but the yoman fortuned to enter the house and with spede he remewed the girdel and so cured his sone who sayde he remembered naught save a ravissing apepetyt
the book slipped from nerveless fingers he stared into sir impassive face
when he could find the words god
you never mean you couldnot mean was in hopes mused the old man you know i was quite in hopes you would feel hungry
here are the final chapters of the star shell by and the story so far arry williams mark dexter and prince danda singh are catapulted to jupiter in spaceship the star shell through the treachery of professor norden
after terrific adventures in the forest of the great red weed they are rescued from the midst of the barbarian hordes that are trying to overrun jupiter and taken by civilized men of jupiter in a jovian airship toward nadir which is besieged by barbarian hordes armed with the green fire
rp battle said that means delius that your pie have taken our advice and intend to fight for their lives in real earnest
glad to hear it
but we are not glad solitarians
the slaughter will be great a necessity it is true but a most painful and sorrowful one
yet the queen has decided upon instant and unstinted action and those elders who attended her council have approved her decision
within an hour of her landing in nadir the order was given and our forces set in motion but not until we were despatched to your aid
we wirelessed you but received no response
things are moving rapidly to the great crisis of our history
though the barbarians will have to go without megalof they are led by skilled generals and are in overpowering numbers and they intend to force the passage of the isthmus of cardiac even at the cost of countless lives
once they are masters of that strip of land between our two greatest continents our civilized cities and plains right up to the defenses of the ridged hills are at their mercy
ostrong who would have us retire to the hills at once has been asked to resign from the council
resign
only that and nothing more
i cried
the old scoundrel ought at least to be given penal servitude
delius shook his head calmly donot know exactly what penal servitude is but it is doubtless something dreadful
we do not share your ideas of revenge remember
wo have virtually dismissed ostrong from authority but more than that we can not do
he acted according to his own judgment and we think he was wrong and thats the end of it
a man of his proud spirit will suffer greatly from his sense of failure
you jovians are the limit said all the same i shall be very much surprized from what i saw of mr ostrong if this is the end of it
i think there is quite a lot of natural earthly malice about the old bird
about the isthmus put in mark
you people by virtue of the heat ray are supreme on the water though you donot use it much you sweep the isthmus from both sides with rays from sea vessels the shores can keep that way but the effective range of the blue ray is too short to reach halfway across the neck of land
and the barbarians have lately used some great engines for throwing stones and baskets of flowing green fire re259 plied oberon
machines on the lever and spring principle
by these things they have sunk some of our sea fleet and even destroyed one of our airships
sounds interesting said mark yawning
but me for a good sleep
wake me when we get there
dandy and i were just as sleepy and while the airship sped on over forest and sea and plain flying straight as an arrow to its mark we went off into deep slumber
after our experiences in malador after a spell of short days and nights it was quite easy
we were becoming used to the unusual hardened to anything
they oke us when nadir was in sight and the two vessels were sw ooping clown to the landing area in the city of spires
we had crossed the isthmus and the belt of smoking conflict
as our speed slackened we threw open the doors and the busy sounds of life came up to us the purr of traffic the songs of fearless birds
and with the sounds when we landed came the faint sweet perfume of flowers and blossoming fruit
if they donot fight for this they deserve all they are likely to get was my unspoken comment
delius smiled
it is very easy to read some kinds of thought he observed
have no fear for us now that the queen has assumed command
your advice too will be readily welcomed more especially since you risked your lives in saving her
you will find our elders and scientists eager to work with you
it may be as our wisest teachers are saying that you strangers from another planet have been sent by the great power of the universe to preserve our race in its horn of peril
steady with the bouquets
i protested
we have only handed you common sense
and here we are
we stepped out of the ship to meet a quiet wellbehaved but nevertheless very eager ciowd of jovian dignitaries and officers among whom was the queen
every few minutes swift motor vehicles laden with recharged rayprojectors dashed out of the city to the battle line fifty miles away
already solitarians said queen briseis looking rather tenderly at mark i fancied we have acted upon some of your ideas and hints
our war cars are holding back the barbarians and our warships of the water and air are attacking them
within the last hour some of our chemists have manufactured an explosive mixture that acts upon concussion
a hundred of what you call bombs are now ready and thousands of our skilled workers are producing more
you shall see the fight for yourselves for your presence will encourage our forces against the reckless bravery of the enemy
so after muchneeded refreshment and a bath in aromatic water from the municipal supply we boarded an aerial warship for the isthmus
our vessel carried a couple ef heat ray projectors and fifty of the new shells
it like old times is said prince danda
we might almost be back on earth setting out in airships to upon the foe drop bombs
it very homelike is a few minutes we were hovering above the isthmus of cardiac hanging high in air surveying the scene through the transparent metal walls of our vessel
we were looking down upon the greatest battle in all the history of jupiter
it was a strange sight
the isthmus was a narrow neck of land between two great continents and two great oceans
to east and west stretched land to north and south as far as the eye could see a glittering expanse of water
across this narrow portant strip the fight raged
from eastward poured the barbarians a surging flood of rough sinewy primitively armed humanity
the westward end of the isthmus was held by the civilized jovians equipped with weapons far superior but in numbers far less
it wasnot a bit like france or flanders or the dardanelles
there were no lines of trenches no dugouts no shellholes no wire entanglements no bursting shells no humming airplanes
there were rows of isolated forts rows of low white domes from each of which flashed the deadly blue rays
against and between these domed forts the flood of barbarians pressed
they were reckless to the verge of frenzy flung themselves forward as though perfectly careless of life
already behind their front lay three rows of the forts captured or destroyed and only two rows remained
green fire smoked all across the isthmus was carried forward by thousands of men in little braziers was hurled at the forts by huge catapults
in and out of the line of forts assisting their effect dashed the warcars opposing the blue ray to the green fire
from each side of the isthmus sea vessels kept the shores elear and airships armed like our own save for the bombs swooped low plowing lanes of death across the savage hordes with their burning rays
but though the advancing barbarians fell by thousands tens of thousands pushed the front ranks on
never have they fought like this before said delius who had come with us
they are enraged that we are withstanding them so stubbornly after their many victories
if we can not hold them back till the frenzy passes i fear we are lost
your race is paying for its past weakness said mark
you have given way before them so often that they have come to think themselves invincible
anyhow we will try the effect of our sort of fighting now i said
put us across the isthmus slowly delius
just as i spoke a whirling mass of fire shot from a gigantic throwingmachine caught one of the lowswooping airships
the shock caused the vessel to turn turtle and she fell to the ground green flames curling round her
we are too high for that danger but not too high to avenge the loss cried dandy hurling out the first bomb
ah that most surprizing is
we had not yet witnessed the effect of the new explosive nor were we prepared for the result of the jovian chemists first venture though we knew its action would have to be strong to overcome the greater gravitation of the big planet
it was strong
there was first a blinding flash of light that seemed to scorch our eyes then a huge upheaval of the ground a volcanic burst of smoke and then a quiver of the air a roar of noise that shook the airship in every bolt and plate and made our eardrums throb with intense agony
and when the smoke cloud blew away in the gale there was a shellhole big enough to bury a dozen houses
hundreds of dead barbarians lay around the edge of the jagged pit and three of the catapults were smashed to fragments
it knocks into a cocked hat
i shouted
this stuff will win the war
but it is terrible awful nerveracking said delius shuddering and closing his eyes
the butchery the slaughter
it is now or never their lives or yours civilization or barbarism said mark
ready harry
then overboard with the steel pills dose one every ten minutes
let go and across the isthmus we sailed dropping down our rain of death we crossed the isthmus of cardiac dropping our bombs into the smoking battle line and before the last shell had torn up the tortured ground the battle was won
civilization had triumphed on jupiter at last
after the sudden scare of the first explosion the barbarians rallied gamely rushing forward more frantically than before shooting flights of arrows into the sky in vain rage but they could not stand the repeated shocks
their lines broken their catapults destroyed hundreds of them blown to bits with every shellburst and the swooping airships sweeping the fierce blue rays over them ceaselessly they gave way at last lost their nerve and throwing down their weapons as they went trampling underfoot the officers who would have stayed them ran away in headlong panic
the eivilized jovians roused for once to energetic action pursued the struggling hordes by air and land and we dropped our last bomb in the thickest part of the beaten mob
then we went back for another supply and dropped fifty more shells amongst the routed savages
at least it ought to have been fifty counting them i only made it fortynine
when the pursuit eeased the bar barians had been driven wholly elear of the disputed neck of land
the isthmus of cardiac was safe in eivilized keeping aixd the city nadir the lovely city of sweet gardens and tapering spires was once more secure
my story of the next few days must be rather short and serappv
it isnot so easy to live all the time in the limelight so to speak and its rather embarrassing to sing ones own praises even at second hand
as i said one evening when we three were alone for a few minutes snakes and tigers mark
we are now and forever the big noise here
if we werenot extremely modest and the jovians werenot really civilized our heads would be bulging like balloons and if wo weneaat kept so busy as well harry
i know you two are about sick of it all and ready for home but you will have to grin and bear with your jovian and s a little longer
for one thing as jupiter and the earth have moved in their orbits since we arrived they are not in a good position for the return journey
if we start at a wrong time or in too great a hurry we might not be able to stop or to reach the earth we might drop into the sun and be frizzled up
and there is norden to consider
he is a problem
he says he wonot return and we can hardly compel him
nor caii we leave him here
then there is our work the completion of the isthmus defenses the casting of the big guns the starting of the smallarms factory
besides all this simply reveling in interesting discoveries soaking up science from our learned friends
and you must admit that they are making us very comfortable
especially the queen i grinned
wed if you want to stay here we certainly canot go without you
all the same the novelty is wearing off and we are feeling a bit homesick for the earth
these folks are all right in their way they can t do too much for us because we happened to come along and give them a helping hand but after all we are out of our element here
we have not tasted meat for a week nor had a smoke nor seen a policeman nor read a newspaper nor played any sort of game
when you blow the engine whistle markie boy we shall have our tickets ready
norden is indeed a problem remarked prince danda
it me annoys that he is at liberty as well as old ostrong
they much together are and often with the barbarian prisoners are confabbing
they plan mischief i much fear plain the old chap has never forgiven us for bucking up his race to fight and win said he would rather stick to the old tradition that it is more civilized to die in innocence than to live in forcible triumph
we must watch him
but what can he do or norden either asked mark
we didnot know we couldnot imagine
we were destined to find out later to what depths of evil a perverted virtue may descend
in the meantime we had a feast of enjoyable experiences even while we cast longing thoughts across the black void to the distant little planet of our birth the twinkling little star we saw but now and then in the evening twilight through brief rifts in the heavy clouds that enwrapped giant jupiter
though the jovians were so extremely scientific and civilized their home lives were simple
they had very little personal luxury and during the whole of our stay on the planet we never saw any signs of poverty amongst our hosts
everyone worked at something everyone seemed to have enough to eat drink and wear and the public services of lighting heating water supply transport sanitation and amusement were wonderfully efficient
strikes were unknown
i have told you of their naturalcolor pictures
we were shown marvelous glimpses of scenery on the scene and later in their express airships we were shown the scenery itself
i could write pages and pages of description of the lovely river valleys the sandy shores and rocky coasts the ranges of forestclad hills the vast deserts the regions of bubbling geysers and fiery volcanos that diversified the surface of jupiter but you might not be as interested in the reading of them as we were in seeing them
even we grew tired of travel of sightseeing and presently we had something else to think about
delius took mark aside one evening very mysteriously and after they had had a long conversation my chum came over to dandy and me looking rather red in the face
wc didnot need to put our question into words shall have to tell you two what delius has been saying poor old mark jerked out so i may as well get it over about the queen and ostrong and me
it seems old ostrong had his eyes on the queen thought he was going to marry her in fact
she turned him down of course being a sensible woman
the mischief is that she has taken a fancy to you instead and you donot altogether dislike the idea i finished for him afraid thats the size of it admitted mark
at least as to the first item
you can leave me out of this if you please
it puts us in an awkward position has his knife into us now for more reasons than one
we ought to be off home before the mischief goes any farther for even
i well even if i wanted to marry briseis the things impossible
she is much older than i am the difference between our races is enormous and the council would not allow it
they have actually had meetings and discussed the whole business in all its bearings
ugh cheer up old pal i said
it isnot everybody who jumps several hundred million miles to find his queen
it is hard lines not to be allowed to become a king but i agree with our friends that the idea is preposterous
fact is we had better leave
that also do i think added prince danda
my people in india will for me be looking soon have told delius we shall go said mark with a sigh
the star shell is quite repaired ready fitted and fully provisioned
as i told you a few days ago it is the positions of the earth and jupiter that do not make the journey suitable or safe at present
i am going into the details with their astronomical experts tomorrow
it may be necessary to wait a couple of months for the chance of starting the trip with any degree of certainty
we had to let it go at that but the thought was disturbing and not one of us slept well that night guest house that had been placed at our disposal was a nice little bungalow sort of building in the suburbs of nadir where after darkness fell there as scarcely a sound to break the restful peace of the night
in the long sleeping apartment we each had hammocks in curtained recesses
i had dozed off for the third time when a sudden tapping at the metal window roused me with a jerk
i pressed the switch that made the metal sheets transparent and another that flooded the big room with light
professor norden was at the window beckoning apparently in a state of considerable excitement
i threw on a few rags roused the others and let him in
no time to lose if you want to help he cried anxiously going to destroy it destroy what norden who asked mark roughly
the fellow had kept out of our way persistently since our return from matador and the red forest
the shell
the star shell the professor shouted in a sort of frenzy
ostrong
wanted me to assist him
afterward he was going to give you another spaceship one that would come to grief when on the way back to earth
he has some of the prisoners helping him
i couldnot do it so i came to warn you
quick i have a car waiting
better telephone the authorities fiist i suggested
i have already done so cried the professor
come there is no time to waste
half asleep yet and taken off our guard by his manner we rushed out of the house and followed norden into the auto
a swift run through dark and silent avenues brought us to the aerial landing ground the professor talking fast and furiously all the way
he was a clever scoundrel
as we stepped out of the auto at the base of the star shell we thought we were ready for any emergency
we expected to find a fight going on between the aero guards and barbarian prisoners
all was quiet black and still and eery as night but as our feet touched the ground a swarm of dark figures rose up and materialized out of every dense shadow
in a few minutes in spite of our struggles we were all helpless in the grasp of sinewy barbarians
an increasing crowd of the menacing prisoners gathered round
from another car which had followed ours ostrong stepped alone
the glare of the solitary electric lamp that lit the open space gleamed oddly on his mop of silvergray hair
he smiled grimly and lost no time getting to the point
you aie indeed wonderful beings solitarians but the end of your interference has come at last
you have misled my people
you have demoralized their moral nature in order to gain for them a material advantage
if you remain alive we may indeed conquer the whole of our planet but our race would lose its soul would cease to be truly civilized
you must die and perhaps my influence may yet prevail
prisoners do your work
our captors pushed us toward the star shell norden with us in spite of his protests and struggles
they crowded upon us each man carrying a block of some dark substance
whilst some held us rigidly others built up these blocks into a roughly circular wall around both us and the shell
the wall grew as if by magic built by hundreds of willing hands
soon it was up to our waists and then those who were holding us freed themselves and vaulted over
we could not follow for everywhere we met the points of swords and spears
and still in silence and semidarkness the wall grew
norden shouted angry questions but no one answered him the idea ostrong asked mark quietly
it is quite simple solitarian was the old mans reply
this wall is built of blocks of the green metal collected from the battlefield by the prisoners at my suggestion
presently we shall set it blazing and soon after sunrise nothing will remain of you and your spaceship but a heap of smoldering embers
there is no escape you can receive no help why am i here screamed the professor in terrified rage am no friend of these others
i have not helped them i have helped you in all your plans
but for me you would not have lured them here so easily
let me come out let me out shut up you miserable bounder said you have been a tool for the old villain and now he has no further use for you all
you speak truly solitarian observed ostrong smiling
one uses dangerous tools at times but one throws them away afterward
i have quite done with mr norden
jupiter will be well rid of you all
and of me especially elder added mark though i doubt whether the queen will tolerate your existence after this night
at any rate stranger she will never look at you again was the vindictive reply of the old man
light the fires barbarians
you will be revenged on the worst enemies of your race and i shall see the end of those who would corrupt the soul of my people
light the fires in a few minutes they will be beyond all help even if the whole city be roused to try and save them
light the fires
those were the last words we heard spoken by an inhabitant of jupiter
the crowd of barbarians had gone about their work eagerly but grimly silent and in the same grim silence they kindled sparks and set the green metal blazing in a score of places
with lightning rapidity the flames spread curling in bright green waves over the encircling wall pouring in greet cascades between the loosely piled blocks
volumes of green smoke rose lazily to the dark sky
we were cut off from everything by a ring of smoke and flame
pale green tongues of fire came reaching inward licking up the dry herbage greedily stretching out toward us and the shell
the affair was well planned well carried out
before long we knew from what we had seen of the radioflaming of the green metal everything within that terrible circle would be utterly consumed
we had better jump through it and die fighting said in desperation
that i think also said dandy am ready
norden in a frenzy of sheer terror groveled on the ground at the base of the shell moaning and groaning
we took no notice of him
there is a better way out though it is a risky one said mark
ostrong did not calculate everything
into the shell with you all
it was now getting so uncomfortably hot and the smoke so pungent that we lost no time hopping up the stairs
mark was the last
on the threshold of the doorway lie stopped
we canot leave norden down there you chaps can we
he will have to come along and take his chance with us
so back we went for the professor all of us coughing with the smoke and smarting from the rain of sparks that swirled around us
norden was not grateful he was too scared to move
when we insisted he yelled screamed cried that the star shell was a deathtrap struggled like a madman
finally i gave him a tap on the head to keep him quiet and we carried him bodily up the steps
just at the top he recovered had another fit and fought us with the ferocity of a wild beast
as fast as he got an ami or a leg at liberty he clung to the doorway like a limpet
and all the time we wrestled with him the ring of green fire grew hotter the flames higher
at last we forced him in and whilst dandy and i held him down mark closed the airtight double doors
tt was like shutting ourselves in an oven
we canot delay our start very long said mark mopping his brow or we shall be cooked alive
all the same we canot start just yet
why not we asked
because we must wait for sunrise
supposing we started in the dark we should be going right away from home flying out into the awful void of outer space beyond the orbit of jupiter
no we must wait till the sun comes up
if our glass windows can stand the heat without cracking said whew
if we can stand it
dandy his brown skin glistening with perspiration kept a tight lip
professor norden still in the grip of fear went on groaning
mark studied his registers
he announced that we had enough air in the cylinders for the long trip no more no margin for much delay
the shell grew hotter more stifling
the windows were squares of leaping and flickering green radiance
the padding of the inner walls was uncomfortably warm to the touch
i began to feel dizzy sickly limp as a boiled rag
it wonot bcr dawn for twenty minutes said mark consulting his watch
the metal of the shell must be nearly redhot now
it will be a race against time a race between the rising temperature and the rising sun
before the shell reaches white heat we must go at any risk
be ready
the horror of that next twenty minutes will remain in my memory as long as i live
often on hot summer nights i wake up bathed in perspiration crying out to mark to let her go
to the subdued murmur of the encircling fire was now suddenly added a few faint fresh sounds and now and then mingling with the leaping green glare came stray flashes of blue light
we knew what that meant
the fire had been seen in the city and the queen had sent to our assistance
our attackers were themselves being attacked
but i am afraid it is too late said mark
we shall not be able to stay much longer
if the thermometer rises ten more degrees i shall cut off the gravitation of jupiter and then it may be goodbye to the giant planet forever
ten degrees groaned dandy
already i cooked am
i was too far gone to utter a word
we waited lying about in helpless misery
only mark upheld by his clear brain and strong will kept on his feet
his hands rested on the fateful little levers that would hurl the star shell into the black abyss between the worlds he had eyes only for the thermometer and the wateh on the table before him
the sun is rising he cried at last
you canot see it for the heavy clouds but i know its there
a little longer so that it may get higher in the sky and then we are off
seven degrees
i had no sensations save for a fieree craving for a breath of cool fresh air
nine degrees said mark warningly
at that moment with a wild yell professor norden sprang to his feet and rushed to the door throwing his weight on the opening lever
air
air he shouted
let me have air
hold him you two cried mark
keep him fast
we are off
it is wonderful how you can find strength and activity in a crisis
we collared norden and hung on to him like leeches
he fought with the ferocity of a wildcat but after a terrible two minutes we pulled him away from the door and got him down
then we tied him hands and feet
and as we got up panting exhausted mark pushed over the starting lever
once more owing to professor norden the star shell was shot into space at an unchosen moment
an extra blast of heat grilled up a roar of sound engulfed us we seemed pressed into the floor by tons of weight and then in a deathly silence a silence as sudden as the outbreak of the tempest of sound we all fainted clean away
the star shell had left jupiter had passed through that heavy atmosphere was out in the vacancy of space was shooting with a velocity unthinkable sunward and earthward
but would our journeys end be the fiery cauldron of the glowing sun or the dear familiar planet of our birth thoroughly bruised sha ken and trembling stiff and sore all over we came to our senses one by one the star shell was millions of miles away from jupiter
the vast globe of the skv was deepblack crusted with the manycolored stars and circled with the shining band of the milky way
below us shone jupiter already dwindling in size and above us glowed the sun glaring unshadedly across the terrible void
mark consulting his indicators shook his head
when i cut off the gravitation of jupiter he said the etheric pull drove us away from the planet
now we arc going in his direction the attraction of the sun himself is increasing our velocity
the pointer on the dial is again invisible
how many million miles an hour we are going i can not even guess
seems to me you will have to slip in the reverse clutch then i ventured
put on pull again and try to slow down before we overshoot our mark
i don t want to explore the sun
i have seen quite enough of the solar system to satisfy my curiosity for a long time have already done that harry and yet we got such a flying start that the speed doesnot seem to be checked at all
we must be halfway across the zone of the asteroids already and you had better pray we donot hit one
and theres mars to westward and theres the earth and its moon
one thing i am pleased with we are heading more nearly straight for home than i dared to expect
then nothing is there that we can do but wait asked prince danda singh
nothing
later i shall be able to tell you more definitely what our chances are
better let norden loose now he wonot be likely to do any more harm
we untied the treacherous professor and helped him to his feet
he was white with fear and the first symptoms of spacesickness were gripping him
he smiled weakly sorry gentlemen he said been a very poor sort of friend but i beg you to believe that i am sorry
i must have been mad
let bygones be bygones
we shall trust you as far as we can see you and not an inch farther norden said when we get back if ever we get back there must be a reckoning with you
and then the pangs and nausea of spacesickness claimed us all for awhile and we forgot everything else in the deadly agony of that indescribable malady
when hours later it passed and we began to recover we had reached the orbit of mars
the needle was showing as a quivering blur on the indicator dial
another nine or ten hours at gradually lessening speed should see us somewhere near the earth and our fate would be decided
now that we were nearing home my thoughts went back rather longingly rather regretfully to the giant planet we had been obliged to leave so suddenly
in spite of our hairraising experiences there i felt a sense of loss a twinge of sorrow at departure
i should have liked to see more of that wonderful world of vast continents and silvery seas of dense clouds and terrific storms
i found now that i had left them that i had grown to like its civilized people their gentleness their good nature their marvelous science
i wanted to know how the long fight between them and the barbarians would go on in the years to come
above all i wanted to see the city nadir again to look on its forest of tapering spires its smooth roads busy with traffic its gay gardens gorgeous with flowers and bloom sweet with scent and musical with the songs of fearless birds
it was some slight satisfaction indeed to remember that we had been helpful in the war that we had rescued queen briseis from the hands of megalof and that the battle of the isthmus had been fought and won
if we reached the earth safely i said to myself it would almost be worth while trying to make the great journey again
almost
at last came the critical moment
we gathered round mark who had his hands on the controlling levers
he had to check our speed by cutting off and putting on in turns the attractions of the earth and moon and sun and so endeavor to bring the shell into the atmosphere at the right angle think we shall do it but it will be touch and go with us said mark have her down to a few thousand miles an hour and i hope to dive into the air in the same direction as the rotation of the earth
that will lessen the jar for us as a fielder you know in catching a fast one lets his hands travel the same way as the ball
where shall we land asked norden strangely meek
impossible to say replied mark
we are approaching the night side of the hold on all of you
a few more minutes will settle everything for us
we are dropping fast
no yes the speed is falling
hurrah
we are home
the star shell plunged into the atmosphere as he spoke
the scream of its passage nearly deafened us the heat caused by the swift friction gave us another turkish bath
but the resistance of the air quickly reduced our speed and it was quite gently that we dropped into the sea
we knew we had fallen into the sea for our progress was suddenly stopped and a froth of boiling water heated by the glowing metal walls of the shell hissed all around us
then we went up again on the rebound and after a few more plunges the great projectile lay rolling on the surface aimlessly as a floating cork
seized in the grip of some strong force it was carried forward turning over and over grounded raspingly was lifted again and left motionless at last above low water mark
a constant noise like the regular booming of heavy guns filled our ears
the door happened to be uppermost
we flung it open eagerly and crawled out upon the top of the shell
one glance told us where we had hit the homeward trail
tim shell lay on the coral shore of a tiny atoll
the sound we heard was the roar of the surf on the bar
we have fallen on a pacific island said mark
uninhabited apparently
i shall have to take our bearings and see if we are anywhere near a regular steamer route
the island was in shape like a broken hoop
it was a ring of coral rock interrupted in one place only a curve of coral and yellow sand fringed with palms
here and there thickening out it bore clusters of tropical trees
on the bar where the ring was broken the surf boiled and roared and all along the outer edge of the reef the heavy pacific swell boomed and crashed incessantly
within the reef lay the lagoon a blue lake of still water calm as a pond
it was a picture an artists dream
might have been a worse place for landing said you have done fine mark
you might have dropped us in the middle of africa or at the north pole
it will do us good to have a lazy holiday here
mark didnot seem very enthusiastic
it looks pretty enough harry but it may be hundreds of miles out of the beaten track
we may not see a ship for months years
and we have to see if there is a spring on the island or whether the vegetation depends on the rain
we made the circuit of the atoll from the gap in the reef to the other side of it and back again
we found coconut palms and a few stunted breadfruit trees but not a trace of water
not even a drop of moisture lay in the hollows of the coral rocks above high tide
taking our position as well as he could with the instruments in his possession mark announced that he feared we were at least a hundred miles from any regular steamer route
snakes and tigers said the middle of africa would have been better after all
this is about as bad a fix as we have been in yet
marooned on a solitary atoll without a boat and with nothing to drink when we have finished our supply of ater from jupiter wish i had never seen you nor your accursed invention cried norden
nobody asked you to join us professor said mark in a chilly tone
go away and grouch by yourself if you want to keep out of trouble
although the outlook was black enough we three after what we had gone through were not easily depressed
it was indeed rather difficult standing on that treefringed curve of rock and sand between the thunder of the surf and the calm of the lagoon bathed in sunshine under a sky of flawless blue to give way to complete despair
but when three days passed without a drop of rain without a sail breaking the monotony of the great circle of the sea and our water supply was nearly gone the charm ofthe lovely isle began to fade
to keep our minds busy we talked over our plans in case we were rescued
we knew it would be extremely difficult to convince the world of the truth of our story but we thought that if we could get the star shell safely home and mark could produce his calculations and formulas before competent scientific men we might be believed in time
much depended upon those precious documents and on the ovian photographs and curios that were snugly stored in the shell was shortly after daybreak on the a fourth day as we three were standing on the highest point of the reef norden had wandered away by himself that the end came ship cried dandy huskily small ship full of sail
here coming following the direction of his pointing finger we saw a sehooner bearing down upon the island her sails silhouetted upon the rosy glow of the dawn
we shook each others hands danced croaked our throats were too dry to shout and waved our hats in the abandon of relief
we were saved good hick holds out right to the end said mark shall evidently have to die in our beds of old age no matter what happens
hullo norden doing
the professor had evidently seen the ship before we had for he was already on the shore running and nearly at the shell
we did not move for we were too far away to stop him whatever mischief he might be planning
long before we could reach him he would be safely inside our precious vehicle treacherous hound means to leave us to steal the shell to make a journey on his own account said it will be suicide for he can not work the vessel himself nor is it provisioned now
utterly helpless we stood and watched the last act in the lifedrama of the wonderful star shell
norden reached it climbed up and stood in the open doorway for a moment holding out a round black object at arms length for us to see
the faint sound of his husky voice his cackling laughter came to us on the sea breeze mingled with the thunder of the surf
the climax was sudden unexpected
norden appeared to stumble tried to recover his footing lurched backward and disappeared into the shell
instantly a blaze of light burst out vivid even in the sunshine a cloud of smoke arose and a bang of fierce explosive sound shook the air
then the gale blew the cloud away and where the shell had lain was merely a great hole in the sand was a jovian bomb said remember that one was missing in the great battle
norden must have stolen it
what he intended to do we shall never know now
perhaps he was going to blow us all up with it later
anyhow he has only done himself in praise be
only asked mark
oh the star shell
you can build another one old fellow
with all my papers and formulas the results of years of work blown to fragments
with all the proofs of our voyage destroyed afraid harry that our first trip to the stars is also our last
a boat was now putting off from the schooner
and what shall we say to these people
how shall we explain the explosion and our presence here ust tell them the truth harry said mark wearily
they will want to know what ship we have been wrecked in they will be firmly convinced that what they saw was the detonation of a floating mine
but tell them the truth they wonot believe it
and they didnot nor does the world
but we three know
mark is working hard again and some day perhaps perhaps
no
the lady of the velvet collar by a stormy night in the tempestuous times of the french revolution a young german was returning to his lodgings at a late hour across the old part of paris
the lightning gleamed and the loud claps of thunder rattled through the lofty narrow streets but i should first tell you something about this young german
gottfried wolfgang was a young man of good family
he had studied for some time at gottingen but being of a visionary and enthusiastic character he had wandered into those wild and speculative doctrines which have so often bewildered german students
his secluded life his intense application and the singular nature of his studies had an effect on both mind and body
his health was impaired his imagination diseased
he had been indulging in fanciful speculations on spiritual essences until like swedenborg he had an ideal world of his own around him
he took up a notion i do not know from what cause that there was an evil influence hanging over him an evil genius or spirit seeking to ensnare him and insure his perdition
such an idea working on his melancholy temperament produced the most gloomy effects
he became haggard and desponding
his friends discovered the mental malady preying upon him and determined that the best cure was a change of scene he was sent therefore to finish his studies amidst the splendors and gayeties of paris
wolfgang arrived at paris at the breaking out of the revolution
the popular delirium at first caught his enthusiastic mind and he was captivated by the political and philosophical theories of the day but the scenes of blood which followed shocked his sensitive nature disgusted him with society and the world and made him more than ever a recluse
he shut himself up in a solitary apartment in the pays latin the quarter of students
there in a gloomy street not far from the monastic walls of the sorbonne he pursued his favorite speculations
sometimes he spent hours together in the great libraries of paris those catacombs of departed authors rummaging among their hoards of dusty and obsolete works in quest of food for his unhealthy appetite
he was in a manner a literary ghoul feeding in the charnelhouse of decayed literature
wolfgang though solitary and refuse was of an ardent temperament nit for a time it operated merely upon his imagination
he was too shy and ignorant of the world to nake any advances to the fair but he was a passionate admirer of female oeauty and in his lonely chamber would often lose himself in reveries on forms and faces which he had seen his fancy would deck out images of loveliness far surpassing the eality
while his mind was in this excited and sublimated state a dream produced an extraordinary effect upon aim
it was of a female face of traneendent beauty
so strong was the mpression made that he dreamed of again and again
it haunted his houghts by day his slumbers by light in fine he became passionately namored of this shadow of a dream
this lasted so long that it became one of those fixed ideas which haunt the minds of melancholy men and are at imes mistaken for madness
such was gottfried wolfgang and ueh his situation at the time i mentioned
he was returning home late one stormy night through some of the old and gloomy streets of the marais the ancient part of paris
the loud claps of thunder rattled among the high houses of the narrow streets
he came to the place de la greve the square where public executions are performed
the lightning quivered about the pinnacles of the ancient hotel de ville and shed flickering gleams over the open space in front
as wolfgang was crossing the square he shrank back with horror at finding himself close by the guillotine
it was the height of the reign of terror when this dreadful instrument of death stood ever ready and its scaffold was continually running with the blood of the virtuous and the brave
it had that very day been actively employed in the work of carnage and there it stood in gium array amidst a silent and sleeping city waiting for fresh victims heart sickened within him and he was turning shuddering from the horrible engine when he beheld a shadowy form cowering as it were at the foot of the steps which led up to the scaffold
a succession of vivid flashes of lightning revealed it more distinctly
it was a female figure dressed in black
she was seated on one of the lower steps of the scaffold leaning forward her face hid in her lap and her long disheveled tresses hanging to the ground streaming with the rain which fell in torrents
wolfgang paused
there was something awful in this solitary monument of wo
the female had the appearance of being above the common order
he knew the times to be full of vicissitude and that many a fair head which had once been pillowed on down now wandered houseless
perhaps this was some poor mourner whom the dreadful ax had rendered desolate and who sat here heartbroken on the strand of existence from which all that was dear to her had been launched into eternity
he approached and addressed her in the accents of sympathy
she raised her head and gazed wildly at him
what was his astonishment at beholding by the bright glare of the lightning the very face which had haunted him in his dreams
it was pale and disconsolate but ravishingly beautiful
trembling with violent and conflicting emotions wolfgang again accosted her
he spoke something of her being exposed at such an hour of the night and to the fury of such a storm and offered to conduct her to her friends
she pointed to the guillotine with a gesture of dreadful signification have no friend on earth said she
but you have a home said wolfgang
yes in the grave
the heart of the student melted at the words
if a stranger dare make an offer said he without danger of being misunderstood i would offer my humble dwelling as a shelter myself as a devoted friend
i am friendless myself in paris and a stranger in the land but if my life could be of service it is at your disposal and should be sacrificed before harm or indignity should come to you
there was an honest earnestness in the young mans manner that had its effect
his foreign accent too was in his favor it showed him not to be a hackneyed inhabitant of paris
indeed there is an eloquence in true enthusiasm that is not to be doubted
the homeless stranger confided herself implieity to the protection of the student
he supported her faltering steps across the pont neuf and by the place where the statue of henry the fourth had been overthrown by the populace
the storm had abated and the thunder rumbled at a distance
all paris was quiet that great volcano of human passion slumbered for awhile to gather fresh strength for the next days eruption
the student conducted his charge through the ancient streets of the pays latin and by the dusky walls of the sorbonne to the great dingy hotel which he inhabited
the old portress who admitted them stared with surprize at the unusual sight of the melancholy wolfgang with a female companion
on entering his apartment the student for the first time blushed at the scantiness and indifference of his dwelling
he had but one chamber an oldfashioned salon heavily carved and fantastically furnished with the remains of former magnificence for it was of those hotels in the quarter of the luxembourg palace which had once belonged to nobility
it was lumbered with books and papers and all the usual apparatus of a student and his bed stood in a recess at one end
when lights were brought and wolfgang had a better opportunity of contemplating the stranger lie was more than ever intoxicated by her beauty
her face was pale but of a dazzling fairness set off by a profusion of raven hair that hung clustering about it
her eyes were large and brilliant with a singular expression approaching almost to wildness
as far as her black dress permitted her shape to be seen it was of perfect symmetry
her whole appearance was highly striking though she was dressed in the simplest style
the only thing approaching to an ornament which she wore was a broad black band round her neck clasped by diamonds
the perplexity now commenced with the student how to dispose of the helpless being thus thrown upon his protection
he thought of abandoning his chamber to her and seeking shelter for himself elsewhere
still he was so fascinated by her charms there seemed to be such a spell upon his thoughts and wenses that he could not tear himself from her presence
her manner too was singular and unaccountable
she spoke no more of the guillotine
her grief had abated
the attentions of the student had first avon her confidence and then apparently her heart
she was evidently an enthusiast like himself and enthusiasts soon understand each other
in the infatuation of the moment wolfgang avowed his passion for her
he told her the story of his mysterious dream and how she had possessed his heart before he had even seen her
she was strangely affected by his recital and acknowledged to have felt an impulse toward him equally unaccountable
it was the time for wild theory and wild actions
old prejudices and superstitions were done away everything was under the sway of the goddess of reason
among other rubbish of the old times the forms and ceremonies of marriage began to be considered superfluous bonds for honorable minds
social compacts wer the vogue
wolfgang was too much of a theorist not to be tainted by the liberal doctrines of the day
why should we separate said he
our hearts are united in the eye of reason and honor we are as one
what need is there of sordid forms to bind high souls together
the stranger listened with emotion she had evidently received illumination at the same school
you have no home nor family continued he let me be everything to you or rather let us be everything to one another
if form is necessary form shall be observed there is my hand
i pledge myself to you forever
forever said the stranger solemnly
forever repeated wolfgang
the stranger clasped the hand extended to her then i am yours murmured she and sank upon his bosom he next morning the student left his bride sleeping and sallied forth at an early hour to seek more spacious apartments suitable to the change in his situation
when he returned he found the stranger lying with her head hanging over the bed and one arm thrown over it
he spoke to her but received no reply
he advanced to awaken her from her uneasy posture
on taking her hand it was cold there was no pulsation her face was pallid and ghastly in a word she was a corpse
horrified and frantic he alarmed the house
a scene of confusion ensued
the police was summoned
as the officer of police entered the room he started back on beholding the coipse
great heaven cried he how did this woman come here
do you know anything about her said wolfgang eagerly
do exclaimed the police officer she was guillotined yesterday
he stepped forward undid the black collar round the neck of the corpse and the head rolled on the floor
the student burst into a frenzy
the fiend the fiend has gained possession of me shrieked he am lost forever
they tried to soothe him but in vain
he was possessed with the frightful belief that an evil spirit had reanimated the dead body to ensnare him
he went distracted and died in a madhouse time to time in letters to the eyrie readers have affirmed that it is impossible for hair to turn white overnight from a sudden dreadful shock that there are no nerves in the hairfollicles and therefore a sudden fright can turn hair white only at the roots
the nerves touching the hairroots say these readers can cause the hair to turn white at the base and grow out white but the hair that is already grown out canot possibly turn white
however the belief that hair can turn white from a sudden shock is so universal that we asked dr evans wellknown writer on medical subjects and former chicago health commissioner to settle the question for our readers bearing in mind lines in the prisoner of chillon my hair is gray but hot with years nor turned it white in a single night as mens have grown from sudden fears
dr evans quotes from the care of the skin and hair
page grayness is often influenced by emotional and other mental trials particularly those that are prolonged and it is not an uncommon occurrence to see it develop rapidly from grief severe business anxiety or other conditions of intense mental strain
that grayness sometimes occurs suddenly is a general impression which i believe is correct
it is difficult to understand the mechanism of its sudden production but some of the most unromantic and reliable scientific obseivers have recorded cases of it
that seems to settle the case in favor of those writers of weird stories who let their hair turn white overnight as mens have grown from sudden fears pusey says dr evans is an authority
writes jack conroy of hannibal missouri three months ago while waiting for a train in an isolated railroad station i picked up a copy of the august weird tales and was thunderstruck by the transformation
all of the tales possessed a distinct literary quality and three of them are good enough to be chosen by obrien for his best short stories
i refer to the woman of the wood by merritt the whistling monsters by wallis and the monstergod of mamurtli by edmond hamilton
the two succeeding numbers have not been entirely as good but good enough to surpass any other magazine in the field
the bird of space and its sequel were excellent and across space captivates the interest
your poetry is chosen with discrimination and all in all you may say to the other publishers in the words of ozymandias look on my works ye mighty and despair there is one discordant note however the drawings to illustrate the text are bad
william bradford of cleveland ohio writes to the eyrie the first story i ever read in weird tales was out of the lone ago by seabury quinn
since then i have bought every issue
jules de grandin is one of your most interesting and entertaining characters
sometimes the plots are a little farfetched but the story is always told in such style with occasional humor and scientific theories mixed into the mystery which carry the interest to the last word
in fact i have not yet found a story in weird tales that did not have its good points and this fact reflects much credit upon your judgment in weeding out the uninteresting stories
i appreciate weird tales because i can begin a story confident that it has something in it and that i wonot lose interest and throw it away before finishing it
mrs harris of lakewood ohio writes quality of your magazine is improving steadily
the metal giants the star shell and the grinning mummy are my choice for the three best stories in the december issue rites alice huffman of indianapolis am a constant reader of weird tales and enjoy the stories immensely as i consider them a relief from the monotony of the humdrum stories featured by most other magazines
i really canot say which type of stories i like best in your magazine but i think the scientific stories are great
i certainly enjoy all the stories of jules de grandin and the tales of strange beasts
harry levin of cleveland ohio writes to the eyrie while waiting for the car this morning i bought the latest weird tales
it contains a story which i think is the best that has been published for the last two years
it is a knockout
the metal giants by edmond hamilton is the story i mean
give us more stories by hamilton
your last two numbers are just about the best i have ever read writes barnes of vassar michigan
the metal giants was immense
i am especially fond of scientific and astronomical stories but as a whole i enjoy weird tales all the way through
without doubt i find it the most interesting magazine on the news stands today
but why publish weird story reprints when your own modern writers have the older ones outclassed writes jack snow of dayton ohio there is no mistaking the finest story in the december weird tales
it is the metal giants by edmond hamilton
the author has a gift accorded to few writers that of relating an imaginative scientific tale with sincerity and not with the usual hackneyed artificiality to be found in character and action of such stories
carl ballard of danville virginia writes to the eyrie the stories i like are pseudoscientific stories devilworship black magic tales of reincarnation and stories of the gods of old osiris isis pan jupiter etc i do not care much for ghost stories
when is munn going to give us that sequel to the werewolf of ponkert in which he promised us the black master would come back
walsh of east orange new jersey asks have any of your authors ever been in that hot bed of witchcraft abyssinia
do they know of the wailing spirit called bouda
metamorphosis happens to be a capital crime in abyssinia and also in italian somaliland
one sees strange things in those lands
mr warner munn might find real food for horrortales in this locality
sophie wenzel ellis of little rock arkansas writes to the eyrie the happiest days of the month for me are those immediately following the first when i am reading weird tales
in my clipping file of short stories there are more distinctive stories from your magazine than any other
why do you not select a group of your best stories and issue them in book form
i should like to see you publish more stories of the sort which is exquisitely fanciful such as the woman of the wood by merritt the moon bog and the outsider by lovecraft and the dreamer of atlanaat by price
scott williamson of los angeles expresses his ideas in verse there was a time when life grew humdrum and i found a little magazine where thrilling tales abound
when reading in this book it seems that we are whirled through endless space into another unknown world
a book that helps us when our lagging spirit fails and rea wakes the joy of living is weird tales
to the writer of the most helpful and constructive letter sent to the eyrie discussing the stories in this issue weird tales will send seabury original typescript of the man who cast no shadow which the coverstory for this issue
the typescript will be autographed by the author
readers your favorite story in the december issue was the metal giants by edmond ilamilton
this story has three times as many votes as its nearest competitors the grinning mummy by seabury quinn and part two of the star shell by george wallis and wallis
what is your favorite story in the present issue
story remarks i do not like the following stories why
it will help ns to know what kind of stories you want in weird tales if you will fill out this coupon and mail it to the eyrie weird tales ohio st chicago name and address the man who cast no shadow continued from page young lady dr de grandin sor
detective sergeant costello asked respectfully leaning forward from the rear seat of the car
wait wait my friend de grandin replied with a smile
when our duties are all performed i shall tell you such a tale as shall make your two eyes to pop outward like a snails
first however you must go with us to restore this jpauvre enfant 1o her mothers arms then to the headquarters to report the death of that sale bete
friend trowbridge will stay with the young lady for so long as he deems necessary and i shall remain with him to help
then this evening with your consent friend trow bridge you will dine with us sergent and i shall tell you all everything in total
death of my iife what a tale it is
parbleu but you shall call me a liar many times before it is finished ules de grandin placed his demitasse on the tabouret and refilled his liqueur glass
my friends he began turning his quick elfish smile first on costello then on me have promised you a remarkable tale
very well then to begin
he flicked a wholly imaginary fleck of dust from his dinner jacket sleeve and crossed his slender womanishly ana feet on the hearth rug
do you recall friend trowbridge how we went you and to he tea given by the good madame norman
yes
perhaps then you will recall how at the entrance of the ballroom i stopped with a look of as1 onishment on my face
very good
at that moment i saw that which made me disbelieve the evidence of my own two eyes
as the gentleman we later met as count czerny danced past a mirror on the wall i beheld parbleu what do you suppose the reflection only of his dancing partner
it was as if the man had been nonexistent and the young lady had danced past the mirror by heiself
now such a thing was not likely i admit you sergent and you too friend trowbridge will say it was not possible but such is not the case
in certain circumstances it is possible for that which we see with our eyes to cast no shadow in a mirror
let that point wait a moment we have other evidence to consider first
when the young man told us of the counts prowess in battle of his imcomparable ferocity i began to believe that which i had at first disbelieved and when he told us the count was a hungarian i began to believe more than ever met the count as you will remember and i took his hand in mine
parbleu it was like a hand with no palm it had hairs on both sides of it
you too friend trowbridge remarked on that phenomenon
while i talked with him i managed to maneuver him before a mirror
morbleu the man was as if he had not been i could see my own face smiling at me where i knew i should have seen the reflection of his shoulder now attend me the surete general what you call the police headquarters of paris is not like your english and american bureaus
all facts no matter however seemingly absurd which come to that office are carefully noted down for future reference
among other histories i have read in the archives of that office was that of one baron lajos czuczron of transylvania whose actions had once been watched by our secret agents
this man was rich and favored beyond the common run of hungarian petty nobles but he was far from beloved by his peasantry
he was known as cruel wicked and implacable and no one could be found who had ever one kind word to say for him
half the countryside suspected him of being a loupgarou or werewolf the others credited a local legend that a woman of his family had once in the olden days taken a demon to husband and that he was the offspring of that unholy union
according to the story the progeny of this wicked woman lived like an ordinary man for one hundred years then died on the stroke of the century unless his vitality teas renewed by drinking the blood of a slaughtered virgin
absurd
possibly
an english intelligence office would have said bally nonsense if one of its agents had sent in such a report
an american bureau would have labeled the report as being the saueeoftheapple but consider this fact in six hundred years there was no single record of a baron czuczron having died
barons grew old old to the point of death but always there came along a new baron a man in the prime of life not a youth to take the old barons place nor could any say when the old baron had died or where his body had been laid
now i had been told that a man under a curse the werewolf the vampire or any other thing in mans shape who lives more than his allotted time by virtue of wickedness can not cast a shadow in a mirror also that those accursed ones have hair in the palms of their hands
eh bien with this foreknowledge i engaged this man who called himself count czerny in conversation concerning transylvania
parbleu the fellow denied all knowledge of the country
he denied it with more force than was necessary
you are a liar monsieur le comte i tell him but i say it to myself
even yet however i do not think what i think later
then came the case of the young eckhart
he loses blood he can not say how or why but friend trowbridge and i find a queer mark on his body
i think to me if perhaps a vampire a member of that accursed tribe who leave their graves by night and suck the blood of the living were here that would account for this young mans condition
but where would such a being come from it is not likely
then i meet that old man the one you call indian john
he tells me much of the history of this town in the early days and he tells me something more
he tells of a man an old old man who has paid him much money to go to a certain grave the grave of a reputed witch in the old cemetery and dig from about it a growth of wild garlic
garlic i know is a plant intolerable to the vampire
he can not abide it
if it is planted on his grave he can not pass it ask myself who would want such a thing to be and why
but i have no answer only i know if a vampire have been confined to that grave by planted garlic then liberated when that garlic is taken away it would account for the young eckhart s strange sickness
tiens friend trowbridge and i visit that grave and on its tombstone we read a verse which makes me believe the tenant of that grave may be a vampire
we interview the good minister of the church and learn that another man an old old man have also inquired about that strange grave
who have done this
i ask me but even yet i have no definite answer to my question
as we rush to the norman house to see young eckhart i stop at an next month the city of glass by masterpiece of weird fiction a tale of atlantis of incredibly aged human beings who have built their city of glass in the african desert a complete novelette of uncanny thrills and terrifying adventures a weirdscientific story of titanic mushrooms and giant toadstools of exploding fungi and deathdealing spores
the utterly strange and startling adventures that befell a handful of americans among this gruesome people the loathsome personality of kreggor and the battle of the fungi make one of the most fascinating stories ever written
the story will be printed complete in the march issue of the unique magazine on sale february clig and mail this coupon

special offer void unless remittance is accompanied by coupon
nome address city trite italian green grocers and ask for fresh garlic for i think perhaps we can use it to protect the young eckhart if it really is a vampire which is troubling him
parbleu some man an old old man have what you americans call cornered the available supply of garlic
cordieu i tell me this old man he constantly crosses our trail
also he is a very great nuisance
the italian tell me the garlic was sent to a house in rupleysville so i have an idea where this interfering old rascal may abide
but at that moment i have greater need to see our friend eckhart than to ask further questions of the italian
before i go however i tell that shopkeeper that his garlic customer has the evil eye
parbleu monsieur garlicbuyer you will have no more dealings with that italian
he knows what he knows
when we arrive at the norman house we find young eckhart in great trouble and a black serving maid tells of a strangelooking woman who bit him
also we find toothmarks on his breast
the vampirewoman sarah is in very truth at large i tell me and so i hasten to the cemetery to make her fast to her grave with a wooden stake for once he is staked down the vampire can no longer roam
he is finished
friend trowbridge will testify he saw blood on the stake driven into a drave dug nearly three hundred years ago is it not so mon ami i nodded assent and he took up his narrative why this old man should wish to liberate the vampirewoman i know not certain it is one of that grisly guild or one closely associated with it as this count czerny undoubtedly was can tell when another of the company is in the vicinity and i doubt not he did this deed for pure malice and deviltry
however that may be friend trowbridge tells me he have seen the count and that he seems to have aged greatly
the man who visited the clergyman and the man who bought the garlic was also much older than the count as we knew him
ah ha he is coming to the end of his century i tell me now look out for devilment jules de grandin
certainly it is sure to come
and then my sergent come you with your tale of mademoiselle disappearance and too think perhaps she has run away from home voluntarily of her own free will until you say the italian shopkeeper recognized the old man who accosted her as one who has the evil eye
now what old man save the one who bought the garlic and who lives at rupleysville would that italian accuse of the evil eye
pardieu has he not already told you the same man once bought his garlic
but yes
the case is complete
the girl has disappeared an old old man has accosted her an old old man who was so strong he could overcome a policeman the count is nearing his century mark when he must die like other men unless he can secure the blood of a virgin to revivify him
i am more than certain that the count and baron are one and the same and that they both dwell at rupleysville
voila we go to rupleysville and we arrive there not one little minute too soon mes amis sure costello agreed rising and holding out his hand in farewell got th goods doc
no mistake about it
to me as i helped him with his coat in the hall the detective confided an he only had one shot o licker all evenin

new york why run the chance of missing an issue of a year in the united states in canada atomic conquerors continued rom page until it seemed to be obscured by a mass of small dark clouds clouds that drew together fused condensed
smaller and smaller grew that mass of blackness the sunlight pouring down around its edges
and now it was descending dropping swiftly down toward the massed disks above dropping down until it showed itself as not a single mass but as several dropping down until he saw that it was five black disks five that raced toward the line of other disks above
wonder filled him and a dawning comprehension
these were disks returning from the superworld he saw dwindling down until they entered our own universe but how came it that only five returned
five of the mighty thousands marlowe had seen that had attacked the superworld
were they messengers
he saw the five race toward the hundreds above saw them hang with those hundreds for a space of minutes then confusion seemed to run through the massed disks above that were suddenly swooping back down to the hilltop
as they sank down to the summit their numbers darkened the sky and he saw without understanding a mass of their number that seemed to grow smaller that dwindled and vanished within the pit
another mass did likewise and another
they were returning to their own atom
and now hunter understood at last
the five were survivors
their attack on the superworld had failed they were in retreat retreat from but look
look
the sky above was again darkening even more intensely than before
even as the disks of the invaders dwindled and sank with frantie haste into the pit the darkness above was compressing contracting resolving into a myriad of dark long shapes shapes that swooped swiftly down upon the disordered disks above
long black fishlike hulls utterly different from the disks of the atomic people
as they came down upon the disks flashes of violent lightning flickered from the fishhulls striking disk after disk sending them down in whirling masses of bursting flames
it was the superpeople hunter knew pursuing the atomic invaders from their own greater world where the attack of their mighty fleet of disks had failed
from the few disks that stood to the terrible attack of the superpeople the blue cold ray sprang out sullenly but at its first appearance the circling swooping hulls vanished entirely from view
then from all the air around the disks flash on flash of lightning stabbed at them
the superwarriors had made themselves invisible
in panic haste the last few disks sank down toward the pit and the lightning ceased abruptly
it was as though the desire of the attacking superpeople was only to force the atomic invaders back down into their own universe
the last few disks dwindled diminished vanished into the pit into the sandgrain and the last humming sound ceased
the invaders had been swept from the earth
running out from the cabin hunter saw that the pit was empty of them and he shouted aloud
abruptly the long narrow shapes of the hulls reappeared above swooping swiftly down upon the hilltop
and with a sudden sense of nearing peril hunter fled down the hillside sinking to the ground when his stiff limbs could carry him no farther
above the black hulls were clustered thickly around the hilltop and the droning of a machine of some sort reached him then a sudden sharp tapping of metal on metal
within a space of minutes the appearance is now more than ever the key note of success both in social and business life

i hulls suddenly swung up from the summit and hovered momentarily circling
and from one of their number beneath the rest swung suspended a glistening globe of shining metal a ball some three feet in thickness
even as the awed hunter comprehended that the superpeople had sealed the sandgrain within that shining metal sphere from all the gathered hulls above flash after flash of terrific lightning stabbed down toward the hilltop with a splitting crash and beneath hunter the ground heaved and swayed
he staggered to his feet glimpsed the edge of a narrow deep abyss in the hilltop created by that blasting force then saw the ball of metal whirling down into this abyss holding within it the atomic world forever
again flashed down the lightning and beneath him was a gigantic rumbling a grinding and crashing as the abyss closed prisoning the ball within its incalculable depths
hunter sank again to the ground his brain turning dizzily
he saw vaguely the dark hulls sweeping back up toward the zenith dimly saw one of them that swooped down close above him and hung for a moment as if in curiosity and from the side of this a score of faces peered down at him faces not unhuman in shape but unhuman in the high and untroubled serenity that lay on them faces that seemed to look down at him with a calm benevolence an amused but kindly pity
then that last hull too drove up toward the zenith and all gathered there expanding growings darkening the skies once more bringing twilight that deepened into blackness a blackness that hung for a moment then broke up dimmed vanished
standing there on the hillside hunter raised tremulous hands toward the sunlit sky as if in gratitude as if in prayer unset illumined leadanfoot with a glory of orange and crimson light when hunter reached the village
he walked slowly down the silent deserted street and sat down wearily on a bench in front of the inn
with an uncertain smile he remembered his conversation with the innkeeper and wondered where the man was now
and too with a flash of sudden pity he remembered marlowe and their toiling race up the hill
a kindly honest man he had seemed one who had probably lived a life of serene content in his quiet museum before fate dragged him into the whirlpool of cosmic war
a war that he had striven to prevent however powerlessly
and more somberly hunter thought of the other man of powell
well it was over now and what could one say of the dead
as it was he thought with those two dead he was the only man on earth to know what had really happened
those others those millions in the world outside they would be wondering doubtful puzzled yet thankful too
well soon he would be getting back to that world to tell them what he knew
but just now he wanted to sit in the quiet deserted village breathing its peace after his two nights and days of nightmare fear and terror
just now he wanted to sit and listen to little trivial sounds the wind that whispered in his ears the crickets in the long grass in iext months will appear the most thrilling weirdscientific story edmond hamilton has yet written evolution island the tale of a spawning horror let loose upon the world

the brimstone cat continued rom page toward us and one of them raised his hand in which there was a heavy club
another of my queer friends is hari tosuki the japanese wrestler
prom him i once learned something of jujitsu
now that knowledge stood me in good stead
i threw the man with the club felling him with a catch that broke his arm and knocked him senseless
then i grappled with the other villain an ugly evil creature powerful but with a misshapen back as i discovered when i finally had him down
meanwhile the girl instead of fainting or crying out again had fled down the street
she came back just as i was reflecting with some pride that i had done credit to hari my teacher
with her were two big policemen
they put handcuffs on our assailants and the girl told her story while one of the policemen made notes for the charge that should be entered against the thugs
the girl had been on an errand in this part of the city where she was a stranger
the errand had detained her much later than she expected and in the dusk she had lost her way
the two ruffians had held her up and infuriated when they found that she had but a few cents in her pocketbook had attempted further outrage
she had broken away and fled down the side street coming upon me
as she told her story i looked at her for the first time
or was it the first time she was a tiny thing with redgold curls and a dimple in one cheek that made my heart pound madly with a desire to kiss it
her eyes ere of a clear blue like that of the sea on a calm summer afternoon and as i looked into them i knew why govern ariste had never found other women fair
i had been as a voyager who sails on a long journey seeking he knows not what until on a clear day he comes to a bay of calm blue water that is his harbor and his home
as i looked into her eyes i saw recognition of me leap into her own
my name is govern ariste and i am sure i have met you before i told her
may i call a taxi and take you home
and i have met you although i do not recall where she replied
your name is an odd one but i do not seem to remember it have always wished for a comfortable sensible name i confided such a name as peter
peter would suit you much better she agreed
my name is edith montgomery
i live with my father who will be much worried at my late return
i shall be very glad to have you take me home
i hailed a passing taxi
as we climbed into it the police patrol drove up and a big policeman led the deformed ruffian toward it
the man turned and cursed me the cause of his misfortune and in his evil face now under the strong light of the machines headlight i saw distinctly the brutal features of tom the hangman of london town
but i had other things to think of than hangmen
a may morning in the hunting park of good queen bess or a taxicab in a dark city street when a man finds romance what matters the setting
the rapture is the same
in some way i can not remember the details we reached my ladys home
she left me with a sweetspoken goodbye and an invitation to call on the morrow and receive her fathers thanks after she had told him the story of her unpleasant adventure

santschi glenellyn dl details i reached again this room in mrs house where the damnable eat has now ceased its caterwauling
i have written this story what a story as best i might when a vision ever comes between me and my typewriter the vision of the sweetest fairest face in the world
what hair what eyes and what a bewitching mouth
and her blush
yes she blushed at the look i gave her when i hade her goodnight
once before i have seen her blush when i raised her hand to my lips and touched the body of the brimstone cat or did was my dream of peter byfield a story only ah the story i am about to live is real enough hut was the other chapter real
have the doors of the past opened to give me a glimpse of a chapter of life now gone but to be continued in a new setting
amir das would say so and there are others who so believe
amir das has told me in our discussions that the philosophers stone which the alchemists of old sought is the power that some few men in east and west seek today the power whereby soul and spirit conquer all earthly things
one who finds this power is never horn on earth again as mere man
thus teach the sages of the east
he has lived through all the chapters of life that were allotted to him in the beginning
i have not found the philosophers stone but i have found something dearer to me than my owa life
did peter byfield live do not know
but two things i do know
one of them is that some day and that a day not long distant i shall marry the lady of my heart the girl of the redgold curls and the eyes that are my doors to heaven
the other
the other is that i shall always hate cats
