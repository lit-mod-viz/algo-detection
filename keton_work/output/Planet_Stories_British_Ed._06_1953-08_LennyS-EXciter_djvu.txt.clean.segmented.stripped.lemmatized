in the web hand of the stolid greenface one rest the screece gem 
some say -PRON- a fabulous diamond some an emerald some a ruby but caine guess -PRON- be death -PRON- 
high above the ivet plain and muggy jungle above the slick rock and shiny leave rest a temple 
like most shrine of ancient order -PRON- narrow spire point to the sky 
man venusian man walk quietly through therestricte labyrinth of this temple green finger web beneath the long sleeve of -PRON- gray cape green face expressionless beneath the sanctity of -PRON- gray hood 
there be movement and these cap man circle a silver orb that lie in dead center of the golden wall 
-PRON- pace each flat step a soundless motion 
the green finger unmesh spread and come together again 
screece say a flutelike voice 
screece say another 
the silver orb rest like a cloudy fistsized tinsel globe unsparkle while a dozen mind search out through the vastness of venus probe for the core of evil and purity 
foot pace face be immobile and through the thick air come a shrill rise scream from the throat of a giant black cat with deep orange eye 
the motion cease lidless stare meet 
grith pronounce one 
grith pronounce another 
and the pacing continue while green lip quirk the slight bit 
mind search i that season when the jungle of venus turn into a vapid steam swamp 
sleet bud glisten like long thin snake and leave hang limp and wet from the vinetree 
nichola caine feel the sweat prickle upon -PRON- forehead and slide down the side of -PRON- face 
fairchild -PRON- notice be sweat too so that the man shirt have turn dark and the closeclippe gray hair curl on -PRON- head 
only the woman still look fresh in -PRON- white shirt and short 
-PRON- be stand beside jetcopter drink plain scotch from a silver glass 
-PRON- husband fairchild be drink too as -PRON- sit silently in a folding chair beneath the tip of the ship leave wing 
this be go to be a sweet thing caine think -PRON- really be 
the air be dead of breeze and soggy cloud hang above -PRON- like an immense stifle blanket 
the man stare at -PRON- knee and the woman swirl the scotch in -PRON- glass 
caine keep lii palm flat against the arm rest of -PRON- chair 
-PRON- watch the woman closely 
there be too much brightness inside of -PRON- too much nervousness as though -PRON- be burn inside and -PRON- have to keep move laugh insulting entice because -PRON- be alive with that burn and -PRON- couldnot stop 
-PRON- wasnot the liquor caine know because -PRON- have just start that a few minute after -PRON- have bring the ship down 
-PRON- be approximately fourhundre mile from the colony and in the wild stretch of this venusian jungle fourhundre mile be like the distance from day to night 
here be the dark the strange the weird and the wild 
kiitz bird scream in the distance and -PRON- sound be like the sound a man make when -PRON- be touch by fire 
a thick muddy river go over a cliff above and behind -PRON- hit transparent rock with a steady crashing noise that thrum against ear like thunder in a distant sky 
teewh bird with black wing and curl yellow beak come out of the sultry sky and skim the tip of the tree surround the clearing 
-PRON- screech when -PRON- dove and -PRON- keep harmony with the unseen stationary kiitz bird 
a chilling nerveracking harmony -PRON- have a drink with -PRON- say the woman -PRON- tooth white between -PRON- smile lip 
thank -PRON- no caine say 
the woman tip -PRON- head and watch -PRON- 
-PRON- eye be very blue and -PRON- mock caine and taunt -PRON- while -PRON- husband just sit there drink and watch -PRON- bare knee 
this could go to piece in a hurry caine decide and -PRON- rub -PRON- palm against the arm of the chair 
because on the other hand the husband be too quiet too brood too deliberate unseeing of the way -PRON- wife play with caine with -PRON- eye and -PRON- movement 
-PRON- leg caine notice be the kind that would look well bare as -PRON- be or in nylon beneath a skirt and -PRON- have rather full hip although not too full 
-PRON- breast caine could see be well enough develop 
-PRON- bend to rub a finger against -PRON- left knee 
be there insect in this part of the jungle -PRON- ask caine

-PRON- be about fifty caine judge at least twenty year old than the woman 
-PRON- face be lean and sad and there be thin line travel out from the corner of -PRON- eye and mouth that contrast with the youthful cut of -PRON- wiry hair 
these two have come to caine because -PRON- reputation in the colony be establish 
-PRON- have be fly tourist into the jungle for more than three year and while -PRON- could not predict all of this country -PRON- at least know the general trait of those section within a reasonable radius of the colony 
do -PRON- ever shoot a grith cat the woman ask look at caine over -PRON- glass

but -PRON- have hear that -PRON- be pretty horrible and dangerous 
yes 
caine wipe a hand at the sweat on -PRON- forehead 
the woman be work at the cat -PRON- eye shift to look at -PRON- husband with every word to see how -PRON- be react 
so far -PRON- have do nothing say nothing only sit there and drink 
however the cat be not the reason the couple be in the venusian jungle

and -PRON- have fly all the way from earth to mar from mar to venus to find -PRON- 
the screece gem be a myth caine be certain a bit of fantasy out of ancient venusian lore 
but -PRON- pay -PRON- well for the trip and -PRON- would ask no question 
the woman stay with the cat

then the pain smash into -PRON- awareness 
-PRON- disappear as suddenly 
-PRON- be in agony then there be only the foolish whirl of -PRON- brain 
-PRON- turn slowly like a limp mannequin search the blankness of the mist

-PRON- be as though -PRON- steel have be melt and drain out of -PRON- by the drug like a fish -PRON- think push through ihe foliage a fish with a broken fin 
do cat like fish with break fin -PRON- wonder 
and the three of -PRON- be move in a slow silent line through the venusian wild 
the sound be in brain like a dozen record be play in a large echoing room 
teewh bird point -PRON- yellow beak and come scream at -PRON- head 
the kiitz bird flutter wildly out of the thicket -PRON- frightened sound like the rake of giant fingernail across smooth slate 
but there be other thing in this part of the jungle 
soft gelatinous phule the size of a man hand hang to the vinetree and when caine pass -PRON- -PRON- shift off the tree to -PRON- skin and begin -PRON- search for juice out of -PRON- own body 
-PRON- sweep -PRON- away one at a time and more find -PRON- have nothing leave in -PRON- vein for -PRON- -PRON- say to one of -PRON- stick to -PRON- waist 
maybe warm tea 
fairchild touch the rifle against -PRON- back and caine push the phule away 
a snakelike trill wriggle in front of -PRON- -PRON- purple and black skin glisten as though -PRON- have be draw through oil 
-PRON- be about four foot long and as thick as a heavy rope 
-PRON- neverclosing eye stare at caine 
hello friend caine say reach out -PRON- good arm 
the trill slide away what i really be like -PRON- decide wonder when the pain would come shatter into -PRON- again

the pain find -PRON- then and -PRON- brain be clear briefly of the veil of the drug 
the pain last longer this time

caine ask -PRON- and -PRON- push on through the growth feel the ground rise more steeply 
razor plant lick at -PRON- skin until -PRON- flesh be slit finely in a dozen place 
the gauze around -PRON- arm become a fuzzy mass like rag 
if i see a cat caine promise -PRON- take a splint off -PRON- arm and hit -PRON- over the head with -PRON- 
the mist hang around -PRON- like a hungry shroud eager to cloak everything on the planet with -PRON- muggy wetness 
then the growth lessen a bit and caine see bare rock here and there 
-PRON- be easy to move and -PRON- do not jar -PRON- arm as much but somewhere in -PRON- brain an old knowledge tell -PRON- that this would be certain grith territory and every step now be a step closer to the black face with the orange eye and sharp tooth 
caine feel -PRON- grow weak and each motion be a building effort 
the heat have rise but there be no sweat on -PRON- face now only a burn dryness 
-PRON- head seem to start -PRON- float again and -PRON- think for a moment that -PRON- may drift irp over the tree like a balloon 
the idea be very funny to -PRON- and laughter grow inside of -PRON- 
-PRON- griime feel -PRON- stomach move with -PRON- until suddenly -PRON- be freeze -PRON- movement laugh into the mistfilled air stare straight into the orange eye of a grith cat 
the laughter stop in -PRON- mouth 
-PRON- blink once 
the cat didnot move

caine feel a hot sting in -PRON- shoulder 
and the cat be a roaring craze thing that sweep through the air a flash of shine blackness 
the air come apart with the sound of the rifle and the scream of the woman and the roaring of the cat 
caine wait as though this be a dream -PRON- be watch 
the cat have leap straight for the woman and -PRON- be tangle with the black and white claw now so tliat caine see only a rolling scream mass

green hand slap together and the cat turn and disappear 
caine place -PRON- palm flat against the ground prop hunself and watch the approadiing figure 
the mist seem to be disappear and -PRON- could see more clearly the green skin and the large unblinking eye that look out solemnly from beneath the hood of the gray cape 
priest 
caine wonder 
from the temple 
i didnot know there be venusian here -PRON- say to -PRON- and although -PRON- be a very slight disclosure as though -PRON- have suddenly learn that there be more man on venus than woman -PRON- be astound and impress with -PRON- 
well -PRON- say grin up at -PRON- as -PRON- stop beside -PRON- 
well well 
-PRON- get to -PRON- knee and still smile look at -PRON- arm where the gauze have come loose 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head in wonderment 
-PRON- narrow -PRON- eye and examine the blood trickle from the surface wound in -PRON- shoulder 
well well -PRON- repeat and stand up 
the woman be a mangled shape on the wet ground and the man lie very still 
caine look lam one to the other 
yes yes -PRON- say aloud 
-PRON- turn to the grayape venusian and find the somber eye watch -PRON- in -PRON- kindly way 
one of -PRON- reach out and touch shoulder above the broken arm 
other move to the body of the man and woman and bend over -PRON- make float motion with -PRON- delicate green hand 
pray 
caine wonder watch these motion 
-PRON- shrug 
-PRON- couldnot hold a thought very long 
the mist be evaporate quickly 
caine look up think -PRON- could see a pointed outline 
tnen suddenly high above there be the golden temple a shimmer of tower spire of yellow beauty splash over by brilliant sunshine 
caine turn -PRON- face up to a strange sun a blind sun that send -PRON- bright life down through the leave 
and caine be aware that the cap figure be kneel all around pray in a jumble of voice -PRON- hand stretch up to the infrequent visitor of light 
what be -PRON- say caine ask smile queerly 
what be -PRON- -PRON- be say 
screece 
the sun 
the most valuable gem on venus 
be that what -PRON- worship in the golden temple 
caine look at the man and then at the woman 
be that what -PRON- have come from earth and from mar to find 
the sun -PRON- feel the laughter start in -PRON- again as though -PRON- be someone else laugh 
but -PRON- mouth widen and -PRON- tooth glisten in the sunlight and -PRON- laugh long peal laughter 
here -PRON- be -PRON- say staggering to the side of the man body -PRON- gem 
do -PRON- see -PRON- fairchild 
-PRON- point to the sky 
give -PRON- to -PRON- -PRON- say laugh through -PRON- word 
no give -PRON- to -PRON- for -PRON- then that 
-PRON- turn and move slowly to the woman stumble 
here -PRON- say to the woman stare eye 
here -PRON- be -PRON- see 
-PRON- look at -PRON- face shadow by a large leaf of a vinetree 
-PRON- reach up and jerk the leaf away so that the sunlight fall full on -PRON- white face 
there 
take -PRON- 
from charle to -PRON- through -PRON- -PRON- beautiful so big so brilliant so the laughter be get in the way of -PRON- word and -PRON- could feel tear go down -PRON- face 
pale green hand be hold -PRON- so that -PRON- wouldnot fall 
and -PRON- be move -PRON- away toward the temple 
caine look at the large kindly eye around -PRON- feel the hand guide -PRON- 
-PRON- couldnot stop laugh only -PRON- wish to god -PRON- could because -PRON- make the pain bad 
and -PRON- couldnot take much more pain 
the lip of one of the green face move 
wress say the voice the word pronounce with difficulty 
rest 
caine say between spasm of laughter that -PRON- be quite certain now be cry instead 
yes yes -PRON- say try to wipe at -PRON- tear 
oh yes 
rest pale green hand extend again palm doum and make sweeping downward motion destroy evil 
-PRON- be cup then and raise slowly as though lift purity to the top of the golden spire and beyond where a bright sun burn 
foot step soundlessly and figure kneel circle about a fistsized orb 
screece say a flutelike voice 
screece say another 
screece say a dozen voice 
hand motion and the silver globe be no longer dull and cloudy but fill with pure shine sunlight so that -PRON- glitter like a thousand diamond 
lip move silently 
a cat whimper somewhere then sleep 
silence good comic feature -PRON- favourite star and trigger in actionpacked entertainment 
reserve a copy now at -PRON- newsagent or bookstall 
bogus angel watch protectively from the wall top as the mechanical bloodhound inch toward teucrete while -PRON- talk with the police 
by on venus if one ring a doorbell or bang on a lock gate at night -PRON- be adventure 
-PRON- never know who or what will answer -PRON- summon 
the door swing slowly open and -PRON- brace -PRON- to look 
will -PRON- be maid or monster or both man gather and talk someone be sure to mention on venus 
man will always be fascinate by tale of the strange and wonderful and fantastic and zoo petshop wild animal supply house be the stuff from which legend be make 
one hear of the place on mar or earth on titan or rhea on callisto or ganymede even in the subsurface mine of pluto or the curious twilight outpost on mercury and some of the yarn will probably lessen if the tedium of lightyear watch when the first manned spacer push beyond the frontier of the solar system 
most of the story be 21st century version of the tall tale for both establishment and owner stagger imagination and breed fabulous account 
a rumor that khaljean will fabricate to order any nightmarish monster from synthetic flesh and organic spare part be obvious exaggeration 
the claim that khaljean can mate any curious lifeform capture by farrove hunter be also false since -PRON- fail twice 
khaljean love animal and collect -PRON- chiefly for pleasure 
-PRON- will sell some for pet and for educational exhibition but for each one sell -PRON- keep ten 
everyone know that -PRON- have frequently risk death rather than kill or injure a living creature 
of all -PRON- zoos wonder none can compare with khaljean for man be the most fantastic of animal and khaljean be the most extraordinary of man 
khaljean be both public figure and man of mystery 
nobody know -PRON- race or origin and nowadays nobody ask 
with the epidemic of mutation in the of venus and the standard genetangent accept among venusian native such curiosity be bad form 
and dangerous 
so and the story about -PRON- have grow steadily through the year 
the strange story of all concern the zoo be one that for good reason no one tell 
-PRON- happen to be true 
one night in castarona by the yellow sea but the trouble do not start in there be some who say -PRON- do not finish there a usterity have finally catch up with venus 
pao subcellar fungwee hell in the native quarter of old castarona be order to close every night at midnight venus time or else 
be a venusian business man a very rugged individualist and a type mutant pao chung prefer to chance the or else 
among interesting people net in the raid be pao chung -PRON- 
bland and overcivilize -PRON- have grow rich from traffic in illegal drug and the outlaw mechanical hypnotizer 
despite pointed ear and a gnomelike expression of detach malice -PRON- appear to be reasonably human even in -PRON- devotion to vice as a means of liveliliood 
anything illegal and profitable be -PRON- vocation -PRON- hobby range from innocent blackmail to murder for fun 
recent extension of -PRON- operation from slave trading into political corruption have incense even the graft official of castarona 
-PRON- wait only an opportunity to catch -PRON- off balance 
hence the raid 
bat ferris spaceman want on an open charge warrant swear out by solar survey inc and want preferably alive and in condition to answer question 
ferris have learn long ago not to give -PRON- right name but an alias be poor disguise if one brain wave patern happen to be on file 
and sometimes if -PRON- be not 
be off reservation at all and particularly without permission and lack -PRON- identarmband would mean real trouble 
-PRON- capture in the raid be pure mischance due to enter pao only for the virtuous purpose of rescue -PRON- partner and friend bogus angel mutant from south venus painfully well knowm to police record 
the only angelic attribute -PRON- could claim be -PRON- twentyfoot wingspread 
-PRON- face bear eerie resemblance to those demonic gargoyle carve on medieval cathedral 
fine fur in stripe of ochre burn orange and smudge brown cover the visible part of -PRON- anthropoid anatomy make -PRON- resemble a tiger leave in the rain long enough for the dye to run 
angel like peace and quiet and resort to gambling theft arson aggravate assault and occasional assassination to obtain -PRON- 
in the icj morass of -PRON- soul the few crack vent sinister and malicious humor 
-PRON- great virtue be warped and violent loyalty to ferri which be not necessarily a virtue from the official point of view appetite for and capacity for misuse of drug alcohol and mechanical hypnotizer be miraculous but when load -PRON- be dangerous 
of nine other scoop in the raid only one fact nee be mention 
-PRON- be still in jail which indicate lack of initiative or good sense 
jailbreak on venus be a sporting proposition and inevitably weed the sheep from the goat 
pao chung and bogus angel be definitely goat and ferris may be consider a dark gray sheep 
for various reason -PRON- be essential to all three to escape and quickly 
-PRON- stand together in the jailyard 
ferris and angel have relapse into silence as pao chung approach 
when be -PRON- plan escape 
pao chung ask with a directness not expect of -PRON- 
angel chuckle but ferris stare suspiciously 
how be -PRON- so sure -PRON- intend to escape -PRON- parry 
pao chung shrug simple question easily answer 
while -PRON- friend be in -PRON- shop i manipulate the hypnotic machine 
-PRON- talk chiefly about -PRON- but also about -PRON- 
enough to give -PRON- a clue to -PRON- real identity though probably -PRON- do not guess -PRON- -PRON- 
i know that -PRON- dare not stay 
eventually -PRON- will check -PRON- brain wave pattern and learn too much 
which be the great risk 
what business be that of yours 
none directly pao chung admit 
but i enjoy fish in troubled water 
other people business can often be turn to -PRON- profit 
in this case since -PRON- be be frank i wish to leave with -PRON- when -PRON- go 
take -PRON- along or i talk before -PRON- can make the attempt 
mayhem shine in eye but ferri put a restraining hand on the furry arm man donot talk urge angel hopefully -PRON- nonhuman tongue lick feral lip 
wait order ferris 
if -PRON- kill -PRON- now -PRON- will have no chance to escape 
-PRON- would draw too much attention to -PRON- 
besides be foolish say pao chung smoothly 
both of -PRON- be stranger in castarona 
where would -PRON- go 
who would hide -PRON- 
how long would -PRON- last 
talk fast ferris advise gently 
if -PRON- know so much -PRON- know -PRON- have little to lose 
only -PRON- life perhaps 
more if -PRON- deduction be correct 
listen to -PRON- 
like -PRON- i be in great peril here 
-PRON- offense be a minor one 
by now i should have be fine and let go with a warning 
i suspect the authority of more sinister intention 
-PRON- will be easy to find a pretext if -PRON- wish to be rid of -PRON- 
i must escape 
alone none of -PRON- would stand a chance 
together who know ferris consult -PRON- partner with a glance angel nod but impose a question 
and afterwards what of -PRON- deduction will forget -PRON- promise pao chung 
see that -PRON- do say ferris 
or -PRON- will 
pao chung ignore the prophecy amiably know a possible refuge once -PRON- have manage the escape 
a man in the city owe -PRON- favor 
as refuge of course -PRON- will be temporary 
-PRON- will have mechanical tracker after -PRON- eventually but not at first 
electronic bloodhound would spoil -PRON- sport make kill -PRON- too easy 
but the nature of -PRON- sanctuary will give -PRON- pause for a time 
complex interesting and dangerous -PRON- be the one place in castarona no one will think to look 
and there be enough space to hide in for quite a while 
such a place sound interesting ferris agree 
but i suppose -PRON- know every unsavory rat nest in castarona 
not a rat nest say pao chung smile 
much well 
have -PRON- hear of who hasnot 
that should muddle the pursuit for a day or two 
but can -PRON- count on khaljean 
pao chung snort 
blackmail be -PRON- professional secret so donot ask detail will grant -PRON- refuge 
not willingly perhaps but i have enough on -PRON- to guarantee -PRON- conduct 
how about a plan for get out of jail 
ferris laugh harshly pay -PRON- passage 
now well pay our 
hide out with the rest of the wild animal seem very appropriate 
listen carefully pao chung and angel bend an ear nodding approval 
jailbreak look temptingly easy 
hazard of escape be mostly mental so far as barrier of barred door and window lock gate or wall of stone metal or plastic be concerned 
inner and outer door be frequently open 
prisoner move about at will within define limit 
even there no physical hindrance be put in the escapee way 
-PRON- may pause at the door and indulge in sical repartee with guard or warden 
-PRON- may delay -PRON- exit long enough to exchange fond farewell with friend and fellow inmate and -PRON- have well 
once outside the fun begin 
-PRON- be open season on fugitive prisoner and the first guard lucky enough to fatally blast an escapee receive two week with pay and a cash bonus for every hour short of the deadline require for kill or recapture a runaway 
any prisoner who make good -PRON- escape and last a full three day be write off die book 
either way -PRON- be write off since the guard make no pretense of try to recapture -PRON- alive and the hunt be gear to surprising efficiency 
-PRON- should be a spirited gamble but few man ever make the attempt and few still succeed so tlie sport may be say to languish 
history record only five man who make the finish line though hundred use to try for -PRON- 
build wall opposite the gateway bear leprous scar from blaster discharge which bring several dare attempt to pyrotechnical conclusion 
angel saunter up to a guard on duty at the main gate 
-PRON- look across the busy street at the flake wall and evidence of extreme heat 
a bored guard glance casually at the brawny venusian take curious note of -PRON- fold wing 
go out ask the guard with cynical humor get those wing singe sonny 
angel smile and a dream of violence live briefly in -PRON- gemfacete eye may -PRON- muse softly 
what handicap will -PRON- give -PRON- 
close -PRON- eye and count to five offer the guard grin viciously 
start count suggest angel -PRON- guard eye and mouth open wide -PRON- grin change to a glare alert and suspicious 
at that moment alarm blare in the cellblock and jailyard 
angel appear to stumble thrust -PRON- heavily against the guard 
already offbalance try to look in two direction at once the man lurch halfway through the gate 
automatic selenium cell alarm catch the movement and add -PRON- wild clamor to the jangling babel from the building 
volume of dense black smoke pour from door and window of the cellblock low floor 
from above come shrill scream from the trap inmate on upper floor 
fire yelled angel 
then -PRON- be run not through the gate but towards the building 
guard and prisoner mill in ultimate confusion 
jailyard be a melee but angel force a passage 
at tlie cellblock doorway -PRON- pause long enough to make sure that guard be rush a long ladder of lightmetal alloy to the wall 
inside -PRON- plunge through churn confusion of smoke sound and invisible solid 
in a city as imflammably build as castarona fire inevitably create panic 
equipment must be always at hand 
automatic sprinkler be already deluge the threaten interior with water and chemical 
angel wade kneedeep in chemical foam to the stairway and ascend against the pressure of a descend waterfall 
voice and metallic alarm mingle in shrill discord 
grope blindly and collide with hysterical prisoner angel fight up tlie spiral cascade of the stairway like a trout seek the spawning ground 
at the fourth floor -PRON- get to a window and smash the glass then set up a bedlam of howl and shriek 
from below the lightalloy ladder angle up toward -PRON- 
-PRON- hook engage the window ledge 
with a yelp of maniacal joy -PRON- snatch -PRON- from the hand of the steadier on the ground and give a series of quick jerk to dislodge the mount guard and firefighter 
with easy stren -PRON- lift -PRON- clear of the ground and ring by rung hoist -PRON- upward 
bat ferris and pao chung grasp -PRON- from the roof parapet and hold on while -PRON- race upstairs again and help -PRON- drag -PRON- to the roof 
the near building be just about a ladderlength away 
by prodigy -PRON- raise -PRON- to the vertical then let -PRON- slant in the direction indicate 
-PRON- topple and swing in a wild arc 
there be a bad moment when all three realize that -PRON- do not quite reach 
act instantaneously angel lift the pivot end hook -PRON- knee to the parapet and extend the ladder by -PRON- own length 
the far end strike hard bounce high nearly tear angel from -PRON- precarious hold 
over -PRON- command while the vibration still jar painfully through -PRON- body 
without argument one at a time ferris and pao chung walk gingerly across the perilous swaying bridge 
kneel ferris make sure the ladder hook be secure on the other parapet 
-PRON- cry out 
angel relax -PRON- kneehold beat -PRON- wing furiously and climb like a bird on a breaking treelimb 
the ladder swing in giant pendulum 
angel move with lightning speed and miraculous precision maintain balance with threshing pinion while -PRON- lithe leg and powerful arm carry -PRON- upward 
-PRON- be mount the upper rung when the ladder crash savagely against the building side writhe vibrate tear -PRON- hook free and send broken masonry crash into the dizzy depth below 
angel leap clear catch the parapet and drag -PRON- up 
guard boil onto the jailhouse roof and laced blaster beam across the chasm between building 
crouch low the fugitive run take advantage of every cover 
explosion follow -PRON- and -PRON- race through pelt storm of molten stone and metal 
over the roof ferris shout follow soon enough 
probably the near street be already block off and well need all the time -PRON- can snatch 
-PRON- halt for breath in the shelter of a vast dome 
pao chung glance admiringly at -PRON- enforce ally -PRON- comment 
even to the timing of the fake fire 
too bad such talent as -PRON- must be waste on an audience as unappreciative as the police 
however -PRON- have keep -PRON- bargain out and still alive 
with a few minute start and the rooftop of the city to play hide and seek in 
now if -PRON- can reach petshop reach -PRON- ferris promise grimly 
a round -PRON- be the fantastic skyline 
from below in the teem street come a rise buzz like the droning activity of a hive of angry bee 
above rise the citywide dome of fused quartz -PRON- crystalline concavity faintly iridescent as -PRON- reflect the questioning beam of giant searchlight 
planet story july north between the fugitive and the old native quarter of castarona be the gigantic system of airlock and below that the sprawl tangle of dockland 
ferris lead -PRON- companion in a tortuous route that cover mile of angle and uneven rooftop 
realize that -PRON- identcard must have come through -PRON- know that police and security official must be turn the city inside out in a wild scramble to locate and deal with -PRON- 
speed be essential and more than -PRON- personal safety depend upon the outcome of the wild chase over the jagged skyline 
knot of wary policeman and determine security soldier invade the rooftop and begin search the hundred of square mile 
in case the escape prisoner have descend from the high level even business block be be turn out 
the whole city be undergo systematic scouring 
officialdom be desperate and badly frightened 
mechanical tracker have already be send for 
never before have -PRON- be use so early in tlie game 
the man or whatever -PRON- be 
bat ferris must be find at once slay if possible 
the hunt be on full cry 
after two near brush with patrol ferri finally decide that -PRON- would be safe to descend to the street 
dragnet spread over the world above the city and only luck have keep the trio from be sight a dozen time 
-PRON- be near the edge of the city where the half bubble of the dome come down into a series of cone which be the great airlock protect the cityatmosphere from the troubled violence and noxious fume of outer venus 
like shadow the fugitive descend go down darkened spiral of stairway steal elevator move furtively among dark twisting alleyway crawl under vast landing stage and skirt heap of exotic venusian produce ready for ship to the nine inhabit world 
in the cluttered dockland area -PRON- collide blindly with an armed patrol 
angel act on pure instinct leap high then swoop down like a striking hawk 
tlie rustle of -PRON- open wing be like the flapping of windwhippe flame 
-PRON- outstretche arm gather two of the four man patrol and crush life from -PRON- before -PRON- sense danger 
ferris be al26 most as quick 
-PRON- leap and strangle and a man die in swift deadly silence 
pao chung unused to manage -PRON- own violence be clumsy 
a blaster go off 
then angel over the difficulty 
the soldier break and run scream fire -PRON- blaster twice more without aim 
the uproar would bring help 
but the soldier be beyond help 
angel soar and dive 
there be no fight 
now armed the fugitive flee swiftly 
pao chung take over the lead 
by devious street and crooked alley -PRON- go in the extreme of haste 
further caution be useless 
now that the alarm have be give speed be the only hone 
pao chun know every secret ratrun in the old native quarter 
-PRON- use most of -PRON- 
if the passage of the fugitive cause a ripple of excitement among the polyglot denizen of that forbidding area -PRON- do not know -PRON- nor heed -PRON- 
all three know the native well enough to be certain that the police could expect no favor from that source 
all venusian be natural anarch bear outlaw and rebel against authority 
the trail would die on stubborn tongue unless mechanical tracker be use 
even then unless the police and security squad come in massed force there would be incident to delay pursuit 
native and the human debris of nine world which have find refuge in the quarter have no reason to love autliority 
in one sense the area be an armed camp within the wall 
uneasy truce at best exist between these motley dweller and the intrude minion of the nominal officialdom 
while the hunt could expect no actual help from the guerilla force of underworld there be the certainty of hindrance to the hunter 
patrol and search squad converge on the freightdock stage draw by radioed report of a clash 
from there a trail of sort lead straight into the native quarter 
as the soldier and police mass on the fringe of the area spark of trouble begin to develop be quickly fan to flame and quench only by continuous violence and the arrival of overwhelming force 
pao chun lead -PRON- companion into a dark zigzagging alley 
not far now -PRON- gasp hoarsely struggle for breath 
from close behind come a rise uproar -PRON- alley end abruptly against a high blank curve wall of reinforce concrete 
pao raw burning throat refuse speech but -PRON- gesture over the wall 
there be no gate 
angel spring lightly to the top and give -PRON- partner in crime a hand up 
-PRON- drop into darkness on the far side 
light writhe and flicker curiously on the great dome overhead 
tumult die away behind -PRON- as -PRON- flee across a wide open space then rise to shocking crescendoe 
reflection flare in the dome 
uproar dwindle to uneasy silence as if the massed force of law and order have find the native quarter stickier go than expect and have be force to retire in disorder 
pao chung stop as if check direction then lead off at a sharp tangent 
the way go through field 
diflhise light from the tall citybuilding filter in here and give some sense of the ground surface which be fortunate 
numerous small fence of wire hum and sputter on insulatorpost 
electrify guardfence 
pao chung hurdle -PRON- carefully but -PRON- be low enough to trip and incinerate an incautious trespasser unaware of -PRON- existence and unused to -PRON- spacing 
oppressive silence brood over the place 
atmosphere be thick with pungent and exotic odor that linger with unpleasantly alien tang in the nostril 
ahead loom a high stockade of chromesteel piling pierce by a single monstrous gate 
pao chung run up and hammer on the gate 
-PRON- reserberation rouse thunderous echo in the night 
a curious echo persist and increase in volume 
on venus if one climb a fence ring a doorbell or bang on a lock gate at night -PRON- be adventure 
-PRON- never know who or what will answer -PRON- summon 
the door swing slowly open and -PRON- brace -PRON- to look 
will -PRON- be maid or monster or both 
this be the gate swing open a scant double handspan check by a short length of sturdy chain 
a head poke through the aperture 
an interesting head even in the difficult light 
detail be obscure but there be a flash of curdwhite skin finemodeling of feature a delicate oval face frame in a swinge bell of dark hair 
in this case tire summon be answer by presumably a maid daughter teucrete -PRON- something of a legend 
a woman can be describe in term of anatomical rhapsody 
or one may dwell endlessly upon sweetness of disposition upon quaint and unique charm of personality 
a potential lover may fashion poetic conceit upon the lilt moonbeam quality in -PRON- voice compare -PRON- skin to flowerpetal -PRON- eye to gemfire liken the graceful movement of limb and body to the liquid symphony of swirl water 
or these matter may be leave wholly to the imagination and the girl describe obliquely by reference to -PRON- effect upon the male population in -PRON- immediate vicinity 
the effect be jar enough 
go away -PRON- say inhospitably 
-PRON- lean furtlier through the opening to snarl fluent imprecation in venusian billingsgate at the nocturnal caller 
pao chung brave the storm 
shut up -PRON- say evenly eye fix on -PRON- savagely and -PRON- take a sharp breath with the obvious intention of renew -PRON- tirade 
then -PRON- think well of -PRON- and restrain -PRON- outrage long enough to throw a taunt in -PRON- face 
be pao chung so desperate for money that -PRON- come now in the middle of the night two day early for -PRON- payment 
come back then 
call -PRON- father order the venusian 
khaljean be not here hunt 
come back after noon tomorrow if -PRON- must see -PRON- 
the head withdraw inside 
the gate crash shut 
bolt grate 
shall i fly over the stockade and throttle -PRON- ask angel ripple -PRON- wing 
pao chung hammer the gate again 
as before the racket animal chorus repeat the sound witli variation 
pao chung keep pound until the gate be open again 
this time the head do not appear but a wiry female voice address -PRON- from the inside darkness 
still here 
the police must be hunt -PRON- 
-PRON- be 
good 
i will point -PRON- out and stay to watch the kill 
pao qiung chuckle evilly 
do that 
the record of background and illegal activity be in -PRON- safe 
-PRON- will provide for publication of all such paper upon -PRON- death 
the voice hesitate 
-PRON- may be worth humiliation or disgrace to be rid of -PRON- permanently 
-PRON- may agree pao chung 
many people have think so 
i wonder if khaljean will be one of -PRON- 
with a scrape of bare metal bolt retreat into soet and the chain be remove 
crack widen enough to permit entrance 
come in then teucrete say wearily will let -PRON- father decide when -PRON- return 
for tonight -PRON- can stay 
but i wonot answer for -PRON- safety 
the animal be rouse and nervous 
i be not sure i can control theni with stranger here cacophonie greet the entrance of the fugitive 
an atmosphere of alien and indescribable uneasiness pervade the vast compound with -PRON- row and pile bank of cage 
the atmosphere be the emotion of nighthaunting and the sound be -PRON- voice 
no sign above the gate proclaim 
here dwell nightmae nor 
through these portal pass the most incredible lifeform in the know universe 
there be no circus atmosphere 
just a nameless blending of sound and smell and alien vibration that stir the imagination like evil flame lick at forget folk memory 
on venus the term unearthly have naturally lose meaning but here be a hint of dreadful abyss beyond even the exotic fecundity of the cloudveile planet 
here be halfaudible chord beyond all the know octave 
here in the troubled darkness one sense symbol of instinct mind and feeling that man be never mean to know or understand 
here be the final question mark of tion whence and to what dreadful purpose 
what incredible virtuosity of the unknown creator have bring these unthinkable being into multiform existence 
and why 
what purpose do -PRON- serve in the plan of creation 
or be there any purpose 
be there even a plan 
bat ferri remember such thought from -PRON- lonely monastic youth on mar and during the schooling period on earth 
one have time for long unhappy thought in such a segregated childhood and some of -PRON- still reverberate deep inside -PRON- 
the girl draw back to let -PRON- enter flash the beam of a hand radilume on each in turn 
-PRON- glance flick each of -PRON- in examination sharp enough to draw blood 
-PRON- receive -PRON- in silence for mind be not on the duty of a hostess to unexpected guest 
wait here -PRON- order crisply 
then -PRON- go among the tangle avenue between cage and speak soothingly to the cage brute 
-PRON- voice crackle purr cough roar hiss 
the bird people be the first to heed 
-PRON- bright nervous chittering subside into occasional geyser of chirp 
surly sand leopard from mar pace -PRON- cage and vent sound like needle catch in the groove of antique disc recording 
partially gaseous life form from saturn have no vocal apparatus but show -PRON- uneasy displeasure by flare into sullen crimson and bruised purple of luminosity 
ferris follow the girl closely on -PRON- round -PRON- eye stare in wonder at the cage monster reveal when -PRON- light bathe the bar cubicle 
some cage be not cage in the ordinary sense at all 
behind barrier of stream light crouch protoplasmic entity of no set form 
moondog sport aimlessly in pool of ionize gas 
wireflie batter -PRON- against invisible net barrier 
complex mystery of plutonian lifeform float in magnetic field 
metallic crystal build -PRON- into corallike colony resemble miniature castle 
less outre creature inhabit the myriad of cellblock the ordinary and extraordinary variety of ape and cat and dog the bovine and marsupial the squeak rat and trumpeting elephant the endless specie of seacreature the treehaunter and the desert dweller the burrower and the flyer 
there be supposedly extinct saurian and example of tomorrow freak and mutant 
there be brute clown and tragedian 
there be but have be describe often enough in magazine article sometimes with tridimensional picture in color 
any reader so inclined may look into the back file of interplanetary magazine and stupefy -PRON- with the famous issue of july teucrete sense that -PRON- be follow but with pointed insolence ignore ferris and continue -PRON- round 
gradually -PRON- eerie tone bring calm to the multiform excitement of the compound 
-PRON- return eventually to pao chung and angel will take -PRON- back through the laboratory to the inner maze -PRON- say irritably move quietly and do not stumble in the dark 
some of the protection barrier be fragile and a few exist only in the mind of the creature in -PRON- 
if excite too much -PRON- can break through 
many be mankiller 
one mankiller run loose in here observed angel drily 
teucrete dispose of the intend compliment with a sneer 
pao chung have long have such idea 
through pressure on -PRON- father -PRON- have try to to buy or barter for -PRON- 
such disposal be -PRON- to make not -PRON- father 
i have -PRON- price but -PRON- be high 
-PRON- be evidence of more obvious charm that three masculine mind go into gear calculating resource 
teucrete laugh viciously 
the first item be pao head on a platinum platter platinum platter be not unobtainable say angel speculatively 
pao chung be not offend 
-PRON- chuckle unpleasantly 
such fire as -PRON- would bring a high price in the slave mart of yabn -PRON- say 
-PRON- head would bring more locally 
should -PRON- not move further from the gate 
a scanner could pierce several layer of metal as thin as this stockade 
perhaps i can bring -PRON- price down or -PRON- offer up 
but another occasion for bargaining would suit both of -PRON- well 
if tliere be other occasion for any of -PRON- ferris put in bitterly 
from outside come tire sound of many movement the rustle and clatter of quest man hoarse shout and a confusion of crowd sound 
above all like a thin thread of sound bind the other noise together be a high earpierce nervewracke drone 
angel flitter to the top of tire stockade and peer warily through the razoredged metal piling 
-PRON- swoop down to -PRON- companion with whisper verification of -PRON- suspicion 
the mechanical tracker -PRON- say 
perhaps there be still a deal open muttered pao chung 
-PRON- bow with sardonic malice toward teucrete 
-PRON- have one possession of great value than -PRON- head or -PRON- body 
-PRON- young friend here teucrete snort contemptuously 
-PRON- 
but -PRON- glance linger on ferris momentarily 
what do -PRON- mean 
ferris be a gammaman say pao chung 
even angel gasp with shock eye widen in incredulity horror and fear 
ill be a subtle poison 
-PRON- begin long ago in a small new mexico town long before there be gammaman or even interplanetary travel 
the fear radiate from mushroom cloud with impossible radiance at the core and the fear do more harm to the mind of man than the deadly spectra of invisible death do to -PRON- body 
-PRON- begin with scientist in cage in the name of national security -PRON- develop into continual surveillance for all man engage in atomic 
these worker and -PRON- family lead cloister monastic life 
-PRON- intermarry since there be little contact with outsider and -PRON- share generation of haunt spyridden life 
-PRON- live in the midst of fear and mistrust while the earth go through -PRON- chronic spiral of war and the preparation 
throughout history scholar and philosopher have warn that knowledge must be free and universal like sunlight 
but there have always be war and secret and guard weapon and fear be old than man 
scientist be man of dangerous knowledge of destructive potential 
as such -PRON- be hostage of fear and illusion of safety 
-PRON- be segregate guard wellfed and at first provide with all the deadly toy necessary to -PRON- amusement 
-PRON- be all painfully logical and futile but all the good brain of mankind be lock up to putrefy for lack of fresh air and the stimulus of mutual thought 
-PRON- knowledge and prerogative become hereditary 
natural law work against segregation 
artificial isolation of any group lead to misunderstanding prejudice resentment mutual fear and eventually to violence be a serpent devour -PRON- own tail 
in time the oncehonore and glorify gammaman become fear and hate 
in the mind of the ignorant and superstitious populace -PRON- be associate with medieval wizard and worker of dreadful miracle 
the threat of gamma group become a political pawn and be use as a club to beat down restless unhappy population 
with -PRON- knowledge and the popular delusion of -PRON- almost supernatural power -PRON- be easy enough for ambitious man to misuse the scientist 
in some case the gammaman -PRON- usurp authority but this noble experiment slip through -PRON- finger and -PRON- lose control from sheer unworldliness 
in trutli from the working of natural law the juice have run out of diem and -PRON- no longer understand the basic of normal human relation 
in a final paroxysm of public panic -PRON- be disarm -PRON- toy take away and every last gammaman imprison in carefully guard and isolated colony 
like the ancient indian -PRON- be place in reservation and keep there by force 
after this culminate outrage the gammaman lose heart for practical activity 
lock into -PRON- library -PRON- turn to abstraction and dabble in deadend philosophy most of -PRON- be querulous oldster hidebound by tradition -PRON- science now become a ritual religion -PRON- book exalt ts the word and -PRON- fade knowledge still hold secret for reason long forget 
not quite all gammaman accept this halflife allot to -PRON- 
there be sport avatar occasional throwback who rebel and go off reservation 
none of these actually run amuck but so great be the fearconditioning on one side and so difficult the adaptation to ordinary living on the other that there be painful accident and incident 
nothing genuinely monstrous occur but enough friction develop to keep alive and add to the public dreil of gammamen 
the term become a byword for nursery terror 
and in -PRON- turn the infant generation of gammaman learn to pity and despise the ignorant and corrupt multitude of normal humanity 
-PRON- lose contact with -PRON- human heritage 
in recent year few gammaman have break out to mingle with the expand race now people and colonize the frontier of the solar system 
those few be hunt down like outlaw and kill with brutal ingenuity 
but a new generation have come among gammaman with an urge so passionate and devout -PRON- -PRON- do not understand -PRON- 
either some latent folkmemory or some emotional mutation urge -PRON- to go forth and civilize mankind 
in the old book -PRON- track down knowledge and make grandiose plan for engineer the renaissance 
realize -PRON- common origin and longing for more nearly normal life -PRON- group together and make a pact to see some change make 
study history and the other technology of man -PRON- soon discover that social economic and psychological science have lag far behind the other development 
these be the blind spot of mankind and these lead to all the other serious and tragic misdirection of effort 
always the son of adam have struggle to achieve workable system and always these system have break down or fail at critical moment 
if some mean could be find eventually the mean be track down from a clue in one of the old book 
-PRON- be not find but -PRON- existence deduce and prove to the satisfaction of the searcher 
somewhere hide in a forget corner of the solar system be the miss tool 
this fact settle -PRON- become necessary to locate and use the miss tool 
-PRON- be a pitifully small generation 
only seven brighteyed and highhearte young man 
but that night -PRON- break out of -PRON- prescribed boundary 
-PRON- go off reservation and separate in seven direction 
each have a theory and a hope to be explore 
without -PRON- identarmband of platinum with the old greek letter deeply incised -PRON- resemble any other seven youth pick at random from the teem multitude 
-PRON- could mingle unquestioned and -PRON- study have prepare -PRON- for various task to whicli -PRON- forge paper entitle -PRON- 
but adaptation be not easy 
a single incautious moment could betray -PRON- 
even a routine brainwave check would be sufficient to identify the fugitive for in subtle way the gammaman be different 
seven young man with a noble purpose and fanatical hope in -PRON- heart 
and now there be two 
five of -PRON- have make fatal slip and have be hunt down to hideous death 
ferris be one of the two survivor -PRON- people stand paralyzed while the hammering resound at the gate 
this be no human fist demand attention but an odd robotlike clank as if a mechanical beast nose in determine root against the metal leave of the gate 
-PRON- be just such a beast 
a burring whine rise into note of shrill frustration 
metallic and electronic frustration for the tracker be a bloodhound of vacuum tube and relay and switch and battery and transformer 
unerring and inexorable -PRON- robot sense sort a single frequency from all other brain wave pattern and -PRON- clung to the trail with chill efficiency 
something about -PRON- unhuman lusting numb most quarry before the pursuer in charge of the monster could check -PRON- demonic eagerness for prey 
now like a metallic carnivore scent blood the robot tracker nuzzle the gate and rebound to nuzzle gain 
all four of the human inside the compound imagine the scene outside 
pencil beam of hand radilume glint here and there the quest soldier and police squad the glitter serpentine body of the tracker with -PRON- scurrying tread churn cloud of dust as -PRON- whine and root at the gate 
bat ferri shoot a glance of uneasy calculation at -PRON- three companion 
the girl be an unknown quantity 
angel momentarily shocked be predictable enough within limit 
pao chung be openly an opportunist willing to turn any situation to personal profit 
unarmed ferris could not even deal with -PRON- let alone with the police outside 
-PRON- frown angrily stare hold on -PRON- for a moment as if puzzle 
-PRON- eye move on focus on angel then pao chung 
presently -PRON- come back to ferris amuse and faintly mocking 
what be a gammaman do here -PRON- ask 
an interesting question say pao chung ironically 
but not of prime importance at the moment 
ferri watch a smile writhe on the girl lip and feel a quick relief 
-PRON- may help if only to thwart pao idea of throw -PRON- to the human wolf outside 
a harsh voice clamor for admittance 
the animal be grow restive again 
an earthy bellow boom out against a counterpoint of birdlike trill 
the sand leopard cough guttural warning 
somewhere a pygmy elephant trumpet and the giant insect burst into deafen clatter 
teucrete motion for silence then draw the bolt and hold the gate ajar on -PRON- short chain there -PRON- demand roughly 
police several voice explain 
open the gate or well break -PRON- down 
have -PRON- a warrant a security matter someone explain hopefully 
tell that to the animal -PRON- storm as much as -PRON- life worth to come in here tonight upset already and i canot control -PRON- if -PRON- keep up this noise 
go away 
an authoritative voice bluster 
this be an important matter 
let -PRON- talk to -PRON- father 
teucrete shrug 
-PRON- will be back by noon tomorrow 
come then and bring a warrant to search 
or -PRON- follow die speech with some insulting suggestion not in the good of tascc 
the authoritative voice turn into a gargle address a slam gate 
profanity do not disturb the tracker which continue to root noisily at the metal 
teucrete shove bolt into socket and stand back 
-PRON- sigh and beckon the three man to follow -PRON- 
-PRON- move amid a nightmarish cacophony of sound 
in memory rouse by the various element of the uproar 
bat ferri revisit the far planet 
fortunately the light be too dim to see all the source of sound but ferris mentally identify many of the cage dweller by ear or by nose 
wriggler from the mercury mine of callisto 
venusian swamp slug and grullcat from the tihar forest from the honeycombed cavern of triton 
wireflie and needleflie know by -PRON- eerie humming and buzz batnose from the twilight zone of mercury 
iceworm from neptune and pluto and the deadly windharp from mar 
amiably imbecilic moondog from the satellite of saturn press blank flat face against the wall of -PRON- insulate glass tank 
monster out of nightmare 
a madman miscellany 
there be more an incredible infinity of animal horizon 
but imagination reel back and description falter 
wliat word can catalog the fringe of morphology erris focusse -PRON- interest on the girl 
teucrete 
a strange name and as strange a being as these -PRON- live among 
-PRON- wonder idly about -PRON- racial background 
-PRON- father origin be a mystery and who could say what mate -PRON- have find on fecund venus 
be -PRON- daughter one of those halfhuman mutant or be -PRON- just what -PRON- seem a wilful and badly raise human girl 
ferris could only guess and await further evidence of -PRON- intention toward -PRON- 
but -PRON- like the way -PRON- walk 
tall straight slender 4s a spear and as poise 
pride be in -PRON- and a hint of warped character in -PRON- frigid disdain of weakness or fear 
physically but ferris be no authority on feminine beauty 
on the reservation woman have be scarce most of -PRON- neurotic virgin or old 
-PRON- have know woman since but mostly the hard cynical opportunist of the planetary frontier boomtown 
none to share a life with 
vast perspective of cage and tank and pressure vat go off in all direction 
-PRON- would not have imagine so much area cover by the establishment 
-PRON- seem limitless and all -PRON- dimension be oddly confusing 
intentionally so since -PRON- be lay out in kbyrinthine fashion 
unguide a stranger could lose -PRON- in a matter of minute 
-PRON- defy belief that a of such colossal proportion could exist within the precinct of a city even such a sprawl megalopolis as castarona 
but at last -PRON- be through tlie cage area which line the periphery of the compound and teucrete lead the man into a building of dazzle white stone 
-PRON- father kboratory -PRON- explain 
here -PRON- synthesize food for the animal and try with all -PRON- ingenuity to provide an approximate environment for -PRON- 
-PRON- voice bring ferris back to the present 
-PRON- wonot work -PRON- say 
security squad will never wait for a warrant 
even if -PRON- do what good be half an hour break down -PRON- gate and swarm through here like hunt bee 
teucrete laugh scornfully 
afraid gammaman 
if i be i wouldnot be here 
but only a fool refuse to recognize danger 
relax -PRON- advise 
-PRON- will break in true 
but there may be a little difficulty find -PRON- way among the cage 
-PRON- be a maze as -PRON- see 
and the animal will give -PRON- some trouble 
i be not forget the tracker but the moondog and wireflie can confuse anything that operate on electronic 
all -PRON- need be a slight delay action 
-PRON- can count on that 
there be another exit ask pao chung eagerly 
-PRON- laugh crystallize in tinkle fragment like shower shard of glass 
another exit yes 
the way -PRON- father go when -PRON- hunt 
if -PRON- have the nerve to take -PRON- 
but compose -PRON- pao chung 
-PRON- will need supply of food water air special clothing 
and there be a price 
hesitantly unhappily pao chung inquire the price 
the way be dangerous -PRON- say rapidly 
-PRON- may not come back 
and i must see that -PRON- father be protect 
give -PRON- an order on -PRON- bank or lawyer for all the evidence -PRON- have against -PRON- for whatever crime or stupidity -PRON- may have commit 
how do -PRON- know such an order will be honor 
pao chung mutter speculatively 
once i be free the girl toss -PRON- head till the bell of ebony hair swing dangerously 
-PRON- have well be honor -PRON- warn crisply 
for there be only one way back if -PRON- ever come back 
and i can control -PRON- 
i donot think -PRON- will like -PRON- surrounding well enough to remain there indefinitely 
pao chung bow to the inevitable 
angel chuckle moodily and bat ferris face teucrete with admiration on -PRON- pleasantly ugly feature 
well do -PRON- praise 
be there a price for -PRON- 
no price to a man who like animal 
i sense that in -PRON- as -PRON- pass the cage 
impulsively the girl lean toward ferris and force -PRON- lip violently on -PRON- 
that be for luck gammaman 
on the house but the next one may cost -PRON- dearly 
watch -PRON- 
ferris clung to the sanctuary of masculine silence 
pao chung glower sullenly and amusement send iridiscent ripple glint from -PRON- wing 
how about -PRON- -PRON- demand 
no kiss no price -PRON- tell -PRON- but a word of advice mutant 
keep those wing out of revolve door 
angel grin happily -PRON- gargoyle face wrinkle into impossible contortion 
-PRON- be a nuisance 
newly garb and equip the man follow teucrete from the building 
stop to stuff pao order into a some feminine idea of a safetyvault not too safe in the company of lecherous male teucrete conduct -PRON- charge through a lovely formal garden that function by conceal hydroponic and on into another build up area 
but this be no cubicle of stone or steel or plastic 
-PRON- be a roofless structure of glass 
vertical panel of glass run off beyond sight 
panel of all color all degree of transparency 
some be as lucid as crystal some barely translucent and more bent or mirror to distort reflect or refract light 
all be tint some weakly other violently stain 
the place be stridently illuminate by conceal radiflood 
-PRON- be a solid mass of rainbow effect a forest of crystal mirror and shaft and flicker glow prism 
one enter by a kind of airlock or more accurately a lightlock 
there be no change in atmospheric pressure but the density and beat force of sheer luminosity increase by square and cube as the traveller stride through link cube of glass 
-PRON- enter the light maze 
dazzle splendor beat upon -PRON- 
vision be overwhelm by visible vibration 
-PRON- drown in light touch anything warn exact alignment be important 
-PRON- stop before a keyboard like the console of a gigantic organ 
behind -PRON- rise mass rank of vacuum tube all glow humming flickering 
the girl finger skip nimbly on the key and note of sound rise in tinkle chiming spray from the shaft 
color storm and rage in the crystalline forest run up and down the visible octave of light 
one sense other scale beyond in both upper and low wavelength 
glass panel and crystal shaft vibrate to sound and light like tune fork 
-PRON- stir quiver vanish then reappear 
a tall man appear among the shaft and stride toward the traveller 
khaljean say pao chung nervously 
-PRON- be sufficient introduction 
there be uncanny resemblance between father and daughter like two match painting in different key 
the animal man listen quietly while teucrete explain the situation 
-PRON- look at pao chung and laugh 
-PRON- shrug bargain be a bargain say khaljean 
perhaps i should go back to venus and fabricate some gnaw bone to convince the police search party that the animal devour -PRON- 
all of -PRON- have better remain here and wait till i send for -PRON- 
-PRON- be good at fake evidence pao chung jibe bitterly 
in a good cause yes agree khaljean goodnaturedly 
even in a bad cause this time 
stay here 
-PRON- will be safe 
wait order ferris 
klialjean measure -PRON- mockingly 
who be -PRON- to say be a gammaman ferris tell -PRON- 
that doesnot frighten -PRON- youngster 
so be or be 
do -PRON- know the name djevos barian 
ferris blink 
but barian be hunt down and kill -PRON- remain positively identify 
khaljean smile 
as pao chung say i be good at fake evidence 
i always have a skill with synthetic 
a man thing i create live long enough to be slaughter in -PRON- place and i have construct -PRON- well even to duplicate -PRON- fingerprint and brain pattern 
officially i be dead 
but ten year ago pao chung find out about -PRON- 
-PRON- have bleed -PRON- systematically ever since 
until now 
shall i kill -PRON- for -PRON- ask angel with malicious joy in the thought 
now that -PRON- have access to -PRON- evidence -PRON- life can be only a menace to -PRON- 
khaljean frowned donot believe in kill 
but sometimes pao chung have tempt -PRON- 
no let -PRON- live 
so -PRON- be barian say ferri admiringly 
be barian 
i have become khaljean 
the real one be a smalltime operator deal chiefly in dead animal 
i be with -PRON- when -PRON- die 
-PRON- be much alike in appearance 
with plastic surgery i become khaljean 
and i have make the name famous 
-PRON- must be one of the seven recent escapee from the reservation 
-PRON- will have much to talk about later 
not later insist ferris 
now 
where do this maze lead 
khaljean humor -PRON- 
nowhere or anywhere a dimensional short cut that can take -PRON- to any place in the solar universe or even a few odd place in adjacent or parallel spacetime continuums 
be there somewhere -PRON- want to go 
ferris nod soberly place i must go 
now if possible 
why 
khaljean study the young man grimly not sure -PRON- could understand since -PRON- leave the gamma reservation so long ago try to explain 
somewhere there be a tool 
not tliat exactly nor a machine either but -PRON- call -PRON- that for lack of a term 
in the old book of -PRON- library there be mention of -PRON- 
a description with a hint of property 
-PRON- be something alien a control place on the destiny of groupman 
-PRON- voice drone on speak as if the subject be a lesson -PRON- have learn by rote 
many time man social and political organization have painfully climb the ladder toward a workable civilized system but always -PRON- have slip and fall back 
the individual mind function well for the most part but not so the groupmind 
any crowd less honest less cient and far less intelligent than -PRON- individual unit 
the large the crowd the great the tangent the possibility for evil and injustice 
in attempt to solve the problem of group relationship man be bad than pitiful 
long study have convince the gammapeople that this be not a mere accident 
outside influence warp men think in group warp social and political organization 
-PRON- seem as if groupman struggle hopefully to put together a complex jigsaw puzzle in which many part will fit badly into an infinity of possible relationship 
the true fit be difficult to find but even the law of average should help in so many attempt 
time and time again just as the puzzle be nearly complete someone joggle the puzzler elbow and the pattern be destroy 
there be such a joggler such an outside influence 
-PRON- existence be prove -PRON- influence even measure 
there be clue scatter through the old book 
-PRON- know what -PRON- be what -PRON- look like how -PRON- operate but -PRON- have be powerless to counteract -PRON- influence 
the warp hypnotic broadcast keep throw mankind back to chaos when utopia be in sight 
-PRON- be too strong to combat and the source must be destroy 
by -PRON- solemn pact -PRON- six friend and i bind -PRON- to locate and smash this alien mechanism lick -PRON- lip reflectively 
-PRON- interest -PRON- -PRON- admit be once young enough to be idealistic -PRON- 
what be this alien monster -PRON- describe 
not a monster in the ordinary sense 
not a tool nor quite even a machine 
live jewel perhaps 
at least radioactive false gem 
gas probably radon solidify under the incredible pressure in the heart of jupiter 
solar know about -PRON- for -PRON- be see once and even handle by man 
there be an article about -PRON- in the encyclopaedia of the solar planet 
in -PRON- be discover mine by cybernetic machinery 
then on -PRON- way to mar the ship carry the jewel be sabotage and wreck 
wreckage and frozen body be discover on the rogue asteroid hidalgo but the jewel be miss 
pao chung have show grow interest in the conversation 
-PRON- break in to ask steal 
steal perhaps 
possibly -PRON- disintegrate at the time of the wreck or -PRON- may have transmute into something unrecognize by the searcher 
-PRON- may have become tenuous enough to sink through the surface of hidalgo and recrystallize inside 
but the evil influence continue 
-PRON- believe that -PRON- be still there still in existence work -PRON- hide evil warp the brain of man produce social and political chaos 
five of -PRON- friend have lose -PRON- life search for this menace 
possibly the sixth be dead too since -PRON- vanish into the unknown and have not be hear from try -PRON- 
angel and i land on hidalgo and search carefully 
but hidalgo be off limit for spaceman 
solar survey send the space patrol after -PRON- and -PRON- flee before finish -PRON- search 
-PRON- be chase to mar trace and hunt to venus 
-PRON- crash there and while i try to get money for new equipment angel get involve with pao chung 
-PRON- know the rest 
now -PRON- see why i must go to hidalgo 
khaljean shake -PRON- head in sorrow understand 
but -PRON- could never find -PRON- way through the maze 
ferris accuse -PRON- with fanatical eye 
-PRON- could help -PRON- to find -PRON- way 
not i be too old and i be not sure that i approve of -PRON- meddling 
not that i would try to stop -PRON- but donot count on help from -PRON- 
how do -PRON- know that this alien machine be what -PRON- say 
-PRON- purpose may be good not evil 
some high intelligence may have place -PRON- in -PRON- system as a and bank on health and wealth stop the expensive smoking habit without any further delay 
consider how much go up in smoke each week think of the countless thing that extra money will buy break the smoking habit break -PRON- safely quickly and permanently be an imitation cigarette that need no light 
-PRON- contain a crystallise compound that satisfie and eliminate the craving 
kegd 
mark dear sir i receive -PRON- a morrtb ago and i be now convinced of -PRON- claim for hove not smoke a cigarette since and be save about 25 a week 
bacup lanc 
dear sir after receive -PRON- i hove not smoke any cigarette at all 
i be smoke a day be now well in health mentally and physically 
the craving have cease 
i can not express in word -PRON- gratitude and thank 
middlesbrough 
dear sir many thank for immediately -PRON- arrive i use -PRON- and from then onwards have have no desire to smoke wish have send for one twenty year ago rochdale 
dear sir i do not think -PRON- be passible to stop smoke have an three month ago and never bother about a smoke now hove lose that morning cough 
alashom york 
dear sir -PRON- be three month since i receive -PRON- and be giad to report the result 
i have not touch a cigarette since 
cough completely go -PRON- health greatly improve be never break now in fact i can save per week thank to -PRON- wonderful remedy 
manchest dear sir please accept -PRON- thank be a definite cure for the smoking habit 
i receive -PRON- six month ago leed 
send a stamped and address envelope for full particular free advice and proof dept governor to influence mankind to shield man from -PRON- own folly 
-PRON- may be a warning road sign to keep -PRON- from crash into a dead end 
-PRON- utopias sound very dull to -PRON- -PRON- may easily be a dead end for mankind 
i like the interesting and amusing variation of chaos so let -PRON- cling to -PRON- 
follow -PRON- destiny if -PRON- will 
i wonot stop -PRON- 
ferris look pitifully young but -PRON- stand -PRON- ground with absurd pride and courage 
right or wrong i must try -PRON- say evenly 
and i wonot grant the right of alien interference 
man too have a right to work out -PRON- destiny good or bad 
angel speak up eagerly for -PRON- partner wonot say i know what -PRON- be talk about and maybe too stupid and ignorant to understand 
but as a victim of chaos i donot appreciate -PRON- 
pao chung sneer 
one vote for law and order from the fallen angel if -PRON- can be believe 
like khaljean -PRON- preference be for chaos as -PRON- furnish more opportunity for a man of -PRON- interest 
however -PRON- soul revolt at this talk of destroy gem of presumably unique property 
-PRON- must have value 
perhaps -PRON- can dismantle this machine without harm -PRON- part 
as a business man with time on -PRON- hand i would like to go with -PRON- and see if something can be arrange donot trust -PRON- ferris say frankly 
and i donot believe that the jewel can be salvage 
come along if -PRON- want 
i canot stop -PRON- 
but donot tr any trick 
pao chung accept the warning with bland indifference 
father call teucrete 
leave -PRON- -PRON- protective suiting 
khaljean smile with sad irony 
be -PRON- make choice 
yes go with -PRON- 
i know the way 
i can control the ma2e and guide -PRON- safely back 
i donot know if i believe in this fabulous machine or jewelsor whatever 
but i think i may learn to believe in in -PRON- something have to find out 
smile khaljean strip off -PRON- protective armor and yield -PRON- to the girl 
as an afterthought -PRON- hand -PRON- -PRON- blaster 
the choice be yours to make 
but in such company the blaster may come in handy 
khaljean shake hand with ferris and angel though -PRON- avoid look at pao chung 
to ferris -PRON- say come back if -PRON- can 
and look after -PRON- girl 
in the meantime throw some gnaw bone to the police wolf and well manufacture a new identity for -PRON- 
without a farewell khaljean strode into the crystalline forest 
-PRON- lonely figure pause to wave 
good hunt father teucrete call after -PRON- 
-PRON- trip key at the console 
light quiver in painful vibration 
-PRON- figure become transparent then dissolve 
teucrete climb into the suit of protective armor 
ferris help -PRON- zip up the clumsy garment then clasp -PRON- arm impulsively havenot the skill to say -PRON- properly but thank expect -PRON- skill to improve with experience -PRON- say irritably fix the blaster gun securely in -PRON- spring clip 
return to the console teucrete work out an elaborate composition on the key 
tube flare and flicker flamed and fade 
there be the humming and the belltone clamor like glass raindrop spattering on a ceramic floor 
-PRON- have arrive -PRON- whisper 
-PRON- be then pao chung act uick as a striking snake -PRON- move close beside the girt and snatch the blaster from -PRON- clip 
back away -PRON- wave the weapon in wide sweep to menace both ferri and angel at once 
teucrete turn and cry out 
angel freeze like a statue 
ferris start a rush then think well of -PRON- 
new deal i think say pao chung brutally 
from here on give the order 
angel chuckle ferociously 
-PRON- canot get both of -PRON- pao chung 
if -PRON- rush at once -PRON- can kill one but the other will get to -PRON- try -PRON- warn pao chung sweating but deadly 
-PRON- keep talk of deal continue angel evenly 
better make one with -PRON- 
for the girl and a third of the loot talk business with -PRON- want -PRON- -PRON- croak pao chung 
neither of -PRON- will get -PRON- alive say teucrete 
ferri move a little and the gun hold steadily on -PRON- 
-PRON- hesitate glance curiously at angel 
light glint from quiver wing 
the gargoyle face grin hideously 
heavy eyelid blink in remember signal 
now snap ferris 
ferris and angel leap like two move part of the same machine 
angel be quick 
-PRON- powerful wing waft -PRON- in a long swift bind 
the blaster swerve flamed burst in deafen explosion 
a reek of char disintegrating flesh and singe feather fill the air 
angel shriek in torment as -PRON- leg vanish in crumble ashe 
wing flail -PRON- body a maim and blast horror -PRON- crash down upon pao chung 
the gun jerk from nerveless finger and clatter on the floor 
-PRON- beam cut a tinkling swathe among the crystal shaft 
real droplet of halfmolten crystal strike myriad belltone in fall 
writhe and threshing in agony angel clung to -PRON- desperate purpose 
powerful clawlike hand circle pao head and wrench -PRON- off 
the head roll free like a ball as two snarl body sag together in bloody horror 
stricken ferris bent over -PRON- friend try hopelessly to help 
the gargoyle lip part 
dry husk of sound whistle from -PRON- 
go cn 
smash the machine 
but first do this job right for -PRON- 
tremble ferris recover the blaster gun cut down -PRON- intensity then thrust the blunt muzzle deep into the striped fur where rich crimson now mingle with the other gaudy dye 
blink -PRON- eye shut -PRON- press the stud 
angel writhe and be go 
ferris do not look back 
hand in hand with teucrete -PRON- walk slowly toward the forest of crystal shaft 
there be much damage and -PRON- heart quail from the task ahead 
can -PRON- still find the way -PRON- ask numbly not sure the girl falter not sure -PRON- can ever get back 
exact alignment be so terribly important 
-PRON- can try say ferris grimly 
hand in hand young man and woman with the dream still fresh within -PRON- will always seek the ultimate answer to the ultimate question 
-PRON- may be of course that there be no ultimate answer and that even the quest be a delusion 
but teucrete and ferris with the flame of a new love burn fiercely between -PRON- believe that -PRON- be important to find and destroy some alien thing that warp men mind 
other may think only of ouilde a life together as a pledge to the future but not teucrete and ferris 
time for that later -PRON- hope 
for the moment -PRON- may just possibly make mankind tomorrow a little bright or more hopeful 
hand in hand -PRON- walk together to the crystal maze and enter 
perhaps -PRON- find something 
famous classic of the fighting west max ft be on sale at -PRON- bookstall 9d 
by from out beyond the second sun -PRON- come a fugitive from a dead and sterile world seek solace friend a home on earth a planet of even great terror -PRON- sensation of which -PRON- be most conscious be that of loneliness 
-PRON- be no longer very much afraid and sometimes -PRON- even think that -PRON- enemy back home be no longer hunt for -PRON- 
but in the midst of these strange creature -PRON- learn that there be one thing bad than open hostility and that be indifference 
-PRON- have no more interest in -PRON- than -PRON- have in each other and even though -PRON- indifference increase -PRON- own chance for safety -PRON- be a chilling thing none the less 
-PRON- know that though -PRON- be like -PRON- superficially -PRON- be intensely different within 
-PRON- stand at a street corner try to fathom the difference while the crowd surge about -PRON- buffet -PRON- from side to side 
-PRON- seem to have no idea of personal dignity 
-PRON- still understand -PRON- language only imperfectly and speak -PRON- with difficulty but -PRON- have learn in a primitive way to read -PRON- face and during this time of day at least -PRON- face tola of a strain and fear all -PRON- own of an uncertainty even great than -PRON- 
-PRON- be go home from work and -PRON- be afraid of countless trifle that something unpleasant may happen that -PRON- may not get seat on -PRON- conveyance that bad news may greet -PRON- when -PRON- arrive 
-PRON- stare with fascination at a heap of newspaper spread out on the corner stand 
-PRON- could guess the purpose of these layer of white sheet cover with black or red symbol but -PRON- could not yet interpret -PRON- and -PRON- have no idea whether any one have see or report -PRON- ship 
-PRON- be almost certain that some one have observe a shooting star but the chance be very much against any observation have be make of the star slow dark drift to earth 
at any rate -PRON- have conceal -PRON- ship among the growth of tall native plant and some day -PRON- would find time to repair the relatively minor damage -PRON- have sustain and continue -PRON- journey 
meanwhile -PRON- have to make up -PRON- mind what to do here 
-PRON- original store of food have be exhaust a week before as these creature count time and despite the fact that -PRON- metabolic requirement be low -PRON- have long need to eat again 
the food that be exhibit in many store be of a kind strange to -PRON- but from the very structure and behavior of individual who eat -PRON- -PRON- know that -PRON- be of the right chemical composition 
examine -PRON- cautiously with a small analyzer hold close to -PRON- eye -PRON- note that at least -PRON- contain none of the more dangerous poison 
-PRON- would do if -PRON- could obtain -PRON- 
but -PRON- must obtain -PRON- in a manner that these creature consider legal not as -PRON- have obtain -PRON- clothe 
-PRON- recall how absurdly different -PRON- own clothe have be construct to fit a creature whose morphology be so much unlike -PRON- 
-PRON- have take over a suit from a man -PRON- have meet drive on a dark country road not too close to the ship 
-PRON- have stop the car and put the man to sleep without difficult but there must have be a great outcry after -PRON- victim have awaken to find -PRON- cold and naked in the driver seat 
-PRON- hadnot minded for -PRON- have already leave the place where the incident have occur 
but -PRON- want no hue and cry raise here 
although under other condition -PRON- would have mind -PRON- hostility no more than -PRON- indifference -PRON- know that hostility now may very seriously limit -PRON- freedom to act 
-PRON- list the thing -PRON- have to do 
-PRON- have to find food and shelter learn -PRON- language and custom and as quickly as possible -PRON- alphabet 
-PRON- have to acquire -PRON- manner of thought and feeling so well that -PRON- could blend with -PRON- not only superficially but psychologically as well 
-PRON- have to a shoulder catch -PRON- on the chest and spin -PRON- half around 
a rough voice more a snarl than anything else say whatsa matter ya blind 
the way the word be run together confuse -PRON- but -PRON- have listen keenly and -PRON- know the phrase that be require in such situation 
-PRON- say politely but almost unintelligently excuse 
i sorry 
foreigner huh 
why donot ya go back where ya come from 
this be the first person who have speak to -PRON- in -PRON- new world 
the encounter leave -PRON- angry and contemptuous but -PRON- be not to be long before -PRON- learn that the individual -PRON- have be privilege to meet be not wholly typical 
-PRON- move along alert to observe and to learn but entirely without aim so far as an ultimate destination be concern 
-PRON- note that the nature of the street -PRON- traverse change subtly with every intersection 
the primitive but well construct building that have line -PRON- soon give way to even more primitive dilapidated and filthy structure 
-PRON- be dear that -PRON- have rich and poor here and that -PRON- be approadie the dwelling of the poor 
-PRON- hear a rhythmic sound in the street as of a percussion instrument and follow -PRON- find a female of the prevail specie dress somewhat diiferently from the other female and pound on a hollow cylinder of fairly large diameter 
other more pierce instrument add sound of -PRON- own and then voice be lift in song 
-PRON- linger fascinate and wish only that -PRON- have a soundrecorder to take permanent note of the strange music 
-PRON- be not the only one who linger 
half a dozen dilapidate male have gather attract like -PRON- by the rhytiimic noise and after a female have end a strange exhortation which -PRON- do not fully understand -PRON- all follow the company of musician into a ramshackle building 
inside -PRON- listen to other exhortation and then have food thrust upon -PRON- 
-PRON- be a bowl of soup the first nutrient of this strange planet that -PRON- have eat 
the taste as well as the quick ocular analysis -PRON- make indicate that -PRON- be deficient in many of the chemical that -PRON- need for -PRON- own nutrition but at least -PRON- have energy value and -PRON- imbibe -PRON- slowly and thoughtfully 
when -PRON- have finish -PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- want more but -PRON- say politely no thank 
the young woman who have offer -PRON- to -PRON- say oh -PRON- be a refugee i suppose 
drive out of -PRON- native country 
-PRON- nod -PRON- have any friend here 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head and say no thank too bad 
-PRON- look as if -PRON- hadnot eat for a long time 
-PRON- face be awfully thin 
yes thin 
-PRON- do not explain that for a member of -PRON- race -PRON- be not thin at all -PRON- name please 
name 
what 
how do people call -PRON- 
kayin 
-PRON- name kayin 
kane rather a strange name for a foreigner 
well donot worry mr kane well take care of -PRON- 
-PRON- attitude help erase the hostile encounter of an hour before 
when -PRON- finally show -PRON- a cot one of a row on which many man be already stretch out -PRON- try to reconcile the contradictory kind of behavior -PRON- have meet and decide that the psychology of this race would prove more complicated than -PRON- have at first believe 
the cot be extremely inconvenient but somehow -PRON- manage to stretch out on -PRON- like the other 
-PRON- sleep little and in the morning when -PRON- awake -PRON- be with strained muscle and a sense of fatigue but -PRON- be eager to see more of the world on which -PRON- find -PRON- and -PRON- leave the next day to continue -PRON- wandering 
during the hour that follow -PRON- cover many mile of ground 
with ear and mind open -PRON- pick up more and more word and by evening -PRON- be fairly confident in -PRON- ability to make -PRON- understand in almost any situation 
-PRON- go hungry that day but in the evening -PRON- sleep much more comfortably at the foot of an old tree on a vacant lot 
far above -PRON- could see the star from which -PRON- have come 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- impersonally for a short time wonder whether -PRON- would see -PRON- own planet again 
then -PRON- fall into a halfsleep one that rest -PRON- though still leave -PRON- sense partly alert 
-PRON- be become more accustomed to the rather short rhythm of the planet and -PRON- awake at the first faint sign of daylight before anyone have notice -PRON- 
that day -PRON- encounter group of man congregate about dingy little building on a dingy street 
-PRON- find that -PRON- be seek employment and know that the good way to learn about a strange race be to study the manner in which the people work -PRON- join one of the group 
but there be not a single occupation with regard to which -PRON- could claim experience and -PRON- be hire finally to do heavy but unskilled labor at eighty cent an hour 
the work be more difficult for -PRON- than for the other 
-PRON- look like -PRON- but -PRON- have muscle which -PRON- simply do not possess 
-PRON- be so clumsy at lift rock that another man with whom -PRON- be work say finally in exasperation -PRON- ever lift anything before 
look pal do -PRON- like this 
bend at the knee see -PRON- like this no -PRON- be do -PRON- all wrong 
i a nuisance -PRON- may even be dangerous to be stare at so closely 
the fact be that -PRON- knee simply would not bend as human knee do 
-PRON- be joint in quite another fashion and no surface similarity could conceal the fact that in action there be all the difference of two world between -PRON- 
-PRON- say sorry 
i injure 
oh canot bend -PRON- huh 
this be no job for -PRON- pal 
be strange 
know not what else 
yeah -PRON- tough 
-PRON- return to -PRON- work again this time warm by the other sympathy and less uneasy about be observe 
and as -PRON- work -PRON- think sardonically of what -PRON- would think on -PRON- home planet if -PRON- know 
-PRON- be sure that -PRON- enemy would have roar with laughter 
here be kayin the one -PRON- have fear for -PRON- brilliant mind for -PRON- knowledge of science for -PRON- practical skill 
-PRON- have outwit -PRON- with the odd on -PRON- side -PRON- be true drive -PRON- a hunted creature past strange star and force -PRON- to come to ground again in the guise of one of the mean of a mean and unintelligent race 
and even in the humble position to which -PRON- have be reduce -PRON- could not hold up -PRON- end of the work 
-PRON- clench -PRON- jaw grimly at the thought and the very motion make -PRON- realize that in no way be -PRON- like the other that even so simple a matter as the number and shape of -PRON- tooth may give -PRON- away 
unintelligent as -PRON- be once -PRON- take the trouble to look with some care -PRON- would know a creature who be not one of -PRON- 
on the second day of work -PRON- do arouse suspicion but at first not from the other worker 
the creature that bare -PRON- tooth and bark at -PRON- be a dog 
for a time kayin find the animal attention embarrassing 
-PRON- throw a stone at the beast but -PRON- run only a short distance and stop to bark again 
-PRON- have an idea of what the trouble be 
that day -PRON- have replace -PRON- worn trouser by a new and baggy pair of overall not yet saturate with the scent of human being and the dog have notice -PRON- own faint but strange odor 
now -PRON- be make a nuisance of -PRON- and draw everyone attention to -PRON- 
that mutt donot like -PRON- mac say a foreman who pass by 
funny about dog the way -PRON- bark at some people someone laugh 
kayin throw another stone but the beast dodge and continue to bark 
-PRON- audience be grow now and skin begin to twitch nervously in a way that -PRON- may have draw an audience if -PRON- have be in a mood to notice such detail of behavior pat cat this morning -PRON- say apologetically 
crazy dog smell cat 
-PRON- would have -PRON- all stare at -PRON- if this go on much longer and -PRON- know that -PRON- have to act quickly 
look around -PRON- -PRON- spy a compress air hose lie on the ground 
-PRON- pick -PRON- up turn on the air and direct the nozzle at the dog 
the blast knock the animal head over heel and send -PRON- howl on -PRON- way 
everyone laugh and kayin turn back to -PRON- work in relief 
but from now on -PRON- know that -PRON- must wear no new clothe 
as the work progress -PRON- attention turn from the immediate task at hand and -PRON- begin to wonder what -PRON- purpose be 
there seem to be hundred of man all engage in menial task all part of some great overall plan 
-PRON- begin to wonder too if people who could make such plan could be so unintelligent as -PRON- have first assume 
or be -PRON- simply that -PRON- intelligence have not develop that -PRON- lack the background of science to make the most of -PRON- mind to use the resource -PRON- planet possess 
a rough voice almost the twin of that first rough voice of two day before growl hey -PRON- wake up and get movin 
whaddya think -PRON- be gettin pay for 
-PRON- swing -PRON- pick without look up 
the foreman have no idea that the tall foreigner -PRON- know as kane be stare at -PRON- curiously with tiny camouflaged eye that quite literally grow in the back of the strangely shaped head try to understand what make the human being tick 
by the end of a week kayin be confident that -PRON- know the language well enough to start read -PRON- 
-PRON- go to a public sdiool which -PRON- find be open in the evening and there join a class where someone explain the alphabet and make clear to foreigner that english be a language full of trap and pitfall 
kayin absorb the information eagerly but after the third lesson -PRON- find the pace much too slow and do not return 
-PRON- have never before encounter a language of so strange a structure and the adual making of the sound give -PRON- trouble but the basic principle of language study be as valid here as on -PRON- home planet and -PRON- learn rapidly 
by the end of a month -PRON- could read 
by the end of the same month -PRON- have learn too the nature of the project on which -PRON- be work 
on several occasion the engineer in charge have pass by -PRON- to exchange a few word with the foreman and once with the man who have order the building 
the word have be significant 
there could be no mistake for kayin have come across -PRON- in -PRON- reading 
laboratory have a very definite meaning 
and there be such expression as incubation tank and thermostat control 
all in all enough to let -PRON- know that -PRON- be engage in construct a plant for the manufacture of biochemical substance 
-PRON- know that there be biochemical plant already in existence scatter over the civilized part of the planet and the thought of great danger do not occur to -PRON- 
but -PRON- continue as the man around -PRON- would have put -PRON- to keep -PRON- ear open and as time go on -PRON- become more and more disquiet eanwhile -PRON- relation with the people amon whom -PRON- work become almost human 
-PRON- greet -PRON- every day as one of -PRON- ask casual question about the place from which -PRON- have come and the way -PRON- have live and accept the answer as if with a quiet confidence that -PRON- be tell the truth 
once in an access of good feeling one of -PRON- have go so far as to slap -PRON- amicably on the shoulder and kayin have experience agony such as -PRON- have never feel before 
but -PRON- manage to conceal the pain and even to laugh weakly 
-PRON- make sure however that a similar incident would never happen again 
whenever someone approach -PRON- too closely -PRON- open -PRON- extra eye very slightly ready to step aside at the touch of a too friendly hand 
-PRON- have not realize how much -PRON- own attitude toward -PRON- have change until the day an accident occur 
a large shelf of rock have unexpectedly turn up to block the excavation of a wide pit and -PRON- have be necessary to shatter -PRON- with dynamite 
but the explosive do not at first go off and one of the man have go back to see what be wrong 
-PRON- have be just in time to be knock down by the blast -PRON- and to be cover by the mass of dirt and broken rock that slide into the excavation 
-PRON- be kayin who run for -PRON- first dig frantically away at the smother mass without regard for the fragment that continue to rain down upon -PRON- 
and after -PRON- have reach the man who be unconscious but still breathe -PRON- be kayin who have wonder why on this earth -PRON- have take the risk for the sake of a creature who mean so little to -PRON- 
there be other risk as well -PRON- find when -PRON- summon a doctor to treat the injured man and someone suggest that kayin have be injure too 
but kayin quickly shrug off the idea that -PRON- need treatment and go back at once to -PRON- work 
-PRON- want no doctor discover what unusual arm and leg and internal organ -PRON- have 
in the day that follow -PRON- continue to wonder at -PRON- 
work together with these man -PRON- have change 
but -PRON- must be careful -PRON- know not to change too far 
-PRON- have only -PRON- be certain to see -PRON- as -PRON- be to realize -PRON- difference from -PRON- and -PRON- friendliness would change to hate cause -PRON- to turn from -PRON- with fear and loathing 
the building have reach the stage of scaffolding and -PRON- be still at work 
-PRON- be now that -PRON- learn the full truth about the project which be soon to come into operation 
-PRON- be on the outside of the building and two of the man in charge be nearby 
one of -PRON- shrewd and elderly have finance the building the other in -PRON- thirty be the scientist who have invent the process 
-PRON- be speak in low tone tone which no human be stand in position would have be able to understand sure blayson that there s no danger the old man be say 
the scientist smile always some danger mr lymer especially when -PRON- try something new 
but there s nothing -PRON- shouldnot be able to control still donot think that -PRON- know too much about what -PRON- be do admit that -PRON- 
but -PRON- get result donot -PRON- comer the world market mr lymer 
name -PRON- antibiotic and well make -PRON- 
and in addition to anything now be sell well have dozen that nobody have even imagine 
i think give -PRON- enough evidence to convince -PRON- of that suppose -PRON- have 
but this use of cosmic ray make -PRON- uneasy 
-PRON- still donot know enough about -PRON- 
-PRON- be at this point that third and fourth eye usually so completely conceal pop wide open in surprise and terror 
-PRON- be fortunate that no one take the trouble to look at -PRON- at that moment 
the young man be say confidently -PRON- will control -PRON- 
all -PRON- need to know be that -PRON- be high energy high than anything -PRON- can produce here on earth and that -PRON- can concentrate -PRON- in a way no one else can nothing to fear nothing that ordinary precaution shouldnot enable -PRON- to handle 
nothing kayin think but the danger of depopulate most of a planet 
-PRON- mind go back to what have happen on the second planet of -PRON- own sun what have almost happen on the fourth planet 
within the space of a few hundred centad of time the second planet with -PRON- population of four billion have lose every inhabitant and become a sterile monument of a dead civilization 
only the warning of what have already take place have enable the second planet to survive 
and in this place too disaster would strike quickly 
kayin have begin to read more and more and -PRON- know what be take place here 
science have develop quickly but sporadically 
vast region have remain untouched by -PRON- mass of people know nothing of -PRON- but the name and the fact that -PRON- could perform miracle 
true -PRON- have learn that certain discovery may lead to disaster as well as to the improvement of -PRON- life but -PRON- still fail to test -PRON- discovery fully before use -PRON- -PRON- still fail to exercise the necessary control 
the young man blayson have make -PRON- discovery ahead of -PRON- proper time 
at the rate at which human science be progress think kayin at least a hundred year would have to pass before such a discovery could be consider safe 
at the present stage -PRON- simply could not be control 
the concentrated cosmic ray would as blayson evidently anticipate cause tremendous mutation in live organism in the mold and mycete of different kind -PRON- would lead to the manufacture of useful antibiotic 
but -PRON- would also lead to the production of entirely new form of submicroscopic life form not susceptible to ordinary method of sterilization form that would multiply with inexorable speed 
these form produce from bit of human tissue would inevitably be deadly to human being and related specie 
-PRON- -PRON- think kayin possess of a different body chemistry may escape 
but -PRON- would be the only intelligent creature to do so 
aand after the virus have do -PRON- work the planet in -PRON- desolation and sterility would resemble the second planet of -PRON- own star 
if -PRON- have learn of the imminence of disaster at the time -PRON- first arrive -PRON- would hardly have be affect 
-PRON- would have hate to see a race disappear 
-PRON- have the scientist desire to keep any race even the least useful alive so that -PRON- may study -PRON- and at the very bad write an article about -PRON- 
but now and this -PRON- realize almost to -PRON- amazement -PRON- feel practically human -PRON- 
-PRON- must be the way -PRON- be live and work the way the other treat -PRON- on the job 
-PRON- do not want to see -PRON- annihilate be the only one to know the danger 
-PRON- realize at once that -PRON- could tell no one 
blayson and lymer have eye only on the fortune -PRON- intend to make and -PRON- would have refuse to beleve anything that stand in the way of those fortune 
nor could -PRON- go to anyone else 
there would be question -PRON- imagine -PRON- try to inform the mayor of the city 
some underling would be sure to meet -PRON- 
-PRON- say there s danger mr kayin 
that how -PRON- pronounce -PRON- name -PRON- come from 
-PRON- would have to invent answer in advance for every possible embarrassing question 
and then would come the most embarrassing of all how do -PRON- know there s danger 
there be no answer to that 
could -PRON- say that -PRON- have work in the same field of research -PRON- 
or could -PRON- give -PRON- the example of what have happen on another planet 
-PRON- be a problem that -PRON- would have to solve by -PRON- 
-PRON- rack -PRON- head and find no simple solution 
-PRON- have -PRON- optical analyzer and one or two additional trifle like -PRON- but there be no special apparatus -PRON- could use no weapon 
outside of -PRON- scientfic knowledge and -PRON- nonhuman brain -PRON- have only the same weapon as the human being -PRON- 
and these be hardly enough to put an end for gcxd to a project on which so many human being have build -PRON- hope 
the building approach completion the laboratory equipment begin to be instal 
and then finally when delay be no longer possible on the eve of the very day that be to see the plant put into operation kayin act 
-PRON- know that until work actually begin there would be but a single night watchman and -PRON- be this man at whom -PRON- strike first 
a single carefully ame blow with a padded club produce unconsciousness 
kayin do not strike hard but -PRON- strike hard enough 
as the watchman fall kayin seize the man bind and gag -PRON- 
then -PRON- enter the building and begin to destroy 
-PRON- start with the cosmic ray collector work quietly and efficiently and concentrate on the electronic and magnetic part 
these have be order long before the building -PRON- have be begin 
-PRON- would be hard to replace 
-PRON- pass on to the giant incubator vat and finally turn -PRON- attention to the collection of formula which repose in the file 
these be important but -PRON- know that -PRON- be not enough 
the most important formula of all lie in the mind of the man who have develop the process and that be for the moment at least beyond -PRON- 
what kayin be do now be play for time 
-PRON- be set a match to the paper of the last file when -PRON- hear a voice 
more time have pass than -PRON- realize and -PRON- have come early on this day that be to have see the beginning of a great enterprise 
-PRON- must already have note the absence of the watchman 
now -PRON- hear a gasp from lymer a groan that must have come from blayson 
then there be curse slow bitter and steady 
then footstep and lymer be stand at the door of the office and shout here -PRON- be 
blayson be shout to someone outside and know that in a moment the entire building would be swarm with people 
-PRON- promptly toss one of the fiile at lymer see the man shamble and fall in an effort to avoid be hit and be past the door before the enraged man could scramble to -PRON- foot again 
then -PRON- be in the great incubation room with -PRON- monstrous vat head for the opposite end 
but before -PRON- could reach -PRON- a door swing open 
a policeman appear and shout hey -PRON- stop 
-PRON- dash out through a side door into a small control room 
-PRON- lock the door behind -PRON- 
-PRON- hear a dub pound furiously upon -PRON- and tlie pound cease as the policeman decide against a further waste of time here 
kayin run to the other door 
as -PRON- do so the knob turn 
-PRON- throw all -PRON- weight against the door and turn the key 
man pound on both door and -PRON- look around for window 
there be none 
-PRON- be lock in 
-PRON- hear voice open up 
-PRON- canot get away 
there be -PRON- be true no way out 
but kayin say calmljr stay away or blow up the building 
a fter the destruction -PRON- have already accomplish -PRON- have no way of know that -PRON- be bluff 
the pounding stop 
through the door -PRON- hear the whisper sound of consultation 
then voice again come out 
-PRON- wonot liurt -PRON- realize that 
-PRON- realize -PRON- think that i be afraid do -PRON- not 
there be surprise in the tone of reply 
-PRON- donot sound crazy but but what other reason could i have have for destroy so much valuable equipment 
-PRON- hear lymer say over a hundred thousand dollar worth 
that cosmic ray collector cost at least that 
a policeman voice -PRON- see -PRON- mr lymer 
recognize -PRON- 
no never see -PRON- before in -PRON- life 
blayson shout again this time with unconcealed anger come on out 
with pleasure 
but first i should like to talk to -PRON- talk later 
no 
-PRON- know that later -PRON- would not listen to -PRON- and -PRON- realize that if -PRON- could convince blayson of the danger of the project -PRON- battle would be win 
do -PRON- want to know why i do so much damage mr blayson already answer that 
no i be not insane 
-PRON- be -PRON- who be fail to use -PRON- mind properly 
-PRON- method be extremely dangerous 
how do -PRON- know have make similar study absurd 
no one on earth have do anything like this didnot mention earth think kayin 
aloud -PRON- say patiently -PRON- be mistaken 
-PRON- experiment be not new and -PRON- be know -PRON- do not say where -PRON- be know -PRON- be know that -PRON- can lead to disaster 
-PRON- can produce microorganism of a virulence never before see here just imagine thing do not imagine 
at this period -PRON- discovery be of too treacherous a nature to be use 
blayson be silent and kayin hope that -PRON- be think of something else than break down the door 
-PRON- will not be the first mr blayson to have surpresse a discovery of so great significance donot believe -PRON- 
open the door 
in a moment 
but think of what i have say 
open the door 
half a moment now 
-PRON- do not care to listen further 
a policeman growl stalling break -PRON- open 
no need for that say kayin shall come out 
perhaps if i speak to -PRON- face to face -PRON- will believe -PRON- 
-PRON- remove the jacket and shirt and tie to which -PRON- have become so accustomed these past few month 
-PRON- stretch -PRON- muscle freely and smile a bitter smile to -PRON- 
-PRON- say the door open outward 
please give room 
-PRON- turn the key in the lock and slam the door open 
then -PRON- leap forward 
-PRON- could hear tlie shout of horror -PRON- could see -PRON- stand there petrify 
-PRON- be a reaction that -PRON- have count on 
a policeman fire -PRON- revolver but so excitedly that every bullet miss while -PRON- yell not human not human 
the gravity be a little too great here for -PRON- to do any real flying but at least -PRON- wing unfold at last could take -PRON- high into the air in the great room terrify and confuse -PRON- 
as -PRON- slowly float down -PRON- could see -PRON- race around madly 
-PRON- head for the door to an outer room 
a policeman who be stand in -PRON- path could not move -PRON- bulk out of the way in time 
kayin crash into -PRON- and send -PRON- sprawl 
then from behind -PRON- another policeman aim a blow with the butt of -PRON- gun 
with -PRON- extra eye kayin see what be happen and a blow of -PRON- great wing knock the policeman down 
then -PRON- be run down the corridor use -PRON- wing to give -PRON- a little extra speed 
the door through which -PRON- have just come swing open again and a bullet sing past -PRON- tear into the nonfleshy part of -PRON- wing 
-PRON- hardly feel -PRON- 
-PRON- be outside 
the noise of the shooting have spread the alarm 
another policeman come run take one look at -PRON- close -PRON- eye and sway there 
kayin seize the man own club and hit -PRON- over the head with -PRON- 
-PRON- drag the unconscious body into a deep clean concretelined pit that have be reserve for some of the dangerously radioactive byproduct that -PRON- be now sure -PRON- would never make 
in the dark of the pit -PRON- strip the policeman of the uniform 
the man be broad across the shoulder and the uniform fit nicely across wing 
now -PRON- leap out of the pit add -PRON- yell to those of the other 
a car the one in which blayson and lymer have arrive be stand park at the edge of the yard and -PRON- slip into -PRON- 
-PRON- be out of tlie yard before -PRON- realize what be happen 
but a policeman uniform -PRON- know be too conspicuous 
a mile away -PRON- stop a puzzle truck driver threaten the man with -PRON- revolver and drive away a moment later with an extra less conspicuous suit of clothe 
-PRON- turn on the radio and learn as -PRON- have suspect that an alarm for -PRON- have already be broadcast 
-PRON- leave the car on a deserted side road and change into -PRON- truck driver outfit 
-PRON- know enough now about human custom to feel momentarily safe 
and -PRON- know enough also to realize that -PRON- would institute a nationwide search for a strange creature with wing 
-PRON- would not be safe for long 
-PRON- have to get back to -PRON- ship of which fortunately -PRON- know nothing 
-PRON- may suspect but -PRON- could have no idea of where -PRON- have hide -PRON- hat night still dress as a truck driver -PRON- break into a factory that make electrical appliance 
when -PRON- leave -PRON- have with -PRON- most of what -PRON- need for repair 
-PRON- be two day later that -PRON- reach -PRON- ship with a supply of food 
-PRON- hope that -PRON- have be unobserved but -PRON- could not be sure 
-PRON- set to work use the earthmade supply to patch up in makeshift fashion the damage cause by the crash 
another two day and the ship would operate 
-PRON- be short on fuel but if -PRON- look for -PRON- -PRON- know -PRON- could find enough to send -PRON- on -PRON- way and leave this planet for good 
-PRON- realize now that -PRON- didnot want to leave 
in the day -PRON- have spend here -PRON- have gradually lose some of -PRON- feeling of loneliness 
almost despite -PRON- these human being have make -PRON- feel like one of -PRON- 
-PRON- planet would never take the place of the one -PRON- have leave but in many way -PRON- have become a second home to -PRON- 
-PRON- have make -PRON- uninhabitable for -PRON- 
if -PRON- have say nothing do nothing then no one would have suspect and -PRON- would have be allow to stay until disaster strike -PRON- all 
at least -PRON- have delay that 
the radio that night bring -PRON- the news that blayson who have be slightly injure in the struggle have be take to a hospital -PRON- mind temporarily go under the shock of what have happen 
-PRON- would be unable for the time to reconstruct what kayin have destroy 
lymer dishearten by the loss have announce that -PRON- have no plan for rebuild the factory 
despite -PRON- stupidity kayin have win -PRON- a respite 
-PRON- have win nothing for -PRON- 
the follow day -PRON- hear warning sound and see group of man close in around the ship 
-PRON- be pleased to see that despite all difficulty -PRON- have trace the path -PRON- have take 
-PRON- be not so stupid after all 
this scan be produce and distribute free by the pulps can group 
if -PRON- pay for this digital document or a compilation of this and other digital pulps -PRON- get rip off 
but -PRON- can still have this and more than a thousand more pulps for free by come over and join -PRON- at pulpscansyahoogroupscom -PRON- go into -PRON- ship and the door slide shut 
night be fall and in the darkness the ship leap upward at a sharp angle 
now there would be hundred of people who see the shooting star but this time a star that shoot upward 
-PRON- rise to a height of twenty mile and remain at that level cruise slowlly 
far above -PRON- could see through the viewplate the star vega -PRON- call -PRON- here which be -PRON- native sun 
already an exile from -PRON- homeland -PRON- be now be exile from -PRON- second home 
suddenly -PRON- know that be exile once be enough 
-PRON- be tired of flee through space tired of make friend and then be force to leave -PRON- 
-PRON- have make a home here and here -PRON- would stand and fight 
below -PRON- the surface of the planet be now rocky and desert 
the ship begin to sink 
-PRON- be still dark and the vessel come to rest slowly and inconspicuously upon a craggy peak where there be little danger that any human being would stumble upon -PRON- 
far below -PRON- could see the outline of a town pick out of the darkness by light reflect from cloud above 
look through a distance viewer -PRON- could even distinguish the individual light and -PRON- be able to read a sign that flaunt -PRON- message boldly alongside a bridge -PRON- smile and say softly in the language that be no longer strange to -PRON- accept the invitation 
stretch -PRON- wing -PRON- parachute down through the darkness to level ground prepare to become once more a member by adoption of the human race 
and this time as -PRON- walk cautious and alone through the night -PRON- no longer feel lonely

secretary read -PRON- -PRON- tomorrow now on sale spoiler of the spaceway by out beyond hyperspace soar the transmute terran to trygon where all mad man die willingly for the empress 
i be say that the resistance palomar for while the astronomer probegan at the moment the great spaceship pound tleorie as to -PRON- origin and from trygon first appear as an un composition -PRON- enter -PRON- atmosphere and know body on the photographic plate at come to earth on the runway of idlewild airport just outside of what be then new york city 
nothing nee be say of the panic cause by -PRON- come 
three go immediately in a ground car to the united nation build in the city 
the record of -PRON- pronouncement have unfortunately be lose but from subsequent event -PRON- have be establish that -PRON- grant terra fifteen day to submit to trygonia 
then -PRON- return to space 
fifteen day later -PRON- return and crush the feeble opposition -PRON- encounter be tired of see nothing but white the wall and ceiling of -PRON- small windowless room the few piece of utilitarian furniture and the sheet cover the narrow bed which sag under the weight of -PRON- muscularly massive sixfoot fiveinch frame 
-PRON- be tired too of the white bandage on -PRON- hand and although -PRON- could not see -PRON- the white bandage that swathe -PRON- head and face leave only slit for -PRON- eye and mouth 
today be the day -PRON- think 
why donot -PRON- come 
as if in answer to -PRON- unspoken question the door latch click 
savage turn -PRON- head to watdi the door open 
as -PRON- swing wide the doctor enter follow by general strathmore and two nurse guide a wheeled tray time to take -PRON- the doctor say 
no one answer but savage feel -PRON- hand grow sweaty in -PRON- wrapping 
as the group reach the bed a nurse hand the doctor a pair of surgical scissor 
-PRON- bend over savage as -PRON- say take the hand first 
there be no sound other than the snipsnip of the scissor as the doctor carefully cut through the gauze 
finally the sound stop and savage look at -PRON- hand 
-PRON- be white and soft but there be no scar to betray the fingerprint change 
the doctor permit -PRON- a small smile of satisfaction but the room be pregnant with tension as -PRON- turn -PRON- attention to the gauze cover head 
the snijjsnip come again as the cold steel slide slowly over -PRON- skin 
an eternity pass before the sound again cease and a nurse carefully remove the free gauze 
for a long moment there be no sound and savage look anxiously from face to face and try to interpret what -PRON- read there 
the nurse stare in disgust and horror while the doctor look satisfied 
the general beam 
beautiful job the general say finally and the doctor nod in agreement 
let -PRON- see savage croak through stiff lip 
a nurse take the hand mirror from the bedside table and hold -PRON- in front of -PRON- 
from the glass the bearded face of a trygonian stare at -PRON- there be no mistake the narrow chin the high broad cheekbone and aquiline nose 
a lmost a month later savage stand at attention in the office 
-PRON- wear the flamboyantly brilliant uniform of a trygonian officer 
medal and order sparkle on -PRON- breast 
-PRON- new face wear a sardonic scowl 
fleet captain choon report sir -PRON- say and the stern face relax to a half smile 
sit down ross the general invite and indicate the chair beside -PRON- desk 
so -PRON- be ready to go eh 
how do -PRON- like -PRON- 
well savage smile have to keep -PRON- from go for -PRON- gun when i see -PRON- in a mirror but outside of that pretty used to -PRON- by now make tremendous stride in the twenty year since -PRON- go underground 
i guess -PRON- be the pressure 
but phillip tell -PRON- that by every test -PRON- be a trygonian 
i hope however that -PRON- havenot become one emotionally 
that be the one thing -PRON- be afraid of when -PRON- decide to use the ceregraph 
choon die of course but how be -PRON- for -PRON- 
nothing to -PRON- sir 
i just seem to go to sleep and when i awake i know everything choon know but doctor phillip almost drive -PRON- crazy test -PRON- to find out whether pick up mental outlook 
apparently though the ceregraph transfer only knowledge not emotion 
thank the lord exclaim the general heavily want to thank -PRON- for this opportunity savage say want to do something concrete against -PRON- since -PRON- kill -PRON- parent twenty year ago whether or not -PRON- can do something concrete be up to -PRON- 
the general be stern again 
-PRON- be choose because of -PRON- physical and mental qualification 
-PRON- just happen to be exact physical double 
fortunately -PRON- be rather short than the average trygonian 
doctor phillip tell -PRON- that except for size there be no anatomical difference between the trygonian and -PRON- say savage 
-PRON- be -PRON- theory that the high intelligent life form on any planet suitable to the evolution of intelligent life will be a humanoid type 
that may be possible but exact duplication seem strange the general say 
although interested in i havenot have a chance to read -PRON- report 
i think -PRON- have time to fill -PRON- in on some of the detail 
why do -PRON- call -PRON- planet trygon trygon be tlie name of -PRON- sun explain savage 
-PRON- system consist of three planet trygon and until about seven hundred year ago only the middle planet trygon be inhabit by -PRON- race 
then -PRON- discover a method of utilize solar energy directly and what amount to a social revolution take place 
at the time trygon be divide into a number of country 
the discovery be make in a country call czur and with -PRON- czur conquer the rest of the planet 
-PRON- use pretty brutal method but -PRON- weld the entire planet into one country use one language and have one ruler 
space be the next step and -PRON- explore the other planet 
the innermost one be hot and lush and eventually -PRON- tame -PRON- and now -PRON- grow all -PRON- food there 
the third planet as may be expect be cold and bare but -PRON- be fantastically rich in mineral 
-PRON- transfer -PRON- mining and manufacturing to the third planet leave trygon the center of trade the rich and the military 
there be a number of commercial spaceport but only one military near the capital city name czur in honor of the country that start -PRON- all 
two hundred year ago -PRON- venture into deep space 
earth be the fifth humanoid planet -PRON- have conquer quite a history say tlie general 
what form of government do -PRON- have 
autocratic 
the emperor be the supreme authority but the high commissioner work out the detail and see that the order be carry out 
ail military matter be in the hand of the emporer and in that respect the high commissioner be just a figure head 
as -PRON- can imagine there be a deal of intrigue 
yes i can see that there would be agree the general 
-PRON- glance at the wall clock 
but -PRON- almost be there any last order 
savage ask 
the general smile wryly 
-PRON- may be say that there be no first order on -PRON- own ross 
-PRON- donot know what -PRON- can do but if -PRON- can get into one of -PRON- intrigue group -PRON- should be able to do something 
the rank of fleet captain carry a lot of weight 
all i can say be be careful and do -PRON- good skeleton crew be move out and the station be go on automatic as soon as -PRON- leave 
savage stand up saluted and then the general take -PRON- hand and shake -PRON- warmly 
savage turn and walk out of the office without look back 
outside two guard wait and -PRON- walk together down a long hall to a bare cementwalle room 
there be only one way to make sure that -PRON- would look like an escaped prisoner and -PRON- have to make sure 
so -PRON- fight and when -PRON- be through -PRON- uniform be a sad caricature of -PRON- former splendor and -PRON- have the beginning of a black eye 
-PRON- shake hand with the two man and then go up tliree flight of stair where the trygonian patrol ship wait 
there be no one in sight as -PRON- climb into the ship and roar away but antiaircraft gun open up almost immediately 
savage smile grimly as -PRON- see the shell burst a safe distance from -PRON- hen as -PRON- be almost out of range the ship lurdie from the blast of a near miss 
a hole appear in the hull beside -PRON- and -PRON- see -PRON- sleeve rip and redden as a fragment cut across -PRON- arm 
-PRON- switch on the automatic and curse the unknown gunner as -PRON- crudely bandage the flesh wound with part of -PRON- already tear shirt 
at least -PRON- think finally -PRON- would add verisimilitude to -PRON- story 
an hour later -PRON- crashlande on the outskirt of what have once be denver colorado and what be now the trygonian capital for north america 
then be settle down to wait for tlie trygonian 
something less than ten minute pass before a ground car skid to a stop near the wreck ship 
two trygonian soldier jump out with handblaster at the ready 
more sedately as befit -PRON- rank a senior lieutenant follow and savage walk briskly to meet -PRON- 
the lieutenant qed savage dubiously for a brief moment and then snap to tlie salute 
at ease savage order 
take -PRON- to headquarters immediately 
yes sir the lieutenant reply and follow savage into the car 
-PRON- be evident that -PRON- be wonder why such an exalted personage as a full fleet captain should appear in a single place patrol ship and in this condition but savage let -PRON- wonder 
the soldier reentere the car and -PRON- speed away with a fullthroate roar 
savage remain grimly silent as -PRON- roar through the trygonian capital gonian be everywhere but still eartlunen predominated and savage wonder what have induce -PRON- to remain 
there be probably many reason -PRON- decide for man in spite of everything must live somewhere and -PRON- must eat 
after twenty year -PRON- be probably use to -PRON- 
-PRON- have live briefly in denver as a child but nothing remain now of the city -PRON- have know 
the old building have be blast during the invasion and starkly functional ferroconcrete have replace the rubble 
at the very site of the old state capitol the trygonian have raise a tower structure to house the office of the high command 
-PRON- file into the building and as the lieutenant have do the honor guard eye -PRON- dubiously before snap to attention 
savage strode haughtily between -PRON- and finally after a succession of guard and less officer -PRON- be usher into the presence of vice admiral harna fleet captain choon -PRON- announce 
the admiral be tremendous 
-PRON- tower a full foot over savage and -PRON- heavily decorate uniform be stretch tightly over a majestic paunch 
-PRON- great jowl move loosely as -PRON- boom choon by the great galatic god 
i know -PRON- father on the old arrano 
-PRON- be the good executive officer i ever have 
but sit down -PRON- may leave 
lieutenant and tell -PRON- what -PRON- be do here 
what happen to -PRON- uniform be take by the terran 
the eye become iq chip have just escape from stronghold have -PRON- by the eternal star the admiral interrupt 
too many of -PRON- man have vanish in spite of reprisal but this be the first definite proof of an organized movement 
where be -PRON- 
about five hundred le north in the mountain savage say and the admiral go into action 
with -PRON- left hand -PRON- flip a switch and a colored relief map of the area spring into view on the wall while with -PRON- right hand -PRON- push up a row of communicator button 
ready three attack unit for immediate takeoff -PRON- roar will take personal command 
have -PRON- car at gate three 
with the button still up -PRON- ask 
what be the exact location 
savage move quickly to the map and examine -PRON- closely 
after a moment hesitation -PRON- say as closely as i can make -PRON- -PRON- be zone three sector five 
-PRON- be well camouflage 
the admiral roar tlie location into the communicator and slam down the button 
with swiftness surprising for one of -PRON- bulk -PRON- stride to the door 
-PRON- will come with -PRON- in -PRON- flagship choon 
these miserable savage wonot give -PRON- much of a fight but -PRON- may be of some interest both be decorate for this 
a hour and twenty minute later the fifteen unit fleet be hover high over the canadian rockie zone three sector five 
at the direction savage examine the mountain below through the electronic scatmer 
although -PRON- know there be no one leave in the hide cavern below -PRON- -PRON- be an effort to point -PRON- out -PRON- have be -PRON- home for a long time 
the admiral bark coordinate into the microphone and then bark an order 
one ship detach -PRON- from the formation and dive toward the hide entrance of the cavern -PRON- heat gun burn great swath through tree and brush 
-PRON- make a second pass and antiquated antiaircraft gun open up tear the air futiley 
savage barely suppress a start of surprise before remember that the gun be automaticradar control 
the admiral roar into the microphone again squadron three cover one and two land and deploy for attack 
remember i want prisoner 
as the ship descend the antiaircraft gun open up again from -PRON- now reveal turret and as -PRON- fire the gun blast -PRON- into so much molten scrap 
finally -PRON- be completely silence and the attack ship land and the soldier deploy 
-PRON- be almost to the entrance and savage be begin to wonder what have happen to the trip when an atomic blast take away the side of the mountain 
the troop and five trygonian ship go with -PRON- 
the admiral have have within -PRON- grasp a stronghold of the resistance and -PRON- have lose -PRON- 
-PRON- could be argue that tlie loss could not have be avoid but in -PRON- service such an argument be not admissable 
a full report be send to trygon and both the admiral and choon be recall 
the three ship which first find terra have be equip with ordinary space drive and have be in space for more than eighteen year 
lack a radio which would cover the immense distance one of the ship have take a seebnd eighteen year to make a report of the conquest 
but in the meantime both space radio and space warp have be achieve and fortyfive day after the abortive attack -PRON- be on trygon -PRON- be place under house arrest in hotel suite and two day later the admiral be give a swift trial 
-PRON- be demote three grade and then give permission to retire 
have extract the penalty for failure from -PRON- admiral the supreme command would next turn -PRON- attention to err fleet captain capture by the enemy be bad enough but -PRON- have give the information which have lead to serious loss 
confine in -PRON- suite -PRON- wait anxiously for two day more without receive word and then -PRON- receive a visit from a captain lin 
after identify -PRON- lin say -PRON- be in serious trouble with the high commissioner sir and not about -PRON- capture or the attack on the terran stronghold 
at least not directly 
-PRON- have well sit down while i tell -PRON- what happen will stand thank -PRON- savage say coldly 
as -PRON- wish sir 
-PRON- hard to believe but every file and record concern -PRON- for the past two year as well as the record of the trial have be either destroy or rewrite 
officially -PRON- be here on leave 
and to top -PRON- off be find dead this morning 
the evidence point to suicide but -PRON- be believe to be murder 
what exclaim savage and find a chair 
the high commissioner be blow -PRON- jet continue lin with thinly veil excitement 
-PRON- doesnot know how -PRON- be do but -PRON- suspect that the empress order -PRON- 
if that s the case -PRON- hand be tie but in the meantime hell do anything to get -PRON- have be instruct to advise -PRON- to deny everything except that -PRON- be indeed home on leave 
incidentally no one be to know of -PRON- visit 
how about the guard 
savage ask 
lin smile am in command of the guard detail 
i must return to duty now but please remember that -PRON- be a person of extreme importance and as such -PRON- must be very careful 
before savage could reply lin turn on -PRON- heel and leave the room leave -PRON- to ponder this sudden turn of event 
how could anyone change everything so completely -PRON- wonder 
if -PRON- be on the empress order why should -PRON- take such an interest in -PRON- 
why should lin give -PRON- tlie information 
who do -PRON- represent 
an hour later a knock on the door bring -PRON- out of -PRON- private hell -PRON- panel slide open and a lieutenant in the jet black uniform of the fleet strode in importantly 
behind -PRON- come four enlisted man in the same uniform two of whom plant -PRON- firmly beside the door with -PRON- hand on openholstere blaster 
the other two wheel in an equipment table 
savage wait with silent calm while the lieutenant cross the room and draw -PRON- to attention 
then -PRON- ask sharply what be the meaning of this intnision 
i demand every courtesy of house arrest and this do not fall in that category be under the explicit order of the high commissioner the officer say icily 
any complaint should be address to -PRON- 
i have also be instruct to take any necessary action to carry out -PRON- order 
and what be -PRON- 
savage parried 
please be good enough to follow -PRON- to the table the officer say finger -PRON- blaster 
savage follow 
at the table the officer flip a switch and from somewhere in the apparatus come a hum 
then a flat plate set into the surface of the table glow and savage be instruct to place -PRON- hand palm down on the plate 
-PRON- do so and the officer push a button 
-PRON- may remove -PRON- hand -PRON- say and bend over a double eyepiece 
after adjust and readjust a pair of knob -PRON- raise -PRON- head and give savage a surprised look 
-PRON- bend down again and make new adjustment 
at last -PRON- straighten up 
-PRON- voice lack some of -PRON- former arrogance as -PRON- say thank -PRON- sir 
the lieutenant and -PRON- man leave without say anything further and savage wonder what -PRON- have try to prove with a fingerprint check 
apparently however the high commissioner be cover every angle 
the episode give savage a momentary feeling of pleasure which however be quickly replace by -PRON- former doubt 
several hour pass during which -PRON- have lunch before a knock again sound 
this time as the door slide open 
savage could see a double row of crimsonuniforme man the personal guard of the high commissioner -PRON-

-PRON- find too that in spite of the uncertainty -PRON- feel about -PRON- be actually begin to like -PRON- 
-PRON- wonder then if doctor test be accurate well loong smile when savage sit down

savage take the proffered glass and wait expectantly 
as -PRON- know loong begin kalnor be emperor until hlar then high commissioner stage a coup detat 
kalnor and -PRON- family be murder and hlar proclaim -PRON- emperor

nothing permanent be gain by force 
a conquered people will not remain so forever glass suddenly slip from -PRON- hand 
as though from a great distance -PRON- watch the liquid splash on the rug and then the room seem to be recede in the distance 
-PRON- try to rise urgently aware of -PRON- danger but instead -PRON- feel -PRON- collapse 
then all sensation cease 
-PRON- have no idea how much later -PRON- be when -PRON- awaken in -PRON- own bedroom 
other than a slight headache -PRON- feel no effect of the drug 
-PRON- see that the trygonian day have come again but that mean nothing -PRON- could have be unconscious for several day

-PRON- betray -PRON- under hypnosis 
savage know the bitter feeling of utter defeat 
-PRON- have accomplish nothing and now this be tlie end

-PRON- wasnot long before -PRON- realize that a rough parallel could be draw between tlie early history of trygon and terra 
there have be war and famine and great empire but trygon have progress more rapidly without the great recession terra have know of a century before the beginning of atomic on terra trygonian scientist have already harness solar energy 
at that point the parallel end 
-PRON- wa already late when -PRON- turn to the history of the kalnor family

there have be period when usurper have gain control but always the kalnor have return until finally kiar determine to put an end to the family have destroy -PRON-
