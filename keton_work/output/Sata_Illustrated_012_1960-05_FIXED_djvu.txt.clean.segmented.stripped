the light of the pale egyptian moon tnms polished silver each windswept dune
and with its shattered jeweled rays the houndless desert sands are strewn
from far across the sculptured drifts a cry the silence lifts
and fills the ancient temples halls scholng through the timeworn rifts
its oncegreat glory now unknown
the temple deeps through time alone
the desert rats and lizards creep
there kings onoe walked upon the stone
like watchful guards the pillars stand sentinels in this timeless land slowly crumhllng into dust deeply scarred hy wrlndhlown sand
three times its walls were covered oer
a heavy dusty rohe it wore
bidden from the pale moons gaze
and then the sands moved on onoe more
long shafts of silver light fall through between the towering pillars to form moonpaths across the floor
and lght the spots where flowrs onoe grew
the moaning wind begins to rise
and fills the hall with echoing cries
and while it howls and sohs euid sings
the moon bangs lower in the skies
as the glowing orhi descends slowly each lightpath extends into the ancient gods retreat
their journey on his altar ends
for one seconds time the light a jeweled object brings to sight
the saoriflclal dagger lies beside a dceleton gaunt and white
a man laid out upon the stone his oncestrong anas now only hone
to the altar of the god reach out there a tragic thing is shown
lying in a tattered gown upon the altars top stained hrown tith ancient hlood a heap of hones a skull encircled hy a crown a gemencrusted golden hand a mark of honor in this land
in ages past the fairest maid in marriage gave the god her hand
the sacrificial victims fate to give up all she loved to sate a dark and evil gods desires then through his priests he called a mats
bow had she died
bow had he
the hlade which struck so cruelly into hie hack was meant for her that had caused this tragedy
the theirs perhaps a love so brief that he her lover filled with grief sought to rescue or to die to find lifes joy or deaths relief
bad she heen forced to natch him die
or he to suffer her last cry
or perhaps as lovers should
did they together fate defy
only those who saw the end could any light the mystery lend
but time has stopped their mouths with dust long since to earth they did descend
from the silver light
tiny specks of glittering white thirl into the shadowed room to drive away the brooding night
the glistening motes as if endowed with sentient life now form a cloud about the forms so still in death
to clothe each in a glowing shroud
faster whirls the silver dust teavlng in and out as must the dancers have in years gone hy
fanning to flame the dark gods lust
the wind through cracked and broken wall
tith sobbing moans and screams recalls the countless maids in ages gone who met their deaths within these halls
suddenly the moon descends
the desert winds mad walling ends
the whirling dust sinks to the floor
the echo with the silence blends
stillness in the temple reigns
but though the moon set light remains in two white spots
the pillared hall more brilliance than the moon attains
the shlbiiaerlng white unearthly glow condenoes
from lt two shapes grow their forms indefinite and faint
as seen through clouds or waterflow
from the altars bloodstained crown a maiden young and fair steps down
her raven hair with jewels strung
her hands carress a gemstarred gown
her lovely lips part in a smile
her arms reach out her eyes beguile
her face reflects the perfect love that neither time nor death defile
rising from the sandscarred floor
her lover comes as long before
handsome strong and clothed in light
he takes her in his arms once more
y they died in ages past how they came to breathe their last must remain a mystery for time has sealed the secret fast
the temple where they met their end may in the years to dust descend
but their pure and deathless love throughout the aeons will extend
til no man is left to stand where desert covers sea and land
and fobbed of even the jackals cry
the breeze alone blows oer the sand
ihe instant chuok dove into the slime of the pool he realized he was in trouble
crawlers slapped their suckers into his skin eager for his blood
but his momentum carried him deeper and it was too late to stop
he saw the faint glimmer of the shoe in the red haze of the water
pulling it out of the mud he swam upward until he broke the surface
then he was quickly out on the grass rolling over and over to scratch off the small crawlers he stood up shaking the water out of his shoe moxita came over and favored him by pulling out the remaining crawlers that he hadnot rolled off
but she still wasnot speaking to him
not after what had happened last night that damned guatoeat
all this trouble
chuck dewitt wiped the mud off his shoe and slipped it on
finishing with the zipper he smiled hopefully at hoxita but she was still mad
he shrugged his shoulders and went back into the tent theyd rected the day before lloxita folloved him in silence
slowly he began to pack and she packed with him
she was a good wife even if she was a boondooker
chuck thought that the green tint of her skin added something to the natural lithesome beauty of her race
but these mad spells of hers they irritated him
he whirled at her it was only a guatooet for cripes sakel good guatooat she corrected
and you had to chase it away by throwing a shoe at it it may not come back
iell all for that chuck said sarcastically flinging a pair of dirty socks into one of the packs
he buckled the straps and tossed the pack onto the levitator platform a stupid religion he persisted worshipping big oatsl lloxita didnot reply dhed lapsed behind her wall of silence
and she wouldnot speak he glanced at his another hour or so
her mad spells often lasted two days
but chuck knew that he was falsely accusing her ihe cats werenot symbolic nor even remotely connected with religion
boondock women liked the big tawny things and boondock men seemed to hate them and chased them away whenever possible
chuck could easily understand why like last night the big oat had prowled near their tent and created so much racket with its screams that he hadnot been able to sleep
so he had chunked a shoe at it to chase the thing away
the shoe had plummeted into the pool
it was too far back to the city to get another pair so hed had to dive into the pool for his old one
guatooats were big trouble all the way around
he took the guide rope and floated the platform out of the tent then began to break down the plastic structure
toxita helped him dutifully
everything was packed and they moved out onto the jungle trail
for a while koxita walked behind him
but she soon tired and climbed upon the platform
chuck was a bugtrapper
he made the rounds twice a month in his territory and sold the brittle bug shells to the hospitals on earth
when boiled down via chemical processes into a liquid state the sticky substance that formed the bugs outer shell was a positive cure for the common cold he tended one trap took the horned bug out of the statis field trap and killed it then slimg the carcass aboard the platform lloxita who loved him inspite of the times when she was mad at him scooted over to make room for the shell
he sneaked a loving glance at his strangeworld wife
lately it had come into his mind to have a son
of course it wasnot easy to get the idea over to lloxita
twice he had tried it but well he d also mentioned it to harper the old trader who operated the shell marketdome down by caix lake and harper had said rather embarrassed to take his wife with him on his next round of traps
chuck was doing now
but advice was not succeeding because it seemed that lloxita was staying mad at him
after hed throra that shoe at the guatooat tossed his blankets outside onto the platform and thats where hed spent the night
other earthmen had children by boondock women
ho problem there
proof of the matter was harper
eighteen kids
hope
the only trouble was with lloxita and the guatooat s iearily
chuck bent his head and strolled on down the trail
haybe harper could advise him
after last night
chuck knew something had to be done
the way things were going now his nerves would collapse in another week
the day seemed to pass slowly but he put his mind to the task of tending the traps and it wasnot until late in the evening that he noticed the two guatooats slipping through the dense ferns that bordered the trail
the big oats were seldom dangerous
they resembled an earth tiger in some ways except for the thin tentacles growing in a mass from the tops of their heads
at first he wasnot sure but when he saw one spring lightly across a small clearing he knew they were following him
just to be safe he stopped and took his proton rifle off of the platform blinglng it over his shoulder he felt more secure be at about two hours from now he said in direction ihe didnot reply
chuck looked at his wrist watch
it was odd that she wasnot over her mad spell yet
ihey seldom lasted this long
women i ihe guatocats seemed to he doing a good joh of keeping up with him
chuck noticed because when he quickened his pace they were still there sometimes invisible but always present nearby
he hoped they wouldnot start anything
there was a stiff penalty for killing one of the creatures whether they attacked you or not
evidently if one attacked you were supposed to run
chuck had never heard of one of the cats attacking a man but hed be damned if hed take any chances with one of them
ihe oats seemed to be creeping closer becoming more courageous every minute
he wasnot worried yet
if things came to worse hed climb upon the platform and boost it up out of reach
time was a factor
if he could manage to reach the clearing at the cats would wander off
ke glsinced back at iioxita dhe seemed to be in a trance with the slight fringes of a smile playing about her lips
he was tugging the platform around a curve in the trail when he came face to face with one of the guatocats
the big tawny thing was crouched ahead of him in the trail its tail making a circle ominously in the air tentacles waving furiously it stared at him
the oat appeared to be preparing to spring
there wasnot time to get on the platform vith an instinctive motion
chuck slung the rifle off his shoulder and brought it up and sighted
there was a hissing noise as he pressed the button and the big oat fell apart into tiny dust motes that settled slowly to barth moxita was screaming as chuck darted forward in the trail to make sure that the other guatooat wasnot preparing to attack
but the other guatooat had departed for places unknown
so he ran back to comfort ioxita
she was crying uncontrollably you killed it she wailed you killed a guatooat chuck was angry now
uat at her for worrying more about a damned oat than himself and mad at himself because of the stiff fine hed have to pay for killing the thing
shut up he told her
viciously he grabbed the rope to the platform and with the rifle grasped firmly in his othdr hand he trudged quickly past the tiny pile of dead guatooat in the trail
it didnot take much longer to reach he was anxious to get out of the jungle now and he was also worried
moxita was having a nervous breakdown screaming her head off
at he could send for a doctor
he was panting heavily when he broke free of the jungle into the clearing before marketdome
the platforms inertia flung it to the length of the rope when chuck stopped
harper his white beard streaming over his shoulder came running out to iioxita and helped her down from the platform
ilrs
harper a kindly boondock woman was right behind him
together they led the still sobbing moxita inside the huge airconditioned dome
chuck was almost too winded and tired to move
a moment later
harper came back out of the dome
he wore a troubled frown
tllgodl he exclaimed did you really kill a guatooat
chuck still breathless was only able to nod his head
for sake why i thought you wanted to be a father fell youve damned sure spoiled your chances nowl the oat was attacking panted chuck
attacking raved harper swinging his gnarled hands
he stared at chuck his eyes flashing rage
then he began to simmer down
bor a time he just stomped around in the dust
chuck was leaning on the platform for support something harper had said was beginning to dawn on him what has a guatooat got to do with having a baby
chuok asked
he had a fairly high intelligence ratio and was forming ooaolusions that soared him
harper didnot answer merely shuffled the toe of his shoe in the dust chuok moaned
boondock doesnot have a a trisexual race
harper shook his head all my fault guess just took it for granted that you already knew about the birds and bees look not going to let one of those damnea oats touch i donot give a bucket of blood if we never have any children oats only furnish atmosphere son harper explained patiently
ever hear one scream fhat scream is a sonic nerve stimulent that does something chemically inside a woman
ihen why do boondock men chase them away
how would you like to have a hundred brats yapping at your heels
boondock women require only two months in order to give birth to a new litter
chuck did some rapid figuring fhat amounts to about six children a year
irong harper stated shaking his head
depends upon the number of guatocats
one oat around one child fwo oats two offspring
jhen a boondooker wants an offspring he goes into the jungle and captures a guatocat with a stun gun and puts it in a cage and takes it back to his home
bingo
if youd told me this before i wouldnot have shot that oat
how not only do i have a stiff fine to pay but lloxita to pacify probably stay mad a week
how would you feel if your nerves had just been ripped apart harper asked
he shook his old wizened head but youre worse off than that son
every time something like this has happened the gustooats refuse to cooperate from there on out never scream around you again
but how could they know i killed one
chuck asked just go capture one in the jungle on the other side of the city work
somehow the oats know
telepathic
and that was the gist of the evening
moxita soon regained some of her composure and chuck set out on the return journey
unbelievingly he stunned a guatocat and fastened a cage for it vhen it regained consciousness it was as harper had said the cat was morose and sat silently in its cage nays passed
paying the fine hadnot hurt half as much as the real zation that he and uoxita could never have any children
how that he had reason
chuck checked with a boondock doctor and what harper had told him was relatively true
weeks later he discussed the situation with harper when he was again in that territory
moxita has grown sad chuck said leaning across the counter as harper counted his take of bug shells lapkitty wonot compare with a child said harper rub it in
how was i to know
could have happened to anyone harper justified often wondered said chuck all of your children look abont the same age
why
eighteen guatocats son
one of the dangers of living in the jungle like this
all of my offspring are of the same litter
better believe i was careful after that
i had a couple police shepards brought in from earth to use as watch dogs
dogs hate the big oats and the cats have little love for the dogs
the dogs keep the guatocats away it yelled chuck
can i borrow one of your dogs
both of the original dogs have died but sell you one of the pups three months later
chuck again stopped at the marketdome and yelled for harper to come out
harper and his greeskinned wife went out into the dust and there sat moxita on the platform with a baby in her arms chuck was standing on the ground with the rope of the platform in his hand and a proud fatherly smile on his face
ow in jupiter did you do it
harper exclaimed astonished
earthman ingenuity chuck bragged be blasted
you gave me a clue the last time i was here chuck pointed out
remember what you said about dogs hating the big cats
well i captured a guatocat and at an opportune moment put the dog into its cage
that guatocat screamed alright and loud
chuck let out a laugh and handed harper a cigar
so you see he continued like to buy another of your dogs
moxita and i have been thinking we might like a set of twins the next the painting was a monstrosity
it was a swirling mess of green red and brown thrown together into crude and obscene shapes
suggestibility was the keynote of the painting for one oould look at it for a moment and feel his imagination come alive with a hundred morbid dreams
the painting hung in john llosbys livingroom above his reading chair
he had acquired it from an obscure aft dealer a month prior and for all its ugliness he enjoyed gazing at it in the evenings when he came home from his office
there was a restful feeling in the brown shapes a soothing feeling in the geeen and a relaxing feeling in the red
probably he was the only person save for the one who had painted it who oould look upon the painting and enjoy what he saw
or rather what he felt
the door buzzer hummed at precisely seventhirty
john llosby fresh out of the shower with the faint smell of aftershave lotion clinging to his cheeks carefully finished the knotting of his tie glanced at the effect in his dressingtable mirror and felt pleased with his appearance
for a bachelor of twosoore and seven he thought still a handsome fellow
he opened the door and smiled at llaria come in darling he said taking her arm liaria returned his smile and walked with him into the room
they stopped in the center of the room and kissed
inria pressed herself to him hungtily and for a long moment john liosby was lost in a strong desire
when they reluctantly broke their embrace john pushed maria away holding her shoulders and letting his eyes take in her body
such a beautiful creature
too bad i couldnot have met you twenty years ago for all the good it would have done you maria laughed was only twelve
i had braces on my teeth freckles splotched all over my face and i was abominably fat
bo there well we would have made a go of it anyway
john mosby threw his arm around shoulder and turned her around to face the wall upon which hung the painting
he flung out his other arm palm up have acquired a priceless work of art
how do you like it
maria loked at the painting and for a while said nothing
john mosby glanced at her face and saw a film of fear over her eyes
his arm still lay over her shoulders and he oould feel her shrinking away from the painting
finally she said john its hideous hot hideous just different said john mosby hastily seeing that she was genuinely upset by the painting
how come on lets eat some of my marvelous cooking then go sit mystified through a horror movie
john mosby returned to his apartment at twelve oclock
he turned on the reading lamp and sat down to relive the past two hours
marians body so near his own almost merged with his own
he knew her lipstick had come off on his shirt collar and the knowledge made him feel strangely youthful again
maria williams was indeed a lucky find for him years old she looked and acted morg like twentyfive unmarried with interests strikingly similar to his own she had come into his life two years ago at a time when he had relinquished himself to the staleness of old age and brought him baok to life
during the last two years john iiosby and liaria had enjoyed a companionship that bordered on the sublime ihey seemed to sense one anothers thoughts moods emotions they vere held together by a bond of intimacy that neither of them could understand or explain lany times they said were just meant for each other and certainly that was true ihey had never cjuarrelled had never felt together
always they looked for and brought out the best in one another magnifying their affections
and yet they were not in love was a link between them as strong as any personal link could have hoped to be
they shared themselves with one another their thoughts their hopes their des pairs but there was no love involved
it seemed that one was extention of the other and that without one the other was incomplete
ihey had met and they had come together and now they were fulfilled
in all ways save one iheir inability to find love one for the other
john mosby sat far into the morning hours before a weariness fell upon him and sleep caused his eyelids to flutter
he relaxed in the chair stretched out his legs kicked off his shoes
hlowly he dropped into a light slumber
it seemed that he was still partially awake for the sounds of the room the ticking of the mantle olook the humming of the airconditioner the swirling of the colors over the canvas above his head were greatly magnified
he seemed to he sinking down into a warm mist which swirled about him and obscured his vision and rendered his body immobile
the swirling of the colors over the canvas above his head
yes yes he could hear the colors
he could hear the reds and the browns and the greens
the colors sounded so much different from the way they looked but he knew which was which
the lifuid gurgling that was the red
the rustling awkward scraping that was the green
and the soft humming vibration that was the brown
the sounds merged crept across his mind spread through his body bringing a warmth
you havenot found love said the sounds tugging at him found only plsure and temporary fulfillment they whispered liaria gives you strength but she can never give you love they murmured caressingly is no good for you but i am good for you
i can give you love
john hosby awakened with frightening abruptness
the voices of the painting still echoed in his mind
his hands gripped the arms of the chair and a great weakness held him in its frigid grasp
maria he said llaria
the sound of her name was unpleasant
maria
the thought of her face of her lips of her eyes that looked into his own was somehow obscured
the memories of taking her into his arms and holding her so near he pushed them out of his mind
rising from the chair he turned and looked at the painting
the red spirals and the green swoops and the brown undulations
they flowed and wriggled and contorted across the canvas
they shimmered and reflected the light dully and oarae alive with a thousand faint but perceptible movements
they formed soothing shapes and tender shapes and gentle shapes
he gaced into the depths and saw a core of softness that beckoned so irresistibly that he could not deny it
the reason i bought the painting john llosby thought was because i wanted love
the reason i bought the painting was because i felt that it contained all the love i could ever need or want
i didnot knoww it at the time but thats why i bought the painting
he had invited maria to his apartment that night as he had often done in the past ostensibly to share with her a large dinner he had prepared for them
but now he knew that was not the only nor the real reason for his having wanted her to come to his apartment on that particular night
he had wanted to show her the painting and in so doing to say goodbye to her
iheir lovemaking had been particularly violent that night just before he had left her
had she knowm what was happening
he recalled the look on her face the fear in her eyes when he showed her the picture
had she known then
flell it didnot matter whether she knew or not
she would find out soon enough
john moshy oroased the room and picked up the telephone
he dialed apartment and vaited for her to answer
all the while he watched the painting voice came from the receiver sounding very sleepy
this is john maria sorry to awaken you at this hour but theres something important i must tell you
the painting formed many shapes stretched out the colors and snapped them back moving curling contorting
he could hear the colors moving softly is it darling
maria asked and he was infuriated by the innocent tone of her voice
surely she must know
the colors were moving faster now becoming impatient for him to say what must be said and get it over with
he watched them fascinated by their subtle changes overwhelmed by the surge of warmth which passed through his body causing it to ache pleasurably with an inexplicable passion have called to say goodbye john llosby said the painting maria said that hideous painting
john mosby chuckled
it was the first time he had heard maria speak angry words and the sound was cold and rasping
here was a aide to maria that he had never seen
yes its the painting knew
i think i knew from the moment i saw it
but we have so much john
i canot understand how a painting a hideous painting like that could take it all away
the room was alive with the sound of the painting and john mosby wondered if maria could hear it also
it swelled in soft murmuring caresses it whispered gentle words that were not words at all but wondrous sensations
if maria could hear those sounds she would know or she should know what a marvelous thing the painting was
hurry called the painting
hurryl get it over wlth and he realized with a flutter of ant loi pat ion that the painting was jealous
maria had never been jealous of him
love made the difference
love made the jealousy
goodbye maria john mosby said dhe said something else but he didnot hear her words
he dropped the receiver back into its cradle
it wouldnot hurt maria too much ohe wouldnot miss him for his own self but she would miss him for the particular sameness that had held him to her
john mosby stretched forth his arms and started across the room toward the painting while the room swelled and pulsed to the rhythm of love that came from the painting in beating waves
the colors changed shape again and again and a single form finally solidified and became a face
pull red lips and soft green eyes and dark brown hair
a complexion that was light and clear and radiant
the eyes shone and the lips moved to form the words i love you john mosby moved across the room with fire in his chest and a vast longing in his mind
the room become very still and quiet as though time had frozen there
taking the painting gently from the wall john mosby held it tightly to his chest and closed his eyas and trembled as the fire of love burned through his being
and i love you he said

the editorial at tarious timaa in the past few months i ye been atruoh with the idea that i had something to say hut luokily these periods of madness hare been of short duration and now that the time for editorialiing is at hand i find myself floating upon a cloud of complacency of which any true christian would be envious
thus this page shall be devoted to a remarkable and engrossing historical biography on the life of one of the greatest humans who ever trod upon this kookie planet
the following is a quote morris but what is beyond the stars he would ask
other worlds eranoesco other stars which we see not
and beyond them
still others
yes but in the end in the very end
there is no end
there is no end repeated the boy and leonardo felt hand tremble within his in the light of the unmoving flame of a lamp burning on a little table in the midst of the astronomical instruments he saw that the childs face had become covered with sudden pallor where asked he slowly with growing amazement where is raradlse them messer leonardo the angels the martyrs the madonna and sod the father sitting on his throne and the son and the holy ghost
the master was about to retort that god is everywhere in all the grains of sand of the earth as wall as in the suns and the universes but kept his peace sparing the childs faith
the artist who does not doubt attains but little
tis a good thing for thee if thy creation be above the value thou dost set by it tis bad if it be equal to it but the greatest misfortune of all is for it to be below it which is the case with those who wonder how it was that god helped them to make anything so excellent

rapture filled her soul and gasping for breath she shouted and screamed like a swallow plunging into the sky sarrl up from below and steer clear we fly i we fly naked dishevelled hideous aunt sidonia was rushing beside her astride her soovel
they flew at such speed that the air they clave whistled in their ears like a hurricane
to the horthl to the north shouted the old woman guiding her soovel like an obedient steed
cassandra gave herself up to the intoxication of flight
but this mechanician of ours now this poor leonardo da vinci with his flying machines she recalled suddenly and become still merrier
now she would rise upvvards black clouds piled up beneath her blue lightnings quivering in their heart
up above was a clear sky with a full moon enormous dazzling round as a millstone and so near that it seemed one could touch it with ones hand
then she would direct the goat downward anew seizing him by his twisted horns and flew headlopg like a loosened stone into the bottomless abyss
vfliither goest thou
whither goest thou
thou wilt break thy neck
hast become mad thou devils wench vociferated aunt sidonia barely keeping up with her
and now they were rushing so near the ground that they heard the slumbrous grasses in the swamp rustling the nightfires lit their way and rotted logs glimmered bluely the tawny owl the bittern and the goatsucking whippoorwill called plaintively to one another within dreamy forests
they flew over the summits of the alps sparkling under the moon with their transparent bowlders of ice and descended to the surface of the sea
cassandra having scooped up some water in her hand flung it upward admiring the sapphire drops
with every moment their flight grew faster
more and more frequently did they come upon fellow wayfarers a grey shaggy wizard in a tub a merry prebendary potbellied rosyfaced like silenus on a poker a fairhaired girl of some ten years innocent of face blueeyed on a bathbroom a young naked rufous anthropophagite witch on a grunting boar and a multitude of others

the rufous one she who was galloping astride a hog with a squeal flew up to the church tore off the big bell oast it with all her force into a bog and as it splashed into a pool with a plaintive clang burst into laughter just as if she were barking
the fairhaired girl on the bathbroom began to clap her hands with mischievous playfulness

accept ye them

when the last sounds had died away and silence again fell the foirner voice that was like to the rumble of an earthquake again resounded bring me my spouse unespoused my dove undefiled
the high priest interrogated what is the name of thy spouse of thy dove undefiled
cassanflral madonna cassandral the answer rumbled forth
hearing her name the witch felt her blood turning to ioe in her veins felt the hair on her head stand up on end
madonna cassandral madonna cassandral the ory floated over the horde iifhere is she
ilfhere is our sovereign mistress
ave arobisponsa cassandral she covered her face with her hands and was fain to flee but bony fingers claws tentacles proboscides and shaggy spiders paws stretched forth seized her tore off her shift and drew her toward the throne starknaked and shivering
a goatish stench and the chill of death were wafted in her face
she oast down her eyes in order not to see fhen he that sate upon the throne spake saying come she bent her head still lower and saw at her very feet a fiery cross shining in the dark
making a supreme effort she overcame her loathing made a step and lifted up her eyes to him who rose up before her
and the miracle was wrought ihe goat s hide fell from him even as the shed skin sloughs from a snake and the ancient olympic god dionysos appeared before monna cassandra with a smile of eternal rejoicing on his lips holding a thyrsus uplifted in one hand a cluster with its tongue
and at the very same instant the sabbath was transformed into the divine orgy of baoohos the old witches into youthful maenads the monstrous demons into aegipedal satyrs and there where the dead bowlders of the chalky cliffs were sprang up colonnades of white marble illuminated by the sun between them in the distance the azure sea began to sparkle and cassandra beheld in the clouds the entire sunclad throng of the gods of hellas fhe satyrs the bacchantes striking tympani stabbing their nipples with knives siiueezing out the scarlet juice of grapes into kraterae of gold and mixing it with their own blood danced whirled and chanted glory glory to dionysos fhe great gods have arisen from the dead glory to the gods arisen fhe nude youth baoohos opened his embraces to cassandra and his voice was like unto thunder shaking heaven and earth come come my spouse my dove undeflled l cassandra sank into the embraces of the god

btallg begins why is it that so many science fiction writers and editors fail to inform themselves of some of the simple rules of english composition
they neednot know the more obscure ones they arenot expected to recognize the vocative case when they use it or the remnants in english of the instrumental case but they should be able to write clearly without confusing the reader by errors in grammar and vocabulary
instead of following ambrose exhortation to write it right they write it rough and leave it that way
but the genitive case for instance is something they should recognize understand and know to form
nevertheless the placing of the apostrophe is a frequent source of error
it is often found in the possessive pronouns ours theirs yours and hers and i am confidently expecting to find it some day in his
the possessive character of these words resides in the words themselves just as in mine thy thine etc it is not imparted to them by the addition oi with an apostrophe to denote some omission
yes the apostrophe even when used to form a possessive does indicate an omission
the original fora of book was johnne his boke by changes in spelling and the elision of an h this later became johnis boke and still later book a corollary feminine form such as jane book did not appear because at the time the language was being formed women did not own property
another error which appears to be common to science fiction authors is the inability to distinguish between lay and lie i should almost be willing to say that i have never seen lie used correctly in science fiction
but there isnot really anything difficult about it
all that is required is to know the principal parts of each verb and to remember that lie is intransitive it never takes an object and that lay is transitive it must have an object you must lay something somewhere and no jokes please probably the confusion arises from the fact that the past tense of lie looks and sounds the same as the present tense of lay
however the following table is memorizable in five minutes and should have been memorized in grade school by anyone who considers himself a sufficient master of the language to be a writer by dr raymond wallace infinitive to lie down or abed past past perfect present participle i lay down i have lain down i am lying down infinitive to lay somet hing own or anywhere past past perfect present participle i lay it down laid it down i have laid it down i am laying it down all there is to it nothing more is required
the verb to lie repose should not be confused with the verb lie
to tell a the latter verb
principal parts he lied lied lying is quite a different word with a different etymology
present i lie down present should know what a predicate adjective is and use it when required rather than use an adverb
so say that someone looks badly does not mean that he looks unveil it means that is vision is faulty lo say that he felt badly does not mean that he was depressed or ill it means that his tactile sense was defective
if you feel bad say so
if there is uncertainty over the proper form of a particular word substitute another in the construction to see what form it should take
ihere is no confusion over the differing meanings of looking anxious and looking anxiously host science fiction authors do avoid the use of a double negative when only one is required but they are not so skilful in avoiding a triple negative when they want only a double fhey seem to be misled by the fact that a negative construction sometimes uses words which by themselves are not recognizably negative cannot help but go is a common example of three negative where only two are wanted
xhe intended meaning is that he must go but not help and hut are all negatives in this construction
a double negat ive makes a positive a triple negative is equivalent to a single negative
he cannot help going is a correct form of the intended expression he cannot but go is another a little stilted nowadays perhaps but still serviceable
a particular source of error among writers of science fiction is the confusion of a certain group of words with others which are similar in sound or appearance even though in some oases they may he opposite in meaning
ihis is nothing but fuzzy thinking and a science fiction author in particular ought to keep his wits keen
sxarnples are wrack and rack flout flaunt livid florid wreak wreck torturous full uls ome noisy noisome exercise exorcise and many more
a writer ought no to be content ne rely to co nt inue using a word in what he supposes to he its meaning
it should be his goal over a period of years to look up in the dictionary every word he uses not only for its precise meaning and other possible meanings but for its derivation in order to understand the subtle connotations arising from its etymology

my es and six years old and in the first last time around in case you didnot know this portion of our column was used to introduce your affable and illustrious columnist
this time due to a complete paucity of requests for similar material will continue this department by presenting the stirring story of my hometown
gotta be a nonconformist ya know the crowd say do something ya canot just go do it

huntsville alabama is the generally accepted name of the quaint little village were visiting in this months trailer though little chicago is also coming into vogue
to our civicminded citizens however huntsville is rocket city stirring eh wot
how did this colorful title come into its present worldwide disrepute that dear reader shall here be discussed
it seems that a couple of years ago some damned fool noting that redstone arsenal is the major rocket resoarch base galluraphed off to city hall with a bright idea for getting famous and looked upon awe
all thats needed stated this rightthinking dullwit is that the city be subtitled the rocket city
our typically bright energetic chamber of commerce quickly went ape over the scheme doubtless thinking of our immddiate fame and lasting universal recognition of the countless industries clamoring to get into our town
here we slip in a dramatization for extra effect the scene is the plush central office of blehh enterprises inc the speaker a young junior executive named a backer of togetherness a suburbanite and the proud owner of highpowered late model tailfins
as camera pulls in for a closeup we do a slow dissolve into the action it seems to me and my conclusion was reached only after long hours of thought and a great deal of study that we should move our largest factories and several of our principal branch offices to huntsville
for after all is huntsville not the rocket city
slow fade by camera as the house lights are turned up the fading sound track a conglomeration of the rabid shouts of the supporting oast shouts a proclaiming the brilliance of this suggestion b promising the immediate advancement of and
cl quibter murmurs of the old corporation members as they contentedly realize that theyll be able to leave good ol blehh in good hands when they pass on and like that things started rolling fast with the think on the council pressing the matter
before long out came an intriguing little booklet called by some strange working of the spirits huntsville the rocket city
gosh
such originality there
this book naturally became an instantaneous nationwide hit relating to all the beautiful story of how john hunt ah these cleancut caucasions built his log cabin at the site of the big spring fabled from time immemorial in indian legends
well it must have been an instantaneous nationwide hit if i may baoktraok there to quote the writings of a great man
after all wasnot it an overnight sellout here
indeed it was
enough of this mockery being broadminded and earlaas i fear i must admit that it does not appear likely that this stirring document ever got out into th outer world land of shadow beings much past lily flagg
but nearly everybody in town since they bought it decided that we had become fabulously famous and that soon we would be drenched with inquiries from people wanting to spend their money here

it was titled radio limes sounds today and a portion of it is reproduced below mistakes sloppy pacing and runtogetherwords may be solitarily accredited to the editor poor excuse for april hugo oernsbeok long a leader in the publishing of radioand electronics magazines has in formed radio times that this month he will release as an experiment a flagazine consis ting entirely of pseudoscientific fiction or as he calls it scientifiction
mr gernsbeck founded the worlds first radio magazine modern electronics in in he published his fantastic serial ralph high sales encouraged gernsbeok to continue publishing these in later magazines such as science and invention which had stories not only by gernsbeck but by outside writers the editors of radio times deplore the practice of selling such material as mr gernsbeck scientifiction in a package advertised as containing electronic facts
such fads included only to boost sales figures can do nothing but harm
while many of us strive to bring radio magazines into the respectability they fully deserve rich schemes of a few tend to teardown all we have accomplished
wildeyed scientifiot ional stories are not what the readerswant
as has been proved time and time again the best policy is to stick with articles on the electronics field and try to combat the bad image created in the ipublic eye bythesefads we sincerely hope that mr gernsbeck will recognize his mistake and return topublishing the factual type of material that gave him his start
james harassthee second april issue out middle of august i was down at the university of alabama last weekend for a veddy fine rash party and after my head cleared i realized that an idea that would shake fandom had hit me and and and and the cult and the six fingers and innumerable other groups think a lot of themselves

frank baum the emerald city of oz tea this really is the real editorial tho it will probably turn out pretty much the same as the other cor unreal one with or without the swans since its being written by the same goof anyhow

one of my aunts loaned me a book just a privately printed little job on the life of my greatgrandmother called poems and prose by kate terry pearson and it contains her account of her life in addition to a collection of tender poems
