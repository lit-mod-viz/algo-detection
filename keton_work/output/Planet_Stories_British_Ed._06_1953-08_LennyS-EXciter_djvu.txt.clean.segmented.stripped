in the webbed hands of the stolid greenfaced ones rests the screece gem
some say its a fabulous diamond some an emerald some a ruby but caine guessed it was death itself
high above the ivet plains and muggy jungles above the slick rocks and shiny leaves rests a temple
like most shrines of ancient order its narrowing spires point to the sky
men venusian men walk quietly through therestricted labyrinth of this temple green fingers webbed beneath the long sleeves of their gray capes green faces expressionless beneath the sanctity of their gray hoods
there is movement and these caped men circle a silver orb that lies in dead center of the golden walls
they pace each flat step a soundless motion
the green fingers unmesh spread and come together again
screece says a flutelike voice
screece says another
the silver orb rests like a cloudy fistsized tinsel globe unsparkling while a dozen minds search out through the vastness of venus probing for the cores of evil and purity
feet pace faces are immobile and through the thick air comes a shrill rising scream from the throat of a giant black cat with deep orange eyes
the motion ceases lidless stares meet
grith pronounces one
grith pronounces another
and the pacing continues while green lips quirk the slightest bit
minds search i that season when the jungle of venus turned into a vapid steaming swamp
sleet buds glistened like long thin snakes and leaves hung limp and wet from the vinetrees
nicholas caine felt the sweat prickle upon his forehead and slide down the sides of his face
fairchild he noticed was sweating too so that the mans shirt had turned dark and the closeclipped gray hair curled on his head
only the woman still looked fresh in her white shirt and shorts
she was standing beside jetcopter drinking plain scotch from a silver glass
her husband fairchild was drinking too as he sat silently in a folding chair beneath the tip of the ships left wing
this is going to be a sweet thing caine thought it really is
the air was dead of breeze and soggy clouds hung above them like an immense stifling blanket
the man stared at his knees and the woman swirled the scotch in her glass
caine kept liis palms flat against the arm rests of his chair
he watched the woman closely
there was too much brightness inside of her too much nervousness as though she were burning inside and she had to keep moving laughing insulting enticing because she was alive with that burning and she couldnot stop
it wasnot the liquor caine knew because they had just started that a few minutes after he had brought the ship down
they were approximately fourhundred miles from the colony and in the wild stretches of this venusian jungle fourhundred miles was like the distance from day to night
here was the dark the strange the weird and the wild
kiitz birds screamed in the distance and their sound was like the sound a man makes when he is touched by fire
a thick muddy river went over a cliff above and behind them hitting transparent rocks with a steady crashing noise that thrummed against ears like thunder in a distant sky
teewh birds with black wings and curling yellow beaks came out of the sultry sky and skimmed the tips of the trees surrounding the clearing
they screeched when they dove and they kept harmony with the unseen stationary kiitz birds
a chilling nerveracking harmony you have a drink with us said the woman her teeth white between her smiling lips
thank you no caine said
the woman tipped her head and watched him
her eyes were very blue and they mocked caine and taunted him while her husband just sat there drinking and watching his bare knees
this could go to pieces in a hurry caine decided and he rubbed his palms against the arms of the chair
because on the other hand the husband was too quiet too brooding too deliberate unseeing of the way his wife played with caine with her eyes and her movements
her legs caine noticed were the kind that would look well bare as they were or in nylon beneath a skirt and she had rather full hips although not too full
her breasts caine could see were well enough developed
she bent to rub a finger against her left knee
are there insects in this part of the jungle she asked caine
some
but no grith cats she said straightening
not here caine said
just where were going tomorrow
yes
caine looked back to the man
he was about fifty caine judged at least twenty years older than the woman
his face was lean and sad and there were thin lines traveling out from the corners of his eyes and mouth that contrasted with the youthful cut of his wiry hair
these two had come to caine because his reputation in the colony was established
he had been flying tourists into the jungle for more than three years and while he could not predict all of this country he at least knew the general traits of those sections within a reasonable radius of the colony
did you ever shoot a grith cat the woman asked looking at caine over her glass
no said caine
but youve heard that theyre pretty horrible and dangerous
yes
caine wiped a hand at the sweat on his forehead
the woman was working at the cats her eyes shifting to look at her husband with every word to see how he was reacting
so far he had done nothing said nothing only sat there and drank
however the cats were not the reason the couple were in the venusian jungle
hunting animals was a dead sport for them something done in the past and something which had become boring
they were looking for bigger game now
the screece gem
and they had flown all the way from earth to mars from mars to venus to find it
the screece gem was a myth caine was certain a bit of fantasy out of ancient venusian lore
but they paid him well for the trip and he would ask no questions
the woman stayed with the cats
how big are these grith cats mr caine
eight to ten feet long caine said
about like a large horse
only theyre cats with the claws and the fangs and all
essentially
caine felt himself tightening inside a little
the woman was trying to break through her husbands armor because somewhere sometime he must have had trouble hunting a catlike animal
tiger
or panther
the martian frynx perhaps
but she had not found her target yet
the man raised his head and spoke for the first time since they had landed
how far away is this temple would you say mr caine
fifty miles caine said
how close to it can we land
eight or ten miles i imagine we get closer than that the man asked donot think so caine said
the temple is on top of a fairly sheer rise of land and i canot put the ship down there
the nearest clearing well find will be about eight or ten miles away
mrs fairchild walked to her chair and sat down
that means then that well have to go through that much country where the cats are
caine didnot answer and the man returned to gazing at his knees
time moved slowly in the thick wet jungle
mr caine your scar charles the woman said her voice sudden out of the silence
fairchild picked up his glass from the arm of his chair and held it tightly in front of his waist
the muscles along his bare forearms were ridged and his knuckles paled as he held the glass be bashful the woman said smiling sure mr caine would like to see what a cat can do
she looked at caine as though she were about to tell him a delightfully domestic story that had been until now nurtured between just her husband and her
this was a leopard mr caine
a long vicious leopard
mr fairchild you see didnot hit him right and so he got charles from about here she tapped herself just below the neck to here
she touched her waist a long scar mr caine it charles
about three inches wide and
the man brought his glass down against the arm of the chair
shut up janet tell you nicely
just shut up
charles she said blinking in exaggerated surprise just wanted to tell mr caine because hes hunted too and while i donot know if these grith cats are anything like leopards
the mans eyes had become wide and angry wonot tell you again janet sorry charles
she smiled at him assuringly and blinked again just excited about tomorrow i guess arenot we
fairchild returned his stare to his glass noticed it was empty and filled it
i interest you in a drink yet mr caine
mrs fairchild said
not right now caine said
oh
her voice pouted
but i think we should celebrate
here charles and i have come all this way to find the screece gem and were sitting within fifty miles of it and i think we all ought to celebrate airchild spoke to caine without raising his head
maybe mr caine doesnot really believe in the existence of the screece gem
do you mr caine he said looking took a cigarette from a package in his shirt just paid to get you to a temple not to think evading the question fairdiild said
his eyes were narrow now and a bit glaxed
caine lit his cigarette and blew smoke into the damp air
he kept his voice noncommittal heard about it
everybody in the colony has heard about it
correction said fairchild
everybody in the system has heard about it a very popular myth caine agreed
the man stood up
it is not a myth mr caine
it exists and its in that temple do you hear me
there is no dammed myth about it just cold hard fact and going to find it and take it out of there
is that clear
caine watched tlie mans taut figure
he inhaled his cigarette told you mr fairchild just paid to fly the ship and not paid to think responsible for getting you to the temple all
listen fairchild said crossing to caine and reaching for the front of shirt get insolent with me
caine slapped the mans hand away charles the woman said
the man blinked and touched his slapped hand against his chest
sorry mr came he said finally mean to fly off that way
little nervous you see
all that time in space searching around this way just this close and getting too nervous
he turned back to his chair and sat down
his face became very sad again and the lines about his mouth and eyes seemed deeper
the woman laughed lightly
you donot want to pay any attention to charles when hes this way she said to caine just that this means so much to him finding the screece gem worth the wealth of the system thej say and so charles has to have it mr caine
because he hasnot got any more money
for heavens sake janet the man pleaded
are you ashamed of being poor she asked with false concern
she stood up and began pacing back and forth and caine noticed the easy way she moved her hips swaying the muscles of her long legs rippling
no hes not ashamed of being poor she said looking at caine afraid of it arenot you charles
fairchild tipped his glass to his lips and when he brought it down caine could see that it was empty again
the man refilled the glass and held it in front of him looking into it as though he might find another world there a peaceful world where there werenot any cats or beautiful women with reddish hair a world where there might be peace and no fear
he raised the glass trying to taste of that world
his eyes were getting filmy tell you why hes afraid of being poor mr caine the woman went on because not only is charles a yellow punk when it comes to cats but hes frightened of losing his wife arenot you charles
caine felt himself tensing under tlie cutting lilt of the womans voice
he was observing something he knew that should have been contained in the seal of marital privacy
but here he was caught in the middle of it while the woman swung back and forth and the man seemed to crumple further into his chair hanging on to the glass of scotch as though that were all he had left to hang on to
and tomorrow they had ten miles of grith country to span on foot
sweet caine repeated to himself really sweet you see the woman said kj stopping and turning to caine thinks the only way he can hold me is with money
and now hes put every penny he had left into this hunt so that he can find the screece gem and keep his lovely wife
and do you know what mr caine
she placed her hands gently on her hips and caine could see the faintest swinging movement in them right you see
caine remained very silent
he has to find the screece gem the woman said smiling whitely or lovely janet is gone slipped right out of his hands
and charles is just a poor little sheep with gray hair and a two inch scar wholl be cold and alone while janet stop it damn it
fairchild said but he didnot get up and his voice was thick while janet the woman said her voice even and relentless will be sleeping with someone else who can afford her and poor old charles will shiver in his damned freezing bed all alone thinking about that wondering who it is burning up his ancient jealous liver
the woman whirled to face her husband
the man tightened both hands around his glass and caine could see the whiteness about his mouth
the woman began to laugh a soft pealing laugh that got into brain because of the very softness of it
she valked back to her chair and lifted her own glass
her laughter stopped while she drank and then it started again
she turned to look at her husband and her eyes danced and her lips curved
her body shook with the laughter
who do you think itll be she asked her husband
if you donot find the gem
she turned to caine
mr caine do you have any money
i mean perhaps you wouldnot need as much money as charles
i might make some compensation for verility you know
caine disregarded her
mr fairchild we have some rugged country to cover tomorrow
this is your party of course but if you keep on drinking
if i keep on drinking
caine examined the mans eyes and his planet stories july slack mouth
nothing caine said
nothing
at least he decided the scotch might stop the needling and the pressure for the man
he deserved that much perhaps
you didnot answer me mr caine the woman said
about you and me like you to answer so that my husband knows before he falls out of his chair you see think we all ought to get some sleep caine said quietly
mr caine really
so sudden have to check your bankbook first of course
although if you give me your word
if you donot mind caine said his voice harsh like to be left neutral in whatever you and mr fairchild might have in conflict
oh she said
well thats just because you havenot seen the full potential
let me show you what youd be getting for your money the way charles saw it
she raised her glass again drank and stood up to cross to the ship
she climbed the ladder to the cabin very gracefully and touched the switch of the radio
music pealed into the warm air
it was minor music issuing from the colony station music that had been taken from the native venusian melodies
it had been converted and fitted to the heavy rhythm of ancient africa and it seemed suddenly to become a part of this jungle of venus
the woman stood in the doorway and then she moved down the ladder as though it were one sliding motion
she remaineed there her back against the silver metal of the ship swaying her hips moving her shoulders was a dancer you see mr caine
i worked in a very expensive club in habrill on mars
i was very popular and very good and sweet charles took me away from it all didnot you charles
fairchild caine could see was having trouble focusing his eyes but the rhythmic music was heavy in the air and it beat against the ears and caine knew that the man was aware of what was happening
the woman began moving easily toward caine her movement a practised swinging motion of hips and shoulders
this is what charles took me awav from mr caine by the gentle touch of gold she said
come with me he said and he fitted diamonds to my ears and rings to my fingers
let me take you away from the damned searching eyes of every man on mars
let me hide you so no one can see you or touch you but me and give you i own that right charles she said looking at him with narrow gleaming eyes
the man lifted his glass and slowly drained it
he let it fall to the ground with a breaking crunch while the woman kept time with the rhythm with her hips and her shoulders slight swinging motions that only intimated
only now the woman said poor charles doesnot have anything more to give and so here i go again
she raised her hands over her head and cracked her palms together
her hips swung and her shoulders shook
she caught her fingers in her hair her teeth white and biting while her whole body shivered
it was a rippling gyration of muscle and pink skin building furious
fairchild pushed himself out of the chair
his eyes were wild and vacant he said and his words were meshed together so that it was a hoarse sound full of anguish
the woman laughed a wild laugh that blended with the music and the frenzied movement of her body
she whirled and slapped her hands together and her body quivered
the man staggered a step forward
janet donot please he fell forward sprawling over the ground
gradually the woman ceased her movement while her laughter rang through the wet jungle
the graycaped figures hold motionless tvround the muddy stiver orh
a green head cocks
another
the golden ivdls encase them and only a circular opening near a tip of a spire brings in dim light atid a little of the wispish outside vapor
fingers disengage and a green extends from a gray cape
the hand sweeps in a downward slice splitting by symbol purity from evil
a second hand imitates a third
a dozen
voices flute to the cloudy orh
a cat snarls
minds probe he light was dimming and she was a dark curving figure standing over the crumpled figure of the man
the music pounded relentlessly
caine stood up
each time i make one of these trips he said looking at the motionless form of fairchild promise myself itll be the last and promising myself again right now
the woman stood silent and there was just her smiling mouth and the white teeth and the reddish hair
but this one isnot over yet mr caine
we still have a long way to go
her eyes danced right mrs fairchild vaine said bending to lift the man
unfortunately thats right
he picked the man up while the woman watched and he carried him to the ship
he climbed to the cabin working against the surprising weight of the smaller man
for his age fairchild was a very tough sinewy man who looked as though he had spent most of his life fighting through strange and varied wilds constantly in seardi of new adventures and thrills
caine laid tlie man across a bunk built into the rear of the ships cabin
the tip end of the wide scar was visible now showing above open shirt and the thin lines about the eyes and mouth were like written entries in his face telling of too much scotch and perhaps too much of the reddishhaired woman
all that he lacked caine thought wryly was the empty bank account to show the price he had paid for the love of the devilish woman
caine straightened and walked back through the cabin snapping off the radio
he jumped to the ground
the light was very dim now and the woman was only an outline
the screams of kiitz birds were in the air again and in the distance the thrumming monotony of the falls
you can use the cabin with your husband mrs fairchild caine said briskly get some blankets and sleep out here there animals
not around here caine said make a fire
if you want something to eat get it out of the cabin for you no thank you mr caine the woman said sitting down in her chair just enjoy the rest of my drink if you donot mind up to you caine said shortly
he was very careful to keep his eyes away from her
you handled a woman like that best he knew by keeping your eyes away from her
he gathered wood from beneath the wet outer layer of the jungle floor
he bent to light the fire just as the darkness enveloped the clearing
the flames flickered and licked upward sending their shifting yellow light into the surrounding foliage
caine straightened from the fire
dd you like my dance the woman asked softly didnot see it for your husband mrs fairchild caine said and he returned to the ship where he got several blankets
he placed them near the fire not around now the woman said
caine looked at her finally
he is as far as concerned so noble mr caine not anything caine said just a guide who gets paid for taking people where they want to go
nothing more do you understand mrs fairchild
no she said smiling at him
caine walked to his chair and sat down
we have a tough day ahead of us mrs fairchild and well need all the strength we have to get through that stretch of jungle
this is a different jungle than youve seen before
venus breeds some terrible country and where were going is that kind of country
i havenot been there myself so i canot even predict what itll be like
but circled it in the ship and its thick and alive
i donot trust it
so you can stay up if you like and be glad to stay awake myself but advise some sleep right now
mrs fairchild stood up slowly her fingers drifting over her waist tell you mr caine not the kind of man i like to argue with had just enough liquor to feel perfectly agreeable to anything anyway
so get ready for bed but sorry you didnot enjoy my dance do this
you wait while i get ready and then well have one nightcap together a sort of dancing nightcap
are you interested mr caine
caine lit a cigarette slowly watching the blaze of his lighter
he snapped the lighter shut interested in both you and your husband mrs fairchild
to hell with my husband she said her teeth showing between her lips
she lifted her glass and drank all that was in it
relax mr caine she said walking toward the ship
enjoy yourself
caine noticed that the liquor had taken hold of the way she walked so that she swayed a little but there was still the grace there and the swing and it was hard to disregard
i hope she doesnot come out of there caine thought
i hope she just falls asleep and leaves me alone and that tomorrow goes very quickly and smoothly ut when caine had watched the flames lick at the settling night for a few minutes and had finished his cigarette he heard the sound again
the sound of music muffled by the silver body of the ship
wilder now with heavier drums seasoned into a more biting sound by the night and the flickering flames
caine was aware of the blood in his veins and the pulse in his temples
all at once the door of the cabin was kicked open and the music rose in the air
the woman stood in the doorway her hands gripping the silver frame tightly
she wore a black nightgown made of shimmering stuff that was as thin as the fine mist in the air
her hair had been let down and it fell over her shoulders and her back
her feet were bare and very white beneath the black gown
she stood motionless her fingers tight against the frame as though holding herself against the music
the melody disappeared then and there was only the drums rolling and finding a punctuation that became all that existed in the night
the woman leaped from the doorway and she touched the ground wriggling
her feet were widespaced and her hands searched through her hair lifting it from the nape of her neck
she bent forward suddenly so that her hair was a reddish swirl against the light of the leaping flames
she straightened slowly one hand sliding her hair back so that caine could see her eyes dancing with her body and she began moving toward him shoulders swinging hips pivoting
caine kept his hands tight against the arms of his chair his eyes narrow woman was a writhing movement beneath the black veillike gown
she twisted and whirled and finally she stopped in front of caine chin high one hand still halfthrust through the soft thick hair
her eyes glowed
nightcap she said her voice breathless
caine shifted carefully in his chair not thirsty he said
the womans hand snapped from her hair and the relaxed suppleness of her body tightened remember a man caine said through his teeth a dozen yards away sleeping in the protection of alcohol because a cheap burlesque queen is drawing out his blood until hes damned near dead
i can see through the pink skin mrs fairchild and what i see makes me sick
you donot interest me at all and you never will because i donot like the sight of hate and selfishness and just plain rottenness
she struck him across the face with one hand and then the other
the fury burned in her eyes and her body trembled with it
she struck him again and again and face bled where a ring ripped his skin
he sat very still his hands remaining against the chair arms just lost yourself a boy mrs fairchild
put your clothes on were flying back to the colony
you can find yourself somebody else for this because had enough
he started to rise but she put one hand against his chest and the fury was gone out of her eyes and there were tears instead
please she said and caine could hear the tears going into her voice sorry awfully sorry
let me talk to you first please
she knelt to the ground and watched caine while thin tears ran down her cheeks
about what mrs fairchild
caine said coldly donot know why i did what i did she said touching at the tears
too much scotch i think
only still a dancer and its in my blood
it isnot cheap burlesque mr caine something deep inside me and i canot help it
nice trait caine said for a mans wife had that coming got a lot coming only the resentment for his drinking the way hes tried to own me keeps coming out and i want to hurt him
i know it isnot right but its what i do and i want to stop doing it worried and it comes out with what he says and what he does and so i fight him
he thinks if he doesnot find this gem hes going to lose me he
caine asked his eyes thin
no she said quietly frightened of him and i feel alone with him
but i wonot leave him
like i told you caine said just a hired man
what my customers think or do between themselves is none of my business not that cold she said looking into his eyes that cold
she shook her head stubbornly
be kind to me
you can
for just this one moment when not alone or afraid when theres just this one moment before tomorrow when it starts all over again
caine didnot answer but he relaxed in his chair slightly and leaned back
she smiled at him and it was a warm simple smile with all the hardness and sarcasm erased
would you have one drink with me
one small drink to seal the night up so maybe you wonot remember me so badly so maybe youll think got some heart and human feelings
caine waited watching her shiny eyes
one drink he said
she smiled and stood up returning to the side of the ship where fairchild had set up his portable bar
she poured two glasses and while caine watched her he noticed that in her straight motionless posture the animal litheness had disappeared
she was very simple and naivelooking and when she returned he saw that the tears were still wet on her face
she handed him a glass and she held her own in the air trite toast heres to two people who met in the venus night briefly
two people caine repeated lifting his own glass
the scotch burned down his throat
she kneeled again and smiled at him
caine noticed then that the music was still beating into the night ar and that the black gown was stll very thin
he turned his glass up again to hurry through the drink
even in her simplicity and tears he didnot trust himself
the scotch seemed to take hold of his blood and he could feel it racing in his veins
he lifted the glass a third time and the hand that held it seemed suddenly detached from his own movement
a singing began in his head and then disappeared and when he looked at her the smiling lips were redder and the shining teeth were whiter
the music pulsated in his head seeming to beat against his brain
what he began and his voice was thick
he shook his head and looked at his glass
it fell out of his hand little witchs potion she said rising
something from the martian caldron
quick and oh so effective
he fought the feeling that caught hold of him
his brain seemed to deaden until there was only the drums inside his head and his senses became alive and burning
he could see her before him and she began to sway back and forth her hands moving in front of her face
he caught hold of the chair arms to keep his own hands from reaching out
he tried to cling to reason but his hands wanted to escape
the flames of the fire flickered somewhere in the distance and in front of him the blackcovered body began to move in rippling shivers
the moving pink hands rose in the air and there was a shimmer of concealed muscles dancing dancing
he clung to the chair gritting his teeth but the drums pounded at his senses over and over and the lips smiled and the white teeth shone and the pink body moved in time with the drums
not yet he heard her say somewhere far away
and the body turned slowly convoluting in a shimmering dance of thin blackness
caine lost his grip on the chair and he was moving his hands
he heard the laughter high in the air stinging his ears and he couldnot stop himself
he was listening to the laughter when his fingers touched skin and there was only blackness after that
minds examine jndge
decide
grith says a round voice bars snap open
a black cat croiuhes
green heads nod within their hoods
the cat leaps crouches again and then begins to stalk
udless eyes turn to the cold orb
voices chant
grith
ill awoke as a boot caught the side of his head
he rolled across the ground the pain exploding inside his head
hie boot found him again
another time above his eyes
he moaned trying to make his muscles work but it was as though he were still caught in a nightmare
filthy damned swine he heard and his eyes watched a fist come out of the misty air to smash against his cheek
he rolled again burying his face against the ground trying to hide to protect himself until he could find his senses and his coordination kill him
it was a womans voice saying this a lilting feminine voice that was very very familiar
caine tensed himself waiting for the next blow
get up a man said
caine felt the boot against his legs
he turned over slowly and pulled himself to a sitting position
he shook his head but the thick mist that was in the morning air seemed to have gotten into his brain
his arms and legs felt as though lead had been poured into his veins
slowly it came back to him
the woman
the scotch
he searched the fogfilled area in front of him
fairchild his mouth an ugly line watched him and in his hand was pistol
the woman was behind fairchild still in the black gown and caine could see that it was torn kill you right now fairchild said his voice hoarse with rage but i want that gem
get up
darling the woman said to her husband while her eyes danced at caine such a mess
caine tried to swallow and even that was difficult
every part of his body had been taken hold of by the drug that had been put into his liquor and each movement was a task he was certain he couldnot complete
he raised a hand slowly to his face and his fingers came away sticky
get up
fairchild growled his eyes vicious thin slits
caine got to his knees and fell flat again
he clutched at the ground waiting for the crushing boot
it came and he tried again
he got to his knees the second time and then inch by inch ne stood up
for a moment it seemed as though his head were floating awa from his shoulders and he looked uown at his body thinking that what he saw curely belonged to someone else a limp ragged body cut and bruised with no clotnes
he was falling again
fairchild caught arm and jerked him upright give you two minutes to get your damned clothes on caine and get behind the controls of that ship
he looked at fairchild stupidly
the man shook him turned around and searched for his clothes beside the dead fire
he staggered and groped and twice blackness covered his eyes and he went to his knees
finally he stood weaving clothed haphazardly and he was vaguely aware that blood was sliding down his chin dripping onto his jacket
he touched the blood with a finger and it didnot mean anythii to him
the man turned to his wife same goes for you
get into the cabin
charles she pleaded
he made me drink so much
go on
fairchild said waving the pistol
she smiled crookedly and walked toward the ship
the mist lay over the jungle so thickly that the ship not more than ten or twelve yardi away was barely visible
caine heard the door of the cabin opening and closing
fairchild pointed the gun at stomach again better watch every damned step you take he said
this gun is going to stay on you until get that screece gem and rhe only reason youre alive you bloody louse is because i have to have it
do you understand
caine searched for his voice and it came thick and strained fly you
he watched the mans face whiten and the gun trembled in hand
then the gun was swinging through the air and caine watched it coming until it struck him above the eyes dripped from his face and his chest and he fought for air
his brain was a singing maize of pain and the numbness in his arms and legs kept him riveted to the ground
he opened his eyes finally as he felt himself being dragged across the clearing
the rungs of the ladder leading to the ships cabin were against him
he moved his head and his teeth struck silver metal
his coordination was gone and he couldnot tell what his movements were going to be
up ihe steps he heard fairchild say behind him
he lifted his hands fitting them around the rungs of the ladder and he began to pull himself up
it was an inching effort
blood got in his eyes and his head whirled into faraway spins that had nothing to do with the movement of his body
he hung onto the ladder and climbed one rung then another
he teetered near the top and fairchild pushed him into the cabin where he sprawled
he could hear fairchild coming up behind him and the door slammed shut
caine rolled onto his back and looked up
she was standing over him in fresh wnite shorts and blouse
her hair now was very neat and groomed and her pink skin was lauiant
she smiled at him her teeth showing very whitely a pretty thing mr caine
he knew he should have felt the rage then the instinctive fury for what she had done to him
but the drug had left him with nothing but enough reaction to try to fight for consciousness and strength
clean him up fairchild said
fast
then were leaving
the woman got soap and water from the rear of the cabin washed face her fingers cruel against the cuts and swellings
she raked the cuts with stinging medicine and caine lay unmoving trying to let time feed him new strength
she stood up finally looking at her husband
all right fairchild said go caine
caine looked at the mans face at the set of his mouth
he looked at the gun and then at the mans boots
he pulled himself up and staggered into the seat behind the controls
his movements on the controls were slow and rough
he looked at fairchild once as the jets fired into the fogladened air fly this way
no balance coordination rotten i the man moved the pistol into side
caine faced the instrument panel trying to keep from weaving
he moved his hands and felt tlie ship rising
he tried to keep the rise steady and gradual but his hands jerked
the ship tipped and swung toward the side of the clearing
thick vinetrees came out of the fog and caine forced the ship straight up the jets roaring
the silver jetcopter swung back and forth climbing slipping dropping
he couldnot move the controls properly
the sound of the waterfall was in their ears then and caine jambed the ship to the opposite side
they touched the tops of the trees and finally he brought it up enough to be over the jungle and the rods
instinct gave caine vague direction and he kept his altitude exaggerated to insure against his faulty senses
some say the screece gem is a diamond the woman said dreamily
some say its an emerald
some say its a ruby
what do you say it is charles fairchild sat motionless silent in the seat beside caine
he still held the pistol so that the muzzle pointed into side try anything caine he said smash us all to hell before give up
caine flew the ship romantic isnot it the woman said from behind caine
the most valuable gem in the world deep in the venusian jungle protected by the long long cats and my sweet cnarles is going to get it for me
bless you charles
you are an extraordinary husband
i hope the cats donot get you
caine heard the words but his brain was too slow and thick with the drug to understand the sharpness of her words
he only moved the controls feeling the gun fairchild held against him
in this condition he knew that if he tried to fool fairchild the man his nerves tightened the way they were would not hesitate to pump the pistol into body
caine worked his fingers numbly
if only he could find his control his response they were approaching thee area where caine thought the temple should be
somewhere he said and his tongue was clumsy as he tried to speak
somewhere he mist was like layers of soft tissue around the ship
the visibility was not much more than the length of the wings
he eased the ship down slowly foot by foot
a golden pikeshaped object appeared beside the right wing
caine brought the ship up
he grinned a sly sudden grin
temple he said foolishly have hit it closer sober
he thought about the cleverness of what he had just said laughing over it inside noticing with a queer detachment how his words came out as though he had been drinking
the damned drug he thought but the laughter came up through him and it echoed through the cabin
caine felt the gun go hard against his side the steel bruising his ribs
his laughter was cut short as though a gag had been slammed across his mouth help he began
but face was close to his own make you laugh caine the man whispered furiously make you laugh over what happened
you think about that eh
you think about that you bloody
vaguely caine knew the pistol had been pulled away from his ribs and was whipping toward arm
he tried to shift out of its way but he caught it squarely
the pain paralyzed him and even the sound of his cry was caught by his teeth snapping together
the ship wavered and slid downward
you stupid fool the woman screamed at her husband
caine felr himself sliding out of his seat the pain throbbing
he caught himself and reached for the controls with his good hand
but he only halfbalanced the ship before he saw the tip of a vinetree
he cut the jets
the trees were all around them enveloping them
he listened to the snap of the wings heard distantly the splinter of glass then nothing
he was looking at the shape of his arm when he found his vision again
it was bent peculiarly
whose crazy damned arm is that he thought
somehow his brain wanted him to laugh to slap the comic twisted arm lying in front of his eyes
the laughter was in his mouth and through his teeth and he raised his good hand
oh lord he said suddenly sober and feeling the blinding pain
he caught his good hand around a broken metal shaft and the pain drew tears to his eyes
i think just go to sleep and die right now he thought wondering vaguely where his will and his strength had gone
did they bleed out he thought
did they fall out when the man struck him
did the woman draw them out last night like a vampire draws out blood
good night he thought dimly dropping his hand from the shaft
he closed his eyes
he was screaming he knew and somewhere he heard a mans voice say the gauze
the gauze
it was a grating sound like a metal wheel turning over gravel
he opened his eyes and fairchild was wrapping the gauze around his broken arm splinted from a part of the cabin duelling
fairchild looked at him
there was a thick growth of gray whiskers stubbling the mans chin and cheeks cain noticed and the mans eyes were not sad any more
they appeared to burn like his wifes
he grinned at caine and it was a humorless grin his teeth set tightly together lucky caine he said set it instead of cutting it off
caine watched the grinning stubbled face
he felt a shudder trembling through his body and the sweat on his face turned cold not nic caine he thought
surely not just a frightened chilled man with no guts or reason
i am a rubber puppet thats who i am
pull the strings mr puppet master
get up said fairchild right caine mumbled smiling crazily
he pushed himself up and stood swaying in the cabin of the broken ship
he looked around his eyes suddenly fierce
is this twisted wreck my pretty silver ship he asked loudly
oh no he said and tried to kick at a splintered panel
he felt himself pitching forward and he caught out his good hand steadying himself
the drug the pain he thought deep in his brain my damned arm
but he was like two people watching each other shifting back and forth from one identity to another
rational irrational laughing crying
he looked at the woman
she was huddling near the rear of the cabin
blood spilled in a thin line down the side of her face from a cut above her eyes
we never get out she said
her voice was a highpitched sound with no change of tone in it never get out
why donot you dance for us
caine said blinking with the brightness of his suggestion
move caine the man said prodding back dance when i give her the gem
caine crawled slowly out of the cabin
the undercarriage had been smashed and the cabin was level with the ground
it was like going into a sea of vapor when he got out of the ship
how long he thought looking at his splintered arm
how long would the drug hang onto his brain
this was not himself
this was a weak spinning scarecrow who was drunk on dope
then the pain smashed into his awareness
it disappeared as suddenly
he was in agony then there was only the foolish whirling of his brain
he turned slowly like a limp mannequin searching the blankness of the mist
where am he said aloud
about one mile from heaven said fairchild behind him holding now a rifle from cabin rack
janet the man said to the cabin
take one of those damn rifles
mr caine is going to lead us to his happy end
the gem first he said to caine
then you let you touch it before you die
the woman came out of the cabin a rifle in her hands
she pointed it at fairchild never get out of here she repeated in her singsong tone
not without me fairchild said quietly looking at the pointed rifle
he turned his back to her
the womans face had lost its pink radiance and it was white except where the blood trickled go caine fairchild said donot know where to go caine said stupidly
up fairchild said
just lead the way up
i donot need you to know where the pie is now
you got us much closer than wed planned you know just bait now caine
bait for the cats
remember the cats wonot go through that the woman said staring at the mist around them
all right fairchild said
stay here and meet the cats alone bring the gem back to you if theres anything left of you
but by heck youre going to get it do you hear me
he faced her again going to get that gem if i have to kill seventeen cats and caine and even you
dead or alive youre going to get it do you hear
the woman was pale sicklooking and caine tried to remember how she had looked the night before
it was too much effort
move said the man prodding caine
move mr caine moved trying to find some hate to use on himself for letting the sight of the rifle in the mans hands frighten him the way it did
but there was only a dull craziness within him where the strength and nerve used to be
it was as though his steel had been melted and drained out of him by the drug like a fish he thought pushing through ihe foliage a fish with a broken fin
do cats like fish with broken fins he wondered
and the three of them were moving in a slow silent line through the venusian wilds
the sounds were in brain like a dozen records being played in a large echoing room
teewh birds pointed their yellow beaks and came screaming at his head
the kiitz birds fluttered wildly out of the thickets their frightened sound like the rake of giant fingernails across smooth slate
but there were other things in this part of the jungle
soft gelatinous phules the size of a mans hand hung to the vinetrees and when caine passed them they shifted off the trees to his skin and began their search for juices out of his own body
he swept them away one at a time and more found him have nothing left in my veins for you he said to one of them sticking to his waist
maybe warm tea
fairchild touched the rifle against his back and caine pushed the phule away
a snakelike trill wriggled in front of him its purple and black skin glistening as though it had been drawn through oil
it was about four feet long and as thick as a heavy rope
its neverclosing eyes stared at caine
hello friend caine said reaching out his good arm
the trill slid away what i really am like he decided wondering when the pain would come shattering into him again
i am like the trill
i ought to lie down on the ground and start wriggling instead of walking
the pain found him then and his brain was cleared briefly of the veil of the drug
the pain lasted longer this time
drug wearing off he thought only now i donot want it to
and then he thought of the cats the terrible cats the horrible cats
his brain spun and the veil dropped
what was i thinking about he said to himself
cats
was it the cats
why
cats are pretty especially grith cats
they are black like the spots on a leopard
and what makes me think of a leopard ask the man behind me he thought and stopped
go on caine fairchild whispered
go on damn you
leopards
leopards
caine asked himself and he pushed on through the growth feeling the ground rising more steeply
razor plants licked at his skin until his flesh was slit finely in a dozen places
the gauze around his arm became a fuzzy mass like rags
if i see a cat caine promised himself take a splint off my arm and hit him over the head with it
the mist hung around them like a hungry shroud eager to cloak everything on the planet with its muggy wetness
then the growth lessened a bit and caine saw bare rock here and there
it was easier to move and he did not jar his arm as much but somewhere in his brain an old knowledge told him that this would be certain grith territory and every step now was a step closer to the black face with the orange eyes and sharp teeth
caine felt himself growing weaker and each motion was a building effort
the heat had risen but there was no sweat on his face now only a burning dryness
his head seemed to start its floating again and he thought for a moment that it might drift irp over the trees like a balloon
the idea was very funny to him and laughter grew inside of him
he griimed feeling his stomach move with it until suddenly he was freezing his movement laughing into the mistfilled air staring straight into the orange eyes of a grith cat
the laughter stopped in his mouth
he blinked once
the cat didnot move
fairchild and the woman caine knew had halted behind him
the cats eyes shown through the mist like fiery globes pet him caine thought with great detachment right on his black head and then hell go away
the cat was motionless
caine knelt slowly looking straight into the cats eyes
it was about ten yards away
caine turned to look at fairchild
the man was on one knee the rifle pointing at the cats head
the woman waited behind him halfcrouched holding her rifle tight against her side
caine looked back to the cat moving his head slowly
he could see the great swishing tail moving back and fortli back and forth
why doesnot the man shoot
caine asked himself
why is he waiting this way
time halted
caine edged his look back to fairchild
you crazy fool he thought
you have the rifle in your hands you
and then he saw the sweat dripping from the mans face the staring eyes drained of their focus by fear
the mans body was trembling and caine thought hes going to drop the rifle out of his hands hes he woman screamed
kill him
kill him the rifle exploded in her hands and bullets whined through the air
caine felt a hot sting in his shoulder
and the cat was a roaring crazed thing that swept through the air a flash of shining blackness
the air came apart with the sound of the rifle and the screams of the woman and the roaring of the cat
caine waited as though this were a dream he was watching
the cat had leaped straight for the woman and she was tangled with the black and white claws now so tliat caine saw only a rolling screaming mass
then there was no more sound from the woman just a broken bleeding body and the cat was crouching again the black coat stippled with red the orange eyes wild
caine blinked realizing that fairchild was sprawled beside him a bullet through his head his hands just touching his unfired rifle
i canot do it caine thought looking at the rifle
too slow have those claws in me before i can even touch it
tlie cat hugged closer to the ground its muscles bunching try caine thought and his hand was moving toward the rifle slowly like a floating feather it seemed
jump he said silently to the cat
i canot do it
grith sounded a flutelike voice
the cat was motionless
gritli
the cat rose slowly and backed tail swishing
green hands slapped together and the cat turned and disappeared
caine placed his palms flat against the ground propping hunself and watched the approadiing figures
the mist seemed to be disappearing and he could see more clearly the green skin and the large unblinking eyes that looked out solemnly from beneath the hoods of the gray capes
priests
caine wondered
from the temple
i didnot know there were venusians here he said to himself and although it was a very slight disclosure as though he had suddenly learned that there were more men on venus than women he was astounded and impressed with it
well he said grinning up at them as they stopped beside him
well well
he got to his knees and still smiling looked at his arm where the gauze had come loose
he shook his head in wonderment
he narrowed his eyes and examined the blood trickling from the surface wound in his shoulder
well well he repeated and stood up
the woman was a mangled shape on the wet ground and the man lay very still
caine looked lam one to the other
yes yes he said aloud
he turned to the grayaped venusians and found the somber eyes watching him in their kindly way
one of them reached out and touched shoulder above the broken arm
others moved to the bodies of the man and woman and bent over them making floating motions with their delicate green hands
praying
caine wondered watching these motions
he shrugged
he couldnot hold a thought very long
the mist was evaporating quickly
caine looking up thought he could see a pointed outline
tnen suddenly high above there was the golden temple a shimmer of towering spires of yellow beauty splashed over by brilliant sunshine
caine turned his face up to a strange sun a blinding sun that sent its bright life down through the leaves
and caine was aware that the caped figures were kneeling all around praying in a jumble of voices their hands stretching up to the infrequent visitor of light
what are they saying caine asked smiling queerly
what is it theyre saying
screece
the sun
the most valuable gem on venus
is that what they worship in the golden temple
caine looked at the man and then at the woman
is that what they had come from earth and from mars to find
the sun he felt the laughter starting in him again as though it were someone else laughing
but his mouth widened and his teeth glistened in the sunlight and he laughed long pealing laughter
here it is he said staggering to the side of the mans body your gem
do you see it fairchild
he pointed to the sky
give it to her he said laughing through his words
no give it to her for you then that
he turned and moved slowly to the woman stumbling
here he said to the womans staring eyes
here it is you see
he looked at her face shadowed by a large leaf of a vinetree
he reached up and jerked the leaf away so that the sunlight fell full on her white face
there
take it
from charles to you through me it beautiful so big so brilliant so the laughter was getting in the way of his words and he could feel tears going down his face
pale green hands were holding him so that he wouldnot fall
and they were moving him away toward the temple
caine looked at the large kindly eyes around him feeling the hands guiding him
he couldnot stop laughing only he wished to god he could because it made the pain worse
and he couldnot take much more pain
the lips of one of the green faces moved
wress said the voice the word pronounced with difficulty
rest
caine said between spasms of laughter that he was quite certain now was crying instead
yes yes he said trying to wipe at his tears
oh yes
rest pale green hands extend again palms doum and make sweeping downward motions destroying evil
they are cupped then and raised slowly as though lifting purity to the top of the golden spires and beyond where a bright sun burns
feet step soundlessly and figures kneel circling about a fistsized orb
screece says a flutelike voice
screece says another
screece say a dozen voices
hands motion and the silver globe is no longer dull and cloudy but filled with pure shining sunlight so that it glitters like a thousand diamonds
lips move silently
a cat whimpers somewhere then sleeps

bogus angel watched protectively from the wall top as the mechanical bloodhound inched toward teucrete while she talked with the police
by on venus if one rings a doorbell or bangs on a locked gate at night it is adventure
you never know who or what will answer your summons
the door swings slowly open and you brace yourself to look
will it be maid or monster or both men gather and talk someone is sure to mention on venus
men will always be fascinated by tales of the strange and wonderful and fantastic and zoo petshop wild animal supply house is the stuff from which legends are made
one hears of the place on mars or earth on titan or rhea on callisto or ganymede even in the subsurface mines of pluto or the curious twilight outposts on mercury and some of the yarns will probably lessen if the tedium of lightyear watches when the first manned spacer pushes beyond the frontiers of the solar system
most of the stories are 21st century versions of the tall tale for both establishment and owner stagger imagination and breed fabulous accounts
a rumor that khaljean will fabricate to order any nightmarish monster from synthetic flesh and organic spare parts is obvious exaggeration
the claim that khaljean can mate any curious lifeform captured by farroving hunters is also false since he failed twice
khaljean loves animals and collects them chiefly for pleasure
he will sell some for pets and for educational exhibitions but for each one sold he keeps ten
everyone knows that he has frequently risked death rather than kill or injure a living creature
of all his zoos wonders none can compare with khaljean for man is the most fantastic of animals and khaljean is the most extraordinary of men
khaljean is both public figure and man of mystery
nobody knows his race or origin and nowadays nobody asks
with the epidemics of mutation in the of venus and the standard genetangents accepted among venusian natives such curiosity is bad form
and dangerous
so and the stories about it have grown steadily through the years
the strangest story of all concerning the zoo is one that for good reason no one tells
it happens to be true
one night in castarona by the yellow sea but the trouble did not start in there are some who say it did not finish there a usterity had finally caught up with venus
pao subcellar fungweed hell in the native quarter of old castarona was ordered to close every night at midnight venus time or else
being a venusian business man a very rugged individualist and a type mutant pao chung preferred to chance the or else
among interesting people netted in the raid were pao chung himself
bland and overcivilized he had grown rich from traffic in illegal drugs and the outlawed mechanical hypnotizers
despite pointed ears and a gnomelike expression of detached malice he appeared to be reasonably human even in his devotion to vice as a means of liveliliood
anything illegal and profitable was his vocation his hobbies ranged from innocent blackmail to murder for fun
recent extension of his operations from slave trading into political corruption had incensed even the grafting officials of castarona
they waited only an opportunity to catch him off balance
hence the raid
bat ferris spaceman wanted on an open charge warrant sworn out by solar surveys inc and wanted preferably alive and in condition to answer questions
ferris had learned long ago not to give his right name but an alias is poor disguise if ones brain wave paterns happen to be on file
and sometimes if they are not
being off reservation at all and particularly without permission and lacking his identarmband would mean real trouble
his capture in the raid was pure mischance due to entering pao only for the virtuous purpose of rescuing his partner and friend bogus angel mutant from south venus painfully well knowm to police records
the only angelic attribute he could claim was his twentyfoot wingspread
his face bore eerie resemblance to those demonic gargoyles carved on medieval cathedrals
fine fur in stripes of ochre burnt orange and smudged brown covered the visible parts of his anthropoid anatomy making him resemble a tiger left in the rain long enough for the dyes to run
angel liked peace and quiet and resorted to gambling theft arson aggravated assault and occasional assassination to obtain it
in the icj morass of his soul the few cracks vented sinister and malicious humor
his greatest virtue was warped and violent loyalty to ferris which was not necessarily a virtue from the official point of view appetite for and capacity for misuse of drugs alcohol and mechanical hypnotizers was miraculous but when loaded he was dangerous
of nine others scooped in the raid only one fact need be mentioned
they are still in jail which indicates lack of initiative or good sense
jailbreak on venus is a sporting proposition and inevitably weeds the sheep from the goats
pao chung and bogus angel were definitely goats and ferris may be considered a dark gray sheep
for various reasons it was essential to all three to escape and quickly
they stood together in the jailyard
ferris and angel had relapsed into silence as pao chung approached
when are you planning escape
pao chung asked with a directness not expected of him
angel chuckled but ferris stared suspiciously
how are you so sure we intend to escape he parried
pao chung shrugged simple question easily answered
while your friend was in my shop i manipulated the hypnotic machines
he talked chiefly about himself but also about you
enough to give me a clue to your real identity though probably he does not guess it himself
i know that you dare not stay
eventually they will check your brain wave patterns and learn too much
which is the greater risk
what business is that of yours
none directly pao chung admitted
but i enjoy fishing in troubled waters
other peoples business can often be turned to my profit
in this case since we are being frank i wish to leave with you when you go
take me along or i talk before you can make the attempt
mayhem shone in eyes but ferris put a restraining hand on the furry arm men donot talk urged angel hopefully his nonhuman tongue licking feral lips
wait ordered ferris
if you kill him now we will have no chance to escape
it would draw too much attention to us
besides being foolish said pao chung smoothly
both of you are strangers in castarona
where would you go
who would hide you
how long would you last
talk fast ferris advised gently
if you know so much you know we have little to lose
only your lives perhaps
more if my deductions are correct
listen to me
like you i am in greater peril here
my offense is a minor one
by now i should have been fined and let go with a warning
i suspect the authorities of more sinister intentions
it will be easy to find a pretext if they wish to be rid of me
i must escape
alone none of us would stand a chance
together who knows ferris consulted his partner with a glance angel nodded but imposed a question
and afterwards what of your deductions will forget them promised pao chung
see that you do said ferris
or we will
pao chung ignored the prophecy amiably know a possible refuge once we have managed the escape
a man in the city owes me favors
as refuge of course it will be temporary
they will have mechanical trackers after us eventually but not at first
electronic bloodhounds would spoil their sport make killing us too easy
but the nature of our sanctuary will give them pause for a time
complex interesting and dangerous it is the one place in castarona no one will think to look
and there is enough space to hide in for quite a while
such a place sounds interesting ferris agreed
but i suppose you know every unsavory rats nest in castarona
not a rats nest said pao chung smiling
much better
have you heard of who hasnot
that should muddle the pursuit for a day or two
but can you count on khaljean
pao chung snorted
blackmail is my professional secret so donot ask details will grant us refuge
not willingly perhaps but i have enough on him to guarantee his conduct
how about a plan for getting out of jail
ferris laughed harshly paid your passage
now well pay ours
hiding out with the rest of the wild animals seems very appropriate
listen carefully pao chung and angel bent an ear nodding approval
jailbreak looks temptingly easy
hazards of escape are mostly mental so far as barriers of barred doors and windows locked gates or walls of stone metal or plastic are concerned
inner and outer doors are frequently open
prisoners move about at will within defined limits
even there no physical hindrance is put in the escapees way
he may pause at the door and indulge in sical repartee with guards or warden
he may delay his exit long enough to exchange fond farewells with friends and fellow inmates and he had better
once outside the fun begins
it is open season on fugitive prisoners and the first guard lucky enough to fatally blast an escapee receives two weeks with pay and a cash bonus for every hour short of the deadline required for killing or recapturing a runaway
any prisoner who makes good his escape and lasts a full three days is written off die books
either way he is written off since the guards make no pretense of trying to recapture him alive and the hunt is geared to surprising efficiency
it should be a spirited gamble but few men ever make the attempt and fewer still succeed so tlie sport may be said to languish
history records only five men who made the finish line though hundreds used to try for it
building walls opposite the gateway bear leprous scars from blaster discharges which brought several daring attempts to pyrotechnical conclusions
angel sauntered up to a guard on duty at the main gate
he looked across the busy street at the flaking walls and evidences of extreme heat
a bored guard glanced casually at the brawny venusian taking curious note of his folded wings
going out asked the guard with cynical humor get those wings singed sonny
angel smiled and a dream of violence lived briefly in his gemfaceted eyes might he mused softly
what handicap will you give me
close my eyes and count to five offered the guard grinning viciously
start counting suggested angel he guards eyes and mouth opened wide his grin changed to a glare alert and suspicious
at that moment alarms blared in the cellblock and jailyard
angel appeared to stumble thrusting himself heavily against the guard
already offbalance trying to look in two directions at once the man lurched halfway through the gate
automatic selenium cell alarms caught the movement and added their wild clamors to the jangling babel from the building
volumes of dense black smoke poured from doors and windows of the cellblocks lower floors
from above came shrill screams from the trapped inmates on upper floors
fire yelled angel
then he was running not through the gate but towards the building
guards and prisoners milled in ultimate confusions
jailyard was a melee but angel forced a passage
at tlie cellblock doorway he paused long enough to make sure that guards were rushing a long ladder of lightmetal alloy to the wall
inside he plunged through churning confusions of smoke sound and invisible solids
in a city as imflammably built as castarona fire inevitably creates panic
equipment must be always at hand
automatic sprinklers were already deluging the threatened interior with water and chemicals
angel waded kneedeep in chemical foam to the stairway and ascended against the pressure of a descending waterfall
voices and metallic alarms mingled in shrill discords
groping blindly and colliding with hysterical prisoners angel fought up tlie spiraling cascades of the stairway like a trout seeking the spawning grounds
at the fourth floor he got to a window and smashed the glass then set up a bedlam of howls and shrieks
from below the lightalloy ladder angled up toward him
its hooks engaged the window ledge
with a yelp of maniacal joy he snatched it from the hands of the steadiers on the ground and gave a series of quick jerks to dislodge the mounting guards and firefighters
with easy stren he lifted it clear of the ground and rung by rung hoisted it upward
bat ferris and pao chung grasped it from the roof parapet and held on while he raced upstairs again and helped them drag it to the roof
the nearest building was just about a ladderlength away
by prodigies they raised it to the vertical then let it slant in the direction indicated
it toppled and swung in a wild arc
there was a bad moment when all three realized that it did not quite reach
acting instantaneously angel lifted the pivot end hooked his knees to the parapet and extended the ladder by his own length
the far end struck hard bounced high nearly tearing angel from his precarious hold
over he commanded while the vibrations still jarred painfully through his body
without argument one at a time ferris and pao chung walked gingerly across the perilous swaying bridge
kneeling ferris made sure the ladder hooks were secure on the other parapet
he cried out
angel relaxed his kneeholds beating his wings furiously and climbing like a bird on a breaking treelimb
the ladder swung in giants pendulum
angel moved with lightning speed and miraculous precision maintaining balance with threshing pinions while his lithe legs and powerful arms carried him upward
he was mounting the upper rungs when the ladder crashed savagely against the building side writhing vibrating tearing its hooks free and sending broken masonry crashing into the dizzy depths below
angel leaped clear caught the parapet and dragged himself up
guards boiled onto the jailhouse roof and laced blaster beams across the chasm between buildings
crouched low the fugitives ran taking advantage of every cover
explosions followed them and they raced through pelting storms of molten stone and metal
over the roofs ferris shouted follow soon enough
probably the near streets are already blocked off and well need all the time we can snatch
they halted for breath in the shelter of a vast dome
pao chung glanced admiringly at his enforced allies he commented
even to the timing of the faked fires
too bad such talent as ours must be wasted on an audience as unappreciative as the police
however youve kept your bargain out and still alive
with a few minutes start and the rooftops of the city to play hide and seek in
now if we can reach petshop reach it ferris promised grimly
a round them was the fantastic skyline
from below in the teeming streets came a rising buzz like the droning activity of a hive of angry bees
above rose the citywide dome of fused quartz its crystalline concavity faintly iridescent as it reflected the questioning beams of giant searchlights
planet stories july north between the fugitives and the older native quarters of castarona were the gigantic systems of airlocks and below that the sprawling tangles of dockland
ferris led his companions in a tortuous route that covered miles of angled and uneven rooftops
realizing that his identcards must have come through he knew that police and security officials must be turning the city inside out in a wild scramble to locate and deal with him
speed was essential and more than his personal safety depended upon the outcome of the wild chase over the jagged skylines
knots of wary policemen and determined security soldiers invaded the rooftops and began searching the hundreds of square miles
in case the escaped prisoners had descended from the high levels even business blocks were being turned out
the whole city was undergoing systematic scouring
officialdom was desperate and badly frightened
mechanical trackers had already been sent for
never before had they been used so early in tlie game
the man or whatever he was
bat ferris must be found at once slain if possible
the hunt was on full cry
after two near brushes with patrols ferris finally decided that it would be safer to descend to the streets
dragnets spread over the world above the city and only luck had kept the trio from being sighted a dozen times
they were near the edge of the city where the half bubble of the dome comes down into a series of cones which are the great airlocks protecting the cityatmosphere from the troubled violence and noxious fumes of outer venus
like shadows the fugitives descended going down darkened spirals of stairways stealing elevators moving furtively among dark twisting alleyways crawling under vast landing stages and skirting heaps of exotic venusian produce ready for shipping to the nine inhabited worlds
in the cluttered dockland areas they collided blindly with an armed patrol
angel acting on pure instinct leaped high then swooped down like a striking hawk
tlie rustle of his opened wings was like the flapping of windwhipped flames
his outstretched arms gathered two of the four man patrol and crushed life from them before they sensed danger
ferris was al26 most as quick
he leaped and strangled and a man died in swift deadly silence
pao chung unused to managing his own violence was clumsier
a blaster went off
then angel over the difficulty
the soldier broke and ran screaming firing his blaster twice more without aiming
the uproar would bring help
but the soldier was beyond help
angel soared and dived
there was no fight
now armed the fugitives fled swiftly
pao chung took over the lead
by devious streets and crooked alleys they went in the extremes of haste
further caution was useless
now that the alarm had been given speed was the only hone
pao chun knew every secret ratrun in the old native quarter
he used most of them
if the passage of the fugitives caused a ripple of excitement among the polyglot denizens of that forbidding area they did not know it nor heed it
all three knew the natives well enough to be certain that the police could expect no favors from that source
all venusians are natural anarch born outlaws and rebels against authority
the trail would die on stubborn tongues unless mechanical trackers were used
even then unless the police and security squads came in massed force there would be incidents to delay pursuit
natives and the human debris of nine worlds which had found refuge in the quarter had no reason to love autliority
in one sense the area was an armed camp within the walls
uneasy truce at best existed between these motley dwellers and the intruding minions of the nominal officialdom
while the hunted could expect no actual help from the guerilla forces of underworld there was the certainty of hindrance to the hunters
patrols and searching squads converged on the freightdock stages drawn by radioed reports of a clash
from there a trail of sorts led straight into the native quarter
as the soldiers and police massed on the fringes of the area sparks of trouble began to develop were quickly fanned to flame and quenched only by continuous violence and the arrival of overwhelming forces
pao chun led his companions into a dark zigzagging alley
not far now he gasped hoarsely struggling for breath
from close behind came a rising uproar he alley ended abruptly against a high blank curving wall of reinforced concrete
pao raw burning throat refused speech but he gestured over the wall
there was no gate
angel sprang lightly to the top and gave his partners in crime a hand up
they dropped into darkness on the far side
light writhed and flickered curiously on the great dome overhead
tumult died away behind them as they fled across a wide open space then rose to shocking crescendoes
reflections flared in the dome
uproar dwindled to uneasy silence as if the massed forces of law and order had found the native quarter stickier going than expected and had been forced to retire in disorder
pao chung stopped as if checking directions then led off at a sharp tangent
the way went through fields
diflhised light from the tall citybuildings filtered in here and gave some sense of the ground surface which was fortunate
numerous small fences of wire hummed and sputtered on insulatorposts
electrified guardfences
pao chung hurdled them carefully but they were low enough to trip and incinerate an incautious trespasser unaware of their existence and unused to their spacing
oppressive silence brooded over the place
atmosphere was thick with pungent and exotic odors that lingered with unpleasantly alien tang in the nostrils
ahead loomed a high stockade of chromesteel pilings pierced by a single monstrous gate
pao chung ran up and hammered on the gate
its reserberations roused thunderous echoes in the night
a curious echo persisted and increased in volume
on venus if one climbs a fence rings a doorbell or bangs on a locked gate at night it is adventure
you never know who or what will answer your summons
the door swings slowly open and you brace yourself to look
will it be maid or monster or both
this was the gate swung open a scant double handspan checked by a short length of sturdy chain
a head poked through the aperture
an interesting head even in the difficult light
details were obscure but there was a flash of curdwhite skin finemodeling of feature a delicate oval face framed in a swinging bell of dark hair
in this case tire summons was answered by presumably a maid daughter teucrete herself something of a legend
a woman can be described in terms of anatomical rhapsody
or one may dwell endlessly upon sweetness of disposition upon quaint and unique charms of personality
a potential lover may fashion poetic conceits upon the lilting moonbeam qualities in her voice compare her skin to flowerpetals her eyes to gemfires liken the graceful movements of limbs and body to the liquid symphonies of swirling water
or these matters may be left wholly to the imagination and the girl described obliquely by reference to her effect upon the male population in her immediate vicinity
the effect was jarring enough
go away she said inhospitably
she leaned furtlier through the opening to snarl fluent imprecations in venusian billingsgate at the nocturnal callers
pao chung braved the storm
shut up he said evenly eyes fixed on him savagely and she took a sharp breath with the obvious intention of renewing her tirade
then she thought better of it and restrained her outrage long enough to throw a taunt in his face
is pao chung so desperate for money that he comes now in the middle of the night two days early for your payment
come back then
call your father ordered the venusian
khaljean is not here hunting
come back after noon tomorrow if you must see him
the head withdrew inside
the gate crashed shut
bolts grated
shall i fly over the stockade and throttle her asked angel rippling his wings
pao chung hammered the gate again
as before the racketing animal chorus repeated the sound witli variations
pao chung kept pounding until the gate was opened again
this time the head did not appear but a wiry female voice addressed them from the inside darkness
still here
the police must be hunting you
they are
good
i will point you out and stay to watch the kill
pao qiung chuckled evilly
do that
the records of background and illegal activities is in my safe
my will provides for publication of all such papers upon my death
the voice hesitated
it might be worth humiliation or disgrace to be rid of you permanently
it might agreed pao chung
many people have thought so
i wonder if khaljean will be one of them
with a scrape of bare metal bolts retreated into soets and the chain was removed
crack widened enough to permit entrance
come in then teucrete said wearily will let my father decide when he returns
for tonight you can stay
but i wonot answer for your safety
the animals are roused and nervous
i am not sure i can control theni with strangers here cacophonies greeted the entrance of the fugitives
an atmosphere of alien and indescribable uneasiness pervaded the vast compound with its rows and piled banks of cages
the atmosphere was the emotion of nighthauntings and the sound was its voice
no sign above the gate proclaimed
here dwells nightmae nor
through these portals pass the most incredible lifeforms in the known universe
there was no circus atmosphere
just a nameless blending of sounds and smells and alien vibrations that stirred the imagination like evil flames licking at forgotten folk memories
on venus the term unearthly has naturally lost meaning but here was a hint of dreadful abysses beyond even the exotic fecundity of the cloudveiled planet
here were halfaudible chords beyond all the known octaves
here in the troubled darkness one sensed symbols of instincts minds and feelings that man was never meant to know or understand
here was the final question mark of tion whence and to what dreadful purpose
what incredible virtuosity of the unknown creator had brought these unthinkable beings into multiform existence
and why
what purpose did they serve in the plan of creation
or was there any purpose
was there even a plan
bat ferris remembered such thoughts from his lonely monastic youth on mars and during the schooling period on earth
one had time for long unhappy thoughts in such a segregated childhood and some of them still reverberated deep inside him
the girl drew back to let them enter flashing the beam of a hand radilume on each in turn
her glance flicked each of them in examination sharp enough to draw blood
she received them in silence for mind was not on the duties of a hostess to unexpected guests
wait here she ordered crisply
then she went among the tangled avenues between cages and spoke soothingly to the caged brutes
her voice crackled purred coughed roared hissed
the bird people were the first to heed
their bright nervous chittering subsided into occasional geysers of chirping
surly sand leopards from mars paced their cages and vented sounds like needles caught in the grooves of antique disc recordings
partially gaseous life forms from saturn had no vocal apparatus but showed their uneasy displeasures by flaring into sullen crimsons and bruised purples of luminosity
ferris followed the girl closely on her rounds his eyes staring in wonder at the caged monsters revealed when her light bathed the barred cubicles
some cages were not cages in the ordinary sense at all
behind barriers of streaming light crouched protoplasmic entities of no set form
moondogs sported aimlessly in pools of ionized gas
wireflies battered themselves against invisible net barriers
complex mysteries of plutonian lifeforms floated in magnetic fields
metallic crystals built themselves into corallike colonies resembling miniature castles
less outre creatures inhabited the myriads of cellblocks the ordinary and extraordinary varieties of apes and cats and dogs the bovines and marsupials the squeaking rats and trumpeting elephants the endless species of seacreatures the treehaunters and the desert dwellers the burrowers and the flyers
there were supposedly extinct saurians and examples of tomorrows freaks and mutants
there were brute clowns and tragedians
there were but has been described often enough in magazine articles sometimes with tridimensional pictures in color
any reader so inclined may look into the back files of interplanetary magazine and stupefy himself with the famous issue of july teucrete sensed that she was followed but with pointed insolence ignored ferris and continued her rounds
gradually her eerie tones brought calm to the multiform excitements of the compound
she returned eventually to pao chung and angel will take you back through the laboratories to the inner maze she said irritably move quietly and do not stumble in the dark
some of the protection barriers are fragile and a few exist only in the minds of the creatures in them
if excited too much they can break through
many are mankillers
one mankiller runs loose in here observed angel drily
teucrete disposed of the intended compliment with a sneer
pao chung has long had such ideas
through pressure on my father he has tried to to buy or barter for me
such disposal is mine to make not my fathers
i have my price but it is high
it is evidence of more obvious charms that three masculine minds went into gear calculating resources
teucrete laughed viciously
the first item is pao head on a platinum platter platinum platter is not unobtainable said angel speculatively
pao chung was not offended
he chuckled unpleasantly
such fire as yours would bring a high price in the slave marts of yabn he said
my head would bring more locally
should we not move further from the gates
a scanner could pierce several layers of metal as thin as this stockade
perhaps i can bring your price down or my offer up
but another occasion for bargaining would suit both of us better
if tliere are other occasions for any of us ferris put in bitterly
from outside came tire sounds of many movements the rustle and clatter of questing men hoarse shouts and a confusion of crowd sounds
above all like a thin thread of sound binding the other noises together was a high earpiercing nervewracking drone
angel flittered to the top of tire stockade and peered warily through the razoredged metal pilings
he swooped down to his companions with whispered verification of their suspicions
the mechanical trackers he said
perhaps there is still a deal open muttered pao chung
he bowed with sardonic malice toward teucrete
we have one possession of greater value than my head or your body
my young friend here teucrete snorted contemptuously
him
but her glance lingered on ferris momentarily
what do you mean
ferris is a gammaman said pao chung
even angel gasped with shock eyes widened in incredulity horror and fear
ill is a subtle poison
it began long ago in a small new mexico town long before there were gammamen or even interplanetary travel
the fear radiated from mushrooming clouds with impossible radiance at the core and the fear did more harm to the minds of men than the deadly spectra of invisible death did to their bodies
it began with scientists in cages in the name of national securities it developed into continual surveillance for all men engaged in atomics
these workers and their families led cloistered monastic lives
they intermarried since there was little contact with outsiders and they shared generations of haunted spyridden lives
they lived in the midst of fear and mistrust while the earth went through its chronic spirals of war and the preparations
throughout history scholars and philosophers have warned that knowledge must be free and universal like sunlight
but there have always been wars and secrets and guarded weapons and fear is older than man
scientists were men of dangerous knowledge of destructive potentials
as such they were hostages of fear and illusions of safety
they were segregated guarded wellfed and at first provided with all the deadly toys necessary to their amusements
it was all painfully logical and futile but all the best brains of mankind were locked up to putrefy for lack of fresh air and the stimuli of mutual thoughts
their knowledges and prerogatives became hereditary
natural law works against segregation
artificial isolation of any group leads to misunderstandings prejudices resentments mutual fears and eventually to violence is a serpent devouring its own tail
in time the oncehonored and glorified gammamen became feared and hated
in the minds of the ignorant and superstitious populace they were associated with medieval wizards and workers of dreadful miracles
the threat of gamma groups became a political pawn and was used as a club to beat down restless unhappy populations
with their knowledge and the popular delusion of their almost supernatural powers it was easy enough for ambitious men to misuse the scientists
in some cases the gammamen themselves usurped authority but this noble experiment slipped through their fingers and they lost control from sheer unworldliness
in trutli from the working of natural law the juice had run out of diem and they no longer understood the basics of normal human relations
in a final paroxysm of public panic they were disarmed their toys taken away and every last gammaman imprisoned in carefully guarded and isolated colonies
like the ancient indians they were placed in reservations and kept there by force
after this culminating outrage the gammamen lost heart for practical activity
locked into their libraries they turned to abstractions and dabbled in deadend philosophies most of them were querulous oldsters hidebound by tradition their sciences now become a ritual religion their books exalted ts the word and their fading knowledge still held secret for reasons long forgotten
not quite all gammamen accepted this halflife allotted to them
there were sports avatars occasional throwbacks who rebelled and went off reservation
none of these actually ran amuck but so great was the fearconditioning on one side and so difficult the adaptation to ordinary living on the other that there were painful accidents and incidents
nothing genuinely monstrous occurred but enough friction developed to keep alive and add to the public dreil of gammamen
the term became a byword for nursery terror
and in their turn the infant generations of gammamen learned to pity and despise the ignorant and corrupt multitudes of normal humanity
they lost contact with their human heritage
in recent years few gammamen had broken out to mingle with the expanding races now peopling and colonizing the frontiers of the solar system
those few were hunted down like outlaws and killed with brutal ingenuity
but a new generation had come among gammamen with an urge so passionate and devout they themselves did not understand it
either some latent folkmemory or some emotional mutation urged them to go forth and civilize mankind
in the old books they tracked down knowledge and made grandiose plans for engineering the renaissance
realizing their common origin and longing for more nearly normal lives they grouped together and made a pact to see some changes made
studying history and the other technologies of man they soon discovered that social economic and psychological sciences had lagged far behind the other developments
these were the blind spots of mankind and these led to all the other serious and tragic misdirections of effort
always the sons of adam had struggled to achieve workable systems and always these systems had broken down or failed at critical moments
if some means could be found eventually the means was tracked down from a clue in one of the oldest books
it was not found but its existence deduced and proved to the satisfaction of the searchers
somewhere hidden in a forgotten corner of the solar system was the missing tool
this fact settled it became necessary to locate and use the missing tool
it was a pitifully small generation
only seven brighteyed and highhearted young men
but that night they broke out of their prescribed boundaries
they went off reservation and separated in seven directions
each had a theory and a hope to be explored
without their identarmbands of platinum with the old greek letter deeply incised they resembled any other seven youths picked at random from the teeming multitudes
they could mingle unquestioned and their studies had prepared them for various tasks to whicli their forged papers entitled them
but adaptation was not easy
a single incautious moment could betray them
even a routine brainwave check would be sufficient to identify the fugitives for in subtle ways the gammamen were different
seven young men with a noble purpose and fanatical hopes in their hearts
and now there were two
five of them had made fatal slips and had been hunted down to hideous deaths
ferris was one of the two survivors our people stood paralyzed while the hammering resounded at the gate
this was no human fist demanding attention but an odd robotlike clanking as if a mechanical beast nosed in determined rooting against the metal leaves of the gate
it was just such a beast
a burring whine rose into notes of shrill frustration
metallic and electronic frustration for the tracker was a bloodhound of vacuum tubes and relays and switches and batteries and transformers
unerring and inexorable its robot senses sorted a single frequency from all other brain wave patterns and it clung to the trail with chilling efficiency
something about its unhuman lusting numbed most quarry before the pursuers in charge of the monster could check its demonic eagerness for prey
now like a metallic carnivore scenting blood the robot tracker nuzzled the gate and rebounded to nuzzle gain
all four of the humans inside the compound imagined the scene outside
pencil beams of hand radilumes glinted here and there the questing soldiers and police squads the glittering serpentine body of the tracker with its scurrying treads churning clouds of dust as it whined and rooted at the gate
bat ferris shot a glance of uneasy calculation at his three companions
the girl was an unknown quantity
angel momentarily shocked was predictable enough within limits
pao chung was openly an opportunist willing to turn any situation to personal profit
unarmed ferris could not even deal with them let alone with the police outside
he frowned angrily stare held on him for a moment as if puzzled
her eyes moved on focusing on angel then pao chung
presently they came back to ferris amused and faintly mocking
what is a gammaman doing here she asked
an interesting question said pao chung ironically
but not of prime importance at the moment
ferris watched a smile writhe on the girls lips and felt a quick relief
she might help if only to thwart pao idea of throwing him to the human wolves outside
a harsh voice clamored for admittance
the animals were growing restive again
an earthy bellow boomed out against a counterpoint of birdlike trills
the sand leopards coughed guttural warnings
somewhere a pygmy elephant trumpeted and the giant insects burst into deafening clatters
teucrete motioned for silence then drew the bolts and held the gate ajar on its short chain there she demanded roughly
police several voices explained
open the gate or well break it down
have you a warrant a security matter someone explained hopefully
tell that to the animals she stormed as much as your lifes worth to come in here tonight upset already and i canot control them if you keep up this noise
go away
an authoritative voice blustered
this is an important matter
let me talk to your father
teucrete shrugged
he will be back by noon tomorrow
come then and bring a warrant to search
or she followed die speech with some insulting suggestions not in the best of tascc
the authoritative voice turned into a gargle addressing a slammed gate
profanity did not disturb the tracker which continued to root noisily at the metal
teucrete shoved bolts into sockets and stood back
she sighed and beckoned the three men to follow her
they moved amid a nightmarish cacophony of sounds
in memory roused by the various elements of the uproar
bat ferris revisited the far planets
fortunately the light was too dim to see all the sources of sound but ferris mentally identified many of the caged dwellers by ear or by nose
wrigglers from the mercury mines of callisto
venusian swamp slugs and grullcats from the tihar forest from the honeycombed caverns of triton
wireflies and needleflies known by their eerie humming and buzzing batnoses from the twilight zone of mercury
iceworms from neptune and pluto and the deadly windharps from mars
amiably imbecilic moondogs from the satellites of saturn pressed blank flat faces against the walls of their insulated glass tanks
monsters out of nightmare
a madmans miscellany
there was more an incredible infinity of animal horizons
but imagination reels back and description falters
wliat words can catalog the fringes of morphology erris focussed his interest on the girl
teucrete
a strange name and as strange a being as these she lived among
he wondered idly about her racial background
her fathers origin was a mystery and who could say what mate he had found on fecund venus
was his daughter one of those halfhuman mutants or was she just what she seemed a wilful and badly raised human girl
ferris could only guess and await further evidence of her intentions toward him
but he liked the way she walked
tall straight slender 4s a spear and as poised
pride was in her and a hint of warped character in her frigid disdain of weakness or fear
physically but ferris was no authority on feminine beauty
on the reservation women had been scarce most of them neurotic virgins or old
he had known women since but mostly the hard cynical opportunists of the planetary frontier boomtowns
none to share a life with
vast perspectives of cages and tanks and pressure vats went off in all directions
he would not have imagined so much area covered by the establishment
it seemed limitless and all its dimensions were oddly confusing
intentionally so since it was laid out in kbyrinthine fashion
unguided a stranger could lose himself in a matter of minutes
it defied belief that a of such colossal proportions could exist within the precincts of a city even such a sprawling megalopolis as castarona
but at last they were through tlie cage areas which lined the periphery of the compound and teucrete led the men into a building of dazzling white stone
my fathers kboratory she explained
here we synthesize foods for the animals and try with all our ingenuity to provide an approximate environment for them
her voice brought ferris back to the present
it wonot work he said
security squads will never wait for a warrant
even if they do what good is half an hour break down your gate and swarm through here like hunting bees
teucrete laughed scornfully
afraid gammaman
if i were i wouldnot be here
but only a fool refuses to recognize danger
relax she advised
they will break in true
but there may be a little difficulty finding their way among the cages
it is a maze as you saw
and the animals will give them some trouble
i am not forgetting the tracker but the moondogs and wireflies can confuse anything that operates on electronics
all we need is a slight delaying action
we can count on that
there is another exit asked pao chung eagerly
her laugh crystallized in tinkling fragments like showering shards of glass
another exit yes
the way my father goes when he hunts
if you have the nerve to take it
but compose yourself pao chung
you will need supplies of food water air special clothing
and there is a price
hesitantly unhappily pao chung inquired the price
the way is dangerous she said rapidly
you might not come back
and i must see that my father is protected
give me an order on your bank or lawyer for all the evidence you have against him for whatever crimes or stupidities he may have committed
how do you know such an order will be honored
pao chung muttered speculatively
once i am free the girl tossed her head till the bell of ebony hair swung dangerously
it had better be honored she warned crisply
for there is only one way back if you ever come back
and i can control it
i donot think you will like your surroundings well enough to remain there indefinitely
pao chung bowed to the inevitable
angel chuckled moodily and bat ferris faced teucrete with admiration on his pleasantly ugly features
well done he praised
is there a price for me
no price to a man who likes animals
i sensed that in you as we passed the cages
impulsively the girl leaned toward ferris and forced her lips violently on his
that is for luck gammaman
on the house but the next one might cost you dearly
watch yourself
ferris clung to the sanctuary of masculine silence
pao chung glowered sullenly and amusement sent iridiscent ripples glinting from his wings
how about me he demanded
no kiss no price she told him but a word of advice mutant
keep those wings out of revolving doors
angel grinned happily his gargoyle face wrinkling into impossible contortions
they are a nuisance
newly garbed and equipped the men followed teucrete from the building
stopping to stuff pao order into a some feminine idea of a safetyvault not too safe in the company of lecherous males teucrete conducted her charges through a lovely formal garden that functioned by concealed hydroponics and on into another built up area
but this was no cubicle of stone or steel or plastic
it was a roofless structure of glass
vertical panels of glass ran off beyond sight
panels of all colors all degrees of transparency
some were as lucid as crystal some barely translucent and more bent or mirrored to distort reflect or refract light
all were tinted some weakly others violently stained
the place was stridently illuminated by concealed radifloods
it was a solid mass of rainbow effects a forest of crystal mirrors and shafts and flickering glowing prisms
one entered by a kind of airlock or more accurately a lightlock
there was no change in atmospheric pressure but the density and beating force of sheer luminosity increased by squares and cubes as the travellers strode through linked cubes of glass
they entered the light maze
dazzling splendors beat upon them
vision was overwhelmed by visible vibrations
they drowned in light touch anything warned exact alignment is important
she stopped before a keyboard like the console of a gigantic organ
behind it rose massed ranks of vacuum tubes all glowing humming flickering
the girls fingers skipped nimbly on the keys and notes of sound rose in tinkling chiming sprays from the shafts
colors stormed and raged in the crystalline forest running up and down the visible octaves of light
one sensed other scales beyond in both upper and lower wavelengths
glass panels and crystal shafts vibrated to sound and light like tuning forks
they stirred quivered vanished then reappeared
a tall man appeared among the shafts and strode toward the travellers
khaljean said pao chung nervously
it was sufficient introduction
there was uncanny resemblance between father and daughter like two matched paintings in different keys
the animal man listened quietly while teucrete explained the situation
he looked at pao chung and laughed
he shrugged bargain is a bargain said khaljean
perhaps i should go back to venus and fabricate some gnawed bones to convince the police searching parties that the animals devoured you
all of you had better remain here and wait till i send for you
you are good at faked evidence pao chung jibed bitterly
in a good cause yes agreed khaljean goodnaturedly
even in a bad cause this time
stay here
you will be safer
wait ordered ferris
klialjean measured him mockingly
who are you to say am a gammaman ferris told him
that doesnot frighten me youngster
so am or was
do you know the name djevos barian
ferris blinked
but barian was hunted down and killed his remains positively identified
khaljean smiled
as pao chung said i am good at faked evidence
i always had a skill with synthetics
a man thing i created lived long enough to be slaughtered in my place and i had constructed him well even to duplicating my fingerprints and brain patterns
officially i am dead
but ten years ago pao chung found out about me
he has bled me systematically ever since
until now
shall i kill him for you asked angel with malicious joy in the thought
now that you have access to his evidence his life can be only a menace to you
khaljean frowned donot believe in killing
but sometimes pao chung has tempted me
no let him live
so you are barian said ferris admiringly
was barian
i have become khaljean
the real one was a smalltime operator dealing chiefly in dead animals
i was with him when he died
we were much alike in appearance
with plastic surgery i became khaljean
and i have made the name famous
you must be one of the seven recent escapees from the reservation
we will have much to talk about later
not later insisted ferris
now
where does this maze lead
khaljean humored him
nowhere or anywhere a dimensional short cut that can take you to any place in the solar universe or even a few odd places in adjacent or parallel spacetime continuums
is there somewhere you want to go
ferris nodded soberly place i must go
now if possible
why
khaljean studied the younger man grimly not sure you could understand since you left the gamma reservation so long ago try to explain
somewhere there is a tool
not tliat exactly nor a machine either but we call it that for lack of a term
in the old books of our library there was mention of it
a description with a hint of properties
it is something alien a control placed on the destinies of groupman
his voice droned on speaking as if the subject were a lesson he had learned by rote
many times mans social and political organization has painfully climbed the ladder toward a workable civilized system but always it has slipped and fallen back
the individual mind functions well for the most part but not so the groupmind
any crowd less honest less cient and far less intelligent than its individual units
the larger the crowd the greater the tangent the possibilities for evil and injustice
in attempts to solve the problems of group relationships man is worse than pitiful
long study has convinced the gammapeople that this is not a mere accident
outside influence warps mens thinking in groups warps social and political organization
it seems as if groupman struggled hopefully to put together a complex jigsaw puzzle in which many parts will fit badly into an infinity of possible relationships
the true fit is difficult to find but even the law of averages should help in so many attempts
time and time again just as the puzzle is nearly completed someone joggles the puzzlers elbow and the pattern is destroyed
there is such a joggler such an outside influence
its existence was proved its influence even measured
there are clues scattered through the old books
we know what it is what it looks like how it operates but we have been powerless to counteract its influence
the warping hypnotic broadcasts keep throwing mankind back to chaos when utopia is in sight
it is too strong to combat and the source must be destroyed
by our solemn pact my six friends and i bound ourselves to locate and smash this alien mechanism licked his lips reflectively
you interest me he admitted was once young enough to be idealistic myself
what is this alien monster you describe
not a monster in the ordinary sense
not a tool nor quite even a machine
living jewels perhaps
at least radioactive false gems
gas probably radon solidified under the incredible pressures in the heart of jupiter
solar knows about them for they were seen once and even handled by men
there is an article about them in the encyclopaedia of the solar planets
in they were discovered mined by cybernetic machinery
then on their way to mars the ship carrying the jewels was sabotaged and wrecked
wreckage and frozen bodies were discovered on the rogue asteroid hidalgo but the jewels were missing
pao chung had shown growing interest in the conversation
he broke in to ask stolen
stolen perhaps
possibly they disintegrated at the time of the wreck or they may have transmuted into something unrecognized by the searchers
they may have become tenuous enough to sink through the surface of hidalgo and recrystallized inside
but the evil influence continues
we believe that they are still there still in existence working their hidden evil warping the brains of men producing social and political chaos
five of my friends have lost their lives searching for this menace
possibly the sixth is dead too since he vanished into the unknown and has not been heard from tried myself
angel and i landed on hidalgo and searched carefully
but hidalgo is off limits for spacemen
solar surveys sent the space patrol after us and we fled before finishing our search
we were chased to mars traced and hunted to venus
we crashed there and while i tried to get money for new equipment angel got involved with pao chung
you know the rest
now you see why i must go to hidalgo
khaljean shook his head in sorrow understand
but you could never find your way through the maze
ferris accused him with fanatical eyes
you could help me to find my way
not i am too old and i am not sure that i approve of your meddling
not that i would try to stop you but donot count on help from me
how do you know that this alien machine is what you say
its purpose may be good not evil
some higher intelligence may have placed it in our system as a and bank on health and wealth stop the expensive smoking habit without any further delay
consider how much goes up in smoke each week think of the countless things that extra money will buy breaks the smoking habit breaks it safely quickly and permanently is an imitation cigarette that needs no light

it may be a warning road sign to keep us from crashing into a dead end
our utopias sound very dull to me they may easily be a dead end for mankind
i like the interesting and amusing variations of chaos so let me cling to them
follow your destiny if you will
i wonot stop you
ferris looked pitifully young but he stood his ground with absurd pride and courage
right or wrong i must try he said evenly
and i wonot grant the right of alien interference
man too has a right to work out his destiny good or bad
angel spoke up eagerly for his partner wonot say i know what youre talking about and maybe too stupid and ignorant to understand
but as a victim of chaos i donot appreciate it
pao chung sneered
one vote for law and order from the fallen angel if it can be believed
like khaljean my preference is for chaos as it furnishes more opportunities for a man of my interests
however my soul revolts at this talk of destroying gems of presumably unique properties
they must have value
perhaps you can dismantle this machine without harming its parts
as a business man with time on my hands i would like to go with you and see if something can be arranged donot trust you ferris said frankly
and i donot believe that the jewels can be salvaged
come along if you want
i canot stop you
but donot tr any tricks
pao chung accepted the warning with bland indifference
father called teucrete
leave me your protective suiting
khaljean smiled with sad irony
are you making choice
yes going with them
i know the way
i can control the ma2e and guide them safely back
i donot know if i believe in this fabulous machine or jewelsor whatever
but i think i might learn to believe in in him something have to find out
smiling khaljean stripped off his protective armor and yielded it to the girl
as an afterthought he handed her his blaster
the choice is yours to make
but in such company the blaster may come in handy
khaljean shook hands with ferris and angel though he avoided looking at pao chung
to ferris he said come back if you can
and look after my girl
in the meantime throw some gnawed bones to the police wolves and well manufacture a new identity for you
without a farewell khaljean strode into the crystalline forest
his lonely figure paused to wave
good hunting father teucrete called after him
she tripped keys at the console
light quivered in painful vibrations
his figure became transparent then dissolved
teucrete climbed into the suit of protective armor
ferris helped her zip up the clumsy garments then clasped her arm impulsively havenot the skill to say it properly but thanks expect your skill to improve with experience she said irritably fixing the blaster gun securely in its spring clip
returning to the console teucrete worked out an elaborate composition on the keys
tubes flared and flickered flamed and faded
there was the humming and the belltoned clamor like glass raindrops spattering on a ceramic floor
we have arrived she whispered
it was then pao chung acted uick as a striking snake he moved close beside the girt and snatched the blaster from its clip
backing away he waved the weapon in wide sweeps to menace both ferris and angel at once
teucrete turned and cried out
angel froze like a statue
ferris started a rush then thought better of it
new deal i think said pao chung brutally
from here on give the orders
angel chuckled ferociously
you canot get both of us pao chung
if we rush at once you can kill one but the other will get to you try it warned pao chung sweating but deadly
you keep talking of deals continued angel evenly
better make one with me
for the girl and a third of the loot talk business with you want her myself croaked pao chung
neither of you will get me alive said teucrete
ferris moved a little and the gun held steadily on him
he hesitated glancing curiously at angel
light glinted from quivering wings
the gargoyle face grinned hideously
heavy eyelids blinked in remembered signal
now snapped ferris
ferris and angel leaped like two moving parts of the same machine
angel was quicker
his powerful wings wafted him in a long swift bound
the blaster swerved flamed burst in deafening explosion
a reek of charred disintegrating flesh and singed feathers filled the air
angel shrieked in torment as his legs vanished in crumbling ashes
wings flailing his body a maimed and blasted horror he crashed down upon pao chung
the gun jerked from nerveless fingers and clattered on the floor
its beam cut a tinkling swathe among the crystal shafts
real droplets of halfmolten crystal struck myriad belltones in falling
writhing and threshing in agony angel clung to his desperate purpose
powerful clawlike hands circled pao head and wrenched it off
the head rolled free like a ball as two snarled bodies sagged together in bloody horror
stricken ferris bent over his friend trying hopelessly to help
the gargoyle lips parted
dry husks of sound whistled from them
go cn
smash the machine
but first do this job right for me
trembling ferris recovered the blaster gun cut down its intensity then thrust the blunt muzzle deep into the striped fur where rich crimson now mingled with the other gaudy dyes
blinking his eyes shut he pressed the stud
angel writhed and was gone
ferris did not look back
hand in hand with teucrete he walked slowly toward the forest of crystal shafts
there was much damage and his heart quailed from the task ahead
can you still find the way he asked numbly not sure the girl faltered not sure we can ever get back
exact alignment is so terribly important
we can try said ferris grimly
hand in hand young men and women with the dream still fresh within them will always seek the ultimate answer to the ultimate questions
it may be of course that there is no ultimate answer and that even the quest is a delusion
but teucrete and ferris with the flame of a new love burning fiercely between them believed that it was important to find and destroy some alien thing that warped mens minds
others may think only of ouilding a life together as a pledge to the future but not teucrete and ferris
time for that later they hoped
for the moment they might just possibly make mankinds tomorrows a little brighter or more hopeful
hand in hand they walked together to the crystal maze and entered
perhaps they found something

by from out beyond the second sun he came a fugitive from a dead and sterile world seeking solace friends a home on earth a planet of even greater terrors he sensation of which he was most conscious was that of loneliness
he was no longer very much afraid and sometimes he even thought that his enemies back home were no longer hunting for him
but in the midst of these strange creatures he learned that there was one thing worse than open hostility and that was indifference
they had no more interest in him than they had in each other and even though their indifference increased his own chances for safety it was a chilling thing none the less
he knew that though they were like him superficially they were intensely different within
he stood at a street corner trying to fathom the difference while the crowds surged about him buffeting him from side to side
they seemed to have no idea of personal dignity
he still understood their language only imperfectly and spoke it with difficulty but he had learned in a primitive way to read their faces and during this time of day at least their faces tola of a strain and fear all their own of an uncertainty even greater than his
they were going home from work and they were afraid of countless trifles that something unpleasant might happen that they might not get seats on their conveyances that bad news might greet them when they arrived
he stared with fascination at a heap of newspapers spread out on the corner stand
he could guess the purpose of these layers of white sheets covered with black or red symbols but he could not yet interpret them and he had no idea whether any one had seen or reported his ship
it was almost certain that some one had observed a shooting star but the chances were very much against any observation having been made of the stars slow dark drift to earth
at any rate he had concealed his ship among the growth of tall native plants and some day he would find time to repair the relatively minor damage he had sustained and continue his journey
meanwhile he had to make up his mind what to do here
his original store of food had been exhausted a week before as these creatures counted time and despite the fact that his metabolic requirements were low he had long needed to eat again
the food that was exhibited in many stores was of a kind strange to him but from the very structure and behavior of individuals who ate it he knew that it was of the right chemical composition
examining it cautiously with a small analyzer held close to his eye he noted that at least it contained none of the more dangerous poisons
it would do if he could obtain it
but he must obtain it in a manner that these creatures considered legal not as he had obtained his clothes
he recalled how absurdly different his own clothes had been constructed to fit a creature whose morphology was so much unlike theirs
he had taken over a suit from a man he had met driving on a dark country road not too close to the ship
he had stopped the car and put the man to sleep without difficult but there must have been a great outcry after his victim had awakened to find himself cold and naked in the drivers seat
he hadnot minded for he had already left the place where the incident had occurred
but he wanted no hue and cry raised here
although under other conditions he would have minded their hostility no more than their indifference he knew that hostility now might very seriously limit his freedom to act
he listed the things he had to do
he had to find food and shelter learn their language and customs and as quickly as possible their alphabet
he had to acquire their manner of thought and feeling so well that he could blend with them not only superficially but psychologically as well
he had to a shoulder caught him on the chest and spun him half around
a rough voice more a snarl than anything else said whatsa matter ya blind
the way the words were run together confused him but he had listened keenly and he knew the phrase that was required in such situations
he said politely but almost unintelligently excuse
i sorry
foreigner huh
why donot ya go back where ya came from
this was the first person who had spoken to him in his new world
the encounter left him angry and contemptuous but it was not to be long before he learned that the individual he had been privileged to meet was not wholly typical
he moved along alert to observe and to learn but entirely without aim so far as an ultimate destination was concerned
he noted that the nature of the streets he traversed changed subtly with every intersection
the primitive but well constructed buildings that had lined them soon gave way to even more primitive dilapidated and filthy structures
it was dear that they had rich and poor here and that he was approadiing the dwellings of the poor
he heard a rhythmic sound in the street as of a percussion instrument and following it found a female of the prevailing species dressed somewhat diiferently from the other females and pounding on a hollow cylinder of fairly large diameter
other more piercing instruments added sounds of their own and then voices were lifted in song
he lingered fascinated and wished only that he had a soundrecorder to take permanent note of the strange music
he was not the only one who lingered
half a dozen dilapidated males had gathered attracted like him by the rhytiimic noise and after a female had ended a strange exhortation which he did not fully understand they all followed the company of musicians into a ramshackle building
inside he listened to other exhortations and then had food thrust upon him
it was a bowl of soup the first nutrient of this strange planet that he had eaten
the taste as well as the quick ocular analysis he made indicated that it was deficient in many of the chemicals that he needed for his own nutrition but at least it had energy value and he imbibed it slowly and thoughtfully
when he had finished they asked him if he wanted more but he said politely no thank
the young woman who had offered it to him said oh youre a refugee i suppose
driven out of your native country
he nodded you have any friends here
he shook his head and said no thank too bad
you look as if you hadnot eaten for a long time
your face is awfully thin
yes thin
he did not explain that for a member of his race he was not thin at all your name please
name
what
how do people call you
kayin
my name kayin
kane rather a strange name for a foreigner
well donot worry mr kane well take care of you
her attitude helped erase the hostile encounter of an hour before
when they finally showed him a cot one of a row on which many men were already stretched out he tried to reconcile the contradictory kinds of behavior he had met and decided that the psychology of this race would prove more complicated than he had at first believed
the cot was extremely inconvenient but somehow he managed to stretch out on it like the others
he slept little and in the morning when he awoke it was with strained muscles and a sense of fatigue but he was eager to see more of the world on which he found himself and he left the next day to continue his wanderings
during the hours that followed he covered many miles of ground
with ears and mind open he picked up more and more words and by evening he was fairly confident in his ability to make himself understood in almost any situation
he went hungry that day but in the evening he slept much more comfortably at the foot of an old tree on a vacant lot
far above he could see the star from which he had come
he stared at it impersonally for a short time wondering whether he would see his own planet again
then he fell into a halfsleep one that rested him though still leaving his senses partly alert
he was becoming more accustomed to the rather short rhythm of the planet and he awoke at the first faint signs of daylight before anyone had noticed him
that day he encountered groups of men congregated about dingy little buildings on a dingy street
he found that they were seeking employment and knowing that the best way to learn about a strange race was to study the manner in which the people worked he joined one of the groups
but there was not a single occupation with regard to which he could claim experience and he was hired finally to do heavy but unskilled labor at eighty cents an hour
the work was more difficult for him than for the others
he looked like them but they had muscles which he simply did not possess
he was so clumsy at lifting rocks that another man with whom he was working said finally in exasperation you ever lift anything before
look pal do it like this
bend at the knees see it like this no youre doing it all wrong
i a nuisance it might even be dangerous to be stared at so closely
the fact was that his knees simply would not bend as human knees did
they were jointed in quite another fashion and no surface similarities could conceal the fact that in action there was all the difference of two worlds between them
he said sorry
i injured
oh canot bend them huh
this is no job for you pal
am stranger
know not what else
yeah its tough
he returned to his work again this time warmed by the others sympathy and less uneasy about being observed
and as he worked he thought sardonically of what they would think on his home planet if they knew
he was sure that his enemies would have roared with laughter
here was kayin the one they had feared for his brilliant mind for his knowledge of science for his practical skill
they had outwitted him with the odds on their side it was true driven him a hunted creature past strange stars and forced him to come to ground again in the guise of one of the meanest of a mean and unintelligent race
and even in the humble position to which he had been reduced he could not hold up his end of the work
he clenched his jaws grimly at the thought and the very motion made him realize that in no way was he like the others that even so simple a matter as the number and shape of his teeth might give him away
unintelligent as they were once they took the trouble to look with some care they would know a creature who was not one of them
on the second day of work he did arouse suspicion but at first not from the other workers
the creature that bared its teeth and barked at him was a dog
for a time kayin found the animals attention embarrassing
he threw a stone at the beast but it ran only a short distance and stopped to bark again
he had an idea of what the trouble was
that day he had replaced his worn trousers by a new and baggy pair of overalls not yet saturated with the scent of human beings and the dog had noticed his own faint but strange odor
now it was making a nuisance of itself and drawing everyones attention to him
that mutt donot like you mac said a foreman who passed by
funny about dogs the way they bark at some people someone laughed
kayin threw another stone but the beast dodged and continued to bark
his audience was growing now and skin began to twitch nervously in a way that itself might have drawn an audience if they had been in a mood to notice such details of behavior patted cat this morning he said apologetically
crazy dog smells cat
he would have them all staring at him if this went on much longer and he knew that he had to act quickly
looking around him he spied a compressed air hose lying on the ground
he picked it up turned on the air and directed the nozzle at the dog
the blast knocked the animal head over heels and sent him howling on his way
everyone laughed and kayin turned back to his work in relief
but from now on he knew that he must wear no new clothes
as the work progressed his attention turned from the immediate tasks at hand and he began to wonder what its purpose was
there seemed to be hundreds of men all engaged in menial tasks all part of some greater overall plan
he began to wonder too if people who could make such plans could be so unintelligent as he had first assumed
or was it simply that their intelligence had not developed that they lacked the background of science to make the most of their minds to use the resources their planet possessed
a rough voice almost the twin of that first rough voice of two days before growled hey you wake up and get movin
whaddya think youre gettin paid for
he swung his pick without looking up
the foreman had no idea that the tall foreigner he knew as kane was staring at him curiously with tiny camouflaged eyes that quite literally grew in the back of the strangely shaped head trying to understand what made the human being tick
by the end of a week kayin was confident that he knew the language well enough to start reading it
he went to a public sdiool which he found was open in the evenings and there joined a class where someone explained the alphabet and made clear to foreigners that english was a language full of traps and pitfalls
kayin absorbed the information eagerly but after the third lesson he found the pace much too slow and did not return
he had never before encountered a language of so strange a structure and the adual making of the sounds gave him trouble but the basic principles of language study were as valid here as on his home planet and he learned rapidly
by the end of a month he could read
by the end of the same month he had learned too the nature of the project on which he was working
on several occasions the engineer in charge had passed by him to exchange a few words with the foreman and once with the man who had ordered the building
the words had been significant
there could be no mistake for kayin had come across them in his reading
laboratory had a very definite meaning
and there were such expressions as incubation tanks and thermostat controls
all in all enough to let him know that they were engaged in constructing a plant for the manufacture of biochemical substances
he knew that there were biochemical plants already in existence scattered over the civilized part of the planet and the thought of great danger did not occur to him
but he continued as the men around him would have put it to keep his ears open and as time went on he became more and more disquieted eanwhile his relations with the people amon whom he worked became almost human
they greeted him every day as one of themselves asked casual questions about the place from which he had come and the way he had lived and accepted the answers as if with a quiet confidence that he was telling the truth
once in an access of good feeling one of them had gone so far as to slap him amicably on the shoulder and kayin had experienced agony such as he had never felt before
but he managed to conceal the pain and even to laugh weakly
he made sure however that a similar incident would never happen again
whenever someone approached him too closely he opened his extra eyes very slightly ready to step aside at the touch of a too friendly hand
he had not realized how much his own attitude toward them had changed until the day an accident occurred
a large shelf of rock had unexpectedly turned up to block the excavation of a wide pit and it had been necessary to shatter it with dynamite
but the explosive did not at first go off and one of the men had gone back to see what was wrong
he had been just in time to be knocked down by the blast itself and to be covered by the mass of dirt and broken rock that slid into the excavation
it was kayin who ran for him first digging frantically away at the smothering mass without regard for the fragments that continued to rain down upon him
and after he had reached the man who was unconscious but still breathing it was kayin who had wondered why on this earth he had taken the risk for the sake of a creature who meant so little to him
there was other risk as well he found when they summoned a doctor to treat the injured man and someone suggested that kayin had been injured too
but kayin quickly shrugged off the idea that he needed treatment and went back at once to his work
he wanted no doctor discovering what unusual arms and legs and internal organs he had
in the days that followed he continued to wonder at himself
working together with these men he had changed
but he must be careful he knew not to change too far
they had only he was certain to see him as he was to realize his difference from them and their friendliness would change to hate causing them to turn from him with fear and loathing
the building had reached the stage of scaffolding and he was still at work
it was now that he learned the full truth about the project which was soon to come into operation
he was on the outside of the building and two of the men in charge were nearby
one of them shrewd and elderly had financed the building the other in his thirties was the scientist who had invented the process
they were speaking in low tones tones which no human being standing in position would have been able to understand sure blayson that theres no danger the older man was saying
the scientist smiled always some danger mr lymer especially when you try something new
but theres nothing we shouldnot be able to control still donot think that you know too much about what youre doing admitted that myself
but we get results donot we comer the world market mr lymer
name your antibiotic and well make it
and in addition to anything now being sold well have dozens that nobody has even imagined
i think given you enough evidence to convince you of that suppose you have
but this use of cosmic rays makes me uneasy
you still donot know enough about them
it was at this point that third and fourth eyes usually so completely concealed popped wide open in surprise and terror
it was fortunate that no one took the trouble to look at him at that moment
the younger man was saying confidently we ll control them
all we need to know is that theyre high energy higher than anything we can produce here on earth and that we can concentrate them in a way no one else can nothing to fear nothing that ordinary precautions shouldnot enable us to handle
nothing kayin thought but the danger of depopulating most of a planet
his mind went back to what had happened on the second planet of his own sun what had almost happened on the fourth planet
within the space of a few hundred centads of time the second planet with its population of four billion had lost every inhabitant and become a sterile monument of a dead civilization
only the warning of what had already taken place had enabled the second planet to survive
and in this place too disaster would strike quickly
kayin had begun to read more and more and he knew what was taking place here
science had developed quickly but sporadically
vast regions had remained untouched by it masses of people knew nothing of it but the name and the fact that it could perform miracles
true they had learned that certain discoveries might lead to disaster as well as to the improvement of their lives but they still failed to test their discoveries fully before using them they still failed to exercise the necessary controls
the young man blayson had made his discovery ahead of its proper time
at the rate at which human science was progressing thought kayin at least a hundred years would have to pass before such a discovery could be considered safe
at the present stage it simply could not be controlled
the concentrated cosmic rays would as blayson evidently anticipated cause tremendous mutations in living organisms in the molds and mycetes of different kinds it would lead to the manufacture of useful antibiotics
but they would also lead to the production of entirely new forms of submicroscopic life forms not susceptible to ordinary methods of sterilization forms that would multiply with inexorable speed
these forms produced from bits of human tissue would inevitably be deadly to human beings and related species
he himself thought kayin possessed of a different body chemistry might escape
but he would be the only intelligent creature to do so
aand after the viruses had done their work the planet in its desolation and sterility would resemble the second planet of his own star
if he had learned of the imminence of disaster at the time he first arrived he would hardly have been affected
he would have hated to see a race disappear
he had the scientists desire to keep any race even the least useful alive so that he might study it and at the very worst write an article about it
but now and this he realized almost to his amazement he felt practically human himself
it must be the way he was living and working the way the others treated him on the job
he did not want to see them annihilated was the only one to know the danger
he realized at once that he could tell no one
blayson and lymer had eyes only on the fortunes they intended to make and they would have refused to beleve anything that stood in the way of those fortunes
nor could he go to anyone else
there would be questions he imagined himself trying to inform the mayor of the city
some underling would be sure to meet him
you say theres danger mr kayin
that how you pronounce it name you come from
he would have to invent answers in advance for every possible embarrassing question
and then would come the most embarrassing of all how do you know theres danger
there was no answer to that
could he say that he had worked in the same field of research himself
or could he give them the example of what had happened on another planet
it was a problem that he would have to solve by himself
he racked his head and found no simple solution
he had his optical analyzer and one or two additional trifles like it but there was no special apparatus he could use no weapons
outside of his scientfic knowledge and his nonhuman brain he had only the same weapons as the human beings themselves
and these were hardly enough to put an end for gcxd to a project on which so many human beings had built their hopes
the buildings approached completion the laboratory equipment began to be installed
and then finally when delay was no longer possible on the eve of the very day that was to see the plant put into operation kayin acted
he knew that until work actually began there would be but a single night watchman and it was this man at whom he struck first
a single carefully amed blow with a padded club produced unconsciousness
kayin did not strike hard but he struck hard enough
as the watchman fell kayin seized the man bound and gagged him
then he entered the building and began to destroy
he started with the cosmic ray collector working quietly and efficiently and concentrating on the electronic and magnetic parts
these had been ordered long before the building itself had been begun
they would be hard to replace
he passed on to the giant incubator vats and finally turned his attention to the collection of formulas which reposed in the files
these were important but he knew that they were not enough
the most important formulas of all lay in the mind of the man who had developed the process and that was for the moment at least beyond him
what kayin was doing now was playing for time
he was setting a match to the papers of the last file when he heard a voice
more time had passed than he realized and they had come early on this day that was to have seen the beginning of a great enterprise
they must already have noted the absence of the watchman
now he heard a gasp from lymer a groan that must have come from blayson
then there was cursing slow bitter and steady
then footsteps and lymer was standing at the door of the office and shouting here he is
blayson was shouting to someone outside and knew that in a moment the entire building would be swarming with people
he promptly tossed one of the fiiles at lymer saw the man shamble and fall in an effort to avoid being hit and was past the door before the enraged man could scramble to his feet again
then he was in the great incubation room with its monstrous vats heading for the opposite end
but before he could reach it a door swung open
a policeman appeared and shouted hey you stop
he dashed out through a side door into a small control room
he locked the door behind him
he heard a dub pound furiously upon it and tlie pounding ceased as the policeman decided against a further waste of time here
kayin ran to the other door
as he did so the knob turned
he threw all his weight against the door and turned the key
men pounded on both doors and he looked around for windows
there were none
he was locked in
he heard voice open up
you canot get away
there was it was true no way out
but kayin said calmljr stay away or blow up the building
a fter the destruction he had already accomplished they had no way of knowing that he was bluffing
the pounding stopped
through the door he heard the whispered sounds of consultation
then voice again come out
we wonot liurt you realize that
you realize you think that i am afraid do you not
there was surprise in the tones of reply
you donot sound crazy but but what other reason could i have had for destroying so much valuable equipment
he heard lymer say over a hundred thousand dollars worth
that cosmic ray collector cost at least that
a policemans voice you saw him mr lymer
recognize him
no never saw him before in my life
blayson shouted again this time with unconcealed anger come on out
with pleasure
but first i should like to talk to you talk later
no
he knew that later they would not listen to him and he realized that if he could convince blayson of the danger of the project his battle would be won
do you want to know why i did so much damage mr blayson already answered that
no i am not insane
it is you who are failing to use your mind properly
your method is extremely dangerous
how do you know have made similar studies absurd
no one on earth has done anything like this didnot mention earth thought kayin
aloud he said patiently you are mistaken
your experiments are not new and it is known he did not say where it was known it is known that they can lead to disaster
they can produce microorganisms of a virulence never before seen here just imagining things do not imagine
at this period your discovery is of too treacherous a nature to be used
blayson was silent and kayin hoped that he was thinking of something else than breaking down the door
you will not be the first mr blayson to have surpressed a discovery of so great significance donot believe you
open the door
in a moment
but think of what i have said
open the door
half a moment now
you do not care to listen further
a policeman growled stalling break it open
no need for that said kayin shall come out
perhaps if i speak to you face to face you will believe me
he removed the jacket and shirt and tie to which he had become so accustomed these past few months
he stretched his muscles freely and smiled a bitter smile to himself
he said the door opens outward
please give room
he turned the key in the lock and slammed the door open
then he leaped forward
he could hear tlie shouts of horror he could see them standing there petrified
it was a reaction that he had counted on
a policeman fired his revolver but so excitedly that every bullet missed while he yelled not human not human
the gravity was a little too great here for him to do any real flying but at least his wings unfolded at last could take him high into the air in the great room terrifying and confusing them
as he slowly floated down he could see them racing around madly
he headed for the door to an outer room
a policeman who was standing in his path could not move his bulk out of the way in time
kayin crashed into him and sent him sprawling
then from behind him another policeman aimed a blow with the butt of his gun
with his extra eyes kayin saw what was happening and a blow of his great wings knocked the policeman down
then he was running down the corridor using his wings to give him a little extra speed
the door through which he had just come swung open again and a bullet sang past him tearing into the nonfleshy part of his wing
he hardly felt it
he was outside
the noise of the shooting had spread the alarm
another policeman came running took one look at him closed his eyes and swayed there
kayin seized the mans own club and hit him over the head with it
he dragged the unconscious body into a deep clean concretelined pit that had been reserved for some of the dangerously radioactive byproduct that he was now sure they would never make
in the dark of the pit he stripped the policeman of the uniform
the man was broad across the shoulders and the uniform fitted nicely across wings
now he leaped out of the pit adding his yells to those of the others
a car the one in which blayson and lymer had arrived was standing parked at the edge of the yard and he slipped into it
he was out of tlie yard before they realized what was happening
but a policemans uniform he knew was too conspicuous
a mile away he stopped a puzzled truck driver threatened the man with his revolver and drove away a moment later with an extra less conspicuous suit of clothes
he turned on the radio and learned as he had suspected that an alarm for him had already been broadcast
he left the car on a deserted side road and changed into his truck drivers outfit
he knew enough now about human customs to feel momentarily safe
and he knew enough also to realize that they would institute a nationwide search for a strange creature with wings
he would not be safe for long
he had to get back to his ship of which fortunately they knew nothing
they might suspect but they could have no idea of where he had hidden it hat night still dressed as a truck driver he broke into a factory that made electrical appliances
when he left he had with him most of what he needed for repairs
it was two days later that he reached his ship with a supply of food
he hoped that he had been unobserved but he could not be sure
he set to work using the earthmade supplies to patch up in makeshift fashion the damage caused by the crash
another two days and the ship would operate
he was short on fuel but if he looked for it he knew he could find enough to send him on his way and leave this planet for good
he realized now that he didnot want to leave
in the days he had spent here he had gradually lost some of his feeling of loneliness
almost despite themselves these human beings had made him feel like one of them
their planet would never take the place of the one he had left but in many ways it had become a second home to him
he had made it uninhabitable for himself
if he had said nothing done nothing then no one would have suspected and he would have been allowed to stay until disaster struck them all
at least he had delayed that
the radio that night brought him the news that blayson who had been slightly injured in the struggle had been taken to a hospital his mind temporarily gone under the shock of what had happened
he would be unable for the time to reconstruct what kayin had destroyed
lymer disheartened by the loss had announced that he had no plans for rebuilding the factory
despite their stupidity kayin had won them a respite
he had won nothing for himself
the following day he heard warning sounds and saw groups of men closing in around the ship
he was pleased to see that despite all difficulties they had traced the path he had taken
they were not so stupid after all

night was falling and in the darkness the ship leaped upward at a sharp angle
now there would be hundreds of people who saw the shooting star but this time a star that shot upward
he rose to a height of twenty miles and remained at that level cruising slowlly
far above he could see through the viewplates the star vega they called it here which was his native sun
already an exile from his homeland he was now being exiled from his second home
suddenly he knew that being exiled once was enough
he was tired of fleeing through space tired of making friends and then being forced to leave them
he had made a home here and here he would stand and fight
below him the surface of the planet was now rocky and deserted
the ship began to sink
it was still dark and the vessel came to rest slowly and inconspicuously upon a craggy peak where there was little danger that any human being would stumble upon it
far below he could see the outline of a town picked out of the darkness by light reflected from clouds above
looking through a distance viewer he could even distinguish the individual lights and he was able to read a sign that flaunted its message boldly alongside a bridge he smiled and said softly in the language that was no longer strange to him accept the invitation
stretching his wings he parachuted down through the darkness to level ground prepared to become once more a member by adoption of the human race
and this time as he walked cautious and alone through the night he no longer felt lonely

secretary read it it tomorrow now on sale spoilers of the spaceways by out beyond hyperspace soared the transmuted terran to trygon where all mad men die willingly for the empress
i be said that the resistance palomar for while the astronomers probegan at the moment the great spaceship pounded tleories as to its origin and from trygon first appeared as an un composition it entered our atmosphere and known body on the photographic plates at came to earth on the runways of idlewild airport just outside of what was then new york city
nothing need be said of the panic caused by its coming
three went immediately in a ground car to the united nations building in the city
the records of their pronouncement have unfortunately been lost but from subsequent events it has been established that they granted terra fifteen days to submit to trygonia
then they returned to space
fifteen days later they returned and crushed the feeble opposition they encountered was tired of seeing nothing but white the walls and ceiling of his small windowless room the few pieces of utilitarian furniture and the sheets covering the narrow bed which sagged under the weight of his muscularly massive sixfoot fiveinch frame
he was tired too of the white bandages on his hands and although he could not see them the white bandages that swathed his head and face leaving only slits for his eyes and mouth
today is the day he thought
why donot they come
as if in answer to his unspoken question the door latch clicked
savage turned his head to watdi the door open
as it swung wide the doctor entered followed by general strathmore and two nurses guiding a wheeled tray time to take them the doctor said
no one answered but savage felt his hands grow sweaty in their wrappings
as the group reached the bed a nurse handed the doctor a pair of surgical scissors
he bent over savage as he said take the hands first
there was no sound other than the snipsnip of the scissors as the doctor carefully cut through the gauze
finally the sound stopped and savage looked at his hands
they were white and soft but there were no scars to betray the fingerprint change
the doctor permitted himself a small smile of satisfaction but the room was pregnant with tension as he turned his attention to the gauze covering head
the snijjsnip came again as the cold steel slid slowly over his skin
an eternity passed before the sound again ceased and a nurse carefully removed the freed gauze
for a long moment there was no sound and savage looked anxiously from face to face and tried to interpret what he read there
the nurses stared in disgust and horror while the doctor looked satisfied
the general beamed
beautiful job the general said finally and the doctor nodded in agreement
let me see savage croaked through stiff lips
a nurse took the hand mirror from the bedside table and held it in front of him
from the glass the bearded face of a trygonian stared at him there was no mistaking the narrow chin the high broad cheekbones and aquiline nose
a lmost a month later savage stood at attention in the office
he wore the flamboyantly brilliant uniform of a trygonian officer
medals and orders sparkled on his breast
his new face wore a sardonic scowl
fleet captain choon reporting sir he said and the stern face relaxed to a half smile
sit down ross the general invited and indicated the chair beside his desk
so youre ready to go eh
how do you like yourself
well savage smiled have to keep myself from going for my gun when i see myself in a mirror but outside of that pretty used to it by now made tremendous strides in the twenty years since we went underground
i guess it was the pressure
but phillips told me that by every test youre a trygonian
i hope however that you havenot become one emotionally
that was the one thing we were afraid of when we decided to use the ceregraph
choon died of course but how was it for you
nothing to it sir
i just seemed to go to sleep and when i awoke i knew everything choon knew but doctor phillips almost drove me crazy testing me to find out whether picked up mental outlook
apparently though the ceregraph transfers only knowledge not emotions
thank the lord exclaimed the general heavily want to thank you for this opportunity savage said wanted to do something concrete against them since they killed my parents twenty years ago whether or not you can do something concrete is up to you
the general was stern again
you were chosen because of your physical and mental qualifications
you just happened to be exact physical double
fortunately he was rather shorter than the average trygonian
doctor phillips told me that except for size there is no anatomical difference between the trygonians and ourselves said savage
it is his theory that the highest intelligent life form on any planet suitable to the evolution of intelligent life will be a humanoid type
that may be possible but exact duplication seems strange the general said
although interested in i havenot had a chance to read your report
i think you have time to fill me in on some of the details
why do they call their planet trygon trygon is tlie name of their sun explained savage
their system consists of three planets trygon and until about seven hundred years ago only the middle planet trygon was inhabited by their race
then they discovered a method of utilizing solar energy directly and what amounted to a social revolution took place
at the time trygon was divided into a number of countries
the discovery was made in a country called czur and with it czur conquered the rest of the planet
they used pretty brutal methods but they welded the entire planet into one country using one language and having one ruler
space was the next step and they explored the other planets
the innermost one was hot and lush and eventually they tamed it and now they grow all their food there
the third planet as might be expected was cold and bare but it was fantastically rich in minerals
they transferred their mining and manufacturing to the third planet leaving trygon the center of trade the rich and the military
there are a number of commercial spaceports but only one military near the capital city named czur in honor of the country that started it all
two hundred years ago they ventured into deep space
earth is the fifth humanoid planet they have conquered quite a history said tlie general
what form of government do they have
autocratic
the emperor is the supreme authority but the high commissioner works out the details and sees that the orders are carried out
ail military matters are in the hands of the emporer and in that respect the high commissioner is just a figure head
as you can imagine there is a deal of intrigue
yes i can see that there would be agreed the general
he glanced at the wall clock
but its almost are there any last orders
savage asked
the general smiled wryly
it might be said that there were no first orders on your own ross
we donot know what you can do but if you can get into one of their intrigue groups you should be able to do something
the rank of fleet captain carries a lot of weight
all i can say is be careful and do your best skeleton crew is moving out and the station is going on automatic as soon as you leave
savage stood up saluted and then the general took his hand and shook it warmly
savage turned and walked out of the office without looking back
outside two guards waited and they walked together down a long hall to a bare cementwalled room
there was only one way to make sure that he would look like an escaped prisoner and they had to make sure
so they fought and when they were through his uniform was a sad caricature of its former splendor and he had the beginnings of a black eye
he shook hands with the two men and then went up tliree flights of stairs where the trygonian patrol ship waited
there was no one in sight as he climbed into the ship and roared away but antiaircraft guns opened up almost immediately
savage smiled grimly as he saw the shells burst a safe distance from him hen as he was almost out of range the ship lurdied from the blast of a near miss
a hole appeared in the hull beside him and he saw his sleeve rip and redden as a fragment cut across his arm
he switched on the automatics and cursed the unknown gunner as he crudely bandaged the flesh wound with part of his already torn shirt
at least he thought finally it would add verisimilitude to his story
an hour later he crashlanded on the outskirts of what had once been denver colorado and what was now the trygonian capital for north america
then be settled down to wait for tlie trygonians
something less than ten minutes passed before a ground car skidded to a stop near the wrecked ship
two trygonian soldiers jumped out with handblasters at the ready
more sedately as befitted his rank a senior lieutenant followed and savage walked briskly to meet him
the lieutenant qed savage dubiously for a brief moment and then snapped to tlie salute
at ease savage ordered
take me to headquarters immediately
yes sir the lieutenant replied and followed savage into the car
it was evident that he was wondering why such an exalted personage as a full fleet captain should appear in a single place patrol ship and in this condition but savage let him wonder
the soldiers reentered the car and they sped away with a fullthroated roar
savage remained grimly silent as they roared through the trygonian capital gonians were everywhere but still eartlunen predominated and savage wondered what had induced them to remain
there were probably many reasons he decided for man in spite of everything must live somewhere and he must eat
after twenty years they were probably used to it
he had lived briefly in denver as a child but nothing remained now of the city he had known
the old buildings had been blasted during the invasion and starkly functional ferroconcrete had replaced the rubble
at the very site of the old state capitol the trygonians had raised a towering structure to house the offices of the high command
they filed into the building and as the lieutenant had done the honor guard eyed him dubiously before snapping to attention
savage strode haughtily between them and finally after a succession of guards and lesser officers he was ushered into the presence of vice admiral harna fleet captain choon he announced
the admiral was tremendous
he towered a full foot over savage and his heavily decorated uniform was stretched tightly over a majestic paunch
his great jowls moved loosely as he boomed choon by the great galatic gods
i knew your father on the old arrano
he was the best executive officer i ever had
but sit down you may leave
lieutenant and tell me what you are doing here
what happened to your uniform was taken by the terrans
the eyes became iq chips have just escaped from stronghold have you by the eternal stars the admiral interrupted
too many of our men have vanished in spite of reprisals but this is the first definite proof of an organized movement
where is it
about five hundred ling north in the mountains savage said and the admiral went into action
with his left hand he flipped a switch and a colored relief map of the area sprang into view on the wall while with his right hand he pushed up a row of communicator buttons
ready three attack units for immediate takeoff he roared will take personal command
have my car at gate three
with the buttons still up he asked
what is the exact location
savage moved quickly to the map and examined it closely
after a moments hesitation he said as closely as i can make it it was zone three sector five
it was well camouflaged
the admiral roared tlie location into the communicator and slammed down the buttons
with swiftness surprising for one of his bulk he strode to the door
you will come with me in my flagship choon
these miserable savages wonot give us much of a fight but it may be of some interest both be decorated for this
a hour and twenty minutes later the fifteen unit fleet was hovering high over the canadian rockies zone three sector five
at the direction savage examined the mountain below through the electronic scatmers
although he knew there was no one left in the hidden cavern below him it was an effort to point it out it had been his home for a long time
the admiral barked coordinates into the microphone and then barked an order
one ship detached itself from the formation and dived toward the hidden entrance of the cavern its heat guns burning great swaths through trees and brush
it made a second pass and antiquated antiaircraft guns opened up tearing the air futiley
savage barely suppressed a start of surprise before remembering that the guns were automaticradar controlled
the admiral roared into the microphone again squadron three cover one and two land and deploy for attack
remember i want prisoners
as the ships descended the antiaircraft guns opened up again from their now revealed turrets and as they fired the guns blasted them into so much molten scrap
finally they were completely silenced and the attack ships landed and the soldiers deployed
they were almost to the entrance and savage was beginning to wonder what had happened to the trips when an atomic blast took away the side of the mountain
the troops and five trygonian ships went with it
the admiral had had within his grasp a stronghold of the resistance and he had lost it
it could be argued that tlie loss could not have been avoided but in his service such an argument was not admissable
a full report was sent to trygon and both the admiral and choon were recalled
the three ships which first found terra had been equipped with ordinary space drive and had been in space for more than eighteen years
lacking a radio which would cover the immense distance one of the ships had taken a seebnd eighteen years to make a report of the conquest
but in the meantime both space radio and space warp had been achieved and fortyfive days after the abortive attack they were on trygon they were placed under house arrest in hotel suites and two days later the admiral was given a swift trial
he was demoted three grades and then given permission to retire
having extracted the penalty for failure from its admiral the supreme command would next turn its attention to erring fleet captain capture by the enemy was bad enough but he had given the information which had led to serious losses
confined in his suite he waited anxiously for two days more without receiving word and then he received a visit from a captain lin
after identifying himself lin said you are in serious trouble with the high commissioner sir and not about your capture or the attack on the terran stronghold
at least not directly
you had better sit down while i tell you what happened will stand thank you savage said coldly
as you wish sir
its hard to believe but every file and record concerning you for the past two years as well as the records of the trial have been either destroyed or rewritten
officially you are here on leave
and to top it off was found dead this morning
the evidence pointed to suicide but it is believed to be murder
what exclaimed savage and found a chair
the high commissioner is blowing his jets continued lin with thinly veiled excitement
he doesnot know how it was done but he suspects that the empress ordered it
if thats the case his hands are tied but in the meantime hell do anything to get you have been instructed to advise you to deny everything except that you are indeed home on leave
incidentally no one is to know of my visit
how about the guards
savage asked
lin smiled am in command of the guard detail
i must return to duty now but please remember that you are a person of extreme importance and as such you must be very careful
before savage could reply lin turned on his heel and left the room leaving him to ponder this sudden turn of events
how could anyone change everything so completely he wondered
if it was on the empress order why should she take such an interest in him
why should lin give him tlie information
who did he represent
an hour later a knock on the door brought him out of his private hell he panel slid open and a lieutenant in the jet black uniform of the fleet strode in importantly
behind him came four enlisted men in the same uniform two of whom planted themselves firmly beside the door with their hands on openholstered blasters
the other two wheeled in an equipment table
savage waited with silent calm while the lieutenant crossed the room and drew himself to attention
then he asked sharply what is the meaning of this intnision
i demand every courtesy of house arrest and this does not fall in that category am under the explicit orders of the high commissioner the officer said icily
any complaints should be addressed to him
i have also been instructed to take any necessary action to carry out my orders
and what are they
savage parried
please be good enough to follow me to the table the officer said fingering his blaster
savage followed
at the table the officer flipped a switch and from somewhere in the apparatus came a hum
then a flat plate set into the surface of the table glowed and savage was instructed to place his hands palms down on the plate
he did so and the officer pushed a button
you may remove your hands he said and bent over a double eyepiece
after adjusting and readjusting a pair of knobs he raised his head and gave savage a surprised look
he bent down again and made new adjustments
at last he straightened up
his voice lacked some of its former arrogance as he said thank you sir
the lieutenant and his men left without saying anything further and savage wondered what they had tried to prove with a fingerprint check
apparently however the high commissioner was covering every angle
the episode gave savage a momentary feeling of pleasure which however was quickly replaced by his former doubts
several hours passed during which he had lunch before a knock again sounded
this time as the door slid open
savage could see a double row of crimsonuniformed men the personal guard of the high commissioner himself
the guards stiffened to attention as the commissioner appeared followed by a group of high ranking officers
now what savage wondered as he ramrodded his spine and saluted
the group stopped in front of savage and the commissioner didnot bother to conceal his distaste as he announced without preamble his supreme mightiness emperor hlar ruler of the universe has seen fit to bestow upon you
fleet captain jarlon choon the order of trygon
at the mention of the decoration an officer stepped forward with a flat gold case
opening it he took from it a heavy golden chain from which depended a jewel encrusted medallion
this he hung about neck
then he stepped back into position and the commissioner went on am further instructed to inform you that you have been promoted to the rank of commodore
commodore loong here will give you further orders senses reeled from this succession of shocks as the commissioner turned and strode out with his retinue leaving only the officer who had presented the decoration
loong waited until the door was completely closed and then he laughed uproariously
savage could only look at him with amazement until he finally stopped and said did you see the look on his face
i think he would almost rather have marooned himself on an asteroid donot understand savage said
to tell you the truth i donot either loong replied
have you ever been to court was born in space said savage
that checks and thats what puzzles me
i have been reliably informed that it was the empress agents who caused the alteration of your records
in addition to that
palace gossip has it that she persuaded the emperor to honor and promote you
the emperor was against it
you saw for yourself how the high commissioner felt the explanation have none savage replied stiffly
loong glanced at him sharply and said in addition the empress expects you at the palace this evening
full dress uniform is required of course
i think you should also wear this
he produced a small bolstered needle gun not as messy as a blaster but just as effective at close range
above all be careful
you have very few friends took the gun and went to his room to change
things were moving a little too swiftly
why was the empress so interested in him
there were a lot of unanswered questions and no immediate way to get the answers
he dressed quickly strapped the needle gun to his left wrist and returned to the living room
how do you fit in he asked loong bluntly
as an officer in the space fleet i am under the orders of the emperor the empress and the high commissioner he answered evasively have arranged for a car
the driver has his instructions
you are not coming
savage asked
no but be here when you return
in the meantime ordered supper
the brilliantly lighted palace was thronged with splendid uniforms and lavish gowns and the main hall was a babble of sound
it stilled abruptly when the name of commodore choon was announced
all eyes were on him as a servant guided him across the floor the women gazing at him with frank speculation and the assembled officers and rtatesmen with envy or thinly veiled hatred
loong was right he had few friends
he was led up the long curving flight brings a new lease of life

at the end of a long hall they stopped before a plain door and the servant rapped lightly
without waiting for an answer he opened the door and motioned savage inside
the empress was regally beautiful tall and slim in a sweeping brilliantly hued gown
although she was more than twice age neither her face or figure showed t
she extended her hand as savage crossed the room and knelt before her
he kissed her hand and she said rise commodore choon son of admiral choon
come sit beside me
thank you said savage long time ago i knew your father verywell she said
she smiled reminiscently and murmured very well
and we too shall know each other well
you are fully as handsome as he was
and so one question was answered
he remained with her a long time and when he retraced his steps to the main hall he found it more crowded than before
again all conversation ceased as he entered the main hall and he could feel countless hostile eyes on him
he felt decidedly uncomfortable as he crossed the seemingly endless room and he felt himself walking too stiffly
he tried to relax but instead he found himself pressing the needle gun against his side to make sure it was still there
finally he reached the great double doors and he heard speculative murmurs behind him as the footmen opened them
this was the heart of a powerful interplanetary empire and yet it was no different than the courts of europe during the heyday of the ancient kings
his chauffeured car waited outside the palace and in a moment he was speeding down the winding roadway through barely visible gardens and groves
then they passed the gates to the public highway
as they slowed and turned the corner there came the flare of heat guns
the glassite windows on the attacked side turned a rosy pink and then went black
the interior of the car became insufferably hot
the chauffeur cursed and trod heavily on the accelerator and the car shot forward
flame licked at them until they were out of range
the driver mopped his brow as he said a good thing shes got full armor
even so i thought wed had it
yes snapped savage
they roared through the now almost deserted streets without further incident
on his guard now savage had the little needle gun in his hand when they stopped in front of the hotel
the doorman stepped forward and pulled open the door
he looked into the car and his hand flashed into his uniform
savage fired
the gun made no sound but the doorman gave a choking gasp and fell into the car
quick sir pull him all the way in savage heard e chauffeur whisper
there were no witnesses take care of him
without stopping to think savage followed the chauffeurs advice and dragged the heavy weight into the car while the chauffeur alighted and came around to help him
finally they closed the door on the body and still without witnesses the chauffeur drove it away
in his suite
savage found loong waiting
good morning loong smiled
how did everything go
just fine savage replied
not only do i have no friends i have some active enemies
you were attacked
loong asked calmly
twice savage said
you donot seem very surprised rather expected it but you seem to have survived
what happened
savage told him in a few brief sentences and when he was finished loong said this is better than i had hoped
better than youd hoped savage exclaimed
what am a target for your friends to shot at
they are no friends of mine loong answered been in space for a long time better fill you in on recent history right now
ill i at that point that savage was shocked to find that the anger seething inside him was not that of terran toward trygonian but of one trygonian toward other or one terran toward another
he found too that in spite of the uncertainty he felt about he was actually beginning to like him
he wondered then if doctor tests were accurate better loong smiled when savage sat down
here have a drink and tell you what i think the shooting is about
savage took the proffered glass and waited expectantly
as you know loong began kalnor was emperor until hlar then high commissioner staged a coup detat
kalnor and his family were murdered and hlar proclaimed himself emperor
czako our present high commissioner was captain of the household guard and was elevated to his present lofty position as a reward for his part in the conspiracy
during the years you have been in space our esteemed high commissioner has secretly been laying the groundwork for a coup of his own
rhe situation is really quite simple the emperor wants to remain emperor while czako wants to become emperor
fortunately at the moment neither seems powerful enough to dispose of the other
now consider the situation as it applies to you
a formerly unknown and unnoticed fleet captain has suddenly been decorated and promoted on the orders of hlar himself and this after records concerning nim were altered
he has been invited to the private chambers of the empress where few men are invited
the high commissioner fears the emperor and hlar is jealous of his wife
so loong spread his hands expressively to finish the sentence but savage needed no more clear enough he said but how do you fit in am the faithful servant of the emperor and his representative the high commissioner
you said that before savage said
loong just spread his hands again
then he asked abruptly what do you think of our planetary policies
the question took savage aback
what do you mean he stalled mean our policy of immediate conquest and subjugation of any inhabited planet we discover loong replied
that depends said savage carefully
he drank slowly watching loong over the edge of the glass
on what i think smiled loong know what i think
i want your opinion
savage decided to take a chance believe a friendly diplomatic approach would be a far better method he said
for example in the case of terra exactly loong interrupted heatedly
nothing permanent is gained by force
a conquered people will not remain so forever glass suddenly slipped from his hand
as though from a great distance he watched the liquid splash on the rug and then the room seemed to be receding in the distance
he tried to rise urgently aware of his dangers but instead he felt himself collapse
then all sensation ceased
he had no idea how much later it was when he awakened in his own bedroom
other than a slight headache he felt no effects of the drug
he saw that the trygonian day had come again but that meant nothing he could have been unconscious for several days
then he rolled over and found that loong was sitting beside the bed sorry i had to do that loong said calmly but i had to be sure
sure of what
savage said checking an impulse to say more violent things
your sympathies
and
loong reached inside his tunic and brought out a needle gun
your scientists did an excellent piece of work
what do you mean
savage asked and at the same time knew there was no escape mean that you are a terran
you betrayed yourself under hypnosis
savage knew the bitter feeling of utter defeat
he had accomplished nothing and now this was tlie end
but loong wasnot wearing the look of triumph that was to have been expected
instead he was smiling and he put the gun away as he said should hate to see you executed
i wasnot just talking last night when i disagreed with our policies
i think a friendly and mutually beneficial relationship can and should be established between our planets fine said savage but what can you do about it
that remains to be seen answered loong propose that we join forces
the fact drat you have been able to come this far makes you a worthy ally
and without me you can do nothing
is it agreed
yes said savage
excellent
i have several matters to attend to but i will return at six
as a recently returned space officer it will be expected that you enter social life to a certain extent and i think it best that you begin tonight
a fter loong had gone savage cursed himself for a fool yet he thanked the gods that he was still alive
something could still be made of this
a vague uncrystallized thought was gnawing at his mind
he jumped out of bed and dressed quickly
he was not surprised to find that loong had left him the needle gun
without bothering with food he went to the state library
his rank carried him into the innermost recesses of the great library to the guarded tape banks where the most accurate information was to be found
after a quick search of the index he selected two tapes and tlien took one of the many unoccupied reading booths
he slipped the first tape an ancient history of trygon to fill the blanks in education into the projector and all thought of time left him as he slumped down in the so chair before the screen
it wasnot long before he realized that a rough parallel could be drawn between tlie early histories of trygon and terra
there had been wars and famines and great empires but trygon had progressed more rapidly without the great recessions terra had known of a century before the beginning of atomics on terra trygonian scientists had already harnessed solar energy
at that point the parallel ended
it wa already late when he turned to the history of the kalnor family
he found that they had ruled for almost a century first czur then trygon and finally the system and the empire
there had been periods when usurpers had gained control but always the kalnors had returned until finally kiar determined to put an end to the family had destroyed them
the tape hinted vaguely that there had been a survivor and then immediately discredited the thought
then the tape came to an end and savage put tliem both away
things were somewhat cleared now
loong in a full dress uniform hung heavily with decorations was again waiting when savage returned to the hotel
what were you doing at the state library loong asked after they had exchanged guardedly friendly salutations
doing a little checking savage said calmly have a theory that working on
by tlie way i havenot eaten all day
will you order something for me while change have already done so find a fresh full dress in the bedroom
you can tell me about your theory when youre finished
savage wcnt to the bedroom and found beside the fresh uniform a belted holster containing a larger version of the needle gun he still wore
as he hefted it the reason for his presence on trygon came to him again and he thought about loong
by training and instinct he should have hated him and all trygonians for what they had done to his people but he found it a hard struggle to achieve that feeling
he liked and somehow trusted loong and at the same time he still wanted freedom for terra
still pondering the problem he dressed quickly not neglecting to buckle on the gun and returned to the living room
a food laden table awaited him
loong poured drinks as he entered and gave him one
what is your theory
loong asked not definite yet tell you when it is
veiy well replied loong want to apologize again for last night have done the same thing savage said
they ate quickly and in silence
when they were through loong declared in for a treat tonight
i have reservations at the club galaxy
oh said savage with polite interest
he had seen or heard the name somewhere but it meant nothing to him have to hurry or well miss the first show loong said and pushed back his chair have a car waiting outside
armored
savage ask
completely he existence of the club galaxy was discreetly proclaimed by a small lighted sign and inside the theme of smallness was continued
packed into its narrow confines was the highest strata of trygonian society uniforms predominating
they were guided to a microscopic ringside table just as the already dim lights dimmed still further
from somewhere came soft gentle music and a spotlight went on to reveal a male trio
they sang a song barely heard over the buzz of conversation and then bowed themselves out to the accompaniment of a light spattering of applause
then the lights faded out completely and the spotlight cut off
all conversation ceased and an air of expectancy filled the room
with an unexpectedness that made savage catch his breath the music crashed out in a wild driving rhythm
the spotlight cut suddenly through the dark and caught a whirling figure in the center of the floor
the audience gave a gasp of appreciation in which savage shared
the dancer spun on her toes a tall longlegged girl in the briefest of costumes her long hair flashing in a golden circle
she broke the spin abruptly and danced with flashing feet and writhing body to the wild rhythms
she moved with the precision of a fine machine yet with the graceful beauty of a wild cat
she gave a magnificent performance and when the spotlight suddenly cut out her audience shouted its approval
but when the lights went on again she had disappeared and in spite of the ovation she did not return to the floor
she never takes a bow loong explained but you will meet her shortly
a waiter suddenly loomed large over them and loong spoke to him briefly and he went away again
they made small talk and presently the waiter returned bearing three glasses and a decanter of purple liquor
savage questioned the third glass with the raise of an eyebrow
laharna is to join us loong explained
it is a great honor to be favored with her presence at ones table
almost as if summoned by words she appeared on the opposite side of the floor
she crossed it with the same easy grace she had shown in her dance her hair flowing gently down over her bare shoulders as she moved
although she had typically trygonian features
savage thought her the most beautiful woman he had ever seen
he wondered if it was influence again
they stood to receive her and savage found that she was as tall as he
may i present commodore jarlon choon loong said and savage bowed
delighted commodore
i have heard a great deal about you
her green eyes sparkled at him mischievously am honored savage began but a harsh voice behind him interrupted choon the empress lover is trying to make another conquest
savage spun around his fists clenched but loong grabbed his arm
careful he whispered urgently satish the high right hand man
savage shrugged him off and remembering the formula said you have affronted my honor sir
who is your friend
attention had been drawn to them at the arrival of larhana but this exchange brought all eyes on them
satish stood up towering over savage and said thickly captain droga will act for me
let it pass interjected loong
he is drunk
not too drunk to teach this whelp to respect his superiors satish bellowed
captain droga make the arrangements
his distaste for the affair evident loong reluctantly conferred with captain droga while the two principals stood aloofly silent
in the end it was decided that the duel was to take place immediately on the grounds of the palace of the stars
the claoice of weapons was and he decided on needle guns
satish and his two companions stamped out and savage turned to laharna who had stood silently by deeply apologize for causing you this embarrassment he said
she looked at him soberly for a moment
then she smiled and gave him her hand
until we meet again she said
thank you he said and turned away reluctant to leave her
a lane opened through die hostile faces surrounding them
they walked out quickly and found their car waiting
now youve done it loong said as they entered the car
satish is deadly with the needle gun
if you lose the high commissioner will have my head for being your second
and if i should win
savage asked donot know
we may be able to salvage something if i can get to the commissioner first
but were not ready yet
the agreet is just beginning her trials in the morning and had word that you are to be her captain
we must have her if we are to do anything at all
and as her captain you must have me savage said
not exactly but it would be a help have to see what happens savage said and relaxed against the cushions hey raced through the crowded streets and then out of the city
a short time later they pulled to a stop on the dueling grounds and found that satish had already arrived
savage moved to open the door and loong said wait taking no chances
he opened a compartment built into the back of the drivers seat and took out a pair of heat guns
he buckled one to his belt and gave the other to the chauffeur with instructions to keep his eyes open
all right he said as prepared as well ever be
i just hope you can shoot straight
the two parties met in the middle of the field and a further discussion took place between loong and droga
the car lights were to provide illumination and tlieir positions were established
then the guns were examined
finally satish and savage were placed in position with ten yards between them and the guns were given them
the seconds backed away
under the rules you will raise your guns and fire one shot at the count of three loong said loudly only head shots are permitted
if both miss honor is satisfied and the principals will leave the field
your guns down please i am about to count
savage braced his feet and stood relaxed a light firm grip on his gun
one
what was the connection between larhana and loong savage wondered and what was plan
two
he had to go along with loong he decided
his comments on the terran situation presented interesting possibilities
larhana was the most beautiful woman he had ever known
three
with a swift continuous motion savage swung up the gun centered the sights and pressed the stud
there was no sound no sensation and for a moment he thought thej had both missed
then satish swayed and crumpled
savage lowered his gun
under the rules he had to remain in position until notified of the results
others ran to satish
loong bent over him briefly and then shouted dead
savage walked toward the huddled group and as he approached droga protested was not a head shot he said heatedly
look it grazed the chin and entered the neck beg to differ loong countered insist argued droga demand satisfaction concur with captain droga broke in satish s second companion will act for him
but loong protested and savage interrupted if he insists he insists
it is his right
they were quickly placed in position and again loong counted
at three savage again swung up the needle gun and pressed the stud head snapped back as his shot entered the ground almost at feet
savage remained in position until loong summoned him no doubt about it this time loong said triumphantly
right between the eyes honor is satisfied said second companion and he turned away
he walked a step and spun around a blaster in his hand
a blaster cut him in half chauffeur had kept his eyes open
then there came a blaze of heat this time from car and flame burned the grass beside them chauffeur turned his attention to the car
a stink filled the air
loong worked his heat gun and they made their way back to their car behind a wall of fire
they roared away and there was no fire from the other car didnot think a heat gun was any good for spot shooting the chauffeur apologized so i used a blaster
good thing said loong or wed all been fried
he opened the well stocked compartment and brought out a blaster
take this he said to savage drop you at your hotel and then try to see the high commissioner
you had better stay in your rooms until you hear from me
savage was breakfasting in his room the next morning when the communicator buzzed
loong here it announced when savage answered
things have come to a head
i couldnot get to see the high commissioner but he has already had an interview with the emperor
i can only guess what it was about but told that it was pretty stormy
but thats the least of it
the commissioner has just issued secret orders for your arrest
go to the roof of the hotel
one of my hilocars is already on its way to pick you up
thanks on my way savage replied and disconnected
he buckled on the blaster and with a needle gun in his hand he went to the door
the hall outside was empty and he ran swiftly to the service stairs
on the floor above he ran to the levitor bank and pressed the up stud
he watched the indicator impatiently as the levitor shot upward and stopped on the floor below
then it resumed its upward climb and savage held the needle gun ready as the doors slid apart to reveal a man with a blaster in his hand
savage fired and leaped into the car as the blaster clattered to the floor
the man was still crumpling as savage pressed the stud for the top floor
when the levitor doors again slid apart savage jammed them with a blaster and raced up the stairs to the roof praying that the hilocar would be waiting
it was there and it took off with savage acceleration as soon as he was aboard
blaster and heat gun fire burned the air as they rose and then it faded out of range
whew savage breathed that was close not out of it yet the pilot replied a hilocar on our tail
a glance behind confirmed the pilots statement and savage said my hand blaster wonot do any good against the stuff they carry
can you get away from them using full power but theyre gaining a high powered heater mounted behind you bring it up
a of the fuselage slid open and a long turretmounted heat gun rose into view
at the same time the seat back slid down to permit entry into the turret
savage climbed in and settled himself over the sights
all right he said cut your speed
at full aperture this weapon didnot require supreme accuracy
savage pressed the firing stud and the other hilocar was engulfed in flame and then it exploded pilot dived to ground level and after half an hour of maneuvering between over and sometimes almost through hills and trees they were deep in the mountains south of the city
they landed in a mountain clearing
then the trees in front of them slid apart and they rolled down into a ferroconcrete cavern the terran stronghold repeated
larhana greeted him as he alighted
what are you doing here he asked involuntarily am wanted too she said
hurry commodore loong is waiting for us
the cavern hummed with swift orderly activity larhana led him quickly through it but savage had time to note the fighting ships being readied and the blasters and heat guns being uncrated and loaded
finally they entered a small room where loong alone awaited them
quite a place you have here savage said been preparing for a long time replied loong now we are going to make use of it
how prince kalnor asked savage quietly
his hand was on the needle gun in his pocket
the high commissioner has
what did you say
prince kalnor your majesty
how did you know that
loong asked
he clutched at his blaster
but savage brought out the needle gun and he stopped the movement
it was evident from the beginning that you were not working with either the high commissioner or the emperor but at the same time it was evident that you were highly placed in a third organization
then you yourself mentioned the kalnor family and i went to the state library
with two powerful factions competing for the empire it struck me that only the kalnor name would attract enough adherents to form a third party
it wasnot until a few moments ago that i realized that you were the kalnor in question that you would be the leader and not a follower
now that we each know who the other is like to know exactly what you intend to do about terra after weve put you on the throne of trygon meant what i said the other day the prince exclaimed
terra will be free
and in time the friendly relationship of which i spoke can be established
savage realized that he could use the prince to bargain with the emperor but once he had kalnor would the emperor stick to the terms of whatever bargain he had made
no it was ridiculous to think that he would
he would have to trust the prince all right with me savage said and put away his gun like to know whats happened though
an attempt was made on the life and at the same time the high commissioner proclaimed himself emperor
something went wrong however and the emperor did not die
as a result we have what amounts to war between the two factions confined to the military and the city of czur
the average trygonian citizen wonot become involved
how about your men
savage asked
they are adapting to conditions and at the same time spreading a rumor that a kalnor will come
when i give the signal they will drop all pretense and fight for the name of kalnor
now we must hurry to get control of the a greet
a ship is being readied to take us there
all right go said savage the light of battle in his eyes coming too announced larhana and they looked at her in surprise be no place for a woman savage said probably be a battle green eyes darkened and loong said no use arguing with her
if shes made up her mind to come nothing short of a blaster will stop her right larhana said and they went out together ship proved to be one of the latest medium fighters crammed with firepower and short on passenger space
they found cramped space against the control room bulkhead and blasted off
minutes later they were approaching the great fleet spaceport on which rested the tremendous agreet
a minor battle was in progress below them for control of the port but it was impossible to tell one faction from the other radio operator worked his instrument with swift efficiency and the gunners peered into their scanner plates and fingered their controls
after a suspensefilled eternity the radioman said okay and their ship dived toward the agreet
a port opened in the huge hull and they floated in
they alighted quickly and a pneumatic car carried them swiftly forward to the bridge
there they were met by an officer whom loong introduced as captain sian
everything is ready your highness sian said careful not to notice the presence of larhana
the officers faithful to either the high commissioner or the pretender fi4 have been confined
the bare minimum for the operation of the ship remain
very good said loong with formal dignity
commodore choon will you kindly take command
yes sir
captain sian you will take off immediately and establish an orbit at three diameters
all screens are to be thrown out as soon as we are clear and any ship that attempts to interfere is to be destroyed
yes sir said sian and he went to the main controls
the ship vibrated strongly for a moment and then they felt it rise gathering momentum as it went
we made it said larhana taking arm
yes said savage but we still have a lot to do
he was very certain now that she had attracted all trygonian officialdom to the club galaxy so that information could be gathered from licjuorloosened lips for loong but he didnot know how much further their relationship extended
the return of sian recalled savage to the problem at hand
good news your highness he announced
our men have captured the pretender and are proceeding according to plan
and the commissioner loong asked
where is he
he is directing the operations of his forces from his offices in the supreme headquarters building your highness
what are your orders
he must be destroyed at any cost loong said grimly
an assault would be indicated
screens have been set up to guard the building sian said
the most powerful blaster will not penetrate them
we must use the atomics then destroy half the city savage interrupted been too much bloodshed already
what do you suggest then asked loong
have you any men in the building
savage asked
we nave not been able to contact any sian said
well perhaps this will work
we will make a concentrated attack using the armed scouts and your fighter
during the attack i can take one of the scouts under the screen land near the building and force my way in
that might succeed agreed loong
but once inside youd never find the commissioner
you donot know the building go with you couldnot permit that your highness sian objected
your life is too valuable to risk
what loong flashed but savage interrupted right he said have to remain on board the agreet will go in your stead your highness sian said firmly
very well said loong unhappily will make the arrangements said sian
we will use number seven scout
he excused himself and left the group while loong turned to savage am beginning to understand why we have not been able to completely subdue your people
tell me what is your terran name
savage told him have studied one of the terran languages a bit english i believe it is called and it seems that your name is also a word
what does it mean
untamed savage said
aha said loong
at this point sian returned
we will be in position to launch the attack shortly he said
we had best make ready
i beg your pardon but the lady seems to have disappeared
so she has said loong after glancing around
well we canot look for her now
they took another car to their scout ship and exchanged their uniforms for more efficient fighting suits black coveralls crash helmets respirator masks and battle packs
they were each provided with a heat gun and a blaster but savage strapped the little needle gun to his wrist over the coverall sleeve
for sniping he explained
loong held out his hand
good luck he said and savage remembered the general he attacking fleet the medium fighter and twelve scouts roared in over the city and blaster fire came up to meet them
they passed through the wall of flame with the loss of only one scout and then they opened up with their own weapons
the only effect of their combined fire was to make the invisible force screen protecting their target flash and flare
they made a second pass
two more scouts went down and savage decided that they too crashed
he manipulated the controls and the scout lurched sickeningly and went into a steep dive
at the last possible moment savage pulled out and barely off the streets roared bctween the buildings toward supreme headquarters
he slowed as they approached the building and rested one hand lightly on the bank of blaster studs
brace yourself were going in he said and slammed down on the studs
a chunk of wall in front of them disintegrated and he decelerated savagely
they went through the gap at dead low speed but still they crashed through two inner walls before they finally stopped
they were bruised and shaken but otherwise unhurt where we get out savage announced and voice came from behind them
wait for me she cried and they whirled around
from somewhere she had gotten a suit of coveralls that were almost the right size as well as a helmet and mask
two blasters were belted to her slim waist and the whole effect was one of efficient deadliness spoiled only by the loveliness that insisted on making itself known through the coveralls
what are you doing here
savage finally got out wanted to help you she said simply
what are we to do asked sian
we surely canot leave her here have to come wdth us go savage said there was no time for argument or recrimination
he kicked open the hatch and jumped down to the rubble covered floor
flames were already crackling behind the ship as planet stories july he helped larhana alight and when sian had joined them he blasted their way through the wall into a corridor
with sian in the lead they ran to the levitor bank
they had just reached it when a pair of doors slid open and blackuniformed men poured out only to be cut down bloodily by blaster
the carnage lasted only a few moments and then they were in the levitor offices are on the fortyfifth floor sian explained as he pressed the stud
they will be thick with his men of course
savage nodded grinfly his weapons ready and watched the moving indicator
then as the fortythird floor clicked by and they were bracing themselves for the rush a muffled blast rocked the building
the lights went out and they were hurled to the floor as the car stopped abruptly
then they began to fall
for an agonizing moment they felt helpless doomed
then the safety brakes went on and the car ground to a halt
what happened
larharu gasped
the fire must have gotten to the scouts fuel or blaster magazine and it blew up savage said
but weve got to get out of here
sian produced a hand torch while savage tried to open the doors jammed he said after a moments effort
stand back use a blaster
the car filled with heat and smoke and the stink of burning metal came through their masks
finally he had a mansized opening and he stuck his head out cautiously
a blaster bolt from down the hall gashed the door above his head and he recoiled
burn a hole through the back while i keep them busy he ordered and he felt reflected heat from behind him as he filled the hall outside with flame
a few minutes later he heard sian whisper from close behind him everything is clear on the other side and larhana is on guard
as soon as i finish this we can get out of here
alternating his attention between the hall and sian savage watched him set a block charge boobytrap with practiced efficiency
then he was finished and they stepped over the tripwire and out of the levitor hey ran across the room and as they went through the door a blaster roared behind them
sian screamed and fell only his momentum carrying him around the angle of the door jamb
savage whirled to return the fire and then the block charge erupted and was thrown against a desk
protected by the wall larhana was already at side as savage picked himself up
vainly she was trying to staunch the flow of blood from the cleancut stumps that were all that remained of legs
savage quickly took two pieces of plastograft from his kit and with them sealed the stumps as sian ground out between clenched teeth got to get czako
he struggled to get up but fell back into arms sweat glistening on his face take care of you first savage said
get czako sian gasped
take the stairs
room five leads to ofl5ce
armored door use block charge
three blocks
hurry hurry his voice trailed off to nothingness and he died green eyes were blazing as they cautiously traversed the offices
at the fortyfifth floor savage tried the door
it opened and then the frame splintered under the impact of a heavy needle gun
they dropped to the floor leaving the door ajar
he held his heat gun and blaster together and quickly shoved them tiirough the opening toward the unseen gun and pressed the studs
they roared and a scream answered
still on the floor he twisted his weapons around and batlied the hall with flame in the other direction
then he scrambled to his feet and with her dancers agility larhana followed him
behind the flame of his weapons they ran down the scarred hall and found office five
savage took no chances he used the blaster on the door and his heat gun was on as they went in
the rooms furnishings were reduced to charred ruins as were the three guards but after the draperies and papers were consumed there was nothing leu to burn
keep your eyes on the door while i get the charges ready savage ordered
he went to the armorr door set into the opposite wall and carefully taped on the block charges
then he set and connected the igniter
returning to larhana he said we donot have much time now
cover me while i toss a couple of charges down the hall
as soon as they go off run aaoss to that other office and get under cover
quickly he prepared two more charges setting the igniters for contact
he threw one and it had not yet exploded when he threw the second
the roaring double blast shook the floor and ferroconcrete dust filled the hall
behind a sheet of flame they raced across the hall
then slieltered behind the wall they waited for the next blast
savage was ready to believe that something had gone wrong with the igniter when the roaring thunder came
the rolling concussion lifted them and then slammed them with cruel violence to the floor
they lay dazed for a long moment before they were able to get up and return to office five
this time there was no interference
the charge had blown in the heavy door and crushed under it was a twisted needle gun and its crew
of the five other men in the room only one seemed capable of movement
he made a feeble effort to raise his blaster and savage cut him down
they found high commissioner czako dazed and bleeding behind bis huge desk
savage hauled him roughly to his feet and jabbed the blaster into his middle finished czako he said
get on the radio and tell your men to lay down their arms
czako nodded in bitter defeat
i three trygonian months later when his highness emperor kalnor met 
savage and larhana at the great spaceport
above them loomed the agreet ready to depart on its voyage through hyperspace to terra be back someday larhana promised
yes agreed savage as much trygonian now as terran but we want to see terra on the road to complete reconstruction first
