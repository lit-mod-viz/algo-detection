at mencevns edgar franklin author of call to arms the chase of the concession etc guanamas gratitude from almost any american in guanama the statement would have been mildly startling coming from edward hemmett so long the sturdy citizen of the united states it was downright amazing
i guess um not an american any longer an honest togoodness guanaman for the rest of my days
fernandez his fatherinlaw smiled the plump and placid smile of advanced argosy middle age and gazed from the terrace of the edward hemmett home
sloping away from the hilltop to the waters edge the capital city of puerto carlo lay with its million lights
beyond stretched the big harbor twinkling in the rays of the moon rich with the little spots that meant ships while off on the distant north crescentpoint at the harbors mouth the huge searchlight of the new fort played aimlessly up and down the skies
you have never taken out your citizenship papers here edward murmured fernandez
not yet get around to it some day yawned the president of the hemmettgirton tobacco company
and renounce your allegiance to the stars and stripes eh
what
hemmett started a little
i er suppose so
one might do worse edward fernandez laughed gently
ours is a wonderful little country growing more wonderful all the time
in the four years that you have been here see what strides we have made in manufacturing
see what capital has come into guanama
see what mighty factories have been built to furnish clothes and shoes and shells to the incredible armies of europe
another decade edward and among the great powers will stand guanama
he nodded as he rose
hemmett smiled indulgently in the velvet darkness
that was one small failing of all guanamans to feel when a new factory or two had been built that guanama was the worlds industrial center
nor was hemmett disposed to argue the point this evening he was lazy with an afterdinner purely guanaman laziness
he wished merely to sit here on the terrace of his beautiful home and reflect upon the almighty goodness of life in general
so that he did not even accompany his native to the street when that gentleman made for his own exquisite mansion just across the way he lounged farther back in his chair gazed at his cigar and thought
first and last guanama had been good to him and to steve girton
guanama had furnished them some of the finest tobaccoland in the world with the biggest profits
guanama had paid the pair of them an even million dollars for the capture of dr manuel hervira the national menace four years back
guanama had kept steve as its perfect secretary of war at a very tidy salary and had been wise in so doing
not to mention his other income from the country good old steve was like to draw down that annual twentyfive thousand for life
and guanama had given hemmett carmen fernandez for wife which was best of all
mr hemmett then listened to the superb united states piano in his drawingroom and to the laughter of edward hemmett jr aged three and yawned gloriously
north america was all right but south america and guanama in particular was better
steve girton was happy here too although he had not seen much of steve lately
girton to be sure lived right here in the hemmett home but most of his days were spent at the war office and most of his evenings lately had been spent somewhere else
mr hemmett frowned drowsy amusement at his own lethargic mental state
steve had mentioned dining somewhere but where
not that he was worrying because stephen girton was capable of taking care of himself in guanama or anywhere else
hemmett stretched his legs and drowsed through another hour to rouse at the sight of mr girton himself
or was steve himself
latterly he had been silent and preoccupied now he seemed to vibrate and glow in the darkness
latterly he had used many undertones now he shouted you
ned
wake up
eh cried mr hemmett happened going to marry me going to marry you
mercedes voice dropped in something like awe
mercedes tesoro
is that a fact
hemmett was wide awake and staring at him
it doesnot seem possible does it
it it may be possible hemmett chuckled
if carmen was willing to marry me theres no real reason why the next most beautiful girl in guanama shouldnot marry you i suppose but say i do congratulate you old man
carmen ll be tickled to death too
she said something about you and mercedes and i paid little or no attention but well by thunder we are guanamans now in good earnest arenot we
for the rest of our lives i guess muttered mr girton with the strange solemnity that had come upon him
silence followed for a little the heavy comfortable silence of two men who understand each other perfectly
hemmett was thinking pleasantly of the luck that had come to his old friend girton thrice started humming a little native lovesong and thrice caught himself and stopped
and then his own thoughts straying in the direction had taken he mused after a time it isnot a bad place to live our lives all things considered
i suppose it looks more like heaven to you just now than anything else hemmett chuckled but its not so bad at that
we had sortie rousing adventures here in the good old days but things are quiet now and forevermore at peace with herself and the world and if they had only reelected ferrata president everything would be perfect
briefly stephen girton left the rosegarden of his personal thoughts
how in blazes did they ever elect altara anyway he demanded
nobody ever thought the radical party had a lookin everybody assumed that ferrata could serve for the rest of his life
but they jammed in altara by a hundred votes and hell make a rotten president
he will that hemmett agreed
he seems timid abotit his own shadow
his darned inauguration yesterday was rushed through like a wedding ceremony in an aldermans office
but it was just as legal and binding girton grinned
a lot of those votes for him came down from carama way where theyve built the uniformmanufacturing city
i know theydid said hemmett and a lot more came from the ricoto neighborhood and the new factories there and if it comes down to that the heaviest altara vote in any one region came from the section of this very town where the employees of the national engine works live
that went perfectly solid for altara
and here they stared at each other in gentle astonishment until girton smiled do you suppose theres any connection between the two things
have our various new big employers of labor been influencing their employees to vote out ferrata
i doubt it hemmett said slowly
although this whole industrial boom is rather queer to my mind
almost anything queer is likely to come of it
why just see what is happening here at this minute steve new factories are furnishing millions of dollars worth of supplies every month to the european armies thatjuld be made more cheaply and bought more cheaply in the united states and carried to europe more cheaply after theyre made and say a fact isnot it cried mr girton
well although i have never given it much serious thought until the last week or so it is unquestionably a fact been so infernally busy with the tobacco business that never considered the matter until very recently but it is a fact that certain european nations are paying more than they need to for the stuff made here
why
well for that matter why did all the money flow in and why did all the factories start up at about the same time
it all began two years ago
it all began about the time that certain of our senators decided that guanama needed a big navy and jammed through the proposition in the face of all kinds of opposition
girton spoke suddenly and second by second the languor of recent months left his countenance just as it was leaving it all began about the time that canita the confounded pacifist went up in the air and decided that the harbor here needed a fort big enough to defend two panama canals and jammed it through the senate too
in fact the whole business now that i think of it seemed to begin at once
a long halfminute they gazed at each other through the gloom
stephen said hemmett have we been suffering from the native tendency to hookworm of late years
has somebody been putting over something that got by us altogether been wondering that without mentioning it ever since i realized that altara had been elected without a reason in the world for electing him
and so have steve more particularly since the infernal radical party got a majority in the senate as well as a president
and whats more oh bosh nothing to it i suppose
girton laughed shortly queer all the same he persisted
so are all the factories cropping up so suddenly
so is the national engine works with what must be seventy or eighty million dollars worth of capital at least
what is the concern anyway
ostensibly a mighty corporation partly native organized for the purpose of turning out the most perfect form of turbine engine
they must mean business steve bought up hundreds of acres out there on the point opposite the fort and paid tremendous prices for the land employing thousands of men and yes and why are they walled off
why have they a fifteenfoot fence about the whole place with guards at every gate
why is every man in the shops sworn to secrecy
because hemmett said mildly theyre manufacturing an engine on a device that is still a dead secret because patents have not yet been issued in several countries
that isnot necessarily criminal even if it is a bit odd
but he broke off suddenly for his native butler was at his elbow
a messenger senor for the sefior girton
he wishes to see senor girton himself
send him here that gentleman said briefly
the man departed to return with another native of guanama some thirty seconds later
the visitor was a stranger small and slim and immaculate in his linens he proceeded straight to girton and smiling and bowing extended an envelope
from the senor altara our president senor he purred
if there should be an answer i will convey it
he backed away while girton whistling softly switched on one of the electric lights set in the little tropicalfern jar at his elbow
whistling still he ripped the envelope and drew out the official sheet and be it said that he even continued to whistle as he read and then stopped whistling
what exclaimed stephen girton
what is it
hemmett asked quickly
another ten seconds girton gave to a rereading of the document before he looked up angrily
well it is a more or less courteous little note firing the secretary of war he stated bounced money money through history one finds many secretaries of war who have been disrhissed without undue excitement for all that we learn to the contrary most of them took it calmly enough but as it chanced steve girton had formed for guanama the only real army that country had ever owned
by hard persistent work he had welded straggling individuals straggling units into as compact a little fighting force as the heart could wish
when he appeared on the street people cheered the passing of official automobile periodically the papers had lauded him and resolutions had been passed commending his work invariably his lightest wish had been respected by lawmakers and he was human
there is an answer senor asked the messenger
you bet theres an answer the retired secretary of war cried
you tell your ratfaced little president to go to the devil and find some one else wholl give steve
hemmett cut in sharply
it may not be dignified but ceased to be an official and i donot have to be dignified
girton snapped not in love with myself but i know what done with this army business
if been asked to resign in the usual way have called it politics and resigned and charged it up to the justly celebrated ingratitude of republics
but this things simply a statement that i am dismissed and that my tenure of office comes to an end when read this letter
altara himself wrote that
hemmett cried in amazement
with his own hand
i have seen it senor the messenger broke in placidly
stephen girton looked him up and down
you go back and tell him that resigned he said bitterly
and if you want to go by the door instead of being kicked over the edge of this terrace go quick
i donot like your face and mad
the little whiteclad man vanished
hemmett laughed annoyedly
that was childish steve
maybe so snorted the exsecretary
it wasnot the job itself
we have plenty of money you know that
it was the idea of the thing and the way he did it and the infernal thanklessness of the whole proposition and and its queemess
hemmett nodded what impressed me first he said
only yesterday the novedades had an editorial on the possibility of a new cabinet and mentioned the impossibility of getting a secretary of war in guanama who could even continue your work and once more he stopped for once more his little butler was approaching
the senor enrico ricoro he announced
to see you both senores
together girton and hemmett gazed at the butler
the the rich ricoro the latter asked
the tobacco ricoro
the same senor
send him out here then hemmett directed and when they were alone again directed a puzzled little smile at his old friend about the queerest thing of the day isnot it this call
i supposed that ricoro was in the deadly enemy class
he has been ever since the mess when we tried to merge his tobacco interests with ours girton muttered
it canot be two weeks ago that he gave out an interview to the effect that the ricoro combine would never touch psst
ricoro was with them not the ugly grunting little guanaman millionaire of the past with every penny of his wealth tied up in tobaccoleaves and his ego swollen to several times its normal size but an oily bowing person who beamed pleasure unutterable
he held out his hands and girton and hemmett shook them wonderingly
he drew up another of the wicker chairs and proffered his case of really remarkable cigars
he rubbed his hands happily and lunged into the business of the moment itself an unusual performance in guanaman commercial circles which savor of the orient in most things
you are astonish that i come he chuckled
pero one makes mistakes yes
i have been in some things foolish
it is to forgive no
consider yourself forgiven ricoro hemmett said curiously
pardon me is this just a social call or a business visit
both if you will permit since i have come to your home senor ricoro said his engaging smile growing even broader
to sit here on your terrace and survey our city it is wonderful
to speak at the same time of pleasant little business matters that is better yet
no
i should say that it might depend on the business matters
of a certainty chuckled the amiable gentleman
and these senores i think you will find pleasant
i come with your permission to buy of you the extensive tobacco interests so ably conducted by yourselves
to buy them
for cash senor
ricoro went on smoothly
why fence senores
you know i know that the plantations have cost you perhaps one million and a half dollars united states
and theyve been paying dandy interest on two millions said girton
and for that reason senor i come to pay you here and now in cold cash as you say two millions and a quarter said the surprising ricoro
shall we have the papers drawn this evening and conclude the deal or may i call in the morning
an explosion of dynamite in the center of the terrace might have startled them a little more but very little
this was ricoro absolutely tobaccopoor as regarded ready cash this was ricoro who had scorned their own splendid holdings not two years ago steve girton kicked foot in the darkness
mr hemmett said simply nix
i do not comprehend senor
ricoro inquired a nice offer but i donot think well accept it
for one thing you are not talking actual spotcash
but senor cried ricoro
before ten in the morning at the national bank of guanama the money shall be handed to you in gold if you wish
aha
and for another thing we donot care to sell here is more valuable than ever and when the tariff in the united states has had a few more changes its going to be more valuable still
the offer is not enough
not nearly
two millions and onehalf said ricoro
yes but whats the idea of it
girton rasped
has somebody found gold on the plantations or is tobacco going to join the performers in some way we donot suspect
what is it
it is simply that having prospered i wish to increase my holdings senor
after which ricoro waited silently giving them the vague impression that his feelings had been wounded while hemmett and girton conversed in that wordless telepathic fashion that comes now and then to men who have known and understood each other through many long trying years
ricoro was seeking of course to give the affair the aspect of an ordinary big business proposition
yet an intelligent boy conversant with guanaman affairs must have known that it was well something else
a clairvoyant might have been able to delve into brain and find the answer for themselves the certainty remained that if their holdings were worth two and onehalf millions to ricoro they held the same value for hemmett and girton sprung it suddenly and at first glance it looks good ricoro said hemmett
but were not trust magnates and were not used to slinging millions around like cigars frank to say that if you offered three millions we should not accept this evening
but when weve had a week to think it over but a week senor
well
why not
the native drew a deep disappointed breath
as the excellent senor says why not he echoed
still i had hoped to close this evening
it is a handsome offer senor
it s so darned handsome that it makes one suspicious girton smiled with utter candor something so seductively lovely about it that we wouldnot close if you had a truck of gold in the street because weve lived years in guanama
it is final senor
for this evening at any rate
but after this evening slipped from the remarkable millionaire as he bounced to his feet and shrugged his shoulders disgustedly and as quickly smiled again
what about this evening
hemmett asked sharply
why is this evening the particular one to pay crazy prices for tobacco
ricoro spreading his palms deprecatingly before them retreated behind his bland smile
it is a trick peculiarly guanaman and bafflingly chinese
it means anything in the world or nothing at all
in this case it seemed to indicate that both of them were unduly suspicious of an inoffensive millionaire whose sole desire was to make them richer and when the smile had persisted long enough to convince them that ricoro was done talking business he made a few perfunctory remarks about nothing in particular and took his leave
down the street they heard the hum of his departing motor
mr grin was quizzical as he asked what in blazes do you make of it steve
nothing at all unless some overwhelming trust is coming down here to buy in all the tobacco of the country and ricoro s heard of it and borrowed enough to corner the supply before they get here
but he couldnot borrow two and a half millions in one lump
i know that mused mr girton and by the same token you and i know the country very well and i doubt if theres one man beside your esteemed able to hand out that sum in cash
through perhaps two minutes they smoked and pondered something behind that offer hemmett announced
something or other that has no immediate connection with the tobacco business
eh
sounds silly but it isnot steve the result of living so long in guanama i suppose and having thought about that queer election and the other queer things this evening a reason for everything that happens in this little old world my boy and theres no visible reason for anybody wanting to take over our tobaccoland at fifty or sixty per cent more than its actually worth
hence the reasons invisible at the moment
steve girton late secretary of war leaned back in his chair and chuckled a little
hemmett might be bristling with suspicion of an affair he could not quite understand but girton did not bristle at all
not one hour back stephen had become engaged to the most adorable girl in the entire universe and when one is in just that state it is rather hard to bristle at intangible things
i think youre all off ned he said quietly enough
i think ricoro has a brainstorm of some kind and believes that guanama is about to monopolize the earths tobacco market
what he has actually dqife is to form a little group of wealthy men make up a pool of two millions and a half and his voice trailed off
for the third time in a few minutes little butler was with them
mr william jones he announced this time
again to see you both senores
jones
hemmett echoed rather loudly
what jones
hush
girton said quietly the mystery jones ned must be for his names william the chap who landed last month and has been living on a whole floor of the new hotel ever since the fellow that rides around in the big white car he brought here with him heard of him
what on earth does he want of us
why not have him here and find out
girton laughed
mr form appeared in the lighted doorway and moved toward them
hemmett switched on another light or two and examined jones as they shook hands
very well dressed very conventional of feature he might have been anything from a prosperous small tradesman to the head of a corporation
he seemed to have the faculty of looking like absolutely no definite type and in a crowd it occurred to girton one would have passed him fifty times without knowing he existed
yet there was a queer assured ring to his voice as he said gentlemen the pleasure of making your acquaintance is very great
i bring you news
news
hemmett said
news indeed smiled mr jones
you both of you are about to leave guanama the face of the thing the mysterious mr jones was mildly demented
that was the one explanation capable of holding water
fifteen seconds back he had not known them now in the most ridiculously confident fashion he was ushering them out of the guanama they had done so much to make
what was more having delivered himself he bowed and dropped into a chair and laughed quite happily so that yes he was mad fast enough
did i er understand you to say hemmett began wonderingly
that you were about to leave guanama
you did mr hemmett jones laughed
you will leave i think on the steamer that sails at one tomorrow
just to please you mr jones
girton asked amusedly
to please me and because it will be to your considerable advantage said the caller his smile fading
i have come with a business proposition gentlemen which i believe you will find yourselves unable to reject
it seems to be quite an evening for business propositions hemmett muttered
jones apparently did not understand nor did he waste time with questions
he smiled polite inquiry at mr hemmett for an instant and then leaned forward earnestly astonished a good many people in my time gentlemen and i expect to astonish you said he
however it is your own fault
you two gentlemen have piled up quite a reputation in the past as engineers and railroad builders and down here youve piled up another as executives of the highest order
that sort of executive as you very well know is beyond price these days back home
in the united states
i referred to it as your home of course jones pursued with an odd flitting little smile
you have followed big business developments back there i take it
but you have naturally
and still said mr jones you havenot heard of the biggest one of recent years i refer to the railroad development
head thrust forward the peculiar gentleman narrowed his eyes and studied them intently for three seconds finally leaning back with a contented little sigh
i see that you have not he went on
so much the better the blackest kind of secret you know but you two have the name down here of knowing everything in the world and i almost feared but thats nonsense of course
mr girton mr hemmett
the greatest railroad system in the united states is about to be built a new system going into new territory with new rails and new bridges and new rolling stock with new methods of management and new methods of operating
it will be when finally worked out the greatest single feat in the history of railroading
that is absolutely every detail that i can give you at the moment
not another explanatory word can be spoken until you are established in new york
he snapped his fingers quite excitedly
girton leaned forward
say what the devil are you talking about he asked
i have done talking about the thing itself jones smiled
i have come to the point
we want two men at the head of the construction and we have combed the world for them
i believe that i have found them
gentlemen i offer you each a post with a tenyears contract at a salary of one hundred thousand dollars annually
hey
hemmett shouted
the first years salary to be paid tomorrow morning and yourselves to sail for new york on steamer
but we canot but you canot afford to do anything else
jones said suavely
your duties for three months at least will be essentially nothing
you will find offices in the city and those in charge will assign you to your own quarters and give you every particular that i am forbidden to give
gentlemen you accept
mr hemmett cleared his throat with some effort
if we were the brand of gentlemen who can be carried off their feet wed accept he said not
we have considerable property here and i am quite certain that it can be disposed of to advantage
i would almost guarantee to take care of that
and our home is here hemmett went on irritably
we belong in guanama man and who the dickens are you anyway
well my name is jones and a plain citizen employed by big interests the gentleman said simply
my father was an englishman and my mother german got a french grandmother and i was born in kansas city spent part of my boyhood in london and gathered parts of my education and business experience in berlin and paris
is that answer enough a little confusing but it ll do girton answered dryly
now tell us the reasons for the secrecy jones about the railroad
that i am simply forbidden to do
can you start tomorrow
the late secretary of war tried to catch the eye of his old friend jones was between them
it was a mighty offer a staggering offer
yet with its glittering gold it twanged so strongly on the string ricoro had set vibrating that suspicion welled up in girton
no we canot leave tomorrow
hemmett said sharply
and we canot accept a thing about which we know absolutely nothing or can you accept it at a salary of one hundred and twentyfive thousand
what
why er no
hemmett stammered
can you accept it at a salary of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars asked mr jones
the money to be paid in advance tomorrow morning
think
it was the very thing they were trying to do and a difficult thing when one looked at jones utterly calm utterly commonplace talking like a lunatic and still looking as if he meant just what he said
covertly edward hemmett gripped the arms of his chair when he spoke it was something like a man speaking in a dream
a a matter of this kind canot be closed in one minute he stated with conviction so overwhelming that it sounds er a trifle crazy jones consider it for a few days and then just what youll not do mr hemmett jones assured him swiftly
this thing demands an immediate answer because youre starting tomorrow i tell you
why what ails you man you understand the figures offering you see that for ten years you re acquiring the equivalent of another three millions apiece at five per cent
i hadnot an idea that youd even hesitate gentlemen far less well you have an idea now that hesitating
hemmett said dizzily man canot readjust his whole lifq in fifteen seconds just because some one comes around and tries to hand him the national treasury
hemmett cut in mr jones i offer you two hundred thousand dollars apiece the limit empowered to go and that settles it
will you be ready to sail
hemmett shut his teeth
stephen girton did one of the most remarkable things of his lifetime for he stepped forward and tapped mr arm and looked at mr jones much as if that gentleman had sought to pick his pocket
if you want an answer yes or no on the spot the answer is no he said sternly
we will not accept and we will not sail
you may be a maniac or you may be trying to hand us something that is simply beyond human understanding at present but that doesnot affect the answer
the answer is no
and now if mr jones had astounded them it seemed that mr jones himself was astounded
his jaw dropped and his eyes opened incredulously he squinted at stephen girton and his voice dropped
if theres any little deficiency in the mental stuff its yours he said unexpectedly
once in a while a man is offered something so good that hes bound to take it blindfolded and thank his stars it came his way what offering you and bosh not refusing
oh were refusing fast enough
hemmett contributed
not definitely perhaps but until weve had time to consider impossible
you accept tonight and sail tomorrow or its off
then its off retorted mr girton and would haye liked to clasp his brow
over william jones came the strangest of changes
where he had smiled he sneered where he had been amiable and commonplace hard lines appeared suddenly and gave him an indefinable evil threatening aspect where there had been little or no character there was a quantity of very unpleasant character
in two seconds the man had become a personality and a very disturbing one
i refuse to believe that thats final said he
it is final said mr girton turning down four hundred thousand dollars a year between you rather than make up your minds to pull up stakes in this spot
we seem to be doing just that the most unwise thing you ever did mr girton
is it
it is the new jones said curtly
will you be good enough to remember that i told you that
will you phone me if you change your minds before morning
you will
very well gentlemen
good night
and think it over gentlemen
think it over at the edge of the terrace watched the white motor coast downhill
then he turned back to his old friend with a confused smile
just about five minutes more of mr jones and theyd have taken me to the new puerto carlo asylum said he
was it real
hemmett faced him steadily
maybe it was the realest thing that has happened to us in guanama he replied that something big behind it just as there was something big behind that offer of steve
no one man no one concern is strewing money around in millions like that not exaggerating our own importance but were a certain power in this country and been thinking harder in the last two minutes than thought in four years
the object of this evenings little lunatic game is to get us out of guanama
do you believe it
mr girton asked sitting down quite suddenly
i believe more than that
why should those two propositions have been hurled at us that way if they wanted anything else
any two ordinary men would have fallen for both of em steve
if we closed with ricoro and closed with jones and the money was real wed have nothing to do but retire to new york buy up central park and build a home in the middle and theres something big behind it
you said that before
and keep on saying it until i find the answer hemmett assured him and heres another point that has been coming up in my mind
the factories the national engine works all the money that has come into guanama in the last two years
do you realize that almost every penny of it has come from one european nation
his eyes snapped
beneath the tropical tan long since acquired blood was surging up nor did girton remain unaffected
the recent dizziness returned to mr girton and he stammered you youve got the darnedest imagination possibly
but the thing that appeals to me is that in all common sense a nation and only a nation can spend money like that and the nation that has been spending millions on millions in guanama wants us to get out
yes
and here since the matter had ascended or descended to the purely ridiculous girton threw back his head and laughed suddenly
he caught frown and laughed the harder
he even slapped his knee and rocked for a little and he ended with a wheeze
well its a funny notion anyway he remarked
you think theres nothing in it asked the unsmiling hemmett
i have a glorious opinion of you and another of myself but i refuse to believe that a great european nation wants us to move to new york ned yes
mr hemmett rose with a dry smile
just the same well step across the street and have a guarded little talk with fatherinlaw said he
about all of this
not necessarily
fernandez is a guanaman with all the national characteristics no idea of telling just what has happened and having him form his own theories and chatter about them to every other capitalist he meets for the next month but it does happen once in a while that by careful sounding papa fernandez can be made to drop a helpful little hint or two steve had more than one clue to a peculiar situation from his lips and come along
silently he led the way across to the magnificent fernandez home and merriment died out within him
for one thing he could find no tenable answer to the double riddle for another ned hemmett had a disconcerting way of being absolutely right just when one fancied that imagination had carried him away and at the doorway hemmett was turning to his friend and saying gravely let me do the talking steve
if he knows whats afoot hell drop a clue
they found fernandez in his library a room magnificent as all the others but rather cluttered just now with hunting paraphernalia
this was the season when of late years fernandez had been taking to the mountains for a week in quest of some of the reasonably big game to be found there
a highpowered riflebarrel lay across his desk and he smiled at them over it
ah edward
the boy in bed he said
not yet i believe
he hadnot come to kiss me good night when i left hemmett said rather lazily the thirty gun isnot it
that is the thirty edward the one pedro almost ruined last year
look through her now
he offered the riflebarrel and hemmett held it to the light and squinted through
rebored eh
nice clean job too he said
i didnot know youd sent it
this afternoon smiled fernandez when it came back eh
it takes a good while a job like that
it canot be done outside the good old state of connecticut
i sent it this afternoon and it came back this afternoon fernandez corrected amazingly
that wasnot rebored in guanama
but of a certainty edward
is that so astonishing
we have a gunsmith in town now pedro tells me
a nice job a very nice job
he patted the barrel which was well for he could not see the color flowing from cheeks during that minute which followed
girton was doing some staring of his own too and now with a jerk hemmett was himself again and however brief the call he was moving toward the door
well i just dropped in to see if carmen had left that second volume of jean christophe over here he said in a slightly strained voice and i remember now that its on my desk not starting tomorrow
the day after edward
will you not sit and smoke
not now thanks er something in that book i want to show steve
good night
not to the entrance of the house but straight down the corridor to the rear he led steve girton and there he clutched his arm and all but hissed did you get it
you think the job was done in a regulation gun factory
it couldnot have been done anywhere else in the world steve got a secret gun factory in puerto carlo and a dandy
and yet ostensibly you can hardly have a hammer repaired in this town and this is no crazy secret factory of the guanaman government either because we donot need one
we have nineteen thousand more rifles than we have men and here you
is pedro in the house
the darkskinned native maid bobbed her head and hurried off
mr hemmett with another of this evenings efforts straightened up and shed some of his outward excitement he had all but accomplished his lazy smile when the dapper little native servant appeared
that gun of senor fernandez pedro
hemmett said
where did you have it fixed got one tfcat i want rebored
the gun senor
but yes came in liquid spanish
i took it to my cousin agustin zaro senor who labors in the national engine works
he it was who did the work
in the national engine works
hemmett demanded
yes senor but as to the other the gun of yourself senor i do not know
there was trouble of a sort about this one i think
i gave no heed to the mouthings of agustin for he has ever been a silly fellow senor but there was trouble about his having done the work
still i will inquire senor
for a dollar or two perhaps it can be accomplished
well donot donot bother if it is likely to make trouble for your cousin hemmett answered in a husky voice that tried hard to be careless all pedro
the man glided away
breathing hard hemmett led the way back to the terrace of his own beautiful home and now it was no amused girton that he faced
was it all imagination steve
hemmett asked
is there something afoot in this town and this country that has gone clear over our heads
does the presence of an arms factory practically owned by that european nation mean anything
anything or nothing perhaps but and our new navy steve
hemmett went on almost wildly as fact after fact rose up before him in the illumination of this startling evening
the new battle cruiser almiranta out there in the harbor why do they object to people going aboard her
why is that boat and others of the new boats supposedly bought as secondhand junk so infernally modern as to lines
why why is all of it
girton laughed shortly
i donot know but i do know this its time to have a look at the national engine works at close range
can we manage it
can any one stop us if we sneak down there at night tonight even the late secretary of war asked
you know not exaggerating the thing yet
but if any european nation is establishing a base of armament here with the united states just a little way north ned it was too absurd perhaps
he could not say it old monroe in a fair way to be blown into a million pieces finished hemmett for him thickly in the darkness utterly peaceful surrounded by every manifestation of civilization and wealth and placid prosperity girton and hemmett stood aghast
seconds passed before girton was capable of not impossible
guanama owes too much to the united states to sell her out like that
such a thing couldnot be carried on secretly and it has been so far and heres another point look at the way prominent americans have been getting out lately
carter had an offer from new york a native combine bought out business and he went back to chicago with the whole force britt traded his interests for others in panama and made fifty thousand dollars and gone and morton and fowler
and were here
yes were here and beginning to think that were not guanamans voice thickened suddenly and shook a little beginning to think that were americans after all steve because the very thought of what this forlorn little hole of a country is trying to put over on the united states makes me so damned furious he caught himself but there was another breathing hard just beside him
stephen girton would have spoken several seconds sooner but for the peculiar clogging of his throat
when he did speak it was very quietly go and see the national engine works now he said grimly
one disadvantage of popularity is that one doesnot wander about without attracting attention
to step from home to the motor would have been simple and conspicuous
they conferred very briefly on this point and made their decision and each of them thrilled a little for stealing out in the old khaki taking back streets and back roads to the national engine works savored strongly of the good old days before prosperity came when the blood moved fast and ones wits now and then were all that stood between one and the hereafter
carmen hemmett fortunately enough for she did not approve of adventure that involved her husband was occupied with callers of her own
the chatter of girls the tinkle of the piano came from the drawingroom when hemmett shabby in the clothes of their engineering days and with his automatic pistol in his pocket for the first time in months stole down the back stairs to wait for steve girton
he had kissed his beloved boy good night and yes be it admitted that mr hemmett felt a bit odd
he was coming back in an hour or two of course
and really nothing would happen
and now that the first shock had passed he half expected to find that they had been making a mountainrange out of an undersized molehill
they would discover that the national engine works was harmless and he turned to girton
ready he asked go out the back way around and down the alley behind the garages once were down the hill it ll be easy enough to keep in the dark spots
right said girton whose jaw was set understood that were going into that engine works before we quit
i think it is
march said the retired secretary of war
side by side closing the door very softly they stepped into the gloom
side by side they hurried past home with its soft lights and its marble reaches and then downhill into the less opulent quarters of puerto carlo
and it was gratifying to note that in their old togs they drew little attention from the casual night prowler they were to all intents adventurous derelicts of the type which drifted into guanama often enough and drifted out again
now they had passed the town altogether and were on the barren stretch destined some day to be an attractive suburb that lay between the outskirts of puerto carlo and the bulk of the national engine works looming big and black at the end of the wretched dirt road
four keen eyes peered through the pitchy blackness as they trudged along and could see nothing
puerto carlo wasted no electricity in this section but there were weird tales of sentries who shooed the general public from the vast factory shooting before they hailed
the tales were the product of the native mind of course but halt said a voice directly in their path
its owner had come from nowhere but he was there and with a flashlight and a rifle
more he seemed puzzled as the light flared into their faces
his voice grew respectful
it is not permitted to pass this point senores
we it is not permitted to pass this point senor
i have strict orders
unfortunate was it for the unknown that edward hemmett had been meditating hotly these last minutes upon the trick guanama seemed about to play on his own united states
there was a swish and the flashlight went into the air to shine upon the grass a dozen yards away
there was a thud and a stifled yell and then not a sound until did you knock him out
girton asked interestedly
i think so
i have him here and hes limp hemmett announced from the ground tying his hands with the handkerchief from my neck
jam yours down his beastly throat and make it fast steve the talk
has he a belt
made of rope eh
so much the better
this ll do for his legs
it was well for their reputations that no arc lamp shone upon their feat
three minutes more and an unconscious man was lying with his closed eyes to the stars gagged and bound and the march to the national engine works was on again silently as before and a little more grim because the stories of exaggerated precaution had been true and the significance was sinister
their eyes peered the more keenly and their steps grew light and cautious as they came to within a bare fifty yards of the towering wooden fence that enclosed the works
behind that fence wideawake men were moving about for the sound of voices came distinctly through the night
machinery of some sort was running too at a considerable distance
and over there was a little gateway in the boarding for they could see a faint rectangular outline of light and past it back and forth a sentry paced
not that gate for us breathed hemmett sneak along this way and look for another
i wonder if we dare go any closer have to girton whispered
we look over there another entrance ned
there was at least another outlined rectangle and before this one no figure moved
reaching it meant stealing along for three hundred feet and then advancing directly upon the gate and if the sentry in this case chanced to be beside the gate and alert the expedition had reached its end
still now that they were within sixty or seventy feet no hail had come
they crouched and moved onward and through the night came a gentle snore
twenty seconds and they were beside the sleeper and he snored on
this sentry at least was typically guanaman for he slumbered at the post of duty hand was already upon the knob of the little wooden door
the thing opened freely and before them lay black shadows with the white light of arclamps on the mighty open space beyond
they had entered the national engine works
beside them loomed a wooden building faintly illuminated with windows well above their heads
they gazed up at the nearest and with a quick nod hemmett bent forward and braced hands on knees while girton more after the fashion of an acrobat than a retired secretary of war clambered to his broad back and stood erect
he was down again within half a minute snarling under his breath settled the status of the national engine works first crack he whispered the shop where they finish the stocks for army rifles
there must be two thousand of them in sight standing in racks while the varnish dries
two thousand
look for yourself if you like ned take your word for it hemmett muttered get up to the edge of this wall and see whats to be seen
he stole along the wooden side of the building pausing only when another foot would have found him in the white light
hat in hand he peered cautiously around down the vast yard that seemed to be the center of the establishment
men were moving about guanamans for the most part but visibly directed by at least three citizens whose blood held no latin strain whatever three citizens who despite their white skins were total strangers to a man who fancied that he knew by sight all the foreign population of puerto carlo
mr hemmett drew a deep breath
i fancy that were getting the whole story in allopathic doses steve he reported
that appears to be the main shop over there and theres a little door partly open
can we duck across without being seen
start when the chance seems good girton said simply
a minute dragged along while hemmett watched the moving figures intently sortie near at hand some far down the big yard
two minutes went and then three and quite suddenly the of richest man darted into the light with girton at his heels darted straight for the shadows of the tremendous building across the yard and vanished again in the shadows
we got away with it
hemmett breathed as he tiptoed toward the door
we skinned through by one hairs breadth because by the piper that played before moses he ended in an utterly thunderstruck gasp
girton was at his side girton with the effort of his life stifled a savage yell because there was cause enough for several yells
spread before them in the blaze of a hundred arclamps stretching hundreds of feet away the big shop lay revealed
cranes were there of gigantic proportions and from the nearest hung a length of steel yards and yards in length with the black circle of its muzzle toward them a sixinch rifle
near the opposite wall an endless line of black circles met their eyes finished unmounted fieldguns of the seventyfive millimeter type
yet the two giant lathes in the center of the shop claimed all their attention after that first dumfouqding minute one of them was empty the other beyond human question held a thing plainly impossible in guanama a fourteeninch gun of the most modern type in process of manufacture
my lord
my lord muttered girton
and every darned bit of it must have been landed in sections and at night and it must have taken months to careful this whispered his old friend
is that some one coming around the corner of the building or yes
here
duck this way
even now the shadow of the newcomer fell plainly out there in the yard and he was moving swiftly as if to investigate their own particular nook
as one they crouched low and raced toward the far side of the alleged engine works property the side that gave upon the shore of puerto carlo harbor
as one they slid to a standstill beside another of the little gates in the outer fence and while sentries might be without that figure behind carried a rifle and was still moving in their direction
he seemed uncertain still as to their presence
he paused and looked about and with his back turned to them for an instant edward hemmett pushed open the gate and stepped forth into the blacker night with girton at his heels
the gate they closed behind them without a creak
the steps within did not follow to the gate
they were safely out and halt senor or i shoot announced another of the nights black figures thrusting the muzzle of his rifle into mr ribs silent excited little laugh which had been upon lips as the gate closed behind them turned to a small wheeze
involuntarily almost he said touch him steve got me covered i i had no idea of touching him
girton reported breathlessly from a point some five yards distant
his colleague has a rifle jammed into the pit of my stomach
the sentries were talking too both at once each apparently rebuking the other for not obeying orders and shooting down any person who came through the gate in either direction
brief though the chatter it gave hemmett and girton time for some very painful thought
that they were done for seemed beyond question no establishment as large as the national engine works can keep its nature secret without very energetic measures and doubtless ether investigative minds which had passed this way had ceased to be
it was outrageous of course and incredible but so was the whole plant for that matter
yes and now the sentries had concluded that orders were orders and the barrel against ribs shook a little and the click of a cocked hammer came to his ears
edward hemmett in perhaps the tenth part of one second gathered himself for the lightning drop the lightning tackle of the invisible knees and through the gloom came the trouble
it was a sharp voice yet strangely familiar
following it another of the pocket flashlights blazed out and amazement came into the voice and a note of sharp anxiety senor hemmett
and senor girton too
you fellow
drop that rifle
the senores a torrent of spanish assailed him coming from both sentries voice shook with relief as he demanded is that luis engoro
it is luis engoro lieutenant of the guanaman navy senor the anxious voice reported
but you senores
what are you doing here where none may come
why never mind what were doing here get us out of it
girton put in as steps approached from the other side of the wall
this is no time for argument kid
remember that hemmett and i fed your whole family for six months three years ago luis
remember that hemmett and i came across with the cash for the operation that saved your life and but how can i forget senor young engoro cried agonizedly
it is that which wrings my heart because enough
come
come quickly
he was a person of some authority in this accursed neighborhood
the sentries had permitted themselves to be swallowed up in the gloom and luis engoro was reaching out toward hemmett and girton with both hands
they caught the hands and clung to them and engoro started straight down the steep bank toward the water
although it was not so very steep was it
and a very broad flight of steps had grown up since their last visit to this particular spot
above by the gateway flashlights were twinkling at intervals and voices rising in heated spanish but they did not pause to listen
engoro knew his way and even now he was leading them along a narrow little dock
and now he stopped
down here senores he whispered
it is the tender of the almiranta see
i shall put you ashore in the city
if the tender had owned an engineer he was elsewhere
engoro himself set the quiet motor to humming as they cast off
engoro at the wheel turned the little craft out into the harbor and they were safe
it had been a rather narrow squeak and not tljat either girton s brow nor was without a warm shiny film induced mainly by excitement
but they were safely away from one of the worlds big arms factories and nobody had elected to shoot after them and with every turn of the screw lurid thoughts pounded through two brains that had grown altogether too much accustomed to the peacefully conventional
week after week month after month they had fairly been sitting atop a plot of such magnitude as guanama had never known before
where it had started where it might end whither might extend its present ramifications no man could say but that it had corrupted at least one of more intelligent youth was proved by engoro s presence at that wheel and his utter silence
luis
girton said suddenly
come out with the truth
do you understand
i understand senor but it is impossible said engoro thinly
i beg of you senor that the the matter be left undiscussed
i have saved you
and were grateful luis and that doesnot alter the fact that this is one of the things that canot be left undiscussed
hemmett said firmly
you come out with the truth boy
i cannot
why not
because even for what i have done i may pay with my life answered the young man
should i speak freely who can say what will befall me
it was an astonishing statement considering that he had done no more than save the lives of two lawabiding citizens that he was a lieutenant in navy and that they were at this minute in a government tender but he meant it
he even shuddered and glanced back at them with a face that was pale in the light of the tenders lamps
steve girton rose abruptly and came to his elbow
engoro said he always liked you you know that tried to help you too and like to help you out of this
but were going to have the truth from you luis and while wete on the job you can tell it to us aboard the almiranta
i think that vessel will bear looking over about now
but sefior
engoro gasped
that too is impossible
why is it impossible
i will not lie and i cannot explain the young man said doggedly
then help you out of the predicament by leaving you no choice kid said the retired secretary of war and the muzzle of his automatic was trained suddenly on luis
you make straight for the almiranta take us aboard and show us around the ship and if you feel inclined to do anything else keep on heading for the shore and well blow your thick young head from your shoulders kick the carcass of a traitor overboard and go aboard the almiranta ourselves
what about it
the face of luis engoro turned toward him was no less than stricken
the wheel wabbled in his hands and then because luis was all guanaman after all he shrugged his shoulders philosophically and accepted the inevitable quite as girton had expected
the tender veered about and made straight for the bulk of the almiranta out near the mouth of the harbor
she was not all the visible part of navy but she was the most interesting tonight
whatever she might be it was certain that three more like her were anchored down the coast ostensibly by way of leaving more room in the harbor actually as the americans suspected more and more strongly to keep them away from interested eyes
there was something too modern about the cut of the
almiranta to jibe with her alleged status as the castoff of a foreign navy and with the low price at which guanama had bought her
past the three destroyers they sped in utter silence past the two battleships that had formed the nucleus of the new guanaman navy and on to the almiranta
at her landingstage they came to a halt a pair of able seamen came down and girton and hemmett with luis engoro between them hurried to the deck
the lieutenant had not a solitary word to say
nor was much information from him necessary once they were able to inspect the cruiser at close range
she was new
from her deckplates to her fightingmasts she was utterly new
her engines when they came upon them were of the latest and the fastest and the most powerful type
the strange trio with luis lagging hurried on to her gunrcoms
it had been announced and accepted as a matter of course that the almiranta had been purchased practically without armament
that would come another year with new appropriations
but when girton and hemmett had penetrated to the fighting section of the cruiser they grew breathless for a little
she was not unarmed she was indeed overloaded with armament
mighty batteries some mounted some ready to mount were behind those closed and rusty ports small quickfirers shining through the thick protective grease were there without end and below very deftly arranged so that they could be put into action with a scant days notice three torpedotubes modem to the minute were revealed
the magazines were not filled they were crammed
shells of the newest type were there tier on tier ready for the ingenious hoists themselves so modern that neither girton nor hemmett had ever seen their like before
they had seen too much this last quarterhour to feel great surprise at the sight rather they stood stunned for a little as the meaning of it all loomed before them
steve girton very quietly laid a hand on arm
look here kid said he you may as well talk a little now seen what we came to see in it thick arenot you
yes senor
are there many more supposedly decent intelligent boys like you in this navy
the pay is high senor luis muttered
the other cruisers down the coast are they like this
yes senor engoro whispered
all three
all eleven and the three battleships luis corrected
what
it is the truth senor and now i beg of you let me say no more the lieutenant pleaded
i owed you much seriores
i have paid this evening
but before others come to ask about why i took you from the shore will you not leave senores
to me it means life or death and there is no more to see
upon that i give you my word ask you one more question and well skip
girton ran his fingers through his hair and blinked confusedly and for the second time that night wondered if reality actually could be reality too bright to be in this thing blindly luis
you know and we know that for the first time in history a european power has established a naval base on the american side of the world and a big one
how in name it has been kept under cover for so long passes my understanding they must have bought guanama body and soup but what i want to ask you is this are there more ships of this kind coming it has been said senor engoro muttered
and if enough of them get here to handle the job it is intended to attack the united states
girton pursued
it it has been said senor that that coercion that oh go senor
engoro floundered wildly
for it has been sworn that death shall be the portion of one of us who he could get no further
girton teeth grinding gazed speculatively down at his automatic pistol
hemmett white again and with hands twitching came close to engoro
you nasty little brown rat he said rather be dead than be in your shoes
you canot understand that can you
you canot understand what the united states has done for this country for you first and last can you
you donot know what gratitude is you donot know what decency even means but you do know how to sneak up on a sleeping man or a sleeping nation and drive in a knife if you are paid eh like to kick the life out of your filthy pelt but have to kick the life out of half of guanama afterward to be consistent i suppose go engoro and in a very little time the united states will send forces down here to spoil the whole game and when that happens youll get yours
and if i can have the job of punishing you assigned to me truss you up to one of your pretty basketwork masts and leave you there till the birds pick your bones
thank you for saving our lives engoro and be damned to you
come steve
a sailorman set into motion by engoro whose legs bade fair to collapse beneath him ran them back to shore trembled incessantly as he peered about the deserted pier of the yacht club and then whirling about rowed off through the night as if the powers of evil were after the boat
it was early morning now as the two americans tramped silently uphill to the hemmett home silently because puerto carlo is largely ears even in the small hours and because each man was thinking more astonishing thoughts than the normal brain could conveniently handle
only as they came to the terrace of the still dark house did girton say softly just what is going to be the speediest way of getting busy ned sleep on it till morning hemmett answered
then well get barton the more or less gifted american minister up here lay the truth before him and have a report in washington before noon
after that its up to the united states and while that has lately been a darned sight more complacent nation than it used to be in our time i still have a suspicion that there will be something doing
the nations all right it needs waking up thats all
girton said
and i think this ll do it and whether it does it or not rather be an american hodcarrier than the president of this dirty traitorous little hole
when i think that youre engaged to a guanaman girl and married to another
hemmett laughed queerly
i hadnot thought of that the retired secretary said rather blankly
well i had and theyre no more to blame for the doings of the politicians here than the folks back home and we wonot discuss the thing over the breakfasttable by the way
daylight came before sleep reached either man
their personal world had turned upside down since eight oclock or thereabouts last evening
mentally and to some extent physically they had been settling down these last years to guanama and all that guanama implied
they had been content and prosperous and too busy with routine work to give great heed to possible plottings indeed while neither of them had harbored the concrete thought perhaps they had believed that plotting and guanama once so intimately associated were divorced for all time
ferrata was president and due for reelection like the bulk of the lawmakers guanama was a hive of industry and all was well
and now ferrata and his party had been ousted and sinister influences long at work beneath the surface were coming into full view with some of the manifestations focusing upon themselves
there could be no question that the hidden powers were more than merely anxious to see the last of them
ricoro tool or conspirator had proved it conclusively could they have but read the true significance of his offer at the time of its making
jones the incredible had proved it and both had proved that the giant fester was coming to a head
morning as a rule found both men very clearbrained but not this morning
the whole thing was too overwhelming too grotesque for assimilation even now
girton before breakfast went with his highpowered binoculars to the terrace and looked over the national engine works and the almiranta as if to assure himself that they really existed
rust was the thing mainly visible on such of the cruiser as might be seen from puerto carlo
piles of packingcases tiers of harmless lumber were all the glasses showed of the works beside roofs and walls
carmen it appeared wished to ride with the boy to an aunt in the uphill suburbs for the morning and her husband assented with a readiness that caused her to stare for a moment
she went nevertheless and before the motor was out of sight hemmett had john barton the american minister on the telephone and was fairly ordering him to report at the hemmett home
it was up to barton alone of course and they wished sincerely that he might have been a gentleman of different stamp
they looked him over as he came in a plump commonplace man not very intelligent not very well educated a political growth who had been a power in his own section and for whom some provision had to be made
the post at guanama is not quite in the class of the court of st james and its incumbents are sometimes correspondingly below what might be desired
still barton was the whole visible supply of united states authority and when they had locked the library door and arranged things so that no interested listener could well come within range without attracting attention they told their tale
john barton listened puffing out an exclamation here and there removing his glasses and polishing them at regular intervals scowling incredulously at hemmett and then at stephen girton until finally they came to the end and with a dubious glance at each other impatiently awaited his views upon the astounding situation
they came when he had stared perplexedly across the room for a long minute
i think gentlemen that you exaggerate he said heavily
does that does that mean that you donot believe what weve told you
girton demanded
i should hesitate to put it in just that way the american minister smiled tartly
i think gentlemen pardon me sure that you have seen some of these things and fancied the rest
the united states as you are perfectly well aware is on good terms with the entire world
so good as to make it impossible that any european nation should have decided to take a chance on coming over picking a fight and recapturing some of the unbelievable gold supply that has flowed into america of late years
hemmett cried
barton laughed aloud and wearily
oh but my dear sir he protested that bugaboo been laid to rest
i thought sir that the yellow journals themselves had wearied of harping on that absurd idea
but and for another thing mr hemmett the minister pursued testily operations of such magnitude as you suggest are perfectly impossible secretly at any rate
to me the idea that a gigantic naval base is forming in guanama is simply grotesque
well in spite of what does or does not strike you as grotesque you can go straight to the president of this republic and demand permission to inspect the national engine works canot you
girton asked hotly
i can assuredly
and i shall not render my office ridiculous by doing anything of the kind mr girton
i shaller report to washington all that you have told me not giving the statements as proven facts but as hearsay sir
and you will not even verify i will do what i have said sir and if my government wishes me to move further in the matter instructions to that effect will be forwarded to me as you know
pah mr girton glower like that
i know you will know when both of you are a little calmer that the whole thing is a false alarm
granted that there is a gun factory out there gentlemen
what more natural than that the guanaman government itself for reasons doubtless good and sufficient has decided to manufacture its own war munitions
and your nightmare cruiser and the fleet that is suposed to be somewhere down the coast
the reason for them stands on the very face of your recital
these guanamans raise the very dickens at the idea of their precious taxes being spent for anything but plazas and public bullrings and band concerts as you very well know
unquestionably the government is forming an efficient navy and very wisely keeping from the public the amounts spent
then you think a fake too
i think sir from your account that he was drunk
barton snapped
and please do not force me to say gentlemen that i almost suspect er ahem
we wonot because if you happened to say it it might be necessary to take a good grip on the scruff of your neck hemmett informed him
and let me say this barton believe what you like or believe nothing at all i am going to take it upon myself to report to washington direct that here he stopped because the knocking on the door had become insistent
girton answered it and came face to face with the little butler and behind the little butler stood dr cortera himself perhaps the biggest medical man in guanama and their very good and very old friend
pardon me for popping in like this
dr cortera said quickly in his easy english important the thing that brought me here
it concerns the united states and oh i didnot see you mr barton
girton was locking the door again
hemmett rose to his feet
what concerns the united states
well a a deathbed confession old man cortera answered after a little hesitation
i had rather intended telling you about it first and then going down with you to mr office if you saw fit
go on
cortera glanced keenly from one to the other then smiled grimly at barton with his bored cynical eyes
it was captain zarata he said
peritonitis got him after all and hewell he wanted to talk to me alone before he slipped away and he did
he was commander of one of the battleships before disease got him and he had a good deal on his mind that needed confessing
gentlemen dr cortera announced impressively guanama has been bought up by a nation across the atlantic
guanama from one end of the coast to the other reeks with a plot of such size as has rarely entered history
and to the best of my information and belief that nation is making guanama a base of supplies and when the base is all ready the said nation is going to hand a terrible wallop to unprepared america and the retired secretary of war turned as one and looked at the american minister
barton had been startled out of his stodgy calm at any rate he was holding the arms of his wicker chair and leaning forward scowling at dr cortera and blinking fast
the doctor for his part gazed mild astonishment at hemmett and girton
nothing ever surprises you does it he asked
this doesnot because we knew all about it last night girton said with a faint smile
leave us out of it cortera and convince barton that it is the truth told him once and he implied that we were drunk
hey
cortera exclaimed
i er implied nothing of the sort said the american minister
i was incredulous frankly incredulous and i am still incredulous
this captain doctor
was he in his right mind
could he not have been speaking in the delirium which mind was as clear as a bell up to his very last breath leading physician said incisively fool yourself at all on that count mr barton
zarata knew exactly what he was talking about and it weighed heavily on his conscience the existence of which i take it he discovered about fifteen minutes after he learned that he was at deaths door
he felt that guanama was playing the united states a pretty lowdown trick and he wanted to feel that he was doing what he could to undo the work
if the poor devil had lasted another hour have had information enough to stand our unfortunate little country up oh edge
he didnot
he had given me the main facts and had informed me that the best part of the navy and threefourths of the politicians had been corrupted with large sums of real money and he was just about to give me some names when he was called to the other world
but its all true and it all fits in with a dozen things been observing this last week or two
the whole country is honeycombed with bribery the new navy isnot at all
and the national engine works out there on the point gentlemen is yes heard about that heard about that barton said rising with growing agitation
i shall act of course
i shall act at once
how
girton asked crisply
by reporting every detail to washington in code immediately and signifying that the matter is urgent and needs instant action the american minister pursued with commendable force as he moved toward the door
i was er wrong mr girton in doubting your statements apparently
even now i cannot quite believe but i will act at once
he departed quickly
cortera shrugged his shoulders
i wish i could have kept the poor wretch this side of the styx for another hour or two he said it beat the devil what any one with money can put across in guanama
ten dollars and our plain citizen will swear himself to eternal secrecy fifty and hell murder his own brother a hundred and hell hand you a mortgage on his eternal soul
sometimes i think the whole lower class here are like a lot of defective children and well the cure for that sort of defectiveness is spanking
hemmett snapped with excusable savagery
you are not going
there is a gentleman down at the hospital who is expecting me said cortera
he must be under the ether by this time but i had to drop in and tell you first
you yourselves what are you going to do about it not the kind to sit passively and watch this kind of muddle going to do whatever we can do replied girton
if barton has waked up and rouses washington perhaps well have nothing to do old man and thanks
cortera too hurried away
for a little time hemmett and girton sat and threshed the matter out to the general end that there was really nothing to do until word had come from washington
they were apparently beginning the circle again when the telephone bell rang violently
barton said the voice at the other end
is that you mr girton
it is
do you know a man named jones sir william jones
eh met him yes
who is he
i give it up
why
jones sir said the american minister and his voice trembled jones came into this office mr girton sat on the edge of my desk laughed in my face sir and ordered me ordered me mr girton to send no report whatever to washington
and i told him to go to blazes sir and he laughed again and and threatened me
he informed me in so many words mr girton that my personal welfare would be promoted by keeping complete silence
and then helfiew some smoke in my face sir and left
i thought it best to advise you preparing my report at this minute
go to it old man chuckled the re376 tired minister as he hung up
little bill jones is on the job again ned
and somebody else is here for us stated hemmett as he hurried to the door and unlocked it and then started back for hat on the back of his head cigar in the corner of his mouth insolent smile on his lips william jones stood there all unannounced
pardon my arriving this way he said easily as he entered
the door was open and i didnot want to lose any time in getting to you gentlemen
what with one thing and another this promises to be a rather busy day and i wanted to have my little chat with you early
well be girton began be profane at any rate jones smiled
i just dropped in you know to get your final answer communicated with my folks overnight and able to offer a little added inducement
they tell me that they still feel that youre the men for the jobs and that if theres no other way of budging you i may offer you each a fifty thousand dollars bonus if youre willing to sail at one oclock
well
you said the retired secretary are the sneaking slithering agent of a railroad
jones put in quickly
never lose sight of that a railroad
and since you seem to be in a truculent mood this morning come right down to cases and cut out the pretty stuff
you two are going out of this country on the one oclock steamer with your people and with your pockets full of money or youre going to be a pair of idiots and stay here and take the consequences
get that
there was a pause in every sense dramatic
girton doubled his fists and took a step forward
hemmett laid a hand on his arm
just a minute steve he said
he wants to cut out the pretty stuff and well help him
we have to take the consequences do we jones
you certainly do
and donot be an ass hemmett
just well the first consequences well take is you stated hemmett as he gripped the gentlemans two arms
frisk him steve be carrying at least oqe gun
and then he chuckled as jones with a tremendous heave sought to wrench himself loose and failed completely and he chuckled again as steve girton drew from mr pockets a pair of automatic pistols that might have held off a mob getting right down to cases arenot we jones he asked go a little farther
open that door steve
and you if you wiggle mr jones youll get just one whack on the vulnerable spot behind the ear and after that well have to carry you
jones glanced at him over his shoulder
he was cool again and sneering
you poor clod he said pleasantly you brains enough to know that youre piling up trouble for yourself by this idiotic trick
i have not
march
where to
girton asked
out back to my nice new stone garage said hemmett
that has a good look on the outside let jones cool off for a while and then decide whats coming to him
he was a curious citizen
instead of resisting he stepped along jauntily accepting the situation as if it had not been just what he expected
he smiled too he seemed to be laughing somewhere inside and now the door of the garage was open with only the runabout in sight and hemmett sent the gentleman within and slammed the door
just why did we do that
girton inquired when they were again in the library
i wanted to put him where hed be accessible when weve had a chance to consider his case hemmett explained with a half smile
upon my word steve that cuss with his assurance and his billiondollar talk makes me feel queer at the bottom of the whole thing and its all so big that i havenot quite comprehended it even yet
that man is the most dangerous enemy the united states has in all guanama
leaning back in his favorite chair gnawing his cigar he gave five minutes to a contemplation of the bookshelves eventually to sit erect and shrug his shoulders with third degree i guess
what
it isnot nice of course but i donot know that jones demands any consideration steve
he has the eye of a physical coward too and somehow after weve hammered him around that garage for a little i believe hell be in shape to confess all he knows
and then
then we lock him up in the garage again my boy and send a new report to washington
oh its bizarre and unlawful and all that sort of thing i understand that much perfectly
but were americans after all steve and for the sake of the united states i think its the proper caper smiled mr hemmett and gazed affectionately at his own brawny fist
come along old man
be it admitted that stephen girton did not seek to stay him with protests
stephen flexed his own hands and sighed lightly and thus they advanced upon the illstarred william jones all unaware of the elemental forces he had unleashed and which were about to alter his physical appearance and perhaps his mental state as well
when this door opens said mr hemmett as he slipped the key into the lock he is due to make a dive straight out that way
stand there steve and grab him
mr girton bent forward alertly
the door slid back and mr pose was unaltered
nor after several seconds had he gripped mr jones
and now the door was wide open and the interior of the garage was visible even to the seat of the runabout and while the garage held a pretty little american car and several kinds of grease and a workbench and tools and a rack for the light robes it gave no indication whatever that william jones existed on earth occurred to hemmett that william jones was hiding in the runabout ready to make a dash for freedom
he crouched therefore and covered the two yards with a queer little spring he reached over the dashboard with both hands and clutched a quantity of guanaman air
he isnot there i could have told you that been able to look across the car since i stood outside girton said somewhat faintly
but we but we locked him up here
hemmett stammered
we certainly did and just as certainly he is not locked up here now ned the retired secretary agreed stand there with your mouth open like that
ramon is watching you from the house
well if ramon has his eye this way perhaps mr hemmett began
the butler was approaching his small dark countenance lined with perturbation
he came to the garage itself and bobbed his head respectfully
there is something wrong he asked
he was after all not the chauffeur of the sefior
what
ay de mi
the fault is mine the butler confessed emotionally
he came but to steal yet because of his splendid clothing i have thought that he was as he said the new chauffeur of the sefior
what did he do ramon
hemmett asked with some difficulty
he did but come to the kitchen sefior and ask most courteously for the key to the garage five minutes back
he said that sanchez because of his inso378 lence had been dismissed and that he had been engaged
he requested the key that he might secure the can of heavy grease and he returned the key within one minute senor
yet see
because the fault is mine let what he has stolen be taken from my wage senor for i see oh shut up
hemmett said wearily
the escape could have been a little simpler perhaps had william jones paused to remove the garage lock and drop it into his pocket as he entered
william own man had had his instructions and had executed them with neatness and despatch it seemed almost as if william jones had expected to find himself locked in the garage and issued orders accordingly ahead of time
but whether that was the case or the man had simply been waiting had seen his employer imprisoned and had taken the quickest means of getting him out again jones was gone
and the point of it is just this hemmett said bitterly as he picked up his telephone in the library jones got loose because he or his man acted quick steve
that seems to be the keynote of all his performances to move like lightning and hang trying to conceal anything
why all that socalled engine works property was bought in the open and nobody thought anything of it
and the guanama navy bills were jammed through the senate in the open and nobody thought any thing of it
and now his agent walks straight into my kitchen and demands the garage key and gets it because ramon couldnot see anything unusual in the stunt and give me police headquarters
hemmett wound up disgustedly
he waited tapping his foot and purposely avoiding the rather sheepish smile which came to face as he pondered the latest flitting of jones
he snapped headquarters
give me domez the chief of detectives
hello
domez
this is mr hemmett
ah
the pleasure senor to serve one so august floated over the wire
cut the joy stuff retorted hemmett
domez theres a man in town named william jones a man who has the whole third floor of the new hotel and drives around town in a white automobile
you know him eh
well 1fti glad of it
catch him and bring him to me
but but the charge
domez stammered attend to the charge and protect you if he makes trouble said the american worry about that part of it
get him
but it is told senor that the senor jones is a man of great wealth and influence the chief replied dubiously
it is related so am i a man of great wealth and influence barked mr hemmett bitterly
i had enough of both to get you your present job domez and enough of both left to take it away from you
not that asking you to do anything crooked you understand
if you round up jones guanama ll be handing you medals a year from now
but get him
if it be possible senor
domez agreed somewhat faintly and hung up
it was the last that caused hemmett to curse aloud for like many other recent happening that trick of hanging up the receiver was almost beyond belief
domez these many years had been the soul of respect not to say adoration
domez at the slightest word of either girton or hemmett had been in the habit of leaping at the task of the moment and now without a string of compliments and assurances without so much as an apology domez had cut off the conversation
if it didnot seem so confounded silly say that domez himself was in pay
mr hemmett announced
followed the daylong lull
they were at liberty if they chose to tear about town in search of jones themselves
they were at liberty to go to the new president of guanama and state the case and demand action they did neither
for one thing the latter job was exclusively for another the visit was like to prove a sheer waste of time
deeper than any other man in guanama perhaps in this gigantic plot would be jose altara president of the country
there had been much talk of fraud just after his election and curiously enough it had been only talk
the papers with a unanimity never before in evidence had assured all guanama that not a single doubtful vote for altara had been cast and the light of recent events was shining strongly on those papers this morning as hemmett and girton discussed the situation
it might seem farfetched yet either would have been willing to bet a portion of his wealth that not a newspaper in the country was actually owned by a guanaman now
carmen and the boy returned for luncheon and it was a rather silent meal the air surcharged with suspense the lovely young mrs hemmett asking questions with her eyes but not with her tongue the boy prattling with the cheerful irresponsibility of the threeyearold and for the first time since last evening drawing attention from the crisis in affairs and those of the united states
he was a wonderful kid that edward jr
hemmett still affirmed the fact to stephen girton not less than four times daily
he had the brainpower of a savant he made remarks which for sheer wit and wisdom probably excelled any other remarks since children have been
toward three they wandered down to the american minister and found him in a distressed state
barton had reported to washington and was still awaiting a reply
he had also in a fit of energy gone straight to altara and according to his own account confronted him flatly and ferociously with treachery
the upshot of the interview had been apparently that altara had exclaimed in amazement had denied all knowledge of anything of the kind had assured the representative of the great united states that an instant investigation should be set afoot and the plotters shot as soon as they might be captured and in the next breath had informed barton unqualifiedly that none would be found because none existed
following this altara had slapped his chest and delivered a short oration as to the eternal fidelity of guanama to america and when he left even john barton had understood that president was lying at high speed
evening was drawing near and still no reply had come
hemmett and girton having tired of watching barton bite his nails of hearing him call up the cableoffice to learn that no official message was on the wire eventually walked back to their home
they were in for a quiet night apparently perhaps they were in for a quiet sue months or a year
outwardly the international affairs of the united states were calm and pleasant and trouble of this kind cannot be forced in a minute
then too the eventual staggering move would mean troops doubtless to be moved as quietly as possible from europe to guanama and thence north when the time came
true they might mean to move directly across the atlantic but it was all a little way in the future
having readjusted their minds to the trouble that was brewing hemmett and girton were almost themselves again as they climbed the white steps to the hemmett home
and then leaving the state where it involved millions of human beings the mystery centered suddenly on the house itself
hemmett was even laughing when a shrill cry came from the direction of the garage lately the prison of william jones
he brought up short he turned to girton and found the latter suddenly white
was that the kid he gasped the kid and hes hurt
girton replied leaping to the side of the house and the runway to the garage stopping short then as hemmett slid to his side
look
look
he pointed with his left hand fumbling wildly for his pistol with the right
he had left it upstairs that morning and he ceased fumbling and collided with the house itself as hemmett dashed past
for the boy was there in the arms of a lithe little guanaman who had paused misguidedly to try thrusting a cloth into the childs mouth
wild with terror edward jr was beating at him with both little pink fists turning his curly head from side to side kicking and again managing to scream for help
and now in the second or so that followed the scream his captor was turning to the father and looking straight into his eyes and since all guanama knew of pistolaim since the automatic in hand was descending swiftly to shooting position he would drop the boy and seek to save his own life or no he had no intention of dropping the boy after all
with a tiger bound he made for the side of the garage and the boy was held high between his own body and hemmett
and his heart must lie squarely between the pinksocked legs he clutched
edward hemmett turned to frozen steel fired and closed his eyes
a dragged along and still hemmett could not force his eyes to look
once upon a time he would have wagered an even hundred dollars against a nickel on his chances of hitting a penny at that range now for two years at least he had fired hardly a shot
and if he had missed the mark this time a new scream of fright opened his eyes
he drew breath with a gasp and dashed forward and already girton had the boy in his arms and was soothing him and asking him if he was hurt and feeling over the round little body
you you didnot touch him thank god he quavered
are you sure
are you sure
steve give him to me
hemmett mouthed frantically as he snatched the boy
sonny
dad didnot hit you
does it hurt anywhere sonny
are you sure it doesnot neddy
are you sure
tell dad
another shriller scream was coming from the house carmen this time hemmett gripped himself and held the boy a little tighter
your guanaman girl has hardly conquered hysteria as yet although carmen held remarkable selfcontrol for one of her blood his own calm was very essential just now and he even contrived to smile as his beautiful wife sped to his side all right little girl he said all right
the kid isnot hurt
give him to me
give him to me cried the mother as die turned shudderingly from the sight just beyond
that man that oh
and now the younger edward hemmett was in her arms and she sobbed over him while girton rose to his feet after a very brief conclusive inspection of the mistaken individual who had turned abductor
this was farewell appearance as a kidnaper he said grimly stone dead
and better that he had died by torture
carmen cried surprisingly
for he sought to steal my baby and there there her husband put in himself decidedly whiter
whatever it was it is all over now child
take the boy in and get out of this yourself carmen
and you for killing him what will they do to you
they wonot do much of anything to me my dear hemmett said grimly have to leave him here for the police steve
come
tell ramon to cover him
he led the way into the house and girton followed also decidedly jarred
mr hemmett having seen his family on the way upstairs returned to the telephone and demanded speech with the chief of detectives you is it domez he inquired
well this is mr hemmett once more
domez a man just tried to kidnap my boy and i shot him dead
i want his body out of here inside of fifteen minutes and after that at your service whenever you need me
what
no i understand that youll make things simple for me if i have witnesses and got em
and another thing domez
i donot think as much of you or this country as i did twentyfour hours ago and i want to tell you candidly that if any one else tries anything of this kind on me going to hold you personally to account
yes that means just what it says
he pushed away the instrument with a little shudder and rose go and see how getting on steve he said
you attend tothe matter out there
it had been attended to before hemmett returned oddly attended to for that matter
the motor patrolwagon bellmuffled had whisked around from the hill police station and directly up the drive to the garage with scant ceremony the misguided guanaman had been loaded aboard
after that the suave officer who accompanied the vehicle took stephen girton aside and much as if a favor had been done to the force itself and to himself in particular smilingly informed him that since no attention had been attracted from the street the matter might be considered closed
it was very very puzzling
in guanama when a shooting has taken place little police officials are wont to swarm over the entire landscape waving hands taking notes and photographs questioning everybody summoning everybody threatening everybody and assuring everybody that the criminal will not only be found but also drawn and quartered
this unfortunate affair twenty minutes after the shot might never have happened
so stephen girton informed his friend when he reappeared frowning sorry
hemmett muttered
it gives me the shakes to think about it but what else was there to do
the first thing that flashed on me was that this was more of work steve that he was taking the boy to hold for ransom and i shot and the way the police have acted bears it out too
perhaps perhaps not more inclined to think that the man was operating on his own hook and his teeth clicked together he listened attentively
there was a disturbance outside and the chattering of excited tenor and now steps came toward the room and barton wildeyed hatless burst in upon them
gentlemen
gentlemen he cried
the the devil is in this town
the my wife gentlemen happened
girton asked quickly
barton tottered into a chair
kidnaped
abducted he choked
she she is gone
gone where
god man
do you suppose be sitting here if i knew that the american minister cried
she went for a ride with her friend mrs halliday you know the woman
they stopped at one of the big shops downtown i believe and mrs halliday went in to get something
she was just coming out when when it happened
the shooting was quite forgotten
girton on one side hemmett on the other they came close to barton as the latter choked on it it would seem mrs halliday was greatly excited it would seem that another automobile drove up beside the one in which mrs barton sat gentlemen
everything must have been prearranged for she says that three men stepped out at once and into the halliday car
they threw a blanket or something of the sort over mrs barton and lifted her bodily into their own machine and it was speeding away before any one could raise a hand
the retired secretary looked at his friend
barton gazed wildly from one to the other
what shall i do gentlemen he cried stand there like that
my wife you understand my wife we understand perfectly barton hemmett said quietly
my boy all but got th same dose
i was lucky enough to shoot the fellow who had him
has anything of the sort been threatened
no nor dreamed of
have you been having trouble with any one barton
mr hemmett i am positive that i havenot made an enemy since i came to this hellhole
nor mrs barton
why positively afraid of the native element
barton cried have to charge it up to jones i think
you believe that the man is so utterly abandoned as to attack women and children
barton gasped and it was noteworthy that his faith in estimate of the jones character seemed to have increased since their last meeting not quite sure what i think hemmett confessed coming a little too fast for me but here
give me that telephone
police headquarters again
he waited impatiently until the click came from the other end of the line then domez
yes its hemmett again
domez have you found jones yet
senor in all puerto carlo there is no trace of the senor jones the chief of detectives informed him smoothly a lie and i think you know it
listen domez
the wife of the american minister has been kidnaped
yes you may well gasp
what
well i donot know how youre going to find her but i do know that if you donot find her youll have an american fleet shelling puerto carlo inside of a week
what
well domez well put it in another way then
if you havenot returned that lady to her home before midnight youll reckon with me and the same gun that killed the fellow who tried to get my boy
think it over
this time it was mr hemmett who hung up the receiver unexpectedly but there was no anger in his face as he turned back to them
instead the slight pallor had returned and eyes were undeniably round
i canot make it out he said
unless domez himself is in the very thick of the thing i canot make it out
by all precedents he ought to have howled and protested when i talked to him that way and instead he had the cold nerve to tell me that if the american fleet turned up looking for trouble it was likely to get all it came after
fact cried girton
almost word for word
but my wife gentlemen gasped the agonized barton
what of her
what did he say
what shall we do shoulders squared as he considered the unfortunate gentleman his round face fishwhite and wet with perspiration his collar wilted and his hands twitching incessantly
he said that he would start men out at once of course he replied quietly
that may mean everything or nothing
as to what well do barton well get out and start the grand hunt for mrs barton ourselves
and i want to tell you that so far this country hasnot succeeded in putting over anything on girton and me
when we start for mrs barton well bring her back in good shape or well have half this town shot to flinders tell mrs hemmett that shes going over to her fathers with the boy
fernandez is alert enough when hes roused to danger he can shoot straight and there are at least two men servants over there who can be trusted implicitly which is rare in this town just now be down in about five minutes and well start
breathing hard he climbed the stairs to the quiet upper floor
now and then even in guanama things grow too utterly outrageous and this was surely one of the times
that the younger edward hemmett had all but fallen victim to the abductor was bad enough but at least that stunt had bfeen nipped in the bud
when it came to abducting the middleaged wife of the middleaged and ostensibly important american minister however in the open business street yes that was carrying the thing altogether too far
mr hemmett paused at his room to slip a fresh box of cartridges into his pocket paused at room to secure that gentlemans automatic and then entered his wifes bedroom maid sat there half asleep as usual while the boy a little paler but even now settled down to a picturebook sat on the floor beside her
the senora
hemmett said briefly
in the boudoir senor
the senoras husband scowled about the room she finished dressing for dinner
not yet senor
she is but half dressed the maid droned
she stepped into the boudoir for her diamond comb i think
she is still there
still eh
how long has she been there
these fifteen minutes senor the maid informed him placidly
mr hemmett crossed to the closed door and tapped it briskly
there was no response
he tapped again
still no sound came from beyond the portal
carmen called hemmett
only silence answered him
and his skin crawled suddenly he could feel his hair rising
not of course that anything could have happened to carmen upstairs in her own home but husband opened the door suddenly and stepped into the boudoir
it was empty
over there a broken chair lay in three pieces upon the floor and over there was one of huge cutglass toiletwater bottles upside down in the corner and unbroken
yes and here was the torn fragment of a silk petticoat and here again was one of the combs she had worn that afternoon trampled to bits
and the door of the big closet was open and several garments were upon the floor pitched about in wildest confusion as if a violent struggle had drawn them from their hangers
and the farther door which led to the corridor and the back stairs stood wide open
but of carmen hemmett herself there was no sign at all upon a time in a railroad camp just east of the rockies the sevenfoot camp bully had sought to impress his will upon edward hemmett who chanced to be in charge
they still talk about the battle out that way as one of the liveliest twoman affairs ever staged when it was finally over friends had carried the big man down to the creek and bathed his brow for something like an hour before he returned to life but at one period the outcome had been in doubt for the giants fist had landed directly between edward two eyes
as concerned mr hemmett the entire universe had bounced upward about three inches and settled back again with a soulshaking slam and for the second time in his life he experienced the same sensation as he stood in the center of boudoir
his fists turned to ice were clenched but useless at his sides
his head whirled crazily he could feel his whole body swaying ridiculously for second after second
then blood began to flow again and hemmett bounded at the open closet
she simply could not be gone
there had been a fight of some kind in here probably with one of the servants because servants in guanama are as prone to do the unexpected as so many dynamite bombs
and she must have fainted into that closet or no she wasnot in the closet
hemmett had dived down and both hands had covered the floor in three seconds and again the crazy reeling attacked his brain
and as quickly the reeling left
this was no time for hysterics
if the mysterious blight had fallen upon his own wife it was the moment of all his existence ripest for quick action
mr hemmett conquering the wild glare of his eye the tendency of his voice to rise in a shout went back to the door of the bedroom and beckoned the maid
it was a gesture so odd that she obeyed instantly and when the door had been closed behind her and the younger edward could not see hemmett gripped both the girls arms and clutched her so energetically that his fingers drove into the soft flesh
your mistress
where is she
quick
she she is not here the girl cried wildly
no and you know it
what happened in here her employer snarled
talk hear
talk or wring your neck
but senor the frightened girl protested faintly
i do not know
i have but waited for the senora
see
as you found me sitting so have i been sitting since the senora closed this door this i swear
at at one time it seemed to me that i heard a fall but i called and there was no answer
it was not for me senor to go and open a door which this fall when did you hear it
not five minutes back senor
one of her arms mr hemmett flung away from him the other he gripped the tighter and dragged the girl across toward the corridor door
you come with me he panted
i think youre lying but you come with me
quite unaware of her gaspings and stumblings he made for the back stairs and down them to the main floor
there was a little foyer here with the kitchen and the storerooms at the sides the corridor to the body of the house just behind and the back door just ahead and while it had been edward hemmett s intention to turn into the kitchen and summon every oily smirking servant in the place he halted at the open door
part of the story at least lay out this way
on the concrete pavement was the companion to the broken comb upstairs on the pavement too lay a little torn strip of ermine fur
it was not perhaps the only bit of ermine in guanama but it was one of a very few and as certainly as if he had seen it torn away hemmett knew that the white fragment had come from the wide collar of operacloak
his very breath seemed to stop
subconsciously up to this very moment he had been trying to assure himself that the confusion above was merely accident that carmen had stepped downstairs on some perfectly conventional errand now that last foolish little hope had departed and hemmett pushing the girl from him was out in the air and looking around wildly
there was nothing whatever to be seen pavement was there and the garden beyond and the stone garage open but never a sign of carmen
he wheeled about causing the maid to scream faintly and crouch into a corner as he passed he dashed at the door of the only model kitchen in guanama and through it
amid white tiles and copper pots only the fat elderly elenida was visible and she as he noted dizzily sat in a chair and rocked whining the while
what what hemmett choked
what the devils the matter with you
ramon gone senor
and evil comes to this house for gone where
in the automobile the white automobile the woman chattered
and i know that evil comes to this house senor for the gift has been given me to know when these things are to come
my mother senor was one of seven find that gift has some redhot personal application to yourself if you donot calm down her employer said savagely as he shook her
stop that howling and tell me what has happened
what white automobile
where was it
why did ramon go in it
how is it given to me to say that senor the woman choked
see
it came this milkwhite wagon of the devil and stopped behind the house out there senor
the eversneaking listening ramon laughed as it came senor and sped away as if possessed running up the stairway
after that i do not know
there was a struggle of some kind just overhead i think and then upon the stairs a sound of feet and after that the white wagon went senor swiftly as the wind with ramon sitting beside the driver
and your senora somewhere else in the car
hemmett forced himself to say
the senora
the womans eyes rolled in scared amazement
i do not know senor
they carried something i think
there were two men in the back one a white man the other a mighty brown man i have never seen before
i have spoken senor
i know no more but the gift was given me early to know when evil was about to befall those who edward hemmett had left her personal maid where was she
he looked up and down the corridor he raced back to the open air and to the side of the house
he saw her fleeing just turning into the back street
but at least she carried nothing and his heart bounded in momentary relief for an instant an overwrought mind had assured him that even in these few seconds the maid had secured young edward
straight upstairs he went without drawing breath through the boudoir and into the bedroom
the boy still sat there with his book and hemmett snatched him up and held him fast as he made for the main stairway down this and into the room below where barton sat and wrung his hands and girton spoke what were intended for soothing reassuring words ready to start mr hemmett the american minister cried
mr girton says that my wifes gone too
hemmett exploded
carmen cried girton
snatched out of this house while we were talking in this very room husband told them ask me how it happened steve it did happen
ramon the little devil must have raced upstairs and thrown her operacloak over her head and carried her down to own car evidently with jones himself in it
he laughed insanely at the sight of face
and kill jones and kill ramon and kill every other dirty little guanaman that ever took a penny of money or hush
hush
hemmett fairly screamed
good god steve you any conception of what it means to have ones wife stolen and yes a darned better conception than you think girton said
better than i might have had myself six months ago ned youre going to leave the boy over with his grandfather
yes
then telephone mercedes and have her come up there with her parents
her fathers a pretty old man and they havenot a man servant on the place under sixty or so
it may be silly but i canot help it
then telephone her and donot wait here till she arrives
hemmett snapped
i understand but times too precious now to waste one minute
he scowled as the telephonebell rang
he would have liked to snatch girton from the room and out on the chase and he snapped his fingers impatiently as the retired secretary of war picked up the instrument and called mr home
girton speaking
well
then while barton gnawed his fingernails and hemmett gave over his fingersnapping and tried to soothe his little son to still the frightened weeping that had come with these last few minutes and to answer evasively the questions about mother and where she had gone mr girton listened impatiently for the first five seconds mouth opening through the next cheeks whitening steadily through another five
and having listened so long he whirled upon barton and hemmett
mercedes he shouted
ned mercedes
what is it steve got her too taken mercedes
hemmett the gift for swift thinking was temporarily numbed
mercedes he repeated almost stupidly
you donot mean girton pale and panting was chattering at the telephone again
go on
go on he said
yes listening
what
see here tesoro waste one second in weeping
yes shes your daughter but if you knew what she means to me
yes pardon me
i understand
go on please
mrs barton has been taken the same way and carmen too
he ground his teeth as the diaphragm clattered frantically for a little and then it stilled and his white face grew more tense
girton nodded thrice listened again and finally rang off with a groan the same thing he reported wildly
it must have been all worked out in the finest detail beforehand
mercedes and her parents were coming up here for dinner you know forgotten it
hemmett confessed
so had for that matter
it seems according to her father that she was all dressed and ready even to that fuzzy white operacloak of hers
her mother wasnot quite ready and mercedes went into the garden and was walking around when his forced calm broke for a moment
what else
what else
hemmett cried impatiently
she she was down near the foot of the place ned and her father happened to be looking that way from his window
he says that there wasnot one seconds warning of what was coming that he saw no sign of an automobile coming into the back street or anything of the kind
that big latticed gate at the bottom of the garden opened and two men shot in threw something over the poor little kid and carried her out bodily to the white automobile that was waiting
he says that before he could even get breath enough to shout the thing was gone and when he went down there as fast as he could go the little policeman who was just coming up the street vowed that no white car had passed hear ned
even the uniformed police i hear hemmett answered grimly and with a calm that had come suddenly to him
barton was on his feet
and now let us start gentlemen he cried
in the name of heaven let us start and edward hemmett laid a hand upon his arm and smiled a smile so awful that barton gulped and dropped back limply
mr barton well start just as soon as we see what were starting after said hemmett been thinking pretty hard this last minute or two and it seems to me that perhaps a frenzied rush is just what is expected of us and the last thing to do
the impulse yours mine is to tear out and kill everything in sight
but mr hemmett just a minute up against something here thats looking bigger to me every minute
in half an hour our wives and sweetheart have been abducted in broad daylight and theyre all women of prominence and way up in guanama circles
ordinarily a stunt like that would be enough to start a revolution and the fact that theyve gone about it so brazenly must mean that everything has been arranged for ahead of time
if were to get those women back unharmed wits ll have to do the job
but youre not going to stand here and deliver an oration about it until theyve been girton began am not
hemmett corrected sharply picking up his little son again am going to take neddfe over to his granddad and rouse fernandez steve
meanwhile you call up the barracks and get brother colonel fernandez
you want him here
if the second cavalry is as absolutely right and as absolutely loyal as it has been since i put it together i want him to come up here with a full troop and stand guard on all four sides of his fathers house
that ll take you about two minutes
then call up domez and tell him that i want him here at once
i want domez personally steve and
i want him here by the time returned from one arm around the boy the other hand on the butt of his automatic hemmett strode out
the street was perfectly placid as he crossed
the hour of the siesta was long over now and earlydining guanamans of the better class were strolling out on their way down to the plaza and the evening promenade and band concert
they stared at mr hemmett and his fierceness as they saluted him and for a moment it seemed that none of the recent nightmare could have taken place and then he was confronting his fatherinlaw and barking forth the first words of the awful news and the spell was on again
fernandez did not collapse neither did he scream or wring his hands for fernandez owned a certain solidity that had gone a long way toward making him the richest man in guanama
rather he paled and listened quietly broke forth for a moment in a torrent of dreadful promises for the man who had taken his younger daughter then controlled himself and bade hemmett speed away and have no fear for the boy
feeling the tiniest shade of relief on one count at least hemmett raced back to his home
the kids coming with his entire regiment i take it girton reported
he had bugles blowing before he rang off
domez
he said he would speed here on the wings of the wind but he didnot seem enthusiastic about it give him five minutes hemmett announced glancing at his watch
i have a notion that we can learn something from him but its not worth waiting longer than that on the chance
you see domez hello
somebody else calling eh
he picked up the telephone
this is hemmett
well
this is jones said the voice at the other end
well
you
you damned hound i the time to stop that sort of tommyrot is right now mr hemmett the voice interrupted and even in the surge of fury that was upon him hemmett recognized the razoredged quality of the tone
i am a patient man you know
i have tried to be very reasonable and liberal with you hemmett and with girton and it was really quite useless
are you calmer now
can you listen quietly to a little proposition do you think
what
there
that sounds much better
mr jones assured him
the proposition is this mr hemmett we wish you to leave the country you and yours
really we do and its no reflection at all upon yourselves
we wish it dp you understand and what we wish we have as a rule
now the very pleasant and satisfactory way to conclude this matter the very obliging way so far as i am concerned it seems to me would be for you and mr girton and mr barton and the several ladies concerned to leave guanama this evening on a yacht which i shall provide and which will take you to the isthmus and leave you there
jones oh please the voice said playfully go farther have a man aboard who will hand you every penny of the splendid sum i promised hemmett who will even take your signature to the contracts which i mentioned providing handsomely for your next ten years
as man to man i ask you if any one could do more
if any one who has been treated as you have treated me would do as much
do you accept
no roared hemmett
and then listen and donot waste your breath yelling because youll need it all for weeping mr jones pursued and the change in his voice was as remarkable as had been the change in his expression during their interview an ass a poor stubborn halfwitted dolt hemmett
a man tries to treat you white and you bawl and bellow at him and let it go at that going to be out of this country before day after tomorrow all three of you
and believe me hemmett if youre not you will receive each of you the right ear of the lady in whom he is most interested
on the morning after that you will receive each the left ear of the same lady
and after that mr hemmett oh theyre beautiful two of them at any rate
give your imagination full rein it will not overstep the probabilites believe me
the words ended in a ripple of sinister laughter
choking numb and icy from head to foot unable to part his dry hard tips edward hemmett for the moment could not believe that he heard aright
so that is really the situation and if you doubt it so much the worse for yourselves and your respective ladies the voice went on easily lost your chance at the money now poor fool i still give you the chance to save the women
do you leave this evening or do you not
you have just one minute in which to answer
and here the lips parted jones cried mr hemmett
as sure as theres a god above us i swear to you that if i pay for it with my life he ended in a sudden gasp
he jerked the receiverhook up and down
get that connection again operator
get that wire again
a minute passed and another and another
the diaphragm rattled faintly and hemmett hung up the receiver with trembling hand gone he whispered
that was jones and he has them
and he said that unless we get out of the country tonight carmen and mercedes he could not continue nor would barton let him barton on his feet was shouting then well give him what he wants go man all go and tell him that hemmett afraid its too late now hemmett managed stay barton and i promise you that if they donot kill me first have the life of one in guanama thats mixed up in this plot
it was to be sure a rather sweeping statement the size of the intrigue considered
having made it mr hemmett snatched up his hat and moved toward the door and even barton shrank from before the eyes that blazed in his bloodless countenance
yet as he turned the knob the door opened from the other side and they saw the plump elderly elenida evidently the last remaining of the household servants and behind her the thick squat figure of domez chief of detectives
he was more than merely nervous
he entered with what was meant for jauntiness and his smile was a ghastly thing to see
he bobbed his head at them and turning away after his first look into hemmett s eyes nevertheless addressed that gentleman directly you have sent for me snor
yes and now as to the ladies senor yes of a certainty the little man broke in
it is of them heaven be praised that i bring news what
it is indeed the truth
they are still to be recaptured without great effort senor
domez declaimed fervently thrusting out his hands
this has been discovered by my men senor that the ladies even now have been started on their journey to the hill country through the red haze of fury thaf enveloped the senses of all threej there was something strangely steadying in the statement of the detective chief
it was as a matter of fact the very first definite concrete bit to rise to the surface of the turmoil and hemmett at least seized upon it within the second
one stride and he had gripped the smaller domez by either shoulder his eyes were burning into own and he was saying country
which hill country
ah senor
not to that accursed region where rocks freeze the soul and never mind the poetry
where are they being taken
to the region of las almas senor where once the senor s great army was in training
there senor are the esteemed the suffering senoras the lovely senorita to be taken
this time he faced hemmett squarely and the effect was rather curious
mr hemmett returned the stare and found himself facing a smile in which relief played no small part
mr lips opened suddenly and closed again so suddenly that they heard the click of his teeth
well go on domez he said quietly
your men found out that much
my men indeed senor
it was clever
what else is there to tell
and now he even smiled and a deep pleased breath escaped the chief of detectives
he looked keenly at hemmett for an instant and grew downright bland
see senor what it is to have trained men to the great efficiency he said
it has been learned it has been reported to me by perequito peer of all detectives in guanama that a vast plot exists even as the senor has suspected that the ladies were to be held as hostages
this came to my ears senor and i leaped to action that should prevent the crime
too late
even as my men were mustered word came that the worst had happened
i see said mr hemmett even more quietly
what else
with all speed i despatched perequito and seven others senor to learn what might be learned and that without an instants delay
and senor the honored secretary of war had but telephoned me a little while ago when they came to report once more
the ladies have been taken and are being held by a superior force so that my men dared not attack yet they have learned that a special train was waiting senor
they have learned that the scoundrels mean to imprison the ladies in the far hills and i have provided for the rescue
how
the large official police car waits without with five men senor and nine more have been sent to follow the special should it start before we can reach it
come then and it may be that even before they can start from puerto carlo the rescue may be effected
if not well
if not we will follow by the highroad pass the train and await it at las almas
come
he turned toward the door with a queer assured little jerk as if entirely certain that hemmett and the rest would follow
for that matter mr hemmett did take a pace or two after him but only to call domez
senor hurry away
just wait a minute like this
hemmett lunged
his powerful fingers wound suddenly about the amazed little mans thick throat a swing and the chief of detectives had been flattened face up across the heavy table
and mr hemmett choking at him with an enthusiasm that boded ill for domez hissed stop that gurgling
i look like an idiot domez thats evident but there are still a few people in this abandoned hole who canot put anything over on me and it is your misfortune to be among the number
senor squawked thickly from the throat
i want the truth and i want it quick and heaven help you domez if you donot tell it
i want to kill somebody and youre handiest
talk and donot try to wriggle loose
the truth the truth senor
domez sputtered wildly
i do not know the truth
then i think send you where theyll get it out of you with a redhot pitchfork
hemmett stated and the fingers tightened again
and not without effect this time for thick fingers gripped his hands and tugged at them as his face blackened
domez just as mr hemmett was readjusting his grip screamed hear me then
hear me senor
well
hemmett relaxed his hold almost regretfully
it is but the orders of the great senor the senor jones that i follow cried the detective chief who had acquired remarkable directness of thought and speech during the last few seconds
i speak the truth in this
i swear it
it has been said to me by the senor jones himself thflt the women are to be abducted and that the police are not to see
he paid me much money senor before this thing was done stop there hemmett said quickly
where have they been taken
kill me but that i cannot tell you shrieked domez
a certain signal senor a certain signal and i was to come and say to you that the women went to the hills
more than this i do not know but if eyes meant anything if waving hands and general expression meant anything he was telling the truth this time
mr hemmett the fingers still on the throat studied the popeyed congested countenance for many long seconds at last to release the little man and step away enough domez stay here a while now
that that is the truth senor the detective chief chattered staggering to his feet
and as for staying here i dare not go farther now
jones has spies senor even in the churches of guanama
jones has spies in every store in every street in every stable and garage and every company of the army jones has spies
now he will kill me
and darned little loss to anybody
mr hemmett observed settle with you later domez
just now that
some one else to be sure had arrived one who came into the house with a bound spoke swiftly to elenida apparently dashed into their very midst
alvarez
girton cried
it was indeed alvarez their friend alvarez who had been their friend years ago when first they came to guanama
he had been a very young man in those days now he had prospered and the alvarez docks eventually bade fair to handle the bulk of puerto commerce but he was the same old alvarez honest and open as the day devoted to themselves as he had been in the earlier times and now he stood with hands outstretched in wildest excitement
senores he cried gaspingly
the senora hemmett the lovely senorita tesoro the senora barton i think
i have seen i have seen seen them
girton said
alvarez gripped himself hard well aware of times value have seen them he said swiftly
at this minute they are being taken from puerto carlo on the torpedoboat destroyer el fuego had pressed very swiftly this late afternoon
false though they knew it to be the impression of the women being taken to the hills still lingered in three brains
hence three men stared blankly at alvarez while the fourth which was domez huddled down in a corner of the room and gazed fearfully at the windows
el fuego
hemmett stammered after a second or two
el fuego to be sure senor the swift the racer el fuego
i have seen it with my own eyes
how
from the roof of my no dock where men were working and where i went to see the progress they had made
i stood there senor hemmett gazing across the harbor and as i gazed there left the yachtclub dock a speedy tender and how long ago girton shot at him
six minutes perhaps seven it cannot be longer
i came here so swiftly senor girton that police from one end of town to the other screamed at me and sought to pursue my little car
i stood there then and watched the tender and in it i saw women struggling violently two of them that is while the third the senora barton sat and wept
a groan escaped her husband stood astounded unbelieving
alvarez raced on dramatically
havora the contractor was there as well enjoying his view with his binoculars
i snatched them from him
i looked more closely
i am here
and its the last place for us to be
hemmett snarled as he dashed into the library and out of the library and to the terrace overlooking the harbor
when with the exception of domez who still cowered in his corner they came to his side glasses were focusing on midharbor
nor had alvarez erred
ten seconds and the powerful lenses were cutting cleanly the deck of el fuego first of the new destroyers
smoke belched from the three short funnels anchors were already up and the boat already in motion and on the deck in plain sight of all who cared to look was the brilliant spot that must be operacloak
and there gowned in gray was the form of a middleaged woman too yes and just coming into sight led by a white man who could be none other than william jones was a young woman in a long white cloak
her features he could not see at the distance nor was there any need of seeing them
mercedes tesoro was an intimate of the hemmett household since the early part of the season hemmett had seen that same white cloak wide and voluminous spreading at the bottom
it was mercedes right
hemmett said briefly
he has them there and and he means to carry out the program he threatened
come never catch them in your motorboat
girton cried running beside him to the steps and the street
never and we couldnot get aboard if we did steve said hemmett
but well get them well get em or is that your car alvarez
at the service of yourselves dock and go like the devil
hemmett directed as he leaped in
there was a roar from the motor and for a time the two most eminent americans in guanama had left their home neighborhood
just why alvarez failed to dash them to bits on the steep hill passes explanation now and then his light car left the ground altogether bounding crazily from one side of the street to the other now and then turning a corner it seemed that they were about to leave the vehicle altogether and hurtle through the windows of a home and yet alvarez had not lost his smile when they came to the level part of town and with girton jabbing incessantly at the horn broke every speed law ever laid down for the regulation of puerto carlo traffic
the business section merely flitted past and then the poorer residential quarter
out there in the twilight the harbor stretched away mysteriously with every now and then a glimpse of el fuego steaming straight for the open sea
hemmett jaws set was ready to leap at the yachtclubhouse before the car had even slowed down and cheerfully abandoning his property alvarez darted after at side
there was a certain mistaken attendant who came forward smiling and bowing and smirking to welcome the eminent members
because of his error in bowing directly before hemmett he picked himself up from the far corner of the big assembly room vaguely of the impression that a tropical earthquake had taken place and while he was still sitting on the floor edward hemmett had leaped into the beautiful cedar boat and was working over the engine while alvarez and girton dragged back the canvas cover
and they were off
spray whirling up in a white mass settling then until it seemed that a sheet of clear glass stood high above either side of the speedboat the expensive exquisite craft whirled out into the harbor with hemmett camped grimly behind its automobile stering wheel
just once girton managed where
destroyer pavoroso
hemmett shouted
only thing afloat around here thatll catch her
then he pushed spark and throttle forward to their last notch and bent his head before the wind and so they whizzed down puerto carlo harbor and directly to the side of the pavoroso companion destroyer to the el fuego
but two or three sailors were visible languid and not greatly interested until the speedboat came directly alongside
as the motor stopped however the trio above quickened and grew visibly excited and expectant of just what
mr hemmett would have given much to know as he climbed the short ladder cast one backward glance at alvarez busy with securing the motorboat and barked mozo
where is he
el capitan senor
he is ashore the sailor nearest responded
so much the better in command of the craft steve
drill any man who disobeys or tries to leave
alvarez
senor
get into the wirelesshouse quick
if theres nobody on duty stay there and keep every one out
if there is any one there see that he doesnot work the apparatus the engineroom
i see
and having apparently taken over the boat for his own purpose these lhst twenty seconds he was gone
he had been aboard the pavoroso on the day of her first coming when the reception was tendered and he had agreed heartily at the time that guanama had acquired the fastest thing in destroyers and he remembered the general layout
so it came that reaching the chief engineers office in rather less than another twenty seconds mr hemmett walked in and snapped his fingers at the portly ornately uniformed official who smoked in the easy chair
you rodero
how much steam have you
steam senor
oh it is the senor hemmett said the chief and the queer insolence he had seen in other quarters was before hemmett again
i had thought senor that you had left guanama
no
steam steam what
a pound or two perhaps
no more
the fires are banked senor and why do you ask
because interested
snatch down that telephone and tell em to have a running head of steam in those boilers as quick oh but my good senor hemmett the chief smiled flatly and impudently
how can it be that one accepts orders from yourself
our new president has appointed you the secretary of the navy perhaps or given you command of the pavoroso tell you how it can be that one accepts orders from me the caller explained as his automatic pressed directly over the chiefs heart as the chief himself turned white abruptly raised heavy arms hastily
i canot waste time explaining the matter rodero but i can tell you one thing youll have this boat running under a full head of steam without losing more than one second or kill you and take charge of this end myself
which
he was of course insane
the chief engineer who entertained a hearty respect for armed lunatics did indeed snatch down his telephone and the sincerity of the words he uttered into it almost warmed chilling heart
and having uttered them he dropped back in his chair scared and perspiring and the cold blue of edward eye drilled through his very soul
el fuego has just started out of the harbor bound for i donot know where said the owner of the eye going to overhaul her or blow up this boat and if through any fault of yours we do neither you will not come back
you know me pretty well rodero
if you want to take a chance on any tricky stuff take it
below coal was rattling and shovels scraping and if rodero knew mr hemmett it was more certain that hemmett knew rodero
in the wellfilled ranks of fullblown guanaman cowards rodero was among the brighter lights
judging by his present expression the odds that he would try disobedience were perhaps one to five hundred and hemmett accepted them with a grunt and hurried back to the deck
girton after a fashion had taken command
some thirty of the crew were standing there regarding him silently as he addressed them too silently and in a surly fashion that was far from reassuring
touched by the unusual mood that had grown so curiously prevalent the crowd looked downright ugly
girton turned to his friend and snapped in english safe to risk it with this gang
is there any other way of risking it
but yes senor
alvarez put in unexpectedly
there is indeed another way for even i can be of assistance
even though it be possible i pray that you do not start until i return
he had left them
he had gone over the side like a monkey and was down in motorboat and backing away from the long thin destroyer
somewhat dazedly hemmett watched him go wondered just where he might be heading observed that he was making directly for his own docks and turned to find that the destroyers crew on their own initiative had moved forward in a body
what did you say to them steve
hemmett asked told them that we were going to sea and that they were under my orders and they hardly made a sign one way or the other
one of the devilish little petty officers laughed and shrugged his shoulders and that was about all
and if they try anything rough therell be three of us to handle thirty or forty of them providing that alvarez gets back
hemmett muttered
he turned and peered through the thickening twilight to the harbor mouth and the atlantic beyond
the stern of el fuego was just vanishing as she headed down the coast and behind her lay a heavy trail of black smoke
it may not have been a sob that escaped hemmett it was at any rate a sound that caused hand to rest rather suddenly on his arm and girton to say let yourself think about it i know that sounds ridiculous but its the only way to keep from going mad just now
when i looked at that crew and saw the way some of them were looking at me and considered the way a guanaman crew ought to look at one of us why for a second or two i was on the very verge of pulling the gun wiping out such of the little rats as i could and then going down in a fight with the rest the sort of mental state well have to avoid old man if were ever if were ever he himself had to pause for a moment
hemmett breathed deeply
well were going to bring the girls back or were not coming back ourselves if thats what you mean he said
this little pesthole of a country has never beaten us yet steve and it canot beat us now
but its closer to it at this minute than it has ever come before
girton snllled bitterly
side by side they gazed through the gloom toward the alvarez dock
the speedboat had disappeared long before this and the smokeclouds overhead were growing very dense
in a very few minutes the gages below would show a head of steam and if alvarez had not reappeared when there was pressure enough to send the engines into action there would be two men against the crowd instead of three
although from the thick evening mists near the alvarez dock that gentleman himself certainly seemed to be returning now
the foggy white spot was the spray of the speedboat but the spray and the motion of the craft behind it were different now
ordinarily mr marine wonder almost soared over the surface of the water whereas it was almost wallowing now
its owner and his friend stepped to the other rail and strained their eyes loaded down steve
hemmett muttered
yes and with men breathed the retired secretary of war
look at it
there must be fifteen of them jammed up forward and there are as many more aft
silently they watched and be it admitted thrilled a little
if it was a relief expedition alvarez was a wonder
he had been gone all told perhaps eight minutes and now he was coming alongside again the highspeed engine hammering viciously under its unusual load
and now it had ceased hammering and the crew of the pavoroso were streaming aft and alvarez before them threw out his hands and smiled a glorified smile
it is done senores he reported
to sacrifice the beautiful boat is a sin yet we cannot drown these pigs who have elected to laugh at the great senor girton
you will stand back senores
it was more than a request and they were already standing back for over the side of the pavoroso swarmed uncouth men great husky men picd for their jobs as heavyweight dockworkers large tough men in shirts and flapping linen trousers who went to work without one seconds delay as alvarez their employer barked commands
the general sense gained by hemmett and girton during those dizzying seconds was that the regular crew was being ordered into and then thrown bodily into the speedboat
fists flew here and there for a moment some one fired a shot and thanks to a dreadful uppercut from a brown fist toppled over the side with the smoking pistol still in his hand
a whitefaced little officer evidently first assistant engineer came trotting to report that steam was up and the anchors weighing nor had he more than stammered the words and hurried away than the quiver of engines shook the vessel
and fifty yards astern the packed motorboat with its yelling snarling passengers drifted toward the shore
the pavoroso shook again
the fifty yards widened suddenly
the chase was on
a is the psychological distinction between motion and the lack of motion girton and hemmett felt their spirits rising higher with every turn of the highpowered engines
carmen mercedes and wife might be in a position quite as perilous as heretofore or even more perilous if jones chanced to resent the pursuit but at least help was coming nearer to them every minute now
the destroyer surged out between the crescent points of the harbor and headed south in the brilliant light of the rising tropical moon before they quite realized that the thing had been accomplished and that alvarez was missing
he turned up suddenly smiling
all seems well senores he reported brisklv
eh
i have visited every part of the vessel save the engineroom which seems to be working nicely
there are on deck no more than six or seven of the crew for many were ashore on leave and these six or seven having felt the hands of my men are humble and willing to obey youre a wonder alvarez
girton muttered
to serve yourselves senores that is a joy the younger man stated with a smile
later perhaps these men of mine will be of further service and upon them you may depend for they are tried and true fighters loyal to me which means loyal to yourselves
i speak they obey
what is next to be done
there was something distinctly helpful about alvarez with his excited smile and his utter confidence in the force he had precipitated so astonishingly on the destroyer pavoroso
looking at him it was rather difficult to believe that all would not end well and hemmett even smiled faintly
it might be as well for both of us to leave this rail and give up trying to see a vessel already out of sight he said and find out just what weve got aboard the wireless man alvarez
small and easily cowed
alvarez reported
he was smoking in his little cabin senor when we came aboard with the telephones on his ears and evidently expecting something
you will now find him somewhere outside his cabin and here is the key
you will take it
i may need it and hemmett dropped it into his pocket leave you in charge of the deck alvarez and see the navigating officer
the ship isnot steering herself i take it
young arturo polito is in charge
you remember him professional fat boy eh
girton said
i remember him very well
he graduated from our naval college i remember that too because i indorsed his application
hemmett at his side he walked to the wheelhouse and opened the door
polito was indeed its only tenant a very plump and sleepyeyed young brown man goodnatured as ever
they greeted him with mingled emotions for he among some thousands of others had much cause to be loyal to guanama
so you were in it too eh
mr hemmett observed
in it and out of it again senor apparently said the second officer of the pavoroso quite easily
many strange things have happened recently in our navy senor things about which one may ask questions and learn nothing
i had intended in another week or two to ask for my discharge and join my father in business for i do not like strange things
and now a few minutes gone the excellent senor alvarez points a pistol and informs me that on pain of death we are to catch el fuego
so now if you understand that much youve got it all polito girton said sharply
can we overhaul the boat
it is possible it is not likely polito said placidly as he kindled a fresh cigarette
on the trials you know el fuego averaged the tenth part of a mile better than this vessel
that is the difference
then get busy with your engineroom telegraph and see if the pavoroso canot make that extra tenth herself and a little more
because were going to overhaul el fuego
his steady eye bored into the large cowlike orbs of polito some ten seconds polito studied the gaze and the face of the man behind it and then with a little shiver he nodded
yes senor said he plainly convinced
if it be within human power we are to overhaul el fuego
be assured of my poor best efforts to that end
he picked up the speakingtube and took to shouting energetically and sincerely as rodero had shouted to his fireroom force
hemmett and girton a little easier left him and walked forward where alvarez already peered into the night ahead
i have ordered the searchlight manned he reported
it is one of the wonders of the navy this pavoroso searchlight
with it and the moon we shall soon pick up el fuego i think
he was wrong
the searchlight flaring out after another two or three minutes swept the water ahead all in vain
east of their path it went and west through painful minutes
there was no sign of el fuego
half an hour had gone then and abruptly a pencil of light rose on the skyline dead ahead rose and disappeared again it
mr girton exclaimed
and theyre making for the open sea theyre heading east added his friend
in that senor i think you are wrong alvarez smiled
i have had speech with one barra head of the fireroom
he spoke freely to me senor for we are old friends
it is said by barra that the other destroyer is making straight for parilla to take on coal
eh
and i think that this is true senor because coal for el fuego is lying at my own dock and was to have been taken aboard tomorrow
and the bunkers here
they are full senor
well that sounds something like
girton exclaimed
that ought to mean that well overhaul them before midnight
before eleven i should say senor alvarez answered cheerfully
again their anxious hearts quickened again as the searchlight was switched off at last they took to peering through the soft moonlight reaches
they were doing all that lay within the pavoroso several trips below at regular intervals proved that much
whatever affiliation with the plot that bade fair to make guanama the ranking traitor nation of history the chief engineer was accepting this evening at its full face value
the periodical visits below of hemmett may have had something to do with it or the three square jawed tattered stevedores who stood about the engineroom at any rate it was certain that another pound of steam would rend the boilers
they had been heading south for an hour and now they had been heading south for two hours and more and despite his best efforts fear was creeping into the heart of each man that alvarez had been wrong and that el fuego was not bound for parilla and coal
her searchlight after that one flash had not reappeared and terrified pessimism was working its way to lips when alvarez cried suddenly there senores
there
see
the smoke to starboard
she is running not a mile from the coast
do you see
the moon was coming from a fiveminute obscurity behind thick scurrying clouds and through the growing light they strained their eyes again and el fuego was there surely enough
plowing along far far ahead that thin dark spot with the thin white wake must be el fuego and hemmett fairly bounded into the wheelhouse and hurled at the sleepyeyed polito over there
can we pick her up with the searchlight
it should be possible senor
try it
tense seconds and the white stream shone across the rolling ocean nosed about for a bit and rested steadily upon the destroyer ahead and to their excited eyes it seemed that even in the seconds el fuego had lost ground
she was nearer by quarter of a mile or was it only two hundred yards or was it anything at all
mr hemmett gave it up and dashed toward the wirelesshouse where the philosophical operator still sat upon the step and smoked
wake up he shouted
here
the doors open get in there and call el fuego
a message senor the operator said calmly
a message for jones yes i see that you know jones
get him you and tell him to stop thats all
tell him to stop or well sink him my man and remember that standing here beside you and that i spent several years in wireless work and that if you begin sending code or anything else mysterious youll go overboard and do the sending myself
considering that his one attempt to learn the mysteries of the continental wireless alphabet had been a dismal failure the statement was a slight exaggeration yet it went well enough
the operator had absorbed some of this evenings atmosphere aboard the destroyer he seated himself obediently and set his quenched sparkgap to hissing and crackling softly
he adjusted his tuning apparatus and waited
once more he called once more he waited and this time he smiled slightly
they are listening he reported
they refuse to take a message
how can they
hemmett snapped
how can one force them to take a message when the telephones are thus easily removed the operator smiled blandly laying aside his own
you put those back on your head and send them a message whether they acknowledge it or not commanded mr hemmett
tell jones to stop or well sink him yes and put an added point to it too
he dashed off again leaving the operator pressing resignedly at his key
he found girton and alvarez where he had left them send one shot across their bows he announced
what is this affair threeinch rifle
yes the new type girton assented
five charges in the small magazine at the base and probably a couple of hundred more below
one will do for us
firing her is your job steve
can you get the range
in a minute or two said girton without great enthusiasm
he could not forget that mercedes tesoro was a prisoner aboard el fuego he could not drive from his mind the fact that this was the ocean and that his really deep artillery study of recent years had been all upon land
up at las almas in the training days of the army both as an example and because the practise interested him deeply the secretary of war had personally piled up a score at the targets which still stood unmatched but this well this was different
still he went to work and alvarez at his side watched every move absorbedly drinking in each little detail with that overwhelming interest that had gone so far toward making his own success
ready
girton announced simply
let her go
there was a flash and a roar and a shock that set the slender bow of the pavoroso to quivering and six hands clasped at the rail while six eyes darted down the path of the searchlight to el fuego
and a cry escaped three mouths for there was a splash and a spurt of white water just ahead of the other destroyer and el fuego even when they had stared hardly breathing through another minute showed no signs of coming to a standstill they see it
hemmett muttered wonderingly
they saw it fast enough but jones is aboard that boat said girton
we neednot stop at that got the range business down to a hairs breadth
well
the next one goes through her engineroom ned
to sink her gasped mr hemmett
she will not sink girton smiled stop though and theyll shut her watertight compartments in a hurry and by the time theyve been shut we ought to be alongside and boarding her
alvarez all enthusiasm all faith was even now drawing out another shell and another firing charge and although the very notion sent chills up and down hemmett s spine he offered no objection
teeth set he watched girton tinker his rangefinder delicately almost unbreathingly and the wireless man was beside them with a fluttering bit of paper
they have answered senor he cried
i have sent as you requested and they have replied
edward hemmett snatched the paper from him and held it in the faint reflected light from the searchlight
it was addressed to himself and it read the women are lashed to the afterdeck
the boats and every man on board are ready to leave
if you wish to sink el fuego sink her are ready senor
alvarez was saying tensely
you watch the spot beside their engineroom and youll see mr girton was just beginning
well donot
hemmett shouted
you you here wireless
get back there and say say nothing at all until i give the word
girton turned somewhat blankly from his gun
what now
jones says that all hands are ready to leave steve which means that if you put a hole through her they wonot bother with the compartments
and the women are lashed down tight
the gunners enthusiasm cooled ruptly
his hands dropped and he smiled bitterly
jones always seems to have something ready doesnot he
his coals giving out too and hes slowing down
look at that
yes and since hes so handy with the ultimatum stuff have a try at it myself
hemmett stormed be alongside in another five minutes and going to warn him that he broke off and sped after the radio man
he found that person sitting before his instruments telephones already adjusted and smiling interestedly
the operator held up a restraining hand moment sefior he cried softly
more is coming now
his pencil scratched ahead and hemmett scowling over his shoulder watched the words and damned his own earlier lack of persistence in matters telegraphic
his mind would have been easier could he have but read those clicks and buzzes audible even with the telephones on the mans head
we are coming to anchor grew swiftly to you will drop anchor at least five hundred yards astern
should you fail to do this or should you choose in any way to attack el fuego the women will be shot in cold blood before you can possibly reach us
this time the signature of william jones was added and having scrawled it the operator looked up
they have signed off senor he reported
that is the end of the message
without a comment mr hemmett snatched it from the table and left the little cabin
a moment only he hesitated as at the door of the wheelhouse he gazed across the black water el fuego was gliding to a full stop and they were coming very very near to her now
the distance between was surely less than half a mile and should jones happen to estimate it as less mr hemmett barked an order at polito which set the engineroom telegraph going denly and hurried to his friend still in the bow still gazing at el fuego stopped girton said superfluously the matter with this tub
engines busted stopping too mr hemmett snarled
here read it
glasses were not needed now to watch el fuego
the moon had disappeared again and the searchlight showed the motionless destroyer against a background of solid impenetrable black and showed as well the bustling about toward the stern where hung the gasoline tender
whatever their purpose they were making ready to lower away the little boat
men were scrambling in to the number of half a dozen guanaman sailors all by their uniforms then distant and tiny the figure of jones advanced and climbed into the tender and after him a man in civilian togs whom they had not seen before
the tender slid to the black water and they caught the faint hum of the engines read it girton muttered as his eyes went back to el fuego coming aboard here
yes and the other boats are swung out from el fuego and shes settling too said hemmett
settling
look at her
she hasnot taken on any cargo since we started steve but shes half a foot lower in the water
silently they studied the new phenomenon for a little while the tender hummed through the night toward them
it had covered half the distance before girton coming to the end of a new train of thought spoke softly alvarez
yes senor and the younger man came closer
have them drop that long boat on the port side and have it done quick
then pick me a dozen of your men who can scrap
see
i understand senor
and then dealt them out the pistols from the arsenal below
they are all armed senor
then going to take them over and officially capture el fuego as soon as jones sets foot on this deck
mr girton said simply
if i ever stand here and look at him and think about the girls hemmett nodded quickly
i had thought of the same thing he said
take alvarez with you and beat it steve have the searchlight kept off the water and when youve matters in your own hands start the wireless
make dots and nothing else you can manage that
inasmuch as been giving lessons in field wireless yes
and if you need help simply point the searchlight at the sky and leave it there because i shall be able to quit jones and come to help you about three minutes after he has boarded us not going to slaughter the man
heaven forbid
mr hemmett said grimly going to hang on to myself if i can until i see whos with him and hear what he has to say and i think i can
the searchlight switched around to reveal the tender not fifty yards distant and making gracefully for the destroyer
hemmett bit off the words and stephen girton was gone
he heard girton cross the dock heard the soft pattering of many feet and the creak of pulleys and presently the faintest little splash
mr hemmett stepped to the man at the searchlight and snapped an order his white beam rose and hung over the top of el fuego in purposeless fashion and up from the starboard landingstage in the most fashion william jones was stepping to the deck of the destroyer
calmer or more pleasantly smiling no man could have been
an assured lazy little swagger was in his walk and his shoulders swung to it
behind him in the faint illumination of the destroyers decklights stood a short thickset guanaman and for an instant as he viewed the latter fury at jones almost subsided for that was jose canita new president of the national bank of guanama a millionaire who ranked almost with fernandez a mighty hidden power in the darker more mysterious depths of politics and sometimes mentioned as the most powerful one man in all guanama pigeyed oily he smiled directly and significantly at edward hemmett and in less than five seconds hemmett felt queerly he had learned more about the plot more about the recent elections than he had ever known before
our dear mr hemmett eh
jones observed easily
oh you know the excellent canita donot you
i wish you wouldnot look at him just like that hemmett it isnot politic
he might insist on having you taken back and sentenced to death by one of his pet judges or something like that dear stephen girton
he didnot come
hemmett snapped
well he really
jones smiled
is superb vitality ebbing that he funked the spectacular chase
i could have sworn that hed be with you ready to eat the whole world raw andhello
what the devil kind of crew have we here he concluded with genuine interest as he gazed at the tattered group of overdeveloped dock workers that hovered near the substitute crew hemmett said let you alone unless oh theyll let me alone without any unless jones assured him
well mr flemmett calmer i observe nice been looking at el fuego i believe these last minutes
is it necessary to outline the situation in mere words
it is not rasping accent put in
you are not a fool senoi hemmett
you are ready now i think to do the wise thing
the wonderful senor jones will still guarantee that you and the women shall be delivered safely at the isthmus
it is most gdnerous
it is more than i should do
because if that bullheaded dementia still possesses you the little game will end here and now hemmett jones pursued
upon my word you donot seem very intelligent after all
do you quite realize that the seacocks on el fuego are open and water coming into her hull at the rate of an inch every minute or so your eyes told you that my men are in the boats ready to leave when the boats themselves come to the water level you really believe that your ladies are trussed to the rail over there hemmett
he sauntered nearer and looked at mr hemmett interestedly
now youve got about ten minutes to decide he explained
guanama doesnot need you hemmett you or girton
neither does the er railroad which i have the honor to represent still let you have your ladies intact take you to the yacht i mentioned aboard this very boat hemmett
and please donot glare a dreadful and desperate character but all by my little self i still have you where the hair is very short
you canot give a particle of assistance to the unfortunately sinking el fuego old chap because you canot get there
even if your whole somewhat shabbylooking crew here were to pile into the small boats it would really avail nothing at all because my own crew have orders to fire on everything and anything my own tender excepted that comes in sight
you take the general sense of the argument sure
now what i propose is this you will come with me to el fuego as hostage get the ladies and well get my crew
your own remarkable crowd here will put out for the shore
and then well turn around and steam back to puerto carlo and youll have a pleasant trip on a nice yacht just as soon as had mr girton sandbagged and brought aboard
and youll have the positive assurance that if you ever show your faces again in guanama youll be shot on sight
do i seem to exaggerate
it is a wrong impression believe me
sweeping changes are coming in guanama oh so soon
well
these last few seconds hemmett had been straining his ears for sounds across the water
when they came something inside informed him there were certain things which he would do in a fraction of time less than measurable
but they had not come yet
and the fact that we are american citizens jones he began old stuff dreary old stuff these days
jones said impatiently
if youre nasty youll be dead citizens you know and dead or alive you may be entirely sure that no credible word will ever come to your precious united states
if you live and raise a rumpus youll find officially that you were expelled from guanama for arson or grand larceny or something of the sort
if you die pouf
i control every means of communication out of guanama
i control every newspaper in the country
i con across the water a wild chorus of yells rose suddenly and wilder than any of them was edward own yell aboard the pavoroso where one swelled head is smashed thundered mr hemmett as he plunged at mr jones across the black water stephen girton gazed hard at the moon and drew a breath of relief
that cloud was growing thicker toward the center and the moon would remain behind it for all of fifteen minutes
and he seemed to have left the pavoroso without attracting attention
jones was aboard too by this time
his tender was bobbing at the ladder and girton held his breath once more as he watched the three or four sailors in her and prayed fervently that the almost inaudible plashing of oars might not reach them across that bare two hundred feet of black water
and then he eased for they were quite absorbed in their own chatter smoking laughing they sat about the engine pit and now the danger virtually was over
and the job that lay ahead was not exactly without danger
behind him were some dozen of men armed fighters by preference but on el fuego what might he find
the little destroyers were always undermanned and shoreleave prompted by universal sympathy with the guanaman thirst was a chronic evil of the navy but it was entirely possible that forty or fifty armed men were awaiting his coming not that it mattered very much save as concerned the chances of quick success
with mercedes aboard el fuego the powers of evil themselves would only have invited mr girton to battle tonight
he whispered ordering a little more speed he looked very thoughtfully at the faces about him and then glancing up at the lights he noted that they were fairly under the stern of el fuego and sliding around to the starboard side and the ladder
and just overhead now
why men were swarming out of the small boats there
they had been detected at last and they were bumping the side and his own men were rising as one and mr girton automatic in hand bounded up the ladder to el deck
the very suddenness of his advent seemed to have paralyzed those nearest him
teeth bared gun for the moment forgotten the pentup emotions of the evening exploded within stephen girton
there was a dark face near and a riflebarrel his fist obliterated the dark face and the rifle flew overboard
and behind him there were yells and the jostling of his own men and a shot or two and after that for a little hades itself broke loose
although for girton it was a joyful infernal region
his fists were swinging and swirling pounding and hammering ecstatically
men were yelling and men were falling in a twinkling instant he saw raporta first officer of el fuego narroweyed and savage fire a shot at one of the dock workers saw the first officer lifted bodily and sent crashing to the deck senseless saw a knife coming in his own direction and heard the crazy scream as he gripped the arm and all but tore it from its socket saw patero mightiest of the stevedores as three men dragged at him saw patero hurl one out of sight along the deck and the other bodily into the near outhanging cutter saw him grip the neck of the third and squeeze and shake until the bulgingeyed face vanished from mr ken in a new surge of battle
another knife was coming his way and he leaped toward it and laughed madly for his very expression seemed to have frightened the senses out of this latest member of el crew and he had thrown away the knife and was running to the side saw three more coming at him head down and leaped at them as well bleeding fists hurling at them like two triphammers
there was perhaps nothing really civilized or intellectually uplifting in any of it but the fact remained that all things considered stephen girton had not enjoyed himself so thoroughly in a long long time
and then why he was slamming and punching at the empty air and a dockman with one eye closed and a cheek badly cut was grinning at him and saying enough senor
they have fled
see one and all they have gone and those that could not flee were thrown after into the boats
eh stammered mr girton
and the women senor
they have been liberated and they are unharmed for he said no more
girton in one second had come to his senses had looked about swiftly and had mercedes tesoro in his arms
it was a heartstopping moment
the civilized element in girton welled up and silently and fervently he gave up thanks as he pressed the frightened sobbing girl to him
it was the first tear that mercedes had shed since that astounding rpoment at the foot of the garden as these were the first tears of carmen hemmett standing by mrs barton and striving to still the hysteria that had afflicted the older lady ever since the beginning of the amazing adventure
stephen girton returned to life quite suddenly
patero white and breathless still was tapping his arm
senor he said
the vessel is sinking
what
it is said by miguelo that the seacocks have been opened
he would ask if the senor would know how they may be closed
girton blinking bit his lips
i donot know he confessed
get the searchlight into action and if it needs electricity senor it is impossible said patero
water is in the firerooms and the engineroom
this much i have seen but if there be other power perhaps if there is i donot know how to find it
girton told him no marine engineer and unusual man that he was in the vastness of his relief he laughed outright have to take to the boats and get back to the pavoroso
and that too is impossible for the boats are gone even to the one in which we came said the dockman energetically
and more evil than this has been the act of the crew senor
to the last lifebelt every means of keeping afloat has been cast overboard it was the work of murderers and we should have understood when we saw the two chests hurled into the sea but in the great turmoil laugh had died altogether
so had excited flood of words up to this minute continuing in spite of patero
a tremendous stillness seemed to settle on the deck of el fuego
do you mean to say girton demanded thickly that this things going down and that we have no means of getting off
with the shore two miles away senor
then yell cried mr girton
yell like blazes for help and patero smiled forlornly
help from the pavoroso
the night wind blows squarely in our faces from that quarter senor how the thing had happened edward hemmett could not recall but jones was lying there at his feet senseless and bruised and very unwholesome to look upon
canita had suffered too canita lay huddled down by the hatch weeping queerly and apparently unable to move and the senseless figure over there wore the cap of el fuego as did three others who were being held by the pavoroso s scrub crew
further alvarez was holding his arm and saying senor
i know
i understand but we shall settle
you would not kill the pigs with your own hands
i didnot i finish jones
hemmett panted as his vision cleared a little and familiar objects of the deck impressed themselves on his brain once more
no senor but it shall be done and well and what are you doing here anyway
hemmett broke in
i thought youd gone with girton
it was by his order that i remained behind senor alvarez smiled and hemmett wondered vaguely at the smile
it was an unearthly sort of expresion pallid wideeyed it suggested that alvarez was seeing visions
and we senor hemmett will go i think to his assistance now
eh
i am not sure
i think the senor girton calls for help
the wind is against them now but as it rose there were wild cries senor and much all right said mr hemmett get over there in a hurry then
get your men together go senor and the alvarez smile grew more peculiar with every second
and these dogs and traitors even to the crew of el fuego we shall bind fast that they may remain
and polito senor and the boy of the wireless we shall take them with us and three of the fireroom force as well for i know them and they are less traitors than fools
edward hemmett stared after him as he flitted away
he had known alvarez for many years as a person of vivid enthusiasms and tremendous initiative once an idea had gripped him yet he had never seen alvarez carry on just like that before
it was queer but meditating upon it was not nearly so pleasant as watching men truss up william jones and the unspeakable canita and the snarling members of el crew and hemmett turned his attention in that direction
it was solid fact that he could not remember a single detail of the attack but he had certainly done a thorough job on william jones
he remembered that face and the boys had floated before him just as his fingers touched the corrupter of guanama and that was all
and it had evidently been quite enough and to save himself hemmett could feel no twinge of conscience
he smiled grimly and faced alvarez just speeding into sight again
and now to go senor the younger man cried
it is to hasten i think and all are ready
el tendqr will hold us easily
he led the way to the side and over it and hemmett followed briskly enough his mind turning to el fuego and what might be happening aboard her
a human stream came after them filling the little boat and the pavoroso for a time was free to drift as she pleased
ever and anon as he worked over the engine alvarez glanced back at him smiling almost contentedly
hemmett watched him and sighed once in a while your excitable guanaman goes stark staring mad under too much emotional strain
then his gaze wandered to the scared wireless man to the fat young polito who smoked another cigarette and gazed philosophically and contentedly ahead
polito by the way should have been left in charge and we are here and safely
alvarez announced
and there was doubtless a genuine fight waiting for them
mr hemmett giving over observation of his companions swung up to the deck and felt them swarming after him
mr hemmett came face to face with his old friend stephen girton and three ladies and one of them flew to mr arms with a scream of joy and for a little he cated nothing about the impending battle nor did he even note its absence until get the women into the tender ned
heaven knows i sympathize but you two canot stand there and spoon all night
this tubs not going to float another ten minutes
you say senor alvarez gasped sinking and that tender ll have to take the women over to the pavoroso first and then come back for the rest and great luck if some of us donot have to make the trip swimming
alvarez wrung his hands
el fuego sinks he shrieked
she sinks
then i have he said no more
off where the pavoroso lay the ocean seemed to open wide and belch forth flame and smoke
a roar that shook the deck and seemed fairly to beat them down came within the second and there was a queer loud hiss
and the moon coming at last from behind the cloud shone on the spot where the pavoroso had been
there was only curiously turbulent water now with a great surging white pall of smoke overhead
so shall all traitors die said alvarez between his teeth
mr head was just settling back on his shoulders after the blast responsible for that he gasped
with a timefuse senor i kindled the magazine before we left the astonishing alvarez cried brokenly
it was right
it was just for such as they even this death was too merciful
yet had i known yes had you known that you were likely to drown the whole crowd by doing it you wouldnot have done it
hemmett thundered his own senses returning
why you confounded little lunatic he choked
he felt that he too was going mad
for here came polito strolling toward them cigarette and all and smiling
the vessel senor will not sink the officer reported placidly
the the seacocks
girton stuttered
yes
they have been closed of course by the levers which lie in the upper balcony of the engineroom polito smiled
otherwise i have also started the pumps which run by the auxiliary power astern senor so that in an hour or so we shall float quite easily
and by way of reaching the shore since the fires are dead and the engines flooded we shall use the auxiliary electric gear i think the storagebattery plant in the watertight compartment astern provided for the emergencies of battle
it is slow yet we shall effect a landing in parilla before two oclock i believe
girton moved limply to his side
polito he managed with a queer shaky smile maybe youre youre some good after all it admitted that edward hemmett even now had not readjusted himself
he had bathed and shaved and breakfasted he had slept three good hours after their return by rail from parilla and since cavalry had been around the house he had slept soundly
so that he was thoroughly rested and fit for business again but the calm of big senate chamber was almost disconcerting after the things that had happened last night
and it was calm
gazing down from the speakers desk at the hundred or more faces mr hemmett reflected that never in all its history had this hysterical gathering of latins been so utterly calm
here and there faces were pale here and there faces smiled tried to laugh gave it up
the air was downright thick with suspense and for cause
so many things had happened since this time yesterday that sorting them out in any kind of sequence was downright impossible as yet
alvarez the indefatigable the avenger had reported them verbally as hemmett and girton breakfasted alvarez had not slept and showed no signs of wanting to sleep for his country was to be saved and the two americans served in the tremendous task that had descended upon them suddenly as any thunderbolt
for one thing it appeared that altara alleged president of guanama had fled at dawn after an insane hour of bargaining with marado late secretary of state
the upshot of the interview had been that marado agreeing dazedly that the recent president should not be pursued altara had left a signed confession in his hands to be put to whatever use marado or any one else elected
as a document it was a wonder
hastily written even ungrammatical in spots it breathed one panicstricken desire to save himself by exposing all his accomplices nor did it lack in the definite quality for it gave names and dates and amounts of bribes at such length that hemmett at least all but forgot the substantial meal before him
news travels fast in guanama
an hour after daylight alvarez stated there had been something very like a procession of laden motorcars making for the northern border
puerto three morning papers were wallowing helplessly in the trough of events without editors or visible owners five of the big gray army automobiles had fought for the right of way on the first hill north of the city packed with uniforms trunks and gesticulating men
not less than eleven senators had resigned and disappeared and it was related by alvarez that the cruiser almiranta had started out of the harbor had been halted by some saner souls aboard had transferred her cargo of guanamans to the huge yacht that had followed william jones to puerto carlo and it was gone leaving the navy shorter of officers as such and decidedly longer of good ones
a thousand miles nearer the north pole the whole thing would have been grotesque and impossible in guanama it was only a little more than might have been expected for when panic and fear strike into guanaman circles they strike hard and spread more rapidly than any wildfire
and now because the senate had no speaker and barton had collapsed completely when his wife returned because there had been a certain strong demand this morning in influential circles that he grip the situation instantly hemmett was sitting up here and looking at senate while stephen girton at his side assorted documents pushed this one forward and then that grunted and occasionally chuckled to himself
perhaps the most cheering document of all of them was the long official message from washington decoded now and ready to be fired broadside into the choice little collection of legislators
the clerk was calling the roll in a small hushed voice
senators from the north the south the west and the east answered also in rather small hushed voices although here and there a consciously righteous man spoke vigorously in response to his name and even cleared his throat impressively afterward
the clerk turned toward mr hemmett and murmured there are nineteen more than we require for a quorum senor
then well open the days business
hemmett smiled grimly as he arose
gentlemen
absolute attention was his in one second
the senate of guanama has no speaker this morning mr hemmett went on
he is in the federal prison awaiting trial on a charge of high treason
he will be shot
i have taken the chair because there are things to be said which perhaps better than any one else am qualified to say
has any member an objection to offer on parliamentary grounds or any other grounds
absolute silence rewarded him
mr hemmett looked significantly at one ramon matora from the las almas district who rose promptly and faced his brother legislators
i move that the most excellent and highly esteemed senor hemmett be pointed speaker pro tem by acclamation he cried
there was no need of any seconding
one might have fancied that of all wishes that nearest the hearts of the gathering was to have the excellent and esteemed senor hemmett for speaker pro tem
the speaker smiled acidly
there is much business to be transacted this morning and that in a very short time he stated
it be transacted in an informal manner and once a matter of record it will stick
the first matter concerns the recent elections
we have the confession of altara lately president that fraud governed these elections from one end of guanama to the other
does any one wish to dispute this statement
gravelike silence brooded over the senate chamber for a long minute
then well assume that the elections were fraudulent and if any one is contemplating disputing it later on i may say that up to the time i entered this chamber one hundred and nineteen election officials had been arrested since daylight and with the help of the military we hope to gather in the whole seven hundred and something before night
a gasp ran through the assembly
therefore the first piece of informal business before the senate this morning will be to declare the late elections null and void to declare senor ferrata president for another full term and to declare illegal the election of all other officials of every sort whatsoever who came into office for the first time at the recent elections
will that stay put on a vote of this kind
girton asked softly
that ll stay put
mr hemmett assured him
the two best typists in guanama are sitting right in the west retiring rooms with microphone receivers on their ears and reducing this stuff to print as it goes along
before we leave this room the great seal of guanama will have been stuck on it stephen along with the signatures of everybody from ferrata down
matora was on his feet again
senores
let this too be carried by acclamation he cried
a roar of assent arose a volatile obliging lot
hemmett assured them of you havg just voted yourselves out of office
will you kindly rise and walk straight out of that door
your predecessors are waiting to resume their seats
followed five minutes of wildest confusion
the fiftyone having gazed at one another and doubtless reviewed the known events of the last few hours moved toward the door and through the entrance on the other side of senate chamber entered a long file of smiling welldressed unduly important brown gentlemen mustered in by marado late secretary of state
this gathering together of deposed senators had been the hysterical job and he had done it well
nay he had done more for when the room began to calm down a little he was at hemmett s side with a bundle of papers waving his hands and speaking observe my dear senor hemmett
how i have labored
as i ate i dictated
as i rode about gathering these gentlemen i dictated
and now
as i enter the capitoi my splendid zanape hands me these ready
how i have worked for my beloved country
you certainly have old scout
stephen girton agreed as he gazed at the papers over shoulder
they are in good legal form too ready for action now before somebody dynamites the senate chamber
mr hemmett smiled grimly
ferrata
coming as soon as he has finished signing the official complaints demanded by the federal prison that the multitude may be legally held senor beamed marado
hemmett rose again
silence came suddenly
an act rasped mr hemmett
an act to expel from the navy of guanama and from the army of guanama every officer and enlisted man who has served less than two years and every other officer and enlisted man whatever his period of service who shall be unable to prove his absolute loyalty at all times past and present to guanama
the clerk read it and it was sweeping and impressive
it was indeed astonishingly impressive when one remembered that it was composition and when it had been read a vote was taken and the act became a law ready for signature
and again mr hemmett had risen and brought down his gavel
another act said he
an act this time to declare the national engine works confiscated by the government of guanama for its own private purposes hereafter and forever and providing that the nominal incorporators of the said engine works shall receive as indemnity the official valuation they have put on the plant one million dollars united states worth about thirty he added informally and theres no real reason for giving up that one million but it looks better
the act was read
the vote was taken
guanama had another new law
another act continued the speaker pro tern
an act granting immunity to any resident of guanama upon the furnishing of a permanent bond of ten thousand dollars who may confess voluntarily and in detail to his participation in the scheme by which guanama was to have been the naval base of a foreign power and further providing a penalty of life imprisonment for any such resident who may not have confessed and who may be found within the boundaries of guanama fortyeight hours after the signing of this act
there was a hush after the reading of this act and much shifting about
several decidedly pallid faces appeared too yet the act became a law
and still another one hemmett intoned
this act provides that to the last vessel guanama hereby sells to the united states of america every vessel of the guanaman navy as it stands today in every particular and at the price named in the records of the guanaman navy as the purchase price
for example your down as having cost seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars as secondhand junk and thats what the united states pays for her
the fact that shes worth about six million does not figure here at all somebody elses loss but it isnot get in your vote on that mr clerk
it came more slowly this time
there was much waving of hands and much undertone discussion but the gavel came down thrice and hard in the thick of it and they looked at mr hemmett and felt the power of a great republic behind him
the guanaman navy as such ceased to be a rather sweeping bill regarding the character of men who shall be assigned to duty at the coast forts and the general cleaning up of european men and things in the army and political circles but that ll have to be put into better shape before we take action on it continued the speaker pro tern
so i think we can come to the most important piece of work of the morning gentlemen
it is this guanama is about to have a new and a new kind of treaty with the united states
with the help of the american minister well have it drafted and signed before night but the general import of it is this the government of guanama agrees to deposit within one month the sum of one hundred million dollars with the government at washington
yes i thought that would start you yelling smiled the speaker as he hammered his gavel
suitable interest will be paid and the money ll be safer there than here
should the government of guanama at any future time be found guilty of plotting against the welfare of the united states this sum becomes immediately forfeit
and further each of the coast forts will hold permanently one regiment of united states coast artillery supplemented by whatever guanaman troops may be desired by the colonel of that regiment
and still further thundered mr hemmett who was enjoying himself hugely should the united states on proof of continued good behavior decide to resell at cost certain of the naval vessels it is agreed that they shall be officered and partially manned by americans
now holler yourselves hoarse he concluded when the turmoil arose again and see what you make of it
the odd thing is perhaps that when the tumult subsided saner chastened minds were in the ascendency
the terms were ratified
guanama had been spanked
and as foreheads were being mopped and smiling men were talking to scowling men and hands were waving everywhere ferrata president restored hurried into the senate chamber and edward hemmett stretched
my jobs done here ferrata he said simply
take your chair
a so the explosion in guanama came to an end and by evening most of the smoke had cleared away
people with too much on their minds had been leaving town all day three steamers had cleared quite unexpectedly for europe laden down trains for the north and south had been packed too yet now quiet was upon puerto carlo and the residents were strolling down toward the plaza and the evening band concert just as usual talking a little more animatedly perhaps but otherwise moving along quite as they had moved these many years
from the terrace of the hemmett home the owner and steve girton smoked and watched them silently
they had reached the stage of weary relaxation where conversation was distasteful just now they listened thankfully to edward the youngers from the upper floor smiled suddenly and waved to carmen and mercedes as they appeared at the window two young women rather paler than usual and not so prolific in dimples yet two who were recovering splendidly from a terrible experience
the danger was over
guanama ever ready for the psychological somersault had executed a series of them this later afternoon surrounding the house within five minutes after their return cheering hailing them as deliverers of guanama finally permitting the marine band to force its way through the howling thousands and splitting the hot air with excited gusty discord to serenade them
just as they had always been they were a lot of children to be lured this way by a white stick of candy and back again by a striped one
in their lighter moments they were amusing in their darker moods mr hemmett shook his head as he pondered and then rose to meet his fatherinlaw fernandez too was decidedly weary
business men had been besieging him all day long some furiously proposing a league of the righteous and blameless business element others begging hysterically that he aid them in clearing away certain recent smudges on their reputations
you are national heroes again edward he smiled
you and stephen
circumstances have a way of taking the taste out of that job mr hemmett said rather sourly
i know but it was wonderful nevertheless murmured fernandez
you gripped the whole thing so amazingly you thrust through laws even before the senators could catch their breath and protest
ah yes
guanama may well be proud of you both
mr girton smiled
considering the time weve lived here and the money we have invested here and all the rest of it a darned sight rather be proud of guanama he remarked
true enough and doubtless some day you shall be sighed fernandez
jones ay de mi it is not to be believed jones is dead and canita with him and it is said that of the corrupt fivesixths have already fled
and so guanama is purged and purified
and you two will become citizens as you have said
he waved his hands placidly
edward hemmett looked suddenly at stephen girton and discovered that girton was eying him narrowly
and as had happened many times before there was no need of words between them
mr hemmett smiled and shook his head
well a great little country he said
we owe a lot to guanama and she owes a lot to us and there are lots of things about guanama that i like pretty well but i guess not
but edward cried his fatherinlaw
living here in business here with wives of guanaman blood you do not mean he paused before steady smile
the speaker pro tern had laid a hand upon his knee
i mean said he and the odd emotion of patriotism clogged his voice a little that all right and everything else is all right
but afraid that we steve and i well afraid that were just americans after all first time bronson spoke to her sheila decided that he was unlike any man she had ever known
he had been about the office for several days a great broadshouldered fellow whose very voice was tuned to the and as accustomed as they all were to men from the west john bronson was a man good to look upon as he went about his business
there were some of the girls who laughed at him he was not the fashion of the figure that they worshipped in their favorite movies but not so with sheila
she knew in a moment that he was the type of man her ancestors had been redblooded individuals who did not need gaudy neckties nor suede tops to their shoes to make their women love them
their first conversation had taken place while bronson was waiting to get into mr room bronson as was the habit of the men who were practically visitors came wandering into the office and stood looking down at fingers as they scarcely touched the keys of her machine
some different from the way we do things in my country
sheila did not answer him at once she finished the letter and then looking up into his face asked him where his country was and if he didnot hate the city
hate it
he shrugged his shoulders
no only people who live in the city hate the place
folks like i am know they donot have to stay here its a lark to us
only people that live in cities hate them sheila was thinking aloud at the same time mechanically arranging her papers for the next letter
yes i think youre right and lived here forever and forever
an insistent telephonebell called her then and bronson left the room
however when he saw hamilton the head of the company that was disposing of his cattle for him he asked about the little blackeyed girl who had a desk in the room at the end of the hall
who sheila
why shes secretary
philipse is head of the sales department and i guess he couldnot get on without sheila been here some time and to be truthful with you its rather interesting to me to watch those two
i used to think that they were in love but i guess not for philipse has taken a wife and sheila is still sheila
why did you ask about her
nothing
come bronson confess been talking to her and think shes the quickest brightest little girl youve ever seen
i know an old man but i am still able to recognize one of little ladies
if i wasnot afraid by the color of your face that youd propose to her and disrupt my sales department send for her and give you a proper introduction
i wish you would bronson spoke before he realized it and hamilton laughed heartily
i will just to prevent you from putting her over your shoulder and walking off with her
and remember bronson shes a product of civilization not a cavewoman from your native bad lands
hamilton pressed the button that summoned his secretary and asked for miss he sat back in his chair and smiled at efforts to be unconcerned thinking the while that sheila would laugh at the cattleman
miss this is mr bronson
hamilton introduced them been asking about you and i havenot told him much
i am going to let you have first advantage and say hes a great big boy whos never been east of st louis before in his life got a cattle ranch and half a million dollars a good disposition and absolutely no knowledge of the polite way to talk to a lady
oh come mr hamilton bronson broke in admit to part of that speech but i do make objection to the end of it
and so do sheila added
you see hes spoken to me already
yes and his conscience pricked him so that he demanded this introduction
poor bronson
his hands twisted the pencil he had picked from desk and he tried to hide his discomfort by smiling
hamilton his keen sense for laughable situations photographing both expressions was thinking what a splendid story it would make to tell at the club
really its most rude of mr ham412 ilton to make fun of you and of me sheila said
if it werenot that worked here for such a very long time that i know mr hamilton like almost like a father be angry very glad to have met you mr bronson and now got to run to finish mr work
where is philipse mood had dropped in an instant and the girl responded he went to the jersey yards to look over the new landing facilities they wrote about and on the way back hell stop at the erie office spending the day investigating railroad conditions cheaper shipments mean cheaper deliveries
hamilton nodded
you keep close tabs on him donot you
the girl replied with a quick nod a flush slowly creeping up over her face as she turned and hurriedly left the room
bronson was busy the rest of the afternoon
he had much to discuss with the man who represented him in the east and had full care of all his money transactions
there were moments however when he thought of the little darkeyed girl in the sales department and wondered if propriety allowed him to ask her to spend the evening with him
mr and mrs hamilton both of them twenty years his senior had tried to show him the town but just once he would like to go to a restaurant with a young woman
he did not dance at least not the dances that could be performed on the floor of the fashionable new york cafes but he wanted some one who would smile at him laugh with him and make a fitting picture for the frame of lights and colors that was called a room
he was still questioning his courage when hamilton announced that he was going home
coming uptown with me he asked and bronson quickly found an imaginary excuse to wait
other nights he had been only too anxious to get away from the bewildering efficiency that was responsible for the firms success he wanted to linger and possibly speak again with sheila
it was almost five oclock and everywhere there were preparations for the end of the day before he could summon enough courage to go into the office of the salesmanager
he passed the door twice and finally entered
sheila was there but not alone
oh mr bronson come in this is mr philipse
the two men shook hands each quickly appraising the other
bronson saw a slender man of some thirtytwo or three immaculately dressed in rather flashy clothing
he did not trust the brown eyes that held his own for a short time and then moved away and there was only contempt for the little waxed mustache stranger in the city
philipse asked
i think i heard that you were to be here
how do you like it
not much bronson said quietly seen a few nice things since been here and plenty that i donot care for that true of every locality sure i should hate your native west
bronson nodded
the highpitched voice with the carefully spoken words would be laughable in the land he called home
he could not help but think of the guying that this man would get if he should ever stumble upon a roundup
i trust youll excuse me philipse kept on got to sign these letters in a hurry my car is waiting for me
going up town be glad to give you a lift
no thanks not quite finished for the night and bronson crossed to the window out of the circle of light shed by desk lamp
he heard philipse issuing orders in a peremptory tone and wondered how it was that he dared speak to such a girl as sheila in that manner
pie shook his head and looked out of the window down the canon of beaver street the lighted buildings looming with a grandeur that was almost equal to the canons he knew
he waited there till philipse had finished then watched him put on his overcoat and depart
i donot think much of that fellow he told sheila
somehow i wouldnot trust him much more than i would a snake
mr philipse is very very clever sheila said after a second one of the best salesmen in the city
salesmen yes but if youd have said best man i should have doubted the worth of your city
the girl laughed
she was busy folding the letters her small thin fingers moving with a rapidity that fascinated the watcher
you are very frank mr bronson most of you men who live are brutal about telling the truth
why not
you see nature is our real mistress she never lies
i wonder if youd think i was too frank if i was to say that i like you a lot and wanted you to go out to dinner with me
the girl sent a quick look that went straight into eyes
for a minute their gaze was steady and then the girl let her eyes rest on the mail she was folding
i donot think i ought to go mr bronson
you see only just met you and i havenot any one i could ask as a chaperon
do they really have chaperons outside of books
bronson inquired with an amused smile
even if they do like just one dinner when there would be some one to talk with that is some one like to talk with afraid putting my invitation in a jumble of words but i wish youd eat with me
sheila laughed
you speak as if you had been lonesome these past few days
lonesome never thought of it in that light but i guess thats the trouble been hanging about with mr and mrs hamilton but theyre old and they donot hate the city
why lady i canot talk to you i canot seem to say what i want to but honest to goodness try to be a gentleman never yet had to be ashamed of the way i treated a woman
sheila believed him
you see the real trouble is that if i were to go with you some one might think it odd
you mean they might think and say something wrong of you
there was aggression as well as surprise in his tone
yes just that
and youd like to go if it wasnot for what might be said like to go very very much be very truthful with mr bronson and say that your invitation is very tempting and whats more going to accept
fine
he stepped forward his face alight with boyish enthusiasm
yes going to let you call for me at seven oclock
that ll give me half an hour to get home and an hour to dress
if youll have a taxi wear my party gown and my lovely silver slippers
see just as enthusiastic as can be even if i have only known you a few hours
five minutes later she was giving bronson the address refusing to let him send her home in a taxi
while she had been putting on her hat she wondered why she had accepted the invitation but bronson was so much of a man and mr hamilton had truly introduced them that in spite of what she feared was her better judgment she did not tell him that she had changed her mind
it was exactly seven when the maid announced that mr bronson was calling and should she let him wait in the parlor downstairs or should she bring him up to sittingroom
bring him up nora going to let him see my green lampshade and the piece of rock that came off the blarney stone
nora irish herself was laughing as she showed bronson the way and thinking all the while that it was a fine boy who was calling on miss all ready sheila greeted him from the doorway
but just vain enough to ask you to come and see my rooms
when i first came here to live i had a back room on the fourth floor but each time mr hamilton gave me a raise i got a little nearer the front door and last year i got these two honesttogoodness rooms one flight up and i furnished them myself such fun having your own sittingroom
but bronson was not looking at the room his eyes were all for sheila
for three days he had seen her a trim little miss in clothes but she was no longer secretary to the salesmanager
she was a sprite whose garments were blue and silver a silver cord in her hair and silver shoes and stockings on her feet eat me she laughed
say good evening and if you look so hard at my dress think theres a hole in it
i think that that youre about the most wonderful girl ever met bronson said gravely
hush or think youre irish and have kissed the blarney stone
my uncle was there once he brought me back a chip he picked up and i kiss it most every day
she left him for a moment to get her coat and bronson looked critically about the room
he was not used to a womans room women never had played a very great part in his life since he had been old enough to ride away from his fathers chbin
now he looked about him at the silken draperies at the wicker furniture and at the few pictures that were on the walls
i donot see how you can hate this place he said when sheila was with him again
i donot see how you could ever wish to leave it pretty but to me it stands for so many disappointments so many days when i wished i was dead
sometimes when i count the cost like to pile it all up and burn it
bronson did not understand and said so a long long story mr bronson afraid it wouldnot interest you at all go very very hungry
it was after midnight when bronson left her and sheila decided that the evening had been a decided success
they had dined at a noisy restaurant where the cabaret was famous had been to see her favorite musical comedy star and then had supper at the quietest and most fashionable hotel in the city this being choice
still the girl was not happy for a spirit of discontent had filled her
it was not that she longed for a chance to live in the pleasurefilled world that she had just seen but she wished to run away from the life she knew out to the broad existence that bronson pictured
their conversation had been largely personal
with frank curiosity they had questioned each other as to their lives
sheila had told about her parents her life at the convent and of going to work at seventeen story was not altogether different
he had started on the lowest rung of the ladder and climbed up hand over hand
only the settings were different the stories were about the same
sheila did not see it in that light however she was thinking of the little annoyances that had filled her life and of the confinement
she tried to reason it out that any existence might become monotonous after a time she even tried to think that every community might hold its philipse
philipse face drew into a grim line when she thought of philipse
she knew that he had been largely responsible for the luxury she now enjoyed for as his secretary she received thirtyfive dollars a week
she tried to tell herself that philipse was only a business employer that everything else between them was over
once she had believed that to be the case but tonight how could she deny the fact she knew to be the truth
with a sudden jump she sprang onto her bed and snapped out the light
good night she said aloud a custom that had grown on her and intended to hide her loneliness from herself another day and who can tell
ten minutes later she was asleep and not even her dreams told her that in his big hotel room bronson was smoking his goodnight cigar and wondering if miss sheila would be contented in a ranch house till he could build a place fitting for such a lady
the more bronson saw of john philipse the less he liked him
and the more he spoke to sheila about philipse the more annoyed he became for she would say nothing about the man
bronson however could see that sheila was not happy at her work
he was trained to know a sensitive horse or to guess the reason why cattle were restless
it was this knowledge that told him sheila was unhappy
to him she seemed a frightened animal like his big bay horse that always shied at the tompkins crossroads because of the bit of newspaper that had blown in her face the first time he drove her down that way
it was wednesday afternoon when bronson and sheila first met and as bronson explained it the following afternoon he was going home on saturday and he didnot want to lose any time in talking
he had to work during the day but his evenings were free
i know its sort of rushing you but then thats what i want to do he confessed
please donot say that i canot see you tonight
sheila after a minutes thought told him that he might call on her
bronson would have preferred another theater and supper party but sheila was firm
he could call on her for an hour or so and she would ask miss goode the schoolteacher who lived on the third floor to come in and make a welsh rabbit ask a few other people and have a party
you see if you donot go anywhere but to theater and cabarets youll never know what we new yorkers are like at home so just let you meet half a dozen real ones the kind of people who only go to the theater once a month and then sit in the balcony
bronson was willing anything as long as it meant he could be near sheila and he hurried through his solitary dinner and then waited a lonesome hour till it vas eight oclock
he was the first of guests to arrive
if she had been a sprite the night before she was miss simplicity this evening
her dress was dark linen with collar and cuffs of white and her hair was twisted low on her neck giving her the appearance of a country miss to whom the outsideworld is a legend
now you look like my people bronson said in greeting not letting go of the hand she offered him
now you look as you would if you came from the ranchhouse to meet me
sheila started and drew away her hand
i suppose i shouldnot have said that not what you might call really cultured and i canot help being natural and saying what i think
and you think i belong in a ranchhouse
yes in mine but i suppose youll end up by living in a tenstory apartment with some fellow like philipse
a flush crept over face
please donot talk about him
i want to be very happy tonight and forget all about everything that isnot pleasant
oh so philipse isnot a pleasant subject
now look here little lady if you just say the word break every bone in that chaps body
i know hes a married man and i know he used to be kind of sweet on you
what did he do throw you over
just say the word and mr bronson head went very high
please remember that it isnot quite the thing for you to say that philipse threw me over its insulting
bronson was nonplused
i didnot didnot mean to be insulting he faltered
i hope youll forgive me
yes under the condition that you donot speak about mr philipse again
i promise
there was a moment of strained silence bronson picked up a book and turned the pages and then miss goode came in and eased the tenseness of the atmosphere
even if he had promised not to speak about philipse bronson did a great deal of thinking and as if his questions were incidental he asked mr hamilton to tell him something of the man
hamilton had little to say
he was a splendid salesman married his wife was supposed to be rich and there the story stopped save for business details which were many and all to credit
at noontime finding sheila alone bronson reminded her that he had only one more evening in town and asked her if it couldnot be celebrated in what he termed a bangup manner
sheila hesitated before answering
since the previous night she had rather feared to be alone with bronson
still his very presence in the office was enjoyable
she had smiled many times at his eagerness to break every bone in body there was something about bronson which made her feel that he would really do such a thing if she demanded
sheila did not know it or rather would not admit it but bronson had come to mean much to her in the past two days
she was modem enough to scoff at love at first sight and yet i would like to go she said simply
only lets see something big and gripping
i donot feel like silly tinkly entertainment tonight
they chose the play and bronson sent for tickets
now you put on your pretty dress again and well have a bangup supper anywhere you say
this is going to be an evening to remember the rest of our lives
at closing time however sheila told bronson that they would have to forego the dinnerparty
mr philipse wants a report got out tonight have it finished in an hour and you can call for me in time for the theater sorry but the report is mighty urgent it go over till morning he asked
mr philipse wants it mailed tonight
what is it
i donot know
he hasnot told me yet
then going to tell him to get some one else to do it
no please donot
just you go right along and call for me about half past seven no make it quarter past and then we can have coffee at one of the hotels and pretend we had a wonderful dinner be time if you get there at quarter past
quarter past bronson repeated sharply and went back to room for his coat and hat
the office was almost deserted now the latergoers hurrying with their work
he debated a minute and then went to the elevator
he walked slowly the length of the block and then turned with brisker steps in the direction of broadway
at the subway entrance he paused again
what right had philipse to want a report on this of all nights
this time tomorrow he bronson would be speeding westward and philipse could have all the reports he wanted unless bronson had been used to having his way that was why his cattle were famous everywhere that cattle were bought and sold
was he going to let philipse thwart him now
he stamped his heel against the cement pavement and headed with brisk steps to the office
he was going to take sheila away with him if he had to break every typewriting machine in the office
he was going to take sheila away with him if the very thought that came to him that minute was overpowering
he laughed aloud startling two or three people who were near him
he almost ran into the building his steps reeling as if be were intoxicated
he was going to take sheila away with him
not only tonight but forever
what did he care for conventions
nature demanded no chaperon and long engagements
he was natures son why should he care for manmade laws
he reached the eighteenth floor and hurried down the long corridor
the officedoors were open for a horde of cleaning women had come out of nowhere and were busy making the rooms ready for the following day
he skirted a pile of wastepaper and stepped over a pail of hot water
most of the offices were dark but a bright light shone through the glass partitions about philipse s sanctum
the door was partly closed and as bronson started to push it open he heard his name mentioned and hesitated sorry you had to disappoint bronson but then i wanted to talk to you philipse was saying
then there wasnot a report after all voice was choked with anger
yes a report one to be settled between ourselves been asking you to go out with me for two weeks and you wouldnot
yet you let this lout of a plainsman tow you all about town the game
bronson shifted uneasily wondering if he had better stay concealed or whether to break into the room and thrash philipse within an inch of his life
he heard a quick movement and voice verging on tears
please be man enough to stand aside and let me go
go nothing youre going to stay in the corner there till you promise me youll take my terms been mighty decent to you
i love you
you degenerate cad
you a married man to talk to me like that
i loved you once and you married a woman who could give you polo ponies and a racingcar stopped loving you forever
but i never loved my wife
well at least you ought to be decent to her
if you donot let me pass this minute tell mr hamilton the whole story in the morning and tell your wife right afterward
and donot you suppose i could tell my story you suppose hamilton is wise to why i went to him three times in six months and had your salary raised
you poor little fool even this man bronson knows
you say hamilton introduced you well bronson wanted a good time and hamilton knew the girl to send for
you know you lie
the words were a low moan from heart and she reeled as if struck
philipse moved forward to meet her but a hand on his shoulder sent him sprawling to the floor movements had been as the whirlwind and it was his arms that closed about sheila
for a minute there was no sound
philipse picked himself up from the floor and his hands sought the back of a small chair
sheila was sobbing noiselessly against coat
well
philipse asked after a minute
he was a good talker and might brazen himself out of this situation
i donot give a damn if what you said a minute ago was true bronson said slowly
i donot believe it
it wouldnot make any difference if it was true but its about the last rough talk youll ever pull to any woman hands gripped tighter the back of the chair and swung it a few inches from the floor
put it down
bronson roared without moving and philipse obeyed
now you whitelivered snake going to tell you something and then probably thrash your soul to hell
sheila shuddered and lifted her head arm was still about her and she made no effort to move from his embrace
this party makes me think of fifteen years ago when i was a kid and just starting out to earn my way
there were a bunch of cattlemen in our neighborhood and the wolves were bothering their calves and getting an occasional twoyearold
it was bad business and they offered me my first regular salary to kill all the pests
the wolfer thats the name they gave me in the neighborhood and the wolfer is what they me today
and you know philipse in the last halfhour come to think that a wolfer is what is needed right here in this city you folks are so proud of
they need them for fellows like you
out in my country they look on a wolf as about the lowest thing god made but if theyd ever heard you tonight theyd take off their hats in respect every time they saw a wolftrack in the snow
bronson moved a quick step forward his hands clenched
philipse started and his hands sought the chairback
with a lightninglike move bronson pulled the chair from his grasp kill donot
sheila cried and she tugged at the arm that bronson was lifting to strike
he isnot worth killing
bronson looked from the cowering whitelipped philipse to sheila
i guess maybe youre right
it would mess things up and weve got to get away tomorrow
philipse straightened perceptibly
now you get and if i ever see your face again it ll be just as if caught a wolf in a trap death and with one threatening shove he sent philipse hatless and coatless into the darkened corridor of the office
i donot know how i can thank you sheila whispered after a minute
both for what youve done and what you said
about not caring whether what philipse said was true
she nodded
once i thought i loved him
yes i heard all that
and about the money
yes and mr introduction
he lied about me as he lied about you
now canot we shake and forget about him
he offered her his hand
she took the big hand that seemed to hide her own in its palm glad you were a wolfer once she told him smiling through her tearstained eyes
and now going to ask you to please let me off from tonights party tired and like to be alone face mirrored his disappointment
if youd rather not go he said slowly and then but before you leave me i want to tell you something about a calf i picked up once after shot two wolves that were getting ready to enjoy a good meal
the calf had a tear in its foreleg so i took it home with me halfcarried it most of the way and the men the animal belonged to thought it was such a joke that they gave it to me for my own
it was the first head of cattle i ever owned the very first and old mrs calf is still living out there at sunrise and got a painting of her in the ranch hallway
now you know he stopped a minute when i came back here tonight it was to tell you that i wanted you to stop having to do things for philipse
to tell you in good allround a united states that i loved you and wanted you to marry me tomorrow
and you know when i beat off that wolf it made me think that that i was your pet calf tears were banished by her laughter
bronson was crestfallen
i wasnot thinking to insult you any only i canot tell a story the way it ought to be
i shouldnot have laughed the trouble with us that are irish we laugh most of the time and sometimes at the wrong time
but i guess you were laughing at something funny then it must be funny to hear me tell you that i love you
funny
do you suppose old mrs calf thought it was funny when you half dragged her home after killing the wolves you remember that song we heard the other night when the right man comes along
sheila lifted her face to her eyes glowing with light
you mean he asked wonderingly
i mean wolfer that well go to dinner and then have to pack if were going away tomorrow night
a and fortysecond street an hour and a half by train two separate worlds in ideals and traditions
the motto of west point is honor valor country
fortysecond street has many slogans but none of them is just like that
neither is early to bed and early to rise
at west point reveille has long since sounded and the work of the day is on at full swing before fortysecond street has awakened to much more show of life than the rumbling of the morning milkcarts
as to being healthy wealthy and wise well maybe west point scores on the first count but when it somes to gathering in the mazuma or proving up as wise guys where have the soldier boys got even a lookin
to tell the truth they rate in the eyes of fortysecond street as little better than a bunch of comeons
take for instance the case of cadet kerr mosely and miss queenie sinclair
this kerr mosely mind you too was rated as some pumpkins in the corps
he was halfback on the football team close up to the top of the list in class standing a soldier every inch of him and the leader in every mischievous prank or bit of deviltry that was going a stalwart redheaded young giant who could outride outbox outshoot and outflirt any other man at the academy the idol of his fellows and a terror to the tacs
and queenie sinclair was just a hasbeen of a chorus girl some people said that she had been in the first production of erminie at the casino way back in eighteen hundred and frozetodeath but that may have been slander she looked like a cross between a colored comic supplement and the ruins of blarney castle
but at that she put it over this mosely silas seven ways from sunday
fortysecond street for you also the female of the species
not of course that the scheme was of contriving
like most dear old grandmothers of today she was brilliant enough of hair and complexion too brilliant to be true but even best friends could never have rated the glimmer of her mental attainments at more than half a kilowatt
no it was tommy wilburt who doped out the great idea tommy wilburt a former pressagent but now one of those lilies of broadway tiger lilies that toil not neither do they spin yet in some mysterious manner manage to exist
his inventive genius spurred by certain trenchant remarks on the part of his landlady and the knowledge that his bankroll had dwindled to one lone fish folded away in the corner of his waistcoatpocket had worked out the project during the watches of a more or less sleepless night and as he started out the next morning for breakfast he felt that all he needed was a suitable instrument
strange are the ways of destiny
if mr wilburt had possessed even so much as a dollar and a quarter he would probably have chanced eating at one of the sumptuous places on main street but that single lone bone drove him to economy and to the sixth avenue bakery where queenie sinclair was fortifying herself with rolls and coffee for her weary daily round of the managers offices
queenie was very much at liberty which is the polite theatrical term for out of a job
even the burlesque shows and the tabloid musical comedies of vaudeville must draw the age limit somewhere and as one outspoken producer had told her only the day before broilers were using in this show queenie not soup stock
in short she was in a desperate and bitter mood ripe for almost any proposal from manslaughter down and mr wilburt as his eye encountered her along the line of marbletopped tables and noted the defiant tilt to her hat instinctively recognized the fact
he sauntered over and seated himself across from her
hello kid
he affected a tone of glad surprise
how re they coming
queenie drew herself up haughtily prepared to resent the advances of a mere beanery patron but rather puffy face and protuberant light eyes stirred a chord of memory
why if it ainot mr wilburt
she melted
i ainot saw you since that summer opera snap what mannheimer took out
yes and you got a raw deal that time if any one ever did tommy protested eagerly
i told mannheimer he was making the mistake of his life when he canned you to put that swede chambermaid in for leader of the march and canned
miss sinclair interrupted shrilly
never think that no stiff the size of mannheimer ever done nothing like that to me
i got a better offer to join out with the girl from dayton company and i quit him
mr wilburt realized his mistake and hastened to retrieve himself
just another lie of eh he nodded
well donot you care kid
a knock from him is always a boost a and anyhow its all ancient history now
by the way what are you doing these days queenie
me
her tone of careless ease was only too obviously a pretense
oh resting a week or two
the pictures is after me hard but i canot just see it
they say them studio lights is something fierce on the eyes
then theres a girl show that i been offered a swell part in and but wilburt was in no humor to listen to a long list of mythical prospective engagements
say look here kid he cut in got a part that i believe you can play
it ainot strictly professional he glanced at her narrowly across the platter of ham and eggs which had just been set before him but theres a bunch of coin to be made if its handled right
the significance of that look and of his tone was not lost upon her
she hesitated a moment then she twitched her shoulders with a reckless movement and gave an unsteady laugh
a bunch of coin what were all after ainot it
go ahead and shoot mr man your layout
for answer tommy extracted a newspaper clipping from his pocketbook and handed it across to her
it was the story of a west point cadet who had been expelled from the academy for marrying what gave me the suggestion explained mr wilburt after he had read the story
but queenie only looked puzzled
i donot get your idea at all
she shook her head
where is there any money in getting the rollers put under a cadet
are you wise to another stunt of the kind and want me to tip it off
is that it
no no
wilburt shrugged impatiently
on the contrary i want to pull off a wedding which shall be a dead secret
and you queenie i have cast to be the bride
she stared at him a moment then with the suspicion that he was merely hoaxing her an angry red overswept the rouge upon her cheeks and her eyes took on a vicious glitter
trying to kid me are you
her voice trembled
why you miserable rat and she reached for her cup of coffee if i wasnot too much of a lady dash this in your ugly grinning mug you hold on
tommy protested hastily not joshing you
this is on the level sinclair
i really do want you to hook up with one of these guys in a secret marriage
i theres money in the proposition
money she scoffed
why them cadets only have fifty cents a week spending money
i know cause i boarded in a family once what had a boy at west point
and marry one of them
no thank you i ainot looking for no children to raise just at present
besides she stopped abruptly as if checking herself in something she had been about to say
besides she went on a trifle lamely whats that old saying about catching your rabbit before you cook him
where am i going to get my cadet
he picked up the morning paper which lay beside his plate and folding it over so as to disclose the headlines dealing with the armynavy football game scheduled for that day passed it across to her
where will you get a cadet he repeated
why the town will be full of them tonight and as the chances are about six to one that the army is going to win theyll all probably be in high good humor
if you do as i tell you old girl you can land any of em
but theres one in particular that out after
he considered a moment then taking back his paper made a checkmark with his pencil opposite one of the names in the lineup of the army team
kerr mosely she questioned as she read the name he had indicated
wilburt nodded
what you got against him
nothing tommy laughed except that hes the only son of old george mosely united states senator from california and generally known as the rockefeller of the pacific coast
now do you begin to get a line on the workings of the plot little one
you mean that if i marry this cutie the old man will pay to get rid of me
yes to get rid of you and avoid all the scandal and publicity that would come from having his son fired come across for a million
and they canot do anything to me for it she demanded warily
arrest me for kidnaping or anything like that
not a chance
tommy brushed the suggestion aside with a wave of the hand
this boys of full age twentythree years old
he can tie himself up to mr wilburt searched his imagination for something to stand as a totally impossible bride but nothing occurring to him as worse than miss sinclair he ended by simply saying you
he can tie himself up to you and nobodys got a right to question it
besides their one effort will be to keep the thing quiet
queenie stirred her coffee thoughtfully
give me the sketch she said
how do we land him
easy as fish for friday
catch him on the old chivalry gag protest a womans honor and all that sort of thing
you make up for an ingenue part understand curls and ruffles and giggles of sweet sixteen
you can do it all right
i remember a bit you had with the mannheimer show that was just the type i want
only for sake tone down that makeup of yours
this doll is supposed to be a shy clinging homebody not a belle of the manicure parlor
you leave that to me miss sinclair interrupted impatiently
get down to the action
what happens
well its like this at a dance place with your cousin i can get some chorus man with a dresssuit to do that part of it for ten or fifteen dollars and youre just as excited as can be over the novel experience of being out at such a place at night
then i come along with mosely and stop to speak to cousin
he introduces us to you and insists that we sit down at your table
then you know this mosely already broke in queenie
know him
no
but make his acquaintance today never fear and manage to steer him to that dancejoint too you worry about my part of it just pay attention to what i tell you and figure on what youve got to do yourself see where was i at
oh yes
cousin introduces us and we sit down at your table
then after a few minutes cousin excuses himself and fades saying hell be back shortly
you and mosely have a dance or two
you play up to him but not too strong understand just the sort of fluttering interest that a girl of sixteen would show toward brass buttons and for the love of mike say as little as possible a regular anna held with those eyes of yours queenie but you know well enough conversation ainot your long suit now the real work of the piece commences
cousin doesnot come back
you begin to get worried and uneasy ask what time it is and when you find it is after midnight look scared and wonder what papa will say
i volunteer to go hunt cousin up and come back looking grave
i draw mosely aside and whisper that cousin has got a bun on and has gone off with a crowd of rahrah boys
the rotten souse i say hes apt never to think of this little girl again got to get a taxi and take her home
so into a taxi the three of us pile and speed it up to old house on ninetyfourth street
dilsey comes to the door himself in dressinggown and slippers playing the heavy parent there he snarls me papa you say
these gentlemen brought me home
then you try to slip by him but he bars the way and puts up a roar that a makes the fathers curse in hazel kirke sound like qod bless you
you plead with him and we argue but we might as well talk to a stone
never shall you cross that threshold again he declares until you can do so with a marriage certificate in your hand
then he goes inside and slams the door in your face
what are we to d bawling and crying telling us theres no place for you but the river and so i put it squarely up to mosely that the only honorable thing for him is to marry you
a divorce can easily be arranged later i tell him but in order to protect this poor childs good name and save her from a suicides grave somebody must go through at least the form of a wedding with her do it myself i say but unfortunately i already have a wife so it looks as if you were elected
and you expect him to fall for a game of bunk like that queried the chorus girl scornfully
my dear its been my business to peddle bunk around this town for many years and i never yet fell down on anything i really wanted to put across seen older and wiser men than this cadet fall for stuff that was fifty times rawer than this is
no sister the one gift i have is a persuasive tongue and if youll only play up to your end of it willing to guarantee that i can coax him in front of a justice of the peace over in hoboken and that youll be mrs kerr mosely by this time tomorrow
again queenie musingly stirred her coffee
how much real money can you hold the old man up for she questioned
i donot want to hear about millions but what hell actually give up
well we ought to get fifty thousand dollars at the very least averred mr wilburt
and how are you planning to cut it she bargained
four ways
equal shares to me and you and dilsey and a fourth share to the lawyer that well need to conduct the negotiations and collect the money for us
miss sinclair drained the last of her coffee and set down the empty cup with an air of decision
twelve thousand five hundred for mine eh she calculated
all right tommy
bring on your cadet
tommy wilburt had predicted west point won the armynavy football game that day and consequently when the victorious team returned home the following afternoon the reservation rang with shouts of exultation and long after taps were sounded the barracks still continued to celebrate its triumph the authorities for once winking at the breach of regulations
but the one man whose name was on everybodys tongue and who more than any other had helped accomplish defeat took but little part in the general jubilation got the goat sang out a cheer leader as the hero of the occasion appeared in the quadrangle
and the admiring corps crowding around in congratulation chorused back mosely
mosely
spell it out shrieked the cheerleader and five hundred lusty throats chanted in a great volume of sound they would have carried him on their shoulders in their exuberance but he shrank back from the ovation and instead of seeming gratified acted as if he wanted to run away
as soon as might be indeed he did make his escape and slipping off to his quarters where none could intrude save his faithful roommate darwin remained there in gloomy seclusion
hanged if i know whats got into him
darwin reported to a group of in424 quiring comrades later in the evening think to see him that hed chucked the game for the team instead of winning it practically singlehanded
he just stands there staring out of the window with nothing more to say than a particularly reticent clam
if he wasnot so allfired fit think he was starting in on a sickness
why just to show you how hes behaving darwin went on he got a telegram from his dad tonight
just the one word congratulations it was but the way he looked youd have thought it was a death warrant
he went white when he read it and i believed for a minute he was going to faint
then he sort of caught himself together
oh its the game he means he muttered
yet what else could he have supposed the old man was wiring him congratulations about
pshaw probably only the effect of coming off training suggested one of the others consolingly seen fellows go queer before because of that and kerr has been sticking to it pretty close you know
give him a day or two and hell come around all right
but a day or two passed and a month or two passed and still cadet mosely maintained that glum and repellent attitude toward his world
from being perhaps the most frankly sociable and genial chap in the whole corps he degenerated into a recluse and a grouch
he acts to me like a sort of eugene aram said one keenwitted chap in discussing the change one of those guys you know thats got a guilty secret on his mind
half the time he goes mooning along without noticing anybody or anything and then if you happen to speak to him suddenly or unexpectedly hell almost jump out of his skin
there was the more opportunity to observe and speculate upon the former favorites altered demeanor because there was little else to occupy the attention of the cadets in their hours of leisure
it was a bitterly cold winter that year starting in just after the armynavy game in the west point calendar everything dates from that and lasting unbroken until now late in february the river still lay sheathed in ice the snow was piled deep across the plain the biting winds of the highlands whooped and whistled around corners and through sallyports and the gothic buildings showed along the spouting and eaves grotesque gargoyles and projections which the architect never planned
visitors to the post were few and the ordinary entertainments of the season in consequence languished
it was a dull depressing period during which both the cadets and the officers in charge of them chafed under the monotony of their routine
various reckless outbreaks and escapades on the part of the corps were a natural result of these conditions and proportionately there was a steady increase to the ranks of the area birds those offenders against military discipline who for their sins are compelled during recreation hours to pace the quadrangular courtyard of barracks chins up guns a shoulder and at a quickstep
ordinarily kerr could hardly have escaped this dragnet and with the others would have been trudging a fivehour stretch in the bleak quadrangle on wednesday and saturday afternoons but this year he was too absorbed and indifferent to join in any of the lawlessness
not so though his roommate
darwin was mixed up in nearly everything going and although for a time he managed to evade the vigilance of the tacs was finally gathered in and given a sentence a circumstance which strange as it may seem was materially to affect the ambitious plans of mr tommy wilburt and miss queenie sinclair
widely separate worlds west point asid fortysecond street may be but just as a stone cast into a lake will cause an everwidening ripple that spreads until it reaches the farther shore the little incident up the hudson was not to be unfelt in the land of the bright lights
a so far the project of the two schemers for annexing a wad of the elder wealth had been progressing as smoothly and expeditiously as even they could have desired
the lawyer they had retained an artist at blackmail within the forms of the statutes had already opened negotiations with father and the latter having come to west point and satisfied himself by a rather painful interview with his son that the marriage had actually occurred was now bargaining with the plotters to have the union dissolved and the whole distasteful business definitely closed up a plain holdup he growled to his attorney
kerr had never seen the woman before he was introduced to her a the dancehall he left her at the altar
they inveigled him into the ceremony solely through his foolish sense of chivalry
yet what can we do
they know that publicity in the matter would ruin my boys career
we must simply settle with the woman as cheaply as we can and then get her off to reno or some place where this farcical marriage knot can be quietly untied
the lawyer was an adept at extricating the sons of his wealthy clients from the scraps into which they managed to get
this was not the first time he had dealt with chorusgirl brides by suggesting financial balm as a salve for their broken hearts
but he had to confess that miss queenie sinclair coached as she was by tommy wilburt and the shady legal adviser was just about the toughest proposition he had ever encountered
it was last chance to play the role of a trusting and deserted damsel and recognizing the fact she was determined to make the most of it
the lawyer had finally to report to senator mosely that an even was the very lowest settlement that he could effect
the senator knitted his brows a moment then he wrote out a check for the amount and pushed it across the table to the lawyer
some price for chivalry eh
but i canot afford to haggle any longer
tell my he made a wry face that the money is hers as soon as the courts have done their work
but the bestlaid plans of millionaires and also of blackmailers sometimes gang agley
papa rosy belief that he had disposed of the affair by signing that check and likewise the dream of easy affluence in which the sinclairwilburt combination was indulging were both due for a jolt
it fell about in this wise
kerr hurrying back to his quarters one snowy afternoon was halted by one of the disciplinary officers a lieutenant named crosby who had been his cadet captain when mosely was a plebe and against whom the latter consequently cherished an undying hatred
crosby was exulting over the fact that he had finally succeeded in landing the luckless darwin among the area birds and he could not resist the temptation to rub it in on closest associate
ah mr mosely he said with a malicious grin
i just saw your wife over at headquarters having an interview with the colonel
i expect youll be wanted next
if ever there was a case of a guilty conscience proving a mans undoing it was then
kerr gave a start which almost split his tightly buttoned fatigueblouse up the back and turned as many colors as a chameleon on a piece of plaid
my wife he gasped in consternation
is that woman actually here at the post
the next moment he could have cheerfully bitten his tongue out for he realized from stare of utter amazement that the other in speaking of his wife had only been using the west point slang term for roommate
it was too late now though to recall or amend the fatal admission
the astonishment in fishy eyes had al426 ready changed to a gleam of malevolent satisfaction
so
the lieutenant significantly drew his notebook from his pocket and penciled an entry
i wasnot far wrong was when i said the colonel would likely be wanting to see you too
in fact i guess you would better come right along with me and have your talk with him now
there was no help for it
over to headquarters kerr was marched and ushered into the presence of that grim autocrat the superintendent
from his notes lieutenant crosby read a verbatim transcript of the conversation which had just occurred between mosely and himself laying especial stress upon the cadets confused and stammering response to the statement regarding darwin
as he caught the implication contained in unfortunate slip of the tongue the colonel drew himself up sharply
then he leaned forward across his desk his face set and severe
cadet mosely and his stern eyes pierced the culprit through do you realize that this remark of yours must be interpreted as a confession a confession which unless explained will necessitate the lodging of charges against you your court martial and your almost certain expulsion from the academy
i do sir
have you any explanation then which you wish to offer
kerr gulped once or twice he found it hard to speak
none sir he finally managed to answer
the colonels frown deepened his voice took on an added tinge of hardness
cadet mosely i ask you the direct question
are you a married man
the legal procedure at west point has a crude primitiveness which would turn the ordinary hairsplitting barrister of the courts green with wonder
no objections are permitted there on the score of incriminating ones self
they ask a straightout question and they expect a straightout answer
moreover they get it
they have an institution called the honor of the corps perhaps the most cherished tradition of the place which prescribes that every cadet must reply truthfully when interrogated concerning his personal actions or behavior no matter how disastrous the results may be to himself
queenie sinclair and tommy wilburt had never heard of the honor of the corps and evenif they had they would never have believed it
from the viewpoint of fortysecond street they would have said there ainot no such animal
but kerr was only too well aware of its existence and he never once thought of disobeying or evading that unwritten obligation
there was but one recourse left to him a slight one but he decided to take advantage of it chiefly because the lump which kept rising in his throat at the thought of all this was going to mean to him made speaking increasingly difficult
if you please sir he said i should like to reply to that in writing
as you wish
the colonel nodded his assent
but as he turned back to his papers kerr from his manner was miserably conscious that the superintendent already regarded him as an outcast and pariah returning cold and weary after his five hours stretch of duty in the area entered the quarters jointly occupied by himself and mosely to find kerr seated before the writingtable in a brown study
so absorbed was he in his somber reflections that he did not even glance up but darwin had by this time grown accustomed to these fits of reverie on the part of his formerly lively comrade and paid no heed
a he shivered as he hung over the radiator tenderly massaging his red and frostbitten nose
talk about the hardships of scott and peary getting to the pole
they didnot have anything on me bet got icicles on my lungs
he stood there scowling out of the window across the snowheaped plain
by george done he went on
anybody that wants to flatten his feet and freeze his spine in that confounded quadrangle can do it as for me quoth the raven nevermore
mosely roused from his abstraction and stood up
there was a trace of bitterness in his faint quizzical smile
you think youre playing in pretty tough luck donot you
why monk it goes without saying that this was the nickname in which darwin rejoiced give anything on earth just to be in your shoes
this and he picked up a sealed envelope from the table is my walking papers
the other stared at him incredulously
not until he had stepped quickly over to the table and seen for himself the superintendents name on the envelope did he begin to believe
your resignation he gasped
well practically that a statement to the supe which is bound to break me
why make it then expostulated darwin
he asked me the direct question
i told him i would give my answer in writing
this is it
oh
darwin gloomily nodded his comprehension
he too was familiar with the obligation imposed by the honor of the corps
then a suggestion came to him
but look here kerr theyll never put the skids under you
why man alive it wouldnot be common gratitude after your showing in the navy game
every officer in the service from the chief of staff down would let out a roar
you might as well talk about firing the victory monument
but mosely disconsolately shook his head
football isnot going to save me here monk
no nor anything else married
a bombshell could hardly have created greater surprise and consternation
darwin slumped weakly into a chair roundeyed his mouth opening and shutting like a fishs without uttering a sound
so thats whats been the matter with you he managed finally to articulate
oh kerr kerr why couldnot you have waited just a few months until commencement and then it wouldnot have made any difference
wait
you donot imagine i did this thing deliberately do you
i was framed donot you understand
they caught me with my guard down and rushed me to the ropes before i realized what was happening
oh i know its hard to believe as darwin cocked a skeptical eye at him
but its true nevertheless and whats more you or any other file would have fallen for their game just as hard as i did
then he went ahead to tell how in the flush of his day of triumph he had been entrapped by the sophisticated wiles of miss sinclair and mr wilburt
all they wanted was money he explained and the ink was hardly dry on the marriage certificate before they had a crook lawyer writing to my father to demand a settlement
he came right up here to see about it
as you may imagine it wasnot a very joyful occasion
but the old boy agreed to see me through on it
and then he groaned and sunk his head between his hands just when everything was arranged when the terms had been settled and the marriage was to be annulled and i began to see myself clear of the whole rotten mess just then this sneaking quill of a crosby had to come along gloating over me on your account and i stubbed my toe nothing to be done now he finished
the supe has put it up to me in so many words are you married and although written him the circumstances just as told them to you i canot get away from the fact
i canot get away from it and neither can he bound to expel me they canot even give me the opportunity to resign
the only drop of satisfaction i can get now is that the bunch of flimflammers will get left at the same time
i am telegraphing the old man to call off the deal he made with them
he tried to speak nonchalantly but in spite of himself his voice choked and he turned quickly away to hide the quivering of his lips
darwin who had been listening almost in stupefaction suddenly straightened up
hold on there he cried eagerly stretching out his hand
maybe theres a way out of the muddle after all got an idea
no listen to me as kerr gave an impatient hunch to his shoulders
this is something that looks as if it might work
now tell me first he went on did you take a slant at that notice on the bulletin board this afternoon
you mean the one about calling off all the classwork for tomorrow on account of distinguished visitors
prince chu yang of china and party coming up to give us the onceover
is that the one you mean the baby darwin nodded
prince chu yang of china what
i had in mind when i told you i was done with this infernal areatramping
if we can only dope out the proper formation with him kerr all our troubles would be over that is mine would for certain and i am almost sure yours would too
they would eh
kerr exhibited scant enthusiasm
well maybe so but youve got to show me
all i ever knew to come from visitors of that sort was about a dozen extra drills
look how they trotted us around the parade ground for that greasy central american president last month and when the duke dorville was here not talking about any rattrap presidents or four flushing dukes or counts interrupted monk
what you have to have for this play of mine is genuine royal blood a prince or a king
when one of that sort puts up a request to the supe no matter what it is hes got to grant it as a compliment to the nation the guy represents donot you understand
at any rate thats what was pulled off when prince louis of battenberg was here about ten or twelve years ago
the gang got next to him somehow and louis being a good scout in his way up and asks that all punishments be remitted
and the supe stood for it
without a whimper
he had to donot you see or maybe provoke what they call an international incident
or at least thats the way joe phelps put it to me and he got the story from his cousin who was here at the time
mosely began to show a more lively interest
and now youve got it in your head to tear off the same stunt eh
sure provided of course that this prince or whatever he calls himself is really royalty
nothing short of actual royal blood will serve you hive me and been bothered more or less to know whether a chink would turn the trick
prince sounds all right of course but you canot always tell about these ringtailed titles
in russia as i understand it prince doesnot mean much more than justice of the peace
oh i guess that part of it is all right
kerr thoughtfully wrinkled his nose
china is a republic now i believe or was up to day before yesterday but there was some sort of an arrangement made i remember for the members of the royal family to keep their rank and this guy must be one of them
prince chu yang of china is the way theyve got him billed on the bulletin board
come to think of it too he exclaimed i heard cap
blendon tell sleeper that he was a cousin to the late emperor of china
a by george monk
he flung up his head with a sudden flash of excitement
if this things as you say it is we may be able to save my bacon
hold on a minute cautioned darwin start to celebrating too soon got to catch our rabbit you know before we can cook it and wondering just a bit how were going to manage his royal highness and make him understand what were after
ten to one none of the party can speak a word of english
ah where your uncle gyrus plays trumps kerr cried exuberantly
you never heard me spout chinee did you monk
well i can good enough anyhow to make myself understood
i picked it up from old hop lee our cook out at santa barbara
but even so darwin still shook his head how will you get to the prince to tell him what we want
how
kerr shot him a glance of withering disdain
how
why bawl it at him from the ranks if i have to you bonehead
never fear but what get to him somehow
a chance like this comes too pat to let it slip through my fingers
so all that evening the two schemed and plotted to the utter neglect of their duties and when at last the bugle sounded lights out kerr retired firm in the belief that the problem had been solved and feeling as if the load of care he had been carrying for so many months at last had fallen from his shoulders
did any uneasy forebodings trouble his pillow that night warning him of the consequences of his proposed action consequences that were to lead him halfway around the world and test his fiber in the fire of great experiences
truth to tell no
the routine of a day at west point with its rigorous grind is hardly conducive to visions either prophetic or otherwise
a slumbering young giant mosely lay there on his narrow army cot deepbreathing oblivious to both his past and his future while destiny perched on his footboard and waited for the day theres many a sup prides itself on always being prepared
less than twentyfour hours notice had been given of the impending royal visit yet at noon when the party arrived arrangements had been completed covering every detail for the proper reception of the prince his daughter the princess chu sing who accompanied him and the various members of their retinue
kerr mosely painfully bugling cadet slang for stalling at a recitation in mathematics felt his heart leap with a thrill of excitement when he heard the rap of the professor calling a halt for the dismissal of the section and the subsequent announcement that all members of the corps donning full dress were to hold themselves ready for immediate assembly
in spite of the notice on the bulletinboard kerr had been haunted with anxious fears lest something might happen to interfere with the coming of the party but now with the assurance that the prince had actually arrived he shot a glance of purposeful significance at darwin and his heart beat high with a spirit of adventure
colonel vance the superintendent rigged out in all the regalia of his position chapeau goldfringed epaulets and clanking sword and surrounded by his equally glittering staff met the distinguished visitors at the station and extended them a ceremonious welcome
then as the cannon roared out a royal salute they were escorted up the hill where the corps was drawn up a long gray line in front of barracks presenting faultlessly as the cavalcade whirled by
standing at rigid attention kerr scanned the impassive oriental faces of the prince and his suite as they stared phlegmatically about at the gray battlemented buildings and the sparkling sweep of snowcovered plain
out of the corner of his mouth he whispered to darwin who stood next him seem to be much difference in looks does there between a royal chink and one of the ordinary washeewashee variety he commented
there isnot darwin responded with assurance
all chinks run in one of two patterns either fat and greasy or skinny and dried up you remember piping off the members of the chinese embassy when we were down at the inauguration at washington
no you donot need to be afraid of bracing this prince i tell you
just make yourself think youre talking to some old laundryman
there was no chance to say more at the moment for with the conclusion of the salute the battalion was relieved until the time set for an exhibition drill later in the afternoon all except the members of the third division who were ordered to shape their rooms immediately for special inspection by the visitors
kerr and darwin being among those so designated hurried off to busy themselves with broom and dustpan in tidying up
they had expected this and never had they gone at the distasteful chambermaid work of their joint establishment with such zest and anticipation for upon the forthcoming inspection they were basing all their hopes
that had seemed to them the propitious moment for preferring their request to the prince and they had rehearsed again and again the scene they expected to be enacted
knowing the custom of visitors on such occasions they never doubted but that the prince would make some comment or ask a question regarding the arrangements of the room
he might address the cadets directly although they believed it more probable that he would speak through an interpreter
in either case this was to be opportunity
he would give the answer in chinese and the prince surprised and interested at hearing his own language spoken would hardly fail to pursue the conversation and thus afford an opening for broaching the allimportant subject
indeed it seemed to the two cadets that no possible bar could now arise to the complete success of their project
every circumstance was in their favor
the chinese from the time of li hung chang down have been given to asking questions at every opportunity and so infrequently must it be that the prince heard himself spoken to in his own tongue that use of it would almost certainly stir him to feelings of goodwill
and now the footsteps of the party could be heard upon the stairs
hastily the two assumed an attitude of rigid attention as they awaited the expected knock upon the door breath went a little faster and he involuntarily braced himself for the ordeal
the footsteps were at the very threshold now
but there was no knock on the door
without pausing the party passed on down the corridor
blankly the cadets stared at each other
for some reason or caprice they could not tell why possibly from the sheer malevolence of fate the superintendent had chosen not to show their quarters
maybe theyll stop in on their way back ventured monk hopefully although his lips were pale
but kerr only shook his head
he sank down miserably in a chair and buried his head in his arms
their chance was gone and he knew it
his was not a nature though to cry long over spilt milk or to languish in defeat
indeed when he dropped his head into his arms it was lessin token of surrender than to review the situation and to ponder what steps next to take
and now he straightened up suddenly his jaw set a glint of determination in his eye
by jove not going to fess out a like this without getting even a lookin he declared hotly
where theres a will theres always a way
monk what are the orders for the day
exhibition drill this afternoon
there go the bugles for it now
then tonight theres a reception at the supes house
ah
kerr exclaimed
a reception eh
yes but thats for officers only
no chance to horn in there
i donot know old man but what our only hope is to shout out an at the prince from the ranks as you first suggested
no mosely shook his head as he struggled into the sleeves of his overcoat
america first my boy
we mustnot let these foreigners get the impression that there is any ragged discipline here
besides it would only prejudice old against us
these orientals are great sticklers for etiquette and ceremony you know
no he repeated got a better scheme than that
invitation or no invitation i am going to that reception
accordingly there was no disturbance or undignified interruption in the exhibition drill to which they now betook themselves
with the rest of the battalion kerr and darwin sloshed around through the snow of the parade ground in a series of evolutions which caused the somber eyes of the chinese prince to lighten with a gleam of wonder as he admiringly clapped his gloved palms
the shy fawnlike little princess chu sing wrapped in her furs also applauded daintily
with asiatic reserve she showed nothing that was in her mind but down in her heart she thought she had never seen a more inspiring sight than these sturdy young sons of mars
and when they passed in review company front with lines as straight as ruled edges her brown cheeks glowed with an irrepressible touch of color and the breath came fast between her parted lips
after the drill was over and along toward dusk a gentle south wind sprang up bringing with it a distinct moderation in temperature
at about the same time lights began to glow out from the windows of the superintendents residence and busy preparations were in progress for the evenings entertainment
how the ensuing complication occurred no one afterward was able to determine
it is a grave misdemeanor to tamper with the guard roster of an army post and certainly not one ordinarily apt to be attempted for the purpose of hogging extra duty
yet strangely enough when the commandant that evening instructed the first sergeant of company to detail a cadet as a special sentinel for the superintendents quarters during the hours of the reception the name found decorating the top of the roster was that of cadet mosely
it was quite out of order kerr belonging properly almost at the foot of the list but the first sergeant was a rather dense youth a slave to routine perhaps that fact had also been reckoned on and when he saw the name there that settled it
the assignment assured kerr prepared for it with the best his division could furnish
a pair of new trousers was requisitioned from a plebe whose waist measure and length of limb approximated own darwin contributed a dresscoat with a prayer that the seams might hold some one else gave a shako and the various remaining articles of apparel were borrowed from other rooms along the corridor either with or without the consent of the owners
if one is possibly to hobnob with royalty one wants to put ones best foot forward even though it is in another fellows shoes
so thus accoutered and with the cape of his gray overcoat thrown jauntily back to show his emancipated status as an upper classman kerr emerged from barracks and strode across the quadrangle
nine oclock found him at the superintendents door and a regular answered his ring
inform colonel vance that cadet mosely reports as ordered
with mili432 tary punctilio he brought his gun sharply to an order
the soldier vanished and in a few minutes the colonel resplendent in gold lace appeared
but the dazzle of the colonels raiment was not reflected in his countenance
he seemed perplexed annoyed perturbed
kerr however paid no heed
erect as straining dresscoat and the corset of a west pointer trunkmuscles trained to the quality of whalebone and tempered steel could make him he riflesaluted
cadet mosely reports sir as ordered
mr mosely did you say peering at him from under bushy gray eyebrows
even yet the superintendent appeared incredulous
yes sir briskly
humph
i had hardly expected to see you
the superintendent bit his lip in indecision
it was most irregular that a cadet who was practically under charges should be acting as a sentinel
yet to go through the red tape necessary to secure a substitute at this late hour would be impracticable and anyhow he had a dozen other things to look after
as he debated the question he raised another issue
may i remind you cadet mosely that the communication you promised in answer to my question of yesterday is not yet in hand
kerr had rather expected this and was prepared
reaching inside his blouse he drew out the letter he had written the day before and handed it over
the colonel started to tear open the envelope then paused and held it thoughtfully in his hands
mr mosely if this should contain what i fear it does i should be forced to order you under arrest and that would necessitate my securing another sentinel
consequently i shall leave it unread until tomorrow
he turned and laid the letter away in the drawer of a desk which stood there in the hall
kerr could hardly repress a gasp of relief
that had been the one weak spot in his scheme the moment he had feared and now he had surmounted it successfully
the rest would be easy sailing
yoif will continue your detail therefore proceeded the colonel curtly
take your post on that short walk
he pointed to a gravel path which ran along the side of the house
at the order burgeoning elation evaporated like a cloud of steam struck by a sudden current of frosty air
it had been his idea that he would be stationed at the front door where even though he failed to encounter the prince himself he was almosf certain to gain speech with some member of the suite either going in or coming out
but off at the side where there was no chance of meeting any one but a kitchenmaid or one of the caterers men he might as well be in his own room at barracks
you will remain on duty went on the colonel pitilessly until after the reception is over and under no circumstances are you to allow any one except my own domestics to pass you
those are your orders
do you comprehend them
i do sir
mosely dejectedly saluted
he was too overwhelmed to hear a slight rustling on the stairs overhead or to notice two shadowy feminine figures watching the interview from the landing
then take your post directed the colonel
and with another faltering salute kerr obeyed
cadet mosely began to pace his gravel walk between its two banks of melting snow
gradually however he becrme interested in spite of himself in the brilliant pany gathered within the house and plainly visible to him through the parted curtains at the windows
the prince did not especially impress him being of that pattern of chinaman which darwin had described as skinny and dried up and like the gentlemen of his suite attired in american evening dress with only a broad yellow ribbon to indicate his rank
the princess and her ladies in attendance on the contrary were in native costume and proved far more satisfying to the critical eye of the observer on the walk
indeed mosely always a susceptible youth might readily have lost his heart to the delicate little ivorytinted lady who looked as if she might have stepped out of a fan had it not been for the surpassing charms of one of her fair associates
this girl showed scarcely a trace of the mongolian characteristics
her brows were arched not slanting her complexion as exquisite as the flush upon a briarrose her profile chiseled like a her eyes were dark and met those of any one who spoke to her openly and frankly not with the shrinking deference of the oriental woman
in short she was a girl of today lovely laughing wholesome unaffected
she wore a short jacket of brocaded ivory silk fastened with buttons of carved jade and caught by curiously set pearl pins and a skirt of heavy satin of the same shade reaching hardly to the ankle displaying underneath the goldfringed pantaloons and tiny embroidered slippers
her hair worn low over her ears and under a net of gems only served to accentuate with its hint of an unchanging fashion the difference between her and her companions
some femme that muttered kerr slowing up in his stride to gaze upon the entrancing vision
i guess it would go bad to have her up here in the summertime and take her for a stroll around flirtation not
he halted suddenly a jealous frown creasing his features as he saw her talking and smiling up into the face of the despised crosby
what can she see in that rotten quill he snarled disgustedly as the two sauntered away together out of sight and he resumed his solitary pacing
eleven oclock came and with the band striking up the star spangled banner the company inside formed for a gala entry into the ballroom the colonel and his royal guest leading the van
outside the lonely sentry fairly dragged his feet striving not to keep step to the music and choking down the lump which the familiar refrain brought to his throat for rail as he would at the miseries of cadet life there was bitterness in his heart at the thought of leaving the gray old academy with its many fond associations and he was more than loath to give up the military career to which he had dedicated himself almost since the time he had laid aside pinafores
yet it was useless to repine
he knew that he was marked for expulsion as inevitably as that sun would rise
and what would his stem old father have to say to this final outcome
ah that was a question on which the cul prit did not dare to reflect
with head down engrossed in his moody meditations he lagged up and down the stretch of gravel walk oblivious to everything save his own troubles until suddenly the sound of a soft footstep and the sight of two figures looming up dimly almost directly in front of him brought him to a recollection of his duties
halt he challenged throwing his gun viciously to a port
who goes there
and then he almost fell over backward for as the moon sailed from under a cloud he saw laughing out at him from a muffle of wraps the face of the antipodean divinity at whom he had gazed through the window while close behind her equally shrouded was the figure of the little princess dainty shy and lovely
to be continued
a small town tragedy i what do you want with all these shirts walt
harry anderson owner of the little store on high street wrapped three silk shirts in a blue paper and handed them across the counter to his old school friend and pal walter leeds who worked at canning brothers the seed store farther down the street
not possible you didnot know mildred race is coming back today is it
mr leeds tucked his package under his arm and added and anybody workin in a big store like wells wells in new york will be some swell dresser take it from me be used to fellows wholl know what to wear and when
she shook me to go to the city and now aimin to let her know not so slow if i did stay in wedgely
anderson grinned and swung himself jauntily to a seat on the counter that explains the white flannels the barrels of ties the oodles of shirts the marvelous assortment of socks he exclaimed
come to think of it though ed brown did say mil was some babydoll
sure she is but she wonot outdoll me
and when she compares her hometown sweetheart with those city guys that trot her to cabarets every night i donot intend to retire behind the tall grass on the farm some line of stock you carry old top
yep all the latest payin pretty well too
decent of mil to spend her vacation here with the old folks ainot it added anderson as he followed his friend to the door
oh all right
well so long
so long
the express from new york paused beside wedgely station where several hacks were drawn up at the platform
one rather smartlooking car and a runabout driven by a girl in a middie completed the scene which greeted the slim little maiden who sprang from the second car almost into the arms of mr walter leeds who was wonderfully got up in the very best that anderson furnishings could produce
his ruddy face glowed above a palepink silk shirt which was adorned by a string tie of a deeper pink whereon reposed as though but a transient guest a large golden fly with ruby eyes
the rest of mr leeds was encased in white duck trousers black silk stockings and white canvas shoes
but he thought proudly he had nothing on mildred
mildred race was small and thin with the flatness of a board and she wore a green silk sport suit high white shoes and a panama hat with a green band
her blond hair came down on each pink cheek in a flat ring and in some mysterious fashion remained there
long pearl earrings dangled from the ears that were hidden somewhere behind the misplaced hair and a pair of limp doeskin gloves hung in one little hand
mildred race was the living definition of chicken queen babydoll and some kid
she almost bowled walter leeds over
gracious walt youre lookin grand she told him with a languishing glance from under the dark lashes
get em to take my trunk up will you a love the check
when they were seated in the hack walter procured she appeared eager for news of the old crowd and apparently oblivious flf her escorts presence produced a vanity case as he talked and powdered her nose moistening one finger and passing it over brows and lashes look so fussed walt she giggled when she caught his stare of amazement
everybody in town does it these days
you see were all so busy and so rushed we donot get time of finish at home
too bad you never got to see me walt its some little old town
it must be said walter leeds with a long breath
i wish lelia could have come with me shares my room at the boardinhouse sighed mildred
gee you ought to see her walt class you bet
different fellow every night in the week and clothes
my that girl is clever
she makes all her own clothes and some of mine
she made this
she did
words failed him
are they wearing many er things as gay as that
gay with fine scorn
for the love of pete
gay
this is deep mourning besides some of them
but the really swell ones cost too much money a yard i couldnot go the price
but wait until you see my summer furs
i bet every girl in wedgely would faint if she knew the glad rags got in that little old trunk
say walt do they have those dancing contests out at the white city yet on friday nights
yes want to go tonight
the bunch is going and we sort of hoped youd want to
sure been dancin every night in new york
is that steve farrel over there walt
yes
a tall cleancut young fellow in working clothes passed them with a nod and a wave of his hand and mildred race looked after him with wide eyes he look awful in that getup
is he still at the works walt
yes says he wonot quit until he knows it all from the bottom up
looks as if hes liable to then she giggled awful good lookin though
yes but our bunch has sort of let steve alone since he began that sort of thing and mr leeds flicked a bit of dust from his pink silk sleeve with a polished fingernail
mildred race stared across the pretty street a long silent moment her fingers absentmindedly crumpling the doeskins pay you for these now old top but let em go on the bill wonot you got to dress up to mil
gosh you oughta see the glad rags shes got in her trunk
walter leeds leaned confidentially over the counter of haberdashery store and wiped his perspiring brow with a fiftycent handkerchief sporting an elegant palegreen border and a huge green in one corner
i saw her last night talkin to steve farrel out at her gate grinned anderson folding up one skyblue tie and one salmon one
she was some little looker then believe me
had on a kind of white and red thing pretty near as short as a bathing suit
i noticed it more because steve had on that old suit he wears to the works all over paint
yep shes a looker
mr leeds stared absentmindedly at a box of purplebordered handkerchiefs marked six for thirtyfive cents
but shes got no time for steve not the way he looks
funny he donot seem to care goodlookin boy like him too
but a paint joints no place to be a gentleman in harry
he ought ave gone into the seed business maybe it donot pay so much but gosh its refined
miss mildred race came out to the porch that evening when mr leeds called in a pink sport suit made extremely short and extremely full and while the neck was cut very low in a the sleeves came almost over the little hands
her blond hair brought down over her ears lay flat to her small head and was built out in a thick knot midway between her neck and the top of her head
she sat down on the step beside her caller and for once made no remark about his new flannels or his shirt which always challenged attention whether of the admiring variety or otherwise
her manner was graver than usual and her eyes rather wide and wistful
gee miss you mil when you go back monday mr leeds sighed presently and lifted one freshly blancoed shoe to the step beside her meanwhile resting his elbow on his knee and his chin in his palm as he had seen francis bushman posed dozens of times
this towns slow enough anyhow without a fellows havin a special reason for thinkin it is
oh i donot know its not so bad
she drew a long breath and moved the hand he was groping for
say walt steve was tellin me his mothers sick
yep got rheumatism canot get out of bed got housekeepin down fine they say
but who cooks for him them when hes so busy little sister
old julia our washwoman cooks for them when they can get her
i guess steve manages he donot fuss around much with girls or anything
little sister lola is well i guess that kid is worryin steve a lot just now been goin around with some fat drummer and they say hes got a wife dead crazy about lola too
mildred did not reply and presently walt moved again restlessly
you didnot say whether you liked this shirt or not he ventured the socks a dandy match
fine
have any of your city beaux got anything on me when it comes to dressin mil
not a thing walt
you look just like some of them
gosh new york must pay good salaries he muttered ruefully thinking of his debt to harry anderson
and what would he do with all the truck when mildred was gone
it was a darned nuisance dressing up every day and as for matching shirts and ties and hose and handkerchiefs goodnight all go out to the white city saturday mil he said then nettled at her unusual abstraction
the bunch will go want to
sure anything walt
mil and steve are gettin thick walt anderson teased some days later when leeds dropped in at the store after lunch
she donot seem to care how he looks
met em walkin toward the plant ten minutes ago she had on a middie no class to that is there
oh i guess i guess shes glad not to dress up in the mornings like she has to in town said mr leeds weakly
she was class enough last night goin to the white city tonight
nan and you come along settle that little bill harry as soon as let that worry you walt your credits good grinned anderson goodnaturedly
sure nan and go along
see you at school and high at eight
yep i guess so
ed and bess are going too
gosh miss mil when she leaves you persuade her to stay in wedgely walt tried to ask her twice but she wouldnot let me sighed mr leeds gonna try again tonight
sure thats right never say die
mrs race stout mother came to the door that evening when walter called for her daughter
i ainot no idea where our mil is walt she told him peering up and down the street
she ainot been in since right after supper
my donot you lookgrand and she didnot tell me where she was off to
will you set a spell and wait
walter leeds mystified and a bit hurt set a spell in a stiff rocker in his white flannels his navyblue coat and tie and hose and twiddled his straw hat with its navyblue band
presently when his watch told him it was ten minutes to eight mildred race came down the street a slim white fluttering form between the bars of moonlight and the velvet shadows the great trees threw
she had on a little demure gray dress and a palepink silk sweater and she was breathing rapidly one hand on her breast
my stars walt if i had a weak heart drop dead at your feet she giggled leaning agaiiftt the vinetwisted pillar near him her face flushed prettily did some marathon believe me
knowin you were on the point of suicide
wait until i get a hat and powder my nose and well run right along
and she was gone like a flash into the house before walter could voice the question he had some right to ask
on the way to the trolley he asked it
oh said mildred carelessly
i dropped in on one of the girls
gee walt is that nan dawson with harry anderson
got the contour of a cushion hasnot she
if i ever come to that miss race drew a long breath and hitched up the fluffy white furs closer about her little rounded chin never come to that said walter leeds with finality as they reached the other couples standing at the corner of school and high streets
the white city was much as other white cities mostly yellow glitter
perilous dips and paths outlined in flaunting lights against the skies here the swaying enticing music of the habanera from carmen there the more enticing notes of the latest fox trot and over to one side a little artificial lake outlined in light and decorated by various rowboats and a launch or two
among those who trotted untiringly at ten cents a trot were mildred race and her crowd
mildred had not been herself according to her escort all the evening
she was quiet and abstracted even her feet forgot themselves now and then and when that happened walter grew really perturbed
something must be wrong
he felt vaguely angry with mildred in that she was not exerting herself to make his evening pleasant
after all he had spent on his clothes for her sake holy smoke
a girl had a right to laugh when a man said something smart anyhow
presently go have a soda walt mildred suggested right when he was noisily demanding another encore you want the rest of this he began but she was threading her way through the swaying couples to the door
sick mil
she threw him a flashing smile the first he had seen that evening
no
gee walt youve got a pace that belongs to new york she grimaced saucily
here comes the bunch askin walt for a soda ed and he donot want to buy me one
whadda ya think of that
among the couples who sat at the mushroomlike little table in the openair refreshment parlor was a slim dollfaced girl who was plainly not over eighteen and a stout grayflanneled party old enough to be well a very big brother at any rate
the girl was pathetically pretty with the big eyes and tiny mouth that belong to youth eager to learn but wistfully afraid
the man was desperately attracted and very attentive and the girl looked at him now and then and flushed prettily
mildred race had not put her spoon in her ice cream soda before she saw them
walt she pinched mr leeds sharply below the elbow
i guess thats drummer ainot it
walter leeds remarked the curiously tight look about her pretty mouth
sure it is theyre everywhere rushin her
everybody says his wife ll get on and then his name asked mildred
dawson i believe the matter mil
why the devouring interest in the stout party mildred added harry anderson leaning across the table
does anybody know where hes from
mildred asked her eyes still on steve little sister
sure buffalo
where you going demanded walter as mildred rose pushing away her soda be back in a minute she nodded going to get that little babydoll and take her home
and before her party could voice any protest or do more than stare at one another she was halfway over to the other table
how are you mr dawson she began cordially her hand extended you donot know me but met your wife shes shown me your picture often enough for me to recognize you right off and mr leeds told me i was correct
we make a lot of strangers here in wedgely you know its our way
and then having met mrs dawson oh hello lola
the fat drummer was on his feet very red of face mechanically pumping slim hand up and down
lola farrel was staring at him with horrified eyes
mildred youre wrong mr dawson isnot married she got out primly through her pretty tremulous lips and mildred laughed musically
nonsense lola i know mrs dawson very well
i visit in buffalo mr dawson
apparently the stout drummer had had no idea of denying the calm statements of this breezy cordial innocenteyed young woman and he just as apparently had next to nothing to say
why you you were asking me to marry you cried lola rising excitedly
what did you mean
answer me are you married
come lola deary you come home with us soothed mildred race putting an arm about little sister fondly
of course mr dawson is married i know his wife didnot you hear me say so
tell the little girl youre married mr dawson
dawson stared suspiciously at mildred smiling face and somehow under her smile he sensed something he distinctly did not like
why er i i was just kiddin you along lola he tried to grin
of course married
i meant to tell you when be about all from you cut in mildred sharply and now she was not smiling
and advise you to walk while theres nothin behind you to make you run got some perfect gentlemen with me over there who might be a bit interested in your immediate departure and as for this kids brother well say
mildred paused dramatically and mr dawson seized the opportunity and his hat itnd walked hastily out upon the crowded promenade
lola caught arm convulsively
oh mildred he was asking me she began hysterically but mildred patted her shoulder
i know
i time my entrance just right
now you come right over with me and after walt buys you a sundae and me some more ice cream for i guess what i left is now mere soup well all take you home deary where you ought to be cookin for your mother and steve not goin to read you any sermon lola farrel but your place is surely in the home from now until your mother can walk and then some
the following evening when walter leeds called on mildred race he knocked vainly upon the screen door and at last sought out her shambling father in the back yard
mrs race washing the dinner dishes came out at the kitchen door in a big soiled apron
land is mil gone again she demanded
father donot you know where went to
she was on the porch a while back walt you dress just fine these days
come in and set a spell do
but walter leeds had set his last spell waiting for the truant daughter of the house of race and he withdrew after an aimless inspection of old man vegetable bed and a glance at his watch whose hands pointed maliciously to ninethirty
mildred had know he was coming tonight and he was angry and hurt
she had given him the shake after all he had spent on clothes to make a hit with her
it would take him months to crawl out of debt he would have to forego lunches and cigars
that was a fine way to treat a fellow
and she was taking a mighty big interest in the biggest fool thing he ever saw taking lola farrell away from that fat drummer and bringing her home last night
the bigeyed kid would find another drummer
why was mildred race so darned interested
the bunch would talk about it for a month
could it be that steve farrel here mr walter leeds in his spotless flannels paused a moment in the quiet street and laughed aloud and scornfully
that guy in his paintsplashed old brown suit
after the sports mildred race had tearing around after her in new york after him walter leeds who had outsported any of those city dudes in this one dazzlingly extravagant week
nev ar
he was walking moodily past the race house the next evening early when mildred came running down the path to him
she wore the middie harry anderson had spoken of and the earrings were not in evidence
oh walt you must be furious at me she gasped when she reached him
she laid one small hand on her throat and the other on his arm looking at him appealingly from under those long lashes
ma says you are but i told her we were too good friends for that
all these years a little thing like that a little thing
all his hurt was in the three words
mildred where were you last night
down at walt
you see steve came by here in such a hurry after supper i asked him what was wrong and he said his mother was very sick and he was going to get mrs beasley to sit with her while he went back to work
lola was locked in her room crying
walt you know old mrs beasley how awful she is if i was sick shed kill me
so i just said go and i went all
she was awfully sick but shes better now
gee whiz you went the wedgely street swam before his hurt eyes
mildred race that was the limit
do you know how that looks
you shook me to go sit with steve mother
and after what you did before our bunch for steve sister night before last a good thing you donot live in wedgely for after this mildred flushed sweetly and a bit angrily
but going to live in wedgely walt for going to marry steve
why i could never go back to new york and leave him in such a fix not on your sweet life
his poor old mother so sick and helpless and that fool kid that lola child i guess not
walter leeds fell back feebly against the fence that surrounded the race home
marry steve
after me goin in debt to dress to please you
marry a boob that looks like he does he gasped red and white by turns
pooh
steve farrel could put on overalls and carry a hod and beat you all all of you to a finish for looks retorted mildred with cold amusement
and he isnot afraid to work thats one of the five million things about him i love
but sorry you went in debt for clothes walt thats a mighty fool thing to do
mr leeds continued to stare at her pretty flushed face and presently he pulled a seventyfive cent handkerchief from his pocket the border of which exactly matched his tie and hose and proceeded to mop his brow
to think of a babydoll like you takin up with a fellow who wears the tramp getups steve farrel does he groaned helplessly tell you something rejoined mildred race seeing that she had really dealt him an overpowering blow
i was so almighty sick of the dudes been goin with in new york with everything on their backs and nothing in their heads pr the bank either that i just had to love steve for bein so natural and such a relief
and speakin of money in the bank why
then too hes had such a time with that poor sick old mother why got their suppers four or five nights now while lola was gallivantin with that fat drummer
steve needs me anyhow
somebody has to keep that kid sister by the fireside
mil dred called mrs race from the front door if walt and you has made it up bring him in to set a spell got some cold lemonade here and some cookies
mildred race held out a friendly little hand and smiled happily into his bewildered eyes
come on in walt she invited hospitably as she opened the gate at your window smiles she has crossed the world for miles just to look at you brought you all her dew waits her arms with roses laden just to look upon you maiden oh your eyes are blue
far across the eastern sky when the stars began to die for your lovely sake softly did she take shoes of pearl and came tiptoeing noiseless as a lily blowing tust to see vou wake a young farmer has recently been appointed justice of the peace for bellsville near linhampton
sam vane after capturing a thief in woods hands over to brooke the booty valuable jewelry stolen from the home of dr bates in linhampton which harden stows away in his attic for safekeeping overnight
meanwhile he hires a tramp claude miller as a farm hand but in the morning miller is missing and in the attic near the spot where he has concealed the jewels harden finds lying unconscious letha severly pretty schoolteacher who boards with harden and his sister marion
she says a man has frightened her in the night but insists that it was not miller
brooke tries to get on the trail of the latter through telephone central and meanwhile drives in to linhampton seeking other clues but does not dare admit he has lost the jewelry committed to his care
thus he is set into a panic when on his way home raymond bates hails him to say that he is going to motor out to place to identify and check up the jewelry in order to set his mothers mind at rest
a harden brooke had his own troubles this morning miss letha severly calmly conducted the studies of about a score of boys and girls at the little schoolhouse half a mile from the farm
there was nothing in appearance to suggest that she had passed through a terrifying experience during the night which might well have excused her absence from the school
in her wellfitting dark gown relieved by a touch of white lace at throat and cuffs and with her shining titian hair in perfect order she was quite as charming and efficient as usual and the morning session moved along with its accustomed smoothness
no one saw any difference in teacher
at noon there was the usual recess and she had the room to herself while the rampant crowd of youngsters after consuming their lunches played about outside
she had just disposed of her own sandwiches and cake put up for her by marion and had stepped to the window to gaze thoughtfully across the fields at the farmhouse which had suddenly become the scene of so much mystery when the door opened and a heavy footfall made her turn
she felt resentful at once toward the man who stood before her
she did not like his white eyelashes nor his smirk this story began in the may argosy nor his short nose nor his eyes that were too close together
his citymade check suit was too loud and his yellow low shoes with their sprawling silk laces and thick soles were an offense
with quick feminine appraisement she judged him to be not more than thirty
miss severly he interrogated removing his straw hat with what he evidently meant to be a courtly flourish
yes
ah
he coolly turned the key in the door and waved one hand toward the window while he slicked down his light hair with the other
softie of the kids might want to come in he explained and i have something important to say
letha still stood near the window which was partly open
if the stranger had expected her to betray emotion at his words or apprehension because he had locked the door he was disappointed
she calmly waited for him to go on
my name is marcus tolman
i am in the law office of strike boxall in philadelphia
when john landon was charged with stealing five hundred dollars from the cashiers office at the imperial market where he was employed three months ago i handled the case for the firm
landon got away
we know that he took the name of claude miller
i have succeeded in tracing him here to bellsville
well did not get here till late last night and i made the mistake of not arresting him as soon as i found out where he was
when i went to harden house this morning i found he had skipped
it looks as if he might have been tipped off
brooke could not tell me anything about him
i didnot tell him that landon married your sister
but i knew you were teaching school here and naturally i came to see what you have to say
what do you expect me to say she asked icily
oh now miss severly whats the use got the goods on landon and i donot think it would be hard to prove that you helped him to get away from that farmhouse last night
i know you had a letter from philadelphia yesterday afternoon and guessing that you were told i was coming and were asked to give landon word of it if you saw him
your guesses are interesting
but i have no comment to make
if this is all you have to say she finished the sentence by walking past him quite unhurriedly and unlocking the door open the door yet he requested his smirk wider than ever only told you part of what come to tell find the rest of it even more interesting than my guesses
it may be chance that has brought you and john landon to this place but i am a lawyer and i have a way of putting this and that together
i have to open the afternoon session of school in a few minutes she interrupted
all right be brief
you came here at the request of somebody probably your sister to find out if you could whether her husband had any claim on the harden brooke farm which was owned by a john landon a hundred years ago
the present john landon or claude miller came because he was down and out and he thought you might give him a lift
do you know sam vane of linhampton heard of him
well hes a mighty slick policeman and hes helped me in this case
but to come to the point
i know where there is a will that gives the whole farm with everything on it to john landon
the old man made the will after the one bequeathing the property to his daughters son who was harden grandfather how it has come down to brooke
he has no more right to that farm than i have
a i donot see how that can be she broke in with sudden indignation i have been told that it had been allowed to run even worse than in the original john time and that mr brooke has worked hard on it for ten years to bring it to its present satisfactory condition
that should give him a right to the farm independently of any will
my dear girl she flashed a look at him that caused him to change his form of address and seemed to jolt his watery eyes closer together
miss severly i mean
there can be no right except under the law
i will show you or tell you where that will is so that john landon and of course your sister will get this farm
all i ask is a thousand dollars cash
the farm is valued at ten thousand
a thousand for my services is too little but i want to see the rightful heir get his own
then there is another consideration
i am here to have john landon arrested and taken back to philadelphia
if i make this arrangement with him through you why i be able to find him
you understand
he gave her a sly wink that made her fingers itch to bestow a ringing slap on his pasty face
all she did however was to take up the school bell from her desk
i see
school is going to take up again he squeaked his smirk widening
well come back at five oclock for my answer and i would advise you to be here then if you want to keep your sisters husband out of jail
as for the will i donot mind telling you that it isnot a thousand miles from the old farmhouse over there for the present
i wish i could come to school to you
only afraid be making love to my teacher
marcus tolman made a quick exit
perhaps it was well for him that he did
there was a heavy ebony ruler on letha desk and she dropped the bell to reach for it just as the check suit followed the aggressive yellow shoes out of the door
the girl shrugged her shoulders and laughed as the door closed
nevertheless two tears of angry annoyance appeared like dewdrops on her cheeks
she brushed them away quickly but she could not brush away the feeling of humiliation caused by the interview that had been forced upon her
the coarseness of mr tolman had seemed to exhale from his person so that letha felt actually sticky with it
she glanced up at the clock
it was time to call the children in
but she did not take up the bell again just then
instead she locked the door and opened one belonging to a little room at the back of her desk which had been an extra classroom at one time when the attendance was much larger and which no one entered but herself
come out john she called in a low tone
the person who stepped out was none other than john landon known to harden brooke as claude miller
he wore the old coat and trousers in which he had dropped from the hayloft the afternoon before
but he had on one of clean gray flannel shirts and in his hand was the soft hat which harden had carried up to his room at five oclock in the morning
has he gone was his anxious question
yes you can see him through the window going down the road to the village
i wish i could have got you other things besides the shirt and hat
but i couldnot
i wrapped those up in paper and even then i felt as if i were not acting quite square with marion
you always act square letha he declared earnestly
does tolman know i am still about here afraid he does
what shall i do
i donot want to be lugged back to philadelphia
they will find me guilty if ever they put me on trial
i am innocent but i donot see how to prove it
besides there was that automobile i took to get away in
i left it at the side of the road when i saw a chance to jump a freight for the west
but theyll say i stole it just the same an unlucky devil
if it wasnot for nettie and the kid swipe a gun and end it all
say a thing like that again and do it for you myself with this ruler threatened letha the impatience that goes with redgold hair flaming up suddenly got to get that jewelry back to harden brooke before you can commit suicide
you know that donot you
i know you say it grumbled miller ungraciously
and i mean it
i hate to do it
i donot know whether i can
there are others who have something to say about that
how do i know that they will let me
she gave him a look that made him shuffle his feet nervously
this slight little of his always had had a way of making him stand around when they all lived in philadelphia
now that he was in a worse fix than he ever had been in before with three charges of robbery threatening she was taking hold of his affairs with a firmness which he felt was the only thing that might save him from prison
get back into that room till school is over she ordered as he looked at her pleadingly very much like a dog expecting a whipping
then tell you what you are to do
i must have a little time to think it all out
it never seems to me that you need to study a thing much
your ideas come to you all worked out and by george they are always good
with this tribute he moved back into the little room and she closed and locked the door
then she rang the bell for the afternoon session
meanwhile marcus tolman walking down the road made his own plans which were not intended to benefit either letha severly or her weakfibered brotherinlaw
a leaving the bates home and the longlegged raymond calling for his chauffeur harden drove to bellsville at a speed that barely missed recklessness
something had to be thought up to meet the horrible situation in which he found himself
how was he to explain to raymond bates that he could not produce the jewelry for inspection without admitting that it had been stolen again
harden had faith in his own ability to run down the thief eventually but in the mean time he must keep the loss of the jewels a secret
it would be bad enough to admit it when he had failed
but he would not fail
once let him get his hands on claude miller which should not be difficult and the booty would be recovered as a natural sequence
he drove his car into the bam and assuring himself with a sigh of relief that the bates machine was nowhere in sight he walked thoughtfully over to the house
the telephone bell rang as he entered
it was gertie kelly calling to tell him that she had warned everybody west and south to look out for claude miller and that they had all promised to do so
he hasnot been seen so far she added
you didnot find him in linhampton did you
no was his brief reply
he wanted to shut off the garrulous gertie but it was not easily done
she liked to talk to the goodlooking young farmer whom none of the girls had been able to charm and besides she was desperate in her curiosity to learn what was at the bottom of this claude miller affair
she suspected that it was much more important than harden had intimated
a have you recovered any of the things he stole she asked
not yet
i hope you will hope so
do you think you will get the things back persisted gertie before he could hang up
i think so
he slapped the receiver on the hook but it had not been there five seconds when the bell rang again
deuce take it grumbled harden
what does she want now
he took his time about removing the receiver and the bell rang once more
hello he snapped
it was a mans voice that responded this time with a sonorous that you brooke
raymond bates speaking
this is harden brooke
been expecting you up here
where are you
at home
find i canot come up till the afternoon
will be there to look over my mothers stuff about four oclock
will that suit you
very well
harden contrived to say this in a careless even cheerful tone
it was putting off the evil moment for a little but none the less he would have to face the music later and it was with something approaching despair that he rang off and went into the kitchen to speak to his sister found him marion
but i have lines out and i ought to round him up before night
i suppose you havenot heard anything
nothing she answered as she laid a sisterly hand affectionately upon his arm
but youll get him i know
you always get what you go after
why donot you hunt through the woods where they found the other thief
i will
but i canot spend too much time scouring the country
i have that thirty acres of hay to cut this week
it will be too ripe if i donot get at it soon
marion nodded
she knew her brother would not allow even his anxiety over the robbery to stand in the way of his haying you get somebody to cut the hay she asked
i intend to do that if i can
this is a busy season but i might get that morrison boy to help if i can hire a man to run the mower
morrison has three boys and he might spare me dick call him up this afternoon
but he wonot be much use to me unless i can find a man
he went out to the living room
the next moment he had flung himself upon an individual who stood at the open door of the staircase
he was a heavyset fellow of thirtyfive or so in the bluejeans and shapeless soft hat of a farm laborer behind the times
his square unshaven jaw was set in permanent truculence emphasized by the glittering black eyes under heavy brows
when harden seized him by his massive shoulders and swung him around he glared as if wondering why he had been attacked
now garrett what are you after
speak quick before i smash you
harden brooke had had a great deal to disturb him and his nerves were ajangle
he felt that it would do him good to thrash this discharged hired man of his if there were the slightest excuse for it
he needed the exercise
i ainot doing anything harden growled garrett
i was looking for you
did you think i was upstairs you hear me talking in the kitchen
i was speaking loud enough too thin
you were going to sneak up those stairs if i hadnot come in a mind to land one on your jaw anyhow
the steel thews of the young farmer stiffened and he shook the burly garrett with his left hand while his right fist drew back as if setting for a blow
hold on protested garrett
there ainot no call for you to get mad
i know you done right to fire me
i oughtnot to have kicked that horse and i wouldnot have done it if i hadnot been drinking
but i ant to come back had enough of the city all after a fellows coin
when they get it they chuck him out on his head
you have haying to do got to have somebody
i heard you say so
oh you heard that did you interrupted harden
then you knew i was in the kitchen
well hire you for a week
but you must cut out the drink and if i catch you hurting one of my horses again send you to the hospital
get that
all right
you can bank on me doing the right thing got to say i can do as good a days work as any man you ever had
how did you get here from linhampton walk did you asked harden suspiciously
i didnot pass you on the road just come from there
caught a ride on an automobile
reckon i was in front of you as you came home why you didnot pass me
i came right up to the house and found the door open
i was looking for you when you grabbed me
well come on and get out the mower better cut that fifteen acres in the north field along the state road first
while garrett went about his work with an industry and skilfulness only second to his employers harden looked carefully through his big wood lot and assured himself that claude miller was not there
all the rest of the day he spent in riding about in his car visiting many of his neighbors and making constant inquiries
he had no success and it puzzled him
what had become of the man
about three oclock he came to the schoolhouse on the town line road
he could not help pulling up to look through the window
he had a blurred vision of groups of restless heads and shoulders but could not find among them
he was just going on when the door opened and she stood on the threshold
i havenot found miller he announced havenot seen him have you
his tone and manner were matteroffact but there was a glint in his eyes as he looked at the flushed cheeks of this girl who had stirred him more in a few days than all the gertie kellys had been able to do in years
you have a man working for you havenot you she asked evading his query see somebody in that field above the barns
i thought it was you till you stopped here
garrett the man i discharged for drunkenness
he asked to come back so i put him to work cutting hay
but i donot think i shall keep him a surly fellow and i donot care to trust him with my horses
will he sleep in the house
no give him a cot i have in the loft over the stables
he used to sleep there about half the time when he was with me before
he would rather be there than in a regular bed tramped and beaten his way all over the country worked in dakota for two years and he says the best bedroom in the world is a moving boxcar
well i wonot keep you from your school
if you should happen to hear anything of miller but of course you wonot
how could you
he acknowledged her smiling goodby with a wave of his gloved hand and drove down the road to his ftrnv as he got there he saw a big gray car gliding easily to a smooth halt in front of the barn and raymond bates hailed him from a seat by the side of the driver
here we are brooke
hope i havenot kept you waiting
well the crucial moment had arrived
now what was he to do
i suppose you have the jewelry at the house
run the car to the side of the road turner he directed his chauffeur
now brooke if youre ready
raymond bates had been accustomed all his life to having things done for him as he wanted without trouble to himself
a he had told harden that he would be there to identify the jewelry belonging to his mother and he never doubted that it would be produced
he sauntered up the lawn by the side of harden chatting on indifferent matters entirely at his ease
he did not notice that his companions sunbrowned face showed a peculiar white spot in the middle of each cheek or that the lips were drawn so tightly over the teeth that they too were a purplishwhite
marion peeped at them from her kitchen and there was anxious sympathy in her eyes as they met the fixed gaze of her brother
then she went back and shut the door
she could do nothing but somehow she had faith that harden would find some way out of his dilemma
indeed he had hit upon a plan that would give him more time
that he felt was all he needed
time
if he could have a day or two he would find this wretched tramp who had stolen the treasure
he led his visitor into the office
ah i see
in that safe exclaimed bates nodding approval
it looks strong enough to hold a kings ransom
open her up brooke
harden went over to the safe and turned the knob as if he were working the combination
he did this for more than a minute
then he stood up and looked in dismay at bates the trouble old top asked raymond
forgotten the numbers
it ought to open murmured harden as if reflectively try it again
with deliberate care as it seemed he turned the knob a certain number of times each way watching closely to see that the pointer always stopped at the right place
then he tried the handle as he had done before
but the safe would not open
it must be out of order he said in a distressed tone
unlucky when you want to see the jewelry so particularly
perhaps i didnot do it right try once more
but the next attempt was without result
so were two more that he made
sure you know the combination asked bates lighting a cigarette and immediately throwing it to the floor and stamping out the fire in his impatience
maybe you have the wrong figures
have you got them written down
no
but quite sure of them used them a dozen times since had the safe
but this isnot the first time it hasnot worked
i may have to get a man to come from syracuse to open it
i canot do it today however better call it off for this time and telephone you when i get the door open
never till now had harden brooke supposed he could pretend so successfully
it was his disposition to be entirely open and straightforward
yet here he was twiddling a knob that he knew had nothing to do with fastening the safe and doing it with an air of sincerity that astonished him
i hate to come up here again objected bates
the mater will go into hysterics if i cannot satisfy her this afternoon that her precious gimcracks are all right
you donot know my mother or you wouldnot propose to stand her off even for a day when she is set on a thing
harden brooke was rather glad he did not know the lady if she were likely to be more insistent than her son but he did not say so
instead he made one more pretense of trying to unlock the safe and shrugged his shoulders with a most edifying look of disappointment when he failed no use mr bates have to give it up for today
i am sorry but you see for yourself that it canot be helped the worst of these burglarproof safes
when they do get out of order it takes an expert mechanic to get the door open
bates was not at all inclined to accept this unsatisfactory decision however
but he protested
it seems to me perhaps i can before brooke realized what he intended to do raymond stepped past him and seizing the knob and handle of the safe gave them a violent pull simultaneously
the door swung open
wow ejaculated bates with a triumphant grin
is the inside door unlocked
it was unlocked
flinging it back he hurriedly investigated the interior which obviously contained nothing but the scattered law books and papers
he turned on harden brooke accusingly
where is it he demanded
there is no jewelry in this safe
and by the lord harry he shouted this combination knob is nothing but a bluff lethas enigma
i was not sorry that marcus tolman came at four oclock instead of five as he had said he would
school had been dismissed and the girl was sitting at her desk lines of perplexity between her perfectlyarched brows and a faraway expression in her eyes when he knocked at the door
then she saw that a horse and buggy were outside her window and she recognized it as the property of the blacksmith in the village
come in she called
tolman smirked at her confidently
then he struck what he felt was an easy attitude
leaning on a desk with one hand and crossing one yellow shoe elegantly over the other he fanned himself with his straw hat
my appointment was for five oclock he reminded her
but i borrowed the rig you see out there and got here ahead of time
i saw the children leave so i ventured to knock
he waited for a response but she did not speak and he continued briskly as a lawyer it is my custom to come directly to the point
what is your answer
will you pay me a thousand dollars for that will
it will give john landon the farm and make your sister comfortable financially for the first time since she married him
the reply came short and sharp no
for a moment he appeared to be dumfounded
then he asked with ostentatious meekness i beg your pardon miss severly
are you authorized to decline my offer
yes
if she could have expressed her contempt more forcibly than by answering him in monosyllables she would have done so
a look of ratlike cunning sprang into his little eyes spreading slowly over his whole visage
ah
you are authorized he said smoothly
then you must have seen john landon since this morning
she saw that he was trying to trap her but there was no sign of trepidation as she returned coldly there is nothing else i believe
he moved toward the door
only that it was part of my offer to quash the philadelphia charges against john landon alias claude miller forget that
she did not reply and with his oily smirk in full working order belying the malice in his shifty eyes tolman walked out
through the window she watched him drive down the road until he reached the bend which would take him to bellsville
then locking the outer door she opened the one belonging to the little room and spoke to her brotherinlaw without letting him come out
you are quite sure of what you told me this morning she began in low distinct tones
the man who came from the window of the farmhouse gave something to the other one who was waiting
hugging himself together with a shiver of vague terror he passed a limp hand across his mouth and replied in a tone of puerile petulance of course sure
the moon hadnot quite gone down
it was a little package done up in paper
i heard the paper crackle
the other man opened it and held up something that glittered and sort of tinkled
hello says that guy must have pinched jewelry while he was in there
gee says never mind what you said she broke in
what did the men do
claude miller looked pained and his loose under lip quivered as if he were about to make a tearful remonstrance
but she didnot give him time
the quickest way will be for me to repeat your story as you told it this morning and if i make any mistakes you can correct me
but do it in very few words
if you are to keep out of prison we must hurry
but letha he whined
keep quiet and listen she admonished
when i saw harden brooke taking you up to your bedroom last night i had no chance to speak to you
but had the letter from margaret telling me that tolman was coming here after you
how did he know i would be here and who told margaret
she silenced him with a flash of her dark eyes and went on rapidly my poor sister cares for you though youre such a poor excuse for a man that i donot know why always been good to her he bleated
when i had work and before they framed that job on me at the imperial market i gave her all i made and so early this morning she continued i did what been trying to work up courage for all night
i went up to your room and told you to get away and come here to the school
yes that was a good thing
i gave you back the key didnot the tendency of his mind to run on small things was characteristic
she did a not trouble to answer but warned him with a gesture to pay attention
when you got to the ground you lay down behind the bushes to make sure nobody had seen you
soon these two men came over the lawn and one of them climbed up to your window
he was in the house about ten minutes fifteen i should say
well fifteen
then he came down and gave the package to the waiting man how it was assented miller eagerly
they talked for a while fussing about who should keep the package
then the guy who had it not the one who had been in the house swore and said something i didnot hear except i got the word syracuse and thought he talked about a bank and safe
i know he said box
but it was all jumbled up and he talked down in his throat
there was something about merchandise or mercantile too
that will do stay here till i come back with some food
i donot know how long i shall be
mind you donot show yourself at the window
she had opened the door and after cautiously surveying the road both ways was about to step out when claude miller laid a tremulous hand on her arm
look here letha
you know i didnot do that thing in philadelphia donot you he pleaded
if i didnot feel certain of it i wouldnot raise my hand for you not even for my sisters sake was her cleancut answer as she went out and closed the door listening to make sure he turned the key inside
any one who might have seen this trim pretty girl walking easily down the road in the direction of the harden brooke farm loose ends of her shining hair blowing about her cheeks would certainly have been attracted by her elflike beauty
on the other hand he would have ridiculed the suggestion that weighty matters were on her mind
as she entered the house loud voices in the office made her pause
raymond bates and harden brooke were talking over the absence of the jewels from the safe and it was evident that the former was suspicious yet reputation for absolute honesty and unblemished integrity had spread far beyond the bounds of bellsville
but how do you account for it mr brooke
raymond demanded as letha reached the halfopen door
you said the jewelry was in this safe andthat the only reason you could not show it to me was that you couldnot get the door open
yet when i opened it very easily considering that you couldnot do it with all your trouble there was nothing inside but a few books and bundles of law papers
the question is where are my mothers jewels
mechanically harden fumbled among the papers in the safe while his mind worked busily
he could not see a way out but it was some relief not to be obliged to look into raymond incredulous face
harden was not used to deception
you canot find them can you barked raymond
no
they certainly are not here
well then what is your theory
raymond bates was the son of a wealthy man and most of his time was devoted to the mere joy of living
but he had inherited the business instinct and his tones were hard
there is only one theory replied harden
that is that the jewelry must have been stolen for the second time
that seems to be the only explanation assented raymond with a keen look
yet i donot understand why you could not open the door when it gave way at my first pull
that is very simple
everybody knows that often a defective lock will stick fast for a long time and then all at once without any apparent reason yield of its own accord
this safe lock has its whims like any other
it weis at this moment that harden caught sight of letha standing at the door
he was quick to seize an opportunity by speaking to her to turn raymond thoughts in another direction for a few moments
good afternoon letha
good afternoon she responded
i beg your pardon if i am intruding
but i could not help overhearing you say that you had missed some valuable property and mr raymond bates miss severly interrupted harden introducing them
she smiled graciously upon the tall mr bates and he embarrassed by the unexpected advent of a beautiful young woman blushed until his neck face and particularly his outstanding ears were in a condition of violent inflammation
miss severly is my cousin several times removed explained harden
indeed
you are to be pit i mean envied of course
ahem
ah
i er beg your pardon stammered raymond
while young mr bates never quite composed in the presence of a pretty girl floundered miserably in his endeavor to present a graceful front letha conveyed to harden with a slight raising of her brows and a lightning dart from her dark eyes that he must follow her lead
was it the beautiful necklace and things you showed me last night that you were looking for in that safe harden she asked smiling
yes cut in raymond becoming more coherent when business took the place of social exchanges
they belonged to my mother
they were taken from our house by a burglar who was captured
later they were placed in the care of mr brooke
i came here to identify them
but when we opened the safe they were not there interrupted letha still smiling
i could have told you that before you looked
you broke out harden
why what can you know about mr bates she continued calmly ignoring interjection that safe is not to be trusted
you have seen that for yourself
the jewelry belonging to a your mother is in a safe deposit box in syracuse in syracuse
yes
mr brooke has been away all day
his sister and i both know that anybody can open that safe if he tries long enough
was it not natural for his sister and his cousin to take the liberty of conveying such a treasure to a place of real safety
and what safer place can there be than the vaults of a bank
turning to harden she added with smiling contrition
i hope you wonot be angry with us
but you can assure mr bates that the jewelry is in a safe deposit box in syracuse and that it can be produced when required
well when can i see it asked raymond
my mother is it necessary for you to see it at all she asked quickly only to identify it
but she smiled
mr brooke has no package of jewelry except what was taken from your house by the burglar so there canot be any question that it is mrs property
you can set her mind at ease by telling her it is in a place of perfect security in a syracuse bank
what bank is it
my safe deposit box is in the second mercantile she replied
there was a pause during which raymond bates tried not to look conscious that she was gazing at him with mischievous amusement
at last he blurted out very well miss severly
i will tell my mother
it was er very good of you to take so much interest in the matter
i appreciate it i am sure
well to be frank mr bates i did it for my cousin harden more than for you
still i am glad that you approve what done
i only hope harden wonot scold me too much when you have gone
this was a hint that raymond bates felt obliged to take
there was no excuse for his remaining any longer
so he stammered out a confused thank you miss severly
good afternoon and managed somehow to get out of the office and the house
as the big car surged away in a cloud of smoke and dust harden brooke turned to letha with a puzzled smile that was quite without mirth was an ingenious way of ing me out letha said harden looking curiously at her
but it is only a temporary expedient
what shall we do when he finds weve been lying to him
who says weve been lying she countered with an enigmatic smile
some stories that seem doubtful are marvelously like the truth you think mr bates believed me
perhaps
but it will be easy for him to telephone the second mercantile bank in syracuse and find out whether you have a safe deposit box there or not
he canot very well telephone tonight
by the time he gets back to linhampton there will be nobody at the bank except the night watchman and he wonot know true admitted harden reflectively
but he can get the bank in the morning and it will come to the same thing
for that matter there may be somebody there tonight who can give him the information
it wonot be late when he reaches home
i know you meant well but when he learns that you have no box at the second mercantile he will be so suspicious that i am afraid the whole truth will come out
look at it as i may i can see only that i am in a very bad fix
not so bad but that you can get out of it if you follow carefully the clues in your hands
there will be no time for that afraid
what i have to do first of all is to hide from the bateses the fact that you have no box at the bank
there is only one way to do that and it will be an off chance
what is that way
for you to be in syracuse when the bank opens in the morning and rent a box
i should say raymond bates is not an early riser and you may have the box in your name before he telephones
of course the bank will tell him so and he will be satisfied
he wonot know how long youve had it
letha looked at the office door to satisfy herself that it was tightly closed
then she broke into a ripple of laughter that harden thought was the most musical sound he ever had heard and this too in spite of his being worried almost to despair over his dilemma
your plan has a great deal to recommend it she conceded as her laugh quieted down to the smile which always bewitched him
but it is unnecessary
unnecessary
what do you mean
only that i need not rent a box in the second mercantile bank because i have a box there already
and are the jewels in it
i did not say so
you told raymond bates they were
no
not even that she corrected
although i gave him that impression
if you will try to recall exactly what was said it was this after i had told him his mothers property was in a box in a syracuse bank he asked what bank
i remember perfectly
and you recollect that i evaded his question by saying my safe deposit box is in the second mercantile
yes and of course he took it for granted naturally
he supposed i meant the jewelry was in that box
i admit i wished him to think so
but you see i did not actually make such an assertion
harden brooke drew in and emitted a long breath and passed a hand across his forehead
this is too deep for me he confessed
what does it all mean
you really have a box in the second mercantile bank
yes
i rented it two weeks ago i have papers of some value as well as other articles that i do not care to carry around with me and it has been my custom for a year or two to have a safe deposit box
it is not expensive and it saves a great deal of anxiety
and are mrs diamonds there
no
if they were i should have told you at once
but she added quickly as his face fell tell you for your comfort that i am pretty sure they are in some safe deposit box in syracuse
why do you think so
i canot tell you now
if you will trust me for a day or two i feel sure i can lay my hand on the thief or thieves for there is more than one in the plot
but i must be allowed a free hand for the present
harden gazed earnestly at the fair young face with its sweetlycurved lips and the eyes glistening with selfconfidence
then he decided that he must let her haye her way
i will not interfere with you he promised
thanks
she smiled reassuringly and tripped away to talk to marion in the kitchen
as for harden although he had pledged himself not to hinder her plans by asking questions or making suggestions he mentally reserved to himself the privilege of following any independent line of action that might lead to the recovery of the stolen treasure
the capture of the thieves while important was a secondary consideration
he went out to the barns where garrett had already begun the feeding and bedding of stock and other stable tasks that come under the general head of chores
there was no conversation between the two men
but harden helped in thd work in a way giving an occasional brief direction which garrett acknowledged with a grunt
so it was not long before everything was done including the milking and pasturing of the cows and harden strode over the lawn for supper
a am i to come too growled garrett
i suppose i get supper donot his employer did not relish having this surly illconditioned fellow at the table with marion and letha
but there was no way out of it and five minutes later garrett was washing his face and hands outside the kitchen door waiting for the call to the meal
supper was nearly over with nobody speaking except in monosyllables when garrett turned to harden heard anything about that fellow who got away with your stuff last night have you the man who was working for you
no was short reply
he must have climbed down the ivy out of his window eh
i donot know
garrett scowled at the noncommunicative harden but did not press his questions
soon he had finished his meal and getting up from the table abruptly without a word shambled out of the house to lounge about until it should be time for him to seek his cot in the hayloft
i didnot suppose he knew anything about the robbery said harden as he watched his hired man going down the lawn
who told him
i saw him talking to the driver of that motorcar that brought mr bates answered marion
afterward when mr bates started home garrett was leaning over the car asking something i suppose for i saw mr bates speaking to him and garrett nodded
raymond bates is one of those loosemouthed idiots who doesnot know enough to keep his business to himself commented harden no doubt he told garrett all about it
letha said nothing
she left the room while marion and her brother were still talking and hastily collected what food she could in the kitchen for the hungry claude miller whom she had left waiting for her in the schoolhouse
it was dark when she got there but she did not light any of the lamps
she knew her way about well enough to find her way to the door of the room in which she had instructed her to stay
it was only when she found that the door was wide open and that he did not answer when she called him both as claude miller and john she struck a match and looked about her
there was no one in the building but herself involuntarily she let the match bum down almost to her fingers before she blew it out
she lighted another quickly for as the flame died down on the first one she had noticed a small folded paper on her desk
there were other papers there which had prevented her observing it before
she read the few penciled words on it before her second match was exhausted
they were had to leave
will see you later
john
for a minute or more she stood in the darkness reflecting
she was certain to begin with that her had not left of his own volition
somebody had come and made him go
it must have been marcus tolman
she decided also after very short consideration that tolman had not arrested him
in the first place he was not a police officer so could not do so legally and again if her weakkneed relative were a prisoner of the law he would have said so
she took her regular seat behind her desk to think it out further
at the end of five minutes she had come to a conclusion
getting up briskly she left the schoolhouse and as she closed the door which fastened with a spring lock she stood and listened
not a sound indicated the proximity of any one about but herself
so still carrying the parcel of food she had brought with her she went back to the farmhouse
harden has gone out with his car announced marion
he said he might not be home till late
a the doors and windows of the house all secured asked letha when the two young women had settled down in the spacious livingroom marion sewing and letha with a book
i do not trust that man garrett
neither do returned marion
that is why i have locked and bolted jthe outside doors and the stair door
i canot do anything upstairs except shut down the window of the room belonging to the hired man because everything is open up there
but we can prevent anybody getting down to us
and there is nothing up there that could be stolen
nothing that i know of
letha smiled and shook her head
you did not know the bates jewelry was up there
yet it was and it seems other people knew it as well as harden
i should like to look about that upper story if you will come with me
we might come across something else that would attract burglars now that harden is away
i wouldnot go up there tonight for a million dollars declared marion
but i do not expect burglars to come again
who is to know that harden isnot at home
he often goes down to the village with his car in the evening and unless some one is watching nobody could say when he comes back true assented letha
but i should like to go up to that floor
those old beams and the way they are laid have interested me very much
not for me was resolute negative
if you want to go do it
but i wouldnot if i were you
letha dropped the subject and seemed to bury herself in her book
occasionally she and marion would exchange a few words but most of the time thoughts were racing along as she tried to decide what her next move should be leading not only to the recovery of the jewels but the capture of the thieves as well
it would have been comparatively easy if her had not disappeared
with his help she believed she held the key to the mystery
now she would have to begin all over again
at nine oclock marion who had been nodding for half an hour or more declared that she must go to bed
she was too sleepy to see her needle and she had to be up at five you sleepy letha
you ought to be for you had little rest last night to say nothing of the awful time you put in with that strange man your head pain you
nothing to speak of was careless response
i am not at all sleepy just now
but i dare say i soon shall be
you go to bed and stay up and read a while longer
perhaps harden will be home
then we shall both feel safer in our rooms
is he certain to be very late
i donot know going on business about the robbery
i think hes heard something about that claude miller
of course he is the thief
but harden may be home soon
he only said he might be late
well go to bed she added with a yawn as she got up from her chair
good night dear
it was very lonely when marion had gone into her room and closed the door and letha wondered why the wind always blew so much harder around the house than elsewhere
for half an hour she sat book in hand listening
then she got up and softly opened the door of room which like her own adjoined the livingroom
marion was fast asleep
it was now that letha did a peculiar thing
she went into the office where the big safe was the principal article of furniture but which contained besides an a open rolltop desk and took from a pigeonhole in the desk an electric flashlight
then she opened the door of the stairway and went softly to the floor above
she shuddered as she passed the open trap above the stairway and had difficulty in repressing a scream when some unseen creature flapped loudly almost in her very face
but she held herselfin and indulged in a little smile at her own fear
she remembered that bats held high carnival at night in this ghostly place
harden brooke had told her so more than once
the bat flew out of one of the big window openings and letha went about her investigations with businesslike composure
that she was possessed of strong nerves notwithstanding her delicate frame and sweet face has been demonstrated already
she felt that she needed all her nerve now
on the other hand she did not hesitate in the task she had set herself which was to find the will for which marcus tolman had demanded a thousand dollars
he had been indiscreet enough to admit that it was not a thousand miles from the farmhouse and letha had soon come to the conclusion that if old john landon had secreted it anywhere most probably it was here among these ancient beams and rafters
she had been up here before and had noticed the star and arrow cut into the beams even before marion who had accompanied her pointed them out
she had seen the initials too
when tolman talked about the will it was natural for letha to associate these symbols and letters with the unknown hidingplace
that tolman had taken her brotherinlaw away from the schoolhouse she felt sure
also she believed his disappearance had something to do with this will that tolman meant to turn to his own profit
her purpose was to obtain possession of it before the rascal could get it
then she could bargain with him on behalf of the unfortunate john landon who was so pitifully unable to take care of himself
the swinging beam under which had been hidden the bates jewelry and where harden brooke had found the old coins was still displaced and it did not take a girl of letha quickness of apprehension long to understand the principle on which it had been made to move when properly manipulated
she argued that other beams might be swung aside if one knew the secret of them
so she tried two of them but without result
then she turned the light of her flash on the arrow and star alternately until with a low ejaculation of satisfaction she believed she had hit on the solution
examining the star closely she noted that it had five rays
also that one ray was noticeably longer than any of the others
taking this as a guide she found that it pointed to a place midway between two of the beams
for a moment she was at a loss
then throwing her light upon the arrow she observed that it aimed in the same parallel direction as the long ray of the star but three feet to the left
between the two imaginary lines was a beam
a pause for inspection and calculation and letha was working to remove a wooden tongue like that which had been found by harden in another beam and which he had accidentally broken off
it did not take her long to decide that she must have some sharp tool to get the tongue out
she looked about her but there was nothing there
a little shrug of vexation and down she went cautiously to the kitchen where she knew a box of carpenters tools was kept
in a few minutes she was up again with a chisel and hatchet
naturally handy it did not take her long with the aid of these implements to extract the tongue
then with slight exertion she swung the beam aside and upward revealing the same sort of cavity as that in which harden had so vainly secreted the bates jewelry she had just time to take out two folded papers yellowed by age and to replace the beam with the tongue thrust back into place when a slight scraping outside one of the yawning window openings made her switch off the light and hide behind a pile of old lumber in a far corner
listening intently she knew that the scraping was caused by the placing of a ladder against the outside wall
she could hear labored breathing and then three men crawled in and stood still
it was very dark but the stars enabled her to make out the outlines of the three intruders
she saw that one was thin and rather tall another shorter and stocky of build and the third a burly individual who seemed to be in command
to be concluded course when a man is being paid a hundred and forty a month by a young millionaire as wireless operator on said millionaires yacht and he is only a secondrate amateur at wireless anyhow its hardly appropriate to step up to the gift horse pull its teeth apart and start criticising the beast
but i maintained a certain degree of independence by quarreling with my boss about twice as often as i really wanted to
i had got through college on the money he had paid me to get him through
but my lord man i had once demanded of him what in the world are you getting out of your education
an awful lot of fun you old grind louis hartman had retorted
and the use of your brains is the least expensive part of most of it
but what will you know
why should i know anything
always sure of being able to hire somebody else to do the knowing
it was wofully true
the millions old gottfried hartmann made out of sausage will keep louis busy spending them for a long while especially if he always hires somebody else to run the business
of course he didnot live down to his idiotic philosophy
if he had never have accepted his invitation for that winters cruise around the west indies
as i said before i could afford to argue with him quite heatedly but it wasnot my place to tell hint where to take his yacht
but when he dropped a light anchor half a mile off what looked like a big ash heap or coal dump with a fringe of unhealthy palms around it having sailed four days from as sunkissed and amusementproviding a little harbor as ever lured other yachtsmen like himself i was ready to get down to personalities
it was probably the last yachting trip ever have
then having ordered the tender lowered he came up and slammed me on the back remarking some things worth being rich for after all eh
for sake what
i demanded crossly
that dump
but your glass havenot you used it he cried fixing his own on a certain spot and keeping it very steady
i had used mine for a tensecond sweep over the whole of that unsightly pile and had decided that further inspection wasnot worth the strain on my eyes
to humor him i raised it again
it was one of many and powerful enough to make mars look like a goodsized marble
and i happened to hit the spot at which glass was trained
instantly i perceived that that ugly little island had a beauty all its own
she was almost halfconcealed by one of the decrepit palms branches
but i could see twothirds of her face also an arm with the sleeve well above the elbow likewise a glimpse of the belt that connected her shirtwaist with one of those narrow skirts they wore before they began to take half a yard off the bottom to make them fuller and finally a pair of natty white boots that actually looked small
i gave the screw of the glass half a turn until she looked as if she were standing about ten feet away from me and i was all for that island if i had to swim to it
then she raised a huge pair of binoculars and pointed them straight at us
for an instant i dropped my glass and so did louie rude to stare at a pretty girl and have her see that youre staring
huh grunted louie
she isnot acting a bit encouraging
she wasnot
if ever gesticulations bade one to depart full speed ahead or astern immediately if not sooner and to keep on departing she was giving us the high sign to get scarce
but louie muttered i never was any good at reading signals
i think wed better go over and make sure of what she means
hey pete is that ladder down
all ready sir pete responded
come on harry louie invited me
and i went a lot rather have gone by myself have given a years salary as a wireless operator on yacht to have fifteen minutes alone with that young lady ashore in which to inform her that louie looked intelligent only because taught him about half of what i know that he wasnot a really tiptop overgrown boy but a halfwitted boob and that any money he displayed he had obtained by stealing from me enough to outfit a small gunboat and rob a belgian relief ship
but the motor tender was a lot the fastest thing that could get us across the shallows to that shore
so i got aboard it and reflected glumly that the idiot hadnot sense enough to leave me ashore that he just took it for granted that a real girl like that would never see my brains over his little pile of gold
for most of the last half mile of that run i raised a faint hope that the tender would hit something that would rip half her bottom out
i could swim a good bit faster if not quite so far as louie
i kept up the hope until we were less than a hundred yards from shore and could have talked to the girl if she hadnot been holding her finger to her lips in a fashion that would have enforced silence on a class of boys at a baseball game
then i reversed my hopes so suddenly that it jarred my whole system
we had hit something
tom healy at the engine reversed it as suddenly as i had reversed my hoping apparatus
nor he nor billy nock at the wheel nor louie nor i had ever seen a mine of any kind before
but we knew we were seeing one now
as i look back on it it wasnot a very big mine
but if the whole world ever looks as big to me as that mine did just then afraid get worldly
for some reason it didnot go off that time
but healy was so scared he forgot to shift the clutch ahead again until we were backing up and then the clutch bound and the engine stalled
and billy nock was so rattled he forgot to steer backward so that we just set sternforemost for that round head of steel
back back at that steel can of sudden and unpremeditated death
the girl gave a shriek of terror that made my startled stomachpit sink a mile or so
it completely drove from my head the plan i had suddenly formed and was rising to execute a dive over the opposite side
it made hand slip from the crank and dropped him full length in the forward cockpit
i never shall know what it did to billy nock
for i was watching with fascinated horror the movements of louie who was leaping over the stem deck and sticking his foot out to push the mine and us apart before we made another more violent bump than the bare shave we had accomplished the first time
it might be the height of presence of mind it might be just a little the worst thing in the world to do
louie didnot know i didnot know nobody knew
we just waited and waited and boom
as i toppled off the cockpit seat i saw louie drop overboard
that is all i can account for
and then just before i passed away there came another boom a trifle muffled so that it didnot sound much too large for the general blowup of creation
i donot really believe i fainted or lost consciousness
my first impression tended to confirm the old adage that marriages are made in heaven
for there right before my eyes stood the wonderful girl though we had never even been introduced to each other on earth
but my next sense was one of doubt about the heaven part of it
my head had hit and was still resting on a corner of the hot exhaust muffler and there was nothing suggestive of heaven about that or in the remark i heard louis sputtering in the water outside the boat
i could not imagine any one in heaven exclaiming huh
well be damned
since he was going right on pretty vociferously making himself the noisiest center for the moment i got up and began to rub the scorched back of my head preparatory to stepping over to the side where he clung
then i didnot step
i stood still and stared
it wasnot our little mine that had blown up at all
the lesser bang had evidently issued from a gun on the deck of a very businesslike little patrol launch which was now proceeding deviously but with evident intent of reaching yacht
a blurry puff of blue smoke hung lazily about a hundred yards behind the launchs present position
but about a quarter of a mile seaward from our small ship was a bank of yellow smoke that made a perfect cloud of itself
it was a mine blown up out there to hint to the captain of the yacht that it might be safer to lie still and have a talk than to attempt any swift getaway
apparently the little tender had escaped observation thus far and the owner of the yacht was supposed to be aboard
i figure that the heavy fog which had broken but fifteen minutes before our arrival at the island had enabled us to get in unobserved especially since we had arrived on that side of the island where there was no sign of life
the only explanation i have ever thought up for our getting through the nice network of mines as we did is because yacht was one of those extreme shallowdraft affairs which really had no business venturing quite so far at sea at all and couldnot have hit a mine that couldnot have been in plain view of a lookout on a real steamer
however it had happened there we were and there was the yacht between the terrifically evident mines and the perfectly obvious and leisurely selfassured patrol boat
also there was the girl
she recurred to my mind when louie now only kneedeep in the water stopped his profane sputterings and turned to her
as he spoke too looked at her
she was half hysterical over all that had happened
it takes quite a girl to look beautiful and half hysterical at the same time
but that girl was doing it perfectly
i permitted myself under protection of query to gain a complete survey of her attractions
surely those dainty hands and feet were french or spanish or something romantic though the blondness of her hair and skin proclaimed that she must have come from the northern part of any of the latin countries she had darkbrown eyes
i was thinking very fast
if she were only french or even spanish it would be all off for louie
heaven grant that she be not german
for louie could get away with whatever dialect his sausagemaking father had brought over with him
but louie was trying her in plain english
pardon me but could you possibly tell me what it all means
i fairly ached for a je ne le comprends pas or no entiendo to
but that fairy vision spoke queen english she spoke it fluently not to say gaseously and in perfect fifth avenue style above a hundred and tenth street
i quote
i cannot bear even yet to comment you bet your crayon portrait i can tell you what its all about about a years residence on this coal dump for yous though there ainot no particular good reason for hopin it wonot be six years
if you two tender babes had had the sense between you to take the cue i was tryin to hand you you might a made a getaway with that pretty little toy ship of yourn
but now you might just as well let me pinch the bunch of yez instead of waitin for the guard to wake up and poke you around the beach with a bayonet
you cn come quiet and peaceable please and the baron will listen to any other particular questions thats on yer minds
we started peaceable and quiet
she turned to tom healy and billy nock
yous cn come along too she invited
and they came too
it wasnot much over half a mile to the end of the coalheap along a wellbeaten path at its base
then we turned along the inner side of what now showed itself to be almost a ring with a snug little harbor in the middle
louie had told me he was going into the harbor if the island proved worth looking over
we were going into it all right
and here were buildings long low shacks of the most temporary construction also some of the heavy concrete walls that are known as the protectors of ordnance by any one who has ever been to fort wadsworth
warped to a dock in the middle of this little harbor lay a long black ship which just about filled the capacity of the place
it certainly would have been squeezing to put two such ships in there at once
louie gave me one gasping look
i handed it back to him
we both knew
we had stumbled upon the hidden coaling station of that mysterious raider that had been making the newspapers interesting when we had last seen any we could read at porto rico
and that grim monster into which just then men were carrying almost at a run huge bags of the soft black coal piled to the height of a small hill all over the island that was the raider herself
before we had gone another fifteen feet a younglooking officer ran down the hill to meet us
the girl brought us to a halt
here rudy are four of the men off that yacht out there she introduced us
they got off in a little gasboat before captain heiny seen em i reckon
anyhow they landed down at the other end
gott
rudy exclaimed
and you bring dem guys up here all by yourself already
say mamie you could take it from me youll get one iron cross from der kaiser yet
mamie laughed disdainfully
not i reckon fr bringin up them boobs
they come like they was little lambs what i was leadin to pasture
gee ought to seen em
they got mixed up pretty close with one o them little bombs along the shore just about the time the friedrich fired a shot and you let go the mine the other side of the yacht
this soaked guy went clean overboard
the other toppled into the cockpit an lay still with the muffler singein his hair and neck
and these two makebelieve sailors just laid down to die anywhere the layin was good and handy
rudy had turned now and started back with us toward the row of shacks nestling in the hollow of the great crescent of soft coal
he bade the girl follow
meanwhile i was making an inventory of rudy
all told he looked good to me and he sounded better
his broken english was not the sort a german learns in school but the kind one picks up in a stay of a few years right around new york city apparently that same idea of the young officer had occurred to hartmann
say herr offizier he spoke in that utterly nonchalant manner which is the similitude of his entire attitude toward everything would you mind giving us some sort of steer as to what theyre going to do to us for accidentally stumbling on this delightful little island of yours
i donot know herr offizier rudy replied quite seriously
it would make a whole lot of difference for why you want to come to our delightful little island get plenty of chance to exblain that to dem herrn capitan
whether he believes you might be something else again see
but but louie began
anyhow i ainot supposed to talk with you fellows
but say his voice dropped you donot neither of you happen to come from newark do you
why my fathers sausage factory is out on the meadows hastily responded hartmann
you donot happen to know anybody by name of shiffen on sixth street number a hundert and one
i got one sister named hilda what boards there when i come away
her and mamie here ainot never got along good you know how girls is
so mamie donot know nothin about whether still there or alive or dead yet
louie apologized for his utter ignorance of newark beyond his fathers factories save as to the main streets by which motorists get through and out of that town
his regret sounded pretty genuine
it must be devilish hard he mourned to be cut off from your relatives like this
i could have understood his regret if louie werenot half as sympathetic a big kid as he is
i was regretting a lot myself and was guessing whether it would be safe to assure out keeper that i knew his sister hilda perfectly
the trouble would be that if he asked any questions about newark be caught bluffing
i donot remember ever seeing even a picture postcard of newark
anyhow i didnot have time to take the chance
in another moment we had been ushered into the august presence of herr lieutenant baron von hilberstein a pinkcheeked blueeyed goldenhaired youth of a trifle over twenty who stood up to greet us looking as if he was afraid to death of us
it was not of us however that he was afraid
it was of his own almost faultlessly though much too carefully pronounced english
i trust gentlemen he said when he had managed some form of general introduction you will understand our inquisitiveness from the fact that the usefulness of our station here depends entirely upon our enemies ignorance of its existence
you will also appreciate that it is difficult for us to understand why you should have brought your yacht here from so pleasant a resort as san juan oh yes we have been the ones inquiring your position every few hours under different wireless names
we even tried to head you off days ago by a storm warning you did not choose to heed
we tried again this morning but could not get you
now we see that you have passed forty or fifty more attractive islands without giving them a look
you choose this of all others
you will not mind explaining why i hope
if worse came to worst i could have explained the only reason i had ever come
my desire to be anywhere on that island had begun when i had caught sight of that pretty girl who had turned out very disappointing thus far
it might be an unpleasant thing to explain in the presence of the young lady herself but it wasnot pleasant having that pink boy looking at us as if he thought we were dangerous while he had it in his power to order us blindfolded and shot
i had come because louie had brought me thus far
but louie well louie faltered something raising within him a creepy sensation that what he had to say didnot sound much like sense you see this island is down on the chart as uninhabited
nobody seemed to know much of anything about it except that it was on the chart
i i got the notion it might be interesting to explore er explore the place up a little donot you know
i he broke off growing red in the face
exploring an island as small as that and already perfectly indicated on the charts it did sound weak
i see our inquisitor broke in
some such curiosity i take it as animated his excellency expresident roosevelt to discover the river of doubt this with the merest trace of a smile under the fuzzy mustache
louie and i both laughed nervously
oh i i just took the notion whim i guess you might call it boyish nonchalance was all but going to pieces
i see i see
the young officer spoke as if in a hurry to let it go at that
he was wonderfully businesslike considering his apparent age
and no doubt it was a similar whim which led you to come in close behind our minefield under cover of a fog at the top of the tide
also seeing you had no idea about the place except that it was uninhabited beyond what the charts show it was certainly not reason but whim pure and simple which caused you to anchor your vessel outside when the charts indicated a safe harbor as the only possible advantage of the spot
louie threw up his hands
he grinned amiably at the girl
murder will out he cried flushing
i hope this young lady will forgive me
you he turned again toward her will have to admit that hes driving me to it
the captain got a little mixed deadreckoning in the fog and we thought we were going down to the front door of your harbor all right he went on
in fact we thought we were over a mile beyond it and making a wide circuit to get the end of the channel as the chart shows
if the fog had waited another ten minutes to lift i imagine wed have come very near trying to climb your coal mound for we thought we had half a mile more to the turn
the first look i got at the shore gave me the notion that i didnot want to land at all and i was on the point of giving the order to back out and start for something more interesting when i happened to see the lady here
the island was not uninhabited
i credit all of you with taste enough to understand that such a sample citizen of any land would tempt one to take the shortest cut to some acquaintance with it
it might have broken the tension entirely but its effect did not reach that
the boyish lieutenant blushed a shade deeper while he smiled as if he would rebuke himself for levity in so serious a moment
only rudy seemed to laugh wholeheartedly as if we had somehow tickled his personal vanity
of course louie and i emitted a sort of choked spasm of a chuckle which was more or less hysterical
but the girl thus flattered or honored as she might choose looked highly indignant and spoke the nerve of him
say just like to ask you and she turned on louie if them glasses of youm was so good you could see all these bewitchin charms hanging onto me if i didnot hand you as many signs to beat it as a person could hand out who didnot know the deafanddumb for scat gawd knows i didnot aim to act invitin
you certainly didnot louie admitted
but your actions failed to outweigh your good looks
freshie she uttered in deep scorn and stuck out her tongue at hartmann in dead earnest
whereupon the pinkfaced lieutenant cleared his throat for action again
this is hardly a time for jesting he asserted with that deep solemnity one has to use if he isnot going to give up being solemn altogether and laugh
while i shall not take any hasty action there being plenty of time so far as i can see for full consideration of details and consultation with the superior officers of such vessels as are supplied here it must be quite patent to both of you that a much more rational hypothesis to account for your presence than the highly whimsical one you have given would be to the effect that you represent your government in having entertained some suspicion of this island and in attempting to satisfy that suspicion under guise of an innocent yachting cruise representing my government gasped louie
why my dear erlieutenant that is preposterous
that yacht of mine is absolutely private property no more a member of the united states army or navy than you are
i ah coldly rejoined the lieutenant his mild blue eyes growing sharp and hard perhaps there has been a mistake
perhaps it is another louisa and another mr louis hartmann who owns the yacht listed as a member of the united states power squadron of new york which was number ninetysix in the practise maneuverings held in new york bay last september
there are times when one can get through more thinking in thirty seconds than he could accomplish in thirty ordinary hours of close application
my first thought caused me to give one startled glance at louie
i was afraid hed blow up and say things unbecoming a quasinaval officer made prisoner by a german herr baron
if theres one thing calculated to get louie started its the united states power squadron
he was enthusiastically in that effort to give amateur owners of pleasure vessels the proud feeling that they were practically commanders in the he was in it at the start
he had stayed in it up to this extremely parlous moment
most of the members of the are ready any minute to swear that they were asked to form their association by the authorities of the navy
there isnot any question that they formed it
they trained themselves like anything
those of them who were rich enough got new boats that looked as warlike as a deckcleared battleship
and then the navy didnot take them on
it was a great disappointment
it was worse
it was an outrage
it was an unspeakable act of ingratitude to the high minded patriots who had spent themselves and their hardinherited gold
the thought that after all uncle unappreciative ungrateful failure to recognize his pet society he should be here actually accused of acting as a spy in danger of being summarily shot for being a spy this thought was enough to get louie started
it did then and there
louie forgot the lady
he forgot his own danger
he forgot everything but the raw deal suffered by the united states power squadron at the hands of the united states navy
he surely taught that pinkcheeked lieutenant a lot of english not to be got out of any books published while anthony comstock was alive or even since
oh it was lucky for louie that in peace times you canot commit treason against the united states government with your mouth
even at that i donot know as he could have got away with some of the stuff he put across except in a very close circle of friends
and although the kaiser and woodrow wilson were just then weeping on each others necks in warlike and peaceful peace notes it wasnot right to give the impression that our navy could be chased out of the sea by a properly manned and managed fleet of model sailboats
louie did that as heard him do it before and he went on to pay his respects to all the other departments of the government in a fashion to have made the king of siam wonder if it werenot his duty to humanity to take us in order to provide us with a government if not quite kultured at least endowed with a faintly human intelligence
if that pinkfaced baron wirelessed half of remarks to wilhelm its no wonder the imperial government decided that no ruthless submarining could be so insane as getting mixed up in peace efforts with the halfwitted brainsoftened seniledecayed defective louie painted for uncle sam no wonder the baron softened toward us
he probably thought it would be a shame to waste bullets on the deadliest possible spies from a hostile chickenrun
is that true herr corporal he asked of rudy
about this here power squadron rudy responded i ainot never heard nothing in america
i wasnot there long enough yet to be buyin me hundredthousanddollar yachts to play navy games with
but by the time he had said this the american girl had got from the corner of the little room to which she had receded
she had planted herself squarely in front of louie
her cheeks were blazing and her brown eyes had turned the color of good anthracite
do you know anything about it vetterchen
von hilberstein asked her
about what she asked with the craokle of fire in a pine board
about this power squadron
power squadron she repeated hotly
no cousin mine i never heard a darn thing about it till right now
but i can guess a lot moren heard
if this here boobs a specimen of this power squadron outfit i can guess hes got the wrong steer about why it ainot recognized by the united states navy
i can guess a lot better reason than hes give because the united states navy ainot so hard up for hospital ships as to be takin floatin bughouses already loaded with loonatics even at a gift because the little navy ainot and never was no asylum for feebs even though they might have the dough to buy their own floatin nurseries and hire their own nurses
an while talkin herr cousin lieutenant baron heiny von hilberstein goin to tell you these here ainot no spies
the united states ainot got no such system of spies as you dutchmen to be sendin suspicious reports about what the cop of squeedunk crossin ate for his dinner mebbe but the united states when she needs a spy cn afford the few cents extra to get one what could tell a arsenal from his own big mouth
then she flashed her eyes back at louie hartmann
they were already brimming with angry tears
you you an american she cried scornfully
oh you big boob you big boob
you you big big she broke off sobbing hysterically to the exclusion of articulation and dashed from the shack
and i knew a lot more about that little girl than dreamed of either when heard her sadly unclassic english or when first looked upon her absurdly pretty face and thought her the most beautiful woman ever seen
of course she was german german enough to be the cousin of this pinkcheeked baron the sister of corporal rudy as i guessed that evening when i heard the baron call rudy vetter too and louie told me that meant cousin german enough to be here with her kin however in the world she had got here lending all the energy and courage she had to them in a forlorn island likely at any moment to be turned into a hell of deadly danger
but she was american too
i could guess that this was not the first time she had given uncle sam the support of her highly colloquial eloquence
no doubt the whole station teased her
a lot of goodnatured and bitterly lonely soldiers or sailors would be sure to tease as pretty a girl as she was
but i imagined they had not teased her about america after the first week of her stay among them whenever that had been
i forgave her her bad english
although i had never counted my own patriotism anything to brag about it struck me that a heart as loyal as hers could be plenty of excuse for overlooking the fact that the tongue tied to it talked the slang and grammar of shops and cheap tenements
the man that won that loyal little heart would be well paid for the labor it might cost him to train the tongue to higher speech would be rich in possessing it even if his labor utterly failed
was i willing to be the man for the labor or the failure even
well i forgot all about our parlous position in figuring that she liked americans better than germans and that of the two real male americans present the other one had shattered his chances with the girl beyond all hope of repair
while i was doing this reflecting the others were talking mostly in german
it appeared that our position was rapidly getting over the worst of its parlousness
at all events the herr lieutenant was leading us out to a shady spot under what was left of a pair of palms for afternoon coffee and cigarettes
as we stepped from the shack the louisa was being towed very carefully into the tiny harbor
the baron stopped for an appraising and approving glance
i say herr baron louie spoke up in a manner that indicated the effectiveness of his normal buoyancy is there any good reason why we shouldnot remain prisoners aboard my yacht
i was on the point of making that suggestion myself mr hartmann the lieutenant responded warmly
we really havenot any spare room for prisoners on shore here
and may i ask if theres anything in the code to forbid me the pleasure of inviting our captor and his company aboard this evening for a little dinner in honor in honor of louie broke off falteringly
des kaisers prompted the captor
oh i say hartmann appealed to him you wouldnot ask that of me yet would you
you know i told you all against you in sentiments about this war
what then honesty had almost put the skids under his painfully builtup safety and nearfriendship with the man who held us prisoners of war
the barons tone had turned stiff and sharp again
well like to make it a dinner in honor of your pretty cousin and by way of a public apology from one american for insulting the navy of the best little american ever that go
baron von face relaxed
he glanced toward the shining smile on the face of his subordinate cousin rudy
i guess we could stand for that he decided
eh rudy
the way the foods been lately i could almost dine in honor of any of the allies except england
it was after the coffee as we were being escorted by rudy back to our own yacht now very securely tied to the side of the long pier at the end of which the raider still yawned for more and more bags of black dirty coal that louie told me the outcome of the confab in the shack
he wonot let us go mourned hartmann
he wouldnot take my oath or my word as a gentleman or my check for half a million as security for our keeping our mouths shut about this black hole
he said the secret was too important to trust with any one here here harry until the islands discovered by the british or the end of the infernal war
well i couldnot help it if my tone lacked the mournfulness of his
it might take time to win the affections of the lovely stormy little adopted american well the man next me at the table was just telling me all this stuff about being at the end of her rope is bosh
he says the central powers can keep up the fight for ten years
louie looked as if he wanted to bite me
i thought you called yourself a pacifist he snapped
i always knew that was just another alias for a damned you sound as if the idea of ten years more war tickled you
well if it should take me that long maybe it did
if ex warden osborne ever wants to get some rudimentary points on the real way to make a prison the sort of place for which an old offender will long with pangs of homesickness the man to give any points the criminals friend may have overlooked
i think that next week had almost got louie resigned to our gloomy prospect
certainly our captors spared no pains to make us feel at home
they dined with us that night and they lunched with us next day and they accepted another invitation to another dinner in the evening
they sang lively songs to console us for our loneliness and grew happy over our being consoled until they sang the mournful songs that showed they were really overjoyed themselves
by the third night it looked as if the festivities were at an end
they had eaten us out of provisions
but on the fourth day they gave us generously of their own meager stock in pay and seemed to love us as well as they had while we were playing the hosts
and that night the raider which had sailed away before dawn of the day after our arrival came in with all hands singing
it seemed that the three previous trips had been lean ones in the matter of securing food supplies
the ships they had caught had been inward bound near the end of their trips and of their provisions
this time fortune was kindlier
two passenger ships had been bagged within an hour of leaving south american ports their buffets perfectly intact
also there had been no difficulty in quickly landing the passengers before they had time to raise appetites after the scare of being captured
the raider was fairly fat with food and the stock of two firstclass and one secondclass bars
the genial captain had not had time to acquaint himself with our existence the day we came but he now sent us over an invitation to dine with the officers of his vessel and the lieutenant in charge of the island station
of course this affair started off a lot stiffer than our previous dinners had inasmuch as the invited included none of the lowranked men of either ship or shore
but it soon warmed up
the captain made us the guests of honor seating us at either side of his own plate
the first toast proposed was a long and painstakingly pronounced eulogy of the president of the united states
i answered it with a paean of praise for the kaiser which was so warm they voted to drink it in schnapps instead of champagne
to the toast america louie managed to reply with one to the german people and was sane enough to refrain from any hints that he thought he could tell them a better way to govern themselves than they had
followed toasts and more toasts
then they grew less formal and got to telling us delicious yarns of their raids yarns that would have made a fortune for a storywriter
they may have been all true or part true or mostly pure fiction but they were all good
then they grew still less formal
somebody got the piano going and they all sang
somebody else started a phonograph and well it was good night then
the partizans of the machinemade music didnot even bother to line up opposite those who held to the piano
each chose his song and did his best with it until it happened to go softer than the other when he would shift to the one he could hear better
and louie and i made our getaway as gracefully as our legs would let us
meanwhile they decided that the louisa cold storage plant was the place to keep the best of the food to be left for the shore guard
the next morning it was crammed beyond possibility of shutting its doors
we were bidden to help ourselves
after the raiders departure our deck became the messroom for the officers of the station
another three days brought the lucky raider home again with another load of provisions
there was another night of high yet decent revel
without raising any idea that all warprisoners were treated alike i was becoming quite convinced that so far as we were concerned enduring prison life was going to be mostly a question to be solved by the capacity of our stomachs to stand up under the strain of some two and a half banquets a day it was that with the joy raised to the th power and the prison part lowered to the irreducible minimum
it was that for just one week and then it wasnot that at all
for that week i think i was the one to catch the wth power and that multiplied by several times what the rest were getting out of it
for i wasnot enjoying just food and drink and good stories and songs and boisterous stag dances
i was enjoying the society of the girl
because corporal rudy could get along pretty well in english because maybe he was the lieutenants cousin and in line for a little favoritism but still more as i figured it out because his presence provided chaperonage to afford his sister a little change from a scene that must be driving her to the verge of dementia to the comforts and the society of the brighter world aboard our yacht corporal rudy was put at the head of the half dozen marines assigned to keep our prison tied to the dock
and he and the girl spent practically the whole of each day aboard with us
and i had the girl to myself
she refused to warm up to the man who had blackened her countrys navy before the officers of the navy of another country
and since rudy and louie seemed to hit it off together beautifully it required little engineering to keep the four of us paired off exactly to my liking and almost to the satisfaction of my hearts desire desire well there wasnot any doubt in my mind about my hearts desire before the second days sun had set i forgave her east side english forgot it
not until the end of the week did i discover the flattering fact that she was using my own style of conversation as a model wherewith to reform her own and had already begun in her more careful moments to improve on several characteristics of the model
she was a wonder that little girl
none i reflected but a wonder in cleverness and versatility could have so thoroughly americanized herself in the brief time english indicated for their american residence
none i was quite sure but a wonder could have got me in the depths of love to which i had fallen in all but no time
i had every conviction that i was no susceptible boy
none but a wonder i was forced to admit by the end of the fourth day could have kept me from a proposal of spontaneous combustion not to say explosion
i knew i wasnot keeping that proposal down
it was just some look in her face or quick twist in her ready wit which always saved me and made me choke back the earnest love talk with a feeling that have to do it or give up the happiness of any talk at all with her
there were moments when it looked to me as if she knew she was the life and animation of this sordid wretched coaldump the only influence that was saving the station from being emptied of men by a series of murders and suicides
then i guessed that she also perceived that she was losing her punch for her job that she must find some diversion or start the train of selfslaughter herself
i recalled that she had snapped up rudy unmercifully over some trifle the first morning they had come aboard
it looked to me as if she recalled similar instances and decided that if she couldnot get on with her own brother any more she wouldnot be able to help the others much longer that it was time for her to get some diversion
at such moments i was dead sure she would have much preferred that i had been a girl but was doing her desperate best for herself and the others with what i was
but i was so completely fatuously in love with her that i was ready to stand for it
i was her slave for life not sure have been able to keep away from her had she entertained the barracks with nightly imitations of my converse of the day
in the darkest of these dark moments of belief that she was making a toy of me i was still ready to declare myself a dividend of happiness in the thought that tomorrow would be another day like today
i donot think ever be so happy again in this world not sure that willingly realize again that i was utterly foolishly made with the sort of insane love that doesnot care how foolishly insane it is
but it was happiness while it lastedit was happiness for a week
and then if you can imagine dr jekyll delivering a nice little lecture to his churchs dorcas society and suddenly breaking off to regale them with one of mr most richly vulgar tales you can form some notion of the way the joy went out of things aboard our yacht and that island
it was noon dinner hour and we were lunching the raiders officers in return for the second feast in which we helped them celebrate the capture of two or more wellprovisioned ships
we were all roaring at a story of the captains when the wireless operator of the island station stepped up to lieutenant von hilberstein saluted and handed over a message
von hilberstein read it with a smile of satisfaction growing broader with each word
it was as if only the presence of his superior prevented him from turning loose a whoop of joy
he handed it to the grayhaired captain
the captain read it read it again as if it were too good to believe
and he did not try to prevent himself from shouting a bullthroated hurrah
the clamor for more definite information was instant
even as i voiced my own eager what is it herr captain
i felt a wave of hope that at last the kaisers definite peaceterms had been published
it is cried the captain and there was instant silence at the resonance of his voice it is that at last our real foe is to be reached
it is that our last and sure weapon is to be wielded
it is that england is to get a taste of that emptiness she has inflicted on our helpless women and children
it is that the soft palavering is over about rules that england has been permitted to change at her own sweet will
it is the answer to our enemies scorn for our benevolent offers of peace
it is the end of the war
it is victory victory at last made certain for the fatherland victory over a whole world full of enemies
come meine jugenden
quick wine schnapps beer anything
we drink to our wilhelm our kaiser hoch
hoch
hoch
at last he has signed the order and published it to the world for the beginning and prosecution to the bitter end of the war of the uboat
the glasses had been filled with whatever drink each could reach handiest were raised even as he spoke the last words were clinking joyously to punctuate the end of his fiery speech
then suddenly the lips that had parted to receive the glasses fell wider open in a gasp of amaze
above the clinking and the rising murmur of satisfaction broke the voice of the girl shrill harsh fierce to the verge of fury vulgar unquestionably in its wrathful loyalty to a land that was not the home of the or theirs
may your kaisers soul bum in hell for it
down on the mahogany deck a dainty glass monographed with the yachts name shattered into a thousand pieces and splashed water over the feet of the officers
they stared at her a moment in blank amaze
many a face and the captains was among them paled with rage at the unexpected insult to the high representative of all their mighty pride
and she answered them stare for stare defiant her lips parted with panted breathing her fair cheeks afire her hair in the sunlight a dash of flame her eyes lambent coals
but no man capable of being the captain of that raider could have remained angry with wrath so pretty as hers
the captain let himself down with a little chuckle
perhaps he remembered an inestimable service she had already rendered to his cause
the others followed his example and laughed as he remarked goodhumoredly enough our little lady doesnot like the uboats
she waited an instant trying to get breath for more of the sort of tirade of which she was a master
then she wheeled and went swiftly to the gangplank to the pier toward the shore
ach vetterchen the baron called over the rail donot go away mad
he must have learned that from rudy
she paused just long enough to bid her higherbred cousin go whither she had just consigned his emperor
but by this time all of them had awakened to the fact that their hosts were more americans
they had looked at us and discerned that our glasses were still full
there was an awkward silence which some of them tried to cover by drinking the toast
the lunch was begun again
our captorguests were even more punctiliously considerate in every word and gesture than they had been before
they plied us very gently with queries as to the attitude of our country
they assured us very earnestly that their rulers had no wish to offend america
they declined to believe that the united states could longer fail to perceive the justice of their cause and their action
but the free and easy goodfellowship was gone
we were glad when the raider again put forth to sea
their politeness had been at such tension it was a relief to give over the effort to match it
our storage plant was still the refrigerator for the station officers mess
even these meals lost their spontaneity
rudy and mamie spent the two following days aboard the yacht as usual
but rudy had gone stolidly silent
he no longer discussed with louie his ambitious plans for the day when he would get back to america
as for mamie it seemed as if her very beauty were fading by the hour
she tried to make conversation tried to listen to mine again and again she tried and failed
at length she frankly gave up
i thought again i understood
her job was done
in the very best conceivable fashion she ha4 been mothering that brood of big lonely generally gloomenshrouded marines
now they were weaned from her and she was weaned froiji them
from the beginning she had strenuously asserted that her love for the fatherland was second to her love for her adopted land
it was at noon of the third day after we had learned of the new campaign when we heard of consequent action in severing relations
the baron sent the word by the messenger who had carried it to him from the wireless station
with it he sent a brief note of command to rudy
there was also a curt note to louie which was sufficient to show us that we were now prisoners indeed of a nation unfriendly
humph
rudy exclaimed at reading his order
so i cannot be your keeper any more
was ist los
i guess this is louie answered turning over the copy of the radiogram
rudy and i read it together
humph
rudy grunted again his rather heavy features taking on a troubled expression
no he added reflectively dejectedly i like that not
it is it is bad
well louie snapped i like this not
one would think that esteemed cousin of yours took it as a personal insult that his government has driven mine to break off relations
again rudy and i read together
mamie had crowded up and we parted our heads to let her see between us
mr louis hartmann yacht louisa sir i regret that business and circumstances will prevent my lunching aboard your vessel today
may i trouble you to permit my men to get from aboard the portion of the victuals which i and my officers would have eaten
at my earliest possible convenience i shall arrange for the transfer of the supplies from your storage plant that there may be no unnecessary occasion for friction between my soldiers and your crew
i trust that you will suffer no inconvenience in remaining strictly aboard your vessel pending further arrangements
in doing so you will assist me in protecting your persons and property from any possible difficulties
awaiting any different instructions from my superiors i shall of course take all possible means to leave you unmolested in your present quarters and to afford you the fullest protection at my command
with best wishes for your comfort and wellbeing i beg to sign myself esteemed sir most respectfully yours henry von hilberstein lieut
it was
rudy who first pronounced upon this document
no doubt he understood better than we the difference between an essentially official communication and the possibilities of personal intercourse
but he still plays that united states power squadron note was criticism
i donot like that neither
before we could quite grasp the significance of his words he turned
well it comes my relief
i must say aufwiedersehn
come mamie
we go by the electric tower again
his friendly blue eyes blinked as he turned to the gangplank
once on the pier he croaked a couple of commands
his six men came stiffly together
six other men headed by an officer in uniform similar to marched out from the always busy shore end of the pier
they paused saluted and were saluted
rudy and his men marched sternly shoreward
the new six took up their places which divided the length of the yacht into tiny beats
neither of us recalled having seen before either the new corporal or any of his little guard
the men who came shortly after with trays on which to carry off the lunch for the officers might as well have saved their scrupulous care to leave a plenty for ourselves
louie and i were in no mood for eating
we were in no humor for talking
we had nothing to talk about
everybody in america had long since taken for granted that the breaking of diplomatic relations would be almost instantly followed by hostilities
neither of us could conceive any idea as to what might be our condition or our fate as prisoners of war
at least the ideas we did conceive were so unpleasant and gloomy we could not hear ourselves utter them
prisoners of war we were
neither of us gave himself the mad pleasure of dreaming of escape
it had been first task to put our electric equipment out of commission
without it we could not get an explosion from one cylinder of the powerful engines one turn of a propeller
our problems were all beyond our power to figure even on solutions
as to whether this renewed mention of the power squadron was to pave the way toward treating us as spies from a nation already making hidden plans for warlike action as to whether such treatment would involve merely a continuation of a slightly closer confinement than we now endured whether it would mean incarceration in dingy coops ashore while the yacht went to join the german fleet whether it would mean just backing up to a wall and facing a dozen rifles we could only guess
and the guessing was nothing nice to be talking about
about three oclock we had more visitors
the lieutenant himself led them aboard the vessel
the stiff formality of his mornings note was now reflected in his rigid bearing
he curtly informed us that his men were come for the supplies
our steward conducted him to the storage box
but supplies were not all he had come for
there had been sufficient evidence of a hasty search of our vessel having taken place while it was being towed from its outside anchorage to the pier in the harbor
but the search which now proceeded under the personal eye of the baron was thorough enough to have satisfied a storybook detective
not a bag or trunk or chest or draver escaped
not a scrap of paper was left unexamined
and not a scrap was left aboard the vessel
even our light vacation literature was removed from the walls of the saloon and borne ashore
all the captains instruments were taken the papers of clearance from porto rico and elsewhere the logs of all the voyages the louisa had made since her launching in the spring
our main ccmpass was removed from the stand on the bridge together with the binnacle lights
our sailing lamps were confiscated
the oars of our tenders were tossed to the pier
even the marlinspikes were taken from our masts and any other deck tools which might possibly become weapons in any sort of free fight
no doubt the baron was acting within his rights
our coming held at least ground for a shadow of suspicion
our escape could hardly mean anything else but the destruction of his post and that was of vast value to his government
but it is hard to see such things calmly while they are being done to you especially when the doer has made himself almost an intimate chum
even though there were occasional indications that our captors stiffness toward us was a pose that hardly softened the acts which accompanied the posing
the barons men were working to remove the entire wireless equipment when we were bidden to go below for a search of persons
when that had been accomplished clear to our skins we were allowed to dress again and return to the deck
a glance about revealed what might have been the deck of a comfortable houseboat on which to loaf away a summer at a cheap resort
it seemed to have been swept clear of almost everything that could suggest a real seagoing vessel
most of the men were gone the ones who had just searched us disappeared up the gangway
the baron himself remained for a last word
i hope well be able to restore all these things to you again some day he said softly in his careful english
we are not really intending to confiscate them permanently
that hardly melted our hearts or took the rebellion from our faces
von lips quivered a little and his eyes blinked as he held out his hand toward louie who happened to be nearer him than i was so sorry he uttered a trifle thickly afraid i havenot even made you understand that this wasnot a pleasant duty
we gave him our hands
somehow we felt better to have him go that way
but a more cheering sight than his somewhat relaxed back was the appearance of his pretty cousin at the end of the gangplank as he was about at the top of it
the baron undertook to bar the way
look here vetterchen you canot go aboard there any more he said sternly
who said so she returned impudently
why i did he tried to reply with dignity
well just stand there a second and show you youre talking from a wrong steer she told him
i not only can go aboard that yacht but going
but vetterchen he argued i canot have my discipline overridden completely like this hate to have to punish you in any way but you bet your grandmas daguerreotype youd hate to make you hate it worsen a fight with a buzzsaw
and look here my sweet cousin heiney
you said yourself a lot o times saved this whole outfit from windin up in a series of dutch acts
any time you want to see that little serial show start just try buttin your discipline into my goins and comins
you get that
he seemed to get it
he let her pass
the pert grin had faded from her face and most of the color as she got to the deck
i had to forego the idea that she was coming especially to console me
she addressed herself to louie
aboard she hurried us across the deck and then made sure none was near enough to listen to what she had to say
look here you she snapped into face me and rudy want to know if theres sand enough in you an harry here to take a long chance
chance
louie repeated slowly
on what
a chance on beatin it out of here tonight
me and him has been doin some figurin up there in the tower
an weve got the dope out that its one in a hundred now mebbe but it wonot be one in a thousand after tonight
that power squadron thing has got heiney and it ll get some of the others harder than him
besides tomorrow theyll be a double guard put on here which wonot help none
so make up them minds of youm without stoppin for bastins
are you game or ainot you
but the engines wonot go
our elec i got all you need for your electricity hid in my clothes right now
an i got some pills that ll put them guards asleep if they can be got to take a drink apiece
an handlin the buttons on the minefield
it ll mean a couple o shots from the battery mebbe but rudy says it ll be a devil of a job to hit you when you get goin at the speed you got a chance a lot o chance of your bein able to get over the anchored mines
but its a heap better chance than youre likely to get again
are you on or ainot you on both of us whispered and added a quaking i guess no guessin about it she warned again
you got to go through it or go to hell i reckon on we decided more firmly
then show me a stateroom where i can get some of the plugs and switches out of my dainty apparel
an get your crew lined up somewhere below sos we wonot lose no time on the instructions stuff
the tides at eleven tonight then or never for youse
as we left her at the top of a companionway that would take her straight to the door of our spare stateroom louie and i looked up into each others face
i am free to admit that the swiftness with which the girl had fairly shoved us into this situation left me breathless dazed
i held out my hand to louie
i croaked weakly he echoed in a gasp
what do you mean
are you going to back out
no of course not going with you right to the end
but there might not be another chance to bid each other goodby you know been a devilish good fellow to me louie
and good lord
if thats the way you feel about it wed better better he broke off
there wasnot anything better no matter how i felt about it
it was war
over nearly half the world millions of men were in some such position as ours at that moment unable to guess their fates unable to alter their fates their only choice between nearly certain immediate but honorable death before and utterly certain but little delayed and dishonorable death behind
i never was so totally panickily pacifist in my life
louie and i had blundered into this infernal situation
that a man should deliberately walk into a recruiting station and sign himself up for just such situations as this was the crowning example of human capacity for doing the idiotic
thank heaven we had little time for further reflection too vivid an imagination to figure up any more manners of death for myself than the one it is set down for me eventually to encounter
louie had gone down the other companionway and i had followed dumbly
we had the six members of our crew ready when mamie came into the narrow quarters with a bundle of small brasses and steels
the engineer seized them
be getting them into place while i talk she commanded
make sure theyre all there
and just remember its hotter than this where youll be if one of them guards outside hears any tinkering
for once an engineer managed to use wrenches and screwdrivers without interfering with the conversation
meanwhile the girl shot her brief instructions
mostly they summed up in one phrase a preparedness that could find and do everything in the dark
it seemed as if the real work was going to be all up to the crew
what louie and i had to do was to get back up on deck sit and chat with the girl long enough to make it appear that our time spent below had not excited us enough to signify anything suspiciously interesting afoot
the crew had to arrange the hold and make every adjustment possible without an actual trial of the motors
this must be done under cover of getting supper
and then it was up to them to get on such terms with the guard that would come on duty at eight oclock that the offer of a few drinks would be acceptable
theirs the hard part
not if you ask me
it was all very well while the girl kept up a perfect phonographic performance of mirthful quip and loud laughter
but when she left about half past four with another hour of daylight left well the next time fixing to take my life and spin it on the end of one finger let the crew come up and look perfectly natural while i go down and sweat around the engine
and then to eat a dinner please spare the tale
at length the crew came up and made its way to the little afterdeck
with them they carried clinking bottles and heavy glasses
the night guard had come on a halfhour before
suddenly i realized that here was the weakness of our plan or the weakest of all its weaknesses
successfully to drug seven men so that they will all drop to sleep at once or nearly enough so to prevent any one of them becoming alarmed at his companions condition i wished the girl would come down to help us do it
i wished it the more as time went on
hope grew when a chorus of voices up at headquarters sent strident chords out into the sticky air
they must be trying to console themselves i thought for losing us
but their singing would have its psychological effect on the seven men who cheerless themselves though with good cheer within arms reach must know their superiors were thoroughly enjoying themselves
our men took it out in loud laughter in requests for schnapps or beer in a tone that could not fail to reach the audience above
but it was an unconscionably long time before we saw one of our guardians step to the edge of the pier to look down on their mirth
tom healey tried to make something of this slender opportunity
hello up there he called goodhumoredly
wollen trinken
it was probably the limit of his german
i had learned enough in the past week to catch the drift of the sour response not with the enemies of my fatherland
oh lord groaned louie in my ear
that settles it put the bug in their ears
once give a dutchman the idea that eating his dinner is disloyal to something he ought to be loyal to and hell starve to death
i reckon i know
my father but great heaven
what are we going to do now after nine got to be moving at tenthirty or miss the top of the tide
we canot jump up there and expect to get away with a silent fight that will knock out as many of them as there are of us
oh what a fool i was not to see this
surely rudy never worked out this part of the deal
that girl must have been reading nickel libraries all her life
dope seven men all at once
well this settles us
it was my turn to try to encourage though i must say i couldnot just locate the cheer stuff to use for the job
if she planned this you can bet your last dollar she will see it through i prophesied in as nearly as possible a tone of belief in what i could not help realizing was not so
and then as if i had brought it about by speaking it the girl was there
my heart almost stopped as i heard her clear voice answering the challenge of the corporal
oh i thought you boys would be lonesome so far away from the fun
anyhow i donot feel up to batting with those bunches tonight
who are you all here anyhow
hello hans hello gus why karl
did they stick you down here with them americans too
i could catch her german words between those she spoke in english
her tone was one to make a man forget any but the most important duties to his fatherland or his own father
what you got to drink she asked when they had all got within easy hearing of her voice
what coffee
nichts besser als das
ach gott in himmel
i want a real drink
hey you americans
hand us up something wet before you all get so gebummelt you donot know your bottles from your glasses
beer
say youve got some swell notions of prison life down there ainot you
give us some wine
give us some of that bitter wine off the italian ship
i liked that
bet none of you ever tasted it
just imagine its wops blood and it ll go down good
hey goin to get that wine or ainot you come down and take it if you say so
charley prince our steward nearly toppled down the companionway to the galley calling back to know if there were clean glasses on deck just as we had instructed should be done in order that the glasses should be the ones we held in readiness
he hurried back with an armload of bottles
tom healey came up with a tray
we handed him seven mugs that tinkled as we tried to hold them
and heres one wineglass for the lady louie mentioned genially as he added it to the trayful of mugs each moist at the bottom with the water it had taken to soften a chloral tablet
charley waited on them with the grace of a broadway headwaiter
then came the suspense
the hochl the girl cried with au apparent fervor to surpass their own enthusiasm for their pet engines of destruction
hoch she urged und trink aus
for some of them had hesitated as they tasted the strange wine with its stranger drug
her final command was all but compelling
those who hesitated were lost
but there was one louie pointed to him and whispered in my ear he hasnot touched his mug
the glass stood full on a pilehead
that fact with all its possible train of fatal dangers had hardly dawned upon my freshfrighted brain when the girl also saw the matter with you otto you like the why donot you drink
maybe you donot like the kaiser yet she flung at him in a voice that seemed almost dangerously accusing
i drink not the wine of my fatherlands enemies grunted the stem throat of the man the one with the bug
louie whispered never do anything with him wasting her breath he finished impatiently as she continued to urge aw come on otto drink anything with me
i didnot think youd turn me down like that
boys fill up again going to drink to an american girl if he wonot drink to america
she filled her own tjny glass
she got up from the heavy timber that formed a low bulkhead over the end of the pier and approached the stolid upholder of the last jot of a principle
she lifted his glass from the spiles cap she held it toward him going to drink to me otto she insisted
here hold it for you
if you donot drink never speak to you again
he backed a little away from her
i could guess how foolish she was making him feel
he was old enough to be her father
she followed him and he backed farther grunting disgusted protests at her of the nuisance she was making of herself
zuriick
zuriick he kept growling but he was the one who was going backward
for an instant i let my eyes wander from the pair
already the strong dose of narcotic was taking its effect
one of the men had tottered
another bending over him and trying to speak gave up and sprawled across him
a third pressed his heavy palms to his forehead and kneeled over
a fourth how long was it going to take otto to perceive this
i swung my gaze
he was still dancing clumsily backward from the girl
suddenly i caught her purpose
louie and the men in the little afterdeck had caught it already and were standing ready to catch him
he reached the edge of the pier
without waiting to see if he would discover his danger or go and plunge off himself the girl raised the heavy mug of vermodth and thrust it wine and all into his very eyes
the waiting crew hardly let his boots clatter against the railing as they seized him
billy nock not always too ready of mind was ready now with a bandanna handkerchief for our guards mouth
quick now get their guns cut the ropes quick
the girls voice was a weak whisper as she held herself together to remind us of the need of haste
louie and i both jumped to the pier with two of the others
the girls trembling fingers snatched two of the guns from the limp hands that held them
but we were at the ropes with carvingknives we had specially whetted for our dinner roast
in split seconds we were getting back aboard
i felt as if i had served through a war already
the hum of the starters gears came muffled from the engineroom
i wanted to lie down and faint after the strain
but i realized we were just at the beginning point
i looked about and discerned that louie was but halfway down the gangplank and that mamie really had fainted
i sprang to his assistance to get her aboard
was she going with us
i gasped have to now louie spoke in a tone bordering on despair
but he left me to get the exhausted girl to a long seat where she could lie down and turned to help the men who were shoving off the gangplank
they left it dangling down the side of the pier
the work of bringing the girl hack to consciousness kept my mind for a moment off the terrible thunder of battle that would wait but seconds until we were discovered
a leap to the low afterdeck procured me a bottle of whisky and i had it to her lips before the engines had backed us off the piers end and we were starting with a reckless jerk full speed ahead
the touch of burning liquor on her lips brought her to
with a frightened glance about her she sat up still panting weakly
rudy wheres rudy she gasped
why mamie you fainted and we couldnot leave you on the pier and oh thats all right going with you
but rudy where are we only about a hundred yards off the pier as yet but its almost another hundred while telling it
and once more i was interrupted
a shot rang out a bullet whined above the rigging
i ducked involuntarily
oh this is all right mamie was saying cheerfully
the fun hasnot started yet
but it had by the time she was finished with the words
it seemed suddenly as if the whole harbor had become a crackling riflepit
the lights of the pier were turned on full as when the raider was being loaded at night
by now however we had got far enough away so that the arcs hardly helped the heavily clouded moonlight to reveal our white hull
hoarse shouts blended with the riflefire
to this was added the heavier boom of a threeinch gun from one of the little concrete pits in the great coalpile
that was answered doubly by a pair of its like on the opposite side of the harbor
for an instant the startling terror of the thing had rendered me incapable of speech
then the terror seemed to have died out
i couldnot believe that all this was being aimed at us
i had been trying to ask the girl to let me help her below deck out of danger
now though the phosphorescent splashes darted up all around us i couldnot see any danger
i felt as if mamie would laugh at me if i suggested it
then the twang of a bullet from the rail within six inches of myjand served to put me into something like proper relation with the situation
i was no longer scared i didnot seem to be afraid save for the girl better take you below i shouted in her ears
the wicked rattle of a machinegun had joined the song of death
they may need me on the bridge she answered
but that she thoroughly understood the nature of our danger she showed by climbing down from the settee instead of standing up
she crawled forward toward the raised section that overlooked the pilothouse this last being in reality the main saloon
we reached there just in time
a bullet flattened against the mast just behind this bridge and still carried strength to knock the captain senseless over his wheel
it happened as we arrived headed wrong anyhow the girl cried to louie rocks over yonder
she snatched the wheel and began to help louie turn it
get him waked up again she bade me need him unless one of you can steer by chart and compass need him louie put in neither chart nor compass left
this will be steering by the stars and there arenot any stars tonight
oh why but i had a compass the girl exclaimed
i its there yet she laughed
not much of one but it steered one boat down here
she turned aside to fish it from her stocking
is that the compass you had
louie asked as she showed him an instrument a few sizes larger than a mans watch give you two thousand dollars for that any day you want to sell
the captain was restored as quickly as the girl had been
i stood wondering what about a compass could make louie and the girl so oblivious to our danger as that he should offer twenty times its worth and she should refuse with death playing tag with us
in righting our course we had run a little close to shore
instantly another machinegun began to spew its stream of lead along us
for it had our range
from fore to aft and back again it swept at a height some two feet above the deck level
we first knew what effect it was taking from the sharp rattle on the steel bulwark louie had put along the sides of the bridge for the naval maneuvers
an instant later there was a series of dull clinks that told of plateglass cabin being punctured by bullets too swift to break them
then the deadly stream was leading forward again toward us
it was fascinatingly horrible an invisible knife that sawed its way toward us
again the dull snapping of glass a duller drubbing through mahogany a straight line of lambent splatter in the water beyond while the drill of bullets found nothing to stop them forward of the cabin in the rear of the spacious deck
then a quick stab of fire as if a whitehot needle had darted through and out of the calf of my left leg brought a startled yell of pain i hardly felt
why the devil didnot you duck snarled louie
and i perceived that the others had flattened themselves against the false pilothouse behind the protection of the short steel bulwark while i had but stood and waited to be shot tell me you can make a soldier over night
it takes training to know what is dangerous
the captain had some of that training having managed to be in almost everything that happened in the spanishamerican war
mamie had it because she had been absorbing it from surroundings wholly military
louie had ducked properly because the captain had pushed him where he belonged not hurt any i answered easily
just nipped the skin on my leg
but five minutes later i was taking surreptitious swallows from the flask to keep myself upstanding until we were beyond this rain of death
and now we were reaching the mouth i had almost said nipple of the harbor
a sharp turn made under the girls direction had put a ridge of coal between us and the interior which evidently had seen us plainly enough to know we were gone since its firing ceased instantly where we catch the big fellows the girl uttered calmly
and dead ahead its straight out now is the grandfather of all the mines
i hardly think theyll waste that on us
but it flashed upon me that they would be more apt to use everything they had on us than on an attacking vessel
for we were going away and they believed we would send back an attacking fleet
yet in spite of that it was the cannon for which i was waiting when the explosion came
the tremendous cloud of flame was totally blinding
the yacht seemed to stop dead as if it had run into a stone mountain
all four of us crashed against the pilothouse
we had bruises that would last us a long while if all or any of us lasted with the bruises
and the noise of the explosion it was like nothing else i had ever heard
for i had heard all the other noises
hearing could not compass this
we felt it
it shook every fiber of our bodies with a shock quite distinct from that of our bump
somehow it seized every nerve and bone and sinew
it seemed as if the whole of lifes energy had been blown out of me and left me standing
i hadnot strength to put the bottle of stimulant again to my lips
and louie the imperturbable i could hear his teeth rattling together as if in a chill
the captain hardly yet completely recovered from the stunning he had got a few moments earlier sat motionless where he had fallen
the girls shaking hand was laid on my shoulder in her effort to rise
it lost its grip and i had to catch her with an effort that called for strength which had left me
it could not have been more than a fraction of a second but it seemed a deadly hour before the engines recovering from the sudden load on the propellers first in spasmodic coughs then in more regular rhythm at length in their normal purr settled down to their heroic test of dependability
is that the engines
louie gasped faintly
then he added they wonot run long
that did for us not so sure argued the captain from a wider range of experience with the sensations of the sea
that was rudy and he missed us a purpose the girl now whispered
give him a little light aft and hell miss us some more if they donot chase him out of there too soon on account of that miss
god hoarsely ejaculated the captain i hope he misses us a little farther next time
another shake up like that the two sixinch guns on the opposite sides of the harbors mouth spoke almost at once
it did seem as if the louisa was getting more than she had ever been built to take
once more the whole craft shivered as a shell exploded directly over her stem
we forgot the scattering bits of steel in our efforts to cling fast to the railings and stanchions
the automatic pumps are starting louis hartmann remarked a moment later
since they would not run until there was water for them to take their running now showed that the terrific shocks had opened seams
we didnot need any ballast for getting over whats ahead
then it seemed as if we all settled into a sort of apathy that no longer cared what became of us
the next attempts of the larger guns to find our range were total failures
somehow their very noise seemed to have weakened
a second mine exploded a couple of hundred feet to the right of our course
i doubt if any of us batted a strained eye
we knew that we were drawing deeper than when we had first approached the island we were making no attempt to dodge those mines we might set off by contact
there was no means by which we could have dodged them
two more of the mines under electric control from shore blew up
i doubt if one of us noted the relative positions of their explosions and our boat
we just waited to see which second would bring death and waited more seconds indifferent whether they brought death or no
well came from the captains lips in a voice that rattled across cords half paralyzed were a good ten miles off shore and out of the way of the mines
the patrol boat you say wonot be back around before twelve better find out what we can as to what shape were in for getting back to key west
and the engineers ought to have a chance to give the machines the onceover before we start any racing again
not a word or sigh of relief from any one that our worst danger was over just a reminder that our work might be momentarily changed to advantage
none of us felt any relief
we were just numb
well put in the girl we got to wait for rudy and them now anyhow
rudy
louie and i gasped together
how do you mean
you donot suppose be here if he wasnot cornin die snorted
coming
how
the motor tender been layinin a little creek on the back of the island ever since you two fell ashore off it
rudy and willie and adolf theyre all coming in it
louie and i looked at each other in surprise
then we quit it
we didnot really care enough whether we took rudy and willie and adolf or not to be surprised about it
louie had made it a point to maintain a crew of united states citizens that there be no possibility of trouble or delay with any of the foreign warvessels so generously sprinkled along our coast
rudy and and the other two were germans
an allies cruiser might make demands upon us for their surrender as war prisoners
we didnot care
the engineers below decided that the engines were still ready to turn up their allotted number of revolutions per minute
one of the clutches was being tightened
the leaks were gaining just a trifle on the automatic pumps
but barring heavy storms we ought to keep afloat as we were straight to new york if we so desired
we didnot
key west would do us
but we didnot care wher we went or how we got there
and then we had to begin caring all over
from somewhere behind the island now quite invisible in the drk and halfmist a long shaft of light stretched itself toward the west lifted described half a circle and dipped to the east came back dropped vanished flashed hither and yonder and finally revealed its source in a white point of tense light now clear of the island
the patrol boat mamie whispered
then a sudden idea flashed into her brain and whirled her query upon louie how fast cn that little tender o youm travel
about twelve miles an hour louie responded
for an instant we had turned on such lights as we needed now she stared at hartmann as if the thing he announced were too monstrous to believe
then she arose and swiftly crossed to where she got an unobstructed view of the performances of the patrols searchlight
she dropped into a deckchair there so weakly that i was not sure she had not fainted
i set my numbed muscles into motion to follow her and give any aid i could
when i could see her face her whole figure seemed to have collapsed into a huddle of misery from which only the dark eyes emitted the slightest ray of life
if youd just turn that light off it shines in my eyes she responded to my offer of help
with the light turned out she drew herself into a yet more shriveled and forlorn heap
she continued to stare fixedly at the ever shifting searchray
huddled as she was she looked cold
i hurried below and returned with a rug which i adjusted over her shoulders
she made no effort to help or hinder me
but nevertheless performing the little act of protection warmed my love to the verge of flame
an hour ago i had indeed revived her from a faint but now i had time to be and to feel tender in what i did
it was a sentiment her tense spirit had given me no previous opportunity to indulge
it was the sentiment every man likes best to indulge toward the woman he loves
i laid my hand over the tiny cold one she rested on the side of her chair while her shoulders and face hunched forward to watch for the beginnings of the next race for life
he has always the chance that he can come straight while the gunboat is dodging the mines i broke the silence once to suggest
there are plenty of straight courses out from the island for that boat she corrected dishearteningly
and the race was more disheartening
the weather had cleared a little enough so that we could discern the white hull of the little tender the instant the searchlight located it
the tender was about four miles off shore then the gunboat quite close in
but one could have figured the race from the start
the patrol had twice the speed of the tender
that the three men in the tender made any run at all could but be accounted for by deliberate intention to be taken dead rather than alive
from the very bottom of my heart i wished that rudy had been satisfied to fight on for his own country
the tender was not much more than halfway to us when the forward twoinch guns of the patrol boat opened fire
that did not deter the men in the tender at all
they kept on with their flight
we could see their silhouettes now outlined in the broken reflections of the big lamp behind them
two crouched low and close to the little engine the third forward crouched over the wheel
i hated to try to imagine what their grim faces must look like
the biggest of the guns spoke again
a splinter shot upward from the stem of the tender and the three crouched lower
at the third round a plank was shivered for half its length
but now the race was too nearly over for further flight
the desperate men in the tender without diminishing speed faced behind them and guns to shoulders began to pump bullets at the glaring lamp
it was a clever stroke
the light vanished at the first feeble volley from the three guns
though the white of the boat might be near enough for a target the men themselves could no longer be seen by the pursuer
of boats or men we could see nothing at all
all the while our course had been almost athwart that of the oncoming craft
now we had crossed their line and the captains telegraph had buzzed the signal below for threequarters speed ahead
for we must not get in range of the patrols twoinchers
of all three boats we must be the most visible for we must make it possible for rudy and his two companions to see us so long as there was a chance of their reaching us
a few moments more of waiting ensued
then the guns of the patrol vessel spoke sharply
the flashes seemed turned a trifle to orte side
in this last darkness the girl had got up and gone silently to the rail
we glimpsed a pale light apparently showing through the open door of the deckhouse and indicating that the patrolboat had turned sharp in her course
while i was trying again to focus my eyes on the spot the end came
it was one more flare of horrible flame one more detonation that tortured the ears
and in that flare both boats were plainly visible their bows almost together and raised high into the air their frames and sides seeming to collapse in shapeless masses
there were great ugly howls of men in pain unspeakable then silence
i steadied the girl back into the seat once more wrapped her in the big rug then sat beside her
i laid my hand comfortingly upon the cold little one on her chairs arm
but this time she seemed conscious of the gesture and drew her hand away and for a while sat staring at it uneasily
the captain touched my shoulder
mr hartmann wants to speak to you he announced almost gruffly
he took my chair as i headed for the bridge
well what is it
i asked dully just this harry
i want you to let that poor girl alone not to bother her with any more of your damned nice attentions to keep out of her way at all events while shes aboard my yacht
i was almost too astonished for words
when they came my astonishment had turned mostly to anger
i donot know what you mean i snapped not aware of annoying any one with unwanted attentions
i could imagine something of what a blow that out there was to her
i wanted to do anything i could for her
and what in the devil do you think you can do for grief like hers came back from my old chums lips got a wonderful respect for your imagination it seems to me
i suppose you imagine you love her none of your business if say he cut me off havenot you really ever heard of the way she came to be down here in the first place
why why no
i donot think she has told me i confessed
well tell you
rudy and those other two there were six of them at the start got wind of the existence of this coaling station somewhere down here
all of them were reserve men of course
they hadnot much money but they had a whole lot of patriotism that wasnot getting the slightest exercise up in the united states
so they concocted the fool scheme to sail down the keys from florida in a rickety old catboat with a kicker in it
that wouldnot have been any worse than lots of other things only mamie wouldnot let rudy come unless hed bring her along and he was still loony enough about the thing to bring her in order to get here himself
and even that might not have been so bad in fact weve been seeing it work out very nicely in the end
but something went wrong with the engine of the catboat just when there was a tenday calm for which theyd been too low in funds to provide against with decent rations for the two days theyd figured for the run they were making
and well not going to go into details right now i havenot time
they got ashore finally
it was rudy that managed to sail the boat into some sort of port
and two of the men were dead three more and the girl were in a delirium of starvation
and the folks that got them out of their boat made a queer discovery
the girl still had plenty of food
she had it tucked in a little bag she carried on her lap
it was her food too her portion of the rations they doled themselves out when the bunch began to realize its plight
and somehow by one lie one time and another lie another time she had kept rudy eating something enough to hold soul and body and brain together right along
and he hadnot known that shed gone without herself to accomplish it
do you think youve got anything to console that sort of a love with you think theres a time somewhere when your cheap flirtations are a bit out of place
flirtations
i echoed indignantly
after all he had but added a capsheaf to my own estimate of the girl
maybe something of an ass but meant to marry that girl if anything could ever induce her to take me
marry her jaw dropped
he stared at me in blank noncomprehension
well maybe you could now
but before now
why what do you mean
well i donot know as let you stop me pretty sure i wouldnot want to let our baron lieutenant chap back there take her away from me
and i donot see why her brother should seriously object to me if she didnot
brother
who
louie insisted crazily
my god
you didnot think rudy was her brother did you
and before my bewildered brain could even then grasp the truth it was borne in upon me in the tone of a womans voice
it was a voice dead and hollow with long vigil and strain and anxiety hoarse and weak and thin
the girl was at the rail again as she cried ut her fingers pointing toward something none of us could as yet see or hear
rudy
rudy
it was a voice to call a man back from the dead
and the cheerfullooking rather overenthusiastic and distinctly sensationloving young man who was swimming toward the lights of our boat was her husband
well he spoke simply as we got him aboard i guess now i got to fight for my new country bif joseph
ivers lawrence returns to his home in new york after seven years devoted to his education in england
the period is and he is strongly tory in his sympathies so that when dale kirby declines to drink a toast to king george there is trouble at once and a duel
but david discharges his pistol into the ground and thereby placates the friends of his cousin godfrey with whom and the latters wife caroline he has taken up his residence
but on the arrival of a courier with news of the outburst of the liberty men at lexington there is such excitement in the new york colony that david decides to betake himself to the home of nathaniel winnington a wellknown tory whose daughter jessica he has recently met and for whose safety he is troubled
things quiet down after a bit and he returns to the wall street house which however in the course of the next year reverts to his cousin godfrey when david declines to subscribe to the patriots pledge put up to him by general lee
he is proscribed and goes out into the suburbs to live with the murrays at incleberg whither after a skirmish his patriot friend adrian ingold betakes himself for refuge
david insists on seeing the wounded man back to the continental lines and in doing so gets a safeconduct pass from the british commander sir henry clinton
this however works to his undoing when next day he is captured by the americans
a adrian suggestion the scouting party conducted david to the american headquarters on harlem heights
the two horses of the fallen british troopers were caught and ingold mounted one and rode away down the valley to look for his own command
the other horse was given to the prisoner and as the battle on the heights was growing in violence and spreading toward the valley the party headed for the opposite heights at a good pace
on top of the rocky elevation north of the valley known as point of rocks david saw a group of mounted officers one of them being particularly conspicuous by his superior height and by the milky whiteness of his charger
general washington i believe said david casually to the captain who rode at his side
ask me no questions sir was the answer an not have to offend you with ungracious replies
david nodded understandingly and kept silent for the rest of the ride
but he viewed with interest the hastily thrown this story began in the march argosy argosy up fortification on the successive elevations of the heights and when his captors halted on a knoll to observe the valley they had quitted he was permitted to look for himself smoke clouds now obscured the hollow way to a large extent but bodies of troops were moving rapidly in huge patches of kaleidoscopic color and it took but a moment to determine that the rebels were once again in retreat
the heavy firing ceased little by little and the smoke cleared and presently a fanfare of british bugles rang out from the middle of the valley in a notably tuneful call that theyre sounding captain asked one of the virginians
why damn their insolence muttered the captain dejectedly its no military call its the call at the close of the hunt
they think theyve bagged their foxes but well show em yet
he scowled angrily as he saw a suspicion of a smile on face and at his surly command the party turned about and continued the ride at a swinging trot
as the captive had vaguely surmised their destination was the morris mansion which was now the center of the rebel camp with the beautiful lawns cluttered with light ordnance supply wagons and nondescript camp paraphernalia
they trotted into the yard passed around the house to the large barns and dismounted
a guard officer came from the barns and received the virginia captains report
he was informed of the circumstances of the capture and he read the pass that was evidently so incriminating and ordered a soldier to conduct the prisoner to an improvised cell in the large barn
the cell was a room some ten feet square which had evidently been used as a small granary
there was a keg in one comer for the prisoner to sit on and before he had been there many minutes a soldier came in and placed a jug of water on the floor
then david was left to his peculiar reflections for several hours
they were not pleasant nor yet notably melancholy for he could hardly take the situation as gravely serious
if he had to spend a long time in such a prison he would sorely miss his luxurious quarters at incleberg but he felt that his incarceration could not extend over many days
the true and softhearted adrian would get him out by hook or crook before he was subjected to any positive hardship and the chances seemed strong that his friend would not permit him to pass a single night in such a place
he heard many sounds of excursions and alarms outside the barn
bodies of horse and foot passed along the road and after one burst of shouting and trumpet calls he made out that horses were hastily attached to the light artillery pieces in the yard and driven away at a great pace
about noon as he figured the time a continuous and aweinspiring din was borne across the hills
the rattle of musketry became a steady tattoo and was punctuated by jarring salvos of artillery fire
he listened with eager interest but as the apparently considerable engagement continued without abatement he became vaguely anxious
it seemed highly probable that the rebels would be annihilated or put to rout and he scarcely relished the idea of being rescued by men of his own political sympathies at a time when he might find explanations difficult
if the cavalry patrol that had pursued him returned to headquarters and described him accurately he might fare worse among his friends than with the enemy
for an hour or more the battle thunder rolled without intermission then it fluctuated growing fainter in the distance or louder with probable shifting of positions
at last it subsided gradually and ceased
he heard men cheering near the barn and galloping horsemen shrieked out tidings of victory as they approached
it was incredible the listener thought yet it seemed to be true
then came another fanfare of trumpets somewhere on the heights and fresh bursts of cheering
the rebels were replying in kind to the british taunts of the morning the buglers were sounding the victorious call of the fox chase
after an hour of bustle and hilarious confusion about the place he heard horses entering the yard and the name of washington was roared out by a hundred hoarse voices
david sat down on his keg and shook his head in puzzled bewilderment
it was too preposterous for belief but of a certainty there had been a great battle and it seemed that general washington had won the day
a soldier came into the cell as darkness fell and put down a piece of bread and a jug of fresh water
i have heard sounds of great rejoicing david said to him quietly
did your troops succeed very brilliantly today
the soldier grinned but leered at the prisoner with a contemptuous air
the kings men will not stop running this fortnight thinking he said
certain it is they wonot come this way soon again
david was eager for more detailed information but the man turned about abruptly and left him alone again
the bread was dry but david was hungry and he ate it all washed down with hearty drafts of the cool water
it grew dark and he had no light
he was cramped from sitting so long on the keg and when it seemed that he was to have no bed fir blanket he took off his fullskirted coat spread it on the dusty floor and stretched himself wearily upon it
a little later came a more considerate visitor
it was the captain who had taken him prisoner and he brought a small candlelantern a coarse blanket and a porringer of stewed beans
here mr treves he said not unkindly commander of the guard for the night and no wish that my prisoners should suffer
you can be a bit thankful to his excellency too for hes in high good humor ever the victory and hes given orders that all prisoners shall be treated kindly even spies
i shall try to prove to your satisfaction that far from being the latter captain returned the prisoner
the officer smiled but shook his head
i wish you luck sir he said but not be in your shoes for anything i can think on appear before the court martial tomorrow i believe and the the execution of the sentence is usually carried out the same day
come youre rather gloomy for a night visitor
david exclaimed half facetiously
i should dislike to think that tomorrow would end for me before sunset
i canot think that such a desperate enemy to your cause
the one little paper that i found on you convicts you sir said the officer soberly
i donot see what could save you short of a blessed miracle
to his surprise david almost smiled
he was thinking of the faithful adrian as a blessed miracle and his mind was not disturbed by misgivings or by the gloomy predictions of his jailer
come come captain said david donot let my plight cast a gloom over you an optimist by nature and i shall not give up hope until i feel the noose
as a loyal subject of king george i really should be most dejected over the ill fortune to his arms today
believe me i canot comprehend it
i thought that sir william had struck at last with an army that could do no less than overwhelm you
the captains eyes sparkled in the lanternlight
it ll take more than mere numbers to overwhelm us mr treves he said
they crowed too early in the day and they paid dearly for it
the heights around bloomingdale are littered with redcoats tonight poor fellows thatll never fight again
we fought em for two hours running hand to hand sir in a buckwheat field just above the hudson river bank and then we chased em back in the city tonight and they wonot come out again tomorrow nor the nex day
it wasnot a cheap victory for us though he continued more soberly
we lost some fine fellows although our losses were mere nothing compared to theirs
some of our officers say that we might not have won the fight had it not been for the rare work of colonel knowlton of the connecticut rangers and poor fellow he fell in the second assault
major leitch of our virginia fellows went to reinforce him and he fell at the same time
but their men went on fighting and god be thanked we got the victory a terrible business declared david solemnly
ah you may well say so returned the captain
blood and murder in a land that ought to be blooming in peace and plenty and all for that pigheaded dolt that wears the british crown
do you mind that officer that we saved from the redcoat cavalrymen this morning just before we captured you sir
very well indeed answered david coolly
he was from my own colony of virginia major ingold as true a man as ever i knew went on the officer and he fell sir in that accursed buckwheat field leading his men against the british bayonets
there was an instant of tense silence
the candle in the lantern guttered and almost flickered out
the officer heard something like a stifled sob
is anything the matter with you mr treves inquired the captain squinting curiously through the half light
there was no answer and the officer leaned closer to his prisoner
egad he exclaimed quite unnerved you sir
but i vow your emotion does you credit
i suppose these things sound more terrible to a civilian gentleman than they do to us that are in the beastly business
death is around us all the time and it comes quick to us
well sir leave you
i wish our acquaintance might have been pleasanter i can see that youre a man with a heart
david heard the door close and the key click in the lock and then he clasped his hands convulsively to his head and threw himself upon the blanket at full length
my poor poor adrian he groaned in an agony of grief
poor lad that you had to be one of the first to go
and then suddenly he caught his breath in a gasp and sat up
with more of amazement than horror he realized his own predicament
he was in a fair way to be sentenced to death on the morrow and there was not one man who could prove that he entered the rebel lines to serve a rebel officer noon next day david treves stood in the big courtmartial room of general headquarters it had been mrs famous drawingroom and heard the president of the court declare that he stood convicted as a british spy
your deportment before this board has been that of a gallant gentleman sir the officer observed and my profound sympathy goes out to you
it is not our wish to appear vindictive or brutally severe and as you may have friends with whom you would communicate i would not deprive you of sufficient time to do so
it is the sentence of this court sir that three days hence at sunrise you shall be hanged by the neck until you are dead
the pallor of death was on face but he uttered no sound his shoulders remained square to the front and his head retained its courageous poise
if the prisoner has anything to say spoke up one of the officers of the board let him speak now chest heaved as he took a deep breath and he moistened his lips
with your indulgence gentlemen he began slowly in a low voice i would ask a a very great favor a favor that may well be too great for you to grant
my only hope lies in certain things that i might say to one man and that man is general washington
if you hope to win clemency sir by giving up certain information with regard to the enemy said one of the officers gravely such a proposal should be made to this court not to general washington
you misjudge me sir
david replied in a firmer tone
i am not one to barter honor for life in such a manner
it was my pleasure to meet his excellency on a certain occasion and what i would say to him now is a private matter between one gentleman and another
i could say it only to general washington
the president of the court shook his head almost sorrowfully
such requests are not uncommon mr treves he said and i fear that it would be difficult for you to gain the desired audience with the commanderinchief
however i shall include your request in my report and if possible i will see that it comes to the notice of his excellency
he nodded to the officer at the door as he finished speaking and the prisoner was led quickly from the room and conducted to his cell in the barn where he sat down on his blanket and remained for a long time in a state of dumb stupefaction
hours passed and he thought with constantly increasing agony of jessica and of the few good friends who would sincerely mourn his untimely and undeserved death
and his grief for the death of his friend did not cease
he and adrian ingold had known each other but a few months more than a year yet their friendship had been of rare quality surviving even those vital differences of thought and action which commonly serve to break the most fraternal bonds
in his extremity of anguish and emotion he permitted himself even to wonder if ideals had been more just and true than his
for himself he was loyal to the crown because his fathers had been sc before him but ancestry had been no less loyal he had lived in rare old england aqd been educated in british ideas and spirit but so had adrian
he believed the colonies to be indubitably the possessions and dependencies of britain as essentially british as the british isles but adrian had been an older man and a wiser man and adrian had seen the future of america all bright and glorious in the liberty and independence of a selfgoverned nation
the slender ray of sunlight that penetrated the tiny hole that served as a window near the top of the cell now lay horizontally in the dustladen air and the sufferer thought dully that the afternoon was waning
then as the beam of light grew more golden a soldier came and unlocked the door
come out prisoner he commanded orders to take you before his excellency general washington
make haste
david sprang up with a cry of hope and relief
never fear my friend he said haste is too slow a word for me at such a moment
he was unshaven his hair lacked powder and his good black coat was creased and dusty but he entered the morris mansion again with the spring and vigor of new hope in his step and carriage
the house was full of officers and despatch bearers were darting in and out but general washington was found sitting alone in the large room on the left of the entrance
you will wait outside the door which you may close said the commanderinchief to the soldier as they entered and then he bowed gravely to david without rising and waved him courteously to a chair
i regret that our second meeting is so inauspicious mr treves said the rebel leader quietly and with a deep note of sincerity in his voice
i readily recalled you from your name you were a friend of the gallant major ingold whose death added so greatly to our loss in yesterdays engagement with the enemy
david bowed sorrowfully scarcely trusting himself to speak
you will understand sir said washington that almost every man convicted of espionage is inclined to regard his case as exceptional and that he almost invariably craves the privilege of laying his plea before the highest authority
if i were to yield to every petition of the sort my time would suffer an appreciable curtailment
i may say however that in deference to the memory of major ingold i have made this exception in your case
you will oblige me by being as brief as possible mr treves
if the interview avails me nothing your excellency said david fervently i shall leave your presence happier for this mark of your consideration
i will be very brief sir
i could not tell my story to other men without the danger of compromising certain innocent persons but i feel that it is safe in your hands
he then told hurriedly in terse sentences how adrian ingold had been sheltered by those distinguished tories the murrays how he had been prepared for his perilous journey to the rebel lines and how finally he himself had gone forth with him to afford support and guidance
without pause and with a convincing earnestness he told the story to the end then fell grimly silent
general washington eyed him with earnest intensity throughout the recital
at the end he bowed his head and was thoughtful for some minutes
the most important phases of your experience mr treves he said suddenly but kindly are those which followed your departure from the house of mr murray
major ingold unhappily is no longer with us
general sir henry clinton might an he would bear testimony to the incident of the pass which seems to have been somewhat irregular
but could any one vouch for your movements from the time you left the british outpost to the moment of your arrest
david shook his head
major ingold and i were alone sir until the final pursuit and skirmish he said
washington sighed audibly
the most unpleasant thing we have to experience in the exercise of high authority mr treves he said is the official hardening of the heart
our own impulses our own best inclinations have to be thrust aside with a ruthless hand
david bowed silently and got up
i beg your excellency to believe he said that i am not lacking in gratitude for the attention and consideration that you have shown me
mr treves said washington with deep feeling as between man and man i believe every word that you have spoken
as general washington i can believe nothing until i have seen the conclusive proof
i hope however that i may lighten your heart a little before you return to your place of confinement
i shall give orders sir postponing the execution of the courts sentence to one week from this day and i shall privately make some investigation of your case if i find that such an investigation is possible
david stepped to the door and bowed again solemnly
your excellency knows me to be a kings man he said huskily but i would like to say sir that if it comes to pass that i must give up my life i shall die with no feeling of bitterness toward the commander of the army for which my good friend gave his life
i am grateful to you for that assurance sir returned washington a little hoarsely
it is my prayer mr treves that the lord of mercies will deal gently with you
david opened the door and passed out quietly but with a heart full of high emotion
the soldierguardian grasped his arm and led him rapidly back to the barn and into his cell
the sunlight had now quite departed and dusk was gathering but the place was in some was less gruesome less grim in its squalor than it had been before came three days after the sitting of the court martial without further incident beyond the dull routine of the improvised prison
late in the morning david heard a coach rumble into the yard and an hour later the guard opened the door of the cell and jessica winnington and her father came in
david uttered a great cry and clasped the girl in his arms and she sobbed convulsively with her head on his breast while nathaniel winnington choked and strove manfully to find his voice
verily david said the old man huskily at last we never thought to see our land under such a reign of terror
david shook his head vaguely but could not speak
he caressed the soft golden hair of his betrothed and held her close to him
oh david she cried at last
we must save you my dear
we shall save you
this this general washington as he calls himself sent a message to us through the lines by the gracious courtesy of sir henry clinton and we were permitted to come here to plead for you
david
i have been on my knees to the man
i have told him in this last hour how noble you are how brave and honorable yet he knows not even now if he may release you
the monster
he was kindly and courteous observed the temperate mr winnington
though he condemns me himself said david i shall still believe him a gallant gentleman
would you both drive me mad wailed jessica
the mans not gallant
if he were hed not doubt a ladys word and youd now be in the coach with us going home again david
poor adrian exclaimed david abruptly
you have heard ah yes she cried breaking forth in sobs again but one wo upon another
it is the way of war remarked the old man
i mourn our poor friend and i deplore his unfortunate misguided course
david we may remain with you but an hour sobbed the girl
will you pass the time in talking of mens politics
we shall not be permitted to see you again but tonight we go to sir william headquarters in the city
he shall save you
he shall tell this general washington what it means to to torture one of the kings loyal subjects
this is not the spanish inquisition
my dearest exclaimed david i beg of you do not go to sir william howe
it seems that hes not in a position at present to dictate to his enemy and youll surely compromise yourselves and our good friends the murrays
think
if it were known that you so much as sheltered a rebel officer thereby aiding him to escape through the lines your estates might be confiscated you might even be thrown into prison
mr winnington you have too much discretion to permit such folly
father will do as i say declared jessica firmly
shall a lady sacrifice her future husband merely to save confusion to save a paltry house and garden it in my hands my lad said winnington
poor jessica is quite beside herself and no wonder
i believe that mr murray will accompany me to call upon sir william and we shall speak to him discreetly
we may say that you strolled through the lines in the indulgence of a whim
sir william is a genial gentleman and sure he will make representations to this mr washington and possibly arrange to exchange you for some rebel prisoner now held within our lines
they talked on until the end of the hour and the sentinel at the door then asked the visitors to withdraw
but he was forced to repeat the request three times
jessica screamed in awful anguish at the first summons and at the last she swooned in her lovers arms and was borne from the cell by her father and the soldier
thus david was left to an afternoon and night of black gloom and poignant grief
his hopes of the last three days were shattered
washington had sent for the only available witnesses and it was evident that their testimony had not greatly affected his judgment
on sunday afternoon there came to the cell a dashing young aidedecamp very smart in the elaborate uniform of a staff officer
david was reclining upon his blanket and the visitor sat down on the keg
i am captain alexander hamilton mr treves he announced in a kindly tone and i am come to offer you the sincere compliments of his excellency general washington and his deepest sympathy and regret
i understand sir responded david quietly but the words came forth with a great sigh
will you do me the honor captain hamilton to tender my compliments to his excellency and say to him that i do not cease to thank him for his gracious kindliness to me
i am hardly resigned to my fate but i accept it as one of the unfortufiate incidents of war
hamilton leaned forward and placed a hand gently on the prisoners shoulder
faith sir he exclaimed i was told that you were a right good fellow and i believe it now
but come mr treves he added almost jocularly youre not far from my own age and we youngsters donot give up so readily my unpleasant duty to well almost to give you a deathwarrant as it were but worse men than you sir have escaped from under the very noose
war has made you and me enemies and i promise you be the first to shoot if i saw you attempting to flee but oh well prisoners have escaped from the most vigilant of captors
see sir youll have me quite maudlin in my talk if you keep that long face
i canot keep it for long in such genial company sir declared david forcing a sorry smile
pray donot think that make light of your trouble hamilton added hastily
i have brought you at his excellencys request a bible and sundry writing materials
if you require other articles for your comfort or convenience they will be furnished and on leaving i shall order for you a table and chair as well as a comfortable cot
i believe his excellency does not know that your prison is so ill furnished
the sprightly aidedecamp already known as one of favorites prolonged his visit to an hour and david found himself chatting almost lightly with him at the end
the call had blighted his last lingering hopes but the virile spirit of the visitor strengthened him in fortitude and prepared him in a way for the imminent ordeal
monday the last day was warm and sultry for late september and the heat in the cell was stifling as the prisoner spread his writing materials on the small table and prepared for his final melancholy duties
a sentinel was now stationed directly outside the door the deathwatch and david could hear him panting and cursing the oppressive weather
when the guard was relieved at ten oclock the new sentinel opened the door
look ye prisoner he called out orders to open the door and give ye air to breathe but yere not to come near it an here to see that ye donot
ecod have it no hotter nor this me lad wherever ye find yerself tomorrow
david winced at the brutal jest but held his peace and sat himself down to his task
for jessica he filled a score of pages with love and heartrending messages of farewell
he bade her seek happiness in the world as soon as the first shock of parting was over and cherish him only as a tender memory of early life
death he declared was nothing to him but the killing pain of parting from his love
he wrote affectionate messages to the murrays and to mr and mrs winnington and a rather ceremonious cousinly note to godfrey and caroline treves
the letters were finished in the afternoon and he sealed them with wax and left them on the table
the officer of the guard offered him the attendance of a clergyman but he asked to be left alone to his own preparations until an hour before the dawn
it was very quiet now around the barns and the headquarters
the rebel army had been spread out over the country to the north to fortify the banks of the hudson and prepare for possible winter quarters at the upper end of the island
mounted orderlies arrived and departed at intervals but there was no more passing of wagon trains or marching of troops
as the sun went down gradually fading from the tiny window david covered his eyes with his hands that he might not see the last ray disappear
when darkness came he shook off his spell of gloom lighted his candle and fell to reading in the bible
he was counting the galloping hours now and his most stunning shock came with midnight the beginning of his last day
he heard the sentinels along the scattered posts cry the hour in turn each one adding the familiar well and he bowed his head on the table and groaned
it was the way of the world he was to die at sunrise to leave life and love and the happiness of living yet the rest of the world was crying well
directly afterward the guard was changed for the next three hours and the broad back of a new sentinel blocked the still open door
another hour sped on flying feet and just after one oclock a tall fiercemustached sergeant of the guard with clanking saber and bayoneted musket came through the barn and spoke to the sentinel gruffly not men enough here to furnish ordlies he grumbled half the guards on outpost duty tonight
look you to run with this despatch to headquarters and be sharp about it
it ll take you an hour an its my job to take your place here till youre back
the sentinel seemed glad of the chance to go into the open air
he took the despatch and was off directly at a dogtrot and the tall sergeant blocked the doorway in his place
david feared that he would assume by superior authority a solicitous and talkative attitude but he cast no more than a sympathetic glance within and within five minutes he yawned and leaned his great bulk against the doorframe while he fanned himself with his cocked hat
the prisoner applied himself devotedly to the bible and read steadily with no thought of sleep until a strange noise brought him up with a start
the noise was repeated and it was a sterterous hearty snore
david leaned forward vaguely agitated and peered over the flickering candle to the door
the sergeant was propped like a dummy against the side of the opening his head was supported by the muzzle of his musket and his breast and he was snoozing like a man utterly free from care and responsibility
instantly like a flash of inspiration came back the words of the debonair captain hamilton worse men than you sir have escaped from under the very noose from the most vigilant of captors
and here was of all things the least vigilant of captors
david stood for a moment poised on his toes breathing hard with excitement
but the opportunity was too rare too to be trifled with and he waited not another second
a bullet from one of the sentinels outside might end him but it would be a happy end compared to that which was impending
he caught up his blanket and wrapped it like a cloak about him to cover his telltale skirted coat and his kneebuckles then he crept forward never breathing and slipped with infinite caution through the narrow space between the sergeants big body and the opposite side of the doorframe
the sergeant snored like a peacefully slumbering ogre
poor fellow thought david
this work may cost him tiis life but its war
war
he stood free in the broad passageway and saw the blackness of the still autumn night beyond the great barn dopr
three noiseless strides and he was in the open air
he almost cried out in his wild joy
a lantern burned on the porch of the mansion but it was the only liglit to be seen
southward was the only way that offered sure liberty and he went boldly forward toward the main gate but reconnoitered as he approached it
the light on the porch threw feeble rays just beyond the gate and they showed him a slim rather statuesque sentinel leaning against a tree at the roadside swinging his musket idly in his left hand
the man was faced straight away from the gate and for a full minute he did not once turn his head
it was another chance thrust upon the fugitive by a beneficent and smiling fate
on quivering toes he went forward
he glided around the gatepost at the left within six feet of the statuesque watchman slipped swiftly into the shadow beyond and then darted clown a grassy declivity ran cautiously more freely leaped out with a glad bound and flew down the slope toward the harlem river and the neutral valley
a voice on the heights brought him to a breathless halt
he listened for a cry of alarm but a distant sentinel called out two o the clock
a clear morning and alls well
oh god in heaven i thank thee cried david stretching his arms to the pale stars well well the afternoon of
monday the 23d of september david emerged from the small farmhouse of a dutch settler on the eastern bank of the harlem changed in appearance as though by the spells of a magician of the orient
his weeks growth of beard was shaved lightly in patches to give it a ragged uncouth appearance his eyebrows were trimmed to a new angle and his dark hair free from powder was allowed to straggle over his ears and forehead
he was dressed in a rough suit of butternut homespun with coarse woolen hose and clumsy woodensoled shoes
on his head flapped a soft wide peasants hat and the heavy pack of a pedler rounded his shoulders till he looked shorter in stature by three inches
he had pulled across the river in a skiff just before dawn and with the money left in his pockets by his recent captors had won the heart of the dutch farmer and purchased the clothes and pedlers outfit
the farmer in winter was wont to take to the road to sell small wares and had the pack ready filled
as a final service the dutchman rowed him back to the west bank of the river and david swore him to secrecy for the tenth time and went plodding down the river road toward the city
near nightfall he halted at a small roadside tavern frequented by farmers and boatmen unslung his pack and sat down in the general room to a supper of porridge and hard bread
what news from the city brother he said to a countryman on the opposite side of the table
why the fires out they tell me was the astonishing answer but tis told theres woful little o the town left standing
news indeed spluttered david affecting a looseness of speech from westchester an heard of no fire
save us exclaimed the rustic
then ye donot know that the city took fire on saturday an burnt trinity meetinghouse and a thousand houses roundabout
david concealed his dismay with difficulty the first to give me such news brother he replied
well well i might fare ill there with my pack then
haply do better to pay a visit to the rebel camp
do ye know aught of matters thereabouts
me an my lad drove a wagon of cabbage there but this morning answered the rustic but we been ill paid
the orfcers were in bad humor for some great prisoner had beat the hangman by fleeing away in the night an twas a sore matter with em
now now exclaimed the listener
how came that about think ye
why twas a right strange mystery was the willing answer
they do say theres somewhat much amiss in the camp
a sergeant tall as a sentrybox sent the prisoners guard running off with a message an took the watch imself
the guard came back betimes but the prisoner was flown an so likewise was the tall sergeant
then sir twas learnt that no such tall sergeant of the guards description was known to the army an the message that was carried by the guard proved no message at all
twas a sorry hoax an the orfcers are biting their nails an cursing the underlings for knaves an fools
david laughed boisterously at the recital but finished his meal presently and took to the road again
as he trudged along the dark and dusty way his brain was in a whirl
some one had saved his life
who was the tall sergeant and by whom was he sent
and again who was the slender statuesque sentinel at the gate who kept his head averted while the fugitive made good his escape
he pictured again that slim watchman who must have heard the rustle of his footsteps unless he were deaf and must have seen the darting shadow but for a sudden blindness
and as he puzzled another picture shaped itself in his mind
he gasped at a sudden thought
could two men be formed as nearly alike as that slim sentinel and captain alexander hamilton
all at once he stopped short and clapped his hand to his forehead
great jove he cried aloud
could such a thing be
the sergeant was as tall as as i am as his red face real
did that mustache grow naturally from the lip
and was he asleep
by the high gods he cried in fresh amazement that tall sergeant was no other living man than his teeth came together with a snap
he was the man who saved my poor life he finished humbly and my true friend forever
for another minute he stood still in the dark road then he strode on with a heart throbbing with gladness and deep emotion
the dusty miles rolled away beneath his feet he came to the boston road and swung into it with joy and before he realized the distance he had covered the great house of incleberg loomed before him
it was late but that house was his destination
he stepped upon the porch and tapped softly at the door
a man servant opened it fearfully peered out then ordered him savagely away
a happy inspiration suggested to david the old nickname that mrs murray had applied to him
go tell your mistress mrs murray he said that a pedler named petruchio would have speech with her
the servant closed the door and david wondered if it would open again
a minute passed and then the welcome face of the lady df the mansion looked out upon him
petruchio she exclaimed wonderingly as she gazed at the uncouth figure of the pedler
petruchio that is the tamed one this time dear lady whispered david and mrs murray uttered a cry that rang through all the house and caught him in a wild embrace
david treves is alive she screamed
alive
alive and here
there was a rush from the inner rooms and robert murray and mr winnington dragged the pedler into the drawingroom with frantic joy
jessica exclaimed the masquerader inquiringly
ill unto death with a breaking heart sobbed mrs murray but the healing will be speedy david
then jessica was aroused from the deathlike trance into which she had lain since the previous day and brought to the drawingroom in her fathers arms attended by her sorrowing mother
slowly they explained to her that the grimy pedler was her lover miraculously restored
she listened dumbly for a while with pathetic listlessness then her keen eyes penetrated the disguise and a torrent of tears broke the killing tension and restored her to life and happiness
no one slept until david had told his story but he left the mystery of the two mysterious guards for his listeners to solve in their own way
next day he heard with wonder and consternation the full details of the fire that had broken out on saturday and reduced the city in many parts to a ruin
the treacherous rebel sympathizers were blamed for it mr murray asserted and some of them had been put to death already by the royal troops
but my cousins godfrey and caroline exclaimed david
truly my friends i am ashamed of my thoughtlessness but i have not thought to ask you where they are and how they fare
never fear david said mrs murray you may trust mrs caroline to protect her husband and herself
they are once more in possession of your house in wall street and in the course of events they have become professed and accredited royalists and tories
you may well believe that i am amazed said david but of course i am highly pleased
i am glad that my house is no longer divided against itself
what of our residence
you say that they are there
your house was providentially spared by the fire answered mr murray and i believe that your cousins were keeping it in order for you when they heard the crushing news of your impending fate
now they will be overjoyedto know that you are safe
later in the day david wrote a cordial letter to godfrey treves announcing his safe return and congratulating his cousifl upon his conversion to the ranks of the royalists
he sent it into the city by his faithful valet and on the following day a letter arrived from godfrey with a postscript added by caroline indeed david you must yield to urging and visit us at once
you will find your house in order dear cousin and we shall welcome you with great joy
you may feel assured that we do not regret our new allegiance and it will be a rare pleasure to gather about the old table and pledge a family toast to his majesty the king cousin caroline
david waited another day loath to leave jessica even for a few hours then he drove into the halfruined city in a postchaise to call at the wall street mansion and spend an afternoon with his relatives
trinity church was wellnigh razed to the ground and some three hundred houses were leveled
it was a tragic dispiriting sight and he was glad to gain the shelter of his own roof and find it sound and much as he had left it
the welcome accorded him was hearty it seemed to him just a trifle too hearty
he checked himself in wondering if godfrey and caroline would have mourned him sincerely
they were ambitious people and in addition to the mansion they would have received his money from the british funds after his death
he banished such thoughts in a moment and sat down gaily to a repast such as caroline was proud to provide
they toasted the king with a real enthusiasm and then david at their request began a recital of his strange experiences
he was interrupted presently however by the arrival of visitors but godfrey ordered the butler to bring them directly to the diningroom and requested david to proceed
there was a shuffling of feet in the hall and david turned to see captain goring standing on the threshold while at his back were three fully armed grenadiers
caroline uttered a soft cry and fled suddenly through a side door
captain goring said godfrey with strange sharpness in his voice this is your man
what gasped david starting back
why david treves snapped the british captain i arrest you in the kings name for treason to the royal government for consorting with notorious rebels and for lending aid to the rebel cause
who dares to fasten such accusations upon me cried david livid with rage
as a loyal subject said godfrey with a virtuous gravity of countenance i was forced most unwillingly to report your duplicity to the military governor
i have done my duty
to be continued rasson cf paul bailey left waverly on the afternoon freight
the train didnot stop
it didnot even hesitate
but dave crasson wasnot the sort of individual to let a little thing like that interfere with his very necessary departure
he just raced his pinto along the station platform and grabbing the side of a car swung aboard
our posse arrived in time to take in the performance and we fired one volley
then seeing that crasson was out of range and still traveling eastward we surrounded his bronc
well sir it was the first time any of us had ever had the opportunity of studying steamboat at close range
so we roped him from four different angles and then looked him over
and he returned our scrutiny with such utter unconcern that we all found it mighty hard to believe that this was really steamboat the fastest longwindest meanest piece of horseflesh in seven states
and would you believe it sheriff hazen wished that critter on the bar maybe it was because we happened to be the nearest outfit to waverly maybe because the foreman yours truly was an easy mark
anyhow steamboat was given a durable little corral all to himself and became our star boarder
for three days we didnot do a thing on the place but greet visitors who thought they could ride the critter
for three nights we did nothing but sit up with the victims
the day sam bransford the worlds champion bronco buster took his turn the bar would have made the denver round up look like a game of huckchuck
folks came from miles around
and when we led steamboat out of his corral they yelled like a pack of comanches
the pinto was on his metal
somehow he seemed to know that it was to be a decisive battle and it was all we could do to get both girths cinched up
then we let bransford ride
that is the biggest part of the audience was willing and anxious enough that he should ride but the darned horse just stood up on his hind legs and started rocking like a steamboat heard of that trick of his how hed got his name
but wed never seen it before rainbowing and sjunfishing had proved effective enough to unseat all previous candidates
now however steamboat was doing his darnedest
after hed rocked left lung over to the far side of his right he just naturally brought down his forelegs stiff ducked his head and the matinee was over
that settled it
steamboat had made good and we all went back to the even tenor of punching cows for old man elihu martin
elihu had a daughter miss kate and along about this time she came home from the east where she had been exchanging some of the old mans beef dividends for a roll of sheepskin
dave harkness the new man drove her in from the depot at waverly and they arrived just as our jarge and appreciative audience was hitting the trail for home
of course harkness had to tell her all fibout it and harkness was some teller
having been with the bar but two days he wasnot quite up on all the details but he told miss kate enough about dave crasson the outlaw and his wonderful horse to fill a dime novel
he even took crasson s picture from the bunkhouse and showed her the living likeness of the blackbearded roadagent
then he led her to the durable little corral and introduced her to steamboat
i happened along at that moment he a beauty she says to me and i choked when i nodded grown to despise that calicocovered dynamo and it was hard to acknowledge his good looks
but hes a maverick i told her hating to see her lose her innocent young heart to such a critter
dave the only man who ever rode him
surely you donot believe that she says pushing a handful of grass over the pickets
well butts in harkness he didnot until hed tried the critter himself
then we both gasped
relieve it or not that long lanky bronco with the wicked rep whinnied like a hungry colt and trotted right up to her
why says miss kate as he took the grass out of her hand i think you boys have been libeling him
and as she spoke she reached over and rubbed muzzle
and he liked it
yes sir
the liked it
if he hadnot kept one mean eye on me have thought it was another horse
inside of twentyfour hours steamboat and miss kate were pals
before the week was up they were bosom companions and if it hadnot been for the old man who had dealt with horses for some thirty years shed have tried to ride him
but miss kate and steamboat didnot furnish the only affair for discussion around the bar that summer
it wasnot more than a week before all hands were talking about the way young harkness was getting better acquainted with the old mans sole heir
if harkness hadnot been such a darned likable cuss it might have caused more than a little talk for the boys all looked upon miss kate as the one bright star in a firmament of alkali hard work bacon and eggs
sometimes i wondered why the old man never seemed to notice the way those two young souls looked at each other as they talked in low tones which nobody else could hear
but it wasnot my funeral
i wasnot her old man
besides the job of foreman on the bar didnot allow much time to devote to other folks affairs
i decided to keep mum
but decisions donot count when fate steps in
it happened like this
i was at waverly doing some shopping for the old man when suddenly i looked up and started
tacked to the side of pete liquor emporium was a picture of jake harkness
the wind or something had got away with the lower half of it but it was harkness all right
from the nose up the only part left was jim harkness
and across the top of that poster was printed five thousand dollars reward
well sir i stood and looked at that picture openmouthed for ten minutes until finally a stranger came along touched me on the shoulder and says do you know him
know him says sure who is it
the stranger grinned
huh he says
you must be a newcomer to these parts
everybody knows that face
only the black whiskers have been torn off
dave crasson
oh says and i went inside
but it got me thinking seen crasson s picture all over the country for the past six months
but never before seen it without the whiskers
when i got back to the bar i called jake harkness aside
we stood right by corral
jake says how long since you shaved your whiskers off
well sir i told myself then and there if jake harkness was dave crasson they were both darn good actors
he just simply grinned and says whiskers
i never had any pete
oh yes you did says and you shaved em off between the time dave crasson hopped the freight at waverly and jake harkness got a job on the bar wise jake
own up
laugh
you could have heard him half way to the railroad but he stopped as quick as hed begun
miss kate stepped in between us heard it all and her eyes were flashing mighty prettily
she bent them right on dave and she looked him through and through
but though hed stopped laughing at her first appearance he was complete master of himself
he was more surprised than anything else
and he waited for her to speak
jake she said i heard what pete said to you
what does he mean
i donot know said jake and i figured that been a bit hasty
she turned to me
what did you mean she asked her eyes still flashing
well said judging that i might as well own up and then apologize i saw a picture of dave crasson today over at waverly
all that was left of it was from the nose up and miss kate believe it or not it was the image of jake here
so when i got home i just made up my mind to ask him if by any chance he happened to be next of kin or otherwise related to the road agent
you mean corrected miss kate that you thought jake might be dave crasson himself
her question made it easier
i nodded
again she turned to jake studied him several minutes and asked are you dave crasson
he was serious now
an accusation like mine was enough to make any one serious
he returned her gaze without a flicker as he said miss kate my names jake harkness
i never saw dave crasson and if lucks with mrf i never will
do you believe me
she studied him again before committing herself
then she nodded
yes jake she said
i do
then to me pete it was horrid of you to think such an awful thing of him
i know it i answered and awfully sorry
i stuck out my hand jake grabbed it and the incident was closed without bloodshed
but somehow or other i couldnot get that picture of dave crasson out of my head lay awake nights thinking of it and at times almost make up my mind to talk it over with the old man
but i never did
jake harkness proved to be too much of an asset to the bar before the summer was over he had become an absolute necessity to the outfit and when i told the old man as much he said hed known it himself for some weeks
so things drifted along
miss kate and harkness became thicker and thicker and before cold weather set in it was generally understood around the bar that jake was about to tak6 unto himself a wife and old man martin a soninlaw
and the boys were tickled to death
harkness was a popular cuss
yes sir even who still entertained a sneaking notion that he had some sort of a past that wasnot in his family bible was looking forward to that wedding
then things occurred
first a kentucky thoroughbred arrived as a sort of preliminary wedding gift from the old man to the blushing bride
and he was some horse
speed
he went over the trail like a german torpedo and i ought to know
i tried him out
and after pronounced him safe and sane jake harkness hopped astride never seen jake on a spirited horse before
he was a stickler for easygaited mounts the kind that donot go in for the fancy steps
but hercules how he did ride that thoroughbred
say there wasnot a man on the place that didnot wonder how hed kept his accomplishments under cover and miss kate laughed in sheer pride
as for me my mind reverted to that torn picture of dave crasson and i looked over toward corral
it gave me an idea
jake said after hed circled the house a couple of times and then hopped down youre the only man hereabouts outside the boss thats never had a try at steamboat thinking you could make the critter go some
sam bransford couldnot he says easy like as he helped miss kate to mount her preliminary wedding gift
she looked down at him and smiled
maybe she had thoughts something like mine
maybe she was thinking of the story about no man but dave crasson ever riding steamboat
anyhow she said why donot you try him jake
what could he do
the boys had the dynamo under saddle and out in the open before you could say daniel boone
and jake looking as if he was about to enter the electric chair stepped forward
fight
well some
harkness started it with an indian yell and a savage slap on the flank
up went the pinto and when hed risen to the full extent of his long hind legs he commenced rocking
it was we could see jake harkness slowly succumbing to the torture
then down headforemost went steamboat aild headforemost went harkness to the turf
i tell you i was relieved
it didnot look like acting
i glanced at miss kate and she was relieved too
every ounce of suspicion went out of us then and there
and in her happiness miss kate just slapped that thoroughbred across the neck and he bolted
off went her hat one stirrup flew wild and the brute was running away
miss kate didnot yell
no
she wasnot that kind of a girl
she stuck to the little english saddle and die pulled on those reins with all her strength
but it wasnot enough
the horse had the bit between his teeth and he was boss
yes sir and there wasnot another horse under saddle on the whole place that is none except steamboat
and i guess he was the only one that could have caught the thoroughbred anyway
however some of the boys beat it for the corral
they had to do something
and i might have gone too
but as i swung around i saw something that turned my blood cold and let me say right here and now that i was darned glad to see it
jake harkness had leaped toward steamboat
snatching up the dangling reins he went clean to the saddle without so much as touching the stirrups
and steamboat
he just stood rigid until jake had whispered something in his ear
then pivoting he went after that runaway like a bolt of texas lightning
and it sure was exquisite
a half mile up the trail went a cloud of dust which was miss kate and her preliminary wedding gift
and when steamboat got under full headway that cloud of dust didnot seem to be doing much more than just moving
harkness must have put in some slick io argosy work for when the action ceased and the dust drifted clear he had that thoroughbred on one side of him and miss kate on the other his arm about her and steamboat was trotting back toward us as meek as my old bess
harkness was crasson all right
there wasnot a man on the place who didnot know it
but say you ought to have seen the boys grab his hands when he got down after handing miss kate to me
and you ought to have seen miss kate look at him when shed finally got over the scare
when she spoke we all listened
jake she said why did you lie to pete and me that day by the corral
because i loved you he said and he seemed awful stuck up about it
you see turning to me decided to go straight when i hopped the freight at waverly
but later i wanted to be near steamboat
he was the only friend ever had
i planned to get away with him and go east
then i met miss kate
i couldnot leave
but i guess its all over now
if some of you will come along just jog over and give myself up to sheriff hazen
no you wonot neither said before i realized that it wasnot up to me to pronounce the sentence
i noticed that the boys all nodded and miss kate grabbed right hand and said of course you wonot
your real name jake is going to remain a secret with everybody on the bar you canot go unless you take me
well sir jake harkness is my boss now
the old man just sits around and smokes his pipe and plays with the two little harknesses
and when jake goes into waverly on steamboat folks look at him and say harkness and dave crasson are the only men who ever rode that pinto
and if any of us happen to be trailing along we grin and think pf the day steamboat made that preliminary wedding gift look like a crippled coyote are we coming to
the youth held his three companions enthralled by what he had been saying and the fire that flared in his eyes
where are we going to end he continued
food riots have commenced
the mob begins to rule
next bomb play will be introduced and death he threw out his hands in a prophetic gesture the result fellows he went on growing more voluble in his wildness
why look here
do you know that the investigation which the federal government has been conducting into the high food prices has resulted in the verdict that the prices are occasioned by speculators food manipulators and that the conditions are facilitated by a general car shortage and all that
and then the commission adjourns without recommending a single remedy
i tell you boys well never get satisfaction in this country well never rid ourselves of high prices and speculators until we take drastic measures
hang a few of these millionaires who corner the food market and shake millions into their coffers
he paused a minute and glanced through the pullman
karby seated three chairs behind the fellow met his wild eyes with an even but interested stare
it was apparent that karby had at first been amused then infected by the youths ardor and enthusiasm
a magazine lay face upward across karby s knees but it had gone unread for some moments
a pretty girl in the chair diagonally opposite had also lowered a book and listened
her face had changed color slightly at the wild suggestion of capital punishment for food speculators karby fleeting glance caught the expression and he vaguely wondered at it as he prepared to hear what further the youth had to expound
it was very evident that his stronger arguments were about to burst forth
he cleared his throat straightened to a more commanding attitude and stretched forth his long arms as though preparing for emphatic gesticulation our own town for example
potatoes selling for threefifty a bushel thats at the rate of about three cents apiece
think of it more than we paid for lemons two years ago
and that isnot all
mr grimes our butter man told us the other day that he has five hundred bushels of potatoes in his cellars and that he has been paid a big price by some agent who came along two weeks ago not to sell these potatoes for at least three months
these agents have gone all over the country making similar overtures to farmers in order to keep low the potato supply and thus permit prices to be boosted
he took another breathing spell swallowed and plunged into his subject again
truxton in our own town cassius stanley truxton who says boldly that hes going to clean up a million dollars in eggs
he doesnot make any bones about it puts his fingers through his vest and comes right out with the information that he has two hundred thousand gross of eggs in cold storage gross not dozens and that hes going to hold them until the price soars and then hell sell and what he asks insolently is the public going to do about it
do about it
nothing of course
what can the public do about it when the government permits such proceedings
and hes only one of the many speculators who has corhered eggs all over the united states sugar he exploded going off on another tack
for a year the speculators have been trying to comer the sugar market and have at last succeeded
sugar sells at twenty cents a pound in some of our larger cities and the supply is so low that many houses canot get a bit of it
fine state of affairs for a peaceful nation a country that isnot at actual war with anybody prices higher than they are in germany in england
do you know what theyre paying right now for potatoes in toronto and they think the price exorbitant cents a bushel a fact have a cousin living in toronto who wrote that to me
now i do not believe in mob rule and anarchy he went on in quieter tones as though he realized he had broached a ticklish subject
but what are the people to do when the government that rules them sits back and discusses the situation in cabinet meetings and then suggests an appropriation of four hundred thousand dollars for a thorough investigation which they propose to extend over a period of six months
six months when the food crisis is on us now
six months when the people in our large city slums are starving
six months when anarchy threatens now
might as well operate on a man after he is dead as to say they will deal with this situation in six months
do you fellows know what it is to starve to feel the pinch of hunger gnawing at your stomachs
i had a touch of it once was lost three days on a hunting trip in northern canada
i tell you hunger will make people do anything
no six months investigations will not help
what we want is action drastic action now now
he shouted the final now till the car rang with the noise
there fell a silence
after his burst of oratory the silence hung like the hush which follows the boom of a great gun
karby stared reflectively at this young firebrand
he had spoken fanaticism yes
but there was great thought behind his words a prophetic warning a review of the situation which was startling
karby glanced at the girl diagonally opposite
her cheeks were red with the flush that had bespread them some time ago and her eyes like his stared with a studied expression as though her mind might be rehearsing the better points the young fellow had made
what suggestions would you offer one of his companions now asked the speaker
i would suggest drastic action at once by the government
but do you know what i would do if i was one of these peculiar millionaires who had so much money he didnot know what to do with it and yet who couldnot get any pleasure any enjoyment out of life
we read about these fellows occasionally in the yellow journals the case for instance of a multimillionaire who kills himself because he couldnot get anything out of life who had been melancholy for months
there are lots of these men
well if i was one of them get some excitement some enjoyment out of this very situation
do you know what do
well tell you take a town like our own for example where the food prices are high where there resides an egg king like our friend truxton go into that town and secretly rent a hall a place like the old fair building on south street for example
then hire an army of men to work for me and stock that place with everything in the food line i could get hold of spend millions send men out through the country to buy up potatoes eggs vegetables canned goods preserves everything in the eating line and then one day throw my place open after i had such a supply that they couldnot buy me out in a month and slash prices practically give the goods away
and eggs sell them for fifteen twenty cents a dozen and put this man truxton out of business
it wouldnot benefit the country at large one whit but by george be one millionaire whod be getting some enjoyment and excitement out of life
excitement
why have a thousand speculators at me threatening bribing coaxing what do an idle dream a vision but do it if i had millions of money at my control
and then truxton could rot with the eggs hes piled up
karby was leaning forward as if at a play of intense dramatic situations
he stared at this orator as though he had been a luther calm gray eyes were now fired and spit forth glints like bits of chipped steel
his hands were trembling
there was a perspiration oozing over his broad high forehead
for a second he glanced toward the pretty girl feeling a sort of companionship for her from the fact that he and she were in reality the immediate audience
the girls face was crimson and she was a prey to confusion
karby stared at her fascinated by the guilt which seemed to shine in her features
she swept her eyes up
karby caught his breath with a jerk
they were deep eyes pretty wide set and the blue in them now seemed gray now blue now gray again
they were eyes which karby knew he would remember long after he had forgotten the accompanying details of her face eyes which he might awaken at night to see staring at him out of the vistas of his memory
for a second karby forgot the oratory and the subject that had so stirred him and lost himself in staring at the girl
coming to at last he turned away his glance
at that minute the porter bustled into the car and began his obsequious and remunerative task of wielding the whiskbroom
at the next station the orator and his three friends prepared to alight and their conversation told karby that this was their home town
without more ado he followed them from the train hailed a cab and directed to be driven to the best hotel
karby had found a way of buying himself such an interest in life as he had never possessed
as his cab swung out of the station he saw the pretty girl who had sat diagonally opposite him being handed into a wonderful motorcar by a chauffeur who was the last word in adornment as far as livery was concerned and in the rear of the car a striking looking man tall and broad and rather gray made room for her beside him
one month later the old fair building on south street was the scene of wonderful activity
it was a gigantic frame structure which covered one square block of ground
time had weathereaten its paint and its ornate embellishments but its hugeness was still intact it yet loomed up big and titanic on a dark night a picture of desolation a reminder of days when the whole county dispensed with business for the greater part of a week and journeyed here in droves to witness an exhibition which to them was the epitome of expositions
it was ten years since the place had responded to the call of human patronage and dust and swallows and sparrows bats owls spiders and pigeons had usurped the ihterior and by right of conquest claimed it as their own
but now the great double doors in each of the four streets were standing wide open teams were driving in and out a veritable thousand men were scurrying over the place like rats
the interior reverberated with the sound of banging hammer and sledge
joists came down and new and stronger ones replaced them
men ran hither and thither with blueprints and folding rules
superintending the work of construction consulting with foremen and bosses was nathan karby
he was ubiquitous now on the inside of the building now on the out directing the laying of a railroad siding to his unloading platfqfm
his aims seemed to be speed unity of action concentration of work to one end in view
a glance told the most casual that his word was law that neither blueprint nor plan verbal nor written contract mattered a whit
what he said went
as one day followed another and this army of workmen continued their labor order began to emanate from the chaos of beams lumber stone brick tiling
six great long aisles which ran the whole length of the building paralleled each other like six great streets of a city these aisles were very wide and soor they were equipped with counters bins glass cases shelves cupboards drawers in his quarters at the jefferson hotel karby had set up an improvised office and here behind a flat top desk he interviewed agents sellers farmers grange officials salesmen
at the same time he recruited an army of workers whom he sent out through the country into neighboring cities and villages
these agents spread over the land like the tentacles of an octopus and they went equipped with cash and bought and bought and bought
karby was elated
he was purchasing his interest in life
his gray eyes shone
he caught his breath and thrust out his firm jaw and smacked his thin lips when he anticipated the scenes in which he would soon participate
the moneyed men of the community would sweep down on him in droves
the food speculators and manipulators would haunt him like a bad dream
he would welcome these scenes
he could scarcely wait for them to develop
one noon when karby returned to the jefferson for luncheon he noticed in the lobby myriads of young girls who were accosting the hotel guests in quest of funds for one of the city hospitals
karby had read in the daily papers that a campaign was being inaugurated to raise a hundred thousand dollars
people were tagged with a yellow check as they responded with contributions
karby had escaped the campaigners in the street by reason of the fact that he drove a motorcar and had been off too early in the morning to be approached
but now the minute he stepped into the hotel a most charming young lady picked him out as her victim and came hurrying toward him
karby paused and found himself looking into the same pair of beautiful eyes that he had looked into that day on the train
as his gaze met hers karby saw that she recognized and placed him on the instant
the slightest shade of confusion swept over her for a second and brought a tinge to her cheek and a downward sweep of the long brown lashes
in this nearer view of her karby was astounded that such a charming creature had been displaced for a single day in his memory by his absorption in his scheme
perhaps you have read of the campaign to raise money for an addition to one of our city hospitals she began tremulously and not without a trace of confusion trying not to miss anybody and thought perhaps some of the guests at our hotels might want to subscribe
i suppose its a worthy object karby said easily playing for time for the purpose of detaining the girl longer a stranger here you know
oh indeed i can vouch for the worthiness of this hospital
they do need money so badly and they must have more room or i donot know what they will do
we will be so grateful for anything you may care to give
she selected a tag from a bundle in her hands and made ready to tie it through the lapel of his coat
i should think that in these times karby replied still angling for some scheme to detain the girl that a couple of gross of good fresh eggs would be about as acceptable as anything else to a hospital
karby had intended to elaborate on the remark and give it quite a facetious turn but the girls actions checked him
she flushed red to the roots of her hair deep deep red her eyes went down and he saw her lips quiver
whei her lashes went up he saw that her eyes were wet with tears of wounded pride and hurt vanity
she stared at him for just a second then turned so cold that her very glance chilled him to the bone
then she seemed to rise straighter than ever as she stood there like a statue
i should not have accosted you she said icily
i should have known that one must expect to find your type in hotels
she made as though to move past him but he touched her on the arm and detained her
i beg your pardon he said sincerely
believe me i meant no offense whatever
i am so sorry admit my remark was ill chosen to one who is a stranger to me
i apologize
i want you to accept something for this worthy cause
i do not care to have my name mentioned or even known but if you will wait here just a bit while i go to the bank and draw my contribution in cash
i should like to give a thousand dollars
you will wait and you will assure me that you have overlooked my remark
he smiled at her and his smile was nearly as contagious as her own
she murmured something in the affirmative and he was gone
when he came back he handed her a sealed envelope and permitted her to tie a tag to his lapel
was it fate or destiny or marvelous coincidence that the very next day on motoring into the country to interview some farmers engine trouble left him stranded miles from the city and she happened along in a huge touringcar ordered her chauffeur to stop and render aid and his car refusing all calls to motion she was unconventional enough to give him a lift back to town
moreover she was affable to the extent of engaging in conversation a tribute which the occasion did not necessarily demand of her
karby was elated
meantime work progressed rapidly on the old fair building
such an army of men must soon accomplish results
karby spared no expense was thorough to a detail although his natural business ability saw to it that no cash was wasted
in two weeks the building was nearing completion and the traffic manager whom karby had imported from one of the larger railroads began delivering carload after carload of foodstuffs
it seemed as though the worlds production of potatoes was being emptied into the building agents penetrated the country to its depths had driven them into localities where the food shortage and the speculator had not set foot and they were able to buy at prices far under those demanded by wholesalers in the cities
karby himself marveled at the miles which these provisions were covering to reach him
without being conscious of it he had whipped together a wonderful organization
and not alone potatoes came flooding into his place
every known popular and necessary edible which mankind caters to came in superabundance
of course the town soon began to wonder about the project
the press sent reporters in droves to interview foremen laborers superintendents contractors but karby himself had given no information to a single soul and therefore they could divulge nothing
rumor and idle gossip and speculation ran high
the newspapers supplied fiction where facts were lacking and by publishing something which was not true tempted karby to state his real purpose a trick of the press by the way but karby only smiled and held his peace
he meant to open his great relief store as he called it on a monday morning and the preceding sunday he intended to carry a brief but glaring ad in the papers of the town stating his list of prices and his purpose in selling at cost or below
the whole gigantic affair was to be a loss to karby from beginning to end
financiers would have stood back appalled at the idea and had they seen his expense accounts and compared them with his intended selling prices they would have succumbed to emotion or voted karby a subject for an asylum
karby forgot no detail
as the time approached to divulge his great scheme he employed a corps of detectives and upon their advice procured the services of two hundred special deputies
his money brought certain politicians to exert their power which made the deputies possible
these deputies guarded the building day and night
it was a necessary precaution
food manipulators were none too exacting about the means they employed and karby was advised that once his scheme was out and the finer points of his great plan were discovered the rage of the speculators would soar and they might possibly stoop to force to thwart his scheme
meantime his detectives were busy taking such steps as would prevent speculators agents invading the store when it did open and buying up the foodstuffs
on friday the building was an arsenal of provisions
and it was on this friday about four oclock that the storm broke
karby had returned to the hotel early and was sitting at his desk framing the advertisement which he desired for the sunday press when mason one of his clerks entered and informed him that a delegation of six men desired to see him that they would present no cards and appeared to be the gloomiest surliest group of individuals he had ever seen
karby sent out a detective to explain that he was at present engaged and would be unable to see them
he also ordered the detective to discover if possible something of their identities and to refuse to book them for any interview as he didnot wish to argue his position to anybody
the detective returned sweltering
he declared he had never put in such a ten minutes that the six had nearly tom him to pieces and he had only got rid of them by threatening to call for help and have them ejected forcibly from the suite
he also reported that the big man of the assemblage was truxton the egg king and that he had with him a man named macavey his secretary and a farmer whom the detective discovered was president of one of the granges
another of the men was proprietor of a large wholesale house in the city and the remaining two he could find nothing about
from that moment on karby was more sought after than the president of the united states
a double and then a quadruple guard was placed before his suite and all afternoon and late into the evening men came excited men enraged men perturbed men men who pleaded threatened then pleaded again to be granted an interview
karby turned them all down
he would see no one whose business he did not know beforehand
he was forced to dine in his rooms as a precaution against annoyance and he spent the evening reading the towns papers
the reporters had at last hit upon something like the truth and had displayed the news in glaring headlines
this no doubt was responsible for his popularity and had set the six excited men on his heels
speculation ran high
one sheet carried a brief editorial commenting in a general way on the rumor and offering neither praise nor condemnation of the plan
karby smiled
he ordered the night guard at the store doubled and went to bed
the next morning early the interviewers started their vigil and lined up in the corridor outside his door until the place looked like the floor of the new york stock exchange
at eleven karby applied to the hotel management for aid with the result that the police were called in cleared the corridors patrolled the place and kept it clear
at eleventhirty one of the policemen brought karby a card stating that a very beautiful woman had sent it in and desired to see mr karby on a matter of the utmost importance
karby glanced at the name on the card which read simply miss truxton
karby stared at the card as though fascinated
at first his calm and rather tantalizing smile puckered his lips but he sobered immediately and studied the situation a second
so they had got a delegate through at last they were resorting to a woman to tell their message the egg kings daughter sense of chivalry produced a struggle within him
ordinarily he would have been invulnerable to this means of reaching him but if a woman of breeding was willing to sacrifice her pride to the extent of coming here to see him he believed he should grant the interview
he told the policeman to admit her
karby went to the window and stood looking out
he heard her enter heard the door close softly heard her take a step into the place and then pause apparently to collect herself
this was what karby desired
he turned slowly and looked into the exquisite eyes of the woman on the train die very girl who had approached him in the hotel lobby soliciting donations to lakeside hospital
she was dressed in a tailored suit and presented that wellgroomed and welltended appearance that had so impressed him when he first saw her
she wore a hat which rather shielded her face but it did not prevent his seeing the look of incredulity that swept into her features as she recognized him
as for himself karby was not sure whether he changed color or no
he merely stared at her again a prey to her exquisite eyes
it was a shock the knowledge that this girl was the egg kings daughter and even as he stood there looking at her the realization of the situation came over him
the plan of his general relief store the slashing of prices the eggs he already had in stock which he was going to sell for a song all meant ruin financial downfall for truxton
he had known this before all along and had even counted on it but now the realization seemed to turn cold and dampen his ardor
the girl was the first to recover herself
she came forward holding out her hand and smiling frankly into his eyes
i am so glad to find some one here that i know come to see mr karby you will present me to him it will make things so much easier for me
great heavens she hadnot yet awakened to the real situation
he smiled rather wistfully shook his head slowly and said quietly miss truxton i am mr karby
the horror that came into her features was only compensated by their beauty
her eyes opened until he imagined he was looking into two wonderful worlds and she fell back one two three paces and stared at him
karby turned slightly to give her a chance to recover from the shock of his announcement
when he faced her again she was staring calmly at him her big eyes regarding him with something of awe
i hadnot dreamed that you were mr karby although i might have guessed put two and two together
you were on the train that day and heard the wild talk of that wild youth
mr karby she took a step forward and stared hard at him it isnot true that youre going to open your store and sell at such low prices that it will ruin those who have stocked up on things hoping to sell when the price was up
karby smiled
he shook his head slowly in the affirmative and said quietly afraid its all true miss truxton putting into effect the very idea which that wild youth as you call him declared he would follow if he was one of those eccentric and peculiar millionaires who couldnot get any enjoyment out of life
she stared at him permitting him the fullest view of her wonderful eyes and the sweet features that went with them
karby caught his breath
he found a madness seizing upon him a madness which he thrust back with an effort
you know what they call my father she went on slowly
the egg king though i didnot know until now that you were his daughter
i understand now why my remark that day caused you such annoyance but i was not aware of your identity then
she passed over the explanation as though she considered it trivial in comparison with what she had come to say
you will slash the price on eggs mr karby
storage eggs for twenty cents per dozen fresh ones for twentyfive and the strictest kind of fresh eggs guaranteed for thirty
it means financial ruin to my father she said slowly her eyes not meeting his directly but staring at the wall as though she were speaking some speech which she had committed to memory
he has two hundred thousand gross of eggs in storage listen mr karby my father stands ready to buy up every egg you possess for forty cents a dozen if you will agree not to stock up any more
karby shook his head and smiled
no miss truxton i canot be bought neither can the eggs i have
those eggs are for housewives who havenot had the privilege of owning eggs in any quantity for months
men who have cornered the egg market will have to suffer along with those people who cornered potatoes sugar
your father is not the only one miss truxton
but mr karby my father has done no wrong
why people buy real estate and hold it until prices go way up and then sell the legitimate way to make money
why do you enter into this wild scheme losing millions of dollars by it
exactly miss truxton
he paused collected himself and faced her squarely
miss truxton it was more than coincidence that day which brought me a listener to that wild youth with his fanatical scheme
but i was one of the very men he described a millionaire if you will permit me the term lor lack of a better who could see nothing interesting in life
i was a veritable nomad on the face of the earth
that very trip i was making had no definite destination in view
i was just going from one place to another seeking something that would enliven me and i found it
never in all my existence have i been so keenly interested in life as now
this exploit has made me
i shall never forget it
of course i shall be losing millions by the scheme but what of it
it is my own money
moreover i am not stupid enough to believe that this one relief store as i call it will affect the prices of the country in general
it wonot
it canot
but it satisfies me serves my purpose and some of the people will benefit by it
and you would not consider selling out your eggs to father at the price he named
most decidedly no miss truxton
well remember mr karby that i came to you and made you an offer forget this
i wanted to give you a chance
you spumed it
men mr karby donot give up easily especially when they see their fortunes slipping away as you threaten to make them slip away
mr karby
before he could reply she was gone
karby stared after her rehearsing her final words and trying to ferret out their hidden meaning
why had she come to see him
had old truxton really offered to buy his eggs or had she come for some other purpose
she had given him a chance
her final speech hinted at trouble seemed to insinuate a threat
what did these food speculators mean to do
what scheme had her father concocted to thwart him
and did she know that scheme
her words sounded as though she did
that night at nine he had the answer
it came by phone and was from one of his special deputies on guard at the store
a mob was collecting about the building a mob already a thousand strong a mob that threatened violence had been stirred up by the news that the goods were stock which karby had cornered and that he was going to sell at top notch prices and squeeze the people
karby saw it all now
he jumped into his car and headed for the store
if the rabble was a thousand strong when the message reached him they had doubled by the time he arrived at the outskirts of the crowd
he parked his machine and proceeded on foot
whoever had stirred up the mob and had put the riot idea into their heads had dohe a good work for the speculators
there were women in the horde wildeyed women some holding babies in their arms some leading children by the hand
it was a motley throng a throng of all nationalities speaking polyglot tongues
and above all came the cry of we are hungry we are hungry
alcohol had done its work
money must have been disbursed freely
the move was hardly one of eleventh hour fomentation but held been brewed all through the day possibly for several days
karby stood aghast
no one knew him
he was safe
but his heart sank
his two hundred deputies were on duty but violence might ensue and death might result
and this karby wished to avoid
the instigators had done their parts thoroughly
karby could tell by the stray bits of talk he picked up
a millionaire who had been working for months cornering potatoes sugar eggs was ready to unload on the public at hitherto unheard of high prices
the people were to be robbed
he was one of the causes of the food shortage throughout the country
karby stood bewildered by what he heard
he listened to threats against his life violence against the building which housed his provisions the provisions he had been weeks collecting for the relief of these poor deluded creatures
karby censured himself for his lack of foresight
if he had only advertised his sales in the saturday papers instead of waiting until sunday all would have been well
but now quotations would lead the people to believe that it was the mob that had forced him to the low prices and that they had not been his intention from the first
if only he could work his way to the front but this was impossible
he must stand here an idle spectator and await developments
and then the mob closed in pressed together made of itself a body more compact
a great din arose
shouts and jeers rent the air
threats were no longer muttered beneath breaths or hissed into the ears of nearby companions but were shouted openly
a few police perhaps thirty or forty appeared on the outskirts of the crowd and tried to disperse the people but mobs and riots were new to the police of this city and they were incompetent to handle the situation
the hope their presence had inspired in karby died
by this time the rabble had pressed so close to the building that karby was scarcely forty feet from it
he could see a dim light burning through the windows and his deputies on guard armed to the teeth
the rioters increased their shouts and jeers
waves of motion rippled over the mob as though they meant to rush the place and storm it by force
some one presently hurled a brick which crashed through a window
at the noise of falling glass the crowd went crazy
karby sickened
it was all over
they were on the verge of violence
his deputies might control the situation by the use of arms but this would be awful
then suddenly the whole building blazed forth with light and made the surrounding scenery bright as day
men could be seen hurrying to and fro in the store and presently in every window there was posted one of the huge placards bearing the prices which were to go into effect monday morning
the jeers of the crowd died
silence developed
those who could read english perused the signs hungrily
presently a low hum rippled through the mob
they were translating to their companions what they saw
again semblance of silence ensued as though the rabble were considering their course
this was intruded upon by yells of a lie a game believe those signs and karby knew these cries came from paid instigators
some shouted to burn the place provisions and all while others shrieked to storm it and carry the foodstuffs away
but the majority were quiet
the printed prices were there before their eyes
the multitude were plainly puzzled and perhaps disappointed
they had come to do violence
they were to be cheated of their prey
this was to be a store for them
these prices were within their reach
there was something wrong
in vain did the instigators try to incite violence try to rush the people forward in a great attacking movement
but the throngs were plainly stirred and karby knew by the attitude of those near him that they had been impressed
the psychology of the mob is a study
it is like a torpedo it must be handled rightly or it may boomerang and attack those that assembled it
some one suddenly shouted at the top of his lungs get the egg king cornered eggs
he admits it
he asks what is the public going to do about it show him
to the egg kings house to the egg kings house
karby caught a glimpse of the fellow who had raised the cry
it was the orator who had spoken that day on the train
in a second the mob had taken up the slogan and karby heard the noise of rushing feet and the next instant the whole mass swung into movement and dashed on their way
karby was swept along with them
his mind worked fast
once they gained house the rage they would have vented on his store and foodstuffs would burst forth with increased and added vigor
karby dared not think what they might do to the place
they were armed with all sorts of weapons and would as soon fire the mansion as anything else and once this rabble understood the real situation and it was likely that some one in the crowd might stumble upon the truth at any second their rage would know no bounds
karby thought frantically
he slowed his pace and permitted the rushing madmen to pass him
presently he found himself so separated from the stragglers that he stopped altogether turned and made for his automobile
he gaified it jumped in swung past his building and sang out orders to his deputies to leave two or three of them on guard and for the others to hurry to the house of the egg king
the orders were received rather sullenly and there were signs of rebellion but the promise of a handsome reward if they saved the place effected the desired change and karby was satisfied to see them start forth in pursuit of the mob to do what they could to quell the riot
karby then took one of them into his car to show him the way to the truxton house
down one street up another they flew taking the shortest route in the effort to get there before the mob arrived
karby could hear the rioters in the distance and urged his car to greater speed
at last a huge residence loomed into view
karby alighted and rushed through the spacious grounds up a broad flight of front steps on to a wonderful veranda and rang the bell
a butler responded and karby did not wait for ceremony but brushed past him into the house
he burst into a room where he heard voices and threw into violent agitation miss truxton her mother and truxton himself who was at a deskphone in smiling conversation with somebody
the egg king was a tall man well developed and broad
his hair was gray his eyes active but rather small and sparkling
he lowered the phone and stared aghast as karby swept into the room and rushed toward him
quick youve not a minute to lose
escape from this house at once
the mob you stirred up against me truxton has turned on you and is now headed here shouting get the egg kin get the egg king
they only stared at him apparently too overcome to comprehend what his words meant
mrs truxton a sweet rather weakfaced woman who looked as though her very life was dominated by this husband of hers showed signs of swooning
truxton himself rose slowly to his feet
you are karby he began and it was evident he intended working himself into a rage but karby interrupted him
yes i am karby but for sake hurry
that mob which your own agents stirred up is mad mad not alone out of belief in the justice of their cause but mad from the alcohol which your money furnished them
do you want to be trapped here like rats no telling what they will do
they surrounded my storehouse threatened violence and wculd have demolished the place had not my deputies thought to flash in the windows the huge posters bearing the price list which will go into effect on monday
then the mob turned and with a shout of get the egg king stampeded down the street
i came here to warn you its more than you deserve but i donot want to see violence done
listen
he rushed to the window and threw it open
in the distance came the roar of the mob gathering in violence as the seconds flew
i have turned my deputies in to try to quell them but there is no quelling that angry mob
they lust for destruction
give your butler orders to get the servants out of the house and come yourselves wait to order your car
i have mine outside
the police truxton began with a movement toward the phone but karby stopped him
the police are powerless forty of them tried to quell the mob before my place and failed
a torrent of angry voices now burst upon the air
the sound brought aetion
truxton pale and with set lips gave orders to the butler
then karby led them from the house to his machine and piloted the same to a side street where he drew up and bade them wait while he went forward to see what he could do
even as he started the noise increased to bedlam and he saw the advance guard of the mob closing in on the truxton place
they paused before it and waited until their number was sufficiently augmented to begin violence
karby saw that he was cut off from his deputies
he stood there wondering what to do when a movement near him caused him to wheel about
miss truxton stood there beside him
i came after you i made them let me
mr karby i want you to know that i think you are white as the saying goes one of the whitest men i have ever heard of
father is impressed by your actions by your coming to warn us
she shuddered and drew nearer to him as a perfect howl and shriek of rage ascended from the mob
a patrol wagon clattered by and dumped a score or more of police who rushed at the mob with a great flourish of clubs and pistols
but they were intimidated almost immediately and hadnot the courage to use firearms against this bedlam of raving people
so they stood there trying to awe the crowd by their uniforms and shouting for them to disperse
the shout was answered by cries of derision and hoots of laughter and some one hurled a missile which crashed through one of the truxton windows
in a second the house was bombarded with bricks and stones and clubs
the glass showered down like rain
the girl clutched karby s hand and hid her face in his shoulder
he threw his arm about her and tried to murmur words of comfort
at the same instant there came to him a great idea
he bade her follow him rushed to a corner and turned in a fire alarm
in a second it seemed the firebells were ringing and the apparatus could be heard in the distance the gongs clanging ferociously
karby went into the crowds and spoke a word or two to the police who caught the idea immediately withdrew to the street intersections and when the fire apparatus drew up ordered the firemen to attach the hose to the waterplugs
this was done in a minute the firemen realizing instantly that the power of dispersing the angry mob lay in their hands
the police gave the word and great streams of water came tearing from the nozzles with terrific force
these streams were turned directly on the mob
the throng was stunned
a cry of rage went up
those in the front ranks made a rush at the firemen but the nearer they came the greater was the force of the water
the leaders paused irresolute
at the same time another stream and then another and another were turned upon them
they were being soaked like drowning rats
still they stood their ground too stunned and bewildered apparently to retreat
in another minute three more streams were deluging the crowd and at a suggestion of karby s these latter streams were directed over the heads of the nearest in an effort to reach the outskirts of the throngs
this did the work
as the water descended on the stragglers in the rear they gave way thus making room for those in advance of them to retreat
at the same time the firemen rushed forward wielding their hose with deadly accuracy
several men were knocked down by the force of the streams and the women in the crowd broke and flew for shelter
this was a signal to ply the water with greater agility and the firemen followed up their advantage as the now bewildered mob gave way
presently the rioters broke helterskelter and in one mad plunge turned and fled getting away from the merciless torrents as best they could
in another ten minutes the streets were clear
heloise truxton drew close to karby and as they started back for the machine she told him softly i came to you today because i knew my father and his agents were going to recruit a mob to try to demolish your great store
i made him promise to let me come and make the proposition to buy your eggs
if you had agreed there would have been no mob
i wanted to save you even though i didnot know then who you were
i failed and the mob was organized and they turned against my father and would have burned us out had it not been for you
we father would have deserved it all and yet you stood by us warned us to flee and then helped us to get here and it was your idea that brought the firemen oh you are splendid mr karby just splendid
not splendid karby told her
i warned your people not because of any idea of returning good for evil but because of you
i wanted to save you why i did it he stopped her in the darkness of some trees and faced her
do you understand that he said
he took her by the hands and looked into her eyes
it was for you
i would have gone through fire to save you
she swayed toward him
karby never knew just how it happened but the next instant she was in his arms and he was holding her tight
her face was upturned to him and on a sudden he stooped and kissed her
her lips were not unresponsive but yielded with a warmth that thrilled him to the soul
he murmured words to her which were for her ear alone and her arms came up and tightened about his neck
and then the city rocked with the roar of an explosion that made the very ground beneath karby and the girl tremble
the concussion was awful
karby disengaged her held her at arms length and stared in the direction of his store
there came a faint illumination from that point and then the heavens flamed with a deep red glare and karby saw tongues of fire shooting up and up and up and gaining ground as the seconds went by
he lowered his head and stood there a picture of dejection despair
the girl threw her arms about his neck and asked him what it was said she was afraid
but karby stared down into her eyes all right miss truxton got you and going to keep you marry you your father has won
i withdrew my deputies to help fight this mob
your fathers agents got in their work
that explosion came from my store
they have fired it
he wins
his comer in eggs is safe
the people lose sorry a hawthorne daniel wiped the sweat from his forehead with a muscular forearm
he stood for a moment gazing at the glaring blaze of one of his furnaces and mumbled something to himself
then he turned and resumed his toil
i ainot got any nerve he muttered as he swung his filled scoop up to the furnace door scattering the coal over the fire
i ainot got any nerve
he shoveled fiercely for a minute and slammed the door
then he straightened up and leaned against his shovel
and everybody on the ship knows it too he added
a vivid picture of the shameful scene of an hour before came to him
why had he not fought when fisher gave him the lie before the others on the pier it he mumbled i ainot got any nerve
he paused and narrowed his eyes
but show em yet
egan was one of a dozen stokers on the ardmore a small dirty british steamer loading at a dock in brooklyn for liverpool
already the ship was filled until the little white circle placed by on her streaked side was splashed by every wave
the big tarpaulins were being unrolled over the hatches by a group of deckhands and a man was taking down the metal disks that kept the rats from journeying over the cables that led to the pier
the second engineer had finished his inspection of the engines and was watching the steady rise of pressure in the steamgages on the big boilers under which the stokers were stirring up the fires
they were all but ready to start to sea
the stokers not on duty had been given the day ashore and had taken advantage of it in the oldfashioned sailor way
every one of them had returned with more stimulants under his belt than were good for him
egan had been with the bunch but had taken less than the others not because he wanted less but because he knew that if he took any more before going to work in the overheated stokehole it would go to his head and he would have to be carried out
that might lose him his berth
the rough crowd had made a day of it a day to remember
they spent all of their money and most of their energy
they were peaceable enough until their feet touched the splintered planks of the pier
then they could not resist a little rough play before going aboard
they pushed each other awkwardly about as they trouped gaily down the pier
in the horseplay egan was shoved forcibly and fell over a cable that lay stretched across his path
he hurt himself just enough to make him angry drunk shouted fisher as egan rose to his feet drunk
i ainot drunk returned the angry egan
you are insisted fisher drunker n a fool
i ainot growled egan
i only had two drinks
you lie yelled fisher aggressively holding his muscular elbows out from his body
you held a dozen
egan turned
the others of the party cleared away from the pair expecting what was to them the logical outcome of so gross an insult
to their utter amazement egan only glared at fisher only stared him in the eye for a moment
then he quailed before the smaller man and boarded the ship without a word
quitter some one shouted and the others jeered
fisher guffawed loudly in his drunken glee
egan went to the forecastle changed his clothes and was ready before the others of his shift
they said nothing when they came up
they only poked each other and grinned
their shift was called and they slid down the slippery ladders into the black pit to feed the furnaces
the engineroom bell jingled and the engines started
when egan climbetl to the deck after his watch below the ship was gliding through the narrows flying a row of flags from her signal halyard
a ragged smudge drifted from the big funnel toward the staten island shore almost blotting out a battleship that lay anchored there
egan stood by the rail for a minute
then he went forward to wash up
regularly he took his shift and regularly he came on deck after the grinding toil to stand by the rail for a minute
always his thoughts for that minute were the same how can i show em i ainot a quitter
in the sixteen days that followed no one spoke to him except when it was necessary
he grew sullen and deliberately kept away from the others
he fretted over it and could think of no way to reinstate himself in the good graces of his fellows
the ship was nearing the end of the voyage
the skipper checked their position on a chart and called the engineer
they talked quietly for a minute
the engineer nodded and returned to the engineroom
he gave an order and the sweating stokers worked furiously in the dim light of the dingy pit
they watched their fires carefully
they shoveled and poked and shoveled again
they worked like slaves and the quivering hands on the pressuregage gradually rose
five pounds ten pounds and the pop valve on boiler opened
it hissed malevolently for a moment and closed
the shovels clanged against the furnace doors and scraped under the piles of coal
then one of the stokers collapsed
he was carried to a ventilator and another stoker was called
he dropped down the ladder and took his place
at first egan did not notice who had come
then as a furnace door was thrown open the glare lit up the heavy body and bullet head of fisher working at the next fire
egan said nothing
he only worked harder
the furnaces roared
the gagehands quivered on the dials
the men worked furiously expending every effort
fisher dripped sweat and panted as he shoveled
the men looked like goblins in the glare and heat
the old steamer plowed through the sea with more foam before her nose than she had ever raised before
the captain was smiling as he stood on the bridge
the engineer was leaning against a polished rail in the engineroom
he reached into his pocket pulled out a plug of tobacco bit it and thought of the baby he would see in its mothers arms when they docked at liverpool in the morning
everything was running smoothly
egan closed the door of a furnace with a slam
he straightened up to rest his aching back
he threw back his shoulders and as he did so a tremendous explosion shook the ship
her bow lifted high into the air
the stokers in the grimy pit slid scrambling across the tilted metal deck straight for the heated fronts of the furnaces
egan thrust out his shovel and saved himself
he reached out with one long arm and grasped fisher jusf as the man was about to fall against the hot metal
the ship rolled back and the stokers made a dash for the ladder
the trimmers darted from the bunkers and in a mad fighting group they tried to force their way to the only escape heart was pounding rapidly
for a moment he almost joined the rush
then he saw a stream of dirty water trickle through a crack in the bulkhead
he thought of the boilers that would explode if the water reached them
with a leap he reached the frightened men at the foot of the ladder
he flung them aside and stood with his back to the only escape from the pit
get back he shouted
get back an pull your fires
they pushed toward him
fisher made a leap for the ladder
egan struck him in mid air with his powerful fist
he crumpled up and sprawled out on the floor
the others crowded forward terror showing in their eyes
egan swung his arms like flails battering their flesh as they advanced
in their fear they made no effort to return his blows
they halted staring wideeyed at the demon in front of them
he advanced a step
pull them fires he bellowed shaking his huge fists in the air
pull em damn you pull em
keeping a wary eye on every man before him egan reached for his longhandled rake
he pushed the unconscious fisher aside with his foot
for a moment the others watched him sheeplike
one started suddenly for the ladder
egan stepped back and struck him
the man staggered his mouth bleeding
he looked at egan for an instant
then he turned and opened the furnace doors
the others did the same
the burning coals tumbled from the grates and hissed into the water that washed about the floor
it grew deeper forward
egan paused for a moment to haul the still unconscious fisher onto a pile of coal 
the fires were ptilled and still the men hesitated
steam was filling the dingy place
the water continued to rise
fumes from the coals on the floor all but strangled the men
break the watergages roared egan
groping in the darkening pit the men reached for shovels and rakes
they broke the glass gages
steam and scalding water poured into the place
now beat it shouted egan
the men swarmed rapidly up the ladder
egan waited until they disappeared in the steam
the water had risen to his knees
he strode through it to the pile of coal on which lay fisher moaning now amid the choking fumes and steam
egan picked him up
the electric lights suddenly went out
the inrush of water had lessened but the steam was awful
egan gasped for air and splashed through the blackness
he groped for the ladder in the dark
for a moment he could not find it
a terrible fear gripped him
then his outstretched hand grasped a rung
with fisher on his shoulder he started to climb
he tried to hold his breath against the gases and the steam
he reached a landing gasping and fell against another ladder
this he clutched and climbed again
sunlight streamed through a companionway
wearily he walked out onto the listed deck and let fisher slip gently from his shoulder
he saw a british destroyer standing by its thin bow twisted
she rammed em said some one beside him where they went down
egan looked and saw a little distance off a large uneven stain upon the water
it was oil
rapidly it grew larger and from beneath it a steady stream of bubbles wobbled slowly to the surface and broke
egan leaned against the rail and with his minds eye saw a ghastly struggle against violent death far down beneath the quiet water where the crushed submarine was sending up its dying gasps with each bubble that broke on the surface
how much waters in the hold demanded the captain of no one in particular
not very much sir answered egan in a funny little voice
and the fires are pulled
i donot believe well sink sir
he leaned weakly against the rail
he heard some one tell the captain of the fight in the stokehole
he listened and a tired smile crept over his face
well he muttered to himself i showed em but my gawd i was scared
a on a bounding pullman car that like a vision from afar in matchless beauty tress of gold and eyes to turn the arctic cold to tropic shimmer with their glance and ways suggesting song and dance she dawned and held me neath a spell no words can adequately tell but oh good lord
when evening fell my how she snored the cries of indians lifting scalps
the avalanches of the alps
the roar of cannon and of shot
the echoes of some mammoth grot
the scream of seagulls in their flight
the song of treetoads in the night
the oompah of the big bassoon
the honk of some impending loon all got aboard and swelled the tune that phyllis snored
mozart and verdi both were there and hints of wagner filled the air and every dissonance in life was added to the nasal strife that permeated near and far each nook and cranny of the car and made me feel as if i trod some encrimsoned sod where nations warred and shod as on she snored
oh maxim great or edison it matters not to me which one wilt thou not take this chance in mind and for the good of all mankind some day from out thy genius rare devise an instrument with care a sort of nasal silencer to still the tumult and the whir that wholly floored my heart when lovely phyllis snored
john kendrick bangs a oar lenivers carew people all around here are keyed up to quite a pitch of excitement
george eastman had just come back from the quaint little general store of the tropical seaside town bearing a can of petrol for a roadcar in which he and his wife were touring the french island colony all over the homecoming of a famous criminal and outlaw a man named victor berard continued eastman as he prepared to feed the volatile fluid to the hungry machine
he has been doing a tenyear term in the penal colony of new caledonia and is such a desperate character that his return to the islands fills the natives with a dread which they seem to find almost delightful
berard it seems is singularly savage and ferocious and has the most amazing courage a deadshot with rifle and pistol and a terrible artist with the knife
these people are absolutely ecstatic over the prospect of being slaughtered in their houses as soon as he returns to resume his depredations
i could hardly persuade them to sell me the petrol there was such a buzz of gossip in the store better put our car on the first ship thats leaving and get away from here before the terror begins said louise eastman with a nervous little laugh
i donot think care for the tropical variety of robin hood
i fancy that victor berard is a sort of island tradition sniffed her husband with a shrug
these emotional people cherish their bad men you know and paint them and their escapades in vivid colors worry about it the return of berard will add another note of romance to the tales we shall hear
the sublime extravagance of going halfway round the world by motor will come near enough to ruining us george said his wife without having a distinguished bandit capture and hold us for ransom
i am already disappointed in ouf distinguished bandit chuckled eastman
he would have had something more than ten years at hard labor if he had done anything splendidly devilish afraid that sober analysis will narrow his depredations down to sheep stealing or something sordid like that
we may as well forget him and go about our business
i managed to extract a few bits of in515 formation there at the store in spite of the breathless chatter about the bandit a tiny primitive but highly respectable inn about halfway down the south shore of the island and it will apparently do very well for our dinner and nights lodging
the innkeepers wife speaks and cooks in french spanish and english and the man himself sells supplies for motorcars in at least two languages
with a pleasant prospect of a savory meal and decent lodging on the shore of a lately savage island they motored along the sandy beach road glistening with shells of pearl and amber and opal hues and lapped soothingly by the gentle sapphire sea
in place of the cawing crows of the travelers home cornfields green and scarlet parrots screamed in the tops of the coconutpalms and the small animals that scrambled among the branches were monkeys not squirrels
proceeding at a leisurely speed to miss nothing of the novel scenery they came toward sundown to the inn that had been described
it was a mere cottage of coral slabs and palm thatch but clean and pleasantly harmonious with the landscape
in the driveway that led to the house a vagrant nail perhaps one of many pierced the shoe and tube of a front tire and the loud pop of the blowout brought monsieur tournier forth with suspicious alacrity and eager offers of a new tube and skilful patching of the shoe
it was evident eastman whispered to his wife that the traditional thrift of the french peasant was not affected by the languor of the tropical trade winds
it was clearly necessary however for the host to keep an eye to the main chanceeven to the sprinkling of the road with nails for it was the offseason for tourists and the four guestrooms of the inn were vacant when the americans arrived
we heard in the town of the sensational return of your island hero and villain victor berard eastman remarked to mme
tournier as she served the guests with a delectable combination of herbs and sea food and a handsomely turned omelet
ma joi yes it is terrible monsieur exclaimed the woman with an elaborate shudder
ten years you see we have had peace without that apache he should more better have been sent to the galleys for life i think
now he comes again is he really so horrible
mrs eastman inquired
or do the people fear for their chickenroosts and gardens
mme
tournier sighed profoundly
helas she wailed
if victor berard desired a chicken it is not that he would visit the chickencoop he would come to my door and order that the chicken should be cooked for him aux champignons sauce piquante
no madame it is no joke
victor berard is a terrible fellow
he desires some money
does he rob a man of his purse
no he goes to the town and demands the money of a hundred men he would fear a thousand no more
in the street full of people victor berard speaks and all the men they stop and grow pale
ah he is the devil
when victor berard shoot the pistol supplemented tournier standing by his wife always a man die the bullet is in his heart
when he flash the knife already a man lie dead in blood but when some man he shoot victor berard poof
berard he is not dead he shake himself like the bull or the lion he is all right
ten years at hard labor will have sobered him a bit perhaps suggested eastman
nevair declared the frenchman with grim conviction
does the tiger grow tame in the cage monsieur
victor berard he will now seek his revenge upon the whole world
he will demand much money from us all and we must pay or die
but you have police service here in the islands monsieur exclaimed mrs eastman
the innkeeper shut one eye mysteriously and put his tongue in his cheek
victor berard have many friends madame he said pointedly
it was an officer of the police who was killed that victor had to go away to prison but it was for ten years only because the officer had fired his pistol first
many men had died before but always it was that victor fired his shot in selfdefense you see
some of his good friends were very large men in the colony and that makes the difference
the evening meal was finished with sweety pancakes cheese and coffee and after that the guests sat in the large general room and were regaled by their hosts with marvelous tales of the desperate escapades and achievements of the celebrated outlaw
a little later the innkeeper excused himself to set about the repairing of the tires against the earlymorning departure of the guests and mme
toumier took upon herself the burden of the entertainment
i adore stories of adventure mme
tournier said mrs eastman but i donot know how well i shall sleep tonight
i hope that your desperados ship will not arrive until we are well away from the islands
ah but it was to arrive in port today the woman assured her unfeelingly
victor berard he may be already engaged in evil adventures
then for mercys sake let us talk of the scenery and other pleasant things for the rest of the evening begged the lady affecting an air of terror
a man was hpard walking along the hard shell road
hola he cried loudly halting before the inn and tournier hurried out to meet him
bon soir et mme
tournier thundered the stranger
the innkeeper fell back a pace and stared through the starlit gloom
victor berard he almost yelled in mingled consternation and surprise
mme
tournier with even less restraint emitted a shriek
the two americans sat breathless with amazement and a vague sort of expectancy as the celebrated outlaw swaggered into the room
the welcome you give me old friends said the returned convict harshly is noisy even if it lacks warmth
cofne show some joy at my return
bring me at once a bottle of that beaujolais of eighteenninetysix friend toumier
he threw himself luxuriously into a chair near the american visitors then peered at the latter curiously and waved them a bluff greeting
distinguished travelers from europe or america i see he exclaimed boldly
iam honored by such company
tournier the visitors will join me in three bottles of the beaujolais
a thousand thanks monsieur exclaimed george eastman but madame and i have finished our dinner and we shall soon retire to rest after a day of fatigue am victor berard the man announced belligerently
you know
when i offer entertainment it is not refused monsieur
we will wait to take just one glass of the wine with berard said mrs eastman in a conciliatory but rather tremulous voice adame is as gracious as she is beautiful exclaimed the outlaw with an insolent grin
he turned and peered sharply at the innkeeper as the latter obediently brought in the bottles of wine
friend tournier he said i have returned to my beloved islands with empty pockets
i am unhappily forced to trouble you for assistance at once
i need twenty five thousand francs
tournier deposited the bottles on the table with a thud and began to tremble with an ague of terror
have mercy berard he cried brokenly
you should know well that i have not a quarter of so much money in all the world and that to give you even a thousand francs would ruin me mme
tournier threw her apron over her head and burst into dismal wails rocking her body backward and forward and wringing her hands
i shall quickly learn for myself how much you have tournier declared the bandit
you know how gently i deal with liars tournier whimpered and his wife sprang to her feet and howled incoherently for mercy
i am not easily moved by a womans tears mme
tournier said berard impatiently much less when they are shed in cloudbursts to the accompaniment of such devilish howling
be quiet now or your sniveling husband shall be made to gag you
by all the saints berard cried the innkeeper brokenly am speaking to you with truth and honesty
would you then ruin a poor dog who has worked so hard for the little he has
we shall see how far the poor dog shall be ruined muttered the outlaw settling back comfortably in his chair
it occurs to me friends that travelers from distant lands must be well furnished with money
come now we shall see that my desperate need has already touched the generous hearts of this lovely lady and her gallant husband
they will come to your relief tournier
may it not be that in their liberality they will endow me with ah not a mere twentyfive thousand but with fifty thousand francs
it will be beautiful sublime
yes yes that is an end to all my pressing problems of the moment
i fear that you jest rather broadly monsieur eastman said quietly
i am not unwilling to help a fellow traveler on his way with a few francs from my pocket but my wife and i are spending even more than we can well afford on our travels and we are not wealthy persons by any means
americans are protected by their government at home you know from such dangers as capture for ransom and blackmail
any unpleasantness you might be rash enough to cause us would quickly grow into an international affair
that would mean too much publicity for you you see and you would hardly get off with ten years in new caledonia
you are a man of evident intelligence berard and i think i make myself clear
the outlaw sprawled over the table and leered at the american
fifty thousand francs he said with emphasis upon each word
the money must be paid at once or i shall lose patience
let us then have no more foolish talk
if it is not paid
eastman queried meeting the mans ugly glance unflinchingly
berard took a sip of wine then languidly drew from his pocket a huge navy revolver which he placed beside him on the table with elaborate care
why then he said at last if the money is not paid the affair will become melancholy tragic
the lovely madame will suddenly become a lovely widow and i shall have the honor of being her escort upon her travels
it is too simple to need more explanation monsieur
look here a note of deep concern sounded in voice as he saw his wifes face blanch i refuse to take this outrageous affair seriously
you are not a fool you must know what a row you would kick up by making any trouble for us
the world is too small for such villainy as you suggest berard
as a matter of fact if the lives of both myself and my wife were actually at stake we could not in any way raise such a sum as fifty thousand francs particularly in this part of the earth
make me an offer drawled berard with the suavity of a tradesman
great heavens not haggling with you cried eastman angrily havenot the slightest thought of being in danger from you and i wouldnot give you a sou an impudent swashbuckler youve played upon the ignorant fears of the natives here and youve got an exaggerated idea of your importance
i donot care a snap of the fingers for you or for your threats
come lou he added to his trembling wife well go to our room and tomorrow see the proper authorities about the outrageous actions of this bully
have a care monsieur spoke up the innkeeper in a shaking voice
believe me you do not know half the evil that berard is capable of
you are a braver man than monsieur but you will pay a great price for your defiance
i speak as a friend
victor berard took the big revolver from the table and his thick stubby forefinger crooked indolently around the trigger
you talk like an american and a fool he said to eastman harshly
do not try to leave the room
if you reach the door monsieur it will be as a dead man stretched across the threshold
your wife will then have the choice of going with me or of dying i do not permit women to worry me
i will have money tonight or you cannot live until the morning
you are weaving a terrible net around yourself berard declared eastman tensely and his face had grown as white as that of his wife
you can gain nothing from this folly but a return to prison
with my travelers letter of credit and all the credentials that i have i could not raise more than five thousand francs at the american consuls office
and even so i would not give you the smallest part of that
now think well of what you are doing
go to the american consul now ordered the outlaw and bring me the five thousand francs
i will take that and we shall see what will come later
your wife will remain here and i shall wait two hours for you to make the journey in your motor
yes i will be gracious i will take the five thousand francs
i believe you are insane said eastman
do you think that if i went to the consuls office i would not return directly with police with french marines with all the authority that i could get back of me
your frank assurance is ridiculous
not at all monsieur replied the outlaw blandly
i am not a child
of a certainty you could get the police a company of marines if you wished
but it would be a sorrow for you monsieur to find your beautiful wife with her throat cut when you arrived with your police
is it not so
while you are gone madame will sit here and my pistol will point at her heart
when you return to this room i shall know instantly whether madame is to live or to die
i can shoot very quickly monsieur
ha ha
you see it now he went on chuckling
myself i take no chances
with a man alone it would be different but with the lovely lady as a forfeit i have no fears
now go
mrs eastman spoke suddenly in a despairing wail
give him all we have george she said
the man is a savage
how can we expect reason or mercy from him
madame is endowed with brains as well as beauty exclaimed the outlaw
it would be a thousand pities to spoil such beauty or to spill such excellent brains
do not delay monsieur
george eastman stood with clenched hands his face working convulsively
you are the first man i have ever wanted to kill he declared
the outlaw shrugged his shoulders
myself i have no fierce emotions like that he said virtuously
i should like to avoid killing you monsieur
no it would not be pleasant to kill either you or madame
eastman looked at his wife long and earnestly
his eyes blazed with hot anger and resentment and he longed to attack the desperado and take his chances but the piteous hopeless face of the frail woman unnerved him
well then he said suddenly with a sigh of bitter dejection go
but i warn you berard that if i give you the money it will not be an end of the affair
get the money and make haste muttered the outlaw grinning contentedly
it is terrible eastman that such a crime should be committed in my house moaned tournier but you are wise to yield before there is bloodshed
we know this man and he has no mercy
you see what my dear friends say of me exclaimed the outlaw happily
the american ignoring the brute and his gun went to his wife and took her in his arms
he whispered encouragement of a sort to her and begged her to be brave and patient in the ordeal while he went to the town and talked with the united states consul
it might be he told her boldly that a way would be found to circumvent the scoundrel without risking danger or disaster am a quick shot and a sure one warned berard
be sure that i will keep my word
eastman embraced his wife tenderly then sprang away from her and walked to the door
i shall be back in an hour if it is possible he said quietly
if the hour stretches out too far said berard i shall take madame in my arms and console her
i find myself already growing foolish with tender emotions
take care that i donot kill you cried eastman and stepped forth resolutely into the night
without help from tournier he got his car from the shed at the rear of the inn made certain that the engine and the tires were in working order and then started at high speed for the distant town his heart beating faster than the valves of the motor
it was late in the evening and the consul might be hard to find
what then
and if he was in his office could he cash the letters of credit without infinite coming and going and hours of delay
with the money secured and paid to the bandit what would the travelers do then without means and so many thousand miles from home
thus his mind ran on in a turmoil of apprehension and excitement and he drove the motorcar over the hard white road at prodigious speed
suddenly the throbbing rataplan of the engine stopped and the car coasted for a thousand yards under the impetus of its speed then slowed down and stopped
eastman sprang out and threw open the hood in a frenzy of anxiety
there was a tense moment of inspection then the man cried out and shouted at the car as though it were a living creature
it might run again after an hour or two of laborious tinkering but in the present emergency it would not move for any man
he shrieked madly at the thing to have mercy on him and rally to his need but the machinery remained stolidly inert with a sort of grim fatality
he heard all at once far off the faint sound of wheels and a drumming of hoofs and he cried out in wild expectancy
unable to wait he ran swiftly down the road to meet the approaching vehicle and when he was panting for breath and almost exhausted he came upon a twowheeled native cart pony drawn and occupied by a single man
he tried english words upon the wayfarer and there was an encouraging response
turn your cart around and take me to the town and make your price what you will he gasped as soon as he could breathe
but monsieur it is very late and my own destination is far off the driver protested courteously
eastman explained frantically that he was the victim of a treacherous motor and that he must get to the town
you will do well to wait until morning it is now so late advised the stranger
there is a good inn some distance along the road and i will take you there
but i came from that accursed place just now cried the american tell you sir it is a matter of life and death and you must take me to the town
ah some person is very ill murmured the driver
then that is different
but there is an english doctor here on the road i will take you to his house
must i tell you everything groaned eastman beside himself
i have to see the united states consul i have to get money at once money to save the life of my wife
is that enough for your curiosity
monsieur is excited observed the other with maddening ease of manner
but you give me a mystery to puzzle over my friend
it is very strange that madame your wife her life may be saved by money
the situation is peculiar
eastman swore at the man he assailed him with frightful epithets and dire threats but scarcely disturbed his equanimity
but if you must have the whole story why have it then he stormed
i intend that the world shall have it tomorrow so whats the difference
i my poor wife and are the victims of your precious islands hero victor berard ah exclaimed the man blandly
continue monsieur if you please
the beast returned from ten years imprisonment today as you doubtless know eastman hurried on and he selected us as the first victims of his new career of crime
my wife is half dead with fright
he holds her prisoner at the inn ready to kill her if i do not bring the money do you see
if i summon the police he will kill her and if i fail to get the money he may kill us both
now will you take me to the house of the consul
the driver appeared vastly interested but scarcely perturbed
monsieur has had no previous rience with bandits he exclaimed
but that is not strange at this day they are not so common
eh bien monsieur you will permit me to help you as a friend
be good enough to get up here beside me
we will drive to the inn
the devil we will cried eastman aghast
man alive that will do no good it may be fatal
have the goodness to follow my advice persisted the stranger
i will talk to this victor berard and show him clearly the folly of his actions
he will listen to me i promise you on my oath monsieur
he will shoot you dead declared the american
the man shrugged his shoulders and threw back the front of his jacket exposing to view the butt of a revolver that hung in a holster at his waist
we shall meet on even terms monsieur he said quietly
vaguely bewildered and exhausted by his prolonged frenzy eastman mounted to the seat of the cart reluctantly
he started a fresh series of objections to the mans proposals but the native cut him short by starting the pony abruptly and whipping it into a wild run flinging the cart sickeningly from one side of the road to the other
eastman clung to the sides and kept his seat with difficulty and the jolting of the vehicle precluded further argument
as they drew near the inn the driver pulled the pony to an easy trot but he made no further attempt to diminish the sounds of their approach
be good enough to get down here monsieur he said presently that i may appear to be alone if i am observed
when i reach the door and enter you may follow quickly
eastman dropped to the ground a hundred yards from the house in deep shadow and waited
he was dumbly obedient now for there was a certain authority in the mans speech and actions which reassured him and gave him something like hope
he watched his mysterious friend as he drove up to the inn and got down from the cart
he saw him casually tie the horse to a post and saunter up to the door then he followed directions and scurried forward keeping in the shadows
when he reached die door it was open and there were loud voices sounding from the room
in a flash he saw his friend engaged with the terrible victor berard and he darted into the room and seized his sobbing wife in his arms
the cartdriver held the outlaw by the collar of his shirt with one hand and with the other hand he dealt him prodigious blows across the face
crimson welts appeared where the hand rose and fell and between howls of agony the famous outlaw shrieked that his nose was broken
this is the beginning announced the stranger desisting for a moment
also it is a punishment too mild
attend to what i say
you have frightened a lady to distraction you have disturbed a gentleman traveling in a strange land and you have masqueraded as a better man
what punishment is ap propriate then
you mean that this fellow is not victor berard cried out eastman bewildered and incredulous
the stranger stepped back struck an attitude and pointed at the moaning outlaw derisively
victor berard he said dramatically has been described as a handsome man
would any one but the unfortunate mother of this goat call him handsome
victor enemies call him brave he went on oratorically
could any one mistake this whimpering booby for a brave man
victor berard was outlawed and sent into exile but when did he prey upon travelers and upon frail women
victor berard believe me might throw the palace of a prince into panic but he would not seek adventure in the parlor of an inn
eastman utterly aghast glanced curiously at toumier and his wife and was further puzzled
the keepers of the inn were apparently quite as terrified as they had been before their faces were drawn and of the color of yellowed ivory
they shrank back together close to the wall and stared at the stranger in a sort of fascination
now resumed the person of mysterious authority we shall get this canaille out of our atmosphere and he grasped the culprit again by the collar and flung him upon the floor
mercy
have mercy monsieur pleaded the wretch who had lately swaggered so recklessly
i will spare your life if i do not meet you again said the stranger
a ship leaves the island tomorrow see to it that your departure is simultaneous with hers
this island is my home i do not wish that travelers should find such rats as you upon it
the cringing clown whimpering softly crept furtively toward the open door
he gained the threshold and rose to something nearer a standing posture and then the stranger took a long stride after him and administered the worlds record kick propelling him like a rocket through the darkness
at the same moment the administrator of picturesque justice whipped the revolver from his belt and fired a fusillade of shots into the air at random
they heard the terrified clown running on the road a moment later running perhaps as athletes sometimes dream of running
now you and mme
toumier thundered the stranger turning suddenly upon the innkeepers with a face dark with wrath
but why began eastman
these old foxes also must leave my island said the stranger
the rat who masqueraded as a man is their precious son and he was but playing out their shrewd scheme to wring money from credulous travelers
have pity monsieur wailed the woman
we shall starve we have nothing if we leave here out with you commanded the avenger
see that you take the ship tomorrow you shall walk to the town
monsieur and madame the american travelers shall sleep in peace and i will keep the inn
you have indeed saved us from a ridiculous but a horrible adventure monsieur said george eastman stepping forward with outstretched hand
my wife and i will never be able to express our gratitude
whom have we the honor the stranger interrupted him with an elaborate bow of studied grace
the honor is mine monsieur and madame to be your humble servant victor berard he said
prince sat on his carved throne and wine from gold he quaffed the seer in drear dull monotone read of his sagacraft the bard stood near musing alone watching the breezes waft the roseleaves through the window on the fool who sang and laughed to you prince the power of force almost divine of right of might and law of sword arid rule of fear malign that wait but for your spoken word nor need another sign

raymond ashley tke j admit that a rule of the argosy is transgressed in the opening paragraph of the july complete novel
the story does not start off with a bang this in spite of the fact that it leads our fourth of july number
nevertheless there is a bang and it comes ahead of the first paragraph
you get it in the title author of those eyes from kama why there was a murder on pearl street etc and you get it good and plenty in the story itself which is all about a distinguished young novelist seeking a change from work and a persistent woman who lands him in the midst of happenings beside which wars wild alarms are almost tame
sensational rest in short moves with the rapidity of a machine gun leaving the reader fairly breathless at the finish
for those of you who like tales the july number will provide in which a trade between rich and poor leads to extraordinary complications
the empress of the paper hoops by olin lyman is a fourth of july yarn with a circusy flavor and what happens when patriotism runs counter to the call of love is set forth in there are many other rarely attractive features in the july argosy but theres a big mail from my readers awaiting attention so now step aside myself and let you talk to one another
i wonder if you all arenot as pleased as i am when answers are made to my request to be told how each one came to know the argosy
drop me a line about this
meanwhile heres a new fashion in which a fellow became acquainted with a publication that was destined to give him a great deal of pleasure
kingman arizona
i have just laid down the march argosy and wish to say that the february and march issues have been exceptionally enjoyed
fourforty at the fort penn was a good story which i believe i enjoyed more than sam and that is saying a great deal
most magazines improve gradually but the argosy seems to come forward by leaps and bounds
i note that you request in the logbook that we relate what it was that first attracted us to the argosy
in my case it was more of a case of sympathy than anything else
in the spring of i was stranded in a small town in tennessee and happening to pass a newsstand and noting the arcosy story up against it i felt that if the fellow who wrote that story had any solution for the problem that could be applied to my case i was strong for him
since i have missed but few numbers of the argosy this being due to the newsstands running out of it before i got around
i am moving most of the time and have to depend upon the newsstands instead of a regular subscription
in all the country there is not a bunch of authors that hand out as much pleasure as the argosy writers and i have no criticism to make on any of them
edwards
here you are readers a letter that opens the way for a flow of opinions from you on more than one topic
after all not the length but the strength of a story is the thing and i do not believe in hampering the author by rules and regulations when genius burns
a good idea this of mr as to what story each reader liked best waiting to hear from you
andalusia alabama
i enclose herewith one dollar for my renewal
the argosy is the best ever and only one thing would cause me to quit reading it and that would be to make it a weekly publication instead of monthly
i do not have time to read a weekly magazine for i recently tried that on the allstory weekly beginning with the opening chapters of the matrimaniac
this story was good and i read it all but havenot had time to read the other stories in the copies that i bought
i want to entreat you to quit drawing the serials out so long
please change your mode of printing them back to the old style of three instalments each divided into three parts
three serials each month with one going out and a new one coming in in each issue is in my estimation a much better way than the present method
i realize that the serials hold subscribers but the suggestion i have offered will not interfere with this and will give the readers the entire serial while the first part is still fresh in their memory
the present method of drawing a serial out from five to seven months is objectionable because when the last is reached the first is too far away and is not clearly remembered
please take a vote on this and see if the majority of your readers do not prefer serials in three instalments
i would like to know through the logbook just what story each reader liked best
that is just what story fitted in and reminded them of some part of their life
i liked the third act better than any other for the reason that it almost completely followed a certain chapter of my life
hoping that you donot forget to contract the serials am padgett
the magic of circulationbuilding is explained in the simple act related in the subjoined letter
somebody likes a certain story in the argosy hands it to a friend to read and presto another unit is added to the magazines clientele
which story in the present issue say do any of you consider worth recommending to a friend
syracuse new york
please find enclosed one dollar to pay for my renewal to the argosy which i have read for a long time
the first argosy i remember reading had a trolley tangle in it and a friend considered the story so good that the book was handed to me and i at once became an admirer of the argosy
i always liked hawkins but i will abide by the decision of the majority and forget him
in regard to authors i never notice an authors name the story that counts with me not the author
hoping that this escapes the scrapheap i am harold gutterson
i especially commend the subjoined to those readers who want us to abolish serials
they are the anchor to windward that steadies circulation
without serials mr graham would very likely have waited for the march number when he found he was too late for february
ukiah california
enclosed find ten cents worth of stamps to pay for the february argosy
i was too late to get it from the town near which i live
i think the argosy is about the best magazine i have read
i have not subscribed for it yet but i intend to later
the motive daring the danger zone and the gilded trap are very good stories and as they are continued in the february arcosy is why i am so anxious to get it
diahl graham
mr rich runs squarely counter to the preferences of mr padgett in the matter of the length of serials
november was the second issue of the present type of argosythat is to say all fiction
seattle washington
i have just finished reading at the fort penn by perley poore sheehan in the march number of the argosy and i must say i think it is a crackerjack
i have read a number of novels by the same author including the star of adventure and phyllis ot fountain square all good every one but fourforty at the fort penn beats them all
i call it his masterpiece
i was thinking a few days ago while reading the argosy how long it had been since i first began to read it
my mind went back a good many years when i was a sailor on the atlantic coast
i think it was in the summer of that i first saw and read the little weekly called the golden argosy and i think it was in november that i read the argosy as a monthly
i was in portland maine at the time and some sailor brought it aboard my ship along with other reading matter
sailors as a rule are very fond of reading
i read it then and i have continued to read it ever since and it grows better all the time
i like your complete novels very well but my preference is for a long serial story the longer it is the better it suits me
i enjoy reading the logbook
the different opinions given by the various readers are very interesting
i read the letters of the logbook first of all then the continued stories next the complete novel winding up with the short stories
for the small sum of ten cents you are certainly giving your army of readers a great treat in publishing a magazine up to the standard of highpriced publications
i read all kinds of magazines also fiction from the public library but i get more satisfaction out of a copy of the argosy than from any of them
rich
now for the man who dislikes serials but in this case he has nullified his objection by subscribing so that there is no danger of his missing a number
he makes the argosy a bit older than it is by harking back to the seventies
the first number was dated december the volumes were at that time yearly ones
with the increased number of pages they were shifted to halfyearly and when still more pages were added to each monthly issue to three a year as at present in order to obviate books too bulky for easy handling
etna wyoming
please find enclosed two dollars for which please renew my subscription for one year to the arcosy and also please send the railroad magazine
i like both of these magazines
the only objection i can find to the argosy is too many serials
i would be better pleased if there were no serials at all for if you miss a copy especially if it is in the completion of a story it is very annoying and out in this wild country seventy miles or more from a railroad you canot step over to a newsstand and buy your missing copy
how any one can like serials better than complete novels i canot imagine as i canot remember what a serial is about from one month to the next
but in my estimation the argosy is the best fiction magazine published
i have taken it now about ten years i believe and i have read stray copies of it since it was the golden argosy back in the seventies in old missouri
i have never subscribed to the railroad magazine but have read a good many stray copies of it
edward lever
a many thanks to my georgia friend for telling so much in so few words
you will note that he mentions what he considered the best novels his favorite short stories and the authors that have appealed to him the most strongly
these are expressions of opinion very helpful to an editor and matter which i am sure you all enjoy reading in the way of comparing with your own ideas
bellton georgia
would you allow a fellows letter to be printed in the logbook i have no kicks on the argosy at all
i like all your stories
i think in the blue limousine southwest of the law the green lamp the trap line runners the border of blades and the great white wastes in the april issue best
but in fact i like them all
my favorite short stories that have appeared in the argosy lately are and she took me in and ranch secret
my favorite authors are lenivers carew seward hopkins norcross forbes rex parson katharine eggleston george cain and bedfordjones
i am not much on the serials
i will not miss a copy of the argosy as long as it is as good as it is now
always on the good side of the argosy i remain james quillian
tell me readers how many of you hail with joy the sight of the contents page when it proclaims that there are tfin short stories in the number in place say of five or six
that means of course that either the complete novel is shorter or that there are not such long instalments of the serials
the more short stories of course the more variety but how many of you stop to think about this i wonder
to comply with mr suggestion would limit the shorts very decidedly
housatonic massachusetts
enclosed please find check for a years subscription to the argosy which kindly mail to my address beginning with the april number
heretofore i have bought it from the newsstands but it comes at irregular dates and i thought i would try a years subscription and see if it did not come on the date expected
i have not missed a copy in fifteen or eighteen years and find no other magazine that anywhere near interests me as does the good old argosy
i hope to read it for many more years
i must say however that i am greatly disappointed to have you go back to the serials
before you cut them out i did not realize what an improvement it could be but after having every number complete i enjoyed the reading so much more that now i am holding everything back until it is completed and it sometimes makes tiresome waiting
hoping you may some time cut them down to at the most two or three part stories i am ever and sincerely yours torrey
fresh light on the manner in which argosy readers are made
in view of what he says i suppose i must count mr edgerly as voting for fewer short stories
blue mound kansas
a neighbor who was moving away gave me several argosys for the latter months of the year i read them and became a permanent reader with the january number of and during these nearly seventeen years i have never missed a number nor a story and in all these years i have never found a poor story in the argosy except the hawkins stuff
that was certainly rotten
i think that the booklength stories are infinitely better than the short ones and i wish there were more of them
i save the magazines until i have all of a serial story then i read it as i would a book in one or two evenings
that way is far more satisfactory to me
i take seven other magazines but none fills the place that the argosy does for good clean interesting fiction
i find very many interesting letters in the logbook and you may publish this if you wish
edgerly an early response to my request in the april log for readers to tell me what they considered the best story they had read in the argosy
the land of the central sun by park winthrop is not out in book form
quincy illinois
i just purchased the argosy for april and turned to the back pages to the logbook as i have always done since the logbook has been printed
i saw a letter from telling of the best short story in the argosy
the best story i ever read in the argosy was a serial which began in the july number of it was the land of the central sun and that story has kept me buying the argosy every month since and i do not intend to miss one as long as i live and i know that my son and daughter will do likewise
i know full well my old friend will want to know the best short story i have read in the argosy
now my kind friend i have no choice
they are all good good good
will you please let me know if the land of the central sun is published in book form and where i can purchase it morrow
this is fine having my readers answer so promptly the questions i ask
here is another reply to my desire to know the best short story
mr peck will be delighted to hear that the complete novel for august will be by seward hopkins
lake providence louisiana
i am a regular bookworm and have been a regular reader of the argosy ever since it was first published
i have always thought that the complete novels and serials were the best as it gives the author a chance to deepen the plot and explain it in a more satisfactory manner
this donot prevent me from reading and enjoying the short stories
in your april number you ask what is the best short story
in my opinion a ranch secret by seward hopkins is about the best i ever read
if it had been written as a serial it could have filled one hundred pages or more of interesting reading and made the author famous
i hope yet to read a long story by the writer
i read nearly all the best magazines but i like the argosy best of all
peck a case of off again on again with the argosy
possibly i can arrange for a serial of england in the long ago
a new story of the north is now under way and i have in stock a fresh one by raymond spears
canterbury connecticut
i was reading the argosy in the year i think when the magazine was bound in yellow covers but the stories did not suit me
in my opinion they all seemed to be in the same vein so i did not buy it long
after a year or so my brother brought home a copy that he got from a neighbor
the complete novel was entitled waters of strife by bedfordjones and all of the stories were good and i have not missed a copy since
in the same issue was a serial story of england
give us some more stories by bedfordjones also a serial about england of the long ago i like western stories and stories of the north
give us a good western serial
keep the authors busy katharine eggleston ogden spears
i have no fault to find with the argosy
better than ever at ten cents per copy
edgar parkhurst
a the argosy is certainly making a great record with its novels
the january southwest of the law set the ball rolling with a perfect chorus of praise
february followed hard on its heels with an avalanche of good things said about the blue limousine and now at the fort penn in march is scoring heavily
the author of the man with the chest was rath
hazelwood pittsburgh pennsylvania
i have been a reader of the argosy for a number of vears and i want to sav it is the hest magazine i have read
just finished at the fort penn by perley poore sheehan
it was purely great
i think the author means the fort pitt hotel instead of fort penn
it is opposite pennsylvania station
the first copy of the argosy i read was the man with the chest i forget the authors name but it surely was a great tale
hoping this passes the wastebasket i remain arthur mason
a sprained ankle set this man to reading the argosy
how about somebody having been won to it by seeing an attractive coverpicture on the newsstand
are there any such
i pause for a reply
southworth washington
enclosed you will find one dollar for a years subscription to the argosy
you wanted to knowhow the readers got acquainted with the magazine
in august i was laid up with a sprained ankle
a friend loaned me two arcosys and that settled the business
have never missed a single number since
have paid from ten to twenty cents for it and would gladly pay the twenty cents again
i enjoy every one of your booklength novels also the serials
just finished fourforty at the fort penn
it certainly is grand
also just finished the serial the motive
this to my mind is the best i have read for a long time
the blue limousine was a crackerjack
have always bought at the newsstands but as i have now to go ten miles to get it will subscribe
if this goes in the logbook please use only initials
have no choice of your authors
they are all good
long live the argosy the best fiction magazine that is printed today

mr lease and other jackson fans will be glad to know that fred has come back

seattle washington
i have been reading the argosy for so long that i have lost track of the exact date of the first magazine though i well remember the story that started me as a steady reader
i found an old argosy in a cabin in lewistown montana and started reading it
the story was the king of arcadia
i do not remember the authors name but from that time till now i have not missed a single copy
i have no kick on any of the stories though some are better than others
the desert crucible the trap line runners gold grabbers waters of strife all three of the john solomon stories and the clutch of siberia
october are to my notion the best stories that you have published
of the authors i like bedfordjones zane grey perley poore sheehan william wallace cook stephen brandish and fred jackson but best of all zane grey
he knows his west as few authors know it
i am not writing this as a test to see if the logbook is a fake or not as i had one letter printed some three or four years ago and i am sure that if mine was printed the others are from readers of your wonderful magazine
a delighted reader lease
a i am very glad to give space to the following eulogy on the patriotic little tale that closed our april number
it appeared at a timely date and i assure mrs that i deeply appreciate her good words for it
washington district of columbia
much as i like the argosy the log is to me the most interesting but your last number april contains a gem by kenneth rossiter what he could do and is worthy of the vignette of the old soldier saving the flag from desecration by the vandals who would destroy it a picture which should be carried by every patriotic man in his pocket and be in the scrapbook of every woman who loves the flag and the nation
the dear old veteran saves the flag under which he had the honor to fight in the perils of the dear old soldier going through life so patient and silent and willing again to give his life for his country
the story is a pretty one and well told by the author
i never read one better and i congratulate him on its success
