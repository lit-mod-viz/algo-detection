by great source of wonder be not those that -PRON- see or those indeed -PRON- know but those which be hide from -PRON- and be go to be know only as -PRON- progress on -PRON- long and tortuous road to the future 
if -PRON- contemplate the world as -PRON- be let -PRON- say year ago in the day of the caveman this truth must beoome most apparent to -PRON- yet -PRON- be often overlook or not at all manmade work from the modern skyscraper down to the most intricate chronometer that -PRON- have today be existence year ago in -PRON- integral part 
all the raw material be there as -PRON- be today 
nothing have be add to the wealth of the earth during the last year with the possible exception of some fall meteorite 
yet humanity at that time be nothing more than a race of animal emerge from a long sojourn in savagery 
everything that spell -PRON- civilization today be hide from -PRON- ancestor 
-PRON- safe to presume that -PRON- will always be thus and that -PRON- who call -PRON- modern of today have hide from -PRON- just as many thing as -PRON- ancestor have hide from -PRON- year ago 
-PRON- be true that in the last year more thing have be reveal to the human race than in year precede this epoch but even now -PRON- have as yet not scratch the surface of the possibility of nature or come anywhere near the limit of -PRON- progress 
there be immeasurable treasure surround -PRON- treasure in power treasure in foodstuff and other treasure necessary for lifebut -PRON- do not use -PRON- because -PRON- do not know how to get at -PRON- 
as late as a hundred year ago people in england as well as pennsylvania be burn wood in the winter to keep warm because -PRON- have always do so yet -PRON- build -PRON- house right on top of coal vein which -PRON- assume to be only a form of rock 
-PRON- take humanity over year to arrive at the point where -PRON- burn this rock and find -PRON- would give -PRON- heat 
this of course sound ludicrous to -PRON- today yet -PRON- be just as foolish when -PRON- insist -PRON- must burn coal in order to make steam of -PRON- which in turn be use to run -PRON- turbine which turn dynamo which produce the current to light -PRON- electric lamp 
in this process -PRON- lose exactly of the available power and only of of the energy be turn into light the rest escape in heat and other loss 
untold source of power be lie right at -PRON- own door but as yet -PRON- be unaware of -PRON- 
if -PRON- have the key to unlock the secret of atomic power for instance every single pebble in -PRON- backyard could be turn into enough heat light and power to keep -PRON- house supply for year to come 
but of course -PRON- havenot get the key because as yet -PRON- be hide from -PRON- 
yet -PRON- need not go as far as atomic power 
there be probably and scientist have suspect this for many year jnany other source of power surround -PRON- which as yet have not be harness 
there be for instance gravitation there be the pressure of light there be the electric energy that come direct to -PRON- from the sun in addition to the radiant heat a vast source of power as yet only little understood 
-PRON- take generation of steady plodding to discover some of these hide source of power 
one for instance that probably will become a tremendous factor in the future the socalle cosmic ray be recently discover by professor milliken 
-PRON- know practically nothing about -PRON- as yet but from the little -PRON- have see -PRON- suspect -PRON- be a terrific power that some day will be tap to the benefit of humanity 
the source of energy create by the difference in temperature around -PRON- have never be tap 
only recently a frenchman propose a most unique plan whereby a tremendous amount of power can be take from the ocean through simply take advantage of a small variation of temperature exist between that of the sea level and that a little distance below the surface 
then there be the tremendous source of solar heat the tide wind and other which although -PRON- be know to -PRON- may just as well be hide away because wo have as yet not the sense to make use of -PRON- 
yet each of -PRON- offer enough power to supply all the need for the entire planet 
fabulous wealth will be make in the come generation by those who will tap some of these hide or unused source of power and add -PRON- to -PRON- natural resource without ever fear in the least to deplete the source 
coal and oil for instance will some day give out whereas the solar heat the tide radiant heat and other force will keep on give energy for literally million of year to come 
i make a machine which would enable -PRON- to look right through the wall of the colony house 
now could see the life live there and hear -PRON- too and obtain the harmony between sight and sound the latter part of april during a visit to new york i be entertain tae evening by mr and mrs hugo gernsback 
-PRON- have do -PRON- the honor of have -PRON- to dinner in -PRON- home instead of the more formal surrounding of one of the great metropolitan hotel 
after dinner the three of -PRON- discuss various phase of social life in new york 
i admit that the city have -PRON- charm but that personally i should not care to live amid the constant din and confusion 
mr gernsback laugh at -PRON- as -PRON- say but -PRON- should come to see -PRON- more frequently 
everytime -PRON- come -PRON- secure idea for several story admit that i reply 
for example large block of conversation in stenographer hand be obtain from -PRON- conversation 
at the same time -PRON- must admit that some of the idea in -PRON- story be original 
the hard thing be to get new idea 
just one absolutely original idea make a story possible 
-PRON- host ponder for a moment and then walk over to -PRON- library and pick up book 
here -PRON- be an idea for story 
this book be the white ant by maurice maeterlinck 
-PRON- tell about the termite and suggest that the conduct of the individual ant may be control by a central intelligence and that the mitary be one large a animal 
gernsback halfseriously then suggest that all life may be way and that human being may be control by a central intelligence 
-PRON- feel that this may count for the that individual in different part of the world often do the same thing at almost the same much of what -PRON- be in life and the great part of what -PRON- do be make possible by the previous effort of some worker who may have all unknowingly lay the foundation for -PRON- achievement 
-PRON- be therefore with due appreciation that this work of sciencefiction be dedicated to maurice maeterlinck author of the white ant david keller time 
for example -PRON- go on elisha gray and alexander graham bell work independently arrive simultaneously at the idea of the telephone and submit the invention to the patent office within an hour of each other 
darwin and charle buell announce from different part of the globe -PRON- conclusion regard natural selection at practically the same time 
let -PRON- read part of this book to -PRON- 
for fifteen minute -PRON- read to -PRON- while i sit in an easy chair with closed eye 
finally -PRON- say -PRON- take this book with -PRON- and read -PRON- 
there be a big story in -PRON- 
i give -PRON- one idea 
all -PRON- have to do be to work out the detail 
yes i reply that be but that be a good deal some time ready for the typewriter 
-PRON- be write at white heat and finish in less than two week 
mr gernsback be kind enough to say that -PRON- be -PRON- good science fiction story 
but -PRON- quite naturally believe that -PRON- could not have be write without -PRON- idea 
editor that way nfortunately true edi 
and i be conceite enough to feel that even with the idea -PRON- need -PRON- to write story 
dr keller infer that the editor could never have write the human termite even though -PRON- have the idea 
the editor cheerfully admit this 
as a matter of fact few author could have write such a marvelous story as dr keller have editor this at least be the way one story come to be write 
david keller book which inspire the human termite have just return from a residence of many year in africa 
there -PRON- have live the solitary life of one who be occupy in solve a certain mystery of life and can not be content with any other occupation or satisfied till a solution of the problem have be attain 
such man have make -PRON- civilization possible -PRON- be not good companion on account of -PRON- intense introversion but on the rare occasion when -PRON- can be induce to talk about -PRON- work -PRON- be always able to astonish -PRON- audience with -PRON- erudition and complete mastery of -PRON- life work 
such a man be souderman 
for some reason early in life -PRON- have be stimulate to entomological research 
for year -PRON- have follow in the footstep of forel charle janet lubbock wasmann and maeterlinck 
-PRON- have learn all that these master of insect life have to teach -PRON- but because -PRON- be bear of woman -PRON- be not satisfied with this knowledge 
there be too many gap in the knowledge of -PRON- teacher too many place where -PRON- say do not know -PRON- realize that -PRON- could not fill all of these gap unravel the twisted thread of all the mystery of insect life that have puzzle -PRON- but -PRON- do feel that life be go to be a failure to -PRON- and completely unsatisfactory unless -PRON- make at least one contribution to the knowledge of the insect world 
the work of forel and maeterlinck intrigue -PRON- but leave -PRON- restless unsatisfied and discontent 
-PRON- want to find one fact that be unknown to -PRON- solve one puzzle that -PRON- have be unable to fathom 
-PRON- be typical of the man that -PRON- make a calm and dispassionate survey of the entire world of insect before -PRON- decide on -PRON- life work 
this review of the unsolved question of the littleknown part of life form by the insect bring -PRON- face to face with the termite and -PRON- destructive power 
in the annal of entomology -PRON- read of the destruction of the french town of la rochelle by termite from san domingo which have come in the vegetable mould in the hold of sailing vessel 
every street be attack 
before the danger be realize most of the house fall down 
the archive and all the record be destroy 
the devastation only stop when the termite reach the canal of la verriere 
in a spanish warship be literally eat to piece by a swarm of termite diver while anchor in the harbor of ferro 
in these same minute insect destroy the battery and munition of the french fort in the antille and make the defence of those island against the english an impossibility 
souderman find that large portion of australia and ceylon be uninhabitable because the termite eat the crop faster than -PRON- could be grow 
europe be protect by -PRON- temperature be -PRON- a tropical land the termite may destroy even the great of the city of that land 
-PRON- have to live in a temperature range from to degree centigrade 
below degree -PRON- die 
the more souderman read about these tiny blind insect the more fascinate be be by the many startling peculiarity -PRON- possess 
-PRON- no longer feel the bee the wasp and the ant be the intellectual leader of the insect world but slowly come to realize that the termite possess a something resemble human reason which place -PRON- not on a level with man but perhaps in some way above -PRON- 
so -PRON- decide to devote the rest of -PRON- life to a study of the termite 
sever all relation with -PRON- european associate secure an income from one of the large research endowment fund -PRON- go to south africa to study the termite not by observe -PRON- but by actually live with -PRON- 
this be a form of scientific investigation that be rare but which never fail to repay for the year spend in -PRON- pursuit 
some day all the take pleasure in present what -PRON- be rr lieve to be dr keller great work so far 
that this story will cause a furore and endless discussion seem certain 
-PRON- embrace a tremendous subject and incidentally enter into realm that be as yet but little understand even by -PRON- foremost scientist 
but -PRON- may be sure that some of the great mystery that surround -PRON- and even permeate -PRON- very body will be solve during the next few hundred year 
for instance as maeterlinck ask in -PRON- book the white ant what intelligence govern -PRON- own body 
-PRON- cut -PRON- finger and the ignorant person will say that -PRON- start heal at once 
but the process of healing mean that the instant the breach be make in the skin innumerable thousand of minute white body call corpuscle immediately rush to the breach and start fight the germ that enter the opening while new cell be be build up immediately to close the breach 
neither the human intelligence nor the human will have anything to do with these process which go on at all time within the human body 
all -PRON- know be that some intelligence evidently direct these thing but who or what this intelligence be no one know 
whether -PRON- be -PRON- littleunderstood socalled soul or something else no owe know 
indeed -PRON- be not at all impossible that the member of the entire human race must be consider simply as separate cell of a great organism 
-PRON- have no will of -PRON- own but be fuse into a homogeneous body with nothing but intervene air to separate 
that this may be true could be illustrate in many way 
war for instance will quite often change an entire nation overnight as if by magic and also change lifetime habit and ideal of -PRON- people almost as quickly 
religion fanaticism and other passion be similar evidence of the transmission through an entire nation or nation in many instance of idea without visible communication between individual 
all these thing may be explain by purely logical natural reasoning without resort to the supernatural as indeed the author have point out in this memorable work 
-PRON- be certainly a work that will commend -PRON- to the earnest attention of every thinking question person question in the scientific world will be solve by such man as souderman train laborer in the world of the unknown who be willing to sacrifice everything to obtain an answer to one mystery of life 
something about souderman worker have be few 
the price that have to be pay be too great 
everything have to be abandon 
a lifetime have to be spend to attain one little fact 
and yet the man who do this feel that the attainment of one addition to the store of human knowledge be sufficient reward for all -PRON- sacrifice 
and -PRON- be 
suppose one man spend a life time with the cancer cell not merely study -PRON- but actually live with -PRON- 
-PRON- would think of nothing else during -PRON- wake hour and dream only of -PRON- during -PRON- sleep 
month by month and year by year -PRON- would become more intimate with this enemy of the middleaged 
to -PRON- the cancer cell would become a separate race of living creature a parasitic enemy of mankind 
-PRON- would learn -PRON- history -PRON- folklore -PRON- tradition 
the cancer race would slowly reward -PRON- effort by allow -PRON- a few glimpse of a separate intelligence comparable to that of the human specie 
time would pass and -PRON- may be that old age would come on and still the secret of prevention would remain a mystery 
as a last resort -PRON- would deliberately inoculate -PRON- with the cancer cell make of -PRON- own body a laboratory so that -PRON- could make a last final effort to gain an insight into the soul of the individual cell the group intelligence of the cancer mass 
other would consider -PRON- insane a recluse introvert by the study of year an unfortunate dying of the very disease -PRON- have spend year to study 
yet even on -PRON- death bed -PRON- may whisper the great truth which would make the human race free from this parasite that now kill one out of every four who reach the age of forty 
surely this man would die happy in the thought that -PRON- have contribute one fact that would make the life of -PRON- race happy 
that be the great sacrifice 
every generation produce one voluntary victim 
such a man be souderman 
-PRON- go to africa when -PRON- be -PRON- come back when -PRON- be during those year -PRON- love one in germany have die most of the scientist -PRON- have grow up with be solve the puzzle of another world 
sadden by the realization of the change in -PRON- social life still horrify at the final revelation of -PRON- african study -PRON- decide to go to new york and there place the result of these year of sacrifice in kindly hand before -PRON- death make -PRON- too late 
-PRON- be not satisfied with the definite knowledge -PRON- have secure in africa for -PRON- realize that -PRON- would be useless unless -PRON- make -PRON- available to the betterment of the human race 
for when the final truth have dawn upon -PRON- -PRON- have make -PRON- afraid 
fear be not necessarily an attribute of ignorance 
the great a man knowledge the more intense may be -PRON- fear not the blinding fear that show in the panic of the submerge masse but the keen appreciative intelligent foreseeing fear of the scientist who combine that emotion with an intense desire to prevent a threaten calamity 
and because of this intelligent fear mankind have check the black plague reduce the incident of yellow fever and make smallpox no longer a scourge that could kill one out of every three of the population in less than a year 
souderman know that -PRON- could not die till -PRON- communicate this fear and the fact behind -PRON- to a few scientist who could appreciate the terror of -PRON- 
the knowledge have to be the common property of a small group of man who would be willing to guard -PRON- a terrific secret through the generation till the time come for action 
then and then only could the antidote be use the mean of defense slowly perfect 
and perhaps unknown to the masse once again human life on this globe would be save through the sacrifice of many generation of unsung and unwept scientist 
the student of termite come to new york 
-PRON- then visit chicago and philadelphia 
-PRON- record -PRON- knowledge make -PRON- a welcome guest in the home of all those who worship at the foot of minerva the goddess of wisdom 
the german scientist talk little listen intently and observe much 
finally -PRON- find one man who have the peculiar mental quality and the scientific foundation and vision necessary for an accurate appreciation of what souderman have to tell -PRON- 
this man have youth enthusiasm and an excellent education 
in addition -PRON- have a respect for the aged 
the old man at time wish that the course of -PRON- life have make -PRON- possible for -PRON- to have a son like that 
subconsciously -PRON- adopt -PRON- 
have finally find -PRON- man -PRON- spend a few month in become acquaint with -PRON- in learn -PRON- mental reaction to the great event of life 
-PRON- want to leave this man all the knowledge accumulate in those long year of african residence but -PRON- do not want to make any mistake 
-PRON- have a secret to tell but in order to make that secret safe -PRON- have to know just how to tell -PRON- and in order to learn how to do this -PRON- have to study the personality of this youngster who be to become not only -PRON- pupil but finally -PRON- heir 
adam fry i be interesting to note that there be many man in america who be more brilliant than adam fry 
there be scientist who have forget more than this young man know 
but adam fry have one trait that souderman consider necessary for the complete understanding of -PRON- secret and that be imagination 
that be a trait that many scientist lack in fact most student of the world feel that imagination have no part in -PRON- life work 
yet souderman have develop -PRON- imagination and by mean of -PRON- have come to at least a partial understanding of one of the world great secret 
and -PRON- feel that unless -PRON- heir possess the same peculiar mental trait -PRON- would not listen to what may seem the raving of an old man 
-PRON- want a man with the combination of galileo and the farseee vision of jule verne a scientist who understand insect life as fabre and maeterlinck do and yet have the imagination of well poe or gernsback 
in adam fry -PRON- believe that -PRON- have one of these peculiarly combine personality 
at least -PRON- be sure that the young man would understand 
and that be why souderman have be worry until the day -PRON- meet adam fry 
-PRON- want a scientist a man give to imagination and at the same time a man who would understand the half truth half dream of an old man 
-PRON- have live so long an introverted shutin life among the termite that -PRON- be sensitive of criticism could not stand disbelief and ridicule 
-PRON- bad come to america to find a man and in a few day after meet adam fry -PRON- know that -PRON- search be end 
the reaction of adam fry to the old man be all pleasant 
in a singular way -PRON- have always be accustom to respect age and the mere sight of this wornout shrivel old man who have spend a lifetime in isolation awake an intense pity and even love in the young scientist 
-PRON- feel that this man know something and to the youngster all knowledge be sacred 
-PRON- desire nothing more than to learn what this whitehaire man bad to teach and regret that -PRON- comparative poverty make -PRON- impossible for -PRON- to spend a few day or a week with -PRON- 
with these thought -PRON- be a gratify shock to learn that the old man have money and be anxious to adopt -PRON- as a student for the rest of -PRON- life 
all of financial worry could cease and -PRON- be to be pay an adequate salary to do nothing but listen day after day to souderman and from time to time write a complete statement of the conversation 
this statement be to be put on pure linen paper with indelible ink that would last for age and two copy make one for the congressional library in washington and one for the public library in the city of new york 
-PRON- be only to be accessible to member of the american academy of natural science 
adam fry listen to the plan propose by souderman and at once resign -PRON- position as a chemist in the bugtox laboratory 
the two man decide to rent a small apartment overlook riverside drive do -PRON- own housework and cooking and with the exception of regular hour spend in necessary exercise in central park to devote -PRON- entire time to the completion of this manuscript 
souderman do not feel that -PRON- be in the good of health 
-PRON- do not fear death but -PRON- do dread the thought of die before -PRON- life work be securely place on paper and burn into the mind of -PRON- pupil 
han souderman be so impatient to begin -PRON- story that -PRON- could hardly wait till -PRON- be instal in -PRON- apartment 
-PRON- have impress on -PRON- adopt son for so -PRON- be fond of consider -PRON- the necessity of have a permanent ink 
-PRON- also decide not to cover more ground each day than could be write twice before the beginning of the next day talk 
adam fry train as -PRON- be through year of scientific work to take note make a beautiful task of assemble and arrange in logical sequence the old man conversation which at time be rather ramble and disconnect 
the complete manuscript can be examine by anyone who care to take the trouble to do so though -PRON- tell only a part of the complete and final story result from the work of year of patient toil complete by souderman in africa 
story story as tell the young man by souderman during these daily conversation arrange in some order and avoid repetition be about as follow in order for -PRON- to fully understand the end of -PRON- work adam -PRON- will have to listen while i tell -PRON- something about the beginning of -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- know something about -PRON- 
if -PRON- do -PRON- be indeed an exceptional young man 
i go to africa many year ago to study the termite 
many people think that -PRON- be ant and -PRON- common name be the white ant but -PRON- be very different from the ant 
-PRON- be not hymenopterous and therefore have no close relation to the ant and the bee 
-PRON- be usually classify in the order of orthoptera orthopteraid newroptera neuroptera or pseudoneuroptera of the division corrodentia 
some consider -PRON- an entirely separate class and term -PRON- the isoptera 
there be probably from to distinct specie but probably not more than three hundred have be identify and properly label 
i have the honor of isolate more specie than any other one man but why not when i have spend -PRON- life live with -PRON- 
-PRON- be very old 
one hundred and fifty specie have be find in fossil amber 
go back a million year and there be the termite 
go back to the endless night of the primary and there be the termite associate with the protoblattidae 
some man have place -PRON- begin one hundred million year before man appear on this globe 
surely a very respectable age 
during all this time -PRON- have live and through these countless age -PRON- have adapt -PRON- to -PRON- surrounding and necessity 
otherwise -PRON- could not have survive 
man suppose to be a most intelligent creature have just begin to learn a few of the thing that the white ant have be do for million of year 
but -PRON- be able to live efficiently in many way which -PRON- be ignorant of and yet though the knowledge may be beneficial to -PRON- so far -PRON- have be unable to learn the secret of -PRON- life and apply this knowledge to -PRON- own 
doom to a existence in darkness -PRON- have adjust -PRON- to the life of the blind out defensive armour weak pitiful little thing -PRON- have perfect an architecture so secure and build -PRON- house of material so strong that -PRON- could not be break into by any of -PRON- natural enemy until man come with tool of steel and dynamite 
unable to secure a sufficient supply of natural food -PRON- adjust -PRON- to a diet of cellulose wood fibre 
this -PRON- either use as spawning bed for a distinctive kind of mushroom the volvaria eurhisa and the xylaria nigripe 
these mushroom bed -PRON- cultivate carefully prevent the growth of other unfavorable specie 
in other form of termite large number of flagellate protozoa be find in -PRON- intestinal canal 
the weight of these protozoa be often one half the total weight of the entire termite 
the termite eat cellulose and the protozoon digest -PRON- 
in do so -PRON- die and -PRON- form food for the host 
these protozoa the trychonympha campanula be find nowhere else in the world only in the intestine of the termite 
-PRON- build -PRON- home of intestinal secretion mix with small particle of sand or vegetable debris 
this form a wall that be hard and a perfect protection against -PRON- natural enemy 
-PRON- house be perfectly ventilate and at the same time keep warm by some heating system probably generate by decay vegetable mould 
while -PRON- need moisture -PRON- be enable to live in tropical country where the rain fall very seldom 
do -PRON- make water 
or conserve -PRON- 
who know 
at least -PRON- have all -PRON- need 
compare with -PRON- size the height of -PRON- building be enormous 
suppose man be to build accord to the same scale 
then -PRON- house would have to be foot high something that so far have never be attempt by the race -PRON- be so proud of belong to 
in architecture -PRON- show the most astonishing variation especially when -PRON- consider that all of the actual building be from the inside out 
-PRON- house have spire dome column fagade -PRON- imitate every know geometrical shape know to mankind but -PRON- go beyond that and become so grotesque that -PRON- would seem that some mighty mind have fashion thefh in and during an attack of delirium tremen 
-PRON- not only build house but -PRON- build tunnel 
destroy by the light unable to defend -PRON- in any way -PRON- go enormous distance for food and always through tunnel of -PRON- own construction 
at time enormous colony be connect by tunnel apparently for no other reason than a desire to form a social contact with each other perhaps some union political and economic 
-PRON- have solve the problem of food 
everything -PRON- touch can be eat 
-PRON- eat -PRON- dead the useless member of -PRON- colony -PRON- even eat repeatedly -PRON- own dejecta 
nothing be waste nothing be useless 
in time of surplus -PRON- place little pile of food in corner 
certain worker have nothing to do but to supply food to other group of -PRON- political organization 
-PRON- continue -PRON- group life by hatch and care for the egg and young of the queen 
-PRON- be an enormous creature ten or fifteen time large than -PRON- subject 
-PRON- simply lie in the royal cell and for a life of five year -PRON- lay one egg a second thirty million a year or one hundred and fifty million in -PRON- lifetime 
when -PRON- grow old -PRON- be eat and replace by a young queen 
the egg be feed different food and consequently develop different kind of termite 
some have think that there be as many as fifteen different kind carefully differentiate and shape accord to the work that -PRON- be call upon to perform 
some be worker other inside policeman and still other soldier 
a few be specially feed to become future queen other to be the husband of queen 
i want -PRON- to remember that these be all raise from the same kind of egg and -PRON- be produce accord to the need of the colony 
if soldier be need then -PRON- be produce till the need be supply 
do -PRON- see anything wonderful about that 
compare -PRON- with man the socalle intelligent creature 
what can -PRON- do 
a man and a woman can produce a child 
-PRON- can not even determine that child sex 
-PRON- will be some kind of a child but can -PRON- make a musician an artist a mathematician out of -PRON- 
can -PRON- determine -PRON- shape before -PRON- be bear 
the termite do all that and more too 
-PRON- have successfully solve all the problem of life 
the community -PRON- live in be a dark sad and gloomy one but -PRON- be highly efficient 
the individual be in every instance sacrifice for the group 
-PRON- be russia magnify and idealize a million time 
but -PRON- have survive through the age 
for ten million year the ant have be at war with the termite but the termite still survive 
-PRON- live on not as an individual but as a colony 
who direct -PRON- 
souderman go to work a single acre in africa there may be twenty colony 
each house seem to be separate and yet there seem to be an uniform rhythm of life 
-PRON- do thing in the same way and at the same time 
some naturalist have think that this can be call instinct 
that all the deed of this wonderful little thing be without intelligence 
fabre say there be no reason in the wasp no real mind in the bee no intelligence in the ant and yet the termite be far above these less creature 
fstudie this matter 
be there an intelligence 
if so be -PRON- an individual or a group matter 
perhaps there be an electrical phenomona something resemble the contact of -PRON- neurone and dendrone 
i spend year search for an answer 
for a while i think that the queen head the group but i learn that -PRON- be subject to the same immovable law that govern all the rest 
-PRON- be simply a highly specialized glorify worker and when -PRON- usefulness be over -PRON- be kill and eat just like all the rest of the colony 
there seem to be some occult power some ths theory that termite may communicate with each other by mean of substratum vibration usually not audible to the humaa ear lead to the construction of the apparatus describe below 
a more extensive paper on the subject of termite communication will appear later but -PRON- be think that an account of the method of detection of substratum vibration of termite may have a more general interest at this time 
the inside of a telephone transmitter consist of the carbon eup and screw to which the diaphragm be attach be connect to four dry cell 
the primary of a ten to one ratio audio transformer be sopertermite intellect direct the affair f each hottse 
i hunt for -PRON- and for year i could not find -PRON- 
i try to apply every know physical and metaphysical law to the problem and all that i attain be failure 
twenty year pass 
during that time i have do nothing but live and think and study termite 
i try to become one of -PRON- 
i feel that if i could only put -PRON- in the place say of the queen that i could understand the mental reaction of the unit the house the colony better 
i get nowhere but to the depth of despair 
i feel pitifully dumb ignorant helpless 
i be on the outside separate from the great truth not so much by the colony wall but by sheer lack of intellect 
these little termite helpless blind small be live a mental life so complicate that a great scientist could not begin to understand -PRON- 
then i suddenly wonder about the noise 
for there be a noise that come from the colony 
some think that -PRON- be music 
other call -PRON- crackling tictacs whistle cry of alarm if the ear be place on the wall of a termite colony these sound be plainly hear 
i have know of -PRON- for year 
now -PRON- come to -PRON- like a stroke of lightning that perhaps -PRON- could be interpret 
up to the present time i confes that much of -PRON- work have be simply the observation of the average insect student 
i have carefully duplicate the method follow by other man and have devise a few method of -PRON- own but there be nothing very original 
with -PRON- new desire ta interpret the sound that come from the termitary come a new 
vox head mono show section of miarophena and itn base connect to the microphone and battery while the secondary of the transformer be connect to the input terminal of an audio amplifier such as be use in radio work 
aa unirectron ampli fier be use in this case and an ordinary pair of head phone be connect to the output terminal of the amplifier 
the diaphragm be remove from the telephone transmitter and a piece of the wood inhabit by the termite be thread on the diaphragm screw the termite crawl upon the wood jar tb this article from the june issue of science be evidence of the remarkable coincidence of the thought of widely separate people 
both dr keller and the author of this article begin work on this problem at about the same time 
-PRON- illustrate also that this work of dr keller be already show -PRON- prophetic insight as -PRON- be engage the attention of serious scientific worker vision 
other man have try to saw opening into these house to even blast -PRON- open with dynamite as a reward -PRON- have only the partial satisfaction of see the inside of the termitary in a state of hopeless confusion -PRON- give -PRON- no real idea of the life that be be live there under the usual circumstance 
what should be do be to study the life without disturb -PRON- observe -PRON- through the unbroken wall 
that be -PRON- ambition 
thank the new improvement the science of the amplification of sound i be able to assemble a rather satisfactory apparatus 
first there be a bell shape stethoscope a little similar to the instrument use by physician to examine the heart 
-PRON- have a rim of soft rubber which have little hole in -PRON- 
when this be press to the wall of a colony house -PRON- remain there by suction 
inside be a diaphragm 
i have the sound augmented radio tube and finally give to -PRON- by a loud speaker 
now all i have to do be to sit in -PRON- observation tent and listen to the sound that be be form in the termitary 
natural the first instrument be not satisfactory 
the little fellow promptly eat -PRON- 
-PRON- be the most remarkable eater that i have ever see 
-PRON- eat everything 
in australia -PRON- eat bed carpet food of all kind and even soap 
-PRON- be think that if the food be put in tin can -PRON- would be protect but -PRON- work at the tin literally corrode -PRON- with a juice -PRON- secrete and then eat the rusty metal and the food inside 
-PRON- think nothing at all of eat carbon grain thus alter the current from the dry cell 
this produce a sound which ws amplify to the extent that a termite walk on the wood could be hear through the head phone 
-PRON- be find best to mount the microphone button and attach wood on a piece of sponge rubber in order that outside vibration jar the table or floor would not register on the apparatus 
after several hour of observation some soldier of eeticuliterme fiavipe kollar become disturb and be thus stimulate fo hammer -PRON- head upon the i wood 
this performance could be plainly see at the same time that the amplify noise produce be easily hear through the head phone 
this action on the part of soldier of reticuliterme fiavipe have never before be record to -PRON- knowledge and -PRON- imagine that the sound would be almost impossible to hear under natural condition 
audible sound make in a similar manner have be detect among several genera of kalotcrmitidae rhinotermitidae and termitidae before but there have be some confusion in the literature as to whether the sound be cause by hammer the head or by some stridulatory apparatus 
experiment conduct by the senior author how ever seem to indicate that termite hear air vibration very poorly if at all while at the same time -PRON- be very sensitive to substratnm vibration 
this fact together with the definite proof that the head hammer produce a distinct substratum vibration tend to support the idea that these insect communicate with each other through the nest material 
probably the asymmetrical mandible of capntermet and ally genera be modify for make a substratum vibration by snap the mandible 
at these substratnm sound be generally associate with disturbance -PRON- be think likely that -PRON- be utilize as symbol of danger 
the jerking motion of termite commonly observe do not register enough vibration through the substratum to be detect in the apparatus and there seem to be no indication that this action be a method of communication by sound although evidence point to the strong possibility that termite communicate by mean of this jerking motion possibly by mean of an odor stimulation 
there be tome indication report by dr snyder of the bureau of entomology that excessive substratum vibration frequently produce will deter termite from occupy certain situation 
crosstie of railroad with heavy traffic and building occupy by cotton machinery in motion seem to be immune to attack and the above experiment indicate the reason 
robert simpson or pmeatmett through lead of any thickness 
-PRON- can finally go through a glass wall 
naturally -PRON- make short work of -PRON- first acoustophone but i fool -PRON- 
i make a study of the cement -PRON- use in building be able to make a fairly good imitation and cover all the apparatus with that guess -PRON- think -PRON- be a part of -PRON- colony house at least -PRON- do not try to eat -PRON- 
now follow long day of study 
i realize that -PRON- life be not long enough to do all the research especially when -PRON- come to the interpretation of a new language so i enlist help 
the poor fellow be a wonderful linguist but -PRON- just hate bug of all kind so i make hundred of phonograph record for -PRON- and let -PRON- study -PRON- in comfort in -PRON- house at cape town 
-PRON- be odd 
i do not even tell -PRON- what -PRON- be record of just tell -PRON- that -PRON- be a new language and that i would like to see if -PRON- could isolate -PRON- and obtain some meaning as to what -PRON- be all about 
the conclusion -PRON- reach after two year be astonishing and be very useful to -PRON- in reach -PRON- final conclusion 
work independently of -PRON- i be able to isolate certain sound but as i have no idea what action be accompany those sound i at once see the need of actually see what those little fellow be do 
that make -PRON- undertake a special study of the physics of light ray 
i leave africa and go to france and a frenchman and i make a little machine that would enable -PRON- to look right through the wall of the colony house 
-PRON- have some of the principle of the xray but be far easier handle and a great deal more satisfactory 
-PRON- penetrating power be only three foot but that be well than nothing 
now i could look into different part of the colony house 
i could see the life live there under normal condition 
and -PRON- be -PRON- hope that as i see that life live and hear -PRON- live that i could obtain some harmony of purpose between action and sound 
question that at last i would be able to tell these termite be able to think 
some of -PRON- action point to intellectual process 
of course fabre do not think so but i feel that some of -PRON- observation would have make -PRON- change -PRON- opinion 
of course instinct may become very complicated but be -PRON- not possible that the human intelligence be after all simply compose of million of complicated automatic instinctive act 
-PRON- learn the language of the termite 
at least -PRON- think that -PRON- do 
-PRON- remember that i say that the philologist in cape town simply know -PRON- be a language but do not know that -PRON- be a language of ant 
the poor fellow go wild over -PRON- 
-PRON- say that -PRON- believe -PRON- be the old language in the world and the parent tongue of all human speech 
-PRON- isolate root word establish derivation and finally write a glossary compose of over five hundred word 
that be what i want 
i make a few hundred more record for -PRON- promise that i would finance -PRON- book when -PRON- be ready to publish -PRON- and then go back to -PRON- own work determine to learn and use this new language as soon as possible experiment for at least two year 
for example i take a very sharp auger and bore a hole one inch wide through the wall of the house that i have -PRON- acoustophone attach to 
now i be able to look into that house and hear into that house and note -PRON- reaction to this opening of a hole 
as usual a number of soldier come out and form a solid ring around the side of the hole 
then worker come each either drop a globule of liquid cement or a small piece of sand 
within an hour the opening be closed 
be these order give 
do some supreme mentality realize the danger and close the opening by give order 
i procure an ice machine and literally freeze or try to freeze a small portion of the wall 
i have a thermometer in the wall but there be no result 
the termite simply rush large masse of ferment mould to that spot and in spite of -PRON- effort -PRON- keep the temperature to a point where -PRON- could live 
be that intelligence or instinct would bore -PRON- with a detailed study of all these experiment 
at last i come to some very definite conclusion 
each termite have some nervous system 
-PRON- be able to understand certain sound and originate certain sound 
these sound be use in a way to resemble speech at least -PRON- serve as a means of communication 
but there be no sociability and the conversation seem to consist mainly of order 
some power issue order and the million of occupant of one termitary say yes sir and at once obey 
then i be face with a new problem 
whence come these order what constitute the initiate force 
here be a plunge into the realm of the unknown a leap into the darkness of the great void 
for listen to -PRON- and pay attention adam fry to this next statement 
these colony be thousand of year old 
perhaps one house be a million year old 
how can -PRON- tell 
-PRON- be enormous thing 
earthquake can not destroy -PRON- or tornado break -PRON- to piece 
cattle wander at will over -PRON- and on -PRON- top enormous tree grow for -PRON- be a peculiar fact that -PRON- hold all vegetation grow on -PRON- colony house as a thing sacred and not to be eat 
listen to -PRON- 
man since the day of magellan have sail and walk and fly around the world 
-PRON- have go up in the air and down into the deep sea 
the north pole have be look at and the south pole will soon be a commonplace 
where have man not be 
everywhere 
no 
there be one place that the foot of man have never be one place the eye of man have never see and that be the real inside of a terminary 
what be there 
how deep do -PRON- extend into the ground 
what -PRON- see may be only an outer shell 
these be the question i ask -PRON- 
i know that -PRON- be old 
be the intelligence govern -PRON- old 
the life of the human being be but a trifle compare to the race history of the termite 
i feel that in all these million and hundred of million of year that -PRON- have attain to mental process that -PRON- could only imagine 
so far i have see only the carrying out of order 
the termite seem to be but servant 
where be the great mind 
be there a mind 
if so how old be -PRON- 
be -PRON- superior to -PRON- mind 
could -PRON- communicate by this time i know the five hundred word 
i have isolate sentence in fact i be begin to talk -PRON- language 
for example -PRON- have certain sound to indicate that a hole be break in the wall and that -PRON- must be repair 
i reproduce that series of sound that termite sentence on a phonograph and then transmit -PRON- by vibration through the wall 
i watch the result through -PRON- visual apparatus 
at once the soldier come to guard the opening instantly the worker come with -PRON- liquid cement 
of course there be no hole to repair and there be a result confusion 
i wait a day and repeat the experiment 
once again there be confusion 
on the third day there be no reaction 
attach -PRON- acoustophone i carefully bore a hole in this same colony house 
at once there be an order give but -PRON- be not the same as i give 
some new sound have be introduce 
the soldier and worker obey at once and close the hole 
here be a novelty 
someone have learn that -PRON- order be be duplicate and consequently -PRON- order from the inside be change and the worker instruct to pay no attention to the old form 
i go to another termitary and give the original order 
there be no response 
then i give the new order and for two day -PRON- be obey but on the third day -PRON- provoke no reaction 
do -PRON- see anything odd in that -PRON- seem to -PRON- that the supreme intelligence in the first termitary have communicate the news of the complication to the supreme intelligence in the second colony house 
i go one mile away and the result be the same a hundred mile and there be no difference 
the great discovery work a game of chess with this thing rule the colony house 
i would live the receiver of the acoustophone in -PRON- ear and by a specially ingenious invention i learn to talk to the termitary with such a changed voice that -PRON- be an exact duplication of the tone use by the insect 
and gradually -PRON- dawn upon -PRON- that there be two language be use 
one for the issuing of order and the other dare i say -PRON- for the communication of the supreme intelligence of the various colony house 
when that idea dawn upon -PRON- i go rush down to cape town 
i be grow old and there be no time to spend in isolate working 
to -PRON- surprise johanson in cape town have arrive at the same conclusion i have namely that there be two language 
-PRON- have be so stupi fie at the idea that -PRON- feel -PRON- almost impossible to put -PRON- into word but when i blurt out the same thought to -PRON- -PRON- tongue be loosen and for lover an hour -PRON- speak as though touch with the divine fire 
-PRON- talk over the matter for a day and here be -PRON- conclusion 
the termitary have two language 
one be very simple and be use only for the giving of order 
the other be vastly more complicated only imperfectly understand by the soldier and worker and apparently use as a means of communication between the intelligence of different colony house 
johanson hate insect 
-PRON- just naturally could not stand the thought of an ant crawling over -PRON- but -PRON- come with -PRON- to -PRON- termite colony and i will give -PRON- the credit for stay there two week 
then -PRON- leave -PRON- 
the work -PRON- accomplish during those two week place -PRON- on the threshold of the great discovery cease to worry about the less language 
in fact i find that the vibratory scale of the two language be so different that i could tune in the great language and tune out the less one 
on the day i start to do this i be nearly year old 
and the thought come to -PRON- irresistible tremendous aweinspire that the word i be hear be be utter or produce by an intellect that be perhaps a million perhaps ten million year old 
and i be try to understand -PRON- a nothing a mere speck of timeunity of year be try to understand and analyze and study something that be perhaps alive when -PRON- ancestor be crawl reptile or something less 
but i have the urge 
i could not eat 
i be unable to sleep 
nothing would satisfy -PRON- but the knowledge of the ultimate 
and when i be i hear -PRON- talk and understand -PRON- 
do -PRON- see what that mean to -PRON- 
for two year there have be no experimental work i have attempt nothing new i have simply sit there in a chair or rest on -PRON- cot with the receiver in -PRON- ear 
i learn the language 
and then the great idea come to -PRON- 
this termitary with the million of termite all carefully differentiate in shape and ability to perform the various form of work require for the successful functioning of the colony be not compose of million of individual but be simply one large animal 
the colony house be the skeleton change accord to the growth of the animal and -PRON- need 
think this over well 
one large animal 
do -PRON- mean anything 
think of an animal a million year old ten million year old 
imagine the wisdom that -PRON- would have accumulate 
and these little thing -PRON- call termite -PRON- be just so many cell in the body of this animal 
with the conception of this fact i realize that i be face with the wise most remarkable life that have ever appear or would ever appear on this globe 
all the form of life that have be coincident with -PRON- have disappear unable to withstand the change condition of earthly existence but the giant termite have survive 
the palaeozoic type be all go 
the pterodactyl mammoth cave bear sabertoothe tiger have all fail to adjust -PRON- 
but this animal i be think of have slowly conquer continent and be threaten europe and northern america 
and i be study -PRON- alone unarm incompetent i have the temerity to place -PRON- intellect above that of a million year 
other life be go but -PRON- live on 
-PRON- have meet with a cunning patience change in moisture temperature source of food 
in every instance -PRON- intelligence have be sufficient to provide security against a threatening danger 
in all the study make by over fifty careful observer only one termitary be find lifeless 
thus there be no death rate 
-PRON- live on and i believe that -PRON- ambition be to finally rule the world 
that give -PRON- food for thought 
i know that the area -PRON- live on be slowly expand 
now and then new city fresh agricultural area be overrun 
be there a method back of this 
could -PRON- plot prepare and premeditate an attack each one be hopeless in -PRON- stationary position 
-PRON- could not move but -PRON- could form new member 
across the field -PRON- would send a cement tunnel and through this blind tunnel the worker would go perhaps for a hundred foot and there a new colony house would be erect 
i see that happen 
for two year i see such a house grow and during all those two year -PRON- be rule by the intelligence from the first house and then oh -PRON- must believe -PRON- for this be one of the great of proof the tunnel be break the two house become separate and in the second house be a second intelligence and -PRON- be not a new form but have the wisdom and apparent endless age of the first 
be -PRON- a part determine that what i have see be simply a bud a cleavage a peculiar form of birth of a new individual 
and thus by slowly establish new individual all with the same mentality -PRON- hope to conquer the world 
an amazing conversation silent 
as i say for over two year i do nothing but listen 
and finally i could stand -PRON- no longer 
-PRON- plan be so heartless so coldly diabolical maddening in -PRON- cleverness and deadly in -PRON- ability to wait for a thousand a million year if only at the end of that time -PRON- be able to rule the world and drive out all other form of life -PRON- be all so horrible that i just have to do something 
-PRON- will remember that i have never try to talk to -PRON- 
but now i determine to do so 
i formulate a phrase in -PRON- language and i vibrate that phrase through the wall of a hundred colony house in the immediate neighborhood of -PRON- laboratory 
i say this be a large world 
there be room for all 
why try to destroy all other life f and then i go back to -PRON- favorite termitary replace the acoustophone and start to listen 
and what i hear be this 
i write -PRON- on a piece of paper and put -PRON- in -PRON- wallet 
-PRON- be fortunate that i do so 
here be the paper and here be the message 
for a long while -PRON- have be study -PRON- 
because of this -PRON- have tolerate -PRON- 
now -PRON- must leave can tolerate no interference with -PRON- plan 
for year i have be unmoleste by the termite 
here be the explanation 
to complete -PRON- knowledge -PRON- have to study man 
in order to do this -PRON- have to have a man near -PRON- 
-PRON- could not catch a man and make -PRON- a source of observation 
for all these year i have oblige -PRON- by remain in one place 
i think that i be study -PRON- whereas the truth be -PRON- have be study -PRON- 
for once in -PRON- life i be absolutely at a loss as to -PRON- future conduct 
restless i go to bed 
the next morning after a bad night of dream i wake to find -PRON- laboratory a wreck 
everything be go eat cut to little piece 
-PRON- record apparatus food supply be go 
-PRON- clothing be eat but i have be spare though the cot i sleep on even the mattress be a complete wreck 
-PRON- have tell -PRON- to leave and this be the final warning 
i have the clothe on -PRON- back some memo in -PRON- wallet and that be all 
of course the very valuable phonograph record be safe in cape town 
at least i think so 
i hurry there but i be too late 
poor johanson have be attack the same night only -PRON- have be kill literally eat alive by million of warrior termite while -PRON- record in fact -PRON- entire house be a wreck 
i be horrified and at the same time i know that -PRON- life may be the next to go 
here be time for deceit 
i arrange to leave cape town on a certain steamer 
i tell dozen of people that i be go to do so 
i even go out to a colony of termitarie and shout the news and then at the last minute i leave in an airplane 
that ship sink the day after -PRON- sail from cape town and all on board be lose 
diver examine the hull and find that -PRON- be literally eat to piece by termite 
look as though -PRON- try to get -PRON- 
i do not think -PRON- can in new york city 
-PRON- be too cold but -PRON- be work on the problem of live in cold climate 
-PRON- have to solve that and then -PRON- will creep over the world 
so there be -PRON- story and there be the danger 
johanson could corroborate -PRON- but -PRON- be dead 
-PRON- record be destroy 
only -PRON- intellect survive and i be now an old man 
well adam fry cease writing and tell -PRON- if -PRON- believe -PRON- 
the young man smile certainly i believe -PRON- 
why not 
at one time i study medicine 
the anatomy of the human body be proof that -PRON- be right 
for day i have be listen to -PRON- describe those colony house and all the time i have be think make use of -PRON- imagination try to compare -PRON- termite organization with the human body 
-PRON- have make the comparison one worth while 
-PRON- tell -PRON- when -PRON- first meet that what -PRON- want be a man with imagination a young man that could think outside the beat track 
well i will reward -PRON- search and i will make a statement 
the only difference between the termitary and man be one of age and intelligence souderman laugh almost hysterically as -PRON- grab -PRON- student and kiss -PRON- on either cheek -PRON- dear boy -PRON- real son 
-PRON- see -PRON- 
-PRON- see -PRON- 
-PRON- see the analogy all by -PRON- 
i want to have -PRON- do that 
for night i have be pray that -PRON- do this 
i do not want to tell -PRON- for that would spoil -PRON- all 
only by arrive at this conclusion separately could -PRON- show -PRON- that -PRON- be worthy to share -PRON- secret 
now i can die happy for i know that -PRON- will go on and on 
with the foundation i have lay -PRON- will be able to build a superstructure that will astonish and perhaps save the human race from a future terrible destruction 
i believe -PRON- be right 
i believe with -PRON- that there be an universal pattern of life of which the combined life of a single termite colony be the old and most remarkable form 
-PRON- must have be the old form and all the other life on the earth since -PRON- development must have be foolish effort to imitate that type of life 
with what success or failure -PRON- can judge 
-PRON- think man have be the great achievement of the age 
to the ability of the great termite -PRON- have add locomotion 
what else 
nothing 
do the giant termite know anything man be ignorant of 
-PRON- boy when i think of -PRON- intelligence and -PRON- ignorance i have to laugh at the colossal ass -PRON- be make of -PRON- 
for year i study the termite 
i be thrill at -PRON- discovery and at the fact that -PRON- apparatus be untouched and then i suddenly find out that i be the one -PRON- be study and when -PRON- be through with -PRON- -PRON- destroy -PRON- work -PRON- kill poor johanson and in -PRON- effort to get -PRON- -PRON- wreck a large steamer 
-PRON- be simply wait 
time with -PRON- mean nothing 
and when -PRON- have learn the little thing -PRON- need -PRON- will come north and when -PRON- do all other life will vanish 
-PRON- be selfsufficient and need no ally 
for million of year the real ant have be fight thejn but what be the result not in a single instance have the black ant be successful 
warn about a single pattern of life 
-PRON- be a form of termite colony only -PRON- be infinitely low than the giant termite of the tropic 
-PRON- live sixty seventy year and then -PRON- be dead 
i wonder if the real termite know what group death be 
-PRON- prate of -PRON- nervous system -PRON- red and -PRON- white corpuscle -PRON- muscle bone and digestive cell but be -PRON- under the control of -PRON- will 
not at all and yet in the case of the giant termite every function be absolutely govern by the central intelligence 
-PRON- be true that when -PRON- outer wall -PRON- skin be break -PRON- be repair by -PRON- worker but what a poor process that repair be in comparison with the repair of the wall of the termite colony house 
everything -PRON- do be childlike puerile infantile compare to -PRON- profound efficiency 
if -PRON- know what -PRON- know -PRON- would be able to prolong life indefinitely become efficient in any line of endeavor 
-PRON- problem of life nutrition housing disease the temperature of the body all these thing would be simplify 
-PRON- call -PRON- human being in reality -PRON- be simply a collection of a number of interrelate but at the same time independent cell live within a colony wall call the skin and so far -PRON- know absolutely nothing concern the real governing of these cell by mean of the high intelligence mind or of the central nervous system 
the central intelligence of the giant termite issue direct order to all the individual cell which form -PRON- body 
consider -PRON- as cell or as individual living creature little termite whatever -PRON- please but no matter how -PRON- call -PRON- -PRON- be absolutely under the control of the central monarch the of that colony 
can -PRON- do that 
if -PRON- liver cell be sick can -PRON- make thousand of new one 
if there be too many white corpuscle the policeman of -PRON- blood can -PRON- order that one third of -PRON- be destroy and eat for the public good can -PRON- form new human being -PRON- say yes but will -PRON- automatically be possess with the accumulate power and wisdom of the past hundred million year 
how about the idiot the epileptic the defective -PRON- procreate 
there be none of that in the giant termite 
man know a lot but when -PRON- come in conflict with these stationary animal who have serenely wander down from the past aeon -PRON- have to surrender 
-PRON- can not live with -PRON- or in fact near -PRON- 
-PRON- strike in the dark but when -PRON- finish there be no place for the man form of termite 
some day -PRON- will come 
-PRON- will be blindly go to the movie amuse -PRON- talk through the air listen to the radio dash over the road in -PRON- automobile aimlessly like so many cockroach or fly in the air like blunder beetle 
-PRON- will die as a race before -PRON- be able to appreciate what have kill -PRON- 
perhaps for some century a few of the human being will survive shiver around the pole 
i see -PRON- all and -PRON- will too because -PRON- have imagination but who else will see -PRON- can the race be warn -PRON- can not reply adam fry 
-PRON- will almost kill -PRON- laugh at -PRON- if -PRON- try to warn -PRON- 
tornado -PRON- understand death from war and tidal wave destruction from famine and pestilence -PRON- have at least read of but that whole nation should perish through the silent working of a creature that -PRON- would only see as a small helpless defenseless blind white ant -PRON- will not understand 
-PRON- be too grandiose too sure of -PRON- position in the world -PRON- live in too confident that -PRON- be select by god to rule the world 
-PRON- be even confident of god 
but the race must be save insisted souderman 
-PRON- be man 
-PRON- be incomprehensible that -PRON- brother should be so stupid but -PRON- must save -PRON- in spite of -PRON- asinine lack of imagination 
i say that -PRON- must save -PRON- 
in reality -PRON- must because i will not be here much long 
-PRON- have the secret 
in the little time i have to live i will teach -PRON- all i know and then as -PRON- grow old -PRON- must teach some one else 
perhaps when the real test come when there be the final struggle the one man who be -PRON- descendant may save mankind 
that be some measure of responsibility know but -PRON- have to be assume feel say adam fry slowly as though -PRON- be not sure of -PRON- statement that the first thing -PRON- should do be to preserve -PRON- knowledge of the language of the giant termite 
i do not mean the command language speak to the warrior and laborer but rather the language use by the central intelligence when -PRON- be talk with each other 
-PRON- surely know -PRON- by heart at least -PRON- have enough of -PRON- so -PRON- could make phonographic record or perhaps better still teach -PRON- to a few philologist so -PRON- could make a write language out of -PRON- 
then there be another idea which can be develop in the course of the next few year 
i feel that -PRON- work be cut short and that -PRON- be incomplete without an effort make to actually find and see one of these thing whatever -PRON- may call -PRON- which be the head the actual intellectual force behind the animal -PRON- call the giant termite 
i feel that something may be learn if one be actually capture 
if -PRON- knowledge be so superior to -PRON- perhaps some compromise may be reach 
how about -PRON- 
-PRON- first idea be a good one reply the old scientist 
work once do nee not be repeat 
many year of -PRON- life be spend in the endeavor to learn this peculiar language 
if some one repeat that work -PRON- would be simply time waste 
-PRON- will be an easy matter for -PRON- to make phonograph record and i could also teach -PRON- to -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- can enlist the aid of a real linguist who will work out a grammar and a vocabulary 
-PRON- will think about -PRON- 
in regard to -PRON- second suggestion -PRON- open interesting possibility 
of course -PRON- realize that i leave africa the way i do because i feel that some one should know the secret and i be convince that the giant termite be go to do all -PRON- could to stop -PRON- 
-PRON- kill johanson 
of course some would call that a coincidence but i feel that -PRON- be the tremendous effort of a gigantic intellect to preserve secrecy 
i have try to imagine what such a thing look like but i have fail 
perhaps one could be locate and capture but -PRON- look impossible to -PRON- 
of course -PRON- could drill into a termitary and blast -PRON- with dynamite and thus -PRON- may get to the bottom of the animal but -PRON- may be that this would only result in -PRON- death 
perhaps -PRON- be psychic and when -PRON- find everything -PRON- would have to confess that -PRON- have actually find nothing 
-PRON- may be like the thing -PRON- call a soul 
-PRON- think that there be a soul but in the autopsy room on the dissecting table where be there a trace of -PRON- 
i have think of a gray mass round with convolution shape like the brain of man but what would -PRON- be like without -PRON- body 
could -PRON- live on naturally -PRON- could not capture an entire colony and transplant -PRON- 
no someone who know more than i do will have to undertake the problem of determine what the actual central intelligence of the giant termite really be 
i know the danger of -PRON- the shrewd vast intelligence of -PRON- the ability -PRON- have to bide -PRON- time and adjust -PRON- to change of -PRON- external 
but i can not even guess what -PRON- look like or how -PRON- can ever be conquer 
the first invasion there be nothing like try say adam fry bluntly 
nothing can be accomplish without the primary effort 
suppose -PRON- get the language put into an imperishable form and then some year from now i may go to africa -PRON- 
i want -PRON- to make a map of that region for -PRON- 
i want to go there and locate that special giant termite -PRON- talk to the one that threaten -PRON- if -PRON- do not leave -PRON- alone the one who say -PRON- have be study -PRON- 
perhaps i could catch -PRON- 
all that spring the two man work and on into the summer 
phonographic record be make map be draw detailed blue print show the various scientific instrument use by souderman in -PRON- year of african study 
as soon as adam fry be able to sustain -PRON- share of the conversation the two man talk in the termite language first perfect -PRON- in the language of the worker which souderman call the command language and then advance to the speech of the giant intellect use only in intercommunication between the ego of the different colony 
the young man work harder than -PRON- have ever do before in -PRON- entire adult life 
gradually the two manuscript near completion and finally -PRON- be finish 
the one be send by express to the congressional library at washington while the other be in a drawer wait to be carry to the new york city library 
the man have decide to take this valuable document in person to the librarian and explain to -PRON- the importance of -PRON- 
-PRON- have decide to do this the first of august 
-PRON- be an interesting sight to see the two man on that morning 
the one old stoopedshouldere and whitehaire and yet with the gleam of youth in -PRON- eye the young man keenly alert physically capable of any exertion brilliantly equip in every way to play the part in life that fall to -PRON- lot 
-PRON- wear red necktie this morning and be freshly shave 
souderman even insist on carry a cane 
-PRON- cry that a man be as old as -PRON- feel 
-PRON- eat a hearty breakfast of soft boil egg bacon toast and coffee 
then -PRON- prepare to start out 
but when -PRON- open the drawer the book be go 
-PRON- be a manuscript book the page and soft leather cover hold together by steel ring 
these steel ring be in the drawer 
the two man look at each other 
at last souderman say with a deep sigh 
the summer have be hot 
then -PRON- pull the drawer wide open and point to a long tube the size of a straw and about the same color that stretch from one corner of the drawer over to the middle where the book have be 
termite -PRON- whisper 
adam fry look at -PRON- as though a thousand question dart from -PRON- eye 
but all -PRON- tongue could say be coincidence 
the old man smilingly shake -PRON- head -PRON- may fool -PRON- by think so -PRON- lad but with the giant termite nothing happen by accident by coincidence 
no this be simply the first attack of the enemy 
-PRON- may not have happen in the winter but -PRON- have take advantage of the long and very hot summer 
how do -PRON- locate -PRON- 
-PRON- can not think 
where be -PRON- imagination 
i be sure that -PRON- do not look -PRON- up in the telephone directory 
but now be not the time for morbid introspection and idle speculation 
now be the time for action 
here be the thread of life the channel through which the attack be make 
suppose -PRON- try to follow -PRON- downward 
-PRON- probably come up through the leg of the table 
i recall now that -PRON- have not be move since -PRON- come here 
suppose -PRON- tilt -PRON- over on -PRON- side 
there see that hole in the bottom of that leg 
now where do -PRON- connect with the floor 
just as i think 
there be the hole 
now somewhere in the ground under this building be the main body of the giant termite that be assign to this work 
can -PRON- imagine the cunne the intellect the enormous mentality of such a being 
immobile not capable of change -PRON- home -PRON- yet devise method to be carry to new york by ship locate -PRON- in the city find -PRON- here satisfy -PRON- that i be the man -PRON- have be seek 
then -PRON- establish station for observation in -PRON- room 
no doubt every word -PRON- say all of -PRON- plan perhaps for all i know even -PRON- thought be understand appreciate and store in the storehouse of memory 
-PRON- think that -PRON- be shrewd in place one copy in the congressional library 
perhaps even now a giant termite be wait there to destroy -PRON- when -PRON- come 
well boy -PRON- partnership be over from now on -PRON- only safety lie in separation and rapidly move from place to place 
fortunately -PRON- duplicate the phonograph record 
-PRON- will each take half of -PRON- 
i be go to secure a skilled linguist and go to some cold country like labrador and teach -PRON- the termite language 
-PRON- do what -PRON- think best but be careful of -PRON- because one night will ruin -PRON- hope 
do -PRON- still think that -PRON- want to kill -PRON- 
-PRON- have a thousand chance do not know 
-PRON- never try to hurt -PRON- so long as -PRON- think i be not go to fight -PRON- 
just as soon as -PRON- consider -PRON- an enemy -PRON- come close to destroy -PRON- life 
adam fry sigh do not want to leave new york yet 
i have an idea that i want to work out 
then i will be satisfied to go to africa and see what i can do there 
i try to imagine all -PRON- tell -PRON- but these later development show -PRON- something that before seem only visionary and fantastic 
i feel that -PRON- be more than right 
all these giant termite need be some sure defense against the cold and -PRON- will overrun the world 
-PRON- may not kill mankind but -PRON- be possible that -PRON- may be reduce to abject slavery a life of raise cellulose and mix cement for -PRON- master 
be -PRON- go to try and find this individual termite that be live somewhere under this building 
no replied souderman vigorously shake -PRON- head the good thing to do be to pack -PRON- thing and get out 
suppose -PRON- spend three hour trace this slender hollow tube of cement to the basement 
by the time -PRON- return -PRON- may find the entire surface of every phonograph record smear with a glasslike cement and utterly ruin 
-PRON- have well leave 
i say out loud that i be go to labrador and -PRON- say out loud that -PRON- would stay in the city 
-PRON- have both well change -PRON- plan and think -PRON- instead of say -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- be able to read -PRON- thought 
perhaps not 
but -PRON- have ample fund and all i know -PRON- do 
-PRON- go ahead 
the safety of the human race lie in -PRON- hand 
find the man the loss of any more time the two man pack the most valuable of -PRON- possession and leave the small apartment that have be -PRON- home for so many interesting month of companionship 
-PRON- be not till -PRON- be several mile away from the apartment house that -PRON- venture to speak 
-PRON- go into a small cafeteria that be hum with the noise of a thousand busy customer 
buy some roll and coffee -PRON- sit down 
then souderman take out a paper and pencil and write an address on the paper will be here if -PRON- want -PRON- -PRON- whisper and hand the paper over to adam fry 
the young man look at -PRON- a long time memorize -PRON- then burn -PRON- and place the ashe in -PRON- coffee 
fine -PRON- comment 
there could be no well place 
i will let -PRON- know from time to time how thing be go -PRON- dear master and take care of -PRON- 
and so -PRON- part 
the young man take -PRON- heavy bundle of record and go to a cold storage plant that make a specialty of take care of fur and other perishable valuable 
-PRON- leave the phonographic record of the giant termite language there and walk out on the street 
to all appearance -PRON- look just like any one of ten thousand man -PRON- pass every few minute 
there be this difference 
-PRON- know what danger menace -PRON- and -PRON- care -PRON- neither know nor care 
-PRON- be on -PRON- way to save -PRON- 
-PRON- go to a cheap hotel and register for hour 
once in -PRON- room -PRON- simply sit and think 
-PRON- have the beginning of an idea and -PRON- want to find some one who would have sufficient mentality to take that thought and push -PRON- over into actuality 
even as souderman have hunt for a man with imagination so be fry search for a supermind an intellect that would be able to think in channel hitherto unknown to mankind 
the young man feel keenly that the saving of the human race be the responsibility of souderman and -PRON- but -PRON- want to enlarge the partnership 
-PRON- feel keenly the need of a brain better train than -PRON- in what 
perhaps in sociology religion world politic 
-PRON- hardly know what kind of a brain the manner of a man that -PRON- really want but -PRON- do know that -PRON- could not rest till -PRON- have find the man and tell -PRON- the story of the giant termite and the additional thought that -PRON- have which so far -PRON- could not form 
so far -PRON- have to be content with the simple knowledge that the germ of the thought exist 
fry review the man that -PRON- have know the great man in the world who be really do work of vast importance 
there be scientist economist business man politician world visionary lawyer physician psychologist and leader of teligious thought 
wherever -PRON- locate in -PRON- mind a man of sufficient intellect -PRON- see the man so engross with work that -PRON- seem impossible to require of -PRON- the faking of one additional burden 
rich man poor man industrious man giant intellect do the work of a dozen average man the labor of a million moron 
where among such man could -PRON- find a man who would willingly listen to a perfect stranger -PRON- see that none of -PRON- would willingly listen to -PRON- but perhaps -PRON- could force one to for at least a few hour till interest make -PRON- impossible for the listener to break the thread of the narrative 
with this new viewpoint -PRON- again go over the list of the man -PRON- know or have hear of and finally select a bank president 
here be a peculiar choice 
bailey bankerville be the descendant of the famous bankerville who have largely finance the american revolution 
no one know just how long the family have be financier 
perhaps -PRON- originally come from the vank de ville family and everyone know that -PRON- be the financial power behind william the conqueror when -PRON- conduct the campaign that conquer isolate england 
bailey or 4th as -PRON- be know to -PRON- intimate friend have become the head of the family on the early death of -PRON- father 
-PRON- have handle the affair of the enormous corporation with the great ease by find capable man to do the work for -PRON- 
consequently -PRON- have find a sufficient time to play and -PRON- have do so 
-PRON- play would be consider by other man as work 
for example -PRON- spend a large sum and a year of -PRON- life make a careful study of the monolith of easter island 
when -PRON- finish this -PRON- be easily the world good authority on these enormous remain of a people long since dead and forget 
-PRON- book on the subject print in a limited edition of twenty volume be one of the most prize work seek by anthropologist 
with nothing but stone to work with -PRON- form a theory of the life and habit of these people that no one have ever be able to controvert 
this work which -PRON- laughingly call play be but one of a number of similar adventure in which -PRON- seek to wr from mother earth -PRON- secret 
-PRON- have be so busy do this and at the same time augment the family fortune that -PRON- have no time to play in field feminine 
so far -PRON- know woman simply as the female of the genus homo 
-PRON- be fairly well familiar with -PRON- attribute as an entity but never willingly seek the company of any woman except -PRON- mother and sister 
this be the man that adam fry pick out to finish the thinking of -PRON- great thought 
fry know the man have imagination boundless perseverance and an education that equip -PRON- to at least follow the bare outline of any scientific discussion 
the problem of the man be solve the next question be how to meet -PRON- 
that become far more serious than appear at first thought 
make -PRON- listen be artistic and therefore temperamental 
to a great extent -PRON- be a man of mood quick to react to little peculiar stimulation 
when fry send in -PRON- card and ask for an interview the banker be annoy 
-PRON- have eat salt mackerel that morning and -PRON- be repeat in a very gastronomical way 
-PRON- see the name and -PRON- ask -PRON- private secretary 
be -PRON- small or large 
when the man answer that the visitor be a trifle small -PRON- at once react with the phrase small fry a poor fish if i see -PRON- once i will never be able to get rid of -PRON- 
-PRON- will be a repeater like that damn mackerel 
tell -PRON- i be busy 
tell -PRON- i be out 
tell -PRON- i refuse to see -PRON- 
tell -PRON- anything -PRON- like but show -PRON- the door 
adam fry come back the next day and the next 
and never again at least not to the banker office 
the follow saturday night the banker have a very uncomfortable dream in which there seem to be an inability to move 
wake -PRON- find that this be an actuality for -PRON- be securely tie to the bed and also gag to prevent -PRON- call308 e for help lit the dim light -PRON- see a man at the foot of the bed and now that this man see -PRON- be awake -PRON- start to talk be adam fry 
i want to see -PRON- in fact i have to see -PRON- 
i call at the office three time and -PRON- would not have anything to do with -PRON- so i be force to visit -PRON- at -PRON- home 
i be not a robber or a murderer -PRON- motive be neither commercial nor religious 
i feel that if -PRON- will listen to -PRON- talk for an hour -PRON- will listen to -PRON- to the end 
i hope that i can take the gag off and unbind -PRON- 
will -PRON- agree not to call for help 
the banker have a save sense of humor 
for a week -PRON- have be make fun of this man without ever see -PRON- 
now the man have -PRON- 
sure i will listen to -PRON- -PRON- say as the gag be untied 
let -PRON- free and -PRON- will go to the library and spend the rest of the night 
i think -PRON- be a bothersome interloper but anyone that be clever enough to pull this stunt be worthy of consideration 
i suppose -PRON- be some new kind of bond salesman one of those gogetter devil 
let -PRON- turn on the light and locate -PRON- bathrobe and slipper and for goodness sake put that gun away 
-PRON- may go off and break something like a look glass 
hard luck -PRON- know to have a look glass break 
in a few minute -PRON- be in the library comfortably seat in overstuffed leather chair 
bankerville offer a drink which fry refuse say -PRON- will think that i be drunk anyway before -PRON- be through 
then adam fry start to talk to the banker 
-PRON- first tell all about the giant termite as study by souderman 
-PRON- be still tell about -PRON- when the butler enter the room to open the shade and let in the sunlight 
bankerville jump up with a start shave and dress 
-PRON- can talk while -PRON- be shave 
then -PRON- will have breakfast 
i will send word to the bank that i will not be there today 
i never have so much mental sport since tige be a pup 
i do not know where -PRON- have be stay but i know where -PRON- be go to stay from now on 
-PRON- be go to be -PRON- guest 
i do not know how much -PRON- have to tell -PRON- but -PRON- be go to tell -PRON- all before -PRON- quit 
send for those record 
-PRON- must be keep safe and i be go to send the good linguist i can hire to examine -PRON- and learn that language 
-PRON- either be insane or -PRON- be up against the large problem that ever hit mankind since the flood 
-PRON- highjack -PRON- into this and by the sacred cow of benare i be go to stay in as one of the lead actor till the play be finish 
that be what i want -PRON- to do answer adam fry 
-PRON- be greatly pleased 
in fact -PRON- feel that now -PRON- could begin fight in earnest 
at the same time -PRON- realize that even though the rich man be thrill with the story of the giant termite there be still a large question and a very important one to be answer 
would the man brain leap over the gap that have stop the mental process of adam fry 
there be a secret there somewhere 
fry feel -PRON- could see dimly the outline of a great truth but the final development be still an impossibility 
-PRON- need something well than a fry brain 
would a bankerville intelligence suffice 
the two man shave and prepare for breakfast 
at that time a rather startling surprise await adam fry 
bankerville have a sister and that young lady susanne bankerville be very much in attendance on the two man 
in any household news spread like wildfire and the banker sister greatly please at the idea of anyone actually hogtie -PRON- brother and force -PRON- to listen to a wildgoose yam have violate all feminine rule and be at the breakfast table charmingly clothe and apparently anxious to make toast for the two man 
up to this time bankerville and -PRON- sister have be sufficient unto -PRON- 
clothe in masculine attire -PRON- have accompany -PRON- on all of -PRON- queer expedition and the fact that -PRON- have obtain an excellent scientific education make -PRON- a very valuable aid to bankerville in -PRON- anthropological research 
-PRON- do not look very masculine this particular morning and that be entirely -PRON- own premeditated fault 
-PRON- have live with -PRON- brother for thirty year -PRON- be five year old than -PRON- 
during that time -PRON- have never know of any man get the good of -PRON- brother in any kind of a conflict 
now the whole household be buzz with suppress curiosity and -PRON- be no wonder that -PRON- make -PRON- very charmingly feminine and wait with considerable desire the appearance of the dragon killer 
adam fry be at a loss to know how to consider -PRON- after the introduction 
could -PRON- talk freely or must -PRON- be guard in all -PRON- say 
bankerville lose no time place -PRON- at -PRON- ease as -PRON- follow up the introduction with a long tirade concern the real worth of -PRON- sister and at the same time what a tremendous nuisance -PRON- always be when -PRON- visit the faroff place of the earth 
this young lady -PRON- begin refuse to let -PRON- get out of town without -PRON- 
ever since -PRON- start to walk -PRON- have be a tagger 
-PRON- run away from school to go to the easter island with -PRON- 
-PRON- never do find -PRON- till -PRON- be three hundred mile from shore 
-PRON- would not have show up then be -PRON- not for the fact that -PRON- become seasick 
well that be the way -PRON- have be 
when i be in new york -PRON- behave mighty decent but just as soon as i get the wanderlust -PRON- insist on get out -PRON- knicker and though i try mighty hard i can not shake -PRON- from -PRON- trail 
this be the first time in five year that -PRON- have have breakfast with -PRON- 
why 
because -PRON- smell a rat 
-PRON- think that i be into something and -PRON- refuse to be leave out 
i do not know how -PRON- come to find out that i invite -PRON- to breakfast so -PRON- could discuss the new classification of shellfish but woman be peculiar that way 
-PRON- think that -PRON- be a boy scout or something and -PRON- want to meet -PRON- 
-PRON- look real cute now but -PRON- ought to see -PRON- in -PRON- war tog 
yoti can say anything -PRON- want to in -PRON- presence -PRON- be absolutely to be trust 
and i will say this -PRON- brain be well than -PRON- for -PRON- have feminine intuition 
that be the end of -PRON- speech 
susanne bankerville smile and now mr fry tell -PRON- about the shellfish 
giant termite -PRON- dear sister correct the brother 
do -PRON- know anything about termite miss bankerville ask fry certainly do not but do not mind -PRON- 
-PRON- start right in where -PRON- leave off last night or be -PRON- this morning or have -PRON- just begin 
the information i have be so confusing 
brother say -PRON- ask -PRON- to have breakfast with -PRON- and other say that -PRON- conversation start during the night 
well let -PRON- guest eat and then -PRON- will all go to the library 
i have send for those record and when -PRON- come i will play -PRON- on the orthophonic know sister will like to hear -PRON- 
-PRON- be wild about all those foreign jabber 
the rest of the meal be very quiet and almost formal 
the young lady soon show that -PRON- be the perfect hostess and adam fry be at once place in a position where -PRON- have to acknowledge that -PRON- be have a very pleasant time 
fry deliver a lecture after -PRON- be again seat in the library but at this and for that matter at all future session susanne bankerville be an interested member of the audience 
there be no doubt continue adam fry that the million of little blind termite enclose in a colony house simply compose so many part of one animal which souderman call for convenience the giant termite 
i feel that for a correct understanding of -PRON- problem -PRON- must consider the colony as an outer shell or skeleton 
the various worker warrior even the queen and -PRON- husband be all dispensable and replaceable but irrespective of the deathrate of the individual termite the giant termite live on as -PRON- be always absolutely able to replace any of -PRON- dead individual feel and that be what i tell souderman to -PRON- great delight that all life follow the same primitive pattern 
first there be one cell and then a number of cell unite for offensive and defensive reason 
then the cell specialize 
the analogy between the giant termite and all other life be interesting but perhaps especially so in man 
the human body be compose of a number of individual cell 
-PRON- serve many different purpose and like the individual termite can only do one kind of work 
the termite work industriously at -PRON- task which be predetermine before -PRON- be mature 
-PRON- can do nothing else 
the corpuscle in the blood stream be similar the red cell carry oxygen under no circumstance can -PRON- do anything else 
the white cell be a scavenger -PRON- clean up the debris but never can -PRON- carry oxygen 
the nerve cell carry message but the muscle cell contract 
all these million of cell be contain in a skin just as the million of termite be contain inside the stone wall of the colony house 
the great advantage that the giant termite have over the human termite be the fact that -PRON- can send out -PRON- cell from the body proper and be sure that -PRON- will return 
when -PRON- cell leave the confine of the skin -PRON- be lose 
that be what happen when there be a hemorrhage 
the individual cell go but -PRON- never return 
-PRON- be absolutely lose 
when -PRON- compare the control the central intelligence of the giant termite have over -PRON- individual cell to the control that the central intelligence of man have over -PRON- cell -PRON- be force to acknowledge -PRON- pitiful inadequacy 
what take place within -PRON- do so without -PRON- knowledge control or approval 
how different in the giant termite 
occasionally -PRON- cell revolt die without be replace new cell grow in a disproportionate manner and -PRON- die of cancer 
at the good -PRON- live but a few year and then -PRON- die while the giant termite live on 
i doubt if -PRON- know death 
the giant termite be what -PRON- be today because for million of year -PRON- have be make to fight enemy of life of atmosphere of bitter surrounding 
-PRON- have to endure hunger privation danger and yet survive 
in the short time man have live what have -PRON- learn practically nothing 
just one minute interrupt susanne bankerville 
do i understand that each individual termite have a separate intelligence 
-PRON- must have 
i compare -PRON- to cell and yet the microscope show that -PRON- be really form of many cell 
-PRON- have the ability to understand speech because -PRON- obey order 
-PRON- have a definite speech with word and yet -PRON- have no initiative -PRON- can do be obey 
communism social discipline be carry to such a point that every one of -PRON- have to be finally sacrifice to the good of the community 
-PRON- work for the central intelligence but have no part in any happiness or benefit 
the entire social order be predicate on selfsacrifice of the individual in order that the mass the entire animal may live 
another question 
do -PRON- think that the cell within -PRON- body have a similar individuality a peculiar type of mentality 
do -PRON- know anything 
can the blood cell the little bone cell the muscle fiber think reason do anything but obey a nervous impulse 
adam fry look at the girl curiously as -PRON- reply honestly i do not know 
certainly there be not the beautiful control of -PRON- cell that the central intelligence of the giant termite exercise over -PRON- individual termite cell 
-PRON- can not force -PRON- cell to perform certain act 
of course -PRON- can in a limited way as in walking but the effort -PRON- make to manage the affair of -PRON- body be pitifully infantile 
-PRON- can not even keep alive or well 
yet every part of the work do by the giant termite be duplicate in -PRON- body 
practically 
but poorly 
-PRON- be as though -PRON- be just learn as though after a million year -PRON- be just out of -PRON- infancy barely begin to understand life 
-PRON- be learn to talk but -PRON- lisp stutter utter thought in baby talk 
nothing like that with the giant termite 
how much do -PRON- know anyway growl bankerville 
how can i tell souderman work with -PRON- for year and -PRON- be completely nonplussed at the end 
-PRON- even accuse -PRON- jokingly of find -PRON- apartment in new york by make use of a telephone directory 
perhaps -PRON- have all the wisdom of the entire precede age 
perhaps -PRON- know a hundred time more than -PRON- do 
-PRON- certainly have perfect a bodily structure that be infinitely more remarkable than ours 
-PRON- have by jove what an idea 
-PRON- have put leg on -PRON- corpuscle teach -PRON- to walk instead of swim and then take away -PRON- blood liquid 
-PRON- cell literally run around in dry artery juiceless capillary and yet be able to perform all the necessary work 
the human female have an ovary bilateral 
if all the condition be right -PRON- may be able to reproduce -PRON- but in do so -PRON- be subject to a thousand adverse condition 
the giant termite reproduce at will any of -PRON- cell and when -PRON- be ready divide -PRON- central intelligence whatever that may be and form a new individual 
and i suppose -PRON- idea be that all life be like the termite only not so highly organize 
something like that 
-PRON- seem that perhaps the dog the fish bird human being be all simples form of the termite colony 
suzanne understand a while all three be silent 
an oppressive silence seem to hover like a mist over -PRON- 
the sun which have be shine through the library window be now cover by the fog that arise from the smoketorture city 
for all -PRON- accustomed poise bailey bankerville start in to tremble 
-PRON- seem that -PRON- be torture by the effort to think 
the sweat start to break out on -PRON- forehead 
dammit 
oh 
dammit 
i be try to think of something and -PRON- elude -PRON- 
something about -PRON- and the giant termite and i can not get -PRON- out 
can -PRON- help -PRON- adam fry can not 
i have have the same feeling for a week 
that be why i come to -PRON- 
there be something there that i ought to see but for the life of -PRON- i be unable to 
i feel -PRON- 
-PRON- just come so far up to the threshold of consciousness and then -PRON- sink back without cross 
i have be unable to sleep because of -PRON- 
i think -PRON- with -PRON- vaster experience in the mystery of the world could fathom -PRON- 
and then susanne bankerville jump up and begin to dance around the room like a twirl dervish 
and as -PRON- twirl -PRON- sing have -PRON- 
i have -PRON- 
oh 
i and -PRON- start to laugh hysterically 
then -PRON- throw -PRON- into -PRON- brother lap and sob 
the rich man look over -PRON- shoulder towards adam fry mind -PRON- -PRON- say softly 
-PRON- get this way sometimes 
i suppose that -PRON- would call -PRON- psychic or something 
usually -PRON- very well worth while what -PRON- say when -PRON- be able to say 
finally the sister sit up and wipe -PRON- face as -PRON- say 
silly and all that but the idea be too big for -PRON- 
but -PRON- be what -PRON- man be hunt for 
i just know -PRON- be 
-PRON- say mr fry that all life have a certain pattern and the pattern and the old and most perfect pattern be the giant termite 
-PRON- say -PRON- be form of million of little white ant and then -PRON- say that each little termite be form of little cell in make -PRON- comparison with man -PRON- say -PRON- be on a par with the giant termite but -PRON- give -PRON- too much credit 
-PRON- be simply on the level physiologically and psychically with the little termite 
-PRON- have no initiative no spontaneous ability to control -PRON- action 
i can not explain -PRON- but i believe that all the people in the united state be simply little termite the city be large colony house 
the city be connect with road rail even air route but over all the million of inhabitant be a central intelligence that govern and direct 
no -PRON- can not be god not as i understand god 
there be a central intelligence for each nation mexico france turkey germany russia 
and the people of each nation be just like those poor little blind termite that sacrifice everything for the good of the nation 
i do not believe that the central intelligence of the human national animal be as clever as intelligent as the central power of the giant termite 
-PRON- be not so old and -PRON- do so many silly thing 
russia be try to put into force some of the habit of the termitary 
-PRON- call -PRON- communism 
now that be -PRON- idea 
the two man look at each other in silence 
finally the rich man say not a very pleasant thought adam fry to feel that one and all of -PRON- human being be just run around do what -PRON- be tell to do by a central intelligence that be not god and that have not even the brain of a giant termite 
not pleasing but -PRON- sound as though if be true 
i feel that this be the thought i have be look for 
the world have to be save from those white ant 
meantime the human race poorly govern badly direct expend -PRON- strength fight ing among each other while all the time the termite terror become more real 
the brother turn almost fiercely on -PRON- sister what do -PRON- mean susanne by a central intelligence govern the united state and another one govern mexico 
do -PRON- mean the political power the combine thought and determined purpose of the people the will of the mass to rule a combined psychic impulse jointly hold by the entire nation 
nothing of the kind be the determine reply if life have one pattern and the giant termite be the pattern then everything -PRON- say be nonsense 
mr fry say that souderman prove positively that the little termite be hopeless and helpless and all -PRON- have to do and all -PRON- could do be to obey the order of the supreme intellect i think -PRON- call -PRON- the central intelligence 
-PRON- do just what -PRON- or -PRON- say 
the queen lay so many egg and when -PRON- say enough -PRON- kill and eat -PRON- 
the egg be develop into so many worker so many outside warrior so many internal policeman so many nymph accord to -PRON- order 
if food have to be secure the colony defend a new termitary form then -PRON- order and -PRON- obey 
if -PRON- be too many -PRON- command that a certain percent be eat 
not in a single instance as far as i can learn from -PRON- talk and from what hear of book be there the least suggestion that at any time -PRON- be capable of independent thinking or action 
in the scale of life in this uniform pattern of existence -PRON- man and woman correspond to the little helpless blind insignificant termite and if this be true then -PRON- have nothing whatever to do with -PRON- government 
-PRON- may think that -PRON- have but that be just delusional ideation if -PRON- will allow -PRON- phraseology 
no doubt -PRON- president be select rather like the queen termite be 
when the central intelligence be through with -PRON- -PRON- be throw out of tlje white house and kill as wilson be 
well go on with the argument 
this be grow interesting 
-PRON- be all little termite and have nothing to do with -PRON- life or action 
all be control by a high central intelligence 
be -PRON- god 
no 
less than god 
of course 
far less than even the central intelligence of one little colony in south africa 
where be -PRON- will answer that say fry suddenly interrupt 
one of the thing that souderman fail to do be to actually see the ruler of a termitary 
mark -PRON- -PRON- talk to one 
-PRON- be convince that there be one 
-PRON- be sure that -PRON- be able to talk to each other and that there be perfect accord and a communicated harmony between -PRON- but -PRON- never see one 
-PRON- say that no man have ever see the inside of a colony house 
that be -PRON- mean entirely 
-PRON- do not know how deep -PRON- extend into the earth 
but down there somewhere in the termitary be this central control force 
i have the blue print of all of -PRON- instrument the study -PRON- make of the two language one the command tongue and the other use for the intercommunication of the ruler be preserve for -PRON- on phonographic record 
souderman actually talk to the and talk back 
now if all life have the same pattern and -PRON- could actually see this that rule a colony house then -PRON- may be able to at least imagine that something like that rule the separate human termite nation 
these thing that rule -PRON- may be powerful but i fancy that to a great extent -PRON- be stupid 
lay plan throw -PRON- sister off -PRON- lap and start to walk the floor 
suddenly -PRON- exclaim perhaps -PRON- be all wrong 
surely if the three of -PRON- be just little helpless termite of humanity -PRON- be do a lot of criticism of -PRON- central intelligence 
-PRON- be do a lot of independent thinking 
perhaps sister be mistaken 
that be a logical statement answer fry 
but -PRON- must remember that the animal of which -PRON- be a part be still in a very experimental stage 
i do not think that conversation dream and criticism such as -PRON- have be indulge in would be possible between three little white ant 
-PRON- have have all such independent initiative crush out of -PRON- by million of year of communistic life 
-PRON- motto be one for all 
the all for one disappear from -PRON- life many century ago i feel that -PRON- seem independence be simply a proof that the animal that -PRON- be a part of be in a very early stage of -PRON- intellectual development and -PRON- all know that man be nearly the last animal to appear on the earth 
-PRON- be pleased to say -PRON- be the great and most highly develop while in reality -PRON- be probably the weak of all the earth pattern just as the giant termite be the strong 
nevertheless since -PRON- have the thought that -PRON- be supreme -PRON- can at least play the game bravely 
-PRON- may be govern by the supreme force i think schopenhauer call -PRON- the claude bernard speak of a morphological plan another philosopher call -PRON- the of all cause i do not care what -PRON- call -PRON- personally be in favor of fight the battle out to the end 
-PRON- may get the bad of -PRON- 
if -PRON- could look into the future -PRON- may recognize even now the hopelessness of the struggle but as -PRON- be why not fight 
three of -PRON- all loyal to each other and consecrate to the betterment of -PRON- fellow 
then there be souderman brave old man flee to a cold country so -PRON- knowledge can be preserve 
-PRON- can be count as number four 
that sound good to -PRON- say bankerville -PRON- have be a long time since i have have a vacation 
time to start something 
the more danger there be in -PRON- the better pleased i will be 
any suggestion as to -PRON- line of attack think that -PRON- ought to try and solve the question of just what the central intelligence of the giant termite really be 
that will help -PRON- in -PRON- effort to understand and influence the same motive or govern force in the human national termite if -PRON- idea that there be such a force be correct 
i believe that an expedition to africa at the present time be sure to be a dangerous one but that be the only way to start -PRON- 
i have the exact location of the giant termite that order souderman to leave the country 
that be the one to go after 
-PRON- will duplicate machinery for listen and convey sound and then after -PRON- have learn the high language -PRON- will talk to this and if -PRON- escape alive -PRON- may have secure sufficient knowledge to communicate with the central intellectual power of this nation and see if -PRON- can not drive some common sense into -PRON- thick skull 
miss bankerville -PRON- have be of the great help to -PRON- but -PRON- must not go to africa 
-PRON- have no idea of the danger 
if a man like souderman be thoroughly alarm over the situation -PRON- be certainly no place for a woman like -PRON- to be 
the girl but no -PRON- be every bit a woman now and a fighting one walk over to adam fry and take hold of -PRON- shoulder as -PRON- say what do -PRON- think i be mr fry 
here i have be fret -PRON- life away in the city for over a year and now at the first chance i have have for real sport -PRON- say -PRON- be too dangerous 
-PRON- and brother need -PRON- 
do -PRON- know that i can speak seven foreign language do -PRON- realize that i have a flair for language a real appreciation of sound 
i have to go with -PRON- donot brother 
-PRON- have never go alone have -PRON- brother 
-PRON- would be cruel to force -PRON- to stay 
now -PRON- all settle and i be sure -PRON- feel better know that i have decide to give up new york society for -PRON- company start on those record 
i be thrill with the idea of actually listen to a termite talk especially a giant termite that be million of year old 
bailey bankerville throw up -PRON- hand in wellsimulate hopelessness 
-PRON- see how -PRON- be fry 
this girl have boss -PRON- ever since -PRON- be a walkytalky baby 
i guess the only way to get rid of -PRON- be to take -PRON- with -PRON- 
i be go to send for -PRON- clothe and -PRON- will be -PRON- guest till -PRON- start 
i think i will send a long message to the librarian of the congressional library warn -PRON- to carefully protect that manuscript 
-PRON- would be a good idea for -PRON- to make a few hundred photostatic copy and distribute -PRON- throughout the world 
i be go to send for some manufacturer of scientific apparatus and start -PRON- to work on those acoustophone that souderman use in listen to the conversation of the termite 
i think that -PRON- will be a good idea to hire a few expert philologist and one or two entomologist 
-PRON- need a firstclass staff of scientific worker at least to start with 
i feel that the closer -PRON- keep -PRON- secret the well for -PRON- because i do not think -PRON- will help any to broadcast -PRON- intention 
hell bell 
if those white ant can read a telephone directory -PRON- may be able to read the newspaper 
go to work a man of training to think be to act 
-PRON- convert several room of -PRON- house into a workshop and instal over a dozen scientist all of whom be famous in -PRON- particular line 
the phonograph record be reproduce and several set send out to strategic point in the northern part of the world 
work be start on the scientific apparatus that be necessary 
an improvement be at once make in the sight machine and instead of a few foot of vision obtain by souderman over ten foot be now possible 
fry bankerville and susanne work at fever heat 
-PRON- seem as though time be a valuable jewel not to be waste in any way 
not until the third evening be there any relaxation and then for some unaccountable feminine whim miss bankerville drag the unsuspecting adam fry to the roof garden of the bankerville mansion 
-PRON- be a beautiful evening a lovely location and a supremely attractive woman 
adam be really not to blame if -PRON- try in any way to duplicate the conduct of -PRON- namesake of the garden 
however such a procedure be far from -PRON- thought 
for the time be -PRON- could think talk and dream of nothing but the termite 
the woman realize this 
at the same time -PRON- be a woman 
those termite seem almost devoid of emotion mr fry 
-PRON- certainly be 
of course -PRON- may have thought that be unknown to -PRON- but mainly -PRON- life be a cold cruel materialistic one 
then there be no love as -PRON- know -PRON- doubt -PRON- 
the entomologist escherich be fortunate enough to open a royal apartment and observe -PRON- for a few minute before the alarm be give 
-PRON- draw a picture of that apartment and -PRON- inhabitant which i have be see in -PRON- sleep -PRON- haunt -PRON- like a nightmare 
souderman have a copy of -PRON- and -PRON- use to study -PRON- 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- be very true to life 
-PRON- see the queen a large inert white creature a feminine god create for one purpose only the laying of an egg every second 
in a large ring around the outer side of the room a solid ring of enormous warrior be constantly on guard 
a ceaseless line of worker deposit drop of food into the mouth of -PRON- motionless sovereign 
other worker seize each egg as -PRON- drop wash -PRON- and carry -PRON- away to the nursery 
around the queen small policeman guard -PRON- from any possible attack 
for five year -PRON- lay an egg a second 
then -PRON- usefulness over -PRON- be deprive of food die of starvation and be like all other dead termite ejiten 
susanne shudder be glad that i be not a termite queen 
have -PRON- a husband 
yes a poor little insignificant thing 
-PRON- be only a small fraction of -PRON- size and spend most of -PRON- time hide underneath -PRON- to avoid be eat by the worker 
-PRON- be think that -PRON- fertilize -PRON- egg after -PRON- void -PRON- 
susanne shudder again 
this gesture draw -PRON- closer to adam fry be glad -PRON- say that -PRON- be not a termite male 
and adam fry reply that -PRON- be glad that -PRON- be just human being able to look up to the star and smell the flower and know what the love of life really be 
after a month of hard work the scientific expedition be ready to start to africa 
a special steamer have be charter and load with everything necessary to promote success 
there be two airplane and the same number of competent pilot 
laboratory worker entomologist linguist and one expert in poison that may be applicable to the termite if danger present 
probably few expedition have be so thoroughly equip in such a short time 
-PRON- be still summer time and the plan provide for a start on the first of august 
a strange attack i be the last of july 
the boat be all ready 
-PRON- be the last night the three conspirator be to spend in the bankerville mansion 
the talk that night be not about termite but of the social change that would take place in the world if the control force of the nation could be discover and influence for the good of the common people 
about ten several terrific explosion be hear and the entire house be rock on -PRON- foundation 
earthquake ask fry 
earthquake nothing 
that be some kind of dynamite or hellsbell 
hear those shout 
sound like a mob 
that be a queer thing 
first time i know anyone have -PRON- in for -PRON- 
-PRON- will investigate this later on 
the thing to do now be to get out and do -PRON- quick slip out through the garden and back to the car and beat -PRON- to the boat 
i smell smoke perhaps -PRON- be try to set fire to the house 
here fry take a gun and -PRON- susanne take this pair of automatic 
thank goodness -PRON- know how to use -PRON- 
now let beat -PRON- 
and in the darkness that just precede the flare that tell of the burning of the house -PRON- rush to the automobile and down to the ship 
once on board the ship bankerville start to telephone to the various member of the expedition to join -PRON- at once 
all night -PRON- stay at the phone give a thousand order and not once do -PRON- make any remark about the attack on the house 
before daylight all be on board and order be give to start down the bay 
-PRON- be not till the ship be several hundred mile out from new york that -PRON- seem to notice the other member of the party 
-PRON- unable to help -PRON- in -PRON- complete absorption of the various problem arise from the sudden leaving have spend part of the night listen to the news that be come over the radio sun of new york 
newspaper be still in existence but many million of urbanite receive all the news of the day over radio newspaper and a part of the equipment of the ship consist of a radio and television news service 
the three bailey bankerville -PRON- sister susanne and adam fry gather in cabin before breakfast 
what happen last night sister -PRON- ask 
enough 
an unorganized mob for some reason attack -PRON- house 
some member of that mob have dynamite 
-PRON- blow up part of the house set fire to all of -PRON- plunder what -PRON- could and badly handle all the servant 
three of -PRON- people be kill include jame the butler 
the police be at once notify but by some mistake go to the wrong part of the city 
by the time -PRON- be on the job the damage be do 
the fire department come out but the mob cut the hose line 
there be a terrific riot 
-PRON- be the belief of the reporter that the three of -PRON- be bury under the ruin of the house 
apparently -PRON- quick getqway fool -PRON- 
there the police be at a loss to understand the reason back of the attack 
several of the rioter be arrest but could give no explanation for -PRON- conduct 
-PRON- simply say that for some reason -PRON- have to do -PRON- -PRON- see a crowd run and -PRON- run along 
the editorial comment be rather peculiar 
there be a good deal of talk about the rich oppress the poor and the possibility of communism spread throughout the united state 
-PRON- appear that there be a suspicion that the fire department and the police be in sympathy with the rioter at least -PRON- handling of the entire matter be very inefficient 
the police commissioner be go to make a special investigation 
-PRON- state that for some reason there be hundred of traffic violation at that time of the night at least ten time more than normal and -PRON- man be so busy try to get thing fix on the street that -PRON- could not handle the riot as well as -PRON- may have on other evening and of course that in -PRON- be peculiar 
the president have come out in a guarded statement say that there have be a great deal of criticism of the government by certain class of the financial aristocrat and that whenever that happen the low class feel privileged to do as -PRON- please 
-PRON- all look like a mess to -PRON- bailey 
what do -PRON- think about -PRON- adam fry ask the banker 
well of course i do not know much about the way the common people feel concern -PRON- and -PRON- wealth but the suddenness with which this happen the dazed condition of the prisoner -PRON- inability to understand what -PRON- be all about the coincident traffic difficulty the fact that the police go to the wrong part of the city the cutting of the fire hose and even the statement of the president all seem to -PRON- to point to one thing 
and what be -PRON- that -PRON- man think demand susanne 
the two man look at each other guess -PRON- think the same donot -PRON- finally ask the banker 
have to 
what else can -PRON- think 
well go ahead and say -PRON- say the sister rather peevishly 
oh simply this finally say fry 
the central intelligence of this united state the ego or whatever -PRON- call -PRON- that -PRON- talk about when -PRON- compare the life of a nation to the life of a giant termite well that central power wherever and whatever -PRON- be grow tired of -PRON- independence and original thinking and criticism of -PRON- stupidity and inefficiency and -PRON- order a lot of worker to go and destroy -PRON- 
lose -PRON- be just what i think say bankerville emphatically 
of course i would not have think that some month ago but -PRON- really be a beautiful demonstration of -PRON- hypothesis 
no doubt many of those people from the president down think -PRON- be act on -PRON- own initiative whereas in reality -PRON- be just obey order like the worker or soldier in a termitary 
for some reason -PRON- be able to think a trifle faster than the central power 
of course if -PRON- have know -PRON- be in that automobile or here on the boat all night -PRON- could easily have go ahead with the killing 
-PRON- be capable of a good many thing but -PRON- be not omnipotent by any mean 
the three of -PRON- be perhaps insulate in some way against -PRON- power 
-PRON- irritate -PRON- but -PRON- can not get rid of -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- feel about -PRON- like a human being feel about a begin cancer 
now the question arise as to what -PRON- next move be go to be 
will -PRON- think that -PRON- be dead under the burn building 
or will -PRON- be able to locate -PRON- on the ship 
if -PRON- can perhaps -PRON- can command the crew to mutiny and kill -PRON- here 
-PRON- can easily find out where -PRON- be head for as the ship clearance be for cape town 
what do -PRON- think -PRON- have well do susanne believe -PRON- have well get lose 
what do -PRON- mean 
can -PRON- depend on the crew to be loyal believe so 
most of -PRON- have be with -PRON- before 
then send a wireless out to the effect that the ship under order leave new york last night but that the three leader of the expedition be miss and -PRON- be believe that -PRON- be kill in the riot 
a few hour later send an that the ship be sink 
then send another that the situation be hopeless and the crew have take to boat 
then put the crew to work paint a new name on the ship and change -PRON- generally 
slip into some little south american port and bribe the port authority to give -PRON- false clearance paper and just go out on the seven sea as a tramp steamer 
no use go to cape town for there be all kind of reason that -PRON- will be wait for -PRON- there not only the giant termite but the representative of the central human termite power 
no doubt the english and american power be in sympathy 
well -PRON- would control australia 
certainly but -PRON- would not go to any port and even if -PRON- do -PRON- would not be recognize in -PRON- new disguise 
maeterlinck say that at cape york australia large group of termitarie can be see from shipboard 
-PRON- have have an exciting twentyfour hour but -PRON- must not lose sight of the fact that the main reason for this expedition be to find just what the real ruler of the giant termite really be like 
-PRON- decide that -PRON- have to know that in order to come to any understanding of the same force in the national termite go on and do what -PRON- start out to do 
-PRON- entire plan sound like common sense susanne say -PRON- brother 
do -PRON- know fry that this little woman be right just about all the time wonder why that be ask fry 
that be because i be a woman reply susanne 
-PRON- know -PRON- be right because -PRON- use intuition instead of reason in arrive at -PRON- decision 
during the next two week progamme be carry out to the letter 
gold bribe a central american port official 
dirty linen unshaved face completely change the appearance of the officer and crew 
all enter into the spirit of the game and -PRON- be hard to tell bankerville from the most villainous seaman 
susanne as the cabin boy make a thoroughly hardboile lad 
several time -PRON- be stop by american and english war ship but in every case -PRON- general look and false paper be sufficient to fool the inspect officer 
whenever this happen fry and bankerville would look at each other silently while susanne in -PRON- cabin would execute a real horn pipe 
hot diggity dog -PRON- would exclaim 
guess the little girl know -PRON- onion 
-PRON- be certainly after -PRON- but so far -PRON- have -PRON- fool 
bankerville give order -PRON- finally come to australia 
-PRON- take another week of careful sailing to locate cape york 
several mile out -PRON- be force to anchor but the termite colony could easily be see through glass 
there be hundred of -PRON- rise many foot in the air in every possible shape 
after -PRON- long trip the crew look at the peculiar coast line with a great deal of interest 
-PRON- be dusk and bankerville give order that under no circumstance should any one leave the ship for any purpose 
then -PRON- call a meeting of susanne adam fry and the captain 
as -PRON- gather in -PRON- cabin -PRON- almost shout well -PRON- be here now 
the voyage be over 
then -PRON- start to write on a piece of paper signal to the three that -PRON- should watch -PRON- and this be what -PRON- write believe that -PRON- destination be know to the various power that be determined to destroy -PRON- 
the only way that -PRON- can escape from -PRON- be to think faster than -PRON- do 
i be sure that -PRON- can hear the vibration of the voice over great distance and that be how -PRON- come near kill -PRON- in new york city 
i want -PRON- to think that -PRON- be here and go to stay 
in reality -PRON- be go to wait till dark and then slip out to sea 
to the east of -PRON- be the new hebride 
there be thirty island in this group but only twenty of -PRON- be inhabit as the termite be so bad on some of the small one that the inhabitant have despair of grow anything 
one of these uninhabited island be call whitsunday and that be where -PRON- be go 
do -PRON- understand 
the three silently nod 
bankerville silently hold the paper in -PRON- hand strike a match and burn all -PRON- have write 
three hour later the tramp steamer raise anchor and slowly steam eastward 
four day later -PRON- find a pleasant and safe harbor on the east side of whitsunday island 
-PRON- be over seven week since -PRON- have leave new york 
during the voyage -PRON- destination have be change three time 
now -PRON- hope that in this safe harbor of an isolate uninhabited country -PRON- could start in -PRON- study of the giant termite and the occult power that rule -PRON- 
the harbor be so small and yet so deep and landlocke that -PRON- be decide to keep on live on the steamer and make regular visit to the termitarie which even from the ship be plainly visible some be eighteen and twenty foot high 
some apparatus be send ashore but as most of -PRON- be portable -PRON- be think advisable to carry -PRON- back and forth each day 
that night bankerville for the first time have a staff meeting of all the scientist 
these gentleman have not be at all idle on the trip but have spend long hour of study some at the extensive library on the termite other learn the language from the phonograph record while the poison expert dabble in -PRON- laboratory concoct new and deadly liquid and gas to use if necessary 
as usual bankerville rule this meeting 
-PRON- be a natural ruler and while -PRON- always consult fry and -PRON- sister still when there be a public meeting of any kind -PRON- allow no doubt as to who be in command of the expedition 
gentleman -PRON- say suppose -PRON- all be aware of the real purpose of this expedition 
-PRON- be here to make a complete and thorough study of the giant termite 
some of -PRON- have peculiar idea of just where this study will lead -PRON- but irrespective of those view i would urge all of -PRON- to be true to -PRON- scientific education 
if -PRON- observation fail to show that souderman be right in some of -PRON- idea i want -PRON- to say so 
for example -PRON- may arrive at the conclusion that what souderman think be a language be simply a coincidental conglomeration of natural sound proceed from the termitary and not in anyway connect with mental process of any kind or form of life 
-PRON- must remember that souderman lead an isolated antisocial life for many year 
-PRON- think of nothing see nothing hear nothing except -PRON- be in some way connect with the termite 
under these circumstance -PRON- be entirely possible that -PRON- may have have hallucination 
-PRON- make double record but the giant termite talk back to -PRON- may have be nothing but the other side of -PRON- dual personality 
in other word -PRON- may have have the split nature the true schizophrenia of the paranoid praecox 
in all of -PRON- scientific study of the termite remember these thing 
if one of -PRON- make a discovery do not accept -PRON- as the truth but see if three or four of -PRON- fellow be able to arrive at the same conclusion independently of each other want -PRON- also to always bear in mind that -PRON- feel there be a possibility that -PRON- be here deal with a personality that be very old and very intelligent 
-PRON- may be that the thing -PRON- call the brain of the giant termite be far more intelligent than -PRON- be 
-PRON- have no trouble in kill johanson in africa to keep -PRON- from spread the fact about -PRON- dual language 
-PRON- trace souderman to new york and eat -PRON- manuscript 
be on -PRON- guard 
because -PRON- be so small always out of sight do not underestimate -PRON- power 
because -PRON- never see a thing happen do not think that -PRON- can not happen 
-PRON- be cunne 
-PRON- have be know to eat a picture frame and all and at the same time cement the glass to the wall to keep -PRON- from fall and wake the people in the room 
with such insect the only safe way be to remain constantly alert 
there be no tell what -PRON- will do next 
as the old copy book say eternal vigilance be the price of safety feel that -PRON- should finish this work as soon as possible but -PRON- do not want to finish -PRON- before -PRON- be through 
by that i mean that -PRON- do not want to be force to leave 
the least relaxation of caution the slight break on -PRON- part may be the mean of drive -PRON- from -PRON- work on this island 
i want each of -PRON- to make as much progress in -PRON- speciality as possible but at the same time i want all -PRON- work to bear on one problem 
have the giant termite a central force or intelligence 
if -PRON- have be this something like the mind of man simply a high form of a central nervous system or be -PRON- some occult power 
whatever -PRON- be be -PRON- above or below the mentality of the human being 
can this central force be understand apprehend by the sense of man by sight hearing touch or be -PRON- something in a new dimension that may be think of but would not be tangible like object in the three sensual dimension 
this be the problem that have bring mr fry and -PRON- to this island and -PRON- want to stay here till -PRON- have a satisfactory answer to at least a part of the question 
finally i want -PRON- to recall that -PRON- be dodge the influence of some peculiar occult power that have threaten -PRON- since that fateful night in new york 
so far i think that -PRON- have be able to keep one move ahead of that power but at any time these influence may find -PRON- 
i be go to ask -PRON- to be very careful of -PRON- own feeling 
if -PRON- become angry mad at one of -PRON- fellow man report the matter at once to either mr fry or -PRON- 
-PRON- may be that -PRON- desire to harm -PRON- fellowman be a desire that be put into -PRON- by this occult power 
there may be even mutiny 
please think of this 
remember that -PRON- success have a large influence on the future hope of mankind 
the next day -PRON- start to work 
to -PRON- continue -PRON- be an esplanade two mile long 
-PRON- be face southwest a mile high and the view be magnificent 
-PRON- be above the southern end of central park but new york city be go manhattan be a wellkept meadow mile wide two mile long and two i mile high be eight cubic mile 
eight floor to the hundred foot or four hundred to the mile give three thousand two hundred square mile of floor space 
this be as large as an ancient cityforty mile long and twenty wide cover solidly with house four story high and no part of -PRON- be more than two mile from any other part 
obvious answer but not enthuse 
-PRON- do not click -PRON- shrug -PRON- guide 
the phrase intrigue -PRON- and i stare at -PRON- 
-PRON- be neatly uniformed in dark olivedrab like a hotel bellboy but few bellboy have such a chin and none such eye of flash dark intelligence 
try -PRON- from another slant -PRON- say 
-PRON- have no traffic problem 
what be -PRON- population ask 
about eighty million 
-PRON- be not overcrowded sneer 
-PRON- take -PRON- seriously 
eight hundred floor -PRON- say about a hundred thousand to a floor 
that twentyfive thousand to the square mile and forty person to the acre 
-PRON- give a thousand square foot of floorspace to each 
that be enough 
where do -PRON- get -PRON- light 
-PRON- fling -PRON- hand upward 
i think the passage flood with sane twentyseven 
the room be large about twenty foot by thirty and white 
-PRON- have a low divan across one end and hold two or three easychair and table but be on the whole sparsely furnished 
the young man wave -PRON- to a chair and sit down -PRON- see no window 
how do -PRON- get ventilation 
i ask 
compress air be release near the floor 
-PRON- go out into the passageway through that ornamental steel grate over the door 
in summer -PRON- expansion cool the room 
-PRON- keep a brisk cool even temperature all the year round 
here be the electric heater if -PRON- want more warmth the fan if -PRON- want a breeze 
this be the bathroom door 
here be the light switch here be the graph 
what be a graph 
-PRON- look at -PRON- intently think -PRON- universal in the world -PRON- say at last even pardon -PRON- on farm 
do i look like a farmer 
not in the least -PRON- answer but be an explorer i smile have be away from -PRON- modern city for a long time 
many thing in -PRON- ultramodern civilization puzzle -PRON- 
explain as if i be a child 
please by -PRON- confidential tone -PRON- answer press this black be briskly 
butdaylight but now i see that the light rise from behind a narrow cornice and be reflect from the white tile of the ceiling to those of the floor 
helium tube -PRON- say exactly the same quality and intensity as sunshine 
here be -PRON- room 
-PRON- unlock a door and set -PRON- suitcase inside 
i motion -PRON- in after -PRON- come from far away say and be behind the time 
make sure before -PRON- go that i can understand -PRON- convenience 
what for instance be the number of -PRON- room -PRON- answer and hand -PRON- a tag key then translate floor four hundred south section passage fifty room present story be one of the most extra ordinary one which -PRON- have be -PRON- good fortune to read in year 
-PRON- be another one of those that will make history 
as -PRON- read the story -PRON- be not certain whether the author be serious or whether -PRON- laugh up -PRON- sleeve at the failure of the human race in general particularly when -PRON- come to the big problem of transportation and human conduct in large center of population 
one of the strange if not the strange phase of -PRON- civilization be find in -PRON- city transportation 
the automobile which be suppose to save -PRON- a great deal of time on account of -PRON- speed have be signally defeat in -PRON- large city and even the mediumsize one 
today the automobile as a vehicle to move people speedily have signally defeat -PRON- 
due to the very large number of automobile -PRON- effectiveness have be nullify and in -PRON- big city -PRON- can walk short distance much quicker than ride 
the author of this story must be give credit for have develop a most unusual as well as original idea which be not only original but highly plausible 
the city which -PRON- plan do away with all traffic problem as -PRON- know -PRON- today and -PRON- be constantly ask -PRON- the question yes why not 
indeed -PRON- believe this story to be prophetic because sooner or later some such city as foresee by this talented author will come about 
-PRON- only hope that the author unll have some similar treat in store for -PRON- in the future ton dictate against this disk and take the print record from this drawer 
press this white button manipulate this dial and speak to any person in the city or ask for central and get any person in the world 
reverse the switch and get music or lecture on the first button or any book or play -PRON- like on the second 
the rear of the disk throw the image of the person -PRON- speak to or the movingpicture of the play or book upon that mirror 
-PRON- speak of a newspaper 
the same disk with this second switch throw 
push button for numbered table of content then manipulate the dial and hear and see what news -PRON- wish 
what happen if i make a mistake 
if -PRON- be -PRON- own return everything to zero and try again 
if -PRON- be a mechanical mistake like leave both switch down everything return to zero automatically 
what be the fee for this 
include in the rent 
excellent 
where do i eat 
synthetic liquid food from the dial icewaterfaucet in the bathroom 
-PRON- be make automatically in bulk so cheaply that there be no charge for -PRON- 
busy people live on -PRON- for week at a time but -PRON- lack bulk and vitamine 
real meal be serve at any restaurant along the passageway 
thank -PRON- i say will not keep -PRON- longer and hand -PRON- a quarter 
-PRON- look at -PRON- long and curiously then spin -PRON- away spring to the graph and begin to dial trembling with wrath 
room -PRON- bark cartex speaking 
send police 
attempt bribery 
i may have try to soothe -PRON- but -PRON- fall back into -PRON- chair unconscious 
i try to go to -PRON- but have just strength enough to stagger to a chair -PRON- 
interrogate to find two quiet stranger in the room 
the one bend over cartex remark there be a little too much gas have to wait 
-PRON- voice be very calm 
what be -PRON- all about officer 
i ask 
what do -PRON- do counter -PRON- own man gently 
give -PRON- a tip 
-PRON- always tip the bellboy where i live i answer 
the two policeman eye each other and i take a long look at -PRON- 
-PRON- have the same prominent chin as cartex and eye of dark intelligence and be dress much as -PRON- be 
-PRON- be however agreeably unexcited 
what be a tip ask one 
money for carry -PRON- suitcase explain the custom still survive in central africa comment the other 
do -PRON- live there 
no though i have be there 
i live in new york 
cartex man raise -PRON- eyebrow and answer this be new york 
before i have recover from this thunderbolt -PRON- go on uganda keep the custom because the black there feel -PRON- inferior to the white 
here there be no such social strata 
cartex misunderstood 
the insult be too great 
where there be no intention to be insult there be no insult 
cartex look intelligent 
-PRON- will forgive -PRON- 
what do i do -PRON- assume that cartex be -PRON- social inferior -PRON- 
certainly not 
cartex be a dramatic student work along to a degree 
but even so a coin or two from one who have a large income -PRON- income be the same 
by the way let -PRON- see -PRON- service card 
-PRON- need -PRON- name age place of origin and datum 
what be a servicecard 
the two man look at each other again and there be so long a pause that during -PRON- cartex wake up 
-PRON- do -PRON- thoroughly and all at once like a kitten 
cartex say learn from this man that i be rude to -PRON- by offer -PRON- money for service render 
i do not understand 
i beg -PRON- pardon 
-PRON- do not mean to bribe -PRON- explain -PRON- man 
there be another pause while cartex visibly control -PRON- and consider 
at last -PRON- smile 
then there be no offense -PRON- decide withdraw charge 
excellent say -PRON- man 
come tell the judge 
the stranger have no servicecard 
where do -PRON- find -PRON- 
walk along this passage with -PRON- key in one hand and a suitcase in the other 
-PRON- ask the way to -PRON- room 
where be the suitcase snap the other man 
-PRON- search the whole apartment but could not find -PRON- 
what do -PRON- do with -PRON- -PRON- man demand at last 
nothing i answer 
cartex set -PRON- just inside the door 
i have not see -PRON- since 
ruffle by this -PRON- take -PRON- along a hundred yard of passageway and enter an elevator in silence 
how do -PRON- manage an elevatorshaft two mile high 
i ask cartex 
-PRON- donot -PRON- say 
-PRON- break the trip every few dozen story 
and ease the pressure on -PRON- waterpipe by tank every few story also i suppose 
i continue 
of course agree cartex 
the court have graph and dictaphone enough and very few spectator but otherwise -PRON- be much like -PRON- idea of such place form from the illustrate paper 
the judge be a quiet thin cleanshaven courteous man in a black gown more like a highgrade surgeon than a judge 
-PRON- order -PRON- seat in a very comfortable metal chair upon a rubber mat under a very powerful arclight then flash blue lightning at -PRON- from under -PRON- white eyebrow and ask why i be there 
lose in time 
i say that there be some informality about what the quiet gentleman with the heavy shoe call a -PRON- young friend cartex also prefer a charge of bribery against -PRON- but courteously withdraw -PRON- on learn that i have no such design 
explain say the judge to cartex cartex do what be -PRON- name the judge then ask -PRON- 
griswold lee answer where be -PRON- bear 
baton rouge louisiana jan 
the keen thin tired face of the judge suddenly change 
-PRON- interest in -PRON- have be professional 
now -PRON- be personal and vivid 
where do -PRON- live 
brooklyn i say and give -PRON- -PRON- address on remsen street 
what be -PRON- occupation 
first soldier then after the war explorer and freelance imaginative writer 
the world would not believe -PRON- discovery in thibet when i present -PRON- as fact so i be compel to dress -PRON- up and sell -PRON- as fiction 
how do -PRON- get here do not know judge 
twenty minute ago i be sit at -PRON- desk in brooklyn write an article 
suddenly i find -PRON- walk down a passageway in this hotel with a tag roomkey in one hand and -PRON- suitcase in the other 
i look around for the bellboy who should be with -PRON- but find no one 
then i meet cartex 
what be the subject of the article 
the probable development of the ultramodern city 
the judge look at -PRON- too intently for comfort 
then -PRON- ask a quiet man in onepiece tan overall who be sit at a keyboard watch a plotted curve inspector can -PRON- detect a hiatus the man look up and shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- have so keen and kind a face that i like -PRON- 
there be no hiatus -PRON- answer 
when an impossible statement be make under the veriscope the judge explain speak with clearcut precision only one course be open to the court to detain the subject for observation by competent alienist 
mr delusion that -PRON- be in a twentiethcentury hotel be clear 
mr lee permit -PRON- to compliment -PRON- selfcontrol 
-PRON- have pass through some unknown experience so drastic that -PRON- have not only deprive -PRON- of -PRON- servicecard but have obliterate from -PRON- mind all memory of -PRON- and of -PRON- personal identity and still -PRON- retain mental poise and balance 
-PRON- give -PRON- great regret that i have no choice except to commit -PRON- to a psychopathic hospital for observation upon the charge of inurbanity 
i be require by statute to ask if -PRON- have any request to make before this be do 
-PRON- would be a great pleasure to see -PRON- city judge say and cartex who i understand be a dramatic student work through college as a bellboy be kind enough to overlook -PRON- involuntary rudeness and withdraw charge thus make -PRON- -PRON- friend 
if cartex may be assign to guide -PRON- cartex rise to object but the judge speak first 
there be no hiatus -PRON- say mr lee accurately state both -PRON- opinion and -PRON- wish 
-PRON- may be of assistance to a diagnosis to act upon -PRON- 
have doctor gray arrive 
here sir nervously answer someone from the door 
mr lee go on the judge cartex and doctor gray have long be friend 
-PRON- will act as -PRON- escort 
the suspect defect 
doctor be inurbanity 
-PRON- may familiarize -PRON- with the detail of the case from the newspaper 
verdict suspend and subject remand to the care of cartex and dr gray 
next case 
dr gray come over and speak to -PRON- 
-PRON- be dress much like cartex a keen pleasant dapper little man middleage with a brown beard and hair and eye 
-PRON- clip -PRON- word as if in a hurry 
when 
cartex join -PRON- the doctor lead -PRON- out into the passage 
there be so much -PRON- need to tell each other -PRON- begin that -PRON- have well go where -PRON- can talk 
where shall that be 
the sunparlor be not crowd at this hour suggest cartex 
in a cubic city nothing be more than two mile from anything else 
the average distance be about half a mile 
the doctor be of a methodical as well as a nervous turn of mind for as -PRON- stroll along -PRON- lay down line along which -PRON- be to talk 
i do not fully follow -PRON- because a woman and two child in rosesilk knit bathingsuit and slipper come out of an apartment and saunter along the passageway in front of -PRON- 
-PRON- make a charming little group not out of place on any seabeach but singular indoor 
then suddenly -PRON- breath be take away for the passage debouch on a great esplanade forty foot wide and two mile long roofed floored and wall with glass 
roof and floor be translucent so that -PRON- could see other level under and above -PRON- 
at first this make -PRON- dizzy but one soon grow use to -PRON- 
-PRON- have come out about halfway up the wall face southwest so that -PRON- be a mile high and the view be magnificent 
-PRON- look across north river and new jersey exactly as one might from an airplane 
i have be up in an airplane over new york more than once so that i recognize the terrain 
but i recognize nothing else 
-PRON- be above the southern end of central park but new york city be go 
manhattan island be a wellkept meadow grass treed and park 
-PRON- seem to have receive another shock say dr gray 
sit down 
i explain to -PRON- i look around 
the inner half of the glass floor rise a trifle and be fill with steamer chair and in these chair bask in the spring sunshine lie quite a number of people in bathing suit while other stroll along the pathway 
sunbather say the doctor 
the glass be the cubic city be two mile wide two mile long and two mile high 
-PRON- have eight hundred floor and be as large as the ancient city forty mile long and twenty wide 
-PRON- population be eighty million quartz glass and let in the actinic ray 
everyone who can get the time take a sunbath every day 
all doctor prescribe -PRON- 
the place do not seem crowd i remark 
the population of this floor be a hundred thousand 
-PRON- have eight mile of glass promenade all expose to the sun ray every day 
-PRON- could accommodate a hundred thousand recline chair but -PRON- find two row of twenty thousand each enough except on sunday 
the sunbather on week day be mostly woman and child 
cartex tell -PRON- -PRON- have a thousand square foot of floor space to each citizen 
do -PRON- not waste too much of -PRON- on these sunbath 
about sixteen square foot each 
if -PRON- take more -PRON- would be worth -PRON- but cartex refer to space inside the building 
these gallery be extra 
-PRON- board of health find -PRON- indispensable 
not only do -PRON- cure disease but -PRON- form the good possible way to detect -PRON- 
people in bathing suit can not conceal much about physical condition from a keeneye doctor 
-PRON- catch and cure most thing before -PRON- be well start 
but be not the suit a little er extreme 
i ask watch a couple of girl stroll by 
-PRON- have some regulation shrug the doctor but as a general thing -PRON- policy be to let all do what -PRON- like so long as -PRON- do not interfere with other people 
if those girl be ugly the art department would drop -PRON- a hint if -PRON- seem likely to become immoral -PRON- would be regulate instantly by child welfare -PRON- canot have unauthorized baby if -PRON- appear unhealthy the health department would put -PRON- through a clinic but as -PRON- be if -PRON- like to expose a few more square inch of young complexion than do most nobody care 
i dare say cartex bathing suit be scanty 
hush doctor warn cartex lay a finger on -PRON- own lip or read the paper 
so far as i can understand -PRON- case dr gray i say -PRON- be to examine -PRON- for insanity or inurbanity whatever that be and through the courtesy of the judge -PRON- be show -PRON- the city and observe -PRON- reaction as the easy way to make a diagnosis 
be there nothing i can do to assist -PRON- to a belief that i be sane 
tell -PRON- just how -PRON- get here answer the doctor which i already know from the judge -PRON- can not do can come pretty near -PRON- answer although of course only by inference since i remember nothing 
doctor have -PRON- ever summon up picture in -PRON- mind 
no man discover anything without do so 
i c dr gray put in cartex be one of -PRON- foremost mindspecialist and have even make an improvement in the veriscope -PRON- 
although ill from overwork -PRON- have assume the duty of an assistant interne because of the great singularity and interest attach to -PRON- case mr lee 
then if -PRON- can grasp -PRON- oldfashione technical phrase -PRON- may perhaps help -PRON- 
-PRON- have be -PRON- habit doctor to picture mentally the scene i be describe 
when i make a forecast i concentrate until i see -PRON- 
this power have grow with practice until quite recently -PRON- have become independently pictorial 
i mean that in imagine a scene i do not have consciously to create the detail 
-PRON- fill -PRON- in often quite accurately 
for instance in a recent dispute as to the presence of a large stone in a salmon pool which i have never see i close -PRON- eye willed to see the stream from above pick out the pool mentally descend to the bank look and find the stone there also a pine which nobody have mention but which both -PRON- companion recall when remind 
the sensation be exactly that of visit the place and the result be about the same 
-PRON- explanation to -PRON- be that i read telepathically the picture in -PRON- mind 
the thing be not clairvoyance because i do not go into a trance 
however i have be greatly puzzle lately by unexplained small object in -PRON- room 
in one of these scene i choose to image to -PRON- i pick a violet and later find a newly pluck wild violet in -PRON- finger 
i lay -PRON- on -PRON- desk and turn away and when i look back -PRON- be go 
amuse by this i imagine treasurescene in the past in which i help -PRON- to gold and jewel 
i bring -PRON- back with -PRON- and watch -PRON- fade after an hour or so 
i could see no gain in tell another observer 
autohypnosis vivid as -PRON- would necessarily be telepathic 
whether what i see be there or not the other observer would see -PRON- too and the practical danger be great 
today i photograph several object just bring back send the film to be develop then settle down to finish a promise article for jeem on the probable development of city in the near future 
i be intent on the most interesting part when i look up and find -PRON- here 
the suitcase which -PRON- hand -PRON- be real put in cartex real heavy and utterly ancient 
do nothing which -PRON- bring back stay 
i learn much i -PRON- hand into -PRON- pocket and produce the usual thing notebook billfold penknife cigarette light and silver and even copper change 
cartex go into ecstasy over each article and pronounce -PRON- all genuine antique of the twentieth century 
among the penny be a gold turkish coin apparently very ancient 
where do -PRON- get that ask cartex do not know that -PRON- be still there 
i see no reason at all for -PRON- to believe -PRON- but i pick that coin in imagination out of the treasurechest of an elizabethan buccaneer 
i think -PRON- have vanish like the other 
-PRON- believe -PRON- perfectly mr lee break in the doctor 
-PRON- have no doubt at all of -PRON- sincerity 
-PRON- have see -PRON- under the veriscope of course -PRON- do not for a moment dream that -PRON- perfectly sincere account of -PRON- be correct but -PRON- be search together with -PRON- for the fact 
perhaps say -PRON- will help if -PRON- tell -PRON- how this great change in citybuilding come about 
at least -PRON- will assuage -PRON- curiosity 
the financial life of a skyscraper be about twenty year answer the doctor although the mere physical life ought to be century 
-PRON- alter quickly 
-PRON- be make large and still large 
invention of the helium lamp give real daylight remove the need for window 
the drift of population to the city become an avalanche 
problem immense and sinister such as the world have never see before arise and be grapple with one by one and solve all but the problem of lateral urban transportation 
how many streetlevel in two answer cartex for -PRON- 
wilson on transportation say that bridge streetcrossing for pedestrian do not come into general use until and then on main street only 
sidewalk between crossing be not raise until some year later 
whatever the date of separate improvement shrug dr gray -PRON- come too late 
the grow population overtake -PRON- all and clog -PRON- 
yet inside the great building which continue to grow large there be no congestion because there be no need of lateral transportation 
everything on any one floor be within easy walk of everything else 
man take an elevator to whatever floor -PRON- want then walk to -PRON- destination 
therefore each building tend to be more complete in -PRON- contain everything but sleep quarter 
at last -PRON- become economical to add a floor or two and give janitor shopgirl elevator boy repair man and such person dormitory in the building 
the custom grow until half the city be house in the same building in which -PRON- work but since by that time the population have more than double this do not ease congestion in the street 
some help be gain by throw bridge from build to building but these become congested too 
bridge be throw then from every floor of every building and so the cubic city be evolve 
the rest be detail 
what limit the size of -PRON- cube to two mile air pressure 
-PRON- find a difference in vertical height of two mile about all anyone can stand 
approximately the same limit be place by horizontal distance 
a mile and back be about as far as -PRON- be practical to walk 
how many cubic city have -PRON- in the united state about three hundred in the world 
new york be the second large 
what be the large 
london 
jerusalem 
-PRON- be the near to the centre of land surface of the globe 
when the suez canal become congested past enlargement -PRON- blast channel to the mediterranean and red sea make jordan valley a saltwater inland lake and the safe harbor in the globe and internationalize palestine 
the consequent growth in population make a vast cubic city necessary 
internationalize certainly 
the world be govern by a league of city 
what be the population of the globe 
about three billion 
since -PRON- discover how to extract synthetic food from plant -PRON- could support a trillion but -PRON- judge -PRON- best to limit -PRON- number and improve -PRON- quality 
-PRON- can cure all disease except some form of cancer but -PRON- can not remove inherit stupidity 
cure all disease 
what be -PRON- average life then 
about a hundred and fifty year 
what be -PRON- average index of intelligence 
for the normal population theta 
for all include the subnormal zeta 
for new york city kappa do not understand -PRON- table of rating 
-PRON- divide the mental distance between the great genius and the stupid person whom -PRON- be quite sure be sane into twentyfive part 
the average man in the whole world be one third of the way up 
cartex rate sigma 
sure enough there be a little badge on cartex lapel which i have mistake at first for a button then for a greek fraternity pin 
doctor gray rate tau smile cartex bowing or do before -PRON- illness 
-PRON- may do better now 
and how would -PRON- rate -PRON- doctor 
i ask 
above -PRON- except for -PRON- delusion answer doctor gray politely 
as -PRON- be i be afraid that -PRON- must be classify as subnormal 
cartex gasp 
a revelation no -PRON- say not that doctor on a side classification perhaps abnormal perhaps but not subnormal 
i never see a case further from inurbanity 
still what can one do where there be obsession shrug the doctor 
isolate -PRON- insist cartex 
first isolate -PRON- then cure -PRON- 
-PRON- turn to -PRON- 
admit for the moment griswold lee that -PRON- belief be right and that -PRON- have come here from two century ago by unknown subjective method how do the situation strike -PRON- 
-PRON- be here now 
the fact of -PRON- arrival be so plain that the method of -PRON- be comparatively unimportant 
be -PRON- not clear what -PRON- decision must be 
be not -PRON- proper course to apply for a servicecard take up the work for which -PRON- be most fit and become a useful and a loyal citizen drop into the background even in -PRON- own mind the unsolved mystery of how -PRON- come 
to learn and labor truly to get -PRON- own living and to do -PRON- duty in that station of life to which -PRON- have please god to call -PRON- 
i misquote smile 
-PRON- be quite right 
of course -PRON- be 
there doctor triumph cartex 
when an obsession can be so easily mentally isolated as that -PRON- be no longer dangerous 
-PRON- seem intensely interested in this stranger object doctor gray am doctor nod cartex though not as -PRON- imply 
-PRON- name -PRON- as -PRON- friend in open court not know 
i have have admiration all -PRON- life from other man and sometimes even affection but never honest friendship 
-PRON- have grow mutual think the gentleman have two obsession 
think -PRON- in silence then shrug cartex or i shall be -PRON- enemy for life 
what smile the doctor sadly be a poor official to do 
on the one hand i must brave -PRON- displeasure or on the other i must release upon society a man who really on two count be not urbane 
what be this tnurbanity i ask 
when people crowd together in cubic city answer doctor gray -PRON- find that -PRON- be possible to commit a great many offence for which there be no law 
-PRON- therefore make law against such thing as hawk and spit giggling loud laughter talk in raucous voice bad temper and a thousand other like matter 
these law could not be enforce 
any good lawyer could clear -PRON- client for -PRON- be all matter of degree dependent upon manner time and place 
yet any one who do not choose to keep -PRON- could make all comfort quite impossible for hundred round -PRON- 
a few such man and woman comparatively a few could have destroy -PRON- rise new civilization 
therefore -PRON- lump these thing under the head of tnurbanity 
people with ist and ism criminal people mentally ill without be quite insane people incurably boorish and stupid people with complex and phobia people deform all people in short who bother other too much and will not or can not change be class as inurbane 
in a safe simple painless way -PRON- be make incapable of bear child and be confine for life in humane institution outside the city 
most of the institution be almost empty 
-PRON- have no longer any criminal class 
-PRON- have no insane no idiot no crippled or deform no one with inheritable disease no drunkard nor drugaddict and very few extremist of any kind 
also no rebel i suppose say and no reformer 
plenty of both bow the doctor 
cartex here be a great rebel against dramatic convention and every new scientific discovery mean drastic reform but every rebellion and reform must be courteous and urbane 
how then shall i become urbane ask personal consultation should be private remark the doctor and reach over -PRON- -PRON- raise a lever in a little machine upon a stand beside -PRON- which machine i have mistake for a radio 
quite the most urbane thing -PRON- have do yet -PRON- go on be to give -PRON- a good excuse for shut off the newsservice 
i ask 
do -PRON- not know that there be several million people watch and listen to -PRON- flash cartex 
the doctor and i be make for life professionally by the publicity of -PRON- association with -PRON- 
-PRON- have become worldfamous 
-PRON- coming be worldnew be make for life emotionally also beam dr gray 
the lady whom i love must marry -PRON- or indeed -PRON- wonot say cartex indignantly 
-PRON- marry for love only 
doctor -PRON- be inurbane 
the doctor start to -PRON- foot so angrily that i think -PRON- best to take command 
doctor sit down i suggest 
even in -PRON- poor day anger be inurbane 
cartex a bellboy even a student bellboy should not speak so to an eminent physician 
what be the secret -PRON- two be discuss over -PRON- head and under cover of gesture with -PRON- handkerchief i turn the machinelever back on say there be two inhibition sneer the doctor 
nonsense return cartex 
-PRON- be the most natural thing in the world 
-PRON- have not see another of -PRON- woman except in a sunbathsuit 
-PRON- shall not hurt -PRON- 
no woman now live have ever receive or be in a position to receive so great a compliment honest sincere friendship from a real fighting man spoil the situation 
cartex -PRON- little devil i break in 
-PRON- look like a boy talk like a boy act like one but be -PRON- a boy 
what do -PRON- think dimpled cartex face -PRON- 
take off -PRON- coat say -PRON- do so and stand in -PRON- trouser and a silk shirt 
must i take off -PRON- shirt master -PRON- ask have a sunbath suit under -PRON- 
which would -PRON- rather do take -PRON- off or come here and let -PRON- put -PRON- arm about -PRON- 
both decide cartex 
cartex protest doctor gray too loudly for politeness be dramatic 
inurbane should if i be not flash cartex from the hollow of -PRON- arm 
-PRON- know i can do anything in reason and be forgive 
griswold lee say the doctor visibly control -PRON- cartex be one of -PRON- good comedy actresse a darling of the metropolitan stage 
-PRON- can care nothing for -PRON- 
-PRON- have not know -PRON- long enough 
-PRON- must be try to attract -PRON- to -PRON- to share in -PRON- enormous publicity 
but -PRON- have go too far 
-PRON- jeopardize -PRON- position 
restrain -PRON- 
-PRON- must be act but to those who love -PRON- such action be not comedy 
cartex unless -PRON- marry -PRON- i must report this man inurbane

-PRON- darle gasp cartex turn around in -PRON- arm and kiss -PRON- 
-PRON- lightolove snarl the doctor only -PRON- paraphrase -PRON- 
then -PRON- strike at -PRON- 
there seem only one thing to do so i do -PRON- 
the doctor disappear under a chair drum with -PRON- foot a little and lie still and sunbathsuite woman from a hundred lounge jump up and scream 
run for -PRON- 
run gasp cartex 
where ask this way 
-PRON- room 
the way seem to be along a passageway just around a corner and down an elevator 
cartex employ the moment pause while wait for the elevator and step into the car dress just like any other woman who have be sunbathe except that -PRON- be barefoot 
the elevator girl recognize both of -PRON- but do not know anything have happen 
cartex lead -PRON- to a door unlock -PRON- and shut -PRON- both in

the graph before -PRON- blur then clear again as the door break in 
i tighten -PRON- arm around -PRON- wife and go on visualize -PRON- own room 
then slowly i find -PRON- sit at -PRON- desk in brooklyn with -PRON- landlady cling to -PRON- 
-PRON- would make another story as long as this to tell how i make the dear lady all the necessary explanation go into detail scrupulously 
so -PRON- decide that -PRON- have better marry -PRON- 
-PRON- have go out to live in the country 
-PRON- be as happy as the day be long except for one small inurbanitya quite unnecessary one for i have now fall out of touch with the gentleman in thibet under whose auspex i once study

address all communication and make out all check to park place new york city jl f2 vw tmm the column of soldier be wind -PRON- way across the plain in the direction of the beleaguered fortress 
in the center march the infantry and on either side a column of fanray machine on leverlike leg spread a fan of ray over the soldier half the population of the planet venus hurl -PRON- across the void of space at -PRON- own world believe -PRON- be go to find a new home here i be one of the first prisoner -PRON- take 
as a matter of fact i fall into -PRON- hand before one of -PRON- have set foot on earth when -PRON- first bulb be still foot above -PRON- 
-PRON- be a cloud bank that prove -PRON- undoing 
-PRON- of the airguard have have -PRON- warning but be uncertain as to what to expect 
the observatory of the rockie alps ande and himalayas have note the mysterious object burst out of the cloud envelope of venus on orbit obviously calculate to bring -PRON- within the gravitational influence 
there could be no question but that some humanlike intelligence be back of the mystery 
the observatory flash -PRON- warning to the central astronomical board which in turn report to the supernational commission of the caucasian league in geneva 
but the board go astray in -PRON- interpretation of the phenomenon 
-PRON- theory be that the several thousand hurtle bulb or sphere photograph by the observatory be projectile contain explosive or some other agency of destruction 
actually -PRON- house from to man of venus apiece flee -PRON- planet 
-PRON- be try to escape annihilation by volcanic force that have get out of control after several century of increasingly ambitious use 
about half the population of venus lack the courage to face the terror of interplanetary space in a desperate gamble for continue existence 
presumably -PRON- perish in the doomsday which follow and which be visible to -PRON- observatory as terrific disturbance and upheaval in the venusian cloud envelope 
of the other half who exchange -PRON- few remain week of existence on venus for the desperate chance of hit a pinpoint in space and find -PRON- habitable after hit -PRON- relatively few reach the earth 
have a majority do so i question whether -PRON- could have withstand -PRON- so successfully with -PRON- terrible weapon 
-PRON- would have overwhelm -PRON- by sheer number in any event of course but man would have die by the hundred of million and the rest of -PRON- would have return to the dark age if -PRON- have not be able to overcome -PRON- before -PRON- derange that delicate balance of production commerce finance and social structure that -PRON- call civilization 
from what i learn as a prisoner -PRON- astronomer actually discover only fifteen or twenty percent of the total number of bulb launch 
altogether more than of -PRON- be hurl toward the earth carry about venusian 
the total population of -PRON- planet be only slightly over only of these bulb with crew aggregate actually reach earth 
thousand of -PRON- be shatter by collision with meteoric body 
thousand more be deflect from -PRON- course by unforeseen gravitational influence exert on -PRON- and -PRON- hurtle on into space past the earth 
still other thousand be estimate by the invader -PRON- to have miss the target through error in calculation and the imperfection of hurriedly construct space gun 
but to begin at the beginning i be patrol the air lane above northern mexico about a hundred mile south of the texas line with tubby baine handle the radio and telescope while eggy morris sit at the gun of out this be then the new type of plane in the air guard a ship of remarkable balance and steadiness for those day with an easily sustainable speed of mile an hour and a cruising radius of mile 
as far as the eye could reach and the scope too for that matter the air be fill with patrol ship each circle the territory of -PRON- beat and wait for -PRON- know not exactly what 
the bulb be due to arrive at any time now 
from one end of the continent to the other and throughout europe the supernational red cross division have be mobilize relief organization 
city population have be be the versatile author of arrmg geddon and the air lord of han with a brand new thrilling story 
there be those author whose chief claim to -PRON- attention be -PRON- imagination and those who in addition be inventor of no mean degree 
the present author be a combination of both and in addition -PRON- know how to create action story that be difficult to match anywhere 
mr phillip have a knack of invent new instrument that be as new to literature as -PRON- be to science and there be no denying that -PRON- scientific creation be plausible and will be duplicate when the various art have catch up with -PRON- scientific prognostic cation 
-PRON- be always most interesting to -PRON- to speculate on what would happen if some alien intelligence from another world grant that -PRON- exist would invade this planet 
many author have try -PRON- hand at such a theme but few be as forceful and versatile in picture such a conflict as be the present author 
in addition to this -PRON- show convincingly the importance of terrestrial condition as -PRON- will be experience by alien invader order to scatter temporarily into the open 
-PRON- would not do to have one of these bulb hit closely massed million if -PRON- be explosive 
-PRON- order in the air guard be indefinite 
-PRON- be to patrol watch report and stand by for further order 
-PRON- be to spot any hit of the interplanetary projectile so that relief may be rush to point need with the least delay 
-PRON- be all at a pretty high tension 
far above -PRON- to the south be a big cloud bank and -PRON- be in the middle of the afternoon that tubby sing out to -PRON- the general order -PRON- have just pick up 
all randall be to rise out of position and head south a hundred mile at whatever level be necessary to carry -PRON- above the cloud blanket 
observation -PRON- seem indicate that most of the oncome bulb be fall toward the tropic 
i nose upward in a long easy slant that take -PRON- into the cloud bank 
once in -PRON- -PRON- could not see forty foot ahead but i keep the randall rise at full throttle for i know there would be no other plane within mile at this level 
capture tell just how -PRON- all happen -PRON- take place so rapidly but i be conscious that -PRON- plane be entangle in a vast mass of billow canvaslike material 
-PRON- close around -PRON- in overwhelming fold as -PRON- bury -PRON- in -PRON- and bring up with a sicken lurch face bear an expression of ludicrous surprise as -PRON- spreadeagle over -PRON- shoulder sail over the rail and disappear scratching desperately for a handhold as -PRON- slide down a trough in the billow fabric 
that be the last i ever see of -PRON- 
i have no recollection at all of what happen to eggy 
i never see -PRON- again 
for a moment i clung to the rail as the randall slowly turn over 
then i lose -PRON- hold and slide with increase momentum down one of the fold of that vast envelop fabric a human insect lose in a chaos of drift canvas foot above the earth 
-PRON- hand touch a rope 
i hold desperately to -PRON- and find -PRON- with -PRON- other hand 
a short distance below -PRON- in the fog i hear a crash evidently the randall collide with something bulky and metallic 
then silence 
gradually the sea of canvas straighten out 
i know then that i be cling to the edge of a vast parachute 
but -PRON- whole mind be center on selfpreservation 
i have no time to wonder 
i go down the rope hand under hand until below -PRON- in the mist loom a section of a great metal dome 
with -PRON- foot plant on this more substantial support i pause to regain -PRON- breath and gather -PRON- together 
-PRON- do not yet occur to -PRON- that i have find one of the interplanetary bulb 
like everyone else i have -PRON- set in -PRON- mind that these would turn out to be explosive projectile 
moreover i be completely daze with the suddenness of -PRON- all 
mistily the metal dome curve downward in one direction 
in the other i see a rail a few foot away 
i throw -PRON- toward -PRON- and climb over with a sigh of relief 
the whole structure be sway sluggishly and be sink i be sure 
but -PRON- have not fall below the cloud as yet 
then a hatch nearby flip open 
three man climb hastily out 
-PRON- be clothe in what look like diver suit cover -PRON- from shoulder to foot and over -PRON- head be large goggled helmet 
-PRON- surprise evidently be equal by -PRON- own for -PRON- pause to survey -PRON- amazedly through -PRON- big goggle 
then one of -PRON- signal the other and all three of -PRON- leap upon -PRON- like wildcat 
take utterly by surprise i go down under -PRON- rush 
i be hustle down through the hatch which clang over -PRON- head and literally rush down a corridor into a compartment that look like a combination of control room and engineroom on one of -PRON- own big dirigible 
the ship for now i know i be aboard some sort of strange aircraft be crowd 
-PRON- captor have to fight -PRON- way down the corridor with -PRON- 
some of the crew through whom -PRON- push be clothe in diver suit and goggle helmet like -PRON- 
other wear sleeveless belt tunic that reach the knee and -PRON- look to -PRON- as though -PRON- have emerge from flour barrel 
-PRON- skin be dead white as white as grecian statue 
but -PRON- eye be yellow and -PRON- close cropped hair a tawny orange 
in the center of the control room be a big instrument table at which a marblewhite man sit surround by illuminate screen upon which appear shift picture 
occasionally -PRON- would reach over and twist a lever or flip a switch 
-PRON- captor stand respectfully wait for -PRON- attention 
finally -PRON- look up and stare at -PRON- with pierce yellow eye that look out from a finely chisel face that may indeed have be marble from -PRON- total lack of color 
but -PRON- have little time for -PRON- then 
-PRON- wave -PRON- hand and turn back to -PRON- instrument 
-PRON- captor hustle -PRON- off to a little compartment where i be lock in 
later come a slight jar 
the ship have come to rest on the ground 
there be a clanging of door and rushing of foot babel of voice and harsh command and the sound of heavy machinery be haul around 
-PRON- captor reappear and literally drag -PRON- down a spiral companionway to the low deck of the ship and thence into the bright light of day 
squat gun cough i around in amazement 
i have emerge from a great metal sphere about foot in diameter 
around -PRON- be the great activity 
some fifteen hundred helmeted figure have spread out over the plain 
split up into discipline group -PRON- be busily set up what appear to be numerous searchlight and squat broadmouthe antiaircraft gun of complicated design 
in the sky above gather a host of plane of oun air guard circle around puzzle by what -PRON- see below 
have -PRON- only drop -PRON- bomb then much bloodshed among -PRON- own people could have be avoid but quite naturally in this day of civilization -PRON- do no such thing 
-PRON- have report to washington and have receive order to make friendly overture to the strange newcomer 
one of the plane drop below the formation and begin to spiral down 
a few foot away from -PRON- one of the squat gun cough 
a blind flash appear some fifty foot away from the circle plane which be irresistibly suck into -PRON- 
there be a miniature thunderclap and the twisted incandescent wreckage of the plane drop like a stone 
another gun cough hollowly and another blind glare of light appear this time in the middle of the formation above 
-PRON- suck in three plane and -PRON- broken twisted remain also plunge earthward 
then -PRON- plane dive -PRON- motor roar 
there be a sudden consternation among the whiteskinne man around -PRON- 
gun cough frantically 
hastily aim bomb flash blind even when see against the bright sky 
two more plane collapse but the rest dive on 
more gun cough 
the attention of -PRON- guard divert for the moment i hurl -PRON- headlong toward the near gun whose crew be about to discharge -PRON- 
i catch the foot of the creature whose hand be reach out toward the firing mechanism upset -PRON- and roll instantly to -PRON- foot tug at the automatic in the holster on -PRON- thigh 
i get -PRON- out in time to fire point blank at another who leap at -PRON- 
-PRON- reel and i notice as -PRON- go down that though the skin of these strange people be white -PRON- blood be red enough 
i take toll of seven before -PRON- finally pin -PRON- down and -PRON- little diversion at least keep one of -PRON- gun out of action while the plane spray the group of soldier with a leaden hail cut -PRON- down by the score 
then the plane zoom again to comparative safety 
by now however the invader machine that look like searchlight get into action 
-PRON- spread fanlike beam of iridescence overhead 
these beam the operator quickly wove into an interlock network make virtually a continuous cone of pulse light -PRON- base the circle on which the machine have be set up and -PRON- apex about a thousand foot in the air 
the plane of the air guard return to the attack this time drop bomb as -PRON- pass overhead 
i break into a cold sweat 
i know the power of those bomb and figure -PRON- life in term of split second 
then an amazing thing happen 
the downrushing bomb bounce off the conecurtain of light as though from an invisible rubber wall and explode harmlessly 
not even the fragment shower around for these too bounce off in -PRON- turn 
but the invader be close to panic from the earsplitte force of the explosion and -PRON- manipulate -PRON- cough gun in very ragged fashion 
through the uproar -PRON- leader rush about angrily beat -PRON- back to the post -PRON- have abandon 
i see more than one of -PRON- strike down a man with -PRON- short heavy sword 
not until the air guard plane have expend all -PRON- ammunition do -PRON- withdraw to the foot level where again -PRON- circle watchfully 
altogether seven plane of the air guard have be shoot down 
about three hundred of the man of venus lie kill and wound within the circle 
all these casualty however have be suffer prior to the formation of the protect light cone which have throw off bomb and bullet alike render the second attack of -PRON- plane quite futile although seemingly terrific 
ultimatum 
i activity on the part of the invader follow the withdrawal of the air guard squadron 
a vast mass of machinery be remove from the sphere which actually be take apart in the process 
-PRON- plate and beam have be cleverly design as interchangeable part of other machine and constructive apparatus 
quickly interchangeable at that 
i donot think -PRON- take more than an hour or so for the thousand man of venus who be not casualty or assign to the task of minister to the wound to completely demolish the great bulb in which -PRON- have arrive on earth 
in -PRON- place there arise giant crane and complicated machine which begin to dig and handle material in huge masse with uncanny skill and accuracy 
in the center of the circle be erect a cylindrical apparatus which prove to be a boring machine 
by some complicated process that be beyond -PRON- comprehension -PRON- begin to dig a great well the displace earth literally flow from opening in the side of the thing 
as the mound of earth grow around -PRON- the cylinder automatically rise in the center of this mound 
other machine which squat like huge metallic insect occasionally raise -PRON- on leglike lever to change -PRON- position reach out with great extension arm that terminate in universaljointed paddle or hand each probably fifteen foot across and scoop vast quantity of the earth toward the outer part of the mound 
before long the remove earth assume the proportion of a hill 
the circular battery of fanray machine be move outward the number of machine be augment by constantly assemble addition 
then i notice that the character of the earth flow from the boring machine be change 
in a few minute molten lava be pour out of the broadlippe spout 
there ensue unusual activityon the part of the shovelhande machine whose operator with a skill that hold -PRON- enthral manipulate the liquid stone absorb the heat from -PRON- with accessory apparatus and shape -PRON- as -PRON- harden 
night fall and the glow of the lava light the scene weirdly tint the dead white body of the invader 
by now -PRON- be mostly strip 
with the setting of the sun -PRON- have begin to remove -PRON- protective diverlike suit and goggle helmet and for the most part be clothe only in fullcut short trouser not unlike kilt that extend in pleat from highly ornament broad belt to a point several inch above the knee 
there be many woman among -PRON- 
in fact about a third of -PRON- be woman but there be no distinction between -PRON- dress or lack of -PRON- and that of the man 
both man and woman wear -PRON- tawny yellow hair close crop 
nor do there seem to be any division of labor among -PRON- that be base on sex 
all be work under high pressure at various machine except the executive those who be tend the wound and the three guard who never let -PRON- get beyond -PRON- reach 
-PRON- permit -PRON- free movement however within the confine of the circle so long as i do not approach any of the machine too closely or get in the way of the bustle party 
that more would be hear from -PRON- plane that night i know well 
the tradition of the air guard particularly the american division do not embrace much consideration of the principle of watchful waiting 
i have just look at -PRON- watch -PRON- be nine oclock when something white a little weighted parachute float down right through the cone of the fan ray which spread a faint iridescence through the air above -PRON- 
a whitebodie girl approach -PRON- hesitatingly inspect -PRON- where -PRON- lie and at last reassured pick -PRON- up and run with -PRON- to the commander 
i know what -PRON- be a note an ultimatum offer truce or war to the invader 
when the commander look casually at -PRON- hand -PRON- back and with a word wave the girl away i have a pretty good idea of what would follow 
the air guard would be watch through -PRON- night scope and probably would get a good view of -PRON- action for -PRON- be stand well in the open and in the glow of the lava 
a moan from above swell into a roar 
-PRON- heart skip a beat 
-PRON- be one of those twoton inflammite bomb 
the bomb drop previously be as pill by comparison 
that -PRON- would burst through that inverse magnetic film of the fan ray by sheer momentum i have no doubt 
but -PRON- didnot 
with a horrible whooping shriek -PRON- rebound to one side and detonate two or three hundred foot away the shriek and the stunning detonation blend in a vast earsplitte sound 
the fanray film throw off the big steel can and -PRON- fragment but -PRON- offer no resistance to the force of the explosion 
the people of venus nearest that side of the circle be literally blow from -PRON- foot and lie mangled and bleed 
there follow a period of silence no less stunning than the explosion 
then the invader leap to work 
under snarl bark command of -PRON- leader -PRON- rush to replace several of the fanray machine that have be blow from -PRON- mount while the operator of the remainder raise the angle of -PRON- beam to make the cone as large as possible 
fluttering and swinging jiown through the film come another little parachute message 
-PRON- commander do not have to know any earth language to grasp -PRON- meaning 
but -PRON- do not seem to 
or if -PRON- do no other course than ignore -PRON- enter into -PRON- calculation 
again -PRON- wave aside the bearer of the message angrily 
the invader once more be near panic but -PRON- discipline hold 
suit and helmet be don hastily 
the cough gun be man and begin to hurl -PRON- queer suction bomb upward into the black night 
these projectile i notice pass freely through the fanray film 
hell from heaven a the circle machine be hastily man to drive diagonal well into the ground 
in these the ray machine be place for safety 
the work that be accomplish in the next ten minute be astound 
the man of venus be almost ready for the heavy bombardment when -PRON- break and -PRON- suction bomb be flash with blind rapidity against the dark sky above 
i could well imagine that -PRON- air guard be have no picnic with -PRON- 
-PRON- flashing would have serve to half blind a pilot 
then hell drop from heaven 
one by one at interval of less than a second the twoton bomb fall 
-PRON- be throw off at various angle from the cone film but be set for contact detonation do not rebound to great distance 
i throw -PRON- to the ground with -PRON- arm wrap around -PRON- head and lie there half stunned 
i lose consciousness at the expiration of a short interval 
i donot know how long -PRON- be before i come to 
but as i stagger to -PRON- foot those about -PRON- be do the same 
there be no indication of -PRON- plane overhead and the faint iridescence of the cone film be unbroken 
many of the machine sprawl about overturn and wreck 
and at several spot within the circle i could see part of -PRON- plane which evidently have be wreck by the cough gun 
fully half the original fifteen hundred invader be now casualty 
but the remainder tirelessly take up the task of repair the damage and carry on -PRON- construction work 
and such wonder do -PRON- accomplish with -PRON- strange machinery that dawn rise on a terrace castlelike structure of solid and cool lava circular about a thousand foot across and rise to a squat tower in the center the top of which be some two hundred foot above the level of the plain 
an encircle ring of fanray machine bury deeply in a diagonallycut trench spread -PRON- coneshape faintly visible protection above the structure and far enough away from -PRON- to render the explosion even of such bomb as have be hurl during the night relatively harmless 
i be drag within this fortress and lock in a bare cell from which i have a restrict view through a narrow porthole face the north 
within -PRON- range of vision a few sentry cover from head to foot in -PRON- peculiar suit patrol the terrace pause now and again to gaze through instrument that look like complicated reflex telescope mount on tripods 
but the main body must have be within the wall sleep off -PRON- exhaustion for aside from the sentry i see no one 
exhaust -PRON- i drop to the hard floor and fall asleep 
unearthly colony a deal of history be make in the two month i be hold prisoner 
but i learn little until afterward of the manner in which the invader who have pepper the world with colony similar to the one in which i be incarcerate finally consolidate -PRON- strength in the tropical section of central and south america 
most of -PRON- bulb have descend about a thousand mile north or south of the equator 
several have land in the united state 
some of these have be overwhelm at once when -PRON- crew show fight and before -PRON- could assemble and bring into action -PRON- fanray machine or -PRON- cough gun and suction bomb 
other have manage for several day to stave off the airguard and landguard cordon which close around -PRON- 
one have hold out as long as two week 
once -PRON- fan ray be in operation -PRON- be most difficult to subdue 
in each case where the airguard do not succeed in annihilate themi at the outset with inflammite pill -PRON- finally have to be overpower by mass infantry attack 
in these attack -PRON- guard suffer tremendous loss for as -PRON- pass through the fanray zone -PRON- rifle and side arm be wrench from -PRON- grasp by the repel effect of the inverse magnetic force 
the man be force to cast aside all equipment contain metal of any description and to meet the soldier of venus with bare hand rock and such hastily improvise club as -PRON- could get a hold of as -PRON- advance whereas the planetary invader already safe behind -PRON- magnetic film be not handicap in the use of metal weapon and -PRON- deadly vacuum grenade 
the european division of the caucasian federation be not on the whole so successful as the american in cope with the invader while in asia and other part of the world the invader have thing pretty much -PRON- own way 
later as -PRON- assemble -PRON- aircraft and get -PRON- earthly bearing better -PRON- abandon -PRON- outlying lava fort and mobilize in the tropical region of the western hemisphere where the weather condition be more suited to -PRON- and where -PRON- achieve such concentration of force that the most powerful of the hastily organize attack of the american air guard reinforce from europe be decisively repulse 
then ensue that lull in hostility that precede the final conflict 
but all this be a matter of general history whereas this account be primarily concerned with -PRON- own experience 
skin like fish first week of -PRON- incarceration be rather dull 
-PRON- jailer be a middle aged man of abnormal cerebral development 
most of the food -PRON- bring -PRON- turn -PRON- stomach filthy mess of partially decompose animal and vegetable matter 
there be certain vital physiological difference between the man of venus and those of earth and as a matter of fact the fare that be bring -PRON- be in full conformity with -PRON- standard of wholesomeness and palatability 
-PRON- jailer pester -PRON- continuously force -PRON- to utter the name of everything -PRON- could point but to -PRON- or show -PRON- picture of 
-PRON- have some very clever photographic process that enable -PRON- to take telescopic picture of great clarity and accuracy 
from the name of object -PRON- probe -PRON- for word denote action and so on until much to -PRON- surprise at the end of no less than a month -PRON- address -PRON- one day in halting but unmistakable english 
-PRON- speech have be very hard to learn -PRON- inform -PRON- because -PRON- be so involved and much less direct than -PRON- though -PRON- have the advantage that -PRON- have few word to remember 
this be the gist of -PRON- speech 
i donot remember the exact word -PRON- use except that -PRON- be very funny and also very ingenious in the association of idea through which -PRON- make -PRON- mean clear 
but after this -PRON- do not bring -PRON- food any more 
instead a young girl be assign to the task 
-PRON- inform -PRON- haltingly that -PRON- be learn -PRON- speech 
let -PRON- teach -PRON- i suggest 
-PRON- smile at this but shake -PRON- head negatively can learn more quickly from the miorurlia -PRON- say 
and at the end of another week -PRON- be speak well english than the man have 
-PRON- tell -PRON- i be consider something of a prize for though -PRON- colony have capture several thousand earth man most of -PRON- have rate low in intelligence and -PRON- have only two or three altogether who speak english 
-PRON- name -PRON- say be nyimeurnior 
-PRON- quiz -PRON- untiringly about life on the earth and since -PRON- question cover the entire range of engineering medicine sociology history commerce and dustry as well as political economy i be rather hard put to give satisfactory answer 
but in turn -PRON- freely discuss -PRON- own race with -PRON- 
-PRON- find -PRON- difficult to understand why the food -PRON- have be give -PRON- be nauseate to -PRON- and this lead to a long discussion of many physiological difference between earth man and the man of venus 
that there be such difference i be not unprepared to learn since there be such difference in physical appearance 
on the whole the invader be a trifle small of stature and big of head than -PRON- 
-PRON- forehead be high -PRON- eye a bit large and -PRON- nose mouth and chin though regular and beautifully mold a bit small in proportion 
at that however i have see earth man who could have pass for these people be -PRON- not for the difference of coloring 
-PRON- be as dead white as marble statue except for tawny yellow eye and hair 
and i may mention that -PRON- have no hair anywhere upon -PRON- body except upon -PRON- head where -PRON- grow thickly 
both man and woman wear -PRON- crop very short 
this dead white skin of -PRON- be thick than -PRON- but be also very soft and normally should have be moist not from perspiration but from the absorption of moisture from the air 
this absorption rather than excretion appear to be the principal function of -PRON- pore 
-PRON- could of course and actually do drink a great deal of water during -PRON- life on earth but the sensation be very unpleasant to -PRON- and -PRON- drink only of necessity because -PRON- pore could not absorb from the relatively dry atmosphere of the earth the amount of water -PRON- need 
rule or ruin need considerably more heat also than -PRON- climate furnish anywhere except in the tropic 
this be the reason for -PRON- decision to withdraw those colony which like the one in which i be hold prisoner be locate in more temperate region 
-PRON- be also the reason why -PRON- contemplate no immediate conquest of the earth but plan to remain on the defensive in -PRON- tropic stronghold until such time as -PRON- may better adapt -PRON- to earthly condition and increase -PRON- number 
in the meantime however -PRON- be -PRON- intention 
nyimeurnior tell -PRON- to keep the earth man busy with destructive air raid 
-PRON- have anticipate find the atmosphere different from -PRON- own of course and know that -PRON- would be considerably dry have equip -PRON- with waterproof suit which cover -PRON- from head to foot 
these suit serve the purpose of humidor 
-PRON- be also an absolute essential as a protection from the earthly daylight 
-PRON- atmosphere lack the fog filter of that of venus let through certain ray of the sun which though almost a necessity of life to earth being be rank poison to venus animal and plant life 
do the sunlight never break through the cloud layer of venus 
i ask nyimeurnior 
not ever -PRON- reply quaintly 
-PRON- daylight be very bright and very warm because venus be so much close to the sun than earth 
but the air be very full of water like the fog -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have in other part of earth and like these cloud that sometimes pass above -PRON- here and -PRON- be never -PRON- be able to see for great distance than what -PRON- call a quarter of a mile 
before -PRON- come to earth -PRON- know sunlight only from send what do -PRON- say scientific expedition up through the cloud many many that be a very great distance 
exposure to sunlight even for a very short time be deadly to the people of venus 
i have occasion to observe this for -PRON- later 
-PRON- do not bum -PRON- in the way that overexposure do earth man for -PRON- have no pigmentation in -PRON- skin whatever 
but -PRON- do pull the blood right out through the pore so that after a time -PRON- become horrible spectacle 
but even more deadly than this be -PRON- toxic effect upon -PRON- 
-PRON- derange -PRON- nervous system and stimulate -PRON- to a hysterical fever which be quickly follow by a torpor and if relief measure be not apply promptly by death 
a half an hour unprotected from the ray of the sun would turn the hardy man of venus into a driedout bloodcake corpse 
an hour or two hour in normal daylight out of the direct ray of the sun would do the same though -PRON- suffer little discomfort in go abroad when -PRON- be storm or the sky be heavily overcast 
naturally -PRON- be not happy in the earth atmosphere 
nyimeurnior tell -PRON- that -PRON- wear very little clothing on venus and hate the feel of the humidor suit -PRON- be force to wear out of door in the daytime on earth 
but there be no help for that 
-PRON- simply keep under cover all -PRON- could during the day in -PRON- artificially humidify structure adopt a schedule of night work 
but even at this the chill of the night outdoors be play havoc with the health of the community and before many more day -PRON- inform -PRON- -PRON- would abandon the lava fort and migrate in the airship -PRON- have build since -PRON- incarceration to the city which other community be even now complete in the fastness of the tropical forest of brazil can not understand nyimeurnior i say one day why -PRON- people refuse all overture of peace 
-PRON- earth nation be not bloodthirsty 
-PRON- do not kill for the sake of kill 
there have be many war in the past owe to the fact that man can not always agree on everything but in the main earth man live at peace with one another and i know -PRON- would be willing to live at peace with -PRON- people if -PRON- would show the right spirit 
there be much in which -PRON- could help -PRON- much that -PRON- could teach -PRON- as there be much that -PRON- could learn from -PRON- 
-PRON- would be to the mutual advantage of both race 
the girl look at -PRON- queerly 
-PRON- pretty little mouth close in a grim line 
-PRON- make no reply whatever but arise and leave -PRON- cell immediately evidently in anger 
i never thoroughly understand this attitude on -PRON- part nor have i ever hear that any one else ever do 
during the time i be prisoner i try to suggest the idea of a truce to -PRON- leader as frequently as i could 
but -PRON- seem as though -PRON- consciousness be utterly and mysteriously bar to -PRON- consideration 
the only reply i ever get be a blow in the face or a look betoken a suspicion that i be mentally unbalanced ask -PRON- why 
i canot explain -PRON- 
but certain -PRON- be that from the day the first bulb fall into -PRON- atmosphere until that final day when -PRON- army million strong surge irresistibly through the brazilian forest not once do -PRON- make an overture of peace or indicate that -PRON- would accept any mercy from -PRON- 
-PRON- simply could not grasp the idea that be all 
for several day after i make this suggestion to nyimeurnior -PRON- would not speak to -PRON- 
-PRON- bring -PRON- food healthful earth food now not the sickly mess -PRON- have give -PRON- at first and leave as quickly as possible 
-PRON- be as though i have offer -PRON- some gross personal insult that have fill -PRON- with a loathing of -PRON- 
mushroom ship didnot bother -PRON- much however 
to those who have any personal contact with the invader i donot have to explain why 
but for the benefit of those who never see one at close range i may say that though i find the girl interesting and though i could even go so far as to refer to -PRON- as pretty anything like a romantic interest in -PRON- be an utter impossibility 
imagine if -PRON- can be in love with a girl with a deadwhite moist clammy skin like the belly of a scaleless fish bloodless lip and smoky yellow eye that somehow remind -PRON- of those of a cat although the shape of the eyelid be human enough 
no attitude do not disturb -PRON- emotion in the least though -PRON- pique -PRON- curiosity greatly 
gradually however -PRON- appear to forget the insult 
-PRON- interest in information about the earth serve to renew -PRON- conversation 
perhaps -PRON- be order to resume -PRON- 
-PRON- tell -PRON- about -PRON- airship mushroomlike affair in which the space for the crew and cargo correspond with the stem and the elevate machinery be build into the umbrellalike superstructure 
-PRON- could rise in a straight vertical line like helicopter move slowly and gently or hover motionless 
speedy aircraft -PRON- explain would be suicidal in the fog of venus 
i be amazed at -PRON- description of the manner in which -PRON- be support 
air on the upper surface of the umbrella be destroy by electronic action thus form an upsucke vacuum 
-PRON- be recreate electronically on the under surface of the umbrella thus form a support cushion of compress air which though constantly dissipate be be replenish with equal rapidity 
-PRON- be only necessary to vary the speed of the process to rise or fall 
automatic compensator constantly adjust the vacuum and pressure at various point on the umbrella surface always keep the ship in perfect balance 
if anything go wrong with the electronic apparatus the ship merely cme down like an ordinary parachute 
horizontal propeller furnish motive power 
with the clear air of earth through which to fly -PRON- say -PRON- engineer be increase the ratio of motive power and -PRON- own community have succeed in obtain a speed of mile an hour with -PRON- ship 
this be less than half the speed of -PRON- air guard patrol plane and less than threequarter that of -PRON- bomber 
-PRON- be save -PRON- to teach -PRON- about plane nyimeurnior say 
save -PRON- from what 
i ask 
-PRON- look at -PRON- in surprise 
from death of course -PRON- reply 
why should -PRON- be waste food and trouble on -PRON- if -PRON- could not make use of -PRON- 
would -PRON- not spare -PRON- life from motive of mercy 
i ask 
mercy -PRON- repeat questioningly in -PRON- peculiar pronunciation that be a word -PRON- have not speak of before 
what do -PRON- mean 
i try to explain to -PRON- but quite unsuccessfully 
the good -PRON- could make of the idea of spare an enemy of whom no profitable use could be make be that -PRON- be a manifestation of ignorance or insanity 
i begin to realize that these people have no conception of charity sympathy or kindness as spontaneous emotion although -PRON- approximate the practical manifestation of the emotion from a motivation of expediency 
i delve further and find that -PRON- be unfamiliar with love except as an intellectually selfish emotion 
a husband be kind to -PRON- wife for instance because -PRON- need -PRON- help and cooperation and realize that -PRON- could give this more efficiently under the influence of consideration and comfort than with a mind or body derange by harsh treatment 
if -PRON- lose -PRON- usefulness to -PRON- -PRON- put -PRON- away on a sort of pension arrangement 
-PRON- do not kill -PRON- because that would make other woman fear -PRON- and -PRON- may have difficulty in get another wife 
on the other hand a wife be helpful and considerate of -PRON- husband because -PRON- realize -PRON- be to -PRON- interest to cooperate fully with -PRON- 
and naturally the most kind and considerate of the young man and young woman be in the great demand as husband and wife 
but back of all -PRON- courtesy and consideration be nothing but an acutely develop self interest tie up with a peculiarly keen appreciation of the value of cooperation and an ability to weigh and balance those value undisturbe by emotion far in advance of any similar ability on the part of earth man 
-PRON- have only one true emotion physical fear 
-PRON- be very susceptible to -PRON- 
as compensation -PRON- have a high order of intellectual courage 
the fact that -PRON- have risk a journey through space attest that 
but -PRON- physical susceptibility to fear in moment of emergency be a far great handicap to -PRON- balance and judgment than be the case with the average of earth man 
fear tend to paralyze rather than stimulate -PRON- to action 
intellectually -PRON- steel -PRON- from early childhood against this weekness but with only partial success 
-PRON- be quite plain to -PRON- as a result of this partial insight into -PRON- psychology gain from nyimeurnior that i have -PRON- choice of ultimate death or play traitor to -PRON- country -PRON- world and -PRON- fellow man by teach -PRON- to make and fly airplane 
for strange as -PRON- may seem at first think earth man despite the comparative newness of -PRON- mechanical civilization hold an advantage in the air from a military point of view with -PRON- swift darting plane though -PRON- may be concede that for general convenience and comfort the venus umbrella ship be superior 
have develop -PRON- navigation of the air along totally different line for century the newcomer have nothing more than an elementary grasp of the principle underlie the construction and use of plane 
the judgment of the nyapacleur i no intention however of either turn traitor or sacrifice -PRON- life 
so i begin to maneuver for a chance at freedom 
not long after i have come to this conclusion i be take before the nyapacleur or commander of the community whose position with allowance make for the highly organized and mechanically perfect civilization of venus be not unlike that of a feudal baron 
that be to say -PRON- hold the power of life and death over the entire community 
the member accord to the venus theory owe all -PRON- necessity and comfort as well as -PRON- very live to the skill and strength of -PRON- leadership 
-PRON- in turn owe those life to -PRON- if ever -PRON- should choose to call for -PRON- 
this name be lourmon 
-PRON- be the same before whom i have be take for a brief instant in the sphere which have bring the community from venus 
nyimeurnior and -PRON- first jailer whose name i learn be founyi act as interpreter 
the room in which -PRON- give -PRON- audience be not unlike an office 
-PRON- sit at a kind of desk on which however the usual mass of paper be replace by a number of mechanical contrivance which i judge be various form of record and reporting device 
the air in the room be warm and highly humid 
lourmon naked except for the peculiar belt and short the invader wear and a kind of sandal be such an incongruous figure from -PRON- earthly point of view that i could not help smile 
imagine if -PRON- can a near grecian statue come to life and lean carelessly over a table pile with modern scientific instrument 
-PRON- glance at -PRON- keenly and speak a few word in that soft slur tongue of -PRON- which be a form of language which no race on earth have yet develop except for purpose of writing 
by that i mean that -PRON- be not the original or natural speech of these people but a species of shorthand through which entire sentence and paragraph may be sum up in a single word or two or three word 
one of -PRON- great regret be that i have so little opportunity to learn -PRON- 
these few word founyi translate into nearly five minute of -PRON- slow english reviewing in detail the account of -PRON- capture refer more briefly to the journey of the invader through space and the reason which lead -PRON- to attempt -PRON- outline -PRON- determination and confidence in -PRON- ability to exterminate earth man and take over the world for -PRON- and set forth -PRON- individual helplessness and the wisdom of endeavor to make -PRON- a useful slave if i desire to preserve -PRON- life 
while founyi be translate lourmon clearly impatient at the handicap of such a slow and clumsy language be abstractedly manipulate the lever of a little apparatus which be present to -PRON- a series of picture on a little translucent screen 
at the end of speech -PRON- look questioningly at -PRON- as though take -PRON- consent for grant 
i have decide to appear to agree for only in such a source could i see any possibility of be permit enough freedom of movement to plan for -PRON- escape 
but i do not want to seem to give in too readily 
-PRON- would be more convincing i think if i be persuade only reluctantly after more elaborate threat and promise 
in this however i make a blunder 
lourmon leap to -PRON- foot in a rage when i do not instantly agree 
-PRON- fairly snarl the word at -PRON- 
-PRON- say nyimeurnior explain calmly that -PRON- be a fool but that since -PRON- be only an earth man -PRON- will give -PRON- one more chance to think -PRON- over and make well use of what little intelligence -PRON- have 
-PRON- do this not from any motive of mercy or justice to -PRON- for as a prisoner -PRON- be not entitle to any right or claim whatever but on the contrary be indebte to -PRON- already for several week existence 
-PRON- do -PRON- merely because -PRON- need information -PRON- can give -PRON- and -PRON- be willing to sacrifice even -PRON- dignity on the chance that -PRON- will ultimately give -PRON- to -PRON- freely 
but this sacrifice of dignity in not order -PRON- execution immediately -PRON- will hold against -PRON- as a debt 
if -PRON- do not change -PRON- mind -PRON- will be torf ture and the secret of the earth airplane drag from yott 
i be so amazed at the volume of mean the girl translate from the single word that i forget to play -PRON- role and instead of consent at once stand there with an open mouth like the fool lourmon have call -PRON- try to figure out how much language actually have be pack into two syllable and how much be so to speak embroidery add to -PRON- by the girl from -PRON- knowledge of the situation 
lourmon make a vicious little gesture and -PRON- two interpreter lead -PRON- back to -PRON- cell not such a low mentality as -PRON- believe -PRON- the girl remark 
unless i too have misjudge -PRON- -PRON- will accept 
if -PRON- decide to before the next mealtime just knock on the panel 
the guard outside will be instruct to take -PRON- to lourmon who will not need any speech from -PRON- but just a sign of assent 
with that -PRON- step from -PRON- cell to the corridor and shoot the panel across 
escape arrangement i think would give -PRON- -PRON- opportunity 
i glance through the tiny window of -PRON- cell 
a brilliant morning sun flood the half mile or so of bare plain and the rugged rocky country beyond 
why should i wait to build up little by little any elaborate plan of gain more and more freedom of movement within the castle until finally i could make an opportunity of escape -PRON- would be well to risk all on a bold stroke 
after the first day the sentry have give up patrol the open terrace in the daytime even in -PRON- cleverly construct humidor suit 
two of -PRON- have die from -PRON- 
instead i have be inform by nyimeurnior -PRON- be safely ensconce in little turret which -PRON- could enter only from within the fortress and from these -PRON- scan the sky with -PRON- telescopic instrument carefully shield with ray filter for sign of the earth men airplane turn -PRON- attention occasionally to the rough country surround the little plain on which the fortress be locate 
once i get clear in the open sunlight the invader would certainly find -PRON- difficult to pursue -PRON- 
-PRON- danger would be chiefly that -PRON- may launch an umbrella ship after -PRON- 
indecision be not a frequent fault among -PRON- of the air guard 
i rap on the door at once hope that -PRON- guard would be a big fellow for -PRON- race and be wear -PRON- humidor suit 
footstep approach and the panel swing back 
-PRON- thrust -PRON- head in the cell and beckon -PRON- to follow -PRON- 
i seize and jerk -PRON- into the room 
-PRON- would have be easy to knock -PRON- out with a blow on the jaw if -PRON- have not be for -PRON- helmet 
but i finally manage to knock this off as -PRON- scuffle and then a few well direct blow put -PRON- out 
i strip the fellow of -PRON- humidor suit 
luck be with -PRON- for though -PRON- be not as large as -PRON- suit be a bit large for -PRON- and with some difficulty i be able to squeeze into -PRON- 
place the helmet over -PRON- head i belt on -PRON- weapon which consist of a short sword and a couple of what i take to be small vacuum grenade 
then i step boldly through the panel door into the passageway 
nobody be in sight 
from a distance some place below there come to -PRON- through the network of corridor and up the ramp which be use in place of stair the sound of a large body of man march 
gradually this sound lessen and since at the same time i hear a confused clamor through the outlet ventilator i judge that a detail of man have be send outside the castle 
this be strange for -PRON- be broad daylight and the sun be shine brightly 
i know that something important must be afoot to take the soldier of enus out into the sun even with the protection of -PRON- humidor suit and helmet 
after some search through the deserted upper level of the structure i find a lookout turret from which i could get a good view of the surround plain 
-PRON- be a typical view of that section of mexico a broad plain quivering in the sunlight for the most part arid and bare but with occasional island of rocky protuberance and patch of povertystricken mesquite 
far to the west at a point which be practically the limit of -PRON- vision i see another of the lava fortress 
the sky above -PRON- be fill with little flash of light and puff of smoke indicate that an attack be be make upon -PRON- 
ai i gaze a giant dirigible of the air guard in -PRON- lowvisibility war paint swing broadside on to -PRON- line of vision materializing as -PRON- be out of an empty sky 
there follow a series of detonation so heavy that i could actually feel the air vibrate 
but apparently not even these heavy bomb could break through the fanray film which the invader have spread above -PRON- 
the little flash and smoke puff continue both aloft and below 
i glance downward at the gate of the fortress which i may mention here be not unlike that of a medieval castle if -PRON- can imagine one of those old european fortress do over again in modern factory construction style 
a column of soldier have issue forth and be wind -PRON- way across the plain in the direction of the beleaguered fortress 
but what interest -PRON- most keenly about the column be the method use of protect -PRON- from air attack 
in the center march a column of infantry 
to either side of -PRON- a column of fanray machine which lumber along on leverlike leg with a motion not unlike the lurching of -PRON- own tank -PRON- generator all turn outward spread a fan of ray almost horizontal over the top of still two other flank column of machine 
these outside column play -PRON- ray upward and inward over the center w of the column the two filmls of ray cross and furnish complete protection 
the only way in which that column could be reach by steel projectile of any description be from the ground at flat trajectory 
so interested do i become in the attack on the column which i be certain would follow that i forget the press need of make -PRON- escape and stand there gaze 
from somewhere behind and above there come a steady hissing roar 
four venus airship come into view take up -PRON- position to the rear of the column at a height of about a half mile 
nyimeurnior have describe these ship to -PRON- but this be the first i have see of -PRON- 
-PRON- be upright cylinder some fifty foot in height and about thirty foot in diameter crown by an umbrellalike structure a hundred foot in diameter and several foot thick 
-PRON- be from the top surface that the air be be electronize into vacuum to be rematerialize on the concave under surface 
if -PRON- be not for the light projecting and brace steel beam which help to hold the affair rigid and also provide landing gear which would not offer the same resistance to the air as a solid platform the thing would have look like giant float mushroom 
-PRON- too float in what be practically an envelope of inverse magnetic ray the generator be so place as to cause the beam or ray to cross in every direction 
-PRON- hang in the air above the column calmly await the swoop attack of -PRON- air guard 
when -PRON- come -PRON- be sudden enough 
seven squadron of plane dove headon at the venus ship spit a steady hail of projectile zoom successively when -PRON- have almost reach the fanray film 
but -PRON- do no good 
the projectile bounce off that nearly invisible film like rubber ball from a concrete wall 
a fruitless attack i to shout at -PRON- to use nonmetallic projectile to which i know these ray would offer no resistance but of course -PRON- be ridiculous to suppose -PRON- could hear -PRON- 
as a matter of fact i could not even signal -PRON- for i be shut up in the lookout turret 
-PRON- be the frantic desire to get this information to -PRON- own side which finally prompt -PRON- to tear -PRON- away from -PRON- point of vantage 
even as i do so i see one of -PRON- plane collide with the magnetic wall and hurtle down a crumple thing while another catch within the effective radius of one of the suction bomb also crumple and fall 
leave the lookout turret i hurry down through the corridor and ramp with little fear that -PRON- disguise would be penetrate soldier i encounter several time 
i have learn much of the manner custom and courtesy of these people from nyimeurnior and gloved and helmete as i be i be cover from head to foot 
nothing but the most search gaze through -PRON- helmet goggle would have reveal the fact that i do not have a dead white skin 
at last i reach the passage through which the column have pass but a short time before 
there be a sentry on guard just inside the big gate which still be open but -PRON- be gaze out after the depart column 
i simply elbow -PRON- aside and trot out over the plain as though i be a tardy member of the expedition hurry to catch up to the column 
i steal a glance back over -PRON- shoulder 
the plan have work 
-PRON- have not be alarm by -PRON- action 
i be careful however not to catch up to the column but bear off toward the north when i be sure no attention be be pay to -PRON- 
then i remove the helmet and strip off the humidor suit which be a great relief 
i think that a half an hour longer in that moisture proof garb under the blaze mexican sun would have drown or smother -PRON- in -PRON- own perspiration 
from somewhere to the northwest an artillery barrage be lay down on the invader column 
for a moment i have a thrill of elation 
from the confusion -PRON- produce i think -PRON- have succeed in crash through the magnetic wall 
but -PRON- have not 
there be the usual result shell bounce harmlessly off and explode in the air above the column 
the confusion evidently be produce by the surprise of the bombardment and the noise for the battery be a long distance away and well hide 
for a while the column halt and the man cower 
but few seem to take any real alarm 
in the end the machine resume -PRON- sluggish progress while the infantry stagger and crouch -PRON- way forward quite safe from the explosion above -PRON- but far from enjoy -PRON- 
farther on the column be ambush by a detachment of -PRON- infantry 
simultaneously another attack be launch on -PRON- from the air 
but no success attend the effort of the earth man 
a number of the venus ray generator be raise on extension platform and the direction of the ray depress 
and i could see that not even a flat trajectory fire could reach the column 
as the climax of the attack the plane above withhold -PRON- fire and the ground guard throw three wave of infantry against the column but only to wither away under the suction bomb of the cough gun with which the venusian meet -PRON- 
the earth force withdraw at last after suffer considerable loss and the man of the column probably with frazzle nerve but with little physical damage continue to wend -PRON- tortuous painful way across the plain and enter the other fortress 
all this time i have be make -PRON- way northward until finally i pass out of sight of the two castle 
that night i build a code signal fire and inside half an hour be pick up by a highangle plane which drop down beside -PRON- 
the great retreat a a result of radio order i be send to washington at once to report to the ordnance board 
the knowledge i have gain of the invader -PRON- method and -PRON- machine prove invaluable 
not that the air and land guard general board have not already determine the fact that special projectile and equipment would be necessary to penetrate the defensive ray of the invader but i be able to verify many of -PRON- conclusion correct certain other and generally expand the fund of knowledge that already have be gather by the intelligence division 
i have a busy two week hop from one office to another on special detail and event move swiftly in those two week 
i be -PRON- amazed at the speed with which new gun and new nonmetallic shell and bomb be be turn out and the ingenuity show by the scientific department of the guard and by manufacturer in develop a nonmetallic bayonet 
troop have to be equip with canteen belt buckle head gear and button and fastening on -PRON- uniform which have no metal in -PRON- construction 
the rifle -PRON- be determine could not be abandon but nonmetallic cartridge be develop 
the theory be that in pass through the magnetic film of the venusian for handtohand fight the troop would drop -PRON- rifle and use the detach swordbayonet 
naturally these thing could not be produce overnight nor could the troop be train in new tactic overnight but so intensively be the work of manufacturing and drilling prosecute that at the end of two week many regiment of the land guard have be reorganize and about a tenth of the air guard have be supply with nonmetallic bomb 
during this period however the two fortress with which i have be concern be abandon -PRON- community drift lazily and safely southward in -PRON- mushroom ship as do many other finally settle in the interior of brazil 
perhaps i should pause here to summarize the sequence of event up to this point 
nearly two week elapse between the arrival of the first and last of the bulb of -PRON- land in the united state in canada in scandinavia in england in france in germany in italy in the balkan and hundred in the tropic belt all the way around the earth 
throughout western europe the land and air force get into relatively quick action against -PRON- 
as fast as new sphere descend -PRON- be wall in by ring of troop and roof over as -PRON- be by cloud of aircraft 
the one which fall in england be destroy after two day 
in france ninewere successfully bomb before -PRON- could get -PRON- inverse magnetic ray into operation 
the crew ot the other manage under fire to erect -PRON- fortress but be so worn out by the neverending bombardment to which -PRON- be subject that -PRON- be finally overcome by the charge wave of infantry who have be arm with wooden club and short spear 
twelve community flee southward in -PRON- air ship but run into atmospheric condition that be horrible to -PRON- in northern africa where the lack of humidity cause -PRON- terrible loss 
of the hundred that land in africa the majority perish 
the remainder make -PRON- way either eastward or westward around the equator to the fastness of the brazilian jungle where -PRON- construct -PRON- great stronghold 
at the end of three month none of the invader remain anywhere in the civilized section of the temperate zone 
the story of those invader who establish -PRON- in such land as tibet and siam and how -PRON- ultimately perish have not all be unearth yet from the ruin of the colony that fall in the united state be destroy 
the other fight -PRON- way through -PRON- air force toward the tropic 
then there ensue a period of two month in which the invader and earth man be content to let matter rest while -PRON- take stock of the situation and prepare for the great struggle to come 
the man of venus do very little of the raiding -PRON- have intend accord to the plan nyimeurnior have explain to -PRON- during -PRON- incarceration 
time and again -PRON- air fleet course over the brazilian forest but seldom do -PRON- find evidence of the enemys work 
the invader have learn well to conceal -PRON- under the leafy protection of the jungle 
-PRON- have learn too to raise no lava fortress where -PRON- could be see from above and also to conceal the flow of -PRON- volcanic well 
-PRON- have little chance of meet -PRON- successfully in the air now for -PRON- air fleet have be give bullet and projectile of nonmetallic construction against which the fanray of the invader be of no avail and -PRON- become more a matter of sport than anything else among -PRON- of the air guard to sight a mushroom ship or squadron and shoot -PRON- down 
-PRON- suction bomb be destructive but -PRON- could move too fast for -PRON- ship and outclimb -PRON- easily 
however accord to the good estimate there be close to one million of -PRON- now establish in the brazil jungle where -PRON- be busily readjust -PRON- to earth condition construct -PRON- ingenious machine and develop -PRON- resource in preparation for a future outbreak which -PRON- all fear would be far more devastating than the effect of -PRON- haphazard and uncoordinated activity at the time of -PRON- arrival upon earth 
the paucity of information on -PRON- movement in the jungle be ominous 
indian stagger into the brazilian military outpost with tale of wholesale and mysterious slaughter of mist that travel purposefully through the jungle from which ghostman emerge to slay 
y 
brazilian military reconnoiter party go out and fail to return 
once a mist cloud move out of the jungle and envelop an outpost 
when -PRON- retreat accord to the story of a soldier who have be outside the line the entire garrison have be massacre 
yet these mist be never observe above the tree top 
the earth mobilize brazilian government have make -PRON- formal appeal to the league fo help accord to the league constitution and a gigantic army recruit from all the nation in the league be to surround the vast jungle territory 
ten million man be to be use for though -PRON- would be oppose only about a million of the enemy -PRON- would be fight for nothing less than the existence of the human race and would be face the unknown 
this be the general situation 
and while this immense army be be mobilize and equip a call be make for volunteer who have have contact with the enemy to attempt the highly dangerous work of penetrate the brazilian forest as scout and spy 
and have no well sense volunteer 
that be why i find -PRON- ensconce one night in the upper branch of a tree far in the interior in a section where i have finally find evidence of activity 
i wear an imitation humidor suit that be an imitation only in -PRON- clever arrangement for ventilation 
-PRON- be in fact a real venus garment which for the moment be suspend on -PRON- chest like an oldfashioned gas mask but be in reality a gas mask and several other thing besides 
in -PRON- hand i hold a little box a tiny radio broadcasting set scatter around -PRON- through the forest at strategic point be carefully conceal bomb and flare each tune so that by press the proper button on the box i may set off any particular bomb or flare by radio impuse 
i have spend the day plant these mine among which be a a number of gas bomb 
all these arrangement be precaution of self defense 
i have no intention of carry on a campaign singlehande 
but i have pick the spot for several day patient observation for -PRON- be here that i have note several fresh trail that appear to -PRON- unwoodsmanlike eye to converge and come to an end for no reason whatever in a little clearing not far from the tree in which i be hide 
a quarter of a mile away carefully hidden i have one of -PRON- new helicopter develop by the air guard a machine that be powerful and as nearly silent in -PRON- operation as any device use an air propeller could be and far beyond sight a great dirigible be await -PRON- communication 
but since nothing at all happen that night and no sound come to -PRON- strain ear except those of the normal animal life of the jungle i determine the next night to try an experiment 
i wait until after midnight and then press a button on -PRON- radio control box which result in a terrific explosion about a quarter of a mile farther on in the jungle 
i get the flash of -PRON- even through the dense growth of the jungle and -PRON- tree tremble with the force of the detonation 
immediately there be a series of purplish flash in the sky above that spot which merge into a continuous mass of pulsate light as the preliminary thunderclap grow into a continuous roar 
-PRON- experiment have prove profitable 
i have learn something 
i know those flash and thunderclap as the product of the cough gun of the enemy 
but the power of this barrage exceed by far anything i have see while a prisoner among -PRON- 
as suddenly as the uproar have begin -PRON- cease 
and silence once more settle over the jungle 
-PRON- be evident that i have stumble into the neighborhood of a venus artillery post and no mean one 
-PRON- bomb have be mistake for one drop from an airplane 
the next day i search for the location of that battery but could not find -PRON- 
the night follow i sleep but devote the day after that to another painstaking search of the jungle 
at last i find a spot where the foliage of the tree above -PRON- appear to have be shred and tear 
i search the ground carefully 
-PRON- patience be reward by the discovery of a beautifully design camouflage a screen of moss and leave which conceal a pit 
the battery be bury under ground and fortunately for -PRON- must have be unmanned and unguarde at the moment although this do not surprise -PRON- know as i do how the invader hate -PRON- atmosphere in the daylight even when wear -PRON- humidor suit 
the gun crew i be sure be also somewhere below ground probably sleep and the sentry who must have have some post of vantage from which -PRON- could see the sky be evidently so placed that -PRON- could not observe the floor of the forest 
as quietly as i could and i must admit with some fear i slip away to where one of -PRON- bomb be conceal and carry -PRON- carefully to the pit where i conceal -PRON- in some undergrowth nearby 
that night i take up a new post in a tree from which i could see the mouth of the pit and detonate another of -PRON- bomb some distance away 
the phenomenon of several night before be repeat in the air but i do not watch -PRON- this time 
i keep -PRON- attention center upon the mouth of the pit 
the screen have be blow aside and so fast be the bury gun fire -PRON- seem to be only one that -PRON- discharge blend into a continuous faintly luminescent column that tear through the upper branch of the tree 
after a bit the gun cease fire 
about a quarter of an hour elapse 
then a faint light appear near the mouth of the pit by which i could observe the figure of a half a dozen invader 
two of -PRON- be nakedwhite in the soft warm tropical night but the other wear -PRON- suit and helmet 
one of -PRON- be place a new screen over the mouth of the gun pit 
other be carefully gather up the debris tear from the tree above 
-PRON- first instinct be to slip to the ground and creep up on -PRON- 
i feel that in the darkness -PRON- would not be notice that there be an additional member of -PRON- party and i may be able to follow -PRON- underground 
but caution prevail and i determine first to communicate -PRON- discovery to the dirigible somewhere in the sky above 
-PRON- have plan an ingenious method of do this 
with the first grey light of dawn i feel -PRON- way back through the jungle to the spot whre i have leave -PRON- helicopter for -PRON- radio would not have be powerful enough to reach the ship nor would i have dare to use one for a continuous message 
the enemy may have pick -PRON- up and locate -PRON- 
the small amount of power and mere instantaneous spark that i use to detonate -PRON- bomb do not matter 
from one of the compartment of the helicopter i take a tiny model of the same sort equip with a little chemical engine 
the whole thing be little big than a cigar box 
i write -PRON- report and attach -PRON- to the model which i shoot vertically into the air 
when -PRON- be five thousand foot up -PRON- would automatically broadcast a range find signal and emit a faint smoke trail which would enable one of -PRON- plane to pick -PRON- up 
-PRON- would rise under -PRON- power for many hour then drift down on a little parachute and finally if not pick up by the time -PRON- drift below the level -PRON- would burn destroy the message 
into the tunnel the rest of the day for i expect to be very busy that night 
after nightfall i return to -PRON- post near the gun pit but do not climb the tree 
instead i hide behind -PRON- vast trunk and press the button that would detonate the bomb i have place near the gun pit 
-PRON- blow a great gash in the ground and must have put the gun out of commission for no roar barrage follow but a short time afterward ten or twelve soldier break through a screen of creeper and by the faint light of hand lamp excitedly inspect the crater -PRON- bomb have tear at the edge of -PRON- gun pit 
-PRON- jabber laconically in -PRON- strange shorthand tongue frequently point upward 
i circle and come up behind -PRON- join -PRON- party yet not get too close to the other as i make a pretense of search the ground and look fearfully up toward the sky where only a couple of star be visible through the dense foliage 
after a bit -PRON- leader a man big than the rest who have not don -PRON- humidor suit grunt a command and one by one -PRON- disappear through the screen of creep vine 
i approach with the rest but hang back a bit hope the commander would go in ahead of -PRON- 
but -PRON- do not and in the end -PRON- grunt an angry command 
-PRON- must have become suspicious as i pass -PRON- 
possibly -PRON- have be count and realize that -PRON- have an extra man 
at any event -PRON- reach out and grasp -PRON- arm 
but i be on the alert for such a danger 
twist quickly i drive -PRON- fist against -PRON- unprotected jaw and -PRON- go down like a log 
and push -PRON- way through the screen i find -PRON- in a cleverly conceal passageway which slant down below the ground level 
follow the light of the other around a couple of turn i come upon a section of corridor that be dimly light 
after a bit -PRON- come to a junction of several corridor and the man turn sharply to the left down a small tunnel 
i pause a moment to take stock of this structure and if possible get -PRON- bearing 
-PRON- little compass make several thing clear 
the tunnel the man have follow evidently lead back to the gun pit 
a main corridor much large stretch away in a great curve to the south 
another curve gently northward 
and toward the west a third one large than any of the other slant downward at a sharp angle 
in the big chamber where these corridor come together which incidentally remind much of one of -PRON- old subway station in new york be a number of big complicated piece of machinery 
-PRON- be not in operation at the moment however 
from down the big west shaft come a distant murmur which little by little grow in intensity until i finally think -PRON- advisable to seek cover 
i hide behind one of the machine 
the murmur grow into a roar 
the roar increase 
and there shoot out of the tunnel into the big station where -PRON- come to an easy but quick stop a great projectilelike car 
-PRON- have no wheel but apparently ride on two system of magnetic device one run like a spine along the top the other like a keel along the bottom 
as i notice this the car settle down a few inch and rest with a bump on the lavalike floor 
several door in the side open and a stream of soldier begin to troop out 
at the same moment several of the gun crew come run out of the small corridor 
-PRON- make -PRON- way immediately to the command officer of the newcomer evidently a man of high rank from the breadth of the belt -PRON- wear and the numerous insignia appear on -PRON- and make -PRON- report in some excitement 
-PRON- know by now of course that -PRON- battery commander be miss 
-PRON- reply angrily 
i gather from -PRON- impatient gesture that -PRON- be reprimand -PRON- for not return to the jungle to seek -PRON- officer 
and i realize i be face a crisis 
but i dare not come from behind the machine to join the throng at this juncture for none of -PRON- be in a humidor suit and i would have attract unwelcome attention instantly 
i be force therefore to watch the squad which rush off at once toward the exit to the forest and see -PRON- retreat cut off 
-PRON- strike -PRON- that strategically speak -PRON- be high time for a diversion if on find -PRON- commander outside -PRON- be not to start an imme340 diate search of the tunnel 
so i draw -PRON- radio detonator out and press one of -PRON- button then another and finally a third 
there be only one explosion which come to -PRON- ear faintly and muffle from a point some three hundred yard away in the forest 
the other two bomb would make no noise 
one be a smoke bomb which would so smother -PRON- hand lamp that -PRON- would hardly be able to see -PRON- hand before -PRON- face 
the third be a gas bomb and would give those who breathe -PRON- fume something new to think about i hope for as long as -PRON- be able to think 
as i expect a detachment of only twelve man or so be send out to investigate 
another detachment arm with tool and implement of various description run down the corridor toward the gun pit and soon the sound of -PRON- apparatus be clang in -PRON- ear 
a party from the gun pit come back and after report to the commander who be pace up and down impatiently run to one of the machine near that behind which i be hide 
-PRON- swarm over -PRON- manipulate little wheel and lever 
and to -PRON- surprise the mass of machinery which remind -PRON- something of a small newspaper printing press lumber to leverlike foot and shamble away down the tunnel to the pit 
every few moment the commander glance impatiently toward the forestexit corridor 
finally -PRON- motion to one of the girl in the rank behind -PRON- for as i mention before -PRON- seem to make no distinction as to sex when -PRON- come to labor or military service and -PRON- run off toward the exit 
but -PRON- do not return 
nor do any of the other 
i opine that -PRON- gas be work nicely and now bitterly regret that i have fail to fill -PRON- pouch with gas grenade from -PRON- helicopter 
at last the officer bark an order 
the rest of the soldier break rank unstrappe -PRON- humidor suit from -PRON- belt and don -PRON- 
another order and -PRON- all move briskly away toward the exit trail -PRON- short spear 
i slip into the rearmost rank and go along with -PRON- for -PRON- purpose now be to regain -PRON- helicopter and send up another message to the dirigible explain what i have see of -PRON- corridor and system of underground structure 
guerilla warfare head of the column pass out through the screen of creeper 
other follow 
then suddenly the column recoil 
some of those near the screen sink down gasp and choke 
other stagger and lean against the wall 
through the confusion i could see that some of -PRON- have tear away the foliage of the screen reveal the pile up body beyond 
at this moment a gust of wind send a billow of the black smoke surge into the corridor 
the rest of the column turn and flee from -PRON- crowd back down the corridor 
i chuckle as i crouch to let -PRON- pass -PRON- gas mask in place for i remember the rumor that have reach -PRON- of these people leap from white fog that roam the surface of the jungle 
the black fog and deadly gas of earth laboratory be reverse the terror 
as the last of the flee enemy disappear around the bend in the corridor i arise and make -PRON- way to the outer blackness where i stumble around for more than an hour before i win free from -PRON- own black fog and gas and locate -PRON- helicopter 
at dawn i shoot another baby heli up with -PRON- report and fill -PRON- pouch with gas and smoke grenade 
i want to return and get a more comprehensive idea of the extent of -PRON- corridor system for i be convince by now that the whole invader population have take to burrow into the earth 
in dig -PRON- volcanic shaft -PRON- would be no impossible task for -PRON- to adapt -PRON- wonderful machine for fashion the lava product into underground corridor and chamber instead of the castle or fortress -PRON- have first build above ground 
if this be the case -PRON- army be go to have some little task ahead of -PRON- in dig -PRON- out 
i do not have an opportunity to pursue -PRON- investigation further at that time however for i have hardly turn from -PRON- helicopter when i become conscious of the slight continuous buzz in -PRON- radio box that be the prearrange signal order -PRON- return to the dirigible 
so regretfully i climb into the machine start the motor and open the throttle roar up through the tree top 
before i have go far i be sight by the enemy and suction bomb begin to burst around -PRON- 
stun by the thunderclap of one of these i lose consciousness not to awake until several hour later in one of the bunk of the dirigible 
for several week thereafter all i see of the war be from the air 
i be attach to one of the new superdirigible as a plane scout 
the be one of the first of those dirigible that keep permanently to the air and dock only at infrequent period as the battleship of old take to -PRON- dry dock only for repair 
the big ship cruise above the utmost range of the cough gun and most of the time be unable to see the surface of the ground owe to atmospheric condition 
a regular patrol be maintain however 
i and fifteen other pilot would catapult -PRON- plane down out of the big outlet port in the ship low hull drop like stone to the point of visibility and then cruise -PRON- beat climb again to land gently on the great top deck of the ship 
-PRON- be in reality dull work 
-PRON- see little below with -PRON- own eye but the endless stretch of the tropic forest 
but -PRON- keep -PRON- camera grinding and the subsequent development and comparison of -PRON- film reveal much to the staff that could not have be gather by haphazard visual observation 
these film for instance show at time where new venus battery have be expertly camouflage below the floor of the forest inflammite egg in -PRON- new nonmetallic casing work marvellous change in the topography at such spot and must have permanently discourage all nearby invader 
still -PRON- didnot get any too many of the battery 
suction bomb climb up toward -PRON- all too frequently from unspotted gun 
-PRON- become obvious that -PRON- could not destroy the enemy from the air without blow an impossibly large section of brazil off the map and that the enemy have no intention of come up into the air to meet -PRON- 
there be but one alternative 
the ground army would have to close in on -PRON- from the side and probably dig down as -PRON- go 
the ring close in i fortunate enough to be the observer of a number of action when finally the ring begin to tighten 
the description of one serve for nearly all of -PRON- 
-PRON- open with the innumerable flash and concussion of divisional artillery over a sector probably five mile wide and ten deep 
these flash be but faintly visible from -PRON- extreme height 
more vivid be the seething churning flame forest where the shell fall 
somewhere on the edge of this churning area be -PRON- first infantry line 
then the barrage cease and i dive for a close view and a well opportunity to cooperate 
like a swarm of ant i could see -PRON- man penetrate painfully and slowly -PRON- seem into the devastate sector 
then at several spot in front and behind the writhing advance line little cloud of white mist puff out from opening that bubble up in the churned area as though make by tiny mole 
these cloud expand 
then -PRON- begin to move in definitely control direction 
the invader must have have some form of magnetic control with which -PRON- drag these envelop mist around with -PRON- 
some enveloped section of -PRON- first line and from -PRON- position in the air i could see the broken end of the line at such spot pivot back into new position to prevent a rolling up of the flank 
two or three of the groundmist cloud suddenly evaporate uncover enemy detachment of from to man 
one be catch between a cross fire of two machinegun company and wipe out in a trice 
another be equip with fanray machine but the invader quickly abandon these when -PRON- find -PRON- be not stop the new nonmetallic bullet of the earth force 
one cloud i notice suddenly become motionless a great dome of mist about yard in diameter swaying under the pressure of the gentle breeze as though -PRON- be a halffilled balloon 
and -PRON- stay motionless 
a spot plane swoop low over -PRON- and zoom for a little radio chat with -PRON- battery 
an instant later a veritable hail of shrapnel tear thrugh the intangible mass but apparently without affect -PRON- 
then from a nearby ridge one of -PRON- gas detail liberate a great billowing cloud of smudgy vapor that roll down on -PRON- like a tidal wave 
the vapor flow around over and even through -PRON- but the mistywhite swaying dome still show 
i see shadowy grotesquely mask infantry pick -PRON- way down the slope from the ridge and with cautious yet alert decision plunge into the mysterious quivering mist 
the wave of smudgy vapor roll on and a moment later the mist also suddenly evaporate in tenous swirling wisps that be carry along by the breeze in the wake of the rolling smoke 
only the infantry detail be there 
of venusian there be no sign except the single figure stretch prone on the ground beside a little portable machine of complicated appearance 
i learn later that this be the machine that control the mist by create what for want of a well name -PRON- call a magnetic field although the force involve be not magnetism despite certain manifestation similar to magnetic phenomenon 
this particular mistcloud be a decoy a camouflage 
the enemy have set -PRON- control machine on the ground and be about to sneak for safety but the shrapnel blast hit the misty dome a bit too soon for -PRON- 
the accelerated advance of -PRON- second line of infantry end the engagement 
-PRON- plunge ahead in open order with support concentrate on those spot where the line sweep through the mistclouds 
curtain obviously cloak enemy artillery be suddenly rent but not dissipate by pale flash from within 
other hide detail of enemy infantry await the onsweeping line quietly or move slowly toward -PRON- 
-PRON- be around in and through these that the heavy fight handtohand work swirl and eddy 
but the line sweep on engulf the broken fragment of the first line and in the end slowly surge into the dense forest beyond the area that have be tear up by the barrage while the third line which have now come up send detail of moppersup scour through the area of the engagement 
reserve have be rush forward quickly in the hope that -PRON- may penetrate the tunnel from which the invader have emerge 
but in each case -PRON- be find that these tunnel have be blast behind -PRON- by the retire enemy and have cave in 
innumerable engagement of this nature be fight through this period of the war 
the fighting be heavy but the progress of the campaign slow for the enemy occupy a vast area about as large as a matter of fact as france 
in actual number of man per square mile the line be not nearly as tightly draw as -PRON- be in the old world war but when the increase efficiency range and coordi342 nation of the machinery of warfare be take into account -PRON- be in effect more tightly draw than -PRON- be in that old crude struggle and there be far more finesse in strategy and tactic display by both side 
the mobilization of science cleverly be the strategic phase of the cam paign plan and carry out that -PRON- be a long time before -PRON- -PRON- sense that the idea of -PRON- high command be to drive two wedge into opposite side of the area occupy by the unearthly enemy until -PRON- finally meet and separate -PRON- into two area with the hope that in the process these wedge would pierce or bring -PRON- within close strike distance of one or more of the enemys main basis 
whether -PRON- have few or many -PRON- do not know 
no system of espionage could penetrate very far into the line of an enemy who have nothing in common with -PRON- of earth except superficial physical resemblance 
no man of venus could be tempt to betray -PRON- specie by any offer earth man could make 
few prisoner could be make to talk and those who do have little of value to tell of the plan or disposition of -PRON- own force 
most of -PRON- commit suicide almost immedi ately on be take 
during this period all the scientific resource of earth be mobilize in grim determination to find method of checkmate the peculiar science and strategy of the invader from space 
vast area back of -PRON- line have to be carefully guard for the enemy boring machine could burrow deep under the surface of the ground with relative rapidity and the rear of no fighting division be ever safe 
time and again the enemy surge up out of the ground far in -PRON- rear in locally overwhelming number take terrific toll before entire division could be pivot and reserve bring up to enclose -PRON- and choke -PRON- back into -PRON- tunnel 
-PRON- know -PRON- have to have air ventilate system in -PRON- tunnel and underground community 
the weather bureaus of the whole world furnish -PRON- expert to study air current over the enemy area 
spectroscopic ultrared and ultraviolet telescope be develop in the hope that long range chemical analysis of the air may betray the proximity of ventilate outlet or intake 
electromagnetic instrument of the utmost sensitivity be invent in the hope of detect the presence of machinery underground 
penetrative rocketbomb be develop great projectile to be drop from aircraft which after fall a safe distance would automatically develop -PRON- rocket power and plunge earthward with acceleration and momentum many time that of gravity to penetrate far into the ground before -PRON- explode 
to see one of these shell hit the ground be a sight indeed 
-PRON- would throw up an earthspout from to foot high 
then after a terrible pause would come an aweinspire muffled rumble roar and the surface of the ground for a quarter to a half mile in every direction would heave and surge and settle down again with tree frequently still stand but crazily tilted and askew the concussion underground must have be deadly to any live being in tunnel within a great distance of the explosion 
high enough in the air -PRON- do not mind 
but when -PRON- dive too close to the surface the effect be deaden to the sense 
at first many of -PRON- aviator meet death through loss of control over -PRON- and -PRON- machine due to the concussion 
but of all the locating device -PRON- use the microphonic type prove the most practical of all 
of these there be two kind audio and radio 
-PRON- be the former that have by far the more general value 
-PRON- be simple in principle 
a thin shaft would be sink in the ground to a depth of foot or more and into this would be lower a multiple microphone device each microphone element be carefully soundinsulate from -PRON- fellow and directionally point and each have -PRON- amplify unit 
operator listen at audio receiver for sound identify as mechanical 
and reader develop marvelous facility in interpret the composite and individual graph that the light needle make on sensitized paper as permanent record 
the radio finder be not of course really microphone but rather highly sensitive and carefully shield radio receiver of a specialized type which be ground to the air above thus reverse the usual procedure 
-PRON- pick up the ground wave of static give off by enemy machinery of an electrical nature 
little by little -PRON- scientist learn to detect with fair accuracy the presence of the enemy underfoot within a distance of a mile or more accord to the nature of the surface and the subsoil and for the most part this prove sufficient to prevent -PRON- mining under -PRON- position without detection 
the success of these finder in turn be probably responsible for -PRON- last desperate move in turn loose the volcanic force which have prove -PRON- undoing on -PRON- own planet and be fate to bring about -PRON- downfall again on our 
find -PRON- could no longer burrow under -PRON- cordon without discovery and subsequent annihilation from -PRON- ground penetrate rocket -PRON- take the chance of tamper with the internal heat of a strange planet 
the first -PRON- know of the cataclysmic force to be let loose be when the upper amazon river suddenly dwindle and dry 
-PRON- have be divert from -PRON- course quite obviously somewhere within the enemy territory 
-PRON- be only a matter of hour before -PRON- air scout find the place where a great chasm have be open across the river bed into which the water be roar and tumble 
but that be all the good -PRON- do -PRON- 
drop penetrative bomb to kill any of the enemy who may be hide under ground in the neighborhood do not interrupt the waterfall that tumble into the depth of the earth 
nor be all the explosive -PRON- could pour into the chasm sufficient to cave -PRON- in or close -PRON- up 
vast masse of earth be blast loose within and around the great hole but the water wash -PRON- down before -PRON- have a chance to clog -PRON- up 
cataclysm i -PRON- scientist have a pretty good idea of what be to come for the high command suddenly get very busy 
there be a hasty shifting of division and even army corps without any reason then apparent 
certain geological area be hastily evacuate 
in some of -PRON- the troop movement be incomplete when the cataclysm occur 
hundred of square mile of the earth suddenly heave and boil at the outcropping of certain strata and there begin to flow down the valley and ravine and along the river bed viscous stream of flame smoking allconsume lava 
a number of regiment and one whole division be cut off maroon by the flame flood that finally consume -PRON- 
-PRON- line generally be throw into confusion by -PRON- drastic readjustment and the effect on morale be far from good 
the troop be key up to fight -PRON- out desperately with the interplanetary invader 
but how could -PRON- fight such vast force of nature 
in this moment of confusion the invader who either by intention or accident have release force that threaten to be more destructive to -PRON- than to -PRON- suddenly launch -PRON- great attack or migratory onslaught westward toward the slope of the ande which be well back of -PRON- advanced line on that side 
-PRON- have to break through or perish by the force -PRON- have -PRON- conjure up 
the deploying of -PRON- defense be far from smooth in view of the prevail chaos and so sudden be the attack that there be no time to shift many division from the east to the west front 
up into the jungle out of -PRON- countless underground burrow come the enemy horde in -PRON- helmeted suit -PRON- great machine clang grind plow blast and slicing path through the heavy vegetation for -PRON- 
-PRON- abandon the nicety of military tactic and come on en masse 
the pale flash of -PRON- suction gun faintly illuminate the jungle endlessly in all direction and a gargantuan inferno of shriek and explode shell tear air forest and ground to piece in front of -PRON- as -PRON- plow onward 
-PRON- first line go down before -PRON- as a childs tiny sand fort be engulf by the tide 
-PRON- have no time to retire 
-PRON- second line evacuate -PRON- position to a depth of several mile while -PRON- air force and ground artillerly cut into the game with a terrific counter barrage 
so heavy be the air fire that i and -PRON- companion scout be order into the mother ship for fear -PRON- may be annihilate by the rain of shell from above 
far far to the east i could see the pall of lava smoke 
below in every direction the surface of the earth actually be obliterate by a noxious haze shoot through by the pale and flame flash of the venus and the earth artillery 
together with the other plane pilot i stand in the observation room of the great dirigible 
but -PRON- role of spectator be to be interrupt 
col benner come in hurriedly 
to -PRON- plane -PRON- snap where -PRON- do a diveout and get into -PRON- umbrella ship report below general plane mobilization order fifteen mile east 000foot level go to ride the tail of the whole enemy army and strafe out of -PRON- in the open now where -PRON- barrage have slice down the jungle go 
one after another -PRON- nosedive out of the keel of the big ship and streak eastward in a loose string climbing as -PRON- go 
morq than plane or six full division mobilize at the rendezvous 
as far as i could see aloft and below the air be fill with the drone bug circle by flight thirty plane to a flight regiment above regiment ten flight to a regiment brigade over brigade four regiment each and division beside division of three brigade each 
for twenty minute -PRON- circle perfect formation and wait for the late comer from the eastern front 
then from a mere fly speck in the distance a position that must have be roughly over the rear of the enemy flash the general order on which every one of the pilot tune in 
regiment by regiment nose down dive for speed and streak down and away in continuously flatten formation until view in perspective from where i circle -PRON- seem like a vast sheet of immense length and width but no thickness skim away from -PRON- through the hazy air 
then come -PRON- turn 
down -PRON- go the roar and hum of motor and wing swell into a shriek whine crescendo 
for a while -PRON- be all i could do to hold formation but as -PRON- sense automatically react from the effect of the heavy acceleration and -PRON- nerve tense to a sharp coordination 
i begin to scan the haze below and ahead 
far to the right and below come the flash of a suction bomb 
-PRON- must have be foot below -PRON- level but from the corner of -PRON- eye i see an entire flight suck down into the vacuum the plane struggle crazily for control 
there be blind flash from below and ahead now too and other bug individually and in group be suck down out of formation 
destruction of the umbrella ship a this time -PRON- be slant down at an angle with ever accelerate speed 
the contour of the ground take on definite form then the roll masse of jungle and the churn surface of the earth far ahead 
finally the masse of greyuniforme helmeted invader become distinguishable struggle writhe forward in massed group and column 
somewhere ahead -PRON- first line contact with the umbrella ship -PRON- rise while continue on page the basis of the cylinder go through the floor of the cavern 
-PRON- spin movement create a terrific suction for the air in the cavern be swirl 
attach to the cylinder be hundred of small tube that give off a deep green ray 
what have reporter for the los angele outstander be send to accompany professor bloch who be go into death valley to study strange human remain find there 
in the desert -PRON- rescue an old man who tell -PRON- a strange story 
with -PRON- partner driftin sand -PRON- have go into the manalava plain one of the hot part of the valley to search for allie lane the sweetheart of sand who have be miss for forty year on the way sand insist that -PRON- see in the desert ahead of -PRON- allie and -PRON- father with -PRON- wagon -PRON- follow the mirage and finally reach a crater in the hollow of which be a pool of radium salt 
around the crater be a circular cavern from the ceiling of which be suspend the skeleton of two man 
sand in fall down near the pool immerse -PRON- finger in -PRON- go before and on withdraw find only the stump remain 
but -PRON- ea seem to be rub away and -PRON- become a young man again 
meanwhile -PRON- witness a strange sight 
out of the cave come a great sphere which revolve over the pool and finally disappear in -PRON- 
-PRON- go into the cave hope to find allie lane there and the wall of the opening mysteriously block up 
-PRON- find -PRON- lose and be suddenly surround by strange sevenfoot being with face like frog 
-PRON- have tentacle above -PRON- head and by these establish telepathic communication with the two visitor 
a shot be fire at one of the being but from -PRON- forehead a greenish fluid run out and the wound close up without damage to -PRON- 
-PRON- close in on the two man and pick -PRON- up 
sand and i be carry on the broad chest of the mysterious creature far into the cavern 
-PRON- make several abrupt descent and the oppressive air tell -PRON- that -PRON- be far below the surface of the manalava plain -PRON- movement be rapid and forceful and -PRON- long skinny leg bear -PRON- weight remarkably well although -PRON- wabble like strut geese 
during the entire course the tunnel be brilliant with change color of various hue from green to red and vermilion everchanging 
as i lie cradle in the tentaclelike arm of the big brute who carry -PRON- i smell -PRON- evil breath 
the odor be the same nauseating smell that have curl -PRON- nostril and threaten to explode -PRON- lung on several occasion since -PRON- enter the cavern 
with each slow blink of -PRON- eyelid there be an accompany metallic click 
occasionally -PRON- open -PRON- toadlike mouth and when -PRON- close -PRON- hard bony lip snap like the spring of a trap 
sand be be bear along by a broadbacke creature in front of -PRON- 
i could see -PRON- head bob with each wobbly step of the beast and i know that -PRON- be unconscious feel worried about sand 
the grip of the big fellow arm around -PRON- throat could have break the spine of an ox without any effort 
i curse the brute venomously 
the fellow bear -PRON- tighten -PRON- grip around -PRON- chest and i be force to gasp for breath 
when i become quiet -PRON- loosen -PRON- hold 
i feel a searing welt rise across -PRON- body 
presently -PRON- be carry into a great circular chamber far below the surface of the manalava plain the chamber be luminous with the strange pale green color 
in the center spin a huge glowing sphere and -PRON- be surround by small sphere each spinning in an atmosphere of -PRON- own like the earth with -PRON- sun and moon revolve around -PRON- 
the huge ball in the center seem to float in air ed earl repp without any visible support 
the small sphere likewise spin in midair at perhaps a fortyfive degree angle from the large one 
-PRON- emit a highpitched whine as -PRON- spin 
-PRON- eye now accustomed to the luminous glow search every corner of the chamber 
to the right standing on a flat rock platform be three massive chair of green metal that be stud with precious stone 
the chair be vacant line around the circular chamber be several hundred more of the grotesque creature who have carry sand and i far into the underground world 
-PRON- stand motionless as though at attention 
from deep in the bowel of the earth come a clanging of bell and each creature in the chamber with the exception of the two who bear sand and i across -PRON- chest hang -PRON- head 
i hear the scraping of rock against rock over to -PRON- right and i allow -PRON- gaze to wander there huge circular slab of rock be roll away from an entrance into the chamber 
i watch -PRON- intently until -PRON- removal expose a glitter doorway 
i have become so engrossed in watch the door that i fail to notice that i be be carry toward the platform 
as i be bear nearer to the three chair i observe stand in the opening the majestic figure of a huge bestial creature bedeck in purple and gold robe of a metal that glisten blindingly 
the fellow carry -PRON- halt before the platform and place -PRON- on the floor 
the tall figure in the doorway move quickly out of the entrance and walk stifflegge toward the chair 
from -PRON- dignity i at once accept -PRON- as the king or chief of the -PRON- be a bit unethical for the editor to wax enthusiastic about any story but -PRON- certainly could not help mentally applaud when -PRON- first read the radium pool 
not since the moon pool have there be such a story and the second part which -PRON- be present to -PRON- now be certainly by far the well part of the story 
the adventure interest accumulate gradually and with neverending vigor the story leap from adventure to science so when finally one lay the story aside -PRON- seem as if an entirely new world have be open to -PRON- a world that be as strange as -PRON- will be unforgettable 
and if -PRON- read the story ten time -PRON- will not fail to be thrill at the tenth reading as -PRON- be at the first grotesque frogman 
i stand erect -PRON- gaze follow -PRON- 
-PRON- appear not to take the slight interest in -PRON- 
i look around as -PRON- near what i accept as -PRON- throne 
sand be lie still on the broad chest of the brute who have carry -PRON- in 
-PRON- head hang loosely on -PRON- shoulder 
disconso346 lately -PRON- gaze again return to the majestic hgure on the throne 
-PRON- sit stiffly the tube above -PRON- eye wave slowly 
while -PRON- interest be center on sand lifeless body two other being have follow the high chief onto the throne and sit in the chair on either side of -PRON- 
to -PRON- uttermost surprise i behold two human being sit beside the high chief one on either side and one be a young woman gayly adorn in brilliant robe of purple and gold 
-PRON- wealth of golden brown hair shimmer in the pale green light of the chamber 
-PRON- eye be motionless and -PRON- look out over the room like one in a trance 
-PRON- finely cut feature and appeal blue eye cause -PRON- pulse to beat more rapidly than ever before in all -PRON- life 
-PRON- whole body tingle with exaltation 
i have an impression that -PRON- feature bear a distinct resemblance to some beautiful face that i have see before 
-PRON- stare straight ahead with unblinking eye 
i be unable to remove -PRON- eye from -PRON- 
where have i see that fascinating clearcut face 
whose feature be -PRON- 
ah have -PRON- 
instantly i decide to look again at the photograph sand have find in the old album back at the spring 
perhaps -PRON- be the photograph that have give -PRON- the impression of have at some past time behold the gentle feature of the girl walk unmolested over to sand limp form and reach inside -PRON- vest 
-PRON- be begin to show sign of life when i bring forth the wellpreserved photograph that -PRON- say be the picture of allie lane for whom -PRON- have be search 
every owlish eye in that great assembly of unearthly being be rivet on -PRON- as i stride photograph in hand toward the platform 
the dignified leader sit motionless on the throne and regard -PRON- through saucerlike orb 
i feel even though no sound issue from -PRON- mouth that -PRON- be converse steadily with pur capturer 
the tube just above -PRON- broad forehead wave in all direction as though catch think wave be broadcast by the other in the chamber 
the girl sit in stony immobility 
the man on the other side of the high chief be likewise motionless -PRON- eye stare straight ahead 
the man be slightly wrinkle around the mouth though -PRON- look to be no old than thirty 
-PRON- jet black hair which have be freshly comb glisten as from oil 
be this man alfre forsythe lane father of the beautiful girl whose trail lead -PRON- to the edge of the radium pool 
hardly i think 
at the edge of the platform i halt photograph hold up before -PRON- eye 
for a moment i be utterly stunned 
the photograph show the same delicately rounded chin finely shape lip and radiant blue eye that mark the beauty of the girl in the chair i stumble backward a few step in -PRON- astonishment 
lane 
i must have shout at the top of -PRON- lung for i hear a patter of foot that bring driftin sand to -PRON- side 
i look at -PRON- 
-PRON- face be white even under the luminous green glow that affect -PRON- 
god -PRON- breathe in amazement 
allie with a leap sand jump to -PRON- side on the platform 
an inquisition the high chief raise an arm a menacingly and a thin shaft of green light shot from the suckerlike tip at the end 
sand place a wearied hand over -PRON- eye a small round spot the color of chalk appear on -PRON- brow as -PRON- sink to the floor heavily 
allie lane move -PRON- finely shaped head with -PRON- brown hair hang in thin wisps curl around -PRON- temple and stare blankly at -PRON- fallen lover 
-PRON- quiver slightly and raise -PRON- dainty white hand to -PRON- temple as though strive to bring a return of memory 
presently -PRON- give -PRON- up with a shudder and continue to stare straight in front of -PRON- 
the gaze rest upon -PRON- i feel and i shift -PRON- own uneasily helplessly 
the grotesque people of the underground have display -PRON- protective power on several occasion and i be aware of what -PRON- fate would be if i interfere to aid -PRON- friend 
whether sand be dead or merely stunned i could not guess but i accept the former readily enough 
expect momentarily to feel the tingle of radium ray carry -PRON- into oblivion i hang -PRON- head 
i stand limply at the edge of the platform full of sorrow over the turn of affair 
here be sand at the end of a fortyyear search for -PRON- lose sweetheart the only live thing that have keep -PRON- alive and there be allie lane probably break in mind and spirit and unable to go to -PRON- 
now i think -PRON- life be snuff out while -PRON- stand on the very verge of complete happiness 
i offer a prayer to -PRON- maker to reunite -PRON- again and let -PRON- enjoy the happiness that be -PRON- by right of nature and heritage didnot think how strange -PRON- be at the time for allie lane to be sit there as fresh in the glory of youth as -PRON- be when the photograph have be make of -PRON- back in kansas city forty year ago i only know that -PRON- have find -PRON- 
i look at sand 
-PRON- be lie in a heap where -PRON- have fall 
no move have be make on the part of the giant tunneldweller to aid -PRON- 
certainly i could not one move and i would meet with the same fate 
i be not ready to die 
i strain hard to think of some way to help -PRON- to learn if -PRON- be dead 
-PRON- mind be a blank and seem not to function 
some irresistible influence be smother all think 
-PRON- be then i realize that i be be question by the high chief on the throne 
i cast a quick glance past allie lane at -PRON- 
-PRON- antennae tube be point straight toward -PRON- 
i feel the strange power that seem to pass from -PRON- tube to -PRON- mind 
i shudder for -PRON- give -PRON- a terrific pain at the base of -PRON- nevertheless i steel -PRON- for the ordeal of question that i know would follow 
a peculiar feeling come over -PRON- 
i feel that i be gradually rise out of -PRON- physical body 
-PRON- be an incredible sensation 
then -PRON- brain grasp a vibratory mental question 
i seem in a trance 
-PRON- man of the earth what bring -PRON- into forbid country 
the peculiar eerie question give -PRON- a faint feeling that some time in the dim past i have hear -PRON- ask of -PRON- through a similar process 
i glance down at -PRON- foot 
-PRON- be invisible 
i seem to hang eye only suspend in a murky haze 
before -PRON- on the throne sit the three silent figure glow brightly and tinge with a greenish hue 
sand inert body seem to have vanish 
i strove to answer -PRON- questioner 
-PRON- lip move but i could hear no word 
-PRON- brain tell -PRON- that an answer be take definite shape but -PRON- would not be the answer the monster seek country here in america 
i answer -PRON- silently 
why -PRON- must be crazy 
at that -PRON- saucerlike eye blink rapidly 
-PRON- froglike beak open and a red fiery tongue flick out of a luminous opening that be -PRON- throat 
the chamber be in stony silence 
only the click of the high huge eyelid break the stillness 
-PRON- man of the earth the word telegraph to -PRON- brain 
dare -PRON- jest with -PRON- 
do -PRON- know that abaris second in command of jupiter and the entire universe have the power and the right to forbid anything or condemn any world -PRON- word strike -PRON- as inexplicably funny 
how silly and absurd i think be this sudden boast of power from such a hideous grotesque freak 
have -PRON- ever hear of the great army of the united state that could fly over the manalava plain and annihilate -PRON- entire band of froglike freak 
hardly i think 
i feel -PRON- lip curl up in scorn at -PRON- vanity what right have -PRON- to condemn and destroy 
i ask more control 
-PRON- flat beak open in a froggish attempt to laugh 
a peculiar cackling sound issue from -PRON- cavernous throat 
-PRON- seem to be enjoy -PRON- hugely 
for a lowly creature like -PRON- man of the earth who be doom -PRON- speak strong word 
what right have i to annihilate -PRON- 
why ignorant one i have the right by all the power of the universe 
i have the power of civilization ten million year in advance of -PRON- aboriginal power -PRON- -PRON- superior by millenium could condemn -PRON- earth to complete and instantaneous destruction should -PRON- so desire 
this lengthy message telegraph to -PRON- stunned brain cause -PRON- to wonder what sort of being these creature be from where -PRON- have come and what be -PRON- mission here 
certainly the owleyed freak talk like a military lord 
i begin to feel that i be the proverbial mouse and the cat be merely play with -PRON- for hist own amusement 
the strange power the high chief have display in strike sand to the floor awe -PRON- considerably 
of a certainty -PRON- man on earth boast of no such strange weapon that shoot pencilthin light ray and kill instantly and silently 
perhaps this giant freak be not boast after all 
in spite of -PRON- sudden fear that perhaps this tribe of strange creature may be able to bring into play power far superior to -PRON- own i still feel contempt and scorn for -PRON- 
to have -PRON- partner -PRON- friend in year of toil and sorrow suddenly strike down by the beast when -PRON- have find joy be enough to bring out -PRON- hatred 
the fact that -PRON- hold captive two human being like -PRON- one a woman under a strange influence only pile fuel onto the fire of -PRON- fury 
what have -PRON- do with -PRON- friend abaris great and exalted ruler of the boundless universe 
i sneer contemptuously a great and glorious ruler as -PRON- must take great pleasure in strike down an unarmed man smite the hand that harm man of the earth -PRON- soundless word shoot back hostilely be not the hand that harm brave abaris 
-PRON- be the hand of love and loyalty with a mind of sorrow and grief 
abaris explain this juncture i shoot a glance at allie lane profile be beautiful as -PRON- turn toward the grotesque creature sit majestically at -PRON- side 
-PRON- eye look up into the owlish orb appealingly 
-PRON- heart jump suddenly and i feel a lump rise in -PRON- throat 
the high chief abaris look down at -PRON- though wide lid 
one of -PRON- snaky tubelike arm writhe upward and encircle -PRON- soft shoulder 
-PRON- head tube hang droop in apparent affection for this beautiful girl for whom sand have spend the good part of -PRON- life in constant search 
i curse the huge beast roundly understand -PRON- now 
the frightful brute have save allie lane from a horrible death and through some process unknown to man -PRON- have retain within -PRON- the youth and beauty that be -PRON- when -PRON- find -PRON- at the edge of the radium pool 
-PRON- must have jealously guard that youth through the passing of the year that have make 
sand -PRON- loyal suitor an old and broken man 
what be the secret of the strange process 
be -PRON- the radioactive quality of the radium that have retain -PRON- youth as well as restore the youth of driftin sand 
if so then why hadnot i go through the same change 
then i remember that sand have accidentally dip -PRON- finger into the radium pool burn off the tip 
the radium must then have send lifegive quality surge through -PRON- vein and restore the worn and fray nerve and tissue of -PRON- body the same injection but through a different process i think must have be apply to the youthful body of allie lane 
-PRON- father too must necessarily have go through the same procedure else how could -PRON- have be restore to youth 
why have -PRON- be permit to live at all 
surely now -PRON- year have pass the century mark 
but i think allie lane would have be well off have -PRON- die at the pool 
with such a beast as the frogfeature abaris constantly in -PRON- vision and shower -PRON- with -PRON- affection a terrible life at best must have be her and abaris must have read sand thought too before -PRON- strike the man down 
-PRON- seem to take great pride in -PRON- possession of the beautiful feminine creature i feel and guard -PRON- zealously from pther 
suddenly -PRON- subconscious mind reel under the pressure of abaris strange power of mental telepathy 
-PRON- roll -PRON- great bald head aside and with owlish eye languidly regard -PRON- 
-PRON- gaze become fasten on -PRON- steadily blink lid 
-PRON- metallic as -PRON- open and close sound dismally throughout the chamber which be now light only with a pale green glow 
the three figure on the throne a deep green but tinge with a brilliant red aurora sit quietly 
i wonder what have become of driftin sand 
abaris grotesque feature stand out abruptly and seem almost as fair as allie lane and -PRON- father under the mixture of color that glow from the green and red hue 
-PRON- great eye bore into -PRON- so deeply that i feel a sudden panic seize -PRON- 
-PRON- ignorant man of the earth have see the power of jupiter great and most powerful planet in the universe 
abaris word booming and unspoken reach -PRON- mind 
i think -PRON- strange that these grotesque being could converse in -PRON- own language and by mental process at that 
yes i admit reluctantly have see -PRON- but do -PRON- know that one of -PRON- american bombing plane could fly over here and blow -PRON- and -PRON- crowd to hell 
abaris froglike feature part in a grin 
-PRON- throat rattle mirthfully 
i stare at -PRON- awe 
hoh hoh hoooah -PRON- mind throb under the force of -PRON- booming mental laugh 
why lowly worm -PRON- shoot -PRON- tube point straight at -PRON- if i but minded to i could destroy -PRON- entire world with one little globule of radium 
what do -PRON- mean i ask with a sudden desire to learn all i could concern these stranger and -PRON- aweinsipire power this 
abaris say evenly and with sarcasm -PRON- of jupiter be so far -PRON- superior that -PRON- be but worm in comparison 
when -PRON- people be still cling by -PRON- tail -PRON- of jupiter have already master mathematic 
during the year that follow and develop -PRON- to -PRON- present state -PRON- of jupiter master many science one of which bring -PRON- to -PRON- world now 
that be radium 
-PRON- have mastered radium in all -PRON- form and -PRON- be therefore master of the universe and all life in -PRON- 
well i say why didnot -PRON- destroy -PRON- here on earth then if -PRON- be so powerful 
how do -PRON- get here on this earth if -PRON- planet be jupiter 
-PRON- man of the earth -PRON- say amuse as though enjoy the mental conversation immensely and take great pride in the vast knowledge of -PRON- people -PRON- do not take life without cause even though that life be no more to -PRON- than -PRON- reptile be to -PRON- then why do -PRON- kill -PRON- friend i query earnestly 
why have -PRON- hold these two white people with -PRON- 
-PRON- friend be unhurt physically but mentally -PRON- now belong to jupiter 
-PRON- intention be doubtful when -PRON- leap up here beside eloli whom -PRON- feeble mind refer to as allie lane 
i should have kill -PRON- instantly feel unable to think of anything for a moment and i stare fascinate at the feature that confront -PRON- 
i notice that the color in the chamber be change again and that the lackadaisical visage of abaris be grow more pronounced under the varying hue 
-PRON- saucerlike eyelid continue -PRON- resounding like the sound of shutter close on a camera donot believe -PRON- abaris -PRON- voice suddenly raise 
-PRON- kill -PRON- because -PRON- know that -PRON- be allie man by all the law of humanity ion this world care -PRON- jovian for the law of -PRON- humanity abaris think wave strike -PRON- sharply could have kill -PRON- both instantly 
-PRON- be trespass on forbid ground and i therefore have the right to remove -PRON- from -PRON- do -PRON- know -PRON- be here i ask sentinel on the surface inform -PRON- of -PRON- come long before -PRON- reach here 
-PRON- have no intention of harm -PRON- unless -PRON- enter the crater that s why -PRON- hang up these skeleton out there to scare -PRON- away eh 
i inquire 
do -PRON- think a few grinning skull would make -PRON- run the skeleton of anything on this earth tend to frighten away the living 
abaris declare nonchalantly 
even a dog will run from the bone of -PRON- kind why not -PRON- who be just a step higher intellectually than the dog a brag cuss arenot -PRON- abaris 
i shoot back with contempt and sarcasm be misinform as to the status of the human race on this world i could think up a well way to frighten a man than that of jupiter have many way to frighten a man if -PRON- like to call -PRON- such 
but -PRON- see -PRON- be not particularly interested in whether -PRON- frighten or not 
-PRON- and -PRON- friend and these two human beside -PRON- be the first to have come here since -PRON- arrive from jupiter 
-PRON- feel no need of method to frighten other away 
-PRON- disappear lord 
i think have these creature come to this world from another planet at a time when -PRON- on this world be cross the country in oxdrawn wagon train 
have -PRON- arrive here before allie lane and -PRON- father wander into the manalava plain 
yes man of the earth abaris mental wave reach -PRON- in answer to -PRON- thought 
-PRON- drop down from jupiter long before -PRON- people begin cross -PRON- continent 
-PRON- have be here exactly one hundred of -PRON- year and -PRON- be now ready to return to jupiter if that interest -PRON- 
-PRON- work here be complete 
-PRON- return soon to -PRON- own world four hundred million mile away 
four hundred million mile -PRON- mind whirl with staggering figure and i give -PRON- up can understand -PRON- mathematical deduction abaris i say but just the same from missouri and -PRON- have to prove to -PRON- that -PRON- cover all that space just to visit this world 
-PRON- be hard to believe that any living thing can exist long enough to do -PRON- 
-PRON- donot sound possible one of the failing of -PRON- man of the earth abaris say evenly 
-PRON- think that everything that do not come within -PRON- scope of understanding be impossible 
-PRON- of jupiter long ago achieve immortality 
but why should abaris second in command of the great jupiter explain to a lowly creature such as -PRON- the vastly important fact of interplanetary travel 
-PRON- could tell -PRON- so i may inform -PRON- fellow on this earth that -PRON- be actually perform 
otherwise have to call -PRON- a liar i say with a false show of bravado 
so far no harm have come to -PRON- and abaris have inform -PRON- that sand suffer no permanent physical injury 
i could afford to hold up -PRON- chin and meet on equal term with the grotesque frogman of jupiter 
what be -PRON- anyhow but unreal mechanical freak 
well to tell the truth -PRON- world will never learn the secret from a jovian man of the earth abaris think vibration seem to say may say that some day -PRON- scientist may evolve a medium for interplanetary travel and -PRON- of jupiter do not intend to shorten the period of time when -PRON- will eventually try to visit -PRON- 
-PRON- will not be welcome give -PRON- a lot more credit than -PRON- have be say be due -PRON- abaris i remark with a grin glad -PRON- have come around to to that 
-PRON- make -PRON- feel well to know that a little more intelligent than a crawl worm 
suddenly the chamber brighten under the brilliance of powerful ray 
small sphere spin rapidly and glow luminously shoot restlessly to and fro in the far end of the chamber 
at the sound -PRON- make i instinctively turne to -PRON- for several second 
when -PRON- eye again return to abaris and -PRON- two human companion -PRON- be go -PRON- have vanish apparently in thin air during the few short second -PRON- eye have wander around the brilliantly light chamber 
save for an inert heap lie on the throne in the same position that i have see sand when -PRON- have fall the chamber be completely desert 
the sphere continue -PRON- back and forth movement as i dash quickly to sand side 
at the close range i discover that -PRON- body be tinge with the same luminous glow that i have see outline the body of abaris allie lane and -PRON- father 
sand seem stunned 
-PRON- be breathe but -PRON- lung function laboriously 
sand i cry shake -PRON- by the shoulder 
be -PRON- hurt 
from -PRON- lip issue a deep groan 
i swing -PRON- inert body around for a look at -PRON- face 
the color of -PRON- be a deep green than -PRON- have be before 
i stretch -PRON- out flat on -PRON- back and rub -PRON- numbed hand to restore -PRON- circulation but -PRON- avail -PRON- nothing 
then i remember that on -PRON- desert prospect i always carry a square lump of camphor in -PRON- pocket to rub on -PRON- lip when -PRON- become parch from the heat 
i search through -PRON- pocket for -PRON- and be overjoyed when i find -PRON- 
-PRON- be soft and spongy 
quickly i massage sand lip and nostril 
whether camphor would serve in the place of the more powerful spirit of ammonia i do not know but -PRON- can imagine -PRON- joy when -PRON- lid suddenly flutter and -PRON- lip part 
the camphor fume have actually bring -PRON- out of the faint into which the powerful ray from abaris deadly weapon have throw -PRON- laugh nervously -PRON- old timer 
i say snap out of -PRON- 
the devil say -PRON- didnot hurt -PRON- get to get allie and -PRON- father out of here 
these freak be plan to get away from here in a hurry take allie and -PRON- dad with -PRON- 
sit still and take -PRON- easy for a minute sand sit very still for several minute -PRON- head rest in -PRON- hand 
i squat on the floor of the platform beside -PRON- -PRON- eye scour every side of the circular chamber 
to the right the entrance into the chamber through which have come allie lane -PRON- father and abaris stand open 
the huge circular rock which must have weigh many ton have not be replace over the opening 
the most conspicuous thing in the entire chamber be the fairsized globe in the center rest on an axis and revolve rapidly 
from the distance i could see that -PRON- be line with many crisscross marking and glow as though contain a transparent liquid of a beautiful emerald color much similar to colored glass globe gener350 all display in drug store window in the city 
occasionally the brilliant sphere that hang spin in midair dart suddenly toward the large globe in the center 
when one of the small sphere near -PRON- the central ball emit a peculiar highpitche hum 
the globe combine with the darting light give -PRON- the impression that -PRON- must be use by the jovian for some astronomical purpose 
the big sphere i think must represent the home planet of the grotesque being 
what else could -PRON- be use for i wonder but i be due to learn much before i get out of there 
sand recover sand stand erect 
-PRON- lookr ed around -PRON- for several second evidently to get -PRON- bearing 
i watch -PRON- nervously 
what have abaris mean when -PRON- say that mentally sand belong to jupiter 
i know when i look into sand eye 
like fathomless abysse -PRON- eye glow like sulphurous fire 
the pupil have grow until -PRON- seem to disappear into the rim entirely 
-PRON- seem to be in the same trance that have hold allie and -PRON- father eye stare straight ahead without apparently comprehensive power 
hold in the embrace of the strange hypnotism that have probably force allie and -PRON- father to do the slight bidding of the froglike creature sand truly belong to jupiter 
at once i resign -PRON- to whatever fate may be in store for -PRON- for i could not hope for any cooperation from sand 
when i speak to -PRON- -PRON- merely stare blankly although i be certain that -PRON- understand -PRON- word 
-PRON- lip move to answer but no word form in -PRON- throat 
-PRON- seem to have be stricken dumb 
suddenly i begin an attempt to converse with -PRON- through the strange mental telepathy of the jovian but try as i may i receive no response 
-PRON- be a doomed man unless abaris would restore -PRON- to -PRON- normal self shake -PRON- by the arm think i say to -PRON- point to the opening from which abaris have come into the chamber and into which -PRON- have doubtless vanish that -PRON- have better find allie lane and -PRON- father if -PRON- hope to get out of here alive 
-PRON- know that -PRON- s here and alive donot -PRON- sand to -PRON- -PRON- appear that -PRON- make an attempt to speak when -PRON- hear name mention but -PRON- merely stare dumbly 
at any rate i believe -PRON- understand what i have say nudge -PRON- and -PRON- tremble under the touch -PRON- can get to allie and -PRON- father without these critter know -PRON- i whisper into -PRON- ear -PRON- may be able to point a way out of here 
if -PRON- can get out strike toward stovepipe well and send a telegram to los angele ask for help afraid well need a couple of bombing plane from san pedro to get -PRON- out of this mess grab -PRON- by the arm and hustle -PRON- toward the circular shaft lead from the chamber 
-PRON- come readily enough but when i loosen the pressure on -PRON- arm -PRON- stand there stock still 
-PRON- seem to have no will power whatever and -PRON- leg move only because i hustle -PRON- along 
perhaps the grip of the strange influence that hold -PRON- would soon vanish i think 
but for the present -PRON- remain in -PRON- embrace physically and mentally 
as -PRON- enter the only open shaft lead out of the chamber a highpitched musical note become audible 
i wonder if -PRON- movement have sound some mysterious warning 
as -PRON- continue on into the luminous tunnel that glitter with deposit of priceless gem the musical note rise high and higher so that -PRON- seem to tax the sense of hear to -PRON- uttermost 
questioningly i turn to sand 
one of -PRON- tremble hand be chafe -PRON- temple with thumb and forefinger 
the sound gradually become a wail ilke the metallic scream -PRON- have hear before enter the cave that lead down to the chamber 
suddenly i become aware that sand have break the influence that have hold -PRON- 
with a frenzied scream -PRON- leap aside and away from -PRON- 
i gaze in wonder at the man as -PRON- crouch like a beast at bay 
i expect -PRON- momentarily to spring at -PRON- throat 
but -PRON- finally recognize -PRON- and become control when i assure -PRON- the jovian be not in sight 
-PRON- first question be of allie lane 
have -PRON- really see -PRON- -PRON- want to know or have -PRON- be suffer from a brain fever 
be -PRON- really alive as beautiful as ever 
i assure -PRON- that -PRON- be 
lord -PRON- gasp shudder 
that noise would drive a man insane 
yes i whisper softly but -PRON- ought to thank -PRON- for bring -PRON- to -PRON- sense i believe the shrill sound be actually responsible for -PRON- recovery do -PRON- mean -PRON- ask blankly -PRON- know that the big chief of these freak bounce -PRON- for jump onto the platform donot remember anything but that see or dream see allie lane alive -PRON- say disconsolately 
well i explain the high chief who call -PRON- by the name of abaris didnot like the idea of -PRON- get familiar with allie and -PRON- knock -PRON- out cold 
i think -PRON- kill -PRON- and -PRON- may have at that have -PRON- want to 
i think -PRON- be a goner get a hell of a nerve then -PRON- explode -PRON- face twitch in terrible rage that under the glow of green make -PRON- almost as grotesque as abaris -PRON- love allie lane all -PRON- life and now that find -PRON- nothing but death will stop -PRON- from have -PRON- havenot find -PRON- yet sand i remind -PRON- softly somewhere down this tunnel 
i think -PRON- ought to get to -PRON- as soon as -PRON- can 
those devil be go to leave here probably take allie with -PRON- do -PRON- think -PRON- can get away so quick -PRON- inquire donot know that yet i say 
but well soon find out 
for perhaps several hundred foot -PRON- pick -PRON- way hug the gemstudde wall along the tunnel though which allie lane have enter the chamber 
overhead small ball of light flit occasionally illuminate the entire passageway 
-PRON- encounter several small passageway branch off from the main shaft but -PRON- continue along the wide thoroughfare 
what have become of the jovian 
i wonder as -PRON- slowly edge -PRON- way along the wall 
the only thing that seem to mark -PRON- existence in the great underground maze of tunnel and cavern deep below death valley be the persistent highpitche musical note that smash into the eardrum with an unending viciousness 
the underground search -PRON- footstep lead -PRON- into another circular chamber somewhat large than the one into which abaris have come 
this great room be illuminate by dart light which expose unit of rapidly revolve machinery from which emanate the highpitched musical note 
i motion sand to halt until -PRON- study the apparatus 
in -PRON- appraisal of the machinery -PRON- see what appear to be perhaps a half dozen cylindrical tube that stand upright spin rapidly 
over each glow a pale green luminosity 
the basis of the cylinder go through the hard rock floor of the chamber and -PRON- spin movement create a terrific suction for the air in the cavern be swirl 
attach to each of the cylinder be hundred of small tube that give off a deep green ray for -PRON- entire length 
one tube run from the cylinder to a central manifold to which be attach a large tube that fairly sputter and glow under a force similar to but more powerful than a great vacuum tube 
audible even above the noise that be create by the rapid whirl of the peculiar machine come the steady rhythmic throb of centrifugal pump 
the throb be the same sound that -PRON- have hear while -PRON- stand for the first time on the rim overlook the crater contain the radium pool 
light float above the spin machinery 
-PRON- make little bright spot in the luminous green that form the drafty atmosphere like lantern be swing rapidly in a murky fog 
i turn to sand who be stand just behind -PRON- stare over -PRON- shoulder intently watch the motion of the machinery and the darting light begin to believe abaris now i whisper in -PRON- ear 
these devil be actually drain this world of an unknown radium deposit 
all this machinery the sphere and light must be operate by radium power of intensity that be not possess in the small quantity that -PRON- have find so far that may be so pardner sand place -PRON- lip close to -PRON- ear but interested in allie lane nothing else find -PRON- give -PRON- an assure nudge and -PRON- edge -PRON- way along the wall of the circular chamber maintain a safe distance from the whirl machinery for -PRON- seem possess with a powerful magnetism 
i would like to have study -PRON- closer but something seem to warn -PRON- to remain a safe distance away from whirl cylinder which spin like electrical generator with the tube connect like generate brush 
i may be draw into the whirl thing and be suck to death be still awe over the sudden disappearance of the jovian and feel that -PRON- absence spell some sinister disaster to -PRON- 
i momentarily expect some of -PRON- to appear and seize -PRON- 
with an effort i cast off the feeling and -PRON- continue along the chamber wall 
suddenly -PRON- come to an exit shaft just high enough to admit a jovian without bend 
i raise an arm to estimate the height of the ceiling 
-PRON- fingertip just scrape -PRON- 
the tunnel be in total darkness and this appear to be the only exit from the chamber with the exception of the one through which -PRON- have enter 
-PRON- clung hand in hand as -PRON- go into -PRON- 
-PRON- have not go more than a dozen step until -PRON- be envelop in an inky blackness 
certainly i think the jovian must be aware through -PRON- peculiar mental telepathy that -PRON- be explore -PRON- secret chamber 
why didnot -PRON- swoop down upon -PRON- and challenge -PRON- progress 
perhaps i think -PRON- do not figure -PRON- worthwhile believe that -PRON- would eventually lose -PRON- in the network of underground vista tunnel and chamber and die as the result 
-PRON- be a grim outlook for both of -PRON- at best but i have one thing the assurance of abaris -PRON- that the jovian have no intention of harm -PRON- seriously 
on the other hand neither would -PRON- go out of -PRON- way to aid -PRON- 
that be certain eventually -PRON- become somewhat accustomed to the inky blackness of the tunnel and -PRON- be able to make out the form of each other 
stare straight ahead i discover what i accept to be a small circular hole through which come a faint luminosity 
-PRON- make for -PRON- as rapidly as -PRON- could although -PRON- be extremely cautious and fearful lest -PRON- step into one of the bottomless abyss which i feel exist in the underground world 
-PRON- edge -PRON- way along the tunnel for perhaps a quarter of a mile before -PRON- eventually come to the circular light which -PRON- have see 
i be not surprised when -PRON- find that -PRON- be an en352 trance or an exit of another chamber 
-PRON- approach -PRON- carefully not know what may lie ahead 
-PRON- have no intention of expose -PRON- to the ire of abaris could -PRON- help -PRON- 
-PRON- want to find allie lane and -PRON- father now that -PRON- too be alive 
i crawl on hand and knee to the tunnel outlet 
sand be on the opposite side of the hole 
-PRON- peer intently into the chamber which be brilliantly light 
the white brightness of the light give -PRON- an impression that -PRON- emanate from the sun -PRON- blind -PRON- temporarily 
the chamber be decorate gorgeously in purple and gold drape that hang suspend from the room wall 
massive metal chair like the three on the platform back in the first chamber stand in artistic position 
on one side of the wall drape with a yellow cloth of metal that glisten like fire in the brilliant light hang a great sheet of glasslike material that mirror other object in the chamber 
under -PRON- stand a golden dressing table at which be a frail silver bench 
truly i think as i survey the mirror vanity and bench these object could be of no use to anyone except a beautiful woman the thought give birth to another idea 
perhaps this be the room to which allie lane have be confine 
-PRON- eye wander to the far end of the chamber 
to -PRON- surprise there stand near the wall a massive couch that seem to have be hew from a great emerald block 
-PRON- covering be of a soft silken material edge with gold as i stare at the beautiful piece -PRON- eye detect a slight movement of the covering 
i look on the couch awestruck 
reunion before -PRON- very eye and apparently alone lie allie lane on the silken cover emerald couch 
from underneath -PRON- brilliant robe protrude a dainty foot and ankle 
-PRON- face lie bury in -PRON- arm and -PRON- body wrack with silent sob -PRON- brown hair shimmer in the glare of the light 
i look at sand across the tunnel outlet 
-PRON- stare intently at the reclining figure -PRON- mouth agape 
-PRON- allow a hand to run nervously across -PRON- brow as though to gain assurance that -PRON- eye be not play -PRON- false 
then i make a careful scrutiny of the chamber to make certain that allie be alone 
sand i hiss in low undertone that could not have be hear beyond the few foot that separate -PRON- -PRON- chance allie lane on that couch sob for -PRON- 
go to -PRON- partner stay here and watch 
sand look at -PRON- for an instant then take -PRON- hand -PRON- squeeze -PRON- until -PRON- finger ache 
thank pard be all -PRON- say but -PRON- eye show what word would fail to tell 
release -PRON- grip on -PRON- hand -PRON- step softly into the chamber and stride lightly with a buoyant step toward the silken couch 
a lump rise in -PRON- throat as i watch -PRON- move swiftly toward the girl -PRON- have go through hell to find 
few man would have remain loyal as -PRON- to this slip of a girl and hunt in every nook of california for more than forty long weary year -PRON- be -PRON- great love for -PRON- in the first place -PRON- beautiful sense of loyalty that have cause -PRON- to join -PRON- in the last few year of -PRON- search 
now -PRON- be at -PRON- side 
allie 
allie -PRON- voice softly appeal come to -PRON- where i squat silently guard the chamber 
-PRON- eye wander around the room nothing escape -PRON- 
again come sand appeal call 
i look at -PRON- as -PRON- stand beside the couch arm outstretche 
the girl lie perfectly still now and -PRON- face remain bury in -PRON- arm as though fearful to look up 
slowly -PRON- head turn 
from where i squat i could see -PRON- profile as -PRON- turn towards sand tear like pearl stream down -PRON- cheek 
i expect to see again -PRON- sweet feature stare mutely blank as -PRON- be before -PRON- when i first behold -PRON- 
suddenly the girl sit upright and turn -PRON- face up to sand 
-PRON- eye widen in amazement and fright 
i watch -PRON- closely temporarily forget -PRON- own swear duty to stand guard over the chamber 
would -PRON- recognize -PRON- lover of forty year ago i wonder if -PRON- really would 
or be -PRON- still under the spell of some strange jovian trance 
-PRON- blood pound at -PRON- temple in those few second of uncertainty 
i could imagine -PRON- amazement at see sand but i could not comprehend -PRON- delay in fly to -PRON- embrace if -PRON- still love -PRON- 
-PRON- sit very still stare up into sand luminous green feature with -PRON- month growth of beard 
perhaps -PRON- radium affliction and -PRON- beard have puzzle -PRON- i think 
that be true 
-PRON- do not recognize -PRON- immediately as the result 
for long minute -PRON- stare at -PRON- through glisten tear 
then with a soft cry allie lane literally fly into -PRON- arm 
sand squeeze -PRON- close to -PRON- -PRON- face bury in -PRON- tumble brown hair 
a feeling of exultation and of triumph surge through -PRON- whole body and i slap -PRON- thigh with joy 
i be immensely happy 
but -PRON- joy be short live 
i always be more or less of a crank and -PRON- happiness soon flee before a cloud of gloom that form sinister thought in -PRON- brain 
now that sand and allie lane be together again how be -PRON- to escape from the underground outpost of jupiter 
if -PRON- do succeed in find -PRON- way out of the maze of tunnel how do -PRON- expect to traverse death valley without water 
-PRON- be impossible 
better have -PRON- all remain hidden far below death burn surface than to expose -PRON- to the sinister power of abaris or the terrible fatal heat of the surface meanwhile -PRON- attention be draw again to the two lover as -PRON- stand beside the silken couch 
allie nestle close to the broad powerful chest of -PRON- sweetheart and speak to -PRON- in a low musical voice 
quickly i glance around the room try not to listen to -PRON- 
i have already a violent feeling of be an intruder on -PRON- reunion 
oh robert -PRON- voice tense with both fright and joy 
how do -PRON- ever find -PRON- why do -PRON- risk -PRON- life to come here in the midst of these terrible creature so afraid love -PRON- sand whisper affectionately love -PRON- better than life -PRON- search for -PRON- for many year and i would have continue search until i could no longer crawl at last i have find -PRON- allie and i shall never leave -PRON- again why robert -PRON- suddenly exclaim 
-PRON- havenot search for -PRON- for many year 
-PRON- couldnot have because -PRON- be just the same bob sand -PRON- be when -PRON- start to california 
why do -PRON- let those terrible whisker grow 
i donot like -PRON- 
allie emit a little musical laugh then continue 
-PRON- must shave those horrible whisker off at once -PRON- know allie dear that -PRON- have be lose from -PRON- for over forty year forget just exactly how many year be search so long that lose track of time 
sand whisper softly look into -PRON- expressive eye 
a smile play at the corner of -PRON- lip 
-PRON- be fool robert -PRON- say search -PRON- face for proof of jest 
-PRON- just couldnot be 
why robert be an old woman now if -PRON- be true be almost sixty 
lord 
i gasp to -PRON- as i stand guard over the chamber and this secret love tryst between allie lane and driftin sand -PRON- know that -PRON- s be lose to the world for over forty year 
poor girl 
sand oughtnot to tell -PRON- then again -PRON- may be good for -PRON- to know everything listen intently for now i want to learn any information that allie may give to sand regard the grotesque jovian and -PRON- plan 
the information may aid -PRON- materially in find way and mean of escape -PRON- 
how to escape be cry softly hard to believe -PRON- robert i know that -PRON- wouldnot lie to -PRON- but -PRON- do seem impossible 
why just the same as i be when -PRON- leave -PRON- back in kansas city i donot seem to have grow old 
let -PRON- look at -PRON- please dear 
allie walk with faltering step over to the huge mirror hang on the wall and stare into -PRON- -PRON- hand wander softly over -PRON- feature 
sand walk to -PRON- side and peer into the radium reflector 
the reflection -PRON- witness there cause -PRON- to leap aside 
for the first time -PRON- see -PRON- face since the radioactive quality of the radium have restore -PRON- youth 
here -PRON- be in reality an old man who have be suddenly return to youth 
and instead of see the visage of a wrinkled and weatherbeaten old man -PRON- behold the feature of robert sand as -PRON- be when -PRON- arrive in california forty year before 
-PRON- be a surprise beyond description of word 
-PRON- run a hand over -PRON- face incredulously 
take this opportunity to attract -PRON- attention i whistle softly 
-PRON- look up with a jerk and pat allie lightly on the shoulder -PRON- come to the entrance of the tunnel where i squat 
allie be stare into the mirror incredulously as though unable to believe that under ordinary circumstance -PRON- would be in the autumn of life on this earth that the beautiful face in the mirror would long ago have become wrinkled and shrink -PRON- better get father and try to get out of here sand 
i ask -PRON- 
those devil may show up any minute plum forget about -PRON- pardner -PRON- say apologetically forget about everything 
have -PRON- any idea how be go to get out of here 
i havenot 
maybe allie know of some way ask -PRON- yes ask -PRON- now i advise now or never with that -PRON- walk back to allie 
at the scrape sound of -PRON- boot -PRON- turn to -PRON- smile joyously dear i hear -PRON- whisper bring a friend of mine here stand guard to warn -PRON- if anyone come get -PRON- in this terrible predicament and i want to get -PRON- out get -PRON- and all of -PRON- out of here 
-PRON- want to go with -PRON- back to civilization donot -PRON- dear will go anywhere with -PRON- robert -PRON- say place -PRON- hand on -PRON- chest endearingly 
then dear can -PRON- tell -PRON- how to lead -PRON- out know of only one way to get out of here robert -PRON- whisper but abaris have guard there constantly afraid -PRON- could not get through -PRON- 
-PRON- neednot be afraid of abaris bob dear 
-PRON- have be very kind to -PRON- and daddy 
humph 
sand snort curtly 
-PRON- have not be so nice to -PRON- like to blast -PRON- to hell 
-PRON- knock -PRON- cold when i first see -PRON- allie out there on the throne see -PRON- there robert -PRON- ask 
and abaris harm -PRON- when -PRON- come near -PRON- do allie 
knock -PRON- plumb out and nearly kill -PRON- brute -PRON- say angrily 
well maybe well find a way out of here robert 
let -PRON- call father in the room next to -PRON- 
wait here sand return to the tunnel and squat in the semidarkness beside -PRON- 
-PRON- be breathe hard with excitement and there be a twinkle of joy and anticipation that form crow foot at the side of -PRON- eye 
-PRON- seem suddenly a very joyous man and forgetful of the sinister danger that hover over all of -PRON- 
what would happen i wonder if abaris suddenly come upon the secret love tryst of sand and -PRON- sweetheart 
would -PRON- fly into a sudden rage and destroy -PRON- with -PRON- terrible invisible weapon that shoot green pencilthin ray and kill instantly 
-PRON- sit silently sand with -PRON- thought of love and happiness i with thought of danger and death 
presently -PRON- hear a sound like the scraping of foot 
sand and i shrink close to the tunnel wall in the semidarkness 
-PRON- fear flee however when allie come into the chamber follow by -PRON- father 
lane appear at close range to be a man of about forty 
-PRON- hair be black and -PRON- eye be gray and penetrate 
-PRON- carriage be that of a man in -PRON- prime of life full of power and vigor and -PRON- eye flash as -PRON- search room nervously 
sand get to -PRON- foot and walk slowly into the light chamber 
lane stop abruptly and survey -PRON- with an incredulous stare 
suddenly -PRON- step swiftly to sand side -PRON- hand meet firmly give up all hope of ever see -PRON- again bob -PRON- say in a clear voice that tingle with excitement 
-PRON- be indeed a pleasure to have -PRON- with -PRON- again sure allie be glad 
thank mr lane sand return be a long time but struggle hard for this meeting fair well under condition -PRON- and allie but -PRON- have get to get away from these frogface freak here 
tell -PRON- what -PRON- know about a way out and well start at once 
just like -PRON- bob lane say admiringly 
-PRON- always do want to be the first to get start sit down and talk -PRON- over terribly afraid that well find -PRON- hard to get out however go through a lot sand whisper little more wouldnot amount to much 
maybe not bob lane interject with a frown 
but this be one time when -PRON- do not know what -PRON- be up against 
as much as like to get back home to -PRON- friend i canot see any definite way to escape 
but cooperate to the full for -PRON- and sake 
the three of -PRON- walk softly to silken couch and sit down allie close to sand -PRON- arm about -PRON- waist 
i hear a faint sound issue from the tunnel that lead from chamber 
i hold -PRON- breath in fear 
be abaris or some of -PRON- jovian come upon the scene 
-PRON- blood pound as i listen with -PRON- hand cup behind -PRON- ear to magnify any sound 
no more sound come and i breathe easy 
i turn again to the three in room 
lane be speak -PRON- voice in muffled tone reach -PRON- explain to -PRON- how -PRON- come to be here 
bob -PRON- be say so -PRON- wonot recount -PRON- again 
these strange people here claim -PRON- be from the planet jupiter and come here solely for the purpose of obtain a great supply of radium 
-PRON- seem that -PRON- have exhaust the supply on -PRON- own planet 
through delicate instrument abaris say -PRON- scientist discover that this earth contain a great deposit of the metal 
-PRON- henceforth set out to get -PRON- because life on -PRON- planet depend upon -PRON- for existence 
if abaris fail -PRON- mean that perhaps the entire population bf jupiter will be wipe out unless some other heavenly body be find to contain a deposit the devil do -PRON- ever get here 
sand ask interestedly 
story come to that now bob lane continue softly 
-PRON- sound quite impossible but -PRON- be a fact that abaris and -PRON- henchman leave jupiter in a great spherical machine similar to some of the sphere that -PRON- probably see on -PRON- way in here 
this sphere which be capable of interstellar travel propel by a radium process know only to -PRON- mechanic be ready at this minute to return to jupiter with the great stock of that metal 
for a long time -PRON- have be pump radium out of the earth and send -PRON- to jupiter in small sphere which be control and guide by an unknown source of power 
abaris say that the deposit here be about exhausted and the cylinder pump be bring up the last drop of radium exist in this earth 
abaris expect to halt the pump very soon and enter the interplanetary sphere for departure to jupiter 
-PRON- have say that -PRON- be to accompany -PRON- to -PRON- planet nd be unable to escape allie and i have resign -PRON- to whatever fate be in store for -PRON- 
i must admit that abaris have be very good to -PRON- and while -PRON- would certainly like to get back to -PRON- people i hold no animosity against -PRON- except of course that -PRON- appearance as be all the rest of -PRON- kind be horrify to -PRON- 
but -PRON- have become adapt to the environment yet -PRON- must naturally rebel against be spirit away from this glorious world of -PRON- to perhaps be regard on jupiter much in the same manner as -PRON- have look upon strange animal here sometime i have suspect that abaris in -PRON- grotesque way be exceptionally fond of allie 
-PRON- have want for nothing 
-PRON- every wish have be grant but -PRON- will not consent to -PRON- appearing before the multitude unless -PRON- submit to be place under a strange power 
in other word -PRON- be force to undergo hypnotism for a reason that i have not be able to learn 
that be why -PRON- do not see -PRON- when -PRON- stand before the platform in the throne chamber 
allie tell -PRON- there be one exit from this underground world and that be guard constantly either by the jovian -PRON- or -PRON- grotesque deathdeale mechanical guard in the shape of a cactus tree with arm like an octopus 
the mechanical jovian seem to have all the power of the creature -PRON- lack only -PRON- mental faculty 
unless control by a living hand -PRON- be helpless 
these jovian be really genius in all form 
-PRON- have see the series of sphere in the throne room with the large hall in the center 
the large sphere be jupiter in a miniature orbit 
the small sphere be -PRON- moon as good abaris explain to -PRON- 
through these -PRON- be able to watch the progress of -PRON- radium sphere as -PRON- shoot -PRON- way toward jupiter 
the large sphere show -PRON- passage very plainly 
but these explanation of jovian object and scientific genius be not get -PRON- to -PRON- goal 
so let -PRON- consider the possibility of escape 
i have a plan that -PRON- may be able to use listen intently to the plan of possible action as lane outline -PRON- to sand father explain that at a certain time the guard at the only avenue of escape would be change and the mechanical jovian with -PRON- tentaclelike arm control by a remote central would be put in -PRON- place 
lane explain how -PRON- have previously locate the source of control over the mechanical man and be therefore perhaps in the position to disconnect the control system and suspend -PRON- activity 
this sound like a very excellent plan but how i think would -PRON- be possible for -PRON- to steal near the central control apparatus in -PRON- attempt to disconnect -PRON- 
surely the jovian must maintain a constant guard over such delicate and important apparatus 
but on the other hand -PRON- may not feel a need of -PRON- in view of the fact that allie lane and -PRON- father have be with -PRON- so long that -PRON- accept -PRON- as be harmless 
at any rate sand approve of the plan and -PRON- be decide that the attempt to escape would be make at a time when lane be to give a low whistle and -PRON- would all meet in chamber providing of course that the way be clear 
lane with -PRON- forefinger draw an invisible outline show the tunnel through which -PRON- be to go 
sand watch -PRON- closely and absorb the information 
meanwhile i shoot rapid glance around the chamber in -PRON- entirety in -PRON- part as guard 
several time -PRON- heart jump when i hear sound that softly break the stillness of the cavern but the sound fail to bring what i expect the grotesque jovian 
sand be stand in the center of the room now allie lane in -PRON- arm 
-PRON- kiss endearingly father pace the floor nervously 
suddenly lane stop pace and face -PRON- daughter and -PRON- lover 
-PRON- open -PRON- lip to say something think well of -PRON- then turn half away 
-PRON- swing around presently as though -PRON- have decide on some question confront -PRON- and speak softly 
allie -PRON- word nervous and tense reach -PRON- 
-PRON- love 
bob donot -PRON- dear 
as well as life father -PRON- answer 
sand turn to look at lane puzzle 
suppose then lane return that -PRON- marry bob now 
-PRON- would be a good thing in the face of whatever confront -PRON- would marry -PRON- now father allie say in a half whisper that i barely catch 
but how 
-PRON- forget -PRON- dear that i be a minister back in kansas city -PRON- father smile wait a long time allie sand put in hold shoulder and look into -PRON- eye lovingly 
then i will marry -PRON- at once robert -PRON- say -PRON- eye shine with happy tear 
father can perform the ceremony 
catch 
i watch the procedure that follow forget -PRON- duty as guard in whose hand must rest the life of the happy three 
with -PRON- eye and attention on allie as -PRON- whisper do i fail to notice that abaris have suddenly come to the entrance of the chamber and be stand there silently regard the trio 
lane be say now pronounce -PRON- man and wife when i behold abaris tower form as -PRON- stand menacingly just inside the room 
the tube of -PRON- forehead stick out rigidly -PRON- tentaclelike arm twitch in anger and -PRON- owlish eye open and close rapidly 
i shrink back into the darkness of the tunnel fearful lest i be discover 
from -PRON- hiding place however i could see the entire chamber 
as though strike by some terrific force sand and lane at once spin around and face abaris 
allie emit a fearful little cry and shrink back against the wall 
abaris tube be point at -PRON- menacingly and i know that -PRON- be speak to -PRON- in -PRON- peculiar mental telepathy 
what word fly between -PRON- i be not able to catch for i have learn that i could not receive the wave vibration unless the tube be point directly at -PRON- 
suddenly i hear sand word as -PRON- angrily inform abaris that allie have just become -PRON- wife and that -PRON- be no man business what -PRON- be do in the chamber with -PRON- 
-PRON- feature twitch with grow anger as -PRON- speak -PRON- hand be clench 
-PRON- frogface 
i hear -PRON- shout search for allie lane for forty year 
now that i have find -PRON- and -PRON- have become -PRON- wife -PRON- nor anyone else can take -PRON- away from -PRON- alive eloli be the bride of jupiter man of the earth i catch the thunderous vibration from abaris tube which now wave spasmodically in all direction 
-PRON- thought be so powerful that -PRON- carry to -PRON- where i crouch 
allie lane be -PRON- wife cry sand hotly 
-PRON- die before -PRON- go with -PRON- to -PRON- planet of crazy freak yes abaris lane put in weakly shake as one palsied 
allie be this man wife 
-PRON- can not take -PRON- away from -PRON- 
if be the law of humanity 
abaris froglike beak open and then close with a resounding snap 
i expect -PRON- momentarily to bring into play -PRON- terrible invisible ray of death 
-PRON- skinny tubelike leg hold up -PRON- barrelshaped body admirably i think as i watch -PRON- from -PRON- hiding place 
-PRON- seem like stilt unjointed except at the hip around which be drape a narrow breech cloth of goldedge purple 
-PRON- body glisten oilily and around -PRON- bald misshapen head rest a thin metal band glow luminously green 
-PRON- antennae tube wave angrily go with abaris to jupiter abaris thunder -PRON- vibration reach -PRON- sharply 
i shudder under the force of -PRON- powerful think wave 
on jupiter -PRON- have specimen of many planetarial being 
-PRON- scientist would like to study specimen of the aborigine of this planet 
therefore the three of -PRON- will accompany -PRON- to jupiter 
eloli come as the bride of jove would die there abaris lane parry dejectedly 
-PRON- of this earth could not adapt -PRON- to -PRON- environment do not seem to understand man of the earth abaris vibration say that -PRON- of jupiter have accomplish immortality 
there be no death on jupiter 
will -PRON- come voluntarily or shall i be force to resort to other method 
from where i lie hide in terror i watch sand face 
in -PRON- anger -PRON- feature twist with fury 
i could not help -PRON- should -PRON- attempt to attack the huge jovian commander who stand before -PRON- 
if i only could how gladly i would have go into the chamber 
suddenly i hear a dismal hooting from somewhere behind abaris that gradually grow nearer 
i watch the opening of the tunnel behind -PRON- expect momentarily to see -PRON- follower enter the room 
two abreast -PRON- come -PRON- body shine with freshly apply oil -PRON- loin cover with shimmer breechcloth 
unlike abaris -PRON- wear no band around -PRON- huge head 
like soldier -PRON- line break in the center where abaris huge body stand like a pivot and -PRON- singlefile around the wall of the circular chamber shoot a quick glance at sand 
-PRON- stand belligerently watch 
allie have creep into -PRON- arm and bury -PRON- head against -PRON- bosom 
lane stare down at the floor downcast and utterly deject 
when i first behold lane i be impress with -PRON- flash eye and strong powerful body and have figure upon -PRON- cooperation at such a dire moment as this 
but perhaps i think -PRON- realize unlike sand and -PRON- the utter futility of object to the demand of the jovian 
but sand be of a different mettle 
slowly -PRON- move allie behind -PRON- and again face abaris 
the jovian line around the chamber wall stand apparently at attention 
-PRON- make no move to interfere 
have abaris order -PRON- to remain inactive rely upon -PRON- own power of combat to force the three human into submission 
sand shout insultingly at abaris 
-PRON- call off -PRON- dog and well settle this right now not afraid of -PRON- crazy light and even if i be rather die than submit to -PRON- abaris throat cackled with -PRON- peculiar laugh 
-PRON- owlish eye stare through unblinking lid 
sand approach -PRON- with sinister steadiness crouch ready to spring at the bulllike throat of the giant 
i stare at -PRON- fearfully 
here be the end i think as abaris tilt -PRON- huge head to look down upon -PRON- insignificant antagonist 
i glance around the chamber at the froggish jovian 
-PRON- continue to stand silently at attention 
the struggle a watch the unfold 5f the terrible scene in the chamber i find -PRON- wonder what i would do if sand actually attempt to fight -PRON- way through the deathdealing ray of the jovian 
-PRON- hand accidentally touch -PRON- gun butt and for the first time since i have use the weapon back in the first tunnel i remember that i still possess -PRON- 
i feel somewhat heartened at the reassuring touch but how useless -PRON- be in fight the grotesque frogman from the distant world surely -PRON- could not kill or disable -PRON- for hadnot i thumb a slug into the bony feature of one of -PRON- 
that slug would have kill a man instantly but the jovian have no more than croak as the lead tear through -PRON- head pat the gun affectionately and inspect the cylinder 
reload i snap -PRON- back into -PRON- holster with a grim determination that i would use -PRON- 
better have allie lane -PRON- father and driftin sand rest in peace on this earth than in mortal terror forever on jupiter i think 
suddenly -PRON- eye be bring back to the chamber by a curdling scream 
allie have faint as sand spring at the bulllike throat of abaris upset -PRON- in the suddenness of -PRON- attack 
lane stand petrified allie lie unmolested and unaide upon the floor 
just inside the chamber near the entrance sand and abaris seem lock in a terrible embrace of death 
chest to chest -PRON- lie on the floor 
sand on top holding in -PRON- powerful hand the thin rubberlike arm of the hideous bestialvisage ruler of the jovian 
sand grunt as -PRON- strain hard to hold abaris flexible arm to prevent -PRON- from bring into play the terrible weapon that seem to be conceal in the suckerlike tip at -PRON- end 
-PRON- seem like the conflict of two great force man and beast in a terrible battle for supremacy like good and evil angel and demon 
i be thrill at the great heroism of sand and -PRON- heart swell with the pride of have -PRON- loyal friendship 
slowly i edge -PRON- way toward the chamber keep well against the wall for a close view of the struggle 
as uneven as -PRON- seem sand i think be the well of the two physically 
but how could -PRON- hope to win such an unequal combat unarmed and against the terrible green death ray of abaris 
white man and planetarial beast 
no great contrast could be imagine 
the muscle in sand neck bulge as -PRON- labor to hold the tough flexible arm of abaris 
the skinny leg unjointed and stiltlike kick spasmodically poor protection against sand powerful limb 
from a well point of vantage i watch the struggle 
which of the two would win the terrible battle of physical force 
suddenly abaris give a great heave that cast sand clear from -PRON- barrellike body 
but sand hold with bull dog tenacity onto the writhe arm of the jovian leader struggle vainly to prevent abaris from aim -PRON- pencilthin emerald ray of destruction 
once abaris shoot -PRON- terrible ray and a jovian near -PRON- vanish entirely in a puff of acrid smoke a ray strike one of the huge chair and -PRON- crumble 
this combat i feel would be more like a wrestling match due to the fact that -PRON- seem impossible for abaris to rise on -PRON- stiltlike leg 
that much in favor of sand but what would happen to -PRON- if abaris succeed in strike -PRON- with a green ray shoot with uncontrollable anger study abaris bestial feature to see how -PRON- be accept the terrific throttling -PRON- be receive 
-PRON- owlish orb gleam flame red and stare bestially into sand set feature -PRON- terrible power of will burn into the man brain 
i cast a quick glance at allie 
-PRON- be just recover from -PRON- faint and -PRON- father be at -PRON- side 
from behind fluttering lid allie look at the struggle figure thrash about on the chamber floor 
-PRON- groan softly and hide -PRON- face sob 
watch -PRON- -PRON- muscle involuntarily become tense 
-PRON- breath come in gasp bear of sheer sympathy for sand and -PRON- long lose sweetheart 
slowly very slowly the dominating will power of abaris overcome the struggle physical force of sand 
gradually -PRON- ease -PRON- terrible grip on the writhe arm and steadily abaris be bring -PRON- suckerlike tip toward -PRON- antagonist 
realize -PRON- waning strength sand make a desperate effort to tear -PRON- eye from the blaze relentless orb of abaris turn -PRON- head to the side 
but struggle as -PRON- would with all the physical strength at -PRON- command -PRON- could not check the gradual domination of brainpower and will that be slowly but surely smother -PRON- to submission 
presently sand muscle relaxed and finally the terrific power of abaris dominating will sweep into the core of -PRON- brain overpower -PRON- 
i curse softly and hide -PRON- face in -PRON- hand for a second head drop to one side -PRON- powerful arm hang limply 
blood stream from -PRON- nostril cause by -PRON- tremendous physical effort 
i catch a glimpse of -PRON- eye as -PRON- head fall 
-PRON- be stark unseeing eye -PRON- body shudder convulsively as -PRON- slip inertly to the chamber floor 
abaris be hoisted erect by two of -PRON- jovian -PRON- tube wave victoriously a cackling laugh in -PRON- throat 
allie lane scream and -PRON- father stroke -PRON- shake head gently as abaris strode wobble like a duck toward -PRON- 
i look at sand 
-PRON- breathing be heavy and irregular 
abaris i think have not kill -PRON- outright nor have -PRON- bring into play -PRON- terrible ray 
-PRON- great mental power alone have completely subdue -PRON- 
slowly -PRON- hand steal to the butt of -PRON- gun 
with a jerk i snap the weapon out of -PRON- holster hold back the hammer with -PRON- thumb 
in a space of several second i could have hurl five slug at allie and -PRON- father and the inert form of sand 
the sixth i have plan be to crash through -PRON- own brain 
i level the gun at temple expose through a wisp of -PRON- soft brown hair but i could not find the heart tq release -PRON- thumb from the hammer 
suddenly i feel a wave of great remorse surge deep within -PRON- for not send a half dozen shoot into the owlish eye of abaris 
why hadn i shoot -PRON- as -PRON- lie there on the ground struggle under sand and clip the writhe arm from -PRON- body 
be i actually the kind of a coward who would stand by hide like a frightened jackrabbit while the life be be crush out of -PRON- dear and most loyal friend 
alone a rage fill -PRON- 
what would -PRON- wife think of -PRON- back at balch if -PRON- learn that i have stand idly by like a whip cur and permit those uncouth freak to commit a wrong against allie and -PRON- lover 
how could -PRON- child ever live down the cowardice of -PRON- father -PRON- be with these thought in -PRON- maddened brain that i suddenly dash out of the tunnel gun in hand and block abatis passage toward allie and -PRON- father 
i feel a terrible urge to kill to spill the blood or whatever -PRON- be that course through the vein of the frogface beast stop abaris i shout hysterically 
stop where -PRON- be kill -PRON- if -PRON- move -PRON- stare at -PRON- through flame owlish orb 
-PRON- froglike mouth open and there come from -PRON- cavernous throat the mocking cackling laugh 
-PRON- be madden -PRON- cackling indifference suddenly remember that -PRON- be within the power of these strange creature to render -PRON- weapon useless cause -PRON- to heat and burn -PRON- hand i lift the barrel from -PRON- hip and let fly 
swiftly and with the flame desire to kill pound at -PRON- brain i thumb the hammer of -PRON- gun in a row six round green hole appear just above abaris flame eye -PRON- totter for an instant and then recover -PRON- 
an emerald green liquid pour from the hole and run down into -PRON- owlish eye 
so rapidly be the slug hurl from -PRON- gun that the jovian do not instantly grasp -PRON- significance 
then abruptly the entire chamber seem alive with thin green ray that play with deadly precision around -PRON- 
abaris suddenly ill from the effect of the six slug pass through -PRON- head make a weak attempt to lift a tentaclelike arm 
-PRON- be with an effort that -PRON- bring -PRON- up 
i make a leap at -PRON- but i be too late 
a ray shoot from the tip of -PRON- fiendish arm i feel a tingle on -PRON- left side just over the heart 
the chamber floor seem to rush up as i fall heavily 
for several second i lie there in full command of -PRON- faculty but unable to move a muscle 
-PRON- head swam and i have a feeling that i be be hurl through space at a terrific speed 
then a terrible blackness overcome -PRON- and i seem to be fall into a yawn abyss 
how long i lie there i do not know 
for age -PRON- seem i lie on -PRON- back make no attempt to move but stare into an inky blackness overhead 
what have cause the chamber to become dark i wonder 
be -PRON- eye really open 
i pinch -PRON- 
i be not dead after all 
i listen attentively for some sound to indicate the presence of someone 
i hear nothing 
the silence be awful 
then i wonder if i have succeed in kill abaris 
if so -PRON- should be lie at -PRON- foot 
with an effort i wiggle a leg in an attempt to feel the floor near -PRON- 
perhaps abaris have crawl away or -PRON- man have remove -PRON- from the room i think 
then i remember the futility of try to kill a jovian feel no pain although the blood pound at -PRON- temple and i feel terribly weak and nauseate 
-PRON- left side seem numb deaden where abaris ray have strike 
presently as i lie in the darkness -PRON- ear catch a low moaning sound 
increase in volume the sound soon become a highpitched wail like that which -PRON- have hear when -PRON- behold the sphere whirl on the column in the center of the radium pool 
-PRON- ear drum pound under the force of the shriek and i place -PRON- hand over -PRON- to shut out the maddening sound 
suddenly the whole earth seem to tremble a rumble fill the room as though the world be in the tumultuous throe of some great upheaval 
with an ominous roar the floor under -PRON- shudder and crack 
i lie panicstricken thinking that a terrible earthquake have sweep over the valley of death 
crashing earthslide roar around -PRON- as i lay helpless 
overhead i could see a thin streak of light penetrate through a fissure that be slowly widen the chamber be become bright under the glare of light that enter -PRON- from the fissure 
i stand upon -PRON- foot and brace -PRON- to keep from fall under the swaying movement of the earth 
i look around quickly 
the chamber be entirely vacant 
not a sign remain of abaris -PRON- jovian allie or any of -PRON- -PRON- be go 
at -PRON- foot i notice a spread pool of green liquid 
i curse abaris and -PRON- hideous follower roundly 
presently as i stand stare down at the liquid that must have pour from the wound i have inflict upon abaris i hear a terrific roar come from somewhere near 
the floor of the chamber roll like the surface of an angry sea 
i be dash against the wall where i lie 
i expect momentarily to see the chamber close up and crush -PRON- to death seal -PRON- in a live tomb deep beneath the manalava plain 
there come a terrific thunderous crash the impact of which cause -PRON- to rise from the ground and fall again yard away 
with the crash come the blind flash of some terrible explosion 
a great hissing sound reach -PRON- ear and then i hear a loud earsplitte shriek 
i look overhead at the fissure in the earth through which filter the soulgladdene sun light 
i catch a glimpse of a great sphere travel at a terrific speed into the sky 
as -PRON- speed away the shriek of -PRON- passing become less discernible and soon die out altogether 
the jovian have depart for -PRON- own planet take allie lane -PRON- father and driftin sand with -PRON- gradually the earth roar cease and with -PRON- cease the earth heave stare around -PRON- now able to see the entire chamber 
not an object remain in -PRON- not a fragment of any of beautiful purple and gold drape that have decorate the room which have be allie the jovian have remove every object while i lie on the floor apparently dead 
abaris ray could not have strike -PRON- squarely or else -PRON- have be too feeble and weak as the result of -PRON- wound to do more than stun -PRON- temporarily 
in -PRON- rapid search of the room i discover that the upheaval cause by the departure of the great interplanetary traveler have seal the tunnel in which i have hide during the conflict between sand and abaris 
the tunnel through which abaris have suddenly appear be likewise close with massive rock 
as a last resort to escape from the underground world i begin to study the possibility of crawl to the surface of the manalava plain through the wide fissure overhead 
the opening be too high for -PRON- to reach up and obtain enough of a handhold to support -PRON- weight 
i spend hour work constantly pile some of the broken rock from the tunnel under the fissure 
eventually i succeed in grasp a sharp rock protrude from the side of the crevice and hoist -PRON- up 
-PRON- be hard that climb to the outer world 
presently after what seem hour of backbreake labor i reach the surface 
how good -PRON- be to breathe the pure air of death valley again the atmosphere in spite of the terrific heat of the manalava plain be sweet and beautiful 
-PRON- lung long since tax with the foul nauseate atmosphere of the tunnel and cavern deep below -PRON- pump madly as i breathe in the delightful air of -PRON- own world the manalava plain as far as i could see have strangely become ruffle and strew with broken rock 
wide fissure and crevice be visible at every hand and on several occasion as i pick -PRON- way off the plain i be force to leap over -PRON- or make wide detour in order to pass 
after terrible torture i eventually reach the spring in the little hidden canyon 
there i drink deeply of the water that have previously be pale green in color and be now strangely colorless 
i look around the weatherbroken wagon and search the old trunk that sand have find before -PRON- start to follow the phantom wagon with -PRON- two mysterious human but fail to find anything in which i could carry a supply of water 
after roll in the spring i strike off across the valley 
-PRON- be hell friend and i would have lie down many time to die but the ever present vision of -PRON- wife and youngster over at balch constantly beckon -PRON- to continue 
so here i be and i thank -PRON- gentleman for save -PRON- life i have doubt end the strange and most fascinating narrative that i have ever hear in -PRON- entire career as a newspaperman 
i sit breathless at the very fearlessness with which the man narrate -PRON- and i could not help but believe -PRON- 
-PRON- seem impossible for -PRON- to conjure in -PRON- imagination in so short a time such a weird story 
-PRON- could not have be do even by the most versatile teller of fabricated story 
long before -PRON- have finish -PRON- narrative night have fall and with -PRON- have come -PRON- myriad of brilliant star glow overhead 
so entrance be professor bloch and i as -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- fail to notice that the shroud of night be lift in the east as the sun cast -PRON- first vermilion ray into the darken heaven 
through the night the foreman have continue -PRON- tale uninterrupted and when -PRON- eventually finish mumble -PRON- thank to -PRON- the desert world have suddenly become brilliant with the everchange color of a desert dawn 
i stare intently into the glowing coal of the camp fire fascinate over the strange experience -PRON- have unfold to -PRON- 
-PRON- be hard very hard to believe that tale but somehow -PRON- rang true 
i shudder at the thought of the grotesque jovian and -PRON- uncanny power 
the professor remain silent lose in deep thought apparently mull over the story in -PRON- scientific way 
i glance at -PRON- quickly expect to see doubt write plainly on -PRON- feature 
instead -PRON- be more serious than i have ever behold -PRON- 
the foreman hang -PRON- head in a stupor of exhaustion 
dowell professor bloch suddenly call to -PRON- as i sit stare into the fire 
the abruptness of -PRON- voice cause -PRON- to jump nervously 
yes professor i answer very glad that the awesome silence which have settle over -PRON- after the foreman have finish -PRON- narrative have be break very much awake sir 
-PRON- friend say the professor seriously -PRON- have hear this gentleman weird story 
tell -PRON- plainly just how -PRON- have take -PRON- 
do not be afraid to express -PRON- 
well professor i say nervously 
-PRON- be difficult for a layman to accept such a story without basic fact yet i feel that certain portion of -PRON- be true 
take into consideration the fact that astronomer have just about prove that life exist on certain distant planet -PRON- be not difficult to believe -PRON- assertion that -PRON- development there could be much further advanced than -PRON- own in scientific achievement 
-PRON- seem quite natural that any form of life on jupiter would differ greatly from -PRON- own due to atmospheric condition and environment 
as for radium -PRON- seem quite possible that a great quantity of -PRON- would contain more quality than be find in the small amount of the metal that -PRON- have be able to obtain 
however in -PRON- opinion there seem to be but one factor in the narrative that have cause -PRON- to doubt a certain portion of -PRON- 
pause i cast a quick glance at the mineforeman 
-PRON- head still hang in the stupor of exhaustion 
-PRON- appear to be sleep soundly in a squatting position 
i look at professor bloch 
-PRON- be regard -PRON- thoughtfully chin rest on -PRON- suntanne fist 
then i continue -PRON- seem to -PRON- professor i say eye -PRON- that if the jovian be immortal and could not be kill as this gentleman have relate there couldbe no exist skeletal remain 
-PRON- say that dr jamesson have recover a huge skull 
this man claim -PRON- fit perfectly with the facial characteristic of the jovian 
under those condition -PRON- be hard to accept that part of the narrative due to the fact that this man say that the jovian can not be destroy and yet identify a skull as be in exact conformity with the cranial structure of the terrestrial being 
how could -PRON- be possible to recover the skeletal remain of any creature that be allegedly immortal and therefore immune to death 
-PRON- scientific observation and opinion -PRON- friend professor bloch say enthusiastically be great for a newspaperman 
i congratulate -PRON- 
-PRON- city editor tell -PRON- that -PRON- be the good hand on the outstander at scientific matter and i believe -PRON- 
however i have go over the narrative thoroughly and find in -PRON- the very same fault -PRON- have mention 
but i actually believe this man tell the truth the green tint which mark -PRON- skin be undoubtedly cause by radium 
i have see radium affliction several time and -PRON- power discolor the human skin permanently when -PRON- be expose to -PRON- ray for any length of time 
i agree with -PRON- when -PRON- say that radium in large quantity must have more quality than be know to exist in the small amount recover 
as for the huge skull which dr jamesson recover 
-PRON- be -PRON- opinion that the jovian be not entirely immortal that be when -PRON- be outside of -PRON- accustomed atmospheric condition 
-PRON- be easy to believe that -PRON- achieve immortality on -PRON- own planet for -PRON- today on this globe be slowly approach a period when longevity will be increase to an astonishing degree 
-PRON- be -PRON- prediction that -PRON- too will some day have achieve immortality to a certain degree inasmuch as radium be already know to have remove the cancerous tissue of the human anatomy that cause death 
however i have reason to believe that some of the jovian be destroy by the peculiar atmosphere of this earth when -PRON- arrive here 
naturally -PRON- could not be accustomed to -PRON- atmospheric condition and result be that only the fit survive the rigor of an alien planet 
-PRON- must consider that year must have be consume before -PRON- actually succeed in locate the underground source of the radium deposit 
those who be unable to keep up the strenuous pace weight down by the earth own atmosphere be quite naturally cast aside 
some of -PRON- could not survive 
hence the skeletal remain recover by dr jamesson 
but professor i argue seriously how could -PRON- survive the slug from this gentleman gun 
such a slug as shoot from -PRON- calibre of gun would kill an elephant instantly 
that -PRON- friend be one of -PRON- secret of immortality 
i do not know how -PRON- could survive 
i can merely hazard an opinion 
this man narrate that a peculiar green liquid pour from the wound 
i be convince then that a radium compound instead of blood course through -PRON- vein with power enough to heal even the most gaping wound instantly 
radium flow through -PRON- anatomy would have the power to banish the leaden slug even as -PRON- enter 
the lead like other less metal would vanish into invisible atom under the embrace of radium and would therefore have no more effect upon the jovian than would pulverize dust 
but great heat alien atmospheric condition or some tremendous violence would actually destroy a jovian if -PRON- be not of the most hardy sort 
i feel certain of that -PRON- friend 
the professor make a promise remain all that day at the camp by the mesquite spring 
after a hurried breakfast -PRON- lie down and sleep until late afternoon 
the heat be terrific and -PRON- beat down upon -PRON- with deaden effect 
i sleep through -PRON- dream terrible dream 
eventually i be awaken by professor bloch who have already prepare a light lunch 
the mineforeman be hold a pan of sizzle bacon over a tiny fire while the professor set other victual on the tail of the buckboard 
i rub -PRON- eye sleepily and tilt -PRON- hat forward to keep the burn sun from sear -PRON- face 
-PRON- almost leave -PRON- dowell 
professor bloch laughte good naturedly 
-PRON- be sleep so sound and dream so pleasantly that i hate to disturb -PRON- but -PRON- friend here think -PRON- best to take -PRON- along just as soon die from the heat there i guess as melt completely here eat i want to get back to los angele 
the city editor be reserve a room for -PRON- in the icehouse 
very well be start now 
immediately after lunch -PRON- start across the valley toward the mysterious red streak of tableland that mark the manalava plain 
for hour -PRON- ride in the bouncing buckboard for hour -PRON- seem -PRON- walk along side of -PRON- to relieve the laboring animal 
the sun beat down with terrific intensity and the heat wave dance blindingly from the sand 
eventually -PRON- find -PRON- necessary to continue on foot leave the burro and the buckboard in a little partly shelter arroyo 
about noon -PRON- arrive at what the foreman claim to be the spot where -PRON- and sand have locate the radium pool 
the surface of the manalava plain be a jumble of broken rock and a maze of wide crevice 
-PRON- stare at a deep craterlike depression before -PRON- but -PRON- be void of anything in the form of liquid 
nothing but boulder lie in -PRON- basin and the side have crumble in steep loose rockslide 
for what seem age -PRON- search around the surface for some opening that may lead -PRON- down into the deserted tunnel and chamber of the jovian 
none could be find 
evidence of some great recent upheaval be everywhere and search as -PRON- do -PRON- could locate no avenue by which -PRON- may enter the strange underground world 
presently professor bloch decide that the underground domain have be destroy completely by the upheaval cause no doubt by the tremendous force of the radium in propel the spacetraveler from this earth 
disconsolately -PRON- trail back to the buckboard 
when -PRON- eventually return to los angele professor bloch refuse to make a public statement regard the foreman strange experience and i be henceforth unable to submit the narrative for publication in the outstander 
i do however write an account of dr discovery of the peculiar skull and hint indirectly at -PRON- remote connection with the chain of evolution on this globe and the possibility of this world be invade at some future period by martian jovian or venerian but the outstander publish only a few garbled paragraph that be unintelligible and valueless 
and for many month i have secretly withhold the narrative until at last i have muster courage enough to submit -PRON- for publication to a scientific journal 
reader of science wonder story usually can tell fact from fiction 
-PRON- know well that many unheard of tale come from the vast jungle of desert waste and invariably -PRON- be true one thing professor bloch do say be that if money and inventive skill could be obtain an attempt may be make to go to jupiter to rescue the unfortunate trio 
if such a thing be to happen i will be one of the crew 
the end the problem of space fly by translate from the german by francis curri by gem back publication inc be quite certain that captain noordung precede article on space flying have prove revolutionary 
if the letter from -PRON- reader be an indication of what the rest of the scientific world think of these article -PRON- feel sure that -PRON- will prove prophetic in the year to come in this conclude installment captain noordung propose some further revolutionary thought the most outstanding of which probably be -PRON- giant float mirror perhaps the most frightful weapon ever conceive by man 
and -PRON- should be note that as in -PRON- precede article the final installment be base upon pure scientific reasoning and there be nothing contain in any of the article that will not come into actuality sooner or later 
as a matter of fact all of the instrumentality so vividly depict by this gifted and note german engineer could be construct today if a sufficient amount of money be forthcome 
continue the investigation of the star observation from the spatial station open the most splendid prospect for asstronomy 
in this case also there be the possibility of use telescope of any desire size beside the advantage of have the radiation of the star reach -PRON- unchanged 
the blackness of the sky would also help by -PRON- contrast the observation of the radiation of star 
fig show how -PRON- be possible by use of a simple concave mirror to converge the sun ray on an object and so ignite -PRON- 
this latter circumstance would permit all those observation of the sun which from the earth be possible only at total eclipse by simple exclusion of the sun disk through a round black shield 
-PRON- entire solar system with all -PRON- planet asteroid comet big and little moon etc could be investigate in the minutest detail 
even venus and mercury the two inferior planet that be near to the sun than the earth could be observe just as well as the superior planet those farther away than the earth 
from the earth as -PRON- have remark this be not possible because of the phe361 nomenon of twilight 
the surface of all the neighboring heavenly body the moon venus mar and mercury could be closely examine so far as -PRON- be visible to -PRON- and could also be map by telephotography 
even the question of the habitation of the planet may probably be definitely decide 
the most interesting discovery however would doubtless occur in the realm of the fix star 
many an unsolved problem of these extremely distant body would be explain 
-PRON- knowledge of cosmic event would be increase so far that -PRON- could with absolute certainty decide about the past and also the future fate of -PRON- own solar system and the earth 
all these research would have besides -PRON- other significance the great importance for the further development of spatial navigation 
once -PRON- know exactly the condition in those realm of space on the heavenly body a flight into space would no longer be a trip into the unknown for much of -PRON- peril would be lose 
a giant float mirror the possibility of an observatory in space be not yet exhaust 
from the fact that the sun shine not only in infinite power but also uninterruptedly aside from short chance passage through the shadow of the earth use may be make also for many technical use on earth 
from the spatial station -PRON- the sun ray even on the great scale could be artificially direct upon various region on the surface of the earth by properly construct giant float mirror circle about the earth in free orbit and thus float above -PRON- as propose by oberth 
accord to -PRON- suggestion -PRON- should consist of separate facet which be so arranged in movable fashion that from one point by mean of electrical influence -PRON- can be give any desire po362 sition with regard to the level of the entire mirror 
by proper adjustment of the facet -PRON- would then be possible to spread the entire solar energy reflect from the mirror accord to need over wide expanse of the earth surface to concentrate -PRON- on individual point or finally when -PRON- be not need to let -PRON- radiate into space 
fig 
how the giant mirror in space propose by the author may be use to give perenniai daylight tol the earth 
the mirror be on the side of the earth that ia turn away from the sun 
the sun ray strike -PRON- and be reflect to the earth or any part of -PRON- where the concentration of the ray produce the equivalent of the direct light and heat of the sun 
the fact that such spatial mirror would be weightless because of -PRON- motion in orbit would materially simplify -PRON- manufacture 
accord to oberth a circular wire network be to serve as a frame be spread out in space for this purpose by rotation 
in -PRON- mesh the separate facet would be place consist of sheet sodium as thin as paper 
accord to -PRON- estimate such a mirror with a diameter of kilometer would cost about and would require about fifteen year to construct 
besides this there would probably be other possibility of build such a giant float mirror 
with small diameter of only a few hundred meter -PRON- would be possible to give the entire mirror so rigid a construction that -PRON- could be turn in -PRON- entirety about -PRON- center of gravity by mean of rotary motor and could be give any desire change of position 
the electrical energy need for guide such mirror would be amply available in the spatial observatory 
the guide apparatus -PRON- would have to be in the observatory proper so arranged that -PRON- could be use during simultaneous observation through the giant telescope so that -PRON- would be possible to direct most exactly the illumination of the mijror on earth 
the use of this equipment would be manifold 
important harbor or airport great railroad station even entire city could be illuminate at night cloud condition permit by natural sunlight 
how much coal could be save if for example berlin and the other great city be illuminate in this manner 
the most frightful of weapon mirror like every technical achievement could also be use for the purpose of warfare and what be more -PRON- would provide a weapon far surpass in frightfulness everything thus far use 
-PRON- be common knowledge that very considerable temperature can be produce by concentrate the sun ray with a concave mirror such as with the aid of a burn glass 
even if the mirror be no large than a hand -PRON- be possible to kindle directly piece of paper even such thing as shaving of wood etc which be hold at -PRON- focus 
if -PRON- now assume that the diameter of such a mirror be not merely ten centimeter but several hundred or even thousand meter as would be the case with a mirror in space then steel would melt and even incombustible material could hardly resist permanently if sunlight so tremendously concentrated strike -PRON- 
and assume that the observer in space with the aid of -PRON- mighty telescope see spread out before -PRON- the entire field of battle with the country behind the line of the enemy with all -PRON- route of approach by land and sea all this like a gigantic map show even the small detail 
then -PRON- can form an idea of what such a spatial mirror guide by -PRON- hand would mean as a weapon fig show the sun and the orbit of the sun planet 
this indicate the relative distance of the various planet from the sun 
the four minor planet 
earth mar venus and mercury be only a fraction of the distance that the four major planet be from the sun 
by use -PRON- there would be no difficulty in blow up the munition dump of the enemy set fire to the depot of -PRON- supply and melt -PRON- cannon armored turret iron bridge the rail of important railway etc move train factory important for war even entire industrial establishment and great city could be burn 
troop on the march or in camp would simply be carbonize if the bundle of ray of this concentrated sunlight be pass over -PRON- 
and the ship of the enemy no matter how powerful -PRON- be or how strongly fortify the harbor in which -PRON- seek refuge could not possibly be protect from -PRON- 
-PRON- would be destroy burn out as -PRON- eliminate vermin from -PRON- hiding place with the blast flame 
these would be actually the ray of death 
yet -PRON- be no other than the lifegiving one which -PRON- daily desire from the sun 
in this case however -PRON- would have a little too much of a good thing 
yet matter would scarcely come to all these horror 
no power would ever venture to begin a war with a nation have control over such frightful weapon 
to distant heavenly body i -PRON- previous consideration -PRON- have not deal with travel beyond the realm where the attraction of the earth be paramount 
how be matter with regard to the real purpose of the journey in space the complete separation from the earth and the reaching of distant heavenly body 
first let -PRON- briefly view the stellar universe as -PRON- will be view from the standpoint of spatial navigation i e as future realm to travel 
-PRON- must therefore change and enlarge -PRON- mental outlook 
for if -PRON- wish to regard the entire cosmos as -PRON- world then what have hitherto seem to -PRON- to be -PRON- world the earth will be -PRON- home in the narrow sense 
not the earth alone 
all else that be bind to -PRON- by -PRON- gravity such as the future station in space and even the moon must also be reckon as part of -PRON- narrow home in the universe as belong to the realm of the earth 
after all how small the distance from the earth to the moon be some kilometer compare with the other distance in space -PRON- be only a hundredth of the distance of -PRON- near planet venus and mar 
and the sphere that would be make by the moon orbit around the earth could easily find room inside the sun 
the first unit in space to consider beyond -PRON- earth be the solar system with all the various planet belong to -PRON- 
there be eight principal planet of which -PRON- earth be one together with numerous other heavenly body 
most of the latter the asteroid periodic comet meteor etc be of small size 
of the planet mercury be nearest the sun then follow venus the earth 
mar jupiter saturn uranus and finally neptune 
accordingly venus and mar along with the moon be the direct neighbor of the earth 
all these heavenly body be permanently bind to the sun by the power of mass attraction and compel constantly to revolve about -PRON- as a centre in elliptical path 
-PRON- form the realm of the fix star the sun 
illuminate and warm by the splendor of -PRON- ray and also control by the steadfast might of -PRON- gravitational pull -PRON- be join in eternal union an island in the emptiness and darkness of space 
such be -PRON- great home in the universe the solar system 
this be a realm indeed of tremendous size even light though -PRON- hurry through space at the speed of kilometer a second take more than eight hour to cross -PRON- directly 
yet how tiny be this world as compare with the incomprehensible extent of the universe from which many heavenly body the fix star heat even to a gaseous state send -PRON- the greeting of -PRON- shine ray 
even the near of -PRON- alpha centauri be lightyear away that be about time as far as the diameter of the whole solar system 
all the other however be much farther from -PRON- most of -PRON- hundred and thousand of lightyear 
and if there be already extinguish fix star nearer -PRON- in the eternal darkness of empty space -PRON- could never see -PRON- 
from this -PRON- be already apparent that as for travel to distant heavenly body -PRON- can now take into account only those belong to the solar system 
the technique of travel manner in which distant travel through space would have to take place would in general be in free orbit about those heavenly body in whose paramount field of attraction the trip take place 
within the realm of the sun fig show the sun and the orbit of the four minor planeft 
mercury venus earth and mar 
this indicate also the relative distance of the orbit from each other fore -PRON- must move around the latter always in some sort of free orbit if -PRON- be not to become subject to -PRON- gravity and plunge into -PRON- sea of fire 
certainly -PRON- need not pay special heed to this point as long as -PRON- remain in the narrow realm of the earth or of some other world in the solar system 
for each of thdse revolve about the sun in -PRON- own free orbit so to speak and with -PRON- at the same time and because of -PRON- all the body belong to -PRON- 
with the earth whose speed be meter a second there also revolve the moon at present and there would revolve -PRON- future station in space the moon and the station be both satellite of the earth 
all of these body go around the sun -PRON- attraction thereby lose -PRON- direct effectiveness on -PRON- 
this be call the stable condition of float as regard the sun 
only when the space ship pass out of the narrow region of attraction of one of the heavenly body revolve around the sun would -PRON- have to travel around the sun in a free orbit of -PRON- own 
for example if -PRON- be a question of a trip from the earth to a distant planet then on the basis of what have be say not only the course of this independent path but also the time of departure from the earth must be so choose that the space ship arrive at a point in the orbit of the planet to be visit at approxinuitely the same time as the point be pass by the planet -PRON- 
hfc 
show the effect on a body rotate about the aun of a change in -PRON- velocity 
if the speed of the body such as the earth ia accelerate -PRON- will withdraw from the sun to a new orbit 
if the speed be retard -PRON- will approach to form a new orbit 
if the ship be thus bring into the region of attraction by the planet to be visit then the possibility be open of either circle -PRON- in a free orbit as a satellite as often as desire or descend on -PRON- 
in case the planet have a blanket of air like that of the earth the landing can be by a method already consider for land on the earth land manoeuver by use of decrease ellipsis 
if a blanket of air such as the earth possess be miss then the landing can be effect only by recoilbrake make the force that operate the ship work in the opposite direction to the direction of fall during the descent 
in order to journey within the solar system to another heavenly body after successfully get free from one -PRON- would be necessary to change the orbital motion which -PRON- would have previously acquire around the sun along with the original planet by the assistance of the propel force 
thereby -PRON- would enter an independent orbit about the sun this serve as an intermediary orbit to join the orbit of -PRON- own planet with that of the other 
accord to the law of celestial mechanic for this purpose the original orbital motion must be alter accord to the location of the goal that be -PRON- must be accelerate if the ship be to go away from the sun and retard if -PRON- be to approach the sun 
finally as soon as the desire heavenly body be reach the independent motion of the connect orbital path must be change to that which the ship must take in relation to the new planet in order to carry out the manoeuver of circle about -PRON- or of landing 
the return trip would have to take place in the same way 
-PRON- be accordingly clear that in the course of such a distant trip through planetary space repeat change in the condition of motion be necessary 
these must each time be effect by propulsion with artificial power and therefore require the expenditure of fuel 
this expenditure accord to calculation be least when the orbit of the original planet and that to be visit be not cut by the connect orbital path of the ship but be merely touch by -PRON- in any event the necessary amount of fuel be considerable 
still great amount must be add if the planet to be visit be not to be circle about but actually land upon directly 
the amount of fuel need in fact increase with the mass of the planet and accordingly with -PRON- power of attraction 
this be understand when -PRON- be consider that ascend again from -PRON- in start the return trip require a very considerable expenditure of energy as be already know from such an ascent from the earth 
if furthermore the braking on landing must be do by mean of the propulsion recoil brake in the absence of a suitable atmosphere then there result a further tremendous increase in the necessary fuel 
moreover this fuel must all be take along on the trip from the earth at least on the first visit to a remote planet for -PRON- could not count beforehand on be able to secure there the fuel need for the return trip 
the start from the surface of the earth commence such a trip directly from the surface of the earth and to overcome -PRON- gravity -PRON- would be necessary to also lift this whole supply of fuel 
accord to previous remark this of -PRON- demand a most extraordinary expenditure of work 
in the case at hand at least with the efficiency of fuel now available the amount necessary to be take along would accordingly make up so great a part of the total weight of the ship that -PRON- construction would be hardly possible 
the only visit to a heavenly body which could be undertake directly from the earth surface by mean of fuel know now would be the circumnavigation of the moon for the purpose of a close observation of the nature of -PRON- surface especially on the side of -PRON- always turn away from the earth 
in the course of this -PRON- could be imprison by the moon to circle about -PRON- as often as desire in a in other word if the ship move tangentially to the orbit of the planet -PRON- leave and take a path that bring -PRON- tangent to the orbit of the new planet the energy require would be a minimum 
editor free orbit like a satellite of the moon 
the amount of fuel need for this undertaking would not be much great than for a normal ascent from the earth to the practical limit of gravity 
the spatial station as a basis for spatial travel condition would be considerably more favorable however if as oberth propose a fuel depot be construct float at a proper height above the earth and constantly circle about -PRON- in a free orbit to serve as a starting point for the trip instead of the earth 
in this case only a slight expenditure of work would be need to be entirely free from the earth and the ship would accordingly not need to be load with the fuel neccessary for the ascent from the earth 
only a little more would need to be take along than would be require for the distant trip -PRON- 
since the depot as a result of -PRON- free orbital motion would be weightless the fuel could simply be place there in any amount freely float at any point in space 
if protect against the ray of the sun even oxygen and hydrogen could be keep indefinitely in a solid state 
the supplying of -PRON- would have to be manage by a constant travelling of space ship back and forth 
this may be from the earth or from the moon 
in the former case the fuel at least so far as -PRON- consist of liquefy oxygen and hydrogen could be produce in great power plant operate by the heat of the tropical ocean 
the moon would be an especially advantageous base as max valier suggest 
there the mass and accordingly the force of attraction be much small than those of the earth which would greatly lessen the expenditure of work need for the ascent and therefore for the carrying of fuel from -PRON- 
certainly this presuppose that the necessary raw material be actually present on the moon that be that there be at least water even in the form of ice 
the latter would be electrolytically decompose into oxygen and hydrogen the require energy be provide by solar power plant 
unfortunately the probability of this be not too great 
if -PRON- should be the case however -PRON- could use the moon also as hohmann suggest for the starting point of spatial travel and accordingly make the fuel depot on -PRON- 
in spite of the many advantage of this plan proposal of a freely float depot seem more favorable because from -PRON- the complete release from the field of attraction of the terrestrial region include the moon would demand a considerably small expenditure of energy 
indeed from the standpoint of economy and energy -PRON- would be doubtless most advantageous to establish the depot one or several million kilometer from the earth especially if the fuel have to be transport to -PRON- from the earth 
-PRON- shall nevertheless transfer -PRON- to -PRON- station in space make the latter thereby the base for the travelling because -PRON- be already supply with all the equipment necessary 
an especially important part of the equipment would be the giant telescope 
thank to -PRON- almost unlimited efficiency -PRON- would make -PRON- possible first to examine minutely from a distance the region to be travel in the stellar world 
furthermore the space ship could be keep under constant observation during a large part of the trip and frequently during the whole of -PRON- 
by mean of light signal show by the ship at appoint time there could be a communication at least on one side 
thus the spatial station aside from the many duty already mention would be able not only to initiate real travel about the universe but also to serve as an operating base for all spatial journey 
the accessibility of the neighboring planet have thoroughly investigate the problem of visit other heavenly body 
accord to -PRON- result express in terrestrial chronology the trip from the earth to venus would last day and that to mar a round trip include circumnavigation of both venus and mar at the relatively slight distance of about eight million kilometer could be perform in about a year and a half 
for visit venus and land upon -PRON- include a stay of month together with the trip there and back not quite year would be require 
let -PRON- assume that the journey be to commence accord to -PRON- previous observation from the spatial station so that final release from the field of gravity of the earth would require only a little energy 
the return take place directly to the surface of the earth so that no energy at all nee be use for this 
one can descend merely with brake by air resistance 
let the weight to be transport be two person together with the provision need for the entire trip and all the apparatus require for observation and other purpose 
hohmann calculate that the space explore ship ready to start provide with all the fuel necessary for the trip both way must weigh approximately as follow for the previously mention round trip include circumnavigation not land of venus and mar ton per cent of this be fuel for the first landing on the moon ton on venus ton on mar ton 
in the first of these three case per cent in the other two about percent of the entire weight of the ship would have to be fuel 
the expulsion speed of meter a second from the earth be assume 
-PRON- be clear that the construction of a ship to carry rocket propulsion fuel make up per cent of -PRON- entire weight would present such considerable technical difficulty that -PRON- manufacture could hardly succeed at present 
accordingly only the moon of all the large heavenly body next to -PRON- could at present be in question for a visit include a landing 
however -PRON- could at good approach verynear the planet and circumnavigate -PRON- without however land on -PRON- 
still -PRON- have hope that in the course of time by the aid of the principle of sectional construction -PRON- may finally succeed even with the technical mean know today in construct space rocket which can even execute landing on the neighboring planet 
fig show two way that a body can travel from one planet to another 
the first way show on the left which be the easy the body leave the planet on a tangent to -PRON- orbital path and travel sqi that -PRON- approach the orbit of the next planet on a tangent to -PRON- path 
the small amount of power be require for this 
by the second method show on the right the body be force to cross the orbit of one planet to get to the other 
this would be necessary if the calculation as to the path to take in space have be badly do 
this method take a great amount of power than the first for the body be force to travel further away from the sun and therefore overcome for a great distance the sun gravitational pull 
doubtless this exhaust all the possibility which seem to be offer to spatial navigation in the present state of science 
for the difficulty would be far great which confront a visit to more distant planet of the solar system 
-PRON- be not merely that the route to be travel be far long than those hitherto consider 
since all these planet be at greatly different distance from the sun than the earth in reach -PRON- the field of gravity of the sun play a considerable part 
this attraction would have to be overcome by energy 
if for example -PRON- travel away from the sun i e ascend from -PRON- -PRON- must overcome -PRON- pull exactly in the same manner as when -PRON- travel away from the earth 
this be show in the previously mention change in orbital speed about the sun necessary in distant travel through planetary space 
but if -PRON- wish to descend on one of these planet tremendous amount of fuel would prove necessary especially in the case of jupiter and saturn 
these in consequence of -PRON- enormous masse possess very powerful field of gravity 
as for reach the fix star -PRON- extreme remoteness alone make -PRON- impossible of consideration 
distant world do not affirm that -PRON- must for all time remain confine only to the region of the earth and the neighboring planet 
if -PRON- succeed in increase the repulsion speed in recoil action beyond the amount of or perhaps meter a second thus far reckon the high practically attainable or if -PRON- find a possibility of store very great amount of energy in a small space then the situation would be entirely different 
and why should not the chemist of the future develop a propelling material far surpass in effect those already know -PRON- be even conceivable that in time -PRON- shall succeed in make technically serviceable and in use to propel space ship those tremendous amount of energy confine in matter energy whose existence -PRON- already know 
perhaps -PRON- shall also find a method of use for this purpose the electrical phenomenon of cathode radiation or by some other way to attain a tremendous increase in repulsion speed through electrical influence 
there may lastly come into question a suitable use of the sun radiation or of radium decomposition etc 
certainly natural possibility for future investigator and inventor be still plentifully available in this respect 
if success should result then -PRON- could visit and actually set foot on many of those faroff world which as yet -PRON- only view at immeasurable distance in the starry heaven 
an ancient dream of mankind 
would -PRON- fulfillment be of any use to -PRON- 
certainly science would make extraordinary gain 
no certain judgment be possible today regard the practical value 
how little -PRON- know of even -PRON- near neighbor among the heavenly body the moon still a part of the region of the earth -PRON- narrow home in the universe be of all the distant heavenly body the one best know to -PRON- 
-PRON- be cold have no covering of air and be without any high form of life 
-PRON- be a gigantic mass of rock float in space fissure inhospitable rigid in death a world of the past 
but -PRON- have considerably less knowledge regard the body next best know to the moon -PRON- neighboring planet mar 
but in comparison with -PRON- knowledge of other planet -PRON- knowledge of mar be considerable 
mar too be an aged world though not nearly so old as the moon 
-PRON- mass and therefore -PRON- force of attraction be both much less than those of the earth 
-PRON- have indeed a covering of air yet of far less density than that of the earth 
on -PRON- surface the air pressure be certainly considerably low than even on -PRON- high mountain top 
apparently -PRON- possess water 
a fairly large part of this may be freeze -PRON- mean temperature seem to be much below that of the earth even if in place as on the martian equatorial belt comparatively high temperature have be determine 
because of the thinness of the atmosphere the difference in temperature in the day and at night be very great 
the strange and most discuss of all martian observation in the phenomenon of the socalle martian canal 
even though recently -PRON- be often regard as merely optical illusion -PRON- really know nothing about -PRON- 
at any rate what -PRON- already know about mar do not offer -PRON- enough clue to be able to form a final judgment as to whether this planet be inhabit by intelligent creature or by any creature at all 
-PRON- would hardly be habitable for person from the earth chiefly because of the rarity of -PRON- atmosphere 
therefore -PRON- would offer spatial navigation an extremely interesting object of investigation from the scientific standpoint 
but whether land there would have practical value as well can not be recognize today with certainty 
-PRON- hardly appear likely however 
-PRON- be another matter with -PRON- second neighboring planet venus a splendid shine heavenly body know to -PRON- as morning star and evening star -PRON- size -PRON- mass and therefore the force of gravity prevail on -PRON- surface be only slightly less than those of the earth 
-PRON- also have a covering of air doubtless very similar to -PRON- though somewhat deep and denser 
unfortunately venus be hard to observe from the earth because -PRON- always appear near the sun and therefore be only visible at twilight 
accordingly -PRON- be still entirely uncertain about -PRON- rotation on -PRON- axis 
if -PRON- period be approximately that of the earth about twentyfour hour as be widely assume then venus and the earth would have a mark resemblance 
-PRON- be therefore with this planet that -PRON- may mo6 t reasonably count on find condition of life similar to those on earth even if the suspicion that -PRON- be always cover with cloud should prove correct 
even on the earth there be a highly develop life of plant and animal at a time when part of the water now fill the ocean be still in the form of vapor 
certainly of all the heavenly body know to -PRON- venus offer the great likelihood of be suit to occupation and thereby of come into question as a future goal of travel 
since -PRON- be also the near of all the planet -PRON- may well be the most enticing object for spatial navigation 
mercury be still near the sun offer even less favorable condition of observation than venus 
-PRON- be the small of all the planet have a covering of air which be probably only extremely thin and a surface apparently similar to that of the moon 
for these reason and especially because of -PRON- closeness to the sun the solar radiation be about nine time as strong as on earth extremely unfavorable temperature condition must prevail there 
mercury would accordingly be hardly at all invite as a place to visit 
although in consider the previously mention planet -PRON- be possible to arrive at a fairly probable result what -PRON- so far know be insufficient for the purpose in the case of those more distant jupiter saturn uranus and neptune 
-PRON- have indeed be able to determine that -PRON- all have dense covering of air 
the question of the nature of the surface of these planet be however still entirely uncertain 
with jupiter and saturn this be because -PRON- be so densely envelop by condensation product cloud of some sort or other that -PRON- apparently do not see -PRON- real surface at all 
in the case of uranus and neptune -PRON- be because -PRON- extreme remoteness prevent more exact observation 
concern -PRON- value as goal for space travel -PRON- be difficult to say anything 
yet merely the circumstance that -PRON- have determine in the case of these planet a relatively low average density from to of that of the earth lead to the conclusion that a very different physical condition must exist from that of the earth 
this alone must greatly lessen -PRON- expectation of a visit 
still -PRON- would perhaps be possible that some of the satellite of these planet more especially those of jupiter would offer comparatively more favorable prospect 
one thing be absolutely certain the mass and consequent force of the field of gravity of each of these planet be tremendously great than those of the earth would make visit -PRON- exacceleraton c 
fig 
a speed curve show the method of acceleration and deceleration in go from point a to b 
the body be uniformly accelerate from rest until -PRON- reach maximum speed halfway between a and b then -PRON- be uniformly decelerate until -PRON- come to rest at b traordinarily difficult especially in the case of jupiter and saturn 
regard finally the various other body belong to the solar system -PRON- be reasonably certain today that -PRON- could hardly derive any special practical benefit from visit to -PRON- 
-PRON- see therefore that -PRON- may not be too optimistic about the advantage to be expect of other member of the solar system 
but thus far -PRON- certainly know far too little not to let -PRON- thought have a free rein in these respect 
-PRON- may well be that all these world will prove to be entirely worthless to -PRON- 
on the other hand perhaps -PRON- would find on many of -PRON- a fertile soil plant and animal possibly of a sort entirely odd and strange to -PRON- 
-PRON- may even be of gigantic size like those once exist on the earth 
indeed -PRON- be not incredible that -PRON- may find even human being or similar creature maybe even possess civilization very different or even old than those of -PRON- ative planet 
-PRON- be even highly probable that life on distant planet in case -PRON- exist there be on another level than that of the earth 
then -PRON- could experience the marvel of view condition from the evolution of -PRON- earthly existence condition of the present time real and live yet picture of a past or future countless million of year away 
or -PRON- may be that -PRON- would find valuable substance which be very rare on earth such for example as radium occur in an easily obtainable form 
if the condition of life discover there be the suitable for permanent occupancy perhaps then incredible as -PRON- may sound today distant planet would in the course of time come into question for emigration and colonization 
as -PRON- have remark before there be little likelihood that there be such suitable planet among those of -PRON- solar system with the single exception of the planet venus 
end 
the onslaught from venus continue from page the second line dive below -PRON- and the third drove head on into the enemy air formation 
-PRON- seem as if the entire atmosphere of the world blaze and flame for a split second 
the three front line somewhat shatter readjust -PRON- to normal formation 
and -PRON- own line be drive through acrid smoke as below -PRON- fall away the grotesquely twisted fragment and wreckage of umbrella ship and plane 
i take -PRON- hand off -PRON- gun 
there be nothing to shoot at 
there be no umbrella ship leave 
and a few second later -PRON- great sheet of plane sweep down low in an undulating dive and drive along strafe the struggling and disordered formation of the enemy 
-PRON- be kaleidescopic 
-PRON- speed be terrific 
twenty thousand heavy calibre machine gun spat forth an instantaneous blanket of flame death that pin down the invader by untold thousand 
here and there fanray machine raise flutter futile pale canopy of wouldbe protection 
but -PRON- shell be not of metal now 
great lumber masse of machinery heave and plunge along on -PRON- queer leverlike leg only to tumble ponderously into great shell hole or suddenly shiver and tremble like live thing then settle down with a weakly wave metal leg or two and die 
as suddenly as i be plunge into -PRON- all i find -PRON- out of -PRON- 
subconsciously follow the line ahead i have zoom and loop -PRON- way into the comparative peace of a high level 
automatically -PRON- brain register the signal click in -PRON- ear phone and i find -PRON- streak for a new rendezvous preparatory to a second attack 
but -PRON- never deliver that attack 
-PRON- be call off 
the enemy mob which no longer could be designate as an army be plunge frantically against -PRON- new ground position and for mile along that line unyielde regiment of infantry stand off the horde of an alien planet 
the end see little of what follow 
to -PRON- there be vague hazy scatter movement of large and small detachment of troop and the interminable ripping and rumbling of barrage 
little more be visible from -PRON- height 
but there be no need for -PRON- to tell how the high command find that -PRON- line actually have check the the demoniac fury of the venus lunge and know -PRON- entire army be in disorder throw all available reserve into the fight even go to the extent of arm the girl regiment in the auxiliary service and hurl -PRON- into the welter how the division of earth surge forward shoot hack and thrust -PRON- way irresistibly through the invader until to the last man and woman -PRON- be beat and hunt down to that death which -PRON- prefer to surrender 
for there already exist a voluminous history of that particular phase of the struggle 
i have often wonder at what place and time during this great struggle the venus girl nyimeurnior meet -PRON- end and the old miorurlia who learn english from -PRON- 
and i have often wonder too at that peculiar lack of sympathy with which -PRON- memory and -PRON- speculation as to -PRON- possible fate be tinge for i be not by nature an unsympathetic man 
there seem to be no other explanation for -PRON- that i can find than a fundamental planetary antagonism 
these people of venus be intelligent being much like -PRON- of earth in appearance and in many physical respect 
yet i could not feel for -PRON- the friendliness that i would feel for a dog cat yes even for a familiar insect of this earth 
i be convince that the civilized nation would have extend -PRON- aid and mercy as a matter of principle even after -PRON- have experience this peculiar repulsion upon actual contact with -PRON- 
-PRON- would have be give a section of the world -PRON- could occupy in peace and relative comfort the almost uninhabited jungle in which -PRON- try to establish -PRON- for instance have -PRON- not blindly insist on precipitate a struggle that could end only with -PRON- extermination 
but perhaps there be some little understood law of the universe that be only prove -PRON- in this case 
these people of venus do not belong on earth 
and though -PRON- show superability and superpower in cross the barrier of space and in maintain -PRON- in the midst of condition physically adverse though -PRON- unquestionably have the intelligence to cooperate with earth man well let -PRON- suggest -PRON- this way perhaps have have the effrontery to transgress successfully some fundamental propriety of the universe -PRON- be ordain that -PRON- should destroy -PRON- in that accomplishment 
but -PRON- vast labor and ultimate desperate terror be in vain 
-PRON- may have better meet -PRON- end on venus die without struggle or without vain hope

page a treat for science fiction reader i -PRON- be a reader of this magazine -PRON- naturally presume -PRON- to be a science fiction fan and if this presumption be correct -PRON- know that like most fan -PRON- can not possibly get enough of good science fiction literature 
many science fiction reader have continuously urge -PRON- to get out science wonder story twice a month or oftener 
in order to accede to -PRON- wish -PRON- now publish a sister magazine to science wonder story under the name of air wonder story 
do not jump to the conclusion that air wonder story be purely an aeronautical magazine -PRON- be nothing of the sort 
-PRON- be a science fiction magazine just as truly as be science wonder story contain just as many kind of science 
while -PRON- be true that in air wonder story -PRON- publish which will be publish in the september issue 
here be one of the great science fiction story of the year 
mr olsen with -PRON- shrewd foresight have give -PRON- a tremendous amount of new science of all kind and endless possibility which be sure to come about during the next hundred year 
table of content by harl vincent author of the menace from below by lowell howard morrow author of island in the air by victor ie with an aviation background yet all of the story be first science fiction and aviation second 
practically all of the author and many new one -PRON- have discover who contribute to science wonder story be now also contributor to air wonder story 
and whether -PRON- be airminde or not -PRON- do -PRON- an injustice if -PRON- do not read air wonder story 
some of the foremost science fiction story be find in this new magazine 
do not miss the september issue of air wonder story -PRON- be so chockfull of excellent story 
-PRON- probably know bob olsen the creator of the fourth dimension story 
-PRON- have write a rattle good scientific story entitle by robert leitfre technical department for those interested in aeronautics letter from reader please turn to page of this issue 
a move picture film of a dawn on the moon be take recently at the princeton university observatory and exhibit 
the mechanism for take the picture be perfect by fleme arnott of upper montclair the picture be take at the rate of one every six second whereas the usual rate be about to one second 
by mean of a 23inch telescope the moon be see as -PRON- appear mile away 
at a rate the sunlight be see creep across the lunar landscape the darkness be break abruptly by the strong glare of the sun 
there be no intervene rosy haze as on earth neither be there a twilight after the sun have disappear 
the discovery of nebulae of star mention in these column find to be travel away from the earth at the tremendous velocity of to mile per second be proof of the einstein theory of relativity accord to opinion of famous astronomer in the new york time the high velocity -PRON- be suggest be really illusion create by the crumpling of space accord to the relativity theory 
light wave travel through enormous distance of space be distort 
further the idea that space be curve be verify by the datum take on these fastmove stellar universe 
dr clyde fisher curator of the american museum of natural history say that the validity of the einstein theory be now generally accept by most scientist and that the new discoverie about the star may lead to proof that cosmic space long hold to be illimitable have definite limit and that light instead of travel on indefinitely be hedge by this close universe 
dr harlow staple of the harvard observatory say that accord to the einstein theory very distant object would show a spurious velocity of recession 
by the use of a tiny thermocouple two astronomer at mt wilson observatory have be able to make measurement of the moon temperature before and after an eclipse say popular science 
the instrument be so small -PRON- be say that if a thousand of -PRON- be place in a balance -PRON- would only need a drop of water to equal -PRON- weight 
dr paul epstein of the california institute of technology have determine from the experiment that the frozen surface of the moon be once cover with fiery volcano 
-PRON- find also that pumice of volcanic origin cool at about the same rate in a laboratory as the moon do between exposure to the sun and an eclipse 
the irregularity on the moon surface be believe therefore to be of volcanic origin 
two layer of ozone in the earth atmosphere one due to ultraviolet light from the sun the other due perhaps to particle or corpuscle shoot at the earth from sunspot be describe at the meeting of the american geophysical union 
in telling of -PRON- study 
dr fowle of the smithsonian institute say that one of these layer of ozone which be a form of oxygen show an annual period of change depend on the position of the earth in -PRON- orbit 
-PRON- think -PRON- be due to ultraviolet light which vary in intensity at different time of the year 
unlike this layer the second layer of ozone show a close relationship to sunspot 
when the sunspot be at -PRON- minimum number -PRON- will probably be absent entirely though the observation have not continue long enough to ascertain this 
dr fowle suggest that some emission of minute corpuscle from the sunspot may account for this layer 
the profession of rainmaking be that of the quack say the weather bureau 
no know mean have be successful in produce rain over any extensive area 
the reason for this say the meteorologist be that the lack of rain be occasion by lack of moisture and if there be no moisture there can be no rain 
those man who contract to produce rain usually do so at a time when rain be about due anyway 
furthermore the weather bureau estimate -PRON- would require to horsepower to evaporate the moisture of a square mile of cloud 
survey the possibility of life exist on other solar planet waldemar kaempffert in the new york time find that mar alone have the potentiality necessary 
-PRON- arrive at -PRON- conclusion from analyze the condition neccessary for life and subject what -PRON- know of each planet to the test 
the condition -PRON- find necessary for life as -PRON- know -PRON- be a climate between limited temperature an atmosphere contain oxygen this also be dependent on the size and speed of rotation of the planet for only under certain condition may planet have and hold onto an atmosphere 
the next condition be the mass of the planet 
if -PRON- be too large the attraction of gravity be so great that the organism would have a tremendous weight and be unable to exist 
the planet must contain water 
the length of the day and the length of the season be also determine condition if life be to exist 
only the earth and mar have the proper condition to support life 
but mar say dr kaempffert be a wornout shrivel senile world thirst for water 
-PRON- be agree that -PRON- have vegetation but a tough vegetation 
and if any sentient being exist those who build the canali -PRON- probably perish long ago 
a new device to prevent stalling be the new fernic distance cruiser a monoplane which will be put through -PRON- test shortly 
the method of prevent stall very commonsense be the use of an auxiliary wing just over the nose of the plane 
there be also an additional landingwheel under the nose which will prevent a noseover when the plane land 
the plane have a wing spread of sixty foot and be equip with wright whirlwind motor 
-PRON- be expect to make a nonstop flight to some european field this summer 
by a recent development of dr alexanderson of the general electric company pilot can now have a positive indication of -PRON- height above the ground even though the weather may be so bad that -PRON- can not see the ground 
the device consist of send a radio impulse to the ground from the plane and pick up the same impulse after -PRON- be reflect from the ground back to the plane 
the ground be pick up as a squeal 
whenever the airplane change altitude by half a wavelength a whistle note go through a complete tone cycle 
by count the cycle of the tone -PRON- be possible to measure the altitude 
a meter read from to foot give the pilot an opportunity to know accurately -PRON- altitude within those limit 
as the plane approach the ground the echo become strong 
a memory reader be connect with the meter by which the meter continue to hold the altitude reading and give off the same echo until the altitude be change 
connect with the device in a manner not explain be colored light 
a green light flash on indicate that the pilot be foot above the ground while a yellow indicate foot and a red light show an altitude of foot 
official examination of the recording instrument use in the junker monoplane pilot by willi neunhofen indicate that -PRON- break the world altitude record attain a height of foot or less than foot short of eight mile 
during -PRON- trip neunhofen pass through a temperature range of degree fahrenheit for -PRON- be degree above zero on the ground and below when -PRON- arrive at the extreme altitude 
at the top of -PRON- climb -PRON- become unconscious from cold and -PRON- machine go into a glide descend almost four mile before -PRON- become conscious again 
-PRON- safety be make possible by an automobile device attach to the steering wheel 
as soon as -PRON- hand be take from the wheel the time when -PRON- slip into unconsciousness an oxygen flow be release and the motor be shut off thus provoke the glide neunhofen state that at almost right mile above the ground leipzig and magdeburg which be about sixty mile apart appear as though -PRON- be only a few hundred foot away from each other 
the contest for the good foolproof plane which the average man or woman can fly sponsor by the guggenheim fund for the promotion of aeronautic be near a close say lauren lyman in the new york time 
very few know plane have already be enter in the contest which will award prize of and a great deal of mystery surround the actual plan of airplane maker 
believe that the average man or woman will not fly until the foolproof plane have be develop one which do not need an aeronautical expert to safely pilot the guggenheim fund be make the condition that plane must fulfill rather exact 
eor example one of the nine condition state that the aircraft must show -PRON- ability to take off or land on a plot foot square surround by a twentyfive foot obstruction 
although the date set for the close of the contest be october only one plane have actually submit -PRON- at mitchel field long island for the test 
this be a brunner winkle biplane build in brooklyn several other entry be definitely know 
because of the infrequency of reproduction in man and long period necessary to wait before result be show scientist try to determine the cause of heredity the determination of sex etc have be oblige to turn to the low form of life say dr blakeslee of the carnegie institution at cold spring harbor in this great laboratory many astounding discovery be be make about the condition that determine what form life be to take 
the experimenter have be able in certain instance to bring a reversal of sex and to endow the offspring with predetermined characteristic 
when enough knowledge about the determine factor be know -PRON- be hope that -PRON- can be apply to man 
that the old conception of race be form by interbreed of characteristic be not true be the opinion of a writer in the journal of the american medical association 
-PRON- bring to the support of -PRON- belief the work of sir arthur keith and thomas huxley famous scientist note for -PRON- work on evolution 
that the cast of feature and pigmentation of the skin be cause independently of racial interbreeding be the conclusion arrive at 
the cast of feature be say to be due to gland change and disorder that may accompany environmental change adaptation or survival as express in the evolutionary doctrine 
the pigmentation be likewise a condition of environment 
if the thyroid gland take on a strange activity declare the writer one may acquire a mongolian cast of countenance 
this may also be cause by the endocrine gland when -PRON- become disordered 
motion picture of the actual operation of part of the human body be show by professor turner of the massachusetts institute of technology before the american child health association 
by mean of xray which be photograph and make into a continuous moving film the action of gland in the stomach by which food be digest be show 
in another film the activity connect with the swallowing of food be also portray 
professor turner say -PRON- be now make picture of the action of the lddney the heart the growth of the tooth and many other physiological function 
the picture be to be use in school as a means of visual education of child on the nature and activity of -PRON- body 
professor turner will also exhibit -PRON- picture at the world federation of education association to be hold at geneva 
that life and the life process may be evaluate and study mathematically be the belief of professor donnan writing in nature london 
-PRON- body and most of -PRON- activity be rule by the necessity of the conservation of energy 
-PRON- be in effect cell building organism obey the law of thermodynamic 
that be the part that -PRON- understand 
beyond that be the so far inexplicable phenomenon of the cell build up something which be great than the sum of -PRON- part 
that some new form of energy that -PRON- be unaware of may be present be the conclusion 
that this phenomenon can be reduce to exact measurement and -PRON- activity understand through mathematical formulae be believe to be true 
that a monopoly in the sale of radium exist and fabulous profit be make on -PRON- while thousand of people be die of cancer be the accusation of the industrial and engineering chemistry edit by dr harrison howe 
the monopoly declare the magazine be control in belgium where radium cost a gram to produce exclusive of mining cost and overhead be sell for a gram retail and to a gram wholesale 
the magazine advocate that special rate be make to research organization who will promise not to resell the material and so depress the market 
the magazine declare that the monopoly now demand all the traffic will bear for a material which mean the difference between life and death 
a revelation as to how move picture studio procure -PRON- ice rink for picture demand -PRON- be make by arthur maas of the maas chemical laboratory in the new york world 
have be the source of supply for the ice for studio mr maas feel qualified to speak on the subject 
-PRON- use -PRON- say a warm substance call hypo make from soda and sulphur 
-PRON- coat on the floor half an inch thick and can be use for skate just as real ice 
further after be use the hypo can be melt gather up and use over again for another rink 
mr maas however doubt whether -PRON- will be put into general use for that purpose 
for the heat that -PRON- exude be enervate 
and as -PRON- be well know skater need the tonio of the cold to stimulate -PRON- to activity 
the treating of cigarette and match so as to make -PRON- less of a fire hazard when -PRON- be discard be recommend by the united state bureau of standard after a number of extensive test 
that the cigarette butt and match that be discard each minute in the united state be responsible for fire cause loss of many million of dollar in damage be the incentive for the work of the bureau 
the cigarette discard while still glow fall on inflammable material such as dry grass and terrible fire be the result 
the method of prevention suggest by the bureau be the coating of the last inch or so of a cigarette with a water glass sodium silicate solution 
by actual test make the bureau believe that this will put the cigarette out and reduce fire loss from such cause by the preventative use for match will be approximately the same the coating of all but a half inch of the match with the water glass so that after the match burn the half inch -PRON- will be automatically extinguish 
professor schwartz of rensselaer polytechnic institute be annoy because the athletic sign on -PRON- campus fade so quickly so as to become indistinguishable 
-PRON- determine therefore to study the problem and find a way of make the color of printing ink expose to the sun fast 
start with the knowledge that fading be cause by the ultraviolet ray of light the professor have discover that the use of thorium one of the earth elemental constituent will retard considerably the effect of the ray 
dr schwartz hope that -PRON- process may be use for fabric such as cotton and silk as well as for printing ink 
science news of the month portray in plain yet concise language every important scien tific advance during the month 
nowhere can the average reader get such a wealth of accurate and vital information condense into such a small volume 
some scientific journal as well as a score of other source be util ize by -PRON- editor in the com pilation of this department 
the publisher welcome short contri bution to these page from the various scientific institution laboratory etc 
that the lesson of the tragedy of the cleveland clinic should be more farreaching than the immediate result be the conclusion of elvira fradkin writing in the new york time 
the clinic floor pile high with body should serve as a warning of what to expect from modern warfare which would use gas even more destructive than the nitrogendioxide 
for while the nitrogendioxide kill those immediately expose -PRON- lose -PRON- effectiveness in the vicinity and do not spread 
but some of the gas of modern warfare lewisite and mustard gas drop from a fast fly airplane over a large city would drop slowly through the city and remain potent for many day 
-PRON- would fill the subway and home as well as the office building with countless corpse 
recent test have show that plane can accomplish this and thereby paralyze a metropolis 
as the inventor of a process of chromiumplate home fixture as well as cutlery professor colin fink of columbia university describe the advantage of -PRON- process 
by electrolytically coat any metal object with chromium no dry be necessary 
the object may merely be subject to hot water to clean -PRON- and then -PRON- may be leave alone 
the dish towel be doom -PRON- say 
the chromiumplated era be about to open 
-PRON- use be be extend also to ornament for woman replace even gold and silver 
-PRON- resemble platinum and have platinum ability to remain without be tarnish 
altho pure metal be consider to be the one that be valuable still -PRON- be not usable in that form 
practically all pure metal state sir william bragg of the royal institution of london must be mix with other metal to form alloy before -PRON- become practically valuable 
the number of use that two metal can be put to will vary with the proportion use so that the use be just as infinite as the proportion 
xray3 have show that the atom in a mixture form a different pattern thereby change the quality of the material 
in pure copper the atom be pile together like spherical shot each sphere touch twelve atom 
when a small amount of zinc atom be add -PRON- distribute -PRON- among the copper atom without disarrangement 
when however a large amount of zinc be add a new atomic pattern be form 
-PRON- be this new pattern which give the alloy the property of brass which be a copperzinc alloy 
that farm relief may come from the utilization of hitherto worthless byproduct of the farm rather than through congressional measure be the belief of chemist express at the annual exposition of chemical industry hold in new york 
many new article be be make from corn and cotton seed that formerly represent a large waste to the farmer 
corn crop that go into the making of corn whiskey be now use to make lacquer 
more than fifty chemical product result from the corn kernel 
among these be table oil soap glycerine starch corn syrup etc cotton seed be now use for produce stearin write paper smokeless oil toilet ware sausage casing and as many equally incongruous thing 
among the thing also discover be a new sugar call xylose which can be make from cottonseed husk and be declare by government expert to have absolutely no tendency to increase the user weight 
-PRON- be about onethird as sweet as ordinary sugar 
a group of scientist from the carnegie institution at cold spring harbor will shortly begin a worldwide study of the origin and activity of earthquake 
the first study will be in the lake tanganyika region of east africa 
other place on the itinerary include the himalayas sumatra java the philippine china and japan 
dr willis who will head the expedition have have worldwide experience with earthquake 
during the severe chile quake of at atacama dr willis make a detailed study 
that the presence of hundred of mile of gigantic ice field at the pole particularly the south pole constitute a potential danger to -PRON- seaport be the belief of alfred rosewood san francisco scientist writing in the new york american although the ice have exist at the pole for a long time the possibility of -PRON- be warm through change in climate or have some heated body come close to the earth be enough to make -PRON- fearful of fiftyfoot tidal wave sweep -PRON- shore 
insanity be due to a large extent to environmental maladjustment declare professor william ogburn of the university of chicago 
certain neurosis and psychosis indicate that the individual have fail to make the necessary adjustment to -PRON- environment 
the chance of a person of fifteen year be place in a hospital for the insane be about one in twenty the professor say 
people unable to stand the confusion and disorder of the city may live happily in rural section while other languish in the rural quiet may be stimulate to healthful activity in the city 
the modern belief in fast as a cureall for disease and a means of attain a sylphlike figure disregard danger in the method declare albert parson sach of the new york world the result of study of the population of berlin during the war when fasting be quite necessary disclose outbreak of many disease as well as mental and nervous degeneration 
although a person can fast for a number of day and apparently have no illeffect this do not prove that none exist 
to carry on the metabolism of the body a certain number of calorie be necessary to hurntup tissue 
a man require the use to which the electric eye may be put have be describe by the industrial bulletin issue by the arthur little corporation 
this little instrument which respond to the slight fluctuation in the intensity of light may control the admission to a bridge or public hall and count the passersby 
-PRON- will detect smoke and automatically start an extinguisher -PRON- sort cigar accord to the grade as designate by the color of the wrapper 
use in a safe -PRON- will respond to the outstretche hand of the burglar and re an alarm 
in a store -PRON- will respond to the flashing of a policeman searchlight and turn on the light for -PRON- inspection 
-PRON- count the vehicle on highway and set a window display in operation when a passerby stop in front 
the discovery of what be the source of cold light as emit by little sea animal constitute a great problem for science declare dr charle kofoid of the university of california before the pacific section of the american association for the advancement of science 
the mystery of the luminescent water of the pacific and partly of the atlantic have be attribute to the metabolic action of small fish call dinoflagellata 
-PRON- be another of mr conception be that the heat of planet depend not alone on the amount receive from the sun but that -PRON- have a natural heat of -PRON- own which depend on the velocity of -PRON- passage through the gravitational field of the sun 
the fast the speed the more natural heat be radiate away and the low will be a bodys natural temperature 
the problem of soil erosion be become such a serious one that a number of interested authority have go into the problem to see what can be do to check -PRON- 
seven erosion station be to be establish in that number of area by the department of agriculture 
the loss yearly due to flood rainwash and gullying be estimate to be field and laboratory study will be make of the terrain where erosion occur and the most effective method of preserve the soil will be determine 
the work of the department of agriculture will be handle by the forest service and the bureau of public road erally calorie a day 
if this be not forthcoming flesh be use up to supply the necessary energy 
further a toxicosis be induce in the blood by the change in -PRON- chemical composition when the raw material necessary for the production of the allnecessary hormone be miss 
so the woman or man who achieve graceful slenderness through fasting may find that -PRON- have induce some change in -PRON- bodily structure that may well prove unpleasant 
the result of recent test of the effect of sleep on the body and brain find that eight hour sleep be none too much say the new york time editorially 
from the result of test of student at colgate university -PRON- be find that four hour of sleep be sufficient to restore the bodily function to normal 
but for the resting of the mind that be not sufficient 
the increase in mental power after awakening seem to have increase with every hour of additional sleep 
but -PRON- be find also that the recuperative value of the sleep depend on the sleep equipment and the other physical condition under which the subject sleep believe that these organism which have spread over the pacific in great number give off light as part of -PRON- process of living 
since the action be chemical analysis of the water in which -PRON- live be expect to reveal something about -PRON- 
the intensity of ultraviolet ray can now be measure by a device demonstrate by dr rentsehler director of research of the westinghouse lamp co 
the purpose of this be to prevent people who be take ultraviolet treatment either from the sun or from a machine from receive terrible burn 
for previously no means of measure the intensity of ultraviolet be possible 
uranium which be sensitive only to ultraviolet ray form the basis of the device 
an electrically charge uranium pole be put into a photoelectric cell 
the charge generate in the cell by the ultraviolet be transmit to a condenser and store until a give potential be obtain 
the energy be then discharge through an argon tube which give a bluish flash 
an ink pencil on a chart mark the current of the discharge 
by vary the current a scale of value be obtain which act now as an actual register or dosage meter which physician can use 
the geological survey of the united state now celebrate -PRON- fiftieth birthday provide service more varied than be understand by the layman say don glassman in the new york time the topographical map which be an abstraction to the man on the street be often a very valuable thing to a railroad plan a new line 
-PRON- be the first thing a power company or city seek for when ready to build a dam or a new reservoir 
-PRON- have act as the agent that search out mineral deposit and lead the way to the development of new land previously uninhabite 
ascend mountain peak and determine -PRON- height be part of the work of the intrepid man of the survey 
-PRON- knowledge of mountain peak have come principally from -PRON- 
-PRON- be the survey also that provide the map which become so valuable in time of war 
for on these map which often list every house every stream or every hill or valley the strategy of a major engagement of war may well be fight 
the lack of knowledge of a sink road at waterloo be undo 
editor because of the richness of the modern diet in food and drink the death rate of diabete reach a new high figure declare the statistical bulletin of the metropolitan life insurance company 
accord to the company the death rate be keep down by the use of insulin although the drug be no cure 
base on -PRON- experience with -PRON- million policy holder the company find the death rate to be for each person 
in these column the case of dr gibb of dalhousie university keep a cat alive for a few minute by use of a rubber heart be mention 
now dr goldston of the new york academy of medicine declare that -PRON- must not infer thereby that human can have the same treatment 
a writer in the new york heraldtribune however ask why not 
people have have metal replace many part of -PRON- body in -PRON- skull larynx etc 
the use of rubber heart be not impossible declare the writer and view the alarming number of death from cardiac trouble in child from the age of ten to fourteen -PRON- believe that someone will consent finally when -PRON- heart be give out to allow the experiment to be do on -PRON- 
by a device recently develop by dr vladmir zworykin of the westinghouse electric and manufacture company a photograph or a print message may be transmit over a beam of light 
the picture or paper contain the print message be place on a cylinder which rotate and move laterally at the same time 
a beam of light be project on the paper and the reflect light gather by a parabolic mirror which pass -PRON- through to a photoelectric cell 
this create an electric impulse correspond to the density of the light 
these impulse be then pass through a gasglow tube which produce the carrier beam of light 
this light project across a room be catch by another parabolic reflector and pass to a photoelectric cell which again change the impulse into electric impulse 
a novel thing about this device be that the actual current be now use to reform the picture 
a specially prepared paper bathe in waten be on a cylinder on the receiving end this cylinder rotate in synchronism with the transmitting 
the action of the electricity on the chemical of the paper by electrolytic action change the color of the paper and recreate the original image 
engineer of the bureau of standard have develop a device whereby one can tell whether radio beacon wave be be maintain on -PRON- determine course 
an indicator will show any deviation or shift in the wave 
-PRON- will be know as a course shift indicator the instrument may also find use on a plane which be direct -PRON- course by the radio beacon 
when the needle of the instrument remain in the center of the scale the pilot be in the middle of -PRON- course 
if -PRON- deviate from -PRON- the needle will swing to one side 
the opening of commercial radiophone service to europe be initiate recently by the placing in operation of the short wave transmission center of the bell system at lawrenceville all telephone message to europe will in the future be relay to this station and radio from there 
three separate channel be now in use and -PRON- be expect that before the end of the year that two more one to europe and one to buenos aire will be in operation 
in europe and in south america similar station be be build 
the transmit antenna at lawrenceville be string on 180foot steel tower place foot apart and at right angle to the direction the voice wave travel 
the great project ever plan into the cause of mental ill include crime general delinquency sleep sickness insanity epilepsy and other will be start shortly by the neurological institute of new york 
when -PRON- have reach the completion of an endowment fund of the institute will have fiftynine leader in neurology and psychiatry attack sixtyfive important problem of research into the mental ill 
the prenatal mental influence as well as the organic change of the brain which take place in early life will receive a great deal of attention and the mental life of individual will be study a completeness never match before 
the institute be not wait until -PRON- fund be gather in full but will start -PRON- program immediately 
in a recent test as report by max valier of germany in discovery london a speed of mile per hour be obtain in a rocket sle 
a series of rocket be explode and at the fifth series the speed be already mile per hour as an average 
and inasmuch as the last seventy yard be under brake control the high speed be believe to have be obtain 
herr valier who believe that the rocket will be the future mean of propulsion be plan a rocket ship by which -PRON- hope to make a trip from dover to calais this summer 
the rocket accord to -PRON- be in the same position as the airplane be in answer a recent article of joseph caillaux in the new york heraldtribune on the evil of the machine age 
secretary of labor jame davi defend -PRON- age though admit -PRON- imperfection 
the machine age be liberate man from physical slavery -PRON- say and the advance in science be remove poverty from the masse 
although -PRON- suffer from a comparison with the golden age of pericle in greece for -PRON- have not the great man produce then still -PRON- say in that day the thinker and artist be all aristocrat and the masse be hold in dumb ignorant slavery 
now -PRON- have a wide dissemination of knowledge 
in fact more people can read shakespeare today than in the day of the bard -PRON- 
the common people of today live better than king in age past and for this -PRON- must thank the great number of -PRON- scientific achievement include the mass production of the necessity of life 
to fill the need of person aboard ship converse by telephone with person on land a series of experiment will be start by the american telephone and telegraph company on a service 
radiophone will connect the passenger with the company station at deal beach and from there -PRON- be plan the passenger can be connect with any telephone subscriber in the country 
the first test will be conduct between the steamship leviathan and the deal beach station 
the transmitter now use for telephony will be use in the test 
the ability to transmit not only object but -PRON- color by television be demonstrate recently at the bell laboratory of the american telephone and telegraph company 
on a receiver about the size of a postage stamp be receive the image successively of a red white and blue american flag the union jack a watermelon and a pot of geranium 
the transmitter be locate about foot from the receiver a wire be use for transmission in this demonstration 
the invention be make possible by the use of three photoelectric cell one be able to filter out red one blue and the third green 
-PRON- would sir oliver lodge deny that the theory of ether fill all space have be explode 
-PRON- deny also that einstein prove that the ether do not exist 
the ether must exist declare sir oliver 
for without -PRON- the heat of the sun could not travel across mile to -PRON- earth nor could the heat from -PRON- fireplace reach -PRON- a few foot away 
ether be what conduct all electric current as well as radio wave 
in the former case -PRON- be not the wire that be the conductor 
the wire merely guide the current as rail guide a train 
amazing discovery in physics that be not yet ready for popular consumption be be make at an astonishing rate 
sir oliver also declare 
-PRON- be be make so fast that each year make those of the year before seem antiquated 
the prospect for humanity be bright 
although -PRON- be barely scratch the surface of universal knowledge -PRON- be make progress at an accelerate rate 
on properly guide science the hope for the world rest 
that the terrible weapon to be develop by science in the future will by -PRON- very power serve as a moral persuasion against war be the belief of martyn write in the new york time when man realize the terrific possibility of the weapon -PRON- be use and have the picture of whole nation which be economically interdependent be wipe out -PRON- will hesitate to use those weapon 
of all the instrument to be use in the future mr martyn find the airplane and electricity to be the most powerful 
poison gas when spread by shell be too uncertain and there be a limit to the use of high explosive for the more powerful -PRON- become the more possibility there be of premature explosion 
airplane control by radio will spread death and destruction to whole countryside 
then will come aerial torpedo which will be guide by radio and detonate at exactly the right moment 
television will enable enemy to seek out the most vulnerable point of each other 
and finally the use of electric power transmit over radio beam will enable enemy to electrocute army hundred of mile away 
if science serve only warfare say dr lewis inventor of lewisite -PRON- would indeed be a human curse 
but the writer feel that the knowledge of this curse will be the most effective bar against war seem then that the device as -PRON- be now be limit to those color 
editor 
the image to be portray be scan by a flicker beam of light whose intensity vary and which be change through the photoelectric cell into a fluctuate dectrio current 
no new apparatus be need to transmit color as attachment to the usual television set will add the color 
result from an extended series of experiment on the cause of the fading of the intensity of radio wave as receive the bureau of standard have arrive at seven reason for the fading 
the experiment be conduct with two station in maryland use various type of antenna for receive 
the variation of the intensity be study with relation to the local condition of the atmosphere temperature time of day etc and the follow result be among those that have be obtain the ray undergoe variation in intensity during -PRON- course through the upper atmosphere before -PRON- get to the antennae 
in the case of nearby station much fading be cause by interference between ground and reflect ray 
direction shift be responsible for a certain amount of fade 
much fading be also cause by rotation of the plane of polarization of ray reflect from the upper atmosphere during the sunset period particularly 
if man be ever wipe off the map -PRON- will be due to the onslaught from the insect world accord to the new york state college of forestry of syracuse university 
the great destruction of all kind of valuable tree have show the power of rise insect specie and new fungus disease 
mean of combat these insect be unknown and -PRON- be rapidly carry on -PRON- work of destruction 
since the animal be more adaptable on earth than man and can escape detection -PRON- can carry on a systematic work of destroy not only -PRON- wood but also -PRON- crop and so kill off -PRON- race 
what be need accord to the college be determine and persistent battle against the insect 
bee be not so intelligent as -PRON- be repute to be declare the american bee journal editorially even though -PRON- may be possess of other quality human find enviable 
a recent test be conduct to determine -PRON- ability to return to -PRON- own hive when other hiv be place close to -PRON- 
bee from a certain hive be mark and then experimenter place hive of a color similar ta -PRON- own in the same neighborhood 
altogether bee return to -PRON- correct hive while wander into hive other than -PRON- own 
all this happen during a quarter of an hour 
in another experiment a photoelectric cell be place at the entrance to a hive to determine the number of bee that pass in or out 
the number be find to be surprisingly small 
a that the modern city with -PRON- tremendous overcrowding and -PRON- storing of physical and psychical explosive power be a potential menace to the inhabitant -PRON- be the belief of stuart chase as express before the league of industrial democracy 
-PRON- show a city to be rest on an ever weaken substructure compress noxious vapor store human carbon dioxide and lie expose to attack from the sky 
gas and cloud from the sky poison vapor from below and carbon dioxide between be -PRON- description of the city 
transportation system overburden pump -PRON- back and forth between place where -PRON- would rather not work to place where -PRON- would rather not live until a saturation point and a tragic breakdown result 
the only solution mr chase can see be to have the city planner in complete control 
i this department -PRON- shall publish every month -PRON- opinion 
after all this be -PRON- magazine and -PRON- be edit for -PRON- 
if -PRON- fall down on the choice of -PRON- story or if the editorial board slip up occasionally -PRON- be up to -PRON- to voice -PRON- opinion 
-PRON- make no difference whether -PRON- letter be complimentary critical or whether -PRON- contain a good oldfashione brickbat 
all be equally welcome 
all of -PRON- letter as much as space will allow will be publish here for the benefit of all 
due to the large influx of mail no communication to this department be answer individually unless 25c in stamp to cover time and postage be remit 
the jury bring -PRON- verdict editor science wonder story i have read every issue of the new magazine so far publish and hence be go to tell -PRON- what thought i have concern -PRON- i will put in -PRON- opinion in trial form so lend -PRON- -PRON- ear alsoi -PRON- eye 
the courtroom be crowd with science fiction fan the jury be ready the judge be seat and then there come a low murmur from the massed spectator 
halfway honest 
criticism be come 
behind -PRON- come -PRON- assistant brickbat critic and comment among -PRON- in formidable array 
story look to -PRON- friend 
-PRON- be a defendant very much worried 
wonder who s defend old say one fan to another 
-PRON- answer come with the appearance of lawyer appreciative praise 
lawyer praise be not alone -PRON- seem for with -PRON- be old reader 
the court have be call to order the trial begin 
criticism to the delight o the audience put story on the stand 
after the usual ritual criticism say gravely have here mr story some complaint against -PRON- and as district attorney i adjure -PRON- to tell the truth about -PRON- object shout praise suddenly mr story be already swear in 
objection sustain say the judge coldly 
then to proceed to take a sip of water go on 
number one complaint be that -PRON- express preposterous idea 
do -PRON- voice be hard 
no 
as -PRON- well know the preposterous idea of one decade be the accept thing of the next 
let that go then say the prosecutor uncomfortably 
next -PRON- find -PRON- say that -PRON- science be pseudoscience 
well say story with a smile have nearly twenty scientist of high repute on -PRON- board of science editor 
criticism flush pass that for now -PRON- answer be good enough -PRON- mutter hastily 
go on to point no -PRON- be say that only halfcrazy ignorant people like -PRON- idea and read -PRON- a real preposterous idea for -PRON- cry indignantly 
such people would never understand instructive story often write by scientist -PRON- 
criticism be stumped 
-PRON- turn to praise 
-PRON- witness -PRON- state 
praise look at story 
pass say -PRON- the defendant story speak for -PRON- or rather mr story do 
another witness query the judge begin criticism when -PRON- suddenly feel a tug at -PRON- sleeve 
-PRON- look at brickbat who sit at -PRON- side 
why yes just one more witness 
mr brickbat will take the stand 
brickbat go to the stand confidently 
well what be -PRON- testimony ask criticism read one issue of this magazine and -PRON- wonderful come the surprising answer 
those complaint have be prove ground in an ultimate sense on nothing and for the magazine first last and always 
criticism snort and turn to praise suppose -PRON- have no question -PRON- grunt 
no i havenot 
then the state rest 
the jury be not out long 
what be the verdict ask the judge guilty l of what 
of be the good magazine on the market light then presently praise turn to the judge and the sentence 
be a long one 
i hereby sentence science wonder story to keep go and grow forever wild applause and court be adjourn 
frank kelly kansas city mo 
-PRON- find mr description of the trial of science wonder story intensely interesting as well as contain a great deal of subtle truth 
anyway -PRON- be happy to receive the verdict and assure -PRON- reader that old have already begin serve -PRON- sentence 
editor why be there heat and light through a vacuum editor science wonder story in the july and august edition of this singular magazine i have be especially attract by the educational topic entitle the problem of space fly by captain hermann noordung of berlin and -PRON- editorial entitle the wonder of space 
after have read these article i be leave in a deep abyss of doubt as to the probability of such an enterprise as space flying 
i be not a skeptic 
i be merely make an attempt perhaps a futile attempt to coordinate logic with guess 
before allow the profound thinker to begin think as to whether space or matter be in existence first donot -PRON- believe -PRON- would be well to have -PRON- solve the relationship of what space really consist 
because how could -PRON- attempt to solve that ageold question before -PRON- know what space be or what -PRON- consist of 
-PRON- contradict -PRON- own statement theory and hypothesis so often that -PRON- make one head dizzy 
for instance -PRON- say that space be a vacuum 
have -PRON- any concrete proof of -PRON- so that -PRON- could without a doubt prove -PRON- to be so 
do -PRON- at any time really attempt to prove -PRON- 
then -PRON- go on to say that light and heat be vibratory motion that on earth these prove fact be transmit through an unknown phenomena an unknown medium filling alt space 
but in space which a vacuum and be therefore devoid of any such transmit medium because a vacuum be an absolutely empty space how then be -PRON- possible for the heat and light wave to reach the earth from the sun moon and star or even to be transmit for such a short distance in space as one million mile 
i therefore believe that if these same thinker would solve the mystery of space exist at the present time -PRON- should then have a concrete basis to start work on the problem as to whether space or matter be the first to exist 
i be in favor and i believe -PRON- would be a godsend to the layman for -PRON- to publish more such educational article as the problem of space flying 
the other story be merely good to instruct and forewarn the public of future possibility 
i be and be an ardent reader of -PRON- publication and editorial mr gernsback even though this be the first time i take the liberty to praise or criticize 
i be a college student and be not ashamed to show -PRON- publication around 
hymand kaidor bronx 
when mr kaidor ask how -PRON- be possible heat and light to reach -PRON- through the vacuum of outer space -PRON- pose a question to which science have as yet find no answer 
that be to say -PRON- have find no medium through which heat light and even radio wave travel when -PRON- pass through a vacuum 
-PRON- be once think that some allpervade ether be the vehicle that carry the vibration 
the ether theory however have receive a severe jolt at the hand of einstein 
the late belief of eddington be that there be no total vacuum in outer space but a very very thin dissemination of some material 
that this material act as a carrier be to be doubt 
-PRON- may say however that there be no necessity of an actual carrier medium for light and heat wave 
the mystery of -PRON- transmission through empty space merely defy -PRON- imagination 
-PRON- profess not to be able to conceive of -PRON- passing through a vacuum 
the proof of the vacuum of outer space have be obtain by spectroscopic mean 
of course no one have ever be there to test -PRON- but -PRON- astronomical instrument can do that job just as well 
-PRON- do not know that an absolute vacuum exist but -PRON- know that -PRON- be pretty close to one 
-PRON- agree that one must not lose -PRON- mental balance because one scientist make a socalle discovery 
each person must weight the logic and reasonableness of -PRON- before accept -PRON- 
editor 
do not favor forum editor science wonder story the cover illustration of the august issue be the good of the three issue so far publish 
paul certainly be do -PRON- duty 
i be sorry to hear of the death of garret serviss 
i also read of -PRON- in a chicago paper that -PRON- article be publish in 
why not print some of -PRON- story in science wonder story i pick out the alien intelligence by jack williamson as the good story in the august number 
the radium pool by ed earl repp follow a close second and the feminine metamorphosis by keller third 
i be in favor of the propose new department on scientific technical question and answer 
-PRON- be take enough room with science news of the month 
neither the latter department nor the propose one should be in a science fiction magazine 
the late science news can be obtain in any of the many science news magazine on the newsstand 
what -PRON- publish be not the late news 
so much for brickbat 
i receive and read the first six of the science fiction series 
all of -PRON- be very good about how often be -PRON- go to put out these book 
i like the paper use in the book and i think -PRON- would be a good kind to use in science wonder story only -PRON- should be a little thin so as not to make the magazine so bulky as -PRON- be now 
i have nothing to complain against the story as -PRON- all have be very good 
jack darrow chicago be very glad to get mr view on the propose department for the answering of question on science 
the asking for a vote on the question indicate -PRON- desire to know what -PRON- reader want 
-PRON- invite -PRON- reader to not only send in -PRON- vote but to express -PRON- view freely through these column 
for -PRON- be only by -PRON- expression of opinion that -PRON- really know what to give -PRON- 
editor a thorough classification editor science wonder story be write primarily to let -PRON- know receive the first three issue of -PRON- glorious magazine and eagerly await the fourth 
however as a secondary matter give -PRON- -PRON- opinion of -PRON- story 
every story i read i put into one of three class a very good 
a story recommend to a person like to enlist in the rank of the reader of science wonder story 
a story with charm imaginative appeal etc a story i like to reread 
a story which be good as long as -PRON- last but which i do not care to reread 
a rare type of story indeed in -PRON- magazine 
a story in the place of which rather see another 
an inferior type 
well here goesl a warrior of space jame marshall the alien intelligence jack williamson 
the moon beast william locke 
the boneless horror david keller the reign of the ray lester and pratt 
the marble virgin kennie the threat of the robot david keller the making of misty isle coblentz 
the menace from below hari vincent 
the eternal man sharp 
the feminine metamorphosis keller the radium pool so far ed earl repp 
the diamond maker well 
there be none for so far but the diamond maker come near be a total loss 
the problem of space flying can not so far as i can ee be contradict or criticize in any way 
science news of the month be a huge success with -PRON- 
i see in general science news that garrett serviss have die 
i be sure -PRON- would be do many other besides -PRON- a favor by reprint in forthcoming issue of -PRON- mag -PRON- five great story the moon maid the deluge the moon metal the conquest of mar and columbus of space or how would this do 
put each of the five story in a science fiction series book 
theodore engel new york city 
this be the most carefully think out classification of story that -PRON- have receive thus far 
-PRON- rather like the division into which mr engel have place the story 
-PRON- be sure that -PRON- author will be very much interested to see where theif story be place 
in case other of -PRON- reader disagree with mr classification of any story -PRON- invite -PRON- to send -PRON- -PRON- own list 
-PRON- would be very interesting to compare -PRON- 
so far warrior of space have be acclaim an almost universal favorite despite the criticism that have be level against some of -PRON- science 
editor mr pratt review warrior of space editor science wonder story i donot know how far -PRON- be proper for one writer to criticize another but there be a scientific mistake in mr story warrior of space in the june issue that seem to be worthy of some comment 
mr marshall terminate -PRON- story by have the space car tow saturn and -PRON- moon down and fle -PRON- into the sun 
now in the first place the body of dimension pass through the solar system as close to the other planet as -PRON- would have to on -PRON- way to the sun would be extremely likely to upset the whole system just what direction be largely a matter of guesswork as -PRON- involve the problem of three body 
but -PRON- be certain that condition on the earth would never be the same again nor on any of the other planet 
however this be not all 
if a body of even asteroidal dimension be to collide with the sun -PRON- would strike the surface with a high velocity and penetrate quite deeply through the rarefy exterior before stop 
-PRON- kinetic energy would be change to heat energy and would form a center of heat great than anything find outside the bluewhite star far great than the heat of the surround solar layer as can be show quite easily by calculation 
this heat be sufficient to build -PRON- up by bring about further release of energy from solar source make the center of heat around the planet still hotter and as the sun act as a perfect gas this intensely heated pocket would explode 
-PRON- be possible to show that -PRON- would blow the upper layer of the sun clean away from -PRON- with a force so great that -PRON- gravitational attraction could not hold -PRON- 
the sun would thus become a nova and be surround by a layer of rapidly expand gas rushing outward at speed of the order of km per second or enough to reach the earth in a little less than the day 
now this flame gas reach the earth a day afterward would burn the whole business to a cinder in no time at all 
a body of size fling into the sun would in fact be enough to make the sun the most brilliant nova in the heaven and life could continue to exist on earth for just about hour after saturn strike the sun 
-PRON- authority be seeliger pickere and russell 
fletcher pratt brooklyn 
in order to completely answer mr criticism of warrior of space -PRON- send -PRON- letter to professor samuel barton of the flower observatory university of pennsylvania 
professor barton be one of the distinguished member of -PRON- board of associate editor 
-PRON- print herewith without comment professort letter 
editor 
the annihilation of saturn and -PRON- satellite would cause but a very slight disturbance in the solar system 
the magnitude of the disturbance which would be cause by pull saturn through the system would depend upon how closely saturn approach the other planet in -PRON- passage and upon the length of time -PRON- remain -PRON- vicinity 
the disturbance to the earth would be very considerable if -PRON- approach closely enough to produce the tidal effect describe 
in the story the mass of saturn be merge with that of the sun 
the effect of add this mass to the sun would be to decrease the mean distance of the earth from the sun by the comparatively small amount of mile and to decrease the length of the year by about five hour 
saturn may easily pass through the system and have but little great effect than this upon the earth 
the disturbance possible would range between this and that cause by an actual collision 
the effect of the fall into the sun be substantially as describe in the second part of mr letter 
however as saturn be draw in -PRON- would greatly increase the speed of -PRON- revolution about the sun and would not strike -PRON- surface perpendicularly 
i may state that the attractive force of the sun upon saturn be equal to the weight of ton 
this enormous force would cause saturn to move only inch in the first second 
if saturn be pull straight into the sun by the gravitational pull in other word if -PRON- fall into the sun year would be consume in the fall 
but the pull of the sun vary inversely with the square of the distance and thus increase at a great rate with the approach of the sun 
this give some idea of the power ascribe to the space car which pull saturn into the sun in minus five day if i read aright for in chapter nine wc be tell that over day elapse from the departure of the space car from the earth before donald give the command pull and in the tenth chapter -PRON- be tell that on the thirtieth day from the departure louise notice the startling event cause by that same wonderful pull 
the professor must have be a bit excited when -PRON- state that the light from saturn take three day to reach -PRON- 
i fear that the warrior of space from the ninth satellite of saturn which apparently be leave behind will sooner or later wreak -PRON- vengeance on the earth 
the ring of saturn i suppose be place by donald on the finger of louise 
samuel barton 
once call science fiction brainstorm editor science wonder story what science fiction mean to -PRON- i glance at that headline with interest and read the datum beneath 
then i think just what do -PRON- mean 
all i can say now be that i have a great deal of respect for the author of 
continue on page science question and answer month -PRON- ask -PRON- reader to vote on the science question and answer department 
-PRON- receive a great many letter from -PRON- reader who ask -PRON- to enlarge the scope of the magazine by print answer to scientific question that -PRON- may ask of interest not only to -PRON- but to all reader 
-PRON- put the question to a vote and attach a voting coupon which be to be fill out by the reader -PRON- 
as -PRON- go to press -PRON- be in receipt of thousand of coupon fully of the vote tabulate show the unmistakable trend of -PRON- reader wish and that be -PRON- vote overwhelmingly for a new department 
accordingly science question and answer start in the october issue 
in this department -PRON- aim to answer scientific question which -PRON- reader may ask and -PRON- will publish those question and answer which -PRON- feel be of interest to the majority 
if anything puzzle -PRON- in any of the various branch of science such as astronomy biology radio chemistry medicine physics electricity or any general scientific topic write to -PRON- but please do not ask more than three question at a time 
this new department do not answer individual question by mail and of course -PRON- will be impossible to publish all question 
the editor will try to answer as many each month as space permit 
there be of course no charge for this service 
address all question to the editor 
the life of the white ant by the celebrated poet and author the termite the white ant be small insect live in underground colony without ever come into the air 
-PRON- subterranean home be marvellously build with provision for ventilation central heating system etc and be top by a cupola sometimes twelve foot in height 
million of blind termite live within the nest divide into caste 
whenever the worker leave the termitaria -PRON- use tunnel work -PRON- way into tree furniture and wall of house which -PRON- devour silently and invisibly with fearful destruction 
all termite be subject to an iron discipline a terrible tyranny which maeterlinck compare to bolshevism in -PRON- extreme 
maeterlinck do not hesitate to declare that from many point of view the civilization of the termite grim and repellant though -PRON- be be ahead of -PRON- human civilization that these insect possess a more scientific genius than be find in man 
as in the life of the bee the author have draw from the story of the white ant a profound and move philosophy of human life and -PRON- ultimate development and goal 
dr david story the human termite be base upon this book of maeterlinck and anybody want to have a well knowledge about termite should by all mean read -PRON- 
add 10c for pottage park place new york the reader speak continue from page that simple sound title 
if i be the master of a dozen language i may possibly collect a dazzling array of bewilder adjective that would exactly express -PRON- feeling toward scientific fiction 
the first thing scientific fiction ever mean to -PRON- be recreation 
i use to pounce on every periodical with the idea of see -PRON- favorite author late brainstorm yes i call -PRON- brainstorm 
now however science with -PRON- have become a hobby a recreation and a source of educational experience 
i have peruse textbook laboratory manual and treatise on science of all imaginable sort 
and then i chance upon -PRON- first issue of mr original gift to the world of scientific literature 
today scientific fiction to -PRON- mean the easy route to a complete knowledge of the relationship of physical and material fact to -PRON- and this planet -PRON- live on 
this last statement i feel bring -PRON- idea and the print word into the close conceivable affinity 
i thank mr gernsback again for -PRON- second original and startling tribute to modern literature 
cooke frankfort north dakota 
-PRON- be very glad to get mr sincere and understanding view of the value of science fiction 
the evolution -PRON- say -PRON- pass through be quite characteristic of that of most intelligent people 
-PRON- think -PRON- quite natural that at first -PRON- view science fiction a9 something absurd extravagant and fantastic 
-PRON- be quite willing that -PRON- be so 
for science fiction come on -PRON- as such a new and startling experience that view -PRON- from the standard of the cold realistic fiction -PRON- know -PRON- be unable to swallow -PRON- 
but -PRON- be only after -PRON- have become acclimate to the thrill adventure of science fiction and be able to mentally bridge the gap between these adventure and the world of the future that -PRON- can write letter such as this one of mr cooke 
editor prom harl vincent have just finish read the july issue of science wonder story from cover to cover i feel that i must write to -PRON- to express -PRON- pleasure and appreciation of -PRON- general excellence 
-PRON- can not fail to succeed after the fly start of the first two issue 
i be especially pleased with the makeup of -PRON- own story as print 
the title and subtitling of the chapter be do to perfection and improve the story considerably 
the conclude installment of be great 
harl vincent new york city 
-PRON- print without comment this letter from mr vincent one of -PRON- fine author edu tor 
on lift the leviathan editor science wonder story i have receive the first two issue of -PRON- new magazine and desire to congratulate -PRON- both as regard the content and appearance of this publication 
the story which seem to -PRON- to be good be the alien intelligence the reign of the ray and the boneless horror 
these three story seem to be distinctly outstanding the last especially be of a quite unusual type 
the first show a distinctly skillful and alluring use of imagihation and be in -PRON- opinion the good of the three 
i be much interested in -PRON- lead article on gravitation but have -PRON- consider the fact that whilst the weight of a body vary from planet to planet the mass or inertia be the same on earth or in empty space 
in other word to raise a body weighing lb -PRON- must exert a great force than lb weight the magnitude of this extra force depend upon the rate at which -PRON- be raise 
if -PRON- suppose that the man on -PRON- imaginary small planet be exert a maximum force of lbs -PRON- obtain the follow rather interesting result the ship to be raise to a height of foot would require minute which would impose rather a strain upon the physique of -PRON- strong man 
further if -PRON- now release the ship -PRON- would still continue to rise another inch and would then gradually fall back to the ground reach -PRON- in second 
the above result can be obtain by simple arithmetic from the two well know law of kinetic that impulse vary as momentum and space pass over the product of velocity by time 
these aspect of the question as indeed the whole discussion although purely theoretical be nevertheless very interesting to work out to -PRON- logical conclusion 
i approve very much of the good stout paper on which -PRON- story be print 
bain brussel belgium 
mr analysis of the problem of lift the leviathan out in comparatively free space be indeed very interesting 
from a mathematical point of view -PRON- conclusion be undoubtedly correct 
that -PRON- would be quite a strain on the strong man -PRON- grant 
but -PRON- believe that for the privilege of be able with -PRON- physical strength alone to lift what on earth be ton one must be quite willing to risk the strain 
-PRON- must look on the feat as quite phenomenal under any condition 
however -PRON- be very glad to get mr describe science correspondence club editor science wonder story i have be want to write to -PRON- ever since the inception of -PRON- magazine but i have be so occupied that i be unable to communicate with -PRON- until this time 
as -PRON- will notice by the letter head i also be a member of the science correspondence club introduce to the public last issue through -PRON- fellow member maloire 
i may add this to -PRON- reference 
the club aim be to bring together those who wish to compare -PRON- pet idea and theory with other scientifically inclined and to hold debate on the same by mail 
thus a correspondence can be keep up indefinitely 
the need for such a club be often express in the column of -PRON- former organ of science fiction but -PRON- seem to have be put off until recently 
now i feel inclined to cruelly toss a few more brickbat at the battlescarred veteran author who have earn -PRON- by insert glare scientific fallacy in -PRON- story 
warrior of space the man of dione have a disintegrator ray that destroy everything but gold 
therefore as -PRON- have none of that element which woufd be need to reflect the ray -PRON- own apparatus would be destroy and the dionian would be as utterly annihilate as the tellurian if the ray have time to generate -PRON- 
the marble virgin i advance the same argument as the other criticizer of the story 
moreover the statue be marble all the way through while the human body consist of different organ with variation in the form of protoplasm 
again i hold -PRON- inconceivable that a consciousness can be endow as the result of physiochemical reaction 
this have never be prove to the contrary and never will be 
leonard may jersey city 
-PRON- be particularly happy to get mr letter as -PRON- be very much interested in the activity of the science correspondence club 
that there exist a place for such a club compose of people interested in the future of science and in discuss general scientific question there remain no doubt 
-PRON- be happy to extend any support possible to make the club a editor universe large enough for -PRON- editor science wonder story in the july issue of science wonder story under science news of the month i see the statement that the radius of -PRON- universe be mile 
this estimate although somewhat conservative substantiate theory of a finite universe 
before i see this article i have calculate the radius of the universe to be mile by a little algebra and less astronomy on the basis of theory that the 96th circle be thelimit of the universe 
the 96th circle in a series of circle in geometrical progression beginning with a radius of cm and be double each time 
although i be but a junior in high school i love to calculate and cogitate on problem and theory 
not stop at the radius of the universe i set about to calculate the volume of -PRON-

continue from page mile in the universe would be too large a figure to put down on paper i compute the volume in cubic light year 
with the follow information glean from an almanac length of a year day hour minute and second 
speed of light mile per second 
i calculate the number of second in a year to be thus with the speed of light and the number of second in a year i find a light year to be mile 
but round number be better suited to compute such inconceivable quantity as cubic light year 
assume that the universe be a sphere with the aforementioned radius i find that -PRON- cubic content be cubic mile or cubic light year 
yes sir this little old universe be large enough for -PRON- 
wish -PRON- success in -PRON- new publication i be earl valet brooklyn 
the universe be indeed large enough accord to mr calculation to afford -PRON- breathing space 
-PRON- must be impress with -PRON- own insignificance to realize that even travel with the speed of light -PRON- would take -PRON- hundred of million of year to reach the outermost limit of the universe 
in fact there be star in existence that -PRON- will never see because -PRON- first ray of light after -PRON- come into existence hundred of million of year ago be still travel toward -PRON- through space and have not yet reach -PRON- editor why be uranus neglect 
editor science wonder story write this little epistle to air -PRON- view on -PRON- new magazine 
the very first issue sure click with -PRON- 
the second be even better all the story be excellent and the good be unusually good 
the good story in the first issue be accord to -PRON- way of thinking 
jack superb warrior of space 
for sheer dare -PRON- almost take -PRON- breath away 
run a dose second be kennie story the marble virgin 
-PRON- be hard to choose between these excellent story as to which be good 
the reign of the ray fail to go over with -PRON- for some reason or other 
just didnot hold -PRON- interest 
as i have remark above the second issue be by far the good 
the paper be far and away of a well class and didnot resemble a western magazine paper so much 
the size of the magazine loom big in -PRON- eye for -PRON- make a nice look magazine die size seem to give -PRON- distinction 
man but artist paul be sure put out the good for -PRON- infant magazine 
the story that take the cake in the second issue be jack the alien intelligence 
talk about a story i also greatly admire harl the menace from below 
why be -PRON- that -PRON- writer never touch upon the planet uranus 
i donot remember have read a story that even mention the planet 
be there no possibility of -PRON- be inhabit 
why canot -PRON- have some story by edwin stoat 
-PRON- flight to venus be a sort of masterpiece in science fiction 
a sequel to this story would go well with -PRON- 
i like especially story of the moon 
the good story i have read on this subject be the death of the moon 
-PRON- ought to have more story like monorail to the moon by proxy and reprisal 
these story be model of what a short but interesting science fiction story ought to be 
just a few word more and i will close 
i see nothing but a rosy and successful future for science wonder stoeie for there be no get around the fact that -PRON- be interesting and instructive and when i say this i know what i be talk about for i have read all -PRON- life 
in fact that be all i do 
so just keep harl vincent jack williamson kennie and jack marshall at work not to mention paul and sit still in the boat and donot worry about the future

-PRON- be very interesting to get mr analysis of the first two issue of science wonder story 
-PRON- be glad to note also that -PRON- like the second issue well than the first 
the majority of comment -PRON- receive about the june issue be on the story that mr hood pick as the good the marble virgin and warrior of space 
-PRON- personal belief be that despite the criticism against -PRON- scientific fault the marble virgin hasi an excellent construction and plot 
in many way -PRON- embody characteristic of the model science fiction story 
kennie have promise -PRON- a sequel to -PRON- 
mr question about uranus be certainly well take 
uranus be one of the planet about which -PRON- know little 
-PRON- be next to neptune the most distant planet in the solar system and be suppose to have a climate exceedingly cold 
-PRON- have further no atmosphere and the chance of -PRON- be inhabit be quite remote 
however some day an enterprising sciencefictionist will study the planet and evolve a surprising story about uranus 
-PRON- be contemplate for a future quarterly a story about the moon that will make history 
editor 
religion and science compatible editor science wonder story i have just be read what science fiction mean to -PRON- and the reader speak in the july issue of science wonder story 
i be surprised at the fact that all the letter in both department come from the antipode of -PRON- country 
california and new york be unusually well represent while from the middle west there be not on single chirp 
be the spirit of scientific adventure in this part of the world so dead as all that science wonder story be live up to the promise -PRON- make in -PRON- letter to -PRON- charter subscriber 
the alien intelligence be very good 
there come up that comparison with the moon pool again 
i be one of the unfortunate who miss the moon pool and i would appreciate information as to where a copy of -PRON- can be obtain 
the reign of the ray be too complicated in plot and contain too much matter irrelevant to the scientific part 
however one man meat be another man poison 
the possibility of an immense bubble under the earth crust inhabit or not be captivate and altogether possible much more so than the brain surgery contain in the menace from below 
the problem of space flying bring out a lot of obvious point apparently overlook by space fiction writer 
however such detail properly belong in an article not in fiction 
keep on tell -PRON- just a little about the story for next month 
-PRON- whet -PRON- appetite for the feast in store for -PRON- 
i think the subject of the relationship of the structure of the atom to that of the universe and the possibility of -PRON- universe be compose of atom of matter in a superuniverse where a second of time be an aeon to -PRON- be especially interesting and plausible 
-PRON- also have great possibility as a scientific interpretation of that future abode where time shall be no more 
the fundamental of religion be become more and more compatible with science as research go on 
the man who say that scientific study make -PRON- an infidel be either an infidel from the start or be singularly unobservant 
-PRON- be not too farfetched to believe that even the miracle record in the bible be the working of natural law with which -PRON- be not yet acquaint 
i impatiently await the arrival of the first quarterly 
foltz indianapolis indiana 
-PRON- agree with mr foltz in that -PRON- see no incompatibility between scientific knowledge and true religion by true religion -PRON- mean that feeling of see a plan in the universe and draw a lesson or a philosophical conclusion regard -PRON- place in -PRON- and -PRON- mode of conduct 
the great man of religious thought and teaching and the great man of science have always understand one another 
therefore the world of einstein and the world of a great religious leader unbiased and not prejudice by dogma and can not should be one

editor do -PRON- again editor science wonder story i have the july issue of -PRON- new science wonder storie the one with the ship on the cover 
may i comment on -PRON- 
i like the general makeup of -PRON- very much though there seem to be too much ink on the illustration 
-PRON- be very dark 
i have no criticism to make on the story and -PRON- author but the cover 
-PRON- be very misleading as -PRON- do not have a bearing on any story and not much on the article as i can see 
an editorial doesnot warrant an illustration even if -PRON- be by -PRON- 
praise 
besides the cover be too well too ordinary commonplace 
oh mr gemsback donot do -PRON- again 
the alien intelligence have make a much finer illustration -PRON- now 
so paul here to more fantastic and startling cover drawing 
the more dare the well what -PRON- all most of -PRON- want 
-PRON- illustration for the moon pool long ago be marvelous 
and mr gernsback i hope that formidable array of scientist -PRON- have as associate editor wonot influence -PRON- otherwise 
-PRON- probably know what -PRON- be about though but remember -PRON- have competition the paper 
why why do -PRON- insist on give -PRON- a magazine so bulky 
make -PRON- thin even if -PRON- use cheap paper 
make -PRON- thin 
the quarterly be the bad offender in this line 
the table of content a table of contentment but only list story article and the science news department in -PRON- 
leave out the questionnaire reader speak etc 
other publication 
if -PRON- put out so many different book and magazine like the quarterly and science fiction series wonot -PRON- run out of story 
that would be tough 
no 
-PRON- would be good 
then -PRON- could publish a lot of reprint like cumming girl in the golden atom and austin tale 
why donot -PRON- print more of well also 
-PRON- write plenty 
anyhow donot overdo publish science fiction on account of -PRON- reader not be able to keep up with -PRON- 
i would like to see more short story 
by the way why have -PRON- quit use the word scientifiction when -PRON- popularize -PRON- 
be that word copyright 
if -PRON- be -PRON- shouldnot be 
anybody ought to be able to use -PRON- put any article in a fiction magazine unless -PRON- be as good as the problem of space flying

lester anderson hayward california 
the editor be genuinely grieve that mr anderson do not like the cover for the july issue 
most reader who write in thought -PRON- be good 
truthfully -PRON- donot mind -PRON- saying that -PRON- didnot like -PRON- that -PRON- wasnot truthful that -PRON- be too flamboyant 
but to have -PRON- say -PRON- be too commonplace be surprising 
for commonplaceness be what -PRON- be desperately try to escape from 
and if mr anderson be right then -PRON- shall never be again 
-PRON- therefore invite the comment of -PRON- reader to this question 
be the july cover too commonplace 
the word scientifiction be a trade symbol 
the other of mr comment be duly appreciate 
-PRON- be brief sensibly state and sincerely feel

the reader speak continue from page baffle -PRON- friend on science knowledge editor science wonder storie -PRON- apology for not send in -PRON- view sooner but better late than never be -PRON- motto 
i be one of -PRON- young reader 
i wan to say that the magazine be a wonder get -PRON- friend baffle on the superior knowledge of science i have over -PRON- 
now a few criticism and question since -PRON- be less than the good part 
in the feminine metamorphosis the wonderful woman biologist change the woman in shape and countenance -PRON- think that at the same time -PRON- view would change to those of a male 
-PRON- certainly seem logical 
and then again please ask dr keller why detective taine never grow old 
i remember in the last story -PRON- be in the event take a considerable time and at the end -PRON- be very old 
yet here -PRON- be apparently none the bad for the year -PRON- have live 
i didnot like the reign of the ray -PRON- be too dry the moon beast be great 
give -PRON- more of locke 
the alien intelligence be a very good story 
that new author sharp be good donot let -PRON- get away 
-PRON- eternal man be one of the most interesting story read so far even though -PRON- be short 
guess this be enough for some time 
will write next month 
with good wish for a successful magazine sidney rishen brooklyn 
mr question about the woman in the feminine metamorphosis be very well put 
the answer be that sex be determine by two set of characteristic call the psychical and physical 
the psychical be the basic quality of the feminine nature such as mother love vanity capriciousness unstability desire for love and affection etc 
the physical characteristic be the more obvious physical one such as feminine organ size and shape of body coloring and type of skfn tone of voice etc now as -PRON- understand -PRON- what happen be that only the secondary characteristic be change by the biologist 
the primary basic characteristic remain the same 
dr taine be one of those character who suffer a great many adventure 
therefore what happen in the feminine metamorphosis may be simply an incident sandwich in between those mr rishen refer to 
editor 
from a prize winner editor science wonder story i just this evening open -PRON- late copy of science wonder story and -PRON- can imagine what an agreeable surprise -PRON- be to find that -PRON- attempt at an essay have be award first prize for the third month of the contest on what science fiction mean to -PRON- -PRON- be not every day that an individual find that have be unexpectedly dump into -PRON- lap so to speak 
i think that -PRON- be a very agreeable feature of -PRON- contest not to let the author of a prizewinning letter know of -PRON- good fortune until -PRON- have have a chance to find -PRON- out through a casual perusal of the page of the magazine 
the surprise be much more pleasant than if -PRON- have be notify by letter beforehand 
i shall naturally be glad to get the when -PRON- arrive but the most gratifying of all be the fact that -PRON- humble effort be deem worthy of be give the honor of first place in a contest of such a nature and when so many far more intelligent and experience people than i send in -PRON- splendid contribution at the same time 
swiggett jr las vegas new mexico

continue from page terrible editor science wonder story consider the fact i fail to see how i be to congratulate -PRON- upon -PRON- new magazine 
to begin with as i do not see any june issue of the book i donot have any idea whether -PRON- be well or bad than the issue of july and in -PRON- opinion -PRON- would not have far to go to be any bad 
i receive the issue of july and be very glad to do so until i open -PRON- whereupon i be frankly disappointed 
i have not count upon this business of story in two part part or story in two part part and in three place too 
terrible 
under certain circumstance -PRON- be -PRON- be even expect but in the case of the story the reign of the ray i can not see the necessity of divide the story into two part as -PRON- have do the second part of the story be only page long and most certainly could have be put in one installment 
the story the alien intelligence be quite a good story spoil by divide -PRON- into two part although -PRON- may be necessary 
there be some story which be much well if issue in serial form but that depend upon the type of the story 
the moon pool be such a story and a very good one -PRON- be 
as i say before i be frankly disappointed upon not receive -PRON- june issue and upon see the lack of complete story in the july issue 
another thing i do not like be the problem of space flying 
i will admit that i read -PRON- through and find -PRON- worthy of notice in fact -PRON- be worth much study -PRON- be the principle of the thing that interest in like this if i want to for any reason study such -PRON- would not be a hard task to get something on the subject in the library or some such place as that therefore i do not like the idea of buy a book to read for pleasure and relaxation only to be face by some such discourse which remind one of theory or something equally interesting 
the other story seem all right but -PRON- certainly could be well by far 
science news of the month be an excellent feature 
i also enjoy the prize letter contest and congratulate -PRON- upon the excellent choice of first prize 
i always enjoy the reader letter and have discover that many of -PRON- show actual sign of intelligence although i have -PRON- doubt about some of -PRON- 
i for one donot see anything to this picture and biography idea which one of -PRON- suggest neither can i see why -PRON- dislike coblentz because -PRON- be a very good writer 
until lately there be never an issue of -PRON- former magazine that i do not read clear through and for a long time i have one of every issue ever put out and if -PRON- worth -PRON- i intend to do so with science wonder story also 
science wonder story seem to be a pretty good book but -PRON- certainly can be improve upon and i suggest more complete story 
no short serial 
forget the author and -PRON- history 
a more story and well one 
futuristic story and those involve the dimension 
and a lot concern interplanetary travel 
shillito beaver fall pennsylvania 
-PRON- fee wither under mr indictment 
at least that be the first sensation 
but then -PRON- must calmly reread -PRON- letter and analyze -PRON- 
-PRON- fighting spirit be arouse now and -PRON- will defend science wonder story 
but only where -PRON- will bear defence 
if mr shillito be right -PRON- must admit -PRON- 
in the case of the reign of the ray or any other story mr shillito should remember that the size of the book be definitely fix at page 
if therefore -PRON- have run the ten extra page to finish completely the story -PRON- would have be oblige to leave out some other story 
which wouldnot have be fair to -PRON- reader 
-PRON- believe that mr shillito be mistaken about be able to get the problem of space fly easily 
-PRON- bring this book over from germany at a great expense have -PRON- translate here and illustration cut make before -PRON- could assemble -PRON- for publication 
but -PRON- be very much interested in mr criticism and because -PRON- have something to say -PRON- invite -PRON- to write -PRON- again 
editor 
from a lover of astronomy editor science wonder story -PRON- first issue have so affect -PRON- as to cause -PRON- to write and wish -PRON- the good of success in -PRON- new undertaking 
-PRON- be certainly a very fine one and interesting as well 
needless to say i have become a regular reader and booster of -PRON- magazine although i buy -PRON- copy on the newsstand 
i notice that -PRON- have most of the good author with -PRON- and also some new one who seem to know -PRON- science fiction 
now if -PRON- could only induce edgar rice burrough to join up with -PRON- everything would be jake hesitate at all about reprint some classic by jule verne or any of the old master 
-PRON- be always welcome and appreciate 
above all more interplanetary story 
i do not hesitate to say that i be literally fascinate by the study of astronomy 
and -PRON- magazine have do quite a lot to promote that feeling 
i have study astronomy in -PRON- leisure time for several year and have receive a great deal of pleasure and knowledge from -PRON- 
i would be glad to correspond with anyone who be also interested in astronomy be seventeen year old 
i have nothing to say about the science news department except that -PRON- be quite interesting 
i would like to see more astronomical news 
i notice by way of -PRON- advertisement that -PRON- be the publisher of a number of magazine on the different science such as radio and aviation magazine etc well why not add to -PRON- list of publication a magazine base wholly on interplanetary story which may be call interplanetary story magazine 
by this time -PRON- realize that most of -PRON- reader prefer the interplanetary type of story 
i see no reason in not accommodate -PRON- 
i believe that the science of astronomy be more interesting and to -PRON- mind even more important than the science of aviation or radio 
and i donot see why the science of astronomy could not be present by an astronomical fiction magazine 
i be certain that -PRON- would stand upon -PRON- own foot 
and now i would like -PRON- to consider this problem 
most interplanetary author in transport -PRON- character from -PRON- earth to different planet use as a means of traverse the void separate these body space ship 
the author have recognize most of the obstacle and danger stand in the way of space explorer and have eventually explain -PRON- or else have leave -PRON- for the reader to solve 
some of these obstacle be of such a nature as to make -PRON- probable of be solve or overcome in the future 
-PRON- be the nullification of gravity proper amount of velocity on start friction from earth atmosphere travel at speed of light etc now after a great deal of thinking and much discussion over the various obstacle of space travel -PRON- friend and i have come across another obstacle and try as -PRON- may -PRON- could not give any satisfactory explanation to overcome -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- have hear -PRON- before or think of -PRON- but i be vitally interested in get -PRON- solve if possible 
-PRON- know that the air about -PRON- press down upon everything with a weight of approximately pound per square inch 
-PRON- also know that there be a corresponding pressure exert from -PRON- body which quite neutralize the air pressure 
if this pressure be not exert by -PRON- the air pressure would be so great that -PRON- would cave -PRON- body would simply fall in 
the same way about if the air do not exert the pressure that -PRON- do upon -PRON- -PRON- would burst from the pressure exert within -PRON- 
now travel in a space ship -PRON- would have lifegive air within the ship which would press upon the occupant and even the ship with a weight of pound per square inch 
as the space surround the space ship could give back no corresponding pressure to neutralize -PRON- -PRON- stand to reason that the ship would bust from the inside 
which be an example of what -PRON- body would do if -PRON- have no pressure from the air 
-PRON- have conjecture upon -PRON- very much but without success 
what do -PRON- think about -PRON- 
and now i believe i will stop as i have already waste much of -PRON- time if -PRON- have read -PRON- until here 
again i wish -PRON- the good of success in -PRON- undertaking

formerly of schlitz hotel the reader speak from page 
-PRON- can agree with mr fox that astronomy be one of the most fascinating of science and one of which -PRON- still know relatively little 
the possibility of -PRON- vast universe be as limitless as the universe -PRON- and the editor be willing to go on record as say that somewhere in the universe be world in which every conceivable thing within the realm of nature have happen 
regard the pressure on the space flyer mr fox should realize the difference between -PRON- and the human body 
-PRON- body be make of plastic flesh within and over a framework of bone 
fifteen pound per square inch be quite a large pressure for the flesh to endure for -PRON- have little resistance 
but a space flyer would be construct of metal 
boiler in operation now use pressure of steam of and pound per square inch inside whereas outside be only the pressure ot air 
and only recently -PRON- learn of a boiler which will use a pressure of pound per square inch 
so the mere difference of pressure of pound per square inch in space be a trifle to the space flyer 
captain article in this issue bring this point out nicely 
editor 
mr pratt not antisoviet editor science wonder story i note with considerable interest a letter from mr maurice rabinowitz in criticism of the reign of the ray in the august issue of science wonder story 
permit -PRON- to say that i think this criticism be base on a wholly inaccurate view of the story 
-PRON- be not -PRON- intention to express either approval or disapproval of bolshevism or fascism as a matter of fact wo donot think much of either system 
i suppose mr rabinowitz draw -PRON- idea that -PRON- write the story from an point of view from the fact that -PRON- have the united state and italy fighting on the same side against the soviet from the fact that -PRON- say the italian have considerable success and from the method of warfare -PRON- ascribe to bolshevist russia 
now these thing be put into the story not because -PRON- be but as a result of careful and -PRON- hope scientific consideration of the possibility of the case 
to take up the point in order the war as -PRON- outline -PRON- 
nearly all european government as well as -PRON- own have refuse to recognize the soviet and this recognition have be in many case almost insult 
on the other hand -PRON- own government and all those of europe maintain the most cordial relation with facist italy 
-PRON- consider that a war would be far more likely to occur between government which be at enmity than between those which be friendly to each other only cdaimon sense 
moreover the soviet represent a system radically different from any other in europe and if -PRON- ever get into the control of such fanatic as -PRON- have mention for the sake of the story -PRON- be not at all improbable that russia would set out to clean up the world as revolutionary france do in the past 
the italian victory in the story 
italy have a large army -PRON- be by the common judgment of military authority in a high state of efficiency if a war be to come -PRON- be only logical to suppose -PRON- would meet with success 
the soviet method of war 
every war in history go to show that when a country be surround by enemy -PRON- method of warfare take on a frantic and violent character anything to win the german resort to the use of poison gas napoleon levy on conquer province for soldier and provision without pay for -PRON- general sherman burn out georgia and so on 
when a nation be fight for life -PRON- have no scruple at all 
i trust that -PRON- will be able to bring this communication to the attention of the enthusiastic mr rabinowitz and i would like to ask hini whether there be any other point on which -PRON- be hazy

price review briefly a book which be a criticism oi the einstein theory be qnite an impossible task 
what the presentreview can best do be to indicate what the book contain the method of approach and -PRON- value to possible reader 
that mr guggenheimer be equip for -PRON- task no one can doubt 
-PRON- method of analysis be both clear and incisive 
-PRON- rip -PRON- way through theory and abstraction seek for -PRON- logical worth 
in this book -PRON- take the einstein method of approach and proceed to lay bare -PRON- logical fault 
-PRON- find in fact that the chief basis for the special theory of relativity the constancy of the velocity of light irrespective of the speed relation between the source of light and the observer be an hypothesis only 
-PRON- claim that einstein never prove -PRON- or if einstein do prove -PRON- -PRON- come as a corollary to the theory that depend on -PRON- 
like a dog eat -PRON- own tail 
the present reviewer find that mr criticism be sound 
the famous lorentz equation which be the basis of the special theory of relativity be undoubtedly base on something which be take for grant 
mr guggenheimer however become so enamor of -PRON- subject that -PRON- often wander off into -PRON- own abstruse speculation leave the reader far behind -PRON- 
a great deal of concentration and more than an ordinary education be necessary to follow the writer 
the book however be exceedingly wellwritten for a scientific work 
-PRON- suffer however from a lack of cohesiveness 
if mr guggenheimer have give in simple term all that einstein postulate in all -PRON- theory and then proceed to analyze each the reader may have be able to follow -PRON- with a feeling as to where -PRON- be all go to lead 
but while one may agree with the independent conclusion arrive at by mr guggenheimer -PRON- be apt to give up in weariness the attempt to discover what -PRON- be all about by marcus rosenberg page stiff cloth cover 
size publish by dean company new york 
price this be one of the most curious book that the reviewer have have the pleasure of reading 
in -PRON- ponderous style -PRON- be reminiscent of kant and the reasoning be at time as lofty as that of the famous philosopher 
especially the deductive reasoning to explain such mundane thing as a cold or a headache 
-PRON- be a combination of mysticism transcendentalism and empirical medicine 
-PRON- be with a curious sense of futility yet with a linger hope that one turn page after page search for the beginning of what the title promise 
instead the first half of the book be compose of a learn discourse on the fourth dimension the law of conservation of energy and matter and the quantum theory 
in the second part one gather from the index that -PRON- be approach the heart of the subject 
the author treat of cold headache vaccination and the formation of habit 
but gather a few sample of the reasoning use to explain these bodily affliction and the possibility of cure -PRON- 
cold -PRON- say have something to do with the nerve of smell 
when the soul be not aware that -PRON- be in the body respiration take place irregularly and the nerve of smell want to transmit the irregular breathing vibration to the soul 
since the soul be not aware that -PRON- be in the body the nerve of smell have trouble in reach the souk hence the painful sensation know as cold note not cold and sneezing result represent the irregular breathing vibration to which the nerve of smell be subject 
an interesting theory of the nature of heat and light be present in the idea that there be no heat in the ray ofi the sun or any other ray 
the light ray strike an object release intraatomic energy of the object in the form of heat 
therefore -PRON- do not receive heat -PRON- generate by catherine mackenzie page illustrate stiff cloth cover size publish by houghton mifflin company new york 
price this book be an interesting account of the life of the man know to be the inventor of the telephone 
write by one who spend a great many year with -PRON- -PRON- be well document and undoubtedly possess all the fact about life that one would wish to know 
in fact -PRON- possess many more than most reader would wish to know 
miss mackenzie appear to have be smother by the mass of material -PRON- possess and while -PRON- give a surfeit of exact date and fact -PRON- nowhere give a real illuminate insight into the man 
the book have a great deal of interest however for those unable to appreciate the mental attitude that greet announcement of the telephone or speech by telegraph as -PRON- be call 
curiously enough -PRON- learn that bell do not have the equipment of an electrical expert 
-PRON- idea and feeling on the subject come from -PRON- knowledge of sound as apply to speech 
-PRON- be in fact a lifelong expert on elocution and be intensely interested anything that relate to speech 
-PRON- find -PRON- instead of the typical inventor of that day starve in a garret a young enthusiastic man with plenty of friend and enough money to keep the wolf from the door 
-PRON- be say about -PRON- that if -PRON- have know more about electricity -PRON- would never have invent the telephone 
much of the book be take un with the year consume in patent suit direct against -PRON- and by -PRON- 
there be also some interesting material on -PRON- less well know scientific experiment on the graphophone the heavierthanair fly machine and on scientific breeding of animal

price this book by the editor of the journal of the american medical association be part of a onehour series on various topic that the publisher be present 
-PRON- be quite a commonsense collection of the good authority on such subject as exercise diet general living habit digestion sleep and vacation 
dr counsel in all thing be moderation 
that apply to exercise eat healthful thing take cathartic and breathing 
one could hardly quarrel with -PRON- conclusion since -PRON- seem to be found as much on the experience of normal live people as on abstruse medical science 
while -PRON- praise golf as a form of relaxation and exercise for business man -PRON- cite the fact that every year a number of enthusiast drop dead on the link from heart disease 
-PRON- be evidently a case of a good thing overdone 
dr fishbein find no great evidence to support the contention of the vegetarian that -PRON- possibility of life be great than meat eater 
those who eat moderately of meat -PRON- find have just as much chance for long life as the vegetarian 
and -PRON- add dryly meat eater make well company because -PRON- have a sense of humor 
the author treat most food fad contemptuously 
-PRON- find that -PRON- be base principally on the desire of some commercial interest to exploit a particular food 
the raisin fad be one 
a warfare between the eat white bread and do not eat white bread interest now rage 
but what dr fishbein do not and evidently can not state be that these fad be base on the authority of medical man who conveniently make discovery 
but -PRON- find the american public constipated and gullible 
-PRON- will accept anything as a panacea except right living 
-PRON- be too busy for that 
so the doctor conclude bluntly what fool these mortal be
