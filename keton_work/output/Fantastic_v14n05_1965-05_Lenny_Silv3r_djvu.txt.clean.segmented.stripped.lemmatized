-PRON- could never erase from -PRON- memory the evil face of the child of horror the loathsome thing that wait in by dark secret have drive laurence cullum to the edge of nervous hysteria what unutterable obligation have force -PRON- to cry out for succor like an agonize madman 
these and other question relevant to the desperate condition of the master of cullum house perplex doctor nathan buttrick as -PRON- cluck -PRON- team homeward through penaubsket bridge on the fringe of sabbathday in northern new england 
in other circumstance -PRON- may have be doze lull by the cry of the nighthawk aloft and the peace of an upland twilight 
but now although -PRON- body crave sleep -PRON- mind be vitally awake 
doctor buttrick be baffle by the peculiar malady which make each day a live horror for cullum 
all the sedative of the pharmacoepia have fail to quell the anxiety which gnaw at the mind of -PRON- patient 
in -PRON- frustration at the failure of the tablet and injection the physician have even resort to folk remedy whisper by blackgummed grandmother in the hill back from the sea 
infusion of tea and henbane petal of amarylli hold under the tongue -PRON- have try all the highcountry nostrum which once -PRON- hold in professional scorn 
-PRON- be as futile in calm cullum as the most advanced drug the age could offer 
as the feeble light of sabbathday come into view around the granite mass of gallowglass hill buttrick review once again the particular of the case 
laurence cullum age afflict with a cerebral aneurism a soft patch in a brain artery which may burst tomorrow in five year or never 
-PRON- be the last of the cullum line a prominent family begin by draper cullum the leader of the expedition which strike northward from dunstable to find on an august sunday the protect harbor on the north atlantic around which would grow the seacoast town of sabbathday 
the cullum have always be influential in the town yet oddly retire 
laurence be the most hermitic of the lot 
since the death of -PRON- sister emma and the diagnosis of -PRON- aneurism -PRON- have shut -PRON- up in the gray new england gothic mansion at the end of windham road 
-PRON- control hand be still feel on many of the town business affair but this be merely the ghost of the man 
-PRON- physical presence be sequester behind the grotesque archway of cullum house two enormous jawbone of a sperm whale erect during the tenancy of the last patriarch captain hugh 
these fact and the few pleasantry that buttrick have exchange with cullum during the man infrequent visit to town be all that the doctor know of the cullum heir before treatment for the aneurism begin 
except for the grim scene on the night of death two year before 
the physician have be in attendance accompany by cullum and most of the household staff 
buttrick would never forget the last word of emma speak as -PRON- clutch -PRON- brother arm in a whiteknuckled hand 
laurence -PRON- will keep the guardianship i shall -PRON- dear cullum reply as a mad trap look appear in -PRON- eye 
then the life of the frail spinster eke out -PRON- last heartbeat and usefulness have end doctor hear nothing of a laurence cullum for a year and a half after -PRON- sister demise 
then come the midnight telephone call 
buttrick roll groggily from -PRON- bed expect a summon to the side of any one of three wife who be await childbirth 
instead -PRON- be shock into full awareness by an almost hysterical voice beg -PRON- to administer relief 
although year of medical practice have somewhat jade -PRON- sensibility to human pain buttrick hear a voice so fill with a frantic tension that the listener -PRON- become afraid in an unconscious resonance with the plead tone 
-PRON- whip -PRON- team across the surly penaubsket river and along windham road guide only by the chill light of a threequarter moon 
at the end of the headlong ride -PRON- find cullum in a state of extreme anxiety within the mouldering drawing room of the mansion 
the earpiece of the telephone be still off -PRON- hook as the man cower in a great wing chair whimper like an injured child in shocking contrast to the manliness of -PRON- sixfoot frame 
although -PRON- be wrap in a dressing gown trouser cuff bear trace of dry mud 
buttrick quickly administer the standard dosage of a sedative 
-PRON- have no effect 
a second injection calm cullum or rather remove the physical manifestation of -PRON- hysteria 
but even as the drug subdue -PRON- trembling cullum retain a spark of horror in -PRON- eye 
repeatedly buttrick question the sufferer about the cause of -PRON- alarming discomposure 
and each time the gauntface cullum have burrow deeper into the plush of the wing chair mumbling under the sedation say mustnot say 
no one must ever know 
the guardianship 
despite -PRON- the physician feel a grow fear at the recurrence of that ominous term first uttered in -PRON- hearing by the die lip of emma culum 
at last the opiate calm the man chaotic nerve 
with the aid of amadee an aged acadian manservant the doctor wrestle the drugged weight onto a settee near the fire 
-PRON- leave a vial of tablet with the servant and the assurance that -PRON- would visit -PRON- master on the next day 
then buttrick return to town exhaust physically but unable to quell the incessant questioning of -PRON- curiosity 
what event or obsession could explain the mental disintegration of cullum 
what arcane significance have that curious term mutter by laurence even in -PRON- narcotic stupor during the month of treatment which follow the first nighttime summon the doctor have learn little else about the trouble at cullum house 
-PRON- have diagnose the aneurism but be certain that -PRON- patient extreme nervousness and loss of weight be by no mean relate to -PRON- physical affliction 
rather there be some obligation burden perhaps something in the house -PRON- under whose presence the mind of the cullum heir be slowly crumble 
besides the strange term speak by both emma and laurence there be one other fact which increase the peculiarity of the case 
buttrick have notice that cullum always avoid approach a large tapestry hang in the drawing room another remnant of the patriarchy of captain hugh 
the subject and rendition be unsettling at first glance a highly realistic depiction of a witch sabbath 
the naked body of cabalistic woman be ruddy in the glow from a fire which also illumine a bleed victim 
after a few visit buttrick have inure -PRON- to the grisly scene 
but cullum would never pass within five foot of the cloth 
sometimes the doctor have the uncomfortable conviction that -PRON- patient be listen to the tapestry as though hear the whickering laughter of the coven 
gradually buttrick resign -PRON- to the frustration of try to quell a malady of the spirit by chemical mean 
a difficult task at good 
with such a secretive uncooperative patient -PRON- be almost an impossibility 
such be the reflection of the toilworn leech of sabbathday as -PRON- rein -PRON- team before the weather frame bungalow from which -PRON- father have practice before -PRON- 
after stable the horse -PRON- eat a light supper then willingly give -PRON- to -PRON- mattress with a sighed hope that no major illness or accident would befall the populace of the village that night 
-PRON- last conscious thought be not a prayer to -PRON- creator but a mindless repetition of the eldritch phrase so full of puzzlement and in tone a taint of evil the guardianship late afternoon of the follow day buttrick stand beneath the whale jaw archway of cullum house marvelling at the curve bone monolith of this strike manifestation of the familys eccentricity 
-PRON- be one of the two day of the week on which cullum be treat both for -PRON- aneurism and for the frenzy attack -PRON- nerve 
amadee be wait behind the door 
-PRON- usher the doctor into the dank coolness of the mansion 
once inside the entryway the aged acadian draw close to buttrick and seize -PRON- elbow in a surprisingly strong grip a liberty -PRON- have never before take le docteur -PRON- say hoarsely do not be surprise if the master -PRON- tell to -PRON- some strange thing today there be a smile on the seam lip but the coldness of eye remove all trace of amiability from -PRON- manner 
-PRON- be some time now that the master -PRON- have be say strange thing that -PRON- should not believe la maladie -PRON- be the sickness nothing more buttrick be repel by the servant familiarity 
during -PRON- visit to the house -PRON- have find amadee a strange figure give to eavesdropping impassively as cullum make pitiful attempt at conversation with -PRON- physician 
for some inexplicable reason the presence of the acadian always put buttrick on -PRON- guard as though the stoop valet carry with -PRON- a hint of evil 
certainly the man add to the forebode gloom of cullum house 
buttrick pry -PRON- arm out of grip and strode quickly into the drawing room 
as be -PRON- habit cullum be seat as far away from the tapestry as be physically possible 
-PRON- rise unsteadily as the doctor enter the room 
so so good of -PRON- to come nathan -PRON- say 
although -PRON- mind be on the verge of splinter into a thousand shard of madness automatically the heir preserve the vestige of a courtesy reserve for calm spirit 
buttrick place -PRON- bag on a richly damaske ottoman inspect -PRON- patient appearance with a quick professional glance 
-PRON- be appal by decline since the last visit 
the man be wrap in a crimson sittingrobe that seem make for a large frame so grievously have -PRON- body waste under the bearing of -PRON- mental burden 
the eye be preternatu rally bright staring from dark socket 
cullum nervously pluck at the cord of the gown with a hand which shock buttrick by -PRON- resemblance to blanched and with yellowed nail 
the doctor have see patient harbor within -PRON- vile malignancy fall into such decay 
but dissolution be the result of a mental cancer which threaten to destroy both mind and body 
-PRON- be moot which soul or flesh would perish first 
now the man seem inflame by a strange eagerness 
-PRON- motion buttrick to close -PRON- bag and clear -PRON- throat nervously fear nathan that i have not be the good of patient 
all -PRON- medication all -PRON- attention useless 
-PRON- dismiss -PRON- with a wave of -PRON- blueveine hand 
nothing will relieve -PRON- 
nothing can ease the weight of this hideous charge i labor under cullum stop briefly and seem to listen to the tapestry 
recover -PRON- train of thought -PRON- continue 
unless unless i somehow ease -PRON- mind of this guardianship -PRON- spit the word out in mingled tone of fear and loathing 
unless i tell the secret i shall die and the secret shall die with -PRON- 
and if i tell the secret the secret shall die and i shall die with -PRON- 
almost a conundrum eh buttrick 
a true gnomic riddle eh -PRON- friend -PRON- physician rise to steady cullum for -PRON- speech be assume the peculiar cadence of madness 
the man rally mumble not yet not yet 
in a moment -PRON- face take on a grave cast as -PRON- speak in cooler more ominous tone 
-PRON- must have suspect nathan that the cause of -PRON- agony be exceedingly strange 
the aneurism -PRON- tap -PRON- temple -PRON- be nothing 
-PRON- cullum have suffer more unusual malady than that 
-PRON- trouble lie deep than the fragile flesh 
the heir pause reflectively then continue 
i have stand -PRON- as long as i could endure under this hideous burden longer than i think possible 
i be not as strong as emma be 
not so much of a cullum perhaps 
-PRON- be like -PRON- father captain hugh amazingly strongwille 
the secret of -PRON- family horror i know no other name for -PRON- be safe with -PRON- while -PRON- live 
but i two year man two year of ceaseless anxiety 
and the last few month have be a wake terror buttrick have be engross by narration 
but suddenly -PRON- start 
a sound a muffled moan or cry have issue from the direction of the cabalistic tapestry 
cullum see the doctor apprehensive glance 
not yet -PRON- friend 
later -PRON- shall know all 
for now nathan hear -PRON- out 
-PRON- flick -PRON- hand at amadee who be loiter in the door of the drawingroom 
that will be all amadee 
go to -PRON- duty 
the acadian shuffled reluctantly into the bowel of the house 
when -PRON- footstep no longer sound off the flake wall of the passage cullum resume -PRON- monologue 
-PRON- be now time nathan that -PRON- know the wellkept secret of this house for i shall tell -PRON- or die in the attempt 
only by share this intolerable weight have i any chance of keep -PRON- sanity 
-PRON- lip tremble as -PRON- fight to maintain calmness 
-PRON- be nnot easy to disburden onesself of such knowledge but i must despite the warning or i shall most surely go mad 
be patient nathan and let -PRON- tell -PRON- in -PRON- own way 
buttrick settle uneasily into a sofa 
for a moment -PRON- feel a sudden impulse to deny cullum the opportunity to tell -PRON- tale 
why should -PRON- nathan buttrick participate in this secret 
-PRON- precinct be the body not the diseased mind 
with -PRON- austere inhabitant and wild setting between the forest waste and the sullen north atlantic sabbathday be eerie enough without compound -PRON- by a knowledge of the secret of cullum house 
but gradually professional instinct exert -PRON- 
if cullum do not gain some mental relief either the torment -PRON- undergo would render -PRON- mad or -PRON- aneurism would burst under the strain 
the doctor settle back and accept a dark sherry from -PRON- patient tremble hand 
nathan say cullum have -PRON- ever hear the name ligea be the second wife i believe of -PRON- father captain hugh answer buttrick 
yes if -PRON- can be call a wife 
immediately buttrick know the reason for bitter statement 
the doctor have be only a child when ligea come to sabbathday yet the bizarre tale the townspeople tell about -PRON- be preserve in -PRON- memory 
after the death of -PRON- first wife the mother of laurence and emma captain hugh cullum have consign -PRON- child to the care of a relative 
-PRON- then embark on -PRON- last voyage as master of the steamer ogunquit to the baltic port of riga 
when -PRON- return to sabbathday almost two year later -PRON- bring with -PRON- the numerous spoil of yankee trading and a mistress for cullum house the dark ligea rotesque rumor about this woman soon spring up amidst the villager 
perhaps some originate in the mouth of goodwife who envy -PRON- exotic charm 
for ligea be oddly beautiful a tall woman with a luminous eastern complexion sinuous in -PRON- movement heavily accent in -PRON- speech most distinctive feature be -PRON- long raven hair of a black deeper than the northern forest night 
whatever -PRON- origin the story about ligea soon be the common coin of conversation around the hearth of sabbathday 
-PRON- be say that -PRON- have bring the nighthawk to cullum house 
before -PRON- come these nocturnal flyer have soar only over the backland far from town 
now -PRON- roost in the tree of the estate tremble the night air with the beat of wing 
more serious some report that ligea have be see on walpurgis night wanton naked through the wood at the fringe of town 
one individual who have be abroad at that hour swear that a glowing cloud have pass in from the sea over sabbathday and that voice could be hear mumble in strange tongue from within the float mass 
an ancient dame who dwelt alone near gallowglass hill aver that ligea have spend many afternoon with the few indian sachem still alive the degenerate remainder of the pequot tribe 
this nearlyextinct race -PRON- be say hold power over air and sea 
the more intelligent of the townsfolk dismiss these tale as fantasy 
yet all know that ligea exert a strange hold on captain hugh 
the gruff skipper be quite deferential to -PRON- in public a far cry from -PRON- callous treatment of -PRON- first wife 
there be some who even notice more than a touch of fear in -PRON- attitude toward the tall woman whom -PRON- bear on -PRON- arm 
however in -PRON- public behavior the woman be impeccable haughty of mien knowledgeable in the social grace distant yet polite 
during the couple visit to town -PRON- comport -PRON- as befit the wife of a monie landowner 
only a few note that occasionally -PRON- exchange know glance with the most depraved of the town moral outcast 
a year after -PRON- arrival in sabbathday ligea be big with child 
at this time hugh cullum cease -PRON- frequent visit to town and seem to enter retirement at the end of windham road 
the village believe that -PRON- have seclude -PRON- in deference to -PRON- wifes condition 
not a soul understand that behind the captain bluff facade lie a spirit sorely harry by some knowledge which -PRON- could impart to no other person 
several day after -PRON- confinement be due to end the news reach sabbathday that both ligea and -PRON- babe have perish in childbed 
the father of nathan buttrick have be in attendance 
in answer to the many query -PRON- reply that there be nothing -PRON- could have do and divulge no other detail of the tragedy 
nathan recall that -PRON- father have be unusually silent for day after the event as though meditate on some incomprehensible problem 
once -PRON- have tell -PRON- son that if -PRON- aspire to be a physician there be something about the cullum that -PRON- should know in the future 
but then the normal course of town life be resume 
the remain of ligea be cremate and transport to -PRON- native land as -PRON- have wish 
the small casket of the child take -PRON- place among the cullum ancestor in the family crspt 
and nathan buttrick never hear the cullum secret from the lip of -PRON- father for the man die of a heart seizure a few month later 
-PRON- be a witch damn -PRON- eye cry cullum 
the heir have become noticeably less calm toward the end of narration of the few fact -PRON- know of ligea 
now a torrent of suppression emotion break forth 
and -PRON- be not dead do -PRON- hear 
not dead leapt to restrain cullum who seem ready to run from the room 
at the same moment a hideous clamor issue from the direction of the tapestry a scarcely human screeching accompany by thud impact as though a body be hurl -PRON- at the wall 
-PRON- hear -PRON- hear raved cullum 
-PRON- swing around and face the cloth 
-PRON- can not hold -PRON- in bondage any long 
the guardianship be at an end 
at last an end 
-PRON- final word choke off in a sob 
cullum pitch into a faint on the settee 
the vicious sound from the tapestry grow in intensity until the cloth and the wall behind -PRON- tremble 
amadee enter the room on the run -PRON- feature contort with rage 
apparently -PRON- have overhear the entire scene 
the weak pig -PRON- snarl -PRON- have doom -PRON- all -PRON- be dead man dead man 
-PRON- vanish down the hall -PRON- footstep give way to the grind of a heavy door be swing on -PRON- hinge 
in a few moment buttrick hear the crack of a bullwhip over the horrid ululation 
a note of pain enter the scream 
-PRON- taper off into piteous whimper until silence return to cullum house 
buttrick knelt beside the heir struggle to revive -PRON- 
for a moment -PRON- fear the aneurism have burst 
but the eyelid tremble and slowly the man regain -PRON- sense 
ah the relief nathan cullum sigh 
no longer a prisoner in -PRON- own house 
no longer keeper of the vile heritage emma pass on to -PRON- 
great god laurence cry buttrick what have -PRON- hide behind that wall could not describe -PRON- -PRON- answer 
walk to the tapestry 
-PRON- shall see -PRON- for -PRON- 
buttrick move unsteadily toward the rich cloth -PRON- breathing suspend in anticipation of whatever be to occur 
open the tapestry with the cord by -PRON- hand direct callum 
the doctor grasp the weighted end of the cord 
-PRON- close -PRON- eye for a moment open -PRON- then tug at the cord 
the tapestry slide back smoothly across the wall 
beneath -PRON- the wall be discolor but blank except for a small glass orifice at eye level 
buttrick hesitate 
-PRON- glance at laurence who feebly motion to -PRON- from the settee then fix -PRON- eye to the peephole 
a low moan escape the physician lip as -PRON- hand come up to clutch -PRON- throat 
the orifice give a view through the thick wall into a small chamber behind the drawing room 
immediately opposite be a heavy steel door with a similar peephole and a sturdy grating at the bottom through which a man may crawl be -PRON- open 
gnaw bone and a basin of water lie before the grill which be apparently an opening for insert food into the chamber 
a grayish light emanate from tiny clerestory window along two side beneath the ceiling 
knot of threadlike filament black brown and yellow litter the floor 
crouch in the far corner be the tenant of this chamber a spectre so inhuman that vision momentarily blur from the shock 
-PRON- hulk pant on -PRON- hand a live human torso if such a distortion of man form can be designate thusly 
raven hair fall in hank and tangle from a misshapen skull 
bright feverish eye glare out from beneath the shaggy brow 
from the face project only a rudimentary nose -PRON- nostril dilating as an animal would breathe 
the lip be tense in a snarl reveal discolored tooth more like the fang of a carnivore -PRON- thing be naked save for a ragged breechclout tie about -PRON- middle 
the torso show superhuman muscular development arm as thick as fencepost a barrel chest partly cover by a pelt 
the low extremity be piteously wither drag behind the upper body 
yet that monstrous form carry -PRON- to and fro in the chamber with remarkable agility support -PRON- weight on the arm and talonlike hand 
as -PRON- lunge from one corner to the other the creature sound an ominous murmur from deep within -PRON- dark breast 
oh -PRON- dear god whisper buttrick unbelieve before the grisly sight 
-PRON- have see man mangle by awful accident in the log camp and even the pitiable distortion of infant body in stillbirth 
but never have the physician entire consciousness writhe before such a gross malformation of the human body 
-PRON- slump weakly against the wall beside the peephole 
what be -PRON- laurence -PRON- ask 
where where do -PRON- come from 
now -PRON- realize the desperate burden i have carry these month nathan reply cullum 
that thing have be in -PRON- charge since the death of -PRON- father second wife 
-PRON- be hellchild as -PRON- watch reaction to the spectacle behind the tapestry a transformation overcame cullum 
-PRON- seem more in control of -PRON- as though the sharing of the secret with another not in the blood line have relieve a great pressure within -PRON- spirit 
see revulsion cullum have the presence of mind to fill another glass from the squat ship decanter and offer the stimulant to the doctor who have move slowly away from the wall like a sleepwalker 
sit down nathan and calm -PRON- order the heir sure -PRON- must have many question about -PRON- bad seed 
when buttrick have compose -PRON- cullum speak volubly about the origin of the chamberdweller 
the doctor listen as -PRON- host tell -PRON- of die threat to the house of cullum 
unless -PRON- maintain -PRON- infant in secrecy until -PRON- maturity -PRON- would perish 
the guardianship as -PRON- call -PRON- must be pass from member to member 
only death could release a guardian who be responsible for the care and nourishment of the creature 
-PRON- would know ligea say when the child no longer need -PRON- protection 
captain hugh cullum have always scoff at superstition and curse 
but suddenly the occult have come under -PRON- own eave in the presence of that incredible child surround by a brooding evil even then in -PRON- infancy 
-PRON- know that -PRON- have not father such a monster 
gradually the conviction grow within -PRON- mind that ligea have consort with a spirit of darkness and that the babe be the token of -PRON- devilish love 
captain hugh would allow the child no baptism 
-PRON- be place in the strongroom behind the main parlor a chamber which the guardian come to call sardonically the crib 
from that time forward the tenant of that dark room behind the tapestry be know as the hellchild 
and so nathan if word be true then -PRON- be listen to a dead man 
the guardian who betray the secret must die -PRON- know 
superstitious nonsense cry buttrick who have recover from -PRON- initial shock 
why look at -PRON- man more relaxed than see -PRON- in month 
now laurence i canot yet explain that thing in theie or why -PRON- survive so long despite -PRON- grave malformation 
but -PRON- must have a natural explanation 
i admit that at first i be shock a hideous thing 
yet i can see nothing that -PRON- should fear in -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- can arrange for an institution to take over -PRON- care relieve -PRON- of the burden 
as to -PRON- be a hellchild really laurence expect this type of think more of an upland farmer than the cullum heir 
that be because -PRON- do not fully understand the terrible threat of the creature cry cullum 
-PRON- must be destroy nathan before -PRON- can commit more of -PRON- evil just begin i tell -PRON- uttrick put out -PRON- hand to steady cullum who be become agitate again 
what evil what be -PRON- talk about laurence

oldham have be find lie in a foot of stagnant water near a fireroad through mohegan swamp 
buttrick have sign the deathcertificate of the aged muskrat trapper 
the body have be badly mutilate and a look of utter horror be indelibly stamp on the face 
-PRON- donot mean that ask buttrick point toward the wall

-PRON- break out -PRON- say helplessly 
-PRON- have underestimate -PRON- strength and -PRON- burst through the wooden door which the steel door -PRON- see later replace 
amadee and i follow -PRON- as quickly as -PRON- could 
-PRON- be dark 
the spring rain have muddy the ground voice become dreamy as -PRON- relive the gruesome event 
at first amadee and i didnot know where to look 
-PRON- stand in the drive -PRON- with the bullwhip and -PRON- carry the lantern 
-PRON- could have go off in any direction 
but then then -PRON- hear the nighthawk cry over mohegan swamp in the valley behind the estate 
a terrible fierce sound laurence 
-PRON- be swarm and dive as though mad 
-PRON- run through the forest on the fireroad 
the sound of the bird get louder more shrill until -PRON- could see against the gray sky the place over which -PRON- be swarm 
i remember wish that i have have the presence of mind to bring a pistol 
but then the light from the lantern show -PRON- -PRON- form ahead 
oh nathan oldham have come down to check -PRON- trap and -PRON- catch -PRON- there in the mud and scummy water 
when -PRON- run up -PRON- be feed amadee lash -PRON- with the whip and -PRON- draw back 
i see that -PRON- could do nothing for oldham 
the expression on -PRON- face terrible 
between the two of -PRON- -PRON- drive the creature back to the house and into the crib 
-PRON- be more docile then fear the bite of the whip more than now 
cullum pause and wet -PRON- lip with the sherry 
but the atrocity so unsettle -PRON- that i have to call -PRON- for relief or i would have lose -PRON- mind 
-PRON- should have recognize this murderous act as an unmistakeable sign that -PRON- be approach -PRON- maturity nathan 
but -PRON- think the killing of oldham be an accident a chance encounter 
no more than a month later arnold -PRON- groundskeeper pass away 
-PRON- be the last of the servant save amadee 
at night the beast break out again 
i be awaken by the nighthawk mass over the house 
the coffin lie within the parlor 
that thing have overturn -PRON- and be tear slash cullum clench -PRON- fist in agony 
do -PRON- understand what be live with nathan 
do -PRON- wonder that -PRON- nerve be go stir uncomfortably 
-PRON- be be draw into the macabre web of narration 
the doctor begin to feel unsafe sit only a few yard away from the tapestry 
how many time have -PRON- enter the decay drawingroom to treat the master of cullum house oblivious to the existence of a horror separate from -PRON- by only a few inch of plaster and lath 
-PRON- then know continue cullum that -PRON- ghastly appetite have be whet 
-PRON- realize that these event be not mere chance 
the evil thing mother by -PRON- father second wife i can not call -PRON- -PRON- stepmother have reach -PRON- maturity 
for a week after -PRON- inter arnold -PRON- scream 
i shall hear -PRON- cry until -PRON- ear be stop by death 
ravenous ferocious howl which sound even beyond the wall of the house 
amadee and -PRON- bullwhip could not control -PRON- 
i stuff -PRON- ear with cotton take laudanum drink -PRON- into unconsciousness everything fail 
that hideous keening could not be suppress 
-PRON- be then at the end of -PRON- wit that i make the decision for which if ever a man be damn i shall be 
i have to stop the scream nathan do -PRON- understand that 
buttrick shake -PRON- head slowly scarce dare to consider what awful revelation -PRON- would hear next order amadee ah even now i can not bring -PRON- to pronounce the word 
cullum fight visibly to control -PRON- rise emotion 
-PRON- spring from the settee and pace the room 
amadee in addition to be -PRON- only servant be also -PRON- blurt the word out 
custodian of the sabbathday burial ground 
do -PRON- understand -PRON- meaning 
then the bone in the chamber and those fiber hank of hair 
buttrick ask incredulously 
how many evening have i slump in that very chair listen to that beast at -PRON- unholy supper how often have i consider suicide anything to free -PRON- of this vile guardianship 
even amadee have become infect by -PRON- i truly believe -PRON- enjoy tend the creature and discipline -PRON- with -PRON- bullwhip 
-PRON- derive a sense of power from those duty 
the old man think -PRON- weak and scorn -PRON- because -PRON- nerve can not stand the strain 
but what a burden god help -PRON- i be the protector of a a long silence follow the impassioned confession 
the room have become oppressively thickatmosphere 
buttrick open the french door which lead to a terrace and thence the drive 
the sky be yet aglow and only the drone of frog at mohegan swamp herald the approach of night 
the bird roost in the tree about the house have not yet begin -PRON- darkle flight 
the doctor turn and address cullum 
be there any danger that -PRON- will break out again laurence 
the steel door have thus far resist -PRON- attempt -PRON- reply 
occasionally -PRON- hurl -PRON- self at the door for an hour at a time 
-PRON- ferocity be appal 
but the door and -PRON- frame remain fast 
the heir sigh deeply 
yet a mere steel door can not be sufficient to hold such a malignant evil 
-PRON- must be destroy nathan and quickly 
i can no longer protect the town from -PRON- appetite 
and now that i have discover the cullum secret to -PRON- i feel that if -PRON- do not act soon the thing will be at large with no one to stop -PRON- 
for -PRON- hear -PRON- betray -PRON- i be sure and crave -PRON- death 
buttrick be convince 
now -PRON- mind no longer operate in accord with the civilized virtue of reason and mercy 
-PRON- own experience that day at cullum house and -PRON- host desperate word have bring to life within -PRON- the savage fear of the unknown 
-PRON- agree to assist in the extermination of the cieature and swear that no word of the proceeding would ever pass -PRON- lip 
since cullum assure -PRON- that -PRON- could spend another night in the house with the hellchild buttrick decide to return to sabbathday 
on the morrow -PRON- would return to the estate to plan the destruction and interment of the beast for -PRON- would need daylight to dig -PRON- unholy rest place 
on the portico of the mansion beneath the arch jawbone cullum seize hand in a firm grip only wish -PRON- father have take this course in the beginning -PRON- say 
then perhaps -PRON- emma and -PRON- would have be spare the blight which have sap -PRON- life 
-PRON- run -PRON- hand along the cool ivory of the curve white monolith know that wherever -PRON- be -PRON- father approve the action -PRON- must take 
buttrick nod in silent agreement 
-PRON- bid the heir a good night and turn -PRON- team onto the darkness of windham road 
as -PRON- leave the ground of the estate the nighthawk be begin -PRON- evening clamor 
-PRON- rasp cry banish the peace of the autumn evening 
a fter -PRON- return to the bungalow the doctor lie sleepless distract by vivid mental phantasm of what -PRON- have hear and witness that evening 
each time -PRON- close -PRON- eye the scene in the crib flash across the screen of -PRON- conscious mind in all -PRON- loathsome detail 
-PRON- could not erase from -PRON- memory the glowering countenance of the hellchild a face so evil -PRON- seem impossible that flesh and bone could be torture into receive the stamp of such malignancy 
buttrick could well understand why captain hugh have disclaim parentage of the child 
and now buttrick -PRON- have be draw into the cullum horror 
-PRON- have swear to aid in the destruction of a thing which may still bear within -PRON- a spark of humanity despite heated denial and the mystery of -PRON- parentage 
vicious instinctively homicidal yes but be this enough -PRON- ask -PRON- enough cause to betray a great oath that one which bind nathan buttrick to use -PRON- skill only for the preservation of life -PRON- be a quandary and the man writhe under the weight of -PRON- contradictory obligation 
the doctor have thus lie staring at the slowly rise patch of moonlight on -PRON- wall for three hour when the telephone beside -PRON- bed rang 
with a sudden clairvoyance buttrick know that this be no ordinary call summon -PRON- to the sickbed of a villager 
-PRON- swing out of the bed and snatch the earpiece from the hook 
the voice of laurence cullum din in -PRON- ear 
nathan come quickly man 
-PRON- canot hold -PRON- break out of the crib over voice come the sound of splinter wood and a ravening ululation such as never spring from human throat 
the telephone crash to the floor as buttrick leapt to struggle into -PRON- clothe 
-PRON- vault across the yard to the barn scarce feel the bite of the early hoarfrost 
with frantic speed -PRON- harness the team and urge -PRON- out of -PRON- warm quarter into the chill darkness of the road where the moon hardly penetrate the roof of overhang tree 
five minute after the call the wildeyed horse lunge through the shadow of penaubsket bridge onto the gravel of windham road 
although the doctor be a good master to -PRON- animal now -PRON- whip -PRON- cruelly 
-PRON- call the two mare by name hurling imprecation foreign to -PRON- lip in an effort to gain more speed 
black masse of maple and oak lash by -PRON- sharp twigend strike blood from face when the surrey veer too close to the road edge 
twice -PRON- seem that all horse surrey and driver must surely fall to perdition so headlong be -PRON- flight in round curve where granite outcropping change the road direction 
if a goodman of the town have be abroad at that hour -PRON- would have cross -PRON- in utter terror at the approach of the fly team and whipman 
-PRON- seem an age to buttrick but at last the light of cullum house glimmer through the thicket ahead 
at the stone pillar which mark the entrance to the estate the horse shy nearly throw the doctor from -PRON- seat 
the whip crack once twice but -PRON- would not enter 
the team stand ready to bolt in the face of a terror which -PRON- sense could detect even at that far remove 
buttrick leapt down from the surrey and make for the house afoot 
the rain of early autumn have wash innumerable gully into the clay of the drive 
several time -PRON- stumble almost twist an ankle beneath -PRON- 
over the sound of -PRON- labored breathing come a confusion of highpitche cry 
the nighthawk be swarm above the house in a dense cloud 
-PRON- mass eclipse the light of the moon as -PRON- climb to an apogee plummet suicidally toward the ground then arc upwards 
all about -PRON- the doctor hear the beat of -PRON- wing 
near the great house buttrick see that the french door which -PRON- have open in another world -PRON- seem be still ajar 
the parlor within be light 
sob from -PRON- exertion -PRON- lurch onto the terrace and lean against the door frame 
laurence -PRON- cry 
laurence where be -PRON- the doctor gaze slowly sweep the room 
the ottoman on which -PRON- have set -PRON- bag that afternoon lie on -PRON- side the stufling expose through a long rent in the fabric 
on the far wall the tapestry hang in fold from one of -PRON- corner 
beneath the discolored area of the wall frame a gape hole partially obstruct with shard of plaster and fanglike lath 
by main force the captive behind that wall have claw and butt -PRON- way out of the crib 
buttrick step into the room aghast at the wreckage of the oncesumptuous chamber 
from behind an overturn sofa a moan break the stillness more like a sigh than an expression of pain 
cullum lie crumple against the wall hurl there by the inhuman force of the thing as -PRON- rush from -PRON- confinement 
laurence 
be -PRON- all right man cry the physician 
there be a deep gash on brow 
see see to amadee 
in the hall 
i afraid -PRON- catch -PRON- nathan 
buttrick find the acadian halfway down the hallway which lead to the steel door of the crib 
the hellchild have seize -PRON- at -PRON- middle and dash -PRON- fatally against the floor 
beside the dead servant lie the bullwhip a puny weapon against a force of such unutterable malevolence 
the doctor return quickly to attend cullum 
the shock of the event could prove dangerous to the aneurism 
the weak spot of the brain artery may rupture from the slight stress 
but the heir indicate dazedly that -PRON- be unharmed except for the head wound 
-PRON- go outside whisper cullum could hear -PRON- scrabble about on the portico before -PRON- come 
thank god -PRON- stop scream 
i could not bear that sound another minute 
be there any firearm in the house ask buttrick 
only an ancient pistol which fail -PRON- 
cullum point to an old handgun lie at the middle of the floor try to fire at -PRON- as -PRON- come through the wall but the mechanism be rusty from age 
the beast flick -PRON- off like a doll and go for amadee perhaps because -PRON- take so much pleasure in whip -PRON- 
but -PRON- will return to finish -PRON- nathan because -PRON- have now mature and need -PRON- guardian no longer 
cullum smile weakly as a wistful expression fix -PRON- upon -PRON- pallid face 
if death be the price of freedom from that child of the pit then i shall pay -PRON- gladly -PRON- say uttrick suddenly stiffen 
somewhere beyond the open door of the entryway -PRON- hear the sound of deep animal respiration 
a growl loose -PRON- from a savage throat must close and bar those door the doctor mutter to -PRON- for cullum have lapse into an almost trancelike state 
-PRON- grasp a heavy poker and walk carefully through the hall 
if -PRON- come at -PRON- -PRON- think must slash at the eye 
the eye 
the main door of the house stand throw open to the night 
although -PRON- now ride the treetop the moon illumine the step up which buttrick would have race have -PRON- not enter through the french door 
the cry of the ominous bird have cease 
-PRON- roost in the elm and oak as though await a climactic event 
the doctor peer out onto the lawn keep well within the shadow of the entryway 
nothing stir 
-PRON- step into the doorframe and quickly scan right and leave 
again there be only the wash of moonlight on the lawn and longdeserted walk 
no sound be audible except an occasional chirrup from the tree 
buttrick exhale slowly 
-PRON- seem that the thing have run off perhaps to mohegan swamp where -PRON- have claim -PRON- first victim 
this be work for a search party in the morning not for a middleage physician unarm except for a poker 
wipe -PRON- brow against -PRON- sleeve buttrick step onto the portico beneath the massive jawbone 
the moon catch the whiteness of the eccentric archway 
-PRON- run -PRON- palm along the ivory smoothness grateful for a touch of cool solidity 
stand there for a moment the man seem to gain strength from the contact of -PRON- hand with the curve pillar of bone 
on the step of the mansion -PRON- take a final surveying glance over the ground unwilling to stray farther from the light 
all be quiet 
-PRON- will run the beast to earth in the bog come sunup -PRON- think 
surely -PRON- can not escape -PRON- there 
suddenly the tree at the edge of the estate sway at -PRON- top as the nighthawk again wing aloft 
the doctor calmness leave -PRON- 
-PRON- start up the step to regain the relative security of the house 
but as -PRON- mount the last step -PRON- eye catch a dark mass hulking at the very top of the arch where the whalebone intersect 
at the same moment a guttural cry which seem to tremble the entire portico peal down at -PRON- head snap up 
on the peak of the arch balance on -PRON- clawlike hand crouch the hellchild 
-PRON- long snarl hair cascade down over the joint where the top of the bone be clamp together 
the fantastically develop shoulder and arm muscle knot as the creature prepare to hurl -PRON- downward upon buttrick 
in the splitsecond -PRON- take -PRON- arm to bring the poker up -PRON- realize that the thing have expect -PRON- to enter through the main door when -PRON- arrive in answer to call for help 
-PRON- have climb to the top of the arch hide there by the shadow of the eave in order to fall upon -PRON- as -PRON- enter the house 
then all thought cease for nathan buttrick as -PRON- see the macabre figure let go the top of the arch and launch -PRON- at -PRON- with a bellow -PRON- poker flash sideways in a vicious arc aim at the point in space where the eye should have be at that moment 
but -PRON- smite the empty air 
for as buttrick begin -PRON- stroke the long raven hair of the beast catch in the ironwork which brace the top of hugh arch 
the momentum of -PRON- lunge carry the hellchild clear of the ivory column 
-PRON- plummet downward for the mere frac24 tion of a heartbeat then a terrible jerk cease -PRON- plunge 
-PRON- swing between the column like a grotesque marionette hang by -PRON- own matted hair 
the doctor could not breathe as -PRON- gape at the frantic contortion of the creature 
the cruel arm flail and beat the air as -PRON- struggle to haul -PRON- back to the top of the arch 
from that brutish throat come a scream of incredible fury 
the face grimace from pain and rage 
fleck of foam spot the snarl lip 
for a moment -PRON- seem that the hair surely must part unable to support such a weight 
but then a report like a muffled gunshot still the writhing of that hideous form 
-PRON- neck break the hellchild hang limply above the step of the house -PRON- have terrorize through the long decade 
unstrung by the terrible selfexecution -PRON- have witness 
buttrick fall to -PRON- knee on the floor of the portico 
for minute -PRON- sag there -PRON- finger still grip the haft of the useless poker 
the trembling which shake -PRON- entire frame gradually subside 
suddenly remember the wound heir who lie inside -PRON- rouse -PRON- and enter the house 
cullum be sit as before prop against the wall 
-PRON- face be ashen but -PRON- eye glimmer with surprise as buttrick knelt beside -PRON- 
-PRON- -PRON- be alive nathan -PRON- whisper 
do the beast still live 
the doctor quickly relate the grisly death of the hellchild 
-PRON- be apparent to -PRON- that -PRON- friend be fall into a decline from which -PRON- would never recover 
the aneurism have be fatally disturb by the night event 
then i be afree cry cullum 
at long last free of that terrible presence 
ah liberty 
bless bless liberty the voice of the heir trail off in a final sob 
buttrick gently place a pillow beneath the still head and close the eye 
the master of cullum house the last guardian of the hellchild be dead a long time the physician stand in the shamble of the parlor try to fathom some meaning in what -PRON- have experience 
two corpse lie in that silent mansion 
beneath the whalejaw archway hang the carcass of the familys child of darkness claim by this architectural whim of -PRON- first guardian 
the grim sequence of event be too unsettling to comprehend 
but now -PRON- be time for action 
impel by some allegiance which endure even the death of the last cullum the doctor resolve never to divulge the horror in which -PRON- have participate 
crawl into the crib through the break wall -PRON- clean the chamber of all trace of the occupancy 
on the portico -PRON- cut down the monstrous body and load -PRON- onto the surrey 
buttrick inch the surrey down the dark fire road to mohegan swamp 
in a desolate reach of the bog -PRON- inter the remain of the vicious life which have bring cullum house to ruin 
only then do -PRON- call the sabbathday constable 
the account which that officer receive be deliberately intend to excite no undue curiosity 
as buttrick tell -PRON- -PRON- have receive a nighttime call from the heir request medication for -PRON- condition 
near the end of -PRON- conversation the line abruptly go dead 
upon -PRON- arrival at the house -PRON- find that apparently a burglar of considerable strength have slay amadee 
cullum have be strike once as the single gash on -PRON- brow testify 
the blow have fatally aggravate -PRON- aneurism 
foil by the steel door of the strongroom behind the parlor the thief and murderer have break through the wall into the chamber 
but -PRON- find no treasure for the room have not be use for year 
no person in sabbathday not even the investigate constable question the veracity of the doctor explanation 
nathan buttrick hide within -PRON- the memory of that ghastly night at cullum house until death ease -PRON- of the woeful burden 
now resident of the village rarely speak of the cullum tragedy 
since there be no heir the great house revert to windham county and be raze for -PRON- timber 
in the town cemetery the cullum family crypt be seal forever and the sabbathday burial ground be a place of peace embrace on all side by the northern forest 
but in mohegan swamp the nighthawk disturb the twilight calm 
-PRON- have inhabit the lowland since the pull down of cullum house 
at sundown while the main flock wheel and cry over the brackish water a few nightflier roost atop a curious mound near the shoulder of a fireroad through the swamp 
each year the mound grow somewhat high 
the forest warden who first notice the growth believe -PRON- to be merely a subterranean tangle of live willow root send out by the tree which overhang the bog 
yet the bird who frequent the hillock utter strange fervid cry as if urge on the evolution of something within the peculiar pile 
-PRON- be unlikely that the mound will stir the curiosity of the townsfolk 
whatever phenomenon be at work will reach completion undisturbed the end by long leg short leg voice tape throat voice tape childish prob lem problem always problem even in the wellrun world of moderan 
i be on a july monday that little sister be under -PRON- window very early with a big box in -PRON- arm 
the vapor cover that day be pink as indeed -PRON- would be for all of july as set by the central vapor shield control and the vapor light save people 
the temperature be control to a pleasant degree inside and outside and -PRON- as usual be work on a formula 
-PRON- little playmate come -PRON- shout -PRON- little sister

-PRON- come today in the mail 
-PRON- rub -PRON- eye with the back of -PRON- goldseal hand 
-PRON- try to think across the metal field 
a man of advanced time -PRON- have submit to many ironx and a few goldseal replacement since come up from olderun in a move toward durability in a move to conquer imnaortality for the corporeal self 
but sometimes this metal self that be fast become -PRON- main self dominate the flesh strip to such an extent that -PRON- find -PRON- difficult to force thought to track the petty path of everyday 
across the pathless field of the high dimension -PRON- be a keen hot hound on the scent of formulae 
with what be leave of -PRON- family little sister -PRON- sometimes find -PRON- hard go even to converse on plain term 
tell -PRON- slowly -PRON- plead 
-PRON- take a deep breath 
-PRON- good full chest swell in a triumph of flesh and bone 
-PRON- brown eye be sparklebright when -PRON- say mustnot grow up alone even if i be the last little girl 
as i await the age of replacement i must have a companion which same just come in the mail 
daddy 
and -PRON- will put -PRON- together 
daddy so -PRON- can play 
i have name -PRON- already little slot 
slot be a box full of slotted metal a few wire some power wafer many tape a head various curve piece of white plastic certain part that be almost flesh and the print sheet of direction 
slot be a pile of junk and a headache confront a man dedicated to solitude eternity and calm companionless think on universal deep problem 
slot as -PRON- be unassemble have cost five hundred thousand dollar cash by gift certificate from the organization for the entertainment of little flesh people 
there be a clatter in -PRON- joint of metal scrape on metal and the wincing of the fiesh strip as -PRON- kneel to one knee there on the gray bare yard and take up the box that contain slot 
-PRON- open the box and see a waxwarm face smirk up at -PRON- an enigmatic face that could have be a nine year old girl face or a much old girl face make of plastic and wreathe in real hair 
the mechanical mouth tumble open and beautifully form white tooth gleam out of the rubbery lip bite -PRON- big foot off if -PRON- arenot good to -PRON- the beautiful fliilatious head threaten right away mechanically and pleasantly enough 
then a clamor start up change the tape change the tape jump like a bucket full of the sun have just come highboile down through all those mile through all the pink vapor shield to spill on a jot of -PRON- flesh 
when -PRON- jump piece of slot and the box in which -PRON- have be mail scatter fanwise across the gray yard 
but the head sit smile in the middle of the scatter piece have a tape for the situation 
butterfingery old cold widower and a halfwit moron girl -PRON- say 
then -PRON- spend about five minute bounce up and down on the plastic yard sheet and scream shame shame foul foul save -PRON- save -PRON- 
after that the head very businesslike roll about pick up -PRON- part and slot everything together until a pleasingly tall and slim fair girl of metal and white plastic stand smile in the cool rose glow ef the pink vapor shield of july 
well and where s the bog -PRON- say as -PRON- deftly stoop to tear out the white nylowov line of the box in which -PRON- have be mail 
-PRON- wrap the long piece of snowy cloth about -PRON- in such a way that -PRON- be tastefully full and loose in place and taut across other place to enhance -PRON- fine plastic curve 
always pay to please the bog -PRON- say 
the bog say little sister bewilder and still somewhat daze by the performance -PRON- have just see 
what do -PRON- mean bog 
the oggosite rex 
like the meg for the wogen 
damn faulty tape -PRON- say make a sour face 
then -PRON- say with a throaty voice and a new clear tape mean where be the boy 
the opposite sex 
like the man for the woman a girl -PRON- smile to be -PRON- little playmate until ready for replacement say little sister simply and with a heart full of love for the warm metal and plastic thing tower over -PRON- get ever so many cardwov cutout dolly 
-PRON- can have one 
and two change of clothe for -PRON- 
today 
little face shone beatific from the beautiful gesture and the openhearted strain of such hard giving 
and let -PRON- color a little with -PRON- ray spray if -PRON- will promise cross -PRON- heart not to bust -PRON- 
slot be coldly eye little sister distaste and boredom and pity amusement in every stare 
aw go grow up -PRON- say gritty voice with the tape for the occasion here to play with -PRON- dad 
i think 
little sister be near to tear 
but father eager as ever -PRON- think to get the silly diversion over with get little sister back to -PRON- place and -PRON- in -PRON- hipsnuggie chair for more formula thinking have be scientifically and purposefully read the direction after -PRON- have recover from the initial shock of hear slot talk and see -PRON- put -PRON- together 
-PRON- remember that the first of these doll be at least ten year old now and the idea for -PRON- be much much old and all this help -PRON- regain -PRON- confidence in the allrightness of thing 
when -PRON- come to the part of the instruction -PRON- just slip over quickly catch slot firmly by an arm take the long section out of -PRON- leg and proceed to secure -PRON- rangechange to the place calibrate -PRON- ship -PRON- from -PRON- factory on the direction state the calibration of wide versatility and great demand 
but -PRON- function quite as well on if wire to -PRON- securely after first be relieve of the long section of the leg 
and slot down to little sister size now be busily rewinde -PRON- dress to make up for -PRON- new status in stature 
then -PRON- say a little dully -PRON- seem with the tape for the occasion go play cutout 
and really love to use -PRON- rayspray color thing if i may little sister and little slot go off across the gray plastic yard toward little red hut and father with the long section of leg tuck firmly under one arm hasten fast as -PRON- could back to -PRON- hipsnuggie chair and -PRON- big desk for thinking 
but just as -PRON- fear may be the case -PRON- find that -PRON- be not now think clean on universal deep problem -PRON- have this other problem now that would have to be solve before -PRON- could get -PRON- heart out of the bump and jump and back to universal coolgear smoothness 
oh why do these thing have to happen 
why couldnot little sister have just behave with mox -PRON- iron man instead of order this silly doll playmate 
but father like the dogged fighter -PRON- have always be do not dodge the issue -PRON- get right to grip with the problem even if -PRON- heart be not yet quite as smooth and reliable as -PRON- should have be 
then too -PRON- have to work with a mind that be really not much good now at pertinent fleshtype question but -PRON- would decide

someone have do a good job use deep hypnotic no doubt of bury -PRON- recollection under a layer of false memory 
still -PRON- hadnot do as well as -PRON- think -PRON- have take -PRON- only a few hour to throw off the nebulous impression of a dubious past 
perhaps i turn hurry back to the house 
gunvor be hesitate over a plate of freshbake pastry -PRON- duck something under -PRON- apron as i step into the room

but tell -PRON- be there a i grope for a word i didnot want to alarm -PRON- by ask for a brain doctor and -PRON- wouldnot understand psychiatrist hypnotist 
i wait for sign of comprehension 
someone who talk to troubled people soothe -PRON- ah ye mean a mesmerist 
but there s none here in the village alas only mother goodwill -PRON- add doubtfully 
mother goodwill 
i prompt nothing against -PRON- mind ye sir but there s those that talk of witchcraft 
and i be read just the other day in the paris match that ye can develop serious neurosis by let unqualified practitioner meddle with yer psyche so right gunvor i agree

-PRON- cottage be very plain and the old woman -PRON- be something less than a credit to -PRON- village 
dowdy -PRON- be sir no sense of style at all 
and as for clothe wonot be overly critical gunvor 
will -PRON- take -PRON- to -PRON- summon -PRON- here sir if yere determined but there s a licensed master mesmerist in eale just an hour by coach mother goodwill will do i think 
how soon can -PRON- get -PRON- here send ingalill but if -PRON- all the same to ye sir let -PRON- have -PRON- up after dinner just pop -PRON- goose in and the pie be brown even now after dinner will be fine take a few more turn around the garden and develop an appetite worthy of -PRON- cooking 
a fter a second slab of blackberry pie bury in cream too thick to pour a final mug of coffee and with a healthy snort of brandy with the flavor of a century in a dark cellar safely under -PRON- belt i light up a new orlean cigar and watch as hilda and gunvor light the oil lamp in the sitting room 
there be a timid tap at the door and ingalill the kitchen slavey poke -PRON- face in 
the old witch be here -PRON- pipe

i think -PRON- got ground up salamander innard in -PRON- hear ye ye wretch hilda say 
tell -PRON- to wait until -PRON- better summon -PRON- ingalill yelp and jump aside and a bentbacke ancient in a poke bonnet push in past -PRON- one gnarl hand grip a crooked stick on which -PRON- lean 
bright black eye dart about the room light on -PRON-

i didnot see a pipe but as i watch -PRON- snort a last wisp of smoke from -PRON- nostril 
who have need of mother healing touch -PRON- quaver 
but of course -PRON- would be -PRON- sir who have come such a strange long way and with a stranger longer path still ahead phooie i tell -PRON- -PRON- be the new gentleman ingalill say in the basket -PRON- reach to lift a corner of the red and white checked cloth cover the container yelp as the stick crack across -PRON- knuckle 
mind yer manner dearie mother goodwill say sweetly 
-PRON- shuffle to a chair sink down put the basket on the floor at -PRON- foot 
now mother goodwill gunvor say sound agitated 
the gentleman only want a little help with draw aside the veil of the past the future to read more clearly the crone pipe 
ah -PRON- do well to call on old mother gee 
now -PRON- tone become more brisk 
if yell pour -PRON- a dram gunvor to restore -PRON- strength a mite and then yell all have to clear out except mlord the new gentleman o course 
-PRON- grin at -PRON- like a meateating bird not interested in the future i start be ye not sir the old woman nod as though agree 
then -PRON- a strange mortal ye be but there be some thing i need to remember i bore on ignore the sale pitch 
maybe under light hypnosis i can so then -PRON- the past yed glimpse as i think -PRON- comment imperturbably 
gunvor be click glass at the sideboard 
-PRON- come over and hand the old woman a glass then get busy clearing dish from the table with ingalill and hilda work silently beside -PRON- 
mother goodwill smack -PRON- lip over the brandy then wave an oversized brownspotte hand 
away with ye now -PRON- chick -PRON- quaver feel the spirit come over -PRON- 
the power flow in the celestial field39 coil 
strange vision be stir like phantom viper in a pot this this 
ai curious indeed the thing the spirit whisper to -PRON- now hummp 
ye can skip the spirit routine hilda say 
all mr bayard want from ye get along with ye girl the old woman snap or send a cramp that will lock yere knee together that tight the fair swain this side o not unlock -PRON- all of ye off now hey go 
then the hag turn to -PRON- 
now down to business sir -PRON- use a wheedling tone 
what be ye think of give the old woman for a handful of lose recollection 
be -PRON- a lover yeve forget the rapture of youth the key to happiness once glimpse and now forever go aglimmere i be grin at -PRON- be well pay but let skip the rest of the routine get straight to the point i have reason to believe suffer from induced amnesia probably the result of posthypnotic suggestion like -PRON- to put -PRON- under and see if -PRON- counter the block 
mother goodwill lean forward look at -PRON- keenly a strangeness about ye something i canot put -PRON- finger on -PRON- as though yer eye be focusse on a horizon that other man canot see grant a strange character 
but not so strange -PRON- canot hypnotize or mesmerize -PRON- i hope 
ye say yeve be tamper with yer memory take from ye do a thing like that to ye lad and why maybe if -PRON- be successful find out 
-PRON- nod briskly hear of such thing spell of darkness cast by the light of a bloodre moon mother i cut in get one thing straight every time -PRON- mention spell magic dark power or grease the fee go down interested in straight scientific mesmerism 
what good sir would ye tell the mistress of darkness how to ply -PRON- trade 
the routine be begin to get tiresome 
maybe -PRON- would better forget the whole thing 
i reach in -PRON- pocket for a coin 
-PRON- mistake 
be ye say mother a fraud then -PRON- voice have take on a suspiciously mild note 
i look at -PRON- catch a glint of light from an eye as black and bright as a polished opal think the old woman out to trick ye to play ye false to gull ye fer a new fledged chick to -PRON- voice drone on come from far away now boom like surf in a seacave echo echo ten 
-PRON- eye snap open 
a woman with a pale almost beautiful face sit lean pensively on one elbow a cigarette in -PRON- hand watch -PRON- 
-PRON- dark hair be do up in a tight bun -PRON- plain white blouse be open at the collar show a strong graceful neck 
there be one dark curl against -PRON- forehead 
i look around the room -PRON- be dark outside now a clock be tick loudly somewhere 
what happen to the old beldame 
i blurt 
the woman smile faintly wave a wellmanicured hand toward a black cape on the chair beside -PRON- a gnarl stick lean again -PRON- 
rather warm for work in 
how be -PRON- feel 
i consider 
fine 
but i catch a glimpse of a wisp of stringy grey hair under the edge of the cloak 
i get out of -PRON- chair go over and lift -PRON- there be a warty rubber mask a pair of gnarly glove the idea of the getup find -PRON- helpful in -PRON- business 
now -PRON- fool -PRON- in a bad light i say take -PRON- gunvor and the other be in on the gag -PRON- shake -PRON- head 
no one ever see -PRON- in a good light mr bayard and no one wish to approach too close even then simple people here about in -PRON- thought wart and wisdom go together so i sedk to fit -PRON- image of a village mesmerist else none would seek -PRON- skill the only one who share -PRON- little secret 
why -PRON- 
-PRON- look at -PRON- searchingly 
-PRON- be a most unusual man mr bayard 
a true man of mystery 
-PRON- talk to -PRON- of many thing 
strange thing 
thing at which the mind reel 
-PRON- speak of other world like this -PRON- own familiar plane but different alien 
-PRON- talk of man like animal clothe in shaggy hair dzok 
i burst out 
-PRON- hand go to -PRON- head as though to squeeze the recollection from -PRON- brain like toothpaste from a tube 
the hagroon and calmly calmly mr bayard the woman soothe 
-PRON- memory if true memory -PRON- be and not feverfancie be there intact ready to be recall 
rest now 
-PRON- be not easy for either of -PRON- this strip away of veil from -PRON- mind 
a master mesmerist indeed be -PRON- who seek to bury -PRON- vision of strange paradise and unthinkable hell but all lie expose now 
i look at -PRON- and -PRON- smile be no journeyman practitioner -PRON- -PRON- murmur 
but all -PRON- skill be challenge this night 
-PRON- rise go to a frame mirror on the wall gracefully tuck back a strand of hair 
i watch -PRON- without see -PRON- thought of barbro the flaming figure in the dark storeroom the escape with dzok from the hagroon cell be jostle each other clamoring to be remember think about evaluated 
mother goodwill pluck -PRON- cape from the chair swirl -PRON- about -PRON- shoulder hunch into the posture of the hag -PRON- have be 
-PRON- white hand slip the mask in place fit -PRON- to -PRON- nose and mouth 
the glove and wig followed and now the bright eye gaze at -PRON- from the wrinkled face of age 
rest sir the ancient face cackle 
rest sleep dream and let those restless thought seek out and know -PRON- familiar place once again attend ye on the morrow there s more that mother goodwill would learn of the universe yeve tell -PRON- lurk beyond the threshold of the drab world 
wait i say havenot pay -PRON- 
-PRON- wave a veined hand pay -PRON- well in the stuff vision be work on sir 
sleep i say and awake refresh strong with -PRON- wit keen to razor edge 
for yell be need all yer strength to face what wait ye in the day yet undawne 
-PRON- go out then i go along the hall to -PRON- dark room throw -PRON- clothe on a chair fall into the feathermattresse bed and sink down into troubled dream be three day before i feel strong enough to pay -PRON- call on mother goodwill 
-PRON- cottage be a thatchroofed rectangle of weather whitewash almost lose under a tangle of wristsized rise vine heavy with deep red blossom 
i squeeze through a rust gate pick -PRON- way along a path overhung with untrimmed rhododendron lift the huge brass knocker clank -PRON- against the low black oak door 
through the one small manypane window i catch a glimpse of the corner of a table a pot of forgetmenot a thick leatherbound book 
there be a humming of bee in the air a scent of flower and a whiff of freshbrewed coffee 
certainly not the traditional setting for call on a witch i think 
the door open 
mother goodwill look neat in a white shirt and peasant skirt favor -PRON- with a sad smile motion -PRON- in 
no halloween costume today i comment feel well mr bayard -PRON- say drily 
will -PRON- have a mug of coffee 
or isnot -PRON- customary in -PRON- native land 
i shoot -PRON- a sharp look 
skeptical already 
-PRON- shoulder lift and drop believe what -PRON- sense tell -PRON- 
sometimes -PRON- seem to contradict each the other 
i take a chair at the table glance around the small room 
-PRON- be scrupulously clean and tidy furnish with the kind of rustic authenticity that would have have the lady of the back home oohing and ahing and overwork the word quaint 
mother goodwill bring the pot over pour two cup put cream and sugar on the table then sit 
well mr bayard be -PRON- mind clear this morning -PRON- remembrance well restore i nod try the coffee 
-PRON- be good -PRON- have some other name i could call -PRON- 
i ask 
mother goodwill go with the fright wig and the wart 
-PRON- may call -PRON- olyvia 
-PRON- have slim white hand and on one finger a fine green stone twinkle 
-PRON- sip -PRON- coffee and look at -PRON- as though make up -PRON- mind to tell -PRON- something 
-PRON- be go to ask -PRON- a question i prompt -PRON- 
after answer -PRON- maybe -PRON- will clear up a few matter for -PRON- 
many be the wonder -PRON- babble of in -PRON- delerium -PRON- say 
i hear a tiny clatter glance at -PRON- cup a fine tremor be rattle -PRON- against the saucer 
-PRON- put -PRON- down quickly duck -PRON- hand out of sight 
oft have i sense that there be more to existence than this -PRON- wave a hand to take in everything 
in dream glimpse enchanted hill and -PRON- heart yearn out to -PRON- and wake with the pain of something beautiful and lose that haunt -PRON- long after 
i think in -PRON- wild talk there be that which make a certain hope spring up again a hope long forget with the other hope of youth 
now tell -PRON- strange that talk of other world like each to other as newstruck silver piece yet each with a tiny diffeience and of a strange coach with the power to fly from one to the next all this be fancy eh the raving of a mind sore vexed with meddle true olywia i cut in know -PRON- hard to grasp at first i seem to recall i be a bit difficult to convince once accustomed to think -PRON- know everything there s a powerful tendency to disbelieve anything that doesnot fit the preconception 
-PRON- speak of trouble brion -PRON- speak -PRON- name easily familiarly i suppose share someone innermost thought tend to relax formality 
i didnot mind olyvia without -PRON- disguise be a charming woman in spite of -PRON- severe hairdo and prison pallor 
with a little sunshine and just a touch of makeup i pull -PRON- back to the subject at hand listen attentively as i tell -PRON- the whole story from strange interrogation to -PRON- sentencing by the xonijeelian 
so stuck i finish 
without a shuttle trap here for the rest of -PRON- day 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head be strange thing brion thing i should not believe so wild and fantastic be -PRON- 
and yet i do believe 
from what little learn of this worldline -PRON- backward technologically why be a very modern people olyvia say defensively 
-PRON- have steam power the ship on the atlantic run make the crossing in nine day and there be the balloon the telegraph and telephone -PRON- modern coalburning road car which be begin to replace the horse in many part of the colony even sure i know olyvia no offense intend just say that in some area be ahead of -PRON- 
the imperium have the drive -PRON- own native world have nuclear power jet aircraft radar and a primitive space program 
here -PRON- have go in other direction 
the point be strand here exile -PRON- to a continuum i can never escape from 
be -PRON- so ill then brion 
-PRON- have a whole world here before -PRON- and now that the artificial barrier have be cleanse from -PRON- mind -PRON- will freely recall these wonder -PRON- leave behind 
-PRON- be speak eagerly now excited at the prospect 
-PRON- speak of aircraft build one how marvelous to fly in the sky like a bird 
-PRON- come here could mean the dawn of a new age of glory for the empire i say ungraciously great 
but what about world 
by now the hagroon have probably launch -PRON- attack and maybe succeed with -PRON- 
-PRON- wife may be wear chain now instead of pearl 
i get up stamp over to the window and stare out 
while i rot here in this backwater world 
brion -PRON- say softly behind -PRON- 
-PRON- find -PRON- troubled not so much by the threat to -PRON- beloved friend as by the quality of remoteness these matter have take on i turn 
what do -PRON- mean remote 
barbro -PRON- friend in the hand of these apeman those who tamper with -PRON- mind brion seek to erase these thing from -PRON- memory 
true -PRON- skill avail to lift the curse but tis no wonder that -PRON- seem to -PRON- now as old memory a tale tell long ago 
and i -PRON- give a command to -PRON- while yet -PRON- sleep that the pain of loss be ease the pain of loss be damn 
if i hadnot be fool enough to trust dzok poor brion 
know -PRON- not yet -PRON- be -PRON- who gull -PRON- while -PRON- sleep plant the desire to go with -PRON- to xonijeel 
yet -PRON- do -PRON- good for -PRON- or so -PRON- memory tell could have take the shuttle back i say flatly 
at least have be there to help fight -PRON- off 
and yet the wise one the monkeyman of xonijeel tell that this world do not exist crazy 
i take a turn up and down the room too much here i donot understand olyvia like a man wander in the dark banging into thing that -PRON- canot quite get -PRON- hand on 
and now i raise -PRON- hand and let -PRON- fall suddenly inexpressibly weary 
-PRON- have -PRON- life still ahead brion 
-PRON- will make a new place for -PRON- here 
accept that which can not be change back and sit down 
a olyvia i havenot ask gunvor and the other many question i didnot want to arouse curiosity by -PRON- ignorance 
the indoctrination dzok and -PRON- boy give -PRON- didnot cover much just enough to get -PRON- start 
i suppose -PRON- figure get to a library and brief -PRON- 
tell -PRON- something about this world fill -PRON- in on -PRON- history to start with 
-PRON- laugh an unexpectedly merry sound 
how charming brion to be call upon to describe this humdrum old world as though -PRON- be a dreamer fancy a mighthavebeen instead of dull reality 
i manage a sour smile always a little dull to whoever involve in -PRON- 
where shall i begin 
with ancient rome 
the middle age 
the first thing to do be establish a common history date the point at which -PRON- world history diverge from mine 
-PRON- mention the empire 
what empire 
when be -PRON- found 
why the empire of france of course olyvia blink then shake -PRON- head 
but then nothing be of course -PRON- say speak of the empire estabblishe by bonaparte in so far so good i say 
-PRON- have a bonaparte too 
but -PRON- em45 pire didnot last long 
-PRON- abdicate and be send off to elba in yes but -PRON- escape return to france and lead -PRON- army to glorious victory i be shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- be free for a hundred day until the british defeat -PRON- at waterloo 
-PRON- be send to st helena and die a few year later 
olyvia stare at -PRON- 
how strange how eerie and how strange 
the emperor napoleon rule in splendor at paris for twentythree year after -PRON- great victory at brussel and die in at nice 
-PRON- be succeed by -PRON- son loui the duke of reichstadt 
no the duke die in -PRON- youth of consumption 
louis be a boy of sixteen the son of the emperor and the princess of denmark 
and -PRON- empire still exist i muse 
after the abdication of the english tyrant george the british isle be permit to enter the empire as a special ward of the emperor 
after the unification of europe enlightenment be bring to the asian and african today -PRON- be semiautonomous province administer from paris but with -PRON- own local house of deputy empower to deal with internal matter 
as for new france or louisiana this talk of rebellion will soon die down a royal commission have be send to look into the complaint against the viceroy think -PRON- have get the date pretty well pin down i say and -PRON- look as though there s be no significant scientific or technological progress since -PRON- prompt question which i answer at length 
olyvia be an intelligent and welleducated woman -PRON- be enthral by -PRON- picture of a world without the giant shadow of bonaparte dominate -PRON- 
the morning have develop into the drowsy warmth of noon by the time i finish 
olyvia offer -PRON- lunch and i accept 
while -PRON- busy -PRON- at the woodburning stove i sit by the window sip a stone mug of brown beer look out at this curious anachronistic landscape of till field a blacktoppe road along which a horse pull a rubbertire carriage the white and red dot of farmhouse across the valley 
there be an air of peace and plenty that make -PRON- oddly distant recollection of the threat to the imperium seem as olyvia say like a half forget story read long ago like something in the book lie on the table 
i pick up the fat red leather bind volume glance at the title by lyman baum funny i say 
olyvia glance over at the book in -PRON- hand smile almost shyly 
strange reading matter for a witch -PRON- think 
but on these fancy -PRON- own dream sometimes love to dwell brion 
as i tell -PRON- this one narrow world seem not enough not that olyvia but -PRON- have pretty well establish that -PRON- date be early in the nineteenth century but baum wasnot bear until about or so nearly half a century later 
but here -PRON- be i flip the book open note the publisher wiley cotton new york new orlean and paris and the date -PRON- know this book in -PRON- own strange world 
olyvia ask 
i shake -PRON- head 
in -PRON- world -PRON- never write this one i be admire a frontispiece by denslow show a figure face a group of gnome 
the next page have an elaborate initial at the top follow by the word summon -PRON- here say sorana the sorceress to tell -PRON- -PRON- be -PRON- favorite book as a child olyvia say 
but if -PRON- know -PRON- not how then do -PRON- recognize the author name 
-PRON- write other 
the wizard of oz be the first book i ever read all the way through 
the wizard of oz 
not the sorceress 
how enchant -PRON- would be to read -PRON- be this the only one -PRON- write sadly yes 
-PRON- die the following year that could mean i trail off 
the fog that have be hang over -PRON- mind for the day since i have awaken here be rapidly dissipate in the brisk wind of a sudden realization dzok and -PRON- friend have relocate -PRON- complete with phony memory to replace the one -PRON- would try to erase in a worldline as close as possible to -PRON- own be clever thorough and humane but not quite as clever as -PRON- think a bit less thorough in -PRON- research than -PRON- should have be and altogether too humane 
i remember the photodiagram the councillor have show -PRON- and the glowing point unknown to imperial net cartographer which represent a fourth undiscovered world lie within the blight 
i have think at the time that -PRON- be an error along with the other great error that have omit the zerozero line of the imperium but -PRON- have be no mistake 
four exist a world with a common history date far more recent than the 15th century the date of the close line beyond the blight 
and i be there or here in a world where in at least one man know in -PRON- own world have exist 
and if one why not another or two other maxoni and cocini inventor of the drive mean what brion voice jar -PRON- back to the present 
nothing 
just a thought 
i put the book down suppose -PRON- only natural that even fifty year after a major divergence not everything would have be affect 
some of the same people would be bear 
brion olyvia look at -PRON- across the room wonot ask -PRON- to trust -PRON- but let -PRON- help -PRON- 
help -PRON- with what 
i try to recapture the casual expression be wear up until a moment before but i could feel -PRON- freeze on -PRON- face like a mud pack 
-PRON- have make a plan i sense -PRON- 
alone -PRON- can not succeed 
there be too much that be strange to -PRON- here too many pitfall to betray -PRON- 
let -PRON- lend -PRON- what help i can 
why should -PRON- want to help -PRON- if i be plan something 
-PRON- look at -PRON- for a minute without answer -PRON- dark eye wide in -PRON- pale classic face spend -PRON- life in search for a key to some other world some dreamworld of -PRON- mind 
somehow -PRON- seem to be a link brion 
even if i can never go there -PRON- would please -PRON- to know help someone to reach the unattainable shore all world just like this one olyvia 
some better some worse some much much bad all make up of people and earth and building the same old natural law the same old human nature 
-PRON- canot find -PRON- dreamworld by pack up and move on -PRON- have get to build -PRON- where -PRON- be 
and yet i see the ignorance the corruption the social and moral decay the lie the cheat the treachery of those who hold the trust of the innocent sure and until -PRON- have evolve a human society to match -PRON- human intelligence those thing will exist 
but give -PRON- time olyvia -PRON- have only be experiment with culture for a few thousand year 
a few thousand more will make a lot of difference 
-PRON- laugh 
-PRON- speak as though an age be but a moment 
compare with the time -PRON- take -PRON- to evolve from an amoeba to an ape or even from the first homo sapien to the first tilled field -PRON- a moment 
but donot give up -PRON- dream -PRON- be the force that carry -PRON- on toward whatever -PRON- ultimate goal be let -PRON- lend that dream concrete reality 
let -PRON- help -PRON- brion 
the story -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- have fall ill from overwork as an otficial of the imperial colonial office that -PRON- be here for a rest cure tis as thin as a parisian nightdress 
and brion -PRON- lower -PRON- voice be watch 
watch 
by who a little man with a beard and dark glass tis no j brion i see a man last night lurk by the gate at house and half an hour since a man well muffle up in scarf pass in the road yonder as -PRON- sup coffee 
that doesnot prove anything 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head impatiently 
-PRON- plan to fly i know that 
i know also that -PRON- visit to -PRON- will arouse the curiosity of those who prison -PRON- here prison -PRON- 
why as free as a bird -PRON- waste time brion -PRON- cut -PRON- off 
what deed -PRON- commit or why i know not but in a contest between -PRON- and drab officialdom support -PRON- cause 
now quickly brion 
where will -PRON- go 
how will -PRON- travel what plan will hold on olyvia jump to conclusion and jump -PRON- must if -PRON- would evade the hound of the hunter 
i sense danger close about -PRON- as a snare about the roebuck neck tell -PRON- olyvia i be exile here by the xonijeelian council -PRON- didnot believe -PRON- story or pretend not to 
-PRON- dump -PRON- here to be rid of -PRON- -PRON- fancy -PRON- as humane -PRON- know 
if -PRON- would mean to kill -PRON- -PRON- have every opportunity to do so -PRON- seek to mesmerize -PRON- knowledge of the past away now -PRON- watch -PRON- result to judge 
and when -PRON- see -PRON- restive familiar of a witch no witch as such all know -PRON- here 
twa an ill gambit that bring -PRON- here by daylight brion if creep out at midnight -PRON- would have see -PRON- anyway if -PRON- be watch -PRON- as -PRON- seem to think and -PRON- would have know damn well i wasnot satisfy with -PRON- handpainted picture of -PRON- past 
at any case -PRON- will like -PRON- not come again take -PRON- away and once again essay to numb -PRON- knowledge of the world and of -PRON- past 
i think that over 
-PRON- may at that i say donot suppose -PRON- be any part of -PRON- relocation program to have -PRON- spread technical knowledge among the primitive 
where will -PRON- go brion 
i hesitate but what the hell olyvia be right i have to have help 
and if -PRON- intend to betray -PRON- -PRON- have plenty on -PRON- already 
rome i say 
-PRON- nod 
very well 
how be the state of -PRON- purse have a bank account leave that 
luckily i have -PRON- store of gold napoleon bury in the garden donot want -PRON- money nonsense both need -PRON- go with -PRON- 
-PRON- canot can and will -PRON- say -PRON- dark eye alight make ready brion 
-PRON- leave this very night be crazy i whisper to the dark hood figure stand beside -PRON- on the shadowed path no reason for -PRON- to get involve in this hush olyvia say softly 
now -PRON- grow restless 
see -PRON- there 
i think hell cross the road now more closely to spy -PRON- out 
i watch the dense shadow make out the figure of a man -PRON- move off cross the road a hundred yard below the cottage disappear among the tree on -PRON- side 
i shift -PRON- weight carefully itch under the wild getup oylvia have assemble for -PRON- warty face gnarly hand stringy white hair and all 
i look like mother old brother as illtempere an old duffer as ever gnash -PRON- gum at the carryingson of the young generation 
olyvia be do up like belle watle in three layer of paint a fancy red wig a purple dress that fit -PRON- trim figure like wet silk and enough ring bead and tinkly earre to stock a gift shop 
hist -PRON- steal closer now -PRON- coconspirator whisper 
another half minute i wait listen to the monotonous chirrup of cricket in a nearby field the faraway oomau of a cow the yapping of a farm dog 
after dark the world belong to the animal hand touch mine 
now i follow as -PRON- step silently off i have to crouch slightly to keep below the level of the ragged hedge 
there be no moon only a little faint starlight to help -PRON- pick a way along the rutted dirt road 
-PRON- reach the end of the hedge and i motion olyvia back steal a look back toward the house 
a head be clearly silhouette against the faint light from the small side windaw 
i say in a low voice at the window there be a crunch of gravel and a light snap on play across the rut flash over -PRON- settle on olyvia here woman a deep voice growl ye do abroad after olyvia plant a hand on -PRON- hip toss -PRON- head not neglect to smile archly 
aoow capte -PRON- purr

-PRON- come close and a big hand reach out toward oljrvia 
-PRON- let out a short squeak and jump back 
the cop brush past -PRON- i catch a glimpse of a tricorn hat a beak nose loose jowl a splash of color on the collar of the uniform i pick -PRON- spot chop down hard across the base of -PRON- neck with the side of -PRON- hand 
-PRON- yelp drop the light stumble to hand and knee the stiff collar have protect -PRON- from the full force of the blow 
-PRON- scramble try to rise i follow kick -PRON- square under the chin -PRON- backflippe and sprawl out unconscious 
i grab up the light and find the switch flick -PRON- off 
be -PRON- badly hurt 
olyvia be stare at the smear of blood at the corner of the slack mouth have trouble ask for bribe for a few week i pull olyvia back toward the hedgerow hope -PRON- snooper do not hear anything 
-PRON- wait for a minute then start off again hurry now 
far away a spark of waver yellowish light move across the slope of the hill beyond the village the train olyvia say have to hurry -PRON- walk briskly for fifteen minute pass the darken shop at the edge of town reach the station just as the puff coalburner pull in 
a severelooke clerk in a dark uniform with crossed chest strap and coat tail accept money write out ticket by hand point out -PRON- car 
inside -PRON- find wide seat upholstered in green plush 
-PRON- be the only passenger 
i lean back in -PRON- seat with a sigh 
the train whistle shrill a lurch run through the car on -PRON- way olyvia breathe 
-PRON- look ecstatic like a kid at the fair just go to rome i say 
not the land of oz 
who can say -PRON- say whither the road of the future lead 
a the albergo romulu olyvia and i have adjoin room well up under the eave with ceiling that slant down to a pair of dormer window open onto a market place with a handsome rennaissance fountain the incessant flutter of pigeon wing and a day and night shrill of excited italian voice 
-PRON- be sit at the small table in -PRON- room eat a late breakfast of pizza procure at the corner emporium wash down with a musty red wine that cost so little that even the local begging corp could afford to keep a mild buzz on most of the time 
the two man interested in be bear somewhere in northern italy about i tell olyvia 
-PRON- come to rome as young man study engineering and electronic and in make the basic discovery that give the imperium the net drive gamble that if baum manage to get -PRON- bear and in the ninety be write something pretty close to what -PRON- do in -PRON- world and in the too then maybe maxoni and cocini exist here too -PRON- didnot perfect the drive obviously or if -PRON- do the secret die with -PRON- but maybe -PRON- come close maybe -PRON- leave something i can use 
brion do -PRON- not tell -PRON- that all the world that lie about -PRON- line be desolate blast into ruin by these very force be -PRON- safe to tamper with such fell instrument as these a fair shuttle technician olyvia i know most of the danger point 
maxoni and cocini didnot realize what -PRON- be play with -PRON- stumble on the field by blind luck and in a thousand million other world of -PRON- fail and bring ruin in -PRON- wake -PRON- know all this when -PRON- leave harrow i say shortly -PRON- only chance and a damn poor chance -PRON- be admit 
but i canot build a shuttle from scratch there s a speciallywound coil that s the heart of the fieldgenerator instal -PRON- but i never try to wind one 
maybe if there be a maxoni here and a cocini and -PRON- make the same chance discovery and -PRON- write up -PRON- note like good little researcher and the note still exist and i can find -PRON- olyvia laugh a charming girlish laugh 
if the god decree that all those ifs be in -PRON- favoi why then tis plain -PRON- mean -PRON- to press on risk -PRON- brion 
the vision of the sapphire city still beckon -PRON- the emerald city where i come from i say 
but -PRON- wonot quibble over detail see if -PRON- can find those note first well have plenty of time then to decide what to do with -PRON- 
a hour later at the local equivalent of a municipal record center a tiredlooke youth in a narrowcut black suit show -PRON- a threefoot wide ledger in which name be write in spidery longhand in faded ink thousand of name follow by date placesofbirth address and other pertinent detail 
securo signore -PRON- say in a tone of weary superiority the municipality have nothing to hide throw open to -PRON- -PRON- record among the most complete archive in existence in the empire but as for read -PRON- -PRON- smirk tweak -PRON- hairline mustache 
that the signore must do for -PRON-

as for -PRON- i have none 
there be the book cover the decade in question 
look all -PRON- wish 
but do not demand miracle of -PRON- 
i have duty to perform 
-PRON- voice develop an irritated snap on the last word 
-PRON- favor -PRON- with what -PRON- think be a piercing look and strutted oflf to sulk somewhere back in the stack i grunt and start look 
twenty minute pass quietly 
-PRON- work -PRON- way through start on the busy archivist peer out once to see what -PRON- be do withdraw after a sour look 
olyvia and i stand at the wooden counter poring over the crab longhand each take one page of about two hundred name 
-PRON- be a fast reader before i have finish -PRON- page -PRON- have turn to the next 
half a minute later -PRON- give a sharp gasp 
brion 
look 
guilio majtoni bear at paglio trade artificer i look

via carlotti fourth floor number nine 
with the aid of a street map purchase from an elderly entrepreneur in a beret and a soiled goatee who offer -PRON- a discount on racy postcard which i decline with regret -PRON- find -PRON- a narrow alley choke with discard paper carton vegetable rind overflow garbage barrel and shoeless urchin who dodge madly among the obstacle cheerfully exchange bandinage which would have make mussolini blush 
number twelve be a fade late rennaissance front of rusticate granite wedge between sag boardedup warehouse no more than a hundred or two year old 
maxoni -PRON- appear have start -PRON- career in the most modest quarter available even a century ago this have be a slum 
i push open the door cake with crack paint step into a narrow hall reek of garlic cheese decay and less pleasant thing 
-PRON- look terrible brion olyvia say 
perhaps -PRON- would best make inquiry first a door open and a round olivere face set in cushion of fat look out launch a stream of rapid italian 
-PRON- pardon 
madam i reply in the courtly accent i have learn from the roman ambassador to the imperial court 
-PRON- be but foreigner visit the eternal city for the first time

i give -PRON- the number of the apartment where maxoni have live ninetyodd year before and -PRON- nod start up the narrow stair puff like the steamengine 
olyvia follow and i trail admire the deposit of broken glass paper rag and assorted rubbish that pack every step and land with a trail wind up through the center wear by the foot of century of tenant 
i would have give odd that the bit maxoni may have contribute be still there somewhere

would the signore and signorina care to enter 
-PRON- fumble a threeinch key from a pocket jam -PRON- in a keyhole -PRON- could have put a finger through twist -PRON- throw the door wide 
vidil i in at a collapse cot snarl with dirty blanket a brokendown table strew with garishly color comic_strip empty coffee cup stain fingergreased glass and a halfloaf of drylooke bread

the odor of the place be a sour blend of unlaundered bedding old sock and a distillery infest with mouse 
i look at olyvia -PRON- give -PRON- a cool smile turn to -PRON- hostess

-PRON- be a hopeless quest from the first -PRON- say be off before -PRON- stomach rebel 
i dust off -PRON- hand grimy from grope on the back of shelf and under furniture look in all the obvious place i say

i wonder what year that be know a simple formula for calculate the day on which a give date must fall olyvia say breathlessly 
-PRON- will take but a moment -PRON- nibble at -PRON- lip frowning in concentration 
suddenly -PRON- expression lighten 
yes 
-PRON- fit 
june fall on a wednesday 
-PRON- frown 
as do that date in something that s well than nothing at all check -PRON- out 
the galileo institute let hope -PRON- still in business 
a little man in armband and an eyeshade nibble a droop yellowed mustache and listen in silence -PRON- vein hand rest on the countertop as though hold -PRON- in place as a barrier against smoothtalke foreign snooper that be a considerable time in the past -PRON- announce snappishly 
there have be many student at the institute since then many illustrious scientist have pass through these portal bring glory to the name of the galileo 
an odor of cheap wine drift across from -PRON- direction 
apparently -PRON- have interrupt -PRON- midmorning snort not apply for admission i remind -PRON- 
-PRON- donot have to sell -PRON- 
all i want be a look at the record of giulio maxoni 
of course if -PRON- filing system be so fouled up -PRON- canot find -PRON- -PRON- can just say so and report the fact in the article write -PRON- aie a journalist 
-PRON- straighten -PRON- tie give the mustache a twirl and ease something into a drawer out of sight behind the counter with a clink of glass 
just give -PRON- the same treatment -PRON- would accord any humble seeker after fact i say loftily 
after all the public be the owner of the institute surely -PRON- should receive the full attention of the staff whose bread and vino be provide by the public largesse that get to -PRON- -PRON- make gobbling sound hurry away come back wheeze under a volume that be the twin to the municipal register slam -PRON- down on the counter blow a cloud of dust in -PRON- face and lift the cover 
maxoni -PRON- say sir -PRON- pause pop -PRON- eye at -PRON- 
that wouldnot be maxoni -PRON- natural suspicious look be come back 
ahhh a variety of sudden emotion be hostle each other for space on -PRON- face 
maxoni i prompt 
maxoni the celebrated inventor -PRON- snap 
-PRON- turn and wave a hand at a frame daguerrotype one of a long sombre row line the room of the maxoni churn the maxoni telegraph key the maxoni improve galvanic buggy whip -PRON- be that which make -PRON- fortune of course i smile complacently like an inspector who s fail to find an error in the voucher file 
very good 
i see -PRON- be on -PRON- toe here at the institute just have a look at the record and then i let -PRON- trail off as smiley spin the book around point out a line with a chew fingernail 
here -PRON- be right here -PRON- original registration in the college of electrics 
-PRON- be just a lad from a poor farming community then -PRON- be here at the institute that -PRON- get -PRON- start 
-PRON- be one of the first of course to offer lecture in electrics 
the institute be one of the sponsor of the telegraphic conference later in that same year -PRON- rattle on with the sale pitch that have undoubtedly influence many an old alumnus or wouldbe patron of the science to fork over that extra bundle while i read the brief entry 
the address in the via carlotti be give the fact that maxoni be twentyfour a catholic and single 
not much help there 
be there any record i inquire as to where -PRON- live after -PRON- make -PRON- pile the little nian stiffen 
make -PRON- pile sir 
i fear i do not understand make -PRON- great contribution to human culture i mean i amend 
surely -PRON- didnot stay on at the via carlotti very long 
a sad smile twitch at one corner of the registrar tight mouth 
surely the gentleman jest the location of the museum be i think well know even to tourist 
what museum 
the gnome spread -PRON- hand in a gesture as roman as grate cheese 
what other than the museum house in the former home and laboratory of guilio maxoni 
the shrine wherein be house the relic of -PRON- illustrious career 
beside -PRON- olyvia be watch the man face wonder what -PRON- be talk about 
pay dirt i say to -PRON- 
then -PRON- donot have the address of this museum handy by any chance 
this net -PRON- a superior smile 
a skinny finger point at the wall beside -PRON- 
number twentyeight strada one square east 
any child could direct -PRON- in business girl i say to olyvia 
ah what be the name of the paper -PRON- ah claim to represent the little man voice be a nice mixture of servility and veiled insolence 
-PRON- be die to be insulting but wasnot quite sure -PRON- be safe with the temperance league i say and sniff loudly 
the maxoni question be just a dodge of course do a piece entitle drinking on duty and what -PRON- cost the taxpayer 
-PRON- be still stand in the same position goggle after -PRON- when -PRON- step out into the bright sunshine -PRON- maxoni house be a conservative stonefronted building that would have do credit to any street in the east seventy back home 
here be a neglectedlooking brass plate set above the inner rail beside the glass panel door announce that the home and laboratory of the renowned inventor guilio maxoni be maintain by voluntary contribution to the society for the preservation of monument to the glory of italy and be open from monday through saturday and on sunday from a cardboard placard tape to the glass invite -PRON- to ring the bell 
i do 
time pass 
a dim shape move beyond the glass bolt rattle the door creak open and a frowzy sleepblurred face blink out closed 
go away a voice like the last whinny of a die plow horse say 
i get a foot into the narrowing space between the door and the jamb 
the sign say i start brightly 
forget the sign the blurry face wheeze 
come back tomorrow i put a shoulder against the door buck -PRON- open send the charming receptionist reel back 
-PRON- catch -PRON- balance hitch up a sag bra strap and raise a hand finger spread palm face -PRON- open -PRON- mouth to demonstrate what be probably an adequate command of roman idiom ah ah donot say -PRON- i caution -PRON- 
the contessa here be unaccustomed to the vigor of modern speech -PRON- s lead a shelter life tuck away there in -PRON- immense palazzo at lake constance contessa 
a hideous leer that be probably intend as a simper contort the sag face 
oh my if i only would have known -PRON- grace be honor -PRON- little shrine with a visit -PRON- flee portal guard by a dragon olyvia say 
and the fair knight put -PRON- to rout with but a word use a magic spell on -PRON- promote to contessa now just smile distantly and act aloof 
i look around the room -PRON- be a standard entry hall highceilinge creamcolore with a stain glass window shed color light across a threadbare oncefine rug pick up highlight on a marbletopped table in need of dust twinkling in the cutglass pendant of a rather nice victorian chandelier 
a wide carpet stairway lead up to a sunlit landing with another stainedglass panel a wide arched opening to the left give a view of a stuffylooke library with a heavy table with pot of wax flower and an open book with a pen and inkpot beside -PRON- 
there be row of shelf sag under row of dusty book uncomfortable look horsehair chair and sofas a fireplace with tool under a mantel on which china gimcrack be arrange in an uneven row 
look like maxoni go in for bourgeois luxury in a large way once -PRON- get onto the buggywhip boom i comment wonder where the lab be olyvia and i wander around the room smell the odor of age and dust and furniture polish i glance over a few of the title on the shelf experiment with alternate current of high potential and high frequency by nikola tesla catch -PRON- eye and a slim pamphlet by marconi otherwise the collection seem to consist of good solid victorian novel and bound volume of sermon 
no help here -PRON- dragon come back look grotesque in a housecoat of electric green a tribute to field of research no doubt 
a layer of cakeylooke makeup have be hastily slap across -PRON- face and a rosebud mouth draw on by a shaky hand 
-PRON- lace -PRON- finger together do a curtsey like a train elephant gush at oljrvia who incline -PRON- head an eighth of an inch and show a frosty smile 
this example of aristocratic snobbishness delight the old girl -PRON- beam so hard i think the makeup be go to crack like plaster in an earthquake 
a wave of an economical perfume roll over -PRON- like a dust storm 
-PRON- grace wish to see the laboratory where maxoni do -PRON- great work i announce fan 
-PRON- may show -PRON- there at once 
-PRON- shoulder in ahead of -PRON- to get a spot nearer the contessa and with much waving of ring hand and trailing of fringe conduct -PRON- along a narrow hall beside the staircase through a door into a weedy garden along a walk to a padlock shed chatter away the whole time 
of course the workroom be not yet fully restore -PRON- flutter haul a key from a baggy pocket 
-PRON- get the lock open stop as -PRON- grope inside grunt as -PRON- find the light switch 
a yellowish glow spring up 
olyvia and i stare in at dust lumpy shape cover with tarpaulin dust heap carton dust grime window and dust 
-PRON- work of course -PRON- be not so cluttered then short of fund -PRON- see -PRON- grace -PRON- get the sell in 
-PRON- havenot yet be able to go through the item here and catalogue -PRON- dispose of the worthless thing and restore the laboratory to -PRON- original condition -PRON- chatter on unabashe by silence 
i poke around try to look casual but feel far from calm 
-PRON- be in this shed or a near facsimile that maxoni have first make the breakthrough that have open the world of alternate reality 
somewhere here there may be something i do not know what i be look for a journal a work model not quite perfected i lift the corner of the dust cover over a heaped table glance at the assortment of ancient odd and end awkward heavylooke transformer primitive vacuum tube bit of wire a massive object at the center of the table catch -PRON- eye 
i lift the cover reach for -PRON- drag -PRON- to -PRON- 
really sir i must insist that -PRON- disturb nothing -PRON- guardian hippo bray in -PRON- ear 
i jump let the tarp fall dust whoofe into the air this be just as the professor leave -PRON- that last fatal day 
sorry i say hold -PRON- face in what i hope be a bland expression 
look like a collection of old iron to -PRON- 
yes professor maxoni be a bit eccentric -PRON- save all sort of odd bit and piece and -PRON- be forever try to fit -PRON- together have a dream -PRON- use to tell -PRON- departed papa when -PRON- be alive of course the professor i mean and papa too of course -PRON- father work for maxoni -PRON- know 
oh yes -PRON- be -PRON- assistant for ever so many year 
many the anecdote -PRON- could tell of the great man donot suppose -PRON- s alive 
papa 
dear papa pass to -PRON- reward fortythree or be -PRON- fortyfour -PRON- didnot leave a journal i suppose fill with jolly reminiscense of the professor 
no papa wasnot what -PRON- would call a litry man 
-PRON- pause 
of course the professor -PRON- be most diligent about -PRON- journal 
five big volume -PRON- one of the great tragedy of the society that -PRON- have not yet have sufficient fund to publish 
fund may yet be forthcome madam i say solemnly 
the contessa be particularly interested in publish just such journal as -PRON- describe 
oh 
the paintedon mouth make a lopsided to match the exclamation 
-PRON- grace so if -PRON- would just fetch -PRON- along so that -PRON- grace can glance over -PRON- i leave the suggestion hang in the safe sir but i have the key i know i have the key somewhere 
i have -PRON- only last year or be -PRON- the year before find -PRON- -PRON- good woman i urge 
-PRON- grace and i will wait patiently here thrill to the thought that -PRON- be in this very room that the professor develop -PRON- galvanic buggywhip 
oh no that be before -PRON- take this house no matter the journal please -PRON- rather come back inside the dust here as i say be thrill to -PRON- 
hurry back i wave -PRON- through the door 
olyvia look at -PRON- questioningly send -PRON- off to find journal i say 
-PRON- must have notice something in -PRON- voice 
brion what be -PRON- i step to the table throw back the cover 
the heavy assembly i have move earlier dominate the scattering of article around -PRON- 
that i say let the note of triumph come through be a coil the central component of the drive 
if i canot build a shuttle with that and the old boy journal turn in -PRON- badge -PRON- workshop i rent be a space under a loft opening off a narrow alleyway that wind from the strada d allenzo to a sidebranch of the tiber a trail that have probably be lay out by goat back before rome be big enough to call -PRON- a town 
the former occupant have be a mechanic of sort there be rusty piece of steamengine still lie in the corner a few corroded handtool rest among the dustdrift on the sag wallshelve at one side of the room odd and end of bolt and ers and metal shaving tread into the oilblack dirt floor 
the old fellow who lease the premise to -PRON- have grumblingly clear away the bad of the rubbish and instal a large batter metaltopped table 
this plus the moebius coil which i have bribe the keeper of the flame into let -PRON- borrow and the journal constitute -PRON- lab equipment 
not much to start move world with but still a start 
olyvia have get -PRON- room nearby cheap and well quarter than the albergo romulus 
there be a small hotplate in -PRON- room charcoalfire -PRON- agree to husband -PRON- meagre fund by have two meal a day in and the other one at one of the small neighborhood pasta palace where the carafes of wine be put on the table as automatically as salt and pepper back home 
i start -PRON- research program by read straight through all five journal most of which be devoted to bitter comment on the current political situation the capitol have just be move to rome from florence and -PRON- be drive price up note on some seemingly pointless research into magnetism the detail of a rather complicated but strictly platonic affair with a signora and worried budgetary computation that enlist ray full sympathy 
only in the last volume do i start to strike interesting passage the first tentative hint of the big secret 
maxoni have be experiment with coil wind -PRON- passie various type and amount of electric current through -PRON- and attempt to detect result 
if -PRON- would know more modern physics -PRON- would never have bother but in -PRON- ignorance -PRON- persevere 
like edison try everything from horsehair to bamboo splint as filament for -PRON- incandescent bulb maxoni doggedly try test noted result and try again 
-PRON- be the pure of pure research -PRON- didnot know what -PRON- be look for and when -PRON- find -PRON- -PRON- hadnot known what -PRON- be at least not in this world 
of course there have be no cocini here 
i didnot know what the latter role have be back in the world line -PRON- would be an interesting piece of read for -PRON- when i get back if i get back that be if there be any place to get back to i let that line of thought die -PRON- wasnot get -PRON- anywhere 
the last volume of the journal yield up -PRON- secret such as -PRON- be a few scatter and fragmentary mention of the coil wind and a line or two regard strange manifestation obtain with the goldleaf electroscope when certain trickle current be use 
a have go by and i be ready to start the experimental phase 
there be a few electrical supply house in the city mostly purveyor to the university and research institutes electricity be far from the reddy kilowatt stage in this world 
i lay in a variety of storage battery oscillator coil condenser vacuum tube as big and clumsy as milk bottle plus whatever else look potentially useful 
then at suggestion -PRON- mesmerize -PRON- take note as i repeat everything -PRON- subconscious have memorize from the training have in net shuttle technology which turn out to be twice as valuable as note 
-PRON- be pleasant day i rise early join olyvia for breakfast walk the two block to the shop and toil until lunch record -PRON- result in a book not much different from the one maxoni have use a century earlier this be not a world of rapid change 
olyvia would come by at noon or a little after look fresh and cool and healthy now with the roman sun give -PRON- face the color -PRON- have lack back in harrow 
the basket on -PRON- arm would produce sandwiches pizza fruit a bottle of wine i have a couple of chair by this time and -PRON- would spread -PRON- lunch on the corner of -PRON- formidable work bench with the enigmatic bulk of the coil lie before -PRON- like some jealous idol in need of placate 
then an afternoon of cut and fit and note with curious passersby pause at the open door to look in and offer polite greeting and shy questioning by the time a month have pass i be defer to by all the local denizen as a mad foreigner with more than a suggestion of the sorcerer about -PRON- 
but -PRON- be friendly often drop off a casual gift of a bottle or a salami or a wedge of pungent cheese with a flourish of roman compliment 
each evening by the time the sun have drop behind the crooked skyline across the way and the shop have fade into deep shadow hardly relieve by the single feeble lamp i have string up -PRON- eye would be blur -PRON- head ring -PRON- leg ache from the hour of stand hunch over the table 
i would solemnly close the door attach the heavy padlock ignore the fact that the door be nothing but a few thin board hang from a pair of rusted hinge hold in place by bent nail then the walk home past the shop and stall -PRON- owner busy close up now up the stair to the flat for a quick bath in the ruststaine tub down the hall then out with olywia to the evening treat 
sit at the wobbly table on the tile floor often on a narrow terrace crowd beside a busy street -PRON- talk watch the people and the night sky then go back to part at the flat door -PRON- to -PRON- room i to mine 
-PRON- be a curious relationship perhaps though at the time -PRON- seem perfectly natural 
-PRON- be coconspirator engage in a strange quest halfdetective half researcher set apart from the noisy crowd all around -PRON- by the fantastic nature of the wildly impractical dream -PRON- be embark on -PRON- for reason of romantic fulfillment and drive by a compulsion to tear through the intangible prison wall that have be drop around -PRON- ir estimate of age have be steadily revise downward at first in the initial shock of see mother goodwill unmasked i have mentally assign -PRON- a virginal fortyishness later bedizen in -PRON- harlot finery and enjoy every minute of the masquerade -PRON- have seem young perhaps thirtyfive i have decide 
now with the paint scrub away -PRON- hair cut and wear in a casual roman style -PRON- complexion warm and glow from the sun and the walk -PRON- figure as fine as ever in the neat inexpensive clothe -PRON- have buy in the modest shop near -PRON- flat i realize with a start one day watch -PRON- scatter bread crumb for the pigeon behind the shop and laugh at -PRON- clumsy waddle that -PRON- be no more than in -PRON- middle twenty 
-PRON- look up and catch -PRON- stare at -PRON- a beautiful girl olyvia i say in a wonder tone afraid 
what ever get -PRON- off on that mombi kick -PRON- look startled then smile a merry expression than the lady look -PRON- use to favor guess -PRON- -PRON- say sound mischievous 
the old witch in the sorceress of oz yes but why tell -PRON- -PRON- business patronize a wise woman without wart on -PRON- chin sure but why havenot -PRON- marry i start to deliver the old see about there be plenty of nice young man but the look on -PRON- face save -PRON- from that banality none of -PRON- business i say quickly didnot mean to get personal olyvia i trail off and -PRON- finish -PRON- walk in a silence which if not grim be certainly far from companionable 
three week more and i have assemble a formidable compilation of datum enough i tell oly66 via when -PRON- come to the shop at ten to see what have keep -PRON- to warrant start construction of the secondary circuit the portion of the shuttle mechanism with which i be most familiar 
the big job i say be to calibrate the coil find out what kind of power supply -PRON- call for what sort of field strength -PRON- develop 
that part do 
now all i have to do be set up the amplify and focusse apparatus -PRON- make -PRON- sound so simple try to convince -PRON- i admit a long way from simple -PRON- a matter of try to equate a complicated assemblage of intangible force a little bit like balance a teacup on a stream of water except that i have a couple of dozen teacup and a whole fire department worth of waterworks and if i throw full power to the thing without the proper control then what 
then set up an irreversible catyclysm of any one ef a hundred possible variety 
a titanic that keep on explode an uncontrolled eruption of matter from another continuum like a volcano pour out of the heart of a sun er maybe an energy drain like niagara that would suck the heat away from this spot freeze the city solid in a matter of minute put the whole planet under an icecap in a month 
or tis sufficient i understand 
these be fearsome force -PRON- toy with brion worry i wonot pour the power to -PRON- until i know what do 
there be way of set up autotimed cutoff for any test i run and be use trickle power for a long time yet 
the disaster that make the blight happen because the maxoni and cocini of those other werenot forewarn -PRON- set -PRON- up and let -PRON- rip 
the door to hell have welloile hinge 
how long before -PRON- will finish few day 
there isnot a hell of a lot to the shuttle build a simple box out of pine slab if i have to just something to keep -PRON- and the mechanism together be a big clumsy setup of course not compact like the imperial model but -PRON- will get -PRON- there as long as the power flow 
the drain isnot very great 
a stack of these six volt cell will give -PRON- all the juice i need to get -PRON- home 
and if the xonijeel be right -PRON- say softly 
if the world -PRON- seek lie not where -PRON- expect what then then run out of steam and drop into the blight and that will be the end of another nut i say harshly 
and a good thing too if i imagine the whole imperium know -PRON- didnot brion but if somehow something have go wrong worry about that when i get to -PRON- i cut -PRON- off be plow along wrap -PRON- up in -PRON- occupational therapy 
i wasnot ready yet to think about the thousand gloomy possibility have to face when i step into -PRON- crude makeshift and throw the switch 
i be three evening later and olyvia and i be sit at a window table in one of -PRON- regular haunt have a small glass of wine and listen to the gentle night sound of a city without neon and internal combustion be come by the shop for -PRON- every evening lately a habit that i find -PRON- look forward to 
-PRON- wonot be long now i tell -PRON- 
-PRON- see the box just bolt together out of wood but good enough 
the coil instal 
tomorrow lie out -PRON- control circuitry brion -PRON- finger be on -PRON- arm 
look there i twist catch a fleeting glimpse of a tall dark figure in a long fullskirte militarytype coat with the collar turn up push past through the sparse pedestrian traffic 
-PRON- be -PRON- voice be tight with strain 
all right maybe -PRON- be i say soothingly 
take -PRON- easy girl 
how sure be -PRON- sure brion 
the same terrible dark face the beard there be plenty of bearded man in rome olyvia -PRON- have to go quickly -PRON- start to get up i catch -PRON- hand pull -PRON- gently back 
no use panic 
do -PRON- see -PRON- think not sure -PRON- finish see -PRON- and turn -PRON- face away but if -PRON- s see -PRON- if -PRON- be -PRON- boy run wonot help 
if -PRON- didnot see -PRON- -PRON- wonot be back 
but if -PRON- hurry brion -PRON- need not even stop at the flat to get -PRON- thing -PRON- can catch the train be mile from rome by daylight if -PRON- have be trail here -PRON- can be trail to the next town 
besides which there s the little matter of -PRON- shuttle nearly do another day work and a few test of what avail the shuttle if -PRON- take -PRON- brion i pat -PRON- hand 
why should anyone want to take -PRON- 
i be dump here to get rid of -PRON- brion think -PRON- some village goose to be coddle with this talk -PRON- must act now i chew on -PRON- lip and think about -PRON- 
olyvia wasnot be soothe by -PRON- bland talk any more than i be 
i didnot know what kind of followup the xoni68 jeelian web police do on -PRON- deportee but -PRON- be a cinch -PRON- wouldnot look kindly on -PRON- little home workshop project 
the idea of plant -PRON- here have be to take -PRON- out of circulation -PRON- would back -PRON- play olyvia be right about that 
all right i get to -PRON- foot drop a coin onthe table 
out in the street i pat -PRON- hand 
now -PRON- run along home olyvia do a little snooping just to satisfy -PRON- that everything then no stay with -PRON- silly i say 
if there be any rough stuff -PRON- think i want -PRON- mixed up in -PRON- 
not that there will be 
-PRON- have some madcap scheme in mind brion what be -PRON- 
will -PRON- go back to the workshop just want to check to make sure nobodys tamper with the shuttle 
-PRON- face look pale in the light of the carbide lamp at the corner 
-PRON- think by hasty work to finish -PRON- to risk -PRON- life wonot take any risk olyvia but damn if go to be thwart when this close need help not unclever in such matter 
i shake -PRON- head 
stay clear of this olyvia the one -PRON- be interested in but -PRON- could get hurt how close be -PRON- to finish -PRON- work few hour then some test then -PRON- would best be start i sense danger closeby this night 
i hesitate for just a moment then take -PRON- hand donot know what do to earn such loyalty i say 
come on -PRON- have get work to do go to the flat first turn on light make coffee then with the room darken take the back stair ease out into a cobble alley 
half an hour later after a circuitous trip which avoid main street and welllit corner -PRON- reach the shop slip inside 
everything look just as leave -PRON- an hour earlier the box -PRON- side half slab up with board the coil mount at the center of the plank floor the bright wire of -PRON- halfcompleted control circuit gleam in the gloom 
i light a lamp and -PRON- start to work 
olyvia be more than clever with -PRON- hand 
i show -PRON- once how to attach wire to an insulator and -PRON- be well at -PRON- than i be 
the battery require a mount box i nail a crude frame together fit the cell in place wire up a switch make connection 
every half hour or so olyvia would slip outside make a quick reconnaisance not that -PRON- would have help much to discover a spy sneak up on -PRON- 
i couldnot quite deduce the pattern of -PRON- tactic if any 
if -PRON- have be spot surely the shop be under surveillance 
maybe -PRON- be just let -PRON- finish before -PRON- close in perhaps -PRON- be cuious as to whether -PRON- be possible to do what i be try to do with the material and technology at hand -PRON- be well after midnight when -PRON- finish 
i make a final connection run a couple of circuit check if -PRON- research have be accurate and -PRON- recollection of theory correct the thing shovld work 
-PRON- look so fragile brion eye be dark in the dim light 
-PRON- own eyeball feel as though -PRON- would be roll in emery dust fragile but a move shuttle be immune to any external influence enclose in a field that hold the air in and everything else out 
and -PRON- doesnot linger long enough in any one for the external temperature or vacuum or what have -PRON- to affect -PRON- 
brion 
-PRON- take -PRON- arm fiercely 
stay here 
risk not this frail device tis not too late to flee let the evil man search in vain somewhere well find a cottage in some hamlet far from -PRON- scheme -PRON- expression tell -PRON- -PRON- wasnot reach -PRON- 
-PRON- stare into -PRON- eye for a moment then let -PRON- hand fall and step back be a fool to mingle dream with drab reality -PRON- say harshly 
i see -PRON- shoulder slump the life go from -PRON- face 
almost -PRON- be mother goodwill who stand before -PRON- 
olyvia i say harshly for sake there be a sound from the door 
i see -PRON- tremble and jump for the light flip -PRON- off 
in the silence a foot grate on brick there be a sound of rusty hinge and a less darkness widen as the door slide back 
a tall dark silhouette appear in the opening 
bayard a voice say sharply in the darkness an unmistakably xonijeelian voice 
i move along the wall the figure advance 
there be a crowbar somewhere near the door 
i crouch try to will -PRON- invisible reach and -PRON- finger close around the cold rustscaled metal 
the intruder be two yard away now i straighten raise the heavy bar -PRON- take another step and i jump slam the bar down solidly across the back of -PRON- head see a hat fly as -PRON- stumble and fall on -PRON- face with a heavy crash 
brion 
olyvia shriek all right 
i toss the bar aside reach for -PRON- put -PRON- around -PRON- 
-PRON- have to understand olyvia i rasp more at stake here than any one dream this be something i have to do 
-PRON- have -PRON- life ahead 
live -PRON- and forget -PRON- 
let -PRON- go with -PRON- brion -PRON- moan 
-PRON- know i canot 
too dangerous and -PRON- would halve -PRON- chance of find the line before the air give out 
i thrust -PRON- wallet into -PRON- cloak pocket have to go now 
i push -PRON- gently from -PRON- 
almost i hope -PRON- fail voice come through the dark 
i go to the shuttle light the carbide run light reach in and flip the warmup switch 
from the shadow i hear a groan from the creature i have stun better go now olyvia i call 
get as far away as -PRON- can go to louisiana start over forget the mother goodwill routine 
the hum be build now the song of the torture molecule as the field build twist space warp time create -PRON- tiny bubble of impossible tension in the massive fabric of reality 
goodby olyvia 
i climb inside the fragile box peer at the makeshift panel 
the field strength meter tell -PRON- that the time have come 
i grasp the drive lever and throw -PRON- in be a wrench sation a sputter of arc current through untried circuit then the wall flick from view around -PRON- and i be look out on the naked devastation of the blight 
no need for viewscreen here the footwide gap between the rough slat give -PRON- a panoramic view of a plain of rubble glow softly under the light of the moon a view that shift and flow as i watch blacken into burn ruin slump gradually into a lavalike expanse of melt and harden masonry and steel 
i unclenche -PRON- tooth try a breath everything seem all right i be ride an eggcrate across hell but the field be hold leash by the mathematical matrix embody in a few hundred strand of wire string just so from nail to nail around -PRON- wooden cage 
the massive moebius coil bolt to the floor vibrate nervously the way -PRON- stomach feel 
i make an effort to relax i have a long ride ahead and there d be plenty to be nervous about later on 
-PRON- halfdozen juryrigge instrument be obediently give reading i look at the trembling needle and try to think about what -PRON- represent 
the only map i have be a fuzzy recollection of the photogram the xonijeelian have show -PRON- 
if this be a fourth island in the blight and i have already decide not to question that assumption then i be drive in what ought to be close to the correct direction 
method of navigation in the net depend on an orientation with an arbitrary set of standard value measurement of the strength of three of the seemingly infinite number of field which be a normal part of the multiordinal continua 
a reading of any three of these value should give a location note the progressive change in the interrelation of the value provide a plot across the net maybe 
there be the little matter of calibrate -PRON- instrument determine how far -PRON- calculated orientation and vector vary from the actual estimate -PRON- velocity test -PRON- crude control to see how much steering i could do and determine how to bring the shuttle into identity square on target when and if i find a target and all of this before the air become too foul to breathe 
there be no problem of food water or a place to sleep be dead long before any such luxury become necessary 
-PRON- first rough approximation from the datum on the dial tell -PRON- that i be move along a vector at least degree off the calculated one i make a cautious adjustment to one of -PRON- crude rheostat wince as the spark fly watch the dial to see the result 
-PRON- werenot good 
either i be misinterpret -PRON- reading or -PRON- control be even bad than think 
i scribble down figure make some hasty interpolation and come up with the discovery that i be blast along at three time -PRON- calculated net velocity on a course that seem to be vary progressively 
-PRON- hastily rig untested circuitry be badly out of balance not far enough out to spill the leash entropic force in a wild torrent of destruction but too far out to be soothe 
i make another haphazard adjustment check reading the needle waver one backtrack down the scale two other move steadily upward 
i make a herculean effort to recall all ever know about emergency navigation conclude that i have describe most of a full circle and be now head back in the general direction from which start 
there wasnot much play leave in -PRON- control i push the lever which serve as rudder all the way to the left watch as instrument respond not enough 
i have a few wild thought of rerigge the strand of wire that constitute -PRON- shield against the boiling holocaust of uncontrolled volcanic destruction now churn and spew black gas just beyond -PRON- latticework wall but give that up quickly i couldnot shut down power for anything not here 
another ten minute pass -PRON- watch be tick away measure off some unimaginable quality in -PRON- timeless headlong plunge across the alternate reality 
-PRON- be like the toothgritte wait while the lab technician probe around with -PRON- nefedle look for a vein one second seem to last forever 
another reading no doubt about -PRON- now i be follow a roughly spiral course whether descend or ascend i couldnot tell 
the control circuit be spark continously the stress induce by the unnatural entropic load be rapidly overheat the undersized wiring 
a junction box tack to a be glow a dull red and the wood under -PRON- be smoke turn black 
as i watch pale flame lick catch run up the wood 
i pull off -PRON- highshouldere widelapelled jacket slap at the fire uselessly 
a wire melt through drop spatter fire as -PRON- cross other naked wire then hang weld into a new position 
for a heartstoppe instant i brace -PRON- for the lurch drop into identity with the tower pillar of fire thundering silently outside then realize that miraculously the shuttle be still move 
i rub smokestung eye check dial the course have change sharply 
i try to reconstruct the erratic path i have take work out a deadreckoning of -PRON- position 
-PRON- be hopeless 
i could be anywhere 
the scene beyond the shuttle wall be strange not like anything i remember from blight exploration film see 
a row of steepsided black cone stretch away to the horizon each glower dull red about -PRON- crater rim over which continuous welling of lava spill while vast bubble burst send up dense belch of brown smoke that form a cloud obscure the moon 
here -PRON- appear a new faultline have be create in the planet crust along which volcanos sprout like weed in a newploughed field 
i have be on -PRON- way for about forty minute now with a pang of homesickness i picture olyvia back at the flat alone 
suddenly i be remember the day the evening -PRON- would spend together -PRON- unfailing spirit the line of -PRON- throat and cheek as -PRON- sit at a table raise glass in the long roman twilight i have have everything there a man need for a good life maybe be a fool to exchange -PRON- for this a doom ride on a hellbound train to nowhere 
maybe 
but there hadnot really be any choice 
there be thing in life a man have to do or the savor of the salt be go forever 
i lose now that be clear enough 
for the last hour the shuttle have be charge across the continua blindly describe an erratic course which vary every time a connection fuse and create a new pattern in the control circuit 
the post be still smoulder and smoke use up -PRON- scant air and foul what be leave 
i have stretch out on the floor some time earlier try to find clean air -PRON- be about go now i cough with every breath and -PRON- head keep up a steady humming like a wornout transformer 
i be pick up some interesting observation on the effect of modify shuttle circuitry at full gallop and observe some new country never before explore by -PRON- net scout but the chance of -PRON- surviving to use -PRON- be dwindle with each pass minute 
i have scratch a few line of calculation on the floor with a fragment of char wood at the rate at which i be move i be deep in the blight by now outside the ruin world flow past a panorama of doomsday 
the volcano be go shrink to fiery pit that spark and hurl fountain of fire into the black sky 
i blink peer through shroud mist of steam and smoke far away a line of dark hill show new hill create by the upheaval of this world crust 
the smoke thin for a moment give -PRON- a clear glimpse of the distant landscape be that a hint of green 
i rub at -PRON- eye stare some more 
the hill dim in the moonlight seem to show a covering of plant life the nearby fire pit seem quieter now still to glow pool of molten lava glaze over into dullness 
and there a scraggly bush poke up at the rim of a crater and another 
i draw a breath cough get to hand and knee 
the glow be fade from the scene now unmistakable pinpoint of bright green be show up everywhere a shoot poke through the black soil rise twist unfurl a frond shoot up high extending leaf after leaf in a speededup motionpicture sequence of growth each frame a glimpse of a different varying by a trifle from the next create a continuous drama of change a change toward life 
in -PRON- erratic wandering -PRON- appear the shuttle have turn back now toward the edge of the blight 
i watch see new shoot appear spring up evolve into great treefern giant cattail tower palmlike trunk along whose concretegrey surface vine crept like small green snake to burgeon suddenly embrace the vast tree in a smother outburst of green clamber over the crown then sink down as the tree die and fall only to turn on -PRON- mound high reach capture a new host a grow around -PRON- now nourish in the volcanic soil 
orchid as big as dinner plate burst like popcorn drop be replace by other orchid as big as washtub 
in the bright moonlight i see a flicker of motion a new kind of motion a moth appear a bright spec grow until -PRON- be two foot across then the vast flower on which -PRON- perch close over -PRON- in a frantic flurry of gorgeous wing and flamboyant petal 
nearby a wall of foliage bulge burst outward 
a head thrust through gape jaw like an immense rat close on vine that coil choke 
the head change develop armor which grow out bladelike slice through the rope of live plantfibre juice ooze spill thorn bud grow hungrily toward the animal reach the furred throat and recoil blunt from armored hide 
then new leave unfold reach to enfold the head wrap -PRON- in smother fold of leathery green -PRON- twist fight tear free only to be entoile again sink down now go in a surge sea of green 
i cough choke get to -PRON- foot reach for the control panel miss and fall 
the crack on the head help for a moment 
i try to breathe get only smoke -PRON- be now or never the world outside be far from invite but there be nothing for -PRON- in the shuttle but death by asphyxiation 
i could drop into identity make hasty repair study the datum i have collect decide where i be and try again 
back to hand and knee a grip on a board on -PRON- foot now reach for the switch find -PRON- in the choking smoke pull there be a shock a sense of whirl then a blow that send -PRON- fly against shatter board into rubbery foliage and a gush of fresh air i finish cough extricate -PRON- from the bed of vine i find -PRON- in half expect to see -PRON- reach for -PRON- fortunately however the strange causeand effect sequence of eentropy didnot apply here that stream of pseudotime be as static in normal time as the ter be during a shuttle ride 
in the gloom i make out the shape of the flimsy box that have bring -PRON- here cant against a giant treetrunk smash into a heap of scrap lumber 
smoke be boil from under the heaped board and bright flame show start along a wristthick vine cast flicker light and shadow on surround tree and underbrush 
there be a board under -PRON- foot still trail a festoon of wire i grab -PRON- up struggle through to the fire beat at the flame -PRON- be a mistake the bruise stem ooze an inflammable sap which catch with bright popping and crackling i be merely fan the flame 
the main chassis of the smashed shuttle be too heavy for -PRON- to try to drag back from the blaze 
i try to reach the coil with some vague idea of salvage but the fire be burn briskly now the dry wood flame up send fire high along the treetrunk ignite mere vine 
five minute later from a distance of a hundred yard i watch a firstclass forest fire get underway 
the rain start then too late to salvage anything from the shuttle but soon enough to save the forest 
i find shelter of sort under a wideleafed bush and sink into exhausted sleep 
morning dawn grey wet chilly with water drip from a billion leave all around -PRON- 
i crawl out check over assorted bruise find everything more or less intact 
i still have a slight rawness in the throat from the smoke and somewhere get a nice blister on the heel of -PRON- left hand but that seem a modest toll for the trip i have have 
the fire have burn out a ragged oval about a hundred foot across i walk across the black stubble to the remain of the shuttle survey the curl and char board the blacken lump that have be the coil 
the last faint hope flicker and die i be strand for good this time with no handy museum to help -PRON- out 
there be a vague sensation in -PRON- central region that i recognize as hunger 
i have a lot of thinking to do some vain regret to entertain a full quota of gloomy reflection on what be happen now back in the imperial capital but first i have to have food and if -PRON- sketchy knowledge of jungle be any guide a shelter of some sort against other inhabitant of the region that may consider -PRON- to be in that category 
and even before food i need a weapon 
a bow and arrow would be nice but -PRON- would take time to find a suitable wood and have to kill something for gut for the string 
a spear or club be about all be able to man76 age in -PRON- present state of technological poverty 
and even for those need some sort of cut edge which bring -PRON- back to the stone age in two easy step 
well the good source for nice usefulsized stone would be a stream and while there i could get a drink not that there be not plenty of water drip down -PRON- neck here 
the shoe i wear stiff loafertype clodhopper with buckle werenot the good for negotiate the uneven ground but after all -PRON- remote ancestor hadnot have that much 
the ground have a slight slope to what i suspect be the east i push -PRON- way through the thick growth not as junglelike as what see from the shuttle minute before -PRON- crash landing but not a nice picniccy sort of new england wood either 
i keep to the downslope stop now and then to listen for gurgle stream or growl bear 
the boy scout lore pay off i break through into a swampy crescent hug a grey mudflat with a meander current at -PRON- center fifty foot distant 
tightpacke greenery hang over the far side of the watercourse which curve away around a spit of more of the grey mud 
there be no stone in sight 
still there be plenty of clay good for pottery make perhaps i squat dip up a sample -PRON- be thin and sandy muck useless 
there be ample room to walk beside the stream i follow the course for several hundred yard find a stretch of high ground where the water come close to a bank of grassy soil 
this would make as good a campsite as any 
i pull off -PRON- shoe ease over the edge into the water sluice the bad of the soot and mud from -PRON- and clothe 
turn back i notice a strata of clean yellowish clay in the bank 
-PRON- be the real stuff smooth pliable almost greasy in texture 
all i need be a nice fire to harden -PRON- and over which to cook -PRON- roast chop fish fillet et cetera as soon as i have acquire the latter use the weapon i would make as soon as i have an axe and a knife 
i be almost sunset 
the day effort have net -PRON- one lump of flint which i have succeed in shatter into a handaxe and a couple of slice edge that any decent flintworker would have toss into the discard pile for archaeologist to quarrel over a few thousand year later 
still -PRON- have suffice to hack off two twelvefoot length of a tough springy sapling remove the twig and leave and sharpen the small end to approximate point 
i have also gather a few handful of small blackberry like fruit which be now give -PRON- severe stomach pain and several pound of the pottery clay which i have shape into crude bowl and set aside for air dry 
the sky have clear off in the afternoon and i have build a simple shelter of branch and large leave and drag in enough nearlydry grass for a bed of sort 
and use a strip of cloth tear from -PRON- shirt i have make a small firebow 
with a supply of dry punk from the interior of a rot tree and a more or less smooth stone with a suitable hollow i be now prepare to make fire 
-PRON- hardwood stick be less hard than i would have like and the bow be a clumsy makeshift but -PRON- be well than just sit and think 
i crumble the wood powder in the hollow place the pointed end of the stick against -PRON- with the bow string wrap around -PRON- and start in 
ten minute later with the bow twice break and mend the stick dull and the punk and -PRON- temper both exhausted i give -PRON- up for the night crawl into -PRON- cosy shelter 
two minute later a bellow like a charge elephant bring -PRON- bolt upright grope for a gun that wasnot there 
i wait hear a heavy body crash through underbrush nearby then the annoyed growl that go with the kind of appetite that prefer meat 
there be a number of large tree in the vicinity i find one in the dark with amazing speed climb -PRON- lose a trifling few square foot of skin in the process and wedge -PRON- in a high crotch and listen to stealthy footstep pad under -PRON- perch until dawn 
i the track the next morning when i halfclimbed half fall from the tree 
-PRON- be deeply imprint too big to cover with -PRON- spread finger not count the claws on the print that be 
some kind of cat i guess 
down at the water edge be more track big hoofmark the size of saucer 
-PRON- grow -PRON- big in these part 
all i have to do be bag one and have meat for as long as i could stand the smell 
i be get really hungry now follow the stream i cover several mile to the south gradually work -PRON- way into more open country 
there be plenty of sign of game include the bare bone of something not quite as big as a london bus with eondorlike bird pick over -PRON- halfheartedly 
i have -PRON- two spear and -PRON- stone fragment and i be hope to spot something appropriate to -PRON- resource say a halfgrown rabbit 
there be a sudden rattle of wing just in front of -PRON- and a grousylooking bird as big as a turkey take to the air 
i advance cautiously find a nest with four egg in -PRON- speckle brown three inch long 
i squat right there and eat one and enjoy every scrap 
-PRON- would have be nice to have scramble -PRON- but that be a minor consideration 
the other three i distribute in various pocket then go on feel a little well now 
the country here be high with less underbrush and more normallooking tree in place of the swampy jungle growth start from 
during highwater i imagine the whole area where the shuttle lie would be submerge 
now i have a well view off through the open forest to what seem like a prairie to the south where the game would be 
another half hour walk bring -PRON- to the edge of a vast savannah that remind -PRON- of picture see of africa with immense herd graze under scatter thorn tree 
here the tree be tall hardwood grow in clump along the bank of the stream and the animal be enough to make any zookeeper turn in -PRON- badge and start keep white mouse 
i see bison eight foot at the shoulder massive tusk almostelephant with bright pink trunk and pendulous low lip deer in infinite variety and horse build like shortnecke giraffes ten foot high at the shoulder with slope wither 
there -PRON- be and all i have to do be to stick -PRON- with -PRON- spear 
there be a low snort from somewhere behind -PRON- i whirl see a head the size of a rhinos set with two row of huge needlesharp tooth in a mouth that gape to give -PRON- a view of a throat like the intake duct on a jet fighter 
there be a body behind the head ten foot or more of massively muscle tawny blonde cat with a hint of mane faint stripe across the flank snow white throat belly and foot 
i take all these detail in as the mighty carnivore look -PRON- over yawned and pace majestically toward -PRON- frowning across at the distant herd like a troubled politician wonder who to pay the bribe to 
-PRON- pass -PRON- up at a distance of thirty foot move out into the area head high now look over the menu 
none of the animal stir 
king cat keep on bypass a small group of mastodon who roll -PRON- eye switch -PRON- trunk nervously 
-PRON- have -PRON- eye on the bison among whom be a number of cuddly calf weigh no more than a ton 
-PRON- move restlessly now form up a defensive circle like the muskox of the arctic 
the hunter vary -PRON- course angle to the left 
maybe -PRON- be think well of -PRON- with the suddenness of thought -PRON- be run streak across the grass in thirtyfoot bound leap now clear over the front rank of toss horn to disappear as the herd explode outward in all direction then -PRON- reappear stand over the body of a calf one paw rest affectionately on the huddled tan corpse 
the herd stampede a short distance resume feed 
i let out a long breath 
that be a hunter i jump at a sound spin -PRON- hand with -PRON- trusty spear come up automatically a brown rabbit the size of a goat stand poise on wiry leg snuffle the air show long yellow iatteeth 
i bring the spear back throw see -PRON- catch the creature in mid leap as -PRON- whirl to flee knock -PRON- head over long white heel 
i come pound up swing the second spear like a farmer wife kill a snake lay -PRON- low 
breathe hard i gingerly pick up the bloody carcass note the gouge -PRON- spear have make look around for a place to hide up and feast 
something black move on -PRON- arm 
a flea 
i dioppe the rabbit capture the parasite crack -PRON- with a satisfying report 
there be plenty more where that one come from i see stir around in the sparse hair on the footlong ear 
suddenly i didnot want raw rabbit or overgrown rat for lunch 
as suddenly as that the adrenalin be get by on for the past thirtysix hour drain away leave -PRON- a hungry sick batter castaway strand in a hellworld of raw savagery an unimaginable distance from a home which i know never see again 
i have be bumble along from one fiasco to the next occupy -PRON- mind with the trivial unwilling to face reality the chilling fact that -PRON- life would end here in solitude and misery in pain and fear and that before many more hour have pass 
i under a tree stare up at the sky rest i tell -PRON- or wait for another cat less choosy to happen along 
i have have -PRON- chance more than one and muff -PRON- all get away clean in the hagroon shuttle then let -PRON- carry -PRON- helplessly along to -PRON- dencity permit -PRON- to be capture without a struggle thinking learn something from the gorilla man 
and after a combination of the enemys stupidity and -PRON- luck have give -PRON- a new chance a new shuttle guess wrong again let dzok beguile -PRON- along to be sentence to life in exile 
and a third time after -PRON- wild guess have pay off i have panic run from the enemy without wait to test -PRON- homebuilt shuttle and end here 
each time i have make what seem like the only possible choice and each time get farther from -PRON- starting point 
not farther in term of net distance perhaps but infinitely farther from any hope of rescue to say nothing of -PRON- hope of warn the imperial authority of what be afoot 
i get to -PRON- foot start back toward where leave the wreckage of the shuttle with some halfformed idea of search through the wreckage again for what i didnot know 
-PRON- be the blind instinct of one who have absorb all the disaster -PRON- can for a while and who substitute aimless action for the agony of thought 
-PRON- be hard now plod back over the ground already cover 
follow the course of the river i pass the huge skeleton abandon now by the bird reach the mudflat where the trample remain of -PRON- crude hut give a clear indication of the inadequacy of -PRON- choice of camsite 
i have an idea of sort then back at the shuttle there be a lump of metal the remain of the original maxoni coil 
i may be able to use the material in some way pound -PRON- out into spearhead or make a flintandsteel for firestarte the impulse die 
-PRON- stomach ache and i be tired 
i want to go home now have a nice hot bath crawl into bed and be join there by someone soft and perfume and cuddly who d smooth -PRON- fevered brow and tell -PRON- what a hell of a guy i be 
-PRON- be easy to see the mechanic of schizophrenia at work here 
from wish -PRON- be an easy jump to believe 
i take a couple of deep breath straighten -PRON- back and head for the burnsite try to retain -PRON- grip on reality a little longer when -PRON- get unbearable i know the sanctuary of insanity would be wait here be animal track across the blacken ground hoofmark paw print and i bend over squint to be sure human or near enough 
i know how robinson crusoe feel now the evidence of a fellow man give -PRON- a sudden feeling of exposure along -PRON- backbone 
i make -PRON- to the surround unburned wall of jungle in three jump slide down flat on the ground and scan the landscape 
i try to tell -PRON- that this be a lucky break the first real hope fd have but an instinct old than theory of the brotherhood of man tell -PRON- that i have encounter the world most deadly predator the fact that -PRON- may be of the same specie just mean competition for the same hunting ground 
-PRON- spear wasnot a handy weapon and -PRON- skill with -PRON- wasnot anything to strike a medal in prise of 
i check -PRON- pocket for one of -PRON- stone find a smashed egg 
for a moment the ludicrousness of the situation threaten to start -PRON- snicker then i hear a sound from nearby in what direction i wasnot sure 
i ease back rise up far enough to scan the wood behind -PRON- see nothing 
i try to think the situation through 
if i be right if -PRON- be a man who d visit here -PRON- be important to establish contact 
even a primitive would have some sort of culture food fire garment of sort shelter 
i have skill pottery make basket weave the principle of the bow 
-PRON- could work out something perhaps but only if i could survive the first meeting 
i hear the sound again see a deerlike creature make -PRON- way across the burn 
i let out a breath i didnot know be hold and relaxed 
there be no way of know how long ago the manprint have be make 
still i couldnot lie here forever 
i emerge make a quick check of the burnedout shuttle 
everything be as leave -PRON- 
i take another look at the footprint 
-PRON- seem to be make not by a bare foot but by a heelless sandal of some sort 
-PRON- come across the bum circle the shuttle go away again and on the latter portion of the trail -PRON- clearly overlay -PRON- own booted print 
whoever -PRON- visitor have be -PRON- be follow -PRON- or have start out on -PRON- trail 
-PRON- be a thought that do nothing for -PRON- peace of mind 
i try to calm the instinct that tell -PRON- to get as far from the spot as possible 
i need to meet this fellow and on term that i could control 
i didnot want to kill -PRON- but neither do i want to try the palm outward friend of longknife routine 
that leave capture 
i be risky business work out in the open but then be alive be a risky business 
if the man track -PRON- have follow -PRON- trail then lose -PRON- somewhere on the high ground -PRON- may be a matter of many hour before -PRON- come back here to cast about again and i be sure for some reason that -PRON- would do the latter 
and when -PRON- do i have be work hard for two hour now set up -PRON- snare 
-PRON- wasnot fancy and if -PRON- propose captive be any kind of woodsman which -PRON- have to be to survive here -PRON- wouldnot fool -PRON- for a moment 
still -PRON- be action of a sort occupational therapy maybe but well than hide under a bush and waiting and -PRON- be helpful to -PRON- morale to imagine that i be take the initiative 
the arrangement consist of a shallow pit excavate in the soft soil cover over with a light framework of twig and leave and camouflage with a scattering of blacken soil 
i have do the digging with -PRON- bare hand help out by a board from the wreck and the dirt have be heap under the brush out of sight behind the wall of foliage 
the hole be no more than four foot deep but that be sufficient for -PRON- purpose to throw the intruder offbalance give -PRON- the drop on -PRON- sufficiently to open negotiation a handy advantage 
i be hungry enough now to scrape one of the smashed egg from the lining of -PRON- pocket and eat -PRON- but first i have to select -PRON- hiding place and get ready to act when the victim step into the trap 
i pick a spot off to the left arrange -PRON- so as to be able to jump out at the psychological moment and settle down to wait 
the pit be dig just in front of the wreckage at the point where the opening to the interior would lead an inqusitive victim i have drop a lacyedge hanky just inside the opening as an add attraction 
-PRON- be one olyvia have lend -PRON- to mop -PRON- forehead during the last allnight session and -PRON- still hold a whiff of a perfume that would attract a primitive more surely than a scattering of gold coin 
i have do all i could the next step be up to the opposition 
i from a light doze to see that -PRON- be late evening 
the tree be black lacework against a redgold sky and the chirruping of cricket and the shrill tseet tseet of a bird be the only sound against an absolute stillness and then the crackle of underbrush the snap of broken twig the sound of heavy breathing 
i freeze try to see through the gloom 
-PRON- be come hell -PRON- be there and make no effort at stealth 
-PRON- be sure of -PRON- this native which probably mean that here in -PRON- own stamping giound -PRON- be top carnivore 
i try to picture the kind of man who could stand up to the king cat see and give -PRON- up as too discourage 
and this be the fellow i be go to trip up and then threaten with a broom handle i swallow the old corn husk if -PRON- have recently change -PRON- address or plan to in the near future be sure to notify -PRON- at once make the necessary change on -PRON- mailing plate and see to -PRON- that -PRON- subscription continue without interruption 
right now print the information request in the space below and mail -PRON- to portland place boulder colorado name please account no old address city state new address city zone state mall copy to new address start with issue 
-PRON- account number appear directly above -PRON- name on the mailing label that have get wedge in -PRON- throat squint some more make out a tall figure come across the burned ground stooping apparently peer around look for -PRON- no doubt 
the thought give -PRON- no comfort 
i couldnot see what kind of weapon be have i grip -PRON- spear try to hold -PRON- breathing to a deep slow rhythm 
-PRON- be close now pause to glance over the shuttle then turn toward the entrance hold 
the handkerchief would be visible in the dim light and the scent -PRON- take a step another -PRON- be close now a vague dark shape in deep shadow there be a choke yell a crashing a thud and i be out of -PRON- hideyhole stumble across a tangle of root bring -PRON- spear up skid to a halt before the pale torso and dark head of the man who struggle scrabble for a handhold hipdeep in -PRON- trap 
hold -PRON- right there 
i bark through clenched tooth hold the spear ready with both hand poise over the man who stand frozen now a narrovishouldered longarmed figure -PRON- face a dark blob under a white headpiece say bayard dzok voice come lead -PRON- a merry chase i must say conclude next month by the senior citizen club have an anteroom beyond the red door 
try not to go through be while the tacky white enameled android be put the second scoop of bean on -PRON- breakfast tray that penrose begin to wonder if -PRON- be really old 
penrose put one hand flat on -PRON- face feel for wrinkle 
the serve android flip another scoop of bean out of the cauldron set in -PRON- chest 
this one miss the tray and drop on to the tan blanket of bed 
the android tick and more bean fall on the cot 
the old man in the next bed stretch a foot out from under the cover and kick the andy 
the machine ratchet and whir then say good morning 
have a happy day 
-PRON- roll away to serve the fat man across the aisle 
harrison say the old man who have boot the android 
-PRON- be lanky weather 
-PRON- face have deep sharp wrinkle 
-PRON- turn slightly in the bunk and penrose see that -PRON- have only one arm 
penrose hesitate 
penrose -PRON- say anally 
excuse -PRON- fuzzy about thing 
-PRON- couldnot remember even yesterday -PRON- realize now 
harrison swallow a spoonful of orange bean 
-PRON- know where -PRON- be donot -PRON- -PRON- room be small metallic with a low grey ceiling 
there be six bed in -PRON- 
only five of -PRON- occupy 
at the far end be a red metal door guess say penrose not certain 
where do -PRON- think 
penrose look down at -PRON- tray 
the two scoop of bean have collapse into a single pool 
well this be great los angele 
and the date be -PRON- october yes i know that the 16th correct harrison 
nodding penrose say oh that s right miss a day in senior citizen terminal say harrison 
the man in the other bed be old too like harrison 
penrose touch -PRON- face again not quite sure why here be have trouble remember exactly 
i have a feeling not not a senior citizen

when the lamp be shatter the light in the dust lie dead when the cloud be scatter 
the rainbow glory be shed 
when the lute be break 
sweet tune be remember not right say the pass android keep -PRON- cheerful 
guttenberg -PRON- hand limp at -PRON- side be prop in a chair 
come on gramp say the android 
talk 
send off something friendly to -PRON- love one 
penrose turn to harrison who be sit next to -PRON- -PRON- letter writing do 
why donot -PRON- leave guttenberg alone 
-PRON- canot even speak can -PRON- 
no say harrison 
-PRON- doesnot make sense 
not efficient be -PRON- 
penrose hesitate 
the welfare squad have an able and qualified staff of checker the efficiency detail 
-PRON- be -PRON- duty to make a thorough inspection periodically of each and every senior citizen terminal 
yes that s true say harrison 
of course say penrose fellow in the efficiency detail be overwork and underpaid 
sometimes -PRON- canot be as thorough as -PRON- would like to be 
the recreational andy hold the speaker up near mouth ten word message pop 
-PRON- can do that much 
come on -PRON- stop -PRON- 
penrose ask 
-PRON- turn off automatically when the recreation period end 
guttenberg be able to hold out till then 
this happen every day 
harrison nod 
therapy time announce a voice from the wall 
the blond android let go of guttenberg -PRON- therapist be shape like a portable safe and have a gun metal finish 
now say penrose when -PRON- be -PRON- turn this be go to sound odd to -PRON- 
not at all mr fowler say the metal box in a warm voice 
penrose fidget on the armchair that have come up through the fioor 
first off not fowler 
penrose 
now here the situation as i see -PRON- 
let -PRON- by the way apologize for be vague in some of the detail 
i realize now that probably be give some kind of medication 
look -PRON- say up the sleeve of -PRON- tan shirt -PRON- canot help but see the needle mark several of -PRON- 
and some in -PRON- backside too 
while i appreciate the smooth efficient way i be give medical aid i have to say disturb that i havenot snap out of -PRON- better 
yes of course mr fowler say the therapist 
no not fowler skip that for a minute 
i think i have some sort of accident or something and be take maybe to the near hospital 
fine 
however there seem to be a mistake be make not this fowler in fact -PRON- can see that not even old not a senior citizen hardly eflficient be -PRON- 
to keep -PRON- on here 
certainly certainly 
when i wake up this morning i be much fuzzy than i be now 
thing be start to fill in for -PRON- certain about thirty four year old 
there must be though i canot remember -PRON- as yet some useful function i fill on the outside 
some part of the essential function of great los angele surely possible answer the therapist 
all -PRON- have to do be let -PRON- know at central control and be able to take off 
-PRON- must have -PRON- outside clothe and packet and money someplace 
-PRON- realize that in a terminal of this size -PRON- can not be responsible for loss of property say the machine 
theft of belonging be naturally lamentable 
the responsibility can not be assume however by the terminal staff 
no say penrose not grouse about -PRON- belonging go back to the fact that only thirty four year old 
i donot belong here 
to be sure 
then -PRON- will do something 
-PRON- can assume that -PRON- problem will be give all the attention -PRON- warrant say the therapist must be get on to -PRON- next patient 
when exactly will -PRON- let -PRON- know 
penrose ask as the machine start to roll toward chair 
yes yes -PRON- say and begin talk to carlisle 
penrose glance hopefully at harrison and the one armed man smile back 
a fter lunch come sit 
not in the soft chair that have appear for therapy but in stiff straight metal one 
penrose have -PRON- hand cap -PRON- knee 
essentially -PRON- say to harrison the terminal be a positive thing 
a solution to the problem of senior clutter the welfare squad point of view hand rest on -PRON- chest 
those old timer who donot function anymore in the highly overstock urban and suburban complex be weed out say penrose 
should -PRON- turn out that an individual senior citizen still have a valid function -PRON- can always be reclaim 
-PRON- say the actual termination be pleasant 
look at the red door penrose say right beyond there isnot -PRON- 
yes 
this be one of the wait room 
-PRON- can spend from a day to a week or more here 
depend on processing 
after a moment penrose say should be back home by late today 
-PRON- know about -PRON- 
penrose shake -PRON- head 
not entirely aware that only thirty four in this terminal by mistake 
all the detail on -PRON- havenot come back to ine as yet 
still say harrison -PRON- wonder 
wonder about what 
if this terminal have make a mistake 
perhaps other do too 
perhaps this one have before 
no say penrose why -PRON- have the efficiency detail 
-PRON- slip up in -PRON- case 
there be a brief confusion because guttenberg fall over sideways out of -PRON- chair 
carlisle and remmeroy right -PRON- system like this have to have a human element say penrose 
even though the terminal -PRON- be fully automatic 
the efficiency detail provide that human element why i know the error in -PRON- case will be clear up 
suppose say harrison 
remmeroy hop up on -PRON- chair remember i remember the house where i be bear 
the little window where the sun come peep in at morn 
suppose what ask penrose 
harrison shrug -PRON- armless shoulder 
that an efficiency detail man come here to terminal to inspect 
-PRON- work solo -PRON- know 
the budget doesnot allow for team 
possibly the last time the efficiency detail man be through -PRON- oveilooke a faulty rail on a ramp 
this time as -PRON- lean on -PRON- -PRON- fall and whack -PRON- head 
while -PRON- be unconscious before the automatic staff rush to help someone may have switch paper with -PRON- 
someone name fowler say 
by the time the staff give -PRON- treatment for -PRON- fall and shot this efficiency detail man would be pretty confused 
the equipment here a lot of -PRON- anyway be old and erratic and -PRON- may easily get -PRON- mix up with one of these old fellow 
one on -PRON- way to a termination waiting room 
oh that s very unlikely say penrose be a rich fuel speculator say carlisle 
before i get mix up with this wild bunch here 
young fellow in -PRON- profession 
how about -PRON- -PRON- call out to penrose canot -PRON- say quite remember 
do -PRON- start with a the chair retract and -PRON- be time for nap the wall tell -PRON- 
harrison frown 
penrose be with the efficiency detail 
penrose be put to sleep before -PRON- could say anything to harrison -PRON- serve android be back into a corner 
on the blink again say carlisle 
for dinner a table have appear 
the five man be arrange around -PRON- give -PRON- a kick say harrison 
penrose jump up and get to the android first 
would -PRON- please get hold of the therapist for -PRON- 
happy day say the machine 
look say penrose 
that harrison try to tell -PRON- somehow be mistake for an old man name fowler 
that -PRON- this turn to be terminate today 
that kind of mistake be not go to look good on the record 
-PRON- touch one sticky arm of the enamel android donot know harrison could be lie 
-PRON- say with the efficiency detail 
the drug -PRON- people give -PRON- still fuzzy 
will -PRON- tell the therapist to please god hurry 
in case -PRON- be true 
choice of desert the andy say 
remmeroy run around the table and come slowly toward penrose and the android 
the sea be calm tonight 
the tide be full the moon lie fair 
the old man slam -PRON- fist against the machine and break -PRON- hand 
penrose exhale sharply 
somebody would have to come now and look after remmeroy 
then -PRON- would be able to get word out 
if -PRON- be with the efficiency detail -PRON- wouldnot be miss -PRON- yet 
-PRON- only have to report in once a week 
-PRON- cover a good part of great los angele and didnot have to file anything until the end of each work week 
still the efficiency detail may be wonder about -PRON- already be here two day now apparently 
-PRON- didnot recall a family 
civil servant didnot have time for close tie usually 
remmeroy return to the table 
-PRON- good hand lock around -PRON- other wrist 
-PRON- howl once and spin 
then sit quietly in -PRON- chair 
nothing come to help -PRON- 
the night nurse have some loose valve say harrison 
may not eome at all tonight be the young real doctor in -PRON- home town say carlisle 
-PRON- hometown begin with a or an penrose cup -PRON- hand to -PRON- mouth and yelled 
the red door swing open and the light in the grey room dim 
sorry say harrison turn away 
nice to have meet -PRON- say carlisle 
two bright silver android roll out of the room beyond the red door 
-PRON- slide over the floor and take hold of penrose 
this be go to mean trouble say penrose 
something jab -PRON- arm 
now now say one of the android 
-PRON- have the same voice as the therapist 
thing be okay 
perfectly add the other 
-PRON- take -PRON- into the termination room and guide -PRON- into -PRON- one straight chair 
the chair once -PRON- weight hit -PRON- extend restrain strap around -PRON- 
penrose be not as clear as -PRON- have be 
be sure -PRON- message get through -PRON- say 
the android be go and the door close 
there be a wet sound now 
a waterfall -PRON- sound like 
and soft organ music begin to fill the room 
penrose try to remember 
-PRON- couldnot quite believe that harrison be right 
that -PRON- be with the welfare squad with the efficiency detail 
-PRON- didnot seem to -PRON- that -PRON- could have be a part of a set up like this 
not at all 
a silver tube slide up out of the floor then another 
a gas with a faint floral odor be be release 
penrose drift back in the chair 
the room be do a smooth job of termination 
very efficient say penrose 
by the civil war exert a strange influence on fantasy writer 
ambrose bierce uncover a strange occurrence at owl creek bridge 
now john jake discover one equally strange at another bridge and at the grave across -PRON- 
i those grim day man become much less than man and only something more than animal 
this be because -PRON- have only the most primitive of objective to eat when -PRON- could to sleep if -PRON- may to slaughter pillage burn as much as -PRON- have strength and endurance to do 
-PRON- ride and march by day and by night 
-PRON- live in a daze of dirt scream fatigue disease death 
on every night horizon red stain seem to signal that the whole state of georgia be afire 
rumor run that the general who be call gump behind -PRON- back after -PRON- middle name tecumseh intend to bring the reb government to -PRON- knee by devastate the land 
on the road some day after atlanta fatigue and illness catch up with -PRON- 
i blank out for short period of time as i ride though i manage to remain with -PRON- unit 
then a more violent spell of fever seize -PRON- 
i fall out of column to rest 
the upshot be i wake the next dawn to discover i have be leave behind 
although i ride half the next night to find the 10th new york house i fail 
i be lose 
i be alone in a rural land full of tree and cabin where the johnny reb may look out at -PRON- and snipe -PRON- from the saddle 
after i realize i be lose i ride for another day and part of the next night still without success 
i be arm -PRON- pistol -PRON- saber and what -PRON- call a texas toothpick a big wicked fighting knife which a sergeant have swap -PRON- and which i have put away in -PRON- boot 
i have no food 
after a period of fever from which i remember nothing i suddenly find -PRON- on a cor93 duroy road at the entrance to a dark avenue between gigantic water oak 
i weave in the saddle 
the star blur then sharpen 
otherwise the sky be black 
the land smell of dampness and the smoke of pillage 
but i be so far out into the back country i see no sign of fire burn 
at the head of the avenue a white glimmering reveal a plantation house 
i nudge -PRON- weary horse toward -PRON- for i think fd see a lantern gleam 
half way up the avenue between the rustling tree -PRON- horse hoof rattle suddenly on board 
-PRON- be cross a flat bridge unseen in the dark 
-PRON- span a bubbling creek 
-PRON- horse leave forehoof come down on rot board 
plank creak snap 
the whole decayed center of the bridge give way beneath -PRON- 
i fall twist free of the scream frantic animal 
i strike the water 
-PRON- be not deep but -PRON- head crack a rock 
a fresh lance of pain add to that already rack -PRON- bone -PRON- chill creek water pluck at -PRON- elbow 
i see -PRON- horse scramble up and blow noisily unhurt in the fall 
if -PRON- wander off i would have no way to catch up to -PRON- unit 
i try to rise 
i fall back and all go dark 
when i open -PRON- eye again the aching and chill have grow bad 
-PRON- tooth rattle 
judge by the silence of the bird and the slight pall in the sky the time be near false dawn 
i drag -PRON- upright and clamber up the creek bank 
a whinny near one of the water oak show that -PRON- horse have not wander off 
i lurch toward -PRON- through a clammy ground mist which swirl and eddy around -PRON- boot 
this mistiness hide the great house at the head of the avenue except where a solitary yellow square seem to glisten as though a lamp be light i walk toward -PRON- horse reach out to stroke -PRON- muzzle 
suddenly the back of -PRON- neck crawl 
a man peer at -PRON- from the mist a scarecrowthin figure in sodden clothe so befouled with dirt -PRON- be impossible to recognize what sort -PRON- be 
-PRON- face be stubble 
-PRON- mouth hang open in a kind of wrench grin 
-PRON- eye be without pupil white as milk 
give -PRON- a hand i say 
where can i find some food and abe the apparition let out a low sound like a moan 
the mist drift high 
i think the figure have turn and flee 
i stumble after -PRON- 
wait 
come back here a union officer i order -PRON- to the word float eerily in the mist 
there be no one there 
through -PRON- fever i realize that the spectre of the pastyface man must be an hallucination the result of week of weariness hunger illness of see dead man leave behind at the roadside while cump juggernaut move across georgia 
but i do need help 
so i cup -PRON- hand to -PRON- mouth and begin to shout 
in the echo silence after -PRON- shout i hear a door creak and slam 
the exertion of call for help begin a new racking pain in -PRON- chest 
-PRON- boot slip in a moistureslime rock along the creek bank 
i catch a clump of shrub for balance 
but i tumble over sprawl in the water again 
a sibilant whisper of wind drift between the water oak on the avenue 
somehow as i crouch on hand and knee in the bubbling creek i know that a person be come toward -PRON- along that avenue 
i swing -PRON- head 
the mere exertion start -PRON- forehead buzzing and thud again 
i feel that i may blank out 
as i make an effort to scrabble toward the bank -PRON- left hand brush against -PRON- holster 
-PRON- be empty 
have -PRON- pistol drop out into the water 
i try to peer under the surface of the black swirling stuff 
i do not see the weapon 
then as fresh wave of dizziness wash over -PRON- two sensation strike -PRON- almost together one visual the other aural 
the first be the sight of waver orange firedot burn through the mist at the tip of a manybranched candlestick 
someone be carry the candlestick down the avenue through the mist 
the noise far out on the road be the unmistakable clatter of hoof and wheel 
i turn toward -PRON- 
a caisson whip by rumble 
a squad of cavalryman in blue rode behind 
-PRON- wear blue uniform 
i be not totally cut off from cump army after all i rear up in the water to shout 
the cry never leave -PRON- mouth 
i feel new rush of dizziness feel -PRON- hand slip beneath -PRON- 
-PRON- face plunge back in the water an instant after i have a macabre impression of a beautiful young woman the manybranched candlestick hold in -PRON- pale right hand gaze at -PRON- through the mist from the creek bank 
the candlelight dance and go out i with a thick feverish feeling in -PRON- head and a smell of dust in -PRON- nostril 
i be stare into the burn candlestick set upon a low table 
beyond -PRON- where darkness clot in the corner of what once must have be a genteel parlor a fat spider crawl lazily up a cobwebbing near the ceiling 
these impression and other filter through a haze of fever make -PRON- uneasy 
so do the great grotesque shadow throw by the sheeted furnishing and the thick patina of dirt upon the window 
in the sky outside i see the last brooding smear of a sunset indicate that i have be unconscious most of the day 
-PRON- hand rest on the arm of a highbacked chair 
-PRON- booted foot be prop on a low stool in front of -PRON- 
i become conscious of both -PRON- pistol and saber be miss 
just then the saber blade flash across -PRON- vision and hang there like a glitter metal bar 
i turn -PRON- head think -PRON- would never come round yank 
-PRON- voice be musical but edge with mockery 
the winevelvet gown -PRON- wear have see more prosperous day like the house and the land 
but -PRON- body be young and firm and -PRON- chin be tilt up 
-PRON- have a pretty mouth sharp gray eye and a long shinygold tress of hair tie at the nape of -PRON- neck with common string 
to see a southern girl in such a state of disarray hold a cav96 airy saber at -PRON- throat to boot would have be an unnerving sight even for a man not plague by fever 
how do i get here 
walk 
i help -PRON- some donot remember 
-PRON- go to make a fuss -PRON- say 
no i say guess -PRON- could put that through -PRON- gullet if i do 
-PRON- nod almost primly 
yes take much 
this -PRON- place i ask 
twelveoak belong to -PRON- husband donot know where i be exactly i say eye that shine strip of iron in -PRON- hand a hand which do not shake by a fraction think i pick up some kind of fever and i get separate from -PRON- unit 
-PRON- continue to watch -PRON- steadily 
do -PRON- have a name 
coburn i say 
captain joshua coburn 10th new york horse 
ride with that devil sherman -PRON- say though i nod 
do that earn -PRON- the saber through the neck 
slowly -PRON- raise the blade examine -PRON- shine surface 
then with a shrug -PRON- lay -PRON- on one of the sheetdraped piece of furniture 
-PRON- should right enough cept i havenot quite turn to act like an animal even though the yankee who have be ride through this part of the country have set a fine example 
-PRON- name be miranda saxby 
-PRON- walk a step closer display a gold ring on -PRON- left hand 
mrs saxby 
or the widow saxby -PRON- could say 
i make clear that all that happen between -PRON- happen as though i see hear take part in -PRON- while stare through layer of gauze 
i be lightheade inclined to talk foolishly because of the fever and unable to summon up much energy to stir from the highbacked chair even though the sternness of -PRON- gaze warn -PRON- that because i be a union officer alone and sick -PRON- know -PRON- enjoy an advantage not many of -PRON- have enjoy of late a chance for revenge 
as if to reinforce this idea -PRON- turn and walk off a way 
-PRON- pause by another table where several dusty goblet and a cut glass decanter full of some berry wine have be lay out good reason to hate -PRON- kind 
captain donot think i have not -PRON- say back turn 
the term widow have strike home a moment before 
-PRON- husband maam 
yes 
-PRON- skirt rustle as -PRON- swing 
shiloh church 
-PRON- be one of the first to die 
the slave have all run off thank to that monster who run -PRON- guvmint 
down here -PRON- call -PRON- linkum the ape 
-PRON- laugh a sound like bell 
but there be little humor in -PRON- eye as -PRON- continue -PRON- hear general sherman be march in this district 
most of the owner pull out but i stay 
i didnot have a place in the world to go 
i come from the sort of place where well -PRON- be in new orlean captain 
some try to prettify the type of place by call -PRON- a board school for young lady 
i see man kill there 
gambler riffraff 
-PRON- nod at the saber 
so not exactly unfamiliar with how -PRON- do 
chill sweat begin to bead up on the plam of -PRON- hand and upon -PRON- face as well 
-PRON- unstoppere the decanter 
-PRON- pour out two goblet of the wine sip a bit of her then carry the other to -PRON- 
cherry wine -PRON- say 
may warm -PRON- could use some food if there s any i say 
for a damnyank -PRON- be mighty highhanded in -PRON- want 
for the first and only time during the encounter i laugh aloud 
-PRON- come out as more of a dry croak -PRON- have get no reason to like union soldier as -PRON- say and probably plenty of reason for dislike -PRON- 
so i figure -PRON- will either make thing easy for -PRON- or kill -PRON- with no inbetween 
miranda smile a fact 
so which be -PRON- 
food or the sword through -PRON- neck there a foot or so in front of -PRON- the wine goblet catch the light of the candlestick and reflect -PRON- in odd little sparkle in -PRON- eye -PRON- grow tense 
-PRON- extend the goblet yet do not offer -PRON- fully 
a door creak somewhere 
i have a wild foolish pang of fright 
i wish just then for no clear reason that the clatter caisson see on the corduroy road have wheel in 
-PRON- be not right to say i feel afraid of the reb widow yet i do 
consider -PRON- this way 
i be not afraid of what i see namely a beautiful hungry defeat woman who have -PRON- at -PRON- mercy because i be feverish and weak i be afraid of something about -PRON- i could not see but only sense plenty of reason for -PRON- to hate yankee -PRON- repeat softly sure there be pretend -PRON- hate all this burnin and killin 
relive whatever -PRON- want but i donot enjoy -PRON- 
three of -PRON- a sergeant and two corporal -PRON- ride in here a week ago ours 
what else 
what do -PRON- give -PRON- 
i ask 
wine or the sword speak rashly try to humor -PRON- 
the wine goblet glitter a -PRON- throw -PRON- against -PRON- face with great violence 
the impact of the glass didnot matter much 
but the droplet run down through -PRON- beard have a nauseatingly sweet stink and seem to sting and burn 
i rub -PRON- away and the back of -PRON- hand seem to ste for a time afterward too 
-PRON- use -PRON- miranda say in a whisper 
-PRON- hurt and use -PRON- 
silent i watch -PRON- 
i wonder why -PRON- be take on so 
the word for -PRON- in new orlean -PRON- say low be rape 
again i be unsure about the proper reaction 
certainly an inmate of a board school for young lady could not have be all that repel by such an act 
-PRON- must have be the fact that -PRON- and -PRON- be partisan of different cause that produce all the pentup hate i hear seethe in -PRON- voice 
in any case -PRON- quicklyforme fist decide -PRON- against comment on that aspect of -PRON- 
there be scum in all army i say 
in any army there be scum 
-PRON- appear to compose -PRON- a little 
-PRON- shake off a light shudder and retrieve the goblet which somehow have not break when -PRON- fall to the floor 
as -PRON- pour more wine -PRON- say over -PRON- shoulder bind to be the way -PRON- yank will explain -PRON- 
well there have be enough other stop by since 
i be still wonder about that odd remark -PRON- bring -PRON- the glass 
here ride out as soon as able i tell -PRON-

almost against -PRON- own will i look around 
the same ghastly whiteeye creature i have glimpse down by the creek stand in the wide doorway which lead from the hall 
behind -PRON- other hideous figure stir unseen except for glimmer of empty white eye 
the right shoulder of the bescumme pale white apparition in the doorway display a tattering of dirty gold

but i be fill with a terror beyond anything i have ever experience 
the thing there in the parlor entrance have bloat pastewhite cheek 
down those cheek run crooked blackish line which some inward sense tell -PRON- be track of blood long dry 
the figure lift -PRON- grimed hand as though reach for -PRON- 
-PRON- make a sound with -PRON- yellowtoothed mouth a sound which could only be transcribe as a guttural groan something like the other horror behind -PRON- three or four of -PRON- -PRON- be impossible to tell take up the plaint until the ghastly moan though not excessively loud seem to press on -PRON- ear with actual pain 
a i stare the mewling of the thing stand there intensify 
i almost have a feeling that rather than menace -PRON- represent some kind of warning 
the spectre near -PRON- ieache out toward -PRON- and all reason slip away 
with a terrify curse i blunder after the saber pick -PRON- up whirl around and drive -PRON- as hard as i could straight into the befouled jacket of the creature approach 
candlelight seem to flare up white 
i feel an impact through the blade 
blind i reel away a step

four small pile of rock glisten each at the head of a hump of earth 
yawn beside the mound on the right be a fifth freshlydug open grave 
somehow i get -PRON- hand down to -PRON- boot where the hideout knife be stash

if not exactly a brave man i have never flee from weapon fire in anger 
but i flee then summon the last vestige of -PRON- feversapped strength 
i turn and flee with a cry past the table with the candlestick which i knock over 
i stagger through the haunted hallway beating on the outer door until i spring -PRON- open

-PRON- donot believe -PRON- -PRON- say tightly 
-PRON- think lie 
-PRON- step forward jerkily -PRON- hand stiffen into talon 
danger hang in the air like an invisible thunderhead kook think kelly real genuine nut 
-PRON- glance around for a possible weapon and quickly settle on a bowlingball which -PRON- snatch from a pile of discard alley equipment 
klobbet continue advance a look of the pure malevolence twist -PRON- face 
kelly bring the ball up hold -PRON- protectively before -PRON- take a step backward trip over something and topple into the box 
-PRON- lie there for a moment daze still hold the ball and look for all the world like a bowling champion in all -PRON- glory about to be lay to rest 
the thing -PRON- hear be victory whoop as a lever be slam down somewhere 
the very last thing -PRON- hear be a flurry of guttural grunting voice 
then a stone axe crack open -PRON- skull and there be nothing dance around the empty box like a drunken gnome beside -PRON- with joy -PRON- work -PRON- chatter 
the first try and -PRON- work magnificent merlin do -PRON- again fifteen minute later -PRON- be not so happy 
something waswrong with the mechanism 
sometimes the thing -PRON- put in -PRON- would disappear presumably come to rest somewhere in the vast continuum of time 
other thing go and come right back again 
and there be thing that appear unbidden from god know where or when 
klobbet shiver with fright at the recollection of the apeman who have start out of the box to attack -PRON- but have accidentally touch a tube that instantly send -PRON- back into the timestream 
-PRON- glower reprovingly at the box as though -PRON- have deliberately spitefully trick -PRON- 
then -PRON- take a screwdriver and make some adjustment 
when -PRON- be satisfied -PRON- rummage through a pile of junk and come up with a stained and scar toiletseat 
-PRON- place this in the box and pull the lever 
the toiletseat vanish and -PRON- give a tentative sigh of relief 
a few second later -PRON- set the dial on and pull the lever again but nothing happen 
then suddenly the box begin to tremble and heave and in another moment -PRON- lurch and spew forth a load of fish that spread out in a wriggling carpet at -PRON- foot 
-PRON- begin to kick at the fish wildly then slip and fall send -PRON- flop all over the room 
-PRON- tear at -PRON- hair in frustration and hiss a stream of poisonous curse proceed to shovel the fish back in the box with -PRON- bare hand 
when -PRON- be finish -PRON- stand up shake with rage scale shimmer in -PRON- hair one fish tail wave feebly from a pocket 
as a final gesture -PRON- fling -PRON- cigar into the box hawk a huge gob of phlegm after -PRON- and slam down the lever 
everything go and didnot come back 
-PRON- sit down light a fresh cigar rest for a moment then grimly seize the screwdriver and go to work again 
presently there be a blind flash and klobbet fall back on -PRON- haunch gaze blankly into the box 
-PRON- be sputter and sizzling wire be jerk and switch snap -PRON- on and off 
deep within the recess of the box scene begin to appear dimly and jerkily make klobbet think of the flicker of -PRON- youth 
-PRON- think -PRON- see a farmer milk a cow a family at dinner a lady on top of a house and other similar domestic scene 
everybody seem to be in early nineteenth century costume 
-PRON- be just get interested when the box give a convulsive shudder and stop -PRON- scene fade 
klobbet yank some wire and twist some tube but nothing happen 
in a state of grow anxiety -PRON- grab a hammer and start to pound the box mercilessly 
still nothing happen 
idiot machine -PRON- shrill and with tear of frustration fill -PRON- eye hurl the hammer into the box and give -PRON- a vicious kick for good measure 
the box rumble protestingly and belch out a dinosaur egg 
klobbet duck and the egg strike the opposite wall break and slither to the floor leave a slimy trail behind 
the box be silent now 
for several minute the in115 ventor and -PRON- creation face one another each wait to see what the other would do next 
tentatively klobbet regard the box 
-PRON- study the wiring briefly change a fuse and bend over to peer inside 
suddenly -PRON- be as though a monster vacuum cleaner have be turn on 
klobbet be suck into the box with a loud vthloop 
five second later -PRON- be spat back into the room water pour from -PRON- clothe reek from wet cigar and exotic perfume and quake with fury 
fiend -PRON- croak at the box 
imbecile 
abortion be sorry -PRON- be ever invent then -PRON- go completely mad 
-PRON- take a wrench and beat the lever permanently into the position then -PRON- begin to pile everything -PRON- could get -PRON- hand on into the box 
a case of empty coke bottle go in flrst 
this be follow by a typewriter 
next go the day delicatessen purchase then a dismantled radio a loaf of stale pumpernickel an empty oil can and a crate of broken household appliance in rapid succession 
the box be have trouble digest everything at once 
-PRON- make plaintive gagging noise 
delight an expression of satanic glee light -PRON- feature klobbet redouble -PRON- effort and jam into the box a bundle of filthy clothe a pair of ragged sneaker and for a crowning touch the overflow garbage pail 
the box be heap mountainhigh with churn refuse 
eventually somehow the box lie empty again wheeze painfully and give an occasional strangle gasp as sudden constriction attack -PRON- inner circuit 
satisfied 
klobbet gloat maliciously 
then chuckle -PRON- deliver the coup de grace 
-PRON- tear out the wire one by one smash the fuse and condenser and splinter the delicate crystal into million of tiny sliver 
calm now sate with revenge klobbet think about the half hour that have elapse since kelly have enter the cabin 
in that short space of time -PRON- have personally singlehande launch aeon of timeborne debris 
at this very moment empty beer can cigar butt dirty sock and soil underwear be float simultaneously past the nose of brontosauri and through the sterile street of antigravity suburb 
an incredible feat spread rubbish up and down through all eternity and -PRON- have do -PRON- alone -PRON- merlin the most the victor stand and contemplate the body of -PRON- vanquished foe

june go on sale at -PRON- newsstand may by world of weird edit by leo margulie page 
pyramid book here be the second of what i trust be go to be an infinite series of paperback anthology from the file of the legendary fantasy magazine weird tale 
seven more story draw from the fertile period when farnsworth wright be still in editorial command make up this new volume 
if -PRON- doesnot quite match the high level of -PRON- predecessor that s not a serious fault in view of the standard set the first time out 
the most powerful story in this volume be valley of the worm by robert howard a littleknown item set in a world of norse mythology 
connoisseur of rugged prose will relish such high moment as this as the heronarrator launch -PRON- climactic attack on the wormmonster the spongy skin yield and give beneath -PRON- foot and i drive -PRON- sword hiltdeep drag -PRON- through the pulpy flesh rip a horrible yardlong wound from which ooze a green slime 
then a flip of a cablelike tentacle flick -PRON- from the titan back and spin -PRON- three hundred foot through the air to crash among a cluster of giant tree 
-PRON- donot make monster like that any more or hero for that matter 
another good one be edmond -PRON- that hath wing which should help to dispel the belief that thirty year ago hamilton be capable of write only formula spaceopera 
this story be move and sensitive with a depth of emotion rarely find in the pulp story of that era 
clark ashton mother of toad be a lovely little chiller less vocabularybound than most of work 
and david deceptively simple the thing in the cellar be still good for a shudder or three even now 
frank belknap giant in the sky though minor be a sciencefiction story whose imagery be often rewarding to the reader 
the two long story in the book attempt more and be not entirely successful at -PRON- 
seabury famous christmas story road have many admirer and i do not feel diposed to criticize -PRON- -PRON- tell the story of a northman name klaus who be present at bethlehem and at calvary and who survive to take on a role in christian mythology -PRON- prose be worthy of -PRON- theme and the notion of a worshipper of odin kneeling before the infant jesus be superb but i be trouble by anachronism in the story and by the fact chat quinn lapse too often into cinematic cliche that mar an otherwise flawless accomplishment 
the last story be nictzin dyalhis the sapphire goddess and i find -PRON- hard to enter -PRON- mood of whimsy 
virgil finlay have contribute illustration for the book most of -PRON- ruin by horrendous reproduction 
a particular highlight be sam moskowitz brief introduction which tell of the founding of wexrd and provide information never see in print before 
the tithetic man by theodore sturgeon page 
pyramid book before the first issue of fantastic appear ziffdavi use to publish a magazine call fantastic thick and raggededged and full of improbable tale 
in the february issue of that defunct magazine there appear a complete novel call the dream jewel by theodore sturgeon whose opening paragraph have rarely be rival for sheer audacity 
-PRON- read -PRON- catch the kid do something disgust out under the bleacher at the highschool stadium and -PRON- be send home from the grammar school across the street 
-PRON- be eight year old then be do -PRON- for year 
the reader who survive that trumpetcall find -PRON- enmesh in a fantasyworld of almost uncomfortable vividness 
the backgiound be carnival life and most of the character be freak but sturgeon never play -PRON- for pure horror nor lapse into the sentimentality that seem to engulf bradbury whenever -PRON- approach similar theme 
the result be one of most successful novel wholly unforgettable 
some time later -PRON- appear in book form under -PRON- present less evocative title and here -PRON- be in a third printing with a handsome new schoenherr cover painting 
there arenot many fantasy novel that match the wild poetry and fevered invention of this one 
get -PRON- 
the spot of life by austin hall page 
ace book last time out i dump some brick on the goofy illwritten novel to which this be the sequel the blind spot

a bit to -PRON- mystification i find that -PRON- be both well and bad than the first 
the blind spot be write by hall in collaboration with homer eon flint and scarcely make sense from one paragraph to the next 
the present book which date from be the work of hall alone 
-PRON- be much more orderly the prose be grammatical if drab and the story line progress neatly toward -PRON- conclusion the trouble too 
the blind spot for all -PRON- monumental flaw have a kind of breathless foolishness about -PRON- that make -PRON- fun to read if -PRON- can find fun in watch author work close to the line of illiteracy 
there be no such fun in the spot of life which plod along from step to step in the unraveling of -PRON- dreary mystery much shorter miss the baroque overelaboration of the early book and lack even the feeble spark of life that one have
