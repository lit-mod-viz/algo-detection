the world war has shown that invisibility is not impossible
it can be obtained in various manners such as by camouflaging
even now science has electrical or electromechanical means to make it possible for an aviator to change the entire color of an airplane for war purposes so that it will merge with the sky
thus from a distance of a few thousand feet it can no longer be seen
pretty soon airplanes will be as noiseless as automobiles and when that happens they will become a terrible menace particularly for war purposes fail to read this story where the author tackles and solves this problem in such an unusual way by henrik dahl juve
of course you remember the silent destroyer by this author and now he has given us a sequel to his former story which in all respects matches the first one and in other respects far eclipses it
for sheer daring and audacity of new scientific reasoning this author stands alone by harl vincent
it is conceded by many that at low altitudes say at feet it will be impossible to fly an airplane faster than about miles an hour if that fast
the air resistance becomes so tremendous at such speeds that the power necessary to operate the aircraft makes the proposition uneconomic
suppose that by some electrical means it were possible to create a vacuum in which the airplane of the future will fly
this is not an impossible thought and you may rest assured that this will come to pass
the author proposes an entirely new scientific thought in this story that is revolutionary
it is one of the biggest ideas that has ever been proposed for aviation
you simply must read this story by romans
in introducing this new author to our evergrowing audience we are certain that they will applaud the new aviation thoughts embodied in this story
based upon excellent science his plane which travels miles in hours or miles an hour is neither preposterous nor impossible

editorial general offices and advertising department park place new york city editorial advertising and general offices park place new york the future of aviation springs from the imagination hugo gernsback literary editor art director associate aviation editors air corps reserve professor aeronautical engineering iowa state college head department mechanical and industrial engineering and professor of aeronautics university of kansas aero
eng
associate professor aeronautical engineering univ of detroit mil
department of aeronautical engineering university of michigan dept
mechanical engineering university of california these aeronautical experts pass upon the scientific principles of all stories by next great development in the art of aviation will no doubt be the rocket flier
every aviator hen knows the limitations of the gasoline engine the disadvantages of the electric ignition system and the often unreliable propeller
the weight of the gasoline engine with its ignition apparatus fuel and of the profiler system usually is as much as that of the rest of the airplane and for that reason engineers for a long time have been trying to evolve something better
it is true that experiments are now being made in all countries to replace the present gasoline engine by means of the diesel engine which requires no electric ignition system neither does it use gasoline the fuel in this case is crude oil
while combustion does take place the firing is not done by electrical means the oil becomes ignited because of the high compression that the diesel engine causes
while this is an advantage and does away with the oftenunreliable electriwl ignition system the developments of diesel engines for airplanes so far have not been very encouraging
the walls of the cylinders for the diesel engine must be so thick in order to withstand the tremendous pressure that not much saving of weight is possible
the next great development undoubtedly lies in the proposed rocket airplane on which extensive experiments are now under way particularly in germany
the rocket apparatus compared to the gasoline engine is a marvel of simplicity there are no moving parts and the weight of the engine is small because it consists only of tubes
as the name implies the rocket device is nothing more or less than a powerful rocket
the firing is usually done by means of a simple electrical apparatus and chemical means could be devised if necessary
the rocket principle is totally different from any other form of propulsion and any one who has ever seen a firework rocket go into the air will understand that the rocket does not rely upon propellers or engines
rather the underlying principle is motion imparted to the rocket by reaction to the expulsion of highlycompressed gases
it is a mistaken notion of some laymen to suppose that a rocket works well only in the atmosphere the reverse is true
the efficiency of the rocket is much better in a vacuum as demonstrated by the experiments of the anjerican physicist goddard of rocketprinciple fame
recently in germany experiments in rocket propulsion were made by max valier who attached a number of electricallyfired rockets to an automobile
the speed obtained from this automobile was greater than that of any vehicle that traveled on rails before
the automobile in this experiment did not run on a dirt track but on steel rails and there were no human beings inside the car the only occupant being a cat such excessive speed was developed that the rockrt automobile jumped the track and wrecked itself incidentally killing the cat of course at present the rocket principle as applied to airplanes is still in the early experimental stage
no airplane has been built with rocket propulsion the reason being mainly that no very satisfactory rocket fuel has been developed
the present fuel consists almost entirely of black powder which when ignited burns very rapidly and gives a tremendous kick tending to move the rocket in the direction opposite to the motion of the exhaust gases
engineers have become satisfied that rocket propulsion will form the basis of the airplane motor of the future
it will not be long until a suitable and efficient fuel will be forthcoming
among one of the rocket fuels mentioned lately by german engineers is liquid oxygen the efficiency of which seems to be very much higher than that of ordinary black powder
fuels such as dynamite nitroglycerine have also been mentioned in the past but so far no means has been found to make them safe and to control the explosions in a desired degree
this however need not frighten us because only years ago if some one had mentioned that you could ride in a car that relied for its power upon gasoline that continuously exploded you would have been most dubious about the sanity of any inventor proposing such a scheme
yet the automobile is a witness that the explosive engine has been in its way a success
of course once a suitable and powerful rocket fuel has been developed as it probably will be within the next twentyfive years the problems of controlling the explosions from the different rockets to a nicety will be easily solved by rocketpropulsion engineers
strange as it may seem it will then be possible to have an airplane that can hover about and practically stand still simply by firing the rocket engines at the desired rate
it will thus just balance the force of gravity exactly as a motorist today can hold his car stationary on a hill by letting his engine run and just getting enough power from the engine to neutralize the force which tends to pull the car down the hill
by member american physical society american association for the advancement of science contemplating the future commercial machine along strictly engineering lines we should be guided by the past history of other endeavors in transportation
the development of the steamship and of the automobile shows us the way
when we compare the first steamboat built by robert fulton and place it side by side with the leviathan we are astonished at the tremendous progress made
there is a similar comparison between the first automobile and the modern auto bus and the same is true of the first locomotive as compared to the presentday monsters
history will repeat itself in the same manner in airplane construction
the planes which we have today will be considered very small and inefficient as in the light of the planes which we will have fifteen or twenty years hence
in the illustration accompanying this article i have endeavored to show some of the possible improvements based strictly upon aviation engineering principles as they no doubt will come about very soon
for some of the suggestions embodied in this article i am indebted to general william mitchell former director military aeronautics army
the plane illustrated is allmetal and has a wingspread of about to feet its total length from propeller to tail is some feet
the machine will probably weigh in the neighborhood of tons or slightly over
accommodations for passengers will be contained entirely inside the metallic wings as shown in the illustration
in order to do away with air friction so far as possible the landing wheels are retracted into the body of the machine the instant the airplane leaves the ground
when a landing is to be made the wheels are lowered into landing position
one of the greatest dangers at the present time in flying at considerable heights and particularly in flying over the oceans is from ice forming on the wings and propeller
this has been the reason for many accidents and many planes have disappeared into the ocean because of ice formations
a way to overcome this rather easily is shown in the illustration the use of electric heaters installed within the wings
the metallic wings can quickly be heated sufficiently to melt the forming ice after which the electric current can be turned off
the writer proposes a novel scheme to keep off the dangerous ice from the propeller
the 30foot allmetal propeller contains within itself tubing into which the exhaust from the engine can be directed whenever it becomes necessary
this will heat the propeller sufficiently to keep ice from forming
during normal conditions the exhaust can of course be diverted in the usual manner
the illustration shows also a large gyroscope for stabilizing the airplane
this becomes necessary in all choppy weather and tends to keep the airplane on an even keel
its use also becomes important when flying in a fog and will prevent the navigators from losing their orientation
but for safety purposes the most important element of the airplane of the future is the multiple power plant
to the writers mind the multipropeller airplane of the present day will not survive in the future
the reason is that neither much safety nor anything else is gained by installing separate power plants with separate propellers for too much additional weight is necessitated thereby
in the illustration is shown a simple remedy and that is to use a single propeller attached to a single shaft to which shaft are coupled a number of separate engines
all these engines operate individually and let us say there are six engines two or more of them can go dead while the others will still give sufficient power to keep the plane aloft
normally three engines are used while three are kept in reserve
repairs can be made on any three engines by the mechanics while the machine is in flight without slowing down the airplane
the engines as will be seen from the illustration are accessible from all sides and are of course also enclosed in the inside of the lower part of the airplane
by the time this airplane will be built there will be many new devices in use such as the alreadydeveloped electriccondenser apparatus for landing in a fog
this arrangement by which a plane itself becomes one plate of the condenser while the earth is the other plate accurately registers upon an instrument in the navigation house the distances of the machine from the ground
this of course is important while flying in a fog
no doubt the airplane of the future will be equipped with huge neon parabolic lights in order to pierce the fog
planes such as that pictured here will be constructed to cover great distances
such planes will make trips from los angeles to new york without stopping while passengers may be taken off or on by small helicopter planes alighting on the back of the large machine as pictured in the illustration
gyroscope courtesy sperry gyroscope comiiany at a word from the leader they loaded the cases into the rear of die plane hatches atop the albatross had been fastened and now there came loud thumpings and shouts from beneath one of these the most uneventful life there sometimes comes a supreme adventure an experience of such breathtaking interest that it fully compensates for all the drabness that has gone before
to roger erskine in his midthirties it seemed that there was nothing that could happen to alter the humdrum routine of his existence
but in this he reckoned without the powerful hand of that intangible mistress of our destinies we call fate
morning after morning for more than twelve years he had passed through the ornate entrance of the new yorkparis airways building at precisely five minutes before nine oclock
true his advancement with the great transatlantic airline had been steady and remunerative
now in the position of vicepresident of engineering his yearly salary ran close to six figures and his power and influence in the organization had become almost supreme
but he was far from contented
since the death of his father in erskine had spent five lonesome years though he maintained the park avenue apartment they had occupied together
deeply immersed in his work he had little time in which to meditate on this lonesomeness or to cultivate outside acquaintances
it was thus that he found time hanging heavily on his hands when his objective had been reached and the more arduous of his duties shifted to the shoulders of a staff of capable subordinates
the new yorkparis airways incorporated in addition to the regular operation of its lines engaged in the manufacture and sale of the huge atrliners used in transoceanic travel
it was in this branchy of the activities of his corporation that erskine specialized for years but now his duties extended to the maintenance and repair of all mechanisms on board the maity liners in regular service as well as to the supervision of design and manufacturing
but in this executive capacity he found somehow a lack of the intense interest that had been his urge during the years of struggle to reach the top of his chosen profession
and now less than a month after being installed in his new position he was inclined to consider the suggestion of john emory chairman of the board that a half year in europe would benefit him greatly and serve as a fitting preliminary to the actual taking over of his new responsibilities
roger his fathers old friend and adviser had warned him you have been working very hard ever since you left college and have enjoyed no recreations to speak of nor have you ever taken a vacation
you will become an old man before your time and will go stale on the job
the company owes it to you and i want you to pack up your duds and wellknown author again comes for ward with a most exciting as well as interesting scienceaviation fiction story
as always this story illustrates the authors knack of keeping your interest at all times
incidentally the excellent situations that he weaves into the story never tax your credulity but somehow or other give the illusion that the story is true to life
and his science is good
this however is not surprising because the author has been an engineer to one of our wellknown electrical industrial corporations
as such he has the necessary experience to know whereof he writes and he never permits himself to go into the of the purely fantastic play around europe for awhile say for six months at least
roger had been taken off his feet by the suggestion
but mr emory he objected no good for that sort of thing
i must keep in the harness or i donot know what to do with myself
suit yourself the clmirman had replied but donot forget what i have told you
and if at any time you should change your mind you have full authority to go ahead and at the companys expense
these words came back to roger now and he drummed the glass top of his large mahogany desk with nervous fingers as he gazed abstractedly through the open window of his office
is that all mr erskine inquired the soft voice of his secretary
oh i beg pardon
miss henderson he apologized with a sheepish laugh with my day dreaming again i completely forgot what we were doing
let me see now where were we
the efficient secretary soon set him straight and the work continued to the end
but his interest had deserted him completely when they had finished
it was and spring was in the air
by george he exclaimed with sudden decision when little miss henderson had tripped from the room going to make that trip
paris vienna rome barcelona the riviera
and i might as well start now before i get too deeply into this new job
he thumped his desk vigorously
and that decision marked the beginning of adventure for roger erskine
the albatross hours later the albatross one of the fast liners tugged at her mooring mast like a spirited hound at the leash
it lacked a half hour of noon her scheduled sailing time and roger gazed with pardonable pride at the silvery length of the dirigible that swung majestically above her long island landing field nose cuddled to the mast yet straining to be away
these giant ships were children of his brain he loved them like children knowing their every caprice their faults as well as their virtues
at the foot of the mast he was saluted by captain anderson
glad to see you mr erskine said the captain heartily
and glad youre crossing with us saw your name on the passenger list this morning
roger grinned delightedly
he had known anderson for a number of years and admired him greatly
thanks cap he replied
glad to see you too
much of a passenger list
no
less than seven hundred this trip
but theres some notables aboard
yes
you bet
half a dozen bank presidents and millionaires not to mention a couple of congressmen and old baron von hofe and his new chorusgirl wife
then besides theres professor ingalls and his daughter
ingalls exclaimed roger
oh thats great wanted for a long while to meet him fix that as soon as we sail
both of you are assigned to my table so it will be easy
but theres something mysterious about ingalls mission abroad
the reporters and cameramen have been hanging around the field all morning trying to get some dope on him but he wonot leave his cabin
roger laughed typical of him from what heard he commented
he must be quite a character
he sure is be surprised when you meet him
funny old duck but has a way of looking at you that makes you feel like a lowgrade moron arrivals were crowding into the lift and roger and the captain joined these in the swift ascent to the waiting vessel
when they emerged from the cage and entered the passageway of the albatross captain anderson pulled roger aside while the other passengers filed past on their way to the cabins on the four decks of the vessel
come to the bridge with me he whispered like to show you how easily she handles with the new controls that have just been installed
willingly roger followed and soon found himself in the midst of the central bridgecontrol mechanisms with which he was so familiar
the helmsman was already at the wheel and through the open windows swept the warm breeze from the ocean
before them curving sharply upward there was the glistening lower surface of the great metal cigar in which was safely imprisoned the gas that provided their buoyancy
to the field nearly three hundred feet below stretched the latticework of the mooring mast swaying gently with the movements of the giant liner tugging at its tip
there came the long blast of a siren from below an answering blast from the albatross the clang of unloosed shackles forward
slowly the mooring mast seemed to drift away from the nose of the huge silvery cigar slowly the landing field rotated beneath them as the seemingly motionless ship was carried from its mooring by the playful breezes
then at a touch of finger there came the throb of the twelve motors and roger knew that a gale of wind was blowing aft through the thousandfoot tunnel which perforated the axis of the huge cigar a gale that created the partial vacuum forward into which they would be drawn with everincreasing velocity
the ship responded to the wheel and they quickly headed across the wind and sped high above the dotted countryside of long island toward the sound
anderson turned to roger with a smile
pretty he asked
perfect
but how does the chief like it oh the engineers are all right
they kicked a bit at first but this bridge controls got it all over the old telegraph system and they soon got wise to the fact that it saved work for them too good
at first we feared there would be trouble
but it seems to be working out fine on all the ships
sure
no reason it shouldnot and now lets get below and wash up a bit show you to your cabin
they crossed the promenade on their way to the lower deck and roger thrilled with a sense of freedom and something of anticipation as he noted that the fishing boats off port jefferson were slipping rapidly astern far beneath them
professor ingalls the eye of the casual observer the figure of professor warren ingalls presented little to attract the attention
small of stature with bandied legs encased in trousers several sizes too large his gait was that of a slouching chimpanzee
he stooped badly and his totally bald head hung from his shoulders at such an angle that one was impelled to look for his eyes in the vastness of that incredibly pink and shining pate
and when he raised his head and peered from beneath his bushy russet brows the object of his gaze if of human mould was quite likely to quail beneath the piercing contemptuous fire that snapped from the most remarkable pair of blueblack eyes in existence
but when he spoke the soft gentility of his voice belied the warning of those eyes while the authority of the words issuing from the slightly twisted lips brought instant attention
roger erskine was thrilled when he found his place at the captains table immediately adjacent to that of the great scientist
he was slightly flustered at the disconcerting stare from those remarkable eyes when the professor gravely acknowledged the captains intro duction of him but his embarrassment heightened to near panic when he was presented to the beautiful girl at the professors other hand
she was his daughter and the most strikingly lovely girl roger bad ever seen
the hardworking young engineer had always shunned the fair sex and he now found himself utterly speechless in the presence of one of its fairest representatives
but the next words of the professor set him somewhat more at ease
are you the erskine of he asked am
professor
rather young for the position of responsibility you recently acquired arenot you the black eyes twinkled with the question
why possibly
by ordinary standards
but you see i have spent twelve years with the organization grew up with it in fact
hm
twelve years
then you donot consider your advancement as anything out of the ordinary
no sir
that is not particularly
in commercial aviation most of us are youngsters you know true sighed the professor wistfully
however some of us older fellows have given it many a boost too
indeed yes replied roger thinking of the twelve oil engines of the albatross whose high thermal efficiency was made possible by one qf ingalls inventions
and do you know the professors voice continued in a soft whisper have the most astounding improvement of all worked out at the present moment
you have asked roger excitedly
what is it
ingalls looked furtively around the table
after dinner he whispered come to my suite and tell you all about it
possibly you can help me too
the thing is so far reaching that dangerous alien fingers are already stretched forth to steal it from me
spies are everywhere
roger looked incredulous but he could not doubt the sincerity of the professors fear
the savants bright eyes had dulled with a glaze of positive terror come professor he said gravely and thank you for the invitation the silvery voice of irene ingalls proved a welcome relief
father she reproved not talking shop with mr erskine are you
the professor looked up guiltily afraid i was my dear he admitted
well you must stop it at once she pouted prettily
and the smile she flashed at roger caused his heart to skip a beat
from there the talk shifted into lighter channels and roger found himself enjoying immensely the company of the professor and his charming daughter
by the time the meal was finished he had completely forgotten the engagement with the father and when the three strolled from the dining room he proposed a turn about the promenade deck
they were about two hours out now and were flying low over cape cod bay approaching provincetown
there was scarcely a breeze and the deck was as steady beneath their feet as the solid ground
the drone of the motors came pleasantly to their ears and the light of the sun reflected from the calm waters below in dancing diamond points of dazzling brilliance
it was a peaceful and beautiful day and it seemed that most of the passengers were on the promenade deck
the professor seemed lost in thought rarely interrupting the conversation carried on so fluently now by his daughter and roger
he displayed little interest in their talk and appeared nervous and irritable
once when they passed a seated group of men he hesitated and peered intently at one whose eyes were hidden behind a pair of large blacklensed goggles
there was a little flurry amongst the passengers on the port side and a group gathered about one of the large observation windows
when they joined this group they found them watching the maneuverings of a large cabin plane that circled and banked in close proximity to the albatross
it was a speedy monoplane and the roar of its single radial motor drowned completely the purr of their own engines
again and again it circled banking steeply as it drew closer to the great liner
then the pilot cut his gun and glided swiftly toward them
it seemed that he must crash into the very window through which they watched spellbound
then he dove sharply and cut underneath out of sight
but in the brief instant of passing the plane had approached so closely that they plainly saw a figure in one of the windows signalling with a handkerchief
roger turned quickly at the sudden grip of a strong hand on his arm
it was the professor and he pointed with his free hand to a crouching figure at an adjacent window
look he said hoarsely
the crouching man sprang from his position and ran with catlike agility for the nearest companionway tucking a white handkerchief into his pocket as he turned
roger did not get a good look at his features but from the fleeting glimpse he did obtain he felt sure that the mans countenance was of decided oriental cast
he signalled the plane breathed the professor in explanation
what does it mean asked roger puzzled
irene ingalls stood by suddenly whitefaced
the passengers talked excitedly of the stunting they had just witnessed
it means said the professor solemnly the enemy is on my trail
we must advise the captain at once
and then my boy like to have that talk with you
a capture listened gravely to the professors account of the happenings of the afternoon
funny professor he said thought you were mighty secretive about this trip and mighty anxious to get away without being seen
but i had no idea you were trying to avoid some danger
is it a question of evading a gang of racketeers or commercial spies who are after this invention of yours
worse than that
captain
a great government is after the secret a government that has been waiting watching planning for years a government that would plunge the world into a war of far greater magnitude than the war of a war that might well mean the end of civilization
anderson sat aghast at the professors earnestness as did roger
but irene seemed not to be surprised she was evidently in her fathers confidence
chinks did you say they are asked the captain
not exactly replied the professor though many of the enemy are of the yellow race
the government i speak of is a secret religious government that plans dominance of the world and with my discovery in their hands with the discoverer removed this would prove a simple matter
this is a religious organization that has sprung up unsuspected during the past fifteen years
religious asked roger blankly exactly
i chanced upon the headquarters of their organization more than five years ago when i made that trip into mongolia and they have followed me and spied on me ever since
but objected the captain these heathens couldnot hope to carry out such a plan
they havenot the money the intelligence nor the man power power exclaimed the professor
why man alive donot you know that more than thirty per cent of the population of the world are of the yellow race you know but his sentence remained unfinished for captain anderson hurled himself from his chair and sprang past the professor so suddenly as to knock him breathless into his chair
roger turned in alarm at sound of a heavy impact and a smothered shriek behind him
anderson had plunged through the open door and now held in his great hairy paws a struggling slanteyed individual who snarled and fought like a wild cat
the captain flung his captive to the floor and bolted the door behind him
irene drew back in distaste
got him grunted the captain delightedly
an hour of vigorous questioning failed to elicit any information from the prisoner
not even with third degree methods of such severity as to bring forth the disapproval of roger and the professor was the captain able to learn anything regarding the confederates nor the mission of the inscrutable yellow man
finally he gave up in disgust and ordered the defiant spy carried below in irons
irene had long since left the captains quarters and roger soon followed the professor to deck and down a corridor to his suite
irene looked up from a novel when they entered
she smiled a wt wanly roger thought
kd the captain learn anything she asked
nothing said her father spreading his hands in a gesture of futility
it is always this way
the authorities seem unable to help us they are absolutely powerless against this organization
when one member is apprehended another takes his place
they have followed us even here
there are more of them on board the girl paled perceptibly
undoubtedly
and all of my paraphernalia my entire secret is right here
they are preparing a desperate effort to obtain it all at one stroke
he pointed at several large ironbound trunks that occupi a corner of the large sitting room of the suite
then he turned to roger speaking rapidly
the secret that would give them control of the world nay of the universe is in those innocent appearing cases
fool that i was to think that i could escape them fool not to have placed my apparatus and my daughter under the protection of our government at home instead of starting on this harebrained attempt to hide in europe but the secret
professor
roger asked fired by the mans intense conviction do not understand
excuse me my boy apologized the energetic little man mopping his brow
please have a seat and explain ft all to you right now
here a cigar
the secret handed a long black stogie to roger and sank into a chair opposite the one he had indicated to his guest
perhaps you consider me a madman he began
in fact i was in doubt as to my own sanity when i first stumbled on the discovery these fiends are after
but it is all there in those cases indisputable proof that i can duplicate at any time
the secret of the universe is there all the dreams of the ancient alchemists come true the transmutation of elements the annihilation of energy all are now possible
you mean you mean you have learned how to disintegrate the atom precisely
listen the albatross carries twelve engines of two thousand horsepower capacity
for all their high efficiency they consume fourtenths of a pound of lowgrade oil per hour for each horsepower they turn out
nearly one hundred and seventyfive tons of fuel are thus needed to complete the thirtysixhour journey from new york to paris
the engihes themselves for all their superior design weigh considerably more than a pound per horsepower rating another fifteen tons
think of the payload sacrificed with atomic motors of less than a tenth of the weight of your modified diesels and with no fuel weight whatsoever the journey could be made in less time and at a cost of not more than ten dollars an hour for power a total fuel cost less than that of a single firstclass passage
by a simple adaptation of my process nitrogen extracted from the atmosphere as we progress could be used as fuel in the atomic motors the destruction of its atoms in especially constructed chambers providing the nearly free energy
roger stared agape
but can this be definitely controlled he asked
absolutely
and the derivation of power is but one of the uses to which my discovery can be put
that is where the danger lies if it falls into unscrupulous hands
thp energy can be controlled from a distance
battleships airplanes whole cities could be wiped out of existence in the twinkling of an eye and at the simple pressure of a button cosmic rays are the basis of the secret
cosmic rays
yes
that is the results are accomplished by selecting them and after sorting and redirecting them putting them to work
to fully understand you must fix firmly in your mind the postulate that nothing exists excepting energy
there is no ultimate solidity or substance to anything
the earth man light heat electricity are composed of the same thing
the universe consists of emptiness charged with electrical energy
and matter as we know it is forever changing form forever shifting its tiny charges of energy and evolving itself into another form though the process is generally so slow as to be imperceptible
out in the nearvacuum of interstellar space there are tremendous energy reactions that give birth to atoms and thereby produce the cosmic rays which are the most penetrating and powerful known to science
the rays are produced in several forms in fact in as many as eighty forms each dependent on the birth of a particular type of atom
one is generated when atoms of helium gas suddenly organize themselves out of the electrcms and protons that wander through space others accompany the birth of silicon hydrogen or caesium atoms and so on
each ray has an identity and a use of hs own when brought under control and of course i have so far only skimmed the surface there are but seven types i have identified and controlled
my first inkling of the tremendous possibilities in the way of utilizing the rays came during that mongolian trip
my party was in the khangai mountains and we had sunk an electroscope to a level feet below the surface of a small lake known as zagan nor
the rays risfered powerfully and came through in different spectroscopic bands answering to the syntheses of certain of the elements
this set me thinking and i soon isolated the ray corresponding to the element hydrogen whose atom is simplest of all
i endeavored to determine the reaction of the ray by placing in its path a minute quantity of hydrogen sealed in a small capsule
nothing happened at first and i experimented with collecting and redirecting a great volume of these particular rays all of which concentrated on the tiny capsule of hydrogen
i stepped from the field laboratory to call an assistant and thereby saved my own life for i had no sooner closed the door when there was a terrific explosion within and the shack was blasted to smithereens with a roar that knocked me flat and bruised my body severely
that was the beginning
you see for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and i had obtained the reaction equal to the birth of a definite number of hydrogen atoms far off in space
energy it is everywhere
and to it alone we owe our existence
unfortunately the following experiments were watched by a number of the native members of my party and of course they reported to what i later learned was the headquarters of this secret religious council
thanks to them our existence is now threatened by the danger of my energycontrol discovery getting into their hands
roger gasped
it seems impossible
professor he said
but i have not the slightest doubt of your words
and you say elements have actually been transmuted in this manner
yes
i have takea uranium the heaviest element in the atomic scale and from it have produced successively lead by removing ten protons from its nucleus gold by removing thirteen and hydrogen by removing ninetyone
all elements can be transmuted into others by a similar process
then these mongolians would be able to provide themselves with anything they need to make war on the rest of the world
easily but donot misunderstand me as to who these enemies are
this is a yellow peril we are facing because the central stronghold of the enemy is among the yellow races
the war would probably represent a struggle with about sixty per cent of the yellow race aligned with forty per cent of the white race against the remaining sixty per cent of the white race and forty of the yellow
it is to be entirely a religious war
you see the buddhists now include the confucianists the taoists and the shintoists
they have a foothold in all countries and among all races though most powerful in the orient
they the professor stopped short in his discourse for at that moment the lights flickered then went out leaving them in almost total darkness
the doors to the sleeping rooms were closed and the sole illumination came from the narrow rays of light from the portholes that filtered underneath
irene stifled a scream
then roger experienced a tingling of the scalp
his hair seemed to be rising on end for on the opposite wall there appeared as if by magic a squat potbellied smiling buddha wreathed in eerie green luminescence
a daring robbery the lights reappeared as suddenly as they had been cut off the three occupants of the room stared at one another in wonder
what kind of tomfoolery is this exploded roger
but the professor merely stared and stared at the corner of the room
his eyes seemed to bulge from their sockets
the ironbound cases containing his apparatus were gone
irene rubbed her eyes in startled amazement
why daddy she exclaimed the trunks have disappeared
how do you suppose they did that
her fathers eyes dulled hopelessly and he shrugged his shoulders resignedly
it is beyond me dear he replied but theyre gone and i guess that is the end of it
but objected roger nothing supernatural about this
professor stolen them by entering this room through a trapdoor or a sliding panel or something get the captain and investigate
surely your personal property can be recovered it is still on board this vessel
you do not appreciate the cleverness of the enemy my boy
but your suggestion is a good one
i shall call the captain
a thorough search directed by the captain and his first officer revealed no clue as to the means used in removing the missing cases from the room
careful soundings of the walls floor and ceiling and examination of the joints of these partitions showed not the slightest evidence of their having been disturbed
well said anderson finally giving it up as a bad job it certainly seems that some means other than physical were resorted to in removing the precious trunks
but have every cabin on board searched this evening
meanwhile we should be dressing for dinner
what exclaimed rogers not nearing dinner time
surely said the captayii consulting his watch it lacks but fourteen minutes of the hour
but but the professor stammered that is impossible
we spent not more than an hour on the promenade and can have been here no more than an hour since we left your quarters
captain
it is fully three hours since you left my cabin
professor
the captain frowned in perplexity while roger and his new found friends stared at one another in wonder have it suddenly exclaimed the professor
that buddha it was a hypnotic trick
i have heard of such things in the orient
that image was somehow projected on our wall and in staring at it we were subjected to a state of mechanically induced hypnosis which permitted the enemy to work without our conscious knowledge
we may well have been under the influence for two hours without knowing it and the trunks were carried through the door while we stared at the green buddha with fixed and sightless eyes
right said the captain
like some of the tricks of the indian fakirs
and say an indian in the very next cabin a supposed nobleman who is booked as sidi mahavira
he rushed to the corridor and soon opened the door of the adjoining cabin with his master key
the room was empty but a hasty search of the occupants baggage disclosed a miniature stereopticon with a curled section of the film used in place of slides in these small projection lanterns your buddha said anderson as he held the strip of film to the light
the case against sidi mahavira was complete
further search revealed the tiny hole which had been drilled in the partition to permit of projecting the image to the wall of the professors room
this was plugged by means of a small cork colored to match the enamel of the metal partition
the first officer also discovered a snap switch and temporary wiring that had been used to control the lights in the adjacent cabin
so gloated the captain another of them mr mahavira or whatever your name is
and well have you in irons directly
but the professors trunks were not in the room and it was decided to postpone the search for these until after dinner
the war is on he evening meal was consumed in unwonted silence at the captains table and many of the diners who had crossed with him before whispered in astonishment at the preoccupation of their usually jovial host
the professor was nervous and ill at ease and roger stole occasional anxious glances at the blanched features of irene
four hours later every stateroom and cabin of the albatross had been searched
the baggage hold was carefully examined and the crew was at work shifting the cargo in the freight compartments
but no trace of the missing trunks had been found
sidi mahavira was strangely missing and the captain was completely mystified
at the approach of midnight with the lights of st johns in newfoundland just vanishing astern roger and the captain were joined by the professor and irene at a point just about amidships of a deck immediately below the trapdoor of one of the wells that extended up to the top between the gas bags of the huge cigar above them
might they have escaped up through here asked roger pointing to the circular trapdoor possible conceded the captain though not probable
it is a long climb up the ladder through these wells and the top is not the safest place to be when we are speeding along at over a hundred miles an hour
they would have had to haul the cases up there with ropes and it hardly seems this could have been done undetected
but objected roger there is the forward well connecting with the lookout platform on top
that one is equipped with a lift right roger
but that one is guarded
true
but suppose we take a look at it
they proceeded along the passage and turned into a niche just forward of the radio cabin
the guard who should have been stationed at this point was missing this exclaimed anderson something has happened here at that he touched with his finger a spot on the immaculate enamel of the bulkhead and brought it away stained red
blood he shouted murdered one of my men
by god fix em
he tore at thejatch of the trapdoor overhead and it quickly swung downward revealing the long black shaft above
the cage of the lift was at the top it should have been below
at his manipulation of a starting lever on the wall the pulleys at the lower end of the shaft started revolving and the watchers knew that the had started its descent
the captain drew his automatic and climbed the short ladder into the compartment at the bottom of the well
stay there folks he ordered until i make sure the coast is clear
in silence they watched as the cage came to rest and the captain gently lifted the body of a uniformed man into the compartment alongside
calkins he said sadly shot through the heart
poor devil
now your war is my war
professor
there was a sound in the passage behind them and roger wheeled suddenly to find himself looking into the muzzle of a blue automatic
hands up snapped the voice of the darkskinned individual whose grinning face appeared behind the gun
the passage was filled with men there must have been ten of them and each carried a weapon ready for instant use
then there came a roar from above and one of the yellowskinned gunmen screamed and pitched forward to the floor
roger pulled irene into his arms as the captains automatic spoke rapidly
the din in the narrow passage was terrific as the automatics of the attackers answered the lone one overhead
then all was quiet and through the acrid blue smoke roger saw that the captain was sprawled over the body of his erstwhile petty officer calkins
the professor had backed into the comer hands raised above his head
well he snapped why donot you shoot and get it over with
oh no my dear professor sneered the leader of the gang are entirely too useful
your life and those of your daughter and mr erskine are to be spared for a higher purpose
please be so good as to mount the ladder and enter the cage
the professor stormed and roger raged but to no avail
it was with keen satisfaction that roger noted that the captain had accounted for three of the enemy before he fell
irene shuddered and cowered at his side but was considerably relieved at knowing that her fathers life was in no immediate danger
come now again snapped the leader prodding them into action with the muzzle of his automatic into the cage going on top
there was nothing to do but comply and they were soon crammed into the small car with the seven orientals
at the top they emerged on the lookout platform and there in the light of the leaders flashlight they made out the cases that contained the professors apparatus
overhead there came the throb of motors that entirely drowned out the musical purr of the engines of the albatross
roger strained his eyes as the sound drew near and quickly made out the flickering of landing lights that seemed to dart here and there above them with the uncertain wavering of fireflies
the leader grunted a command and the ships floodlights sprang into dazzling brilliance illuminating the landing space atop the albatross to the brightness of day
it suddently dawned on roger that the purr of the great dirigibles engines had ceased evidently the enemy had found means of choking the fuel lines
and an airplane was about to land on the top of the great liner of the air the professor speaks out the albatross swung about with the wind gradually she lost headway while the airplane above circled lower and lower
in a surprisingly short time the landing was made the huge cabin plane suddenly swooping down out of the biasness into the brilliance of the runway atop the dirigible
the roar of its three motors had ceased abruptly and the plane dropped to a perfect threepoint landing at the far end of the runway then came toward them and was brought to a sudden stop alongside the lookout platform brakes screaming in protest
two doors opened and from the first tumbled the pilot a white man and apparently an american
from the rear door stepped two of the short orientals and at a command from the leader they quickly loaded the professors cases into the rear compartments of the planes body
all hatches atop the albatross had been fastened from the outside and there now came loud thumpings and shouts from beneath one of these
inside ordered the leader prodding roger with his gun
they were no sooner inside the cabin than the wheel chocks were removed and the plane was swung around by the men outside
the leader thrust the three captives into a small compartment similar to that on a standard pullman car and slammed and locked the metal door
but there was a window and they watched as the plane taxied to the aft end of the runway and was then swung around once more to head into the light wind
there was the throbbing roar of the motors the men outside clambered in and with a quick short run and a sharp rise they zoomed over the lookout platform and were off
well said irene looking from her fathers drawn he abore illustration is a reproduction of a drawing wbich appeared in the september issue of the electrical experimtnter
it is interesting to note that mr gemsback predicted this type of machine which the author of this story has also made use of
moreover we understand that such a machine is about to be tried out very soon
the idea in a few words may be summarized as follows the zeppelin type of airship has now an exterior power plant which is underslung beneath the airship
mr gemsback has created a huge wind tunnel and installed the engines at various points in the tunnel
this arrangement creates a terrific suction and the airship literally sucks itself through the atr
the advantages claimed by mr gemsback are that wind resistance from the power plants is done away with and accidents like that which recently befell the graf zeppelin when several of the power plants went out of commission are not likely to happen in this arrangement
it should be easier to navigate an airship of this kizia because the windthrust against the underhung propellers of the old type is wholly wanting
furthermore the power plants ate protected from the elements and repairs can be made with comparative ease while the airship is in flight and pallid features to the grimness of this is quite different from the trip we had planned
i wonder what is to become of us
the professor seemed incapable of speech but expression changed to one of worried abstraction and he appeared to be speaking his thoughts aloud as he replied
it is a peculiar procedure he said can understand their reasons for sparing your fathers life quite likely they are not sure they can completely solve his secret without instruction from him
but you i canot see why they want to bring you along
nor myself
what good we can be to them is beyond me
if they intend to kill us they might have done it more quickly and easily before we left funny
professor ingalls eyes recovered their former luster and snap never tell them he averred
without certain information i have kept securely locked in my own brain they are helpless
the apparatus is there to be sure but without my aid it is useless to them
i shall not permit them to plunge our world into the hell of a devastating war even though my own life is forfeit
roger pursed his lips
he thought he understood now why they had kidnaped irene they would use threats against her to coerce the old man but he did not voice his fears
he still was unable to account for his own presence aboard the swiftly flying plane
the albatross was left far behind and its lights receded rapidly finally being lost to view as the great cabin plane of the enemy climbed higher and sped continually in what roger took to be a northwesterly direction
wonder where theyll take ivs he ventured
not to china i hope said irene
no said the professor do not believe we are going that far yet
they have divisional headquarters throughout the world and will undoubtedly take us to the nearest
this just goes to show how inefficient and slowmoving our government is
more than four years ago i reported my findings during the mongolian expedition and i have been hammering at it ever since
of course i did not report the results of my experiments since they were still in an uncompleted state
but i have repeatedly warned the authorities and suggested an investigation of the activities of the enemy in our own country
what have they done
nothing
either they think i imagined the whole thing or else they have just tabled my reports and recommendations and forgotten it as the idle dream of a crazy old scientist
now when they get the reports from the albatross some action may be forthcoming perhaps
he spoke bitterly and a silence ensued
the steady thrum of the motors was muffled by the soundproof walls and the double windows so that conversation in an ordinary tone of voice was not difficult
but the prisoners did not converse at any great length for the next hour
each was occupied with his own thoughts and these were not particularly hopeful or pleasant
irene worried about her father and he was in an agony of spirit as he came to the realization of what horrors might befall his cherished daughter at the hands of the conscienceless barbarians who had captured them
roger thought mainly of the girl also a shiver of dread came over him at thought of her fragile beauty in the clutches of such creatures as had murdered the captain and calkins
the possible catastrophe to the world gave him scarcely a thought
a threat here was the rattling of a key in the lock and the professor stiffened himself to tense expectancy
irene turned her head and professed to be extremely interested in the moonlit waters beneath them plainly visible through the window at which she sat
roger leaned protectingly forward interposing as much of his body as was possible between the door and the girl
but it was a white man who entered and he smiled cheerily as he looked directly at roger
he closed the door softly behind him and shot the bolt
hello erskine he said
tom patton exclaimed roger springing to his feet
what on earth brings you among these cutthroats and kidnapers
their visitor laughed
irene surveyed him with interest
he was a welldressed young man about age with a massive head set between the shoulders of a pugilist
his broad features held much of attractiveness but there was a sinister gleam in his eye and a sarcastic twist to his smile that belied the friendliness of his geeting
you insult my friends erskine he laughed
they are not cutthroats nor are they as bad as you are implying
true you three have been taken from the albatross without your consent but there are many good reasons for this procedure and in the end you will all thank us for it
might as well be on the winning side you know not surprised at your being identified with them coolly retorted roger
you always managed to get in with the worst element at college and since
irene and the professor listened in astonishment
the animosity displayed by roger gave them little hope of receiving help from this white man
tom patton devoured irene with his eyes and a flush of shamed embarrassment chased the pallor from her cheeks
you are unkind erskine he smirked and you should endeavor to conquer this feeling now of all times
i have much power with the gautamans and can make things much easier for you if i so desire
the gautamans interrupted the professor
yes
after gautama buddha founder of the religion
you a buddhist asked roger in mock solemnity
then there came an astounding thing a wink intended as a sly grimace but actually contorting the face of patton into a gruesome sembknce of that of the popular conception of his satanic majesty
irene turned cold
no not exactly erskine old top he drawled
but allied mind you i say allied with the gautamans for our common good wager its a onesided arrangement grunted roger
patton scowled
snap out of it erskine he snarled
you are in my power and theres been about enough of this
and i warn you to be more civil and to submit gracefully or things will go much harder with all of you
roger observed his greedy glance in direction and perforce subsided
now continued their evilly grinning captor know you are curious so i am going to advise you as to your fate
we are now entering davis strait and by morning will be somewhere over grant land or sverdrup island
by ten oclock we shall have reached our destination an uncharted island in the arctic ocean
here are the north american headquarters of our organization and it is from this base we are to operate with your assistance
with our assistance snapped the professor
yes
with your assistance yours and think we are unprepared to force this assistance
we have many means many very persuading and always successful means
you professor are to instruct our scientists in the uses of your marvelous invention using the equipment now stored in the tail of this ship
you my dear old college chum are to assist in building up our air fleet which is to become the most dangerous in the world
if we refuse said roger his eyes flashing fire not refuse smiled patton confidently
the professor started to expostulate but was quickly waved into silence
patton approached irene and she looked up at him fearfully
and the beautiful young lady he continued with an ugly leer see well see
with this cryptic and disquieting remark he turned on his heel and left the room again locking the door from the outside
they gazed helplessly at one another after he had left
taking stock hey slept fitfully during the night making themselves as comfortable as possible in the thinly upholstered seats
it grew quite cold toward morning and roger tiptoed to the side of irene who partly reclined on the single settee covering her thinly clad body as best he could with his own coat
the professor stirred and opened his eyes
what is the time my boy he asked
the professor sighed and sat erect was sure it was much later he whispered rising and walking stiffkneed to the window
he grimaced at the pains in his joints
not as young as i used to be he concluded gravely
roger smiled at the comical expression on his countenance
there was a peremptory knock at the door and irene was startled into wakefulness
damn ejaculated roger under his breath
then he drew the bolt he had so uselessly shot after leaving
one of the orientals entered with a tray
breakfast he stated laconically not going to starve us at any rate commented roger when the door closed behind their early visitor
might the food not be drugged asked irene endeavoring to rearrange her glossy hair think not dear responded her father
they wish to keep us alive and well for a time at least
and the coffee did smell inviting
irene flushed slightly and whispered a thank you when she discovered she had been covered by coat and handed the garment to him
they were not long in consuming the tasty and generous portions and with the coming of the warmth that followed the turning on of the electric heat from somewhere outside their small room they felt more comfortable
it was not long before they were again visited by patton and this time he brought with him several magazines which he presented to irene with a great show of solicitude
roger could have punched his smirking face but he contented himself with thrusting his hands in his pockets and gazing from the window at the unbroken ice field that now glistened far beneath them ahead of schedule volunteered patton pleasantly
be there in two hours now
good pilot we have harry borden
by the way erskine hes a new york boy like him
yes said roger not deigning to turn around
yes
and youll all need warmer clothing when we land see that you are outfitted
he retreated without further speech and this time he did not lock the door
evidently he had no fear of any action the captives might take
roger gritted his teeth in helpless rage
the professor tried to estimate their position from what patton had told them the preceding evening
let me see now he said sverdrup island which he mentioned lies in about ninety degrees longitude west from greenwich
it extends above eighty degrees north latitude
grant land which he also mentioned is farther east and extends to about eightythree degrees north
we have passed whichever we crossed so we may assume that we are at about one hundred degrees west and say eightyfive north
why good lord three thousand miles from where we were picked up
and in little more than eight hours he stared at roger openmouthed
yes i knew this was a very fast ship said roger
there are a few of these big monoplanes that can do five hundred miles an hour when above thirty thousand feet
but the friction objected the bewildered professor the loss of propelling effect in the rarer atmosphere
i must be sadly out of date since i have been sticking so closely to the laboratory
some very recent developments are responsible
professor smiled roger
new ideas in streamlining and in lubrication of the external surfaces have reduced friction enormously
then besides on ships of this sort the propellers are supplemented by the reactive effect of a multitude of rapid explosions in gunlike tubes beside the tail
sort of a rocket action you know had not heard that was being commercially used
i surely am behind the times
oh not so far
professor
to my knowledge there were no more than six of such ships in existence
and what puzzles me now is how one of the few came into the possession of these gautamans or whatever they call themselves
evidently they have made rapid strides since i first learned of their existence
and they must have on their side some wealth and some scientists as well
it seems that way
and i am wondering whether such alliances were made by force as they propose to obtain our services
not necessarily
there are a whole lot of fools in this world roger
also there are many conscienceless men of wealth and influence who will go into any kind of venture that gives promise of increasing their already swollen hoard
and somehow this idea of a religious war strikes me as a bit of irony especially as directed against our own country
we who have been at the mercy of the fanatics for so many years are now threatened by fanatics of a different kind whose prohibitions and rituals while of a greatly different sort would prove equally irksome and quite probably as flagrantly ignored
roger nded a thoughtful agreement
the arrival hey were interrupted by the entrance of a slinking brownskinned hunchback who was loaded down with heavy clothing
there were warm furlined boots for all fur caps coats and mittens
mr patton said the brown coat is for the lady said the deformed one as he sidled from the door
irene picked up the garment indicated and was astonished to find that it was fashioned from the finest sable and was beautifully tailored and lined
she held the handsome coat to her face and buried her cheek in its rich softness exclaiming aloud delightedly
roger successfully repressed a snort
these gautamans he remarked to the professor to hide his rage at patton speak very good english whatever their color
almost without accent too
probably all educated in our own universities was the response
another bit of irony
there was a change in the note of the motors and the staccato rattle of the reaction tubes ceased
they were slowing down and the angle of the floor told them of the start of the glide to a lower altitude
they crowded to the single window
far below spread the vast almost unbroken expanse of the ice field drearily monotonous
for some considerable time they saw nothing to break the monotony
then when they had reached a point only a few thousand feet above the broken surface the plane was banked and started to circle
a minute later they saw their destination a rugged island a single mountain peak it seemed that thrust itself upward through the ice to a height of fully two thousand feet
there were no signs of life on the steeply sloping sides but at the top there was a flat space on which there appeared a modern landing field and a number of hangars
they do not seem to fear discovery remarked roger
no agreed professor ingalls
right out in the open
but then we are a long way from civilization off the regular air lanes so there is very little danger
yes and there are disappearing guns under that innocent appearing surface came the voice of patton who had slipped into the room unobserved
roger bit his lips to hold back the retort that sprang to them unbidden
it was too early to start trouble
swiftly they descended the circle becoming ever smaller as the pilot brought his ship to the level of the polar retreat
they could plainly see the sock as it swelled to the breeze indicating the direction of the wind at the surface
a moment later they had touched with scarcely a jolt and rolled across the field to a stop
better get into those wraps advised patton not be in the air for long but its fortythree below out there so youll need the furs
without protest they bundled themselves into the clothing he had provided and were soon at the door of the cabin
the rest of the passengers and the crew had already quitted the ship but patton handed them from the exit with mock courtesy
he was especially considerate of irene
welcome to new kurja he exclaimed as their first breath on the strange soil drew in the searing frostiness of the unbelievable cold
a group of heavily furred individuals was gathered about the entrance of the building toward which they were led by patton and it was necessary for them to run the gauntlet of the gaping jabbering crowd
irene clung to the arm of her father on the one side and to roger on the other burying her face in the huge collar of her fur coat
roger was conscious of a sea of staring faces some white some brown some yellow
then they were within the building and were hustled to a waiting lift
chandra dai hey descended rapidly for many hundreds of feet and eventually stepped from the cage into a brightly lighted corridor
patton led them through this corridor to a small metal door which he opened and passed through without ceremony
instead of a templelike interior the shrine of the buddha which they had fully expected to enter they found themselves in a large room that might well have been the office of a great american business executive
at a large desk that was placed in the exact center of the heavy chinese rug which covered the middle of the floor there sat a man a man who but for the slightly darker complexion and the exceedingly glossy black hair and mustache might have been that very executive
he looked up inquiringly at the approach of patton
they are here chandra dai stated that worthy in a most surprisingly deferential tone
it is well
the sinister black eyes surveyed them with cold calculation resting long on the figure of irene who had thrown back her heavy coat iri the warmth of the underground quarters
roger made as if to speak but was silenced by a stern look and a warning motion of chandra hand
that same hand with its longpointed fingers strayed to a roy of buttons on the desk top
three of these he pressed in turn then he spoke
you will all three proceed to your quarters he said in a steely voice where your instrurtions will be given you in a short time
do not attempt resistance for it is useless and will cause much unpleasantness to yourselves
we shall come to a complete understanding within the hour
he smiled meaningly as he concluded
a giant negro unclad with the exception of trousers and shoes had entered the room
chandra dai pointed to the professor as if designating an unimportant article of furniture
ben sair he addressed the negro take him to and there await instructions
the professor bowed his head and hesitatingly followed the big black man
irene cried out and made as if to follow
fear not
miss ingalls came the voice of chandra dai with an almost feline purr no harm will come to your father nor to yourself
you must only obey orders
irene tossed her head but forebore replying
a heavyfeatured white woman who had entered unobserv stepped to her side
she was a veritable amazon and irene recoiled at the touch of her hand
come young lady boomed the voice be scared of molly cork take ye to your rooms
irene followed as had her father throwing a glance of encouragement to roger as she passed him
another arrival appeared in the form of the young chap who had left the pilots seat of the raiding plane when it landed atop the albatross
he was a smiling faced chunky individual and roger took an immediate liking to him
borden came the voice of chandra dai you will escort mr erskine to and remain with him until further orders reach yofu
that is all
he turned his attention to patton who had drawn near and roger followed the quick rolling steps of harry borden as he led the way to a door at the far end of the room
they passed through a long corridor entered a lift and were dropped several hundred feet deeper into the recesses of the strange honeycombed mountain
when at length they reached the quarters that were to be he expressed his amazement to his comically grinning guide and guard
these must be tremendous workings we are in he exclaimed canot conceive of this retreat being the work of human hands
you donot know the half brother grinned borden
this is some joint youve come to about fifteen thousand people housed here and this old hollowedout mountain they call new kurja is bigger than one of those new hundredstory skyscrapers in new york factories too and arsenals and a church a temple i mean
forceful persuasion oger gazed at his guide in amazement
the rooms to which he had been assigned would have done credit to the finest of firstclass hotels and everything had been provided for the comfort of the occupant
but i donot get it borden he said
does this place form a headquarters for these gautamans and are you one of them
harry borden indulged in a broad grin and a significant wink
sure it belongs to them and one of them
but say this buddhism business is the bunk
this is an armed camp and is here for no other reason than to prepare for the big war
the religious is just camouflage
you mean the plans are not really for a religious war but for a plain war of conquest to satisfy somebodys lust for power and empire about the size of it
but the buddhist idea is at the bottom of it all
the way i get it it is something like the old crusades of medieval history
the religion of buddha originated in india as a heresy quickly gaining a strong foothold and spreading throughout the orient finally it died out pretty much in india but became very strong in china and japan
between the fifth and ninth centuries the buddhists underwent great persecution in china and in the ninth century they amalgamated in japan into the the dual shinto
the rituals have altered greatly since that time but the faithful have constantly increased in number and have spread all over the world though this is hardly suspected in countries
buddhism never fully recovered from the great persecution of the ninth century in china when temples and monasteries of the religion were razed
neither has it ever forgotten and for many years a revenge has been planned
india is to be conquered and forced to again enter the fold the east russia europe the americas are to follow
buddhism is to be established as the world religion compulsory of course
but the dream of the true believers has been commercialized by clever politicians and shady financial interests of all lands and it is to really work out as a huge world revolution that will take the power out of the hands of the ins and put it in the hands of the outs
an absolute monarchy is to be set up and all the world is to become subservient to a supreme lama who will be none other than the name remained unspoken for there was an angry buzz from an instrument adjacent to the writing desk and harry hastened to this apparatus
he touched a lever and the voice of chandra dai spoke sharply
dial it commanded and show erskine the happenings on the screen
the voice ceased and borden manipulated a dial like that of an automatic telephone
a screen of about two feet in length and slightly less height illuminated brightly and showed in clear relief the interior of a laboratory of considerable size where sat professor ingalls before a long bench on which there were arrayed a multitude of scientific instruments and much paraphernalia
strewed on the floor were the professors opened cases and a litter of excelsior and torn paper showed the haste with which they had been unpacked
over the professors stooped form leaned the sinister figure of chandra dai
will you agree
professor he asked in silken tones
never chandra dai spoke sharply to ben sair whose great bulk stood propped against the near wall of the laboratory
the slide beni he ordered
then the huge negro drew back a panel of the wall and roger let forth a yell of fury that rang out simultaneously with the shriek that came from the professors throat
the panel opened into a brightly lighted room boudoir where the panic stricken girl retreated before the menacing figure of tom patton
she drew her negligee about her slim body and screamed again and again as the evil face of patton neared her own
my god groaned roger as the professor slumped weakly into his chair
can nothing stop them agree replied borden soothingly
watch the scene and the sounds issuing from the combined voicetelevision apparatus impressed themselves indelibly in memory screams and the sheer terror in her face caused him to seethe with fury fingers were now twisted in the folds of her filmy garment he seemed about to tear it in shreds
professor ingalls shaking as with the ague nodded violently to indicate his consent
he was too overcome to speak
stop patton called chandra dai
irene slumped to the floor as her assailant turned on his heel and left the boudoir
ben sair closed the panel slowly
you win came the professors voice faintly start with the disintegration of hydrogen atoms
he reached for a stoppered test tube
turn days passed and roger had not yet been approached with regard to his own expected espousal of the cause of the gautamans
harry borden remained with him constantly and his liking for the cheerful pilot increased hourly
but he found it difficult to obtain further information from him regarding the activities of chandra dai and his followers
he did learn that harry was a fugitive from justice having become embroiled in certain smuggling and hijacking operations in the states
but borden had evidently been warned against speaking too freely regarding the plans of the gautamans
perhaps he was not as well informed himself as might be
only at meal time did he see the professor though he was permitted to visit with irene more often
the meals excellently prepared and served were eaten in a small dining room where chandra dai presided at table
he seemed bent on keeping the three captives under his watchful eye and continued to dine with them in private
his manners were those of the cultured host rather than of the stem jailer and he steadfastly refused to speak of their incarceration or of the reasons for it
to irene he was the personification of courtesy and gallantry he was a bit too attentive roger thought
the professor spoke not at all of the experiments that were under way in the laboratories of new kurja
he seemed to shrivel and wilt beneath their eyes when they addressed him
his great spirit was broken for the sake of safety he had sacrificed honor and prostituted his scientific knowledge to the greed of an infamous horde of criminals
irene brooded and fretted over the all too apparent failure of his general health and vigor
there came a day when chandra dai spoke abruptly of his plans for roger
erskine he said at the noonday meal yours is to be a great honor
you are to become commanderinchief of the air forces of the gautamans under your able direction this air force is to grow from its present nucleus to the greatest and most destructive in the world
if i refuse
the master smiled
that you will not do he stated confidently
as you observed in the case of the professor we have means of overcoming the scruples of ordinary mortals
no youll not refuse
and you must not think that in your goings to and fro in our aircraft you will be able to escape
every craft you occupy will be constantly watched in our television screens and at the first evidence of treachery the gas tank will be fired by radio
we are already fully equipped to do these things
if i agree
you will immediately set about inspecting and testing our present equipment and formulating plans for the altering of the present craft to incorporate the new disintegratingray apparatus we are developing with the professors assistance
you will also supervise the design of new and speedier craft that will utilize the atomic motor likewise being developed with the professors kind assistance
your experience has fitted you for the further work of organizing a number of factories throughout the world to produce in great quantities the new craft to be developed by you to supervise the training of instructors who will in turn make firstclass pilots of the required number of recruits
then when the great day comes yours will be the honor of directing the activities of the great fleet that is to bring destruction to the world from the air
roger gasped
you expect me to wage a war of destruction against my own people
to assist the enemy whose cause i cannot embrace in a ruthless campaign against those i love and honor
there is no alternative save perhaps hari kari
and we shall guard carefully against that possibility
is it not better moreover to destroy than to be destroyed a hot retort sprang to tongue but the pro210 lessor not looking np from his plate kicked his ankle violently under the table
he choked back the impulse and hastily swallowed a portion of food to hide his rage
the master watched him narrowly
this afternoon he continued you will make a flight in one of our small pursuit planes paying particular attention to its flying qualities and construction
i shall expect a report of your findings and recommendations as to the changes of design necessary to adapt these planes to the new motive power and armament
borden will accompany you
might i go alo asked irene
chandra dai smiled at her indulgently
these pursuit planes are not large enough for three passengers he explained
besides they have cqen cockpits and it would be very cold
irene pouted coaxingly
but i would so enjoy the ride she begged
the professor broke into the conversation
it would do her worlds of good chandra dai he said kicking ankle once more to indicate his desire that she be permitted to go
the master hesitated
irene smiled archly
very well he agreed
we shall use one of the fivepassenger cabin planes for the first flight and you may accompany erskine and borden
irene thanked him profusely and he beamed his good nature
but the steely crispness returned to his voice when he again address roger
you will prepare the same sort of report on the cabin plane erskine he ordered rising from the table
roger bowed in order to hide the scowl that wrinkled his forehead
the professor acts a hour later roger and borden ascended to the surface where they were met by chandra dai who had accompanied irene to the hangar
a sleek singlemotored cabin plane of the type that had signalled the albatross awaited their coming
and at the door stood tom patton smiling satanically
roger wanted more than ever to punch that evil face
patton will accompany you stated chandra dai shortly
irene shrank from him as she entered the door of the cabin
harry borden whispered encouragement in her ear worry about that baby he said can take care of him
with borden in the pilots seat and roger at his side irene and patton occupied the passenger seats in the rear
a gang of waiting coolies trundled the ship from the hangar and headed it into the wind
great old crates these are said borden as he snapped the starting switch that sent the four hundred horsepower radial barking and sputtering
they start hard in this cold though
it was several minutes before the engine had warmed up enough to fire evenly and chandra sinister leer graced the window until borden waved his arm
then he withdrew his face the chocks were removed from under the wheels and with the roar of the gunned motor the plane slipped rapidly along the smooth surface of the artificial field
simultaneously they saw two of the smaller pursuitjilanes taxi over the field and these took to the air before the tail of their own ship was off being well chaperoned erskine said patton spitefully as their ship swung out over the dreary ice pack
the two small planes circled about and fell in behind the larger ship to follow in triangular formation
roger deigned no reply but he eased himself into such a position that he could watch patton from the comer of his eye
borden headed due south and began a running fire of comments regarding the good and bad points of the ship
she handles nicely for such a heavy crate he said and you couldnot bust her up with a cyclone
all steel you know with welded struts and reinforcements a gun back of patton there and heres the trips of the two tunnel guns
he pointed to the butts of the twin guns that projected into the cabin underneath the instrument board
webbed belts of shining ammunition were in place and roger shuddered as he thought of the streams of flaming death that could spew from those weapons at a mere pressure of the trips
he had never fired a machine gun but he fully understood their operation and capabilities
how much fuel do you carry he asked
enough for about five thousand miles came the reply and the tanks are full now
but we ainot going that far this time
the irrepressible borden laughed
but patton was intent on making the trip unpleasant
look here erskine he interrupted the way they keep tabs on you back in new kurja
he pointed to a pair of metal discs set into the cabin ceiling
each was of ten inches diameter and of dull gray color
television transmitter and receiver discs he explained and continually in use at the other end
watch
he snapped a small switch and one of the discs flashed a view of the operating room at the base where a number of similar screens were closely watched by attendants
he manipulated a dial and the scene changed shifting from room to room of the stronghold they had left far behind
he stopped the action when a view of the laboratory was obtained
irene gurgled delightedly as she saw the figure of her father bent over a complicated mechanism with which he was working
in the room there was ben sair and three other assistants and chandra dai himself was watching the experiment
a beam of crystalwhite light shot from out the apparatus and impinged on a small test tube from which there came a wisp of smoke
then as they watched interestedly a surprising thing happened
the professor suddenly straightened up and the light beam shifted quickly in the direction of chandra midsection
there was another wisp of smoke and chandra dai vanished into thin air
ben sair fell to his knees and they could see his black jaws chattering with fear
god killed the master exclaimed roger
patton chortled as irene covered her eyes with trembling hands
now i am the master he shouted
warren ingalls sacrifice ack in the laboratory of new kurja professor ingalls spread terror among the remaining occupants of the larger room
he swung on his heel as two of the laboratory assistants made a rush for him
he swung the devastating beam of mysterious limpid light and the headlong dash of the two aggressors ended abruptly with the complete disintegration of their bodies
flickering pinpoints of shortlived brilliance were all that marked the instantaneous transition from palpitating living organisms to nothingness
ben sair cowered against the wall shivering with superstitious dread to him this glitteringeyed white man was a reincarnation of some longforgotten voodoo
but the other assistant a lithe burman had slipped behind a large cabinet and he started blazing away with an automatic
fortunately for the professor his aim was none too good for the setting of the deathray was such that the metal cabinet formed an insulator
in the short interval in which the professor made rapid adjustments to his apparatus the burman emptied the magazine of his weapon without causing other damage than the shattering of much glassware and the demolishing of a wallmounted television screen
ben sair was speechless and helpless with fright and his eyes rolled until only the whites were visible
then the burman slipped a fresh clip of cartridges into his gun and took more careful aim at the professor just as the crystal ray changed color and became a vicious carmine
simultaneously with the shot that struck the professor in the left shoulder the metal of the cabinet spurted a shower of sparks with a hiss and a rumble that shook the floor
the burman vanished as had the first three
the big negro recovered some of his courage as he saw that the professor had slipped to the floor and was weakly attempting to stanch the flow of blood from his shattered shoulder
mister professor he said in quavering voice let me help you
just donot turn the lightning machine on ben sair and hell stick to you
all right ben sair
come here and bind this up
he had torn a strip of linen from his shirt and the negro bandaged the lacerated shoulder as best he could with palsied fingers
now help me with this other machine said the professor as he struggled to his feet and dragged his weary body to another and still untried mechanism that had just been completed under his instructions
this incorporated the usual impinging disc and conical collector of the cosmic rays but there were no less than twentyfive prisms and reflectors to segregate separate elements from the conglomerate assemblage brought in from the depths of space
a series of filters and intensifiers directed the separate components onto a platform whereon there reposed a lump of antimony no larger than a walnut
the two movable poles of a huge electromagnet were brought into close proximity to the lump of antimony as the professor manipulated a handwheel at either side of the platform
when all adjustments had been completed to his satisfaction he pulled the lever of a starting box and there was the smooth whir of a motor from somewhere within the mechanism
in a hollow shiny sphere beneath the platform there rose the hum of a thousand bumblebees and scintillating lights played over the reflectors and prisms
the small lump of antimony glowed with an unearthly light and it seemed to quiver and pulsate like a living thing
ben sair watched with increasing concern
ben sair mumbled the professor who was rapidly weakening we are going to save the world you and we are going to save roger erskine and my daughter out there in that airplane
when new kurja is gone roger will find means of overcoming the vicious tom patton and of saving irene
something tells me that all will be well with them
at any rate it is their only chance
the negro did not understand
he knew only that the weird flaming nugget on the platform of this crazy white mans machine was dancing and whirling like a dervish afire
as he watched it with bulging eyes it grew larger and larger until it was as big as a baseball
faster and faster as the poles automatically moved apart the lump spun taking on mass from the acquisition of electrons from the disintegrated components of the surrounding atmosphere
it expanded until it seemed to be touching the pole pieces between which it rotated so speedily
the poles could move no further apart
the professor looked on with glazing eyes
he clung to the work bench for support
there was a smile of triumph on his face
success
success he exclaimed
suddenly ben sair was overcome with nauseating fright
his teeth chattered anew and with an abrupt maniacal impulse he sprang for the professors throat
it was a short struggle for the professors vitality was ebbing fast and those great black paws had the strength of relentless savagery
but professor ingalls went to his reward with peace and joy in his heart
his last conscious thought was the unquestionable certitude of safely that came to him somehow from the great beyond into which his soul was passing
ben sair rose to his feet and his savage intellect grew foggy when he saw that the platform and the electromagnet had vanished along with most of the remainder of the strange machine and that the whirling sphere was now the size of a cocoanut and spun unsupported in the jposition in which it had reposed
in an accession of uncouth fury he picked up an iron bar from a nearby tool rack and struck violently with it at the spinning ball of fire
at contact of the cold metal there was a blinding flash and the bar was tom violently from his hands merging into and becoming a part of the strange orb which was now deflected from its position and swung away from the remains of the machine in a reeling zigzag path
his hands were seared bare of flesh and he screamed with pain
the nebulous mass gathered speed in its movements and knocked about the laboratory with rapid acceleration annihilating and taking into itself every object with which it contacted
the very air of the room grew rare as it contributed to the everincreasing mass of the uncanny thing the professor had created
the end of new kurja he laboratory became a veritable gehenna
the metal walls vibrated to the unearthly influence from within the whirling darting globe
ben sair screeched when he looked at the bare flesh of his chest and saw that it glowed and twitched with the movements of rivulets of purple flame that crawled rapidly over the skin in a swiftly spreading network
his arms lost their tremendous muscular power and he grew as weak as a child
his legs failed to support the black bulk of his body and he fell to his knees and crawled painfully toward the door
the floor reacted to his touch with a stinging vibration that further numbed his muscles and paralyzed his joints
he was barely able to reach the door and draw the bolts and when he had accomplished this he lay in an immobile heap across the sill
there were shoutings and rapid footsteps in the corridor but they came faintly to ben consciousness through the everrising roar of the commotion within the laboratory
new kurja was shaken to its foundations and the inhabitants were rushing blindly from passage to passage seeking the cause of the disturbance
there were outcries and arguments
a voice called loudly for chandra dai and ben sair tried to reply
but his voice refused to answer to his will
the mammoth fiery ball was upon him and with a final hcless struggle he was taken painlessly into its rapacious roaring interior
the ceiling collapsed with a twang like a snapping violin string of brobdingnagian proportions
with it there came the heavy furniture from the floor above all went to swell the now bloated monster of destruction
over the din there came the shrieks of the gautamans who scrambled for the lifts in futile attempts to escape
on the uppermost surface mechanicians were frantically struggling with the motors of all available planes
none of them would start for the ignition systems were paralyzed by the emanations of that inexplicable fury that was ploughing its alldevouring way through the lower levels gaining in bulk and destructive power as it progressed
then with a groan and a shudder the mountain that was new kurja dissolved like melting paraffin and sank with a convulsive protest into the polar sea
the massed ice shriveled and drew away as if in alarm and an immense seething steaming cauldron marked the spot
then with a final turbulent uproar a geyser shot skyward redlit and aweinspiring
when this subsided all was still and nothing remained save a halfmile circle of open ter that quickly glazed over with newlyforming ice
the struggle in the plane he four occupants of the cabin plane which had left the base so short a time before watched the destruction of new kurja in the television screen
irene sobbed out her grief at the passing of her father knowing full well that his sacrifice was made in a desperate hope of saving her and with the very definite intent of upsetting the plans of chandra dai and his ilk
tom patton became a raving maniac as his hopes of personal glory and power tottered and fell
harry borden kept the ship to her original course and watched the pictured holocaust with considerable of awe but with little apparent regret
roger was dumfounded at the development and did his ineffectual best to comfort the unexpectedly orphaned girl
her sobs continued unabated as she turned from the screen before the final curtain was rung on the tragedy
then when the last vestige of new kurja had disappeared from their view tom patton grasped irene by the wrist and menaced roger with his automatic
he snarled out a savage oath as he drew the resisting girl to the seat she had previously occupied keeping roger covered throughout the maneuver
borden he ordered new gone and so is chandra dai
but the cause lives on and i intend to obtain control of the other base near point barrow head there at once and there become master
this dizzy blonde will be mistress
at the insult roger ducked quickly and threw his full weight into a lunge that carried him into a desperate grapple with the infuriated patton
he grasped the wrist of the astonished outlaw in time to spoil his aim and the bullet intended for heart sped harmlessly through the roof of the cabin
but patton wrenched himself free loosing his hold on irene as he did so
he backed from furious rush and again raised his pistol
borden had risen from his seat a scowl of rage on his rotund countenance
cut it patton he snapped get us all killed
patton laughed and swung his weapon in the pilots direction firing rapidly
roger swung out with his right and caught the madman full on the jaw with a terrific punch but too late to save poor borden first shot had struck the jovial pilot in the forehead and he fell lifeless over the back of his seat his head drilled through
patton went down under blow but he quickly scrambled to a sitting position and fired once more
roger opened his mouth in surprise and clamped his hand to his right thigh where the metalcased bullet had struck
meanwhile without a pilot the plane had gone into a spin and the three living occupants were tumbled in a heap on the floor of the cabin
roger obtained a firm grip on the muzzle of the automatic and slowly but surely twisted it from grip
then from an almost prone position he struck out wildly with the weapon again and again
a mist had gathered before his eyes but he felt the contact of the pistol butt as it crashed into skull
the mist cleared and he saw that irene had fainted and was wedged between her seat and the wall of the cabin face had disappeared in a bloody smear and he lay quite still where he had rolled
dazedly roger crawled along the wall to the pilots seat and grasped the stick hazily he fussed with the controls trying to remember how to pull out of the spin
the gray expanse of ice below came rushing upward whirling dizzily as it loomed closer and closer
then the mists cleared once more and he remembered
the nose of the ship came up and they were safe but not a hundred feet above the menacing ice pack
the motor was still pounding steadily under full gun and they gained altitude rapidly
roger had entirely forgotten the two pursuit planes that had followed from new kurja
with the ship levelled off at a safe altitude he turned to see whether irene was regaining consciousness
she smiled wanly but encouragingly from her seat which she had regained unassisted
all right dear he asked all right was the brave reply
are you
right legs completely numb he said
but i can get along
is patton dead
quite said irene with a shudder
the body of harry borden had rolled aside and wedged under the seat alongside his own and roger regarded it with something of real sorrow in his heart
he would have to dump the two bodies overboard but he would wait until feeling returned to that numbed right leg
then a surprising thing occurred
the ship seemed to shudder from the impact of bullets that suddenly raked the cabin from stem to stern
one of the pursuit planes had turned its guns loose on them
roger had never been in an air fight but he was an experienced flyer and had a good idea of how it should be done
stunting was not easy with the heavy cabin plane but he zoomed up and rolled over bringing the nose of the ship around
he saw the nose of one of the pursuit planes headed directly for him and he ducked instinctively shouting to irene to do likewise
glass from the front window spintered and flew past as a burst from the small plane sputtered through
he brought the nose of the ship all the way over and found the other pursuit plane dead on the sights of his own guns
hardly realizing what he was doing nor why he did it he reached out and pressed the trips
he watched the burst as it stippled a pattern across the windshield of the small plane saw the pilot fling his arms outward and slump against the forward crash pad
he had made a killing at his first try irene saves them lack smoke came from under the motor housing of the pursuit plane and she slipped into the spin that would carry her to the ice far below
forgetting the other ship forgetting everything save that he had shot down a fighting plane in actual combat he followed in a dive until he saw it crash and burst into flames
then he zoomed up once more and as he did so the cabin was again raked by the searching bullets from the enemy guns
he came on over in a loop and managed to get the small plane in his sights while he was on his back
once more he pressed the trips without apparent results
irene clung gamely to her seat though she had been considerably battered about by the quick lunges of the ship
he came on over and levelled off but the second plane was not in sight it was underneath and rising to the attack unseen
the cabin was again raked by a burst from the guns of the enemy
the little plane was very fast and handled so easily that roger had little hope of shaking the fellow off his tail
he banked and rolled to no avail
he put the nose down once more and then came back on the stick to start a loop warning irene to hold fast
still he could not shake off that persistent little ship
he reached the top of the loop then half rolled out banked around and found that his pursuer was still close on his tail
when he levelled off he saw that irene was crawling to the rear of the cabin
keep down he shouted
but she paid no attention and quickly reached the rear gun though a stream of lead was ripping through the cabin shattering the windows and perforating the steel walls in searching pattern
the brave girl swung the gun around and found the trip
her aim was wild at first but she swayed the muzzle back and forth up and down until the tracers showed that she had found her mark
the ammunition belt was nearly empty and the barrel smoking hot
but a burst of flame came from the pursuing plane and the pilot rose in his seat terrorstricken at the unexpected result of the girls desperate endeavor
in a moment he was the center of a flaming hurricane and the plane slipped rapidly downward carrying him to the most terrible of deaths
irene covered her eyes as he crawled from the cockpit and jumped preferring the quicker way to being roasted alive
good girl shouted roger gleefully
a few minutes later roger negotiated a skillful lar ding on a smooth area he had located in the ice field
they removed the two bodies from the bulletriddled plane and roger extracted a packet of papers from coat that later proved of tremendous value
he determined their position by use of the sextant which he had found in the ships equipment
from the chart he discovered that they were about five hundred miles due north of etah and he decided to proceed there for medical attention and provisions
the wound in his thigh was not serious the metalcased bullet from automatic having drilled the fleshy portion cleanly through apparently missing the bone entirely
with help he bound it as well as possible and though he could scarcely bear his weight on the injured limb was not seriously inconvenienced
when they took off irene snuggled into the seat at his side with a sigh of relief
it had been very cold outside and the cabin was comparatively warm though the wind whistled through a hundred bullet holes in windows and walls
poor father she groaned as roger headed the ship toward the south and climbed rapidly
if we could only have him with us
i shall miss wm terribly we have been constant companions since mother passed away
now i i am alone
she stared dryeyed into the heavens suffering mutely as roger racked his brains for a suitable reply
no dear he finally ventured not alone
if you will let me i shall always be at your side
i i love you irene and want you for my wife
then came the tears she had repressed and somehow she found it very easy and very pleasant to move into the protecting embrace of encircling right arm as he flew the ship lefthanded
she cried out her mingled grief and happiness in the hollow of his shoulder as the plane roared swiftly in the direction of civilization and future happiness
the previous monotony of existence was never to return and out there over the chill polar floes he visioned happily the contentment and joy that was to be his lot with irene as his companion
but little did either of them realize that they were to receive the plaudits and gratitude of the world a worldj that was to awake to the knowledge of the catastrophe that threatened and that was to find means of stamping out the terrible menace of the gautamans
for the papers roger had taken from patton revealed the whole plot the identity of the leaders the locations of the many bases arsenals everything
and with this information in the hands of a newlyformed international police it was not difficult to make a clean sweep of the menacious conspirators
the name of warren ingalls lived on enshrined in the memory of the masses
his sacrifice had not been in vain
the end
the noise increases like the booming of a thousand gns
the fissures are opening wider the planet is separating
i have wedged myself between two boulders to keep from leaving the ground mechanic gave one last twist to the propeller
a sharp staccato crackling bit the air as the engine of the giant plane barked out its challenge to the elements roared still louder and with a whine that broke into an increasing crescendo settled down to its stride a deepthroated purring that ebbed and flowed from the heart of the engine
the last adjustments had been made and everything was in readiness on the machine that was to carry lieutenant richard merrill one of the first american aviators to pilot a french plane into a country far beyond the borders of france on one of the most dangerous missions he had ever attempted
with a smile and a careless wave of his hand at the other members of his squadron he climbed into the cockpit and adjusted his helmet
for half a second he fumbled with the strap then reached for the stick
the note of the engine deepened
a tempest of air swept backwards and the last restraining block was kicked from beneath the wheel
the plane rolled forward gathering momentum at every yard
an oncoming wind bore down upon it as though to beat it back
the engines throb answered the singing noise through the fuselage
the wings dipped backward into the teeth of the gale breasted it and with a graceful spiral climbed swiftly into the upper strata
higher and higher it soared in everwidening circles until it became but a speck in the clear sky then it was gone
that was the last that was ever seen of lieutenant richard merrill
the official records now on file in washingfton show that he left the french aerial base at mollincourte on october under orders to make certain observations
for this work he carried a long range telescopic camera charts of specific areas to be covered and a supply of oil and petrol sufficient for twentyfour hours of sustained flight
at the time merrill left i had been employed on the paris staff of the new york herald and we had been warm friends
merrill was one of those men who seemed to spring from nowhere possessing few friends and no relatives
he was and is now listed as missing
nothing was ever found of the plane in which he took off on that thirteenth day of october
for several years following his disappearance the knowing ones argued that the machine had gone far from is conceded by science that the atmosphere of the earth extends only about miles and even from the level on upwards the atmosphere becomes so tenuous that it would be impossible to sustain human life even for an instant
as is wellknown the aviators can no longer breathe comfortably even at such a comparatively low and dense level as seven miles above the surface of the earth
without oxygen therefore it would be impossible to go higher than seven or eight miles
if on the other hand some extremely large or extremely dense celestial body with an atmosphere of its own should come near to the earth it would not be impossible to have the two atmospheres mingle
then indeed it would become possible for an aviator to fly from our world to the other one
a body made of neutronium for example which weighs pounds per cubic inch need not be very large to have a weight sufficient to attract an object in the earths atmosphere its chedifled course and had dropped into the sea
others had pointed out the possibility of its and falling to the earth in flames thereby making identification impossible
prisoners had long since been exchanged bringing back many that were long thought dead
lieutenant merrill however was not among them nor was there any record to show that he ever had been a prisoner
obviously then if the knowing ones were right
lieutenant merrill had merely met death in a manner unknown
this might have ended the matter had not something entirely unforeseen developed in the fall of which enshrouded his disappearance with a cloud of doubt and gave rise to a series of perplexing questions to which i am unable to find sane and reasonable answers
lieutenant disappearance forms a chapter of unknown and unpublished experience in the history of aviation
it is a mystery with an explanation but barely plausible even among present day scientists
it fails to conform with the laws of our universe and thus it raises more doubts and more questions
briefly two years after takeoff from the airdrome in france a diary written by no other than the missing man was picked up by a farmer in western iowa
while the written words of the airman gave a partial explanation of his predicament it also gave rise to a series of perplexing questions
how the book could have reached the earth again while man and machine remained beyond the pull of gravity was a thing that clouded the mystery rather than clearing it
the diary was wrapped in leather evidently cut from the coat and weighted to a stone
i say stone for the lack of a better word to properly define the nature of this peculiar substance
it was in size only a pebble but it weighed over two hundred pounds
a chemical analysis of a small part of it disclosed helium uranium and small quantities of radium
other metals of unfamiliar origin formed the bulk of the mass
the possession of this curious stone is the only tangible evidence aside from the diary that can be offered as proof of the strange adventure of lieutenant merrill
through the of the local authorities the book was forwarded to me at the press headquarters at new york city my name having been found on the wrapping
i am not an astronomer and my knowledge of our solar system is limited
i do not attempt to explain the entries made by this airman in the daily
record of his terrible experience
by all means i am not a spiritualist and i do not believe in receiving messages from the dead
the actual account as written comes from a courageous man who held on when all hope had been abandoned
if he is now dead science has lost the key to one of the darkest secrets of the universe
the contents of his diary therefore i am presenting in its original form without comment
diary ctober it was some hours after leaving the ground with the wind swinging past me in mournful cadence that the first premonition of coming disaster came over me
i struggled to fight it off knowing that it would get me in the end if i didnot conquer it while in the air
to help overcome this fear i fastened my diary near me to record impressions
for a long time my fears were groundless until in the far off haze of distance a tiny speck dotted the thin air
it comes nearer and nearer and i recognize the outlines of an enemy plane
the minutes pass quickly
soon it is above me far up
the markings of the black cross are now plainly visible
i recognize it as a german fokker and it is maneuvering around to get on my tail
i have set my course on a sharp angle to avoid it and get above it
the pilot of the other machine has started to give chase
well let him
i can easily avoid him if i have plenty of room
the throttle is now way down and he is no longer gaining on me
there is a cloud bank ahead which i am heading for
once there i am safe
the air is growing colder with each passing minute
a far off crackling sound is borne to my ears
tracer bullets burn the air behind me
i laugh lightly and bank sharply to the left
in an instant i realize my mistake
it has brought me closer to the other plane
the whine of steeljacketed bullets through the fuselage causes me to bank almost vertically to the right
another fusillade follows
the machine is now climbing like a rocket climbing faster and steeper than it has ever gone before
a heavy bank of clouds envelopes me and i breathe a sigh of relief
the anxious moments drag
will the other flyer come through after me
above the clouds at last
the fokker is no longer in sight
i start to push the stick forward and find it immovable
i jerk it with all my strength but the plane refuses to return to a lateral line of travel forward
this is annoying but i manage to keep my head
since the plane is headed upward nothing can happen so long as the engine revolves
in the meantime i crawl back to see the extent of the damage
my heart pounds sickeningly
the levers are hopelessly jammed and impossible to get at
one of the control rods is broken
again and again i tug at the stubborn levers feverishly now for i realize that if i am going to reach the ground alive i must have some kind of control of the machine
but all my attemps to straighten the machine are futile
it is climbing steadily upward
anxiously i recall past experiences for some way out of my dilemma
nothing suggests itself
i am imprisoned in a hurtling machine which no longer can be controlled
the thought is horrifying
were it not for this diary i think i should go insane
i have no chute with me and even if i did have i would probably land on the wrong side of the lines and remain a prisoner for the rest of the war
visions of past experiences flit before me in kaleidoscopic array
i find myself shivering
the involuntary act brings me back to my senses
it is growing bitter cold
the air is changing and becoming with each minute more rare and it is difficult to breathe
the heavily encased flying suit is keeping my body warm but my hands and face are blue from the cold
i look anxiously at the altimeter
a white frost has formed on the glass panel making reading of it an impossibility
unable to stand the cold any longer i cut down on the gas
in half a second the plane has started in a tail spin
the swiftness of the descent almost takes my breath away
this will never do
it was death to keep on upward and equally dangerous to fall back to the earth
between the two i had a choice and took it
i pulled the throttle clear down and kept it there
the plane came out of the spin and once more mounted steadily into the upper void
writing has become a dreary task
blood is pounding in my head and pouring from my nose
i am beginning to feel nauseated and sick
my eyes are heavy as if i hadnot slept for weeks
i want to close them and drift off into a peaceful rest that will at least remove the terror of the unknown into which i am heading
the earth is now buried with clouds and vapor
i have completely lost my bearings
still the plane is hurling itself upwards
for the past two hours i have written nothing
with considerable difficulty i have pulled the oxygen mask over my head and attached it to the coupling on the tank
but the pressure is getting lower every minute
the tank hadnot been full to start with carelessness
no matter
it wonot make much difference in a little while
slowly a heavy drowsiness overpowers me
my will to keep awake is weakening
no longer do i feel the pain in my frostbitten hands and face
a delightful warmth steals over me
this is the beginning of the end pleasant anyways not suffering
no longer can i shake off the feeling sinking going down into oblivion farther and farther into eternity i am lost october i came to my senses with the sun shining full on my face and burning into my eyes
my whole body aches from the cramped quarters into which i am strapped
a peculiar humming noise fills the air a weird pulsing throb that seemed to soothe my sluggish mind
the meaning of it did not come to me for some time
then to my amazement i find it is the sound of the motor which is still turning over
strange how curious everything seems
looking around and over the edge of my seat i gaze into emptiness
simply that
as far as my eyes can see nothing but clouds and the sun
suddenly the clouds open up below me and the earth is once more visible but oh how far away
i am traveling into the sheer void of sky and heaven
leaning towards the altimeter which the warm sun has again rendered visible by melting the frost i found the needle stationary at the highest reading on the instrument
mechanically i note the speed of the planes travel
during the night it must have picked up considerable for it is now going close to five hundred miles an hour with no additional effort or strain of power
the wind is singing through the fuselage like the drone of a thousand bees
faster and faster skims the plane
the air resistance must be practically nil or else the machine is being carried onwards by some invisible trade wind
i look again at the instrument board
the instruments are all out of kilter the needles varying from minute to minute
the pointer on the fuel tank shows that i must have been unconscious for many hours
i have no desire for food although i am supplied with a considerable amount of hard tack and several cans of beef
is this strange buoyancy upsetting my desire for food or is it the result of nerves
i am inclined to favor the latter for my mind seems strangely alert
impressions are clear and distinct
yet a kind of a new sense seems to be making itself felt indistinct and ethereal
am i destined by an unkind fate to remain always away from the earth like a separate solar body
the thought makes me laugh aloud
this is folly i thought
i am dreaming all this
a nightmare pure and simple
yet if it is a bad dream there seems no way of arousing myself
my eyes are open and i can see
clouds are far below me
i can see the blazing orb of the sun and feel its heat
one by one i examine the dials on the instrument board
i feel of my hands my face and my heavily clothed body
i hear the exhaust of the motor and the whirl of the propeller
no i am not dreaming
my senses were never more acute beyond the earth a ll thought of fear has left me
by now i must be near the last barriers that surround the earth the edge of the envelope of atmosphere that covers and in a measure protects our planet
at the present rate of gas consumption my flight will last but a short time for the gas is low
after that it will be useless to hope for anything to happen
i try shutting down on the throttle and to my astonishment the present speed continues
by some strange phenomenon the plane seems to move along at the same speed regardless of how much gas i give the motor
here is a point worth considering
am i getting beyond the pull of gravity
no it canot be yet the evidence is clear
this last thought is too much
it frightens me and my hand trembles so that i can no longer write
it is now evening or so it would seem according to my watch which by good fortune i have kept going
but there is no darkness a strange paradox of nature
i mention this to bring out a striking departure from one of our most natural laws that bring darkness and daylight to the earth every twenty four hours with a regularity that has never been broken
but no the mistake is mine
it is getting dark but it is hours later than on earth
yes it is getting darker by the minute
with the passing of time the air resistance decreases
in fact there seems to be none at all now
the motor is acting queerly
evidently the gas is about gone
i donot know what will happen if it stops
probably nothing at all
in all probability the powerful air current that is carrying me along will continue indefinitely
in spite of the terrific speed of the machine i suffer no ill effects and breathe quite normally
my body is cramped from being strapped in one position for so long a time and i hesitate to try moving about
slowly the hours drag along
i have switched on the light over the instrument board in order to see
after a time i begin to grow sleepy again
the air is slightly cooler
all around me are the stars and to the left hangs a ragged moon
october i am not sure about my dates for during that awful period that i lost consciousness everything was a blank but i am trying to keep them approximately straight
morning has come again the second morning in the ill fated plane
hunger returned and i ate sparingly of my rations and washed them down with water from my canteen
long and anxiously have i turned my binoculars all about me in search of something to break the terrible monotony of space
after what appears an eternity i have made out a dark spot that shows directly in the path in which the machine is moving
and so i sit and wait for i know not what
gradually with the passing of weary hours the spot begins to grow larger
the earth is still below me yet hardly visible through the haze
i gaze again at the rapidly approaching dark spot
what can it be
is it possible that it is some form of the suns asteroids or is it a wandering comet
once again the premonition of the unreal comes over me
what would happen if i collided with it
i have heard that these strange sky visitors travel at a tremendous velocity through space in their journeys around the earth
but it canot be
comets and other wanderers of the air are hundreds of thousands of miles from the earth
perhaps it is but a figment of my imagination put it from my mind and not think about it
alas the sight of that dark speck attracts my eyes like a magnet
i can not see or think of anything else
i am fully prepared to wait and see
the afternoon is nearly gone according to my watch
if my present speed continues i should be very near it sometime tomorrow
ahead of me and a little to the right the great orb of the sun shows
and to the left of it floats the dark body which may or may not mean the end
if i hit it the machine and i will be smashed to tiny bits
if i miss it the chances are that continue to travel endlessly into space
four hours have passed and i have become exceedingly tired
the speck in the far distance has steadily grown larger and larger
it looms before the path of the hurtling machine like an opening cut through the sky leading out of our solar system toward the suns and planets of other worlds
am i on the verge of a wonderful discovery or am i seeing a reflected image from a world beyond my sight
why i should continue to write in this diary i cannot tell
somehow i feel that it acts as a barrier between me and the great unknown into which i am plunging
it seems to be the one thing that links me to the world i am lost from i must have dropped to sleep
a curious rocking motion brought me upright to a startling discovery
during the intervening hours and they must have been many for my watch has stopped the machine has sped straight towards the wanderer of the sky and even now hovers over the dark mass
anxiously i peer over the edge of the cockpit and seem to make out hills and valleys with dark splotches that look like some form of vegetation
a new land he onrushing air no longer sings past me
i seem to have struck a pocket where force seems of no avail where all things die through loss of motion where the laws we call nature fail to hold up
i have passed beyond the borderland of the earth and into the fastness of another world
for a moment my heart wells up within me at the mystery of the forces about me
below me stretches a new land waiting to take me in and give me rest but never to give me up
oh i realize during these moments as the machine drops lower and lower that i can never leave this fragment of a lost world into which i am slowly descending
i feel that i have passed the power station of the earth and reached by a long long flight the one place where ships do not pass where men never come out and beyond the invisible line that marks the last world outpost into interplanetary space where new worlds begin where gravity ends
october not knowing how long i last slept i have lost track of the exact date
i think it must be the 17th but i am not sure
it is hard to describe in a clear and understandable manner my odd experiences during the past few hours
in fact it seems quite useless now that i am totally and forever lost from my fellow men
words fail to express the terrible loneliness that grips my heart
i feel like an alien soul tossed about in a strange land
and that is precisely what i am
the plane lies on its side in a small ravine twisted and broken
miraculously i escaped unhurt from the fall which by the way was not as bad as i had anticipated owing to the small force of gravity this small world had upon the falling plane
i have wondered why the force of gravity did not smash me and my plane to bits
the only conclusion i can reach is that for the greater part of my travel the gravitational force of this little world was almost balanced by that of the earth
i have eaten and quenched my thirst and stretched my cramped muscles
and now with the diary still before me i will try to record as accurately as possible the strange things that exist on this faraway plce my first experience was in jumping from the edge of the cockpit to the ground
if you have ever seen a motion picture taken with an ultrarapid lens so that when shown on the screen at normal speed the moving objects leap and fall in a slow and lazy manner you will understand exactly how i reached the ground
the jump was effortless
it was as though i drifted downward
i started to walk around the plane and found myself continually on the tips of my toes as though i were treading on air
it has become necessary for me to take longer strides when i walk jumping lightly as i do
the feeling is of course exhilarating
i soon found i could cover an immense amount of ground and still scarcely exert myself
what i took for vegetation proved nothing more than highly colored rocks that upon examination appear to be semiprecious stones
i have however found a few flowers unlike anything i have ever seen in my life
they are of a strange iridescent hue with transparent leaves and stalks
there may be vegetation here but i havenot explored much
the land itself is nearly level with slight undulations that can scarcely be called hills
i have found a spring of clear water and that is all
upon looking over bits of earth and rocks i find new substances
the stones are remarkable for their luminous quality and quite heavy
i did find one that looked like a sapphire but unlike the usual stones was extremely light
upon tossing it away i experienced anew the low pull of gravity
i had thrown it lightly and to my amazement it had traveled a hundred yards
i tried the experiment again with another stone of similar weight
this one i threw with some force
that was the last i ever saw of it
it simply floated away in the distance
even as i write this i can scarce credit my senses with a world so small that it seems more artificial than real
it makes me feel that the whole experience is a gigfantic hoax and that i shall presently awaken and find myself the victim of a wild nightmare
however strange as it may seem it is all too real
on the top of the highest point i have made a temporary shelter of the rocks which proved quite simple considering how easy it was to lift huge boulders and lay them wherever i wanted them without any trouble
nature is again at work
it is fast growing dark bringing immense relief to my tired eyes
one by one the lights of the stars shine through the dim vaults from above
they seem very near and friendly tonight bringing me some measure of contentment
as i stand here in the midst of immensity looking out into infinite space the vision appals me
across the clear terrestrial sky are multitudes of glittering lights faint and effervescent the twilight of other worlds
these then must always be my companions my one solace on this faroff fragment of a broken world
nearing the end day has come
i have put off the del pressing thoughts of last night and begun a systematic survey of my new home
if i am to remain here i must be prepared for a long stay
from what observations i have made and my poor knowledge of mathematics i should judge my little planet is but a few hundred miles in diameter
from what i can conclude from my knowledge i believe life is possible as long as the planet remains in its present orbit
until early evening i pondered my chances for continued existence in this remote place since it is clearly impossible for me to return to the world of war and men
war
i had forgotten it
how far away it seems now
my uniform the silver bars on my shoulders my commission as a lieutenant in the aviation trade them all for a good cup of coffee
i had just finished the last entry in the diary when a sudden shuddering jar as of a headon collision shook the planet
it is hours afterward now as i write
how many i cannot guess lent subterranean action is fast shaking my stronghold to pieces the ground is opening up in black twisting seams from which a choking gaseous vapor is coming out in strangling clouds a flash of violethued fire followed closely by a thunderous rumbling roar causes the tiny planet to lurch violently on its axis
the ground is heaving and trembling from some inward strain
a blinding glare of vivid lights followed by a crunching as of earth and rocks being slowly pulverized from the powerful forces beneath marks the beginning of the end
i can feel it in every fibre of my body
how i can remain in one position and write i do not know
running away will do no good
all i can hope for is to keep my head and observe something that no mortal has ever before seen
the noise increases with each passing minute
it is like the sullen booming of a thousand guns
the fissures are opening wider
the planet seems to be separating
each passing moment finds the air more oppressive
clouds of vapor hover close to the ground
all the lighter forms of mineral are fast being precipitated off and outward from the whirling tumbling mass into space
i have wedged myself between two enormous boulders to keep myself from leaving the ground
the rumbling deep and thunderous is shaking me so that i can hardly write
overhead the air is filled with flying missiles being thrown into space
complete and instant destruction is not far off
flashes of scarlet and green are breaking with the violet
coughing and strangling from the poisoned air i am beginning to grow weak
i am writing my last few words for the outside world in hope that they will fall into the hands of someone who the ground is disintegrating beneath me it is melting scorching blasts of flame are shooting skyward
no longer can i god help me the rocks are running like molten wax it is burning me alive merciful god so ended the diary of lieutenant richard merrill a strange and unbelievable document of human experience
from the paris morning journal
le matin i have cut out a clipping that appeared on the morning following the fifth day of his disappearance
on october 12th a new and unknown sky wanderer was observed low on the northwestern horizon
its approach to the earth was so close as to seem almost a part of it
the comet or asteroid was visible but a short timie on two evenings
that it escaped general notice was due to heavy clouds that hung in the sky about it
sometime later a process of disintegration was plainly observed in the early evening
when next looked for no trace of it could be found
this item of news had no particular significance at the time to anyone
it received merely a passing notice in a few papers
the appearance of the visitor and disappearance may be but a coincidence
but if this astronomers report is true the coincidence is startling and lends a certain actual proof to the strange scrawled words in the unfortunate mans diary
the end
i you like this magazine you must be interested in sciencefiction
this being the case be sure to get the september issue of the sister magazine of air wonder stories
science wonder stories is the greatest sciencefiction magazine in print nothing can compare with it
nearly all of the authors who contribute to air wonder stories also contribute to wonder stories
science wonder stories is dramatizedmechanics
just as air wonder stories mirrors the future of aviation so wonder stories mirrors the future of the whole of civilization and expresses the trend of the worlds scientific progress
if you are interested in aeronautics do not fail to read by captain hermann noordung berlin a series of articles are now running in relating to space flying
space flying no longer is merely fiction
in europe particularly in germany serious efforts are now being made by leading german engineers to make space flying outside of the earth a possibility
captain noordung one of the foremost german engineers has invented some remarkable new instrumentalities to make space flying possible
be sure to read these wonderfully illuminating and prophetic articles fail to read the announcement on page of this issue
we lay over wall street and the gondola was lowered telephone communications giving us directions
we had strewn bombs all about the district so that gas clouds wreathed in the streets
what has gone before a series of daring robberies has siartlea america three wall street hanks haty been robbed of millions in gold by a mysterious raider and the financial district put to sleep
an ocean liner is also robbed of gold and later a bank in louisville ky
james boon an inventor of a new airplane and son of one of the new york becomes interested in the mystery and interests his friend dan lamont a scientist
they conclude that the raider operates from a great speedy airship
boon has made the acquaintance of almeric pluscarden deputy gov ernor of the bank of england and his pretty niece kirsteen torrance
at the request of his father he flies pluscarden back to england in his speedy airplane the the bank of england is robbed by the vandals millions in gold stolen and the ledgers destroyed by acid
then comes news of the invasion of the reichsbank in berlin where securities and ledgers were destroyed and a few hours later the bank of france is entered and millions in gold is left there as well as a supply of radium
as always the district surrounding the robbery is tilled with a gas that puts people to sleep and has the ability to tarnish gold
it also has the quality of stopping the action of gasoline engines
in ti paris invasion the first sight of the robbers ship is had a gigantic airship which according to calculations must have an amasing speed
believing that the world is faced with a reign of terror from the robber or robbers
boon returns to america to arouse his country to fight it
he sees the president who is kirsteen uncle and with dan lamont is commissioned in the secret to hunt the robbers
hearing of robberies off the coast of africa they start out with a plane to fight the raider and after much searching meet him
but their bullets do little harm to the airship wih is surrounded py a hose and the planes motor goes dead
the airship which calls itself ark of the covenant escapes
they believe that it has its base in morocco and call upon the nations to concentrate their airfleets there
continued futile searching i answer to the radios we sent from mogador the international scouts came flocking to the african coast
indeed we were no sooner at the place than the forerunners of the crowd came after us brought along by the news of our fight
they came in a big fanshape move that in my opinion must inevitably have caught the airship had she doubled back across the atlantic
there was little doubt in my mind after sizing the thing up with milliken that he and i had done some damage to the airship with our shellfire
we had put in enough stuff to have fired her if hydrogen had been used in her ballonets so it was pretty clear that her lift was got from helium
in the face of the amazingly quick getaway the raiders had made after the engagement this was puzzling
from her length which milliken and i agreed was about two hundred metres and from her other measurements the total fixed weight of the ship was somewhere round thirtyfour thousand kilos
using helium she could not have a disposal lift of much more than perhaps fifteen thousand
when the weight of her crew fuel and armament was taken into account not much margin was left for carrying extra gas in liquid form
so we reckoned that our puncturing of her must have caused a lot of leakage and that her spectacular ascent must have exhausted a good portion of her reserve gas
we concluded from this that she could not have had far to go to her base and that she would have to travel ultimately at a low altitude which made it unlikely that the patrols making for the african coast would have missed sight of her had she been making across the atlantic
altogether the three of us worked it out that we were justified in believing the airship to be concealed somewhere in the hinterland of the barbary coast and that she would venture out again when the damage we had done to her was made good
we in the merlin with numbers of the international scouts worked on this notion and ventured far into the desert but without finding any reward for our searching
a cordon of scouts was flung round the coast from the canaries right into the mediterranean
on the wednesday following our fight with the airship radio messages were picked up that told of raids on shipping to the north of the bahamas
the temptation then was to go chasing off in that direction but we held back pinning our belief to the idea that our particular airship was berthed somewhere in africa and that it was only a matter of patience before one or other of the planes round the coast came upon her
personally the news of the raids in the western atlantic only confirmed my belief that the organization was big enough to have bases on both sides of the hemisphere
we lay on and off the coast of africa for ten days without any luck and for several reasons i made up my mind to make for home via london
first i wanted to see sir thomas basildon with whom we liad been in constant communication since leaving washington
dan had sent him a long report embodying his ideas of the means used by the raiders for upsetting the engines of attacking planes and outlining a possible way of circumventing the strange weapon
already assistants in new york had drawings of a protective arrangement designed for the merlin and i was anxious to give the thing a trial and to have it tried out on other machines
it was an elaborate cage arrangement of metallic conductors leading to a series of condensers and it was meant to collect the supposed electric ray before it reached the engine and to disperse it harmlessly
in the matter we come toward the final chapters of this greatest air story in our belief that has been printed so far we are approaching the best part of the story
we are quite certain that the denouement is quite different from what you expected
and when you learn the amazing secret that lies behind the mysterious ark of the covenant we believe you will applaud the author for the wonderful idea it is based on making the world a better place to live in
and let no one think that the scientific instruments which the author uses are either improbable or impossible
sooner or later we will have the weapons so finely conceived by him and we do hope when we have them that the inventor or inventors who bring them into the world will take as lofty attitudes as the chief of the gas however by some unfortunate mischance in landing whether by a wave or otherwise bottle apparatus for sampling the anaesthetic had been smashed on the day of our fight and he was without a sample for analysis much to his and my chagrin
secondly as a reason for going home via london i had heard that lord almeric was intending another visit to america and i thought if he could make his arrangements suit it would be a good notion to take him over on the merlin
i radioed to sir thomas telling him to expect us and on the thursday evening dan and i were closeted with him and lord almeric in the room at scotland yard
the chief of the british had not wasted any time we found
he had badgered the authorities into fitting up his planes with airtight bodies and supplying them with oxygen and he had had instrumentmakers set to the task of turning out protective apparatus
our discussion with him and our description of the fight helped to clear up some points that had been puzzling him
we came away from scotland yard in the knowledge that our visit there had not been a waste of time
from lord almeric we heard that business in britain was at a standstill and that factories and commercial houses were closing down all over the country
prices in the stock markets were lower than they had ever been good industrial securities which had been regarded as next to giltedged being sold at prices that made them look like wildcat oil stock
the damage to the country in lost trade represented millions
lord almeric declared and the setback would be felt long after the raiders were scotched
the state of affairs was out of all proportion to the damage done actually in the raids and could only be attributed to a kind of panic
as a result of the london raid and of the affair in the house of commons the government had fallen
it had been laughed out of office though ostensibly its fall was due to a defeat on some quite unimportant measure
the press devoted columns to the raids now and printed the opinions of wise men foolish men wellknown men obscure men of how the outrages were carried out and how they could be stopped with fantastic theories on both sides
it was even suggested that the raiders had come from mars
the change of tone from the time of the new york raid was to say the least of it remarkable
unobtrusively as we had made our entry into london neither dan nor i nor milliken escaped the attentions of the newspaper men
they hung round us like flies infesting our vicinity at meal times seeing us to bed and greeting us on our awaking
we were glad when at last on the saturday morning we could get lord almeric aboard and be off across the atlantic
we made straight for washington where my passenger was to meet my father and several other bankers
our voyage was quite uneventful and placid and we arrived on the potomac basin just before seven on the saturday evening american time
a rival i was good to get back to washington and find no only my father but kirsteen torrance waiting for us on the landingstage
four weeks all but a day had elapsed since our setting out on our venture and to me at least a shadow of failure lay on our return
at any rate i was a little shy of meeting miss level glance
there was that in her welcome of us however after she had greeted lord almeric with affection which quickly swept away all sense of having failed
to milliken always her favorite she had so much to say that he was at his blackest of countenance with embarrassed delight
i thought he would burst something
the old man too seemed to think we had not done badly
in the casual heartiness of his greeting i thought i could discern something of satisfaction of pride even at our exploit
dinner that evening at the white house was a sort of reunion
the president kirsteen lord almeric my father danny and myself all somehow linked up with the task in hand composed the party and one stranger
this was an englishman a big fellow named seton
now in the four weeks we had been away from washington i had thought a good deal about kirsteen torrance and i may admit here and now that i had come back to her with an absolute certainty that life without her would for me be incomplete
when the merlin was streaking down on the airship that sunday morning it had come to me very clearly just what kirsteen stood for and that was pretty nigh everything
i wonot elaborate on the theme leave it just so
it was with a pang of dismay therefore that i heard commander seton introduced as an old friend of both kirsteen and lord almeric and saw the satisfaction the big englishman and she had in each others company
when a fellow finds a girl interesting theres nothing can make him feel so hopeless about his chances with her as to hear her talk with another man do you remember bulking largely in the conversation
seton and kirsteen were old enough friends for that
it would have been a mean thing to get up any dislike of commander seton
as he listened to the story that dan and i had to tell it became very evident that the stranger was no layman in the matter of aeronautics
his comments were practical to a degree and his questions shrewdly knowledgeable
not only that but under the lethargy which sometimes is to be seen in big men of his sort there lay a mental alertness that promised he could move his big frame with lightning quickness in an emergency
he gave an impression of being very much a man
the only point that dan and i held back from the general company was regarding his idea for getting round the electric ray of the raiders
i canot say what it was that moved us to this piece of reticence unless it was just the presence of seton
but this was the very point that the big englishman brought up later in conversation with me when kirsteen had brought us together saying that we should find much in common
that is a curious fact about all four machines being sent down with engine trouble mr boon said seton yit seems indeed to point to some weapon of the kind imagined by your friend lamont
yes said the raiders themselves knew our engine would be all right afterwards
makes it conclusive
yes i said shortly
are you remaining long in washington commander seton
it depends very much on circumstances he repled
if the raiders have such a ray it makes them practically immune from airplane attacks
practically i agreed
i wanted to leave the subject
except of course from a surprise attack on a vulnerable point from a height
oh yes said always that
it must be obvious to you as an airman ah said seton you know that about me do you guessed it
ordinary people do not talk of torque as you do
come come
a common engineering term like that you then
my dear man i have never concealed it
if i did there would always be who and the british navy list to give me away
fly much these days little but i still retain an interest in the game seton said am very interested for example in this new machine of yours
from all accounts she must be a wonder pretty good admit said come and see her some day should like to very much
what day would suit if you like
we go to my place on long island for a refit but you could see her before we start
where are you staying
hotel maryland like yourself
then you could come down with me tomorrow
splendid said he want to see her especially as she may be the last of the airplanes
i looked at him with some amazement
how do you get there i asked mean the last of the fighting airplanes he explained
if these raider johnnies have the ray you imagine and unless some means of protection against it can be devised the aeroplane will be of no use
think of dirigibles attacking a town with bombs and crashing all machines sent up against them
their power would be unlimited
but perhaps you and lamont have devised some means that may make the rays ineffective i looked him straight in the eyes and lied no i said and turned to find the president coming over to me minute jimmy said the president if commander seton will excuse us
i have been talking with dan lamont about that protective cage idea for these rays i got up with a look at the big englishman
he was smiling blandly and he shook his head at me in a way that made me feel very small for i did not know why i had fenced with him all along to lie to him at the finish
i saw little of kirsteen that evening
people drifted in later and between these her uncle lord almeric seton my father and danny she was kept too busy to spare more than a brief moment or two with me
it was from lord almeric that i heard history
ready for action had done well for his country in the war of and had come out of the struggle with a string of initials after his name representing the highest honors the allies and britain herself could give him
he fought as a sailor and as a flying man and in the latter branch had handled both aeroplanes and dirigibles
towards the end of the war he had gone back to sailoring and had finally retired with the rank of commander
he then took up business in london city and in the years had amassed it was said a fortune of half a million british pounds sterling
with this behind him he deserted the city and began to indulge a passion for exploration often being absent from england for months on end
he was now back
lord almeric thought after over a years absence
seton came to see us off to gardiner bay on sunday afternoon and he had great praise for the merlin
he was the only airman who ever inspected the machine who grasped the principle of the hovering arrangement straight off
there was something about the big fellow that moved me to a sincere admiration of him but i did hate to see him standing with kirsteen as we flew off
i knew it would be days before i could get back to washington and i was leaving him a clear field with the girl
still i had my job to do and in the face of that personal matters had to stand aside
we had to fit the merlin up with apparatus and go over every screw and pin of her
she had been flying for over a month with no more overhauling than milliken and myself could give her with the help of chance mechanics
she was due to be taken down and set up again by men who understood her if her high efficiency was to be maintained
we put dan ashore at the battery landingstage on the sunday evening so that he could go straight to his laboratory then we went on to gardiner bay where we found every man jack of the workshop hands waiting to see us arrive
it was their day of rest and since our departure they had been working at top speed on the making of machines from the merlin design but the boys had always been keen
they were more than just paid hands
anyhow the cheer that went up when the old merlin came to rest by the jetty might have been heard in new york
nothing would suit them but that i should tell the whole bunch of them collected in the erection shed the full story of our tossup with the airship
on the monday dan lamont turned up with two intenselooking assistants and a carload of materials
we handed over to the three of them a small draftingoffice where they immediately became happy in an outrageous tangle of wire and blue prints
i told dan i thought they were a messy gang but by the time we had the merlin overhauled and waiting to be put togrther again he and the solemn pair were on the mat with a neat cage affair and a string of black boxes all ready for fitting inside the engine cover
by thursday evening we were prepared for our second sally against the enemy and i had great hope that fixment would give us a better fighting chance
we arrived in washington early on the friday forenoon and almost the first person dan and i met there was commander seton
we ran into him in the foyer of the hotel
hullo boon
hullo lamont said he just the very men i was hoping to see off for the south at three oclock and i want you to lunch witlr me
miss torrance is coming and lord almeric if he can get away
why sure said dan right off
very glad to delighted i said
where and when
in the hotel here at one oclock
dan and myself went off to see the president and some of the officials who looked after affairs connected with the raids and at one oclock we found kirsteen and took her to the hotel
lord almeric sent his ex224 cuses
talk at lunchtime never seemed to be far from the raiders and our venture wonder i said just what the game is the big idea behind the raids wrong with asking
seton asked casually
asking said asking whom
asking the raiders he replied
qiristopher said dan lamont
funny nobodys ever thought of that they have wireless havenot they
seton went on
it should not be a matter of great difficulty to ask them what theyre up to
why donot you will i said
or see that theyre asked anyhow an attack on washington left washington at three and lord almeric joined us to see him go
he was going to new orleans
boon he said to me last of all and gave my hand a grip that nearly brought the blood out under my nails have a feeling that we shall meet again quite soon that
kirsteen broke in thought you were leaving america jumbo
well what of that laughed the big englishman
can you say in what part of the globe an ubiquitous fellow like boon will be three days hence i shouldnot be surprised to see him turn up with his machine in timbuctoo
timbuctoo
i said
is that your destination
timbuctoo
lord no
i only mean i have a hunch well meet in the most unlikely place sometime
that evening a message in the name of the president of the united states was broadcasted on the wave length used by the mysterious airship to the airship ark of the covenant with what object are these raids made on humanity
whitcomb president of the united states of america
stations all round the atlantic shores on our side and in europe took up the message and repeated it
every three hours the message went out
saturday came and passed
sunday passed
and still the message was repeated
news of the message germinated from a chance remark at a luncheon party got into the newspapers
it was featured with staring headlines and the people waited in breathless expectancy for the reply for most of the journals promised a special edition immediately the news came through
danny and i waited that sunday night in the white house while milliken stood by with the merlin
midnight came and the president still stubbornly believed that the message would come
i thought of going down to the basin and turning in on my boat ready to take the air as soon as the word came through the aerodrome radio
but mr whitcomb would not hear of it
there would be no delay he promised us and if we cared to sleep he would have the servants make us up a shakedown apiece
but i was not thinking of sleep for myself
i was thinking of sleep for the president and for a kirsteen who shared our vigil
now i would have the situation realized to the full
every radio station on the shores of the atlantic waited for the message that might come from the raiders and every one would take it with the directional detector open
it was a trap of sorts
some hundreds of stations would pick up the message and behind these stations planes lay ready to take the air to the place whence the message emanated
it was too much to hope that the raiders would reply from a base
none would know better than they the danger that lay in doing so
but it was hoped that their known daring would tempt them to reply from the airship not realizing perhaps the extent of the secret preparations that had been made for their next appearance
it might chance that they would reply from the middle of an encircling ring which would at once close down on them
one oclock on monday morning and still we waited
the hand of the clock slowly crept round to the halfhour and the chimes belled out half an old lutheran hymn tune
the vibration of the last unsatisfying note still hung in the air when a knock came to the door
it was a messenger with a radio flimsy in his hand read it aloud said the president
god bless us and give us mercy listen relayed from the pershing message begins regret to report total company of the ship rendered unconscious between the hours simday monday
following message found in radio cabin addressed to president whitcomb quoted message begins to the president of the united states of america from the airship ark of the covenant to stop war
quoted message ends position relayed message ends
a gasp went up from our little company
then silence
to stop war the president repeated at last worthy object indeed piracy robbery the worlds commerce and trade brought to chaos to stop war
what visionaries what madmen are these
shrewd madmen
i exclaimed
by this time they are six hundred kilometres from the position of the pershing
we might have known
not peace but a sword breathed mr whitcomb
peace by terror panic in the night
i darted for a chart that lay on a table near by degrees north degrees west i cried near home if you like
three hundred and fifty kilometres due east of this city up after them jimmy cried the president
beat the skies for them bring them down i put my hand on my flyingcoat which lay on a couch handy and kirsteen ran to help me
just then through the open window there came a wild shrilling of whistles from the streets of the city a hubbub and shouting
transfixed i stood with an arm in one sleeve of my coat the body of it hanging loose in hands and she by my side staring at the window with the rest of us
a faint explosion came from the grounds outside like the bursting of an electric bulb
quick
i shouted
the window danny
shut it quick
kirsteen mr whitcomb upstairs as fast as you can to the roof but even as i sprung for the door of the room i saw first danny succumb to the gas then the president
i was just in time to catch kirsteen swaying as she fell
by dint of holding my breath i manag to lower her gently on the couch then my overwrought lungs gave way
i sprang from tall cliffs into a balanced dive down dowd into depths that were dense indigo
the raiders answer rom gross darkness i swam upwards with a sense of wellbeing
into a cavern of deepest blue through cerulean and emerald into pearly grey and primrose i swept upwards to wake with a strange exhilaration in a blaze of light
somewhere near me clock chimes belled out half an old lutheran hymn tune
i found myself huddled at feet as she lay inert on the couch in the sittingroom
some one had thrown my flyingcoat over her
by the window now closed lay dan lamont and nearer the middle of the room with his head comfortably disposed on a pillow and with a rug thrown over him the president reposed
remembering i got unsteadily to my feet and as i looked at the clock and saw that it marked halfpast three my first thought was for kirsteen
i took her hand and patted it gently
she did not stir and i half strangled with a fear that she was dead
but she was breathing softly and i left her to cross to the president
he awoke at my touch
what what he muttered
what was that noise in the garden jimmy i helped him to his feet remember now
the raiders
yes sir i told him
we all have been asleep for two hours
he went over to kirsteen in a dazed way while i crossed to dan lamont
the president shook the girl softly by the shoulder and as i knelt by danny i saw her wake with a smile
i shook danny wasnot smart enough jimmy he muttered too quick that dope doesnot give you a chance
i helped him to his feet
gee jimmy he said with a faint grin been raided looks like it
i turned to the president and kirsteen and found them standing by the table in the centre of the room
on the table lay a paper
boys come here the president said and all four of us stood by him to read the message that lay before him
benjamin whitcomb it ran
you ask us what object we have in making these raids on humanity
here is our answer once more we make these raids on humanity for humanitys sake
our object is to put an end to war on humanity
if you as fte honest man you are known to be have a real love for humanity you will use your power and influence to further that object by whatever means you think fit
none knows better than you know how near the nations stand to the brink of war
until they resolve to step aside from the path that leads them to destruction our power will be used against them on land and sea
if you have eyes to see you will see
if you have a tongue wherewith to speak you will bear witness to the nations
that is our answer benjamin whitcomb
look to it that you answer as straightly
the league of the covenant
the madness of it muttered the president
do they think that nations can be reformed by the turn of a hand and yet the bigness of it man man if i were only foreman to god almighty he broke off and paced up and down the room
it is a great object if sincere he said as if we had not been there but these are not the means to accomplish it
will earthly fear drive out that sin which not the fear of god can subdue
no no
no wrong can right another
it is a menace a menace
it has brought the peoples nearer to war than further from it
it is a menace
he turned to danny and me but though he looked at us with blazing eyes he seemed to see beyond us will not turn back he said thickly
your task remains james boon
find me the nest of these visionary pirates and let us test their boasted powers these evangelists who do not scorn to fill their pockets as they preach
roust me them out james boon
you have behind you the whole of the united states
to it my son
yes sir i said quietly for i saw with surprise that he was not himself sir jimmy
dan
he turned to finger the paper that still lay on the table while kirsteen came with us to the door leave your uncle kirsteen i whispered
he is not himself he is better alone she replied
he is so terribly selfwilled that he hates being dictated to and he is mad with anger at the indignity of having been sent to sleep
but hes right
the raiders must be caught and punished
dan
good luck
she held out her hand to dan who grasped it for a moment then ran down the steps
jimmy
god speed you
i retained her hand for a moment
kirsteen
i blurted caught you as you fell
i know i canot do without you
is there any chance for me
jimmy jimmy she said gently
you have a mans task before you yet but there was that in her voice made my heart leap
i laughed and stopped to kiss her hand
well i said a mans task to tell a girl he loves her
i ran down the steps after dan
theory a we made our way down to the basin on the potomac dan lamont and i came on a num her of people still lying unconscious from the gas
they were at about the end of their sleep and the night was warm and mild so they could not come to much harm
we did not stop therefore to attempt to bring the sleepers round
at the landingstage everything was placid and quiet
the arcs were burning brightly and by their light we could see mechanics walking about or working here and there
milliken was fast asleep in the cabin and when we woke him we found that no news of the raid had yet reached the aerodrome
the message to the president had been picked up by the radio and on receipt of it several pilots had gone up to make for the position given by the pershing thought it was a bit like shutting the stable door myself said milliken seeing that the radio arrived over two hours after the doping of the battleship
when you didnot turn up i thought to myself that the plan had been changed and that you were after some other game
so i just turned in and had a sleep
while you were sleeping milliken said washington was being raided
he sat up at that
jinks he exclaimed
there wasnot a whisper of it round the aerodrome
i turned to dan
looks as if the folk that made the hubbub and blew whistles just before the gas caught us must have been doped too i said
looks like it danny replied a clean getaway milliken stared
what
were you doped then he asked
yes
the attack was on the white house
the president and miss torrance were put to sleep
for the first time in my experience of him i saw milliken grow really angry
the blood rushed to his face until it was black to the merlin but still fair enough for an airship
look at this morning
six hundred kilometres in two hours legs for an airship milliken insisted
here mr boon and you mr lamont just have a look at this
this map
i figure it like this he had dived into his locker and brought out a small scale map of the western hemisphere
on this he had drawn a complicated series of lines carefully tagging the longitude and latitude of each known raid
it was an interesting piece of work and it showed that old milliken was silent to some purpose if he thought the more
what do you think of it
i asked dan
christopher said he think got a i i i miss torrance he choked
here after them easy milliken i checked him gently
we donot know yet which way the raiders have gone
i had hopes that the aerodrome knew of the attack and had some idea of the direction they took
not a scout went up sir on account of the raid he said thickly
if only known have given them something the swine
dope a girl like miss torrance would they
look here mr boon mr lamont he went on presently in his normal voice been thinking this thing out in my own way been studying the map a bit and calculating distances and that worked out times too
from what i saw of the airship that day betting she has a fair pair of legs not up hot idea
good for you milliken
we went over the theory carefully once more checking figures
the idea was more than feasible betting then milliken that the base is somewhere on the spanish main i said to him
the spanish main he cried
why so it is
i never thought of it so but so it is
now wouldnot that be just the place for the dern pirates it was obvious that the romantic associations of the old name had fired the imagination of milliken but that did not affect the attractiveness of his notion
a feature of it was that he had worked the whole thing out on the basis of one airship
i thought this point a trifle stretched myself
it was giving the airship of the raiders a power that was simply miraculous but even worked out on the basis i held to that the raiders had stations on either side of the atlantic there was a good deal in the idea
i slapped my mechanic on the back anyhow enough milliken i said head south for a start when we flung open the gates of the boatshed and floated the merlin out into the basin we found that the news of the raid had got down to the airstation
it was now a scene of wild activity
from all directions came the hum of engines and mechanics were running about on all the platforms
when the merlin appeared in the open we were immediately surrounded by pilots and squadron commanders asking for the latest news
their news was more than ours and we did not waste time in telling them how we ourselves had been doped
nor was it necessary to inform them of idea
they were all under the central command and the information would only have made them restless
we left it alone and got ready to take off
where are you heading anyway some one shouted as we swung into the beam of light which gave us our path into the wind
us i yelled in reply with a strange feeling of exhilaration
why were heading south
contact milliken off to the spanish main the hum of the engine the merlin throbbed and as my mechanic climbed up through the hatch we lifted from the surface of the water and climbed swinging south for the old spanish mainland
it was after four in the morning when we took off from the basin and day was breaking as we reached flying height
less than an hours flight left cape lookout behind us and shortly after seven we were over the bahamas
the mass of cuba loomed up on a clear horizon sometime past eight and by ten oclock dan and i were breakfasting in one of the best hotels in kingston jamaica
so it may be guessed in what trim the merlin was that morning
milliken had relapsed back into his usual taciturn self and would not be persuaded to join us at the hotel
he preferred to remain behind with the merlin and cook his own breakfast on the gasoline stove
i fancied he was a little astonished at his own eloquence in the early morning for he was certainly piling up a new record for silence
he woke up enough however when we rejoined the merlin to plead that we rnake straight for maracaybo so redolent of association with the buccaneers
i had had another notion than to risk the probable discomfort of the venezuelan town but i decided that maracaybo would do for a start especially as it satisfied some hidden vein of romance in my robust artificer
let the reader examine map of the north atlantic at this point and learn what a curious fellow my mechanic is
maracaybo be it
i said to him
and lets hope your hunch leads to another slap at this modern morgan
we crossed the caribbean without mishap in good flying weather and made maracaybo an hour after noon
the town has a good harbor part of the landlocked lake of maracaybo excellent as a shelter for seaplanes but for reasons which have much to do with a personal bias to that virtue nearest godliness we decided to sleep on the merlin
we had filled up with gasoline at kingston and had sufficient aboard for a fairly long flight but it is always a wise plan to keep full tanks if good stuff is to be had
here we found some difficulty
the stuff the dagoes were willing enough to supply would have been too much for the digestion even of a truck
i was for letting the thing slide until we made another port but danny came out with a suggestion the matter with trying old aunt mandy again he asked an idea said try it
we hunted round until we found a general store and here sure enough we were able to buy a packet
on the packet the name of the local agent was given and an address so we looked the fellow up
senor fernando lopez was a stout and very tired spaniard it seemed at first sight a typical dago who had difficulty with english
he was too polite to yawn in our faces but he looked as if he would have liked to
and he did not change a hair when i casually flashed the star that was pinned to the inside of my coat
all he did was to waddle over to a door and push it open with a lazy wave of his yellow hand bidding us step inside
but once the door was closed on the three of us in that inner room senor fernando lopez spoke idiomatic american
say boys he said with a quick smile mighty glad to see you the trouble
i explained who we were and our present needs
aviation spirit said senor fernando
sure
so youre mr boon and mr lamont been hearing about you
glad to see you boys glad to see you
i have been wanting to see you for a week or two past
i was hoping youd drop in here one day funny to hear mr lopez i said in some surprise the merest chance that brought us to maracaybo
what made you think we might turn up sit down boys and tell you said he
no stop a bit better be comfortable he opened another door
this led into a courtyard a widish space with palms and flowers and surrounded by a sort of cloister of old arches
it was clean and sweet and cool and a surprising thing to come on after the hot and dusty narrow street from which one entered the building
we found comfortable american reclining chairs in the shade and when we were pugged down senor fernando clapped his hands spanish fashion
a softfooted yellow servant appeared and our new friend jabbered an order at him
next moment the servant was back with a tray of glasses a bottle or two and a bowl of ice wonot ask you what youll drink said fernando because i know whats best in maracaybo
i prescribe
he manipulated the bottles and whisked in the ice
the result was a beautifully colored bubbling drink in each of three long glasses
bury your noses in that said senor fernando
say boys mighty glad to see you he nodded and took a long pull at his glass an example that dan and i were apt enough to follow
i will say that senor fernando lopez could mix a drink
and now boys tell you one of the reasons why so mighty glad to see you he said apart from the fun of seeing your american faces
he leaned forward in this chair think youre on a hot scent down here
danny and you may be sure pricked up our ears
you mean the raiders
i asked
he nodded mysteriously
he had a funny little trick of a backward nod that seemed to call you closer
listen
there are rumors along this coast from here right along to port of spain aye and further of an airship crossing the coastline
at first when the news came out about these raids i thought it was only nigger and dago talk
but the thing has persisted been to the trouble of having the thing the rumor followed up and beginning to think theres something in it
so far only reported it to headquarters as perhaps dago and nigger fiction but now well i think it would pay you to haunt this coast for a spell
do you get me boys i have nothing definite to give you except my own opinion and that is there is something in it
we caught fire danny and a sudden appearance dined and slept in the house of senor fernando that night and from somewhere our host procured a supply of firstclass aviation spirit
his own men took it down to the seaplane and milliken looked after the replenishing of the tank
in the morning with a cordial invitation to make the house of our useful friend our own whenever we were in maracaybo we set off down the coast
for a week we haunted the sealine back and forward from maracaybo to cayenne without getting wind of our quarry
this brought us to the middle monday in june when for another week we were stormbound in maracaybo
the hospitality of senor fernando was limitless but our enforced inactivity was very galling
our only consolation was that if we could not take the air neither could the raiders
but by the saturday of the third week in june the tropical storm was over and again we set off down the coast of the main
we trailed along the leewards and on the sunday morning early got out from port of spain to search the lesser antilles for we were still keen on idea
then at eleven oclock that sunday we picked up a radio telling of an airship raid on shipping on the other side of panama
we made right back to maracaybo where we found senor fernando to whom we had radioed waiting for us in the harbor with a full supply of gasoline
we filled up and were off again came down at panama to seek information and we were told that the raids had taken place on the new zealand route off the galapagos
these islands were our next objective and we made them just on nightfall
we were mighty tired though by this time dan was up to handling the machine and had been spelling milliken and me but as we could find no safe mooring we took off again and reached guayaquil in the dark
here we found a mooring in the roadway of the bay and we hitched to it without asking permission
we set no watch but lay down to sleep determined to be stirring with the first streak of daylight
but when daylight came we landed on a piece of bad luck
it was just after four in the morning and milliken and i were going over the engine
a sudden imprecation from my mechanic made me go over to the side he was examining and i saw him gazing with a rueful face at the gasoline supply pipe to one of the starboard carburetors
it was snapped clean through close to the carburetor
well i said no use making a postmortem on the thing milliken better straighten one of the coils a bit and braze a new junction
right sir said milliken jind went to his locker for the necessary tools
although we had flown from maracaybo to panama and from there to galapagos thence to guayaquil i was not prepared to see the gasoline gauges so low
i concluded that there must have been a good deal of leakage from the fracture before it absolutely parted and i took one of the dago boatmen that were now round the plane and went ashore for a supply of the juice
my boatman was a traveled man and a linguist and i was able to make him understand what i wanted
he conducted me up the quay and led the way to a gasoline store sure enough but it was somewhere round halfpast four in the morning and there was nobody about
the place was shut
i was standing grumbling at the luck when suddenly my dago let out a yell and began pointing right above him into the sky
see senor he cried
look look
the airsheep a thrill ran up my spine for there high above the town like a tiny spear blade of silver in the growing light of the morning floated the ark of the covenant
i was sure of her
there were no two ships of the same design in the world unless they belonged to the raiders
it was galling i need hardly say
there lay the merlin in the roadway with a parted gasoline pipe crippled to a certain extent and with her tanks more than half empty and high above her the quarry sped serene and beautiful heading straight across the andes mad as i was i had the sense to take an accurate bearing of the airships course then i flung myself into a useless activity
i yelled at my dago and at the others who were gathering round
i threw money at them and made them hustle to find the man who ran the gasoline station
as good luck would have it he turned out to be a scotsman but it was fortyfive minutes before he made his appearance for he lived outside the town
when he did come he came running and he was still putting on his clothes as he came
in as few words as possible i explained the situation to him
bide a wee he said unflustered think
i could give ye petrol frae tins in the store but yd have to manhandle it to your plane and thatd take time
no by jingo
i have a tanker lying at the quayside bung fu o the juice
could ye manoeuvre your boatie alongside soon have your tanks u if ye can
in pursuit ive me a scotchman any day for sense i hustled into the boat and we pulled out to the merlin
milliken had the breakage fixed and we taxied the bus alongside the tanker
in no time had a pipe and a pump fixed between the tanker and the plane and in a little the tanks were brimming
how much is that mr i asked
damned if i know i didna measure he replied bother wit
off you go man send ye a bill but you donot know anything about me i trust me for that
off wi ye so he yelled at us from the side of his tanker dancing with excitement the while
we sheered off while he waved at us and we taxied down the roadway preparatory to taking off for our climb over the town
milliken and dan had both seen the airship and they confirmed my idea of her direction
soon we had left guayaquil behind and were climbing climbing for our flight over the andes
the verdure of the coastal strip passed beneath us and we rose over a still and rugged barrenness
up up we flew nor did we flatten to level flight until over eight thousand metres was showing
banks of clouds lay far below us
to either side and in front of us stretched the mountains their peaks glowing jewellike in the sun crimson saffron gold their hollows and deep canons cobalt purple indigo
range on range they stretched scaur and hump and tooth cleft and riven moulded and hewn
and everywhere an awful stillness a stillness that made the steady song of the seaplane seem sacrilege
below us no bird floated about us no wind stirred except for the wind of our own speed through the bitter air
all apertures of the cabin were closed we had the heaters on and we were breathing oxygen while compressed air was being fed to the induction of the cylinders
the speed dial stood at well over the five hundred kilometres mark and though our quarry was over an hour ahead of us we had great hope of overtaking her
time passed
danny shared the lookout with me while milliken rustled a meal to break our fast
when it was ready he took his share before relieving dan and when dan had eaten i gave the control to milliken and ate last of all
i wanted two pairs of eyes for the lookout all the time
yet for all our vigil we came upon no sight of the airship
we reckoned her speed at twothirds of our own so that if we were in her course we should have sighted her in about two hours flying
two hours passed and it seemed that she had escaped us
we kept heading in the same direction for about another halfhour then we consulted what to do
it was decided that we cast a wide circle to the north keeping high so i swung the merlin in a wide loop up into what must have been the southern border of venezuela
i reckoned to describe a circle five hundred kilometres in circumference which at the height we were flying would give us a vast area for scrutiny
we were now over the upper reaches of the northern confluents of the amazon and beneath us rolled endless miles of dark greengrey foliage
we saw here and there the silver gleam of water wide rivers that thinned were lost in the foliage and appeared again
but everywhere the dominant note was that hardly broken hue of dark greygreen
if the airship had been anywhere below us it would have been distinct against that sombre background
but time and again the distant gleam of water would deceive us would send us chasing at full speed and our circle grew very ragged of outline
the strain of flying at that height and speed was beginning to tell on us and our constant watch had wearied our eyes in spite of that uncanny alertness of perception which quick flight induced so at halfpast ten when we had cast two wide circles we voted a spell of rest and i searched about for big enough water in which to come down
we seemed to have missed our quarry entirely
then in the midst of that drab green monotony below us with its endless hummocks of undulating tree tops there came a break
from what appeared to be an area of marshland for it was speckled with water there rose a short incline of bush this was succeeded by a spear of plateau rising on tawny bluffs of rock
mighty interesting we found this plateau for from a point north of its centre line in a widening scar there stretched to one side of it a sudden patch of blood red
by chance i have hit on the right word to explain this red streak
it was more like a raw scar on the face of the world than anything else
from its starting point it widened as it ran transversely over the green tableland then began to narrow as it dropped over the bluff on the south side until it was lost in the green of the lower levels
seems to be some curious outcrop said dan it look sinister and cruel somehow hit it danny i agreed just what it does look
near this red streak but separated from it by a thickening band of green the plateau took another sudden rise in bushhung rocky bluffs and on this second step as it were there lay a wide expanse of water under the spurs of what from the map i judged were the foothills of the parima mountains land on the lake there said danny and maybe we can get down to look at that outcrop like to see that
the water seemed fair for landing and what was more important for taking off again so i let the merlin hover down gently to the face of the lake
i taxied a little on touching then switched off and let the way on the plane carry her until she was nosing into the trees and bushes that fringed the still water
the plateau of the red scar here was something uncanny about that lake though it was wonderfully beautiful
the trees round it were not extremely tall but they were straight and smooth of trunk fheir branches beginning to shoot out only at a good height
these locked with the branches of the others around until the foliage above was a thick canopy unpierced by the rays of the sun
the undergrowth was thick and luxuriant but not nearly so high as i had thought it would be
the prevailing color was a dusty green unbroken unrelieved except for the browner grey of the treetrunks or when some big butterflies gaudily painted and amazingly wide of wingspread would flutter swiftly by
now and then there would come the shriek of a bird shattering the stillness and intensifying it
i have said stillness but it was not so much that
a weird hushed murmur clung to the place the hum of insects the sound of a myriad life and under it all a mysterious deep chatter and whisper whisper and chatter so dead in tone as to be almost undefinable as sound
the place gripped
it almost sickened one with its intensity
and one could not tell what it was that gripped what brought the sickening intensity
here man was terribly puny in the face of immutable nature and my lovely merlin in her modernity was an offence
i think my companions felt much as i did but it wasnot a thing to talk about
we looked at each other with a sickly kind of gaiety like a lot of boys stolen into a cathedral in prohibited hours
milliken the practical made the first attempt to break the spell
he lit the stove and brought out the fryingpan
we had a sort of second breakfast ard then dan and i clambered ashore leaving milliken who would not be persuaded to leave the merlin to keep watch and ward
for our adventure danny and i took with us an automatic apiece and a pocket compass
both of us had flyingboots on so we felt safe enough about snakes which were all we thought we had to dread
it seemed impossible that there could be any human beings in that wilderness
we pushed our way westward through the undergrowth making for the bluff that overhung the plateau of the red scar and although the going was heavy it was not superlatively difficult
with half an hour of scrambling we were on the bluff and the oppression of the dark forest left us as we breathed the sweet air of its edge
down below us lay the tableland perhaps forty metres beneath and we could see the red outcrop plainly
water lay on either side of the plateau to the south a winding river with a creek running up to the cliff of the highland and to the north a small lake we had barely noticed in our approach by the air from the south
this lake was drained it seemed by another winding river that ran through a little gorge into the marshland surrounding the toe of the plateau
we found a place where the limestone was not so sheer and a way down that promised a fairly easy return
trees hugged the base of the bluff but we soon were quit of them as we worked towards the red scar for they thinned out until we were among bushes of the nature of myrtle
as we got nearer the outcrop even these myrtles thinned until they were far apart and strangely stunted in growth
then our feet crunched on the red earth
to me that earth seemed to be living
i felt the hair prickle on my scalp and i had a foolish impulse to jump back to the blacker and somehow cleaner soil
nothing grows on this red stuff whispered dan
see jimmy theres not a plant or a blade of grass on it and look how these myrtles are thinned and stunted until they are away back from it get off it danny i said donot like it
you feel that too he muttered suppose its the desolation of it but i have just the same feeling work round it then i said
danny did not seem to hear me
he was frowning at the earth and scrabbling amongst it speculatively with the toe of his boot
he turned over a piece of rock and stooped to pick it up
when he straightened himself his face was red but the color came from some suppressed excitement
look at this jimmy he said holding out the rock
do you know what it is
it was a cindery kind of rock blueblack in color with facets that shone faintly and a dusty layer saffron to deep rose in tint clung to a side of it
i had never seen rock like it before
no i said eat my hat if this the red stuff isnot rhodolite said dan his eyes dancing
well i said pettishly for i wanted to be off that red muck
rhodolite jimmy dan said solemnly and there wasnot so much of the boy about him now
rhodolite is one of the most highly radioactive ores that have been discovered
small quantities of it have been found in africa and i believe in peru
i have had pieces of it in my lab
but nothing nearly so good as this he crouched down now letting the red stuff dribble through his fingers have a hunch he said that all this scar is highly radioactive
that explains why nothing grows on it
see how the trees avoid it how the bushes close to it are poor and almost withered
yes get off it jimmy
the things alive
they meet again made our way back to the decent earth and worked northwards round the end of the red scar
we were a strangely silent couple then
dan had lost his boyishness and his face had a queer expression of power
i was getting a flash of the daniel lamont who could add so many letters to his name the daniel lamont whose word went with the leading scientists of the day
we trudged through the undergrowth in a norwesterly direction making for the edge of the plateau that overhung the little lake we had seen from the bluff above
with my heavier bulk i broke the trail my friend coming after me
i donot suppose we had been laboring twenty minutes before we were on the edge of the plateau
below us lay the little basin from which ran the winding stream but because of the configuration of the cliffs and their overhang our view was not very good
half the basin was cut off from sight by a ridge that ran out from the side of the plateau a mighty funny air about that place down there danny whispered when we had looked in silence for a minute or two
what is it jimmy donot know dan unless it is that its a little too trim for its surroundings think youve said it jimmy you say that the neck of the basin has been widened
or else why are the river banks there so sheer when at other places theyre undercut or fallen in
spades
i whispered say so
niggers
not the kind of thing niggers would do
we discovered a growing suspicion in each others eyes
what do you say to crossing the plateau to the other side i asked softly and seeing whats there
does it strike you danny that the little lake below must be filled from somewhere or else how do you explain the steady current into the river
that strip we took to be a creek on the other side maybe it flows under the plateau said danny investigate anyhow
we turned south and began to work down the west side of the scar
for a space the going was heavy but after a little the undergrowth began to thin out
the plateau seemed to be atout a kilometre wide perhaps more so with the heavy going at the start of our crossing the journey looked like taking us about half an hour
i wanted to clear the thing up get back to the merlin and be in maracaybo by nightfall
it was now long past noon somewhere about halfpast one and the heat was oppressive
we had to make our way back over the red outcrop climb the bluff and find our trail through the forest to the lake above and the erlin
my suspicion had died down
the whole place was so desolate and lonely so silent that to think we were somewhere in the neighborhood of the raiders lair seemed too farfetched
i was anxious to be on the chase again
danny however had some idea in his head
he was plugging along by my side with an alertness and keenness that i was at a loss to account for so after a long spell of silence my curiosity got the better of me
i turned to my friend and stopped him
come old man i said
out with it in your mind
honest jimmy he said donot know just a lump of suspicion that rhodolite you see got it sort of mixed up with radium you mean yes
confound it jimmy got to account for all that radium somehow i gazed at him for a second or two
all right dan i said go on but if theres anything in it were too far away from the merlin to be comfortable
we went on
i now caught more than a touch of excitement and alertness
we were pressing south a little westwards when suddenly we caught a gleam of something high and white among the greygreen of the foliage and towards this gleam we cautiously threaded our way
presently we were near enough to see that the whitish gleam came from a number of conical stone spikes standing high among the bushes
sinter cones whispered dan like those of hammam meskoutine in tunis hot spring yes
a gradual crystalline precipitation building up into a hollow cone
mighty queer plateau dan it is a mighty queer plateau jimmy he interrupted
just take a look at the peak of that middle cone
what would you say that shimmering haze was heat by hookey a kind of chimney
gimme a leg up jimmy whispered dan
and lets see what kind of heat we trampled through the undergrowth to the side of the middle cone and then i helped dan to climb up to the top
he put his head close to the mouth and sniffed cautiously
then he turned round and down to me with a face livid with excitement
jimmy i let him slide to the ground you see what it means jimmy he cried something doing underground the smell of petroleum by christopher jimmy i believe weve tracked them exactly said a familiar voice behind us
put up your hands messrs
james boon and company
we rather expected youd be dropping in one day
we turned in a hurry to find ourselves looking down the muzzles of three rifles projecting from the bushes
then behind a pistol in front of us the bushes parted
a big man rose up to his full height still covering us
it was commander seton
book two the personal narrative of sholto seton etc commander i the litter in the clearing i patience and determination have brought readers thus far in a particularly haphazard and illknit story apology from me for taking them back three years will be superfluous
pertinacity so singular though it be grown but from an irritated desire to finish a penance will find nothing daunting in even so drastic a backward leap
yet by way of apology for the retracing i am fain to say this much
if i am to achieve reasonable accuracy in my share of the history and if i am to make myself properly understood by the patient reader i can do no other
in the matter of introducing myself the flattering analysis of my character and the slight sketch of my history given by major boon in his narrative like the wound of klercutio though they are neither as deep as a well nor as wide as a church door they will serve
indeed they must serve faute de mieux since i have wasted much breath and time in urging boon to alter them or delete them altogether and i cannot begin to give my own version
in justice to myself and you i am compelled to say further that the pen is a most unfamiliar implement to me my wildest hope is that i may spin a plain yam
true i have gained a measure of courage for my task through watching the airy insouciance with which boon has been pounding out chapters on his typewriting machine and i tell myself that if he can be without bowels of compassion for his readers so surely can as i go along i shall try to vamp something of a technique from him and from other great writers and so win through with what credit i may three years then before that morning in march when the ark of the covenant dropped silently from the skies upon the financial center of new york i was with two expetty officers of his royal navy and a handful of indian bearers among the upper reaches of the rio negro that northern tributary of the amazon
of the reasons and the urges which took me into such an isolated and labyrinthine tract of wilderness i shall say little
they are personal and might easily be tedious
i was seeking what i might find in unexplored country
higgins grumstock and myself came upon many things of a strange nature in that wilderness but by far the strangest thing that happened to us was the finding of him whom we afterwards were to know as the master
it was towards nightfall of a teeminghot day
we were about to make camp by the side of an unnamed river tributary to the negro and were looking for some place suitable when suddenly we broke into a small clearing in which were the remains of a recent camp
so recent indeed were these remains that there where a nights growth will obliterate anything but the deepest of mans handprints the undergrowths were still trampled and awry
about the clearing empty boxes with smashed lids were scattered and these brought to the scene such evidence of haste and confusion that interest was at once deeply stirred
i knew of no party ahead of my own nor was there wind of any coming down from the borders of venezuela or colombia
it was unlikely in the latter case that the explorers had passed us since it was impossible that they had crossed unnecessarily to the other side of the river or had strayed far from its bank
from the indications around we were forced to the sinister conclusion that the former occupants of the clearing had been attacked by indians
no sane explorers would have indulged in the frenzy of breakage or the partition of stores which was shown
i resolved therefore with the help of my two men to arrive at what solution i could of the mystery
as a preliminary to the search we made camp then and there
the bearers were ordered to unload and pile stores
higgins and grumstock avid for anything which promised a break in the monotony of weeks of toilsome journeying quickly had the tents erected and with that unfailing lingua franca by which the british seaman makes himself everywhere understood badgered and cajoled the indians into unheardof activity
our search was not of long duration
a sudden shout took me hurrying back from the side on which i had started investigations to the other and here a little way deeper in the forest i found my two men in awed contemplation of a roughlymade litter which was slung at a fair height between two trees
in this litter a white man lay to all appearance dead
he was a small man and my two helpers had no difficulty in unhitching the litter from the trees or in conveying it to the nearest tent my own as it happened
under the powerful light of a petrol lamp i made examination of the stranger and i found his heart though scarcely discernible was still beating
even with that medical knowledge which i have it was plainly manifest to me that collapse had followed fever and partial starvation and i began to administer gentle stimulants and easy nutritives
my labor was rewarded by a slight strengthening of the heartbeat but there were no signs of returning consciousness
i stripped the man to put him into clean linen and i was horrified to find that his body was terribly burned
a great patch on the left side was deeply raw and inflamed and most nauseating feature of all the left hand seemed to have been burned off from above the wrist
it was a marvel that the man remained alive
these were injuries which i despaired of treating adequately from my little medicine chest and i should have been completely at a loss what to do had the stranger not had the means of treatment with him
in the litter whereon he had been lying we found beside a washleather bag apparently containing geological specimens a large pot of reddish ointment clean and fresh
i could find faint traces of this ointment on the fair skin round the burns and i thought the wisest thing in the circumstances was to continue the use of it
i took clean strips of medicated linen and with loose bandages of these i applied the ointment to the dreadful wounds
it was two days before the man opened his eyes
we had not attempted to break camp and our stay in the clearing had been without event
the return to consciousness was abrupt
i went into the tent to see how the patient was progressing and found myself gazing into the mildest pair of blue eyes i have ever seen
mild though they were yet something lay in their depths that one met with a shock almost physical
what is your name the stranger asked levelly
sholto seton i replied
an explorer
in an amateur way yes
how long ago is it since you found me he demanded
it will be fortyeight hours ago at seven this evening
you were in a litter slung between two trees
yes
i made my bearers put me there
what day of the week was that monday
monday i said
yes
this is the third day of the sun since i became unconscious
it was on monday that my bearers deserted me
you were in the nick of time mr seton am i right in the form of address
you have the look of authority that comes from command am by courtesy commander seton lately of the british navy i replied
but do you think you should talk sir shall finish in a moment said this strangely selfcontained patient
with what have you been treating me i explained what i had done
excellent
now commander seton i am afraid i must draw on your patience and good nature to the extent of relapsing into unconsciousness for another day
continue the treatment especially the ointment which you must not attempt to vary in any way
it is adequate in itself
thank you
and until this time tomorrow when i shall waken in complete command of myself goodday
he closed those remarkable eyes of his and was asleep
i was left with the impression despite his utmost frailty of physique of a personality nigh ruthless in dominating willpower a personality which gripped with hoops of steel and of a courage in the face of what must have been agonizing pain which nearly appalled
for the space of ten minutes i think i stood where i was
then i tiptoed over to look down at him
he had not fallen asleep
he had relapsed back into a state of deep unconsciousness
i marked the broad brow and deep head of the thinker the exquisite placing of shapely ears the fine setting of the eyes the clean chiselling of the nose
through a thin brown beard and moustache could be seen a mouth in shape at once firm and mobile
it was a head in a million satisfying ones senses with both beauty and power
in spite of the luxuriance of his fine brown hair i judged him to be from fifty to sixty years of age
i stole from the tent
seton enlists recovered as i have seen a boxer recover between rounds deliberately
he rested deliberately relaxing until he was ready to stir and it was a fortnight before he moved from the tent
i had not asked his name nor did i ever ask his name
from the first i called him sir until it came to the time when i openly called him master
strange though it may seem from the first i knew that he had but to lift a finger and i would obey his behest
nor do i think i ever departed from my manhood right in giving him such service
it was a fortnight before he began to speak at any length and in this silence it seemed that he rested his brain as deliberately as he did his tortured body
my two seamen higgins and grumstock accepted him as i did and they almost fell over each other or even out with each other in their desire to do him service
i shall not readily forget our first long talk deep in the heart of the murmuring forest
it was night and we were in the tent together for we shared it now he was fit to walk abroad
i was putting some notes together of my observations in exploring when suddenly he spoke
seton he said am ready to talk if you are
yes sir i said as readily as though a talk had been prearranged am ready
it was a matter of turning my campchair to face him and then he bade me tell him of my experience in the war of i had none of the hesitation i should normally have felt at obeying such a request
i told him all i had done from start to finish
would you have it happen again he asked when i had finished
noy sir i said truthfully hope we have seen the last of war forever vain hope my good seton he said quietly
the nations of the earth have forgotten
they have forgotten the bloodshed and ruin of those terrible years the martyrdom of women the sacrifice of men
too quickly have they forgotten
lust and anger sway them and the greed of gain jealousy of their neighbors
in their blindness they would repeat those awful years know i said
they are fools
i give them another three years and some of them will be at it again
it will be bigger than ever
i knew my hope was vain when i expressed it sir
three years he said half to himself
it could be accomplished in three years
then aloud are you a rich man seton have rather more than half a million english pounds
how much of that fortune would you give he asked if it were guaranteed to you beyond any possible doubt that war could be stopped forever on this earth every penny of it sir i said
and if seton if i offered you that guarantee
why sir listen to you help he looked at me in silence for a minute
from far away in the forest around us there came a deep boom as of a great bell suddenly smitten
what it was i cannot pretend to say but the forest is like that
a great noise quite inexplicable then the silence once more save for the neverceasing whisper that hardly breaks the uncanny stillness
seton said the man earnestly want your word that if you cannot believe what i shall tell you if you cannot see your way clear to stand by my side i want your word that you will never repeat a syllable of it to ears other than mine that you will lock it up in your heart forever give you my word sir
then the master laid bare his plan to stop war
even now with the years behind me when i worked by his side my brain reels as i remember that night
far into the night the master talked patiently explaining to my lay understanding secrets that have revolutionized science
he told of the mighty power which had come into his hand after years of endless labor of picking up discarded threads at first thought useless of following up paths of promise which ended in disappointment and in the end of the discovery of a further path which even he with all his magnificent intellect dared not pursue to its end
it was unbelievable yet i believed
in the hollow of that frail hand its fellow lost in indescribable suffering and torture in the search for that terrible secret there lay the power to free mankind or to destroy to lay waste the whole earth aye and worlds beyond
i believed but belief was agony
hour after hour he talked in that tireless untiresome level voice of his
a litte man frail suffering the tortures of the damned from great cracking sores yet placid mild gentle with never a wince never a smile even to mock his anguish
years of calvary lay behind him and a quarter of a century of ceaseless toil
i say no living man could endure as the master endured
as he spoke to me in the forest that night i began to think that everything but the will was gone body soul everything which goes to make up the moving whimpering purposeless thing we call man everything but the will
the will and the vision
yet as i look back on the years that began that night remembering the love i bore him and the tender winning ungrudging patient something that emanated from him to wrap me to him i hope and pray that more than the will was left
and so he finished and so my dear seton that afternoon when i opened my eyes and saw you i believed that at last i had found my lieutenant
i believed that at last the path towards realizing my dream was opened for me
are you the man sholto seton
think well for here is the least i will take from you the most i will offer you
three years of belief of unswerving devotion to my cause
three years of unremitting toil without reward except that which will come from the cause itself
i offer you no more
i will take no less
as i rose from my chair my whole body was quivering and i was soaked in perspiration
i could not answer him
i reeled to the tent door and out into the open then stumbled across the clearing to the riverside
i put my head on two hands crossed against a big tree and do what i might i could not hold myself from a terrible dry sobbing
when i lifted my head a faint light was beginning to steal through the leaves overhead and birds were beginning to chatter
i walked back to the tent
he was still in his chair as though he had not moved
well seton
yes sir i said if youll have me
that is well he said
and now my dear fellow find what remnants of sleep you can
we must begin at once and i have much to tell you yet
off to the plateau i the cool of the following morning we broke camp and set off on the long trek back to manaos
of the journey there is little of moment to tell
i had made my own arrangements for retiring from the wilderness and they were fresher for being used a little earlier than i had anticipated
i had a bungalow outside the town of manaos and there i took the master and my two men
i had paid off the bearers a good deal higher up the river and we finished our journey on a powerboat of mine
the washleather bag which i had thought contained geological specimens proved to have in it a collection of the finest rough brazilian diamonds it has ever been my fortune to see
the master in the characteristically sparing way he had simply stated that he had discovered a pipe of them in the higher reaches of the negro and his idea was that funds for beginning our work should come from the sale of these uncut gems
i had to go to amsterdam to dispose of them and it was also agreed that i should begin to liquidate my property by degrees so that no suspicions would be aroused
i left grumstock with the master at manaos and took higgins with me to europe where from a list provided me i began to buy chemical and physical plants for the work the master had to do
i had in fact to bring together all the instruments necessary for a small laboratory
it was ten weeks before the liner dropped me and my stores at manaos
i found the master greatly recovered and grumstock very much installed as his bodyservant cook and housekeeper
grumstock informed me quite gratuitously that he was ready to follow the owner as he called our leader anywhere
on this hint i found it expedient to outline the plan to my two old petty officers and i was gratified to find them willing and eager to come into the scheme
thus we had two good men tried men honest and handy as a nucleus for our crew
a few days after my reburn to manaos we began our voyage up the river
at a former base where i was friendly with a local headman i was fortunate enough to secure a fine lot of bearers
among the stores they carried were the sections of a goodsized canoe
grumstock was an efficient carpenter and the plan was to finish our journey by water after he had put our little craft together
this plan the master assured us was possible
it was perhaps as well that the plan included the i took this report to our leader
yes yes seton he replied
it is a point in our favor
the scar is there on the plateau a red outcrop of radioactive minerals which i hope to be able to use to some purpose
nothing will grow on the outcrop and at certain times of the year water or wind through some underground passage of the plateau gives out a terrible howling
hence the fear of the natives
but as i say a point in our favor since we may work unmolested
when we reached the water the relief of the bearers at being dismissed was evident
we had no sooner freed them than they trooped off back the way we had come and they were i think not a little scared for us
the work of putting together our canoe occupied the oifthc hsin of the stein dismissal of our bearers when we took to the water for as we approached the end of our portage it became manifest that the indians were growing restless and uneasy
i was afraid that they were about to desert us and i searched for the reason of their unrest but found the more intelligent of the bearers unwilling to talk
it was higgins who brought me the clue
as far as i can make out sir he explained headin due and proper for a place they call the hill of spooks
another name they give it is the wound in the world
accordin to them niggers theres a great big bloody scar in the body of the earth somewhere near ere and every now and then you can hear the earth howlin and groanin wi the pain from it
it was old that told me about it and a scared nigger he was too when he said it
i got it from him by degrees like
grumstock and higgins and myself less than a day and when we had her in the water we found her admirably suited for our purpose
she held our stores easily and there was sufficient room left to afford our leader his ease or as much ease as his poor body would allow him together with space for the adequate handling of her
into the cavern i the early morning we set out for the mysterious plateau
i shall say nothing of the journey except that it was arduous
major boon has given a fairly accurate description of the lay of the land about the plateau
its main axis ran from east to west and the toe lay among marshy ground thickly grown with bladed plants and the myrtle and veronica type of shrub common in the district
on the north a little basin lay under the plateau cliffs and our approach was by a river which flowed from this basin through a gorge quite navigable and bore in a westerly curve from a cup of land of which the plateau was the southern border
on the south side of the plateau another river lay or rather a backwater of that river which i shall call the rio innominata
we did not realize at our first approach of the plateau that it would have been possible to cut off several leagues of travel by making a portage to that backwater of which both entrances were cut off from the main stream by a mass of fallen timber very much overgrown
we took instead the longer way
out of the rio innominata at a good number of kilometres downstream from the backwater we turned into the basin river and described a wide loop to the north of the plateau
from the map it will be seen that both the innominata and the stream from the basin in the northward cup flow west for the greater part of their courses and that the former turns south at last to curve into an easterlyrunning tributary of the negro in subsequent vo5rages the longer route i have indicated was always followed and as a precaution against being detected we left the overgrown entrances to the backwater undisturbed
the basin to the north of the plateau was overhung by great limestone bluffs which from the top must have hid half the basins area and this impending wall of rock was pierced by a great arch that led to a cave under the plateau cave and basin being joined by water
it was with a sense of awe having lit the acetylene searchlight in the bows that we began to paddle into the cave
the light but faintly illumined the vastness of the underground cathedral in which we now found ourselves
the ceiling was roughly arched and in its shadowed height one imagined that a fantastic pattern of vaulting could be traced
here and there stalactitic pillars of great girth gave color to the gothic effect
we became conscious of the roar and plash of falling water then deep in the heart of the cavern we came on a waterfall in which from a height of about forty metres a swift stream tumbled in great volume
by jove sir i whispered to our leader what a chance there for power
yes he replied
but you will find the fall the least of the wonders i have to show you
bear over to the right higgins please
i now saw that from the main cavern other caves ran out on either side several of them with floors sloping clear of the water line
two of these in particular on the west with a common mouth to the main cavern were ideal for docking and building the airships which were part of our scheme
with our leader i went ashore to examine these two caves and he led the way into an inner cave rather smaller than the other pair
here seton he said we are standing i am certain on the down slope of an anticlinal fold
see how it runs down under the basin of the main cavern
at the toe of the plateau which i take to be the further slope of the saddle i found among the marshes certain indications of the presence of petroleum that greenish scum which i dare say you know i nodded
very well then
if it can be avoided we do not wish to drill for our oil in the open but i think if we drill here we may do so with a reasonable hope of striking
we passed round a wall of rock into another inner cave
if we block up this cave having first made certain that there is no other outlet said the master you think my good seton we shall have an adequate reservoir for our crude oil why yes sir i replied in bewilderment at the completeness of the thing few bags of cement would put it right
exactly
now on the other side of the main cavern there are other caves i should like you to see
i am inclined to think that we shall have our refinery and machine shops over there
and i believe we shall find ample ventilation
from the main mouth of the caves a ledge ran on the east side to widen out into a spacious floor on the left of the big central cave
this was so wide and deep that it was easy to picture an extensive machine shop there with plenty of room left for the oil refinery
our power was handy to it for the waterfall was only a few paces round the corner of rock
we paddled deeper into the cavern and found that it extended the whole width of the plateau in a winding course of waterway
at the other side the south egress was given by an opening with little headroom to a small creek joining the backwater of the rio innominata
there was some flow of water from the fall to this outlet but the main run was to the northern opening
the land about the plateau was very flat
we returned and our leader showed the way into a cave near the main entrance on the west side
we had to climb into this cave which was so close to the plateau side that light percolated through from the open by several cracks
the cave was one of a series on the same level high and dry and apparently well ventilated
these it was easy to decide would be the living quarters of the crew when it was formed
while higgins and grumstock brought out stores into the living cave by means of a hastily rigged block and tackle i found a pickaxe and began to widen one of the crevices to the open air
it was easy labor for the rock here was pliable and i soon had hewn a biggish window permitting a view of the cuplike hollow to the north of the plateau
the stores were brought up
grumstock and higgins fell to setting out shipshape sleeping quarters and presently to cooking a meal
we passed the night in better conditions than either the master or myself had ever experienced among the upper waters of the amazon
we were thousands of miles from the nearest civilization right in the heart of virgin forest and as cut off from the knowledge of man as if we had been in another world
the gas found i the morning after an invigorating plunge and swim in the clear cool waters of the cave we set about forming a laboratory for our chief
we had no wood with which to set up benches so we cut a deep ledge into one of the walls of the cave and shovelled the debris out of the window opening
when we had made a good enough ledge to set out all the instruments and the plant our leader required and had undercut it so that he could have comfort in standing close we levelled the floor
meantime the chief had been exploring alone
grumstock with his ready wit had fixed thole pins in the after part of the canoes thwarts and had provided a long paddleoar so that the master could maneuver the little craft with his single hand
he had been away several hours and i was beginning to think it time i went in search of him when he returned
could you spare half an hour from your labors seton to come with me he asked
certainly sir shall require a widenecked bottle
could you find me such a thing grumstock dunno about a bottle sir the seaman said doubtfully
what about a picklejar sir
excellent if it has a stopper
stopper sir yes sir got one of them that works with a lever expanding thing sir said grumstock with an air of being meticulously accurate to the man of science
the seaman washed the jar carefully and with this and a bundle of candles we set out have found a light gas seton the master explained in one of the high caves beyond the fall
i was climbing up into it with the naked light of a candle when suddenly i found difficulty in breathing and the candle went out
i quickly retreated and now we are about to take a sample
i need your two hands and strong lungs
we were paddling across the main cavern and he stooped over the side to the water and filled the jar which he carefully stoppered
we landed on the eastern side and began to climb into a sort of tunnel he leading
we had mounted some distance when suddenly his candle went out and he came back hurriedly
we now were outside a smallish cave above the level so i imagined of the main cavern roof
now seton the chief said this is what i want you to do
take the picklejar
how long could you hold your breath
about half a minute probably more
that will do
i want you to run up into the gas holding your breath
raise the jar above your head and let the water pour out
keep the jar mouth down and as soon as it is empty of water stopper it
then come back as quickly as possible understand sir
the idea is to get as far into the gas as is safe
two steps higher when your candle goes out will do
just see how long you can do without a breath
i tested myself with the stophand of my watch and found i could do fortyfive seconds easily
excellent
now donot run any risks not powerful enough to drag you out you understand
right sir take care
i took the candle and the jar and began to climb holding the light over my head
as soon as the light went out i dropped the candle and took a breath easily then ran up about four paces
i let the water out of the jar as i held it up and quickly replaced the stopper
i retreated with some wind to spare
well done seton cried the master
and now to see the nature of the gas
it is light and i should say inert
we returned to the cave in the cliff and spent the rest of the day in arranging the scientific instruments helping our chief to prepare for his first test of the gas
he explained that it could not be a thorough test but that he might be able to determine the nature of the stuff
that night i retired to the cavern where the two seamen slept and turned in alongside them leaving our leader working by lamplight
in the early morning i wakened to find him standing by my bedside
seton he said believe we have discovered a new light uninflammable gas and i think we may have enough to lift our airship
we have saved months of labor by the find
you must set out for europe again as soon as possible
forming a crew iggins came with me in the canoe for the first stage of my journey to europe and when he had put me on land for my solitary trek down the negro he left me to return to the plateau
i had little difficulty if it took me some time in reaching manaos where i found a passage to new orleans
my purpose in making for this american port was simple for there i had a friend on whose discretion and help i could implicitly rely
this was a southerner an american gentleman of the finest type and one of those who in the early part of the european war had found a way into the british flying service
we had worked together in the service and i knew my man for a closemouthed shrewd and capable fellow who none the less permitted deep languor and slow drawling speech to belie a mind well above the average for alertness and keen business instinct
lippencott for that was his name was a trader in new orleans and i had decided on him subject to his consent as the most important link we should have with the outside world
i went straight to him and explained the scheme without reserve
he agreed to help
i placed a large sum of money to his credit and gave him lists of the plant and stores he was to purchase for us lists which the chief and myself had gone over thoroughly until we knew we had missed nothing
lippencott anticipated no difficulty in meeting our requirements and agreed to scatter the orders so that any trace would be difficult to find in the future
at the plateau we had for example to drill for oil which entailed the purchase of drills and casing with the necessary power and a small refining plant
then we had the gas to tap the chief having become certain that a sealed reservoir lay behind the wall of the cave in which we had taken the sample and this meant the buying of rock drills and piping
for utilizing the water of the fall we needed hydraulic mains turbines and dynamos
plant for the machineshop was the next consideration with small motors for the lathes and so forth
we had to have cement for bedding down the engines
and finally we needed agricultural implements seeds potatoes so that we could cultivate enough land to supply vegetables for the crews of the airships when they should arrive at the plateau
to the task of collecting all this mass of material lippencott applied himself with a devotion and energy which even his lackadaisical demeanor could not disguise and he was the means of putting two of our best officers in our way
setori he drawled at me have a young brother who could do with having the edge of a pretty large deviltry rubbed off
could you find a place for him in your crew let me have a look at him lippencott i replied
you can understand that i must make no mistakes in my men
sure said lippencott and stretched a lazy hand for the telephone
dave he said when he had the connection just look in here for a moment
i want you to meet commander seton
contrive not to be arrested for speed on your way here
speed fiend is he
and then some said lippencott
but no hog a wizard at the wheel and so far hasnot killed even a chicken
drove a french ambulance because he was too young for the army
david lippencott was a slim dark young fellow with deepset eyes perhaps a little too close together for frankness but his mouth was large and goodnatured
he had the same appearance of languor as his brother but a glance was sufficient to show that his quality of muscle was of the stringy untiring kind
i liked him at first sight
yes commander seton he said when after an hour or two of his company i put the thing to him like to join you
but like you to give a friend of mine steve curtis a chance of joining too
good man is he
you bet and can keep his mouth shut too like steve his brother affirmed
thus before i had been in new orleans two days i had enlisted the services of three good men including travers lippencott our master of supply
steven curtis was a fairhaired sturdy young american short and wide shouldered with a voice i discovered that might have charmed the heart out of a brass buddha
he wrote his own verses and composed his own tunes and sung them to an accompaniment on the guitar
he also could whistle as i have never heard man whistle in my life
these gifts it will be understood were valuable assets where it was contemplated to keep men away from civilization for some years
in addition steve was like young lippencott given over heart and soul to internalcombustion engines
my visit to new orleans saved me much time for there through lippencott i heard of a small river vessel being offered for sale
she was old but in good condition a motorship with twin engines of the diesel type
she had started life as a steamer on the waterway on whose banks she was built the clyde and had afterwards been converted to internalcombustion engines
under thirty metres in length not too broad of beam and drawing slightly over two metres loaded she was just the kind of vessel that i had hoped to purchase in britain and bring over the atlantic on a false bottom
i bought her through my master of supply and gave orders to have her altered for carrying cargo
as lippencott and i turned ashore from our inspection of the little vessel and paused by the gangway in talk a strange figure seated on a bollard close by came gradually into our consciousness
the figure was strange because it was foreign to the atmosphere of the place
a very stout man it was who regardless of the heat of the day wore a thick blue pilot jacket
he was smoking a rakish and slim clay pipe beautifully colored and with a rugged thick hand on either knee he was gazing at the ship and us with an air of placid contentment
now and again by a slow movement the pipe would be removed to permit of expectoration over the quayside the hand would return to the knee and the bovine gaze would come back to the little steamer and to us
there was something so familiar about the placid stolidity of the mountainous figure and the contrasted fragility of the slender clay pipe that for a moment i thought i was dreaming
i crossed over to the bollard and stood in front of the man
then with the same placidity the amazing unprehensile clump of fingers of one hand were stretched out to com slowly to the peak of the cap and the huge figure slowly rose
a deep husky voice rumbled up from vast depths
commander seton sir it rolled ye a good day sir
bless my heart and soul
i exclaimed
smithers aye aye sir i smithers it is sir as wus with you sir on the cruiser dorset
happy to see ye so earty sir pretty bobbish yourself i should think
aye sir bobbish thankee kindly sir
and what are you doing in new orleans smithers he hoisted back his big shoulders and brought his oxlike eyes into a fixed stare at me
like this sir he rumbled was secondclass warrant shipwright on the orleans arter the wawer
i jined er sir arter you got to flyin like
an wen they retires me as in the course o natur they was bounter do not avin any womenkind like an thinkin wi my weight as settlin down would make me eavier i makes up my mind jest for somethin ter do like ter go round an visit all the places as the ships i been on wus named from
he paused for a breath and to take another hitch as it were on his walleyed gaze
the george he explained wus easy a little pub down barkin way o the name
i ad a bit o trouble ter find the minotaur but i comes on another pub o that name outside davenport
i finds arethusa good ope the lion intrepid marlborough wi difficulty more or less but i finds them pubs mostly fact in natur sir as so many of is ships should be called artet pubs ainot it sir
extraordinary
i agreed for i wanted to hear the end of this peculiar odyssey
dorset wus easy
i just goes down ter weymouth an as a quart at the anchor for the sake o old times so to speak
the temeraire wus bothersome but i gets down ter demerarar as bein as near as i could find
orleans brings me ere though i done the french one too to make sure but she was a new ship an goin ter do the amazon sir n then be finished
and what then i asked
then sir he said impressively then goin ter find a quiet retired spot were i can just sit an think or mebbe not think at all if i like
would you take a job that would give you a chance to sit and think from me
ah take any job from yoii sir
very pointedly
right
if youll look after this steamer for me until i get back from england take you to the amazon and find a quiet spot for you there
so i secured sleepy sam smithers a very important cog in the mechanism for a time as you shall learn and i pictured with some amusement the delight of higgins and grumstock when they found their old shipmate joining them
i now left the work in new orleans in the hands of lippencott with his brother steve curtis and smithers to help him and set out for england where i hoped to recruit another halfdozen men from among tried comrades
back to the plateau a lmost the first person of my acquaintance whom i encountered in england was the young marquis of devonridge
he was coming down the steps of the wanderers club as i ascended them
hello jumbo he exclaimed using the nickname my bulk has given me
got back from bugstalking in the wild and woolly have you
got a good show of heads
fairish i said
doing anjdhing particular for the next three or four years pip suppose the next three or four years will find me dodging the taxgatherers as usual
why
thinking of taking pity on a poor landowner had thought of it pip
but i understood that you had sold all the devonridge property
your understanding my dear jumbo he replied has lost nothing of its limpid clarity
except for a cottage or two given over to old servants devonridge is a barren title these days
if youre really game to take me out of this demagogueridden country you may enlist my services for the next four years at the remarkable stipend of say ten shillings a week
that is to say to wit and videlicet for five florins per week you may acquire a cooksecretarychauffeurgunbearer warranted free from vice clean about the house faithful willing sober industrious surprisingly honest and guaranteed to eat out of the hand
do you go me jumbo go you pip
come and have lunch
very good sir
and his lordship touched his hat obsequiously
we had not much opportunity for talk during lunch
the wanderers was usually crowded but after we had fed devonridge and i strolled down to his rooms at the foot of st street and there i outlined the scheme to him
my dear jumbo devonridge said when i had finished on
qa va sans dire as the french always say in novels writ at tooting
but i donot want you to take me on false pretences
the idea of stopping war conveys absolutely nothing to my young mind except regret if the scheme wins out that we shall put a lot of honest lads belonging to my own class and a jew or so out of a job
natheless did you mark the word jumbo natheless i am with you not out of any highfalutin notions but for the lark
there wonot be much lark about it pip
trust me to get some fun he smiled
but hang on till you release me and do my best for my mob you may be sure take you on those terms pip
righto
and now i suppose you want more men
my object in england can help you there said devonridge know all the good men in london and all the rotters too
philip bentinckscrope marquis of devonridge in england and baron craigfeanteoch in scotland thus became my lieutenant while i remained in britain
he was invaluable for he enlisted the services of three young men of good family whom i knew by repute
they all had honorable records of service in the european war two serving at sea and the other with the ar force and all of them had been wounded
the last statement brings up an odd fact i was beginning to note
with the exception of the master the whole of the crew up to date had suffered from wounds taken on active service and when i brought in three other men two mechanics and an instrumentmaker who had served on airships with me the tally was not broken
i need not enlarge on the characters of these men three were of the gay and welldressed rather slangy type he represented if i except one a quite big young man named billy haynes who had sleepy sam oxlike stare and no great gift of speech
my two mechanics i knew to be capable and trustworthy men quite ready to be plucky if occasion demanded it but with the fine mechanics logical habit of reasoned speech and movement
my third the instrumentmaker was a little slight man named thetford a perfect genius in the matter of the fine adjustments required by his trade
i knew him to be a man absorbed in his work and a tireless worker
in selecting these men particular care had to be taken that they were without connections who would worry about their absence
with the exception of thetford who had a sister none of the six could think of any relatives or friends who would be likely to get up a hue and cry for them if a reasonable yarn of exploration was spun
i arranged that money should be sent at regular intervals from new orleans to sister and that he should write to her as if occupied in that city
within a fortnight of my arrival in england i was on my way back to america with seven men
lippencott had wasted no time
the clutha was ready for sea and a good part of her cargo had been stowed
he had found papers to account for our voyage and had created the amazonas exploration company to account for our stores
we embarked young lippencott steve curtis and sam smithers together with the english members of our crew and under my command the good ship clutha set out in fair weather for the brazils
through the jungle made manaos without trouble for apart from thetford all my men were more than amateur sailors and engineers
i did some business at manaos connected with the buying out of a moribund trading company and we proceeded on our voyage upstream
by this business we made a good acquisition
at a place high up the negro where it was joined by the waters of another river there stood an ancient wooden bungalow with storehouses attached which had belonged to the moribund company
some distance above the compound the placid flow of the negro was broken by rapids impassable for any craft whatever and below the compound some kilometres downstream the tributary tumbled into the negro over shallow rapids that seemed to put any navigation of it also out of the question
but to a point not very far distant from the back of the storehouse a creek ran up from the second river
it was only a question of a short portage therefore to get goods into flatbottomed craft for navigating the tributary and it was plain sailing or as near plain sailing as was possible in such country to tug barges right up via the rio innominata to the plateau of the scar
there were places it is true where we would have to get to work with spade and mattock to clear our passage but on this point there was nothing that could not ultimately be overcome by willing hands
the trees lining the banks of the tributary and of the innominata mostly branched over their waters an arch of dense foliage which made the voyage one of halflight through the greater part of its length
we berthed the clutha by the bungalow and store and with the aid of her new derricks began to unload the stores
in this work philip marquis of devonridge sweated like any laborer of blo untinged by blue and the three other men about town messrs
haynes fitzalan and greyson as also the two american boys lippencott and curtis took their coats off and worked with equal zest
they were willing and handy beyond my dearest hope
brooks and dane the two mechanics threw themselves into the work with the cool precision of men accustomed to handling machinery all their lives and their eyes gleamed over the fine pieces of plant they saw among the cargo
little thetford installed himself as tallyman and checked the invoices while sam smithers took his great bulk to wherever it was handiest and i imagine began to have hopes of decreasing his weight by the violence of his exercise
smithers chief job after the unloading of the clutha was the putting together of two flatbottomed barges for as indicated earlier sam had been a shipwright in his day
until that task was accomplished sam was in charge of operations and his work was excellent
we had brought two small powerboats on the deck of the clutha and these were transported to the creek behind the storehouse
it was a matter of weeks before we had the barges on the backwater and our stores or part of them loaded into them
we would have to make at least two journeys before the whole of the cargo could be got up to the caves
sam smithers was left behind in charge of the storehouse and the moored clutha and at last had acquired the job where he could just sit and think
the prospect of weeks of isolation did not daunt the stout warrant officer in the least and i knew that in the unlikely event of visitors no enquiries would get past his tremendous placidity and bovine lack of expression
sleepy sara was our last link with the outside world
our voyage to the plateau was toilsome and arduous to the point nearly of torture
there was now no question of portages as with the canoe
time and again we were held up until we could clear our passage
we might move a fallen tree that lay across the river no simple task where the tough undergrowth and silted weeds of years impeded us only to find a kilometre further on that a similar task awaited us
we carved and dug our way with saw and axe and spade
our skins and clothing were scratched and rent by thorns
insects bit us bloxlthirsty brutes that they were until our faces were swollen out of recognition
but we kept on ever with commendable cheerfulness where my crew was concerned and we tugged our barges behind us all the way
and after weeks and weeks of toil the nine ragamuffins that we had become sailed into the cavern of the plateau with iierhaps a trifle more dignity than our appearances were warrant for
building the workshop found the garrison of three in good order
the master if it cannot be said he was in good health for he never was that at least was his selfcontained and indomitable self
grumstock and higgins grinned cheerfully and took pains to tell me that they had never been so hard driven in their lives nor had they ever met anyone for whom they would sooner work than for the master
that they had been working was evident
the livingroom floor had been levelled and big windows had been hewn to the face of the north cliff
space enough had been provided for over fifty men and clean healthy barracks it made
the two seamen had become fair hunters as witness the store of dried venison provided which with bacon from wild pig had been cured under directions from the chief
the laboratory now was well set out and it only needed the instruments we had brought up and electric power to be as complete and as any in the world
the chief welcomed his new adherents in a way that bound them to him at once
the tremendous personal magnetism of the man leaped out of its frail tenement to master them even as it charmed
he explained the possibilities of the cavern to them and did not minimize the amount of work which would have to be done but notwithstanding the starkness of his doctrine of labor he fired them with the romance of the scheme
if he promised to drive them hard they welcomed the promise
that night as we rested after the labor of our voyage to the plateau steve curtis was not too weary to play his guitar and sing to us or to whistle
it was a marvellous performance which enthralled my two seamen higgins and grumstock so that they were open of mouth and eye to an astonishing degree
the lilt of negro melodies was so haunting that the morning found every man humming or whistling at his work
a good sign i thought
the chief looked in at the concert and stayed a little then went back to his work
i found him in his laboratory before going to bed
ah seton he said am glad you looked in
your crew is distinctly promising
i like that boy curtis with the guitar
he is an acquisition
and the rest seem good metal
i congratulate you and myself glad youre pleased sir
the little man thetford is it
he has skilful hands and intelligence our instrumentmaker sir
i think youll find him useful in the laboratory am sure i shall if i am any judge of men
goodnight seton
you have done well
next morning was devoted to unloading the barges
we landed the various pieces of plant as near their ultimate bases as we could the oilplant to its proper cave the machines in their shop the instruments by the laboratory
when the unloading was done the whole gang with the exception of the two mechanics
brooks and dane and thetford went off under the charge of devonridge to fetch up the remainder of the stores while my men concentrated on fixing a temporary electric supply to the laboratory
the power for running the dynamo we got from a small petrol engine and both these we bedded on the solid rock with deepset bolts and concrete
the accumulators and transformers for bringing the voltage up to the high figure required by the chief for his work we laid down in a little cave near his laboratory
this work occupied us two or three days but we finished it to the satisfaction who then took thetford into the laboratory and became deeply absorbed
the measuring up of the caves and the setting out of the plans for the machineshop the dynamos and the turbines were our next task but brooks dane and myself had much of it finished with several of the machinebeds levelled and drilled for the bolts before the barge party returned with the remainder of the first cargo
some of the plant now arrived was heavy and we were obliged to cut down large trees and float them into the cave to make sheers for lifting it
we economized effort by lifting the heavy pieces right to their beds
our most difficult task was the setting of the mains for the turbines but we managed it by constructing a strong flume of wood to divert the stream from its course a little so that we could work dryshod in its natural channel
by dint of hewing out portions of a side tunnel from the stream we secured an excellent setting for the hydraulic mains and these were conducted to where the turbines were conveniently placed at one end of the workshop floor
we were fortunate in the matter of concrete
the rock of the cavern was free from clay and had nothing in it to hinder the close and strong binding of the cement
the chief selected our quarry for us after sampling the stone from several of the minor caves
our stonebreakers were billy haynes and devonridge the latter insisting he was fully qualified for the job by being able to sing one song called stonecracker john
he sung the ditty as he did his work with such unremitting ardor that even the monosyllabic haynes was moved to profane eloquence
it was necessary that all the heavier work should be done before the company was broken up for a further voyage to civilization
we ran out of cement for example and certain of the plant had not been at new orleans when the clutha made her first trip
but months passed lefore we had the turbines in working order with the big dynamos sleeping beside them or had all the machines laid out with their motors and switches
yet when i looked along the cavern and saw the water gleaming under the blaze of powerful arcs the array of machines under their covers the waterfall harnessed to our use and the dmamos converting its power i found it strange to realize that over a year had passed since i first paddled into the cavern
much had been done in the time and the days had flashed by on swift wings all the more swift because the work had held us happily absorbed
i could say with the chief that we had done well
but we had only made a start even then
an amazing discovery i the work done by the mechanical and laboring section of the crew could be fairly commended the brain of the community had seldom slept
in the laboratory with the help of the now enthusiastic thetford the master had been working out many of our problems
in my spare time i had started to design an airship and had made working drawings for its construction
to this the chief bent very frequently his trained and fertile mind
he brooded over my drawings correcting them here adding to them there and there was not a stroke of his pencil but outlined some amazing idea
he would concentrate on his own problems which were many and varied and for relaxation he would walk out of his laboratory to make clear some difficulty of the working gang
thetford worshipped him and would slave with the tools of his trade far into the night on the models and instruments conceived by the chief
a nod from the master was sufficient to make any member of the crew call up the last ounce of energy for his service
but though the chief drove us hard it was always by his example and never by a word
and he drove himself harder than any
there were times when we would not see him for days on end when we would watch little thetford creep to his bed exhausted night after night and would know that the chief had not sought sleep in all the hours
these periods were anxious for me and for all of us for i knew with the others that the agony of the terrible burns on his tortured body robbed him of the slightest chance of rest
our dread was that his spirit would break under the strain
i remember one night when sixty hours had passed unbroken by sleep for the chief
eleven of us sat silent in the livingroom while thetford sprawled exhausted on his bed and we had not the heart even to play cards
we whispered among ourselves praying in our hearts that our leader could relax and find rest
and suddenly he stood at the entrance to our cave
his face was calm and placid and his mild blue eyes deep sunk though they were in his beautiful face were full of something like a gentle wonder
he nodded to us with the strange little gravity which was his nearest approach to a smile and he stepped into the chamber to cross to the sleeping thetford asleep he said
lucky thetford but he drives himself too hard poor fellow
a good man who was it injured his hand today he asked as he turned to us
it was greyson who had had his fingers crushed under a heavy weight but he hid the damaged hand
i knew that the reticence would not suit the chief so i nodded in direction
greyson was it said the chief
let me see greyson
yes he said as he examined the damaged fingers you have given yourself a bad crushing greyson
no bones broken however
in spite of his pluck greyson shivered a little
yes
it must be painful and pain is hard to combat the chief murmured he who could combat it so come let me dress it for you
i have a lotion he crossed to the rough cabinet where we kept our small store of drugs and so on and took out a bottle
then with infinite tenderness he dressed the hand with the five fingers left him to execute the mercy am rejoiced to tell you gentlemen he went on that i believe we can carry out our campaign without the shedding of blood without taking life
i see your work but you see nothing of mine
i must tell you that i have discovered a gas which will cause sleep for a number of hours
he went on to explain the anaesthetizing gas which was afterwards to give us of the league such power
the men livened up to the interest of it and he suddenly turned to steve curtis
you do not sing and play tonight steven he said
why do you neglect your guitar
chief steve choked in exclaiming
you havenot slept for three nights
i i didnot like donot think there is profit in watching me steven the chief reproved him gently
you must not do it
come sing
it will not disturb thetford
sing the little song about the lonely cabin
steve reached for his guitar and though he quavered over the first lines he soon found his voice ole cabin in de cawnatch
shingles all adroppin ftom de roof
look lak evehbody gone away some place wheh deys gone to stay
lovin ole mammy wheh is yu at
kindes ole mammy is yu daid an gone
why did ah leave ma home an run away from de lil ole cabin wheh ah was bawn no smoke risin from de kitchen flue no light shinin froo de do
nobody home to welcome yu but whats dat creakin on de flo lovin ole mammy an ma daddy too
is yu daid an gone from me
oh why did ah up an run away from de kindes ole mammy ah will evah see
empty an sad not even a houn do standin open done broke de latch think be oin an not stay aroun de lil ole cabin in de cawnpatch excellent steven said the chief
you excel yourself ever lay your guitar aside because you think i have not slept
i like to hear it
i am grateful indeed vhen i hear it
come seton
i have to show you something
i followed to receive a gentle wigging for allowing the boys to be disturbed about him
now my char fellow said he when the wigging was over want to show you what i have found in the gas which you sampled for me some months ago i have had many samples since
you understand how helium was discovered i take it
i nodded
then i need not explain the significance of the lines in the spectrum
no sir
i understand that roughly
very well then
i will show you the lines which are given by the gas from our cave
he had an elaborate arrangement of tubes and instruments set out on a low table and a sort of magio lantern focussed on a white screen stretched over a wall of the cave
there came a crackle from one of the tubes and an intense eery light
he touched my arm and pointed to the screen
there projected on the white surface was an elongated oblong of rainbow colors broken by brighter and darker bars
look at it well my dear seton the chief said quietly
you see before you the spectrum of a new element an element that may well upset the existing periodic table of the chemical elements
it is our gas mixed with helium
the bright yellow bar to the extreme left is the characteristic bar of helium
but this is new quite new
he touched a switch and the bright patch on the screen disappeared
he turned up the laboratory lights am now faced with the usual difficulty in a new science of using old terms loosely to fit new ideas he said
the atom as formerly understood is gone
but let me put it loosely
our new gas resembles helium absolutely in chemical nature in so far that it has no power of combining and exists free as single atoms without having the ability to form any compound whatever
since i judge its atomic weight another misnomer seton its atomic weight to be of that of hydrogen which up to now has been the lightest element known you will understand what a revolution our discovery will cause in scientific calculation
the gas reservoir he discovery by the chief of the new element which he named aitlwn led me to think that the design of the airship as set out would have to be altered but he declared that any drastic change would be unnecessary
i had designed the vessel to have its lift from helium
our leader had proposed to manufacture that gas by passing electricity at an extremely high voltage through certain of the rarer metals from the wolframtype ores i think which he was positive abounded in the volcanic pipe we called the red scar
but the finding first of the helium in the gas cave and second his discovery of the new gas aithon in greater quantity than the helium itself had laid open the possibility of an easier method of securing our lifting power
we shelved all other work for the time being but the tapping of the reservoir from which the chief believed that gas percolating into the upper cave was drawn
we could see that the gas in the cave had means of getting out above but its lower fringe varied little day by day which seemed to indicate that the escape overhead was continually being made good by fresh supplies
the gas in itself was harmless
it was only its ousting of the necessary oxygen for breathing that made working in the cave an impossibility
we therefore took steps to fan the mixture of helium and aithon from the cave and to keep a constant supply of oxygen procured by the chief from electrolysis of the cave water circulating in it
we brought up loads of concrete into the cave sacrificing for the moment the stuff intended for damming the oilreservoir cabin and we bound it thoroughly to the thickness of half a metre or more into the cave wall by steel bolts and dowels
when this concrete was set we found that we had stopped the percolation of the gas into the cave so that the fans and oxygen were no longer necessary
in the concrete wall we had bedded a capped pipe with a side stopcock to a pressure gauge and through the aperture of which the hinged cap lay back with its bolts ready we inserted our drill to the rock wall of the cave
for the drilling our power was derived from a small electric motor bolted to the floor and was led to the drill by a flexible armored tube on the bowden wire principle
of this process of drilling i had but slight knowledge as had the other members of the crew but with the theory of the business which the chief apparently had at his finger tips and with liie natural handiness of the seamen and mechanics we made shift to achieve something of a job
towards the end of our drilling the gas began to creep through past the drill and we had to cap the pipe and lay off until we could make arrangements for clearing the cave
the chief contrived to have two oxygen helmets made for his and my use in an emergency
drilling was resumed with the fans going and oxygen blowing into the cave and it soon became apparent that we were nearing the inner side of the reservoir wall
from the amount of gas now streaming into the cave the chief anticipated an enormous pressure so i had a long crowbar reeved through the ring of the cap in readiness
it was well that we did so for suddenly the drill broke through the rock toppled with a thud first up against the concrete and then was knocked back on its tripod over to the other side of the cave
the gas whistled out into the cave at enormous pressure its force as strong as a typhoon
fortunately i am a very heavy man or we might have had disaster
i was wearing the oxygen helmet as was the chief so i sprang for the cap of the inset pipe and threw my weight on the lever
slowly the cap went over though it took me all my time as the phrase is and every muscle in my body was protesting at the strain
the chief was by my side and he slipped the hinged bolt back into its flange then calmly stopped to pick up and hand me a spanner
i screwed the bolt tight and the rest was easy
there were two more bolts but they only had to be slipped through their holes and screwed home
we had the cap on and the gas was harnessed
we now had to turn our attention to one of the drillers who had been overcome
it was brooks knocked over by the thrown drill
the others had managed to scramble out of the cave
i picked him up in my arms and carried him into the clear air where the chief attended him
he quickly recovered and though he was a sick man for the better part of the day he made light of his experience sanng that not many people could boast of having been nearly drowned on dry land
when the gas was clear of the cave the master and i went back to find what pressure we had while a number of the men trooped after us
there was the faintest suspicion of a gleam in the mild eyes as he turned the handle of the stopcock to the gauge
the hand of the dial trembled violently then swung to forty atmospheres indicated where it remained steady forty atmospheres the master said quietly great reservoir
ah seton it is almost sacrilege to tap it the product of natures slow process through seons of time
designing the airship a nd now a trip to the outer world became urgent
we were short of the stores and plant made necessary by our development of the caves resources
again we had to complete the airship design in the light of the new gas
the chief made tests of a sample drawn straight from the reservoir and found it to be almost pure aithon
the specific gravity of the mixture he declared to be close on five times less than that of hydrogen so that with our design for a heliumlifted ship our margin for play was enormous
in the original design the total fixed weight worked out at about thirtyfive thousand kilogrammes with a disposable lift of under twenty thousand
the small proportion of disposable lift to total fixed weight was due to strengthening of the structure and the sacrifice of carrying capacity to that end
it was not anticipated that we should have to carry heavy armament or bombs or that sort of thing or a very numerous crew
with the advantages of the much lighter aithon i urged the master to permit a further stiffening of the structure and he agreed
we thus avoided the weaknesses which have always characterized even the best of rigid dirigibles
the length and mould of the vessel we did not alter
she was designed to two hundred metres in length over all twentythree metres in diameter with an extreme height of twentyseven
in cross section she was twelvesided and floated with one of the facets as a broad keel
this gave her a flat top and two vertical facets one on either side
we joined the angles of these horizontal and vertical facets each to the angle squarely opposite with latticed girders of duralumin so that the structure of the vessel was in fact a broad hollow girder of crossshaped section through all her length
her body was short and parallel with long rounded bows and an extended tapering stern the duodecagonal section being held throughout
the crossshaped section of the longitudinal girder permitted the running of a chamber seven metres wide from the point where her bows began to round to that where she began to taper to the stern a length of ninety metres
on the main gangway or keel level this chamber was divided off as follows from fore to aft first the room holding the control connections from the navigating cabin which was suspended below the two being joined by a ladder next two sleeping cabins side by side intended for the chief and myself behind these cabins further aft a bigger companionway ran down into the navigation room next a space leading into an alleyway which had cubicles on either side to the number of fourteen each cubicle taking two men and being provided with two low berths and two lockers next came the engine room with the power for working the gas taps and so on for raising and lowering a gondola to and from the main structure of the ship and also for creating the enormously high voltage electricity necessary for some of the marvellous instruments here also a stairway gave access to the observation top and two doors led out to the amidships power units one on either quarter behind the engine room was a diningsaloon and lounge for the crew with a stair down at its after end to the stem engines and control cabin
the galley and larder stood over this companionway
aft of the forward navigation cabin two power units port and starboard were suspended
the engines here were hp each of the horizontally opposed cylinder type with direct drive to the propellers
they weighed just over half as many kilogrammes as they had units of horsepower and they were so arranged each in its own little engine room that the attendant mechanics could easily get at them
the amidships engines thrust at the level of the main gangway thus about four metres higher than the forward engines
they were also much wider apart being about sixteen metres from crank to crank
these engines were of similar weight and horsepower to the forward units
the after controlcabin had two engines behind it thrusting on the same lines as the forward ones
the whole of this after cabin swung horizontally on a pivot engines included on a strong colmnn flanged on roller bearings the idea being to hasten the turn of the ship by the side thrust of the propellers astern
the swing of the after cabin was electrically controlled from the forward one but it was possible to work it from itself
the only thing not affected by the swing of the cabin was its binnacle which was fixed to the stationary column on which the cabin pivoted thus the lubbers mark of the gyrocompass always pointed to the real head of the ship
this old idea of steering was augmented by an ordinary rudder
for the normal climb and descent we had the usual boxfins astern but the genius of the chief found us a much greater power in this direction
i anticipate the chronology of the story by telling of this feature at the moment but it may be as well explained here as later
we liquefied the aithon at absolute zero and carried a big reserve in steel containers
owing to our immense lifting power we were able to have spring hoops for keeping our ballonets rigid each being fitted with an automatic pressure valve
by an elaborate system of pipes stopcocks and valves all electrically controlled from either navigating cabin we were able to clear these ballonets of gas or air at will
when we wanted to rise quickly we pumped the air from the forward ballonets and forced into them the aithon expanded to gas by having been sprayed into a slightly heated chamber
thus we upset the balance of the ship and had the lifting power forward helped of course by the thrust of the propellers
by turning a graduated dial in the cabin we were able gradually to fill the ballonets one after the other or empty them fore to aft or aft to forward as we chose
thus when we wanted a quick descent we emptied the forward ballonets of gas and filled them with air bringing the nose down
by reason of these improvements all made possible by the discovery of the aithon we were capable of and the structure permitted quick maneuver which would have buckled the ordinary dirigible at once
smithers toucan i was my task to set out working drawings of the improved airship
this was a matter of enormous labor for one pair of hands involving as it did a mass of drawings and tracings to various scales from mm to cm and fullsize for certain details
owing to the shortage of material which could not be remedied until the drawings of the airship were ready to pass into the hands of travers lippencott at new orleans the crew had time on its hands so i enlisted the services of dave lippencott and fitzalan who i found in addition to being capable engineers had some idea of mechanical drawing
they acted as tracers for me
they improved as they went on and the time came when the close inspection of their efforts by the chief thetford and myself could find no errors either in drawing or in figuring
while this work was in hand the remainder of the crew began to try drilling for the oil with an electrically driven rotary drill
they succeeded in striking oil at a depth of one hundred and thirtythree metres and as with the gas on the opposite side of the main cavern found an enormous pressure
it was a good quality of oil pale sherry brown in color and not at all the tarcolored viscous stuff one expected to see
it had a paraffin basis and readily ignited as it was fresh from the earth
the voyage to the outer world could no longer be postponed
the drawings of the airship were ready and we needed the piping for gas and oil and had to bring up the refinery plant
of the company only the chief thetford deyonridge and haynes which last two were promising themselves some hunting in the slack time and grumstock were to remain behind
grumstock came with us for the first part of the journey
we found sleepy sam smithers as placid and contented as ever to the great glee of higgins and grumstock who found much amusement in chaffing their old shipmate
in the months that smithers had been solitary not a single white man had he seen
he had captured and tamed a toucan and the bird was his sole companion
i had been rather anxious about smithers whether his resolution and phlegm would indeed be capable of sustaining that dreadful isolation but i honestly believe even now that the stout shipwright really enjoyed his own company
his health was excellent a remarkable thing in a man so shortnecked
he had improved the storehouse greatly inside but had carefully neglected all outward appearances
the place was desolate and overgrown to a forlornness that might have made the heart sink and even the clutha was hidden by creepers
but if smithers had allowed her to hide herself naturally he had looked after her waging bitter war on the ants which might have eaten into her timbers and keeping her engineroom a picture of tidiness
when the clutha was ready for her trip downstream grumstock offered to bear smithers company for a day or two before returning to the plateau
well jack said smithers if you likes to muck in wi nosey an me for a day or two good an well youre welcome
but we ainot no debatin sassiety im an me i can tell you that
nosey of course was the toucan
well what do ye do with yourself all the time
grumstock demanded with an irritated scratch of his head
nosey an me said smithers solemnly brort thinkin ter wot ther papers calls a fine art that bird he went on with an impressive wave of his slim pipe that birds a wonder
im an mell sit fer hours lookin at each other thinkin dye see an seen nosey that pensive asd make you say e ad brains in is beak sit there thinkin an thinkin till ye begin ter wonder wot tremenjous idea got
you can see it swellin up in is ead then suddenlike give isself a dust under ther wing
an anybody can see got that point settled all right
ah got me beat for thinkin any day o ther week say a monkeyd be more company higgins asserted
ah tom ah fer you
birds of a feather make good company smithers said pointedly monkeys got no brains an suit you splendid my mark got plenty
oh all right sam said the abashed higgins
if you fancy old solomon as much as that good an well
but a bird like thatd give me the creeps
possibly tom possibly smithers said with solemn pride bird like nosey wants some livin up to stay for a day or two grumstock announced if only for something to laugh at right
jack smithers said placidly
stay an advertise your vacant mind as much as ye like his withers quite unwrung by this peculiar extension of hospitality grumstock elected to remain and he and the stolid sam saw us drop down the river one morning early
the last glimpse we had of the pair showed sleepy sam sitting like a graven image on the steps of the wharf hands on knees gazing fixedly downstream after us while grumstock beside him was regarding his old shipmate perplexedly and was scratching his head in a state bordering on despair
further equipment reached new orleans in good shape and found travers lippencott with a cargo ready for us
this included our refining plant for the oil piping tanks for the pure spirit and in fine the last of the material apart from the airship itself
there was also a large amount of food tinned and otherwise cement grain and when we were ready to return coops of chickens and ducks
i handed him the airship drawings and fixed a date for our return to pick up the parts
we arranged between us that the parts and the materials should be invoiced to a socalled north african aerial transport company and that the manifests and bills of lading should be made out for some of the north african ports
we built up a ramified and intricate deceit not because it would have been difficult to get clearance for our cargo which was innocent enough but to hide our traces beyond recovery when the hue and cry would be raised against us perhaps years hence
at the time when the parts of the ship were ordered there was a great boom in ihe building of dirigibles in america and europe and we anticipated no trouble in 4iaving the orders filled
but to make assurance sure and o ee that every single part was bmitted to accuftte testing i asked brooks to stay 4n america until everything was collected at new orleans
brooks was a little chagrined at the prospect of banishment from the plateau but
i pointed out to him that there was nothing left in the cave but rough work or jobs that he could not tackle ntil we could have the parts of the airship brought there and he consented
he was a good man brooks who was not likely to get drunk or talk and he was thoroughly tapable of the business of seeing our orders properly carried out
he was to draw upon lippencott for money we treated him generously and in thed imagine the prospect of travelling importantly about the united states rather took hold of him for he set tabout the business with apparent pleasure
he was primed with a clearcut and circumstantial story to trot out to enquirers and we even went to the length of printing prospectuses of the company for him
this point was a trifle overdone for though the scheme outlined was of the maddest i believe he had difficulty later in keeping people from trying to invest in it
the two new orleans young men lippencott and curtis made the most of their leave from the amazonas exploration company and trotted their fellow explorers fitzalan and greyson about the city in great style to the evident edification of the latter
they roped in two other men for the company one of them a young oil engineer from texas
at last however the cargo was stowed and we set off on our return voyage
less than a fortnight brought us off manaos and there we had a slight care
off the city we were boarded by a brazilian official who insisted on inspecting our cargo
but our papers were in order and in the end though i fancy he thought us a trifle mad he thanked us warmly for helping to develop the resources of his fatherland
we sacrificed on him and his fellows a bottle or two of very sweet champagne stored aboard for just such an emergency and when we dropped them ever the side into their own boat i do not think they were in a condition to remember whether we were going upstream or down
we were shouting fond farewells to them and they protestations of undying amity to us even as our engines began to turn for the run up the river
some weeks later the chief was welcoming us and our new comrades to the plateau of the red scar
a lesson in mining he young texas engineer lin greensleeve by name fell in with the idea of the league right away and the other new comrade matthew
he insisted on the was little behind for enthusiasm
both men had fought for america in france and our tally of wounded men was unbroken by their adherence
greensleeve pronounced our drilling and capping of the well to be quite professional and waxed eloquent on the quality of our soil
he set about the erection of the fractional distilling plant and ruled out as unnecessary our idea of forming a reservoir
he superintended the piping of the oil direct to the stills laid down the tanks for the gasoline as he called it and when that was done took over the piping jof the aithon to the hangar caves and to the site of our pressure nd freezing tanks
meantime matthew who understood what might be called raw lumber had organized a party for treefelling
tall trees were felled and dressed down the river and were towed by launch intp the cave to make the stocks for erecting our airships
the putting up of the stocks when sufficient timber was collected fell to myself and the seamen of the company
i was inclined to drag that master shipwright smithers from his splendid isolation so that we might have the benefit of his professional experience but i forbore and disturbed him and nosey only once when i sailed down to thrash out a knotty problem with him
we managed however without his personal supervision to put up quite shapely scaffolding in readiness for the arrival of the airship parts
in the midst of these preoccupations lin greensleeve made a discovery which was the beginning of a series of thrills for us
in the east walls of the main cavern whence came jour waterpower and our aithon gas running up close to the edge of the redtopped pipe a series of varying tiftmels wandered seemingly the driedup courses of ancient hot springs
these bored up to the surface in several places to end sometimes in high sinter cones on the top of the plateau
the sweet air of the caverns was due in measure to the ventilation that these passages brought about for in many of them one could feel the rush of air
it occurred to the versatile mind of lin greensleeve that if he could search out a separate passage and connect it up to the furnaces of his refining plant he would be in possession of a natural flue and save himself a lot of trouble
to this end he dragged me off on a tour of investigation among those upper passages
for hours we scrambled and crawled with pocket compass and torches through tortuous ways checking directions and measuring distances
among other things we discovered a good passage up to the top of the plateau but that fact was temporarily lost sight of in the amazing find that followed
lin discovered his flue to a certain extent
the only thing that prevented it from being an excellent flue was the fact that it came to an abrupt end underground
lin however had his measurements which were all out owing to an unseen influence on his compass as will transpire and he was ready to wager that by hewing through for a certain distance he would connect up with another of the dried spring courses and so have a good draught to the outer air by one of the sinter cones
since the idea was merely a fancy of his and since the other members of the company had their own particular tasks to perform that day he determined to carry out the operation by himself but since lin was one of the most cheerfully determined devils it has ever been my fortune to meet and the most engaging companion withal i volunteered to help him
i knew nothing of mining but i thought it was not too late to learn a little
lin decided that it was useless to attack the barrier with the pick for the rock was a particularly hard limestone and as he put it the only method was by a shot or we descended therefore to the storecave for a stick of explosive or two detonators and a coil a drill and a forehammer and other weapons necessary for the attack
i now received my first lesson in mining
the little chamber was stiflingly hot for some reason but ve commenced operation undeterred
my instructions were to hold the drill while lin smote it and to turn it slightly after each stroke
how the man could deliver such blows in such a cramped position i am unable to say definitely but i take it that for the hundredth time i was in the position of the neophyte admiring that precision which belongs only to the master of any craft
we or rather lin soon had a goodly hole sunk and into this he inserted the with its detonator all prepared
he put in some sort of tamping and we retired round a corner or two to where the coil stood ready in connection
hug the wall seton lin ordered
now he dropped his weight on the plunger
from the cavern round the corners there came a dull roar and a gush of hot air came rushing down the passage
i was hugging the wall according to instructions but was almost dragged away from it
we were among particularly pungent fumes
foof foof lin spluttered
this will soon pass away when the little draught gets down to it
you wonot be poisoned seton but its derned unpleasant
we waited some considerable time but the little draught did not get down to it
funny said lin could have bet wed be through
wait a bit then lets go and see
we retired to the end of the passage above his refinery and while we waited we smoked and yarned
when greensleeve thought it would be safe we returned to the culdesac
the place was blocked by a heap of rubble which lin and i started to clear away
when we had made a way to the shattered wall lin fell to flashing the light of his torch on it
my my he exclaimed through to a dyke rock
gentlemen donot snigger
i didnot expect that
well here goes he picked up the drill and he rapped the end of it against the blackish rock
it sounded hllow and he turned a grin ton me not sold he smiled boss as the cornish say
another little shot will do the business
again we fell to drilling
we set the stick of explosive and the tamping then went back to the coil
once more that hollow roar the rush of hot air the pungent smell
but even now the expected draught was absent
lin greensleeve was puzzled and his face as we made our way back to the entrance to await the dispersing of the fumes was a comic study in chastened expression canot be far out
commander he said ruefully when he caught me smiling driven deep and it was hollow too
gentlemen donot snigger
maybe debris has fallen from the roof and blocked the passage soon have it out if it has
we returned to the scene of the explosion after another smoke
as we turned the last angle of the passage lin suddenly gripped my arm
now whats your verdict on that he demanded and pointed ahead
from the further wall there rose a strange greeny lambency silhouetting the heap of rock that was piled on the cave floor
something uncanny it was which made the hair prickle on the scalp
a strange sense of some appalling power behind the rocks gripped me hard and i was fain to turn on my heel and run
that indeed was what lin greensleeve bade me do
get back seton he whispered
get round the angle of rock
i dare not think what it is but going to see
stop lin stop
i exclaimed
there may be fumes from it get them now if there were he replied sniffing though theres an unaccountable whiff of bromine or chlorine he added with a puzzled air
get behind the rock angle seton
i am going to see
all in ignorance as i was i could neither stop him nor permit him to go forward
i could not tell if it would be wise to follow him but the scot in me dictated the waiting attitude to be ready to pull him out if he were in danger
lin crept forward on his hands and toes and came back in a rush with a lump of rock
if its what i think it is he panted either mad or drunk i donot know what saying seton rattled get out of this
i have something that may provide a clue
the chief is the man for us
we hurried for the entrance of the passage and climbed down to the main cavern floor
we ran across the bridge that now spanned the lake and rushed up to the laboratory
we were bidden to enter
lin poured out his story in a rush while the chief listened with his usual mild expression unastonished unmoved lambent greenish glow he murmured
let me see the rock
lin took it out of the coat in which he had hurriedly wrapped it
it was a blackish rock with a reddish side to it and to this reddish side there was a pinkish crystalline deposit very thin
pitchblende i think with a filling of rhodolite said the chief when he had placed it on a bench to examine it
an extraordinary combination
look my good greensleeve seton look he charged an electroscope until the two leaves were held out at right angles to the stem
he put the piece of rock under the globe and the leaves fell at once that tells its own story the chief said
your specimen greensleeve is highly radioactive and the pinkish salt that clings to the rhodolite side of it is one of the radium compounds i should say bromide with a slight barium impurity
he looked at us mildly quizzical have ceased to disbelieve in miracles seton since we found the aithon reservoir
though the glow you describe may easily be only the fluorescence caused by a minute quantity of radium acting on some substance readily so radium pure radium does not glow to the eye at least the thin deposit of radium bromide clinging to the rock specimen makes me really believe you have come upon a natural pocket of the metal itself nearing completion i is not for me sholto seton onetime commander in his royal navy and always more man of my hands than of the head to venture an explanation of that marvellous polythalamous geological freak known as the plateau of the red scar nor is it mine to fathom the processes of nature which brought the treasures culminating in the radium pocket to the casual and groping hands of the members of the league of the covenant
i am fain to rest content as was my master that the gifts were there for our seeking and to accept them with reverence in my heart
but to those who seek explanations whether it be that the work of their lives bids them ask or that they are po246 sessed of an idle if itching curiosity the slight notes of my chief have been edited and amplified by men of science and lie open to all who have the wit to understand
the task that lay to my hand there in the heart of the amazon forest was plain
i had to keep the crew cheerfully at work maintain a real though carefully veiled discipline and find ways and means for bringing the dream of the master to realization to second in my blundering fashion in a bewildered fashion sometimes the workingout of the amazing conceptions of his untiring brain
of the concrete then i have the knowledge at least to speak fairly
of the abstract and theoretical i can only set down the results i saw
and with motives personalities characters i must to lapse wittingly into scots just hirple along
it was like the master to be concerned over the possible effect of the radium rays on lin greensleeve and me
the little man who could not heal the great burns so far advanced on his own frail body made both of us strip and undergo a medicated bath and ointment preventive treatment of his own preparing
for some time no day passed hut that he would have us appear for examination
nothing i am convinced held terror for our fragile little chief as concerned himself but under his habitual repose of manner lin and i thought we read a mortal terror for us
however that may be in the end we were pronounced to be without scathe
members of the crew were strictly forbidden to enter the passage or go near the cave until we had taken steps to secure the contents of the radium cache which the chief on inspection declared to hold an astonishing quantity
we had no lead in the cavern but one of the mechanics remembered that the floor of the engineroom was covered with the metal and some men were sent down to the wharf to rip it off and bring it to the cavern
the chief designed a leaden shield
this had two ingeniously jointed arms ending in boxlike mitts which permitted the handling of a little spade by one and the holding of a thick lead case in the other
a view of the operation of case and spade was given by a periscope and light was thrown on the subject by electric bulbs attached to the top of the leaden screen
when this contrivance was ready lin greensleeve and myself cleared away the debris on the cave floor by working with spades from behind two lead shields
the debris was removed the working screen was pushed against the aperture of the cache and lin whose hands were more fitted in size for the box mitts than my great fists spooned the precious salts into the case and when the crevice was cleared the lid was dropped home
the treasure worth an enormous fortune was deposited in a little cave right in the heart of the cave system
lin greensleeve now made a survey with proper instruments and found the right spot for breaking through into the other passage
within a day or two the passage to the radium cave was impassable by reason of the fumes from furnaces
he was not cheated for when the dampers were up the roar of the draught through his furnaces rivalled the waterfall in filling every cranny of the caverns with noise
the position of affairs with the league at this time was so we had apart from the master sixteen men signatory to the covenant for peace devonridge greyson fitzalan haynes lippencott curtis greensleeve whittaker grumstock higgins dane thetford and myself thirteen at work in the cavern
outside were travers lippencott and brooks in america smithers at the storehouse downriver
we had perfected the laboratory harnessed the waterpower of the fall and provided ample electricity for all reqtiirements we had secured our oil supply and were able to refine it and store the pure spirit and lubricating oils and we had wax for our electrical instruments the gas for lifting our airships was available in great quantity and we were able to reduce it to its liquefying constant and to store it our engineshop up to date in every particular was in full working order we had the building slips ready for the erection of the dirigibles and we had the living accommodation for our full complement of fifty men all ready for occupation
the plans of the chief and his experiments were well advanced
he had standardized his formula for and was ready to manufacture the anaesthetizing gas
he assured me that he wais nearing the end of the development of the power that was to bring the world into line with the ideas of the league
in addition to this he and thetford as a relaxation for the chief had prepared numerous instruments for the navigation of our ships and had made models of many contrivances for the controls and the manipulation of our lifting gas
finally we possessed a supply of radium greater than had ever been known before in the world and worth enough money to set us all in luxury for the rest of our lives
in the matter of creature comforts we were very well off
we had vegetables growing in a clearing down the river we had fish and venison and wild pig with occasional snatches of frozen beef and mutton we had of course the best of canned foods milk meat and fruit and we had ducks and chickens thriving in a cave at the south end of our main cavern the ducks corralled by wire netting
to reach this point in our preparation had taken over two years and indeed we had celebrated two christmas feasts and two thanksgivings in the big livingcave of the plateau
we had come to the stage once more when we would have to make a journey to the outside world
by now the materials for our two airships with the necessary instruments would be waiting for us at new orleans and we were due to complete the number of our company
before setting out on our last voyages i put the whole of the men on constructing great doors for the main and smaller entrances of the caverns
these we made of trelliswork in heavy scantlings of wood overlaid with wire nets and we fixed floating boxes of soil at their bases planting quickgrowing creepers on them
we planted well past the hinges of each flap to a good distance along the cliffs on either side of our waterway
when we returned from our next voyage the entrances to our caverns were masked with luxuriant foliage
the crew complete i devonridge dane and higgins with me to england for the purpose of recruiting men
greensleeve volunteered to find some in america as did the two lippencotts and curtis
we went carefully to work on both sides of the atlantic
in england dane did the best work among us
he found us six skilled mechanics for whose characters he could vouch
i found five good seamen and airmea who had served with me previously and devonridge weighed in with two excellent sportsmen of his own type and a couple of men who had been on his estates
we each kept our own party and voyaged separately to new orleans where we found that lippencott and his helpers had recruited sixteen good men
there was not a man among the whole thirtyone who did not promise well and the experience of the next year at the plateau only found a single failure among them
our total complement excluding the master now numbered fortyseven and still our tally of men wounded in war was unbroken
i had almost made a point of that qualification to my recruiters and they seemed to have made much of it
while my party was in england lippencott had had the clutha loaded but with the number of men we had to carry and the weight of our material we found that at least two journeys would be necessary
it seemed hardly safe to leave any number of men to kick their heels in new orleans for some months so i determined to ship the lot at once
the little vessel was packed but the spirit of the men was good and they bore the cramping with cheerfulness
the voyage was made at good speed and except for having to hide the men on passing several of the river ports we arrived at the storehouse without adventure
there i gave over the command to devonridge with greensleeve and curtis as juniors and when the unloading was done i took the vessel without further delay downriver again for another trip to new orleans
here i shipped the last of our material and a good amount of stores
on my return to our base on the river i found devonridge waiting with men to unload
we carried our stuff upstream to the plateau
i outlined a plan i had conceived to the chief which was simply that after two further voyages to america for stores we should burn our boats behind us and not go back to the outer world until we could make the trip on the ark of the covemnt
the chief agreed so when the final two voyages had been made under devonridge we ran the poor trusty little clutha into a creek downstream and felled trees about her effectually concealing her where i suppose she lies bless her to this day
we shipped smithers and his toucan
nosey having about broken their hearts by razing the storehouse and bungalow to the ground and as we proceeded upstream we put charges of giant powder under tall trees behind us so that they fell across the water securely blocking any passage behind us
in a month or two the way would be nigh impassable
thus we cut ourselves off from civilization except for that which we carried with us and a full year elapsed before the world heard of us again
even in the cavern we were shut from prying eyes for the great doors were now a mass of green and when we chose we could be very troglodytes
the crew settled down to work with commendable earnestness of purpose and we had trouble with only one man
it must be remembered that our company consisted of picked men
we had some of the most skilled engineers mechanics and electricians that could have been found in britain or america and in addition we had others who made up for their lack of skill by willing spirit and remarkable adaptability
the young men from about town both british and american where they could not do work in which they had been trained took off their coats and worked like laborers
philip marquis of devonridge as an example would take his exgamekeeper one moggs off for a days hunting and would bring in enough fur and feather to keep the company feeding well for days but next day would see his lordship on some rigging work taking orders from sam smithers as cheerfully as he had given them to moggs on the day previous
moggs too would be found cooking an appetizing meal for the chief to whom he speedily became devoted with the same amiable imperturbability as he had shown in tramping through the marshland after devonridge
moggs was a treasure for he was the only man among us who dared argue with the chief as to what was the proper time to eat and sleep
in room of grumstock otherwise engaged he made himself an unofficial batman to our leader cook to the company in general and factotum at large about the caves
another mighty hunter in our midst was billy haynes
haynes had fewer words than any man among us not even excepting smithers and he never was upset never ruffled
the only time we ever saw him show the slightest symptom of being moved was when lin greensleeve decried the merits of doublebarrelled english sporting gun in comparison with one of the pump variety from america a lot of dam rot greensleeve said billy with his widest stare
talk about something you know frinstance the smelly stuff you work in and listen to you
of lin greensleeve i have written something already
he was good in the way that only an american can be
full of the humorous exaggeration beloved of his countrymen he could string as he called it the britons among tis with superb ease and he had the knack of causing laughter but when he settled down to work he tore at it and hammered at it with a driving force that was a thing for wonder
young lippencott too and steven curtis proved their value the former combining a drawled wit with a steady application to business and the latter with no less zeal in harness and his delightful gift of song always available for our amusement
into the air i he cement that bound us together was devotion to the frail little man who inspired us
he moved in our midst with a gentle aloofness which did not repel
he helped us in our difficulties out of the deep store of knowledge in his amazing brain and he tended us in sickness or injury with the extremest skill though fortunately his ability was seldom called upon on the latter account
in the hands of these willing comrades and under the direction of our brilliant leader the airships steadily grew into shape in their stocks and at last the time came when the first ark of the covenant was ready to take the air and the second only waited the performance of the first to allow completion
i think more than myself experienced a thrill of sorts when that night the chief and myself stepped into the recreation room of our company have come to tell you gentlemen said the chief that tomorrow we fill the ship with gas and tomorrow night we take the air
the cheer that went up might have been heard over the andes in ecuador it was new eve and a night of bright moonlight that paled the tropical galaxy of stars
the ark of the covenant floated down the main cavern on her own power
we had fixed taut cables crosswise over the walls and roof of the cave so that she would rub against no rock surface
for a moment she hung steady over the entrance basin then i nodded to the chief who was by my side
he gently pulled round the ascent indicator as i belled for half speed and the ship rose smoothly by the head as we gathered way
we shot up at a surprising speed and on the instant i knew of a certainty that i was in command of the finest craft that ever sailed on sea or in air
she was a living thing obedient gentle strong
we tested her thoroughly against the wind and with it and her highest speed was well over three hundred kilometres an hour balance was perfect
we closed all apertures and turned on the compressed air which was also fed to the engines and we gave her full gas
we rose at dizzying speed so that i began to have fears for our ballonets
we touched a height close on nine thousand metres and the earth was lost to us
higher we went and it was certain that no known machine could reach us
yet we found resistance enough for the propellers to cruise at a good speed
we knew that we were safe from all pursuit when we chose
we came down again and tested her for drift for her turn
she drifted little and with the help of the pivoted stern cabin she could come about almost inside her own length
the chief accepted the wonderful performance of the ship with the greatest calm for i think he never had a doubt of her capacity
what concerned him more was the working of the various instruments he had invented for pur use
first of these was the navigating globe
this was nothing less than the earth in miniature
for its control the chief had utilized not only the magnetic rays of the earth but also in some extraordinary way the pull of the earth as it revolved on its axis
the ball which was the earth in replica thus was always poised in exactly the same relation to the ship as the earth itself
the globe swung on an elaborate system of gymbals and its core was taken up by a series of magnets
the whole of this complicated piece of mechanism was enclosed in a gasfilled chamber the top of which was pierced for a lens through which the illuminated portion of the globe directly under was thrown magnified by a camera obscura on a vertical groundglass screen
the groundglass screen was crossed by two hair lines their intersection giving the position of the ship over the earth and the vertical hair her direction
to test the instrument the chief bade me fix my own course for some place recognizable making my own reckoning and he covered the groundglass with a cloth
i fixed on caracas and put the ship in that direction at full speed
on my mettle i took no chances
i calculated drift and everything that might throw us out of our course and when we arrived over the city and pulled the cloth from the indicator the crossed hairs stood clean on the dot representing the place
it was on a plain of the hills behind caracas that i was first introduced to the directive rays which controlled the cloud of anaesthetizing gas for here the chief had a glass bomb filled with the liquid gas and dropped haphazard on the plain
below us the gas widened into a luminous cloud
the chief was working with a box affair which had a sort of lens arrangement on one side and was connected to the hightension circuit
he and thetford manipulated this box through a hatch in the cabin floor
as i watched i saw the cloud take shape and move across the plain now one way now the other
we were drifting on the wind with stopped engines but the cloud was made to travel in advance of us or across our path at the will of the chief
as i watched i saw the cloud move toward a series of dots cattle of some sort on the plain
it enveloped them and whatever they were horses or steers they were all lying on their sides when it had passed
it is enough said the chief
have you killed them sir i asked
and he looked up at me very mildly
why what a question he said and from you seton
no no my friend they are only asleep
as he spoke he moved the box back and forward quickly and below the gas cloud was broken and began to disperse
that is well for one morning the chief said rising
now seton let us be back at the plateau with the dawn
in the west the moon was low down and darkness was spreading over the land
below us no light gleamed nor often did we catch the faint sheen of water save only when we sped over the orinoco itself
darkness for a space but for the light of the stars and then came that cold tinge of grey in the east
quickly faded the grey into pale topaz and chrysoprase until as we slanted down to the basin of our cave it was lost in the glory of the risen sun
our trial trip was over with abundant success
the deluge days after our initial voyage we almost lost the first ark of the as a total wreck and a little later it seemed likely that both our ships would be damaged beyond repair
the second ship still lay in her stocks waiting for any improvements that might be suggested by the performance of her sister ship
we had taken out ark of the covenant i on continued tests and we had been cruising some hours towards the early evening when without warning we were caught by a tropical storm at a considerable distance from our base
for the storm in itself we needed to care little enough it would have been possible to ride over it
but we found ourselves in the air with only sufficient petrol for the home run
we had moreover no stores aboard to permit any comfort in waiting for the storm to die down
there was nothing for it but to run
behind us the storm was rising on a following wind and it was a question of time if we could be at the cave entrance before the impact caught us
the ship behaved admirably rolling little keeping her balance and speeding like a thrown javelin for home
we dropped into the entrance basin under a sky black as ink
over us the rising wind was moaning precursor of swift hurricane
if we could not get the ship into the cave the chances were that she would first be battered against the cliffs then lifted and thrown perhaps into the south atlantic
every single man jack ashore was on the guy ropes and numbers of the crew had dropped hardily into the water to help but the ship swung stubbornly towards the threatening angle of the entrance
they had not the weight to pull her round and the edge of the hurricane was tearing down on us
from the cabin of the ship i was trying to direct the operations of the men both aboard and ashore but the noise of the wind made hearing difficult
it came to me that if we did not act quickly time for action would be past so i sprang for the deflation gear and spun round the handle
in a second or two there was scarcely a foot of gas in the whole ship and we sank into the basin
now i shoved over the controls to half speed
deprived of her buoyancy the ship was easier to handle and as the men resisted the drive of the wind we forged ahead into the cavern our propellers lashing the water and our cabin awash
it was in the nick of time for even as her rudder passed the jambs of the entrance the crest of the hurricane caught the ship and threw her stern against the fender ropes
but we were inside at the cost of strained rudder stays and one propellerblade broken
the great doors were closed against the storm which was now upon us with clamorous fury
to restore a measure of buoyancy to the ship enough at least to take her out of the water was only a question of turning on our reserve gas
and in a little ark of the covenant i was snugly secured by her mooring stays in her own hangar cave
all this time the chief had not moved from his position
he had been clinging by his single hand to a rail and i turned to him with an apology for sousing him and his wonderful instruments
but the only reply i received was one of his extremely rare handshakes and i knew then that i had somehow pleased him
we went together to the living quarters and when we had changed i joined him in his laboratory to watch the storm
fortunately the windows of the laboratory and of the livingrooms were sheltered from the force of the wind and we caught nothing but the eddies
outside the land lay in half light but it was possible to see that the trees and shrubs near us were bent low and laid flat by the terrific drive of the hurricane
sometimes a great tree would give the earth below it would part and the roots would come up majestically into the air with a cloud of broken soil
at times one of these uprooted trees would be lifted bodily and carried through the air like a feather
bushes were flung high and the air was filled with debris whizzing along at lightning speed
i thought of the lines from the deluge of to hear frae the pitmirk on hie
the brangled collieshangie flee
the warld yed thocht twixt land an itsel had coupit and for auld aim the smashed debris by god was roupitl then came the rain a grey streaking curtain of it thickening in texture till it was almost a solid mass of water obscuring the view its base a teeming mist of shattered drops
thicker and more dense it grew till the roar of it drowned the voice of the wind
suddenly the fall of the water it could not be called rain thinned and a terrible spectacle came before our eyes
the water thinned gathering to a dense core and wreathed into a whirling spiral which spun up and up until it widened into an inverted cone of leaden cloud behind which the lightning played in livid sheets and splashes
and the dense column of water moved over the cup north of our plateau solemnly majestically roaring the tune of its march as it went with undertones of the crashing thunder
its trail was a wide path of smashed and riven trees and flattened shrub
over the cup of land the column moved leaving a sheet of desolate water until it passed to the spur of hills of which the plateau was the point and was lost to our sight
its voice now was muted to a distant murmur fretted by jagged mutterings of faroff thunder
the drab greenish mauve of the sky lightened to a generous amber
of our relief that we had found haven before such an awful visitation let a second silent handshake between the master and me bear witness
yet our worst danger was still to come and we were to find that we had congratulated each other too soon
the river of the northward cup was lost in a wide sheet of water and it was apparent that the outlet gorge was too small for quick drainage
we saw that the water of our entrance basin was rising steadily and quickly which meant that the level of the waterway within the cavern would be rising also
this we found to be the case but towards nightfall the rise seemed to have found its maximum
we were cheated into a false sense of security
the note of our cavern waterfall gave us first warning of the danger
in the years of our sojourn under the plateau of the scar the voice of the fall had ever been a friendly whisper to us
we lived with its solacing murmur always in our ears and i think we missed it when absent from the cave
but in the middle of the night after the hurricane we became acutely conscious that its note was changing growing louder gaining a suggestion of menace
desperate work he noise swelled into a threatening roar and as i got up from my bed to dress the whole cavern was filled with a hoot and rumble which vibrated enough to shake the teeth from ones head like pips from a squeezed orange
it was plain now why the indians avoided the plateau of the scar
the noise was terrifying
already most of the men were astir for the uproar made sleep impossible and when i got out of the dormitory into the main cavern and pushed home the inain switch the arcs lit up a sight that spelled immediate danger
the column of water from the fall was coming down its passage at such force and volume that it was describing an arc above its normal ledge shooting clean past the turbine barrier right to the center of the cavern lake
the level of the water in the cavern was creeping up at an alarming speed and already the machineshop was flooded the oilcave awash and most of our working floors were under water
i mustered all hands and we tumbled into launches and barges or indeed into anything that would float
our first concern was to throw open the big gates of the cave entrances lest they should impede the egress of the water but this gave little relief
to save our ships from being crushed against the roofs of their caves was our next thought
we found the first ship so deeply awash that she was straining at her mooring stays
we slackened these so that she rose until her top was almost scraping the ceiling but the water mounted so quickly that we found this expedient useless
i would have taken her clean out of the cavern but the height of the entrance was perhaps the lowest point of all in the great chamber and wdth the high level of the risen water that way of escape was barred
all we could do and a despairing measure it seemed was to unmoor her and maneuver her to that point in the cave system where the ceiling was highest
i shall not dwell on the strenuousness of our labors but it may be imagined
we were all soaked to the skin and i was almost afraid to take tally of the men in case some of them should be missing for every now and then we had had to pause to rescue one or other who had wandered into deep water
i was afraid some poor chap had done so unnoticed
we brought the first ship as i have said to the point where the cave was the highest and here we moored her as best we could
the danger for number two was now imminent
she was complete except for her engines and as yet she was not buoyed with gas
when we went to look after her we found her as her sister had been half immersed in water with her stays holding her down
the stays were cleated under water and several of the men were about drowned in unhitching them
we succeeded in freeing her only to be faced by another peril
the roof of her cave came down in the middle to a sharp ridge and if she rose higher the danger was that her back would be broken or at least buckled beyond repair for we had no rolling mills to straighten her girders
it was out of the question again to pull her out to a higher portion of the main cave since the neck of her hangar was its lowest point
it was lin greensleeve who saved her
lin took a party of men with picks up to her observation top and on her upper deck he set them to hewing down the sawlike ridge which was nothing else than a series of stalactites of varying depths depending from the line of some transverse crack in the ceiling
they hewed off as much as was humanly possible and just when lin as a last desperate resource was for putting in one or two of his favorite shots the water suddenly stopped rising
we stood by them and examined the state of affairs
we found that number one still had a couple of metres to spare for clearance and that the two though her fabric was sadly knocked about by the fall of rock from the ceiling was structurally intact
but the rise of the water for another half a metre would buckle her past redemption
lin still was eager to try a small shot or two at the stubborn points of the ridge but as the water seemed to have found its level and had not risen for about forty minutes the chief and i decided to risk the chance
we mustered our men and found all present
they were sadly drenched and dishevelled but cheery in spite of chattering teeth and tired limbs
the excellent moggs had begun to cook early breakfast at the shout of and by the time we trooped into the livingrooms he had gallons of hot coffee and mountains of appetizing food prepared
we were spared further anxiety for the water remained at its last level for several hours though the waterfall still roared and threw its column into the middle of the lake
when the sun had been up several hours the chief and i took a launch and began to investigate the rise of the water and its ultimate holding of a maximum level
to take the sudden rise first though it was the second point of our investigation this was due to two things
the waterfall was supplied from that lake on the higher step above the plateau
normally the lake was filled from underground springs and at its usual level fed our waterfall through a submerged outlet
but with the sudden rise of the lake level owing to the torrential rain and the cloudburst its waters began to pour over its lip into a crack which led to a second passage running underground to join up with the normal conduit to the fall
second the lake waters found another outlet over the side of the hill and into a course usually dry which brought them into the cup of land north of the lower step of the plateau
this with other streams pouring into the cup brought the water speedily up to a high level for the little canon of our stream to the innominata was not capable of letting the abnormal influx escape at any speed
thus the waters of the cup and of our underground lake had only two means of egress through the gorge and through the smaller entrance to our cavern
when the waters reached a certain height however they found two extra outlets
one we discovered was in the cave itself a minor cave on the west side which at its extreme end shelved down to a deep subterranean chasm
the second was a break in the lip of the north cup over which the waters poured into the marshland beyond
we now had learned our lesson and would know what to do in the event of another storm in the future
when the waters subsided as they did in the course of the day we put number one back in her hangar and brought the two into the middle of the main cave
lin greensleeve had put a few of his small shots into the ridge of the ceiling and with long leads he exploded them to his and our entire satisfaction
one point remains
our fowls and ducks who had the highest cave in the lower series escaped with nothing worse than a bad fright
we found them huddled at the extreme end of their habitation and moggs declared the muster complete with the exception of one duck probably more adventurous than his fellows who it was surmised had been swept away by the torrent out of the smaller entrance the first raid had repaired the damage caused by wind and water to the ark of the covetiant and that inflicted on number two by her sousing and the fall of rock upon her
into number one we had installed the last of the instruments invented by the master for the demonstration of his discoveries
none but he and thetford were permitted to toucli certain of these instruments for they embodied a devastating power
two machines alone so far were to be handled by members of the crew that controlling the anaesthetizing gas and another designed to ward off airplane attacks
the night before our first essay the master joined us in the common room and shared our meal
he spoke to us earnestly of the high emprise on which we were about to embark
never have i seen our frail leader so impressive nor ever did his tremendous personality so shine from him
he spoke as was his wont in a clear calm voice unemotional with no attempt at drama
he was always the reverse of dramatic consciously and by the very negation made himself the nub of drama the most poignant and telling
he simply asked the men to be faithful to use the power he might have to put in their hands with care for human life and never to let themselves stray for a single moment from the strictest sense of duty
finally he asked them to trust themselves and him trust you
chief all right some of them said sure you will gentlemen said the master
you have shown me that i can trust you implicitly
you have done well and faithfully in the first phase of your work
no men could have done better
see to it that you finish your course with equal faith equal good service
if we serve our cause and each other with wholehearted zeal we cannot fail men were aboard ark of the covenant when we set out in the middle day for the city of new york
we climbed high out of sight practically and with the heaters and compressed air at work made our way in direct line for our destination
our journey was uneventful and only the steady creep of the map on the navigating globe marked our progress
with the dark we dropped to fifteen hundred metres and breathed fresh air
we were over new jersey after midnight
we lowered our gondola with its crew to a low height and from there we dropped our gasbombs on a petrol station
the airship then came down until she was almost nestling on the tops of the sheds
from the airship we let down tubing and working in gasmasks we robbed the tank of its spirit
the whole operation took less than half an hour
thence we proceeded to the business quarter
we dropped bombs at the ends of a long thoroughfare and one in the centre
again the ship was brought close to the earth this time so that she lay along the street
the gondola rested on the car lines
to break into the food stores was an easy task requiring no more than a stout jimmy and our men began to hand out the stores as devonridge and i selected them
this occupied an hour and we came away after leaving money roughly calculated to pay for the goods
it was now close on three
we mounted high and crossed the river until we lay over wall street the gondola was lowered from a great height and telephone communication from it gave us our direction
we strewed bombs all about the district twelve altogether so that the gas clouds wreathed the streets visibly to us though invisible to anyone on the ground
we then came down as indeed the finn klenski saw close to the roof of the national metallurgical
two parties of seven men each squad with a flamecutter of the invention attacked the banks
each party also had a stout little trundle cart rubbertired to collect the gold
one group tackled the national metallurgical and the guaranty while the other attended to the dyers and the trade
the first party had finished loading the gold from its two banks into the gondola and had begun operations on the subtreasury before the other party had completed its work on the dyers and the trade
when the second haul of gold and securities had been stowed the parties combined forces on the treasury
we appeared to waste no time but owing i suppose to inexperience an hour and twenty minutes had passed before our last haul was aboard the ship
meantime according to prearranged plans envelopes addressed in disguised hands were ready for the securities and the little lead boxes of radium all prepared
it was my task to drop these into the box at the post office
i walked out of the gassed area by back streets and was fortunate enough to escape observation for when i came round by the park above the post office i saw a thickish crowd further down broadway apparently trying to find out what was happening at the lower end
street cars stood one behind the other in a procession for the chief had thrown a ray over the area to upset all electric circuits to avoid accidents from the traffic
the vicinity of the post office however was bare of people and i dropped my packages into the box unnotic
i returned by the same roundabout route only stopping to put my gasmask on when i knew i was approaching the danger area
the only person i saw previous to that was a policeman who was innocently rapping and trying doors
my heart went a little faster as i passed him but my garb was not unlike that of an officer of the american air police and he saluted me wishing me goodnight
he could not have known that just round the corner of the street was a stopped motortruck over the dashboard of which two men sprawled unconscious
altogether it was a scary business and i determined in my own mind that on the next raid there would be no going out of the affected area
it was too risky for i could not imagine what i should have done if the police had completely surrounded the district
i entered the gondola and was pulled up with the rest of the gang as i might dub our league and within two hours of our arrival above wall street i was steering the ship high above new york as she made out to sea
all next day we lay poised over the atlantic at a great height and we slept in watches
towards night we began tq cruise about for we had picked up papers from the banks which gave us information of the parnassic
we saw the oiltanker westbury early and marked her course for further use
we saw the parnassic long before we attacked her
indeed we followed her easily for an hour before we shot ahead to lower the red riding lamp which stopped her
we had dropped our gas in readiness in her path and when she hove to we manceuvred it about her
we then swooped down alongside and laid the gondola close by
our piracy occupied forty minutes
it was pitiful to see the ship so helpless and the sight affected the mariners among us very strangely but there was no ice in the sea near by or the chief certainly would have taken measures to restore some of the ships company to consciousness before leaving
we now sped after the westbury
the only thing remarkable about this raid was the extraordinary truculence by wireless phone of her yankee skipper
he seemed to bear little love for the navy of his country and one would have thought that a warning to heave to was the biggest insult he had ever had in his life
but that rasping voice was soon stilled by our gas and we had little difficulty in helping ourselves to the skippers excellent aviation spirit
these raids accomplished we circled wide out to the atlantic and were snugged down in the cavern by early the next day
further success he news we had of the effect of our raids was meagre for we picked up very little through our wireless but that we had created a deep impression we felt sure
a fortnight after the new york raid we descended on louisville and there besides making off with gold and foodstuffs and petrol we robbed the newspaper files in one of the banks a point that has escaped notice
from these journals we gained an idea of the turmoil and consternation our raids had caused
among other things we noticed was the fact that the business chaos we intended to bring about by taking the securities had been lessened by their speedy return to the proper quarters and since the idea was to disturb business as much as possible as a preliminary to our further plans we decided that there should he no such mistake made in future raids
it was only because this point had not yet occurred to us that we held to our first procedure in dealing with the louisville bonds
we had not of course then read the newspapers
the gold which we ld collected up to this time we melted and recast into ingots of our own design
the gold was of no value to us in view of certain powers within the hand of our leader
our next raids were to test the staying powers of the irk of the covenant to the full
we knew from chance messages picked up that the air police of america were active in their lookout but of the disposition in england and europe we knew nothing
the long flight to london was made without mishap and here in the banl of england and elsewhere we created as much trouble for business quarters as we could
to drop bombs all about the houses of parliament and nestle on the terrace was the easiest thing we have ever done for the district round about was little frequented at the moment
we did not even have to take any precautions against trafiic running amuck
this raid was a demonstration of power pure and simple and our leaving of the radium beside the mace was definitely done so that it should be quite realized that it was we who had put the commons to sleep
my helper in this exploit was lord devonridge and as he had been told of the idea beforehand he was prepared
it was he who blackened the faces of the members of the front bench in revenge he said for the heavy taxation of his class which had driven him from the country and as a reprisal for the docking of the privileges of the lords
when i turned to find him thus busy with his prepared cork my first feeling was one of surprised annoyance but there was something so ludicrously unexpected in the businesslike sangfroid with which he set about the task that continued anger was impossible
i imagine to be candid that the absurd spectacle afforded me in one particularly offensive politician from whose obtuseness i had frequently suffered while in the air service had a great deal to do with my complacence over the scheme
to see the pompous fathead with his face blackened was complete solace for all the irritation i had experienced formerly through his fatuous ignorance
the chief however took another view
he considered that our mission had been degraded and he gave devonridge a wigging which while it held no trace of anger did not lack in point
but even the chief was not proof against the gay insouciant humor of devonridge and in the end i think he forgave the culprit fully
at any rate the joy of the english members of the crew was worth any little lowering of tone we suffered by the exploit
the raid on the house of commons occupied little more time than it takes to write of it and after operations on the army and navy stores we dropped down the river to purfleet where we replenished our depleted store of petrol
once again we took to the highest we could compass and we drifted slowly west to be in readiness for our descent on berlin
the berlin raid was accomplished without mishap but it was at paris that we were made fully aware of the preparations against us
we were comfortably settled on the top of the buildings in rue bailliff and the burglary party was inside the banque when we heard the drone of airplanes
fortunately thetford was on the ships observation top in readiness for such an emergency and in spite of the machinegun fire the little fellow pluckily manipulated the ray for upsetting the electric circuits of the plane engines
he came out of the scrap without scathe and had the satisfaction of seeing both his opponents go down out of control
we hastened the depositing of the gold which was designed for creating further confusion in the minds of those after us and left our usual quantity of radium before speedily taking to the air again
from paris at a great height we bore due south until we were over the pyrenees where we swung souwesterly in arched line for the plateau
it was now apparent to us that we had put a very effective spoke in the wheel of the worlds business and had stirred europe and america into a state of apprehension and mystified anger
it was plain too that drastic measures would be taken to run us to earth now that it was definitely known the raids were accomplished by airship
we determined to demonstrate our powers by daylight and give those who chased us every chance to meet us if they could
our raids on europe took place on a weekend in april and our next raid which was by daylight on shipping along the south african route from england took place on the first sunday in may we knew from the wireless messages which we picked up that many airplanes were after us and later when we had skipped back to the plateau messages emanating from one particular plane the merlin showed that we were being pursued by the fastest air machine ever known
we took the trouble of recording the messages from this merlin and we began to note that not only could she get about from place to place in incredible time but she seemed capable of extremely prolonged flights
the following weekend found us raiding shipping on the north atlantic while the merlin we knew was scouring the canaries
news of our north atlantic raids which we took the trouble to relay by wireless ourselves brought the merlin to the azores but by the time our most assiduous pursuer was sweeping the atlantic for us we were flying out of sight above him on our way home
we now rested for another week and in the late evening of the middle saturday of may set out for further raids on the african shipping
we reached madeira in the early hours of sunday morning and found a temporary mooring place on the paul da serra that barren piece of desolation to the west of the island
there we lay snug until the first peep of day when we unhitched to fly northwards to intercept a unioncastle liner
this time we were unaware that the ubiquitous merlin was close behind us
a little spying had dropped our gas cloud and had swept the ship with it
we had grappled our gondola to her side
it was a raid of terror merely but we broke into the strongroom as a matter of course
we found little not enough to justify abstraction but we were helping ourselves to the ships stores of food when the message came from aloft ware planes to recall the crew was a matter of seconds and we had the gondola into the ship and had cast off before the silver plane dived at us
eastwards now we saw the approach of the british planecarrying enuser
there was something divinely beautiful in the swift brave swoop of that lovely silver shape
she came down at dizzying speed so that it was useless to try our ray upon her for she had the force of gravity to bring her
but we opened the gasjets about the ship making a cloud of anaesthetic envelop us
it seemed with the steady rise of the ship that the plane was bound to miss us but we were sadly mistaken
the pilot knew his business
before we realized what had happened he had flattened in a fashion which would have shattered the average plane into her component parts and we were openly fired upon with accurate bursts of shellfire both fore and aft of the plane as she whizzed under us
the ark of the covenant staggered a little but answered readily when we gave her more gas
she rose steadily and now our foes had to climb
we saw that the merlin for so we supposed our attacker to be from her speed and her fine design was somehow immune from our gas cloud
she swung after us into the cloud but got a burst of shellfire none the less
she found she could not take us at her present angle and she spun quickly about
her pilot was one in a hundred for knack fire from her quarter and another burst of shells from astern
we could not afford to experiment any further and we put our ray on her
she slid back on her tail immediately only to flip over into a wellcontrolled and peculiar hovering descent
to make sure of her we swept a gas cloud about her as she lay on the sea
by this time we had to turn our attention to the cruiser which was coming up on our position in great style
we saw a plane catapulted after us and presently the cruiser opened fire with her heavy antiaircraft guns
then came a second plane
the remainder of the encounter was as has been previously described down to the messages which passed between us and the brilliant
we could have cleared beyond range at any time after dealing with the merlin and our only reason for prolonging the business was to see that the pilots were picked up
we did not want any of them to be drowned after an extremely plucky fight
it was for this reason that we swept the gas from about the merlin and told her her engines were all right
when we saw that all was well we gave the airship her full lift of gas and made eastwards out of sight where we turned south for a space before swinging westwards and home to examine our hurts
the damage done to us by the guns was not important and we considered it valued at the measure we had taken of the planes capacity against us
she had raked the dining quarters of the crew wrecking them almost and had pierced several of our ballonets but had missed everything vital
there were no casualties to speak of save that billy haynes took a machinegun bullet in the leg a mere graze which did not even make him limp
but unimportant though the damage to ark of the covenant i was it was enough to put her out of action for a space and necessitate the commissioning of her sister ship
the ark was fully equipped and had been tried
she was in a state of complete preparation to take to the air
the swiftness of our flight which was far beyond the speed of any known dirigible and the fact that we had two ships did much to create the impression among our pursuers that we had a number of bases
we hastened to complete that impression sixty hours after our encounter with the merlin by a descent on the other side of the atlantic
here we raided several ships in the caribbean early on the following wednesday morning
we knew from messages that our most avid hunter still was looking for us off the coast of africa
early next morning travers lippencott in an automobile picked me up in the country outside new orleans
he had been informed of our needs by a mysterious and incomprehensible wireless message from us kindly exhibited as a great find by all the newspapers
i was conveyed into new orleans and after a long consultation with lippencott on the situation i went to new york first then to washington
our purpose in this action was not so much to spy out what preparations were being made for our reception in the event of further land raids though i leajrned a good deal about this incidentally as to discover how ripe the time was for further developments of our ideas
it was easy to see that jople were in a state of nervous tension no town knowing when the mysterious enemy would come down upon it
our robberies in europe and america had induced panic in banking circles and a wave of deepest depression was sweeping over business
for myself i was almost appalled by the chaos that reigned in the markets for i well knew the regular prices of the best american securities and these were selling at ridiculous figures
so far it was plain our plans had succeeded beyond our wildest hopes and the time was ripening for the enlargement of our campaign
the rumors of war which had been rife in the early part of the year had faded away the nations were too busy suspecting each other of being behind the raids
the position of a spy is never agreeable and i cannot say that i enjoyed meeting old friends who insisted that as a known airman i should take a hand in the pursuit of the raiders
it was not pleasant again to hear men bewailing the condition of affairs in businesses they had built up by the honest work of years
i felt as if i had stabbed them in tho back and each new grip of the hand from friends who were suffering only deepened a conviction in me of villainy
it would hardly bome me to examine my feelings further since i carried on with my task
fortunately for my investigations i was well known in america and to reach the president himself was a matter of no great difficulty
the presence in washington of lord almeric pluscarden made things easier because i had often stayed with him and his niece kirsteen torrance at their country house in kent
my relationship to lord almeric had been one mainly of business but he was good enough to desire my friendship as well and he and miss torrance and i had become close friends in the few years i had known them
it was something of a shock then to find miss torrance and lord almeric in a degree slightly less emphatic so deeply set on the discovery and defeat of the league of which i was rather an important member
i found myself in a position of secret personal antagonism to friends for whom i cared a good deal
it was ever on the tip of my tongue to start defending my motives for acts which they condemned without knowing me for the perpetrator
i should have escaped earlier from except that i had a lively curiosity to see this jimmy boon of whom both kirsteen and her uncles talked with such warmth and i think i saw affection
the name was familiar to me as one of a man who had done some remarkable things in the development of aviation and indeed i saw his name every time i examined the exhausts of our airship engines for it was his double silencer which permitted the stealthy approach for which we were so notorious
that james boon piloted the merlin which had put up such a good fight against our airship was an additional factor in keeping me fixed to my uncomfortable position in i was hoping that the merlin would return when it was found that haunting the coast off mogador was without profit
but for that i should have gone to new orleans and waited there for the time when the ark of the covenant was to pick me up again on a date already fixed
the merlin arrived on the last day of may and i met our principal antagonists at the white house as has been told
then i learned much which interested me and would interest the chief
there was no doubt that boon and his scientific friend lament though i must not forget the redoubtable milliken were a remarkable combination
it was not at all unlikely that in the long run we should meet again and it was quite probable that their tenacity would bring them into close range of the hidingplace of the league
a wish come true washington on friday following my first meeting with boon and his friends and my hint that they should ask the raiders why they raided was dropped by intention
the ark of the covenant picked me up on the saturday night and on the sunday night we were out over the sea due east of washington waiting for some vessel through which we could answer the wireless message to the president
that we fixed on the pershing was the merest accident
she was the handiest for our purpose that was all
we found the boarding of the battleship decidedly difficult for the reason that she still steamed after we had brought the gas about her the members of her crew on the upper works became unconscious but the gas apparently did not percolate into the engineroom
we had to keep pace with her and carefully let the gondola light on her afterdeck
taking small bombs of the gas with us we went forward and got down to the engineroom where we slung our missiles
then one of our engineers brought the ship to and some of the seamen released her anchor tackle
we left the message in the wireless cabin and immediately set off for washington
we were over the capital when the message was relayed there and we picked it up while we were hovering high above the city
that was the moment we were waiting for
a little time was allowed for the delivery of the message to the president before we swooped down on the white house bombing as we came
a few minutes later the gas having been carefully drawn away from the mansion the master and i walked into the room where the president lay unconscious with boon lamont and miss torrance with him
the little chief looked very stern and grave as he gazed on the scene and it was he who put the cushion under the head and covered him
he left the note in answer on the table
find something to cover the girl seton he said
she is thinly clad flying coat will do for miss torrance sir i said and with a very queer feeling although i knew she was unharmed i put the coat about her
i turned to find the master looking at me strangely
who did you say the girl was he asked
miss torrance sir
the niece
then she must be related to that david torrance who was something of a physicist twentyodd years ago his daughter sir knew david torrance well and his wife the chief said slowly did not know they had a daughter he walked over to the sleeping girl and said with a little pitying gesture of his one hand poor child she can never have known her father he turned his mild gaze on me and it held nothing of the slight emotion or pity that had seemed to lie in his voice
come seton he said quietly
this night you and i have lit such a candle pray that benjamin whitcomb has courage worthy his great responsibility we went out by the window closing it behind us
for the next week we did not move from the plateau except twice by night to pick up wireless messages
the effect of our answer to the president was difficult to gauge from what we picked up but certainly our method of making the reply was bandied about in wonderment from coast to coast
that there was no likelihood of an armistice being declared we knew from the speedy pursuit of us by boon and company who were patrolling within for the merlin two hours flight from our lair
whether they had come upon such a hot scent of us by accident or not we did not know for certainly we had done everything that varying speed of flight and varying direction could compass to confuse pursuit
the point that interested the chief about the crew of the merlin was the presence of lamont who he declared on the evidence of several of papers on physics had one of the keenest brains in america should like to meet mr lamont the master said to me in his gentle way almost wish we had kidnapped him at washington my dear seton
and if mr boon shows signs of coming any closer to our hidingplace i may begin to regret we did not capture him also
lamont in one of his papers made a surprising mistake for him in an otherwise interesting speculation on the variation of electrons
i think i might make his error clear to him
we may have boon and him down on us at any minute sir i laughed
we might kidnap them then
within a fortnight my jesting suggestion came to earnest reality
a severe storm broke over us on the following week and it lasted off and on for six days with extraordinary electrical disturbances in the atmosphere
we slacked then until on the saturday night in the third week of june we began a series of raids on shipping on both sides of panama
on the sunday morning we knew that boon was hot after us he was always terribly frank with his wireless messages but we went out again on the sunday evening and stopped a ship between the galapagos and the mainland
we were returning over guayaquil and flying quite low when we saw the merlin lying in the roadstead of the harbor a tiny little shape of dull silver against the blue of the water
i am certain that we saw her before her crew saw us and as soon as i caught sight of her i altered our course to a good number of points southerly but i did not alter speed until the harbor had disappeared behind the mountains
when that happened i altered the course to its real direction and put more power into the engines of the ship than she had ever had before
she leapt to it as no airmachine ever sped save the merlin herself
we did not make for height the time for that was not yet
we simply sped as though the devil himself was at our tail
a sharp lookout was kept astern from every possible point of sight but it soon became evident that the merlin either could not take the air or had failed to see us
i thought the latter reason for her nonpursuit most unlikely and had two ideas in my head
if the merlin came into view before we could get to our cavern i intended to overshoot the mark climb high and send her down by means of the rays
clever as the plane was she could not get above us and under us she was completely at our mercy without the slightest chance of retaliation
but i did not want to send her down in a place where her crew would be unable to escape
by sheer good luck we were able to be snug in the cavern with the great doors shut before we saw the merlin come winging up in a wide circle from the southeast a fact that made us realize again her magnificent turn of speed since she had been able to follow the false trail and make loops in search
i had taken a party of men armed with winchesters to the top of the plateau to watch for with the basin and the amount of water around us there was distinct temptation for a seaplane to alight
like some graceful great bird the plane swooped down on the plateau and hidden among the trees we saw her zoom over the edge of the bluff east of the red scar
i stationed my men among the shrubs west of the scar in case boon would take it into his head to come down on the upper lake and begin to investigate
and so it fell out
we waited a considerable time then we saw lamont and boon descend the bluff
we were ready for any eventuality
they came out of the bush and approached the red scar which seemed to interest them greatly especially lamont
they then worked round it to the north and disappeared among the shrubs and trees in the direction of the cliffs over the basin
i sent several men to cut off their retreat to the merlin
but the visitors did not immediately go back to their plane
they bore down the west side of the outcrop towards the sinter cones and it was behind these that i had my men disposed close to the descending passage to the caves
when they had fully assured themselves that their suspicions were wellfounded we held them up
they were blindfolded and led down the underground passage while i took my men up to the lake to see what could be done for the remaining visitor to he concluded have prevailed upon a number of our oustanding authors to write for some new science fiction stories
these stories are now available through our new library entitled science fiction series six books have been prepared with the following titles by david keller by jack williamson and miles breuer by michelmore by lilith lorraine by leslie stone by morrison colladay these books are available at the small price of 10c each
for further information turn to page yek brought his toes together completing the electric circuit and a tiny vortex ring of gas shot out
in a moment the arrogant female bully crumpled to the floor like a deflated toy balloon did you think of the crime that was committed by the purple women last night yek put this question to his wife kaza as together with their son ralus they sat eating breakfast in their mountain home just north of burbank california
they certainly are getting more daring and more ruthless every day kaza replied
according to the account i received through the hypnoscope while i slept last night they vibrated over a score of men and women with no apparent reason
the newsitor compared them to weasels that slay not out of necessity but merely for the joy of killing
it certainly is frightful the way crime is getting the upper hand nowadays suppose thats the penalty we have to pay for recent developments in science and invention yek rejoined
but one would expect that as mankind develops in knowledge crime would be wiped out or at least diminished materially instead of increasing at such a terrible rate as it has during the last few years reasonable enough to expect an improvement in moral development to accompany scientific advancement but history shows the opposite to be true
my father told me that in the early days when his grandfather was judge fully fifty per cent of the crimes that came to his attention could be traced to automobiles which at that time were being widely used by criminals
at this ralus ever on the alert for words he did not understand piped up with daddy whats an automobile
surely you must know what an automobile was his father came back at him you studied about automobiles in your history yet
not yet
you mustnot forget daddy that been going to school for only three years and i just started in high school a month ago well then i suppose have to tell you
the term automobile was applied to a very primitive kind of conveyance which was used seventy years ago
it was a cumbersome device with four wheels and an excessively heavy motor
it burned a liquid called gasoline and crawled along the ground at the snaillike pace of from twenty to fifty miles an hour
there were a few specially made automobiles that succeeded in attaining a speed of about two hundred miles an hour but they were too costly and too unsafe to be practical
but daddy i thought you told me once that when you were a boy you used to travel in airplanes correct
the automobile passed out long before my time is a story by the wellknown sciencefiction author that we can warmly recommend to your attention
the author certainly opens up an entirely new vista before our eyes yet he is careful never to exaggerate scientific and particularly aviation possibilities
while a few of the instrumentalities which he describes may never become applied commercially yet there is nothing wrong with them scientifically
we are certain that all of the things of which the author speaks so convinceingly could some time in the future be used just as he pictures them to us
we are certain that the story will arouse yotrr enthusiasm
and i believe i also told you that the airplane was an extremely crude contraption
it was so limited in its scope that it was practically worthless without the automobile to supplement it
all my knowledge of the automobile is from my father
you see the airplane was considerably heavier than air and it had no gravinul to diminish or eliminate the attraction of gravitation
it couldnot rise abruptly from the ground as our spacemobiles do
the only way it could get into the air was by making a long run along the surface
it also needed lots of room in landing since it could not be brought to a stop instantly
all these things made it necessary for the airplane to depend on enormous specially constructed fields called airports
some of them were more than a mile long
naturally it was impossible to provide such huge open fields in the congested sections of a metropolis and the airports were usually situated at some distance away from the cities they served
both passengers and freight had to be carried along the surface for anywhere from five to fifteen miles and this was usually done either by automobiles or by socalled motor trucks which worked on the same general principle
sometimes as for instance in traveling from the center of san francisco to the center of los angeles a passenger would have to waste more time getting to and from the airports than he would spend in the air
ralus learns something hat must have been a blink system the boy remarked
ralus dear his mother interposed
how many times have i told you not to say blink or any other slang expression for that matter
excuse me mother
i meant to say that it must have been egregiously inefficient and excerebrose better glad to observe that you are at last beginning to acquire something more than a schoolboys vocabulary
and now to resume our discussion ralus continued
you said daddy that the airplane didnot have any gravinul
i thought the gravinul was invented way back in you are probably thinking about the discovery of the scientific principle on which the gravinul was based
i think it was in that a man named einstein gave the first scientific explanation of the relation between gravitation and magnetism
the gravinul was invented about twenty years later by a man named jones charles jones
but daddy that couldnot be
charles was the name of the man who first flew from new york to paris
you mean lindbergh
yes his name was charles too
in those days there were hundreds of people in the world having the same names
that must have been awfully confusing
it was
when my father was a boy there were over two hundred men named john smith listed in the los angeles city directory
and i guess there were pretty nearly as many named william jones
how could anyone tell them apart
at this point in the conversation kaza interrupted ralus dear you realize you are monopolizing your fathers attention
i also have a few matters i should like to discuss with him
oh excuse me mother
i didnot mean to be discourteous
but there are so many things to learn nowadays
this prompted yek to reprove his wife mildly you think my dear that we ought to encourage ralus to ask questions instead of discouraging him
it was over a hundred years ago that a great philosopher said the unquestioning mind is an unthinking mind and surely we donot want ralus to stop thinking do we
certainly not my dear
i havenot the slightest objection to your answering his questions except that it is almost time for me to leave and i have something to tell you
what is it honey
nothing serious i hope
no nothing serious just that i had grief with my spacemobile yesterday afternoon
the external lubricator went caducous and i had to leave it at reno
the blink mechanic there told me he couldnot have it ready until noon today
ralus began to giggle
what are you laughing at his mother demanded
because youd hardly got through scorching me for using slang when you said caducous and blink in the same paragraph
at this yek laughed heartily
there are some cases where the use of slang is justified
at any rate its better than profanity eh my dear
the worst of it is kaza resumed have to make a trip over zion canyon to get material for a booklet i am to prepare right away
the tourist season hasnot opened yet and the spacebus service there is terrible know what that means yek responded
you want to borrow my spacemobile
no argument about it
help yourself
are you sure you can spare it today
easily
i expect to be working all day in my san francisco laboratory have time to catch the eightfourteen spacebus and that will get me into frisco before nine
thank you so much dear
that certainly is sweet of you
you are quite welcome afraid youve let your coffee get cold
just a moment and have televox bring you a fresh cup
she whistled a short musical strain and in a few seconds the door from the kitchen opened and the grotesque metal body of the televox entered and set a steaming cup of coffee on the table
kaza whistled another little ditty and the mechanical servant glided back into the kitchen again
ralus took advantage of this intermission to pick up his broken thread of questioning
mother dear do you mind if i ask daddy another question
ask as many as you please my son had my little say
this name business is whats puzzling me daddy
it doesnot seem reasonable for even two different persons to have the same name not to mention two hundred persons they register names in those days not until the year our present system of naming was first suggested by a woman named dex a member of the same profession your mother now follows
you mean she was an advertising counsellor
yes
and the interesting thing about it all is that she merely applied to human beings the simple common sense rules which had for years been used in naming pins peanuts pants prunes and other branded articles
the law now requires that a name shall be given to every child and this name must fulfill all these requirements it must be an arbitrary combination of letters that has no meaning and that is different from the name of any person now living it must be easy to spell pronounce and remember
if the child is a girl her name must begin with one of the first thirteen letters in the alphabet
a boys name must with a letter between and parents are allowed ten days from the date of birth to select a name to their liking
naturally they have access to the register at washington in checking for duplication
in case the parents neglect to do this a name is arbitrarily assigned by the naming bureau
there are a lot of other interesting details about the system as for instance the meth of knowing whether a person is married or single and also the occupation but its getting late so have to tell you the rest some other time
domestic difficulties hen yek turned to his wife
you havenot forgotten about that trust deed that falls due tomorrow noon have you dear
you remember donot you that you told me not to worry about it and that you would take care of it
good zenith
so i did
at the time i told you that i felt sure the volim company would pay me that twentyeight hundred they owe me but they have been staving me off and it looks now as if have to sue them to make them pay
but donot you realize that we must have the money in hand not later than tomorrow noon
you know how he is
when he gave us notice that he wouldnot rpew the trust deed i had the feeling that he was trying to get our home away from us know it but i couldnot help it could at least you could have told me before so i could try to get someone else to take over the trust deed just like a woman to leave everything to the last minute
and its just like a man to blame his wife for something that couldnot be helped
it was then that ralus broke into the conversation
now please mother and daddy donot get to quarreling again
first thing you know youll be getting a divorce and then where will i be
cheesity but i wish we could get over these everlasting financial difficulties
seems as if the only time you two start talking mean to each other is when you get to arguing over money matters
you just wait until old enough to work
you can bet do my share so you wonot have to fight over money any more guess the boy is right kaza yek said as he reached over and patted his sons hand
we have enough to worry about without trying to make things unpleasant for each other sorry i spoke harshly
when i get to frisco go in and have a talk with wupiz the capitalist
i think i can persuade him to loan me the money so i can get the trust deed out of hands hope so dear awfully sorry i disappointed you
it was very thoughtless of me not to tell you about my failure to collect that money as i had expected to
oh thats all right honey
we all overlook things once in a while
and take care of it some way phone for an appointment with wupiz while riding on the spacebus
you must be on the lookout for the purple women yek dear his wife admonished him
it wasnot so long ago that they robbed the pacific space express forget that they are depraved and think nothing of taking life
if you happen to get into a robbery be sure to do just what they tell you to wonot you
if they try robbing the bus while on it they are going to get the surprise of their lives yek assured her
what do you mean worked out a little contrivance yesterday and just waiting for a chance to try it out
with it i can shoot out vortex rings of hypnogen
as you know this gas is perfectly harmless but the tiniest whiff of it will put a person to sleep for several hours
the orifice for discharging the gas is in one of the buttons on my coat
i can aim it simply by moving my head
when i want to discharge it all i have to do is bring my toes together
this joins two exposed wires in the tips of my boots making an electrical contact which causes a ring of gas to shoot out in exactly the same direction i happen to be looking at that time
well i hope it works all right
but whatever you do for heavens sake be careful wonot you dear worry honey
when do you expect to leave have to get going right away
then see you off
kaza whistled for televox to remove the breakfast dishes
then the three of them prepared to don their flying coats
these garments were made of a tough waterproof fabric that resembled leather but was much lighter and more flexible
between each sleeve and the sides of the coat was a triangular membrane which reminded one of the wings of a bat
when the arms of the wearer were extended horizontally these membranes were stretched tight and formed a pair of serviceable wings
the coat bulged slightly between the shoulders to allow room for the gravinul a small box about four inches square and threequarters of an inch thick
this was controlled by small cylinders held in either hand and connected to the gravinul with wires running along the sleeves
ralus was just about to put on his flying coat when his mother called to him ralus come here
let me look at your ears
just as i thought
you march right in and give those ears a good scrubbing young man
the idea of eating your breakfast with a dirty face
my face isnot dirty mother
i washed it good in front
you mean you washed it well in front
but you know very well that you have to wash it on the sides too and donot forget the back of your neck
all right mother and ralus disappeared into the bathroom
into the air this time kaza and yek were drawing on their flying boots which fitted snugly about their calves and reached almost to their knees
these boots had unusually long and pointed toes and the space between the top of the foot and the front of the shin was filled with another triangular piece of membrane very similar in character to the wings on the coats
it was quite apparent that the purwse of these boots was to provide a sort of tail and stabilizer
both kaza and yek wore breeches not unlike those used by american soldiers during the last war
a headgear with goggles attached completed the outfit
when they were thus attired it was hard to tell which was the man and which the woman
according to the standards of an earlier day they might have bn considered illformed
their arms especially seemed overdeveloped and were so long that their hands reached below their knees
when they walked their toes pointed straight outward at right angles to the direction in which they were going
to one who was familiar with the mode of life which this couple were living they were both beautiful specimens of humanity
they certainly carried themselves with an air of confidence and of alertness that was both physical and mental
when they were ready to leave they walked to the only exit to this doorless stairless house which was a traoor leading to the roof
yek touched a button and the trap door swung open
then kaza gave a little spring and floated swiftly and gracefully through the opening followed closely by her husband
seems to be a lot of traffic this morning yek remarked as he directed his gaze skyward imagine many of those people are going to santa monica to see the finish of the winging derby that started from shanghai the day before yesterday his wife suggested
the air was indeed crowded with spacemobiles and individual wingers
while a large percentage of them were headed westward there were thousands of others darting at terrific speeds in other directions
an observer who was not familiar with the regulations governing their seemingly aimless flight might have wondered how they could possibly avoid colliding with each other in midair
it will be recalled however that a carefully planned system of air traffic regulation had been evolved as a result of many serious accidents which had occurred at an earlier time when flying was so limited in scope that no special laws regulating flight had been deemed necessary
there were eight zone levels for air traffic each feet deep and separated by turning zones feet deep
the northbound zone extended from to feet
then came the north to northeast turning zone between the and foot levels
the northeastbound section included the space between feet high and feet with the turning one running from feet to feet altitudes and so on
all turns had to be made to the right or in clockwise rotation
overtaking was invariably done on the left side and the law required at least fifty feet of clearance between passing flyers
when these rules were carefully obeyed there was practically no possibility of collisions occurring but every once in a while some reckless or irresponsible pilot would disregard an important rule and would cause a serious accident
besides the spacemobiles there were the spacebuses which varied greatly in size and carried from to passengers each
they invariably followed definite airlanes which were marked by air buoys anchored to the ground with luminous steel cables at intervals one mile apart
each of these buoys was provided with a landing platform for taking on passengers
one of the mooring cables could be seen about yards from the place where kaza was now preparing to take to the air in spacemobile
better stop at a zip service landing and get a refill of pressed air yek told kaza as she stepped into the machine which was parked in the double hangar on the roof of their home
the spacemobile was about fifteen feet long and five feet high
in its general conformation it resembled the hull of an old fashioned submarine boat
there were no wheels propellers rudders elevators or large protuberances of any kind
in looking at it an aeronautical engineer would instantly have noticed that the shape of the device was marvelously well designed to offer the least possible resistance to the air through which it traveled
the drivers compartment was just behind the nose of the flyer the remainder of the room being devoted to seats for four additional passengers space for storage and for the operating equipment
clear vision in all directions was secured by constructing the entire front end of the spacemobile of some transparent but extremely strong and flexible material and by an ingenious combination of prisms and mirrors that enabled the driver to see everything behind above and below without turning the head
the gravinul explained aza entered the machine through a small door which followed exactly the conformation of the body and could be closed hermetically
she did something to the controls and instantly the spacemobile rose gently from the floor of the hangar and drifted gracefully out into the open
kaza blew a kiss to her husband
there was a hiss of escaping air and the spacemobile shot upward
within a few seconds it had bome a mere speck in the distance
yek was just about to poise himself for a flight when he heard ralus calling him just a minute daddy
please wait for me like to wing up to the landing stage with you if youll let me
all right sonny boy
since heading north well only go to the first landing and we wonot have to cross any traffic zones so i guess you can come along this time
whereupon ralus who was now garbed in his flying outfit suddenly stretched his arms out at right angles to his sides gave a little leap and darted swiftly up into the air see you catch me daddy he shouted over his shoulder
then he began the most astonishing series of maneuvers in the air
he rolled and somersaulted and looped and soared
no bird that flew was ever as graceful and as agile as ralus was
he seemed more at home in the air than on the ground
his father soon caught up with him and playfully grasped him by the nape of the neck
come on he cried no time for monkey business
the bus is almost due now
within a few seconds they had reached the foot landing and had seated themselves on the bench provided there
tell me sonny boy said yek why did you ask to come with me this morning
was it because you enjoy your daddys company
in a way yes
i always enjoy being with you of course daddy dear
but to be perfectly honest with you the main reason why i came with you is that i want to ask you some more questions
so thats whats in the air is it
i thought as much
well youd better fire away because there isnot going to be much time for elucidations unless the pacific space express is late and you know that doesnot happen very often
the first question i want to ask is about the spacemobile
you remember yesterday you promised to explain to me how it works very simple my boy
the thing that keeps it up in the air is the gravinul practically the same as the one in your flying coat except that its much larger and more powerful
you know how the gravinul works donot you donot believe i do except that it nullifies gravity not exactly correct
it doesnot nullify gravity although the name might naturally give you that impression
all it does is to surround itself with a field of energy through which the attractive force of gravitation has difficulty in penetrating
the strength of this field can be varied by increasing the power in the gravinul
when you are winging you regulate this by the amount of pressure you apply to your grips
in the spacemobile it is controlled by a small lever operated with the left foot
and what makes the spacemobile move ahead so fast
that too is simple
it depends on the same principle as the sky rockets you shot off last fourth of july
when you study physics you will learn of this principle as the law of reaction which says that for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction
this accounts for the recoil of a firearm the bouncing of a rubber ball and a number of other familiar phe nomena
the driving force is nothing but air
but it is air in a very compressed form
even before my time tists knew how to make liquid air but it is only within the last five years that a method was discovered for compressing this liquid into a very small space
an other improvement was made in the method of manu facture
liquid air was formerly made by a process so expensive that it could not be used for practical purposes
but pressed liquid air is now prepared in huge plants operated entirely by sunlight and is very cheap
ten liters of it cost only thirtyfive cents and will drive a spacemobile at the rate of a thousand miles an hour or more for about four hours
but daddy how was it that they werenot able to travel more than three hundred miles an hour with airplanes that were worked by propellers
one reason was that these airplanes offered a tremendous amount of resistance to the air as they traveled through it
an interesting thing to remember about this resistance is that it increases with the square of the velocity
this means that when you travel miles per hour the resistance is four times as great as when you are going miles an hour
if you increase your speed to miles an hour the resistance is nine times as much as it is at miles per hour and so on
unless something is done to cut down this resistance it doesnot take long before you reach a point where it requires a terrific amount of power to increase the speed just a little bit
the airplane designers made a little headway in improving the shape of the fuselage wings struts and other parts exposed to the air
they found that an object with a cross section like an elongated ellipse of certain proportions would offer the minimum amount of resistance because it prevented the formation of air eddies and vacuum pockets
they also took pains to keep all surfaces as smooth as possible
it seems rather funny though that no one at that time thought of the simple expedient of lubricating the outside of the airplane although they seemed to understand a lot about lubricating the internal working parts of the machine
the spacemobile makes use of an ingenious device for lubricating the entire outside surface of the conveyance
this reduces the friction of the air against the sides to such an extent that hello
here comes the spacebus i have to start my magnetizer going
better fly along ralus boy
and watch your winging
there are a lot of spacemobiles ascending this morning so keep that little head of yours turning around like a wise old owls
so long honey boy
goodbye daddy
see you tonight and ralus took off in a gracefully executed swan drive toward the ground
a game of mathic rose and poised himself with arms outstretched as the huge flyer shot toward him
it slowed down gradually and then yek winged up to a landing platform in the bottom
yek found he had barely enough money to pay his fare
there was plenty of room in the huge flyer and all sorts of conveniences were provided for the comfort and entertainment of the passengers
at each seat were a pair of earphones and a device resembling a small opera glass
yek strapped on both the earphones and the binoculars and with their help he heard the latest news and at the same time saw several important events while they were actually happening
he was thus engaged when sedix a resident of san diego passed near and recognized him
come on yek old man sedix greeted him looking for a fourth to make up a game of mathic
never mind the news nothing of consequence happening now
come on and join us
yek needed no urging
he accompanied his friend to the game room near the forward end of the bus
yek needed no introduction to the other two persons
their names prominently displayed on the breasts of their flying coats were dineli ron archi and tonida ron dineli stu
this told yek their sex marital relations and occupation as well as their individual names
the larger of the two he knew must be a woman since her name dineli began with a letter in the first half of the alphabet
the ron informed him that she was married and that her husbands name was ron
archi was an abbrevation of architect her occupation
tonida was of course a mans name and the masculine name ron following it signified that he was unmarried and that his fathers name was ron
this was followed by the name of his mother dineli
his occupation as indicated by stu was student
in accordance with this system the name on coat was yek kaza chem his wife was labeled kaza yek adv and his son ralus yek kaza stu
an unmarried woman would be designated by her individual name followed by her mothers name and then by her fathers
in addressing any individual the first name only was used the others being merely informative in purpose
honorary titles such as mister miss rrofessor colonel and doctor had long since been abolished
as was the custom when two men met for the first time yek said greetings tonida and was answered greetings yek
he also bowed to dineli but did not speak to her until she had exercised her womans prerogative and had signified her willingness to meet him by saying greetings yek whereupon he responded with another bow and greetings dineli they sat down at a table shaped like a fourleafed clover and sedix started shuffling a peculiar deck of cards
to a watcher who was not familiar with it the game of mathic would have seemed excessively complicated
it could be played only by those who were well versed in higher mathematics
it was essentially a contest of brains and the winner had to demonstrate his superior alertness of mind and his accuracy in working out complex problems in differential calculus mentally and with amazing rapidity
not far from them were two very old men gazing fixedly at a dilapidated chess board
can you imagine those old fogies dineli remarked playing such a babys game as chess
i happen to know the wife of one of those fellows and she actually is so puerile that she still plays bridge
they picked up their cards and began to play
hope sedix doesnot start boring us with more yarns about that new baby of his yek thought as he concentrated his attention on his hand
but he had hardly registered that suggestion on his inner consciousness before sedix started you know that baby daughter of mine sure pulled a chunky one on us yesterday
as usual my wife and i went to our offices and left the baby in the care of the televox
of course my wife got a connection every hour and whistled for a report
at eleven oclock televox signalled back that the baby was lost
my wife told televox to look in a dozen different places but each time the message came back baby missing
then wife began to get alarmed
called me all excited and said she was sure the rurple women had stolen our offspring
made me quit work and dash home clear from fresno
the wife ducked home too of course
for some time we couldnot locate the little eel until i happened to go into my bedroom and i heard a funny peep coming from under my bed
i looked and there the little blatherskite was
she had climbed out of her crib and had crawled through three rooms and had hidden under my bed cry a bit just peeped and cooed like a cute little bird
now what do you think of that for a girl only five months old very remarkable said yek icily but sedix was completely oblivious of the sarcasm and continued to recite story after story of his only childs prowesses most of which yek had heard at least a dozen times before
they finished the first game which was won by tonida
sedix complimented him with the remark you play an unusually tonic game for a man as young as you are
specializing in mathematics i suppose yes sedix working for my degree at stanford
tonida always was precocious his mother proudly enthused
he even worked out the formula for the hecantonicosiahedragon when he was only eleven
talking about precocity yek interposed you should have heard the humptydumpty screamer my son ralus pulled at breakfast this morning
his mother rebuked him for calling something a blink system and the little blatherskite came back at her with some yank about he meant to say it was regiously inefficient and excerebrose
then a few minutes after that my wife got excited about her spacemobile breaking down and she forgot herself and said excuse me yek sedix interrupted
but have to drop off at fresno and were almost there
wingey wing see you later and he rudely departed without waiting to learn what wife had said when she forgot herself
about the purple women sedix declared he was going to drop off he didnot mean it literally
when a passenger wished to leave the bus he signalled for it to stop he descended to the landing platform and winged off to the station
once in the open air he could regulate the speed of his drop by means of his gravinul
a skilled winger could easily soar directly to his destination and could set himself down within a few seconds after he had left the spacebus
the departure of sedix broke up the game so the remaining trio rose to leave the game room
as they were about to pass into the main body of the bus yek noticed for the first time a man and a woman each of whom was carrying a small compact machine gun
this was enough to proclaim their vocations even without their police uniforms
since the laws against selling weapons of any kind to civilians had been so rigidly enforced that it was unheard of for anyone but a soldier or officer of the law to be seen carrying a firearm suppose they were hired by the bus company for protection against the purple women yek remarked to dineli
can you imagine anything more ridiculous than those two officers hoping to stop the purple women with those antiquated machine guns
they might as well use pea shooters about what it amounts to dineli agreed
funny isnot it that the police donot seem able to keep pace with the crooks always been that way
as far back as the days when men rode horses the bandits usually had the fastest mounts and the most efficient weapons
and it was the same story in the days of the automobile
why even that machine gun the police are using now was invented way back in by a crook
and the police didnot adopt it until the criminals had discarded it in favor of a more efficient weapon
then came the organization of the purple women with their vibrators
after six years of terror the authorities havenot the faintest idea of how these vibrators work
all they know is that with one of these compact little weapons a crook can either torture paralyze or completely annihilate any number of human beings at will
against them our police force is helpless
did you say police force asked tonida think a better name would be police by this time they had found seats in the main body of the bus
dineli and tonida adjusted their ear phones and televiews but yek found his diversion by looking out of the window
his attention was arrested by a spacemobile which was flying close to the spacebus
its appearance was so peculiar that it was conspicuous even among the thousands of other similar conveyances which crowded the air
while its general conformation was quite similar to that of the standard types of spacemobiles there was something odd about it which yek was not able to pick out at first
then he noticed that the space in the rear where the rocket tubes protruded was outlandishly shaped
even more surprising than that was the gas shooting out from these tubes which was actually visible and was greenish in color
the machine was close enough so that yek could count the occupants
there were three of them
the side door opened and two of the passengers climbed out on the roof of the flyer
it was quite apparent that they were preparing to board the bus
while the transfer of passengers from a spacemobile to a spacebus in midair was sometimes resorted to in an emergency it was unusual enough to arouse special interest
a radio signal was transferred between the two cars to slow them down to the same low speed
yek therefore watched closely as each of the strangers poised himself and flew onto the landing platform
the holdup rose and moved closer to the entrance opening in order to scrutinize the new arrivals at close quarters
thus yek happened to be standing in the aisle when they came toward the spacebus
he looked first at their left breasts but instead of the names to indicate their sex marital condition and occupations he saw nothing but two unsightly blots of purple
it was a hideous color that gave the same unpleasant sensation to the eyes that a ld stench does to the nostrils
yek also noticed that they not only wore the conventional helmet and goggles but the lower part of their faces were covered
involuntarily yek gasped out loud the purple women and at the same instant each of the intruders whipped from under her coat a peculiar cupshaped weapon
in unison the women yelped reach high everyone yek along with other passengers lost no time in obeying this command
in the excitement he forgot all about his carefully planned scheme for outwitting the criminals
he was standing in the aisle a few feet away from the two purple women who stood with their backs against the rear wall of the bus
turn around one of them yelled
face the other way
yek in complying was forced to stand in such a position that his gas projecting device was useless
one of the purple women remained in the rear of the bus where she could keep close watch on its occupants and her accomplice went methodically from one person to another demanding money and valuables
yek was one of the first to be robbed and he gave up his watch without a murmur
he reflected that he was fortunate in having only a small sum of money with him but soon discovered that this was a serious misfortune instead
the rage of the purple woman when she learned that yek had only a few dollars to contribute was frightful
she cursed him with foul obscene oaths and leveled her cupshaped weapon at him
there was a low whirring sound and immediately yek experienced a most excruciating pain
he began to tremble violently from a mysterious vibration which shook every bone muscle and tissue in his body producing a horrible agonizing sensation
there snarled the purple woman just a tiny dose
next time we catch you traveling with so little money youll get a lot more so take care and she moved on to the next victim
it was at this point that the two members of the police force became aware of what was happening
they were gloriously courageous those two defenders of law and order especially the woman
without a moments hesitation she leveled her machine gun and sent a stream of hot bullets point blank at the nearest purple woman
the hail of steel jacketed slugs spattered against the crooks garments and mask like raindrops on a tin roof
they seemed to have no effect whatever except to make the purple woman more angry
she pointed her vibrator at the policewoman and it emitted a highpitched screeching noise
apparently she was using a great deal more power than she had when she tortured yek
the body of the officer shook like a disturbed bit of jelly and within a second or two had completely disintegrated until not even a speck of dust remained of what was once a splendidly built human being
even in the face of this unspeakable evidence of the purple invulnerable power the male officer still had the valor to raise his machine gun
he didnot have time to pull the trigger however before the trembling death was upon him
this time the murderess elected to maim rather than kill and the vibrator struck a middle note in its ominous song
the policeman dropped to the floor completely paralyzed except for his eyes which rolled horribly in their sockets and seemed to beg mutely for death
like a hungry wolf amid a flock of helpless sheep the purple woman spun around and snapped out does anyone else want a dose
one more false move and vibrate the whole bunch of you to hell as she turned to cover the entire bus with her alert eyes her face came directly in range with the button on coat which was connected with his asphyxiating apparatus
quickly but cautiously yek brought his toes together
this completed an electric circuit and a tiny vortex ring of gas shot out
it was almost colorless and to anyone but a trained chemist who was watching for it the ring was invisible
yek noticed with disappointment that it went wide of its mark
but he shifted his head in the direction which he thought would correct the aim and again brought his toes together
this time he scored a bullseye and the arrogant female bully crumpled like a deflated toy balloon
the other purple woman was behind yek and he dared not turn to attack her knowing that she would vibrate him at the first false move
but when she saw her companion in distress she hastened to assist her
as she strode along the aisle she had to brush yek out of the way and at that instant a desperate ruse popped into his head
he happened to be standing directly over one of the trapdoors
as the purple woman rushed past him he grasped her belt and at the same instant turned his magnetizer full power into reverse
with a sudden jolt yek and the purple woman were hurled through the opening
it was a risky thing for yek to do but he depended on taking advantage of the suddenness of his surprise strategem
battle in the air i succeeded far better than he had hoped
in the excitement the purple woman let go of her vibrator keen eyes saw it as it fell and he also noticed that it was dropping faster than the two hunan bodies which because of their flying suits offered more resistance to the air
yek released his hold on the purple woman and with all the force he could muster winged straight downward in pursuit of the rapidly descending vibrator
when she sensed his purpose his antagonist joined the chase
as he dropped at a terrific speed yek ever intent on knowing what was going on all around him followed the advice he had given that morning to his son and kept his head turning around almost like an owls
he noticed with some alarm that the purple spacemobile had altered its course and was descending rapidly evidently with the idea of aiding antagonist
the purple woman was a powerful winger and she had nearly overtaken yek when he caught up with the vibrator and snatched it out of the air
by this time he was within less than a hundred feet of the ground and descending at such a terrific speed that he was in danger of being dashed to pieces
just in time he spread his wings and manipulated his foot fins in such a way that he shot skyward again in a graceful zoom
then he soared swiftly downward landing as gently as a feather
a hundred feet away from him the purple woman was also in the act of alighting
immediately she dashed toward yek in a series of awkward leaps
yek pointed the vibrator at her and pressed everything he could find on the contraption
after what seemed an eternity he heard the shrill buzz and the whole atmosphere around him began to quiver
the purple woman ceased her leaping but did not seem to be at all bothered by the vibrations
instead she was fiendishly amused
when she was about fifteen feet away from him she halted and began to laugh
it was the most malevolent laugh that yek had ever heard
it was the sort of laugh that is commonly ascribed to his satanic majesty when he gloats over the unfortunate souls who are being tormented in purgatory
it was then that the dreadful truth flashed over yek
the purple woman wore an armor that protected her not only from bullets but also from the effects of her own diabolical weapon
but yek had learned that she was vulnerable in one place
she had to breathe
as she stood there mocking him with her wicked laughter yek took careful aim with his asphyxiation apparatus and brought his toes together
the laughter died as if her throat had been cut and the purple woman seemed to melt like a jelly fish when it is thrown on the sunlit sand
that left but one more menace for yek to face the woman in the strange spacemobile
she had delayed alighting apparently at loss to understand what had happened to her companions
but now it was quite clear that she was coming straight for yek who realized that he would be caught at a great disadvantage since he knew she would start to vibrate him long before he could hope to catch her within range of his asphyxiator
she was just on the point of setting her flyer down a short distance away frcwn yek when the air was rent by the earpiercing shriek of a siren
jubilantly yek understood what that meant
it was the police distress signal
a hero in his own home a lmost instantly the call was answered from six different directions and as if by magic a number of police flyers loomed up seemingly from nowhere
this distracted the attention of the remaining purple woman and saved yek from the ordeal of a onesided encounter with her
with insolent disregard for the police flyers the bandit guided her car right through their very midst
bullets rattled harmlessly against the sides of her spacemobile
she played with the police officers flying around their slow spacemobiles which were capable of making only miles an hour
then when she had had enough of this horseplay she shot out a dense cloud of dark green smoke through her rocket tubes and fairly melted out of sight
one of the policemen spied yek and set his spacemobile down in the field in which he was standing
he proved to be zamot a captain of detectives
when yek pointed to the motionless body of the purple woman the officer expressed his astonishment and admiration sure done something yek old man he cried
this is the first time in six years that one of the purple women has been captured alive also captured a vibrator yek declared proudly going to take it to my laboratory and see if i canot discover the principle so well be able to find some way to protect ourselves against it
fine work the officer complimented him
if you want me to take charge of your prisoner and see that she is locked up
by all means yek agreed
she will be insensible for about two hours but after that youd better watch out and see that she is carefully guarded
you know these purple women are bad actors and they are famous for their cleverness and resourcefulness worry clip her wings for her so shell never vibrate anyone again
and by the way zamot you might also arrange to have the other purple woman taken off the spacebus
the other one do you mean to tell me you caught a brace of them you ought to be on the police force no thanks yek smiled as he thought of factious reference to the police farce
now that the excitement was all over yek suddenly became conscious of the fact that he was painfully upset
every now and then his body would start trembling due no doubt to the after effects of the vibrating he had received at the hands of the female bandit
he was about to wing up to a landing and catch a spacebus for home when a familiar spacemobile loomed up above him
a moment later it had alighted and his wife rushed to him and gathered him into her strong arms
yek
my darling she cried
how you frightened me
you were splendid yek dear but oh i wish you would not be so reckless
then you saw it all
most of it
a smart reporter got the story almost the instant it happened and put it on the radionews
as soon as i learned it was the bus you had taken i turned around and flew toward you keeping the bus in focus on my teleview all the time
i caught the tail of your falling race with the purple woman and the fight you had with her on the ground
but you must be pretty well shaken up you think youd better come home now dear guess better yek murmured and he collapsed so that his wife had to drag him into the spacemobile
when they arrived home kaza insisted on putting yek to bed though he protested that all he needed was a half hours rest to make him fit again
you run along kaza dear he told her be all right
you mustnot neglect your work on my account too late to make that zion canyon trip now and theres nothing else thats particularly pressing so i may as well stay home for the rest of the day and take care of you
she directed televox to prepare a light meal and after yek had rested for a while they sat up and ate their luncheon
the home is saved after three oclock ralus arrived and was astonished and delighted to find both of his parents home
explanations followed and yek had to spend the rest of the afternoon answering innumerable questions which his son asked him about every conceivable phase of his exciting adventure
it was not until they were eating their evening meal that the subject of the trust deed now almost due again came up for discussion
this time kaza thought of it first
what about the trust deed she suddenly cried
you didnot have an opportunity to do anything about it of course
great zenith no her husband exclaimed
this robbery business certainly ruined the day for me afraid that means well have to give up our little home
one more thing to blame on the purple women we do something tomorrow morning donot see how that would be possible
wupiz never shows up at his office on saturdays and it would only make him angry if i tried to talk business with him at the country club the only one i know that has any capital to invest right now and its rather late to dig up someone else
just then a mysterious voice seeming to come from nowhere said is yek there
ralus had just started to ask his father a question when kaza interrupted him saying please be quiet for a moment dear while daddy answers the radiophone
without talking into any instrument or even rising from his seat yek said quietly this is yek talking
his voice must have been caught by some hidden microphone
this is quimid vicepresident of the pacific coast spacebus company
i just want to notify you that your reward money has been deposited at the government bank
reward money
what do you mean you know
the reward for capturing the purple women
how much is it
ten thousand dollars you hear the announcement
it was made this morning just ten minutes before the holdup occurred
we offered for each bandit caught after holding up any of our spacebuses
you certainly are to be complimented on your promptness in winning the rewards
and in lialf of the entire law abiding citizenship of the united states we wish to thank you for the service you have rendered
a loving cup is now being engraved to commemorate your great deed and this will be presented to you tomorrow
yek was overcome
all he could say was thank you very very much
both kaza and ralus had heard the entire conversation of course
said kaza how proud i am of you yek dear
said ralus well it looks as if our financial difficulties are over at last

editor park place new york city
i have checked on the coupon below the stories i like best in this issue and have listed them in the order of my preference w remarks and suggestions name address city state i cut through tlie upper wing and then as i tore back i cut it completely off
the great plane staggerea as backed away
its pilot strove mightily to right it but the ship reeled drunkenly to earth all came about through being laughed at
one resents having his pet hobby ridiculed
why mr clare your ideas relative to the airplane of the future are visionary and impractical
you speak of obtaining your gas from sea weed
how absurd general morley at that time head of the aeronautical division of the united states army spoke scornfully
he looked around at the other members of the board for their endorsement
colonel brandon eyeing me coldly nodded his approval
demonstrate your gas challenged colonel brandon
you seem to forget
colonel brandon that through the influence of senator ballantree i recently gave this board a chance to test it
but the board refused to comply with my conditions to safeguard my secret
now i will demonstrate it only in the plane
however i grant you this much the gas is carried in a dry concentrated form
here gentlemen in this small cube i went on taking the cube from my pocket and holding it aloft is enough material to make one thousand cubic feet of nonexplosive gas by the addition of a little water
as i have stated before it has only onefifth the weight of helium
those are extravagant claims observed colonel brandon am prepared to prove them revolutionary as they are i said
but i lack funds
uncle sam cannot play santa claus all the time smiled the general
at present he is taking a rest
besides there are many failures in the airplane game you know remarked colonel brandon
you are right i agpeed with asperity
but all the failures cannot be laid at the inventors doors or on the machines themselves
the general frowned and colonel brandon glared
show us a working model demanded funeral morley
demonstrate your right to speak on this momentous subject
my record overseas during the late war and my work as an air mail pilot give me that right
general i answered a little proudly
as to my theory i have demonstrated it to my own satisfaction
when i build another plane it will be large enough to carry me into the air
you scout my ability to construct a workable plane differing radically from those you have always known
you are afraid to get out of the rut
you are blind to the war cloud shadowing our horizon
i desire to give my plane to my country to save it from devastation very laudable ambition smiled the general
but have a care of course remember the author o in the air
here he is back with another excellent air story different from the first one and just as excellent
here is an aviation story of the future full of fight adventure and good science
indeed the things that the author brings out in this story are no more impossible years hence than the present airplane was impossible years ago
and one should not scoff at the idea that one man singlehanded could not have a successful battle with another nation
it all depends on the power of the instrument that he has
remember the monitor which in the civil war changed naval warfare for all time
this was a simple invention and it certainly had a lot to do with winning the war
what our author develops in this story may play just as critical a part in some future contest the world crucifies its saviors am master of the air i declared stoutly disdaining his sarcasm
some day you may acknowledge it
a derisive titter followed this bold statement move that we adjourn this meeting suggested colonel brandon
it is clear mr clare cannot substantiate his claims under the rules laid down by the board
colonel brandon had bitterly opposed me from the first
i had carefully explained my proposed plane but they laughed wisely and shook their heads as i continued to plead my cause and i caught one wise member of the board tapping his forehead sigpiificantly
i turn bandit a last hot with anger i arose from my place at the table and glared at the smiling and amused faces of the experts
i could tolerate their grins but their sarcastic words of doubt stung me to the quick
i regretted that after my weary weeks of waiting senator ballantree had secured this audience
gentlemen i am through with you i snapped giving the senator a look of apology
you are an aggregation of mossgrown antiques
you do not even know the first correct principles of airplane construction
they stared blankly
the first airplane designers followed the build and the movements of the birds to a large extent
am i right quite right agreed general morley
which is the heaviest section of a birds anatomy
i demanded
why its breast of course
correct
but so far airplane engineers have overlooked that fact
therefore the first lesson you experts have to learn is to undersling your motors and shift your center of gravity
good night gentlemen
discouraged and aflame with resentment i walked along with shuffling steps my heart rebellious and bitter
i considered that the whole world was against me
what matter it now that i cherished the given me for my work that terrible night in france when i rescued my buddie lon grand from his crashed and burning plane what mattered my scars of battle my months of sacrifice and toil when i sought to honor my country
now that countrys shortsighted servants turned me down
but despite all my resolve was unbroken by hook or crook i would build the master plane of them all
but where was i to procure the necessary funds
and where build it secretly
the night was dark as befitted my mood
only now and then i glimpsed the stars through rifts in the clouds
i was disgusted with life
i had been buffeted by fate and denied justice
society had spurned me
the thought surged through me like fire
i stopped and gazed about me in the gloom
i was athrill with a new idea i would prey upon that society my plane and finally i walked on reckless as to direction or destination
presently i reached the location of magnificent homes in the suburbs of the city
here was wealth and power to which i had appealed in vain
long strings of chinese lanterns suddenly attracted my attention
a party was in progress
laughter and song drifted to me on the lazy breeze
the merry sounds jarred upon my nerves
what business had other people being happy when i was so miserable
but there was money there money that i needed
something i reckon now it must have been the devil prompted me to leave the walk and wander across the lawn
keeping within the shadows i soon gained a position where i could see and hear the gay gathering
suddenly i heard voices near me and peeping around a clump of shrubbery i saw a young man and a girl seated on a lawn seat
i noted the girls rare beauty the gold of her hair and the blue of her eyes which in the soft glow of the lanterns sparkled like jewels
the young man was comely with brown eyes and a little crop of a mustache
his next words electrifiiitl me
yes dear i am ready to buy a plane at last
i sold the sea and as i was late for the bank the whole twelve thousand is here
he tapped his breast as i drew back a hot surge of emotion sweeping me from head to foot
twelve thousand dollars
with it i could succeed
you should not carry so much money around with you said the girl in alarm
you might be robbed
i gazed off over the crowd and perceived that at least one of the guests was an aviator for a plane stood on the lawn back of the mansion its white wings visible in the dusk
the plane had been turned after landing and now stood facing the golf links
it was then that the tempter beckoned
for the first time in ny life i lost sight of the moral side of life and became a criminal in thought
the urge to build a superplane had driven all other considerations from my mind
the lovers were in a secluded nook
i tied a handkerchief over my face drew my revolver and stepped before them take that twelve thousand buddie i said quietly
hand it over and make no outcry or i will kill you
the girl started to rise then settled back staring belligerently as i flourished the gun
but the young fellow slowly reached within his coat drew forth a fat envelope and handed it over without a word
many thanks old man i said
consider this only as a loan
both of you keep still for five minutes
then i leaped away
straight for the airplane i ran
nobody seemed to notice me and i was seated ill the cockpit holding to the stick and pressing the starter button before i heard a cry of alarm
the motor responded the propeller whirred and i streaked away over the lawn
a run of a few rods then i gave her the gun and zoomed into the air at a dangerous angle
rapidly i mounted in a close spiral
as i circled back over the lawn i saw the guests gathered in groups gazing up at me and gesticulating madly
but i was soon lost to them and the lights of washington blinked out in walls of whirling vapor
in a few minutes i was speeding above the clouds with the soft starlight upon me
now that i had escaped where away i wondered
i had no plan other than to get far away with my plunder
i examined the gasoline gauges
the tanks were nearly full
i had enough fuel for a long voyage
and then i thought of a haven for my operations
several hundred miles to the south on a peak of the great smoky mountains was a freak of nature a level plateau of rock perhaps an eighth of a mile long and nearly as wide
once while carrying the mail i had made a forced landing there
it was inaccessible from below for the rose sheerly two hundred feet on every side
best of ail on one end was a sheltered nook formed by a great overhanging rock which was screened by a cluster of pine
here i could house the plane safe from the eyes of some aviator who might chance to wing his way over the peak
here i could construct my plane
but i needed help for the task
slowly and with great risk i must transport my materials tothe mountain top under cover of the night
i must construct a small machine shop with all its accessories
and i could not do all this alone
in my perplexity i thought of lon grand good old lon
he would do anything for me
although he was suffering from the aftermath of many wounds and his mind was somewhat clouded by shell shock he was an expert airplane mechanic whenever his wandering fancy allowed him to work at it
but he was an unreliable employee sometimes wandering away from his work for months and nobody knew where he was
however i felt sure that he would stick by me
well without delay i sought lon found him and he agreed to my scheme with enthusiasm
the superplane will pass over the months of lonesome toil that followed the heartbreaking disappointments and failures my many narrow escapes from the searching hands of the law many moody spells when i had to nurse his ambition and watch him as i would a hpby
for more than two years we labored there on that gray mountain top
but at last it was done the scourge of the air and its performance exceeded my expectations
when at last all was ready i seated myself in the drivers seat started the motors and seized the controls
straight into the sky we shot at marvelous speed
over my shoulder stood lon his great eyes shining with wonder and delight
then i tried out the plane on the level my gyroscope maintaining it perfectly
and we descended vertically rapidly or slowly as we chose
had anything gone radically wrong with the mechanism of the plane i knew that it would not crash for housed in the wings in sections of the frame in the casing of the cabin and in other special parts made to contain it was my supergas noninflammable and of tremendous lifting power
how i thanked my lucky stars that although i had given up my studies iri chemistry to go to war i had resumed them when i returned
while this gas was not strong enough to lift the plane and its load it rendered it buoyant so that the motors had only to drive it through the air
this i knew to be the airplane of the future the superplane which i had endeavored to give to my country
the plane was armored well for warfare
on both top and bottom as well as at each end was a long sharp steel spike for ramming purposes
the cabin and all vital parts were protected by sheets of steel backed by aluminum and asbestos
the four propellers one at each end and one top and bottom were protected by machinegun fire
in sailing on the level the propeller on the prow was pulling the plane forward the one on the rear was driving it ahead
those top and bottom used only in ascending and descending had a similar office
the wings resembling those of a bird but comiaratively small and to be folded back on occasion were made of metal
the tail flexible and expanding followed that of a bird in flight as near as it was physically possible to make it
the plane could not go into a tail spin or a nose dive because the center of gravity its greatest weight was underneath like that of a bird
and the construction of the tail enabled one to dive or ascend at any angle he might choose
but now that i was ready to make the purblind servants of my country pay for their folly i was reluctant to do so
my madness was over
i had built my plane
even with skilful help the triumph was mine
besides my conscience had been newly awakened
i longed to get back into the ranks of men to do some good with my plane to make amends for my folly
but i could not see my way clear to do so
i was an outlaw and justice would not forget
perhaps some day i would give myself up
so i foolishly postponed the day of reckoning
the spirit of revenge urged me on and an opportunity to continue plundering whispered its alluring message
how easy it all was
locks and doors are not on the roofs of business blocks and banks and scuttles are seldom locked or if locked are easily opened
and i was able to land anywhere even on a roof but a rod or two square
so the pickings were easy
unprepared for robbers from the sky the police were nonplussed
they knew not where or when i would strike
always i flew without lights and dropped like a plummet from the sky
to satisfy my foolish vanity i always left my card on which i wrote the air master
on the rare occasions when i obtained a newspaper i read accounts of my exploits and wild descriptions of my plane which many had glimpsed
but after a few months the people woke up and the press of the entire country called loudly for an air police patrol for all cities
and soon on my nightly errands i beheld the lights on their clumsy planes darting above the towns
i laughed at their maneuvers
i could dodge them so easily
lon patient and often in a daze asked no questions and made no comments
i often wondered whether he suspected the nature of my frequent trips to the north
carefully i strove to keep it from him for i dreaded the accusing finger of his scorn
lon was pure gold
chase mellow night in the early fall i set out on a mission of restitution
for the first time lon asked to accompany me and i had a hard time to convince him that it was better for me to go alone
he seemed to sense danger of some sort and of late he had been acting more queer than usual
at length he bowed in silent agreement and i set out
since the night i stole the money and the plane i had not seen the girl of the golden hair but often i had seen her in my dreams
with me i carried twenty thousand dollars in two packages eight thousand for the owner of the plane i had stolen and the remainder to reimburse the young man of the chaplin mustache
i considered the girl the best medium through which to reach those persons could i but find her
these few short months of hectic crime had saddened me and taught me a lesson
i was tired of it all
taking a long chance i flew low above the girls home dropped lower and lower unobserved for the mufflers reduced the motors noise to a minimum
i noticed a large plane standing on the same spot that had been occupied by the one i had forcibly borrowed
i saw no one about so i landed near it and carefully approached the house
i had resolved to ring the bell ask for the young lady and boldly deliver the money into her hands
if sloe should not be there then to some other member of the family
should my plane be discovered during my short absence it would fall into the hands of the police and i would become a fugitive on 4and with capture almost certain
but once more luck was with me
rounding the end of a hedge i almost stumbled against the girl i sought
she was sitting beside the young man i had robbed in much the same attitude i had beheld them more than two years before
the young man wore the uniform of the police air patrol and the bright wings jf an officer gleamed upon his breast
i wore no mask but it was evident they did not recognize me as the infamous air bandit
bowing to the young lady i took the packages of money from my pocket convey this to the owner of the airplane that was stolen from this lawn about two years ago i said tossing the money in her lap
and you my dear sir i continued handing the staring young fellow the other package be kind enough to accept this as restitution for the money you loaned me that night
i turned sprang around the end of the hedge and rail for my plane
but i was not to escape so easily
the air bandit i heard the young man shout and almost with the words a bullet winged past my ear
i looked back over my shoulder
he was coming after me firing as he ran and the girl was close at his heels
fortunately his aim was bad but suddenly from nowhere it seemed servants of the estate came running to his assistance
all might have been well had i not stepped into a depression of the ground and turned my ankle
i stumbled and fell within a rod of my plane but as i rose the air patrolman clubbing his pistol was upon me firing as he ran and the girl was close at his heels on again the girl at his side
she clung to me desperately as we staggered forward
at last i felled the young airman with a blow to the jaw threw off the clinging hands of the girl and reached my plane
in another minute i was shooting skyward like a rocket but even as i did so i saw the airman rise to his feet and followed by the girl make for his own plane
in a few minutes they were in the air and climbing steadily
i smiled for before they could gain altitude i would be off and away at a speed of nearly four hundred miles an hour
but i had reckoned wrong
i soon became aware that the air above and around me was swarming with planes of the police air patrol
evidently they had spotted me and followed me as i flew over the city
my errand of restitution was likely to cost me my liberty perhaps my life
my good resolves my plan of reform faded away in a red mist of hate
they sought my life and had no mercy
what chance had anyway i asked myself at the hands of justice
she was blind and deaf and dumb and never forgave her erring children
now they were pecking away at me with machine guns the bullets rattling against the struts of my plane and drumming against the walls of the cabin
my upward retreat was cut off by two planes which were nosing down toward me
i knew that i could whip them but i desired to escape without bloodshed
still others were closing in from all sides
i saw that i must fight that i must send down some of my foes
how willingly i would have surrendered could i have been sure of a square deal so far i had not shed blood in my life of unlawful gain
i shrank from it even now
the steel points on my plane could rip through cloth or wood or steel
my landing gear folded up out of the way of the lower point which could be made terribly effective in attack
i had built the whole plane the same as i would have done had the government approved my idea
so i darted aside and allowed the two planes to spend their energy in the dive
then as they flattened out below me i dropped down with terrific speed
the pilots of the police planes evidently dazed by this novel method of attack and in the dark as to my intentions maneuvered to elude me
too late
in a twinkling the steelpointed bottom of my plane had ripped away a wing of the nearest machine
i turned sharply as it went plunging earthward
before the other pilot had time to dge me i tore off his wings and he followed his comrade down to earth
turn kidnapper darted upward again intending to get above my enemies and speed for home for i knew that no plane could follow me but to my dismay i saw that my way was again blocked this time by three planes and by their lights i saw others converging toward the battle area
and now with reckless daring the three planes bore down
to avoid them and gain a point of advantage i dropped downward only to find a large plane directly in my path and so close that i could not avoid striking it
as i accelerated my plunge and the steel point tore through the flimsy wings i was horrified to discover that it was the plane of the young airman and the goldenhaired girl
now as their plane pitched crazily and began to fall the young man his parachute on his back rose from the cockpit and prepared to leap motioning the girl to follow
but before he could leap flames swept back from the motor and enveloped him
the girl was struggling desperately with her safety belt
with the risk of being crippled by the falling plane i kept pace with it and kept drawing nearer
just as the flames reached her i leaned over with my knife and cut the stubborn belt
then i caught her beneath the arms and drew her aboard my own craft
through a pall of smoke and flame i caught a glimpse of the airman as he went over the side
by this time my enemies were pressing me close but having cleared the burning plane we dropped rapidly until we merely skimmed the earth
the police planes dared not follow
we darted between the trees fringing the golf links until the sky above was free from the enemy
then we soared toward the stars as though projected from the muzzle of a gun
back over the lawn the sky patrol was forming for the pursuit
as i had gained the desired altitude i forced the motors to their utmost and soon the lights of the pursuing planes drew dim wavered and were lost in the gloom
until the lights of the city had winked out in the darkness to rearward the girl maintained a stoical silence
she sat staring at me intently her blue eyes flaming with hate
you you monster she gasped at last
you have killed lieutenant price a brave man a man sorely needed by his country
pardon me i said cringing under her intense gaze tried to avoid striking your plane
you lie she cried
you are a murderer and a coward my eyes fell under her fierce stare
i would rather have died than be so accused by this girl
i realized bitterly that more than ever i was outside the laws pale plead guilty to being a coward i said contritely
but i am no murderer
and i earnestly desire to quit my lawless game
she smiled scornfully
where are we going she asked gazing about the cabin in wonder
why didnot you land me so that i could go home coward is not always a fool i laughed bitterly
from now until dawn all the searchlights in washington will be combing the sky for me
and for days the air will be thick with planes of the air patrol
and when they catch you you will die she asserted
no plane on earth is a match for mine i said confidently need not remind you that i am master of the air
she gazed at me with widening eyes which showed no trace of fear only wonder curiosity and loathing
you shall pay dearly for all of this she went on at last
my father
colonel brandon is a power in this land
your father
i said aghast
is colonel brandon your father
yes
he is chief of the first air squadron of the army have met him i said staring hard at her and wondering what imp of fate had led me to his mansion that fatal night
he is indeed a power but that power is often misplaced
misplaced believe that is the correct word
your father was a power in the governments rejection of this plane
we all feel that was a mistake
i am sorry but he did not know
exactly
pardon me but like many other dumbbells connected with our government he deems himself too wise to learn
why donot you land me she demanded imperiously know you can land anywhere at any time with this plane
it would be too risky
i donot want to subject you to unnecessary danger
so i have concluded that you are to become my guest for a few days
besides i rather like you
her eyes flared with indignation
you mean you will take me to your home she exclaimed incredulously
the police have long maintained that you have a secret haven
wise police i laughed
then in a few days you wrill take me home will
and in the meantime have no fear
i will treat you as a gentleman should gentleman she sneered
oh how i hate you hate you she finished
thank you
miss brandon
your interest is ciated
and when i return home i shall lead the air patrol back to your infamous lair
you will not
why
because it is not in your nature to betray a trust
i am trusting you not to betray me
her eyes fell and she compressed her lips
i saw that i was right
she was not ungrateful
but she refused to talk further
she sat staring disconsolately at the floor and i saw that she was having a hard battle to keep back the tears
war clouds
i due time we arrived at my rocky home
i made her as comfortable as possible and she did not complain
lon looked at me queerly a question in his great luminous eyes but as usual he held his peace and made no comment
the next morning after breakfast she showed keen interest in her surroundings asking numerous questions
i commanded her never to venture beyond the overhanging rock for fear some passing plane might discover her
lon and i never showed ourselves on the plateau in daylight and my constant dread was that some day some aviator might take a notion to land and explore this unique mountain top
thus two days passed
the scorn and the haughtiness had left miss eyes and she began to talk in that tone of relief one assumes when a dreaded danger fails to materialize
we were sitting on a rock out in the edge of the pines
the warm sunshine filtered through their branches where the birds were singing merrily maybe she said suddenly will be going home
perhaps miss brandon
but really there is no hurry
pray do not mock my misery she reproved
and please take me back home
i cannot remain away longer in times like these
father i know is frantic with anxiety
he needs me
any day he may be called to take command of his squadron
any day some unwise and fiery words may explode the magazine of war
war
i exclaimed incredulously you heard she cried in surprise
nations across the sea are lining up against us
we have granted every honorable concession but there seems to be no way of preventing war
word has come from reliable sources that already a large air armada is forming on the other side to swoop down upon our seaboard cities
my god
i cried getting to my feet and staring down at her expected it
and yet it seems unthinkable
the great war seemed unthinkable until it came she reminded me simply
had they listened to me i might have saved the day i said pointing to my plane housed under the rock
do you consider our situation hopeless she asked in alarm
it is desperate to say the least thanks to shortsighted officials among whom if you will pardon me is your father
our planes are woefully inferior in numbers and equipment
but we have some good ones and their pilots are skilful and brave
my father is an able commander
lieutenant price was like him noble and brave she added sadly
father had secured him a pilots berth in the first air squadron and his future was bright
her eyes filled with tears and she looked away that i might not see
forgive me miss brandon but i believe that lieutenant price was more to you than a friend
we were to be married in the spring she said blushing
i stood looking down at her a wild hope surging through me but i stifled it resolutely
what was i that i dared dream such things an air bandit who had sinned beyond pardon
tonight i will take you home i said with sudden resolution
oh thank you she said springing up and seizing my hands in a burst of gratitude am so glad
i shall speak for you to my father and and who knows you may yet get a chance to reform
you cannot be so awfully bad
i bowed my acknowledgment then turned away thankful for her gracious words
early that night just as the stars began to blazon the sky we made ready
for the second time lon asked to go along
during all the weary months since coming there he had not left that lonesome rock
so i could not refuse his request
we soared high so high that we shivered with the cold but i knew that the air police everywhere were on the lookout for me
but when we had obtained a position directly over colonel mansion we dropped straight down
no planes were in sight
the air was still
a solemn hush was brooding over the world
a calm whose very completeness chilled my heart seemed to be soothing it to sleep
perhaps my enemies were lurking in the shadows waiting for me
but i subdued this silly fear
they had no cause to expect me
they could only guess that i had rescued colonel daughter
anyway i was reckless of consequences so reckless that i shot the machine down upon the front lawn within a hundred yards of the house
as i helped the girl from the plane i saw two men seated under the porch lights leaning toward each other and apparently engaged in earnest conversation
one of the men wore the uniform of the air patrol and his head was swathed in bandages
the girl gave a gasping cry
thank god she murmured brokenly
and then i saw that it was lieutenant price
wait i said hoarsely when she made ready to hasten away
so perverse is human nature that i regretted price had been saved yet was glad for her sake
go to those men explain briefly and then come back and tell me whether war has been declared
she hesitated looking first at the men then at me
lon sat silently regarding us
go on i will take the risk i said
make some excuse but come back alone
i enlist i a fever of impatience and anxiety i waited
i watched her run up the steps saw her father and her lover rise hurriedly and embrace her
then for a few minutes i knew by her gestures that she was making an excited explanation
suddenly her father handed her a newspaper which she merely glanced at then she rushed down the steps and ran toward me
but in a moment she was followed by the lieutenant who by the aid of a cane came limping along shouting for her to come back
it has come she panted thrusting the paper into my hand
and there before me in great black headlines was the awful truth war had been declared
i had no time to learn more for lieutenant price was close upon us calling loudly for me to surrender
give her the gun lon i shouted as i leaped into the plane and pulled the ascending throttle watching the lieutenant over my shoulder as i did so
as the plane shot into the sky i looked down into his white upturned face and waved my hand in salute
we fooled them lon i said turning to him
but i stared aghast
i was alone
intent on watching the girl and the lieutenant i had forgotten lon
doubtless under one of his spells he had slipped from the machine unobserved
i could not go back for soon the air would be filled by planes of the air patrol
cursing my stupid folly in letting him get away i plunged still higher
dear old lon as faithful a friend as man ever had
it was to be years before i should see his face again when he was discovered under startling and remarkable circumstances by which his clouded mind was cleared and but that is another story
on the way home i read the whole terrible news
war had been forced upon our country and she was almost defenseless in the air and because of this alone the enemy had struck
our planes few in number and poorly armed were weak compared to the foes powerful bombers and fighters
our cities lay open and supine to a shower of fire and death from the sky
the day i had feared had come and i was helpless to do anything
if they had only listened to me how different would be the prospect a fleet of my master planes could repulse the combined air raiders of the world
reaching home i housed my machine and went to bed
but i could not sleep
lon and his uncertain fate and pictures of war in its horror of blood and carnage rose before me
after tossing about for an hour i rose dressed and went out under the stars
dawn was tinging the east and in its pink depths my imagination pictured black swarms of enemy planes winging their way over the sea to crush us
and in dismay i imagined our puny aerial fleet trying to stop them
in frenzied fancy i saw the death of many brave men saw the slaughter of women and children cowering in their homes while their roofs blazed with fire
for a time i was overcome with horror despair and remorse
if i had only been more patient i might have won out under the law and now in this crisis i might be useful
i might have saved the day
the thought drove me mad
i swept the starry heavens as though i would challenge and defy the universe
i burned with a sudden resolve
i would save the day
i would make good my claim
for was not i master of the air
i would meet them and fight until overwhelmed
i would redeem myself
afire with my mad resolution i began my preparations at once
i filled my atoline tanks and went over the motors carefully
that evening as the sun set in a crimson sky i rose into the air
lonely as this rocky home had been i gazed back on it with a pang of regret
it had sheltered lon and me
it had seemed to appreciate me
it had been kind
i knew that i would never see it again
before i had been in the air an hour the full moon was bathing the earth in a soft glow
the night was still
i seemed to be afloat in space
all about me was peace
it was hard for me to realize that i was bent on an errand of destruction that brother humans in madness and hate would soon be seeking my life
but at last when i soared above the streets of all was changed
the streets were teeming with milling masses of men women and children whose cries and shouts rose to me in a hoarse murmur of fear
i dropped lower over the avenues even entered some of them dropping as low as the secondstory windows
here i heard the newsboys shrilly proclaim the dire news that already boston had been bombed its public buildings destroyed thousands made homeless and that the city had been surrendered to the enemy
i also learned that the enemy was mustering his planes to move on new york
colonel brandon with the first air squadron supplemented by many private planes had gone out to meet the foe
somewhere above hills he grimly awaited the enemy
battle at last
i was enough
i waited at hear no more
amid the excited cries of the people who pointed at my machine and waved their arm excitedly i shot upward far above the tallest buildings and set my course to the northeast
in less than an hour i came upon the fleet of defense
back and forth the planes moved in battle formation
i moved among them drawing their excited attention but i was received as a friend
doubtless colonel brandon had recognized me and had radioed that although i was an outlaw i was an american and was to be let alone
i was mighty thankful for had i been attacked it would have disorganized my plans
for an hour i flew among them with no enemy in sight
at last impatient at the delay i flew to an altitude of ten thousand feet then sped east
in ten minutes i saw them coming flying rather low but in splendid order
they formed a mighty array the whole heavens to the east seemed to be filled with them a veritable cloud of death
the roar of their motors blended in a dreadful dirge which to my overwrought senses sounded like the voice of doom
flushed with victory conscious of their prestige confident of success they came swiftly on with gleaming lights disdaining concealment or surprise
i looked to the west
our planes had sighted them
they were coming on boldly but with no lights coming on like lambs to the slaughter
i had never prayed
i knew nothing about god or heaven but then and there i stumbled through an agonized plea for my countrymen
earnestly i asked the ruler of the universe to help them
i waited until the main body of the enemy was directly under me
leading the van i picked out a giant plane
this i recognized by its position as the flagship of the fleet doubtless the ship of itso the noted oriental ace and the chief of the fleet
my time had come the hour for which i had yearned with all my heart and soul the opportunity to demonstrate in battle the superior merits of my invention in defense of my country
i was athrill with a mad joy
i was about to die
peace and contentment were to be mine at last
such a death i would welcome
with awful swiftness i approached the flagship
the roar of the motors below was deafening the colored lights of so many aircraft bewildering but i allowed nothing to detract me from my aim
straight in its center i cut through the upper wing then as i turned back tore it completely off
the great plane staggered as i backed away
then plunging forward like a mighty battering ram i struck the lower wing and cut it in twain
the plane swung out of control
its pilots strove mightily to right it while their companions emptied their automatics at me
however in a moment the plane lurched then dove straight down
for a fleeting instant as the other planes roared past i caught a glimpse of the once noble ship reeling drunkenly toward the earth
halted by this sudden calamity and for a few minutes confused the enemy paused swung back and came after me furiously
one appeared directly over me but even as its gunners trained their machine guns i shot up through their wings ripped them away and sent them lurching down to join their commander
as the others tried to close in i backed away thus confusing them
then i zoomed above them
three of their speediest planes followed
i led them on until they were beyond supporting distance of their comrades then i charged them one at a time
darting here and there i cut them to pieces and sent them down whirling masses of wreckage
i dropped down once more then drew off as half a dozen planes attempted to charge me
again i retreated their machinegun bullets rattling off my armor liarmlessly
once more i turned suddenly rammed them retreated struck them top and bottom confused them by my sudden and unexpected maneuvers until all were sent crashing down
far below the enemy was reforming
planes were circling here and there getting into position again
by their flashing lights and the light of the moon i saw another large plane take position at the head of the squadron
i got above it
like some black monster from the world of darkness i dropped swiftly noiseless as a phantom
before they were aware of my presence i struck the plane a terrible blow
it reeled and before it could recover i struck it again and again while its companions tried to get into position to protect it
at last it plunged down and i again drew off
this time nearly the whole fleet seemed bent on following me
i saw that they were becoming demoralized by my swift and peculiar onslaughts
again i led them a merry race
they could not overtake me
they could not get above me
tliey could not anticipate my moves or guard against my attacks
only when i enticed one or two away from their fellows i struck
they fought bravely stubbornly but they had no chance
the terrible steel spikes gored them like the horn of an angry bull
with bewildering speed and uncanny aim i rose against them fell upon them turned in small circles and tore off their wings
my movements were so swift and unexpected and the evolutions of their planes so awkward and slow that i had them at my mercy
glancing down exultingly i saw that the ground was becoming littered with the wreck of the enemy
i was drunk with the spirit of battle
working my stick with reckless ferocity i yelled at my foes taunted them led them on and dared them to come and take me
but of course the general tumult the roar of the motors and the crash of impact the sputter of machine guns and the rending and splintering of the wings prevented my voice reaching them
but it didnot matter
i was slaying my countrys foes
their whole fleet was bent on my destruction but they could not reach me
give me a little more time and i would have them all
surely i was master of the air
but i realized that soon i must die
death grinned at me from every side but i laughed in his grisly face
but the planes came on and oh
my very victories were weakening me
i could not long stand the mad pace
soon i must be crushed by weight of numbers and sent crashing down to my doom
the air terror hen suddenly the planes began to draw off
they paid no attention to me and looking below i saw the cause
the enemy lights were wigwagging frantically
they were reforming and i understo that my attackers had been radioed to get back in the line
off to the east was the poignant reason the american fleet was nearing the scene
soon they were engaged in a desperate battle
i saw the lights on the planes dip up and down charge and retreat and spin in dizzy circles
my countrymen were fighting with a skill and daring worthy the traditions of the american ace but they were hopelessly outnumbered and i realized the bitter outcome of the struggle
for a few minutes i sat gazing at the spectacle fascinated by the play of the planes darting about like grotesque ghosts in the shimmering moonbeams
the roar of the mighty conflict rose to me on the wind sounding like distant surf pounding on the shore
every little while i would see a burning ship go whirling down to earth
i was witnessing the first real air battle of history
and here america who cradled the airplane must go down in bitter defeat
the thought set me on fire
the last remnant of my reason fled and i became mad
i would kill kill kill
and in my rage i would be content to give up my life
i know little of what took place during the remainder of that historic fight
it comes to me in hazy fragments as i write and but for the notes taken at the time by friends i could not tell my story
i only know that i seemed to be in the center of a revolving seething blistering hell screaming my challenge ramming retreating surging forward ascending descending sending our foes crashing to earth asking no quarter and giving none
suddenly i realized that more than twothirds of the american planes were down and over half of the enemy
the latter now drew off reformed and then came tearing back against the american line
colonel plane was still intact
i recognized it by the painted stars and stripes
i knew that likely lieutenant price held the controls
even as this thought surged through my brain i saw the lieutenants bandaged head peep a moment from a window
now the battle was on once more in all its fury
i saw with dismay that the enemy was concentrating his attack on the plane
by adroit maneuvering they were seeking to separate him from his squadron
dipping and banking and zooming upward then looping back again he was striving to escape their net
by this time my plane was badly battered by bullets
some of the gas chambers had been penetrated and emptied of their contents
the frame was bent and twisted by its terrific encounters my forward propeller was out of commission and my ataline was running low
i realized that this would be my last attack
here in the midst of it all i hoped to meet my end
my onslaught was as terrible as it was sudden
in a few minutes i had disposed of three of the planes
earthward they plunged in spirals of writhing fire illuminating the ground with a ghastly glow
now however a chance shot broke my rear propeller
i could only rise above and hurl myself down on our foes
it was then that three more planes closed in on the colonel and his heroic pilot
they were below me
like a thunderbolt i hurled myself down on one of the planes crashing clear through its wings
as it fell i swung up against the wings of another shearing them off close to the cabin
but even with these victories i saw that the odds were too great for us
the remaining plane was getting the best of the colonel and others were coming to its aid
in desperation i dove down on this plane with all the power of my motors
the impact was terrific
i broke the plane almost in two
its wings crumpled and flames leaped from its motor
as it plunged i had difficulty lifting my plane free from the wreckage
as i did so i accidentally struck the plane which badly crippled was slowly falling
in vain i tried to extricate myself from his landing gear but i was wedged in tightly and the crippling of both forward and rear propellers prevented my withdrawing horizontally
faster and faster we fell the tremendous weight of the flagship pressing upon and carrying me along with it
in the last desperate grapple with the enemy we had lost altitude so that now only a few hundred feet separated us from the earth
we seemed to be ages in falling
i knew that it was all over with me and was glad for it would settle my problem
and then the grinding rending shock the poignant pain the flashing lights and bloodred mist that was swallowed up in darkness
i revived in a hospital
the nurse said that i had been there six weeks
it seems they had taken me from the wrecke of the planes a mass of broken bones and lacerations but the surgeons had patched me up pretty well though they said that i would never walk again
the nurse informed me that colonel brandon and lieutenant price the shock broken by my plane had escaped with minor cuts and bruises
with this meager information i had to be content for the nurse gave me a sleeping powder
but the next day colonel brandon and the young lieutenant accompanied by miss brandon carrying a huge bunch of roses came to visit me
the colonel took my good hand in both his own and gazed down on my patched face compassionately
you won old man he said at last
the enemy has left our shores and the war is over
pray accept my apologies
war has left our shores i said unable to believe my senses
yes after your last spectacular attack the enemy became discouraged and withdrew toward boston
our forces reenforced by the second squadron and private planes followed and won a sweeping victory
your priceless plane was salvaged and copied
uncle sam will settle with you for that
working night and day in many factories we are turning them out by the hundred
so that with them we are sure to win the war if they ever attack us again am glad i said fervently
but it all matters little to an outlaw i added sadly
the colonel laughed
he turned to lieutenant price
lieutenant what chance for a pardon do you think an outlaw has who has saved his country
we might envy mr clare the reception that awaits him smiled the lieutenant
he deserves it added miss brandon smiling at me and arranging in a vase the roses she had brought
and so my tale comes to an end
how the war was won is history now
i am proud that i had a humble part in the victory
and i am happy to add that my pardon was complete
i am content now happy as i go about the factory in my wheel chair looking after the construction of my beloved planes

as far as space will permit all questions deemed should be brief and not more than three should be put in any letter of general interest to our readers will be answered bei and where address all communications to the editor
something about fuselage covering editor axnation forum your announcement of the beginning of a questions and answers department for aviation struck a responsive chord in me know it will be very welcome to your readers
however i would be careful to limit the kind of questions to be answered
many people have peculiar ideas about what to a and their questions are of no earthly interest to any but themselves
if my question falls under that scope please do not take up your valuable space with it
what is the usual covering for the fuselage of a plane
what are its advantages
what is meant by streamlining the fuselage
why is it done
birmingham ala
fuselage frames are covered in order to reduce the air friction over them
plywood or dural sheets are generally used sometimes both if the covering is merely to contribute to the reduction of resistance
there are a number of doped fabrics which still further reduce resistance of air over the fuselage
the use of lubricating oil has also been suggested and tried out
by streamlining is meant the shaping of the fuselage or any other part for that matter so as to xuce its air friction to the minimum
certain shapes in posing through the air have a much siller friction than others just as a narrow wellshaped prow of a boat have less friction through the water than one with blunt prow
editor what is retractible landing gear
editor aviotion forum would you please tell me through the columns of your aviation forum department what the meaning of the retractible landing gear is
also what is its purpose or purposes if there are more than one
montreal onada
the retractible landing gears are the wheels which can be lifted into a recess in the lower part of the plane provided for it when the plane is in ffight
the purpose is to reduce the resistance of the wheels through the air
this by the way follows the flight of birds who draw their legs close to their bodies while in flight
of course on amphibian planes which are designed to land cither on sea or water the wheels are drawn up so that they will not be immersed in the water while the plane is floating on its pontoons hdfior
what limits speed
editor aviation forum hugo gernsback is still on the job finding out what pple want before they know they want it
the aviation forum idea is certainly a good one and i know it will go over big with your readers
our magazine certainly looks like a worldbeater
could you tell me through your columns what it is that really limits the spe of a plane
is it something in the air conditions or something naturally limiting in the airplane idea
why canot tremendous speeds be developed
albany
as a roan writing about interplanetary travel said nothing but a case of brute the same thing may be applied to the speeds of airplanes
given a power plant with suflicient horsepower speeds far beyond anything we have reached are possible
what limits our planes now is just this
accompanying the increase of spe of a plane there an increase of air resistance
but the air resistance increases with tho square of the speed and therefore the power necessary to send the plane through the air roust increase with the square of the speed
therefore if the speed is doubled the power necessary must be multi plied by four
multiplying a speed by three means a powr plant nine times as powerful
therefore with power plants limited to the sizes they are and the power plants are often governed by other structural details of the plane the speeds are correspondingly what are relative editor aviation forum relative to your new department on questions and answers on aviation i would like to know what the relative weights of the various parts of an average airplane are
in otheer words how much does each part contribute to the total weight what percentage of the total weight is dead weight and how much is load
i think that the forum idea is a very good one and i know it meets with my own personal approval
i weights of parts simply canot learn enough about aviation

aviation forum will you please explain or indicate if you can through your aviation fomm just bow a plane gets its socalled lift i nave been trying to puzzle it out mysdf and have been unable to
jnst what forces are acting on a plane to keep it aloft
detroit mich
as indicated in the diagram a plane is kept in the air by the pressure of air under its wings due to the spe of the plane
the shape of the wings or aerofoils as they are called are such that the air pressure piles up under the wings and causes an area of reduced pressure above the wings
thus the difference of pressure on the two sides of the wings causes an upward thrust on the wings to balance the weight of the plane

note the nature of the lifting force

what determines minimum flying speed
editor aviation forum i was very glad to bear that you have established a department to answer questions on aviation
such a department should make a valuable addition to a magazine which already i think is taking its place among the front rank of periodicals devoted to aviation
what i should like to know is what determines the minimum flying speed of a plane
is it the same for all planesf qeveland ohio
the minimum flying speed of a plane is determined by the necessary to develop a pressure under the wings and a vacuum on top of them to maintain the weight of the plane
each factor in the problem is dependant on others
that is given a certain area of wing surface and a certain weight of plane the amount of upward lift per unit area on the wing surface multiplied by the area of the wing must equal the weight of the plane
therefore the minimum flying speed is that necessary to give the necessary wing lift mr square inch or square foot
naturally a light plane with a large wing area will need a rouen smaller minimum of flying speed than a heavy plane with a small wing area

what kinds of tractive effort are there
editor avition forum what are the kind of tractive effort that can be given to a plane
this is my question to start off the works of aviation forum
although some may object to having some nonfiction material in a fiction magazine yet if the fiction is scientific and is designed to instruct as well as entertain how can the reader be pleased if not through acauainting him with the meaning of the things toat are spoken of in the stories
i would appreciate an answer to my question in an early issue
boston mass
the two general types of traction given to a plane are called tractor and pusher
in the first the propeller which by its rotation provides the tractive power cuts the air and by a screw motion ils the plane through the air
the propeller in this case is in front of the plane
the pusher propeller is in back of the plane and by its action shes the plane through the air
of course there is a third type which is being experimented on and promises well and that is the rocket type
by the rapid expulsion of highly compress gases into the air with a tremendous force the reaction of the force tin an opposite direction to it propels the plane

continued on page auxiliary wing to prevent stalling a new device to prevent stalling is found in the new fernic distance cruiser a monoplane which will be put through its tests shortly
the method of preventing stalling very commonsense is the use of an auxiliary wing just over the nose of the plane
there is so an additional landingwheel under the nose which will prevent a noseover when the plane lands
the plane has a wingspread of sixty feet and is equipped with wright whirlwind motors
it is expected to make a nonstop flight to some european field this summer
german invents 650mile an hour plane i an interview with the new york times herr perl a twentyone year old german described a new plane a flying fish with which be expects to fly at an altitude of feet at speeas reaching miles per hour this basis he believes he can fly to new york from berlin in hours at a fuel cost of only the plane which is feet long and weighs pounds ba one horsepower motor
the plane is hermetically sealed and a constant pressure is maintained within the cabin
the wings are shaped like those of a flying flsh with small stabilizing fins on the tail
the plane will not only be able to fly but also to swim for the landing wheel etc will be drawn into the body thus presenting a fishlike shell to the water
according to wythe williams of the times einstein as well as count arco president dt the telefunken company builders of great radio stations as well as prominent professors have expressed the belief that perl has a plane which can reach the high altitude necessary to obtain such great speeds
new propeller to double speed a nother revolutionary invention is that of kalmanson of brooklyn who claims according to the new york world to have invented a propeller which will not only double the speed of a plane but bring a marked saving in fuel
the propeller comes in two parts which may be used singly in front and in back of the plane or both together
it consists of four airspoons two on each blade
the front two bring the air to the other two giving the propellers a greater tractive effect on the air
the inventor also claims that the plane cannot go into an involuntary nose dive with bis device and that it can make a landing within a short distance
new singlelanding wheel amphibian developed a new plane with a single landing wheel that allows the plane to ride on land like a bicycle and yet land on and take off from the water has been developed and successfully tested by the grover loening company
the landing gear can be guickly lifted or lowered according to whether it is wished to alight on land or on water
the wheel draws into a little pocket in the main float which is seventeen feet long and thirty inches wide
a small door opens and closes to receive the wheel or let it out
a lever in the cockpit operates the wheel
the additional weight on the plane is about pounds moth plane being used by the company equipped with cirrus mark motors and a reduction in speed of only miles an hour is occasioned
new giant plane ready soon he worlds largest plane which is being constructed by dornier in germany will be ready within two months according to a wireless to the new york times
it will have twelve horsepower motors and will carry passengers
its speed will be miles per hour
the length of the plane will be about feet and its wing span feet
the useful load will be tons and the dead weight tons
the motors will be in pairs on the upper side of the wings
phis will permit repairs during a flight
the plane is constructed of duralumin
liberty motor yields to scientific advance he liberty motor the pride of the american air force during the world war at last yields to the development of motors cceiling it and no longer is used in the first line air force according to a new york times despatch
these motors which were the result of the pooling of all patents during the war have served their usefulness as the recent army maneuvers in ohio proved them to be miles an hour slower than the new pratt and whitney motored bombers
the liberty motored planes win be relegated to the army repair base at middletown pa where they will be used in training student pilots
scientist studies bird flight elieving that many of the secrets of airplane design will come from a study of the navigation of birds
dr austin clark of the smithsonian institution has written a very interesting paper on bird flight according to the new york world
the fact is well known he says that large birds have small wings while small birds have large ones and must move them more quickly to maintain their flight
upward air currents and momentum arc what maintain the larger birds
the large birds however have more difficulty than the smaller in getting started and need more open spaces
soaring on the part of birds is possible only when the sun is shining so that warm air is rising and they can take advantage of upward air currents
they are thus forced to soar in circles to keep within this column of air
foolproof plane contest nears close he contest for the best foolproof plane which the average man or woman can fly nsored by the guggenheim fund for the promotion of aeronautics is nearing a close says lauren lyman in the new york times
very few known planes have already been entered in the contest which will award prizes of and a great deal of mystery surrounds the actual plans of airplane makers
believing that the average man or woman will not y until the foolproof plane has been developed one which does not need any aeronautical expert to safely pilot the guggenheim fund is making the conditions that planes must fulfill rather exacting
for example one of the nine conditions states that the aircraft must show its ability to takeoff or land on a plot feet square surrounded by a twentyfive foot obstruction although the date set for the close of the contest is october only one plane had actually submitted itself at mitchel field long island for thete
thi is a brunncrwinkle biplane built brooklyn several other entries are definitely known but only the one plane has reached the tests stage
invents gravity conquering plane of england claims to have patented a plane which will be free from the influence of gravity and will be able to fly miles per hour
taking advantage of the theories of einstein and sir thomson about the nature of gravitation he has constructed on paper his machine to rise or descend vertically
ho will control the magnetism which is the same as gravity according to the einstein principle by the use of electricity
he will thus enable jwple to travel from the united states to europe in five hours
we are most skeptical about the truth of the above despatch

monster british airship acme of comfort the finishing touches being made on the monster british airship those who have been allowed to inspect it declare it to be as luxurious as any firstclass hotel according to a cable to the new york times
the giant dirigible is feet long and will have cubic feet of hydrogen
it has a dining saloon for persons a main lounge feet by on each side of the lounge is a sevenfoot wide veranda with hand rails
comfortable settees club chairs and lounges will allow the passengers to relax while large windows will allow the views of the scenery below and will permit plenty of sunlight to enter
the exact date of the completion is still unknown
multimotors do not always prevent accidents hat the ability of a multimotored plane to prevent the accident due to stalling of one motor is overrated is the belief of reginald cleveland in the new york times
ho cites the case of a recent imperial airways plane falling into the english
channel despite the fact that it was multimotored
the essential point is he says that if one motor or two motors fail the rest must be able to give the plane its minimum flying speed and maneuverability
this is being taken care of in many new planes where horsepower capacity is being taken care of by and horsepower in motors
further passenger planes are not being loaded to the limit of their capacity thus increasing further the margin of safety
awarded damages on device navy used he history of a typical attempt to dispose of a revolutionary invention came to light when rear admiral bradley fiske retired was awarded damages of from rear admiral william moffett chief of the bureau of naval aeronautics on his invention of the torpedo plane which the navy has been using
in said admiral fiske to the new york times he foresaw the value of the plane and suggested the dropping of torpedoes from them
the navy department he clairns laughed at his idea and finally he developed it himself
he found that the idea was practicable the only thing necessary was to devise a means of steering the torpedo once released
this was worked out successfully but still the navy it was said refused to accept it
fiske found later however that the navy was using his device
in the air terror in this issue mr morrow has pictured a case so similar that it seems prophetic

flying boats will mark future trans atlantic flights hat the recent attempts of flyers in seaplanes to fly between spain and america have proved the worthiness of the flying boat is the belief of allen writing the new york world the case of ramon franco who waa lost in the azores for ten days and rescued with his machine almost as good as new is mentioned as one of the strongest arguments for the plane able to alight on the water
the future flight by plane will be in the opinion of mr allen a seaplane making stops at the azores and possibly newfoundland equipped fully with navigators and radio and possessing adequate weather information although the singlemotored land plane will still mark the flights that are done for gloiy and publicity the substantial flights for commercial aviation will be in planes equipped for the water
flying by radio beacons to be tested i a series of tests to be conducted at mitchel field island an attempt will be made to determine the real value of the radio beacon as a means of guiding a pilot oyer his course
in the tests which are to be conducted by the guggenheim foundation lieut
james doolittle an army flier will fly blind unable to seo his course from his cockpit
he will guided only by little lamps set in front of him
the radio beams sent out will cause certain lights to glow if he is off his course on cither side and another to glow if he is on his course
a request is being made to the federal radio commission for a wave of meters kilocycles on which to conduct the tests
fliers who use the radio beacon system are now guided by dots and dashes received audibly through headphones
by the new idea it is faop to do away with them and have only visual signals
germans plan trans atlantic service for the inauguration of regular plane service between germany and brazil at first and later between
germany and the united states is the program of lufthansa the great german air company
limited by the short distances to be covered in central europe the company is looking toward the service as the logical development of their passenger service
spain to be the point of departure from europe with brazil as the south american terminus
trial trips with three rohrhackroraar flying boats are to begin shortly
the zeppelin interests however are still trying to establish a definite service
in addition to the zeppelin they are building a flying boat to be equipped with twelve motors
when the service is started satisfactorily the lufthansa hopes to inaugurate a far eastern line going to shanghai on the one hand and through siberia on the other
gliding now becoming an art liding is no longer a matter of jumping from a hillside holding onto a pair of wings and waiting until the initial cnorgy is dissipated before one descends to earth but has oecotne a new art of taking advantage of air currents says major ernst in the zeitung leipzig
from the first crude efforts of men to remain aloft in a plane without a motor has come a sport which in germany at least has allowed flights of eight hours
propelled by a catapult from the top ef a hill in the static flight which was the first flight tried the glider would float down the hillside until it naturally descended to the ground
but in the dynamic flight the pilot with an uncanny sense for air currents will face into those currents and have them keep him aloft for many hours
it has been found that air currents are found flowing up a hillside
if the wind is light it will balance the glider on the way down
stronger winds will actually lift it giving it a higher altitude than it started with dynamic effect of various types of countrysides are being exploited and a large body of knowledge is being built up about their effects on the glider
furthermore the construction of the glider is being studied in to determine how to reduce weight and give it a greater lifting power
autogiro performs new feats says report a from the headquarter of senor juan dc la cierva inventor of the autogiro states that he has improved his machine
at a recent test near madrid he is said to have flown vertically to a height of meters about feet despite a strong headwind remained motionless in the air for a minute and then descended vertically with the motor shut off his chosen spot
two more ship lines plan plane service ollowing the announcement that the united states lines is contemplating a shiptoshore plane service to cut the time for mail by almost a day there comes the plan of the french line and the north carman lloyd line to attempt a similar service if suitable planes can be found
the bremen the newest ship of the german line would have a plane meet it six hundred miles at sea and pick up mail and possibly passengers
if this were done also at the european terminus the water trip would be cut down by onethird last year an attempt was made by the french line to use a plane service for the lie de france but the proper plane was not available
news of the month portrays in plain yet concise language every important aviation advance during the month
nowhere can the average reader get such a wealth of accurate and vital information condensed into such a small volume
some aviation magazines and newspapers are utilized by our editors in the compilation of this department
the publishers welcome short contributions to these pages from the various scientific institutions laboratories makers and distributors of planes etc flying laws for intrastate flying believed near ue to the complexity of the legal situation regarding licenses for pilots and planes not engaged in interstate flying and therefore not subject to federal regulation the making of state laws is believed near
under the federal laws all pilots and plane flying across state lines must obtain federal licenses and submit to federal inspection of planes
flyers engaged in only one state however have the privilege of obtaining federal licenses if they wish to obtain the certificates
there arc left therefore intrastate flyers who do not take the federal licenses or any other
a state law requiring all flyers to have federal licenses is one way out of the dilemma while the setting up of me state requirements equivalent to the federal is another
planes wait for overdue trains a ccording to reports of newspapermen invited to make the trial trips over the lindbergh line airrail route from los angeles to new york it was the trains that provided the irregularity in schedules bolding up the planes on one occasion for an hour and a half
the route which is miles long has miles of airway and miles to be covert by rail
but despite this the planes have been uniformly on time while traii principally over the santa fe railroad which goes between oklahoma and new mexico have provid a good deal of irregularity
a correspondent however writing in the new york world believes that when winter comes the situation will be reversed and the trainmen may then vent their ire on the pilots forced to buck fog snow and sleet
siberia within five days of new york he possibility of reaching the old world by way of alaska and siberia was proved recently when a piano made a commercial voyage between fairbanks alask and cape north siberia said lauren lyman in the new york times
the trip of miles both ways was made by noel wien of the wien alaskan airways to bring supplies to an isolated trading post and to bring back a load of furs valued at the time taken for the trip plus the record made of a trip from new york to nome of four and a half days placed the siberian post within five days of new york crash not always a crash hat some of the undesirable publicity given aviation mishaps is caused by the mdiscriminate use of the word crash in the newspapers is the opinion of the boston herald
a crash occurs only when the plane comes down out of control in which case serious injury can result to the occurants
but many socalled crashes in which minor injuries occur are only forced landings
these says the paper are on a par with an automobile running onto a curb and should be given no more publicity
mentioning the comparative safety of aviation the paper names harry jones of old orchard maine who has carried passengers in years without a mishap to any
houses insured against airplane crashes the crashing of an airplane on the summer home of the governor of new jersey recently there has come a demand for insurance by home owners against similar occurrences
for with the growth ef air traffic there will come a corresponding increase in the chance of having an airplane suddenly descend on one
the mayflower fire and marine insurance company is meeting this demand by issuing policies on homes
plane makes successful pickup at sea he first successful pickup and dropping of mail between a plane and a liner at sea was made when a fairchild monoplane using the adams pickup apparatus droppra a bag of mail on the deck of the leviathan and picked up a bag from the liner without stopping
tke liner bad left its pier bound for europe at p ro
at about six oclock the plane left keyport and a half hour later nad overtaken the liner
the plane dropped its bag of mail but in the first attempt to make a pickup it failed
maneuvering back and forth the plane let down a ball at the end of a cable which is to catch in a groove and hold the mailbag
it caught it this time and simultanrausly a catapult threw the mailbag forward in the direction of the planes travel so as to reduce the jerk on the dag
a second attempt will be made on the next return trip of the leviathan this time when the ship is still miles at sea
lights and sounds indicate altitude on planes a recent development of dr alexanderson of the general electric company pilots can new have a positive indication of their heit above the ground even though the weather may be so bad that they cannot see the ground
the device consists of sending a radio impulse to the gnund from the plane and picking up the same impulse after it is reflected from the ground back to tbc plane
the sound is picked up as a squeal
whenever the airple changes altitude by half a wavelength a whistling note goes through a complete tone cycle
by counting the cycles of the tone it is possible to measure the altitude
a meter reading from to feet rives the pilot an opportunity to know accurately his altitude within those limits
as the plane approaches the ground the echoes become stronger
a memory reader is connected with the meter by which the meter continues to hold the altitude reading and give off the same echo until the alritude is changed
connected with the device in a manner not explained are colored lights freen light flashing on indicates that tbc pilot is feet above the ground while a yellow indicates feet and a light shows an altitude of feet

after all this is your magazine and it is edited for ou
if we fall down on the choice of our stories or if the editorial board kps up occasionally it is up to you to voice your opinion

all of your letters as much as space will allow will be published here for the bent of all
due to the large influx of mail no communications to this department are answered individually unless 25c in stamps to cover time and postage is remitted
a pilot speaks his mind erftter hark mr editor man to the squawks squks and squeals of a ptleit for a couple of years more or less foltowed your editorial endeavors with great satisfaction
when saw a notice to the effect that you were te edit an air stoiw affair however became convinced that youd slippea a cog at last
well foxy old rascal that you arc what did you do but leave flying alone and stick to your own sphere
futuristic you are and will always be and wise enough to know it tool with a copy of your first air wonder stories before me i can find only the following fallacies in your aviation news department you peak of a helicopter and explain that it is a airplane in the first jdace the helicopter is no airplane at all merely another type of aircraft
in the second place its lift is derived from rotation of a set of two or more airfoils in the manner of a propeller with vertical thrust might say here that the helicopter is much farther from true birdlike flight than the airplane loasmuch as the latter does soar while the former docs not
the trulv birdlike craft is known as tbc qmitbopter derivinir both lift and propulsion in the horizontal ane by upping its wings
the objection is of course the movements necessary in those members donot recall an instance of any omithopters success
the belicopter has however been built and flown experimentally though i cannot believe in its commercial practicability because motor failure must certainly result in a bad crash there being no wings to allow it to glide down in safety
in the same department you have an article headed tail spin causes most crashes i am not really sure but believe that this should be most feiel crashes had three friends cash in so far two in spins or the beginning of them and one otherwise also one to in and write off a ship without serious physical injury
cn the other hand in the thirty days akme
the three above cover two years or more none in this thirtyday lve known six ships to crash bemuse of motor trouble alone
th however did not result in any injury to passengers or pilots in any way save of the old horsebide pocketbook
the losses there ran from forty per cent of the planes value to one complete washout
same department heading safety slot keeps planes stabilized
so far so good
but when you call it a safety device from the standpoint of stability i want discussion
what ir a stall
a ship is 8talled when the wings no longer take sufficient effect to hold the ship in the air and the controls donot nt enough traction so to speak to bold her steady and a very disagreeable sensation it is i assure you especially when one is close to the real estate
now at this point the slotted wing takes effect
like a guardian angel so its exponents tell us it rises from its position in the leading edge due to lowering of pressure on it and pours a smooth stream ox air over the foil
this aiin seals the partial vacuum on the top of the airfoil where about per oent of the lift occurs and also on the ailerons
but what of the tailgroup the conbrols that save the bacon
they my friend must grow very loose and flabby
and when the speed gets too low for the slot what
if the ship flics okay how is your inexperienced pilot that this slot was to save to know when ne8 in trouble donot know but i imagine that when one of these soupedup ships spins it must be a mansized job to get going again
this of course being due to lack of extra pressure on the rudder which is about the only thing that helps when she goes to winding np
incidentally i believe in the slotted wing becanse of the safety it gives when one must land in a cottonpatch about the size of bis ship plus ten fret
if the above objections can be answered aimreciate some experts doing so
unlike most pilots of my class did not fly in the war and i donot know all there is to the business
in fact i freely admit that i have only something over eighty hours and have recently flunked a limited commercial flight test reliable information on the slotted wing is not very plentiful just now and certainly am not broken out with it enjoyed islands in the air by mr morrow very much but canot really see the advantage of those same islands
personally always had a mania for nice solid air to land in
our colonel lindbergh had him a lovely time not so long ago at mexico city or that vicinity on this account
he lost a wheel in taking off
now here in sunny texas altitude at dallas feet his job would have landed at some or miles per hour
my says a little of bis dexterous manipulation probably a judiciously timed ground loop would have put her down without further damage
but at about feet tkot is another stool my guess is that be came in at about or maybe even more
result nobody was hurt much due to bis usual coolness and attention to detail but he didnot fly that ship again soon
all of which somewhat beside the question
the idea is though that the good effect of the slotted wing mentioned above would just about be nullified by the necessity of landing at an altitude of a few thousand feet
but to have done with my hairsplitting and et ceteras i want to say that to my mind your new magazine is a grand success
it doesnot aspire to tell of the brave deeds and dauntless courage rarely done or possessed by the present day nut twisters and jcnnjrherders like myself usually roaktni itself ridiculous and bolstering weak plots with weaker side issues that give us a name like traveling salesmen but goes into the future giving us some mighty fine reading and who knows how many bright ideas
keep up the good work an donot mind ray kicking a little
i kick mv chum regularly once a week and tell him hes a bounder a bum a cad a derelict on the sea of life and no earthly use to anyone
i think he gets mad at me and takes it out on his woik not speaking of any one toi in the way of praise because the blamed things are too good for me ta say which i like bestl hangar no

we are very glad to get such a critical and wellthought out letter from an experienced pilot
getting the aviation news from the various papers and journals devoted to the art we do not question the technical efficienev oi the devices written about
rather we allow as in this case our readers to state their opinions on them
regarding the safety slot we believe that the company frankly admitted that the use of it reduced somewoat the pilots ability to maneuver the plane
but the british government thought so well of it that they bought it for no less than anyway we found mr letter a very interesting one and invite him to send us another when the mood strikes him
however there may be some pilots among our readers who do not agree with mr greding
our columns arc open to them editor
likes the whole blame magazine editor having been an ardent reader of sciencb wonder stories when the latters sister magazine
air wonder stories was announced i awaited its advent with a good deal of pleasure
seeing it on the newsstands i purchased it and it comes in all ways up to my expectations
it is much like its sister magazine
i liked the cover
i did not have to refer to the table of contents to see what the story was that it illustrated
the symbol of a propeller was also very appropriate
and there is no one hke hugo
jernsback to write interesting editorials and now for the stories bad read the ark of the covenant before and have fried to reread it but had not succeeded until it appeared in air wonder stories
it is a darn good story
islands in the air was also good
the cover design made me suspect that it was a lot of technical bunk but it wasnot
the beacon of airport ven bad me all mixed up and i still donot know why the wherefore was which
however it was told in an excrilent manner
i like the bloodless war naturally as it was by keller
men with wings was splendid
all hail to les stone
by the zoay turn old is hef he didn look verv old in the riioto going to send for those six scientiflctionen as as possible
i like the idea of a science library
in fact
i have one already
war the air heads publish it soon
the aviation news was too technical for me bot liked being there even though i didnot read it
and thats about all
i like the cover like the binding the paper conld be better i like the whole blame magazine
and i want to say if you donot stop putting out so many magazines go bankrupt for i always toy them homnir thou i yonra for bigger and better air wonder san francisco
the editor has a complaint
mr kuttneria letter is another one of thone whh nothing but praise for air wonder storizs
the readers has better beware
them io nothing jaore fatal to the editorial cranaum than an excessive swelling induced by a surfeit of praise
leslie stone author of men with wings we wish to state js not a he but a she
and inasmuch as he is a young and comely she mr error the point in the beacon of airport seven was that the professor had bt the light rays from the beacon so that the beacon light really appeared to come from a place other than its real source
the pilots of course not knowing this would either misjudge their height above the ground or their latitude or longitude and would either crash into the ground or go far off their course
this story by the way is one of the best of its kind that were finds two mistakes editor i have just finished reading your first issue of air wonder stories and have enjoyed it more than any other of your publications
yes
your other magazines were good but this magazine seems a little better
i like the idea of putting in the aviation news of the month drawings are very good hut on the cover where he pictures tnc islands of the air there seems to be two mistakes
one is that the shadow of the tower on the island nearest the top falls in a different direction than any of the others
the other is that the thing on the island that shows which way the wind is blowing so that airplanes know from which direction to land is pointing in the opposite direction of that in the smoke is going down on the ground
i want to thank you for the enjoyment you have given me and hope every issue will be as good as your first
mihraukec
wise
the editor cheerfully admits the justice of mr criticism of the two errors on the cover design for the first issue of air wonder stories
as mr kauper we understand is only we must congratulate him on his keenness of perception as well as concentration on the details of the drawing
we arc always happy to receive such criticisms
in fact the editor is becoming worried about his mental state
the letters received are almost uniformly filled with words of congratulation and praise
he often sighs on finishing a letter to find not a bit of criticism no oldfshioned brickbat that stirs him on page

continued from page dirigibe for meteorological study xact studies of meteorological conditions as well as certain radio effects will be afforded the massachusetts institute of technology by the loan of the dirigible mayflower for the summer observation station at south dartmoutht mass by the company
the studies of radio waves will take place by having the ship remain atwve the antennae and measure the energry radiated from the station
there will be measurements of the size and thickness of fogs and general weather studies impossible on the ground or on planes the latter because of the inability of tbe plane to remain stationery
eventually it is hoped that a relar weather service can be established and forecasts broadcast

with a lessened fire risk than the ordinary gasoline engine and affording better operation of the planes radio the diesel engine according to mr keys secs definite advantages
the lowered cost of fuel which the diesel engine also shows is not believed by mr keys to be important as he says the fuel cost on one line the transcontinental air transport is only cents a mile where as the total cost of operation is cents a mile
other aircraft executives disagree with mr keys however and do not believe tbe diesel promises much
steam turbines proposed for large planes ecause of the prohibitive weight of gasoline engines when used for planes having a great power the possibility of using tbe team turbine has been open according to ljungstrom steam turbine company of stockholm
they are now preparing specification for an american plane which is to have a power of to horsepower
there would le a high pressure boiler fed with crude oil the boiler to supply steam for two turbines
a turbine weight as low as two pounds horsepower as been reached
the use of this method would permit of slower propeller speeds
the steam after being used would be exposed to large cooling surfaces on the wings of the plane for condensation
although the weight of fuel would be greater than on the gasoline engine the cost would be less
unsafe plane has perfect safety record years ago the type navy flying boat was branded as being unsafe and navy fliers were warned not to stunt in it
they were to be used only on the routine cruising and patrolling work
whether because of this or in spite of it a recent tabulation of the record of that type of craft shows flying hours covering miles without a single fatality
aviation experts reviewing a recent wave of fatal plane accidents have been forced to come to the conclusion that safe planes remote recklessness on the part of pilots and cnee accidents while the dangerous plane is so carefully handled that it becomes safe
twenty miles an hour added to army planes he use of a chemical to cool the curtiss hawk airplane engines used by the army as pursuit ships has introduced the possibility of great saving in weight and afforded great increase in the speed of ships according to brie
general william gilmore
the ships ne a much smaller radiator surface and thus the wingskin radiator has been used with a great reduction in tbe parasitic resistance
there has also been a great saving in weight as little water is need and thus more military equipment can be carried or more pay load if the ship is used for commercial traffic
the chemisal used is ethyleneglycol mentioned in these columns previously
editor
lunch hour discussions editor although just out of my sophomore year at high school i thought it might interest you to know what an effect and reaction boys and girls of my age have to your magazines
at present i am going to the telegraph school at western union and have found to my immense pleasure that fully per cent of the students read our magazines and have read tbe one you edited formerly before you started science and aib wondbk stories magazines
in each case they have the opinion that your magazines are a per cent improvement over tbe old
during lunch we have very interesting and animated discussions over the different features of the stories and often very ingenious and plausible theories arc advanced in regards to future events and to explain some things we do not understand
last fall i entered high school two months late and sied up physics as one of my subjects
having lost nearly onequarter of the school year it ordinarily would have been very difficult for me to catch up but because i have read your editorials since i was about years old i had no difficulty in taking up physics at that time and catching up with my work
all this because of the scientific knowledge i had absorbed
the alien intelligence was a wonderful story have more like it
the radium pool bids fair to be a classic second only to the moon pool
the moon beast is rather farfetched
i havenot finished the feminine metamorphosis yet so will withhold my opinion
the eternal man is good but lets have a secret ending of the poor professor
in air wonder stories men with wings was the best written with islands in the air a close second
i wonot decide yet about the ark of the covenant
your science and aviation news departments alone are worth the price of the magazines have more stories by stone and the writer of the visitation and how about another cover contest
by the way there has been quite an argument about leslie stone
some contend it is a girl others it is a ixiy
at any rate bet leslie is rather young
please give us all the information you can address age and sex
personally i think it is a boy and about or years old from the picture to greater and better science wonder stories and air wonder stories
salt lake city utah
leslie stone is a young woman of we should judge twentytwo
we are glad to get the insight into the effect of our stories on our readers
the description of mr petersen helps to fill in the background of the glimpse we are trying to get of our reader group
editor wants sequel to air master editor congratulations youve made another hit
i have just finished reading your second issue of the air wonder stories and its almost as good as its sister magazine
i am an ardent reader of both
first let me say a word or two about that incomparable story the ark of the covenant
in ray opinion it is the best air story you will ever publish in your magazine
i am reading it over for tbe fourth time and i still get that same old kick from it
another story i thought was very good was gravity by earl repp
give us some more from him
the air master was another one that makes your blood tingle as you read it the author give us a sequel
i really think one is due
there is one story i didnot like
it was islands in the air
the science was good but the plot was that same old thing where the villain comes back and steals the plans of the invention
now donot give us any more of that stuff
that is one thing liked about the ark of the covenant
there was no sneaking villain to steal the plans of the new airship tbe merlin
i think one of the best things about your magazine is the wonderful illustrations my mr paul
he is without question the best artist that you could secure tor that kind of work
i admit that some of earthmen are not quite perfect but when to comes to drawing men from other planets and huge fantastic drawings of machinery and laboratories paul has them all skinned a mile
i think one or two more illustrations wouldnot hurt the magazine
5ne more brickbat and sign off
please for goshs sake print on a better grade paper
it will not only help the appearance but it will reduce tbe size
tbe idea of printing the authors portrait along with his story is a good one
keep it up
charlotte
as if made to order a sequel to the air master by edward cbappelow is already in our hands
we believe it is better than the original story
it will probably appear in the november issue
we are surprise that mr pitts did not like islands in tbe air as we considered it a very good story
although it may seem a version of the old villain theme still the facts of our every day life show that mr morrow has not overstated the case
anyone readtnp a life of alexander graham beil will realize bow frequently men are cheated of tbe rewards of their inventions by such men as mr morrow describes
editor
wants humorous aviation story editor i have received two copies of air wonder storries so far and both were very good
i would like to know whether you are going to have a quarterly or annual
in the august issue the silent destroyer was very good but a little too short
the ark of the covenant was also very good
i agree with albert taylor in that you ought to have a humorous aviation story once in a while
i would like to know what a kilometer and a kilo are in american measure
chicago
we feel a little proud in being able to fill our readers needs almost as they appear
suitcase airplanes is an aviation story written in a humorous vein by a newlyfound writer of fine ability
we cannot yet divulge fais name
but bis story will appear shortly
a kilometer is about fiveeights ot our mile a kilo gram is poundsdt7or questions nordic superiority editor i have just finished the story men with wings and have come to tbe conclusion that as a writer of scientific stories stone will make a good school teacher
the story was almost improbable
in tbe first place you know that every invention or scientific theory is based on something that has gone before
how is it possible that years ago a man did such wonderful things as a gland transformation especially from a bird
where would he place this gland as there is no place in the human body that could use a gland that was absolutely useless to it
next the mentorites would not be the perfect beings that she described them as it seems to roe their shoulders would broaden considerably and they would gradually develop into birds
if men ever do develop wings they will be more like the wings of hats stretching from the hands to tbe feet
men will have to undergo grreat body changes if this were to come about donot see how this would help you express your souls desire or whatever she said her language was entirely too flowery
it would seem like cveryday life to the person with wings
next i am anglosaxon and celtic and donot intend to be called a nordic or classed with scandinavians yust came over
the celt and saxon are usually as dark as the french and are a mixture of northern and southern blood and therefore cannot be called nordics you realize what a flimsy thing any race lino as all men are a mixture
nor is there anything as race superiority as where one nun falls down the next is up
now for something nice to say
every story except men with wings was good and i wish you good luck on your new publications
minneapolis minn
mr idea about men with wings is well taken
there would undoubtedly have to be a scat for the wings to grow
but what mentor did was to hasten the evolution that might have taken thousands of years
all qualities are transmitted through the blood and what mentor did was to instill those qualities and allow them to develop through the generations
we feel too that race superiority is not altogether well founded
races decay and vanish or flourish depending on a great many factors one of which is psychical editor

kaaoe address city from page does not favor aviation forum editor the brickbats in this letter will be like those in tbe letter i wrote to sciekce wondek you have published notice that btnntng with next issue will start a new department called aviation forum in which questions and answers will be published for one am not in favor of this new department
ala wonder stories should be purely a fiction magazine
such departments as the new one and aviation news of tbe month will spoil it
what you publish in aviation news of the month is not tbe latest news
the latest news can be obtained in any of tbe aviation or scientific mazines on the newsstands
the second irt of the ark of tbe covenant by victor is even better than tbe first
the air master by edward chappelow took second place and the silent destroyer hy henrick dahl juve third
the cover picture was the best yet
chicago we are happy to get frank expressions of opinion on the pcflicy of air wonder stories such as are contained in this letter
after all we can only get an index of our readers desires through such expressions
we invite our readers to give us their opinions on this subject
editor
from one of our authors editor thank you for the copies of each of your magazines which you have recently sent me
i have subscribed for air wonder stories which i was surprised to find not too different from science wonder stories
in view of the enormous interest in aviation the magazine should enjoy a good circulation and attract mai new writers and i feel that it win do so
personally though the scope is narrower and more limited as well as more technical and for these reasons does not interest me quite so much as a field for my writing
i have enjoyed the apparent hmitlessness of the for general scientifiction
it unique opportunities for originality
this may be wholly a feminine point of view for generally speaking i think more people are mterested in tbe future of aviation th they are in a diversity of scientific possibilities
it is probably a matter of taste and with your two excellent magazines you win attract both
lakewood omo
we print this letter from mrs harris one of our good sciencefiction authors to indicate her opinion a correct one of the general interest in the future of aviation
we hope for the sake of our readers to induce mrs harris to contribute to aia wonder stories
editor
will revolutionize air story field editor after reading your first edition i can assure you that it made a great hit with me as well as with all my friends who have joined me in reading this wonderful magazine which believe tvill revolutionize the entire air story field
having been keenly interested in tbe rapid progress of aviation tbe past i can readily see the dossibllities and viewpoints which your authors have
this is especially true in bloodless war by david keller
i actually believe that future wars will be fought exactly this way or in ways similar to it
but it certainly is true that we will have radiocontrolled shi in the near future have more of dr stories
the ark of the covenant by victor was a wonderful story though in my opinion a bit farfetched as far as completely stopping all transportation as well as putting its victims in a coma is concerned think he has carried it a bit too far
of course i have read only tbe first installment and there is probably some big surprises in store for me in next months installment grand rapids mich
we can agree heartily with mr driswl on the forccfulncss of dr presentation of a possible war to be fought from the air
gener mitchcl formerly commander of our air forces has shown convincingly that the airplane in the next war will be tbe most powerful weapon of offense and because it can descend on an enemy practically without warning will constitute a most terrible weapon

continued from page little doubt that the next war will be won from the air and probably with a suddenness that will stagger the defeated
by this time mr driscol will probably have read the second and third installments of the ark of the covenant and he will have perceived that the power given to the raiders is not a bit farfetched
the conditions are so possible of realization that a civilization not adequately protected from the enemies within its borders as well as from those from without may well tremble
editor
cites peril of foreign domination editor i have just recently finished reading your air wonder stories and i am writing this to congratulate you upon this splendid piece of work no sooner had finished it than it was borrowed and from that time it has gone the rounds
i am unable to say or guess how many persons eagerly perused this remarkable magazine
besides myself a number have intimated to me that the ark of the covenant promises to be one of the best stories they have ever read
as you said editorially the author victor is a past master at the art of writing as i have seen few stories which in my opinion have approximated this story in suspense interest style and literal construction
islands in the air the beacon of airport seven and men wings are every one most excellent stories hard to beat
i eecially want to commend dr the bloodless war
this graphically brings home our imminent peril of foreign domination
to a great extent the next war will be fought in the air and william mitchell has conclusively proved that the united states is absolutely unable to defend itself in the air
in the bloodless war dr keller shows what will soon happen to us unless we snap out of it
yes sir i reiterate
you have produced a fine magazine and as several have said it bids fair to lead science wonder stories in popular esteem
how about an air wonder quarterly
hobart okla
this letter of mr wardner is another of the flood of letters of congratulation that has reached the editor
as we have indicated on mr letter the nation that controls the air may well control the world
an enlightened public opinion with a full knowledge of the facts is what is needed
one cannot afford to look backward to or for a glimpse of what future warfare will be like
an announcement regarding the possibility of an air wonder quarterly will probably be made in the near future
no interplanetarian stories are contemplated at present for air wonder stories
it is believed by the editor that air wonder stories should concern itself with terrestrial aviation for that field really embraces a wide and thrilling field of play for the imagination of writer and reader alike
however we cordially invite the criticism of our readers on the editorial policy of air wonder stories we must please our readers edifor
wants two more magazines editor i have just read your latest magazine aiu wonder stories and find it exllent
i must also congratulate you on getting frank paul as your art director
i think most of his drawings are superb
islands in the air was the lst story i think
next to it i would rank the story the bloodless war
i did not like your first installment of the ark of the covenant by victor i have followed mr gemsback through his career and i think that he is fully capable of putting two more great sciencefiction magazines on the market
i wish you could persuade schlossel to writ a sequel to his story which appeared in your former magazine
the second swarm was the title of it
i have read nothing to equal this or do i think i ever will if mr schlossel docs not give us a sequel
minneapolis minn
we are not sure whether we understand mr scammon aright when he says we are capable of putting out two more sciencefiction magazines
does he mean two in addition to air wonder stories and science wonder stories
if so we feel mightily tell us truthfully mr scammon did you really mean two more edyor
waiting for the next issue editor recently purchased a copy should sa the first copy of air wonder stories have read it from cover to cover and enjoyed it immensely
the only thing i can find against it is that i wonot know what to do until the next issue comes out
the sketch of the author on the first page of every story is a very fine idea
keep it up
give us more stories by leslie stone
her men wth wings was fine
victor new serial sure keeps you in expectation
morrow and sykes are also very good
david keller is fairly good but for goodness sake donot overwork him
i found many interesting items in aviation news
if you keep up the good work i donot think i will ever nave any complaint
cincinnati ohio
somehow the editor has an impish desire to do somethings that will cause a complaint
it just isnot right that we should not receive some
hardened and matured as we are to brickbats like the krazy kat of wellknown associations we are rather lonesome without them
however we are over appreciative of the good things that are said about us editor
have there been winged men
editor want to compliment you on your new magazine as there is some very fine science in it and makes very good reading matter
your men with wings by leslie stone in the july issue was certainly a wonderful story and furnishes very good food for thought am a reader of your former magazines
i am only twelve and of course have a very limited knowledge of science but i like science stories and am very interested in science
has what has cleverly been thought of in men with wings ever been really tried by scientists
i suppose not but i was just wondering
amesburg mass
as far as our knowledge goes there has never been an experiment with man to give him real wings
there are of course the fabled stories of men wearing artificial wings and flying through the air
such a one is that of icarus whose father daedalus fitted him with wings and they both flew across the aegean sea
but icarus wishing to fly nearer the sun than his father dared rose high into the air
but the sun melted the wax that held the wings on him and he fell into the sea
some day either what miss stone prophesied will come true man will be endowed with wings or there will be developed artificial wings that he can remove when and as he wishes
possibly wings that he is forced to wear all the time might constitute something of a handicap to him
but there is no reason why something pictured for example in flight in in this issue should not come to pass
as bruce gould so truly says in his new book skylarking reviewed in this issue the desire of man to fly has always been with him as a deepseated spiritual need
the picture of people standing with arms outstretched toward the sky is a real and vivid one
perhaps in ages long gone by man once had wings
and even though millions of years have passed being chained to the earth has never satisfied him
down through the ages has trickled that stream of blood from our flying ancestors whether a flying reptile flying lizard or what not
and the sight of people flying only serves to awaken that primordial instinct
this of course is only an hypothesis but it has much to sustain it
editor
from an associate editor editor i have received your magazine and am tremendously interested in the stories
i have one boy of sixteen years of age and when science wonder stories and air wonder stories come aljout a dozen boys of the neighborhood gather in
and such interest i have never seen
so far as i have been able to judge in my own rush of affairs i think your magazines are great
if you desire i will write more fully about them when i can find time
with the very lest wishes
transylvania college ky
this letter from one of the associate editors of science wonder stories gives us a justifiable feeling of pride
that this scholar and scientist finds science wonder stories and air wonder stories such good reading for his son only confirms us in the belief that we are doing our job well

we would certainly be delighted to have from professor campbell as vigorous a criticism of our magazines as he can give

sighing we hereby pass on to our reader another of the it seems numberless letters of praise on air wonder stories
what can we say burdened down with such good words
editor
catches father reading ark of the covenant edetir until you began the publication of scxencx wonder stories and air wonder stories wondered if the master of our minds was deserting bis chosen field suddy through the medium of mr original delightfully imtamed skill found you again
the discovery immediately cost me fifty cents
oi an the sciencefiction issues have read the august issue of air wonder stories surpasses an for pure and complete enjoyment
ark of the
covenant beyond gravity and the air master etc all were splendid
after several fairly successful attempt to interest my father i caught him reading the ark of the covenant voluntarily
i believe tbat one should set for himself an unattainable as yet goal and work hard towards it and great things will be done
in other words one should read our magazines for ideas
you and your staff are unhesitating pioneers in glorious science you have liftra science fiction from trash to perfection and some day i hope to universal esteem
may the years only augment your efforts in advancing the work that jules verne wells and burroughs so ably began
indianapolis ind
the case of someone resisting the influence of our magazines by an unwillingness to dmit the education and entertainment value of such strange stories and then suddenly yielding to them is a common one we leam
we are all the more interested to hear that mr cretors father has become a convert we would like to bear from him to leam his reactions to the magazines and its stories
the future of science fiction is as unlimited as that of science itself
air wonder stories pioneering into the future of aviation as well as the other sciences aims to set itself up proudly as one of the apostles of the new order which must inevitably come
and because it is to be a socially beneficial order we want to hasten it
editor
an associate editor speaks editor i have received the july and august numbers of science wonder stories and air wonder stories and have read several of the stories with great interest am glad to note that you are going to include an aviation forum in air wonder stories beginning with the september number along with a department of aviation news of the month in your answers to the questions of mr benjamin jenkins on page of the august issue you are partly error in your answer to his second question
the sustaining force on the airplane is principally due to a partial vacuum on the top side of the wings
at high angles of attack about seventyfive per cent of the lift on the wings is due to the vacuum on the top of the wings
in other words there is never more than twentyfive per cent of the lift due to a pressure on the bottom

new regulations for transport pilots rom a survey of the accidents on airplanes during resulting in the conclusion that the human equation is responsible for about half the accidents and per cent of the total being due to the poor technique of pilots new and stricter regulations for transport pilots will put into effect on september 1st this was the statement of edward howard chief of the air regulations division of the department of commerce by transport pilots is meant those who pilot commercial planes or planes over a certain weight
the new regulations will allow transport pilots to only the type of planes they are licensed for
to fly any other new examinations must be taken
three classes of planes will be listed
the first is those weighing not more than pounds the second include weights of to pounds and the third over pounds
all licenses will be revised after september 1st and it is expted that safety in the air will be materially increased
development of safety greatest need he development of greater safety in aviation is the industrys greatest need declared john northrop chief engineer avion corporation as told to rochlen in the new york american
fog and fire are the two most deadly menaces which must be overcome
he believes that we are gradually eliminating these dangers
the elimination of fire will come from the use of engines and fuels especially designed for that purpose
in this connection the diesel engine is noted
aside from its low operating st it uses a nonexplosive crude oil and has its iwer system so that fire is practically impossible
planes of tomorrowj he says will powered by slim nigged diesels placed out of the way of parasitic drag and bead resistance
the need for pilots to know their altitude above the ground rather than that above sea level has given rise to the development of new altitude meters one of which nas been developed b the genera
electric company
such a meter is invaluable while the pilot flies in a fog
the use of radio beacons will not only guide the pilot through fogs and give him landmarks but with automatic stabilizers will keep him on bis course telephone conversations already carried out between a plane feet up and the ground promise well for keeping the pilot in touch with what is going on on page company assists flying club formation nthused by the reception that the flying club idea has been given by the country the swallow airplane company has engaged its research department on the task of forming clubs
a set of bylaws for use by clubs have been drawn up and are available through the company
the clubs are to be known as the swallow flying club of the city in which they are formed
the company is located in wichita kansas
the idea of the club is to allow people who have not the time or money to go to an air center to learn flying to do so at their own home cities at times convenient to wage earners
lure of aviation strong to youth igures showing the number of applicants for pilot8 licenses and student licenses indicate the lure of aviation to the youth of the country said jesse lankford chief of the licensing bureau of the department of commerce according to a new york times despatch
one of the great impulses toward aviation was given by col paris flight
the whole aviation industry has been given suclk an impetus and the need for trained flyers has grown so that a pilot can easily command a salary of a year today
at first most of the train flyers came from the army and navy but now the aviation schools are turning out thousands
nearly civilians hold student licenses issued by the department of commerce
what is safest method of travel i an attempt to discover just how safe the airplane is as a method of travel the washington star has collected figures on accidents by trains automobiles and airplanes for the year as a result of the operation of railroads one person was killed for every miles traveled
there was one fatality for every miles traveled by plane while the automobile accounted for only one death in miles of travel
but the deaths do not indicate the full extent of the risk
every fatality on trains carried with it accidents not fatal for every death by plane there were hardly two injuries while accompanying every automobile death there were persons injured
while the automobile apparently is safer than either of the other two its margin of safety is not great while the risk of travel by auto is increasing rapidly with the growing congestion
navy aids commercial aviation says ingalls rom the experience of the world war and taking an enlightened view of the future the navy department is doing all in its jpower to aid commercial aviation said david ingalls assistant secretary of the navy for aeronautics
since the armed forces of the country cannot be great enough either in men or uipment for cither an offensive or defensive war there must cxist some reserves which can be called upon
this was the text of one of the reasons why commercial aviation should be aided
the navy department is sharing with the air companies the improvements that it makes in planes and plane equipments
it is no longer competing with the commercial companies in any wajr it offers advice and maintains research divisions hoping that a great number of trained pilots and a number of jplanes convertible to national uses may be available
official record for altitude awarded neunhofen examination of the recording instruments used in the junkers monoplane piloted by willi neunhofen indicated that nc broke the world altitude record attaining a height of feet or less than feet short of eight miles
during his trip neunhofen passed through a temijcrature range of degrees fahrenheit for it was degrees above zero on the ground and degrees below when he arrived at the extreme altitude
at the top of his climb he became unconscious from the cold and his machine went into a glide descending almost four miles before he became conscious again
his safety was made possible by an automatic device attached to tnc steering wheel
as soon as his hands were taken from the steering wheel the time when he slipped into unconsciousness an oxygen flow was released and the motor was shut off thus provoking the glide

ejiclosed please find for which send me the next eight issues of name address city state by bruce gould illustrated pages stiff cloth covers size 554x8 published by horace liveright new york
price mr gould who is aviation editor of the new york post has been an enthusiast about aviation from his early boyhood
he therefore takes on with some grace the post of apostle and exponent of the new art of aviation
for art it is according to mr gould
there is to nothing in his book that smacks of the carrying of beef or cheese or dry goods
aviation to him is principally a thrilling experience that the gods have put into the lap of man
and man using it to swing through the starry weights of night or straight into the blazing orb of tte sun laughs his defiance of those gods is therefore a symphony on the joy of flying
it is written with the authors strained to the utmost to catch all fleeting shades of meaning that a trip through terrestrial space allows
perhaps he overdoes his coloring so that the reader feels hnally a sensation of surfeit
but if that is true mr gould probably errs on the side of too much enthusiasm rather than too little sincerity
the lxok is not wholly taken up with the paean of joy at mans ability to fly
several chapters are devoted to the history of flying d of the great flights of the past ten years
the reasons for the success or failure of each analyzed with a striking impartiality
so although tribute is paid to lindbergh for bis spectacular flight to paris in the author mueves that alcock and brown who flew the atlantic from newfoundland to ireland in received too little credit by frank swoffer pages illustrated size 4ix7l4t stiff cloth covers published by isaac pitman sons new york
price learning to fly is a detailed study of the actual mechanics of flying the control of the machine
the author begins at the beginning by illustrating the simplest maneuvers of the plane the use of the elevators ailerons and dder taking the readers for a theoretical ride the author indicates how the controls should be applied in each case and the practical complexities that attend the use of the controls
the author wishes to make an art a practical art of the business of flying
therefore each possible situation in taking off maneuvering and landing receives his attention
interwting psychologically is the method of ulustrating a point by a picture in which the reader actually sees himself in the plane and behind the controls
this should help somewhat to give a student the feel of being the pilot of the plane
this book should be very valuable to flying clubs students receiving training and those who wish to know how little or how great the complexities of flying are by virginius evans clark pages illustrated stiff cloth covers size 5j4x854 published by ronald press company new york
price colonel clark we understand is an international authority on airplane design and construction having been the chief aeronautical engineer of the army for five years
we must therefore grant him the qualifications to write authoritatively on the principles of aviation
elements of aviation seems designed to provide basm understanding of the principles of flight
through a study of the effect of air flow on the airfoils of a plane we learn the aerynamio principles that operate the plane
for one who wishes really to fly too much can not be learned about the elusive and often temperamental factors that govern flight ror being based on such a fluid and evermoving thing as air flight requires a knowledge of the physical laws that govern the air
particularly interesting is the chapter on the wrths atmosphere
here the extent and quality oi the atmosphere the ceiling etc are analyzed and explained both from a mathematical and a general point of view
the possibilities of high speed at high altitudes now seriously engaging the attention of aeronautical expats considered subjects in the book receive a careful mathematical treatment and therefore it is of special interest to those who wish the quantitative and not merely the qualitative elementa of the flight problem from page what is ae roll and immelman torn
editor accept my heartiest congratulations on the splendid two issues of am wonder stories that i have seen thus far
they cer tainly do credit to your name and reputation am very much interested in this new department to be called forum aim will be an eager and interested reader of it
as my share of the questions allowed i would like to know what the famous turn is that writers on military aviation speak so much of
also what is a roll
wilmington del
the immelman turn invented by capt immelman one of the great german aces during the late war is a combination of inside loop and a roll
the pilot pulls the stick fully back so that the elevator rises and turns the lane over on its back
at the same time he wers the aileron on one side and raises it on the other so that the ple turns over on its side
tbe opposite is often found in diving when a diver will jump into the air execute a half somersault and then before he reaches the water twist over on his side
the roll means sunrfy what it implies the turning of the plane over on its side by continuously raising one aileron and keeping the other depressed ac companymg diagram illustrates these points editor
thts pttmih an fhnsforfs with 0sicfe slip ant turns ovor as at ntenisnghted by anothorstcff ic position showing the ron and the immelman turn note the position of the plane at each position and the change in position of the plane

correcting too editor aviation fomm often heard it said that landing is one of the most difficult parts of piloting a plan
i have often wondered just what a pilot could do if be were gliding to earth at too steep an angle and when near the ground suddenly discovered his error
could he save bireself and his ship
i would appreciate an answer to this espwially in diagram form if you do find space for one
kansas city
mo
such a predicament as mr brown describes is one that would call for a great deal of steep landing skill
if we assume that he comes out of the flide at say twenty feet from the ground the two diagrams shown would indicate what would happen in two contingencies
if after coming out of the glide the craft heads upward again and the pilot does not correct this he will find that the plane will stall on the upward climb and it will probably pancake to earth as shown in the upper figure
if however he depresses the nose of the craft after coming out of the glide while he still has fiying speed he can continue the glide to earth at a smoother angle tn before and make a safe bl imi utn tocbtot iwild 20feet ground level too fast wkal pilot do ukk te lb mtaf ad cairy otf a nomul wrong and right way to correct a glide which is at too steep an angle with the ground

i mean to keep all my copies and we cant all kp one copy
memphis te editor aviation forum would you please tell me if you can who the first man was to fly the english channel have had a number of disputes about this point maintaining it was bturiot a frenchman
others claim it was langley the american
what kind of a machine did the man have and what speed did he make
i want to congratulate you while am writing on air wonder stories
i think it is a corking magaaine and am sure it will be very all my friends borrow my copy and read it and they surely like it
however i must set them to subscribe for their own for
the first man to fly the english channel was louis bleriot a frenchman
so you were right in all but the spelling of his name
he used a monoplane of his own construction powered by a threecylinder motorcycle engine having about horsepower
he flew miles the distance between
calais and dover in minutes a remarkably good speed for the time when he made the flight editer
